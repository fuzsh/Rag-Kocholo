UNIVERSITY OF VICTORIA LIBRARY EDITOK’S NOTE. The inclusion of a “Life of Grey” and a History of the Explorers of Australia” in a “Makers of Australasia Series” required no explanation ; t lie pertinency of this, the third volume, on “The Maoris of New Zealand” may not be so readily acknowledged, but is nevertheless real, founded, as it is, on the firmly established principle of the sequence and continuity of History. The British colonisation of New Zealand involved a violent change in the conditions of life in these Islands; but it did not break all connection and interplay between the Maori era and the Pakeha age that was then beginning: the dispossessed people had a distinctive native culture, the product of centuries of evolution, and they were not decimated by the process of settlement and conquest. The life we live to-day is coloured, it may be faintly in some of its forms, but still undeniably tinged, by the light streaming fitfully out upon us from the past when the Maori possessed the land. And it is worthy of remark that this influence is strongest, not on the lower planes of existence, but in the higher stages of our thought and feeling. The Maori had done little to shape the country so as to satisfy the Pakeha’ s economic needs: still a barbarian, he had not learnt how to re-act upon Nature and to modify his environment with the skill of the Englishman, “heir of all the ages”; and, therefore, for the reading, bridging, deforesting, prospecting, and even the cultivating that were the Pakeha’s first tasks, he had laid but a slight foundation; though his centuries-old experience was freely drawn upon by the colonist in learning the natural resources — the economic value of the plants, fishes, etc., and the weather cycles. But in other domains the influence of the Maori, always sensible, has of late increased rapidly in volume, and will extend until much of the art and poetry and science and VI 11 editor’s note philosophy of the Dominion will find inspiration in the faithful pictures of the old Maori community drawn by diligent, truthful, and sympathetic students and historians of the race, such as Mr. James Cowan, the author of this book. And when the conditions of life in New Zealand have been raised to that degree which will ensure that more leisure shall be available for the satisfaction of our higher needs; when the people, through their rich men, their Government, and their University, will provide adequate means for the growth of culture and of that knowledge which has no obvious immediate or direct practical utility, but which may nevertheless be of immense ultimate significance for the well-being of the nation, then attention will be much more firmly fixed upon the achievements, customs, and habits of the Maori as presenting a store of facts illuminating vividly certain important stages in the history of religion, of language, of human institutions, and indeed the general development of the human mind. It is a just reproach against most New Zealand students of the political, economic, and general social development of mankind that they are content to take their illustrations of the principles of the social sciences — sociology, economics, ethnology, etc., _ from the experience of other races in other lands. ' with no thought of the valuable data awaiting research in the records of the native civilization. The reason, therefore, for including this volume in the Series is not only because New Zealand and the New Zealanders of to-day would have been different from what they are, if there had been no Maori occupation of the country, but also because it is hoped that a book, such as this is. adding greatly to the authenticated facts relating to Maori culture may help to turn the thoughts of those who wish to know the Story of Man in all his manifestations towards the tieasuies that may lie unlocked at the touch of the investigator ol human evolution in the traditions and annals of the Maori-Polynesian. Mr. Cowan's book embodies the results of observations and enquiries made during a life-long intimacy with the Maori people. From his earliest years, he has known the Maori, and the work of collecting, translating, and interpreting the history, ’k-lore, and poetry of the race has occupied traditions, folk editor’s note ix whatever time he has been able to spare from journalistic work during a period of many years. Even if we accept one of the narrowest definitions of History, we must acknowledge that tin* presence of the Maori bestows on New Zealand, as contrasted with Australia, great historical interest. The early trading adventures, and the wars — particularly those of 1860-70 — have given us much picturesque material and a military record, at times creditable to both Pakeha and Maori — which Australia entirely lacks. Disastrous though these wars seem from most points of view, they are not altogether to be regretted, for they brought out some of the best qualities of both races; and some of the most striking examples of the exercise of these, Mr. Cowan now records for the first time. JAMES HIGHT. Canterbury College, Christchurch, N.Z. November 23rd, 1909. AUTHOR’S PREFACE. Tii this study of the Maori race an endeavour has been made to show something of the history, religion and mythology, customs, and social life and institutions of the people. Many an interesting survival of ancient faiths and ancient ways is to be noticed amongst the Maoris of to-day, and the stories illustrating these beliefs are now published for the first time, as also are those dealing with the intertribal wars of old. Amongst the other matter new to print are numerous folk-stories and examples of nature-lore and forest-craft, specimens of karakia or ritual and incantations for the various needs of life, and examples of the beautiful Maori poetry. Students of New Zealand history will find an entirely new version of the Wairau “massacre” of 1843, as narrated by a Maori warrior. The story of the battle of Orakau. by Tupotahi and others, contains much that has not been given in previous narratives, and throws a new light on certain episodes in that heroic last stand of the Kingites. The life of the Maori of to-day is dealt with in several chapters. The notes used in this book have been gathered at first hand ■ from the kaumatuas, the old and learned men, of many tribes, but chiefly those of the Waikato, Ngati-Maniapoto, Arawa, Ngati-Tuwharetoa, Urewera, and Taranaki. Whatever new matter is here presented is offered as a small contribution to the great work of Maori research done in the past and still being done by Mr. S. Percy Smith, Colonel W. E. Gudgeon. Mr. Hare Hongi, Mr. ELsdon Best. Mr. Edward Tregear, the Rev. T. G. ITammond. and other Maori-Polynesian scholars. The traditions, folk-stories, and songs given were gathered in all sorts of places and under varied circumstances from the elders of the race — around the camp fire on summer nights on the shores of one or other of the beautiful lakes in the Rotorua PREFACE Xll country, in the Taranaki bush, in the settlements of the King Country and Taupo, in the homes of the Waikato canoe-men, in the bark-roofed wharepunis of the Urewera forest-dwellers. Many of the fine old men who were my tutors in things Maori have passed to the Reinga; amongst them Tamati Hapimana, of Mokoia Island; Te Araki, of Owhatiura, Rotorua; Waharoa, of Rotorua ; Paora Tuhaere, of Orakei, Auckland ; Honana Maioha, of Manukau. To these and to many men who are still in this Land of Light, such as the venerable Patara te Tuhi, of the Ngati-Mahuta tribe; Taua Tutanekai Haerehuka, Te Matehaere, and Rangiriri, of the Arawa ; and Tupotahi, of Ngati-Maniapoto’ I have a deej) sense of gratitude for my initiation into some of the mysteries of the Maori mind, and for stories and songs without end. I hose who really know the Maori, know his good points as well as his failings, cannot but have a liking for the race, particularly the men of the old generation, such as the chief described in the opening chapter. Those who, like the writer, have seen the Maori at his best and at Ids worst, have shared with him m his pleasures and sorrows, and have seen him when the old savage blood surged up again and lie rushed for his gun in defence of what he considered to be his rights, have a lively sympathy with his aspirations and a hope that he will regain his ancient vigour and vitality, if not the ancient fire and live to develop the best that is in him on level terms, social and political, with bis white fellow-countryman. Most of the illustrations used in this book, over sixty in number, from photographs and drawings, are now reproduced for the first time. Amongst them are some of historical value. One of these is a sketch of the famous llougi Hika, drawn recently by Major-General Robley from the oil-painting of llongi and Waikato in England in 1820; this is the only authentic picture of llongi in existence. Two smaller sketches are also fro... General Robley ’s pencil. The frontispiece to the book is a new portrait of the celebrated Kingite chief Patara te Tuhi. the one-time editor of the “Hokioi,” and Sir John Gorst’s old antagonist and friend. Another full-page illustration is a pen- and-ink drawing of a remarkable Maori shrine, the stone carved linage of the goddess I Ioroirangi, at the Tihi-o-Tonga which PREFACE xiii though within ;i few miles of Rotorua town, has been kept secluded from all pakeha eyes till quite recently. For the drawing of Ahumai. the heroine of Orakau, and several photos of old fighting-men of the Ngati-Tuwharetoa tribe, I have to thank Captain T. Ryan, of Taupo; and for several pictures of canoeing on the Waikato River, Mr. L. Hinge, of Christchurch. The two sketches depicting fights in the Waikato War of 186:1-4 are from water-colour drawings by the celebrated Major Von Tempsky, who was killed at Te Ngutu-o-te-Manu, Taranaki, in 1868; these pictures are in the possession of Von Tempsky ’s daughter, Mrs. Kettle, of Napier, who kindly permitted photos to be taken of them. JAMES COWAN. Wellington, New Zealand, November 10th, 1909. b NOTE ON MAORI PRONUNCIATION. The system of writing to which the early missionaries reduced Maori lias a phonetic basis, and once the vowel sounds are learned pronunciation is not dillicult. The learner should remember that there are no silent vowels in Maori. Every syllable ends with a vowel, and every vowel must be sounded. The vowel sounds are much the same as in Italian. There are fifteen letter-sounds in the Maori alphabet, viz.: a, e, h, i, k, m, n, o, y, r, t, u, w, ng, wh. Each vowel has a long and a short value, which can be exactly indicated only bv accent marks. A has one sound, Italian a, but with long and short values. The long sound is much the same as in the English words ‘‘father,” ‘‘part,” ‘‘path.” The short a is pronounced as iu the English words “pat,” ‘‘matter,” ‘‘cat.” Examples : — Long sound: pd (fort); hangi (oven) = ha-ngee; tune ( husband )=tah -nay; tudhu (altar) =too-ah-hoo ; tuyere (mirth) =tah-perray; Tcard (a stone). Short sound: pdtu (club); laid (near); tdngi (to cry). E is pronunced as a, as in English ‘‘pate”; not like ‘‘ee” in ‘‘eel.” Examples: — pehea (how)=pay-hay-ah; koe (thou)=ko-ay ; tena (that) =tay-nah. Short e as in ‘‘pet,” ‘‘send,” ‘‘ferry.” Examples: mere (club) =merray ; kerikeri (gravel) =kerrykerry; peke (jump)=pekkay. I is pronounced as ee in ‘‘keep,” or “sheep”: Ariki (chief )=a-ree-kee; miere (honey) =mee-eh-ray. Short i: as piri (to cling) ; Tciri (skin). 0 is pronounced as o in the English word “note”: — torori (tobacco) = toh-roh-ree (this shows both the long and the short sounds) ; Botorua= Ro-to-rua, not Rot-er-rua, as often mispronounced. U is pronounced like oo in “cool,” and u in “pull”; puta (opening) = poo-tah ; pure (a religious ceremony) =poo-ray; puke (hill)— poo-kay ; hue (vegetable gourd) — hoo-ay. There is no arbitrary rule in regard to the accenting of vowels, and the long and short vowel sounds must be ascertained by practice. Generally, however, words of two syllables are accented on the first syllable, as in tane ; paru-, mdru-, mokai; pdtu ; etc. There are exceptions, as kard ; matd-, para. Words of three syllables are accented sometimes on the first, some¬ times on the last syllable, as in tdpere, and matatd. The diphthongal sounds require careful pronunciation. The diphthongs are: — ae ; aij ao; au; ei; ou; besides those which are simply doublings of the letters as aa; ee; oo : ii; uu; which are given a fuller aud stronger sound iu consequence. Ae, as in such words as waewae (feet), is pronounced broad and full, as in the English word “aye,” and should not be given the more slender sound of i in “ shine. ’ ’ Ai is pronounced much as i in “strike.” Examples: tai (sea), kai (food) mai (hither). XVI NOTE ON MAORI PRONUNCIATION Ao is distinct from au, which has a shorter, sharper sound. The o should be sounded, but not abruptly separated from the a. Ao is often mispro¬ nounced as “ay-oh, ” as in the name of New Zealand, Aotea-roa. The proper pronunciation is, deliberately, Ah-oh-tay-ah-ro-ah, or, more quickly, Ow-tay-ah-roa. Au, as in hau (wind), and maumau (waste), is sounded much as “how” and ‘ ‘ count ’ ’ in English. The exact sound of ei and ou can be perfected only by practice; the best rule for the learner’s guidance is to remember that the second letter of the diphthong must not be suppressed, but must be distinctly indicated in pronouncing the syllable, as ou in koutou (you). The consonant ng must be pronounced as one letter and given somewhat the sound of the nasal in the French word “encore.” The English words “singing” or “bringing” divided thus: — “si-nging, ” “bri-nging” will be some guide to the pronunciation of the Maori “ ng There is no g alone sounded in Maori. For instance the word tangata (man) is divided into syllables thus: — Ta-nga-ta, not tan-gata. Tangi (weep) is pronounced Tah-ngee; rangi (sky), rali-ngee. Tauranga is pronounced Taii-ra-nga, not Tau-raug-ga, as is often done. Tongariro, To-nga-ree-ro. Runanga, Roo-nah-nga. J.C. LIST OF CONTENTS. CHAPTER T.

Hau-auru — “The West-Wind” — is a picturesque figure who, in my memories of the past, personifies much of the departed savage glory of the Maori race. He typified the splendid dying manhood of his people. Born in the New Zealander’s Stone Age, he survived to near the end of the miracle-working white man’s nineteenth century, flotsam of the primitive world stranded on the shores of modern progress — “like an old canoe,” to use his own image. Well I remember that tattooed patriarch, the head-chief of his little clan, the Ngati- Matakore, though it is more than twenty years since I Last saw him. It is long since he joined the shades of his warrior fathers in the Reinga, the Maori Ghost Land, hut he was of those bold characters that one never forgets. His bom e-kainga, the little reed-thatched village of Araikotore, with its surrounding cultivations, stood on a sunny northward-looking sweep of hill-slope in the King Country, on the old road which wound over the fern-lands from the frontier township of Kihikihi to the then purely Maori settlement of Otorohanga. To the north you saw the triple parapeted round hills of Tokanui, which the white settlers called the Three Sisters; southwards over many a mile of flax and fern and forest rose the misty blue mountains of the Rangi- toto Range. Hau-auru and his tribe cultivated industriously, and their fields of wheat and oats and potatoes and maize made a pleasant oasis in the wastes 9 THE MAORIS OF HEW ZEALAND of rank green fern and tutu scrub. Here the stray pakeha traveller, riding past, would receive a hospitable call to join the hapu at their meal, a welcome with shawl- waving and long-drawn ont cries of “ Haere-mai, e te pakeha! Ilae-ere mai-i! Haere-mai hi te kai-i-i!” And when the steaming pork and potatoes, fresh from the earth-oven were placed before the pakeha — whose long breezy ride had put a handsome edge on his appetite — and were followed by a bush dessert of tender boiled cobs of kaanga — maize — or a basket of peaches, he would say to himself that there were worse things in the way of food than a hdngi- cooked Maori meal. For drink there was a calabash of cold water, for the hue gourd from which calabashes or taha were made were still grown here, and this was the last kainga at which I ever saw a taha used; later there was perhaps a “billy” of hot tea. And old Hau-auru, after his two wives had fed his youthful pakeha guest, would squat there on his flax mat smoking his torori — the mighty odour whereof has been compared to old boots burning — with a beaming grin of huge kindliness wrinkling his corrugated old face, and enquire the news of the frontier township. There was something grimly grand about that ancient man, as he sat there in the sun in front of his raupo hut. He was of broad strong frame, square-shouldered, with a pugdistic depth of chest. His head, high in forehead, was uncommonly massive and powerful; his great brows overhung deep keen old eyes, and his face was closely tattooed in deep-chiselled lines and spirals, so com¬ pletely tattooed that he seemed blue-black of visage. This white hair, cut short, had a combatant wiriness; his face had been divested of every hair. One ear-lobe was enormously distended, with a hole in it several inches long ,u which he wore on special occasions a large bunch f wh;te ,Im'n.v Jlll)”tross feathers; from the other ear \"|]|g hy a ril,bon « heavy greenstone pendant, A shirt ;1 *on£ blanket were all the clothes he wore when h°™' A n°meric Personality was that of this old canmha' warrior, a savage but a gentleman, full of THE MAORI : PAST AND PRESENT *) courteous friendly feeling for the whites whom lie had oiKie fought and bitterly hated, and full of the hospitable generosity of the true Maori langatira, who would share his last basket of potatoes with the stranger without expecting anything in return. Hau-auru was born early in the second decade oi the last eenturv, a period when the interior oi New Zealand knew almost nothing of pakcha manufactures. He was a big strong youth before he ever saw a white- skin. The son of a fighting-chiel of A t iki rank, lie was soon after birth dedicated to the service of the war-god Tu with priestly sprinklings and incantations, and a ti- palm — which the white man calls “cabbage-tree” — was planted to mark the tapu spot where he was born, within the stockade of the liill-fort Te Paiti. When he grew to manhood and followed his elders on his first war-path, the white man had not much voice in New Zealand affairs, save as a coast-trader and purveyor of muskets and ammunition. The Maori would give all he possessed in those days of almost constant warfare to obtain the new weapons in which his heart delighted most, the bright-barrelled flintlock musket, with a keg of powder and a bag of bullets. The musket was a necessary of life, and the Maori’s desire for it rose to frenzy. Young Hau-auru and his comrades, with their slaves and women, toiled like madmen in the manufacture of hemp or muka from the flax-plant for barter to the traders at Kawhia, the nearest port frequented by the two or three trading brigs and schooners from Sydney that ventured iu over the West Coast bars; they even bore their loads of flax — or made their slaves bear them — as far away as Tauranga, on the opposite coast, in search of arms and powder. Every tribe lived in strongly stockaded villages on terraced hill-tops; you may count these ancient ruined parapeted forts, now covered with fern, by the score in Hau-auru ’s old tribal territory. Long war-canoes swept with flashing paddles up and down the rivers. The people were beginning to add the blanket to tlieir woven flax mats, but refused the restraint of 4 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND other pcikeha garments. The law of tapu was the supreme Criminal Code Act, enforced not by musket and tomahawk but by dreadful malevolent spirits ; the tohungas or sorcerers plied their occult trade, and performed the thousand religious rites necessary for the preservation of life and of tribal mana. Slain enemies were not wasted, for they went into the oven, and the young warrior Han-anru many a time ate human flesh. From a tkrtrh by Major! irnrral Roblry. at Matala, Hay of Vlrnty, in 1H85.

THE MAORI: PAST AND PRESENT The Hau-auru could tell of many a wild ceremony of the war-path, of the strange tapu laid upon the warriors when they marched away to battle, and of the rites observed upon their victorious return — the high chant of the home-dwelling tohunga, the high-priest, as he went forth to greet the returning men of blood, naked save for the mat'o-taua, the war-girdle: “T haere inai Tu i wheal” (“Whence comes the war-god Tu?”) and the air-shaking response of the war-party as they waved their brightly-polished guns and quiveied then tomahawks and stone patus on high, and roaied theii chorus of reply: “I haere mai i te kimihanga, T te hahaunga I a Tu ! ’ Te-ere, tere, tere-nui na Tu ! (“We have come from the seeking-out, From the searching Of Tu! Travellers, great travellers of Tu!”) Raid and foray, massacre and pillage. The wild inland tribes carried fire and tomahawk as far away as Maketu, on the Bay of Plenty coast, and not until the general adoption of Christianity by Waikato and Ngati- Maniapoto about 1840, did these terrible wars of exter¬ mination cease. Later, Hau-auru, now leader of his hopu , threw himself with savage energy into the national movement for the establishment of the Maori Kingdom, together with Te Heuheu, Rewi Maniapoto, Patara te Tuhi, Taonui, Te Rangi-ka-haruru (“The Thundering-Heavens”) and many another patriot chief. He fought the pakeiia in the Waikato War which followed, and survived to see the garden-lands of his people covered with the redoubts and farm-houses of the conquering race, and for many a year he camped sullenly with his fellow Kingites behind the border-line of the Puniu, planning the re-conquest of the Waikato, a scheme that was never carried into effect, for the Kingite cause was lost for good and all. 6 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND The Haii-aurii, diving- back into the days of pure savagedom, could tell of strange men and stranger happenings; of his ancestral canoe, the Tainui, and the wizard chief who sat in her hows; of wondrous star- myths, and of the rainbow-god Uenuku, who guided Tainui over the stormy Ocean-of-Kiwa, to this country; of the ancient tribal wars of the Waikato, when every bend of that great river, in Maori proverb, had its taniwha, its powerful chief — “he pi ko he taniwha, he piko he taniwha ” — of the priestly powers of the Wh auwhau-Ha ra- heke , that tribe, gifted by the gods, whose members were able to “ charm ” a school of whales ashore for a chieftain’s funeral feast ; of the murderous wiles of the To- hunga Mahutu , the dreadful sor¬ cerer, who could kill men by the mere projection of the will, or strike them with insanity . or the living death ot ngerengere, the Maori leprosy. But more wonderful Ilian <m\\ of the miraculous works of the medicine-men ol Ins nation was the transformation which had taken place in Aotea-roa before his living eyes— the passing away of old Maoridom like a tale that is told, and the enthroning of the white man with his cities and railroads, Ins steamers and telegraphs.

I le could have soliloquised with Ossian’s grim hero, the grey-bearded ancient Col la: “Friends of my youth . . • the darkness oi age comes like the mist of the desert. My shield is worn with years! My sword is fixed in its place. 1 said to my soul, Thy evening shall be calm, thy departure like a fading light.” So haere-ra ! Vale, O West-Wind! It is well that your bones repose in the tribal grave on yonder tei laced bill. The white man’s flocks graze over your old home; the white man’s locomotive screeches through your old battlefields and hunting-grounds; the sacred memorials of the past are obliterated; your tribe is a remnant. Haere-ra! for the aukati border-line which you drew against the white man has vanished before his breath. The romance of the Rohe-potae has gone with you, and few there be who can tell where once stood the 1 eed- tliatched homes of your fighting ’Matakore. ******* Decidedly a more interesting type, that blanketed tattoo-spiralled old warrior, than the present generation of Maori rangatlra, who as often as not wears tailor- made clothes of the latest pattern, has a piano and a graphophone in his European-built house, is proud of his break at billiards, and whirls to the races in a motor-car. Hau-auru’s early training and environment and his outlook upon life bore about the same relation to those of the modern Maori, though so short a period of years separates them, as the early Briton’s life and sur¬ rounding bears to ours. His education, admirably fitted as it was for the preservation of life and the attainment of the good things that constituted happiness in his time, was that of the man of forest and fern, of raupo hut and dug-out canoe, the man of the Age of Stone. 8 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND lliis was the Maori whose past and present we shall consider, the race whose history is the most fascinating of am primitive people’s, whose record of wanderings on and on over the vast many-islanded seas from their remote birthlands is the most wonderful in the traditions of human adventure and endeavour. A people whose restless energy and daring, whose passion for explora¬ tion, for migration to and colonisation of new lands, whose love of the sea and pride in deeds of battle show strangely close affinity to some of the dominant traits of the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race. For they are a people whom ethnologists now have come to recognise as a long- severed offshoot of our own Caucasic stock. Chapter II. THE MAORI : PAST AND PRESENT {continued). It was a full century and a half before Columbus spread the sails of his high-pooped Santa Maria to the North-east Trades and steered boldly out into the unknown wastes of the Atlantic, that the band of Polynesian sailors from whom most of the Maoris of New Zealand trace their descent beached their long canoes on the shores of Aoteii-roa, after one of the most adventurous ocean voyages that oral tradition or written history has to tell of. The Pacific rovers, whose canoes are usually spoken of as the historic “Fleet,” were seamen and navigators beside whom our own European ancestors of that age were mere coasters. The names of the Aotea, the Tokomaru, the Tainui, the Arawa, the Takitimu, the Mamari, the Arai-te-uru crystallise stories of epic courage, of devoted enterprise, and remarkable seafaring skill. They are the recognised Pilgrim Ships of the New Zealand Maori, their ports of departure the reef -guarded lagoons of the Eastern Pacific Islands. But even they were not the first Pacific craft that made landfall on these shores. Centuries before, how many it is difficult to say, other wandering canoes had made these long-stretching islands, the first no doubt by accident of wind and weather rather than design. It is known that there was already a very considerable population in these islands, at any rate near the coasts, when the historic Fleet arrived. Though it is from the crews of the Aotea, the Tainui, the Arawa, and other canoes of the mid-fourteenth century that most accepted Maori genealogies spring, and the earlier aboriginal element is largely ignored, it is known that the Maori inter¬ married freely with the people whom he found already 10 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND in the land, and that the present native race is a mixture of the Tahitian and Earotongan immigrants and the earlier race — called by some tribes Te Iwi-a-Maui, or “Maui’s Nation” — who were found already in possession of most parts of the North Island coast-lands. From the evidence of tribal history and tradition and the genealogical lists which the Maoris memorise so remarkably, the traces of ancient human inhabitants sometimes revealed in the course of excavations, and those wonderful monuments of communal industry, the immense scarped and terraced liill-forts that abound in the northern parts of New Zealand, it is certain that the Maori immigrants of the Tainui and Arawa period landed in a country that was already fairly well-peopled. I am convinced that more than a thousand years before Captain Cook first explored these shores in the Endeavour the brown-skinned restless Polynesian, probably with a strain of the Melanesian black, had already settled in New Zealand, finding here the spacious¬ ness and freedom and peace denied him in the comparatively tiny islands of the mid-Pacific. Thus, before even the fearless Northmen in their long dragon-headed boats had sailed down upon the coast they named Vinland, and anticipated by five cen¬ turies Columbus’s discovery of America, the forefathers of our Maori tribes had steered their frail outrigger and double canoes far down into the mysterious South Pacific, leaving the soft tropics for one of the stormiest seas on the globe, and had undauntedly made their homes in a new and wonderful and very wild country, where all the conditions of life were much more strenuous and rugged than in their languorous palm-clad equatorial isles and atolls. Such in briei was the immediate origin of Ihe Maori •‘‘ice whom the early white explorers found in these islands, the most vigorous and enterprising, proud, war- loving and ferocious of primitive peoples. The probable whence ol the race will he dealt with in succeeding pages ; just now it will he sufficient to indicate that their last THE MAORI: PAST AND PRESENT 11 Hawaiikis, or home-lands, before reaching New Zealand were the Oceanic groups of which Tahiti, Raiatea, and Huaheine, in the Society Islands, and Rarotonga, Mangaia, and Aitutaki, in the Cook Croup, are the principal islands, and also, in the case ot the earlier ininiigrants, probably Samoa and Fiji, before tin* latter group was overrun by the Melanesian or negroid type of people from the West. * The Maoris of New Zealand are the most important and numerous branch of the great Polynesian family, the races known to ethnologists as the “Sawaiori” — a combination of the names of the three chief Polynesian nations, those of Samoa, Hawaii, and Maori. Out of approximately 180,000 Polynesian [slanders, spread over the vast Pacific from the Marshall and Hilbert Islands in the west to lonely Easter Island or Rapanui in the east, and from the high volcanic islands of Hawaii in the north away down to New Zealand and the Chatham Islands, the Maori people of this country number between forty-seven and forty-eight thousand, or more than one- fourtli of the population of Polynesia. The Samoans number about 38,000, and are in point of native purity of blood stronger than the Hawaiians, who though nominally 39,000 in population, have intermarried with whites, Chinese, and Japanese to such an extent that they are more than lialf-alien in breed. In French Oceania (including Tahiti and the other islands of the Society Group, the Marquesas, the Paumotu or Low Archipelago, and Mangareva or the Gambier Group) there is a native population of 25,000; the language of these Islanders, particularly the Mangareva people, closely resembles Maori. In Tonga, the Friendly Islands, there are about 18,000 natives, having their own King and Parliament, under a British Protectorate. The population of the Cook and other islands annexed to the British Crown, and governed from New Zealand, is between 12,000 and 13,000; the most populous of these islands is Niue, the Savage Island of Captain Cook, with 4,500 inhabitants; the others in order of importance are Rarotonga, 12 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND Mangaia, Aitutaki, Atiu, and Mauke, of the Cook Group, and the isolated atolls of Penrhyn (Mangarongaro), ATanihiki, Rakahanga, and Pukapnka (Danger Island). The natives of most of these little tropic dependencies of New Zealand closely resemble our Maoris in colour, physique, language and customs ; the exception is Niue, whose people approximate more to the Tongan type, which appears in ages past to have received a consider¬ able admixture of the Western or Melanesian element. The origin of the name Maori has been much debated by our Polynesian philologists. The word Maori as a race-name is used chiefly by the New Zealanders and the Cook Islanders, and to a lesser extent by the Hawaiians, who have referred to themselves as Maoli. Literally it means “indigenous,” as applied to trees, birds, etc., and “fresh” as applied to water, i.e., “ wai-maori11 ; in contradistinction to (i icai-tai,11 salt-water. My old friend Mr. Charles E. Nelson, a remarkable linguist, and one of the best of Maori scholars, a man who delighted in tracking a Maori name or word back through its various Hawaiikis to its original birth-place, held that “Maori” as a generic appellative was of Cushite origin. He considered it was derived from the Hebrew word »iaor , or aor , meaning “light,” and that the remote Asiatic forefathers of the Polynesians so called them¬ selves, just as the gipsies of Arabia bore the name Nawar Irom nur, also light; as the Japanese named their chief island Nippon, the Land of the Rising Sun, and the Incas of America called themselves the Children of the Sun. The ancient Greeks, too, were the Hellenes, the children ol Helios, the Sun. A New Zealand native, speaking of the aboriginal people of another country, will refer to * hem as “ nga Maori o irra ichenua ,” “the inhabitants of I hat land. Idle deities and ancestral spirits of his race he will speak ol as \"'Aina Maori.11 Maori, therefore, is used both as a substantive, as in i(nga Maori o tcra a henna, and as an adjective. I sually in specifically referring1 to his race a New Zealander will make use of the expression “m/u tangata Maori ,” meaning the Maori Till', MAOKI : PAST AND PRKSKNT 13 people, or “/c iwi Maori,\" the Maori nation. Edward Tregear, in his Maori-Polvnesian Dictionary, gives Maori as signifying “indigenous, not foreign, native,” in Tahiti, the Marquesas, tin* Paninotn Archipelago, and the (lanil)ier Islands ( Mangareva ) ; in the last-named Eastern Pacific (ironp, where tin* pure Maori language is spoken, it also denotes “one who belongs to the Polynesian race” and “royal.” Then away to the North of the Equator, in Hawaii, we have the word again, in its variant form of maoli, with precisely the same meaning as in the islands of French Oceania and New Zealand. But in very few places outside New Zealand does it appear to be used as a racial designation. If the word Maori as a race-name really came from the South Asiatic fatherland of the Polynesians, it has been dropped as an ethnic title by most of the branches of I the Polynesian stock. By purchase and by conquest the lands owned by the Maori have been reduced since 1840 to something a little under seven and a-half million acres. The total area of the islands of New Zealand is about sixty-six million i acres. When Briton and Maori joined hands in the Treaty of Waitangi sixty-nine years ago, the British Crown guaranteed to the aboriginal inhabitants their title to the whole of their lands. Whatever unfortunate quarrels, official blunders, wars, there have been since the chieftains of the North met Governor Hobson on the beach of Waitangi and signed allegiance to the White 1 Queen, the broad principles involved in that Treaty have nevertheless been generally recognised by Europeans as binding and inviolable; and taking it altogether the Maoris have not been badly treated with respect to their landed possessions. Sharp war there lias been, followed ; by confiscation of lands, and many hundreds of thousands of acres of the best Maori land were taken by right of conquest. The law of the strong arm, the ringa-haha as the Maori has it, he could well understand, if he could not quite appreciate its justice. But the great bulk of the Maori lands were alienated by peaceful 14 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND purchase — often for absurdly inadequate considerations, judged in the light of to-day; vast areas were paid for chiefly in muskets, kegs of gunpowder, cases of hatchets, bales of prints, boxes of fish-hooks, jew’s-liarps, and so on. Yet to the savage those were treasures of vast value; and he did not make such bad bargains after all - — for himself; it is his descendants who suffer. The Maori, like his average pakeha cousin, did not give much thought to posterity. But if the Maori has been on the whole treated with honourable consideration by the white colonist, the white has much to thank the Maori for. It was the grandfathers of the present Maori who welcomed and kindly treated the pakeha when the latter were very small fry indeed, a weak handful of coast- settlers and traders as compared with the warlike numerous people of the soil. Had Tamati AYaka Nene and Patuone and Te AYherowliero and other great chiefs of the early days been endowed with the priestly gift of Matakite, the second sight, and had “dipped into the future” a few years, and beheld their people a mere remnant beside the swarming pakeha, their reception of the first British Governor and his Treaty might have been very different indeed. Our security and our development as a white community in the Southern Seas were due to the Maoris of 1840 in a far greater measure than the pakeha colonist acknowledges — if indeed the average pakeha of to-day cares or knows anything about it. The present generation of white New Zealander is too often ignorant of bis national history, too often knows little of the circumstances that led to his own presence here, and in bis ignorance presumes to look upon the Maori, who clings with affection to the remnant of his land, as a cumberer of the earth. The Maori would probably have been treated with as little consideration as the Australian black, had he not bet'ii well able to maintain bis own rights and dignity. Ilis quick intelligence enabled him to recognise the Till', MAOKI : PAST AND PUKSKNT 15 immense material advantage <>f accepting the white man as a eo-settler and a friend; but lie was constitutionally short in the temper, as quick to take offence and pick a quarrel as any Scottish Highland chief or any Spanish hidalgo, and always ready to enforce with gun and tomahawk his own peculiar way ol looking at a racial problem. And he had no cringing humilit\\ ; he despised the diffident man; he feared no one; Ik* con¬ sidered himself quite as good as, and generally far better than, the pakehn, particularly in all the arts of war. 1 he Maori will no more descend to the social level of a Hindu coolie or a Japanese ricksha man or a Zulu house- servant than the Samoan will become a plantation- labourer; that is for the iiri taurekareka , the slave races. His whole plane of culture, in his savage state, was relatively high; and his senses of dignity and of humour — two qualities that do not always go together — were quick and keen. We can hardly imagine a Maori rangatira allowing a white Governor to decorate him patronisingly with a tin name-plate, and christen him “King Billy. ” Whatever advantages civilisation may have conferred on the Maori, there is no doubt that his physique has deteriorated. Speaking generally, the race has grown flabbier, more susceptible to disease, since the white man came. Many Maoris are too obese to be healthy; but then we can say exactly the same of the pakeha. Every Maori in the savage old days was an athlete, always iu training. He needed no calisthenics, no dumb-bells, no punching-balls to keep him in trim; for he had his canoe¬ ing and his labour with axe and adze to develop his muscles of the shoulders and hack and chest; his forest hunting expeditions, his daily climbing to and from his hill-pa, his often-practised war-dance and his haka, to make him agile and hard-limbed, sound in wind and tireless of leg. The ten years’ war of 1860-70, while a vast misfortune in other ways, at least revived the half- forgotten military exercises of savagedom that helped to keep the Maori in perfect physical trim, and that were 16 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND the life and soul of the old generation. The peaceful farmer and trader, the village lay-reader, tore off all vestiges of civilisation with their trousers, and leaped into the wild action of the peruperu with a joy and fire that were all the greater because so long repressed. Every Maori was a soldier by instinct and by training, like the Highlander of old. It is hardly reasonable to suppose that the modern Maori has lost this instinct; the spirit of soldiering is in his blood, and given proper training the thousands of young natives in the land would be a splendid auxiliary to the white forces in time of war. Photo bp II'. Prattle, Auckland, 1SK)6. A Waikato Canoe Crew. Certain of the Maori tribes seem, because of their •environment, to have escaped that general physical slackness which in most cases follows the loss of a definite object in life, such as war. The people who live along flu* banks of the Lower Waikato River are often of splendid physical development, the result of their continual exercise with the canoe-paddle. The women arc as good canoeists as the men, and many of them are of .J nnoesque figure, without the disfigurement of superfluous flesh. The mountaineers of the Urewera country, allhough a small-built race as a rule, have no superiors as hard-working, last-travelling buslnnen, with a tireless capacity for arduous hill-work. They have had for generations to wrest their living from a Till'.

Perhaps the coming generation of Prewera highland people will l><* less hardy, for roads have been out through the country, and every man lias a horse of a kind, a sturdy mountain pony. But the average man, and woman, too, is a won¬ derfully good bush-traveller and tracker and swag- carrier as compared with the dwellers in the open country. I feel tired yet when I think of my old Hauhau friend Paitini and our tramp across the Huiarau mountains from Ruatahuna toM aikaremoana some twelve years ago. Paitini was nearly sixty, and no Hercules in size or muscle; but he loped along that rough bush track, up hill and down, with the easy, noiseless, seemingly effortless pace of a Red Indian, carrying a good-sized swag, a pace that left his pakeha companion toiling hard behind him as if he were in a foot-race. Yet Paitini seemed to be only taking a quiet stroll through the bush. It was his home from childhood, that sombre twilight forest, with its roaring creeks and its rocky precipices; he had carried gun and tomahawk all over it in the Hauhau wars, and had snared and speared the forest- birds in its remotest depths. He was a forester and a mountaineer by heredity; and he was hard as iron by continual usage of those hard forest-trails. Perhaps, too, the short-kilted shawl costume had something to do with it; for the old man travelled most of the way in his national rig, the best for this land of bush and creek; like Kipling’s Gunga Din: “ The uniform ’e wore Was nothin’ much before An’ rather less than ’arf o’ that be’ind. ” Work and a healthily occupied mind, an object in life, are what the Maori requires, if he is to live and increase in the land. The Urewera people, though a small tribe, have not suffered so much as some other divisions of the Maori race from the coming of the pakeha, because their B 18 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND mountains isolated them until quite recent years, and their food gave more trouble to secure. They had little time to waste in idleness. Now that they are tasting the sweet things of the outer world — many Ureweras go round shearing for the white settlers and earn large cheques annually, and are even taking to dairying, and making money at it — they will perhaps begin to look down with scorn upon their old ways. Certainly there are some things they could with advantage abandon; hut their general mode of life, hard as it was, suited them, kept their bodies strong, and their intellects keen. Of those tribes which have made more progress in civilisation, probably the most energetic and profitably occupied are the Ngati-Porou and their kindred ha pus, between Gisborne and the East Cape. The Ngati-Porou own and manage several large sheep-runs, with all the latest European plant and improvements ; these slieep-farms are conducted on the co-operative principle — a wise concession to the old communistic habits of the race — and all the brains and muscle employed are Maori. All the villages and stations of the tribe are connected by telephone; the cost of construction was borne entirely by the Maoris. These enterprising people, led by Apirana Ngata and other educated chiefs of the young generation, are prospering materially, are increasing numerically, and are giving their more conservative or less fortunately captained countrymen a useful lesson m life; they are showing them that it is possible, while preserving their pride of race and of ancestral tradition, to develop on certain lines on equal terms with their white neighbours. The life on the land, the healthy life of the agricul¬ turist and the pastoralist, is the life for the Maori. Gifted individuals, the Pomares, the Ngatas, the Ivangih irons ol the race, will always rise, as they have liseu, 1<> high official and professional honour and even outstrip New Zealanders of European birth and greater opportunities. But the Maori people, if they are to live, must dwell on their ancestral lands and win their bread THE MAORI: PAST AND PRESENT ID from those lands with the energy and industry that their forefathers brought to hear on every phase of life, from hewing out a eanoe to planning and executing a campaign. ******* The Maori character strangely blends souk1 apparently incongruous qualities. In some respects intensely practical and matter-of-fact, and keenly alive to his own material interests, he is also intensely poetical. lie is permeated with the poetic sense, and with the super¬ natural. A Maori’s soul finds natural relief in song, particularly in time of sorrow and bereavement. In this lie resembles the Scottish Highlander and the Irish peasant. No Maori speech is considered complete without a chanted waiatu to emphasise it, a poetic peroration. His poetry, so full of simile and metaphor and expressive image, gathered from the wild nature with which he lived so intimately, or from the moving episodes of his life and the deeds ot his ancestors, is very beautiful and very touching even when judged by the standard of the cultured European. His love of his land and home impressed itself deep on his language and his poetry; and his very place-names often reflect the soul of the bard. Here, as Robert Louis Stevenson lias written of that other home ot the Maori, Tahiti— “Cape and village and river, and vale and mountain above, Each had a name in the land for men to remember and love; And never the name of a place but lo! a song in its praise: Ancient and unforgotten, songs of the earlier days.” Kind in domestic life, the Maori lavished affection on his children; many beautiful chants heard to-day were originally composed as oriori, or lullaby-songs, and laments for children. But this race of bards was also a race fierce and pitiless in war. The Maori seldom spared a foe; he slaughtered indiscriminately, unless he required women or slaves or both, then he spared such as he required. He was a horrible cannibal, and boasted of it; and even as late as the Taranaki War of 1869 20 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND human flesli was eaten in sacrificial war-rite. A few of the old kai-tangata, the man-eaters, are still alive, the last of the anthropophagi. The Maori’s moral make-up, indeed, like that of every race, held much that was admirable and much that was the reverse ; of which let the stories that follow tell. Chapter 1 1 I. POPULATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF TRIBES. The last New Zealand census, taken in DOG, showed the total Maori population to be 47,731 persons, an increase of 4,588 persons as compared with the previous census, that of 1901. The first native census was taken in the year 1874, but in 186/ , and again in 1871, the various officers residing in native districts had been instructed to furnish estimates of the number of Maoris in their respective districts. These estimates were, however, merely approximate, and are known to have been imperfect. Since 1874 a census of the native population has been taken coincidently with the European census. The following table shows the population at the census years Persons. Persons. 1867 (approximate 1881 . . 44,097 estimate) . . 38,540 1886 . . 41,969 1871 (approximate 1891 . . 41,993 estimate) . . 37,502 1896 . . 39,854 1874 (first census) 45,470 1901 . . 43,143 1878 . . 43,595 1906 . . 47,731 Of the fluctuations exhibited in the above table the Under-Secretary for Native Affairs, Judge H. F. Edger, remarked in his memorandum to the Native Minister, in laying the census before him, that “they cannot be regarded as normal, and conclusions deduced from the figures must be regarded to a large extent as conjectural. It was doubted whether the large decrease shown by the census of 1896 was a real decrease, or merely due to the non-inclusion of a number of natives either by accident •21 90 t-J _ _ THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND or through refusals to give proper information to the sub-enumerators. Similarly, the large increase shown by the present census may in part be attributed to more favourable circumstances permitting a closer enumera¬ tion to be made on this occasion.” Taking all the circumstances into consideration, it is evident that the decay of the race has at last been stayed. The 1906 census is probably the most reliable one that has yet been taken by the Government. A significant and pleasing feature is the increase in the number of children since the 1901 census. The 1906 census showed the number of persons under the age of fifteen years to be 18,417, whereas in 1901 it was 16,082; there was thus an increase of 2,395 during the five years. rl hat there is a tendency to gradual absorption in the European population is undoubted. The proportion of half-castes is increasing. The last census showed that in the five years since 1901 the number of half-castes living with the Maori tribes had increased by 815. The total number of half-castes living as members of Maori tribes was 3,938. Besides these there were 2,578 half- castes returned as “living as Europeans,” thus giving a total of 6,516 persons of mixed European and Maori blood. There were 211 Maori wives living with European husbands. By far the greater portion of the Maori population is in the North Island, which has 44,962, as against 2,256 in the South Island, and 100 in Stewart Island, besides 1 1 - Maori and 30 Moriori people living in the Chatham Islands. This tiny remnant of the ancient and once numerous Moriori aborigines is being reduced year by year; there are at the present time not more than half-a- dozen living persons of pure Moriori blood. I he proportions of the sexes as revealed bv the 1906 census were 23,387 males and 20,406 females of pun Maori blood, besides 2,151 male and 1,787 female half castes living as members of Maori tribes. This excess ol males over females is not a good feature, and unti the relative proportions are reversed, or at any rati POPULATION AND D1STU I BUT ION OF TKIBK8 23 equalised, the pernmnent preservation ot the race cannot be regarded as assured. ^ The geographical distribution of the Maori people lias naturally been influenced very largely by climate and other natural factors. The warm and pleasant North Auckland country, the Waikato, the vicinity of the Rotorua Thermal Springs, the shores ot the Bay ol plenty and the fruitful coastlands about the Hast < ape and down to Hawke’s Bay hold the most numerous of the Maori tribes. The northern part ot the Auckland province has probably always been the most thickly populated of all districts. Here the Maori found con¬ ditions of climate, soil, and general surroundings more nearly approaching those of his ancient Oceanic homes than those of the more southern parts of New Zealand Here the introduced tropic esculents, the kwmarci and faro, grew luxuriantly, seldom injured by frosts, and other foods of land and sea were in the greatest abundance, while the mildness and geniality oi the climate permitted of a life in the open all the yeai lound with little clothing. There were no winters of severe frost and snow such as were familiar to the mountaineers of the Urewera country or the tribes of the South Island. The almost incredible numbers and dimensions of the old terraced and trenched liill-forts or i oas which stud the Auckland district from the Tamaki isthmus to the far North are memorials of the great numbers as well as the wonderful patience, industry, and military , engineering skill of the ancient people. E\\en to-da\\ ve find that the Ngapuhi, Rarawa and allied tribes of North Auckland are stronger numerically than their more southern cousins. In the Mangonui county , the most northern in the Dominion, there were at last census 2,053 Maoris, in Hokianga county 2,769, and in the Bay of Islands 2,571. Adding to these figures those of the Whangaroa, Hobson, Otamatea, Whangarei, Rodney, and Waitemata and Eden counties and the adjacent islands of the Hauraki Gulf, we find that the total Maori population of the Auckland province north of the 24 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND / Tamaki the ancient border-line between the northern and the Waikato and other southern tribes — is 11,029 persons, or nearly one-fourth of the entire Maori people. ^ To the south, the Waikato and allied tribes of Tamm stock, who lost the greater part of their lands bv confiscation after the Waikato War of 1863-64, occupy the western side of the Waikato River, that broad and beautiful stream flowing for two hundred miles through the heart of the Island, fed by the snows of Ruapehu and the huge reservoir of Lake Taupo. In the Manukau, \\\\ aikato, A\\ aipa, Raglan, and Kawhia counties there are •j,958 natives, and in the large district known as the ‘ ‘ King Country, extending from Kawhia Harbour and the basin of the Waipa down south to the upper waters ot the W lianganui and to the northern part of Taranaki province, there are 2,342, most of whom are members of that famous old warrior clan the Ngati-Maniapoto and the neighbouring clans of the Ngati-Raukawa and Ngati- 1 uwharetoa. On the eastern coast of the Auckland province, ^ the fertile country sloping down to the shores ot the well-named Bay of Plenty holds a numerous and generally prosperous population, ' the ti'hes of the Ngaiterangi, the Ngati-Pikiao and Ngati- Rangitiln sections of the great Aiwa tribe, Ngati-Awa vvhakatohea, etc., numbering in ail in the Tauranga \\\\ hakatane and Opotlki census districts 5,(i!)l persons.’ nl. ind i om hakatane and Opotiki are the Urewera mountain-people.

Tn Hawke’s Bay and the great stretch of country extending from the populous valley of the Wairoa to the Lower Wairarapa, the territory of the Ngati-Kahungnnu tribe, there is a numerous popu¬ lation, and many of the tribes-people are wealthy land- owners and sheep-farmers; the total native population of this N gati -Kaliungunu country is 5,255. On the western side of the Island south of Cape Egmont the population is not quite so numerous. lu Taranaki, the province of the fiercest of the native wars against the whites — the Taranaki campaigns lasted with little intermission from 1860 to 1869 — there are 3,090 natives, belonging chiefly to the Atiawa, Taranaki, Ngati-Ruanui, and Nga-Rauru tribes, most of whom were until lately the disciples of the celebrated prophet Te Wliiti, and the most inimical of all Maoris to the progressive and aggressive European. Of the other West Coast tribes the most important is the Whanganui, inhabiting many villages on the banks of the great river from which they take their name, from Putiki-wliara-nui at the mouth up to Pipiriki and the vicinity, a race of famous warriors and canoe-men; they number now in the Whanganui county 782 people. About the banks of the Waitotara River, just to the north of the Whanganui, there are 348 natives allied partly to Whanganui and partly to Taranaki. In the Ilorowhenua county, further south, the low-lying fertile belt of country near the sea through which the Manawatu section of the Main Trunk Railway runs, there were 1,015 people at last census; these belong to the Ngati-Apa, Muaupoko, and Ngati-Toa tribes, Otaki is the headquarters of the Ngati-Toa, the descendants of the great Rauparaka’ s tribe of cannibal conquerors who migrated here from Kawliia more than eighty years ago and wrested these coastlands and Ka pit i Island from Ihe Muaupoko and Rangitane tribes. Crossing Cook Strait — the Maori “Sea of Raukawa” to the wonderfully dovetailed coastline of the South Island, we have a much sparser Maori population. The POPUI.ATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF 'BRIBES 'll tribes are niueli more scattered and are but luorehu, mere remnants of their olden strength. A few villages of the Ngati Kuia, Rangitane, Ngati-Awa, Ngati-Rarua, etc., are to be found here and there in the sheltered inlets ot the Marlborough Sounds and the northern shores of Nelson province; the Marlborough and Nelson h<tpn s or sections of tribes number only 137. Down the wild West Coast, the Maori Poutini, the land of greenstone, there are a very few hamlets, containing at the 1 1)0(5 census onl v 44 people; one of these villages is on the banks of the famous greenstone-bearing river Aralmra, and another is far down the torrent-split littoral of West land, at Makawhio, or Jacob’s River, where a few people of the Ngati-Mahaki hcipu live a very lonely and remote bush life. Crossing the great Alpine range and travelling down the Canterbury Plains to the eastern seaboard, we find here and there the people of the Ngai- Tahu tribe, whom the first white settlers found in possession of the whole country, and from whom they purchased vast tracts of prairie land for trifling con¬ siderations in trade-goods and money. The principal northern village of the Ngai-Talra is Tuahiwi, close to the site of the celebrated old fortified town Kaiapohia, a few miles from Christchurch. The other principal kaikas or villages of the tribe are those at Tenmka (properly Te Umu-kaha), Taumutu, Little River, Akaroa, and Waihao in the Canterbury province; Puketiraki, Otago Heads, and the Taieri River in Otago province; and Riverton and Oraka (Colac Bay) in Southland. Tn Otago and Southland the Ngai-Tahu blood has an admixture of the ancient Ngati-Mamoe, vanished as a clan and absorbed (very literally in one sense) by the Ngai-Tahu conquerors. The Ngai-Tahu tribe, with its blending of the olden Ngati-Mamoe and Waitalia strains, numbers in all about two thousand souls, scattered over hundreds of miles of country, their little settlements mere lonely dots amongst the farms and villages of the white man. 28 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND The proportion of half-castes to pure-bred Maoris varies considerably in the various large tribes. In the Waiapn county, tlie district around the East Cape, the Ngati-Porou and contiguous tribes have 246 lialf-castes in a total population of 2,611, or about ten per cent. In the Waitomo county, in the centre of the King Country, there are 130 half-castes of the Ngati-Maniapoto tribe, which numbers in this district 1,075 persons: the pro¬ portion of part-whites here is about one in every eight natives. In the Whanganui district the strain of pakelia blood is greater; out of 782 natives 115 are half-castes, or something over one in every seven. In the South Island, where in the early days the white whalers, sealers and traders intermarried freely with the Maoris, the strain of white blood is much more pronounced. White greatly predominates in Canterbury at any rate, and it will soon be difficult to find a pure-blooded Maori there. Out of the 2,266 people of the native race returned in 1906 as living in the South Island and Stewart Island, 865 were lialf-castes (451 males and 414 females).

It was a formula that summaiised the Maori’s idea of the migration of his ancestors, from one Tawhiti or Hawaiiki to another across the mysterious Pacific. The traditions of the last migration, that from Tahiti and Raiatea and Rarotonga, are widely diffused and are well authenticated; and Maori tribal historians have preserved in minute detail, handed down from tohunga father to son through many generations, the stories of the dissensions amongst the people in these last Hawaiikis, the building of the canoes, with the attendant ceremonies and priestly invocations, and the great voyage across the Ocean of Kiwa to these shores. But beyond that all is vague, and it is to the white tohunga that we must go for the piecing together of the earlier migrations of this far-travelled people. In Maori tradition numerous place-names besides those mentioned above are preserved as those of ancient -Compare this with the following extract from a poetical address presented recently to the lion. James Carroll. Native Minister, by the Maoris of the Ngati-Kahungunu and other tribes of “Takitimu” descent: — “Turn once again your face to the shadowy land from which we came, to the homes of our ancestors far away, to Great-Hawaiiki, to Long- Hawaiiki, to Hawaiiki-of-Great-Distanee, to the Hono-i-Wairua (the Place of Spirits), the land where man was formed from the earth by Great-Tane- of-the-Sky, and had life first breathed into him. So begin our genealogies. ’ ’ •29 30 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND homes; of these are Waeroti, Waerota — to be heard to this day in fomara-planting chants — Mataora, Wawau, Nukuroa, Rangiatea, and other places, and even mountains, such as Idiknrangi, and rivers, such as Piko- piko-i-wliiti. But as to where these places were, the Maori is unable to tell ns ; and it is left to the sciences of ethnology and philology to trace them. Of Waeroti and Waerota we are told by the Maoris that they were the islands whence they obtained the kwnara, the sweet potato. As to such localities as Wawau and Hikurangi, there are several places bearing those names in the Pacific Islands, hut they must lie names of very great antiquity, going hack to the remote Asiatic lands. The place-name Wawau we can trace back westwards through the Pacific; it is a sign-post on the ocean-rovers’ ancient track. In the Society Islands we find it first; the ancient name of the beautiful fantastically-pinnacled isle Porapora, or Borobora, is Vavau; Mr. Percy Smith says he has little doubt that it was from this island that the ancestors of the Ngati-Whatua tribe of Kaipara came to New Zealand in their canoe the “Mahuhu.” Sailing westwards, there is Vavau (Maori, Wawau), one of the principal islands of the Tonga group. Then, Fornander, the great Polynesian student, considers that Babao, the ancient name of Coupang, Isle of Timor, in the East Indies, and probably the name of the whole island before the Malays conquered and settled it. is identical with Vavau or Wawau. Further back still it goes, and it is most probably a very ancient one referring to one of the old Continental home-lands, perhaps India, or the shores of the Persian Gulf. That the Maori-Polynesian is a branch, though a distant one, of the Caucasian race is now generally accepted by scientific investigators. The evidence in support of this, ethnic, philological, and anthro¬ pological, is so strong that the European need no longer hesitate to claim (lie Maori as his long-severed kinsman. The opinions of ethnologists differ as to when and where the liiving-off began: as to when the ancestors of the OK1GIN OK THE MAORI 31 tli<> Maori began their great eastward migration, and as to when* they first ventured on the great waters and became navigators and seamen. Some go no lnrther back westwards than India; but all the evidence of feature and language and custom seems to point to a more distant Hawaiiki than this. Custom is more persistent than language, and some ot the commonest habits and customs of the race are identical with those that have been observed amongst seafaring peoples on the coast of Arabia, and on the shores ot the Red Sea. Certainly there seems to be adequate evidence to justity us in arriving at these general conclusions: that it was on or near the shores ot the Persian Cult and ot Arabia that the ancestors of the Maori-Polynesian lived; that they had racial affinities with the ancient Chaldeans, from whom they gained most of their astronomical know¬ ledge; that they also were blood relations of the Phoenicians, who were the most adventurous of ancient mariners; that they had affinity with the Egyptians, some of whose religious traditions they absorbed. Professor A. TT. Keane is one of the leading ethnolo¬ gists who are convinced of the Caucasian origin of the Polynesians. In his “Man, Past and Present,” he says that the Eastern Polynesians (those living in the groups east of Fiji, namely, Tonga, Samoa, Tahiti, Hawaii, New Zealand, etc.) “constitute the purest and most interesting section of the Caucasian Indonesians. Their claim to belong to this connection can no longer be seriously questioned. There have been from the remotest times both a dolicho and a brachy section of the Caucasic division. To the former belong our Eastern Polynesians, who are mostly long heads with remarkably regular features, often of a distinctly European stamp, and other characteristics of a pronouncedly Caucasian type. The hair is mostly black and straight, but also wavy, though never frizzly or even kinky. The colour also is of a light brown compared to cinnamon or cafe-au-lait, and sometimes approaching an almost white shade, 32 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND while the tall stature, averaging 5ft. llin. or 6ft., slightly exceeds that of several European groups in Sweden, Norway, North Britain, and Ireland.” “But the language, it is objected,” Professor Keane goes on to say, “is not Aryan or European. No doubt this is so, but Caucasic people of the New Stone Age spread over North Africa, Europe, and Asia and most of them spoke non-Aryan idioms, as we see very well from the Hamitieo-Semitic, and the allied Basque blends those of the Caucasus and Yagnobi, which in its remarkable survival may be called the ‘Basque of Central Asia.’ ” Without going deeply into the vast mass of evidence available on this subject, there are many superficial links between the Polynesian and the Old-World peoples who developed civilisations on the plains of Southern Asia, the peoples who sprang from common Caucasic stock. In physical appearance many points of resemblance can be detected between the Maori and the Arabs and their neighbours; and in that singular survival the Urukehu, the fair-haired type to be seen in some Maori villages in the interior, we have the pure Caucasian. There is a remarkable Hebraic likeness in many a Maori face, particularly amongst the men of the Arawa tribe. One old Arawa chief in particular, Araki te Pohu, (see page 33) impressed me as of strangely Jewish appearance; he had a Semitic cast of features, with the strong hooked nose which the Maori calls ihu-kcika, or “parrot-beak,” and with his fine mystic eye and his white beard he might have sat for a picture of some ancient Jewish patriarch, had it not been for the tattoo- marks on his nose and cheeks. The law of tupu with its myriad ramifications suggests the old Hebrew quaran¬ tines and prohibitions as detailed in Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Between the ancient Egyptians and the Maori there are some singularly strong like¬ nesses. The heads on the large whare-whakairo or carved houses in Maori villages have often quite an THE ORIGIN OF THE MAORI 33 Egyptian and Sphinx-like gaze out into space. I have seen a very old canoe-prow from the West Coast ol the South Island carved in the semblance of a human face which was most remarkably like the Egyptian type of face as depicted in statues in the Lower Valley of the Nile. In ancient Egypt, too, as has often been noted, we have the name of the sun-god, Ra, which is that of the sun throughout Polynesia and New Zealand, and probably the most widely spread of all names of deified forces of nature. Other Maori names of divinities, such as Maui, are appar¬ ently of Egyptian or Semitic origin. Such a widely- travelled observer as C. E. Nelson was able to cite some strong anal¬ ogies between the Maoris and the people of the south coast of Arabia, particularly in cer¬ tain customs such as the cooking of food by steaming in earth-ovens — the Maori hdngi, the drying of sharks for food by splitting them and hanging them up on stages in the sun; the blue lip and chin tattooing of the women. Nelson, in his sailoring youth, once served in an Arab dhow engaged in trading from Quiloa up tlie African coast to the Red Sea; and amongst the wild sea-loving Arabs on the coast near Muscat he observed customs which he was long years afterwards surprised to find obtaining universally amongst the Maoris.

The late Arakite Pohu, of Rotorua- C 34 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND The Semitic peoples, the Egyptian and Arab, all no doubt influenced the remote ancestral parent-race, the proto-Maori, and gave it some of its distinguishing physical, features, some of its customs and social laws, some of its deities. As to the period at which the ancestors of the Poly¬ nesians began their great heke, their migration eastwards from the shores of south-western Asia to India and Indonesia, and finally to the Pacific, we have no data that will enable us to fix even an approximate date. Mr. S. Percy Smith, whose excellent little book “Hawaiiki” is recognised as the standard work on the subject, does not carry his investigations further back than India. He agrees with Mr. J. H. Logan that the Polynesians formed part of the very ancient “Gangetic Race,” which had been in India from remote antiquity, but which had been at various periods modified by the intrusion oi Semitic, Tibetan and other races. Mr. Smith concludes, from a mass of most interesting Raro- tongan traditional as well as scientific evidence which he cites, that the Polynesian ancestors were living in a land known as Atia-te-varinga-nui, which he holds is India, about 450 b.c., when they were ruled over by a great king or supreme chief named Tu-te-Rangi-marama ; that not long before the beginning of the Christian era they began to migrate to the islands of the East Indies, and settled in Java, thence gradually moving eastwards into the Pacific. Professor . Macmillan Brown’s theory, as set out in his book “Maori and Polynesian,” is that there was in pahrolithic times a great eastward migration of a section of the Caucasian race, from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea; it divided into two streams, one passing through Siberia to the East Coast of Asia and Japan (whence some found their way to Alaska) thence to the Philippines, Lad rones, Carolines, and other Western Pacific Groups and eventually to Samoa; the other from India to Indonesia (where the first stream was found already in occupation), and thence from island to island T 1 1 K OKKilN OF TIIF. MAOIU nff .50 eastwards into the Pacific. The second stream, the Professor believes, entered the Pacific long after the first but before the metals came into common use, hence the neolithic stage in which the white man found the Maori-Polvnesian. Such broadly is Professor Macmillan Brown’s theory, expanded fascinatingly in his book. To the present writer it seems reasonable to suppose that right from the start the eastward movement of the migrants was for the most part by sea; from t lie shores of Arabia and the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf across the Indian Ocean to India, thence by the island stages upon which most students are agreed. The ocean, with which the Arabs and their kin were familiar, offered an unobstructed highway to the East, whereas by land there were the enormous difficulties and dangers of rugged mountain country, deserts, hunger and thirst, and hostile tribes. The coastal people of South-Western Asia were from ancient times navigators with a know¬ ledge of the stars; they, and probably the early Egyptians, were amongst the earliest sailors. They coasted down the eastern shores of the African Continent at any rate as far as the Zambesi, and they also visited and probably partly colonised Madagascar; this would account for the resemblances between the Maori- Polvnesian language and the Malagasy. That these proto-Maoris were fearless and enter¬ prising seafarers is evident; they would have little hesitation in pushing out across the ocean Indiawards. But they could hug the coast if they wished, and probably did so, landing here and there along the shores of Persia and Baluchistan, and making their way along the long coastline of India. No doubt generations would be occupied in such a migration, and the sojourn in India might extend over centuries. The prevailing winds, an all-important condition to a sea-travelling people, would be favourable to the migration eastwards. The south¬ west monsoon would take them across the Arabian Sea 36 THE MAORIS OF NEW ZEALAND to India and again across tlie Bay of Bengal to Indonesia. In Sumatra they probably remained for some centuries; several eminent Polynesian scholars look upon Sumatra as one of the great Tawhitis or Hawaiikis of the race. Java and Borneo were later Hawaiikis. Then the north¬ west monsoon, ranging ten degrees each side of the Equator, would carry them on to Ceram, G-ilolo, and other islands of the Molucca Archipelago, thence to the great island of New Guinea, and so fairly on into the Western Pacific. These stages in the migration of the race would not be covered quickly; they would probably occupy hundreds of years ; and in each stopping place the people would probably encounter aboriginal tribes, who would in one way or another leave their impress on the new¬ comers, in a partial blending of blood and in traditions and folk-story; there would too be preserved, as we shall see, memories of the animals of those lands. The old theory of Polynesian writers that the Maori were, in part at any rate, descended from the Malays, is now considered untenable. That the ancestors of the Maori occupied those parts of the East Indies now peopled by Malays is undoubted, but they found no Malay element there then; otherwise the Malay would exhibit itself to-day in the racial type. The Maori is not Malay in feature or in tongue. That the Polynesians found some earlier inhabitants already in possession in Sumatra, Java, Borneo and other stages on this great heke towards the rising sun is no doubt a fact; it was here probably that they first met the negroid type that is to some extent still to be recognised in certain Maori tribes. The Malays, who were a Mongoloid race, came later, alter our Maori ancestors had passed on towards the Pacific — probably, however, leaving some of their people settled in the land, afterwards to amalgamate with the Mongol immigrants from the nor ’-west. That the fair-haired lighter-complexioned strain in the Maori came with them from Asiatic shores there is THE ORIGIN OK THE MAORI 37 little doubt. 11 is not always easy now to distinguish a pure fair-haired urukehu, so widely spread is European blood. But in the Urewera country, on the head-waters of the Wanganui River, and certain other parts of the interior that have been comparatively isolated until recent years, the urukehu (literally “red-hair”) can still be seen as in the olden days, undeniably pure Maori, and with a dull golden tinge in the hair that a careful observer can clearly separate from that ot the halt- bloods. As far back as 1772 Crozet, the French navigator, who came to the Bay of Islands with Marion du Fresno’s expedition, noted this and other Caucasic characteristics of the race. Describing the Ngapuhi people whose stockaded villages dotted the coast-line, he says: “Their colour is, generally speaking, like the people of Southern Europe.” Some of the men were as white as the French sailors, and there was a young girl of fifteen or sixteen “as white as our French women.” Crozet saw several people “with red hair.” But while noting the numbers of the tall fair-skinned straight-haired people with little beard (no doubt the hair had been eradicated in the usual way with shell tweezers), and noting also the somewhat yellowish complexion of some, he recorded the presence of the more Melanesian type, shorter in stature, “slightly frizzled” as to hair, more swarthy and more bearded than the others, in fact more negroid¬ looking. Crozet did not know of the Western Pacific race we now call Melanesians, nor did he know anything of the history and migrations of the Maori; his testimony is, therefore, all the more valuable as a faithful observer’s record of the very evident differences of type in the Maoris seen in even the one district he visited — a district where all the ancient differences of physiognomy and other physical points have been obliterated by the pakeha blend. It is now easy to picture the eastward progress of our daring sailors through the Pacific. From one island to 38 THE MAOKIS OP NEW ZEALAND another they spread, exploring each and carefully \\\\ eighing’ its suitability as a home. They gradually vi orked southwards from the torrid equatorial latitudes, which eastwards of New Guinea did not hold many islands of great size or fitness for settlement. Touching at the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides, they leached Fiji, and made it their home for many genera¬ tions ; then they spread on to the Tonga Group and the beautiful high, well-watered and fruitful islands of Samoa. Fiji (Whiti, or Viti) and Samoa appear, from the. evidence of history, tradition, and song to have been their homes for many a generation. From Samoa as a centre they made many great canoe voyages, exploring all paits of the Pacific, north, south, east, and west, in search of new homes, new kinds of food, new adventures. What Mr. Frank Bullen remarks in “Our Heritage the of the earlj Italian and Spanish and Portuguese navigators is equally true of these still earlier and even more daring seamen, the Polynesian pioneers : “They had become so far familiar with those apparently illimitable breadths that they put forth in all confidence that they would fetch somewhere or another, and that wherever it might be it would he well worth the visiting and annexing.” That great migration eastwards through Indonesia and the thousand isles of the sea left indelible traces not only on the physical type, physiognomy, and race-liabits of the proto-Maori, but also on his legends, traditions, and folk-songs. Tlie memories of the terrible creatures of the river and the forest in India and the Fast Indies survive to-day in countless Maori stories, which have in course of time become localised in New Zealand. The legends of man-destroying reptiles, known as taniwha and ngarara, some living in the water, some on the land, evidently refer to the crocodile and the huge serpents of tropical countries through which the ancestors of our Polynesians passed in their wanderings.
