        "text": "English: from Middle English white, wit (Old English hwÄ«t âwhiteâ), hence a nickname for someone with white hair or a pale complexion. In some cases it is perhaps from a Middle English survival of the Old English personal name HwÄ«ta, a short form of names in HwÄ«t- (from hwÄ«t âwhiteâ). The name may also be topographic, referring to someone who lived by a bend or curve in a river or road (from Old English wiht âbendâ), the source of the placename of Great Whyte in Ramsey, Huntingdonshire (compare Wight ). This name is also a variant of Wight . The surname White is also very common among African Americans.\n\nIrish and Scottish: adopted for any of several Irish and Scottish Gaelic names based on bÃ¡n âwhite, fairâ (see Bain 1, McElwain ) or fionn âfairâ (see Finn 1). The English surname has been Gaelicized in Ireland as de Faoite."
