Provenance: Georges Lutfalla, editor of the modern scholarly reprint of this work, with his manuscript notes.\n\nFIRST EDITION of \"the first consistent and generally successful attempt to apply mathematical analysis to a wide range of economic problems\" (Theocaris, Early Developments in Mathematical Economics). \"With the publication in 1838 of his [Recherches] he was a third of a century ahead of Walras and Jevons and must be considered the true founder of mathematical economics\" (DSB). This work is an important forerunner to modern game theory.\n\n[Boxed with:] COURNOT. Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth. Translated by Nathaniel T. Bacon. New York, 1897. 8o. Original cloth. American edition of an English translation of the above, includes a brief bibliography of mathematical economics by Irving Fisher at end."
