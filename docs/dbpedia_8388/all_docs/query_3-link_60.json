        "text": "Used: See description\n\nDescription\n\nParis: L. Hachette et Cie,, 1863. In a handsome contemporary French binding First edition. Cournot was the first \"to visualize the general interdependence of all economic quantities and the necessity of representing this cosmos by a system of equations\" (Schumpeter, History of Economic Analysis, 1986, p. 467). In 1838 he published Recherches sur les Principes Mathématiques de la Théorie des Richesses. Perhaps because he was primarily a mathematician and his work contained technicalities to which economists had been previously unaccustomed, it went almost unnoticed until its significance was recognized by Marshall, Walras and Jevons. The present work states his theory without the mathematics and develops it into a systematic doctrine. Because in the Recherches he \"treated only questions where mathematical analysis was applicable... the product was not a complete treatise on political economy but a selection of contributions to various specific topics\" (Theocharis, Early Developments in Mathematical Economics, p. 200). In the Principes the results are united. Octavo (217 x 134 mm). Contemporary French brown quarter roan, spine lettered in gilt, compartments panelled in black, raised bands ruled in gilt, marbled paper sides and endpapers, edges sprinkled black, green cloth book marker. Bookplate of French lawyer and writer on Austro-Hungarian finance Henry Delpech (fl. 1936) to front pastedown. Extremities very lightly rubbed with a few marks to morocco, occasional foxing and pencil marks to contents, else a very good copy. Einaudi 1364; Mattioli 794; Sraffa 1122."
