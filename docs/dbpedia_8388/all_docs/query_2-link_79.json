His work on combustion, oxidation (see oxidation-reduction), and gases (especially those in air) overthrew the phlogiston doctrine, which held that a component of matter (phlogiston) was given off by a substance in the process of combustion. That theory had held sway for a century. He formulated the principle of the conservation of mass (i.e., that the weights of the reactants must add up to the weights of the products) in chemical reactions, clarified the distinction between elements and compounds, and was instrumental in devising the modern system of chemical nomenclature (naming oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon). He was among the first to use quantitative procedures in chemical investigations, and his experimental ingenuity, exact methods, and cogent reasoning, along with the resultant discoveries, revolutionized chemistry. He also worked on physical problems, especially heat, and on fermentation, respiration, and animals. Independently wealthy, he had a simultaneous career as a public servant of remarkable versatility in areas including finance, economics, agriculture, education, and social welfare. A reformer and political liberal, he was active in the French Revolution but came under increasing attack from extremists and was guillotined\n\nAntoine Baumé\n\n{i} Antoine Baume (1728-1804), French pharmacist who invented the Baumé scale\n\nAntoine Coysevox\n\nborn Sept. 29, 1640, Lyon, Fr. died Oct. 10, 1720, Paris French sculptor. In 1666 he became sculptor to Louis XIV and by 1678 was working at Versailles. He was known for his portrait busts, which show a naturalism and animation of expression that anticipates the Rococo style. He also executed decorative sculpture for the royal gardens and did much interior decoration. Coysevox exerted considerable influence on the development of French portrait sculpture in the 18th century\n\nAntoine Henri Becquerel\n\n{i} (1852-1908) French physicist, winner of the Nobel prize in Physics in 1903 (discovered radioactivity in uranium)\n\nAntoine Jean Gros\n\n{i} Baron Antoine Jean Gros (1771-1835), French painter\n\nAntoine Lavoisier\n\nborn Aug. 26, 1743, Paris, France died May 8, 1794, Paris French chemist, regarded as the father of modern chemistry.

He argued that any attempt to account for linguistic change must recognize that language is a social phenomenon. His Introduction to the Comparative Study of the Indo-European Languages (1903) explained the relationships of the Indo-European languages to each other and to their parent tongue. Meillet suggested that languages that develop farther from a centre of common origin are less disturbed by changes at the point of origin and more likely to retain archaic characteristics. He produced authoritative grammars of classical Armenian and Old Iranian and made notable contributions to Slavic studies\n\nAntoine Pevsner\n\norig. Natan Borisovich Pevzner born Jan. 18, 1886, Oryol, Russia died April 12, 1962, Paris, France Russian-born French sculptor and painter. After travels to Paris and Oslo, he returned to become a professor at Moscow's school of fine arts. He helped form the Suprematist group, and in 1920 he and his brother, Naum Gabo, issued the Realist Manifesto of Constructivism. He settled in Paris in 1923. He used zinc, brass, copper, and celluloid for his early sculptures; later he relied mainly on parallel arrays of bronze wire soldered together to form plates, which he joined to form intricate shapes\n\nAntoine Watteau\n\n{i} Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721), French painter known for his Rococo style\n\nAntoine Watteau\n\nborn Oct. 10, 1684, Valenciennes, France died July 18, 1721, Nogent-sur-Marne French painter. Son of a roof tiler in Valenciennes, he was apprenticed to a local artist. At 18 he moved to Paris, where he worked for a series of painters; one of them was a theatrical scenery painter, and much of Watteau's work consequently embraced the artifice of the theatre, particularly the commedia dell'arte and the ballet. His works typified the lyrically charming and graceful Rococo style. The greatest, his Pilgrimage to the Island of Cythera, depicts pilgrims setting out for (or departing from) the mythic island of love and was his presentation piece when he was inducted into the academy in 1717. The academicians, unable to fit him into any of the recognized categories, welcomed him as a painter of fêtes galantes (\"elegant festivities\"), an important new genre to which countless later Rococo pictures belong\n\nAntoine de Saint-Exupery\n\n{i} (1900-1944) French aviator and writer, author of \"the Little Prince\n\nAntoine- Henri Becquerel\n\nborn Dec. 15, 1852, Paris, France died Aug. 25, 1908, Le Croisic French physicist. His grandfather, Antoine-César (1788-1878), was one of the founders of the field of electrochemistry, and his father, Alexandre-Edmond (1820-91), made important studies of light phenomena. Henri likewise studied phosphorescent materials as well as uranium compounds and employed photography in his experiments. He is remembered for his discovery of radioactivity, which occurred when he found that the element uranium (in a sample of pitchblende) emitted invisible rays that could darken a photographic plate. His 1901 report of a burn caused by a sample of Marie Curie's radium that he carried in his vest pocket led to investigations by physicians and ultimately the medical use of radioactive substances. In 1903 he shared a Nobel Prize for Physics with the Curies. The unit of radioactivity, the becquerel (Bq), is named for him\n\nAntoine- Henri baron de Jomini\n\nborn March 6, 1779, Payerne, Switz. died March 24, 1869, Passey, France Swiss-French general and military theorist. After a volunteer stint with the French army (1798-1800), he wrote his Treatise on Grand Military Operations, 5 vol. (1805). He was appointed staff colonel in 1805 by Napoleon I, who had read his book. He was created a baron after the Treaties of Tilsit (1807). He rose to the post of chief of staff, but unjust treatment by his superiors prompted him to resign (1813), and thereafter he fought for France's enemy, Russia. Of his numerous later works on military history and strategy, the best known are Principles of Strategy (1818) and Summary of the Art of War (1838). He was the first to fix divisions between strategy, tactics, and logistics, and his systematic attempt to define the principles of warfare made him a founder of modern military thought\n\nAntoine-Augustin Cournot\n\nborn Aug. 28, 1801, Gray, France died March 31, 1877, Paris French economist and mathematician. The first economist to apply mathematics effectively to the treatment of economic questions, he made important contributions with his discussion of supply and demand functions, the shifting of taxes, and problems of international trade, and he is best remembered for his discussion of strategic behaviour in a market with only two producers, a so-called duopoly. His principal work is Researches into the Mathematical Principles of the Theory of Wealth (1838)\n\nAntoine-Jean Gros\n\nborn March 16, 1771, Paris, Fr. died June 26, 1835, Paris French painter. He was trained by his father, a painter of miniatures, and later byJacques-Louis David in Paris. In the 1790s he accompanied Napoleon on his campaigns as his official battle painter. The dramatic power of such paintings as Napoleon Visiting the Pesthouse at Jaffa (1804) influenced Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix. When David went into exile after Napoleon's defeat, Gros took over his studio and tried to work in the Neoclassical style. His best works after 1815 were portraits. Haunted by a sense of failure, he drowned himself in the Seine. He was a leading figure in the development of Romanticism\n\nAntoine-Louis Barye\n\nborn Sept. 24, 1796, Paris, Fr. died June 29, 1875, Paris French sculptor. The son of a goldsmith, he was apprenticed at 13 to an engraver. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts (1818-23) and began to sculpt animal forms 1819. Influenced by Théodore Géricault, he had a unique talent for rendering dynamic tension and exact anatomical detail. His most famous works depict wild animals devouring their prey; he also rendered groups of domestic animals. His notable bronzes include Lion Devouring a Gavial Crocodile (1831) and an equestrian statue of Napoleon at Ajaccio, Corsica (1860-65)\n\nBaron Antoine Jean Gros\n\n{i} Antoine Jean Gros (1771-1835), French painter\n\nEdmond -Louis-Antoine Huot de and Jules -Alfred Huot de Goncourt\n\nborn May 26, 1822, Nancy, France died July 16, 1896, Champrosay born Dec. 17, 1830, Paris died June 20, 1870, Auteuil French writers. The Goncourt brothers were enabled by a legacy to devote their lives largely to writing. They produced a series of social histories (from 1854) as well as a body of art criticism. The most lasting of their meticulously detailed naturalistic novels is Germinie Lacerteux (1864), which explores working-class life. Their published journals (kept 1851-96) represent both a revealing autobiography and a monumental history of social and literary life in 19th-century Paris. By his will Edmond established the Académie Goncourt, which annually awards the Prix Goncourt, one of France's preeminent literary prizes, to the author of an outstanding work of French literature\n\nJean Antoine Villemin\n\nv. born Jan. 28, 1827, Prey, Vosges, France died Oct. 6, 1892, Paris French physician. As an army doctor, he observed that healthy young men often developed tuberculosis (TB) living in the close quarters of the barracks. Aware that a similar disease in horses was transmitted by inoculation, he gave TB to rabbits by inoculating them with material from sick humans and cows, proving that it was an infectious disease. His contagion theory, published in 1867, was initially ignored but was later corroborated by other scientists' experiments\n\nJean- Antoine Watteau\n\nborn Oct. 10, 1684, Valenciennes, France died July 18, 1721, Nogent-sur-Marne French painter. Son of a roof tiler in Valenciennes, he was apprenticed to a local artist. At 18 he moved to Paris, where he worked for a series of painters; one of them was a theatrical scenery painter, and much of Watteau's work consequently embraced the artifice of the theatre, particularly the commedia dell'arte and the ballet.

The academicians, unable to fit him into any of the recognized categories, welcomed him as a painter of fêtes galantes (\"elegant festivities\"), an important new genre to which countless later Rococo pictures belong\n\nJean-Antoine Houdon\n\nborn March 20, 1741, Versailles, Fr. died July 15, 1828, Paris French sculptor. He studied with Jean-Baptiste Pigalle in Paris and in 1761 won the Prix de Rome. In Rome (1764-68) he achieved immediate fame with an anatomical study of a standing man ( 1767), casts of which were widely used in art academies. He became a member of the Royal Academy in Paris (1777) with his reclining Morpheus. He produced numerous religious and mythological works that are definitive expressions of the decorative 18th-century Rococo style of sculpture. His greatest strength was in capturing the individuality of his portrait subjects, including such luminaries as Denis Diderot, Catherine II the Great, Benjamin Franklin, the Marquis de Lafayette, and Voltaire. In the U.S. he made a marble statue of George Washington (1788). The vividness of physiognomy and character in his busts places him among the greatest portrait sculptors in history\n\nLouis-Antoine de Bougainville\n\nborn Nov. 11, 1729, Paris, France died Aug. 3, 1811, Paris French navigator. In 1764 he established a colony for France in the Falkland Islands. Commissioned by the government to circle the Earth in a voyage of exploration, he put to sea in 1766; after touching Samoa and the New Hebrides he continued west into waters not previously navigated by any European. He turned north on the fringes of the Great Barrier Reef and did not sight Australia. He stopped in the Moluccas and in Java before returning to Brittany in 1769. His widely read Voyage Round the World (1771) helped popularize a belief in the moral worth of people in their natural state. He was secretary to Louis XV (1772), led the French fleet in support of the American Revolution, and was named to the Legion of Honour by Napoleon. The plant genus Bougainvillea is named for him\n\nMarc-Antoine Charpentier\n\nborn 1634, Paris, France died Feb. 24, 1704, Paris French composer. He was a student of Giacomo Carissimi in Rome in the 1660s. Back in Paris, he succeeded Jean-Baptiste Lully as music director with Molière's acting troupe (later the Comédie-Française). He became music director at the principal Jesuit church in Paris, and for his last six years he held the prestigious post of maître de chapelle at the Sainte-Chapelle. Enormously prolific, he was the most important French composer of his generation. He wrote 11 masses, 84 psalm settings, and 207 motets, including some 35 dramatic motets or Latin oratorios, a genre he introduced into France. His works include the oratorio Judicium Salomonis (1702), the mass Assumpta est Maria, and the operas Médée (1693) and David et Jonathas (1688)\n\nMarie-Antoine Carême\n\nborn June 8, 1784, Paris, Fr. died Jan. 12, 1833, Paris French chef.

In sympathy with the French Revolution, he was elected to represent Paris in the Legislative Assembly (1791-92), where he called for a republic. His opposition to the arrest of the moderate Girondins led to his being outlawed (1792). While in hiding he wrote his famous Sketch for a Historical Picture of the Progress of the Human Mind, in which he advanced the idea of the continuous progress of the human race to an ultimate perfection. He was captured and subsequently found dead in prison\n\nRene Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur\n\n{i} Rene Reaumur (1683-1757), French scientist, inventor of the Reaumur temperature scale"
