All Rights Reserved.\n\n1800 1801 1802 1803 1804 1805 1806 1807 1808 1809\n\nThe Nineteenth (19th) Century C.E. (1800-1899)\n\nThe Brain Century? The White Man's Burden Century? A too long century? The Old Order in Europe is on the run as the establishment of Science begins to gain governmental power, while every Tom, Dick and Harry religious, social and political movement afoot tries to steal its name or appearance? Britain's century, ruling an empire where the Sun never sets, while the its stepchild the U.S. is coming on strong, whitening its teeth yearly and sending out Lewis and Clark to find more lebensraum, putting their president in a charred black house for a while? The Protestant Century in the U.S., where preachers become celebs as they lead the flock to Darwinism but not Nazism? The Franz-naming mania in Central Europe continues, stronger than ever?\n\nThe First Decade of the 19th Century (18-Zeds) (1800-1809 C.E.)\n\nThe O for Joy Heroic Napoleon Bonaparte Horati Nelson Trafalgar Decade, with hearing-challenged Ludwig van Beethoven king of the music world, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe of the literary world, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel of the philosophic world, and Napoleon Bonaparte emperor of half of Europe, kicking butt and pulling apart the bones of Chicken Marengo, while everybody else settles for potatoes but gains enough weight to breed like cattle? The decade starts out with the shocking discovery of voltaic piles, and not only physics and chemistry but math, astronomy, biology, and geology make breakthroughs? A good decade for founding military academies, and for thirds? Goya goes both ways with Majas? Schiller eats shoots and leaves?\n\nCountry Leader From To United States of America John Adams (1735-1826) Mar. 4, 1797 Mar. 4, 1801 Britain George III (1738-1820) Oct. 25, 1760 Jan. 29, 1820 France Emperor Napoleon I (1769-1821) May 18, 1804 Apr. 6, 1814 Spain Charles IV (1748-1819) Dec. 14, 1788 Mar. 19, 1808 Austria HRE Francis II (1768-1835) Mar. 1, 1792 Aug. 6, 1806 Russia Tsar Paul I (1754-1801) Nov. 17, 1796 Mar. 12, 1801 Prussia Friedrich Wilhelm III (1770-1840) Nov. 16, 1797 June 7, 1840 Papacy Pope Pius VII (1740-1823) Mar. 14, 1800 July 20, 1823 Turkey Sultan Selim III (1761-1808) Apr. 7, 1789 July 29, 1808\n\n1800 - The Napoleon Bonaparte Gets Jets Year?\n\n1800 Jan. 1, 1800 falls on Wednesday, so this is a Mercury (Woden) Century. World pop. exceeds 1B (one billion) for the 1st time; India: 200M, China: 275M (460M in 1960), Russia (minus Finland): 31M, France (boundaries of 1819-46): 27.8M, Germany: 27M, Italy (boundaries of 1910): 16.9M, Spain: 10.5M, Britain: 10.4M (U.K.: 15M), Prussia (boundaries of 1846): 8.9M; Belgium: 2.96M, Holland: 1.8M, Sweden: 2.3M, Norway: 1.0M; Africa: 107M. Pop. of cities: Beijing: 1M; London: 860K, Paris: 550K, Vienna: 230K, Berlin: 180K, Washington D.C.: 2,464 free plus 623 slave (8K total in the immediate area); there is only one city with a pop. of 1M+, which grows to ? by 2010. The Second (2nd) U.S. Census reports the total pop. as 5,308,483 (35.1% increase) (6.1 per sq. mi.); whites 81.1%; blacks 1,002,037 (18.9%); pop. of New York City: 30K-60K, beginning to double in size every 10 years; 85% of the U.S. labor force works in agriculture; blacks are now completely locked into the American institutional slavery system, their skin color being a badge of inferiority; life expectancy in W Europe is 40 years, and the potato-fed pop. has increased in all its nations from 50%-100% since 1730, with the boom in premarital sexual intercourse since 1780 making a big prick. World Economic Growth jumps from 0% to 2% per annum for the first time in known history, making the modern world possible? This year forests cover 96% of Ohio; by 1900 it's only 25%. By the end of this decade the British cotton industry employs 90K factory workers and 184K handloom weavers. Napoleon Bonaparte (1769-1821) establishes himself as First Consul in the Tuileries, and appoints a commission of jurors to combine all French civil laws into the patriarchial Code Napoleon (1804-10), to go into effect on Mar. 21, 1804, with Jean Jacques Regis, duc de Cambaceres, author of the Projet de Code Civil as 2nd consul; women have no political rights, and divorce with alimony is reserved to worn-out bitches, er, wives over 45 who have been married at least 20 years; the tradition of impartible inheritance is ended, contributing to low birthrates as families seek to pass land on intact; Chateau de Malmaison 7 mi. W of Paris on the Seine River, home of Napoleon and Josephine since 1799 becomes with the Tuileries the HQ of the French govt. (until 1802); Nappy allegedly orders people to drive on the right side of the road - if he can do that, he can get away with anything? On Jan. 20 Napoleon's sister Maria Annunziata Carolina Bonaparte (1782-1839) marries natty dresser Joachim Murat (1767-1815), making him Nappy's brother-in-law - well la-di-da? On Jan. 24 the Convention of al-Arish provides for safe return of French troops from Egypt, with the Ottomans paying for their redeployment, while remaining in control of the Ionian Islands; too bad, British Mediterranean CIC adm. Lord Keith doesn't accept the convention. In Jan.

On Jan. 1 the U.S. Marine Band makes its debut at the White House, which is actually painted gray until 1813. On Jan. 1 war secy. (since 1800) Samuel Dexter becomes treasury secy. #3, becoming the lucky guy who administers the oath of office to chief justice John Marshall before resigning on May 13 and heading back to Boston. On Jan. 31 Pres. Adams appoints his secy. of state John Marshall (1755-1835) as the 4th chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court and 13th justice (until July 6, 1835) to replace Oliver Ellsworth (1796-1800) in a Supreme Court regarded as ineffectual, and he is sworn in on Feb. 4, serving simultaneously as secy. of state until Mar. 4; both Marshall and Thomas Jefferson are descended from William Randolph - so the nation is in good hands with Allstate? In Jan. French gen. Etienne Jacques Joseph Alexandre MacDonald (1765-1840) (of Scottish descent) leads the French army of Italy into Austria from the S over the difficult Splugen Pass, causing the Austrian emperor to seek peace; in Jan. extreme conservative Klemens Wenzel Nepomuk Lothar von Metternich (1773-1859) (who witnessed revolutionary excesses as a student in Strasbourg, souring him against them for life) begins his career as Austrian envoy to the elector of Saxony at the court of Dresden, where he develops all kinds of connections with the Poles and Russians, and goes on to maneuver Austria through the dangerous Napoleon era and land it on top, getting a promotion to prince along the way (1813) - with this new job I know I can get financing? On Feb. 9 after having the Hohenlinden knocked out of them, the Austrians sign the Treaty (Peace) of Luneville (LunÃ©ville) (pr. lu-nay-VEEL) with Napoleon, and HRE Francis II again cedes the left bank of the Rhine to France (which is nice, since that's where the original Germanic Franks started out?), and concedes the breakup of the Holy Roman Empire, with all cessions made under Campo Formio reaffirmed; the Batavian, Helvetian, Cisalpine and Ligurian Repubs. are recognized, and the Louisiana territory is ceded by Spain to France; the grand duchy of Tuscany becomes the duchy of Etruria, given to the son of the duke of Parma; with Austria out of the war, Britain and France begin peace negotiations; on Feb. 9 the Armistice of Foligno stops the war between France and Naples. Like sausage, it's better if you don't see it made? On Feb. 10 knowing of his defeat before the electoral votes are formally counted on Feb. 11, U.S. Pres. Adams closes his admin. with his controversial U.S. Midnight Judges Act (Appointments) (Judiciary Act of 1801), which is passed on Feb. 27 by the outgoing Federalist-controlled U.S. Congress, repealing the 1789 act and reducing the Supreme Court from six justices to five, while raising the number of circuits from three to six and establishing five new judicial districts, for a total of 18, creating 16 circuit courts that Adams appoints Federalist officers to, incl. William Marbury (1762-1835) to the office of justice of the peace in the District of Columbia; the incoming Jefferson admin. views the act as a Federalist trick to keep a Repub. from being appointed to the court, and gets it repealed next year. On Feb. 11 the 1800 U.S. Pres. Election of Oct. 31-Dec. 3 is finally counted; Repubs. Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tie with 73 electoral votes each (Adams 65, Pinckney 64, New York Federalist John Jay 1); when Burr refuses to withdraw in favor of Jefferson (did this system suck or what?), the election is then moved to the House of Reps. for the 1st time ever, which has a Federalist majority that was largely elected in 1798 and is now a lame duck; instead of conceding, Burr decides to use the Duck House to pick him, but Alexander Hamilton urges Federalists to vote for Jefferson as the lesser of two evils, and on Feb. 17 on the 36th ballot Vt. and Md. switch their votes to Jefferson, but since Federalist reps of four states cast blank ballots, Jeffybaby wins with only 10 out of the 16 states, while Burr wins four states and becomes vice-pres. (and becomes bitter about his whole also-ran life?); meanwhile John Adams' standing up to war pressure has borne fruit in a treaty with France, but news arrives too late to save his reelection - I ain't gonna work for Maggie's brother no more? On Feb. 27 the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 is passed by the U.S. Congress, placing the District of Columbia under their control incl. Washington County to the N and E of the Potomac River, Alexandria County to the W and S of the Potomac River, and leaving the charters of Georgetown and Alexandria untouched; next year the city of Washington, D.C. is incorporated, a mayor-city council govt. established, and a jail built. On Mar. 4 6 ft. 2.5 in. Va.-born Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826), AKA \"the Red Fox\", \"the Scribe (Pen) of the Revolution\", \"the Father of the Declaration of Independence\", \"the Sage of Monticello\", \"the Moonshine Philosopher of Monticello\", \"the Man of the People\", \"Long Tom\", \"Mad Tom\", \"the Negro President\" (owes his V to the Three-Fifths Compromise) becomes the 3rd U.S. pres. (until Mar. 4, 1809) in the 4th U.S. Pres. Inauguration, becoming the first pres. to be inaugurated at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., which he helped to design, and where he goes every Sunday for religious services in the House of Reps.; after he gets dissatisfied with the music at the Sunday services, and knowing that outgoing Pres. Adams invited them to perform at the Pres. Mansion earlier in the year, Jefferson gets the U.S. Marine Band (established on July 11, 1798) to play there, becoming a tradition; Jefferson names the music The President's Own, becoming the nickname for the band; the inauguration is tense and on the break of violence because Jefferson's view of govt. is 180 deg. out of step with Washington's and Adams', but it goes peacefully, setting a precedent until 2021?; Jefferson's First Inaugural Address calls America \"the world's best hope\", spurring Dr. Joseph Priestly in Mar. to write: \"We can no longer say there is nothing new under the sun. For this whole chapter in the history of man is new. The great extent of our republic is new\"; Aaron Burr (1756-1836) becomes the 3rd U.S. vice-president; 32-y.-o. snuff-loving becoming the first pres. to be inaugurated at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., which he helped to design, and where he goes every Sunday for religious services in the House of Reps.; the U.S. Marine Band plays for his inaguration, and he names the music The President's Own, which becomes a tradition; after he gets dissatisfied with the music at the Sunday services, he gets the U.S. Marine Band to play there; Jefferson's First Inaugural Address calls America \"the world's best hope\", spurring Dr. Joseph Priestly in Mar. to write \"We can no longer say there is nothing new under the sun. For this whole chapter in the history of man is new. The great extent of our republic is new\"; Aaron Burr (1756-1836) becomes the 3rd U.S. vice-president; 32-y.-o. snuff-loving Dolley Madison becomes his hostess, while his intellectual daughter Martha Washington Jefferson \"Patsy\" Randolph (1772-1836) becomes First Lady since he's a widower; next year Jefferson turns the State of the Union address from a speech into a written report sent to Congress, which is not changed for 112 years (until Pres. Wilson); the whole business is historic since Creation, becoming the first time a govt. changes hands between bitter political foes without violence, as ex-pres. Adams packs his bags and goes home to Quincy?; on Mar. 5 he appoints Am. Rev. War gen. Henry Dearborn (1751-1829) as U.S. war secy. #5 (until Mar, 4, 1809), and former S.C. gov. (1789-92) Charles Pinckney (1757-1824) as U.S. minister to Spain (until 1805), with the Mission: Impossible of getting Fla. from Spain and Spanish acquiescence in the transfer of La. from France. On Mar. 8 the Second Battle of Aboukir sees the British Expeditionary Corps begins a siege of Alexandria, establishing a beachhead against 4K French troops under Gen. Menou after an assault under Scottish-born Col. (later Lt.-Gen. Sir John Moore (1761-1809), followed on Mar. 21 by the Battle of Alexandria (Canope), where the British disprove the myth of French invincibility, although Lord Ambercrombie (b. 1734) is fatally wounded. On Mar. 12 Russian tsar (since 1796) Paul I (b. 1754) (always paranoid about suspected assassins) is assassinated by revolutionaries (those *!*? serfs and peasants?) in his bedroom in Mikhailovsky Palace in St. Petersburg, and on Sept. 5 despite announcing his wish to abdicate, his poetic, bookish son (Catherine II the Great's grandson) (handsome-pretty, with curly chestnut hair and blue-gray eyes like his grandmother) Alexander I (1777-1825) (whose portrait bears a striking resemblance to Russian pres. Vladimir Putin (1952-)?) is crowned tsar of Russia (until Dec. 1, 1825). On Mar. 14 after paying $83K in the last 3.5 years, Pres. Jefferson decides to quit paying their Muslim jizya, the dey of Tripoli orders the U.S. consular flagstaff to be cut down as a declaration of war, and Jefferson dispatches four warships sans Congressional action, later adding two more. On Mar. 14 British PM (since Dec. 19, 1783) William Pitt the Younger (1759-1806) resigns along with Viscount Castlereagh when George III rejects his plans for linking the Act of Union with Ireland with the emancipation of Irish Catholics, and approaches anti-emancipationist Henry Addington (1757-1844) about replacing him as PM, becoming British PM on Mar. 17 (until May 10, 1804). On Mar. 28 the Treaty of Florence between France and Naples cedes Naples' possessions in C Italy and the island of Elba, accepts French garrisons in several Italian towns, and closes harbors to British and Ottoman ships. On Mar. 31 the Danish colonies in the Virgin Islands surrender to the British; on Apr. 2 the British under adm. Sir Hyde Parker (1739-1807), aided by newly-promoted vice-adm. Lord Nelson (who accepts service under Parker despite rank) destroy most of the Danish fleet in the Battle of Copenhagen Roads (Harbor), during which Nelson ends up taking charge, and ignores a signal from Parker to withdraw by putting a telescope up to his blind right eye and declaring he can't see any signal; the Danish fleet is almost destroyed, but they hurt the British enough to sign a peace treaty on Oct. 23, allowing Denmark to quit the leaderless League of Armed Neutrality and flourish again, playing all sides; Nelson is created viscount for his big V - give me a box of Dutch Masters? In Apr. after being instigated by Napoleon, the Prussians march into Hanover and occupy it without resistance (until June, 1803). In late Apr. a combined British-Ottoman army advances on Cairo, and reaches it on June 21, taking the 13K-man French garrison on June 27. On May 2 Dem.-Repub. Party co-founder (with Pres. Jefferson) James Madison becomes U.S. secy. of state #5 (until Mar. 3, 1809), going on to supervise the Louisiana Purchase. On May 10 after a $225K bribe is refused by the Jefferson admin., the pasha (eyalet) of Tripoli declares war on the U.S., starting the First Barbary (Barbary Coast) (Tripolitan) War (ends June 10, 1805) (2nd in 1815) between the U.S. and Sweden vs. Tripolitania and Morocco; on July 17 the U.S. fleet arrives in Tripoli with the schooners USS Enterprise and USS Constitution (AKA Old Ironsides) to do battle with the Quran-thumping Muslim Barbary pirates, who claim the Quran gives them the right to make war on any nation not submitting to Sharia and take prisoners and booty - an early episode of Star Trek, and it's between the Stars and Strips and Islam? On May 14 Swiss-born Repub. financial expert Albert Gallatin (1761-1849), who was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1793 then ousted for not having been a U.S. citizen for the required nine years, then elected to the U.S. House of Reps. in 1795-1801, where he founded the House Ways and Means Committee (originally the Finance Committee) is appointed U.S. treasury secy. #4 by Pres. Jefferson (until Feb. 8, 1814), going on to create a treasury surplus by 1807 despite the Louisiana Purchase. In early June a British force lands on the Red Sea coast, and begins crossing the desert on June 19, scaring France's new Mamluk allies into dropping support. On May 20-June 9 the War of the Oranges sees Spain declare war on Portugal after it refuses the demand of Spanish minister Manuel de Godoy to enter into an alliance with France against its ally (since 1343) Britain as well as cede most of its territory; in Apr. French troops invade, and on May 20 they are joined by Spanish troops, taking the town of Olivenza (Olivenca) near the border, after which Godoy picks oranges at nearby Elvas and sends them to the queen of Spain with a message that he will now head toward Lisbon, after which Portugal folds, signing the Treaty of Badajoz on June 6, ceding Olivenza, Almeida and other border fortresses to Spain, and closing all ports to the British; on Sept. 29 John VI of Portugal also signs the 1801 Treaty of Madrid, agreeing to pay France a 20M franc indemnity and cede half of Guyana in N South Am., which becomes French Guiana.

Wouldn't you know it, some pesky geologists rock Bible Creationism to its foundations?\n\n1802 On Jan. 1 Thomas Jefferson writes a letter to the Danbury Baptist Assoc. in Conn., using Roger Williams' phrase \"wall of separation between church and state\"; \"Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man & his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, & not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof', thus building a wall of separation between Church & State. Adhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in behalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction the progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to man all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in opposition to his social duties\"; the same week he attends a church service in the U.S. Capitol, where the sermon is by Mass.-born Baptist minister John Leland (1754-1841), who arrived on Jan. 1 with a giant cheese from the people of Cheshire, Mass., causing him to become known as the Mammoth Priest, and who writes the immortal soundbyte: \"To read in the New Testament, that the Lord has ordained that those that preach the gospel shall live by its institutions and precepts, sounds very harmonical; but to read in a state constitution, that the legislature shall require men to maintain teachers of piety, religion and morality, sounds very discordant\"; too bad, after the issue seems settled, Here Comes Marx, and by the late 20th cent. the ACLU (Anti-Christian Litigation Union?) is running a systematic campaign to twist Jefferson from the Saint of Church-State Separation into the Saint of Secularism, citing his letter as if it were part of the U.S. Constitution in a master plan to pressure judges into creating a new Bill of Rights that incl. \"freedom from religion\", seeking to remove all religious references from public life by force Commie-style, even the expression of individual opinion i n public institutions?; by the 2020s the ACLU is backing the extreme leftists in denigrating Jefferson as a white supremacist - I forgot the italics this time bahbahbahbah dadangdangdiddy?
