That this judgment was a truism for cultured men of the day was evident in John Stuart Mill's ready assent that only a clod could not know that \"the history of civilization in France is that of civilization in Europe.\" What was the nature of this civilization that enthralled the European mind for at least two centuries ? The superb German survey entitled The Civilhgtion of France (1930) by Ernst Curtius makes it mainly a matter of literary culture: \"Literature plays a far larger part in the cultural and national consciousness of France than it does in that of any other nation.\" Victor Hugo summed it up: \"Literature is civilization.\" Curtius argued that \"in France literature fulfills the function which among us [Germans] is divided between philosophy, science, poetry and music.\" So even Cartesianism, \"the most important factor in the intellectual history of France,\" was distilled into the literary cliche of clarte francaise. France's intellectual hegemony in Europe was facilitated by the cultural universality of its language, characterized by \"logic, lucidity, brilliance, naturalness, and taste.\" This leaves little room for the cult of Isis, widely touted elsewhere as the goddess to whom we must pay tribute for our modernity. Curtius makes only a few remarks concerning the ideological value of science in France as a source of liberation from \"the authority of dogma, society and custom.\"1 Like most fascinating generalizations, that of Curtius on the role of science in French civilization has just enough truth in it to be quite misleading. In spite of the importance of the medieval Sorbonne as a center of scholastic criticism providing a point of origin for the scientific theories of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, by the time of the Renaissance the university was so moribund that the monarchy permitted humanists to lecture outside the university - this was the \"founding\" of the College de France. This was also the beginning of the classic French policy of creating new institutions rather than fighting the battle of reforming old ones. Francois Furet assumes that a law is in operation: \"The history of French higher education obeys a law of 1\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nperipheral development.\"2 It is true that the institutionalization of the Academie franchise (1635) established a literary connection with the state, but the sciences were not far behind with the founding of the Academie des sciences (1666). In the seventeenth century, Paris was an international scientific center, although many of the savants were foreign. Because the government was interested in good administration and concerned with defense, the eighteenth century was an especially creative period in the founding of higher scientific-technical-engineering schools: the Ecole des ponts et chaussees (1715), the Ecole royale du genie (1748), the Ecole des mines (1783), and the Ecole polytechnique (1794). From about 1750 to 1840 France enjoyed scientific preeminence in Europe. Later in the nineteenth century, the rise of German and British scientific research had the comparative effect of reducing France to one of the centers of science in the Western world. France remained a leader in scientific teaching and research. Few countries had such a galaxy of comparable institutions: the Sorbonne, the Ecole normale superieure, the College de France, the Museum d'histoire naturelle, the Polytechnique, the Observatoire, and a whole gamut of technical institutions. The significant institutional creations of the late nineteenth century were the Ecole pratique des hautes etudes (1868), the Institut Pasteur (1888), the Ecole superieure de physique et chimie industrielles (1883), the Ecole superieure d'electricite (1894), the laboratories of marine biology, and a few good provincial faculties of science. By the time of the Great War, state-supported or subsidized institutions were doing a respectable job in scientific education and research. Research related to industry became increasingly important, especially in provincial faculties of science. Even after the devastation wrought by the two world wars, France was able to develop a new structure of scientific education and research; that it could do so was in some measure a result of the scientific and technological potential built up over the preceding century. The French budget plan for 1983 included 52.2 billion francs for research and industry, an increase of 35.8 percent over 1982. 3 There was a clear priority given to scientific research, technological development, industrial restructuring, and the development of national energy sources. The establishment of a Ministry of Research and Industry by the Socialists shows their commitment to the belief that basic research is closely linked to industrial prowess. The Socialist decision to build the much-debated Museum of Science and Technology at La Villette, a temple for the new religion of science, shows both the government's desire to make the public aware of the transforming power of science and technology and Socialism's devotion to its historical heritage.4 While recently praising Jack Lang's notorious verbal\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nfandango in Mexico, Francois Gros harkened back to the seminal period of French scientism in the nineteenth century, a period when men knew the liberating virtues of science. Socialist action is the most recent of a series of intensive efforts and financial investments by government and industry since the Second Empire. Of course the big science that came into being after World War II takes us in many ways into a different world. By the 1930s big science may not have begun, but the epitaph of little science had already been written. While pushing the growth of science many scientists innocently came to know sin, but it does not seem that the pursuit of an elusive power led to a weakening of the human lust for knowledge, science's primal pulse. Knowledge and power are really inseparable. The history of modern science makes it clear that knowledge can be achieved only through the medium of some type of power, by the close alliance of scientists with the state while forging or maintaining their own cognitive and disciplinary identities. In his Science and Polity in France at the End ofthe Old Regime, Charles Gillispie has intrigued us with the intersections between government and science.5 In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries these intersections progressed to the point of interface or even intussusception. My account of this development in France certainly recognizes the importance of \"the integration of science into history through the medium of events and institutions,\" but it does not claim to reject \"configurations of ideas or culture.\" Perhaps this is my heretical homage to The Edge of Objectivity, still our best Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas6 A major theme of this work is the astounding growth of university science in France from the Second Empire (1860s) to the period of incipient disintegration of the Third Republic (1930s). Outside the auto-titillating world of literary criticism, context is still viewed as of some importance in understanding the discourse. French scientific growth makes sense only within an elucidation of the distinctive nature of French economic, political, and social life. The growth of science was stimulated by a number of essential tensions: Parisian versus provincial priorities in scientific development, the eternal university problems of a division of resources between teaching and research, the hoary distinction between pure and applied science, science as objective icon versus science as ideological fetish, and prolific if sometimes fruitless quarrels between scientists over the direction of science, its methods, and the partition of the spoils of its victories. \"Le sens de Thistoire appelle tout d'abord son contresens.\"7 It is now commonplace to argue that \"conceptions of science are shown to be sustained by particular social and political contexts.\" 8 This seems a reasonable generalization about the early years of the Third Republic, when,\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nas George Weisz has shown with Benedictine fidelity to the evidence, politicians and power brokers took educational reform seriously, with a keen interest in science, assuming that reform \"was indispensable socially and politically.\"9 Unfortunately, this enlightening dogma must immediately be restricted to modest scope by the frank admission that little is known about the class basis of the Third Republic; class is not a very useful category of analysis in this case. Still, there are a certain number of tags and ideas that have become part of linguistic usage in the historical world, and little harm is done in using them with the realization that their explanatory power is limited, much like using an equation to \"explain\" gravity. In the analysis of local situations the precision of the data and the micro-nature of the problem sometimes justify a relaxation of the moral and critical scruples that are essential in the high-level generalizations necessary to achieve Mandarin status in theology and the social sciences. A naive epistemologist might be forgiven for believing that there is more certainty in economics than in social theory. It does seem that there is at least less confusion in economic retrodiction than in economic prediction, but even in retrodicting the historian is faced with an embarrassingly rich choice of historical models of growth. Among the better known of these clever concoctions are the Rostow model of \"the airborne economy,\" the Gerschenkron model of \"the deprived economy,\" and the Parsonian system with a modified version available in Aron's model, both of which are entrepreneurial or managerial hypotheses. \"The battered and tired French economy of the nineteenth century\" is a \"test-bed for many of the historical models of economic growth.\" Although Clive Trebilcock leans more to a pessimistic view of French growth, accepting the steady growth theory of recent economic historians but limiting it with the slower pace of their honorable ancestors, he reluctantly concludes that \"Spengler was wise to set aside the so-called objective factors limiting French growth (the limited demographic and capital resources of France), to replace the coal with soul explanations: French value patterns, French tastes, the heterogeneous nature of France's cultural heritage.\" Economics clearly comes under the empire of Derrida's deconstructionist axioms: \"Everything can be given at least two equally cogent explanations; in the temporal process of thinking about anything, one explanation collapses into its contrary.\" 10 It will be obvious that this work leans more toward accepting the optimistic view of French development than the pessimistic view; the rosy view generally fits my account of scientific and technical development better than the dark view. The glaring deficiencies of French economic development are allowed their chiaroscuro function when justified. It may be, as Trebilcock notes with satisfaction, that \"the revisionist tactics for the economic history of France\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nappear to be passing out of style, but \"French entrepreneurial history remains a shooting war with learned articles serving as projectiles.\" 11 The historian has the luxury of waiting for the victory of one gang or another. In spite of the argument that the Restoration was a period of great growth in industrial production, the clear dualism afflicting French technology before 1850, with the archaic far outweighing the advanced technologies, makes it dubious to posit a French industrial revolution for the period 1830— 50. The general Continental practice of founding technical schools to overcome economic backwardness continued with the founding of the Ecole centrale des arts et manufactures in 1829 in order to promote \"the creation of a new breed of men, intellectually armed with a knowledge of la science industrielle and morally fortified by the precepts and discipline of three years at their Parisian school.\"12 From the 1830s on even the university faculties began to show signs of life. And it would not be long before they would begin to flatter the technical schools by trying to imitate them in forging as best they could some industrial connections. Technical schools may promote industry, but industry frequently looked like the source of scientific life and growth for the faculties. Later in the century some of the faculties gave birth to versions of the great Parisian technical schools, a development inconceivable without the existence of the very industry that these faculties so assiduously promoted. Abolished in 1793, reestablished in 1808, the collection of independent faculties - letters, sciences, medicine, law - designated for linguistic convenience as French universities, showed little sign of dynamism before the Third Republic.13 The ten original faculties of science, to which five more were added in 1854, were small groups of professors, frequently from lycees, chiefly concerned with reproducing themselves in sufficient numbers to fill a small number of secondary school and faculty jobs. Paris was an obvious exception. Some of the greatest contemporary scientists were associated with the founding of the Sorbonne faculty of sciences. Research was not given a key role in the university system, but it did exist and grew slowly, with an important spurt in the 1830s, until the reform movement of the 1860s institutionalized and legitimized research with the founding of the Ecole pratique des hautes etudes in 1868. Devoted to the research ethos, the Ecole pratique was a part of Duruy's excessively ambitious reforms aiming at the promotion of a revolution in higher education, then beginning to be the victim of unfavorable comparisons with foreign exemplars. True, the Ecole was just an administrative mechanism for the distribution of funds, but what could be more important, especially as a beginning? Good results were soon evident in all areas of science, with a new burst of creativity in physics and the maturing of a research cycle in marine biology. Along with the rise of the\n\n5\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nUniversity of Paris, one must note the corresponding decline of the Museum and, to a lesser extent, the Polytechnique and the College de France as centers of research. After 1937, with the arrival of Leprince-Ringuet, the Polytechnique became important again in basic research in physics. The basis for the rapid expansion of the university in the last quarter of the nineteenth century was firmly established, but the faculties needed subsidized students, money for construction and equipment, and professors interested in research as well as in teaching and service. By 1900 the provision of these ingredients by the Third Republic had produced one of the world's great university systems, a system that was particularly strong in the sciences. In his study of the political role of French universities, George Weisz has shown the failure of higher education to live up to the expectations of politicians who wanted universities to \"play a major role in fostering social integration.\" The faculties of science were probably the most feeble contributors to the social mission of the universities, although, as Weisz admits, even \"science could not remain totally isolated from the ideological battles of the Third Republic.\"14 The Third Republic did not lack scientists willing to proclaim an alliance between democratic republicanism and science or to concoct the basis of an ideological marriage. The republic was not without powerful weapons in its quest for ideological support in the faculties: appointments to new chairs, the influence of the Conseil superieur de Instruction publique, and even the system of university inspection by Parisian professors. But it proved notoriously difficult, if not finally impossible, to squeeze much ideological sap out of science itself. Catholics and Marxists have found science equally refractory to their ideological wooing. Not only did science qua science show itself to be generally immune to the infection of political ideology, but the new science of biology was nearly as politically sterile as physics and chemistry, with all failing miserably to supply much ammunition for the republican Kulturkampf. No genuine fusion of ideology and science took place, even with the ostensibly promising opportunity of a meeting of biology and positivism. Yet for a while about mid-nineteenth century it looked as if positivism and biology would form a fruitful alliance and French politics would benefit from its secular offspring. Certainly the scientifically sanitized positivism of Littre and his acolytes played a role in the Societe de biologie, but even here the influence of Charles Robin must be weighed against the preponderance of Claude Bernard. That both positivism and French biology opposed evolution, especially the Darwinian variant, had little consequence in the forging of a common ideological outlook. The fact is that the ideas of Comte and even of the few medical scientists who embraced one type of positivism or another were unacceptable to most biologists and of little importance in\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthe definition of research programs. As physiology emerged as the supreme biological science, at least in its own powerful opinion, the divergence between Bernard's nonphilosophy and positivism became the stumbling stone for the ideologues whining for a scientific Weltanschauung or a scientifically inspired Kulturkampf. Littre's positivism was popular with the first generation of republican politicians, who thought it to be the ideological gyro for university reform and national unity with social integration. Alas, by the 1870s it was plain that scientism of all sorts was a weak reed incapable of elicting much intellectual support and certainly not able to sustain a national consensus.15 Considerable attention has been focused on the fortunes of French physics and on the shortcomings of organic chemistry in the nineteenth century. Little attention has been directed toward biology, except to lament the failure of French biologists to ingest Darwinism, a failure probably without much significance for research because of the generally contested status of Darwinism as a paradigm and as a research program. About 1850 the Museum and College de France, whose reputation in biology was much admired in England, were much stronger scientific institutions than the faculty of sciences in Paris. But by the turn of the century the faculty was much better in biology than the Museum and, considering the wide spectrum of biological research, more active than the College de France. The College rarely deviated from the respectability of physiological research, still an important biological area but much less so than in the heyday of Claude Bernard. The state-stimulated growth of secondary education, with its necessary fillip to faculties, and the key research role played by doctoral students go a long way toward explaining the new research dominance of the faculty of sciences in Paris. The development of marine biology was a general Euro-American phenomenon in which France played a major research role. Here was a classic case of the interaction of national, local, university, and scientific interests, as was also the case in the growth of university institutes of applied research. And whatever we may think about the old-fashioned great-man theory of history, whose version in the history of science is now under attack by the epistemological disease of ethnomethodology, great individuals, defined as such by others as well as subtly by themselves, were conspicuous in creating this area of research. In spite of striking success in marine biology, the general state of French biology early in the twentieth century was quite unsatisfactory for many of the biologists, especially when they compared the conceptual advances in Germany and England with the seeming stagnation in France. Even if one makes due allowance for the constitutional inclination of the French to find\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nthat foreigners are doing it better, a century's impressive growth in biological research and teaching ended in intellectual confusion and pedagogical smugness and stodginess. The success of the research program in marine biology did not seem transferable to other areas of biological research. The question of what direction French biology should take led to a division of leading researchers into two enemy camps with no immediate benefit to research or teaching. Beginning as a bitter academic monk's quarrel, a squabble between two of France's leading biologists soon enveloped the whole field of research, with serious questions being raised on the orientation of the major research areas and on France's ability to keep up with the work being done in other countries. One group even argued that the whole direction of research, largely derived from marine biology, was hopelessly old-fashioned. By the 1920s it was inevitable that the structure of higher education be blamed for a striking scientific failure that had been snatched from the jaws of success. One of the most distinguishing features of the provincial faculties of science was the establishment in the late nineteenth century of institutes and programs of applied science; indeed, without these ventures in technology many of the faculties would have remained local stagnant fens with no tributaries into the mainstream of science. Victor Duruy was full of Baconian optimism in hoping that the universal exhibition of 1867 would show businessmen that the \"wealth of industry flows, like a river from its source, out of the chemist's laboratory and the physicist's and naturalist's study.\" 16 Yet the theorem worked well enough to convince governments and a few industrialists to push technology into a position of dominance in higher scientific education. After the stimulus of defeat in 1870, French private interests, in collaboration with the Ministry of Commerce, promoted the establishment of commercial and industrial schools in many of the major cities. It is not unreasonable to make a positive correlation between the growth of the French economy in at least metallurgy, chemicals, and electricity, especially in Paris, Lyon, Nancy, and Toulouse, and the rise of the university institutes and programs of applied science, which were churning out about 500 industrial degrees annually by 191 3.17 With the 550 higherlevel graduates of the grandes ecoles and the 600 lower-level products of the ecoles d'arts et metiers, France was among the few countries in the world endowed with substantial human resources over a broad spectrum of the engineering and technical needs of a great power. 18 It is curious that two of the areas in which French science has had considerable success, biology and applied science in the universities, were experiencing difficulty early in the century. Nothing fails like success. Applied science became excessively vocational. Scientific research and 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nindustry remained in a state of hostile virginity instead of entering into a fruitful intercourse. But these deficiencies should not blind us to the \"significant methodological and ideological interactions\" of nineteenthcentury science and technology.19 This is part of what Kuhn calls the second scientific revolution of the first half of the nineteenth century, although the interactions seem more evident in the second half of the century. The French case also raises considerable doubt as to the universal necessity of maintaining the separate institutional arrangement of \"the universities for Wissenschafi and the Technische Hochschulen for industry and the crafts\" in order to have first-rate science and technology. Across the channel were the English sisters of the French provincial universities. The civic universities of Birmingham, Liverpool, and Manchester, which owed much to their \"intimate connections and interrelations with industry,\" were \"leading centres of scientific advance\" in almost all industrial areas.20 A mutually beneficial parasitism seems to have prevailed between science and technology since the eighteenth century. Agricultural research and related teaching were paltry affairs in the universities when compared with the wealth of industrially related programs. No diploma mills for agricultural studies existed in the faculties. To some extent, this was the result of the adequacy of education provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, vigilant in jealously guarding its prerogatives from imperialistic ventures of the Ministry of Education. But in ferreting out the connections between the faculties of science and agriculture one must look beyond the few formal institutes and programs producing the lowly brevets and certificates, for there did exist close relations between science and agriculture at theoretical and practical levels. The late nineteenth-century spin-offs from pursuing agricultural work in small faculties could be important, especially in gaining local support. Isidore Pierre at Caen could wax ecstatic: \"L'etude des applications des sciences a ragriculture a pris, dans les universites franchises, un essor dont on ne saurait trop se feliciter.\"21 Many professors recognized this and preached incessantly about the services science could render to agriculture. No one was a more insistent and powerful advocate of the virtues of commercialization and of research than Louis Grandeau, first in Nancy and then in Paris. Scientists in previously peripheral subjects like botany found in the late nineteenth century that their research was of economic value or could be made to appear so with a little effort. So plant physiology and biology attracted support for laboratories essential status symbols as well as vital instruments for the advance of science - and various kinds of agricultural institutes and stations. The regional importance of agricultural science is clear in cases like that of Bordeaux, where industries based on wine and pine drew heavily upon 9\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nchemistry to found the Station oenologique and the Institut du pin, both offspring of the University. The structure of a national system of agricultural research was clearly visibile in France by 1914. In the short run the high-quality research network was more important for the scientific elite than for the peasantry. The peasant's republic did little for his agricultural education. The input of science into agricultural production was limited. Certainly French agriculture was a less competitive industry on the world scene than it should have been, but this probably had little to do with science. By the end of the century science had become firmly attached to the end of the agricultural chain: Consumption gave rise to thorny questions concerning quality and safety. Answers were mainly the job of the lower ranks of the scientific army, while the higher ranks often tried to keep a certain distance from the dangerous quarrels arising out of public health. The interest of a serious scientist in consumer issues is often, as a critic said of one of Barthes's intellectual flirtations, like that of a man interested in women but who can appreciate them only by an X-ray machine. The professionalization of the public health movement was dependent on the development of scientific analytical techniques and the production of personnel by the state's faculties of science. In higher education the French state enjoyed a monopoly until 1875, when Catholics were given the right to establish faculties, and retained easy dominance after the establishment of limited freedom for private interests. In many ways the five Catholic universities came to occupy a role in France's educational system out of proportion to their educational significance, although that was considerable. A prominent role was given to the sciences in the Catholic universities, with serious attention paid to the wishes of local industrial and agricultural elites, who had to supply most of the funds for the new institutions. But Catholics, who also had access to the excellent state system, were unwilling to build the monuments of glory envisaged by the hierarchy. The new universities were also hindered by political and legal shackles as a result of coming into maturity during the rise of radical anticlericalism. Only for a while did it look as if Catholicism might be as stimulating for French capitalism as Confucianism has been for Japanese industrial success.22 While Catholic and anticlerical were caught in a sort of Barthesian clash of \"organized networks of obsessions,' the nation suffered, although there was inevitably some national benefit derived from the competition, however unequal, between Catholic and state institutions. Some dormant state faculties finally came alive when confronted by the threat of a Catholic faculty, and others were spurred on to greater efforts than would ever have been thought possible before 1875. The impact of Catholic higher education was far less than Catholic elementary and 10\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nsecondary education, but it is a largely forgotten chapter of French history that deserves a modest rehabilitation. \"Et salut, temoins purs de Tame en ce combat/Pour Taffranchissement de la lourde nature!\" 23 The pattern of professional scientific communication definitively established in the nineteenth century was clearly different from that in the humanities and most social sciences. Scientists came to publish the results of their research \"in journals read only by the profession. Books are exclusively textbooks, compendia, popularizations, or philosophical reflections, and writing them is a somewhat suspect, because non-professional, activity.\" 24 Probably truer of the twentieth than of the nineteenth century, this statement nevertheless identifies a distinguishing characteristic of scientific publication that had its origins in the seventeenth century but became a striking characteristic only in the nineteenth century. Research and publication also became \"unquestionably key elements in any successful academic career.\" 25 Doctoral dissertations, more original and unfortunately longer, became more important in the degree-granting process and in job getting. 26 The increasing loss of scientific importance for books did not mean that there were fewer published: the need for textbooks in the expanding educational system, the growing lay demand for popularizations, and the publication of the classics of science produced a great increase in books and monographs. The French developed a Gallic textbook model widely regarded, especially by the French, as superior to the pedagogical efforts of their neighbors. The publication of Les Atomes (191 3) by Jean Perrin showed that they were not always wrong in their assumption of French superiority in continuing the Enlightenment tradition of haute vulgarisation. William Ramsey was conventional enough in praising Perrin's style as a product of French sensitivity that was unattainable by people of the North. J. D. Bernal was struck by another virtue of Perrin's book: The brilliant experimentalist turned publicist showed a combination of the imaginative experimental methodology with refined German mathematics, presented in its full complexity and abstraction without a sacrifice of reality and comprehensibility.27 Perrin's scientific reputation was firmly established before his work of popularization, but the book gave him a more general fame and enhanced his reputation even within the scientific community, where one specialist often has to understand another's specialty through a popularization. The scientist's creative work is another matter. Kuhn states that \"the first half of the nineteenth century . . . witnessed a vast increase in the scale of the scientific enterprise, major changes in patterns of scientific organization, and a total reconstruction of scientific education.\" The processes accelerated in the second half of the century, especially with the growth of scientific education and research in the university system. 11\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nScientific societies with their own journals proliferated as old disciplines became \"professions with their own institutional forms,\" subsidized by both governments and private interests. New fields, like physics and biology previously \"clusters of research fields\" - jelled.28 The transformation of science did not necessarily mean that all old priests were replaced by new presbyters, as was clear in the survival of natural history. Modern science of high quality came to be increasingly associated with the existence of a university faculty; this was nearly axiomatic in provincial France, where the faculty of sciences was inevitably the only research and teaching institution in the region, and even in Paris the faculty of sciences accelerated the professionalization of science. In the new tower of Babel, specialist spoke only to specialist, the generalises color was abandoned for mathematical nuance, but the tower stood firm in the advancement of knowledge. Pas la couleur, rien que la nuance! Oh! la nuance seule fiance Le reve au reve.29 New laboratories and buildings, more professors and maitres de conferences attended by even more laboratory technicians, an increase in the quantity and quality of research, expansion of scientific education at all levels, and publication of monographs and journals: all highly desirable, even a necessity for a powerful program in science, and all expensive, virtually unattainable without substantial and steady funding. In the last century of French scientific growth, there is a possible paradox: For most of the period, there seems to have been low-level funding by a parsimonious state and less by private interests; yet France ended up as one of the world's few significant scientific and technological powers endowed with a powerful military technology. The simple escape from the paradox is to take the short-range view that the French science empire is of recent vintage, less than fifty years old. Certainly there is a great difference in scale between all aspects of the funding of science in the 1930s and in the 1980s. There are also important differences in the funding mechanisms of the two periods. Perhaps, in the end, the best explanation is that of sold souls. As Freeman Dyson said about the pact between Oppenheimer and Groves, the new position of science is the result of a Faustian pact between scientists and the military state. Historians are notoriously reluctant to admit the total novelty of any major intellectual or institutional change. So one can dimly detect the origin of the science empire in the late nineteenth century and certainly clearly see it in the first three decades of the twentieth century, with a mini-Faustian pact coming into existence during the First World War, chiefly as a result of the modest mobilization of scientists and as a result of the founding of new 12\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\norganizations for funding certain types of scientific research of direct interest to the state. In the midst of the supposed funding famine there was one area of French science that enjoyed the privilege of a perpetual financial feast. French science had too much money for prizes, for science done rather than to be done, rewarding achievement rather than encouraging research. We assume that people will do more and better science if they are paid for doing it rather than rewarded for having done it. After the founding of the Caisse des recherches scientifiques in 1901 France had an institution for funding individual research, resembling more a modern system of research grants than the Ecole pratique des hautes etudes, which funded individuals but not specific research programs. Once a professor was on the fiscal pipeline of the Ecole pratique, generally only retirement or death ended the subsidy. The Ecole had been a good beginning for stimulating research, but with the growth in the number of researchers it soon became inadequate. Unfortunately the legislation establishing the Caisse limited funding to biological research, chiefly medical research on diseases, especially TB and cancer, and problems of public health, water pollution in particular. Afflicted by legal limitations and paltry funds, the Caisse still established precedents in the type of funding and in procedures that fed into the different structure of funding arising in the late 1930s. In spite of local successes in promoting many areas of scientific research, some major areas like organic chemistry and optics remained weak. It was clear that only heavy state support could strengthen these areas significantly. But that type of support came only to big physics and aviation, and there were serious problems even there. As a result of the First World War there was a great leap forward in the state's funding of science - a certain practical type of science, it is true - with the establishment of the Direction (later Office) des inventions, presided over by J.-L. Breton. This was the largest funding mechanism in the history of French science until the founding of the Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) in 1939. For the first time there was an active, systematic policy promoting the marriage of science and technology, with cooperation between scientists and engineers; connections were forged between scientific and technological research and governmental departments, with some friendly and mildly profitable relations established with industry and the military. The Office was killed in 1938 by the Popular Front government with the active support of dissident scientists. But its death was the necessary prologue to the birth of the CNRS. By the 1930s a new generation of scientists, led by Jean Perrin, an old scientist turned young Turk, led a campaign to get \"big bucks\" for science. A mechanism controlled by scientists themselves would distribute these funds 13\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nto scientists doing the right kind of science, especially the new physics. The vices of the old scientists when practiced by the new generation were transformed into virtues. Between 1935 and 1939 three new funding and administrative organizations were created in France. The CNRS, replacing the others, was to rule over basic and applied research in France. 30 The big science phase of the CNRS, at least in American terms, would begin only with its new charter in 1959. The idea of a national funding mechanism for science had triumphed in the 1930s; a generation later the dreams of its promoters became the reality of some survivors of the 1930s and of a later group for whom the new structure and generous state support of science were the normal conditions of scientific life.\n\n14\n\n1 FROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC THE GREAT SCIENTIFIC MUTATION Le premier vice de notre systeme c'est que chez nous la recherche scientifique est subordonnee a la mission d'enseignement. - Maurice Barres, Pour la haute intelligence fran^aise ( 1 9 2 5 )\n\nThe bourgeois context\n\nI\n\nN spite of the \"rise of the bourgeoisie\" - a universal constant in Western history whose explanatory power is exceeded only by the formula \"It began with the Greeks\" - France was a peasant country in 1870. In 1814 the population of France was 29,000,000 rising to 36,000,000 in 1871, more than Great Britain's but nearly 5,000,000 less than Germany's. Between 1846 and 1859, and again the period 1890-1946, the reproductive rate fell below 1.00. Although there was a rise in the rate between 1860 and 1889, the French population stood at only 39,500,000 in 1914, less than Britain's and way below Germany's 67,800,000. No comparison of economic or educational systems can ignore the direct implications of different population bases. According to the 1891 census, 46 percent of the population was living off agriculture, 25 percent off industry, 1 3.5 percent off commerce and transportation, and 6.6 percent off the liberal professions.1 The second half of the nineteenth century saw a decline in the percentage of the active population in agriculture and domestic service and a corresponding growth in other sectors, but the structure of the active population was not radically modified. Yet enough profound change took place to justify the statement that a new France emerged between 1870 and 1914. Industrial output tripled, national income perhaps doubled, and real wages in industry increased 50 percent. French investment abroad increased 600 percent. Economic growth was unevenly distributed throughout the century: From 1840 to 1860 and from 1905 to 1914 were more rapid growth periods than 1860 to 1883, and the period from 1883 to 1896 was one of stagnation, except in metallurgy, chemicals, and electricity. Material change was slower in France than in England and Germany. In 1870 France was second in the world in terms of industrial production and trade, but it had fallen to fourth position in 1914, in spite of maintaining a favorable comparative per-capita production and rate of growth. The harsh judgment by Landes cannot be 15\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nreversed.2 \"The nineteenth century saw a unified Germany rise to Continental hegemony on the strength of the Ruhr and Silesia; while France, slower to industrialize, was never again to enjoy the pre-eminence to which the levee en masse and the genius of Napoleon had raised her on the eve of the economic revolution.\" 3 Traditional analysis tells us that about 1880 the segment of the bourgeoisie identified as haute lost political power to the moyenne segment, which dominated parliament and the cabinet after 1879 and kept its hold on the higher civil service posts until the rise of the petite bourgeoisie to political power after 1900. By 1914 the nouvelles couches sociales were well into a trajectory begun before 1870; a large proportion of the Radical deputies came from the petite bourgeoisie. There was a \"downward shift in the locus of political power.\" 4 But the social structure remained relatively stable. The arrival of the nouvelles couches was a slow process; even in 1881, 50 percent of parliament came from the upper bourgeoisie.5 Although between onequarter and one-third of the active population was in the \"industrial sector,\" and the sector was often pioneering, French industry was not expansionist. Career opportunities were supposedly better in commerce than in industry and engineering.6 But it was a society in which science and technology assumed a far more important role than ever before. The change downward in the social basis of political power was accompanied by an unprecedented expansion of the educational system and a steady growth of the liberal professions. Between 1876 and 1912 the number of medical doctors grew from about 11,000 to over 20,000. In 1831 the number of students in all secondary education was 60,4 3 2; by 1865 it was 140,253; by 1898 a slower growth had raised the number to 163,452. A 100-percent increase occurred between 1840 and 1880, although even by 1921 education was still only available to less than 5 percent of children. Financial aid was given to less than 8 percent of students. Education, especially at the secondary level, continued to be the preserve of the bourgeoisie, beyond the reach of most of the nation. 7 Higher education, especially in the grandes ecoles, was mostly an affair for the \"more affluent social groups,\" although 19 percent of the science students at the Ecole normale in the period 1868-79 came from the industrial and agricultural working classes.8 Social change and politics were closely connected. Noting the political dimension of the influence of the medical profession, Theodore Zeldin argues that \"its rise to power in the state is one of the striking features of the [nineteenth] century.\" There were 72 doctor deputies in 1898. Teachers made up over 6 percent of the deputies, doctors and pharmacists made up 11 percent, while lawyers continued to dominate the assembly with about one16\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nthird of the representatives.9 From the 1840s on, many teachers were pushed into republicanism by a harsh competitive system and political repression. An overcrowded legal profession also provided \"a principal ingredient of the intellectual proletariat of most towns.\" 10 Universal male suffrage enhanced the political importance of rhetoric, but the lawyers kept the republic conservative through \"effecting compromises\" in an administrative role. John Weiss has pointed out, however, that under the Third Republic few of the science teachers he studied were directly involved in politics; they had no ideological devotion to the scientistic cause but rather a practical view of politics as useful for personal advancement. The \"increasingly 'democratic' profile\" of science teachers from 1846 to 1881 was encouraged by the creation of an average of fifteen new posts annually. Bourgeois to the core, they were obsessed with their careers and social status, and presumably they loved the music of Meyerbeer, Halevy, Gounod, and Chopin - \"the music of the bourgeoisie\" - and could not understand Bizet.11 Jean Lhomme has picked 1880 as the date for the end of the period of the monopoly of political power by the grande bourgeoisie}1 If one accepts Lhomme's argument that the anticlericalism, antimilitarism, and socialism infecting the University made it suspect to the grande bourgeoisie, then one can argue that the passing of this group from political dominance and the political ascent of lower segments of the bourgeoisie, from which most University personnel originated, meant that the rulers and the University shared a common system of values more than ever before. The shift to secular republicanism in education paralleled the shift in the electorate and the government. Republicans tried to use the University as a creative source of ideology, purging or silencing dissenters with the help of its allies within.\n\nThe University During the reign of Napoleon I, French higher education became formally a function of the state. The University, a term including lycees, colleges (less complete lycees), and faculties, may have lost its independence, but its bondage to the state was handsomely rewarded by a monopoly that permitted private education only under strict University regulation. A real monopoly was jealously kept in higher education until 1875. Each chef-lieu d'academie had its faculties of letters and of sciences. If the University labored under a quasi-military discipline, it also suffered in the poverty and atmosphere characteristic of a poor convent. Each faculty got a subsidy from five to ten thousand francs and borrowed from the neighboring lycee and 17\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\ncommunal college their rhetoric and mathematics teachers; it had two or three other posts. Latin and mathematics were the foundation of lycee teaching; only with the Revolution had the sciences been admitted to a status comparable to that of classical languages. There were also twelve faculties of law and five faculties of medicine. By 1861 reorganization and expansion meant that France had sixteen faculties of letters, sixteen faculties of science, nine faculties of law, three faculties of medicine, three higher schools of pharmacy, twenty-two preparatory schools of medicine and pharmacy, and five schools preparatory to higher education in letters and in science.13 The decree of March 8, 1808, organizing the University instituted in each faculty three different degrees: baccalaureate, licence, and doctorate, all degrees attached to the faculty by the specific language of the diploma. On February 16, 1810, a statute, which was the work of the Conseil de FUniversite, established a distinction between three types of licence and stated the precise regulations for the doctorate. A formal division between the traditional three branches of science did not appear in 1822. There was no act instituting three distinct licences or doctorates, although reference was made to such a division in the regulations on examinations issued in June 1848. By the decree of January 22, 1896, there was established one licence es sciences and many certificates; three certificats d'etudes superieures would\n\nconstitute a licence. The Sorbonne had seventeen varieties of certified scientific cuisine. The new system permitted more flexibility in granting dispensations for people getting the doctorate; dispensations were rarely given before 1896 because the supplicant would have to be dispensed from the whole licence program - hardly recommended for anyone following the arduous route to the state doctorate. The new regime also made it possible for foreign and even French students to take the new University doctorate.14 More concerned with primary and secondary than with higher education, the July Monarchy did try after 1835 to revive the comatose higher creature by encouraging the growth of faculties in a few cities. In 1837 Salvandy (minister of education and grand maitre de V Universite) asked Thenard to inform him what was going on in the faculties - a short assignment for one of the world's greatest chemists. The minister wanted to know how to get the faculties to produce useful results. Baron Thenard was not long in producing a masterly report lamenting the ghastly shortage of human and material resources that rendered the University powerless. Even the faculty of sciences in Paris, with only fourteen chairs, did not have the resources necessary to fulfill its mission of training competent lycee teachers. Both the minister and Thenard would have liked all faculties to be as good as that in Paris. It was difficult enough even to create decent provincial 18\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nfaculties because of their small size and the paucity of professors waiting for nonexistent jobs. Montpellier and Lyon had seven science chairs each, Dijon and Caen had four each, and Grenoble had only three. The best that could be hoped for was that the government would adopt the Montpellier-Lyon model, ensuring that all the faculties would have the minimum number of basic professorships: physics, chemistry, zoology and animal physiology, botany and plant physiology, and mineralogy and geology. Five of the provincial faculties had only one professor to teach mineralogy, geology, botany and plant physiology, and zoology and animal physiology, subjects that made up six courses at the Sorbonne. This teaching load produced incomplete and superficial instruction with little if any research. This was a serious deficiency, Thenard argued, because \"the honor of the faculties requires professors to go beyond what is known.\" Public attention, the budding root of public support, would be attracted by the \"excellence of doctrines and the importance of discoveries,\" and students would be attracted by courses utilizing the works of the professors. The choice of professors should not depend solely on brilliant examination results and successful theses but on \"more irrefragable proofs of their scientific capacity,\" indeed, perhaps on a reputation based on original work. Another generation would fulfill the aims stated in Thenard's report. Low salaries and a shortage of chairs did not encourage bright young men to choose the obscure career of a provincial professor of science. Ah! if only France would imitate \"neighbouring countries where the students pay the professors.\" A final illusion: \"Les sciences menent souvent a la fortune.\"15 Thenard's report led to Salvandy's decision to increase the number of provincial faculty chairs. And faculties of science and of letters would be created in cities already having significant educational facilities, as in the cases of Lyon and Bordeaux. Towns having a number of studious young people in schools of law and medicine would also qualify for the creation of faculties of science and of letters. It was at this point, in 1838, that a faculty of sciences was established in Bordeaux, although with only six chairs, including only one for botany, mineralogy, and geology. The fact that the new faculty had only two chairs in natural science, while Toulouse had three, gave the Bordelais something to complain about. The important thing is that a faculty had been established, part of a slowly developing movement in higher education that would over the next half-century result in the creation of an extensive network of faculties providing local populations with services and opportunities in science, technology, and agriculture that did not exist even in serious fantasies at the beginning of the nineteenth century. It is difficult to contest, although necessary to modify in some respects, Prost's designation of the years 1800-80 as \"the long stagnation\" of the 19\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nUniversity, following the \"decadence\" of the Enlightenment. The chief function of the few professors in the faculties of arts and of sciences was to give the examinations for the baccalaureate, a degree granted after a faculty examination on subject matter learned in the lycee. During the Restoration this hybrid degree was established as the point of entry into the liberal professions through public education.16 Not much qualitative difference separated the baccalaureate from the licence. Early in the Third Republic, however, a group of professors from the sciences, especially in Lille, would denounce giving these examinations as a waste of the professor's time, which could be better devoted to research. Being paid for the examinations, the professors did not revolt. While at Lille, Pasteur proclaimed that \"the university professor must devote himself completely to teaching and scientific progress.\" But between 1854-5 and 1857-8 the number of baccalaureate candidates examined by the science faculty at Lille increased from 153 to 196; by 1874-5 the number was up to 375. The bac examination was a bloody affair in nineteenth-century France. In the examinations for 1862, when the success rate was up to over 55 percent from 45 percent the previous year, most weaknesses were in literature, chemistry, and natural history. In 1875, with 375 candidates for the sciences baccalaureate, 323 of whom wanted the baccalaureat complete the success rate was 40 percent for the complet and 38 percent for the restreint. The baccalaureat restreint, having less mathematics and more science, was intended for medical students.17 Throughout the Second Empire there were few candidates at Lille for the licence, the teaching degree between the baccalaureate and the doctorate; the increase in licence students had to wait for the introduction of scholarships and the expansion of secondary education by the Third Republic. In 1859 only one out of four passed the examinations for the license in mathematics and two out of four in the physical sciences. Possibly part of the weakness of candidates arose from the suppression of the baccalaureat es sciences mathematiques in 1852. Although the baccalaureate was excellent for those who wanted a liberal or an industrial career, it was insufficient for a teaching career because it barely reached the level of the class of special mathematics in the lycee. In 1862, when only one out of the four candidates passed, Girardin called for an intermediate degree between the baccalaureate and the licence in mathematics, because one of the major troubles with the licence was that it covered too much material. Since in the physical sciences candidates could not do the practical tests, there was a need to open up faculty laboratories to the lycee students for experiments. In 1877 there were eleven candidates at Lille for the three licences in mathematics and physical and natural sciences, and seven succeeded. Reform of the licence and the need for\n\n20\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nlycee personnel were directly related to the number of candidates turned out by the system.18 Not having a group of professional students, the physicist, if he wanted to have a role different from that of the lycee teacher, had to appeal to a general educated audience and especially had to show that his science was of practical use. Lallemand did this at Rennes, which even by the 1890s had no significant role for a scientist of the caliber of Pierre Duhem, who was also infuriated by the poverty of the library. Lallemand's idea of a course in physics (1855) was that it should include a detailed treatment of the most essential of the different parts of the science. It should be theoretical but use only elementary mathematics. Practical applications could have only a secondary emphasis, useful for exciting the interest of the audience and making it understand the degree of importance of the theoretical truths and experimental proofs whose methodical exposition made up the body of each lesson. But Lallemand argued that some extensive industrial developments of considerable importance required full lectures: The steam engine, the electric telegraph, and photography deserved detailed coverage, not merely to awaken the curiosity of the student but also to furnish him exact knowledge that he could use. Lallemand was here conforming to the model of industrial science, which probably existed in its purest form at Lille but was strongly represented in other provincial faculties.19 Toward the end of the Second Empire the practical applications of science were also being taught in night courses at Rennes. In 1869 the professors of chemistry, physics, and mechanics were giving courses. Massieu's course on the principles of mechanics and their application to machines filled the amphitheater with sixty persons, chiefly the heads of workshops, railroad workers, and arsenal and factory workers. The rector was delighted with the success of these courses, for they showed that the supposedly cold Bretons could become enthusiastic about useful and serious subjects taught with intelligence and talent.20 The regionalization of the University took root in the Second Empire. Having practically no genuine research students, professors in France's institutions of higher education turned to the general public for an audience. The Isocratic tradition was brilliantly upheld by Guizot, Villemain, and Cousin at the Sorbonne. Unfortunately, as Michelet and Renan discovered at the College de France in the Second Empire, the government could decide that the professor was teaching dangerous doctrines and suspend his courses. The philosopher Olle-Laprune was also a victim at the Ecole normale during the early years of the Third Republic. But because salaries were generally paid, the chief damage was to the professor's ego. Law, medicine, and pharmacy, under strict state regulation, kept to the narrow path of a 21\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nprofessional training whose parameters were set by examinations rather than by subject matter and research.21 Perhaps he was inhibited by the inherent dullness of his typical subject matter, but the scientist rarely ran into such problems. Apart from the stellar example of Cauchy - tax-farmer Lavoisier must be left aside - French scientists have a remarkable record of being faithful servants of the state and have had little difficulty in changing allegiances to regimes; of course, the nature of French politics in the nineteenth century with its giddy change of regimes might have encouraged such prudence. The ideological commitment of a substantial nucleus of the scientific community to the Third Republic is therefore more interesting than the support for other regimes. Perhaps it was partly a matter of hostile reaction to the excessive demands for loyalty made by the Second Empire. In its reorganization of the University, the Second Empire showed an unhealthy interest in the \"establishment\" in science, but its vices were anchored in the ideology of modernity. The government was thinking about the relationship between modernity and science at least as early as 1852. In a speech in April 1852 Hippolyte Fortoul, minister of education and religions, declared that \"the new University will tie its life to that of modern societies through a fuller organization of the teaching of science, source of the wealth and political supremacy of nations.\" 22 Such an important segment of the University had to be supervised by a hierarchy of scientists who were known for their support of the regime. The key functions of the inspection generate were given to Dumas, Le Verrier, Flourens, Regnault, and Cournot. The government checked out its key scientific personnel very carefully before giving them the reins of power. Flourens\\ frank rallying to the government was welcomed in view of his great influence in both letters and sciences. Dumas was at the top of science. In his inspection tours he was singled out as eminently fitted to discover and encourage gifted but forgotten personnel. The mathematical physicist Blanchet of the Ecole normale was to have a great future, due chiefly to his fine research work. Adolphe Brongniart's name carried great authority in science and his alliance with the Dumas family gave the government the surest of guarantees. Le Verrier, a member of the Senate, was a hero because of his boldness in instigating reforms in public education; his devotion to the government needed little comment. Cordier of the Museum was an ancien pair de France. Chasles was viewed as safe enough to have only his qualifications enumerated. Commissions investigated and reported on the observatory, the Bureau des longitudes, which were reorganized, and the Museum d'histoire naturelle. Scientists were on the commissions; the commission for the observatory and the Bureau was\n\n22\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nchaired by Fortoul with Biot as vice president, and it included Marechal Vaillant, Admiral Baudin, Dumas, Le Verrier, and Bivet (professor of astronomy at the College de France). 23 The New Atlantis would be built by a scientific estate with unquestioned loyalty to the new empire. As minister of education, Fortoul tried to establish a well-coordinated, smoothly functioning system. Fortoul gave \"science a new prominence in the curriculum of lycees.\" The triumvirate of Fortoul, Dumas, and Le Verrier reorganized secondary education by creating the system of bifurcation, introducing a baccalaureate in science parallel to the one in letters. Duruy abandoned the system in 1864. Good education had to be planned and closely supervised. No faculty should be independent of another; all higher education had an interlocking intellectual structure: The schools of medicine and pharmacy depended on the faculties of science for chemistry and natural history, at least in FortouTs plan of the 1850s. Fortoul also included the applied sciences in his grand scheme. The nature of the careers opened up by higher education encouraged the unity of the system. \"Puisque la force des choses et la nature meme des carrieres dont l'enseignement superieur ouvre Faeces amenent de continuels rapprochements, d'une part entre les differentes branches des sciences, de Tautre entre les sciences et les lettres, il importe que le haut enseignement, dans son ensemble et dans ses details, forme un tout proportionne et harmonieux, et que sous la variete infinie des aperc^us se cache une unite puissante et feconde.\" Courses of the faculties should be available to the greatest possible number of people. Thus it was important for Fortoul to know the methods used in teaching and the esprit characterizing the courses; no doubt the latter was more important for philosophy and history than for chemistry and natural history. It was FortouTs hope to give to higher education the precision it had lacked before. The advance of science could be best assured by following administrative rules, which would keep it on the right path, avoiding fruitless or whimsical digressions.24 No Homo ludens would be tolerated by this Napoleon of educational administration. Attempts were made to overcome the limitations imposed by the rigid structure of formal examination-centered courses in the faculties by the introduction of cours libres. In 1867 Duruy, a far less Draconian minister than Fortoul, proudly noted this significant development during the Second Empire. Thirty doctors were giving specialized courses in the faculty of medicine. About ten other professors had just been authorized to give courses in the sciences and in letters at the Sorbonne. These courses were all regular courses in higher education, very different from the 900 public lectures given all over France during 1867. Duruy made a point of emphasizing that the emperor and the country favored the development of private education in all\n\n23\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nforms and at all levels, just as they supported public education. Later observers and supporters of the cours libres would compare it in some respects to the German system of Privatdoignten.25 The official obsession with regulation eventually ensured the legitimation of the cours libres, which worried the educational bureaucrats because they were given by people who did not have an official function in the University. This problem was first solved for the Paris faculty of medicine and the former faculty of theology at Strasbourg. In 1882 it was recognized by the Ministry of Education that any regulation would have only the aim of promoting the progress of learning and science. Thus it was a simple matter when a person holding a doctorate in science or letters applied for permission to teach a course. But the ministry was aware that there could be cases where distinguished scientists did not have doctorates. The ministry showed its wisdom and liberality in deciding that if the opinion of the scientific community, stated by its most qualified members, was that a refusal to permit such persons to teach would deprive the faculties of useful teachers, then they should be given permission to teach a cours libre. Indeed, the ministry recognized that the French educational system had been too restrictive, especially in letters, and should have a greater variety of courses introduced without delay.26 In the 1880s and 1890s administrative decrees established the role of adjunct professors. A decree of December 28, 1885, declared that \"the title of adjunct professor may be given by decree, on the proposition of the faculty council, following the opinion of the permanent section of the Conseil superieur de l'instruction publique, to charges de cours and to maitres de conferences who have the degree of doctor and are distinguished by their service.\" Another decree of July 31, 1894, established that the number of adjunct professors in the faculties of science could be equal to one-third of the number of professorships. This was an attempt to reward personnel who deserved better than low positions in the system but who could not hope to get one of the limited number of chairs. It also made it possible to give them wider scope in teaching new courses and in doing research in the system. The government was genuinely concerned about the generally low level of the teaching of science in the provinces.27 It was the hope of Fortoul that the government could ensure the quality of the teaching of science in the provinces by insisting that appointments go to the best-qualified personnel. But an attempt to assign personnel on the basis of the best man for the job was soon foiled by the old-boy network and the passion of many scientists for the capital. In 1855 the botanist Duchartre and the zoologist Gratiolet ran the risk of incurring the permanent displeasure of the ministry because both refused provincial jobs. Fortoul\n\n24\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nwanted to establish the right of the ministry to determine who would get the jobs in Paris. His ideal was to reward merit and provincial service, thus bypassing the petty arrangements of the Parisian coteries. It was made clear that the ministry would not forget a refusal to accept a provincial post. Nickles and Berthelot were designated as two distinguished scientists who should give evidence of their professorial abilities in Besanqon and Strasbourg. Berthelot refused. Brongniart, Le Verrier, Dumas, and Thenard were key consultants for the minister in the shifting of personnel. Scientists were to be given an important share of the positions of rectors of academies. Thenard informed the minister that Masson, Abria, and Malagotti were three specialists in the physical sciences who deserved rectorats because of their writings, their discoveries, and their service; Thenard added that Dumas would probably also approve of this list. Le Verrier was consulted on the mathematician Vieille and Brongniart on the natural scientist Schimper, both potential rectors.28 With some notable exceptions, most French scientists spent some time in the provinces. Perhaps one can conclude that in the Second Empire service in the provinces became a built-in feature of the scientific establishment. The eventual result was the development of a respectable and sometimes solid structure of scientific research and teaching in the provincial faculties of Lyon, Nancy, Lille, Bordeaux, and in some other towns for some areas of science by the last decades of the nineteenth century.\n\nScrutiny: the inspection generale and the state of science One of the most distinctive features of French education was the system of inspecteurs generaux, which took on its definite form in the Napoleonic state. From the beginning, top scientists Like Coulomb and Cuvier played important roles in this system of assuring state control of the educational system.29 Titles varied from inspecteurs genetaux des etudes (An XIV) to inspecteurs generaux de VUniversite (1848) and inspecteurs generaux de I'instruction publique (1851). The number of inspectors reached thirty in the First Empire but was ruthlessly cut to twelve in 1815; raised to seventeen in 1824; the number was also cut back to twelve in 18 30. In 1840 the ecoles de pharmacie were attached to the University and after 1841 twenty ecoles preparatoires de medecine et de pharmacie were constituted on new bases; so by 1845 credits were reestablished for an inspecteur general des etudes medicales there had previously been two for medicine. The prestige of the posts in science was maintained during the Second Empire by Cournot, Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and then by Dumas, Le Verrier, and Brongniart. 25\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nAlthough the composition of the inspectorate might change with regimes several clergy were added in the 1820s - its basic functions did not. This was made clear in 18 5 1 under the Second Republic by Charles Giraud, minister of public education and religions, in a circular to the rectors of the academies encouraging them to lend their support to the inspectors. The inspector should take cognizance of all the details of administration. The minister noted that the presence of the inspector would increase the power of the rector, whose moral authority would be damaged if he attempted to conceal the real state of affairs or hide documents from the inspector. Being the direct representative of the central authority, the inspector had the same right to truth as the minister himself.30 According to the law of March 15, 1850, the inspecteurs d'academie were to be chosen from former inspectors, faculty professors, provisors and censors of lycees, principals of colleges, heads and teachers of higher classes of private secondary establishments, agreges of faculties and lycees, and primaryschool inspectors possessing a licence or having ten years' experience. For higher education the inspecteurs generaux included the same group plus former inspecteurs generaux, inspecteurs superieurs de Vinstruction publique, rectors and\n\ninspecteurs d'academie, as well as members of the Institut de France. In 1871 the government of national defense decreed the reorganization of inspectors into three categories for primary, secondary, and higher education, as in the decree of March 9, 1852, and gave them the old title of inspecteurs generaux de Vinstruction publique. The results of the inspections were also to be published in the Journal officiel de la Republique. In the finance law of December 29, 1876, the minimum salary of an inspector was fixed at 10,000 francs, the same as professors at the College de France and the Museum d'histoire naturelle. Profiting from the cumul process, some scientists did very well indeed. Balard made 7,500 francs annually at the College de France (before the general raise to 10,000 in 1876) and 12,000 francs as an inspecteur general. Le Verrier collected 30,000 francs annually in a triple capacity as inspector (12,500), professor in the faculty of sciences (12,500), and a member of the Bureau des longitudes (5,000), although he received no pay as the director of the observatory.31 It was not unusual for a scientist to fill one of his jobs with a junior man and pay him half the salary budgeted for the chair, which was an ingeniously cheap system for employing young academics, although open to a certain amount of abuse. The system for the approval of courses was simple. According to article 18 of a decree of August 22, 1854, the rector convoked the faculties either together or separately in order to deliberate on the individual programs of each course and to coordinate them. A ministerial circular of November 30, 26\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\n1855, detailed the division of instruction in the faculties. The ministry sent out an annual circular asking for the program of courses for the coming year. Each faculty then met and the professors presented their courses. The dean of each faculty sent the programs to the rector, who sent them to the ministry with his considered opinion. 32 The minister sent the programs to the appropriate inspectors for their opinions. Each inspector was responsible for examining the courses in his area before they were examined in the Comite de Inspection generale, under the minister himself during the Second Empire. Any remarks of the inspectors were sent to the faculties through the rectors of the academies. Although the rectors sent in the programs and the minutes of the meeting of the assembly of professors along with their covering report before July 31 (changed to April 15 in 1*856), there were complaints that the comments of the inspectors did not always arrive in time to be of use for the administrators and often arrived after the beginning of courses. Especially in Paris it was often difficult for the bureaucracy to get professors to give the necessary amount of detail on their courses. In 1861 the inspector of the Academy of Paris complained that only the programs for the courses in differential and integral calculus (Lefebure de Fourcy) and rational mechanics (Liouville) were detailed enough to show that they conformed to the needs of candidates for the licence. Having audited some of the other courses, the inspector knew that they did conform to the licence requirements, but that did not excuse the professors from carrying out a ministerial request for detailed programs. The inspector noted that there seemed to be a tendency on the part of some professors to escape from any type of regulation in order to preserve full liberty as long as possible. He hastened to add that not too much importance should be attached to this observation! The programs for 1861-2 were fully detailed. By 1865-6 they were back to skeletal form with references to the official programs for details.33 Unless there were changes in the official program it did seem rather pointless to keep repeating the same thing. The functioning of the system of inspectors in higher education, considered only in relation to its impact on the teaching and content of courses in science, can best be seen by taking a look at specific cases in the various academies. Sometimes the impact might be just a minor modification of a course. In 1865 the Comite de F inspection generale noted that Clos had submitted for his course in botany at Toulouse a good program, sufficiently detailed, but that it would perhaps be better in the existing state of science to shorten the twelve lectures devoted to summing up organography, in order to devote a few more lectures to cryptograms because of their unusual structure. In his reply to the ministry and to inspector Brongniart, Clos 27\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nrecognized the correctness of the comment but pointed out that according to instructions sent out in 1855 there should be from twelve to fifteen introductory lectures. Naturally the progress of science would change the viewpoint of the inspection generate over a period of ten years. Clos suggested that the change should be implemented by means of a general observation inserted in a circular rather than by personal observation. Thus a professor would not be rewarded by a painful surprise for following the rules strictly. This incident shows the professor in the bureaucratic system being prudent to the extent of following the rules more strictly than the inspector; it also shows the value of the inspector as an agent of change in a system whose extensive guidelines were a threat to innovation, even when scientific progress justified it. The system of inspection could also be an effective weapon against professorial inertia as well as a means of maintaining quality control in the teaching of science. Of course, the inspection generate had the potential for exerting undesirable influence, especially if the inspector was an important scientist not in favor of certain new trends in his discipline, but this was rare and certainly did not work over long periods of time. 34 It was also in 1865 that the Comite de Inspection generate voiced its fear that Leymerie, the professor of mineralogy and geology, might have planned a course in mineralogy that was too advanced and theoretical for the students at Toulouse. But it was left up to Leymerie to decide if there was really a problem and what its solution would be. He did not agree with the committee. The program had been the same for twenty-five years except for the improvements based on experience. No doubt such a serious course could not be followed by a large audience, but it did satisfy young men who wanted good solid instruction, especially the candidates for the licence es sciences physiques and even the candidates for the licence es sciences naturelles.\n\nLeymerie admitted that he was not much interested in people who came to courses in order to pass time. In any case, the number of serious students had grown every year since he had pioneered in establishing \"la belle science de Haiiy\" in the region. Leymerie had eliminated from his course elements of chemistry and optics better given in other courses. This increased its popularity, partly due to his gift for clear exposition, which was also clearly seen in the very favorable reception given his two-volume work on mineralogy. After a spirited defense of his course, Leymerie made some tactical concessions: He would abridge certain developments in crystallography and give a few more lectures describing mineral species. Brongniart concluded that it was not necessary to ask Leymerie for another program, although it would be useful to call his attention to some modifications he himself recognized as possible. Both sides could retreat with honor. The affair had been precipitated by a letter of the proviseur of the Lycee 28\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nimperial de Toulouse to the inspector of the Academie de Toulouse complaining about the situation in natural history. There was a lack of agreement between the program of scientific studies in the lycee, which had eleven to twelve lectures for zoology, four to six for botany, and five to six for geology, and the program of the baccalaureate in the sciences, which had eighteen, twelve, and ten lectures respectively for the same subjects. The lycee pupils could not be properly prepared for the baccalaureat es sciences. The demands of Leymerie in mineralogy when he was on the jury made the difficulty even greater. It was a situation requiring reorganization or diplomatic pressure on Leymerie; choosing the latter option could hardly do more than improve the situation slightly.35 The need to keep within the guidelines of the licence program had the dangerous potential of bringing institutional power to bear against desirable innovations and of keeping topics out of courses until officially approved. But there was a certain flexibility. The first part of the course in zoology and animal physiology was devoted to histology (\"microscopic anatomy\"). In 1865 the inspector noted that at Strasbourg there were perhaps too many lectures given in histology. This touched a raw nerve in the Strasbourg faculty of sciences. It had been taught there before it was introduced in Paris, in fact since 1838, when Lereboullet was named to the chair of zoology and introduced it into public courses in 1840. Being the indispensable basis of any solid physiology, histology was one of the most important parts of the course. Because histology was not taught in the medical faculty as a special subject, the course given in the science faculty was vital for medical students, who learned to use the microscope to examine tissues. The number of sessions had been reduced from twenty to fifteen; in view of important developments since 1840, it was impossible to reduce this minimal number.36 Among the inspectors Adolphe Brongniart seems to have been one of the most vigilant in indicating to delinquent professors the deficiencies of their programs and their failure to comply with ministerial instructions. In 1864 the program in geology and mineralogy of Lesques at Marseille was brought under scrutiny in the Comite de 1' inspection generate because he was not keeping within the specialty of his chair. Instead of a course in geology and mineralogy he was teaching paleontological zoology. For this subject to be given by Lesques it would have to be treated from the viewpoint of stratigraphic geology based on paleontology. A geology course could not be a front for a zoology course. After an attempt to justify his position, Lesques submitted a new program conforming to the nature of the chair he occupied.37 Claude Jourdan of Lyon had his zoology course done at the printer and simply put in the dates. This type of standardization brought the less typical observation from the ministry that some variation in the course 29\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\ncould be achieved by a few modifications, such as giving more emphasis to molluscs, reptiles, and zoophytes, so important for paleontological geology. More typical of the bureaucratic reactions to programs were the requests that Fournet (Lyon) furnish the coverage of each of the six divisions of his geology course and that Faivre (Lyon) indicate the time he would give to each subject in his botany course as well as supply more detail than that given in his summary.38 The ideal was to maintain a balance between the old and the new. In 1865 Rouville of Montpellier was congratulated for keeping up on the recent works in mineralogy but was also warned that concern for the latest novelty in science should not lead him to forget the older and basic parts.39 The idea of science as a cumulative enterprise led to the policy neatly put in Pope's advice to be not the first by whom the new is tried, nor yet the last to cast the old aside. Sometimes the demands of the system for general courses covering a wide range of topics clashed with the trend in science toward specialization. This clash could be interpreted, to some extent, as a clash of generations in the scientific community. The situation at Lille in 1864 illustrates the problems involved. On August 15 the ministry informed the rector that the examination of the program of Dareste's course in the natural sciences by the Comite de Tinspection generale showed that the topics treated were much too specialized. Although the topics had been the object of Dareste's research, it would deflect the faculties from their aim if specialties were admitted just because of the professor's research work, which was a reason advanced by Dareste to justify his course. A follow-up letter of Brongniart to Petit, head of the first division of the ministry, noted that Dareste's course needed modification. Another series of exchanges followed about Dareste's proposed lectures for the first semester of 1864. The rector asked the ministry if Dareste could devote the semester to the study of animal generation and embryogeny. Since the rector agreed with the ministry that the subject was too limited to inspire much interest in the young people taking natural history, mostly from the preparatory school of medicine and pharmacy, Dareste did not have much of a chance of getting his way. By November Brongniart was able to report to the ministry that Dareste had taken care of most of the objections to his course. Now, however, Brongniart agreed with Dareste's justification of embryology, which made up a big part of the course as a consequence of the serious treatment of generation.40 It seems that in the face of professorial determination to change courses according to new developments in science, even sacred ministerial programs were not totally inflexible. In the excessively integrated French system problems developed when one part of the system made an innovation not simultaneously introduced into 30\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nthe other parts. For Berthelot (College de France), atomic theory was subtle, ingenious, and novel, but it dealt with numerical relations, not the bodies themselves. In 1875, with the creation of the chair of organic chemistry for Wurtz, the Sorbonne became an effective counterforce to Berthelot's doubts and opposition. Berthelot's resistance to atomic theory in chemistry did not mean that he kept it out of the system. Mice adopted it for his course in chemistry and toxiology at Bordeaux. The rector reported this to the ministry in 1875, noting the problem involved. Even the best-prepared students, medical students who had the baccalaureat es lettres and the baccalaureat es sciences (either complet or restreint), had some trouble in making the transition from enseignement secondaire classique to higher education. The situation was similar for the first-class pharmacy students. What was an advantage for students exclusively in the physical sciences was a disadvantage for those aiming at other careers. The real problem was for the second-class pharmacy students, who, having only a certificat de grammaire, were woefully ignorant. The rector declared that there was no relation between this category of students and Mice's program. There was also the general problem of reconciling the bad preparation of these students with the nature of higher education.41 The problem pointed out the need for basic reform in the system itself. In 1855 the Comite de Tinspection generale, to which the minister submitted all course programs, examined the science program as a whole and made some pertinent observations. The courses should be done in two years, as in Paris; this was sometimes difficult in one or two of the provincial faculties, which took three years for the licence program. The basis for the science programs was the examinations for the licence. Because it was not easy to cover all the material in such a short time, hard decisions had to be made on topics and the depth of treatment. In physics one-third of the course had to be devoted to the most indispensable and most general ideas, including the general properties of matter, the laws and applications of gravity and of heat. Emphasizing practical utility, the professor would give this part of the course in twenty to twenty-five lectures as detailed and analytic as possible. The remaining forty lectures did not permit a similar detailed treatment of other topics like light and electricity and magnetism; so a summary-type approach had to be used. The same procedure was employed for chemistry. In the twenty to twenty-five lectures the professor would treat the important subject of nonmetallic elements - e.g., chlorine, hydrogen, and oxygen - and in the forty lectures of the second semester he would give a comparison of metallic bodies and organic substances. Paris had the advantage of having the complementary courses of the College de France, the faculty of medicine, and the Museum, but the programs of the faculty of sci31\n\nFROM KNOWLEDGE TO POWER\n\nences were the same as elsewhere in order to ensure uniformity in the system. 42 Although the communication of personal research and opinion was still allowed and, indeed, recognized as one of the prerogatives of the University professor, it would have to be done in other lectures, not in the time allotted to the official programs. The committee also recognized that supplementary lectures were desirable for local industrial purposes: Lectures in chemical processes related to the sugar industry would be quite valuable at Lille. There was a need to announce practical courses that would give the University a role in national production. By pursuing this policy the faculties of science could become popular much more rapidly than would be the case if they limited themselves to official programs. In reality, the provincial faculties needed little encouragment in this direction. 43 Even in Paris the Second Empire's University courses were nearly all organized according to the program of the licence es sciences and brought into agreement with the division of studies at the Ecole normale superieure. Two exceptions were the courses in higher mathematics - higher geometry taught by Chasles and the calculus of probabilities (including mathematical physics in the 1860s) taught by Lame. Outside the licence program, the material of these courses was better suited for doctoral candidates. By 1870 four courses could be defined as having the speculative character of the courses offered by the College de France: the mathematical courses of Chasles, Hermite, and Briot and the mathematical astronomy of Puiseux. In the 1870s the general nature of the licence courses in physics and chemistry was complemented by the addition of specialized courses that could accommodate the advances made in both disciplines. By 1878, in physics, Desains dealt with heat, magnetism, electricity, electro-magnetism, and their chief applications, and Jamin covered acoustics and optics. In chemistry Sainte-Claire Deville dealt with the general laws of chemistry and the history of metalloids, Troost was concerned with metals as well as organic chemistry, and Wurtz gave special attention to the aromatic series. Physics and chemistry were moving toward providing the type of specialized, high-level courses long associated with mathematics. Such courses were vital for the doctoral program that had taken on new life in the laboratories funded through the Ecole pratique des hautes etudes. The production of licence students, however, remained the biggest educational business of the University. Cardwell has lamented the fact that mid-nineteenth-century Oxford and Cambridge were really high-class lycees.44 This situation was not unknown on the Continent, as was made clear in the report of A. Bertin on his physics course for 185 5-6 at Strasbourg. In order for teaching in the faculties to be really higher education, the programs had to be those for the licence. But 32\n\nFROM SECOND EMPIRE TO THIRD REPUBLIC\n\nthere were too few licence students to justify a special course for them. Bertin gave a third lecture each week in which he dealt with the more difficult parts of physics, especially modern optics. Unlike Leymerie, Bertin adjusted the level of the course to the average capacity of the auditors. Not having a suitable amphitheater, the faculty was unable to attract the class of people who Like to give a certain part of their leisure to the study of the sciences. So physics in Strasbourg was taken by mostly young men who were candidates for the baccalaureat es sciences and who could only follow elementary physics as taught in the lycee. In 1855-6 Gerhardt's course in chemistry was found to be too abstract by the inspector, who recommended that he follow the University program closer. In a report to the Directeur de Tenseignement superieur, Berthelot found courses too close to lycee courses at Clermont, Grenoble (first part of chemistry course), Marseille (chemistry), and Nancy (chemistry). The Strasbourg situation was aggravated by the fact that many of the students were in the army and found continuity difficult in their studies due to changing garrison frequently.45 The general problem, existing in all French science faculties, would not be solved until the state created a professional student class through scholarships. Lack of facilities and of equipment was the eternal complaint of the scientific community. In 1856 the faculty and the dean at Rennes indicated the insufficiency of material for demonstrations. Zoology and geology needed models; physics, although classified as \"assez riche,\" still needed new instruments;"
