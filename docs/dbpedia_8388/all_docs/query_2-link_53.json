The extent of the differentiation and the level of significance of the barriers will determine what kind of general market structure the market will take. Barriers to entry will determine both number of firms in the market and whether it will be easy for new firms to enter. Generally higher barriers to entry entail fewer firms and difficult entry to the market. Though other factors like market size and symmetric information does play a part in determining market structure, lets assume all else constant(ceterus paribus) If the products are homogeneous, there may exist a cournot equilibrium in quantity supplied where the firms guess each other's intended output, and hedge their output on their rival's most probable output. Such a condition would mean that the firm just sets output based on intelligent guesses, but takes whatever price is set by market forces.(they cannot set prices because products are NOT differentiated) . The larger the number of firms, the lower the market share . The larger number of firms means that they face a residual demand based on the number of firms . The elasticity faced by each firm would be n-times the market elasticity, where n is the number of firms. Thus, given homogeneous products the firm's demand curve will be more elastic(based on the number of firms) than the market elasticity(which is also based on n, higher number of firms, closer elasticity is to zero). Competition is deemed inperfect, however, if number of firms is not sufficiently large. This could be due to high barriers to entry(airlines) or other factors. For differentiated products but relatively low barriers to entry, there is the monopolistic competitive market(NOT to be confused with monopoly, which will be touched upon later). In this market, each firm only supplies a small proportion of the total market's total quantity supplied(a change in quantity by the firm will not affect market price). In this case, each firm will generally have a residual demand curve- meaning it will supply whatever the other firms won't or can't, at a particular price. In such an industry, when a firm is faced with a residual demand,the firm's demand curve will be very much more elastic(flatter) than the market's demand curve. Similar to homogeneous products, just that each firm has some market power to set its own price for its goods but not enough to influence market price. For Markets with only a few or several large firms each with significant market share and differentiated products(oligopoly), the fact that the demand curve is kinked means that there is no way to tell whether the demand curve facing the firm will be steeper than the market demand curve as the firm's demand curve has two distinct sections with two different elasticities(slopes). For markets where there is only ONE producer(monopoly) the market demand curve is the firm's demand curve. Thus it will have the same elasticity as the market's demand curve. Thus the firm's demand curve is expected to be flatter(more elastic) or as flat(elastic) as the market's demand curve, except in the case of an oligopoly where the firm's demand curve has more than one slope.

Hereâ€™s a detailed comparison: Resource Allocation in Competitive Markets Price Mechanism: In a perfectly competitive market, prices are determined by supply and demand. Firms are price takers and must accept the market price. Efficiency: Allocative Efficiency: Resources are allocated where they are most valued by consumers, as prices reflect the marginal cost of production. Productive Efficiency: Firms produce at the lowest point on their average cost curve due to competitive pressures. Consumer Welfare: Consumers benefit from lower prices and a wide variety of goods and services due to intense competition. Resource Allocation in Oligopolies Price Setting: In an oligopoly, a few large firms dominate the market. These firms have significant control over prices and can influence market conditions. Efficiency: Allocative Efficiency: Often compromised because firms have the power to set prices above marginal cost, leading to higher prices and reduced output compared to a competitive market. Productive Efficiency: May be less efficient than in competitive markets due to less pressure to minimize costs. However, large firms may benefit from economies of scale, which can improve productive efficiency. Consumer Welfare: Typically lower compared to competitive markets because higher prices and limited choices reduce consumer surplus. Key Differences Market Power: In competitive markets, firms have little to no market power, leading to optimal pricing and output decisions. In oligopolies, firms have significant market power, which can lead to higher prices and reduced output. Barriers to Entry: Competitive markets have low barriers to entry, encouraging new firms to enter and drive innovation and efficiency. Oligopolies often have high barriers to entry, reducing competition and potentially leading to inefficiencies. Innovation: Competitive markets drive innovation as firms constantly strive to outperform their rivals. Oligopolies might have more resources for R&amp;D, potentially leading to significant innovations. However, the lack of competitive pressure can sometimes lead to complacency. Theoretical Perspectives Cournot Model: Assumes firms compete on quantity. Oligopolies produce more than a monopoly but less than a competitive market, leading to higher prices than in perfect competition. Bertrand Model: Assumes firms compete on price. If firms set prices, it can lead to a situation akin to perfect competition with low prices, but this depends on the assumption of identical products and no capacity constraints. Kinked Demand Curve: Suggests that firms in oligopolies are hesitant to change prices due to potential competitive reactions, leading to price rigidity. Empirical Evidence Studies have shown that oligopolistic markets often exhibit higher prices and lower output than competitive markets, supporting the theoretical predictions of reduced allocative efficiency. For example, the airline industry, characterized by a few dominant carriers, often shows higher prices on routes with less competition. Conclusion Overall, oligopolies tend to be less efficient in resource allocation compared to competitive markets. They can lead to higher prices, reduced output, and potentially lower levels of innovation and consumer welfare. However, the potential for economies of scale and significant R&amp;D investments in oligopolies can sometimes offset these inefficiencies to some extent. For a more in-depth analysis, references from economic textbooks and empirical studies such as those found in journals like the Journal of Economic Perspectives or The Quarterly Journal of Economics can provide further insights."
