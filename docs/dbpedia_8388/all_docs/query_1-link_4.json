Antoine Augustin Cournot was a French philosopher, mathematician, and economist born in 1801. He made contributions to economics, developing theories on monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies that are still used today. Cournot introduced concepts of functions and probability into economic analysis and was one of the first to graphically depict supply and demand curves. He is best known for his work in oligopoly theory and Cournot competition model. Cournot believed that mathematics could be used to establish probable economic limits and express unstable facts more absolutely.",
