Acts are laws passed in the Thai parliament and contain detailed descriptions of various aspects of employment in the country. Decrees, issued by the monarch, concern specific features of employment. Ministerial regulations are not passed in the parliament; they also address the distinct characteristics of employment in Thailand.Â\n\nLaws in Thailand are typically thoroughly detailed and go into the specifics of employment, the conditions under which people can be employed, and the contractual obligations of both the employer and the employee. Some of the provisions of employment laws to note before hiring in Thailand are as follows.\n\nTitle Explanation Workmenâs Compensation Act (1994) The Workmenâs Compensation Act serves as a replacement for the employerâs liability if the employee meets with an accident during employment. It establishes an Accident Fund to compensate employees for injury, sickness, disease, or death that results directly from employment. Labor Protection Act (1998) The Labor Protection Act is the primary piece of legislation that regulates employment in Thailand. It details the employment of different categories of citizens and the types of employment that they can undertake. It talks about the wages to be paid, welfare provisions for labor, holidays, termination, and several other aspects of employment in the country. Labor Relations Act (1975) The Labor Relations Act deals with the association between labor and employers. It lays out the guidelines for the settlement of disputes between employers and employees and sets out the working conditions to which employees are entitled. Further, it addresses how to up labor unions and employer associations. Occupational Safety, Health, and Environment Act (1970) The Occupational Safety, Health, and Environment Act assigns the employer the obligation to provide employees with working conditions that do not harm them or lead to physical or mental damage. Employers must provide employees with an environment that actively promotes and supports their performance.\n\nâTimings, Holidays, and Leave Policies in Thailand\n\nEntitlements Explanations Statutory working hours A general workday in Thailand is eight hours. An employee can work for a maximum of 48 working hours a week. For work in which the employees are in harmâs way, this is seven hours a day for a maximum of 42 hours a week. Rest period After every five hours of work, employers must provide employees with at least one hour of rest. There must be a minimum of one rest day every week. Public holidays Several national holidays are offered to every employee in Thailand. These holidays are as follows.\n\nJanuary 1-2, New Yearâs Day\n\nFebruary 26, Compensation for Makha Bucha Day\n\nApril 8, Compensation for the day of His Majesty King Buddha Yodfa Chulalok the Great and Chakkri Dynasty Memorial Day\n\nApril 15-16, Songkran Day\n\nMay 1, National Labour Day\n\nMay 6, Compensation for Coronation Day\n\nMay 22, Visakha Bucha Day\n\nJune 3, Her Majesty Queen Suthida's Birthday Her Royal Highness Princess Patcharasudhabimalalaksana\n\nJuly 22, Compensation for Asarnha Bucha Day\n\nJuly 29, Compensation for His Majesty the King's birthday\n\nAugust 12, The Queen Mother of the Queen Mother and Mother's Day\n\nOctober 13, H.M. King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Great Memorial Day\n\nOctober 23, Chulalongkorn Day\n\nDecember 5, H.M. King Bhumibol Adulyadej The Greatâs Birthday\n\nMaternity leave Mother is entitled to 90 days of maternity leave, where 45 of these days are paid. The remaining days can be paid depending on the employer's agreement.

Contact Skuad experts to know more.\n\nContractors vs. Full-time Employees\n\nThailand has a growing population of educated youth. A highly skilled and employable population has attracted several companies to hire in Thailand.\n\nThe regulations related to contractual and full-time employment are not significantly different in Thailand. The employment contract contains the period of employment of the respective employee.\n\nFull-time employees will typically be employed indefinitely, while part-time and contractual employees will typically have their period of employment mentioned in their contract.Â\n\nAs per Thai law, the same provisions and benefits are extended to contractual, part-time, and full-time employees. The law does not discriminate considerably among different types of employment.\n\nEOR partners such as Skuad can take both part-time and full-time employees on their payroll. Regardless of what your employment requirements are, Skuad is fully capable of fulfilling them within a short period. Book a demo with us to learn more.\n\nScope of Negotiating Terms\n\nWhen it comes to the negotiation of terms in Thailand, the scope is limited. Thanks to the Thai employment hierarchy structure, employees who belong to lower and middle levels of management do not have much of a say regarding their compensation and benefits.Â\n\nThe hierarchical structure of employment suggests that seniority is an important aspect of employment in Thailand. The compensation can increase significantly as you move from junior to senior levels. Alongside the compensation, benefits also increase, and you can expect to receive more than the statutory requirement as you climb the organizational ladder.\n\nWhen applying for a senior position, you are also more likely to be enlisted by the HR team. This is because as seniority increases, the available talent for the position decreases, providing you with greater leverage to determine your salary and the benefits associated with it.\n\nYou can get in touch with a Skuad expert to find out more about Thailandâs workplace structure and what to expect when you start expanding your business there.\n\nHiring in Thailand\n\nThe process of recruitment has become standardized with the increased reach of the Internet. Companies hire remotely without scheduling physical interviews. Posting job requirements on professional websites is a common practice. While LinkedIn isnât as popular a hiring platform in Thailand as in other countries, Thailand has its own set of local job portals like JobsDB and Ajarn that aid people in obtaining jobs. Employers choose to post their candidate requirements on these portals so that applicants can access them remotely.\n\nHiring begins with drafting a job description followed by screening, shortlisting, interview, and selection.Â Some roles may require candidates to pass a written test.\n\nEOR partners such as Skuad can aid you in the process of hiring. From scouting candidates to organizing the interview process, Skuad can be immensely helpful in acquiring the best talent from across the country.\n\nProbation & Termination\n\nProbation Laws in Thailand\n\nThai law mentions probation in passing. It talks about the ability of the employer and the employee to determine the duration of the probation period through mutual agreement. However, it does not delve into the specifics of the probationary period or further details.\n\nHowever, the probation should not exceed 119 days because Thai law states that employers have to provide employees severance pay if they are terminated after 120 days. Therefore, this is a significant gray area and must be avoided to prevent disputes.\n\nTermination of Employment\n\nThe employer can terminate an employee unilaterally if the employee is guilty of gross misconduct such as dishonesty in duty, violations of the contract, or sentenced by a court of law. No notice or compensation is required in instances such as these.\n\nIn other cases where the employer chooses to unilaterally dismiss an employee, a notice period must be provided. The employer may also provide the employee with compensation for the notice period and dismiss the employee immediately.\n\nTermination of employment must be handled with care since it involves considerable risks for the employer. To better manage termination and other hiring-related processes in Thailand, get in touch with Skuad.\n\nEOR Solution\n\nDue to the details and the many intricacies involved in it, Thai employment and labor law can be hard to understand for someone who has never dealt with or employed people in Thailand before.
