Whilst, in the reverses, mostly the picture of notable kings and kings with the title \"the great\". Some reverses feature the King Bhumibol's sayings.\n\nIn 1851, the government issued notes for 1⁄8, 1⁄4, 3⁄8, 1⁄2, and 1 tical, followed by 3, 4, 6, and 10 tamlueng in 1853. After 1857, notes for 20 and 40 ticals were issued, also bearing their values in Straits dollars and Indian rupees. Undated notes were also issued before 1868 for 5, 7, 8, 12, and 15 tamlueng, and 1 chang. One att notes were issued in 1874.\n\nIn 1892, the treasury contracted with Giesecke & Devrient in Germany to print notes for 1, 5, 10, 40, 80, 100, 400, and 800 ticals, called \"baht\" in the Thai text. They were delivered to the Siamese Treasury, but never issued. Eventually the notes held in reserve were destroyed, with only a few remainders saved.\n\nThe year 1902 marked the introduction of reforms by prince Jayanta Mongkol after his observations of banking practices in Europe, which became an important landmark in the inauguration of paper money in Thailand.[1] On September 19, 1902, the government introduced notes which were printed by Thomas De La Rue & Company Limited, England, during the reigns of Kings Rama V and Rama VI, denominated 5, 10, 20, 100, and 1000 ticals, still called baht in the Thai text — each denomination having many types,[2] with 1 and 50 tical notes following in 1918. In 1925, notes were issued in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100, and 1,000 baht with the denomination in both Arabic and Thai numerals without English text;[3] English speakers continued to refer to these as \"ticals\".[4]\n\nIn 1942, the Bank of Thailand was founded and took over responsibility for the issuance of paper money. 50 baht notes were briefly reintroduced in 1945, with 50 satang notes issued in 1946. The one baht note was replaced by a coin in 1957 and the five baht was replaced in 1972. 50 baht notes were again reintroduced in 1985, with the 10 baht note replaced by a coin in 1988. The EURion constellation has been used on the reverse of 100 and 1000 baht notes since 2003. Older notes are occasionally still found in circulation, for example, 10 baht notes, and these can usually be spent without problem. In any case, they can be exchanged for free in banks.\n\nThe 15th series are the oldest circulating banknotes in Thailand. They were issued throughout the year 2003 – 2005. The banknotes can still be seen and used in common manners.\n\nMore information Value, Dimensions ...\n\n15th series banknotes Archived 2013-02-20 at the Wayback Machine ValueDimensionsMain colourDescriptionDate of issue ObverseReverse 20 baht138 × 72 mmGreen King Bhumibol Adulyadej (1927–2016) in the uniform of the Supreme head of the armed forces King Ananda Mahidol (1925–1946), and his visiting Sampheng with King Bhumibol, Rama VIII Bridge3 March 2003 50 baht144 × 72 mmBlue King Mongkut (1804–1868), astronomical tools, Phra Pathom Chedi19 March 2004 100 baht150 × 72 mmRed\n\nType I: King Chulalongkorn (1853–1910) and the abolition of slavery in Thailand\n\nType II: The statue of King Chulalongkorn and King Vajiravudh at the Chulalongkorn University\n\n21 October 2005 500 baht156 × 72 mmPurple Statue of King Nangklao (1788–1851) at Laan Phlub Phla Maha Jedsada Bodin, Loha Prasat at Wat Ratchanatdaram1 August 2001 1,000 baht162 × 72 mmBrown King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Pa Sak Jolasid Dam25 November 2005\n\nClose\n\nMore information 16th series banknotes, Value ...\n\n16th series banknotes[5] ValueDimensionsMain colourDescriptionDate of issue ObverseReverse 20 baht[6]138 × 72 mmGreen King Bhumibol Adulyadej in the Royal House of Chakri gown King Ram Khamhaeng (1247–1298) on the Manangkhasila Asana Throne monument, invention of the Thai script, Ramkhamhaeng stele1 April 2013[7] 50 baht[8]144 × 72 mmBlue King Naresuan (1555–1605) pouring water for declaration of independence monument, King Naresuan during the Great on war elephant, Phra Chedi Chai Mongkol18 January 2012[9] 100 baht[10]150 × 72 mmRed King Taksin the Great (1734–1782) monument at the Wongwian Yai circle, Thonburi palace, Wi Chai Prasit Fortress26 February 2015[11] 500 baht[12]156 × 72 mmViolet King Buddha Yodfa Chulalok (1737–1809) monument at the Saphan Phut, Chedis at Wat Pho, Phra Sumen Fort 12 May 2014[13] 1,000 baht[14]162 × 72 mmBrown King Chulalongkron, the Great, the Equestrian statue of King Chulalongkorn at the Royal Plaza, Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, end-of-slavery declaration of Siam 21 August 2015[15]\n\nClose\n\nIn 2016, after the passing of King Bhumibol, the Bank of Thailand issued the special series \"The tribute to the great King Bhumibol\".

The 20 baht was selected to be changed from paper to polymer to improve the quality as it is the most widely used banknote and hence quickly gets soiled and damaged. The new banknote has the same design as before with some additional polymer-note security features.[16]\n\nMore information 17th series banknotes, Value ...\n\n17th series banknotes[17] ValueDimensionsMain colourDescriptionDate of issue ObverseReverse Left Right 20 baht138 × 72 mmGreen King Vajiralongkorn in the uniform of the commander of the Royal Thai Air Force King Phutthayotfa Chulalok and Grand Palace King Phutthaloetla Naphalai and Thai mural of a scene from Enau6 April 2018 (paper) and 24 March 2022 (polymer) 50 baht144 × 72 mmBlue King Nangklao and a Chinese junk King Mongkut and Khao Wang6 April 2018 100 baht150 × 72 mmRed King Chulalongkorn and his royal trip to visit Haakon VII of Norway in Norway.
