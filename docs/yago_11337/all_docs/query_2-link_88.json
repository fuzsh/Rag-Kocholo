        "text": "SD 36.10 10 D 26/3:58-79 • Cakka,vatti Sīha,nāda <strong>Sutta</strong> Cakka,vatti Sha,nāda <strong>Sutta</strong> <strong>The</strong> Discourse on the Lion-roar of the Wheel-turner | D 26/3:58-79 <strong>The</strong>me: Political power and spiritual power Translated by Piya Tan ©2008 For Ng Yeow Tang (Dharma Propagation Director) & Nanyang Technological University Buddhist Society, 2008 1 <strong>Sutta</strong> summary and highlights 1.1 SUTTA SUMMARY. <strong>The</strong> Cakka,vatti Sīha,nāda <strong>Sutta</strong> (D 26) gives an account of the wheelturner or universal monarch (cakka,vatti) [2.1] Daḷha,nemi and eight of his successors, closing with the advent of Metteyya Buddha. Using mythical language, it gives us an insight into the early Buddhist view of kingship and governance, especially how moral virtue is closely linked with socioeconomic conditions. Like the Aggañña <strong>Sutta</strong>, 1 it, too, centres on the theme of how crime arises in society. Textually, however, the Cakka,vatti Sīha,nāda <strong>Sutta</strong>, as it were, carries on from where the Aggañña <strong>Sutta</strong> ends, focussing itself more on a discussion of power, political and spiritual, that is, the proper role of the ruler, and, in a somewhat prophetic tone, gives us a vision of the future of human society. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Sutta</strong> opens with the Buddha teaching unprompted, exhorting the monks to “dwell with yourself as an island” 2 [§1.1], that is, to practise the four focusses of mindfulness [§1.2]. This opening passage is a well known stock from the Mahā,parinibbāna <strong>Sutta</strong> (D 16), 3 and the openings of the Mah Satipa- hna <strong>Sutta</strong> (D 22) and the Satipahna <strong>Sutta</strong> (M 10). 4 It leads into the <strong>Sutta</strong>’s worldly portion, a long account of 7 righteous universal monarchs [2], and the decline and revival of society in terms of moral conduct [§§2-26]. <strong>The</strong> same opening passage recurs at §27 which leads into the “morals” of the opening story, that is, teachings on the significance and benefits of meditation and recluseship. While the <strong>Sutta</strong> opens with the Buddha exhorting the monks to meditate [§1.2], the result of which is the purifying of the mind and keeping Māra out [§1.3], the Dharma section, too, closes with the same passage [§27]. In the conclusion, the same meditation, satipatthana, is said to bring about “the monk’s five blessings” of long life, beauty, happiness, wealth and power. <strong>The</strong> Buddha explains their meanings in detail, declaring that true monastic power is that of spiritual awakening. [§28] Steven Collins’ critical remark on the <strong>Sutta</strong> is helpful here: [<strong>The</strong> Cakka,vatti Sīha,nāda <strong>Sutta</strong>] depicts life in time, however good or bad, as slightly absurd; and therefore its opposite, timeless nirvana, as the only serious thing in the long run. I suggest that the intention (at least in part) of the long-drawn-out sequence of decline and revival, in all its detailed specificity, numerical and otherwise, and also of the humor and irony of the parable, is to induce in its audiences—or at least to make possible as a reaction from some among them—a sense of detachment from, or at least a (briefly) non-involved perspective on the passage of time. (1998:481) 1.2 THE STORY OF THE 8 KINGS 1.2.1 What makes a wheel-turner? <strong>The</strong> Cakka,vatti Sīha,nāda <strong>Sutta</strong> relates in some detail how karma works closely with moral conduct in a society [§§2-26]. When the ruler or authorities fail to remove and prevent widespread poverty, or introduce reforms too late, the cumulative effect is a general social decline. <strong>The</strong> story opens with a description of an ancient utopia ruled by the “wheel-turning monarch” (cakka,vatti), Daḷha,nemi (“strong wheel”) [§2], who renounces the world as the “sage-king” (rāj’isi) when the divine wheel disappears [§3]. 1 D 27/3:80-97 = SD 2.19. 2 See Mahā,parinibbāna S (D 16.2.26/2:100 f) & SD 9 (6). 3 D 16.2.6/2:101) = SD 9: see text [§1.2] n. 4 Respectively, D 22.1/2:290 = SD 13.2 & M 10.3/1:55 = SD 13.3. http://dharmafarer.org 1"
