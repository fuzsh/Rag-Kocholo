Sanatanis accepted Kashyapa as the Avatar of Vishnu., AND ASKED HIS DISCIPLE, DOGO: “WHAT IS THIS LETTER?”\n\nDOGO REPLIED, “IT’S THE LETTER FOR ‘BUDDHA’.”\n\nYAKUSAN COMMENTED, “YOU ARE A MONK SO FULL OF CHATTER!”\n\nONCE, AT THE EVENING DISCOURSE, YAKUSAN DIDN’T LIGHT THE CANDLE AS USUAL. A MONK CAME AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE. YAKUSAN SAID, “I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PHRASE. IF A BULL GIVES BIRTH, I WILL TELL IT TO YOU.”\n\nTHE MONK SAID, “THE BULL HAS ALREADY GIVEN BIRTH LONG AGO, AND YOU JUST KEEP NOT REVEALING IT.”\n\nYAKUSAN ASKED FOR A LIGHT. WHEN THE CANDLE WAS BROUGHT IN, THE MONK RETREATED AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE ASSEMBLY OF MONKS.\n\nLATER UNGAN TOLD TOZAN ABOUT THIS, AND TOZAN SAID, “THE MONK KNEW THE TRUTHTruth Mathematical 'truth' may not be agreeable with the philosophical 'truth.' A question may be asked on propositional 'truth' on the grounds of physics, that space and time actually don't exist. Vedic injunction Satyam Param Dhimahi, technically Satya is none other than Brahman. For Madhymic Buddhists there is nothing as such to be called 'truth', as all the corresponding facts are only mental projections. Apart from Bio-neuroelectricity nothing exists for Biological Cognition. So-called religious truths are nothing more than a marketing strategy. — HE JUST DIDN’T WANT TO MAKE OBEISANCE TO THE MASTER.”\n\nFriends,\n\nQuestion 1:\n\nOne of the sannyasins has asked me a question.\n\nIF THE TRUTH IS ONE, THEN WHY DO ALL THE MASTERS, ALL THE AWAKENED ONES, SPEAK IN DIFFERENT WAYS? SOMETIMES IT EVEN LOOKS AS IF THEY ARE CONTRADICTORY.\n\nThe truth is certainly one, but it has multidimensional reality, and every master has to choose a certain dimension. You cannot speak all the dimensions together.\n\nEvery master has his own style, his own way of speaking, his own way of conveying. The higher you rise in consciousness and awareness, the more you become unique, the more you become individual.\n\nBut let me explain to you:\n\nIndividuality is not personality.\n\nPersonality is given by the society to you. Individuality is your intrinsic nature.\n\nPersonality is fake, a fraud. Individuality is your innermost buddha, your innermost enlightenment, your innermost door to the divine.\n\nBut every master is bound to be unique in his expressions. They are all saying the same thing, they are all indicating towards the same moon, but their fingers are different. They are bound to be different. The finger of Buddha, the finger of Lao Tzu, the finger of Chuang Tzu, are bound to be different. If you pay too much attention to the finger, there is every possibility you will forget the purpose. The purpose was not the finger, the purpose was the moon.\n\nAll the differences are in the fingers, in their expressions. The experienceExperience εμπειρία of truth is one, but to bring it to expression, every master has to find his own device. That’s why even enlightened people appear to you to be speaking differently, even contradictorily — because existence does not have one-dimensional sources, it is multidimensional. It is comprehensive of all contradictions. All contradictions melt into one cosmos.\n\nNow, you cannot express the whole cosmos in any statement. All philosophies fall short, and all languages appear impotent. All theologies only manage a very partial truth. And remember, a partial truth is not truth. You cannot cut truth into parts. It is one, and organically one, not mechanically one.\n\nYou can take a car apart, and you can put those parts together again, but you cannot do the same with a living organism. You cannot take a man’s parts apart, and then put them together. You can do it, but the man will not be there. There will be only a corpse in your hands.\n\nBut it is one of the most difficult problems faced by all awakened ones: How to convey it?\n\nThey find devices, methods, meditations. They open doors so that you can look at the truth yourself. Of course, every master will have his own door. Existence has millions of approaches, and when a master reaches to the truth, he reaches by one path. Obviously, he will talk about the path by which he has reached to the truth.\n\nTruth is one, but paths are many. And unless we understand it, there is going to be a constant conflict and misunderstanding in the minds of the seekers.\n\nI am reminded of one of the greatest Urdu poets, Ghalib. Three hundred years have passed, but in three hundred years no poet so great has been born in the Urdu language. It is a very poetic language, I don’t think there is any other language in the worldWorld Κόσμος which is so poetic. Contemporary languages are bound to be non-poetic; they have to be scientific, exact. Poetry is flexible; poetry does not say directly, it only hints.\n\nThis great poet, Mirza Ghalib, has a very beautiful statement. I would like to repeat it first in his own language, then I will translate it.\n\nHAIN AUR BHI DUNIYAN MEN SUKHANBAR BAHUT ACHCHHE KAHTE HAIN GHALIB KA HAI ANDAJE BAYAN AUR.\n\nHAIN… DUNIYAN MEN SUKHANBAR BAHUT ACHCHHE\n\n…. In the world there are many great poets, but it is said that Ghalib’s way of saying, his style, his nuance, is absolutely unique.\n\nEvery master is unique, just like an Everest, standing far higher, touching the stars — alone. Never compare two masters. Comparison is not the right thing in the world of masters. Comparison is mindConciousness Through it, a living being exists. It exists even at the molecular level. Mind is not able to control it. The mind is an internal organ that exists separate from consciousness. The mind (depending on bio-electricity) can not work without memory and information, but consciousness can. Dreams come from consciousness. Read: Mind is man.-oriented, it is intellectual, and the master’s realization is beyond the mind, it is spiritual. In the world of spirit, in the world of godliness, there is no question of comparison. Every one is unique, but surrendered, dedicated to the same truth from different angles. It needs a tremendous capacity of understanding, and that understanding has not to be of the mind, it has to be of meditationMeditation Christian meditation is reading a portion of the Bible and understanding some deep meaning of it. Eastern meditation (Dhyana) is in some way going inside. It has no medical or health benefits. Too much meditation may cause Psychological problems. Sitting quietly and chanting mantras is a waste of life. The IQ of the practitioner will not increase and High BP will remain the same. The practitioners die in the same way as non-practitioners. Dhyana = Focusing on something. Dharana= Conceptualsation. Samadhi= Firm resolute mind..\n\nMind can understand everything that is outside you. All that is objective is available to the mind: scienceScience επιστήμη and technology, philosophyPhilosophy Metaphysics (Matter), Epistemology (knowledge of knowledge), Ethics (Sense of Good or Bad), Logic ( structure of reasoning) > Philosophers: Plato Aristotle Aquinas Locke Marx Hume Mill Kant Wittgenstein Descartes Nietzsche Sartre. Disciplines: Philosophy of Law. Philosophy of Feminism. Philosophy of Religion. Philosophy of Science. Philosophy of Mind. Philosophy of Literature. Political Philosophy. Philosophy of the Arts. Philosophy of History. Philosophy of Language. Theology Vs Philosophy and theologyTheology Biology, Sociology, etc are the same type of English construction. Theos (gods) and logos (talking/chatting). Talking about gods and goddesses. Not having perfect knowledge about Olympian gods was a Greek 'mystery'. In the Christian sense theology (Biblical Theology, Historical Theology, Systematic Theology, Practical Theology) is the understanding of Trinitarian 'mystery'. Most of the Christian people study theology to become church executives or employees. Dharma Tattva (धर्मतत्त्व > Gopath Brahman) is not Theology. धर्मतत्त्व is possiblele without god/s. धर्मतत्त्व is Philosophy (दर्शन) without school affiliation. Read more — all are mind-oriented.\n\nBut that which is within you is behind the mind, beyond the mind. It opens itself in your meditations, when you start dropping your thoughts and relaxing deeper and deeper, when only a witness is left. The body is far away and no more you, the mind is just an echo in the valleys, and is no more you. In the innermost core of your being there is no thought, no cloud, a great silence.\n\nIn that silence arises authentic understanding. In that silence you are closest to the divine.\n\nThat silence is a way, a bridge, a path, a connection to the ultimate.\n\nOnce you knowKnowledge Knowledge is derived from the process of an informed person integrating data from sense organs or intuition into their psyche. This concept is explored in the Vedic Nasadiya Sukta, which questions the possibility of ultimate truth or knowledge. In different languages, such as Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and Chinese, knowledge is expressed as \"η γνώση,\" \"Scientia,\" \"ज्ञानम्‌ ,\" and \"知识 Zhīshì,\" respectively. the ultimate, the difficulty arises: How to convey it? And there is a tremendous urge to convey it, because millions of people are living in darkness, in blindness, stumbling, finding no way out. Millions of people are born in the night and die in the night; there is no dawn in their lives.\n\nWhen one comes to the dawn, when one realizes the sunrise and his whole being becomes full of light and beauty and blessings, he wants to share it. This desire to share comes autonomously.\n\nBut how to share that which is beyond words?\n\nAll masters have been struggling to find some way to communicate, to commune. That’s why you find differences in their statements. Rather than thinking about their statements, it will be better to go within yourself and find the truth.\n\nNobody can help you. The masters can only show the way; you have to walk.\n\nNobody can come inside you. That is the dignityDignity αξιοπρέπεια > The basic dignity of a human has been protected by the Constitution and other Human rights Laws. If a man fails to provide it to another man, then he disrespects his existence and standing. of man, a great privilege: nobody can interfere in your inner life. You are alone there, the suprememost sovereign.\n\nBut people have got into trouble because they have started imitating. You can imitate a buddha, you can have the same clothes, you can walk the same way, you can eat the same kind of food. You can follow all the moralMorality Mental frame. It can be high morality or low morality, savage morality or civilised morality or Christian morality, or Nazi morality. Decent Behaviour is acceptable norms of the nations. Christian morality starts with the belief that all men are sinners and that repentance is the cause of divine mercy. Putting Crucified Christ in between is the destruction of Christian morality and logic. Now morality shifted to the personal choice of Jesus. What Jesus did is 'good'. The same would be the case of Ram, Krishna, Muhammad, Buddha, Lenin, etc. Pure Human Consciousness degraded to pure followership. There exists no proof the animals are devoid of morality. principles, but you will still be an actor, you will not be a buddha.\n\nIt happened … There were three monasteries deep in the mountains. All three belonged to different ChristianChristianity Christianity was formed in Alexandria. Whether the theology, organisation, or reading materials, everything formed in Alexandria in or around 80 CE and then exported everywhere by traders. The term Christian was not used before the first quarter of the 2nd Century. Christianity is the outcome of three Jewish-Roman wars, namely, 'The Great Revolt' (66-70 CE), the 'Kitos War'( 115-117 CE), and 'Bar Kochba Revolt' of 132-135 CE. After the Bar Kochba revolt, Christianity became a distinct sect from Judaism. In 30 BCE Greek became the language of Alexandria. NT was written in this language and the passion of the Christ was first performed here. The legacy of Clement (159-215 CE) and Origen ((185-254 CE) was to be noted. sects.\n\nOne day it happened by coincidence that the three abbots of the monasteries had gone for a morning walk and they all met on the crossroads. They talked about matters concerning their monasteries and other problems.\n\nFinally one of them said, “I have to tell you that as far as scholarship is concerned, my monastery is far higher than your monasteries.”\n\nThe second one said, “That is true. As far as scholarship is concerned, your people are great scholars. But don’t forget, as far as discipline is concerned, my monastery is far higher than yours. And also remember, scholarship is not going to help. It can make you knowledgeable, but it cannot make you wise. You have to walk the path of discipline; then only can you become a wise man.”\n\nThe third was silent up to now. He laughed, and he said, “You both are right. But as far as humbleness is concerned, we are the tops!”\n\nHumbleness … and the desire is to be the tops.\n\nYou can be humble, you can force yourself to be humble, you can repress your ego — but that humbleness will not be true humbleness. It will be just inverted ego. It will be low- key ego.\n\nOnce a man touched my feet. I told him, “There is no need ….”\n\nHe said, “It is not your concern. I am just the dust underneath your feet.”\n\nTo provoke that man, I said, “That’s right!”\n\nImmediatelyForthwith In Rao Mahmood Ahmad Khan v. Ranbir Singh , has held that the word ‘forthwith’ is synonymous with the word immediately, which means with all reasonable quickness. When a statute requires something to be done ‘forthwith’ or ‘immediately’ or even ‘instantly’, it should probably be understood as allowing a reasonable time for doing it. The interpretation of the word ‘forthwith’ would depend upon the terrain in which it travels and would take its colour depending upon the prevailing circumstances which can be variable.

He said, “You tell me that I am just the dust under your feet?”\n\nI said, “I have not said anything. You were saying it, I simply agreed.”\n\nHumbleness, or any other quality which makes you religious, if practiced from the outside makes you an actor. If it arises from the inside, out of your own experience of the intelligence of existence, then it has a different flavor, a different fragrance — the fragrance of the freshly-opened rose.\n\nThen you are neither egoist nor humble, because humbleness and ego, both are two sides of the same phenomenon. You simply are. This being, simply to be, makes you enlightened, gives you new insight into matters.\n\nIt happened in America, when they were celebrating some birth anniversary of Abraham Lincoln. They searched all over America for a man who would look like Abraham Lincoln — and they found him. A man looked almost the same, so they chose that man, they trained him.\n\nAbraham Lincoln used to stutter a little, so that man had to be trained to stutter. Abraham Lincoln was a little lame in one foot, so he started walking like a lame person. One year’s continuous training … and the next year they were going to celebrate the birthday the whole year, all over America.\n\nIn one year of continuously practicing and practicing and practicing, and then the second year going from one city to another city, from one part to another part, and playing the role of Abraham Lincoln, the man became so much obsessed with the idea that when he came homeHome Αρχική > he came as a lame man, stuttering.\n\nFirst the family thought that he was joking. The festival was over. They told him, “Now you don’t have to do all this.”\n\nHe said, “What do you mean? I AM Abraham Lincoln.” Those two years had got into his head.\n\nThey thought he would calm down, but he did not. Those two years had been too heavy and hot. He was calm and cool, and absolutely certain that he was Abraham Lincoln.\n\nThey took him to the psychiatrist. The psychiatrist tried in every possible way, but with no success at all. He was feeling very much harassed and tortured by everybody in his town, by his friends, by his family. And now the psychiatrists, psychoanalysts — they started harassing him.\n\nFinally the psychoanalyst he was visiting put him on the lie detector. If he was lying, the detector would show it. Because of so much harassment the man thought, “It is not worth it!” So when he was standing on the lie detector and the psychoanalyst asked him, “Are you Abraham Lincoln?”, he said, “No” — and the lie detector said, “He is lying, he IS Abraham Lincoln!”\n\nActing can go so deep in your unconscious layers of the mind that it is beyond your consciousness. You have only a small thin layer of consciousness; compared to it, your unconscious is nine times bigger. If something enters into your unconscious, you will start behaving like JesusJesus Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ: Doubts and controversies are always with him. Whether he existed at all or not? Whether Paul was correct or Muhammad about Jesus? If Paul was a student of Gamaliel then why he had heard nothing about Jesus from him? Why Aramaic culture of Jesus was not preserved? Why there were no dates in apostolic letters? But writing Date in letters was a standard practice then. What was the original language of the epistles? Possibly Constantine would have known these. He died due to asphyxiation., you will start behaving like Mohammed. But it will be just acting and nothing else, and acting is not a transformation of your being.\n\nI am against imposing any discipline on yourself from the outside — according to others. I am in favor, in absolute favor, categorically, that your life should arise from your own inner springs. From your own awakening the moralityMorality Mental frame. It can be high morality or low morality, savage morality or civilised morality or Christian morality, or Nazi morality. Decent Behaviour is acceptable norms of the nations. Christian morality starts with the belief that all men are sinners and that repentance is the cause of divine mercy. Putting Crucified Christ in between is the destruction of Christian morality and logic. Now morality shifted to the personal choice of Jesus. What Jesus did is 'good'. The same would be the case of Ram, Krishna, Muhammad, Buddha, Lenin, etc. Pure Human Consciousness degraded to pure followership. There exists no proof the animals are devoid of morality., the discipline will follow, just like a shadow follows you.\n\nThe world is living in tremendous misery because of your so-called moralists, puritans, who have been imposing things from the outside. Those things enter into the unconscious, and the man starts behaving in a certain manner — but he is a robot.\n\nUnless your potential that you have brought with you, which you have been carrying from eternity — unless that potential, that seed sprouts and starts gathering more and more foliage, and brings blossoms to your being, then morality is a small matter.\n\nYou don’t have to listen to Moses and his Ten Commandments; you will find your own commandments. Unless you are in direct contact with the divineness of existence, all that you are doing is creating a persona, a personality … fake, fraud, hypocrisy.\n\nI have heard that when GodGod People in most cultures believe in the existence of supernatural beings and other supernatural concepts. God is attributed to both anthropomorphic properties (“listens to prayers”) and non-anthropomorphic properties (“knows everything”). Conceptualizing God is associated with willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine or Vaccine hesitancy. Pope requested people not to practice “Jesus is my vaccine”. For the Jewish, family (Avestan universal) god became national God: I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,”(ex 3:15). See Ishwar. created the world, he went around with the Ten Commandments. He asked the Babylonians, “Would you like to have one commandment?”\n\nThey said, “What is it?” Naturally, first you should inquire what the commandment is.\n\nGod said, “You should not commit adultery.”\n\nThe Babylonians said, “Forget all about it. What shall we do then? In this meaningless life, adultery is the only game. Just get lost!”\n\nGod was very angry, but what to do? If they won’t take … He went to the Egyptians, he went to other races, but everybody asked, “First tell us what the commandment is.” And they all refused. They said, “We don’t want anybody else to tell us what to do. We want to find from our own innermost spring what is right and what is wrong.”\n\nAnd then finally he came across Moses, who had been struggling in the desert of Saudi Arabia for forty years continuously to find the HolyHoly Hebrew root qdš makes the word qōdeš (distinct). \"And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation\". (Exodus 19:6a). Distinct, which is not common or ordinary. \"Be holy, for I, the YAHA, your ELOHIM, am holy\" (Lv 19.2; cf. 11.44; 20.26) > be just, pure, and clean. Greek ἅγιος is \" set apart\" and is different from Hebrew 'qodes'.καὶ τοῦ ἁγίου πνεύματος (Matt 28.19). 'the holy place' (מִקְדָּשׁ, Ezekiel 37:28). Sanskrit 'pavitra -पवित्र' means sanctified by vedic mantra and rituals and not only cleaned 'something' by clean water or by fire. Folly (Oppo). Land, IsraelIsrael Modern State of Israel was established in 1948 after the UN proposed the partition of the British Mandate for Palestine into Arab and Jewish states. Wars with Arab neighbors followed, leading to Israel's control of various territories. In recent years, Israel has pursued peace agreements with Arab nations and faced conflict with groups like HAMAS. Former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has had a notable influence on Israeli politics, including a return to office in 2022. Read more. Almost two-thirds of the original group that he had taken from Egypt had died on the way.\n\nBy the timeTime χρόνος.

He did not ask, “What is the commandment?”, he said, “How much does it cost?” Just like a JewJew “Being Jewish” is very important and not forgetting the Holocaust is religion over Halakha. Israeli Jews are divided into Haredi (Orthodox), Dati (reformed), Masorti (Conservative/traditional) or Hiloni (secular), nonetheless, their ethnoreligious identity was possibly originated in ancient Egypt and modified in Babylone. In their Synagogue, they read the Torah and pray for the coming of the Messiah, who would build global 'Israel', through which the Divine and Human would meet forever. …\n\nGod said, “It is free.”\n\nThen Moses said, “I will take ten. If it is free, why take only one?”\n\nBut any commandments taken from anybody — even from God — are not going to give you a revolution in your being. They will only create an actor, a pretender, a hypocrite, a repressed person, inhibited, feeling guilty on every account. Whatever he does goes against the commandments.\n\nBut ten commandments are nothing compared to Gautam Buddha, who has thirty-three thousand principles for every Buddhist monk to follow. You cannot even remember them. Thirty-three thousand …? Every detailed gesture of your life is completely controlled from outside.\n\nI hate the very idea of being controlled from outside. I love the flowering of your being.\n\nAnd I am absolutely certain — because whenever your potential blossoms, there is no question of choice, of what is right and what is wrong. You choose the right without choosing. It is choiceless, the only alternative.\n\nFor a man of clarity, for a man of absolute perceptiveness, for a man full of light beyond the mind, life becomes a choiceless phenomenon. You simply do the right thing. It is not that you think that it is right, “That’s why I am doing it.”\n\nWith me, the definition of right and wrong, good and bad, sin and virtueVirtue Aristotelian model: Excess Mean Deficiency >Irascibility Gentleness Spiritlessness >Rashness Courage Cowardice>Shamelessness Modesty Diffidence>Profligacy Temperance Insensitiveness>Envy Righteous Indignation Malice>Greed Justice Loss>Prodigality Liberality Meanness>Boastfulness Honesty Self-deprecation>Flattery Friendliness Surliness>Subservience Dignity Stubborness>Luxuriousness Hardness Endurance>Vanity Greatness of Spirit Smallness of Spirit>Extravagance Magnificence Shabbiness> Rascality Prudence Simpleness., absolutely changes. Whatever the enlightened person does is right. Whatever the enlightened person does not do, is wrong.\n\nSo I don’t teach you any discipline, any morality. I simply teach you to be awake, and in your awareness you cannot do anything wrong. You cannot harm anybody, you cannot violate anybody’s freedom, you cannot interfere into anybody’s territory. A great respect for life, reverence for life, arises in you, and it has nothing to do with your religionReligion ‘The word ‘Religion’ -Re Legion- A group or Collection or a brigade, is a social-cultural construction and Substantially doesn’t exist. Catholic religion is different from Protestant religion. It is not Dharma., it has nothing to do with your belief systems.\n\nA man of awareness does not belong to any organized religion. Organized religion is against religiousness. Every organized religion kills the truth!\n\nThe ancient story is:\n\nA man found the truth.\n\nA little devil came running to the old devil and asked him, “What are you doing here?”\n\nThe old devil was smoking a cigarette. He said, “My son, cool down. What is the matter?”\n\nThe little devil said, “You are sitting here, and one man has found the truth! Our whole business is at risk!”\n\nThe old devil said, “Sit down. Take a cigarette. My people have already reached there.”\n\nThe little devil said, “But I am coming from there, and I have not seen any devils!”\n\nThe old devil said, “Devils are not needed, my people have reached there. They are the priests, they are the rabbis, they are the popes, they are the shankaracharyas, they are the imams. They have reached there, and they will organize the truth, and once the truth is organized, it is finished! They will surround the man, and they will not allow the people to approach the man. They will interpret the man, and in their interpretation the truth will be lost.”\n\nThe last commandment from the popePope Political and Religious Head of the Catholic Church based in Vatican City. He is designated as Bishop of Rome (Diocese). He ruled the Vatican City through a secretariat.

People have been sinning just in the old way, routine. He should be counted as a great pioneer!\n\nThe new sin is that you should not communicate with God directly; you should only communicate through the priestPriest A typical church official cadre receives salary/ maintenance from the church fund. In Sanatan society, there is no concept of ordained priest..\n\nAs far as I can see, that’s what the devil was meaning, that “the priests are there, they are my people, they serve me.” They talk about God, but talking about God, creating belief in people about God, does not help any transformation.\n\nBelief is not needed. What is needed is knowing. Belief simply hides your ignorance, it does not make any rebellion in your being.\n\nOnce Sri Raman, one of the great seers of this age, was asked by a journalist coming from the West, “Do you believe in God?”\n\nSri Raman said, “No.”\n\nThe man was shocked. He had heard that this man has realized God, and he says he does not believe in God! He repeated the question. He said, “Have you heard me rightly? I am asking, ‘Do you believe in God?'” Raman said, “I have heard it. Do you understand what I have said? I don’t believe in God, because I know. There is no need of belief. I know the whole existence is divine. There is no personal God anywhere. Every part of this universe is divine. I know it, there is no question of believing.”\n\nBeliefs are to distract people from discovering the beauty, the grandeur, the splendor, the divinity of existence. And this is what all the priests of all the religions are doing all over the world: programming people into believing certain things — God, heavenHeaven स्वर्गे लोके न भयं किञ्चनास्ति न तत्र त्वं न जरया बिभेति । उभे तीर्त्वा अशनायापिपासे शोकातिगो मोदते स्वर्गलोके ॥ १२ ॥ (Kathopanishad). स्वर्ग (Swarga) is neither physical nor a spiritual place or entity.

It does not mean what the ChristiansChristianity Christianity was formed in Alexandria. Whether the theology, organisation, or reading materials, everything formed in Alexandria in or around 80 CE and then exported everywhere by traders. The term Christian was not used before the first quarter of the 2nd Century. Christianity is the outcome of three Jewish-Roman wars, namely, 'The Great Revolt' (66-70 CE), the 'Kitos War'( 115-117 CE), and 'Bar Kochba Revolt' of 132-135 CE. After the Bar Kochba revolt, Christianity became a distinct sect from Judaism. In 30 BCE Greek became the language of Alexandria. NT was written in this language and the passion of the Christ was first performed here. The legacy of Clement (159-215 CE) and Origen ((185-254 CE) was to be noted. say, it means forgetfulness. In its root it means forgetfulness of your being.\n\nSo there is only one sin: forgetfulness of your being. And there is only one virtue: that is, remembering yourself. And the moment you remember yourself, this whole existence becomes a totally different place. A great love arises, a great compassion arises. It is not that you cultivated it, you simply found it, just as in a flower opening in the morning sun, the flower discovers its own fragrance for the first time.

Theos (gods) and logos (talking/chatting). Talking about gods and goddesses. Not having perfect knowledge about Olympian gods was a Greek 'mystery'. In the Christian sense theology (Biblical Theology, Historical Theology, Systematic Theology, Practical Theology) is the understanding of Trinitarian 'mystery'. Most of the Christian people study theology to become church executives or employees. Dharma Tattva (धर्मतत्त्व > Gopath Brahman) is not Theology. धर्मतत्त्व is possiblele without god/s. धर्मतत्त्व is Philosophy (दर्शन) without school affiliation. Read more systems to prove heaven.\n\nIt is strange that all religions are concerned with hell, with heaven, with God. No religion seems to be concerned with you. They are all concerned with past, they are all concerned with future. No religion seems to be concerned with the present.\n\nAll religions are life-negative, they deny life — and to deny life is to deny God. That is the only denial. Whoever denies life and teaches renouncing life is an atheistAtheist Does God exist? Schopenhauer, Comte, Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennet, Christopher Hitchens. Buddha and Mahavir were atheists but their followers were believers of God. ∫ The problem of evil (Epicurus). ; he is against the divinity of existence. Whoever teaches you to live life in its totality, with great affirmation, rejoicing, singing and dancing … then this very moment the whole existence becomes divine.\n\nIn your dance it becomes divine.\n\nIn your joy it becomes divine.\n\nIn your blissfulness it becomes divine.\n\nIn your ecstasy you reach to the highest peak of divineness.\n\nUnless you know your own divineness you cannot know the divinity of existence. That is just the beginning: to know your divineness is the first step in knowing the divineness of the whole existence.\n\nThis existence has never been created. The whole argument is absolutely wrong. All religions think everything has to be created, otherwise from where will it come?\n\nBut they don’t think, “From where does God come?” If God created the world, from where is he coming? Who created him? And if God can be uncreated, then what is the point of bringing in an unnecessary hypothesis?\n\nThis is a basic principle of all scientific research: don’t bring in unnecessary hypotheses.\n\nWork it out with the minimum of hypotheses.\n\nIf God is to be created by another bigger God, you will end in an absurdity — what logicians call regressum infinitum. You will regress into infinity and you will not find the answer. The question will remain standing exactly where it was: Who created the last God?\n\nExistence is enough.\n\nHence I teach you godliness, but not God.\n\nGod is the invention of the priest. God is a fiction to console you, to make you afraid, to make you guilty. All religions depend on your guilt, on your fear — but that is not authentic religiousness.\n\nAuthentic religiousness will make you unafraid, fearless; not a slave, not a puppet in the hands of some unknown God, some fiction.\n\nAccording to my experience, if there is God, it is against man’s freedom. If God has created you, why did he create you?\n\nAccording to ChristianityChristianity Christianity was formed in Alexandria.

NT was written in this language and the passion of the Christ was first performed here. The legacy of Clement (159-215 CE) and Origen ((185-254 CE) was to be noted., God created the world only four thousand years before Jesus.\n\nIt is only six thousand years ago that God created the world. What has he been doing since eternity? And what was the cause that suddenly he decided to create this world?\n\nAnd if God created the world in a whimsical way, without any reason and rhyme … For eternity he had been in a deep slumber, and suddenly he woke up, six thousand years ago.\n\nIt must have been January, the first of January, and certainly a Monday, because he worked six days, and on Sunday he disappeared for eternal holidays. Since then he has not been known.\n\nOne of my tailors, an old man, told me a very beautiful thing. I was going on a tour. I told him, “Exactly within six days you have to prepare my clothes. Saturday evening I will collect them. And I am a perfectionist … so put aside all your other work.”\n\nHe said, “Okay — but have you had a look at the world?”\n\nI said, “What do you mean?”\n\nHe said, “God created this world. Do you see the mess? I can make your clothes in six days, but they will be all in a mess. It is up to you to choose.”\n\nI said, “You are right — looking at the world.”\n\nIn three thousand years there have been five thousand warsWar Whenever Christians wage a war, it is a Just war (City of God). Jesus asked his followers to purchase swords (Luke 22: 35-36). Those who legitimately hold authority also have the right to use arms to repel aggressors against the civil community entrusted to their responsibility (Catechism 2265). Without Jihad there is no Islam. In Mahabharata, Krishna tried to stop the War imposed by Kurus. Lord Rama killed Ravan in the war to restore his wife. Deva and Asura battles are not available in Vedas.. What more mess do you need?\n\nAll the nations are trying hard to become nuclear. This poor country has become nuclear.\n\nHalf of the nationNation A collective consciousness, founded in ancient origin within a geographic area, with definite history and heritage, culture and way of life, language and literature, food and clothing, coupled with a deep understanding of war and peace is to be known as a nation.

Half of the people are going to die. One will die out of two, and there will not be enough people to carry the corpses to the funeral pyres or to the graveyards. You will be surrounded by corpses. It will be impossible to live. Your whole country will be stinking of death!\n\nBut your politicians are not concerned about it. They are concerned about making the country nuclear; they have already made it.\n\nIt seems to be absolutely a mess. It is a proofArguments It is not quarreling.

Proof is a derivation of a conclusion from premises through a valid argument. that it has not been created, it is evolving accidentally. It is up to man, not up to God, to put it right. But man can put it right only if he puts himself right.\n\nIt is very difficult to convince the unconscious masses that the world is moving towards a global suicide. By the end of this century, perhaps, the only planet in the universe which has created people like Buddha and Jesus, people like Lao Tzu and Rinzai, will disappear. In the whole of existence, millions of stars and millions of galaxies are absolutely without any life. This is a miracle, that this small earth … It is very small, you don’t understand its smallness.\n\nThe sun is six thousand times bigger than this earth, and this sun is a mediocre star in the universe; there are bigger suns, far bigger. This does not count for much, this is a small galaxy.\n\nBut this earth is our home. Unless we put ourselves right, we cannot put humanityHuman Ο άνθρωπος (Humanum> Homo sapiens) मानव:. We have failed to consider the minimum need to be a 'human'. For Christians, human beings are sinful creatures, who need some saviour. For Evolution biology a man is still evolving, for what, we don´t know. For Buddhist Nagarjuna, the realisation of having a human body is a mere mental illusion. We are not ready to accept that a human is a computer made of meat. For a slave master, a human person is another animal, his sons and daughters are his personal property. right, we cannot put this earth in such a way as to live beautifully. There is no need of nations, there is no need of religions, there is no need of races. It is one earth, it is one world, it is one truth, it is one divinity.\n\nBut one has first to searchSearch Google SEO: Meaning> Relevance> Quality> Usability> Context within oneself.\n\nI have heard about a man who became mad. That was not bad — but in his madness he started thinking that he was dead.\n\nEverybody tried to convince him, “You are alive. You eat, you drink, you sleep, you go for a morning walk — and you say you are dead?”\n\nHe said, “I know perfectly well I am dead! Who told you that dead people don’t go for a morning walk?” It was very strange of the fellow. He argued, “Who told you that dead people don’t eat? Perhaps you are also dead, you simply have forgotten to remember when you died! I remember.”\n\nHe was taken to the psychiatrist. There is no other place, although psychiatry has not been of any help to anybody. But what to do? — except psychiatry and psychoanalysis, there is nowhere to go, although they have not been of any help.\n\nNow even the greatest psychoanalysts are saying that psychoanalysis is on its way to dying, because people have not been helped by it at all. Fifteen years of psychoanalysis, twenty years of psychoanalysis … your whole bank account is shifted to the psychoanalyst, and you are the same — perhaps more insane.\n\nThe psychoanalyst said, “Don’t be worried. I have treated many people like this. Sit down.”\n\nThe dead man sat down. He said, “Do you think you are alive?”\n\nThe psychoanalyst said, “Have you come here for treatment or to give me treatment?”\n\nThe madman said, “Just by the way, I have inquired whether you are still alive. These people think they are alive, and I am saying the truth, from the very bottom of my heart, that I am a dead man.”\n\nThe psychoanalyst was a very clever, very experienced man. He took out a knife and cut the man’s hand, just slightly so that blood came out. Before cutting the hand he asked the man, “Have you ever heard — when you used to be alive — that dead men don’t bleed?”\n\nThe madman said, “That’s true. I have heard — while I was alive — a proverb that dead men don’t bleed.”\n\nThen the analyst cut the dead man’s hand and the blood came. He said, “Aha! And now …?”\n\nThe dead man said even more loudly, “Aha! That means the proverb is wrong: dead men do bleed. This is a proof!”\n\nNow, what to do with people? If you want to help them, it is not an easy job. It is one of the most difficult things to help somebody towards spiritual exploration, to move someone towards his inner space.\n\nThat’s exactly my work here.\n\nMy only concern is to make you aware of your innermost center, and then everything will follow on its own accord.\n\nThe sutras:\n\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\n\nON ONE OCCASION, YAKUSAN WROTE DOWN THE CHINESE CHARACTER SIGNIFYING BUDDHA, AND ASKED HIS DISCIPLE, DOGO: “WHAT IS THIS LETTER?”\n\nDOGO REPLIED, “IT IS THE LETTER FOR ‘BUDDHA’.”\n\nPerfectly factual and right — but in the vision of a master it is a totally different thing.\n\nDoes Dogo think that the master does not know what the character signifies? His answer implies that the master is ignorant of the significance of the Chinese character.\n\nIf he had understood, he would have remained silent. His silence would have been the right answer. He would have remained silent, showing the master that “You know it already, why are you harassing me?” But, on the contrary, he said, “IT IS THE LETTER FOR ‘BUDDHA’.” He showed his knowledgeKnowledge Knowledge is derived from the process of an informed person integrating data from sense organs or intuition into their psyche. This concept is explored in the Vedic Nasadiya Sukta, which questions the possibility of ultimate truth or knowledge. In different languages, such as Greek, Latin, Sanskrit, and Chinese, knowledge is expressed as \"η γνώση,\" \"Scientia,\" \"ज्ञानम्‌ ,\" and \"知识 Zhīshì,\" respectively..\n\nBefore a master you should show your heart, you should show your innocence, not your knowledge. All knowledge is rubbish! All knowledge is borrowed. Dogo missed the point.\n\nYAKUSAN COMMENTED, “YOU ARE A MONK SO FULL OF CHATTER!” — and he had only said one word. But the master is right. One word has come out, but the chattering mind — yakkety-yak, yakkety-yak — goes on inside. From where has this “buddha” come? From that yakkety-yak, he has just pulled out one word. He is not a silent man.\n\nThe master was disappointed. He hoped that Dogo would remain silent, knowing that “The master knows, he is unnecessarily pulling my leg.” Or, if he wanted to answer him, he could have touched his feet. This would have showed that “That character shows you, the buddha.”\n\nGautam the Buddha is not the only buddha in the history of the world; there have been thousands of buddhas around the world, in different parts of the world. They may not be known as buddhas, because ‘buddha’ simply means the awakened one. It is not the name of Gautam Buddha; his name was Gautam Siddharth. Buddha is his awakening, his enlightenment, his knowing himself and existence.\n\nAnybody who becomes awakened can be called a buddha, it is nobody’s monopoly. The word does not belong to Gautam Buddha, it is not his name; it is the quality that has happened to him, his awakening. Anybody awake, anywhere in the world, has the right to be called a buddha.\n\nYakusan was an enlightened master, with thousands of disciples. Hundreds became enlightened under his guidance. Just touching his feet would have been the right gesture of a man of understanding, that “It signifies you.” But there is no need to use words. Just touch the feet of the master. Or, if you have courage enough, then slap the master: “What do you mean? You know it and still you want to harass me?”\n\nIn Zen, slapping the master is a very common routine. It is the only religion in which the master and the disciple are not inferior or superior. Sometimes the master hits the disciple, sometimes the disciple hits the master.\n\nA great master, Rinzai, called his most intimate disciple suddenly in the middle of the night. The disciple was meditating outside the master’s house. He came in.\n\nThe master said, “I had to call you. I love to hit you. As I see it, you are coming too close; by the morning you will be a buddha, and I will not be able to hit you. So this is the last time” — and he hit him! And the disciple touched his feet in gratitude.\n\nZen is a very special world. It has its own ways which are absolutely unknown outside this small stream of buddhas. It is not an organized religion, it is pure religion, simple religion. The individual is far more important than the churchChurch \"Εκκλησία του Δήμου\">assembly of people in Greece. Creedal political organizations of Christian People (Ecclesia) were created in Rome around 350 CE with a reading manual (NT) under a local leader (Bishop) within Roman provinces. A church building is also called a 'church'. The church is the body of Christ and this Doctrine of the catholic church was added around 400 CE. Christian groups are divided into Roman Catholics, Orthodox, and countless reformed denominations. A church is maintained by donations and taxation from its members..\n\nIt was so loving of Rinzai to call his disciple. Slapping him was sheer love and joy: “I have been enjoying slapping you for years. From tomorrow morning, I will not be able to slap you; on the contrary, if you want you can slap me.”\n\nAnd exactly the next morning, the disciple came in and slapped the master. The master laughed and he touched the feet of the disciple, just as in the night the disciple had touched his feet.\n\nThere is no problem of any superiority or inferiority. One is awake, one is asleep, but the asleep one can become awake any moment.\n\nRather than answering Yakusan, if Dogo had done something to express it — slapping the master, touching his feet, or just remaining silent, closing his eyes and sitting in a buddha posture — that would have given the answer.\n\nLanguage cannot answer such questions. You have to show your understanding, not your knowledge. You have to show your wisdom, not your information. You have to show your transformation.\n\nDogo missed, utterly missed.\n\nYAKUSAN COMMENTED, “YOU ARE A MONK SO FULL OF CHATTER! You have not gone beyond the mind yet?”\n\nONCE, AT THE EVENING DISCOURSE, YAKUSAN DID NOT LIGHT THE CANDLE AS USUAL. A MONK CAME AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE.\n\nYou never know with the Zen masters. You are absolutely incapable of predicting their behavior, because they live spontaneously, they don’t have a certain ritual to repeat.\n\nNobody knows the reason why he did not light the candle as usual. The assembly was completely in the dark.\n\nONE MONK CAME AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE. YAKUSAN SAID, “I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PHRASE.”\n\nThis is a special Zen expression. When the master says, “I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PHRASE,” he does not mean he has a phrase; he simply means he has something to confer, not to convey, but to transfer.\n\nHe said,\n\n“I HAVE A VERY SPECIAL PHRASE. IF A BULL GIVES BIRTH, I WILL TELL IT TO YOU.”\n\nNow, bulls don’t give birth, so he is making an absolutely absurd statement:\n\n“IF A BULL GIVES BIRTH, I WILL TELL IT TO YOU.”\n\nThe monk must have been an enlightened one. THE MONK SAID, “THE BULL HAS ALREADY GIVEN BIRTH LONG AGO, AND YOU JUST KEEP NOT REVEALING IT. It is time you should reveal it. What do you mean by ‘the phrase’? It is time you should convey, you should transfer it, you should unburden yourself, because the bull has given birth long ago.”\n\nYAKUSAN ASKED IMMEDIATELY FOR A LIGHT — he wanted to see the monk. He had given the right answer.\n\nYAKUSAN ASKED FOR A LIGHT. WHEN THE CANDLE WAS BROUGHT IN, THE MONK RETREATED AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE ASSEMBLY OF MONKS.\n\nThere were thousands of monks.\n\nLATER UNGAN TOLD TOZAN — two other masters talking about the old days with Yakusan …\n\nLATER UNGAN TOLD TOZAN ABOUT THIS, AND TOZAN SAID, “THE MONK KNEW THE TRUTH — HE JUST DID NOT WANT TO MAKE OBEISANCE TO THE MASTER.”\n\nThere is every possibility you will misunderstand it. You will think Tozan is saying that the monk knew the truth, but he did not want to touch the feet of the master. You will think he was an egoist. No. A man who knows the truth cannot have the ego. They both cannot exist together, there is no coexistence possible between truth and ego. Then what is the meaning? Why did he disappear?\n\nMy understanding is, he disappeared because he did not want even to be recognized, because that desire to be recognized is part of the ego. He did not even want to be grateful to the master. Not that he was not grateful — he was so grateful that to show it by touching his feet was very miserly.\n\nThere was no way to show the gratitude to the master, and he did not want any recognition. He simply disappeared in the crowd, just as inside he had disappeared in the cosmos. He is no more, who is going to touch the feet?\n\nIn the darkness it was perfectly okay, because the master could not see him. But when the light was brought in, he simply disappeared.\n\nThis anecdote has been misunderstood by the scholars very much. I have seen their commentaries; they all think it was because of his ego. But they don’t understand — scholars cannot understand — they don’t see that the monk knew the truth; how can he have the ego? You can have either the ego or the truth.\n\nEgo is your personality, the truth is your individuality. You have to drop the personality.\n\nYou have to stand utterly naked before existence. You have to melt down like ice into the ocean of this great divineness all around.\n\nAmerica has not produced any great mystic, it has not produced any great psychoanalyst.\n\nBut one psychologist, William James — everything else about him was ordinary, but one thing he brought, a phrase, “oceanic experience.” The religious experience is an oceanic experience. Just for this small phrase, this small statement, I consider him to be one of the greatest psychologists that we have produced anywhere around the globe. He has touched exactly the right point.\n\nReligious experience is an oceanic experience, a dewdrop slipping from the lotus leaf into the ocean — in one way, disappearing into the ocean, in another way, the ocean disappearing into the dewdrop, both becoming one.\n\nThe monk simply disappeared into the crowd because he did not want to be recognized.\n\nHe did not want even to pay obeisance to the master, because that would also be in some way a hidden desire to be recognized by the master.\n\nBut a man who has understood the truth needs no recognition. He becomes a nobody. In Buddha’s language, he becomes anatta, he becomes a no-self.\n\nHe is no more; only the existence is.\n\nIt is a beautiful anecdote for you to meditate, to contemplate on.\n\nSampu wrote:\n\nCHILD WAITING EARTHBOUND.\n\nCLOUD SPARROW\n\nHIGHER AND HIGHER.\n\nIt is a small haiku. It says, CHILD WAITING EARTHBOUND … a child in the mother’s womb is waiting to come to the earth. First one has to get roots into the earth; only then you can spread your branches into the sky like wings. Unless you have roots, you cannot spread your wings into the sky. The deeper the roots, the higher goes the tree … almost reaching to the stars.\n\nOnly one painter in the West, Vincent van Gogh, a Dutch painter, had such tremendous insight — almost the insight of a mystic, very close to being a buddha. He always painted his trees surpassing the stars. The stars remained underneath the trees, and the trees went beyond the stars. Whenever he was asked, “What are you doing? This is simply insane.\n\nNo tree can reach beyond the stars!” …\n\nThe closest star is four light years away — the closest. You have to understand four light years. Scientists had to find a new measurement; yards and feet and miles would no longer do. This is the measurement for the stars — the distance is so vast. What is a light year? A light year is: light travels in a single second one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles — in one second, one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles. Now multiply it by sixty, that will be one minute. Multiply it again by sixty, that will be one hour. Multiply it by twenty-four, that will be one day. Multiply it by thirty, that will be one month.\n\nMultiply it by twelve, that will be one year — one light year! The nearest star is four light years away.\n\nIf we can ever in our wildest dreams think of a rocket moving at the same speed as light, which is impossible … It is impossible because at the speed of light everything becomes light. That very speed turns everything into light, so you cannot have a rocket moving at the speed of light. You and the rocket both will become light.\n\nBut just to help you understand: if you move at the speed of light, you will take four years to reach to the closest star — and there are already four million stars counted in the universe, and this is not the end; this is the end of our instruments. Beyond those four million stars there is still infinity. We can never reach to the boundary line, because there is no boundary line to existence.\n\nVan Gogh was asked again and again, “Are you mad?” But he said, “I have been sitting by the side of the trees, listening where they are going, and I have always heard that the trees are our earth’s ambition to reach to the stars. My paintings are not factual, they are poetic. They are the ambitions of the earth to reach to the stars.”\n\nHe is the only man, a very rare man, who looked at stars not the way we look. He looked at stars as spirals. Nobody had ever looked at stars as spirals. People asked him, “What are you doing?” He said, “What can I do? Whenever I close my eyes I see the stars as spirals.”\n\nIt took one hundred years, but just now physicists have come to the point that stars are spiral. Van Gogh was right, although he had no instruments, and eyes cannot see it.\n\nHe was so much obsessed with the sun … he wanted to paint the perfect sunset. The whole day he would wait under the sun, watching and watching and watching. And then all the psychedelic colors on the horizon, and the sun setting … He painted for almost one year, but rejected all those paintings because nothing was coming close to the beauty and the ecstasy and the silence, and the birds returning home, and the sun setting. And those psychedelic colors on the clouds, on the horizon … never repeated again, always original.\n\nThe day he finished his painting to his satisfaction — he was only thirty-three years old — he wrote a letter to his brother saying that “My work is done. Now I don’t have unnecessarily to be a burden on the earth” — and he committed suicide.\n\nHe painted thousands of paintings, but not a single painting was ever sold, because nobody could understand his paintings. They were so strange, but they were absolutely real to him.\n\nSampu is saying, “Child waiting in the mother’s womb” — for what? — earthbound, he wants to get to the earth, to get his roots deep into the earth, because unless you have roots in the earth you cannot rise into the sky, you cannot be a cedar of Lebanon, four hundred feet high. Then you need four-hundred-foot-deep roots. A balance is needed, otherwise the tree will fall.\n\nThis is one of my basic and essential approaches, that unless you are deeply rooted in materialism you cannot rise into spirituality.\n\nThe East has committed one mistake: it has been trying to reach to the stars without going deeper into the earth, and it has been a complete failure. The West has committed another mistake: it goes on growing the roots into the earth, into matter, and it has forgotten completely about the stars.\n\nHence my continuous emphasis that every one of you has to be a Zorba the Buddha.\n\nZorba is the roots in the earth, and the buddha is a longing to fly into ultimate freedom, to reach to the space which is unbounded.\n\nCHILD WAITING EARTHBOUND.\n\nCLOUD SPARROW\n\nHIGHER AND HIGHER.\n\n… And a bird, a cloud sparrow, goes on higher and higher into the sky. Both need a great synthesis.\n\nOur world is suffering because we have not been able to create a synthesis between East and West, between earth and sky, between spirit and matter, between your inner and the outer. Unless this great synthesis is achieved, humanity has no hope.\n\nQuestion 2:\n\nA question from Maneesha:\n\nOUR BELOVED MASTER,\n\nYOUR MASTERLINESS LAST NIGHT WAS AWE-INSPIRING.\n\nIT SEEMS IRONICAL, BUT DOES THE DISCIPLE ONLY REALLY COMPREHEND THE MASTER’S COMPASSION WHEN HE IS ENLIGHTENED AND THUS NO LONGER SO DEPENDENT ON IT?\n\nManeesha, here nobody is dependent on me. You want to be dependent, but I won’t allow it. It is because of your desire to be dependent that you have created organized religions.\n\nYou have become enslaved by all kinds of churches, cults and creeds, because of your desire to be dependent. It is a father-fixation, in the terms of psychoanalysis, because the child is so dependent on the mother and the father.\n\nIf it is a boy, he becomes fixed on the mother, and that is a great trouble. If it is a girl, she becomes fixed on the father. Every girl her whole life will be trying to find a father-figure in her husband — and that is impossible. Nothing is being repeated. You cannot find your father as a husband. Hence, every womanMen Ανθρωποι (People), a woman (γυναίκα), Man (Ανδρας) > Adama, Manu > No proof to establish that due to mutation a monkey turned into a human being. is frustrated, no husband seems to be right.\n\nEvery man is disappointed — because no woman is going to be your mother.\n\nNow, it is a very strange problem. The husband is trying to find his mother in the wife, the wife is trying to find her father in the husband. There is constant struggle, fight.\n\nMarriage is hellfire.\n\nHow do people manage to live together? It is a miracle. Because they are miserable as a husband, as a wife, they have to find some consolation somewhere else — in God, in the priest.\n\nIt is not without any reason that Christian priests are called “father” — even Catholic priests. Do you see the contradiction? They are unmarried, and you call them father. Now they are trying to find mothers, to become really fathers, but the VaticanVatican City The Vatican City State was established through the Lateran Treaty on 11th February 1929 as an independent territory for the Pope, representing the Catholic Church. It has diplomatic relations with nearly 200 countries and engages in various international issues. The first church in honor of Saint Peter was built in the fifth century CE and was demolished in 1506 and a new church was constructed in 1626, which covers an area of 15,160 square meters and has an internal length of 186 meters. is against it.\n\nWhy do you call God, “the Father”? And there are Mother Goddesses also ….\n\nThese are fixations of childhood. You were dependent then. How long are you going to be parasites on your parents? Twenty-five years … Up to the time you become a Ph.D.\n\nfrom the university, you are a parasite. The father and mother want you to be independent — now it is time! — but in twenty-five years without being aware of it they have taught only one thing: be dependent.\n\nNow you are thrown into the world.

Developmental Psychology. 6. Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities. 7. Quantitative Psychology 8. Social Psychology. demands somebody to be your savior — a Jesus. You are ready to become sheep, some shepherd is needed — somebody to console you, “Don’t be worried. Just believe in me and I will save you. I will take care of you.”\n\nSome God is needed who is omnipotent; he has to be, otherwise how will he take care of so many billions of people? He has to be all-knowing, present everywhere — omnipotent, all-powerful; omniscient, all-knowing; omnipresent, everywhere available. This is our desire. And the priest certainly exploits humanity because of this dependence. The priest consoles.\n\nKarl Marx was right when he said that religion is the opium of the people. The organized so-called religions are certainly the opium of the people.\n\nI will not call religiousness the opium of the people. That is a totally different phenomenon. No God, no fathers, no priest, no rabbi — you are standing on your own feet. Your trustTrust It originated and was reduced to practice under the jurisdiction of courts by the civil law, was expanded and developed in the courts of chancery, and has been employed in nearly every field of human activity. The fundamental nature of a trust is the division of title, with the trustee being the holder of legal title and the beneficiary that of equitable title. By definition, the creation of a trust must involve a conveyance of property. > Trust Deed ∫ Having trust/faith/confidence in something is in existence itself — no mediator.\n\nManeesha, my whole effort is that you should not be dependent on me, whether you are enlightened or not. If you are not enlightened, it is needed even more — no dependence — because a dependent person is spiritually a slave, and a slave has no right to become enlightened.\n\nYou have to declare your independence, your freedom, even while you are not enlightened, because this freedom, this independence will pave the path towards enlightenment.\n\nOf course, after enlightenment there is no need to be dependent. Because there is no need to be dependent, you can be grateful, you can have compassion, and you can understand the compassion of the master. It is difficult in your darkness, in your unconsciousness, to understand compassion and love.\n\nBut that should not be your concern at this moment. At this moment, your sole concern is meditation. Go deeper into meditation and you will find compassion, and you will find understanding of compassion. You will find freedom, and you will find that freedom does not mean ungratefulness, unthankfulness.\n\nThere is no need to show it; your heart will beat with it, your heart will continuously ring a bell of great blissfulness, benediction, and of gratitude for the master. But it is not dependence.\n\nNo master who is authentic will ask your surrender, your commitment. These are the frauds who ask your surrender, who ask your commitment, who ask that “You have to be under my control, under my instructions. You cannot leave the fold.”\n\nThis is not a fold, this is purely a gathering of individuals. It is not a society, neither is it a club, nor a church. It is not an organization.\n\nI love to share! — and you are thirsty, and I have enough water to share with you. Because I know the secret, the more I share the more I have, so I am not a loser — and you will be gaining deeper and deeper insights into existence and its mysteries.\n\nBut there is no question of any dependence on me. I am just your friend. It is your love if you call me your master. You are not commanded to call me your master. You can call me your friend, you can even ask the question without addressing me. The address is not the point.\n\nYou are related to me in deep love, without any conditions — either from your side or from my side.\n\nI have to explain it to you.\n\nWhenever you make somebody dependent on you, you also become dependent on that person. Have you ever thought about it, that dependence is a mutual phenomenon? The master of a slave is also a slave of the slave. The leader of the people is also a follower of the people. The leader is continuously looking where the masses are going; he jumps ahead, to remain the leader. He goes on saying what the masses want to hear, and whether that is harmful or poisonous does not matter. Whatever the masses want to hear, he goes on saying it.\n\nNever make anybody dependent on you — your wife, your husband, your children — because the more you make them dependent on you, the more you are becoming dependent on them. Allow freedom to your wife, to your husband, to your children. Help them to be independent, and that will help you to be independent of them.\n\nAnd if we can teach independence and freedom to people, all fictions in religion will disappear.\n\nI have heard …\n\nOne rabbi and one Christian bishopBishops Επίσκοποι - Inspector, the system of Epicopic leadership developed after 300 CE in Christendom. Now Bishops are the Prince of the Church. were very friendly. They used to go to the golf course together. They had made arrangements for the coming Sunday, but the bishop said, “There is one difficulty. If many more people come for confession I will be late. I will do it as quick as possible; you wait just in front of the church.”\n\nThe rabbi was waiting and waiting and waiting, and it was getting late. Finally he got out of his car and went from the back door into the church to the confessional booth, where the bishop was listening to the confessions of people, and giving them punishments.\n\nThe rabbi said, “We are getting late, and there is a long queue; it won’t be finished by the evening. So I propose one thing: just let me see how the confession is being done. You do just two cases, and then you go and get ready, and I will finish this whole lot within minutes!”\n\nThe bishop said, “That’s great!” — so he showed him how.\n\nOne person said, “I have committed a rape.”\n\nThe bishop said, “Ten dollars in the charity box, and five Hail Marys.”\n\nThe rabbi said, “That’s enough! You go and get ready” — and he sat in the bishop’s chair.\n\nThere is a curtain and a small window so the identity of the person is not known, only the voice is heard.\n\nAnother man came, and he said, “I too have committed a rape.”\n\nThe rabbi said, “Twenty dollars into the charity box, and five Hail Marys.”\n\nThe man said, “The rates have gone higher within seconds! I heard … just now you have told the other person to give only ten dollars and five Hail Marys, and suddenly you are telling me twenty dollars?”\n\nThe rabbi said, “Don’t be worried, my son. Ten dollars are in advance. You can commit one rape more, no need to confess. I am in a hurry, just pass on.” And he finished the whole queue within minutes. He did not hear what they were saying; he said, “I already know. Rape, theft, murder — what else can you do? So just name the crimeCrime A positive or negative act in violation of penal law; an offense against the state classified either as a felony or misdemeanor., don’t describe it to me, don’t go into details. I don’t have much time. Just say, ‘Murder’; ten Hail Marys and thirty dollars in the charity box, and get lost!”\n\nThe Christians thought, “It is very strange. Our bishop never behaved like this!”\n\nBut by the time the bishop came he could not believe it. The booth was empty.\n\nThe rabbi said, “This is a small business, but you are doing well. In the synagogue we don’t have such an institution. This is absolutely against economic progress! I will try to start confession in the synagogue.”\n\nBut all the rabbis said, “Nonsense. That is Christian, that cannot be done here.”\n\nSo he went to meet the chief rabbi, and he told him, “They are doing so much business.\n\nAnd Jesus was a Jew. He was born a Jew, he lived a Jew, he died a Jew; he was never a Christian. He was our son! We should be the inheritors of all his business.”\n\nThe chief rabbi said, “Cool down.” His assistant was also present. The chief said, “We do business in a different way. Look at me: my synagogue is the most ultra-modern.”\n\nBoth the rabbis said, “What do you mean?”\n\nHe said, “I allow people to smoke cigarettes, or bring bottles of wine or beer — whatever they prefer. Everything inside the synagogue becomes holy. So people are coming … the synagogue is packed.”\n\nThe assistant said, “I have never told you, but I am doing better. I allow them to bring their girlfriends also — or boyfriends, as the case may be. And all these things are ordinary, beer and wine and cigarettes — that’s okay. They can even make love, because that is what our basic teaching is: love — and not only your wife, but also your neighbor’s wife: love! So there is such a crowd, and people are queueing outside, so we have to run the synagogue in shifts! Inside the synagogue everything is holy.”\n\nThe third man, who had come to find business, said, “I have understood. Now I am going to do something even better.”\n\nThey said, “What will you do?”\n\nHe said, “I am going to put a board in front of the synagogue that on every JewishJew “Being Jewish” is very important and not forgetting the Holocaust is religion over Halakha. Israeli Jews are divided into Haredi (Orthodox), Dati (reformed), Masorti (Conservative/traditional) or Hiloni (secular), nonetheless, their ethnoreligious identity was possibly originated in ancient Egypt and modified in Babylone. In their Synagogue, they read the Torah and pray for the coming of the Messiah, who would build global 'Israel', through which the Divine and Human would meet forever. holiday the synagogue will be closed. Let people enjoy! That is the basic principle — enjoyment. And for this enjoyment I am going to charge. I am giving them one holiday completely — no sermons, no sitting in the cold seats, that is unnecessary trouble for people. So they have to pay, and the synagogue will be closed on all Jewish holidays. It will be open otherwise — but only on Jewish holidays would the Jews come; on other days, nobody comes.”\n\nReligion has become a business — all religions — and it has become a business because you are searchingSearch Google SEO: Meaning> Relevance> Quality> Usability> Context dependence. Now, giving ten dollars and saying five Hail Marys, you feel unburdened — unburdened to commit another rape. It is cheap.\n\nAnd that’s why the pope says, “Don’t communicate directly with God, it is a sin!”\n\nObviously it is a sin, because how will the priest live? How will the Vatican bank live?\n\nIts turnover is perhaps the greatest of any bank: one hundred billion dollars per year — and all the moneyMoney Χρήματα, νόμισμα (currency), Old French monoie, Pecunia, Money supply, Reserve money, Monetary System, Money-laundering, Electronic Money, Money Transfer, Promissory notes.

Euro, Dollar, INR. is heroin money.\n\nThe Italian government has issued an arrest warrant for the bishop who was running the bank. They turn black money into white, it is the biggest mafia. But the Vatican, although just eight square miles, is a sovereign country, and the pope is not only the head of the Catholic churchCatholic Church Roman Catholic groups in communion with the Bishop of Rome. Mussolini allowed sovereignty to the Pope in 1929 over a tiny piece of Italian land. Vatican City is the central headquarters of Catholic Christians. Universal Catholic Church has been a dream in Christian account books, never existed apart from some ecumenical dialogues. Christians (church) are divided into more than 45000 denominations., he is also the head of the Vatican sovereign country, just eight square miles. The Italian government cannot enter there. So they were just waiting for that manager to come out — but he would not come out once he knew.\n\nAnd do you know what the pope has done to him? Rather than delivering him to the Italian government, because he is committing the greatest crime, and the pope goes on speaking against drugs and his bank is dealing only in drugs … All the money that he is spending on his tours …\n\nWhen the pope went to Australia, he spent eight million dollars. Just before him the queen of EnglandEngland In England, the Parliament was originally an advisory body summoned to consult with the monarch, and the courts exercised delegated royal powers, as “lions beneath the throne”. had gone there, and she spent only two million dollars. From where is this money coming?\n\nRather than giving him to the Italian government, he has made the bishop a cardinal, promoted him because he is the source of money.\n\nIt is true not only about the Catholic church, it is the situation with all religions. But why do people give? They need consolation, they need somebody to look up to, somebody who can promise them that they will be saved from hell and hellfire.\n\nHere, in this place, you have to learn to be dependent only on you.
