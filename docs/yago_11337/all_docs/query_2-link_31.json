        "text": "Siem (Siemese:[1] သဳာံမ; Malayan: ســلام ) officially the Kingdom of Siem (ကၟိန်ဍုင် ဂြပ် သဳာံမ) , and also known as Subarnabhumi[2] (သုဗာနာဗဟုမ), is a country located on Mainland Southeast Asia, and is situated between Mranma to the west, Rāmaññadesa and Muang Lao to its north, Kampuchea to its east, and Tanah Melayu to its south. Siem is a semi-centralized state consisting of eight kingdoms, along with the Andaman territory, which are led by the Subarnabhumi Princedom where the capital Tho Krung[3] is located in.\n\nThe Austroasiatic Mon people have continued to reside in Siem as one of the longest surviving people in Southeast Asia. The Mon would form numerous prosporus cities in Siem, as well as Muang Lao and Mranma. The largest of the early Mon civilizations was the Dvaravati culture along the Meta Dait river[4] (မာတ ဍာ်), were several Mon city-states rose. The largest of these was Lavo, who would spread its influence across the valley and north into Rāmaññadesa. By the 1000s, the Mon came under the influence of the Khmer Empire until the 1400s. During this time, the Mon states were divided but managed to defend themselves from migrating Tai people from the north who only managed to push the Mon from the area beyond the Mekong river. As the Khmer Empire began to decline, the Mon states were united by the city of Ayodhya and managed to expand Mon influence beyond the Meta Dait valley and into the Khorat platau and Malay peninsular. The collaspe of neighbouring Mon kingdoms in Mranma to the Burmese led to tensions between the two kingdoms. A key-point of conflict was over the Thuwunnabumi kingdom on the Andaman coast. In the mid 1700s, the Ayodhya kingdom would face defeat at the hands of the Toungoo Empire, who ended up burning down the capital Ayodhya twice. The resulting power vaccum led to the establishment of several successor states which were unified by Taksin the Great.[5] Taksin was however overthrowned by Rama I[6], whose descendants ended up re-expanding Siem into a great power, although it was never able to reclaim the Khorat platau from Muang Lao due to its rivalry with Viet Nam over both Muang Lao and Kampuchea.\n\nBy the late 1800s, King Chulalongkorn pioneered industrialization which pushed Siem as a major power. Rising nationalism allowed the King to consolidate power over Siem Proper, while also exerting power over northern Malay states. Prince Abhakara Kiartiwongse would renovate Siem's navy into a modern force and Siem managed to expand its control over African colonies. Chulalongkorn's children ended up marrying into several royal houses in Asia and Russia, and moved Siem towards an alliance with Japan. Its involvement in World War I led to the collaspe of Viet Nam and national prestige, while the Roaring 20s led to the rise of the Siemese automobile industry due to their control over rubber plantations in northern Malaya. However, the Great Depression struck the Siemese economy hard and led to unrest against the semi-absolute rule of the monarchs. The 1931 Siemese Revolution led to the implementation of a constitutional monarchy with a democratic parliament. Yet, a military coup in 1937 led to the exile of the Royal Family and the 11-year old Queen Bejaratana to Japan and deteriorating relations with the Fascist regime in Mranma led to the Mranman invasion of Siem in 1940. However, the incompetant army of Mranma was unable to conquer Siem, with Siem only falling when a coalition force of Axis countries invaded it from all sides except the south. Occupation of Siem would prove difficult for the Axix as Free Siem forces would end up liberating a majority of the country. The end of WW2 saw the return of the Royal Family and democracy, and decolonization of colonies in India and Africa. Economic growth in the 60s with the construction of a canal over the Kra Isthmus saw Siem propel itself as powerful economic power but stagnated into the 90s until rebouncing in the 2000s and declining in the 2020s.\n\nSiem is a stable parliamentary democracy with a constitutional monarchy. Its politics are split mainly between the two largest parties - the liberal Progressive Party and the conservative Democrat Party.[7] Siem's capital and largest city is Tho Krung. Siem is splitted into the Princedom of Subanarabhumi, which controls the area north of Malaya, and the Malayan principalities of Singgora, Perlis, Pattani, Loqstaq, Yala, Kota Bharu, and Kuala Terengganu. Each of the principalities are headed by a prince below the Monarch of Siem, while the monarch of Subanarabhumi is the Crown Monarch. This is due to the Mandala political system's significance. Since the 1970s, the Malayan areas have become more centralized and tied towards the Subanarbhumi Kingdom. Siem is a member of the United Nations, Asian Union, Council of South Asia[8]\n\nGovernment[]\n\nSubdivisons[]\n\nPrincipality of Subarnabhumi\n\nProvinces Map # Name Population 1\n\nခ Tho Krung\n\nထဝ် ကြုင်\n\nGolden River 2\n\nဂ Daitpain\n\nဍာ်ပါၚ်\n\nWater Mouth 3\n\nဃ Dakha Kwan\n\nနာမ် ကွာန်\n\nLotus Village 4\n\nင Chachoengsao\n\nဆာဆေါၚသူ\n\nDeep Canal (Chong language)\n\nMonarchs[]\n\nSiem\n\nFollowing the overthrow of Taksin's kingdom, Rama I replaced him as monarch and his descendants have ruled ever since. Up to 2005, succession laws favoured the sons of a monarch over their daughters. When King Rama VI died in 1925, he was succeeded by his 2-day old daughter, Bejaratana. Bejaratana ruled Siem as its first modern Queen from 1925 to her death in 2011, becoming the longest-reigning monarch in history at 85 years, 13 years longer than the second longest reigning, Ceasan Emperor Louis XIV."
