V«l, XXXVm ] JANUARY, I No. 1 BUDDHA Highest and best of all Earth’s great and good, Thou towerest over all with noble mien, As far around that lofty heights is seen, Where lies the perfect path of Brotherhood. There in thy pristine glory thou hast stood From the dim hoary ages, still to guide Men from a sorrowing world to goodness’ side. Bidding them tread upon the righteous road. Like those high hills that skirt thy native land. Others have fringed along the etherial height. And reared their crests to meet the eternal light. Peak beyond peak, in solemn pomp they stand. Nathless thy peerless crest, unchallenged, free. In lonely grandeur. Time shall ever see. From “The Poems” by Dr. H. W. B. Moreno. DIRECTABILiTY By J. F. McKechnie. Directability is a clumsy word which however has the advantage of bearing its meaning on its face, and will receive further elucidation in this brief paper ; for the intrinsic nature of the power of life, the mind within us, is well expressed in the idea involved in the word direction. It is as though the power to accomplish the aims of Life lay not so much in some interior source within the mind, as in the power possessed by the Mind — once its ignorance of the nature of the lines of causation involved is ended or diminished — of wielding or directing the great forces of nature which operate in the universe about us so that these forces shall themselves unite, or counter- balance one another, and their action issue in the production of the aims of life. One of our greatest physicists has pictured a mechanical demon standing at the heart of the play of forces in the various phenomena of nature, directing one force this way, and another that, and so producing the result eventually obtained. In a parallel manner we may imagine Mind itself standing in the midst of the vast interplay of the forces of Being, itself, so to speak, owning none of these forces, yet, simply by its under- standing of them, able to produce such combinations, and hence such results, as it may will or choose. This directing power of life is to be observed in our every function, and in all our actions, voluntary or involuntary. We see it at work in the lower levels of our beings. We human beings, indeed, have so far travelled beyond these lower levels that the operation of the forces there no longer reach our normal consciousness ; we are, as we say, unconscious of them. The heart beats, the lungs breathe, the stomach digests, without DIRECTABILITY 3 our being aware of the action of these important organs, until it happens that they go out of order, when we become only too painfully aware of their refusal to act properly. Neverthe- less, when all is going well with these processes and functions of the body, direction is still playing its part — all unconscious of it as we may be — in the assimilation of the various elements that go to build up our bodily frames. Here Life, the complex of life-elements within us, on the one hand seizes upon the hydro-carbons and azotised hydro-carbons of our food-stuffs, and on the other hand lays hold of the oxygen of the air and, by its direction of these elements, so brings them together that they are able to combine in just that fashion which involves Life’s own continuance. We have an exactly parallel instance of the action of direction before our eyes every day, present to our ordinary consciousness, when we use coal as fuel in our engines and, by a series of combinations not so very different from those which take place in our own processes of nutrition, obtain from the chemical union of these elements the power and heat whereby our towns are lit and warmed. This directing power of Life is indeed such a fundamental, characteristic element of its nature that in most respects we should almost be justified in ceasing to regard the power to direct as merely a function of Life, merely one of its attributes, and come to consider Life itself as — if 1 may use the word ■with which 1 have ventured to head this paper — Directability. This idea receives still more ob'vious rmd evident corrobora- tion in those higher levels of Life which we term the Mind, our ’’selves,” to wit, in the world of the operations of the thought stuff. Right understanding of the meaning of life is for us bound up with right direction of the thought-forces which surround us. Such is the nature of all our knowledge, of all our higher insight, nay, even of all our wisdom. To the Arahan, the Attained, the Fully-enlightened, and to the worldling, the Puthujjana, in the course of their intercourse with their fellows through speech and books, there come alike the same fundeimental, elementary ideas, similar items of 4 THE MAHA-BODHl nourishment for their thought. But there is this great difference between them, a difference which constitutes the precise line of demarcation between Arahan and Puthujjana, and that is, that the Arahan, the Completed Man, possesses the power of the right direction of the various thought-elements that come to him, so that his mind, as it were, can build out of them a Cosmos, whereby he becomes master of his cheiracter, and so of his destiny ; while the Puthujjana, lacking this power of righdy combining these very same thought-elements, is dominated by Avijja, by Nescience, which have such supreme reign over him that from his heeirt he is able to bring forth only a Chaos. The universe — that is to say, the reflection of his own mind, projected outwardly — seems to him a thing devoid of sense and power auid purpose. As we say in common parlance, he does not know why he is alive, and has no idea of where he would like to go in life. His existence is devoid of ali aim or purpose save such immediate matters as demand his scrutiny 2md attention moment by moment. To those of us who may reasonably suppose ourselves to stand somewhere on the long, hard path of life which lies between these two extremes of worldliness and wisdom, it thus becomes the viteJ business of our lives to grasp and com- prehend the quarter in which resides this power of direction. It becomes a matter of vital moment to us to learn how we may rightly utilise these powers of life, of thought, all about us, in such a manner as to bring our ships of life a little nearer to Wisdom’s further shore. We, of our very selves, are nothing. We are Sunham, Emptiness. Of our sole selves we possess neither force, nor voice, nor power of motion, on the Path. But, to the extent that we have Wisdom, to the extent that we are possessed of Understanding, — to that extent we are able to act upon that which momenteirily exists, upon Life which is always suffering simply by reason of ist Nescience. And this, the higher sort of Right Direction, — this is what we Buddhists mean by walking on the Path. DIRECTABILITY 5 Hence it is that to walk upon the Path in this manner means to take active, conscious part in Life’s wide destiny. It means to assist in the directing, not of an imagined self towards some great goal of happiness, but in the directing of Life itself towards the inner purpose of its being, towards the disentanglement of this its present knottedness, towards the fulfilment of a purpose that we can only grasp to the extent that we draw nearer and nearer to it. In the cumbrous mode of thought through speech which is all we at present possess, our best mode of expressing that aim is by thinking of the Goal as Sorrow’s End ; by thinking of it as Peace, as Power, as glory of Full Comprehension, in place of the gloom of Nescience, the strife, the weakness and the pain of never understanding, which constitute the burden of the life we now know and live. This thought, this idea, that in reality of ourselves we are destitute of power, and yet, by virtue of Direction, may succeed in so utilising life’s own illimitable forces as to bring more near the fulfilment of the purpose and plan of life, — this idea, rather, this veritable fact, is the basis of the ancient teaching of the doctrine of Non-action. It is the counterpart upon the active, motor side of life, of the doctrine of the Non- self in the world of concepts. To “act non-action’’ — in the words of Lao-Tze — is what we have to achieve if we would WcJk upon the Path. The whole of the long line of attainment which for us lies between our present lifetime and that Beyond whereunto Life is turning, is a line, a Path whereon we have no feet to tread, whereby we have no power of passing, saving only as we are able to penetrate the inner life of nature, of existence, and bend and blend its changing powers to the well- directed motion of our Way. If, then, we of ourselves own no interior fount of power such as might provide the pathward-moving force we seek, but must needs use Life’s own forces, must learn to blend and combine eind counterbalance these, till from their sundry and contrasted elements a new, a GocJward-tending power 6 THE MAHA-BODHI streams forth, — if we are to be able, consciously and of set purpose, to bring into that creative force, turning towards a new life, which can impel us towards the Other Shore, it becomes for us a matter of primary importai.ee to understand the nature of the powers of life all about, to learn the most suitable method of using them, to acquire a knowledge of the best way to combine them or set one against the other, so that the motive power we seek may dawn within our hearts. Before we can direct, we must learn to discern. And just because the higher mental powers are so subtle, even if they are so powerful, we require to gain a power of discernment, of discrimination, fsu in advance of that which is needed in deeding with the grosser and more palpable forces of the material world. What is the nature of this discernment, so necessary to Right Direction, we shall leave for further, con- sideration in another paper. MY TRIP TO INDIA By Pandita T. Gunavardhana of Colombo.* The Headquarters of the Mahabodhi Society of India are in Calcutta. Here in a large hall which possesses suitable seating accommodation, lectures and Sermons on Buddhism are often delivered. The Dharma Rajika Vihara erected by the Anagarika Dharmapala with its walls frescoed in Ajanta style is a beautiful and sacred place of worship — within the Vihara there in a small Chaitya of polished granite is enshrined a golden casl^et containing relics of the Buddha and which was presented to Maha-Bodhi Society by the Government of India. The Mahabodhi Society provides also accommodation to Buddhist pilgrims. Of the points of interest in profusion * Extracts from a lecture delivered in Colombo by Mr. Gunavardhana. MY TRIP TO INDIA 7 found in Calcutta by the Student, I have mentioned only a few. From Calcutta to Gaya is 292 miles. In the latter place there is a pilgrim Rest put up by the Mahabodhi Society. Buddha Gaya is 7 miles away and there are horses and traps that ply for hire between them. At Buddha Gaya there is a Resthouse for the use of visitors specially Buddhists visiting the “Mahabodhi,” The thrill of fervent emotion that runs through very nerve and fibre as the Buddhist pilgrim touches with his hands the Crystal throne where our Lord gained omniscience, it is im- possible to describe. Facing this crystal throne is a mighty chaitya around which are found numerous images of the Tathagata as also throughout the neighbouring lands for a space of two or three acres. Most of those had become the target of the iconoclastic Mohamedan and are found invariably shorn of limb or other part of the body. The image of the Buddha in the Shrine room had been carved out of rock and covered completely by a thick layer of gold— a dazzling sight to behold. On the Southern side of the shrine flows the river Neranjara. The Ajapal Nuga tree is on its opposite bank. The Dammissari cave where the Buddha for six years performed deep penance in the search of truth, is also hard by. I shall not labour explaning the religious or historical significance of each as they are well-known to you all. Here too is a Museum containing time-worn stone slabs, large images, stone pillars with carvings and inscriptions as also a large variety of old earthernware which will be of great interest and importance to students of Oriental history. Buddhagaya and and the lands once offered to it are now the property of the Mahanta. From Gaya to Rajagaha via Patna (Pataliputra) is 107 miles- Rajgirkund is the name of the Railway Station and is within sight of the holy city which is several miles in extent. There is a very comfortable and neatly kept Burmese pilgrim rest and 8 THE MAHA-BODHI Vihara there in charge of a very kind hearted Burmese Bhikkhu. You may have perhaps heard of the Buddhist accounts of Rajagaha. It appears to have been sin-rounded by a ivall -with 32 large and 64 small gates. There are still traces of this gigantic -wall ; but not of the gates. The old City -was, as you are a-ware, built by King Bimbisara -whilst Ajatasatta strengthened the defence against invasions. The first place of importance this side of the Royal City Rajagaha was Veluvana Vihara, gift of King Bimbisara to the Buddha. It was the first fixed place of residence for the Buddha and the Sangha. Veluvana is the name of the Garden. Kalandahas (squirrels) received their food there by order of the King and hence it was called “Kalandak.anivapa.” On the North of Rajagaha was Sita Vana where was a pretty little Vihara in which the Buddha used to reside occa- sionally. In the same direction is “Piphaliguha,” a cave used by “Maha Kasyapa” for meditation. Then we come to a very delightful and famous place in Rajagaha “Saptaparniguha” on the North slope of the Vihara. where the Bhikkhus resided. On the level ground below the opening of this cave in a specially built Audience- hall the first great convocation took place presided over by Maha Kasyapa. The next site is the \"AmbaVana” where Jeeva\\a, physician of King Bimbisara’s royal household as well as of the Buddha and the Sangha resided. It is between the Rajagaha city wall and Gijjhakuta in which last has a special sanctity attached to it, in that it was the most favourite moun- tain resort of our Great Teacher and where some of his important sermons were delivered. Isigili where Maha Moggallana died is by the side of Gijjhakuta. Both are covered with jungles now and one can approach as far as the foot on these mountains only. The next place of importance in “Tapoda Nadi” where there are several hot water springs. They are said to be MY TRIP TO INDIA 9 in existence from the Buddha’s time ; and the water which is just sufficiently warm for a comfortable bath, is claimed to possess great curative powers. Be it what it may, we had several refreshing baths in one named Brahma Kund or Brahma’s spring. From Rajagaha to Nalanda the distance is 9 miles by road. Between these two places at a sight called “Ambalath- thika” the Buddha delivered his famous Brahma Jala Sutra. At Nalanda are found relics of stupendous architectural and decorative undertaking. Nalanda was well known in ancient times by its university. It was one of the most famous centres of learning in the East. TTie excavations show that its grounds must have covered well over a 1000 acres. The Indian Department of Archaeological Survey employ over a 100 men daily to unearth and clear these huge structural ruins of the past. Already they have cleeired some hundreds of class rooms. Instructors’ cubicles and over a 1000 rooms — row on row — 8 ft. by 12 ft. with shelves for books and beds for reclining, carved out of living rock. These must have been the rooms of students. In the vicinity are found numerous ruins of chaltlyas too. Nalanda v/as once one of the principal centres of Buddhist education. Evidence to prove this has come to light now. You find the ruins of a good number of Buddhist temples and in the days of yore a large number of Bhikkhus lived there learning Dhamma. Kings Ajasattu and Asoka are said to have built many a temple in imitation of those at Rajagaha. At an epoch later than the above men- tioned, the University at Nalanda become the chief centre of Education in India. That there must have resided 2 or 3 thousand lecturers and many times this number of pupils, is evident from the ruins. This town flourished best in the times of Buddhist Kings and is said to have achieved its acme of fame and usefulness during the reign of the Buddhist King Triloka Vijaya (literally conqueror of the three worlds). This Triloka Vljaya wearing about his neck a necklace from which hang several small images of the Buddha and standing on a pedestal 2 10 THE MAHA-BC»DHI above Siva and his wife Parvati, is depicted in a stone slab. It signifies the fact of his having been a Saivite and of his later adherence to the Buddhist faith. Here again the Mohamedan Emperors were the first agents of destruction. From Nalanda to Benares is 200 miles, but from Ben 2 U-es to Isipatana (Saranath) only 6 miles, Benares which now supplies silks and brass ware cheap was in the past a home ol learning. Every Buddhist knows that the Blessed one preached his first sermon Dhammacakh<^ (the wheel of the Law) at Saranath or Isipatanarama. He is also said to have spent many rainy seasons in this City. There is no evidence, however to show that any Chaitiyas, Viharas or Shrines existed there before the Asoka Era. The Dharmarajika Stupa, the Dhammiha Stupa and a column 20 ft. high built probably during that time are now in a very delapidated state. There is a oestibule 150 ft. by 3 ft. 7 in. by 5 ft. 7 in., in a state of preservation. Right in front of the Dharmarajika Stupa is a vast stretch of glistening rock cool and refreshing, where I suppose, in days gone by the devotees assembled for their devotions and to hear the Dhamma for both of which purposes it is eminently fitted. Tbe Mahabodhi Society, I found, had set up a School here for Buddhist education, and a retiring room for Buddhist pilgrims. In the Museum built here by Government in 1910 are preserved finds of the Archaeological Department and the innumerable 2 incient images of the Buddha and finials of Stupas .Bodhisatvas and Deities, scenes from the life of the Buddha carved on stone, aim bowls, specimens of old potteries clay seals, water jugs and cups and terra cotta toys and beauti- ful bricks and all sorts of building stones which are very interesting and instructive. A new Vihara, spacious and full of archetectural beauty, called \"Mulagandha Kuti” is being constructed here by the Anagarika and of this nearly half the work is over. Form Isipatana to Kusinara is 114 miles. The pilgrim has to get down from his train at Thasil Deoria and go by car or cab for a distance of 23 miles. MY TRIP TO INDIA tl A Burmese Rest House, the Matha Kuvar Vihara, the Parinibbana Chetiya and the Addhana Chetiya are found here. The Parinibbana Chetiya first built by the Malla Kings and rebuilt by Asoka has been kept in repair by the present Gov- ernment. A charming sight of a 14 cubit image of the Buddha is a reclining posture meets one’s gaze. The Adahana Chetiya is now nothing but a heep of bricks. Lauria Lakanpur in the Chanparam District, 60 miles from Kusinara possesses the first relic measure enshrined in the Kumbha Chetiya. At the Burmee rest house at Kusinara I met a Sinhalese Upasaka Mr. M. A. Peris, a pensioneer of the Ceylon Government who observing the ten precepts and instructing young Brahmin boys in the Dhamma is spending the rest of his life in its service. It was between Tahsil Deoria and Kusinara in a village called Kasia that Mdhd Kdsyapa who was on his way to meet the Tathagata first received intimation of the Maha Parinibbana. These parts of the country are yet rich in agri- cultural products which include different kinds of grain. Sixteen miles to the West of Kusinara are Jetavanarama and Purvarama whch are now known as Saheth and Maheth respectively. At Jetavanarama is the Ananda Bodhi-tree. Here over a broad space of soil covering 500 acres or more one finds the ruins of some which, such as the Buddha’s own Gandha-J^uti, only the foundations remain. These parts had once been occupied by Arahats. Even today one can see the Water tank, stone pipe and drain where the Buddha daily per- formed his ablutions. After completing my pilgrimage to these places, I set out for Sanchi and Ajanta and on my way spent a few days at Agra and Delhi. Agra a large and historic town possesses the Taj Mahal considered one of the wonders of the world. This is a 13 storied building of pure marble built in 1631 by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. Its eu-chitect was one Mohamed Isen. On the topmost floor are the “Mausoleum” of the emperor and that of his queen. On 12 THE MAHA-BODHI the ground floor are found their portraits and other eirticles of antique interest. Emperor Shah Jahan’s wife is said to have been very beautiful and they say that it was built to symbolise her grace and elegance. Situated at a bend of the river Jumna, to one travelling by train it appears in the far distance like a white bird on a tree top. Tbe pearl like marble set off against the greenery of the garden around when seen on a full moon night presents a most entrancing sight which anyone who has had the good fortune to behold, can never forget. Agra is famous for screens of pierced marble the work of skilled stone masons cind 2 Jso for its embroidered curtciins and millinery. Some reproductions of the Taj Mahal in Silver and Gold thread on coloured silk or dark velvet curtains are very beautiful. Amongst the collection of articles which I saw are found on the ground floor of the Taj Mahal was a stone-head of a Buddha image. Looking at these articles one begins to think whether the muslim Emperors could not have ransacked the Buddhist places of worship to build and beautify their places with the valuable art treasures derived therefrom. The grounds of the Taj Mahal are strewn with numerous tanks emd fountains of luxurious foliage, bearing abundant fruit. Its custodians eue now the Government of India. Delhi is 122 miles North of Agra. Old Delhi left behind by the Hindus 2 Uid which lies now in ruins, will still reconstruct the history of India. The events that have taken place round about it have left so many traces behind it as to be sufficient to read the past. On a Metal Column which exists in a wonderful state of preservation is an inscription to the following effect ; — “So long as I stand, the Hndu Kingdom shall endure.” Within a short distance of this iron column is an Asoka monolith proclaiming the King’s equitable laws to his subjects at a time when Buddhism was the state religion. When Buddhism declined Hinduism gained ground only in turn to give way to Islam. There is yet a 3rd pillar of red and yellow MY TRIP TO INDIA 13 Stone built durng the Mohamaden period. This pillar over- looks the Hindu metal column and is called “Qutab Minar. It is 238 ft. high with a diameter of 47 ft. at the base and contains 278 steps. From the top of this Minar can be seen the depressing sight of old Delhi in a mass of ruins. Other importcint and historically interesting structures in perfect condition are the tomb oj Humayun, son of Babar who established the Moghul Empire in India. The audience Hall with its finely carved marble screens and the delicate mural decorations, constitutes the glory of the Fort. It is said that when Emperor Shah Jahetn saw the Chambers com- pleted, he exclaimed : — “If there is heaven, it is here.” Work in connection with new Delhi is being pushed forward with all speed. It is within a short distance of the wreckage of old Delhi. To perpetuate the glory of a glorious past the British architects and engineers who are responsible for the lay out of the city and for plans of the principal build- ings which now rapidly come up, are doing their best to produce work which will not only be harmonious with the existing surrormdings but will also answer all modern require- ments. Palaces of the Rajas, the Secretariat and other Govern- ment buildings some of which are already completed are having ein envious effect on the other cities of India. Delhi to Sanchi is a distance of 409 miles by the Railway. The group of Sanchi Stupas numbering 3 is only a few hundred yards from the little wayside station of Sanchi in the Bhopal State. The existence of those monuments is not due to more chance. Not very far from the city there once stood Vedisa and Ujjani famous cities where Buddhism flourished. They had selected these commanding summits of the neighbouring hills to build memorials and monasteries in the same manner as those of Buddha Gaya, Saranath and Kusinara which of course commemorate some act of the Master s life, as for example his enlightenment at Buddha Gaya, His first sermon at Saranath and his Parinibbana (pEissing away) at Kusinara. 14 THE MAHA-BODHl Emperor Asoka was to Buddhism what Constantine was to Christianity. Devi, one of the queens of Asoka who hailed from Vedisa is said to have built the chief {No. I) of the 3 stupas, one of the most perfect examples of Buddhist architecture in India. The hill on which these monuments are clustered wais then known as Chetiyagiri and in its neighbourhood was found a quarry of sand stone with which the Buddhist builders built those magnificient Stupas. They are enclosed by a circuit wall of solid stone construction with richly carved gateways or “toranas” four in number, one in the North, one South, one West and one in the E.ast, which have survived in such remark- able preservation for nearly 20u0 years. On the pillars and superstructure are illustrated several Jataka scenes from the life of Buddha, such as Vessantara Jaiaka, Chaddanta fataka, etc. They are also adorned with standing dwarfs, images of men and women, lions, elephants, the sacred wheel, etc. About 50 yards North East of this great Stupa (No. 1) above mentioned is Stupa No. 3 almost similar but smaller where General Conningham discovered the relics of Sariputta and Mahamoggallana, the two great disciples of the Buddha, in two separate stone boxes distinctly inscribed \"Sariputtasa” ( = of Sariputta) and \"Mahamoggallanasa” ( = of Maha- moggallana). Of the subsidiary buildings there, the most importamt one is the Cheitiya Hall or temple, standing just opposite the South entrance, of the Great Stupa (No. 1). Much has been done in recent years by the archaeological Department in excavation work ; but 1 am inclined to the belief that buried underneath and about those Stupas will be found many more relics of old Sanchi. Ajanta is a village about 38 miles from Jalgaon which is 287 miles from Sanchi. One can reach the very foot of the cave temples or monasteries conveniently by Motor Car. This spot has been selected by pious monks about 300 years eifter the Buddha for their religious retirement. There are altoghther MY TRIP TO INDIA 15 27 of these monasteries spreading in horse shoe fashion round the baisin of a mountain, opening off verandahs. The roof is supported by masses of rock carved into pillars. The magni- tude of the toil involved in creating these chambers can only be realised after the visitor has ascended the steps and begun to examine them one by one. At a time when explosives were not k.nown, only hands driven by religious zeel could have chiselled away several thousands of tons of rocl^ to hand down to us such a priceless art heritage. The front of some of the chambers is pierced above the door in the shape of a half moon and in almost all caves the ceiling is left flat painted with figures and scenes from the Jatakas. The walls too are painted or covered with a profusion of statues out in solid rock. In each cave is a shrine room with an image of the Buddha in a sitting and meditating posture and several cells containing stone heads with raised pillows, for monks to sleep. They are approximately 12 ft. broad, 15 ft. long and 7 ft. high and 10 to 15 of them are found in each cave. There are over 300 such cells altogether. It is surprising to find how light and air pour into most of these caves which are almost three quarters of a circle in shape. No artificial light is necessary unless for the examina- tion of the Innermost painting and carvings minutely. In one shrine is depicted Buddha s Parinibbana surrounded by monks in attitude of grief. It is wonderful how well, in the paintings that are now left, the colours prepared from local materials have stood through so many centuries. The carvings and paintings possessing great historical and sociological value have no doubt been executed by experts and no sufficiently eloquent tribute can be paid to their work which has already inspired the young Indians of the Bengal School of art. 500 Arahats are said to have lived in the cells of these Ajanta cave temples. From here we travelled down to Bombay a distance of about 300 miles, cut across Central India via Raichur, arrived at Madras and returned home Via Talaimannar. 16 THE MAHA-BODHI I might just make a passing reference to the “Towers of silence where the Parsees expose their dead to the vultures. A commemding sight of the whole town of Bombay can be had from those towers which are 4 in number. Such a sight I am told is found no where else in the world. In point of relgious interest, in point of scientific interest, in point of historical interest to us, India has no parallel and it is almost a duty of all Sinhalese, of Buddhists and Buddhist Workers in particular, to visit this sacred land. There is much there one can see, admire and adore. The preservation and protective Ccire extended to the Buddhist shrines and places of worship — places which once felt the presence of the Great Teacher — are the results of the labours of the Anagmika Dharmapala and of Burmese Buddhists. To them 1 must not deny their proper meed of praise. HAS BUDDHISM A MESSAGE FOR YOU ? By a. C. March Editor of \"Buddhism in England.\" [One of a course of ten minute addresses given on the occasion of the Buddhist “Wesak” Festival in London, 4th May, 1928] One of our prominent writers declared, in an euticle in the Press a few days ago, that the cause of all trouble and unrest afflicting the West — its social unrest, its political ferment, its religious chaos, could be summed up in one word. Fear. The writer was a woman, and whether her decision W 2 is a fieish of feminine intuition or not, I do not know, but her expression of opinion interested me, because I had eirrived at the same opinion myself, not by intuition, but by reasoning. It was Fear that caused the last Great Wair, euid if there is HAS BUDDHISM A MESSAGE FOR YOU 1 7 another still greater looming ahead — as many think — ^its cause too will be fear. Fear prevails everywhere ; those who believe God fear Him, those who do not, fear — ^they know not what ! the Devil of their imagination, probably. If we are to get rid of our troubles — Political, Social, Religious ; if we are to live as we ought to live, peaceably, harmoniously ; devoting our energies to the elimination of suffering and ugliness, to the creation of joy and beauty, to the acquirement of wisdom, we must eradicate fear. Fear is a form of egoism, of selfishness ; we must get rid of egoism, we must banish fear. In the place of fear we must have Hope, Faith, Certainty. In the old days, the days that are past, man put his trust in religion. He trusted its Teaching, he trusted its Teachers. But the old dogmas no longer satisfy, and the Churches have nothing to put in their place. They fiddle while Rome bums. They fiddle with the weighty problems of vestments and mbrics, they fiddle with ritualistic hocus-pocus, while the thinking man, the enquiring mind, seeks for light in his spiritual darkness. Finding no help from religion he turns to Science. Science at least is honest, it does not assert until it feels sure that it knows. But Science is an unstable support, neverthe- less ; its opinions change, and unfortunately it would seem, from our past experience, that those theories which it holds most surely to be true are those which it is most likely to change. We csinnot trust Science, because it builds its dogmris solely on material bases, it is purely physical, purely materiEJ- istic. Religion, on the other hand, tends to ignore this world — to become too other-worldly — and superstitious credence takes the place of reason. We want a religion which follows the mean, the Middle Way between materialism, which views this life as the only life, and an idealistic other- worldliness, which sees the Real only in a sphere beyond the stars. It is such a Religion which we offer you. Buddhism is the Middle Way between the extremes of worldliness and 3 18 THE MAHA-BODHI other-worldliness, between the extremes of materialism and the extremes of idealism, between a too-depressing pessimism and a too light-hearted optimism. It is essentially a practical religion ; rationzJ, dynamic, pragmatic. Buddhism is scientific : it teaches Evolution. It teaches the ever-progressive evolution of the Life through the ever greater perfection of the Form. It supplies the missing link- Not a physical missing link, not a material missing link, but a super-physical one. It is scientific for its basic principle is that of the Universality of Law : but again, it extends the opera- tion of that Law beyond the physical, and declares its imiversality by including in its embrace the Super-physical ; the moral and mental spheres. It declares that as a man sows, so shall he reap. It declares this, not in the half-hearted way that Western religion has accepted a verse in its Scriptures,* but it teaches it whole-heartedly and without reservations. For it asserts that as a man reaps so has he sown ; and that assertion has striking implications, if you will only think them out. If he is reaping what he has sown, when did he sow? He romes into birth reaping. His environment, his faculties ; his weaknesses ^md his strength, all are his because he has made them — created them by his thinking and his doing in the past. Man, therefore, so Buddhism teaches, is an evolving being progressing towards perfection. I do not say ultimate perfec- tion, — ^probably there is no such thing as ultimate and final perfection, — ^but comparative perfection. A perfection which most of us are very far from at present. And it is by reliance on, by working with, that Unswerving Law, that that perfec- tion is achieved. Now you will see where that Freedom comes in, which is the Buddhist’s boast, — ^when he does boast. ‘‘Buddhism — the proudest assertion of human freedom ever made,” — declared Sir Edwin Arnold. Tbe Buddhist has no Cause for Fear : the Good Law is undeviating, the Goal is Perfection. A Law of Perfect Justice HAS BUDDHISM A MESSAGE FOR YOU 19 is the only Reality. The Buddhist feaus not the caprice of any Deity. He needs no God, he relies on his own innate limitless powers to work out his own saJvation, to attain his certain goal. And Buddhism not only tells of the omnipresence of Law, of the Unity of Life, and of man’s splendid destiny, but it gives him sure guidance on the Way. He who trod that Way, He who was the personification of that Way, the Supremely Ejilightened One, gave us a plan, a scheme of scientific self- discipline, self-control : control of the body ; control of the emotions ; control of the mind. Illuminated and guided by the intuition, the mind is brought into harmony with that state which transcends the limitations and evils of existence and it dwells in the Joy and Peace of Nirvana, beyond the change, impermeinence and sorrow of existence. And if your mind dwells in that state of bliss and peace indescribable, you will radiate love and peace around you. Thus, and thus only, will you remove evil, disharmony, discontent, and establish in their place the Permanence of Peace, the Stability of Wisdom, the Joy of Love. Buddhism annihilates Feeir ; it substitutes the certainty of the Good Law for the uncertainty of Gods and Devils. It teaches that man himself is God, his own creator and the creator of heaven or hell around him. It releases him from the tyranny of Gods, from the Fear of Death and Hell ; it bestows Courage, Self-reliance, Peace. I have said — ^we must replace Fear by Certadnty. Buddhism does replace fear by certainty. Certainty based on personal experience — the only certainty. As the disciple practises the Five Moral Precepts, binding on every Buddhist : enjoining Compassion, Honesty, Purity, Sincerity, Temperance ; as he treads the Noble Eightfold Path, he finds evidence of the truth of its teaching, so that doubt fades away, and faith becomes imshakable certainty. Doubt is rejilaced by Certainty ; Egoism by Altruism : Hatred by Love ; Fear by Peace. Such me the basic principles of the Dhamma, the Wisdom, 20 THE MAHA-BCOHI Religion. Such is the religion which has conquered more lands than any other religion has done, has won more adherents than any other : and has won them, not by force, not by bribery, not by fear, but by the practice of the principles it advocates : Morality, Justice, Love. Has so noble a creed no message for the West? Has the West no need for its message.” 1 leave that for you to decide. Two years ago I broadcast our Wesak Greetings to the world from 2LO by the courtesy of the British Broadcasting Corporation. Since the establishment of the Board of Religious Control, however, we have been denied that privilege. Another example of Fear, we can be sure. My Wesak Message to those present is : to the un- converted : Study Buddhism, it may have a Message for you. To the converted : Carry the message of your glorious Feiith to your fellowmen ; in the EUist and in the West. WHAT INDIA NEEDS By S. Haldar. It W£ts observed by the late Lord Rosebery that thinking is em art which stands a chance of perishing from among his coimtrymen. Public opinion, everywhere, represents merely the repetition of a few leading men’s thoughts ; and the masses of the people eire content to tamely follow their leaders. In India this is more strikingly evident owing to the illiteracy of the masses. In Mr. Pramatha Nath Bose, the eminent Bengali writer on historical subjects, we have 2 m original thinker of great acuteness. His latest work “Swau-aj — Cultural and Political”* contains many strikingly original ideas. It will surprise most * W. Newman and Co., Calcutta. Pages 290, Ra. 4/-. WHAT INDIA NEEDS 21 people to leeo’n that India was a nation until very recently and that until about the closing years of last century Hindus and Muslims lived in fraternal ^unity. According to Mr. Bose Elnglish education has produced a disintegrating effect in this respect. “Back to the past” is his war-cry. It would almost seem that the return to the peist advocated by him eis a remedy for om present distractions implies a retu.n to the loin-cloth days when men hunted with bows emd arrows. He deprecates mass education as it tends to draw away our best artisans from their hereditary callings. He joins hands with Mahatma Gandhi in advocating the Chariiha as a merms of India’s ScJvation, although he does not go so far as to say that it is the only means. These things will startle many. But he lerJly means to advance a plea for a simpler and less encumbered life, for less luxury and less mummydom and one that is more in keeping with the older Indian ideals. He does not mean that the old world was perfect and that it needs no improvement. As to India being a national unit it has been pointed out by Professor Nagendranath Ghose (in “The Ramayana and the Mahabhcirata : a Sociological Study’ ’) that in the time of the Mahabhmat Society in India wets atomistic and individual- istic in its composition. There is no trace in the epic of a commimal life. Patriotism must have been a sentiment unknown to king and subject alike. There was nothing like national solideuity eunongst the Hindus when the Greeks invaded northern India or even when, in later times, the forces of Islaun over-rem the country. Things have gone from bad to worse. Mr. Bose has conjured up a purely imaginary picture of India as a nation. It may be doubted if even at the present day the conception of nationality extends much beyond the very limited circle of Indians who are the products of Western education. Religion has been in India a dividing EJid estranging force. The teaching of Sri Krishna, that all paths lead to one God, has been known only to a handful of learned Punditas. The 22 THE MAHA-BODHI Hindu masses have always regaurded non-Hindus as untouch- able, Ccdling them “Anaryas”, “Yavans” and “Mlechchas” ; emd even the learned Pundits have failed to follow in practice the teaching of the Geeta. The Muslims, on the other hand, have had through the influence of their religion (which teaches the doctrine of exclusive salvation) nothing but contempt for the Hindus as infidels. In the circumstances real amity has been non-existent, although the two communities have lived side by side for about a thousand yems. The destructive results of Muslim rule on Hindu ^md Buddhist art and litera- ture is a fact which cannot be ignored. We do not read of Hindu-Muslim riots under the Moghal Emperors simply because the Hindus were too feeble and cowed down to be able to stand up against members of the ruling race, just as, at the present day, stand-up fights between Indians and members of the ruling race are as rare as daisies in December. Sir Jadimath Sarkar has observed : “The Indian Muslims have, through succeeding centuries, retmned the extra-Indian direction of their hearts.” Semitic culture has not amal- gamated with Aryem culture. As to the Hindus, their own social divisions have been detrimental to nationhood. Even eunongst particular castes there are subdivisions which prevent complete social unity. TTiere can be no inter-meuriage between a Bengali Rarhi Brahmin and a Barendra Breihmin and there are untouchables (like Sonar-Beiniar Brahmans, Kaibartar Brahmans and Pirali Brahmans) even amongst Brzdimans. These divisiorig have been long in xeistence and all talk of removing untouchability in the interests of national unity have so far proved ineffectual. TTiese cire the main practical problems for the Hindus. Mr. Bose has not much to say about them. He speaks of Islamic monotheism as having exerted a wholesome influence on Hinduism. He has derived this theory from Elnglish writers on Indian history. Sanskrit literature and the Hindu religion in its higher aspects were unknown to the English even in the middle of the eighteenth WHAT INDIA NEEDS 23 century. Dugald Stewart heard of Sanskrit literature but did not believe in its genuineness. To the learned Brahmans monotheism was no new idea and the masses of the Hindus have always been rank idolaters in spite of the example of Islam. The ignorance of the Hindus has tied them down for ages to custom and tradition. Krishnamurti has truly said : “There is hardly a country in the world in which the dead hand of tradition lies so heavily as it does in India. This is the true Indian problem. Solve it and everything which keeps India back today will melt away like the mormng mist.” Rabindranath Tagore has similarly observed : The fetters that we forge in the name of religion enchain the spiritual man more securely than worldly ties. The slavish adherence to custom on the part of the majority of the so- called educated classes was manifested in Bengl when the greatest of Indian social reformers, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, raised a hornet's nest about his ears by pleading for the re- marriage of child widows, and the same mentality is being shown now, more than half a century later, in regard to the recent legislative measures for the prevention of pre- mature material relations and for raising the age of consent for girls in the interests of humanity generally and of racial improvement in particular. The grossly pernicious system of selling bridegrooms to the highest bidder has so far defied all attempts at removal. The Hindu masses while making offerings to Muslim Peers, and bowing down Before Mosques and Churches regard the persons of Muslims and Christians as unclean. Mr. Bose would not remove their ignorance or interfere with their pathetic contentment. He is, on the other hand, satisfied that the Hindu already possesses a stable and happy state of society “which has benefited mankind to no small extent.” There lies over the book the trial of the auther’s personal equation, his preferences and prepossessions. The idea that this is an evil world, constantly going from bad to worse, is derived from those who believe in the supremacy of the spirit of evil, those who belive in man s 24 THE MAHA-BODHI catastropic fall from a state of perfection, those who are look- ing forwEurd with hope to the millennium for man’s reclama- tion. Mr. Bose who is no lover of Western things un- consciously imbibed that idea which does scant justice to God’s position as an Omnipotent Being and as the loving Father of mankind who professed to have created man for His glory. As a matter of fact the principles of good and ?vil, united in their operation, constantly tend towards man’s betterment. As Bancroft has observed : “Had man been placed in the world perfected there would be no such thing as progress.” Mr. Bose is enamoured of the “good old days,” but Dr Johnson took a different view when he wrote in 1 783 : “I am always angry when 1 hear the ancient times praised at the expense of modem times.” There is in the world a marvellous urge from the worse to the better such as should lead one to the conviction of a natural goodness in man. Humanitarianism as shown by increased kindness to weaker humanity and to lower animals has grown in Christiandom as secular education, resulting from increased intellectual deva- lopment, has progressed and taken the place previously in the complete occupation of Church-administered education. What India really needs has been well stated by Sir Jadu Nath Seirkar : “Give up your dream of isolation, standardise and come into line with the moving world outside or you will become extinct as a race through the operation of relentless economic competition in a world which has now become as one country.” There are serious defects in our social system to be remedied before Swaraj of any kind C8in be attained. The number of useless drones and rotters in India is appaling. Millions go about in the guise of ascetics as Sannyasis and Fakirs — ^useless men for the most part — who sponge on the conamunities. In Hindu and Muslim households of the better class there are thousands of young and able-bodied men who live useless lives as hangers-on of their weaJthy relations. The do-nothing noblesse and the aristrocracy contribute little to the country’s good. The present rulers of India are not WHAT INDIA NEEDS 25 responsible for these evils. Nor can they be blamed for the wrong notions as to the dignity of labour which lead our artisans to abandon their hereditary occupations and which prevent the poverty-striken Bhadraloks from taking to agri- culture and handicrafts. Mr. Bose shows that political Swaraj is an impossibility. He is for cultural Swaraj. The majority of educated Indians would not have it, however, except as a means of attaining political Swaraj. No doubt Mr. Bose means that it will so serve, although he does not clearly explain how. He heis shown that the increase of civilisation is not synonymous with in increase of happiness ; but his idea of going back to the old times needs further elucidation. To unthinking readers the book will act as an opiate but to thinking men it will serve as a stimulant. The book reveals its author as a thinker of rare acumen. Mr. Bose is to be congratulated both on the conception and performance of his task. The formation of a central organisation for the promotion of cultural Swaraj, as recoirmiended by him, deserves the consideration of all educated Indians. If we may be permitted to say so Mr. Bose’s English diction is singularly pleasing. TTie book is fairly well printed and got up. The quotation on page 26 is from Sir John Hewett.

In his presidencial address Pimdit Har Pershad Shastri at the Oriental Conference Lahore in November 1928 said that the Bredimins saved the Hindu ideals when Asoka wanted to level down distinctions of caste and creed and take away all privileges which the Brahmins enjoyed in matter of punish- ment and law suits. According to the learned Pundit the Brahmins by writing metrical Snurities and making Ramayana and Mahabhau-ata and Puranas available to the people saved them from being lured away by Buddhism with its gorgeous ritual and democracy. I cannot say if the learned Pundit’s view is historically correct. As a matter of fact, Smritles, Purans, Ramayana and Mahabharat were available and easily accessible to the to the people when Buddha began his ministry, or Asoka ruled the country. When Buddhism came into the field, its tenets were appreciated with great ardour. History has not yet pronounced its last ‘verdict’ as to the causes of disappearance of Buddhism from the land of its birth. It is however, a fact that it did disappear and that it was followed by Brahmanical revival which meant reversion to old order of things. It is a moot question whether this revival did or did not do good to the country. Let the Pundit rejoice in the idea that Brahmins earned the gratitude of the people and their lost privileges were revived, but it is a fact that Hindu India became an easy prey to the Moslem con- querors. When Moslems invaded India there was a practical revival of Brahminism and Buddhism was in a decadent condi- tion. The question remains, could there have been much chance of success to a foreign invador had India been whole- sale a imited Buddhistic country and not a country divided into PANDIT HARA PERSHAD SHASTRI CRITIUSED 27 hundreds of castes, creeds and cults. Has not democracy been an important factor elsewhere in resisting a foreign in- vasion. Is not India now repenting the re-establishment of caste system which militates against democracy. The present trend of thought is to revive democracy by putting an end to caste ; wise heads of modern days wish to banish it from the country. Are not the Ramayana and Mahabharat now any more than epics? Do the Purans retain the former hold on the Hindu mind ? Does not the Arya Samaj ignore them ? Are not Hindus opening their doors to people of other faiths, if they wish to come into the fold of Hinduism? Are not the untouchables the same despised people as they were on the revival of Brahminism? Is not Suddhi a clear indication that Hindus earnestly desire to raise them from their degraded position. After all, experience is the best Sangatan which means nothing short of levelling all distinctions spirit of other nations, they realise now that there should be Sangatan which meams nothing short of levelling all distinctions of caste. It is high time Hindus put their house in order. The success of Christian nations and the internal unity of the Moslem world ought to be object lessons to them. Political necessity and other exegencies of the time are forcing Hindus, No/ence Valence, to change their modus operandi. A keen observation of their methods reveal a revived of Buddhist methods of unification. The bem. of untouchables, the rigid ceiste system, the dictatorship of Brahmins, stagnation of proselytization, non-reclamation of converts to other faiths, the Puranic modes of worship, of the Hindu pantheon, restrictions on commensality, and in- numerable superstitions pertained to Hinduism for centtnies back. A desire to change or modify the above stated institu- tions is clearly visible among modem Hindus. A reversion to Buddhistic methods cannot be long disguished under cover of reformed Hindu ideals. Why not openly avow the 28 THE MAHA-BODHI capability of Buddhism to accomplish all that is needed to consolidate the Hindu nation. It is to be regretted that the learned President of the Oriental Conference took no account of whither Hindu thought is drifting. CHINESE PILGRIMS 1. Shih Fa Hian. 339 A.D. His original name was Kung. On leaving home he changed the name to Shih or Sakya putra. His elder brothers died, and he was dedicated by his father to the Church — who died when he was ten years old. On his mother’s death he returned to his home from the Monastery, but he rejoined the Monastery. When he was once attacked by robbers, his companion Bhikkhus fled away but he persuaded the robbers by his sermon to leave the food they wanted to rob, untouched. At 20 he was ordained as Bhikkhu. In quest of further information on Buddhist religion he left his country for the motherland of Buddhism. He experienced many difficulties on his way to India. He spent three years in Central India, then sailed to Ceylon, where he got some MSS — then he went Java. His absence from home was for fourteen years. He translated many books with the assistance of an Indian Bhikkhu. He had two perilous voyages, which he described in the account of his travels, rendered great service to China, died at the age of 86. He had left for India 339 A.D. 2. SuNG-YuN. Bom in little Tibet. He was deputed by Empress Dowager of the Wey dynasty with another Bhikkhu to secure works on Buddhistic religion. He travelled so fm as Peshawar, CHINESE PILGRIMS 29 Nagarahara in Northern India and returned home with 1 70 volumes of Mahay ana Buddhistic texts. 3. Hiuen Tsiang or Yung Chwang. 629 A.D. Was born 603 A.D., left home in 629 A.D ., was ordained as Bhikkhu at 20. Reading the accounts of Fa Hain he resolved to make a pilgrimage to India. He met with myriads of dangers on his way to India which he describes in his biography in great detail. He once encountered in the way 50 robbers in one of the forests who divested him of all belongings. He was going to be killed or rather sacri- ficed but his calm attitude moved the robbers who left him.

OBJECTIVITY Mr. Martin Steinke of Berlin, sends the following ; — With the consent of the visitors of the Uposatha-lecture on the 17-11-1929 and the members of the Community around Buddha, and corresponding to their wish we let om readers know the following events : — Oftentimes and edso during the last Uposatha-lecture there were made attempts to disturb the work of the evening and spoil its character through questions concerning the sphere of Christian religion and which have absolutely nothing to do with Buddha’s Teaching. Could every anybody think of mis- taking a Buddhist meeting, which has the purpose of working in the Dhamma, with any other kind of gathering? According to the statutes of the C. a. B., which are known to the questioners, questions about politics and confes- sions are excluded. For all that such questions are always put with quite a special intention. One could overtook this seeming naivete, if the matter had not gone so far as to quit the ground of objectivity. Questions were put to the lecturer of personal offensive character and their real purpose lies not in the seeking for understanding, but in something quite different. Nobody will hope eaurnestly to be able to convert with success people, who out of their judgment hold the Dhamma as right and strive to live after it. It is strange that one speaks of these lectures as an insult to religion, although those lectures are read and appreciated in the whole Buddhist world. But the purpose of such behaviour is quite a different one : about 114 year ago, exactly on August 12th, 1928, the lecturer and several members of the C.a.B. experienced a molestation, which nearly could be called violence, and had the aim of intimidation. (The events were protocolled). After a while THE SECOND AND THIRD NOBLE TRUTHS 33 the threatenings and molestations were continued per tele- phone. (The talk was taken up). As all this had not the desired effect, letters and anonymous post cards were sent, in which expressions as “swindle” and “mean lies” are the politest. After all this remained without success, the personal offences were brought into the Uposatha-lecture evenings. To what rank of culture does one belong, what ethic and religious principles does one represent, if one works with such means against a circle of people, whose only wish is to work in mental objectivity? Does one forget that German Buddhists still are members of human society and citizens of the German empire? (We will comment on this in our next issue. — Editor.) THE SECOND AND THIRD NOBLE TRUTHS By Ven : Bhikkhu D. Pannasara, of Buddhist Mission IN E^jgland. In my last lecture 1 pointed out that the world is suffering. To-day 1 wish to speak about the cause, and the ceasing, of suffering. What is the cause of suffering? The Buddha’s formula of the cause of suffering suns thus : “This, O Bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering’s cause : — It is the craving, which leads to rebirth, joined with pleasure and desire, finding here and there its happiness. This, O Bhikkhus, is the Noble Truth of suffering’s cause.” But why do we say that the desire for pleasure causes suffering? In the Mahadukkakkhandha Sutta the Buddha him- self speaks thus : — “What me the perils that attend the opera- tion of desire? Take the case of a certain young man, who earns his livelihood by being a royal secretary, or accountant, or estate-manager, herd-manager, merchant, archer, captain of troops, and such like. He is exposed to cold and to heat : Oppressed by blazing sun ; plagued with the attacks of flies, mosquitoes and other insects ; is tormented by hunger and 5 34 THE MAHA-BODHI thirst. If this young man, thus putting forth labour and effort, should not attain the duly expected result, then, beside himself with grief and distress, he beats his breast, weeping and lament- ing, saying ‘Vain alas, are all my labours ; fruitless are all my efforts. These are some of the perils that attend the operation of desire. “But suppose that the young man succeeds in his efforts, suppose he does make his fortune then he becomes troubled and anxious about the preservation of his gain, always fearing lest kings or thieves despoil him, lest he be stripped of his wealth by fire or flood, or by heirs whom he detests. If how- ever, despite all his watch and ward, one or other of these calamities befalls him, then he grieves and laments saying ‘What was mine, alas, is no more mine’. These are some of the perils that attend the operation of desire. “Again Bhikkhus, out of desire, impelled by desire, kings contend with kings, nobles with nobles, Brahmins with Brah- mins, householders with householders, mother with son, son with mother, father with son, son with father ; in their quarrels they fall on one another with hands and cudgels, with weapons and knives ; and so come to death or deadly hurt. TTiese are some of the perils that attend the operation of desire. “Again, moved by desire, girding on sword and buckler, taking bows and arrows, men charge in battle, while the arrows and spear hurl through the air, while swords flash and hack. They pierce others with arrow and spear, and they themselves are pierced by these, others with swords and spears ; they cut off one another’s heads, and thus men come by death or are deadly hurt. These are some of the perils that attend the operation of desire. Again impelled by desire, men break agreements, commit robbery and theft, turn into brigands, highwaymen or adulterers. Being arrested, these men are punished by the authorities in various ways. Sometimes their heads are cut off, and such like. These are some of the perils that attend the operation of desire. THE SECOND AND THIRD NOBLE TRUTHS 35 ‘Once more, on account of desire, men go astray in act, word and thought ; and by so doing, after their death they pass to a state of suffering. These are the perils that hereafter attend the operation of desire. In such words, after the manner of expression of His land and time, our great Teacher instructed mankind. With slight alteration of language, the teaching is as applicable to the Western world and to mod«_rn times as when it was first uttered some 25 centuries ago. From this description by the Master himself, we can see that the desire for pleasures causes suffering. Think the matter over for yourself and you will come to imderstand that all suffer- ing is produced by selfish desire. This desire itself leads man to rebirth. How, may be briefly explained thus : When a man is dying, his ignorance covers up and conceals from him the miseries of the world, and so desire inclines his mind towards the world, through his desire he is attached to the world. Assisted by the thoughts which enter the mind during the last moment of the dying man, the mental continuum passes on to the new nuclei that are born as the result of the Kamma that has been predominent. Thus mind leaves the old nucleus and makes its seat in the new nucleus. This is how desire leads man to rebirth. Tlius desire bring suffering to man not only in this life but in numberless lives, always leading him to rebirth. Once the Master spoke thus : “Beset with desire, the mass of man run this way and that like a haunted hare. Bound and fettered by desire, they come to suffering for a long time.” I think it is now sufficiently clear that selfish desire is the cause of all suffering. Then what is the ceasing of suffering? The Buddha’s formula for it runs thus : This, O Bhikkhus, is the noble truth of Suffering’s ceasing, the abolition of this thirst by the destruc- tion of desire, the turning away from desire altogether, com- plete freedom from it, and giving it no room. This, O Bhik- khus, is the noble truth of Suffering’s ceasing.” 36 THE MAHA-BODHl This “truth” declares that as suffering is produced by selfish desire suffering can only be destroyed by giving up that selfish desire. The Master says : “As a tree that has been cut down sprouts forth again, if its roots remain, uninjured and strong, similarly the propensity to desire not being destroyed, this suffering spring up again and again.\" ‘But whoso overcomes this desire, this wretched craving, his sorrows fall from him as the water-drop falls from the Lotus.” Now the occasion arises to say a few words about Nibbana, for in the formula of suffering’s ceasing the Master has des- cribed nothing other than Nibbana. Everyone who believes in any religion whatsoever, 1 think, has a wish to attain ever- lasting happiness of some kind. When we consider, upon what grounds this belief is based, we can discover no reason for holding that the socalled eternal worlds are the final goal of man. We also cannot accept it that these worlds axe eternal. When I say that all compounded things are impermeinent, I know you will agree with me. Since einy place. Heaven, Brahma-world, or any other world whatsoever since any person, God, Brahma or whosoever, he may be, cannot be non-com- posite, they are also impermanent. If all compounded things Eue impermanent, and if Heaven or the Brahma-world is compounded how can we believe that Heaven or Brahma- world is eternal? It ought now to be clear to you that the belief in the eternity of heaven or of the Brahma-world cannot help you. But there must be an end of the individual-man, or strictly speaking, of the combination of these five aggre- gates : namely, body, sensation, perception, mentalities and conciousness. According to the Buddhist point of view that end is called Nibbana. It is the highest state ; one which we hope to attain, by — to begin with — keeping the precepts. Therefore it is worth our while to examine carefully into what we mean by the word Nibbana. To an ordinary man, I mean to a man who has not attained the highest state of the Path, an exact knowledge of Nibbana THE SECOND AND THIRD NOBLE TRUTHS 37 is something of which he is not yet possessed. TTiis belongs solely to those persons who have attained the highest states, because Nibbana appeals to their mind alone. The ordinary man, that is to say, the man who has not destroyed his worldly passions, is only able to guess at what the state of Nibbana is. Tlius, when he has realised that Nibbana is a happy state, he will keep the primary precepts. Afterwards he will boldly tread the Eightfold Path, which leads to Nibbana. Therefore, though we cannot realise Nibbana till we have destroyed all worldly passions when we reflect in accordance with the Buddha’s teaching, we can guess what Nibbana is. You already know how unversed 1 am in your language. So unfortunately I cannot clearly explain to you, even what 1 know of Nibbana. But I will try to tell something of Nibbana, as 1 have under- stood it. But before we go any further, it will be worth our while to consider the actual literal meaning of the word Nibbana. The word Nibbana is a compound of the two words Ni and Vana ; the word Ni being what grammarians call a ‘privative prifix’ and meaning ‘not’ or ‘without’, while Vana means desire. When these two words are united, the resultant com- pound word means the state which is free from desire. TTiis is the meaning of the word Nibbana etymologically according to its derivation. Again we can look at the word Nibbana, and compare it with other expressions used by the Master. When the Buddha expounded the four Noble Truths, by the term Nirodha, that is to say, the cessation of misery, he meant nothing else but Nibbana, whereby misery is made to cease. If we understand that Nibbana is the non-compounded state — if 1 may so express it- — which comes upon the mind of the man who is just on the point of destroying all the evil propensities of his mind, we avoid giving a contradictory meaning to the words Nibbana and Nirodha. But since I fear that even after all these words of mine, you may still be unable to understand what Nibbanna is, 1 will try to make it a bit more clear to you by telling you 38 THE MAHA-BODHI something about the way in which Nibbana is attained. My next lecture, however, will be on the Eightford Path which leads to Nibbana so here 1 give only an outline. TTiere aue two methods of meditation, taught by the Buddha for the attaining of Nibbana by the destruction of selfish desire ; they are called in the Pali language Samatha and Vipassana. Any person, who wishes to attain this high state, must continue for a long time, in the practice of giving charity, keeping the precepts and in meditation. When through this long continued practice, his mind becomes gradually pure, and his merit is quite mature, he will be born in his last birth, with a pure mind. Putting it in other words, 1 would express it as follows : The prim 2 iry mind with which a man is born in that life in which he is going to attain Nibbana, must be pure being un- mixed with selfish desire, hatred or ignorance. TTren, after having this fortunate birth, living either as a layman, or enter- ing the Order in due time, he must keep the precepts laid down by a Buddha. Thus being pure in conduct he must meditate upon the three inherent characteristics of the world namely, that all things in it, are impermanent, bound up with infelicity and devoid of substantial entity, not allowing any other thought to divert his mind. This method of meditation is called Vipas- sana in Pali or in English, Insight. When he thus meditates upon the birth and decay of cill compounded things, his mind will gradually become purer and purer. All worldly passions will cease in his mind. His knowledge of the real condition of compounded things will go on increasing, according as he does this continually. This knowledge is called Vipassana- Nanana in Pali, or in English, Insight knowledge. When this Vipassana-Nanana increases and grows great, he will not desire in the least those things which belong to him as part of his own person. Everything, including his own body, he will regard as mire, as dirt. He will think of the world as a house that is on fire, as a forest infested by cruel beasts of prey ; and so he will have but one wish, — to get away f; m this miserable world. Since he realises that the only way whereby to attain LIBRARY OF THE MAHA BODHI SOCIETY 39 perfection is meditation, he will practice this continually, and at last by the power of the use of it, his mind will become entirely free from passions, and never- again will he think that the five aggregates are good, or that they can confer lasting happiness. The knowledge, which is associated with this con- dition of mind is called in Pali Uttanagamini-Vipassana-Nanana or as it might be rendered in English, up-going insight know- ledge, because it progresses gradually towards perfection. Possessed of this knowledge, when he meditates again upon the three characteristics in due time he will attain the four states respectively of Sotha-Patthi, Sakadagami, Anagami and Arhat, one after the other. When he has attained to the fourth and last that of Arhat there will be no more passions remaining in his mind. (To be continued.) LIBRARY OF THE MAHA BODHI SOCIETY Our Library has been strengthened by a large number of books recently published. The Archaeological section has been enriched by reports of the Archaeological Surveys of the Government of India, Government of Ceylon and the Govern- ment of the Nizam’s Dominions. We also receive Djaya v>'hich deals with the latest activities of the Archaeological Department of the Dutch Government in Java. All the available reports of the Ceylon Archaeological Department from 1890 to 1928, the Ceylon Journal of Science and the Epigraphia Zeylanica kindly sent by the Commissioner of Archaeology will help comparative studies of Archaeology in India and Ceylon. Following books have been added to the Library ; — Altai Himalaya by Roerich (presented). The Pilgrimage of Buddhism by Pratt (presented).

We offer our hearty thanks to all the donors who thus help the Society to maintain its Library with up-to-date books and preriodicals. 16 - 12 - 1929 . Librarian. NOTES AND NEWS Samaneras in Santiniketan. We are happy to leeirn from the Secretary of the Maha Bodhi Society that the Samaneras who have been sent to Santiniketan (Vishvabharati) by the M. B. S. are doing well, and the authorities there are perfectly satisfied with their pro- gress and their ways of life. • ♦ » ‘‘Buddhism in Hawaii.” We have great pleasure in acknowledging receipt of a neatly printed little book under the above name Issued by the English Language Section of the Hongwanji Buddhist Mission NOTES AND NEWS 41 in Honolxdu. It is a companion to the earlier one “Outline of Buddhism which was given a welcome in every Buddhist centre. The new booklet includes many useful Information about historical and religious aspects of the people of the Hawaian islands and the present state and activities of the Buddhist Movement there. The Mission is doing a service to the Americans who are eager to have full information about Buddhism and its mission in the world. We thank the editors for sending it to us. • * * A New Buddhist Annual. We gather from the same Mission that they are preparing to issue a new Buddhist Annua! from this month. TTie Mission thinks that the growing influence of Buddhism in these islands and in America warrants such a publication which will combine and co-ordinate the various groups working under the Buddhist Flag. We wish them all the success. • * * “The American Buddhist.” According to a statement Issued by Mr. Geo. S. Varey, representing the group of American Buddhists in the New York City, they are planning to issue a new journal called “The American Buddhist” and expect to get out the first copy in January, 1930. We welcome our junior contemporary with the greatest pleasure, and hope that it will prove a blessing to the people of the U. S. A. Mr. Varey says : “Already application has been made from Columbia College by some of the fine young specimens of our American manhood to take a course of study in Buddhism here with this Lodge. I am going there myself to tell the others about the Perfect One.” So we find that the hatred of an irritable Roman Catholic Bishop in Hawaii has not in any way harmed the cause of Buddhism. 6 42 THE MAHA-BODHl The Anagarika. It is vith great relief and joy we learn that the Ven. Anagarika Dharmapala is now able to take a drive along the Colombo Sea Beach. Let us hope that he will be able in the near future to visit India and see the completion of the Sarnath Vihara, the sacred object of his desire. ^ ^ 4 : Sarnath Vihara. Elsewhere we publish a statement of accounts showing the total expenditure incurred in connection with the construc- tion work from its very beginning. Readers will also find the total collections up to date at the end of the journal. It will be clear from it that the entire work cannot be finished with the amount in hand. We make a final appeal to the Buddhists and their friends to consider the situation well and render help immediately so that the Vihara may be finished before the beginning of the next rainy season. We might mention that the Park round the Vihara will be laid out soon by the Archaeological Department of India. ^ Baroda Buddha Association. We are glad to announce the formation of a new Buddhist Society under the above name in Baroda as was suggested in a last issue of this journal. We welcome this society in the hope that it will successfully meet the needs of the people of that part of India not yet served by any Buddhist organisa- tion. We are sure that in Dr. Bhattacharya and Mr. Buddha- priya, the secretaries, this institution will find able men who will direct its activities in order to achieve the goal viz. the dissemination of the Buddha Dhamma. We wish the associa- tion all success. BOOK REVIEW THE POEMS.* It is seldom we get poems which are readable and at the same time ennobling. In Dr. H. W. B. Moreno’s ‘The Poems’ we find this rare combination. The nature of the poems range from the reflective to the lighter ones. Those who know the learned author will sure to discover in them the same enthusism and liberal mindedness which characterise Dr. Moreno. The book is well printed, and we are confident that every house will welcome it. BUDDHIST ANNUAL OF CEYLON, 1929. As we have often said this publication has earned a repu- tation of its own. The characteristic feature of this year s issue is that it contains a variety of articles, which, for the depth of their contents, should be read by all earnest Buddhists. We congratulate the learned editors and publishers for the general get up of the Annual. (Copies can be had from the Maha Bodhi Book Agency). THE RELIGION FOR AMERICA. t Yet another little book for Americans. In this book the author gives a critical view of the temperament of the Americans whose civilization was so much influenced by cir- cumstances new to ether countries. Dr, de Soyza examines the psychical growth of the Americans and concludes that the best religion suited to them is Buddhism as it allows freedom * The Poems, by Dr. H. W. B. Moreno.

On the negative side we have a fciir criticism of Christianity, and on the positive side we have the application of Buddhist principles. At the end of the book some beautiful sayings of the Buddha are found. The book is nicely got up and printed by Mr. Kira, the Secretary of the Maha Bodhi Society of America. “Parakrama”.
