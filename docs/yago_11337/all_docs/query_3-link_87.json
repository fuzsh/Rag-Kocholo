Tai languages are spoken in an area that stretches from south-western China and North Vietnam to northeastern India. Thai is by far the largest language within the Tai subgroup. Languages closely related to Thai are Lao, the national language of Laos, and Shan, the language spoken in the Shan state in Burma. From the eighth century, Tai speakers migrated from their homeland in southern China towards the areas now dominated by them in present-day Thailand, Laos and Burma. In Thailand, they replaced the former inhabitants of the area, the Mon and the Khmer, almost completely. Sukhothai, the first Thai nation state, was founded in 1238 AD. The kingdom was conquered in 1376 by the young Thai kingdom of Ayutthaya, which had been founded in 1350. Four hundred years later, in 1767, Ayutthaya fell to the Burmese. From the chaos, the Thai people arose under General Taksin, who subsequently led the country from 1769 until 1782, and founded a new capital: Thonburi. The present Thai kingdom, named ‘Siam’ until 24 June 19391, was founded in 1782 by Chao Phraya Chakri. He moved the capital from Thonburi to Bangkok, on the other side of the Chao Phraya River. As Buddha Yodfa Chulalok, or Rama I, Chao Phraya Chakri became the first king of the Chakri Dynasty, which rules Thailand up to this day. The present King Bhumibol Adulyadet is the ninth Chakri Monarch. Within the Thai language, there exist four main dialects: Central Thai, North-eastern Thai (Isan), Northern Thai (Kham Muang) and Southern Thai (Tâi). The national language of Thailand, and therefore the most prestigious dialect, is Central Thai (phaasăa klaang), which is spoken as a mother tongue in the 26 provinces of the Chao Praya basin, the northernmost part of the Malay peninsula and the northern coast of the Gulf of Thailand. To the east, the area includes the provinces Trat, Chantaburi and Sa Kaew on the Cambodian border, to the north the provinces Prachinburi, Nakhon Nayok, Saraburi, Lopburi, Chai Nat and Suphanburi; to the west the provinces Kanchanaburi and Phetburi, and the southernmost province where Central Thai is spoken is Prachuap Khiri Khan. The national capital, Bangkok, lies right in the middle of this area. Central Thai is taught from the first grade of primary school throughout the country to every Thai child, and thus every Thai who has been to school can speak and understand it. Through this course, you will learn this dominant central dialect of the Thai language. From now on, the language will be called ‘Thai’. Thai is spoken as a first or as a second language2 by around 60 million people, most of whom live in Thailand. Through migration, a large number of Thais live in the United States. In Europe, significant numbers of Thais live in Great Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and France. Lively Thai communities also exist in Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and Japan.\n\n1\n\nThe official name of the country was Siam until 24 June 1939, when it was changed into Thailand; The country was called Siam again in 1945, until the name Thailand eventually became official again on 11 May 1949. 2 If one would consider Isan, Kham Muang and Tâi as separate languages. 99 % of the speakers of these dialects also speaks and understands Central Thai. Within the large Chinese communities in the cities, there is nobody who doesn’t speak Central Thai as a first or a second language. The Mon communities in Kanchanaburi, Ratchaburi, Ayutthaya, Lopburi and Bangkok are mostly Thai monolingual. Around 50,000 of the 120,000 Thai of Mon origin still speak Mon at home (especially the Mon in Bangkok). The Khmer community around Surin, Si Saket and Buri Ram (around a million people) is bilingual.\n\nIX\n\nThai for Beginners This practical Thai course is comprised of 60 lessons divided into three unequal parts. The first part, ‘Thai for Beginners’ is a twelve-lesson elementary introduction to the Thai language. In this first part, you will be offered sufficient learning material to gain a basic knowledge of modern Thai. For beginners, an important part of the learning process is mastering the Thai script. Without being able to read and write, it is simply impossible to learn Thai well. In the first part of the course, emphasis is also given to important grammatical features as sentence construction and the all-important basic vocabulary. After conclusion of ‘Thai for Beginners’, you will be able to communicate with Thai people on a basic level, as well as be able to read and write simple texts in Thai. In the next 36 lessons, ‘Intermediate Thai’, your knowledge will be augmented and improved towards an advanced level. Finally, the intermediate course is followed up by a twelve-lesson course called ‘Thai for Advanced Students’, in which the finesses of the correct usage of spoken and written Thai will be further explained. After completion of the whole course, you will be able to converse fluently in the language and understand it proficiently. You will also be able to read modern Thai texts (novels, newspapers and magazines), and you will be sufficiently equipped to independently further your mastery of the Thai language. Each lesson in the course exists of:  An introduction;  A text, called ‘dialogue’, written in Thai, followed in the course for beginners by a combined transcription and literal word-for-word translation (a word-for-word translation in English is given under each transcribed line of text). In the course for intermediate students a transcription and word-for-word translation is still given in lessons 1-12, but in an appendix at the end of each lesson. Word-for word translations - without transcription are given up to and including lesson 32 for intermediate students. After that, only translations in natural English are given. All dialogues in the course are meant as practical reading exercises, but function in the mean time as listening exercises. To this course belong 13 CDs, recorded with native speakers’ renditions of the dialogues of every lesson;  A Thai-English vocabulary list of all new words appearing in the dialogue. Up to and including lesson 12 for intermediate students, the vocabulary lists are provided with a transcription of each Thai word in phonetic script. The vocabulary lists appear in a spoken version on the CDs belonging with the course;  A translation of the dialogue in natural English;  A theoretical part, consisting of one or more articles on language or culture. Articles on language are on script and writing, grammar, idiom and vocabulary. These ‘linguistic’ articles are supplemented with short essays on Thai society, customs and culture;  Tone exercises: In lessons 4 through 6 for beginners exercises are given to familiarize you with the five tones of the Thai language;  Exercises, consisting of translation exercises, fill-in exercises or questions. For part of the exercises a key is given. The rest of the exercises is meant to be corrected by a teacher in a classroom situation or as homework given;  The key to part of the exercises. 1. Introduction The introduction offers some short background information about the events about to take place in the dialogue. When the dialogue is a sequel of the previous lesson’s dialogue, a summary of prior events is given. The introduction also mentions which grammar and culture articles the lesson includes, and it prepares you for changes in format of a new series of lessons.\n\nX\n\nThai for Beginners 2. Dialogue 2.1. Form of the dialogue In lessons 4 for beginners up to and including lesson 30 for intermediate students, the text part of each lesson consists of dialogue, introduced and connected by paragraphs in prose. These dialogues and connecting texts are written in Thai script. In the first 23 lessons of which a dialogue is a part, a concession is done to the beginning student: In Thai, traditionally no space is used between words; all words in a sentence are written in an uninterrupted sequence of characters. Only between clauses and sentences is a ligature () found. This ligature often appears approximately at the same points in a text where writers of the Latin script would place a period, colon, semicolon or comma, but beware - not always and exactly. In view of the training you must undergo in word pattern recognition, the words will be written separated by a space in all dialogues of the lessons up to and including lesson 12 for intermediate students. From lesson 13 for intermediate students on, the sentences in the dialogues will be written long and without spaces, as is usual in a Thai written text. In the beginning of the course, emphasis is laid on actual dialogue: conversation between people. A large part of the texts in the dialogue are, therefore, written in dialogue format: Name of the character that speaks:\n\nSpoken words without quotation marks.\n\nAs the course - and you along with it - develops, descriptive parts in prose will become of increasing importance within the dialogue. They will eventually substitute all text in dialogue format after lesson 31 for intermediate students. After this point, conversation will still be an important element in the lessons, but will be written between quotation marks, as in a novel. Finally, in the last few chapters of the course for advanced students, some media articles have been reproduced as reading exercises. The text of these articles is not available on CD, and has to be considered as a preparation on further reading outside the framework of the course. In the articles, the Thai variant of short descriptive reportage style is offered against the general language of the dialogue format and the narrative style in the later lessons. The texts meant for reading and listening at the beginning of each lesson are indicated with the nominative ‘dialogue’ during the entire course; whether they are indeed mainly in dialogue format, or whether they are in fact prose texts with dialogue between quotation marks. On the CDs, real dialogue as well as prose with dialogue within quotation marks is presented as a radio play: the narrative texts and the voices of the characters are read and acted by different voice actors.\n\n2.2. Transcription and translation Transcription method: The transcription of the Thai script in this course is loosely based on existing methods, (notably IPA – International Phonetic Alphabet, and the Mary Haas transcription) but has been adapted to the needs of the non-linguistically schooled speaker of English. Some signs in the transcription script will require a short period of habituation, such as the sign ‘c’, which is used as the transcription of the sound of the Thai letter ‘’; a voiceless unaspirated alveolo-palatal affricate. The IPA symbol for it is: , and it is a sound similar to the sound one would get if one would pronounce the ‘ch’ in ‘change’, but without the aspiration (the puff of air that follows the sound), which in English is always inherent to the ‘ch’sound. The Thai language also knows this aspirated variant of this phoneme (the voiceless aspirated alveolo-palatal affricate; noted in IPA as ), which is in fact so similar to the ‘ch’ in ‘change’ that an English speaker could use this English ‘ch’ to pronounce the Thai characters for the sound , which are written ‘’, ‘’ and ‘’. In our transcription system, ‘ch’ is\n\nXI\n\nThai for Beginners therefore maintained as transcription of all Thai -sounds. Equally, for the transcription of the close back unrounded vowel  (IPA) - which doesn’t exist in English or any other Western European language, but which in Thai has a short and a long variant (written ‘’ and ‘’ respectively) - the easy to remember symbols ‘ue’ (short) and ‘ue’ (long) have been chosen. The mid central rounded vowel ə (IPA), which occurs in French in words like ‘je’ and ‘ce’, and in Thai in words like ‘’ (short) and ‘’ (long) is transcribed as ‘eu’ (short) and ‘eu’ (long). Thai vowels with equivalents in English are, for instance : ‘e’ (as in ‘lane’, ‘main’, ‘may’), which in the transcription appear in transcription as ‘e’ (short; Thai: ; ) and ‘ee’ (long; Thai: ), and for IPA ‘’ (as in ‘met’, ‘cat’. Short; Thai: ; ), and ‘’ (as in ‘man’, ‘dad’. Long; Thai: ), IPA transcription is maintained; these phonemes are thus transcribed as ‘’ (short) as ‘’ (long). In the transcription, the five tones of Thai are indicated with diacritics: The accent égue (ó) indicates the high tone, the accent grave (ò) the low tone, the accent circonflexe (ô) the falling tone, and the ‘háček’ or ‘caron’ (ǒ) the rising tone. The mid tone doesn’t get any diacritic (o). With this simple but effective transcription system, which is explained completely in lesson 1, care has been taken that while learning the Thai alphabet during the initial stage of your study, you are not also overwhelmed with too many unknown characters from, for example, the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA). The transcription system used in the course is fast and easy to learn with a minimal effort. ... And don’t forget: once the Thai alphabet has been completely mastered, the transcription script should immediately be discarded. Transcription and word-for-word translation: In lessons 4 through 12 for beginners, the transcription of the dialogues is given directly under the Thai dialogues. Under every transcribed line, a literal translation of each transcribed word is given in a one-to-one or word-for-word translation. The transcription is meant to provide the beginning student with an immediate hold on the pronunciation of the matter which is read or listened to. In the mean time, the word-for-word translation under the transcription shows the meaning of each separate word or morpheme, and offers you an insight in how the Thai sentence is constructed. In lessons 1 through 12 for intermediate students, a combined transcription and word-for-word translation of the dialogue has been added to each lesson as an appendix. A word-for-word translation (without the by then redundant transcription) still follows each dialogue up to and including lesson 32 for intermediate students. From lesson 33 for intermediate students at the latest, you are supposed to understand Thai well enough to be able to follow each lesson without the help of a word-for-word translation. Translation: Until the end of the course, a translation in natural English is given of each dialogue. This translation tries to stay as close as possible to the contents and atmosphere of the original Thai text. Because of the completely different character of source- and target language, it will sometimes be impossible to transfer all finesses of the Thai language into English. In some instances, footnotes are used to explicate sayings or puns, or to clarify a cultural reference. 2.3. Content of the dialogue The course is meant to make it as pleasant as possible for you to learn the Thai language. The dialogues in each lesson are therefore arranged as a collection of short stories and novellas. The adventures of a small number of main characters are used as a framework to offer you an instructive and, in the meantime, as attractive as possible tour around the Thai language. Main protagonists in the course are:\n\nXII\n\nThai for Beginners \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘Joy’ Jintana Chakraphet is a student of English and French at Chulalongkorn University. She is intelligent, curious, adventurous and pretty. Joy comes from a wealthy and socially respected family. Her father is a pilot with Thai Airways, her mother a TV-personality. Joy’s parents are acquainted with many persons of high standing. In lesson 10 for intermediate students, Joy becomes a fashion model, and this work brings her into contact with several secondary characters. Joy has an older brother named Sua. Nikki Wolf is also a student at Chulalongkorn University. She has a Dutch father (a successful expatriate) and a Thai mother. Nikki likes to shop and to go out. Her character is more traditional than Joy’s, but Nikki loves to follow her friend in all kinds of adventures. At the beginning of the course for intermediate students, she starts to date Joy’s brother Sua. Maew is from North-eastern Thailand. She is a student at Ramkhamhaeng University. Her father is a Colonel of Police in Bangkok. She has a brother, Krit, who is friends with Joy’s brother Sua and with Vincent (see below). Maew has a quieter and more subdued character than her friends, but she takes them to places where the two Bangkokian girls might not go on their own. During the intermediate course, she starts dating Vincent. ‘Sua’ Surasak Chakraphet is Joy’s elder brother. He is a recent naval engineering graduate. He takes his sister and her friends often out on trips in Bangkok and on short holidays. He really likes to do this, because he has designs upon Joy’s friend Nikki. From lesson 7 of the intermediate course on, Sua and Nikki are a couple. Vincent Wolf is Nikki’s cousin, a Dutchman. Sua and Maew’s brother Krit often take him out to bars and night spots in Bangkok. He also often functions as a chaperone and driver for Joy, Nikki and Maew when they go on holiday. Vincent is an interested observer who speaks Thai fluently already. Eventually he moves into a relationship with Maew, and marries her.\n\nThe Thai main protagonists have been designed as modern young Bangkokians: intelligent, well educated, curious, eager to travel and explore, and born in the educated classes of the population. The foreigner, Vincent, functions now and then as an inquirer on one or the other thing, but his Thai is more than fluent (on the CD’s, Vincent’s voice is provided by a native speaker of Thai). These five characters appear in a large number of different situations, and go through a couple of interesting, sometimes exciting adventures during the course. On the one hand, the stories in the dialogues describe regular situations and places in which, sooner or later, you will certainly find yourself as well. On the other hand, the adventures of the protagonists are used to introduce you to themes like politics and social problems, and to literary styles such as the ghost story and the crime story; both very popular in Thailand. Also, certain historical events will be introduced within the dialogues. Other characters that play a role in more than one lesson are Joy’s parents, Nikki’s father, Maew’s brother Krit, fashion photographer Wasan Charupakorn, Maew’s uncle Wirote, former child-prostitute Jiap, Chintamani, the ghost of a Princess from Ayutthaya, Police Colonel Samrueng Dechakrachang, gunman for hire Manas Chatuwong and former communist rebel Wirachai Na Pomphet. 3. Vocabulary list All lessons – except lesson 1, which doesn’t contain any dialogue or reading texts – include one or more vocabulary lists. With each dialogue belongs a main vocabulary list, which follows behind the Thai dialogue and auxiliary translations (transcriptions and word-for-word translations), and precedes the English translation of the dialogue. New words from the dialogue are arranged in order of appearance in the text. Up to lesson 12 for intermediate students, every Thai word is accompanied by a transcription. From lesson 13 for intermediate students on, transcriptions are only given of words with an irregular or ambiguous spelling, and words which contain exceptions on the tone rules.\n\nXIII\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n4. Learning how to read and write The first lesson of the course consists of an outline of the Thai alphabet. The consonants and vowels are given, as are the consonant classes and tone markers, and the tone rules are explained. Punctuation marks and diacritics are introduced and the transcription method is explained. Lesson 1 contains all basic information on language and script, and should be used as reference material while studying the following lessons. In lessons 2 through 6, a small but useful vocabulary is built up, and the very basics of Thai grammar are explained. The correct pronunciation of the tones will be practiced through tone exercises. In lessons 7 through 11 for beginners, you will be made thoroughly acquainted with the alphabet and with the way the Thai write their language. The alphabet is discussed as follows: In lesson 7: The consonants , , , , , , , , , ,  and ; In lesson 8: The consonants , , . , , , , ,  and ; In lesson 9: The consonants , , , , , , , ,  and ; In lesson 10: The consonants , , , , , , , , ,  and ; In lesson 11: The vowels In lesson 12 for beginners, the theory of the consonant classes and the tone rules are repeated intensively, and the most common spelling anomalies are given. Eventually, by means of a list of 32 sample words, in which all consonants, vowels, consonant classes, tone rules, tone markers, diacritics and a choice of anomaly spellings are represented, it is clarified in detail how the combination of characters, diacritics and rules are used to represent the spoken word in written text. It is not so that you will be effortlessly able to read any Thai text after having studied the first 12 lessons of the course. First of all, you will not yet be able to recognize Thai letters in a blink of the eye, as you are used to with Latin characters. And secondly, even if you were, your vocabulary is still not large enough to immediately recognize a word – or at least the beginning and the end of it – in a Thai text. The start has been made, though, and through the exercise which is offered in an increasing degree of difficulty during the next part of the course, you will quickly make progress. After having progressed to lesson 11 or 12 of the intermediate course, you will be able to read the Thai texts (still printed with spaces between words) without much difficulty. Four or five lessons further, the natural way of Thai writing (without spaces) won’t be too difficult any more. 5. Grammar As every language, Thai uses a system of rules and principles that defines the structure of words, phrases and sentences. In the articles on grammar in this course, this system is clearly and concisely described, and explained with plenty of grammatical model sentences and examples. In offering the learning material on grammar, thought has been given to what you will likely need most urgently to make yourself understood in your new language. On the other hand, attention is given to the grammatical oddities which make Thai so different from an IndoEuropean language as English. It is necessary to emphasize those differences at an early stage, so that you will learn to use those structures correctly from the beginning, and later reproduce them as an automatism. The earlier you will learn the differences between your mother tongue and Thai, the better you will later be able to use the language fluently and correctly.\n\nXIV\n\nThai for Beginners With this set-up, you are made acquainted with the basic grammatical rules of the language at an early stage- a knowledge that will enable you to speak grammatically correct Thai at a grass-roots level in a relatively short time. In the meantime, you will not be spared any matter which might initially cause you to recoil, but in which a timely immersion will mean a great profit to you later. Initial grammatical subjects include sentence structure, the use of nouns, adjectives and verbs (under which all possible translations of the verb ‘to be’). Also, attention is given to grammatical and idiomatical phenomena in Thai, which are almost or completely unknown in English, such as classifiers, the rich choice in (polite, neutral and familiar) personal pronouns, and the remarkable use of the words ‘’ - ‘to go’ and ‘’ - ‘to come’ as direction markers in Thai. From lesson 1 for intermediate students on, when you are sufficiently intimate with the script, tones and basic grammar of your new language, all other grammatical features of the Thai language will be explained. The language in which the grammar articles are written is kept as clear and simple as possible. Linguistic vernacular outside the simplest grammatical terminology is explained. In all cases where examples can illustrate an issue more clearly, models or frames are given. Sample sentences further explain the matter. In many cases, the grammar article in a lesson will conclude an aspect of Thai grammar, but sometimes a grammatical subject is spread over two or more lessons. Related subjects are covered in consecutive lessons. Some subjects discussed on a basic level in the first twelve lessons will be repeated and expanded in the intermediate section of the course. Some examples are:  \n\n\n\nIn lesson 1 for intermediate students, the character and use of adjectives in Thai is explained. In lesson 2, the matter is expanded in an article on composite adjectives. Finally, in lessons 3 and 4 the comparison is covered. In lesson 5 for beginners, you’ll be made acquainted with the existence and the use of classifiers. Subsequently, you’ll learn more classifiers ‘along the way’ by continuing reading the dialogues. Finally, in lesson 10 for intermediate students, attention is again directed towards the subject, and a list is given of the most frequently used classifiers. In lesson 11 for beginners, the imperative mode and its negative are discussed. In lesson 17 for intermediate students, the subject of the negative imperative is expanded. Finally, in lesson 27 for intermediate students, a list of example sentences is given with imperatives and incentives in several gradations of urgency and politeness.\n\nThrough gradual expansion of the learning matter, it is avoided that you are forced to learn everything about a subject at once. Besides, by repetition and expansion of important or difficult subjects, you will understand and remember the matter better than when you learn it in just one go. 6. Idioms The idiom of a language consists of phrases of figurative meaning and figures of speech. Sayings and proverbs also belong to these categories. Often, idioms have an anomalous grammatical form. The adage goes that only if one has mastered the difficult translatable idioms of a language, one may call oneself a fluent speaker of it. As an idiom-rich language, this goes maybe even more for Thai than for other languages. In English, sayings and proverbs are often ‘fossilized’, and sound somewhat old fashioned and banal. In Thai, there also exist such truisms, but most sayings are adaptable. In popular language, maxims are often adapted according to the circumstance in which one wants to use\n\nXV\n\nThai for Beginners them. People don’t only use them in their fixed forms, but vary them, and play word games with the adages, which then often convey very subtle messages. It is in your best interest to get acquainted with the basic forms of sayings and proverbs, on which all the variants they’ll hear are based. Due to the short words of the language, the idioms sound snappy and vivacious. Alliteration, reduplication, internal rhyme and metre are also often used to make an idiom sound even better. Articles on idioms are found spread throughout the course, but the pith of the matter can be found in lessons 33 through 36 (for intermediate) and 1 through 12 for advanced students. Next to the development of reading and writing Thai on an advanced level, a lot of attention is given to the study of Thai idioms in those lessons. 7. Cultural information While a language course might not be the ideal place to educate students in culture and customs of a country or people, language is not complete without a basic knowledge of the culture of the area where the language is spoken. In the course, a few of the most conspicuous traits of the Thai people, the Thai state and Thai society are described and explained. It must be pointed out emphatically that none of the many festivals or ceremonies that make the country famous is discussed, nor are cultural expressions as visual art, music or literature. Notes are made on cultural phenomena that cannot be helped being observed on a daily basis, that might interest people or leave them in wonder. Therefore, an article on Thai nicknames can be found in this course, and another about nobility in Thailand. There is a piece about the places where young Thai people like to go on holiday, another article is about non-lingual interaction and the traditional Thai greeting, the ‘’ (). Also, cultural background information is given in the explanation of not directly translatable concepts, such as in a cultural note on the different kinds of ghosts and supernatural beings one can find in Thailand. The further you advance in the course, the better your Thai will become, and the less reason there will be to explain Thai culture in English. The explanatory function is gradually taken over by the dialogues themselves, in which phenomena are explained in plain Thai. For instance, in the dialogues of the last chapters of the course the preparations for a Thai wedding are described, while the dialogues of lessons 1 through 6 for advanced students of the course takes place against the background of the student revolution of October 1973. 8. Tone exercises After a brief introduction to basic grammar and script, in the lessons 4 through 6 for beginners you will learn the five tones of Thai by examples and exercises. Tones are sometimes unknown to – and often underestimated by – the foreign student of Thai. As phonemes though, tones are just as important for the definition of the meaning of a word as consonants, vowels and diphthongs. The tone exercises are printed in the lessons in transcription script, and are to be found in spoken form on the appropriate CD. It is of great importance to be able to pronounce and hear the tones correctly as mid (level), low, rising, falling or high. After the special tone exercises in the lessons 4 through 6, your ear will be continuously trained in the appreciation of tones by listening to and repeating the dialogues and vocabulary lists of every lesson on the CDs. 9. Writing exercises and tests Exercises in the course - which can also be used as tests - are of two kinds. In each lesson there is a section in the exercises on which the answers are given. These exercises are mainly designed for those of you who study the course independently. Answers to the second part of the exercises are not given in the course. These exercises are primarily designed for students\n\nXVI\n\nThai for Beginners who study the course with a mentor or teacher. Exercises of the second kind take a little more effort to complete; they also often ask you to formulate your personal opinion. Exercises in creative writing are frequently part of the tests from lesson 1 for intermediate students on. From the beginning of the course, you will be forced to use Thai. Initially, you will still be allowed to use the transcription script in answering questions and filling in exercises (before you have learned the whole alphabet through the several stages offered in the beginner’s course), but in lesson 11 for beginners, you are asked for the first time to provide a translation of a number of sentences written in Thai script, while in lesson 12 for beginners, the answers on the exercises have to be given in both Thai and transcription script. From lesson 1 for intermediate students on, the answers on all exercises must be given exclusively in Thai script. In the part of the exercises on which the answers are not given, you will be forced to translate from English into Thai, or at a later stage, to think directly in Thai. The formulation of the exercises is therefore put in English, in order to keep you from the temptation of copying Thai words from the questions into your answers. Apart from supplying the right answer to the question, you also have to think about your right use of grammar and vocabulary. An extra, excellent exercise is formed through letting you search for words you don’t know in the lessons, the vocabulary lists or in your dictionary. In the exercises and tests not only the vocabulary and grammar given in the lesson concerned are rehearsed and tested. For most exercises, you’ll have to reach back for information given in earlier lessons as well. In order to be able to answer each lesson’s questions in good Thai sentences, you must always be on top of all grammar and vocabulary already explained. Obviously, also in the creative writing exercises your written language skills are tested on all levels. 11. Vocabulary lists and appendices Two extensive vocabulary lists have been compiled for this course. The first is a list which contains all words used in the first 24 lessons of the course: lessons 1 through 12 for beginners; and lessons 1 through 12 for intermediate students. Every Thai word in this vocabulary is provided with a transcription and a comprehensive translation into English. The main vocabulary list follows at the end of the course for advanced students. The Thai words in this list have not been transcribed. In both vocabularies, the number of the lesson in which each respective word appears for the first time is given in square brackets behind the entry. Appendices are on the following subjects: Appendix 1: The alphabet, the tone rules and the consonant classes. Appendix 2: The ‘alphabet song’ Appendix 3: Classifiers Appendix 4: List of common abbreviations 12.

Thai is not an Indo-European language. It does not resemble English. Thai has taken some loan-words from Chinese, some from Malay, and another few hundred from Pali, Sanskrit, and Khmer. Even if you have made a thorough study of those languages, it won’t help you with recognizing their meaning in Thai. In the course of your study of the language, you’ll discover a significant number of loan-words from English, but initially, you’ll be thoroughly swamped with information which you’re badly going to need in learning to manage the language, but which you might not consider useful at first sight. The experience of every foreigner who has taken on this effort is: that after a short period of intensive study of a lot of theory, a stage will follow in which one will have become able to express oneself in Thai in a satisfying, adult way, without having to fall back into ‘tourist-Thai’ – that is: without picking up wrong habits which are difficult to get rid of later. After this second stage, during which one makes oneself familiar with the language up to a level of semi-fluency (through practical conversation and reading children’s books and other simple texts), another phase of learning usually follows, in which one deepens one’s knowledge of the language by reading newspapers and magazines, watching films and television programs, and having profound conversations with Thai friends. After that, a specialization in a scientific, religious or philosophical field might be something just for you. This 12-lesson beginner’s course has been written with the intention to lead you through the first stages of learning the Thai language.\n\nThe contents of this first lesson are offered for your review. The subject matter, which will probably seem rather intricate to a beginning student when browsing through this lesson, is not meant to learn by heart immediately at this stage, nor will you be expected to be able to apply everything of it actively and immediately. Gradually, the contents of the first lesson will be repeated, rehearsed and expanded over the next eleven lessons. This lesson is intended as an extensive introduction to the Thai language and the Thai writing system, and functions, next to the appendices, as fundamental back-up material that you may find convenient to use as a reminder during the course of your study.\n\n3\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n1.2\n\nThe Thai Language\n\nThai is a member of the Tai-Kadai family of languages. Thai is spoken in Thailand, where it is the national language. Lao, the national language of the Laotian People’s Republic, is closely related to Thai. In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the People’s Republic of China, the northern Tai language Zhuang is spoken. Furthermore, a large ethnic group in Burma, the Shan, speaks a Tai language. Tai languages are also spoken in Northeastern India, Northern Vietnam, and Cambodia, where smaller groups use languages related to Thai as their mother tongue. Different linguists maintain different theories about the origin of Thai and the relationship of Thai with other languages. But there is historical evidence which points to the fact that the Thai people, and with them their language, originate from southern China, from where they were driven south beginning in the ninth century C.E. (A.D.); first by the Han-Chinese, and later by the Mongols. In the area that stretches from contemporary Laos, North and Northeast Thailand, and the Shan State in Burma, Thai centers developed, which were reigned by warlords. Those sovereigns ruled over areas peopled with Thai, as well as Khmer, Mon and other ethnic groups. The first founding of a genuine Thai nation state took place in the eleventh century, culminating in the first great Thai kingdom, Sukhothai, with King Ramkhamhaeng the Great as its most influential ruler. The oldest still existing inscription in the Thai language is from that period. The Kingdom of Ayutthaya took over the function of Sukhothai as seat of a ruler who exacted tribute in exchange for protection in the late middle Ages. After feuding with the Burmese for hundreds of years, in 1767 Ayutthaya lost a decisive battle and was burnt to the ground. The Burmese didn’t only demolish palaces and temples, but also all libraries in the area. From Thai as it was written before 1767, only stone inscriptions remain. The Burmese didn’t stay, though. A general called Taksin pushed them back. Taksin built his capital in Thonburi, and was king for a while, but the first ruler of the Chakri Dynasty, the still ruling lineage of Kings, soon followed. The site of the capital city was moved to Bangkok on the other side of the Chao Phraya River. In 1782, Bangkok became the new capital of a new Thai state called Rattanakosin, after the ruling dynasty. Foreigners had used the name ‘Siam’ for the Thai Kingdom of Ayutthaya for a long time, and it stuck during the first few decades of the Rattanakosin Dynasty as ‘Sàyǎam’. Thai used this name with foreigners from the 1850s onwards to identify themselves and their country. The name ‘Siam’ appeared on banknotes and stamps and in international correspondence. In 1939, the name of the country was officially changed to ‘Thailand’. Sources of written Thai (Siamese) are numerous since the founding of Bangkok. Although a modern, reasonably educated Thai would have great difficulties reading inscriptions from the time of King Ramkhamhaeng, he would be able to read the language after the founding of Thonburi, just as easily as we would read an original edition of a novel by Swift or Defoe. Just as in English, nothing substantial has changed in the Thai language during the last two hundred and some years. Thai is a tonal language and can be typified as an isolating language, just like most other tonal languages, such as Mandarin and Burmese. The language shows some fusional traits through loan morphemes and loan constructions from, for instance, Pali and Khmer. Modern Thai is written in a syllabic letter script, just like Sanskrit (Devanagari script), and Khmer. The first forms of Thai writing were based on italic Khmer, or handwritten Khmer, which in its turn has been developed from Indian scripts. The Thai script is ultimately, via the just mentioned italic Khmer, and just like the Burmese and Mon scripts, most directly based on the Pali-script. 4\n\nThai for Beginners\n\nFrom the shape of some of the Thai letters, one can still see their distant relationship with their Devanagari cousins.\n\n1.3\n\nThe Thai alphabet\n\nThe Thai alphabet consists of a set of 44 consonants ( -) and a set of 32 vowels (-), including diphthongs ( - ) and triphtongs ( - ), which are formed with 18 different characters. This number includes four of the consonant character signs ( -  ,  -  ,  -   and  -  ), which are used either independently, or in combination with other characters as vowel-, diphthong- or triphthong signs. Apart from this, a few characters indicate a consonant sound in combination with a vowel sound (- (m),  ri, reu or rue,  (rue),  (lue) and  (lue)). You will see that some characters are used often in Thai written texts, others less frequently, and some hardly ever. There are even two consonants ( -   and  -  ), which are never used anymore, but are still officially part of the Thai alphabet. Only in handwritten texts from before circa 1870 these two letters still occur.\n\ncd 1a track 1\n\n1.3.1\n\nThe 44 consonants\n\nAll 44 consonants have a name. When orally spelling a word, that name is mentioned after each consonant occurring in the relevant word. This might remind one of the corny English primary school writing primers in which A stands for Apple, et cetera, but is rather more comparable with the sign code which is used in air traffic control towers and in the military, in order to avoid misunderstandings and accidents. Some consonants are very similar in sound and usage, and can be easily confused when not pronounced together with their names. In the first vertical column you will find the Thai consonant, then next to it by the same consonant together with the noun after which it is named. In most cases, the name of the consonant starts with the relevant consonant, but there are also consonants which are only found back somewhere in the middle of the noun after which they are named. In the following column, you will find the transcription of the sound of the consonant as it is pronounced at the beginning of a syllable (standard pronunciation), with (in parentheses) the transcription of the name of the consonant. In the next column you will find the pronunciation of the consonant at the end of a syllable (end pronunciation). The apostrophe (’) behind a so-called ‘stop’ (‘k’, ‘p’ or ‘t’ sound) indicates that the sound is ‘unreleased’. This means that the consonant is formed in the mouth at the normal point of articulation, but not ‘released’ with a puff of air. If you want to get an idea about how these unreleased stops sound, you may keep in mind how the first ‘t’ in the word ‘otter’ sounds, or the first ‘p’ in ‘upper’, or the first ‘c’ in ‘soccer’. The apostrophe behind stops will, by the way, not be used in the rest of the course after unreleased stops at the end of syllables. The unreleased pronunciation of stops in those places is a rule on which there are no exceptions. The unwritten stop, known as ‘glottal stop’ at the end of a syllable sounds as the sound, sometimes transcribed by ’ in phonetically written Cockney, in words such as ‘it’ (i’), ‘traffic’ (traffi’) and matter (ma’er). It is transcribed as . 5\n\nThai for Beginners In the last vertical column, the class to which the different consonants belong is indicated with the letter L for the Low Class, The letter M for the Middle Class, and the letter H for the High Class consonants. The class of a consonant is essential to the written representation of tones in the Thai language.\n\nThe Thai Consonants: Letter and Name Transcription\n\n6\n\nMeaning Name\n\nPronunciation Begin Syllable End Syllable Class\n\n\n\n - \n\n ( - )\n\nchicken\n\nk\n\nk’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n ( - )\n\negg\n\nkh\n\nk’\n\nH\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nbottle\n\n(obsolete)\n\n\n\n -   - \n\nwater buffalo\n\nkh\n\nk’\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nperson\n\n(obsolete)\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ntemple-bell\n\nkh\n\nk’\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nsnake\n\nng\n\nng\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nplate\n\nc\n\nt’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ncymbal\n\nch\n\nt’\n\nH\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nelephant\n\nch\n\nt’\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nchain\n\ns\n\nt’; s 1\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ntree\n\nch\n\nt’\n\nL\n\n\n\n -   - \n\nwoman\n\nj\n\nn\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ndancer’s crown\n\nd\n\nt’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ngoad\n\nt\n\nt’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\npedestal\n\nth\n\nt’\n\nH\n\n\n\n -   - \n\nname of a\n\nth, some-\n\nt’\n\nas th: L\n\ngiantess\n\ntimes d\n\nt’\n\nas d: M\n\nold man\n\nth\n\nt’\n\nL\n\nnovice\n\nn\n\nn\n\nL\n\n\n\n -   - \n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nThai for Beginners\n\nLetter and Name Transcription\n\nMeaning Name\n\nPronunciation Begin Syllable End Syllable Class\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nchild\n\nd\n\nt’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nturtle\n\nt\n\nt’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nbag\n\nth\n\nt’\n\nH\n\n\n\n -   - \n\nsoldier\n\nth\n\nt’\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nflag\n\nth\n\nt’\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nmouse\n\nn\n\nn\n\nL\n\n\n\n -   - \n\nleaf\n\nb\n\np’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nfish\n\np\n\np’\n\nM\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nbee\n\nph\n\np’\n\nH\n\n\n\n - \n\n- \n\nlid, cover \n\nf\n\n—\n\nH\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ntray\n\nph\n\np’\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ntooth\n\nf\n\np’, f 1\n\nL\n\n\n\n -   - \n\njunk ship\n\nph\n\np’\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nhorse\n\nm\n\nm\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ngiant\n\nj\n\nj\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nship\n\nr\n\nn\n\nL\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nmonkey\n\nl\n\nn\n\nL\n\n\n\n -   - \n\nring\n\nw\n\nw\n\nL\n\n\n\n -   - \n\npavilion\n\ns\n\nt’\n\nH\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nhermit\n\ns\n\nt’\n\nH\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\ntiger\n\ns\n\nt’\n\nH\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nchest, trunk\n\nh,\n\n—3\n\nAlso: class-modifier\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nkite\n\nl\n\nn\n\nH\n\n2\n\nL\n\n7\n\nThai for Beginners\n\nLetter and Name Transcription\n\n\n\n - \n\n - \n\nMeaning Name\n\nPronunciation Begin Syllable End Syllable Class\n\nbasin, bowl, tub\n\noo, o, a; class-modifier vowel-bearer 4\n\n\n\n -   - \n\nowl\n\nh\n\no, oo\n\nM\n\n—\n\nL\n\n2\n\nNotes on the consonants: ¹\n\n-\n\n2\n\n-\n\n³\n\n-\n\n4\n\n-\n\nFor loanwords from English, many speakers pronounce these letters at the end of a word as in English; so as ‘s’ and ‘f’. The Consonant Class Modifiers;  or , when placed before a Low Class consonant, modify the original consonant into a High Class (in the case of ), or into a Middle Class (in the case of ) consonant. In many cases, this is important for the notation of the tone of a syllable. The letter  is a Class Modifier in only four words:  - jàa ‘don’t’,  - jàak - ‘to want’,  - ‘thing’, and - ‘to stay’, ‘to live’. The letter  is used considerably more often as a Class Modifier. On the end of a syllable,  is only used in combination with the mark ‘kn’ ( ). A krn is a sign above a last consonant of a word, which signifies that this marked consonant is not pronounced (see 1.5.; Punctuation Marks). When seen alone, a written  is pronounced as ‘oo’, ‘o’ or ‘a’.  also acts as the ‘bearer’ of other vowels. It takes the vowel sound of the vowel that accompanies it.  can only be the ‘bearer’ of the vowel, when the vowel is in the initial position in a syllable. In the vowel-list in 1.3.2., you will see  act as a bearer of every vowel which is described in the lesson. For writing a single vowel-, diphthong- or triphthong-sound, use must be made of the vowel-bearer .\n\nObservations: \n\n(joo jk) and  (woo wn) are, just as in English ‘y’ and ‘w’, so-called semivowels. They can be found at the end of a syllable, but in such cases they usually form a diphthong or triphthong together with other vowels. Between two consonants, the pronunciation of  becomes a diphthong, ‘ua’, like for instance in the word ‘’ (). At the end of a sylla\n\nble,  is pronounced as ‘w’, as in the word ‘low’. For instance:  -  - ‘cat’. At the end of a syllable,  is pronounced as ‘y’, as in the English ‘boy’. For instance:  -  ‘to sell’.  You will probably have noticed that some of the above consonants do not exist in the same way as they do in English. The notion that a sound ‘ng’ at the beginning of a syllable can exist, is for some people quite confusing and therefore a sound which they find hard to reproduce. To pronounce the sound, you could start with saying ‘banger’ (as the popular British sausage), but leave out the ‘ba’-part of the word. Replace the final ‘r’ with an ‘n’, and you’ll pronounce ‘ngen’ (), which means ‘money’ or ‘silver’ in Thai.  In English, we know the aspirated consonants ‘ch’ (as in ‘church’), ‘k’ (as in ‘kettle’, ‘cat’), ‘p’ (as in ‘pet’) and ‘t’ (as in ‘talk’). We find the non-aspirated varieties of those consonants back in other languages: Such as in the Malay word ‘cuci’ (non-aspirated ‘ch’), the French word ‘concorde’ (non-aspirated k), the Spanish word ‘palabra’ (non-aspirated ‘p’) and the 8\n\nThai for Beginners\n\nItalian word ‘tenente’ (non-aspirated ‘t’). In Thai, the aspirated as well as the non-aspirated varieties of these sounds exist, and they are distinctive. This means that, in Thai, they are not varieties of the same sound, but distinctively different phonemes. This in its turn means that aspiration or non-aspiration in a consonant can define the meaning of a morpheme. Compare for instance:  (kj - chicken) and  (khj - egg),  (con - poor) and  (chon to collide),  (tk - to hang to dry, to expose) and  (thk - to chip, to hew, to graze (of a bullet)),  ( - label, sign, signboard, bus-stop sign)  ( - to be defeated)  You will have noticed that there are three (still actively used) letters for ‘kh’ in Thai, three for ‘ch’, two for ‘t’, four for ‘s’, two for ‘j’, two for ‘n’, six for ‘th’, two for ‘f’, two for ‘l’, two for ‘h’, two for ‘d’ and three for ‘ph’. A reason for this luxury is that Thai is a tonal language, and in a syllabic letter-script, there must be enough letters in an alphabet to note those tones down. To simplify notation, all consonants must be divided in three Registers or Classes; High, Middle and Low. By designing consonants of which the NonClass characteristics are equal, but which, by their membership of those different classes, can control the tone of the syllable they lead, the Thai have developed a basic instrument with which it is possible to note down the tone of a Thai syllable very adequately. The division in classes of the consonants is therefore one of the reasons for the many consonants with the same non-Class characteristics. Another reason for the multitude of consonants is that some letters arrived with early loan words from Pali and Sanskrit, that stood for sounds which do not (longer) fit in the Thai pronunciation system. Examples are the retroflex ‘t’-s (,) and post-alveolar ‘s’-es (, ), the aspirated ‘bh’ () and the palatal ‘n’ (). These letters simply lost their distinction from others, as they were gradually completely integrated in the Thai phonemic system.  and  became equal to ; retroflex plosives  and  moved in the direction of  and , aspirated, voiced  became unvoicedas , and palatal  equal to . The Laotian script, which is from a far more recent date than the Thai, but is based on Thai and older Thai scripts, has not so many ‘superfluous’ consonants.  Like in every language which already has had its own script for a number of centuries, many Thai words have an anomalous spelling. In this course, all anomalies in spelling will be pointed out to you. A number of words, for instance, start with clusters of initial consonants, like  (th + r),  (c + r),  (s + r) or  (s + r).  is pronounced as ‘s’,  as ‘c’, and  as well as  are pronounced as ‘s’. The combination  is pronounced as ‘a’ ( -  - ‘karma’) of ‘an’ ( -  - ‘scissors’). These are, as you can see, not real clusters, but fixed combinations of consonants with an irregular pronunciation. Furthermore, the tones in some words are pronounced differently from how they should be pronounced according to the rules for writing tones down. This can be either due to modern developments in the living language (such as in the case of the tones for the word  ( - ‘I’ (spoken by women)), which is actually pronounced ‘’ in modern Thai), or just without any obvious reason (such as in the word ‘’ - ‘thief’, which is actually written as  (). In the vocabulary in the lessons, an anomalous spelling or pronunciation has been marked with an asterisk (*), and the correct pronunciation is given in the transcription-script\n\n9\n\nThai for Beginners\n\ncd 1a track 2\n\n1.3.2\n\nThe 32 vowels (including diphthongs and triphthongs)\n\nA vowel or a diphthong can be written behind, in front of, under, above or around a consonant. The sound element that makes a diphthong a triphthong always follows the last element of the diphthong, so triphthongs are not considered at this juncture. In the following list,  always functions as the ‘bearer’ of the vowel or diphthong, and has no sound value of its own. It takes the sound qualities of the vowel- or diphthong sound it bears. Beware of the fact that  can also be part of a diphthong. In those cases,  as ‘bearer’ is obviously followed by  as part of the diphthong. A word written as  is pronounced as ‘aa’ (‘ah’). If  were substituted by a consonant with an independent sound value, like  (non-aspirated ‘t’), the word would be ; ‘taa’ (‘tah’). In the following list, the spot where  stands can be taken by any consonant, and defines the space that must be occupied by a consonant for a script sequence to make sense. A ‘written sound’, be it vowel or diphthong, is called  - ‘’ (also:‘s;‘s’ ) in Thai. In the transcription, the tone of the vowels and diphthongs in the list have been ignored, as the tone of a syllable is dependent on the class of the consonant it starts with, as well as its ending.\n\nThe Thai vowels, dipthongs and triphthongs\n\n10\n\n and vowel/diphthong\n\nname\n\ntranscription\n\npronunciation\n\n (open syllable)\n\n\n\n \n\n1\n\n + consonant\n\n  \n\n\n\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n\n\n\n\nsar \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n (open syllable)\n\n\n\nsar \n\n; \n\n + consonant\n\n -   \n\nsar  -   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n (open syllable)\n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n2\n\n2\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n and vowel/diphthong\n\nname\n\ntranscription\n\npronunciation\n\n + consonant\n\n -   \n\n  -   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n (open syllable)\n\n\n\n \n\n 3\n\n + consonant\n\n ...  \n\n  ...  \n\n;  3\n\n\n\n ...  \n\n  ...  \n\n;  4\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n;  4\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n; \n\n\n\n\n\n  …  \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n ;  \n\n; ,  5\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n 5\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n;  5\n\n\n\n \n\n l\n\nl 5\n\n11\n\nThai for Beginners\n\nNotes on the vowels, diphthongs and triphthongs: ¹\n\nThe short a/ - sound is written with  a - () - in open syllables (for instance  - / ).

In only one word, the character is pronounced as ‘reu’:  ().  ( ) is used as an independent syllable in words like  (),  ().  () and  () are not used anymore, but, when still productive, their use was based on the same principles as that of  and .\n\nThe inherent vowels: short ‘o’, short ‘a’ and long ‘oo’ Inherent vowels are vowels, which are not represented by a character. In words that exist of two written consonants, the inherent vowel is a short ‘o’.

When King Ramkhamhaeng the Great devised the first real Thai alphabet, he designed an alphabet that was based on the sounds of the language: not on the meaning of concepts, like Chinese script, which consist of ideograms. He also developed a script that could represent the tonemes of his language clearly and correctly. For the design of his characters, he drew from examples in non-tonal languages, such as Khmer and Pali. Khmer had consonant registers for inherent vowels, which might have made the King hit upon the idea to developed consonant registers for tones. Thus, three consonant registers were created. The registers – or classes, as we call them most often – stayed as the language developed, and additional tonal signs were designed when the language changed over the centuries from a three-tone system into a five-tone communication device. A Thai from King Ramkhamhaeng’s Kingdom of Sukhothai would not be able to read the modern script (and if you haven’t studied it, it’s difficult to make out the letters in the Sukhothai script), but the principle had stayed the same. A three-register, or three-class consonant system still exists. To reduce the tone of a written syllable from the way it is written, you’ll need to take four factors into account: 13\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n1. The end-sound of the syllable; (stop (unreleased ‘k’, ‘p’ or ‘t’, or glottal stop), nasal, semivowel or vowel) 2. The length of the vowel in the syllable 3. The Class (or register) of the first consonant at the beginning of the syllable 4. The presence of a Tone Mark above the first consonant of the syllable – or in a consonantcluster, above the last consonant in that cluster – and, if so, which one.\n\n1.4.1\n\nThe Tone Markers\n\nBelow are the signs for the four tone markers ( - wnnjúk), along with their names, with  (oo ng) as their bearer.

It is a monosyllabic word consisting of a  ( ), a  ( ), and a  ( ). First you start looking in de column headed ‘end of syllable’ what characteristics are valid for your word. It ends on a  ( ), which is a stop. Next, you are going to look what vowel your word uses; is it short or long? You’ll find out that  ( ) is a long vowel, so you have a word with a long vowel, ending in a stop. The next, and in this case the last piece of information you need is the class of the initial consonant. Your word starts with  ( ), which is a low class consonant. Now, under the heading ‘class of initial consonant’, you will find that a syllable starting with a low initial consonant, containing a long vowel and ending in a stop, will have a falling tone. Finding the tone for words with a tone marker is easier. Just look at the column ‘class of initial consonant’ and go directly to the tone marker in question. A tone marker overrules all other tone rules!\n\n16\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n1.4.5\n\nThe consonant class modifiers ‘’ and ‘’\n\nBy placing a   () - a high class consonant - in front of a low class consonant, this low class consonant is ‘upgraded’ to become a high class consonant, itself, and thereby endowed with all the characteristics of a high class consonant.  itself is not pronounced in these cases, and has the sole function of modifying the low class consonant into a high class consonant. By placing an   () - a middle class consonant - in front of a low class consonant, this low class consonant is ‘upgraded’ to become a middle class consonant, and thereby endowed with all characteristics of a middle class consonant.  itself is not pronounced in these cases, and has the sole function of modifying the low class consonant. Look at the following examples:\n\n   .   .  .  - mouse HIGH CLASS consonant  modifies LOW CLASS consonant  into a HIGH CLASS consonant.

Observe that the tone marker (  -  ) is placed over the , not over the modifier ().\n\n\n\n  .   .   .   .\n\n\n\n-\n\nto want\n\nMIDDLE CLASS consonant  modifies LOW CLASS consonant  into a MIDDLE CLASS consonant.

The word ‘’ is pronounced according to the tone rules valid for words which start with a MIDDLE CLASS consonant, and thus with a low tone. Observe that the tone marker (  -  ) is placed over the , not over the modifier (). (see the diagram for the tone rules). Attention: As mentioned in 1.3.2,  ( ) doesn’t always modify or ‘upgrade’ low class consonants when placed at the beginning of a syllable in front of a consonant. It more often 17\n\nThai for Beginners functions either as a short or long  in front of this consonant, or as an independent vowel syllable (short , short  or long ). See examples there.\n\n1.4.6\n\nSpelling anomalies\n\nRemember that a tone is a fixed phoneme (element that defines the meaning of a word) in every Thai word. If you pronounce the tone wrong, you pronounce the word wrong. The meaning of a word can change completely if you change the tone of that word. As other languages, Thai has its fair share of exceptions of pronunciation- and spelling-rules. The most striking anomaly concerning the pronunciation of tones is: the tone of unstressed initial syllables – syllables in which no vowel is written – or syllables existing only of a short ‘a’ () or a short ‘u’ () are often not pronounced in a low tone, like the diagram shows, but in a mid tone. There are some more discrepancies between spelling and pronunciation which cannot all be mentioned here. In the vocabularies in the lessons and in the appendices, all words with a pronunciation that differs from its spelling are marked with an asterisk (*). The correct pronunciation is given in the transcription script.\n\n1.4.7\n\nConsonant clusters and tone marks in consonant clusters\n\nThe tone rules valid for the initial consonant of a syllable determine the tone of that syllable. In syllables, which start with more than one consonant (a consonant cluster), the tone rules which are valid for the first consonant in that cluster determine the tone of the syllable. Let us take, for example, the word ‘’ (klìp); ‘petal’, ‘segment of fruit’. This monosyllabic word ends with a stop ( - boo bajmáaj, at the end of a syllable pronounced as p’ (unreleased ‘p’). The last consonant pronounced before the vowel (long ‘’; - ) is the loo ling (), a LOW class consonant. A syllable starting with a LOW class consonant, with a long vowel, and ending in a STOP (in this case: p’) is pronounced in a FALLING tone. In other words; if the word would be ‘’, it would be pronounced as ‘lîp’, in a falling tone. But the initial consonant of the cluster ‘’ with which the word starts, is koo kàj (), a MIDDLE class consonant, and koo kàj is the consonant which determines the tone of the word. The second consonant in the cluster – loo ling, a LOW Class Consonant – changes class, as it follows directly upon a MIDDLE Class consonant, and looses, as it were, its right to determine the tone of the syllable it is part of. Eventually, we are looking at a word that starts with a MIDDLE Class consonant, with a long vowel and a stop (p’) at the end. Following the tone rules, it is pronounced in a LOW tone. ‘’ is thus pronounced klìp, in a LOW tone. The tone mark, which further determines the tone of a word, is always written above the consonant in the closest position to the vowel; the one after which the vowel is directly pronounced. But although written above the second consonant, the tone mark APPLIES TO the FIRST CONSONANT in the cluster. Let us analyze the word ‘’ (trùu); ‘very early in the morning’ to prove our point: Without its initial consonant  (too tw - MIDDLE class), ‘’ should be pronounced in a FALLING tone (), because  is a LOW class consonant, and the ‘máaj èek’ ( - ) with which it is adorned would compel any word or syllable with an initial 18\n\nThai for Beginners\n\nLOW consonant to be pronounced in a falling tone. But although máaj èek sits above the second consonant in the cluster, the first consonant, , determines the tone of the syllable, and so, máaj èek refers to . A MIDDLE class consonant as  with a máaj èek as an initial consonant thus determines that the word  must be pronounced with a LOW tone (trùu).\n\n1.4.8\n\nStressed and non-stressed syllables\n\nJust as English words, Thai words are built up from stressed as well as non-stressed syllables. Non-stressed syllables without vowel characters have already been briefly mentioned in 1.3.2. We have seen that in short, non-stressed, initial syllables without vowel characters (oo ng (), pronounced as short ‘o’ or ‘a’), the tone of these syllables automatically becomes MID in spoken Thai. In non-stressed syllables with vowel characters, the tone also automatically becomes MID. For instance, in the word ‘’ (rj; ‘what?’), the tone of the first syllable normally becomes MID. If ‘’ is pronounced in anger or surprise (‘what?!’), the first syllable of the word is usually stressed, and correctly pronounced in a LOW tone. Also in other, polysyllabic (loan) words we encounter mid tones in non-stressed syllables, where we would expect low or high tones if we adhere to the tone rules. The correct tones for the pronunciation of the word  (mhwtthjlj - ‘university’) are, for instance: high-rising-high-highmid-mid. Most commonly though, the word is pronounced as ‘mhwtthjlj’: mid-risinghigh-mid-mid-mid. In the transcriptions of dialogues, vocabulary lists and other texts, the tones of words are given as they should be pronounced. On the CD’s, you’ll be able to listen to the actual, daily life pronunciation of the tones. In the vocabulary lists, words with an ‘illogical’ anomalous pronunciation are marked with an asterisk (*).\n\n1.5\n\nDiacritics and punctuation marks\n\nThe Thai script makes use of some punctuation marks which are important for the coordination between speech and script:\n\n\n\n-\n\nThe sign over the  is a  (kn) or   ( ); It indicates that the consonant under it, and in some cases part of the whole consonant cluster at the end of a word is not pronounced. The kn occurs in loanwords from Pali, Sanskrit, and English, such as  ( - teacher),  ( - art),  ( - style)\n\n\n\n-\n\nThe sign over the  is a  (mj tj khûu). It shortens the vowel in the syllable over which main consonant it is placed (for instance:  - lk -‘small’).\n\n\n\n-\n\nThe   (peujjn nóoj) shortens a long, well known word (for instance: the Chulalongkorn - University () is known as ‘Chula’ () in short. 19\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n -\n\nThe   (peujjn jj) is equivalent with the western etcetera - symbol (&c.)\n\n\n\nThe   (mók) signifies that the word on which it follows has to be pronounced\n\n-\n\ntwice (for instance:  -   - ‘often’). Colons (:), semicolons (;), question marks (?), quotation marks (“-”)exclamation marks (!) and thought dots (...), are officially not part of the Thai alphabet, though occur quite often in novels, flyers and other modern Thai texts.\n\n1.6\n\nWriting Thai\n\nIn a Thai sentence, words are written behind each other without spaces. In places where in English a comma or a full stop would divide clauses and sentences, in Thai a space is left open. Fast word recognition is essential to the fluent reading of Thai. In elementary school, Thai children learn how to read in primers with texts in which separate words are still separated by a space. This is done to make a child recognize the appearance of separate words as fast as possible, in order to enable them, when they start reading books which are written ‘inanadultmanner’, to separate the words in its mind more easily. In this course we shall use the same principle. Until lesson 24, the words in a Thai sentence will be written separately from each other, like in English, by a space. By the time you reach that chapter, your vocabulary will be sufficiently large to recognize words you already know. You’ll also be able to determine patterns of words you don’t know, yet, in a sentence written in Thai-style, so you can easily find those words back in the vocabulary lists provided with each chapter.\n\n1.7\n\nOur transcription method\n\nIn this course, we shall use an easy method for transcribing Thai sounds. The method will take a minimum of time to get accustomed to for speakers of English. With the help of this method and with the pronunciation- and exercise CD’s you’ll learn to pronounce Thai phonemes quickly and accurately. The system is based on the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), but beware, it has been amended to be optimally serviceable for the Thai language without using IPA characters that might be too obscure for the general learner.

We hear the glottal stop at the beginning of words, which begin with a vowel. If we say ‘all’ or\n\n21\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n‘ever’ Just before we utter the sound written as ‘a’ and ‘e’ in these examples, we open our glottis to release air in order to say the words we want to say. If we do this the other way around, and close our glottis to stop the flush of air from our lungs, we would pronounce a glottal stop after a vowel; we would pronounce the . Speakers of Cockney do it all the time. For each stop at the end of a word, be it p, t or k, a genuine Cockney substitutes . The glottal stop is comparable with the pronunciation of the ‘c’ in the word ‘action’ (an unreleased ‘k’, formed against the soft palate; a so-called velar stop), but is pronounced deeper down the throat: Instead of pressing the uvula against the soft palate, which you do when you pronounce a velar stop, the air flow in pronouncing the glottal stop is stopped by closing your glottis. In Thai, the glottal stop occurs at the end as well as at the beginning of a syllable. In this course, the sound is transcribed with  where it is not automatically produced by English speakers. It will not be shown at the beginning of each syllable starting with a vowel, as both English and Thai speakers automatically pronounce a glottal stop before releasing an initial vowel. The glottal stop sign  will be shown when a glottal stop always occurs at the end of or in the middle of a certain lexeme ( - l,  - kâw-). In a few words, the glottal stop is optional (for instance in  - cà, cà;  - ná, ná). In the transcription of dialogues, words with an optional glottal stop will be transcribed as most appropriate given the circumstances in the texts.

In Thai, there are no cases, no articles, no noun genders, and no verb conjugations. The order of the sentence is Subject-Verb-Object, or Subject-Verb-Adjunct. Certainly, the Thai language offers enough pitfalls and challenges, such as the script, the tones, polite particles, question particles, classifiers, an initially confusing time indication system and a very large amount of idiomatic expressions. But Thai grammar is relatively easy to master. The Thai script doesn’t have a different set of capital letters. There is no difference in form between lower case letters, capital letters, italics and handwritten letters. There is just one alphabet, although many typefaces have been designed (the Thai are enthusiastic graphic designers).\n\n1.9\n\nExercises\n\nTo accustom yourself to the forms of the Thai script, write every letter of the alphabet (consonants and vowels) down a number of times, until you get the feeling you’re writing the letter right. If you would like to learn the sound that goes with the letter immediately, as well, feel free, although nobody will expect you to master the whole alphabet after this mere introduction. The letters of the alphabet will be thoroughly repeated in the next eleven lessons, and after lesson 12 you’ll be able to read and write Thai without cribbing. It must be emphasized once more that is important to get the form of the Thai letters into your subconscious. It is a simple fact that, without learning how to read and write, you’ll never learn Thai well. Write the letters as follows: 1. You start with the little circle, which you will find on every consonant, except two, and on many of the vowels. The circle is called ‘’ (hu) in Thai; ‘head’. The following three 24\n\nThai for Beginners letters, which consist of two components, have two ‘hu’;\n\n - joo jng\n\n - thoo thaan\n\n - soo rues\n\nTwo consonants don’t have any ‘hu’:\n\n -  \n\n -  \n\nWhen writing the letters without ‘hua’, start with the left-most open end of the letter. When writing  and , start left-below and left in the middle respectively. 2. When the ‘hua’ is complete, draw the rest of the letter without taking your pen from the paper, until finished. 3. The following vowel signs have no ‘hua’:\n\n , , , and  When writing these characters, most Thai start in the upper left corner of the  , and draw the curved line through until it reaches the lower limit of the x-height. When writing the characters  ( ),  ( ) and  ( ), start at the right, and draw the lower line of the little half moon to the left; then draw the upper line of the little half moon back to the right. After that, add the little vertical strokes. 5. The character  ( ) has a little circle, but this doesn’t count as a ‘hua’, because the vowel sign is formed in the same way as the characters under 4. First the little half moon is drawn, then the little circle. To show you how what a Thai sentence looks like, here is an example sentence with vowels in front of, behind, under, after, above and around the consonants, tone marks, high-written vowels and diphthongs; spaces between clauses and punctuation marks. Notice that the manner of the parts of letters, vowels, tone marks et cetera, stick out above and under the standard letter height:\n\n    2545            Good Luck!\n\n25\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n26\n\nThai for Beginners\n\nTHAI FOR BEGINNERS LESSON 2 Questions and answers      2.1 2.2 2.3 2.4 2.5 2.6 2.7\n\nIntroduction The Thai sentence (1) Cultural notes Characteristics of the Thai language The Thai sentence (2) Exercises Answers to exercise 1\n\n27\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n28\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n2.1\n\nIntroduction In lesson one you have been introduced to the basics of the Thai script and the fundamentals of the Thai language. In this lesson, you actually start learning Thai. Just like a linguist on the first day of his fieldwork, you will learn to ask some simple but important questions – and see some possible answers.\n\nYou will notice that the study texts, and every word in the word lists, are offered to you written in the Thai script as well as in the transcription system. This is done to offer you a written reference of every Thai word and sentence you will learn before you have actually mastered the Thai script after lesson 12. It is recommended that you repeat the sections written in Thai from time to time, as in the beginning of your study your reading and writing skills will probably lag behind your speaking and listening skills for a while. Fast word recognition is the basis of learning to read Thai fluently. As has been made clear in section 1.6., Thai script doesn’t use as much punctuation as written English, and words in a sentence are written after each other in fluent rows, without spaces between the words. In this course, Thai texts will be written in the true Thai way starting from the 25th lesson (in Intermediate Thai Part 2). Until that lesson, Thai words are written separated from each other, like in Thai primary school primers. This is done to let you gradually reach the point where you’ll recognize words as separate entities of form and meaning from what at first will first seem like endless rows of curly characters. Exercises in word recognition are, from now on, an essential part of the course. Starting from lesson seven, when you’ll know enough words to be able to actually follow a written text, the alphabet will be repeated step by step, and you’ll learn more about the tricks and pitfalls of the Thai system of writing. In the first few lessons of the course, you will learn how to speak basic Thai, and you will start building up your fundamental knowledge of grammar and idioms.\n\ncd 1a track 3\n\n2.2\n\nThe Thai sentence (1)\n\nThe affirmative sentence: word order Thai is an SVO-language; this means that an affirmative sentence consists, in principle, of a Subject, a Verb, and an Object, and is also built up in that order (Subject-Verb-Object); just like English.\n\n\n\ncôj kin \n\nJoy (girl’s name)- to eat- rice\n\nJoy eats (rice)\n\nThe interrogative sentence: the question particle The word order of a question is the same as that of an affirmative sentence. Because Thai is a tonal language, a question is not indicated by intonation as in English (in which every word can be made into a question by using a rising intonation (O.K.? Yes?), but by means of a question particle, which is a fixed word appearing at the end of a question. There are two basic question particles: 29\n\nThai for Beginners\n\n\n\nmaj\n\nused in general questions\n\n\n\nrue\n\nused in rhetorical questions, or in questions in which the only possible answers are ‘yes’ or ‘no’. (yes-no questions)\n\nThe question particle is, just like the rising intonation in English (in spoken language) and the question mark (in written language), always placed at the end of a sentence.\n\n Joy eat rice [question particle]\n\ncôj kin  maj Is Joy eating (rice)?\n\n Older-brother/sister eat already [question particle]\n\nph kin  lw rue Have you (has elder brother) eaten rice already?\n\nDemonstrative and relative pronouns Like in every other language, including English, demonstrative pronouns in Thai are used to indicate things. Demonstrative pronouns should not be confused with relative pronouns. Where in English, the demonstrative pronoun and the relative pronoun can sometimes be easily confused (‘That is a book’; ‘The book that I read’), the difference between Thai demonstrative pronouns and relative pronouns is clear and lies in the tone… Look at the following questions and answers:\n\n    \n\nQuestions and answers\n\n30\n\nWhat is this? n \n\nWhat is this?  khue \n\nWhat is this? n pen \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWhat is that? nn \n\nWhat is that? nn khue \n\nWhat is that? nn pen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is that over there? nn \n\nWhat is that over there? nn khue \n\nWhat is that over there? nn pen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a book.  nngsue\n\nThis is a book.  khue nngsue\n\nThis is a book. nî pen nngsue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat is a pen. nn pkk\n\nThat is a pen. nn khue pkk\n\nThat is a pencil. nn pen \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThai for Beginners\n\n    \n\nQuestions and answers What are these? n \n\nWhat are these? n khue \n\nWhat are these? n pen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are those? nn \n\nWhat are those? nn khue \n\nWhat are those? nn pen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are those (over there)? nn \n\nWhat are those (over there)? nn khue \n\nWhat are those (over there)? nn pen \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose (over there) are houses. nn bn\n\nThose (over there) are fields. nn khue n\n\nThose (over there) are people. nn pen khon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are notebooks.  \n\nThose are erasers.  \n\nThose (over there) are girls.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose (over there) are tables. \n\nThose are chairs. \n\nThese are clothes  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is this?
