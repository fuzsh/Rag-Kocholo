        "text": "By: Panu Wongcha-Um (B.A. (Hons) Melb), 2010\n\nA Thesis Submitted For Degree of Master of Arts Department of History National University of Singapore.\n\nAn Introduction\n\nThere is a degree of ambiguity attached to the understanding of Thai cuisine. Having lived half of my life outside of Thailand, it seems that food became Thai only in foreign settings, whereas Thai food in Thailand is rarely identified in such fashion. There must be, to borrow Roland Barthes’ terminology, ‘a system of communication’, and an established body of knowledge that enables Thais and foreigners alike to identify what food is and is not Thai. The making of this body of knowledge and its system of communication shall be explored in this thesis.\n\nIn the popular understanding and representation, ‘Thai’ cuisine today can be divided into seven subsidiary variations. Six of these are distinguishable regional variations: Northern or Lanna, North-eastern or Isan, Eastern, Southern, Central Plain, and Bangkok. The seventh variation is the royal cuisine. The emergence of a singular ‘Thai’ cuisine, as marketed throughout the world today, represents an encompassing culinary landscape that includes dishes from all of these subsidiary culinary cultures.\n\nThe problem is not unlike the emergence of an ‘Indian’ cuisine discussed by Arjun Appadurai, who argues that a singular ‘Indian’ cuisine materialized, and continues to do so, through the increase of representations and articulations of varieties of culinary forms, a cultural process influenced by what he calls ‘the seductiveness of variety’. The invention of an ‘Indian’ cuisine, as argued by Appadurai, belongs to the larger cultural process of constructing a complex national public culture, spearheaded by the urban middle class in accordance to the spirit of nationalism, and also fueled by the new socio-economic dynamic of the post-colonial era.\n\nIn the case of ‘Thai’ cuisine, the formulation of the culinary form came about in a landscape dominated by the culture of the Central Thais, and led by their aristocratic elites. Two factors played an important part in this formulation: first, the social dynamic of Thai settlement; and secondly, the emergence of Bangkok as the political and cultural center of Siam following the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767. But before proceeding, scholarly approaches in understanding cuisine need to be explored.\n\nAnthropological Approaches to Food\n\nFood scholars have evaded the ambiguity of ‘cuisine’ by concentrating on the larger process of food production, often referred to as the ‘food system’. This system consists of ‘complex interdependent interrelationships associated with the production and distribution of food’ that can be divided into five different phases: growing or farming, distribution and storing of ingredients, cooking or preparing, eating and consumption, and disposing of leftovers.\n\n[expander_maker id=”1″]\n\nThis concept of the ‘food system’ is utilized by scholars from a variety of academic fields, but its initial usage was mainly by anthropologists. The cultural meaning of ‘cuisine’ is dealt with by two different anthropological approaches: the first concentrates on the cultural meanings of food from its preparation and production, while the second focuses on its consumption and consumer’s demand.\n\nThe first approach, inspired largely by Claude Lévi-Strauss and Mary Douglas, reduces the process of food production, preparation, and presentation to a system of syntagmatic relations, or linguistic structure. This method approaches food from the way a meal is produced, prepared, and cooked. It does this by treating food as ‘encrypted codes’ so that the social components of dishes need to be ‘decoded’ to reveal ‘pattern of social relations’ such as ‘hierarchy, inclusion and exclusion, boundaries and transactions across the boundaries’ within the food system. As Douglas herself remarks, this approach requires a ‘close understanding of a microscale social system’, meaning that the analysis unravels the social component of dishes at a certain place and time.\n\nThe weakness of this approach in analyzing the making of a ‘cuisine’ is that it only offers a static social picture existing in a static timeframe. It usefully explains the need to unravel the various culinary codes that exist within the repertoire of a meal to understand the social dynamic behind the concoction of a cuisine. However, the process of the identity making of the ‘cuisine’ is left unanswered. This approach may explain, for example, how a certain dish like kaeng matsaman, or ‘the curry of the Muslim’ considering that the Thai word matsaman derived from Persian and Arabic word musliman or ‘Muslim’, came to Siam via Muslim traders in the seventeenth century Persian-Siamese trade. Nevertheless, this does not explain the historical process of how matsaman became a dish in ‘Thai’ cuisine. The framework of a ‘microscale social system’ also leaves little room for understanding the creative dimension of cooking itself.\n\nTreating each culinary code as either the ‘lexicon’ or ‘grammar’ of a meal does not explain why new cooking techniques are incorporated into the preparation of an old dish, or why ingredients are added overtime, or in some cases, why old ingredients are left out. It also does not explain the existence of many variations of a dish. Going back to the example of matsaman, approaching the meal as a rigid linguistic code does not sufficiently explain why modern matsaman is oily and highly seasoned with tamarind and sugar, as opposed to the Ayutthayan version that required only dried spices, onions, and ginger. In short, this approach relies too much on the particular concept of a dish in unlocking its culinary code. Food, after all, is very different from language. As Mintz points out, ‘we can eat without meals, but we cannot speak without grammar’. The cultural importance of linguistic structure, from its usage to its grammar, is very different from the reliance of food dishes to styles of dining.\n\nThe second anthropological approach led by scholars such as Jean-François Revel, Jack Goody, Michael Freeman, Arjun Appadurai, and Sidney Mintz is largely influenced by the work of French sociologist, Pierre Bourdieu. Still viewing ‘cuisine’ as part of the larger ‘food system’, these scholars approach the system by dissecting culinary codes through consumption and demand in order to identify food’s relationship with the wider social and cultural structure. They do this largely by using social class as a tool of analysis. It was Freeman, in his analysis of the Chinese culinary landscape during the Sung dynasty (960-1279 AD), who first pointed out that ‘cuisine’ is related to the particular system of producing and distributing food. This system includes: availability of ingredients derived from both farmland and trade, and a society daring to indulge in food consumption and be experimental in food preparation.\n\nGoody adopted Freeman’s approach and expanded it by identifying internal social dynamics of ‘high’ and ‘low’ culinary traits within a society’s gastronomic culture. He argues that it is important to view food, from its production, preparation, and consumption, as comparative to social structure. This comparison between food and society is distinguishable in terms of social hierarchy. Goody’s identification of the ‘high’ and ‘low’ culinary subsystem is echoed by Revel, who argues that ‘any cooking, in any country and in any tradition, has two sources’. one ‘popular’, and another ‘erudite’.\n\n‘Popular cuisine’ is based on nature: ingredients deriving from the soil, determined by geographical region and seasonal changes; and meals prepared by age-old cooking methods, passed down from generation to generation. ‘Erudite cuisine’ is based on invention, renewal, and experimentation. As Revels puts it, ‘in the course of history there has been a peasant cuisine and a court cuisine; a plebeian cuisine and a family cuisine prepared by the mother; and a cuisine of professionals that only chefs fanatically devoted to their art have the time and the knowledge to practice.’\n\nThese two definitions, of ‘popular’ and ‘erudite’, offer a model adopted by others who have looked at ‘cuisine’ in various contexts. Mintz articulates this dichotomy by arguing that there is no ‘cuisine’ other than the ‘popular’ one. For him, ‘cuisine’ has to do with the ongoing food system of a region ‘within which active discourse about food sustains both common understanding and reliable production’ of that particular culinary code . The ‘erudite’ cultural demarcation is simply a representation of more than one regional culinary code and its articulation can even be considered ‘imagined’, basing itself on the larger cultural and socio-political dynamic of a particular time .\n\nThe dichotomization between ‘high’ and ‘low’ can be utilized in a social context by consulting Bourdieu’s work. In reference to food consumption, Bourdieu defines the ‘taste of luxury’ as ‘taste of individuals who are the products of material conditions of existence defined by distance from necessity, by the freedoms or facilities stemming from possession of capital’, whereas ‘taste of necessity’ is largely defined by individuals’ adjustment to their economic condition . This view is shared by Roland Barthes in his analysis of food recipes in French popular magazines. He points out that the ‘bourgeois’ inclined magazines provide elaborate recipes that use a variety of ingredients, both for consumption as well as garnishing, whereas magazines with a largely working class audience import more practical, and straightforward food recipes . In short, the cultural choice of food consumption that is manifested in the cultural identification of a culinary code is based upon social differentiation within a society. But how does this dichotomization work in a specific historical context? Historical work on food shall now be examined.\n\nHistorical Approaches to Food\n\nFrench Historians from the Annales School were the first to look at food in various manners. Inspired by Fernand Braudel’s idea about different temporalities of historical time: from the longue durée or the near-constant duration determined; ecological changes; the conjoncture (conjuncture) or what he called ‘history of gentle rhythms of groups and grouping’, brought about by factors like consistent economic interactions; and the histoire événementielle or short-term sequences shaped by people. Historians who have looked at food applied Braudelian’s temporalities of historical time in various ways.\n\nThe work of Jean-Jacques Hémardinquer, for example, traces the role of the family pig and the consumption of pork meat from the sixteenth to nineteenth-century France. Using statistical records like pork meat prices, rates of population growth and rates of deforestation, Hémardinquer demonstrates how pork meat, the grub of medieval peasantry, became the food of the nobles and the bourgeoisie by the early modern period. The time frame of Hémardinquer’s historical enquiry reflected a mixture of two Braudelian temporalities: the longue durée in terms of the change that took place in the ecological system which shifted the agricultural pattern; the conjuncture in terms of shift in meat prices and consumption patterns of different social classes.\n\nOther French scholars influenced by the Annales School were less interested in the shifting consumption pattern of food. Rather, they were more interested in extracting the socio-cultural worldview (mentalités) associated with food culture from culinary texts and food-related literature. For example, Jean-Claude Bonnet looked at the eighteenth-century French worldview on the discourse of diet, fasting, and hunger from Denis Diderot’s Encyclopédie. In a similar fashion, Jean Leclant used diplomatic texts and trade statistics in analyzing the localization of coffee and the creation of French café culture in the seventeenth-century.\n\nThe French scholars were not the only ones who looked at the socio-cultural worldview of food. English sociologist, Stephen Mennell, who looked at the place of food in the social life of France and England, is an example. Mennell uses sources like cookbooks and women’s magazines to sketch the development of French and English gastronomie, the underlying attitude towards the enjoyment of food, from the Middle Ages through to the present. On the usage of cookbooks and culinary texts as a primary source, Mennell entered a debate with an English food writer Elizabeth David and the French Scholar Alain Girard. Girard and David argue that there are generally several decades’ time lag between actual cooking fashion and its textual culinary representation. Mennell, on the other hand, argues that food writing, in the context of his two case studies, represent the latest culinary fashion that is ahead of general practices . The utilization of the cookbook and culinary text as historical evidence thus needs careful contextualization within the larger social, literary, and cultural framework of the society in question.\n\nGiovanni Rebora and Massimo Montanari also took a similar approach to Mennell in looking at food culture in Italy and the Mediterranean world through consulting sources like cookbooks and culinary literature . Rebora in particular was expansive in his usage of sources in portraying the early modern gastronomic worldview of not just Italy, but the Mediterranean world. The food culture, as he points out, respond to major political happenings, changes in the territorial order of regimes, great discoveries, the outcome of wars, the triumphs and defeats of countries, and to international commercial agreements . Other scholars have similarly used a variety of sources in looking at food in relation to the wider socio-cultural worldview. Emiko Ohnuki-Tierney, for example, employs sources like religious texts, folklore, taxation records, and statistics on seasonal patterns in her analysis of food and the formation of a modern Japanese identity .\n\nThe dialectical relationship between food and modern cultural identity is explored in Appadurai’s work on the making of Indian national cuisine . Applying Goody’s idea of the ‘high’ and the ‘low’ to the context of post-colonial India, Appadurai looks how modern Indian cookbooks helped creating a national cuisine from regional variations.\n\nIn his analogy between the ‘high’ and the ‘low’ culinary code, Appadurai points out the typical dichotomy between court food and peasant food, as well as the distinction between the diet of urban centers and rural peripheries. The ‘high cuisine’ in preindustrial society, Appadurai argues, ‘drew upon regional, provincial and folk materials and recipes’ . This cultural phenomenon is attributed to the elite desire to ‘display their political power and commercial reach, and their cosmopolitan taste by drawing in ingredients and techniques and even cooks from far and wide’. This approach is adopted by Thai scholars who have attempted a conceptual formulation of the Thai culinary code in the Thai cultural landscape.\n\nFood in the Thai Context\n\nThai scholars have identified two social spaces in the Thai cultural landscape in which the culinary code could be formulated: the town (muang) and the temple (wat), the religious center of the community . Sombat Plainoi argues that the social spaces of towns are the grounds for the concoction of cooking techniques, and a confluence of raw ingredients collected from the countryside and acquired through trade .\n\nAdopting an outlook similar to Revel’s and Mintz’s, Sombat divides the Thai culinary code in terms of chao muang, or townspeople, and chao chonnabot, or rural folks .\n\nAnother social site that brings together a variety of culinary codes is ‘the temple’. From providing daily alms to monks through merit making (tham bun) in religious ritual and festivities, the social space centered around ‘the temple’ provides an alternative site to the town in bringing together various culinary codes from the countryside on a regular basis. The social spaces around the ‘temple’ provides a site where there is an ongoing communication about food from the surrounding community, arguably sufficient in shaping the culinary code of a region.\n\nThai scholars points to the Hit Sipsong Khong Sipsi, or ‘the twelve annual festivals and fourteen social rituals’ observed by people in the Lao-Isan region, as a possible social phenomenon that shaped the culinary code of Isan . The Hit Sipsong Khong Sipie is a year-long series of Buddhist festivities where people in the community join together in various merit-making occasions to pay their respect to their Buddhist faith, as well as local spirits and deceased relatives. A large part of the merit making involves the offering of specific delicacies, specifically designated for each occasion, to the monks, the local spirits, and the deceased.\n\nThis example shows how the culinary code from the countryside came together in the social space of the temple to shape a repertoire of dishes, distinctive for that particular community, in this case the Lao-Isan region. Nevertheless, the culinary exchange throughout the Hit Sipsong Khong Sipsi is very inflexible since the food associated with merit makings for each month is allocated and specified. For example, a delicacy known as khao pan is offered in March, khanom thian and khao tom mut is offered during Songkran festivals in April . With social norms determining specific delicacies involved for each month, there is little room for culinary inventiveness at ‘the temple’. The social space of the muang on the other hand, is more vibrant. The social dynamic of the muang will now be examined.\n\nSince at least the thirteenth century, concentrated Thai political settlements have been called muang. Without clearly defined territorial boundaries, the muang is better understood in Maurizio Peleggi’s words as ‘the spatial configuration of a hierarchical relation of power; the rulers of smaller muang subjected themselves to the authority of the overlord of larger muang by accepting tributary status. ‘ The organization of muang is done around the patriarch rulers (chao), who acted as ‘landlords’ both in terms of managing the agrarian economy of the surrounding area through the control of labor forces (phrai), as well as being responsible for organizing defense in times of trouble .\n\nIn the culinary realm, this distinction between the noble and ‘the rest’ was also reflected in language. In the classification of rice, for example, the word khao chao, (literally ‘rice of the noble’) was and is still used, to describe steamed rice, whereas the word khao phrai, (rice of the plebs), was used to describe sticky rice . Thai historian Suchit Wongthet speculates that this distinction between ‘rice of the noble’ and ‘rice of the plebs’ predates any known Thai kingdom, and can be traced back to the ancient Mon culture of the Dvaravati period (c. sixth to tenth century AD), situated in the delta of the Chaophraya River. The terminology came about because scholars hypothesize that Dvaravati rulers imported foreign rice for their consumption to distinguish themselves from their sticky-rice-eating subjects. The prominent Thai writer and former Prime Minister, Kukrit Pramoj (1911-1995), explains that this rice dichotomy was formulated in the vernacular language deriving from the rural phrai’s encounters with the chao’s diet in the urban social setting of a muang .\n\nAnother important aspect that needs to be considered is that up until the middle of the nineteenth century, the chao also controlled most of the trade that came to Siam from the outside world. Many of these traders settled on Siamese shores. In the seventeenth-century Ayutthaya for example, there were settlements of ‘Chinese, Viet, Cham, Mon, Portuguese, Arab, Indian, Persian, Japanese, and various Malay communities from the archipelago.’ Because of this cosmopolitan characteristic, the muang became a confluence of ethnically diverse culinary forms. Throughout this thesis, the anthropological term ‘foodway’ will be utilized in referring to the culinary sub-culture of the non-Thai ethnic groups, while the term ‘culinary code’ will be used in referring to food influence .\n\nThe ethnic diversity of the Thai muang and the relationship between the chao and foreign traders is the point of departure to understanding the formation of Thai cuisine. The first text best represents modern Thai cuisine as it emerged in the early nineteenth-century from the royal court of Bangkok. This text, known as Kap Hechom Khrueang Khao Wan (Boat Song Admiring the Savory and the Sweets), was composed by King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II, r. 1809-1824). The second chapter of this thesis looks at the foreign culinary influences of dishes by dissecting this text. Using the Braudelian approach of conjuncture, the chapter sketches the process that led various culinary codes, derived from centuries of seaborne trade, to become part of the Siamese court’s diet, the culinary ‘high’ code. At the same time, the Braudelian approach enables speculation about the diet of Siamese hinterland, and thus a sketch of the culinary ‘low’ will also be examined.\n\nThe third chapter explores the formation of a Thai culinary language that came about through the birth of the Thai cookbook. This process took place in the social space of the royal court with the first cookbook of Thai food, Mae Khrua Hua Pa (literally meaning ‘skillful women chefs’, and hereafter will be refer through as MKHP), published in 1908 by an aristocrat, Lady Plian Phasakorawong (1847-1912). This chapter sketches the shift in the Siamese elites’ culinary worldview about their diet, and its dialectical relation to the diet of other people. This shift in the mentality of the Siamese elite came about through the increasing threat of Western imperialism to Siam, best typified by the Bowring Treaty of 1855 that eroded much of the court’s power. In response to this threat, the Siamese elite modernized themselves by localizing western modernity a process known as siwilai. The cookbook was born in this context. This chapter focuses on the MKHP and consults sources like literature, memoirs and recollection accounts of Western sojourners in Siam, as well as Siamese sojourners in the West.\n\nThe fourth chapter examines at the enculturation of modern Thai cuisine and dissects the different cultural layers of this process based on different groups of Thai food consumers. This chapter traces the historical context in the development and maintenance of each of these culinary codes by using sources like cookbooks, memorial volumes, textbooks, and popular literature throughout the twentieth century. These culinary codes allow three different perspectives of modern day Thai gastronomic culture.\n\nThe observation of a two-centuries process in the making of this modern Thai gastronomic culture, from a sociological point of view, illustrated how food preparation and consumption corresponded with the socio-cultural dynamics of Thai society. The label of ‘Thai cuisine’ reflected the way people articulated their culinary identity in the context of the larger cultural landscape. Initiated by the royal court, the development of the Thai culinary culture reflected how Thai society views itself in terms of social classes, gender roles, and its national identity. The sketches of this two century-long process in the formation of Thai gastronomic culture also reflected how Thai society and its ruling elite interacted with the outside world and modernity.\n\nFormulating the Siamese Kitchen: Royal Menu and Culinary Conjunctures\n\nA love poem in the Thai literary canon, Kap Hechom Khrueang Khao Wan (hereafter KHKKW), composed by then Prince Isaransundhorn (who later became Rama II), is regarded by many to be the first comprehensive representation of the Thai culinary repertoire. Written sometime during the final years of the eighteenth century, it is believed that the poem was a dedication to Princess Bunrod, who later became Queen Sri Suriyendra Boroma Rachini (1767-1836) , Rama II’s wife and mother of King Mongkut (Rama IV, r.1851-1868) and Prince Pinklao (1808-1866) . This poem, more importantly, was a tribute to Princess Bunrod’s legendary culinary prowess. Princess Bunrod’s cooking was so celebrated that Lady Plian, a culinary legend of her own, paid tribute to her almost a century later. The ensemble of culinary dishes in the KHKKW was one of the earliest literary representations of a Siamese ‘high’ menu: a precursor to contemporary Thai cuisine. It also reflected the culinary interaction of the Bangkok court with the world around them.\n\nThe forty-seven stanzas of the poem are divided into three sections: savory dishes (khrueang kao), fruit (phonlamai), and sweets (khrueang wan). It provides reference to fourteen types of savory dishes, fourteen kinds of fruits, and sixteen kinds of sweets. Moreover, despite its theme of love and longing of a man for a woman, in the genre of a poetic boat song (kap heruea) used for pacing oarsmen in the procession of royal barges, the detailed description of food provides not only their name, but also the ingredients as well as the cooking techniques. Reading the poem today, its vivid description appears still very relevant to the repertoire of dishes in Thai cuisine.\n\nThe dishes in the KHKKW belong to the ‘high’ culinary code: a menu of the Siamese royal court in the early Rattankosin era. With the printing press still almost half a century away from its introduction to Siam, the KHKKW can be considered as a ‘fluid’ representation of food, transmitted orally as sung poetry. Scholars attributed the KHKKW to Princess Bunrod and pointed out that she, as wife and later Queen to Rama II, had an enormous influence on the formulation of the Bangkok court’s kitchen. Lady Plian utilized the KHKKW as a platform for her discussion of the Royal kitchen (khrueang chaonai) in the MKHP.\n\nThis alone reveals the importance of the KHKKW in the Thai culinary discourse. As a text, the KHKKW was the first piece of literature in the Thai language that provides a repertoire of food dishes consumed by the Siamese court, and probably the inhabitants of Bangkok at the time. This made the KHKKW the first Siamese food menu in which later generations of cookbooks of Thai food emulate and discuss. Following the approach taken by historian Janet Theonophano, where she likens the reading of a cookbook to ‘peering through the kitchen window’. of that cookbook’s author, in the case of KHKKW, we are peering through the dining table of Princess Bunrod and Prince Isaransundhorn. It is this dining table, and how some of the dishes got onto it, to which we shall now turn our attention.\n\nThe KHKKW was composed in the historical context of what historian Nidhi Eoseewong classifies as the rise of a Thai ‘bourgeois’ culture . According to his definition, the ‘bourgeois’ culture to which he refers was a new high culture that emerged from the royal court of the early Bangkok era, a culture that was markedly different from the aristocratic culture of Ayutthaya. This was because the Bangkok upper class, Nidhi argues, was formulated from an economic system where the main source of growth came from the royal court’s involvement with foreign trade. This early Bangkok upper class integrated the aristocracy, whose power rested on the control of labor, with the mercantile class that was made up of foreign settlers. As more foreign merchants became ennobled in the Thai feudal order (sakdina) Nidhi observes, the Thai aristocracy also absorbed many foreign cultural traits into their way of life. The KHKKW reflects this new ‘bourgeois’ culture from its literary style and content.\n\nThe KHKKW’s literary style demonstrates a merging of folk oral elements to the literary tradition of Ayutthaya’s royal court, a characteristic that is typical, as Nidhi points out, to the new ‘bourgeois’ literature of Bangkok . He further points out that this new literary tradition emerged in the late Ayutthaya period, before flourishing in the Bangkok court. Nidhi’s argument follows a similar observation made by Prince Damrong (1862-1943) who pointed out that boat songs produced in the court of King Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I, r.1782-1809) and Rama II are very similar in style to the boat song produced in the reign of King Boromakot (r.1732-1758) in the late Ayutthaya period . It was during this period, Prince Damrong argued, that the boat songs were first composed in Thai instead of the traditional use of Sanskrit .\n\nFurther, the mentioning of foreign food ingredients in the KHKKW, for example the usage of ‘Japanese fish sauce’ (nam pla yipun) in the making of Yum Yai, or name that indicates a point-of-origin, like the fruit ‘Chinese persimmon’ (phlub chin), reflects the receptive taste of Prince Isaransundhorn, and most likely many of the Siamese aristocratic households during that time. Being one of the important princes of the court and later becoming King, Prince Isaransundhorn’s receptiveness for foreign food revealed the degree of intimacy existing between the political elite and foreign trade. Taste for foreign cuisine suggested that the prince and his household were probably comfortable sharing tables with foreign merchants and settlers. The familiarity with foreign dishes supports what Nidhi sees as the emergence of a new culture, forged by the Bangkok political elites closeness to mercantilism .\n\nThe mentioning of dishes like kaeng matsaman (matsaman curry), kaeng chute rang nok (birds’ nest soup), khanom chip (Chinese dumpling) in the KHKKW also reflected Bangkok’s ethnically plural demographic . While some scholars have speculate that this culinary plurality may have existed in Ayutthaya as far back as the early seventeenth century through names of markets, folk legends, or foreigners’ observations, the KHKKW revealed for the first time how the Siamese assimilated foreign culinary influences in great detail. It also reflected the background of Princess Bunrod since many of these dishes were attributed to her. Princess Bunrod’s family, like many Ayutthaya evacuees came to settle along the waterways of Klong Bang Luang, next to King Taksin’s Thonburi palace. In spite of being born into a noble family, she made a living, as Sansanee Verasinchai points out, selling sweets until the age of fifteen . It was during her time in Klong Bang Luang that she cultivated her cooking skills, and adopted foreign influence dishes from the ethnically diverse settlers in the area.\n\nThe diversity of foreign dishes appealed to consumers like Prince Isaransundhorn and Princess Bunrod. An example of this would be the way he describes the ‘mysterious Middle Eastern (khaek) allure of the chicken curry’ . This fascination with foreign dishes and its ‘mysterious allure’ was rationalized by Lady Plian in the MKHP a century later. Lady Plian categorized KHHKW’s dishes according to the standard Thai nomenclature for foreignness like khaek, farang, and chin . These labels are a form of what anthropologist, Pattana Kitiarsa, calls ‘Siamese Occidentalism’, a ‘Thai production system of power/knowledge based on specific historical and culture encounters with its Others’ . In the case of food, these encounters came from trade, migration, and particularly, the way Thai kings and Thai aristocracies made foreign dishes their own. This chapter will scrutinize the Thai adaptation of foreign food by using Braudel’s approach of ‘historical conjunctures’ to examine culinary influences that led to the composition of the KHKKW .\n\n‘Conjuncture’ is the term Braudel used to distinguish historical development that occurs between the near-constant duration of changes, the longue durée, and the short-term sequence of events, or histoire événementielle . While the near- permanent dimension of history is determined by factors like ecology and climate, and the short-term dimension by people, ‘conjunctures’ are often associated with ‘chain of causality’ instigated by consistent sets of economic interaction and traffic of goods between regions over time, or the demographic dimension of a polity determined by movement of people .\n\nApplying the Braudelian approach to dissecting the Thai culinary landscape at the time the KHKKW was composed, three culinary conjunctures will be examined. The first two parts look at the seaborne culinary conjunctures, one coming from the West and another from the East of Siam. These two seaborne conjunctures are most apparent in the KHKKW. The last section will look at the hinterland culinary conjunctures, which are indistinctively represented in the KHKKW. Using other sources, the hinterland conjunctures represent a near constant culinary interaction that served as the foundation for the ‘high’ Siamese culinary code. This approach will reveal the culinary dynamic that led to the assembling of dishes in Rama II’s love poem; the earliest text that represent the Siamese ‘high’ kitchen.\n\nWestern Seaborne Culinary Conjunctures\n\nWestern culinary conjunctures identified by Lady Plian’s dissection of the KHHKH are the khaek and the farang influences. In the Thai language, these two terms are ambiguous because they are used to classify ‘Others’ in various ways. Khaek, for instance, is used to refer to South Asians, Middle Easterners, Persians, Indo-Malays, and most Asian Muslims. The term farang is an adaptation from the medieval Arabic frangi and is used by Thais to indicate ‘every white-skinned foreigner’. The culinary usage of the two terms by scholarships on dishes represented in the KHKKW is that khaek signifies Islamic influence with a Persian accent, while farang signifies Portuguese influences. Farang cultural influence, in the context of food, can also be attributed to those settlers of European descend and Eurasian, who retained European culinary heritage. Scholars have attributed the localization of ‘high’ culinary concoction to two sites: the Ayutthaya aristocratic milieu centered on the royal court, and the foreign settlements in Klong Bang Luang, Thonburi.\n\nConcerning the dishes attributed to farang in the KHKKW, most scholars have identified many of the dishes as originating in Ayutthaya. Sweet dishes in the KHKKW such as the thong yod, thong yip, and foi thong, is sometime collectively called khanom farang in the Thai culinary discourse. Lady Plian identified the concoction to be Portuguese and to have come from Portuguese traders. It was through these dishes, Lady Plian argued, that the European dessert cooking technique (using milk, butter, and egg, as well as the usage of the brick oven and European baking techniques), was localized. Furthermore, she reported that King Chulalongkorn (Rama V, r.1853-1910) encountered similar sweets on his sojourn to Portugal in 1897.\n\nHistorians Sansanee Verasinchai and Pramin Khruetong have attributed these culinary treats as emerging from the Portuguese settlement of Ayutthaya during the time of King Narai in the mid seventeenth century. The first farang to arrive in Siam were the Portuguese, who established an embassy to the court of Ayutthaya in 1511, following their capture of the port city of Malacca on the Malay peninsula. Prince Damrong wrote that a large number of Portuguese began to settle and build a trading station in Ayutthaya during the reign of King Chairacha (r.1534-1546) . The trade relation established between the Portuguese and Ayutthaya were soon followed by other similar arrangements with other farang – the Spanish, the Dutch, the English, the Danes and the French – throughout the sixteenth and the early seventeenth century. These early ‘European’ conjunctures brought not only new ingredients into Siam, but also new cooking techniques. The strongest link in this localization of culinary code is that between the Ayutthaya court and the Portuguese community of traders.\n\nIn terms of the sweet delicacies mentioned in the poem, historians have pointed to the Thai adaptation by a Catholic lady called Maria Pina de Guimar, who worked for King Narai (r.1656-1688) as Thao Thong Kip Ma, the sweet/snack maker of the King. Maria Guimar was of mixed Japanese, Portuguese, and Bengali ancestry. Historians believe that Guimar was born in Ayutthaya, a descendant of Yamada Nagamasa (1590-1630), a Japanese adventurer who advanced in the court of King Ekatotsarot (r.1605-1610) to become the ruler of Nakhon Si Thammarat, the largest Southern tributary town under the suzerainty of Ayutthaya. She was also the wife of Constantine Phaulkon, King Narai’s trusted chief adviser.\n\nThai scholar Pramin argues that because of Guimar’s Japanese ancestry, there are two possibilities for the dish’s provenance. Firstly, the culinary form could have been localized in the Portuguese and Japanese settlements in Ayutthaya. Another possibility is that it came from a ‘second-hand’ localization that had occurred in the sixteenth century in the Portuguese settlement in Nagasaki, and then came to Siam via the Japanese settlement in Ayutthaya. Regardless, the sweets are attributed to the Portuguese culinary code.\n\nLike the farang, the khaek or Islamic culinary code is linked to another seventeenth- century trade network, the Ayutthaya-Persia trade. Lady Plian classified five dishes in the KHKKW as being khaek: kaeng matsaman, khao buri luti, and muskot. Indeed, in the KHKKW, the first stanza reads: ‘matsaman curry is like a lover, as peppery and fragrant as the cumin seed. Its exciting allure would arouse any men. I am urged to seek its source’. Scholars have approached the khaek culinary legacy by hypothesizing the story of individual dishes through their names. Khao buri or buri rice, for instance, is linked to the word ‘Kabuli’, a culinary form of rice-based dish deriving from the city of Kabul and influenced by the Persian ‘Briyani’- a dish of roasted rice mixed with herbs famously localized across the Malay World. The Siamese variation, according to Lady Plian, uses butter, milk, clove, coriander, cardamom, and peppercorn. The sweet snack of muskot, its name deriving from the port city of Muscat in the Hormuz Strait, is also reputed to have arrived in Ayutthaya via the Persian trade, although some sources attribute it to the contacts with South Asian Muslims.\n\nThe story of kaeng matsaman, according to gourmet David Thomson is intertwined with the House of Bunnag. The house of Bunnag is a Thai aristocratic family descended from a Persian merchant, Sheikh Ahmad Qomi, native of Qom under the Safavid dynasty of Iran, who settled in Ayutthaya at the beginning of the seventeenth century. By the time of King Songtham (r.1611-1628), Sheikh Ahmad had risen to the position of Chao Krom Ta Kwa, literally ‘Lord of the Right Pier’, in charge of all seaborne trade traffic coming from the West to Ayutthaya. He also rose to the rank of Chularachamontri, the royal overseer of Muslims in Siam.\n\nIt is possible that Thompson attributes the kaeng matsaman to the Sheik because he was given its recipe by a member of the Bunnag family but his view is also echoed by Thai scholar Santi Sawetwimon. Santi even takes it further by arguing that the various Ayutthaya courts, because of their close relation with the Bunnag since the time of Sheik Achmad Qomi, employed many Persian and Indian Muslim cooks.\n\nHe supports his claim by pointing to the record of the Persian diplomat, Ibn Muhammad Ibrahim, who was part of an embassy sent by Shah Sulaiman of the Safavid (r. 1666-1694) to the court of King Narai. Wherever the concoction of kaeng matsaman took place, both Thomson and Santi point to Persia as its source, and the Bunnag in particular. The Bunnag, apart from being a very powerful family connected to various courts until the present time, plays an important role in culinary transmission, noticeably by the fact that Lady Plian herself was married to a Bunnag.\n\nBeyond seventeenth-century Ayutthaya’s aristocratic milieu, the farang and the khaek culinary codes were also transmitted to Siam from another site: communities that were situated next to each other in the vicinity of Klong Bang Luang in Thonburi. The Portuguese settlement is located in a Catholic neighborhood now called Kudi Chin, an area synonymous with khanom farang. The Portuguese began to settle in this area since establishing regular trade with Ayutthaya. Its population grew exponentially with Portuguese, Thais with Portuguese ancestry, and other Catholics escaping from the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767. The center of the present day community is the Santa Cruz Catholic Church, which was originally built in 1770. Thai scholar Sombat argues that the name of khanom farang such as tong yod, tong yip, and foi tong was only coined in Thai during the reign of King Buddha Yodfa Chulalok (Rama I, r.1782-1809), from various khanom farang available from Kudi Chin. This etymology, he argues, makes the Ayutthayan roots of these items, while still probable, questionable.\n\nRegarding the khaek culinary conjunctures, the Islamic community of Klong Bang Luang is centered on the seventeenth-century masjid Ton Son, which is now a Sunni Mosque. Originally populated by Persians and their Shitte converts, the area’s population also grew as a result of the Persian exodus out of Ayutthaya in 1767, and a new mosque, masjid Bang Luang, was built during this time. Many of the surviving Ayutthaya nobles close to the Bunnag family also settled in this area, noticeably Princess Bunrod, to whom the KHKKW was dedicated. Perhaps it was during this time that she picked up the various culinary traits along the confluence of waterways of Klong Bang Luang and the adjacent Kudi Chin.\n\nThis hypothesis is supported by Sombat’s argument that dishes like kaeng matsaman are actually local concoctions by local Islamic communities in Siam. This is because the word matsaman came from the Persian and Arabic musliman or ‘Muslim’, so that kaeng matsaman means simply the curry of the Muslim. The Persian/Shiite aristocrats, like the Bunnag, might have named the dish thus.\n\nToday, Klong Bang Luang is known as Yan Talat Khaek, or khaek market. Scholar San Sawewimon identifies the mixed immigration and emigration of various Islamic groups, from Shiite to Sunni, and other ethnicities that came to and left this area throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Further, scholar Prayurasak Chlaidecha points out the harmonious relation between Thai Shiite and Sunni in Bangkok during the three years they shared the Ton Son Mosque after the fall of Ayutthaya. According to him, the Sunni and Shiite in the Bangkok-Thonburi area practically lived together in this particular community. One of the reasons that led the Muslim to settle in this area, San argues, was the market selling Halal produce. From its Persian origin, the area was populated in the early twentieth century by Malay Sunnis from Pattani after the sultanate of Pattani was annexed by Siam in 1909. From the middle of the twentieth century until now, the area has been largely populated by Muslims from South Asia. The distinction of Islamic sects in Bangkok is probably less important in the making of a community, than their ethnic origin.\n\nOn whether the concoction of foreign influenced dishes in the KHKKW happened in Ayutthaya or in old settlements in Thonburi, this much is certain: the majority of these dishes are attributed to trade with the ‘west’, which began from the seventeenth century onwards, led by the Portuguese and Persian trade networks. These networks brought about cultural influences, religions and most importantly, people to settle on the Siamese shores, enabling further localizations and interactions. Further, Western seaborne conjunctures introduced a series of new crops such as papaya (malako) and various kinds of chili peppers (known in Thai as phrik tet) to Siam, as a result of a great historical event known as the Columbian Exchange. The legacy of these crops introduction is enormous since most Thai dishes today utilize American chili peppers.\n\nIn short, the Ayutthayan trade with the West can be seen as part of a larger economic conjuncture of the Indian Ocean trade system of the sixteenth to the middle of the eighteenth century. The dynastic transition in 1688 led to the decline of Siamese Western trade in terms of its importance to the crown as well as trade volume. Some have argued that this was part of the new ruling dynasty’s xenophobia, which led to a more ‘isolationistic’ foreign policy. Others, like Dhiravat na Pombejra, saw it as part of the a political transition which realigned of trade, particularly with the Chinese and other non-European partners, helped the post-1688 rulers consolidated their power. The issue of administrative decline, Dhiravat argues, has to be analyzed separately from the realm of culture. In this regard, the culinary conjunctures that had taken roots from the sixteenth century onwards made a lasting impact upon Siamese society and its royal court in spite of later political development.\n\nEastern Seaborne Culinary Conjunctures\n\nThe eastern seaborne culinary conjuncture, or the chin conjuncture, is the food influence that came to Siam from China. Being in close proximity to Siam, the seaborne trade with China is a much older culinary conjuncture, stretching back to the thirteenth and fourteenth century. By the fifteenth century, Ayutthaya had become a crossroad between the Chinese and the Indian Ocean trade systems. Because of this historical link, many of the Thai cooking methods have been adopted from the Chinese. Thai vernacular kitchen utensils, such as the anglo or terracotta brazier, the krata kon luek or wok, and taliw or spatula, as well as the technique of phat or stir- fry, have all been localized from Chinese culinary practice, in particular the Hokkien dialect group. Even the Thai word gaeng (curry) is believed to be of Chinese origin because of its similarity to the word used in various Southern Chinese dialects. These culinary influences possibly were introduced during the Ayutthaya period or an even earlier stage due to the contacts the Thais had with Chinese culture.\n\nThe chin communities in Siam can be divided according to their dialect differences, signifying their point of origin from the southern part of China. In Siam there were five groups of chin settlers based on their dialect: Hokkien, Teochew, Hainanese, Cantonese, and Hakka. In this discussion of culinary conjuncture, the chin conjunctures can be divided into two strands according to their influences: one dominated by the Hokkien from the fifteenth century onwards, and another by the Teochew, a strand which is interwoven with the rise of Bangkok in the nineteenth century.\n\nFrom the early 1400s, the Hokkien had dominated the Chinese trading networks that linked Ming China with Ayutthaya. Trade networks had been formally established since the voyage of Admiral Cheng Ho, who visited Ayutthaya in 1408. Historian Pimprapai points out that Prince Nakorn Inn, who later became king of Ayutthaya in 1409 (King Nakharinthara Thirat, r. 1409-1424), visited the Ming Imperial court in Beijing in 1377, a fact that shows how the relations between the Ming court and Ayutthaya flourished during that time.\n\nAfter the fall of the Ming Dynasty and the rise of the Qing (Manchu) in 1644, a large number of Hokkien Chinese fled the Middle Kingdom and joined the Hokkien community in Ayutthaya. Many Hokkien merchants were ennobled by the Ayutthaya Kings during those times, and a network of alliances was established between the Thai court and the Hokkien community. The Chinese foodway was certainly distinctive. The Talad Chin or Chinese market in Ayutthaya was unique in that it offered meats that were not available in other markets. The seventeenth century French diplomat to the court of King Narai, Simon de la Loubère (1642-1729), observed that the Chinese can eat anything, ‘even cats, dogs, horses, asses, and mules’.\n\nThis link between the Hokkien community and the Ayutthaya court, nevertheless, was not as strong as the link between the nobles and the farang and the khaek. At the height of Ayutthaya’s fortunes as a trade entrepôt during the ‘Age of Commerce’, the attention of the court lay with the trade networks of the Indian Ocean rather than trade with the East. Historian Pimprapai stresses this uneven attention by arguing that while the rise of the House of Bunnag was well-documented, there were no substantial records of the ‘Left Pier’ who was in charge of the trade with the East. While the office of Chodikrachasethi, the noble position of the chin as royal overseer of the Chinese community equivalent to the Chularachamontri for the khaek, was created, the degree of importance was different. The noble rank of Chao Phraya (Lord) was given to all Chularachamontri from its creation, whereas the Chodikrachasethi was only granted the rank of Luang (lesser lord), a less senior status in the Siamese court. This unevenness in rank signified the court of Ayutthaya fixation with Western trade during the ‘Age of Commerce’, the fixation that was only transformed after its fall in 1767.\n\nThis unevenness of the royal court’s attention to trade with China during the ‘Age of Commerce’ nevertheless does not reflect continued Chinese migration into Siam. According to W.G. Skinner, the Sino-Thai trade since the beginning of the fifteenth century grew and flourished in the form of private trade up to the fall of Ayutthaya. Despite a brief disruption in the 1620’s, or the inauguration of the royal monopoly in 1629, the Chinese private traders were well established and flourished across Siam. Unaffected by the isolationistic turn in foreign policy due to dynastic transition in 1688, the Chinese trade during this time expanded, largely by incorporating the European share of Siam’s Eastern trade.\n\nSkinner argues that the reason why the Chinese thrived during Siam’s isolationism was due to the fact that they ‘were never considered foreigners by the Thai’.\n\nPerhaps it is more apt to say that Chinese have interacted with the Thai for a very long period of time and that the Thais, like many other ethnic groups in mainland Southeast Asia, have been influenced by Chinese culture for centuries, thus making things Chinese less ‘foreign’. As an ethnic group that conducted seaborne trade, the Chinese position in Siam was unique in comparison to others. Because of this, the uneven attention they received by the Ayutthaya court in contrast to farang and khaek does not reflect their cultural impact on the Siamese cultural landscape. The influences that the chin dialect groups have, particularly the contrast between the Hokkien and the Teochew, need to be further examined.\n\nThroughout the course of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, there was also a steady migration of Teochew Chinese to Siam. Unlike the Hokkien, who enjoyed favor from the Ayutthaya court, the Teochew community in Ayutthaya was located in the disreputable port area of Ban Suan Plu, outside the city walls. Apart from Ayutthaya, Pimprapai traced the Teochew migration during this period and pointed out that most of the Teochew settled along the east coast of Siam during this time in places like Cha Cheong Sao, Bang Pra Kong River delta, Bang Pla Soi, Koh Kong, Bang La Mung, and Chan Tra Boon River Delta (Chantaburi). It was there that the Teochew thrived on farming. The planting of crops like peppercorn, cardamon, and eagle wood that were synonymous with the area is attributed to the Teochew settlers. From there, the Teochew traded with both Ayutthaya and Khmer coastal towns along the Gulf of Siam.\n\nThe turning point for the Teochew community in Siam came with the fall of Ayutthaya in 1767 and the subsequent rise of King Taksin, whose father was a Teochew tax collector. Historian Edward Van Roy points out that the legendary flight of Phraya Tak (King Taksin) from beleaguered Ayutthaya followed the path of Teochew migration to the east coast of Siam to the towns of Chonburi, Rayong, and Chathaburi. The Ayutthaya Teochew escaped the war by land to join their communities along the east coast of Siam, while the Hokkien left the capital by their junks and sailed south to places like Surat, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Songkhla, all traditional Siamese settlements under the Ayutthayan tributary system.\n\nAccording to Nidhi, the political landscape during the post-1767 Siamese revival can be understood in terms of King Taksin’s newfound support received from the Teochew, and the lack of support from the old Ayutthayan Hokkien. Nidhi explains that some of these Hokkien have enjoyed favors from the old Ayutthayan political system, and some even rose to prominent positions, and thus were not keen on the way King Taksin bestowed royal favors towards the Teochew. Prominent Hokkien descendants, like the ruler of Songkhla for example, turned to support Phraya Chakri’s faction when King Taksin was overthrown. After establishing Thonburi as his royal capital, King Taksin honoured his alliance with the Teochew by giving them land on the east bank of the Chaophraya River, opposite his Thonburi palace. During this time, many Teochew families rose to prominence through the favor they enjoyed from Taksin’s court. King Taksin encouraged more Teochew migration from China to Siam to revive the economy. Many of the older Teochew settlers on the Siamese east coast also moved to the new settlement allocated by King Taksin on the east bank of the Chaophraya during this period. The Hokkien- Teochew divide can still be seen in the physical landscape of Bangkok-Thonburi today. Most old Hokkien temples are located in Thonburi, whereas most of the old Teochew temples are on Koh Rattankosin, in Bangkok.\n\nThe subsequent regime change brought about by Rama I reversed the Teochews’ fortune. In his bid to ‘rebuild a new Ayutthaya’, Rama I brought back the aristocracy- Hokkien alliance of the old order. With the new Chakri ruler, the site of the new royal palace was chosen to be a Teochew settlement on the east bank of the Chaophraya, thus forcing the Teochew settlers, who numbered around five Thousand to move to the port area of Sampeng. The trade policy of King Taksin, though, was not reversed, and Chinese and Teochew immigrants in particular continued to flow into the new capital of Bangkok. It was not until the time of Rama IV that the court again turned its attention to the West, notably due to the threat from Western imperialism. The rise of Thonburi and Bangkok from late eighteenth century up until the Bowring treaty in 1855 was owed mostly to the Chinese junk trade and migrants.\n\nThe KHKKW reflects the attitude of the Ayutthayan aristocracy of favoring the West over Siam’s Eastern relations. Only one dish was classified as chin by Lady Plian, and it was the gaeng chued rang nok or Birds’ nest soup, although persimmon fruit, which the Thai call plab chin, was also included. If one returns to the metaphor that the poem was a ‘window into Princess Bunrod’s kitchen’, the inclusion of only one dish is a surprising revelation. This is because Princess Bunrod’s father, Chao Khrue Ngoen, was a prominent Hokkien trader in the court of Ayutthaya. Perhaps the simple explanation is that she learnt to cook from her Thai mother, Princess Sri Sudarak (c.1739-1799), rather than her Chinese father. Or perhaps this is just another example of the nature of cultural assimilation, in culinary terms at least, between the Thai, the Chinese, and all the other urban dwellers during that time.\n\nIn terms of the dish, the choice of birds’ nest soup is also interesting since the harvesting of birds’ nests, was a form of ‘revenue farming’ that required the crown’s permission. Most of the notable birds’ nest harvesters at the time of early Bangkok were Hokkien Chinese. This may reflect the Hokkien role in the court culinary concoction. Nevertheless, it still a minimal role compared to the Western conjunctures of khaek and farang. The importance of the Chinese conjunctures only came after the age of Rama II. In the dissection of the KHKKW, Lady Plian added seven more stenzas to Rama II’s original poem to include seven more dishes from the Chinese repertoire. The confluence of the Chinese conjuncture with the ‘high’ culinary code of the Thai will be discussed in subsequent chapters.\n\nHinterland Culinary Conjunctures\n\nThe Braudelian approach of conjuncture has so far provided a picture of various culinary codes localized through seaborne interactions. Taking this methodology beyond the KHKKW to analyze the Thai culinary code, a culinary constant is revealed: the interaction between Thai muang and its hinterland. The hinterland culinary influence is less obvious than the seaborne conjuncture because it reflected a longer time span in culinary localization and it relies mostly on the basic ingredients of different regions, which are largely ignored in the historical record. This culinary constant represents a Thai culinary ‘low’.\n\nScholars have been forced to use language, archeological finds, and calculated guesses to locate the culinary constant. Various Thai lexical and culinary adaptations from older civilizations, like the Khmer or the Mon, are revealed in language. For example, the Thai word for snack (khanom) is derived from an old Khmer word, which bears close resemblance to other neighboring languages like Lao.\n\nThe hinterland culinary constant largely reaffirmed the Thai cultural affiliation with, to borrow Peleggi’s terminology, the Indic or Theravada oecumene.\n\nGoing back to Sombat’s identification of the vernacular culinary code, the food of the chao chonabot or rural people, stands in contrast to his idea that the Thai muang is the place where a more complicated culinary concoction occurs. Sombat further argues that while the complicated codes are formulated in the muang, the ‘popular’ diet, consisting of rice, fish, nam phrik and its accompaniment, did not change much for ordinary people who migrated to the town from the countryside.\n\nSurviving the test of time, a common expression like kin khao kin pla, literally ‘eat rice eat fish’, is still used both as a reference to food and a form of greeting in contemporary Thai culture, reflecting this culinary constant.\n\nThe meal of chao chonabot can then be classified as the ‘low’ culinary code that was not restricted to the rural diet, but was also the staple among the urban vernacular diet. In Thai culture, the representation of ‘rice’ and ‘fish’ possessed social potency. It symbolized the prosperity and abundance of the land, as well as the staple foundation of the Thai diet. The correlation between the vernacular staple of rice and fish with the land of the Thais comes from its mention in the thirteenth-century stone inscription of King Ramkhamhang of Sukhothai (1279-1298). The inscription’s famous line, ‘there is fish in the rivers, there is rice in the fields’, was arguably made popular in the 1950s by Luang Wichit Wathakan’s (1898-1962) nationalist song, rather than the inscription itself.\n\nThe association between rice and fish with the abundance of the land had a cultural currency long before the age of nationalism. It has long existed, argues Thaweethong Hongwiwat, in the Thai language and in various poetic expressions.\n\nThe connection between the vernacular diet and the land conceptualized in the language reveals the historical roots of the ‘popular’ culinary form.\n\nBesides the staple of rice and fish, there is nam phrik, a chili paste, the most basic staple of Thai diets from all regions. The modern Thai culinary repertoire has identified over one hundred different variations.\n\nGourmet David Thompson identifies nam phrik as the ‘most ancient style of Thai dish’, with basic ingredients combined by using ‘the primitive crucible’ of pestle and mortar.\n\nThompson argues that the popular ingredient of thua nao, or fermented soybeans, popularly used in some nam phrik especially in the Lanna and Lao culinary codes suggests that nam phrik could have possibly come to the Thai culinary universe from China.\n\nInstead, the renowned monk Buddhadasa Bhikkhu attributed nam phrik to the localization of old Indian forms, coming perhaps since the spread of Theravada Buddhism into mainland Southeast Asia.\n\nThis explains why in the modern Thai culinary repertoire, there are nam phrik with names like Nam Phrik Phama (Burmese nam phrik), Nam Phrik Karen (Karen nam phrik), and even Nam Phrik Singapore (Singaporean nam phrik).\n\nThe last example reflects the fluid usage of the word nam phrik in naming various kinds of chili paste according their regional affiliation.\n\nTravelers to Siam in the nineteenth century all observed the Siamese basic diet composed of rice and fish. Their observations form sketches of the nature of the urban vernacular culinary code of Bangkok of that time. The American Reverend Noah A. McDonald (1830-1897), who came to Siam as a Protestant missionary from 1860 until 1886, observed this culinary practice and suggested that the simple diet of rice and fish was due to religious beliefs. Sir John Bowring (1792-1872), the British Ambassador to the court of Rama IV in 1855 also observed the Siamese ‘popular’ diet of rice and nam phrik. Bowring’s observation highlights the element of class distinction in the basic diet, noticeably in his description of the Siamese consumption of rice. ‘Rice’ he remarked, ‘is used by the poor as the main aliment of life; by the opulent as an accompaniment to their meals, as bread in Europe’.\n\nIn the same period, Anna Leonowens (1831-1915), the famed English governess to the court of King Mongkut, also described a ‘popular’ fish commonly consumed by the Thais in Bangkok. She identified the plathu, which she thought was a kind of sardine, as a staple of the Siamese diet. She observed: ‘The stream is rich in fish of excellent quality and flavor, such as is found in most of the great rivers of Asia; and is especially noted for its plathu, a kind of sardine, so abundant and cheap that it forms a common seasoning to the laborer’s bowl of rice. The Siamese are experts in modes of drying and salting fish of all kinds, and large quantities are exported annually to Java, Sumatra, Malacca, and China’. The plathu remains until today the ‘popular’ fish eaten by Thais of the Central Plain.\n\nThe picture of constant conjuncture is reaffirmed by the earliest known foreign record of the Thai ‘popular’ culinary code. The most famous of these was the seventeenth- century account from la Loubère. During his time in Ayutthaya, la Loubère not only observed that the basic diet of the Siamese was rice and fish, but he also provided a recipe for nam phrik. He wrote about nam phrik in detail by first describing it as ‘the common sauce accompaniment to the Siamese meal’. This sauce is ‘plain, like adding water with some spices, garlic, chibols (type of onion), and sometime with Baulm’, and incorporated with ‘a mustard like sauce, which consisted of Cray Fish corrupted (fermented fish); which they called krapi’. What la Loubère described was a basic variation of nam phrik, possibly a common recipe collected during his embassy to Ayutthaya.\n\nPrine Narathip (1861-1931), who first translated la Loubère’s text into Thai, made an interesting remark in brackets after this section stating that ‘la Loubère’s nam phrik was probably not tasty (mai aroi) because it lacks sugar, lime juice, fish sauce, and too much use of chibols’. The Thai translator’s remark on a translation reveals the potent connection between flavor, as created through ingredients, and the general understanding of this particular Thai dish, despite the two centuries time gap between the original text, written in 1691, and the Thai translation, done in 1908.\n\nPrince Narathip’s remark also reveals two dynamics at work in the Thai culinary landscape. Firstly, it shows the unchanged culinary ‘form’. The culinary matrix of nam phrik is automatically recognized two centuries later through simple description of its ingredients. Secondly, it reveals the pace of change in the cooking process of the nam phrik. Prince Narathip’s suggestion of adding ingredients perhaps corresponds to the culinary trend of the Prince’s own times. It could also represent, to use Mintz terminology, the ‘bowdlerization’ of nam phrik in the way early twentieth- century Bangkok absorbed and altered the seventeenth-century Ayutthaya version of nam phrik learnt by la Loubère. Regardless of the change, the fact that Prince Narathip recognized la Loubère’s description reveals the historical constant of the culinary form conceptually.\n\nThis conceptual relationship of the culinary form, nam phrik, to its actual variations in different historical contexts and urban settings reveals another aspect of the analysis of ‘cuisine’: the distance between the language describing the culinary code, and the actual dishes prepared in the kitchen. This distance also represents the cultural gap between the ‘popular’ dish, qualified by regional and ingredient constraint, and the ‘high’ invention of the urban center. This issue of the culinary language will be explored in the following chapter.\n\nThis chapter has tried to portray the formulation of a distinctive Thai kitchen, using Braudelian concepts and the KHKKW. Whether one believes that the culinary repertoire in the poem came from the court of Ayutthaya, or that it came from the confluence of culinary traits along Thonburi’s Klong Bang Luang, the KHKKW itself has become the text to which the present day Thai culinary code subscribes. The first theory can also be attributed to the fact that the Chakri family was close to the majority of the ‘foreign’ aristocrats of Ayutthaya through intermarriage. Thus, the\n\nculinary repertoire might have come from the Chakri’s family kitchen. The second theory attributes the food repertoire in the KHKKW to the confluence of cultures in the early settlement of Thonburi. In a way, Rama II and Princess Bunrod were the first Thai gastronomes in ‘describing a world in which eating was not a biological imperative, but an artistic passion’. From this perspective, the KHKKW, I would argue, represents the first Thai gastronomic record, the first Thai text that initiates the public culture of good eating. Here, the idealized Thai kitchen was first articulated, and the king and his queen were its gourmets.\n\nEstablishing the Thai Culinary Language: Cultivating the Self and Others and the Birth of the Thai Cookbook\n\nThe birth of the Thai cookbook made possible the public discussion and transmission of Thai culinary knowledge. Prior to this, culinary knowledge was transmitted orally in the setting of private cultural space. Lady Plian’s MKHP was the first Thai cookbook that was published in an era that can be call the age of siwilai. Historian Thongchai Winichakul has defined siwilai in the context of Western Imperialist threat as ‘an attempt originated among the elite, later including urban intellectuals, to attain and confirm the relative superiority of Siam’. As a traditional regional power, Thongchai explains, Siam was anxious about its position among modern nations. Peleggi attributes this process of siwilai to the way the Thai royal elite ‘re-fashioned’ themselves, ‘both as individuals and as a social group, vis-à-vis their aspiration to status and authority in the late nineteenth-century globalized arena’. In short, the Siamese elite during the time of Lady Plian aspired to be part of the modern European world order.\n\nIn the culinary realm, the ‘re-fashioning’ of the Thai Self expressed in the MKHP came about through the gradual cultivation of culinary Self-awareness; a process that happened long before Lady Plian published her book. The chapter traced this gradual process by looking at a variety of sources, including fiction, memoirs, and travels literature. The first part looks at the legacy of the KHKKW and the way Rama II conceptualized the Siamese culinary code. The second part looks at the transformation of the Siamese culinary worldview over the course of the nineteenth- century, locating the Bowring Treaty of 1855 as the rupture that shifted the Siamese understanding of Self and Others. The last part examines the birth of the Thai cookbook and the establishment of Thai culinary language.\n\nThe Legacy of the KHKKW\n\nThe culinary knowledge reflected in the KHKKW represents Rama II’s role as the collector of diverse culinary codes, the royal court’s role as the center of culinary culture, and cosmopolitan Siamese urban subjects as the repository of that culture. In order to understand the legacy of the KHKKW, the process of negotiation between the center of the culinary culture and the repository must firstly be analyzed. This is because this process of negotiation established a platform for the construction of Thai culinary language a century later. The approaches from two case studies of early nineteenth-century French culinary culture, conducted by Priscilla Ferguson and Julia Scergo, are applicable in understanding the legacy of the KHKKW.\n\nFerguson and Scergo have independently identified the construction of a cohesive French culinary language, used to communicate both Parisian and regional culinary codes, as a product of the French revolution of 1789 and the urbanization of Paris after its wake. Csergo argues that during this time, the regional cuisine was ‘reconstructed’ to allow modern urban society to ‘resurrect its provincial roots by savoring dishes consecrated by memory’. Ferguson classifies the new restaurant culture of Paris, resulting from post revolution urbanization, as responsible for creating a modern French culinary identity. In her words, ‘the pantheon that speaks for the country speaks from the center’. Nineteenth-century Paris, Ferguson argues, supplied ‘the template of French culinary civilization’. Both scholars argue that it was the gastronomic language formed in Paris, the center of French society, during the course of the nineteenth century that was exported throughout the country and defined the overall culinary landscape of France, subsuming even the regional culinary tradition.\n\nTo some extent, the same could be said about Bangkok in the way it dominate and symbolized ‘Thai’ cuisine. This domination was centered on the sociological space of the royal court. The royal court made up for the lack of restaurant culture, in comparison to the Paris example, by assuming the role of ‘culinary pantheon’ in creating a coherent food repertoire, as reflected by the KHKKW, from the diverse foodway of Siam. As the royal page chanted out the KHKKW during the barge procession, the variety of dishes from the boat song reminded the residences along the two banks of the Chaophraya about how their diversity, and how they came to live in harmony together as a community. In this sense, the assimilation of food was very much a part of the state building.\n\nThe KHKKW also revealed the cosmopolitan reach of the King. It functions as a site of memory (lieu de mémoire) linking Bangkok with the heydays of Ayutthaya. The Bangkok audience of the poem was reminded of the way Thai royal power had harmoniously ruled the ethnic diversity of Siam through the assimilation of culinary forms, and the way the court had served as a site of cultural confluence. Only decades from the fall of Ayutthaya and the turmoil of the Thonburi reign, here was a song that not only represented diversity, but told people that their new home of Bangkok would be as harmonious and prosperous as Ayutthaya through celebrating their diverse kitchens. Not unlike the birth of the French culinary identity, the poem here could signify the Thai court as a center speaking out to the diverse population of Bangkok, and expounding on the cohesion of the new Thai state through the language of food and love.\n\nIt must also be mentioned that Rama II enjoys the fame of ‘artist king’ in the official Chakri historiography. His reign is remembered in the official historiography for the revival of the ‘high culture of the Ayutthaya court. The culinary repertoire was a reflection of this cultural revival. While the origin of these dishes was questioned in the previous chapter, the repertoire itself is a reflection of the court’s ‘high’ culinary culture. The culinary menu of elaborate dishes and the diversity of it sources reflected Rama II’s desire to represent the culinary power of the Bangkok court, a culinary power that could rival the most elaborate court of Ayutthaya. This chapter looks at the shifting Siamese mentality in identifying the ‘Self’ and ‘Others’ in order to understand food assimilation through the 19th Century.\n\nThe Siamese Culinary Occidentalism\n\nThe formation of Bangkok took place amidst a new global economic reality that forced the Chakri court to redefine Siam’s place in the world. This new economic reality was a result of the gradual European eastward conquests that had started since the middle of the eighteenth century and had become widespread after the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. This new world-system shifted Bangkok’s international relations and simultaneously transformed their sense of Self. During this period, the most important Other was the farang, particularly the British. Throughout the nineteenth-century, the Siamese collective imagination of the Other transformed after the signing of the Bowring Treaty in 1855. These two phases shall now be examined.\n\nThe First Phase of Siamese Occidentalism: Siam before the Bowring Treaty\n\nThe cultural Other of farang shifted from the Ayutthayan perception to a new outlook. In the old perception, the farang were seen as ‘movers, travelers, and intruders into the Oriental Land, while the Siamese were primarily stationed at home and prepared to deal with farang from their cultural base’. By the mid-nineteenth century, this perception began to change dramatically as the farang were not just ‘movers and intruders’ that came to the ‘stationary’ Siamese cultural base. Now, the Siamese themselves had to contemplate venturing out into the new world order made by the farang in order to secure their home. The concern from the farang threat was articulated by King Nangklao (Rama III, r. 1824-1851) on his deathbed in 1851 when he reportedly said: ‘There will be no more wars with Vietnam and Burma. We will have them only with the West’.\n\nSince the foundation of Bangkok as Siam royal capital, the gradual process of European eastward conquests did not go unnoticed by the Siamese court; the British in particular stood out. One by one, the British swallowed up old trade entrepôts across the old Indian Ocean networks, starting from India since the middle of the eighteen century and then Ceylon (Srik Lanka) in 1796. The British were right at the Siamese doorstep by the early nineteenth century, with the British East India Company establishing the Straits Settlement in 1826. As the British Empire in the east was beginning to take shape, Lord Francis Rawdon-Hasting (1754-1826), the then British governor of India, dispatched John Crawfurd to the court of Rama II in 1822 In the realm of food, Crawfurd observed that the meal prepared and served him was ‘a mix of Siamese and European food’.\n\nThe culinary Other based on the threat of European Imperialism was being formulated in the Thai literary work of Sunthorn Phu (1786-1855) that came out of the court circle during this time. The culinary Occidentalism first appeared in Sunthorn Phu’s picaresque epic, Phra Apai Mani, an adventure tale set in the imagined geography of the Indian Ocean. Parts of the story followed the journey of Phra Apai Mani, the Rattanakosin hero, who battled with his foes across the sea. These villains are the thamin and jon surang, based in Lanka or Sri Lanka. The term thamin is used to refer to Southern Indian ethnic group, Tamil, but it is also used to denote savages and barbarity. This was probably influenced by the early Bangkok court’s localization of the Sanskrit epic, Ramayana, where the primary antagonist, Ravana (Thotsakan) came from Southern India. As for Jon surang or ‘surang’ thief, historian believed that it is a portrait of the English (possibly derived from the word farang).\n\nA Thai scholar believes that Sunthorn Phu began working on the composition from 1833 to 1845, and the story itself was based on the first Anglo-Burmese war in 1823-1826. Further, the ruler of Lanka was a woman, Nang Lewong, a character which historian believes to have been based on Queen Victoria (r.1837-1901). Regardless of the literary interpretation linking the villain of Pra Apai Mani to Britain, what Sunthorn Phu represented in his epic story was the Other from a Siamese point of view.\n\nThe Klong tang phasa (Poem on Various Languages) was a poetic depiction of thirty- two ‘foreigners’ known to the Siamese. It was inscribed within the Wat Phra Chetuphon sometime during the reign of Rama III, between 1824-1851. Scholars Davisakd Puaksom and Suchit Wongtet link Sunthorn Phu Pra Apai Mani to the Klong tang phasa and argue that the two literary works represented the construction of ‘Otherness’ among the Siamese elite between the reigns of Rama II and Rama III. Davisakd argues that the Klong tang phasa was one of the earliest manifestations of ‘Siamese Occidentalism’, which the Bangkok elite composed in order to maintain its cultural superiority, comparable to the Other it has constructed. Similar to Edward Said’s ‘Orientalism’, the logic behind the Siamese construction of the Other was inspired by a ‘cultural hegemonic self’.\n\nI would argue that the construction of ‘otherness’ during this period was a response to the increased threat of European colonialism on the one hand, and the desire of the Bangkok elite to establish its place in the world on the other hand. That is why the ‘others’ depicted in Klong tang phasa were dominated by the various categories of khaek and farang, the familiar foreigners of Ayutthaya. In this sense, the Klong tang phasa represented the early Bangkok elite’s desire to establish Bangkok’s place in the world in the same way that Ayutthaya once occupied. As the new Indian Ocean trade system changed, the elites of Bangkok continued to look westward in a desire to reclaim Ayutthaya’s place as a major maritime entrepôt of the region.\n\nIn the culinary realm, the Phra Apai Mani depicts the various diets of the Other as the binary opposite to the Thai diet. For instance, the thamin is depicted as the Other who does not eat rice but fish, elephants, horses, and all kinds of animals and birds.\n\nTheir ‘Otherness’ is also manifested in the way these thamin ‘kill their game with The farang, on the other hand, is represented in the story as the ruler of Lanka. The hero, Phra Apai Mani is admitted into the city as the guest of its ruler, Nang Lewong, and is served a mixed variety of dishes accompanied with rice, compatible to the Siamese diet which mixed the khaek-influence dishes, like panang and gaeng ped (duck curry), with the chin-influence dishes, like mu han (suckling pig) with its vinegar dip. As a European touch, ‘brandy made of grape’ is served to Phra Apai Mani at the end of the meal. The stark contrast between the farang ruler of Lanka and the thamin illustrated the Siamese worldview of culinary Others to be organized around power as imagined by Sunthorn Phu. The ruler of Lanka stands on equal terms with the Rattankosin’s hero, whereas the raw-food-eating thamin is ‘exoticized’ through what the Sunthorn Phu imagined to be the reverse of the Siamese diet.\n\nknives and then mix their killings in blood, vinegar, and fish sauce, and then consume it raw’. According to Sunthorn Phu, this culinary practice gave the thamin extraordinary strength. Sunthorn Phu further depicted the thamin dressing like farang. The lifestyle of the thamin also reflected the Siamese worldview of the ‘Others’ in the Indian Ocean network because ‘they make a living through trade, and do not do farming or rice growing of their own’.\n\nThe Second Phase of Siamese Occidentalism: Siam after the Bowring Treaty\n\nThe turning point for the Siamese collective imagination of the Other came about from the middle of the Nineteenth Century. It was during this time that Western Powers were imposing their military powers to open up more trade, and eventually colonized more territory for their respective empires. According to Prince Damrong, Rama IV and many Siamese aristocrats were fully aware of the gravity of Western gunboat diplomacy in Asia, which resulted in unequal treaties like the Treaty of Nanking between China and Britain (1842), or the Convention of Kanagawa (1854) between Japan and the United States, long before Bowring arrived in Siam. In this historical context, the Bowring Treaty (1855) conducted between Sir John Bowring,\n\nQueen Victoria’s emissary, and Rama IV, was far from equal. The demands imposed upon the Siamese court by Bowring, like the elimination of royal trade monopoly and the granting of extraterritoriality to British subjects, have an immense impact in transforming the Siamese governmental and financial structure, as well as a major alteration in the Siamese elites’ idea about themselves. Similar treaties were conducted by other Western powers in subsequent years. This new political landscape, some scholars argue, made the Siamese elite become more self-critical by comparing themselves culturally to the West.\n\nThe abolition of the royal trade monopoly resulted in the exponential growth of Chinese businesses in Bangkok over the second half of the century. Initially, the trade liberalization introduced by Bowring challenged the commercial dominance enjoyed by the Chinese. The power of the Chinese trade monopolists, amongst whom the Hokkien featured prominently, went into a state of decline at first.\n\nNevertheless, by the expanding the market, the monopolists ended up benefiting from their revenue farms at a far greater aggregated value. With the Europeans soon realizing their lack of necessary connection and knowledge of the Siamese market, they consolidated their position by co-opting the Chinese mercantile network inside the country as well as the one that connects Bangkok with other Asian port cities, like Singapore and Hong Kong. Skinner argues that the European domination of the Siamese market was, in actuality, an injection of European capital into the existing Chinese trading networks.\n\nThe foreign investment made the Chinese into a leading commercial class, particularly the retailers, merchants, business middleman and bankers connected with Western commercial interests. Many of this new commercial class joined the ranks of the old Chinese merchant lords (Chao Sua) in the society’s upper strata.\n\nCommercial opportunities also led to an influx of Chinese migration and according to one European observer, Bangkok in 1900 resembled many characteristics of other Chinese dominated port cities in the region. During this time, the Siamese economy became more dependent on the food and agricultural industries dominated by the Chinese.\n\nDependency on the Chinese became apparent on 1 June 1910; the Chinese community in Bangkok staged a general strike that paralyzed many businesses in the capital and made food produce scarce and very expensive. This came about because of the Chinese were dissatisfied with the head tax, introduced in 1909. This event intensified the Thais’ ill feeling towards the Chinese. This sentiment was best manifested by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI, r.1910-1925), who portrays the Chinese as disloyal economic parasites in a work published in 1913 titled ‘Jews of the Orient’\n\n(Phuak Yiw Haeng Burapha Thit). By designating the Chinese as the Other, Rama VI’s sentiment was utilized by Thai nationalists of the 1930s and 1940s. The implication that the anti-Chinese attitude had on the Thai culinary discourse shall be discussed in the following chapter. In terms of the Siamese ‘high’ culinary code, the anti-Chinese sentiment did not make an impact on the Thai court’s incorporation of Chinese dishes. It could also be suggested that the Siamese elite identified Chinese cuisine, not with the chin immigrant population in Siam, but rather with China as a culture. This incorporation of Chinese dishes is reflected in the MKHP, where Lady Plian added seven more dishes into the royal culinary repertoire.\n\nThe demand of extraterritoriality to foreign subjects from Bowring and subsequent Western powers altered the Siamese elites’ idea about themselves, their ‘foreign’ subjects, and their place in the world. While this legal privilege was not a new thing in Siam; during the reign of King Narai in seventeenth century Ayutthaya, extraterritoriality status was granted to Dutch and French traders. The historical context of the nineteenth century relationships between Siam and various Imperial powers though, was very different from the time of King Narai. For one, the Imperial powers were no longer establishing small trade factories in the Siamese towns as during the Ayutthaya period. Rather, the Imperial powers were expanding their influence into the hinterland across the Asian region, and in some cases, took total control of local government apparatuses.\n\nIn the realm of culture and collective imagination, the Others were no longer imaginatively portrayed on the murals walls of Wat Phra Chetuphon, or as characters in Sunthorn Phu’s celebrated story, but became new judicially powerful figures with real presence in the social life of mid-nineteenth-century Bangkok. By the reign of King Chulalongkorn, a new dimension was added to this extraterritoriality: the colonial subjects of Europeans that arrived in Bangkok in search of job\n\nopportunities. Superficially, this new legal dimension of extraterritoriality created a great deal of irritation among the Siamese ruling class when the chin and khaek merchants and began to claim English or French protégé status.\n\nMore profoundly, the extraterritoriality, among other unequal treatments of Siam by Western powers, signified that Siam was a ‘barbarous’ country, and the Siamese elite must become like the West in order to be treated as equal. The anxiety created from extraterritoriality was not felt by the Siamese elite at its onset simply because Western community in Siam were quite small in number. It was only in 1890s, as historian Tamara Loos points out, that extraterritoriality became a problem when the Asian colonial subjects, like the Chinese, Cambodian, Burman, Javanese, Laotian, and even some Siamese, claimed extraterritoriality status. They were able to do this either because they were employed by foreigners or were a colonial subject to foreign powers with treaty protection, or had illegally purchased their extraterritorial status on the black market.\n\nIn a sense, extraterritoriality law, among many other forms of uneven interactions between Siam and the West, replaced the relationship between the Siamese elite had with its Others, and put in place a clear legal hierarchy that placed the West as a benchmark of superiority. The only way the Siamese elite could address this unevenness was to become like the West, and in turn transform its relationship with other non-Western Others as well. From the days of Bowring onwards, Otherness in terms of cultural roots became a yardstick in the construction of a Thai identity, along with the manufacturing of social hierarchical structure in the Thai mindset that was comparable to the mid-Nineteenth Century Western framework. The Siamese elite, from the Monarch, its aristocracy, and the educated commoners, became very self- critical from this period onwards. Their interactions with the Others were no longer about pure assimilation of values and techniques, but also about cultivating their own sense of superiority in order to be placed among the elite of the civilized world.\n\nIn the culinary repertoire, this new sense of ‘Otherness’ is reflected in Lady Plian’s dissection of KHKKW. The poem that had been composed as a coherent repertoire, arranged along culinary categories (savory dishes, fruits, and sweets) now became a new object for Lady Plian’s examination and explanation. The emergence of khaek, chin, and to a lesser extent farang culinary definitions in Lady Plian’s cookbook could also be viewed within the context of siwilai. The world order of the late nineteenth century, historian Thongchai argues, was very disruptive for the Siamese elite. The quest for siwilai was an attempt by the Siamese elite to ‘locate their position in the new world order’, and ‘to avoid the disgrace of inferiority for being less civilized’. The new reality of the mid-Nineteenth century had forced the Siamese elite to define its sense of ‘self’ within the European cultural hegemony.\n\nIn the realm of food culture, the new sense of ‘Self’ was constructed around the phu di, a term that came to classify a new social classification that distinguished those with education in social etiquette and manners adopted from Europe. Of these, one of the biggest changes was the use of European cutlery, which Kukrit Pramoj attributed to the reign of Rama IV, and became more commonly used during the reign of Rama V. The introduction of European cutlery was noticed by Sir John Bowring, as he observed a courtier’s awkwardness in using fork and knife during an official banquet. The courtier, observed Bowring, ‘held the prongs of the fork in his hand, not knowing which end (he) was to employ’. Adopting European manners and etiquettes became an important cultural tool in attaining the status of siwilai.\n\nEtiquette aside, culinary practices presented a more complicated picture in the light of siwilai. Since the foundation of Bangkok, the western culinary codes (both khaek and farang) had been of great importance to the Court, despite the fact that Bangkok was largely populated by Chinese migrants. From European visitors such as John Crowfurd in the early nineteenth century, to Sir John Bowring and Anna Leonowens in the middle, all commented on how the Siamese aristocracy’s culinary repertoire consisted of both European and Siamese dishes. When Bowring visited the court in 1855, he was given a personal welcome by Rama IV. The King offered Bowring and his embassy a welcome lunch which Bowring described thus:\n\nWe were conducted to a large apartment in which the King is accustomed to receive the talapoins, and we found a lunch, or tiffin, laid out in perfect European taste, though the table was covered with Asiatic fruits and preserves. There were, however, American biscuits; and one dish at least that I tasted evidenced that the cuisine was one of his Majesty’s cares, and that his cooks, if not Europeans, have (to) all events received European instruction\n\nThe culinary mix between Siamese and European dishes was not only restricted to the court of Mongkut. The household of Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawong (1808-1882) for instance, also served foreign visitors with mix culinary treats, as reported by Leonowens when she attended a welcoming dinner at his house in 1862:\n\nDinner at the Premier’s was composed and served with the same incongruous blending of the barbaric and the refined, the Oriental and the European, that characterized the furniture and adornments of his palace.\n\nThe court’s culinary repertoire, as described by these two foreign visitors, reveals that both European and Siamese dishes that could be seen as a form of culinary diplomacy, aiming to reveal the siwilai status of the court kitchen. Conversely, the culinary mix was perhaps a true reflection of some of the Siamese aristocratic tastes in mixing dishes from many cultures, a practice that was exposed in the KHKKW.\n\nAnother report from Bowring of a dinner at Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawong’s offers an added dimension to the culinary mixing of the Siamese:\n\nAn excellent dinner: the soup highly spiced; birds nests, shark-fins, and sea-slugs were excellent. There was roasted pig, game, delicious fruits, and most remarkable of which was the durian, prepared with cocoa-nut milk, which even the impugners of the durian (I am not one) declared unexceptionably excellent\n\nThe meal that Chao Phraya Sri Suriyawong provided here as reported by Bowring seems to belong to the Chinese culinary code, with dishes like ‘birds’ nests’, ‘shark-fins’, and ‘sea-slugged’ cited. What this reveals is the variations in the culinary taste of the Siamese elites, and their correspondence with the court’s cultural orientation.\n\nBy the middle of the nineteenth century, aristocratic households like the house of Bunnag and even the court consumed both European as well as Chinese dishes. Even though the word ‘Thai cuisine’ was not yet coined by the age of siwilai, what was celebrated by the Siamese elite was their cosmopolitan taste in food consumption. As they interacted with the world, the Siamese elite’s culinary cosmopolitan mix offered a glimpse of their power and their connection with the world around them. The culinary ‘Self’ for the Siamese elite at this stage, was still largely defined by their role as a culinary crossroads between what was East and West to the Siamese cultural home. Their taste, in this sense, was a reflection of their seaborne economic activities.\n\nMoving away from the cultural home, the Siamese slowly developed a sense of their culinary ‘self’ as they ventured out into the world. Responding to the diplomatic initiative of Sir John Bowring, King Mongkut decided to send an embassy to court of Queen Victoria in 1857, led by Phraya Montri Suriyawong (Chum Bunnag, 1820-\n\n1882). An account of this embassy was kept by the embassy’s translator, Mom Ratchothai (M.R. Krathai Isarangkul, 1820-1867). After arriving in London, Mom Ratchothai observed that the English fresh market offered an abundance of meat, but not nearly enough fruits or vegetables. His view of the London market reflected the nature of nineteenth-century Bangkok market, which offered an abundance of\n\nvegetables and fruits, as one foreign observer noticed in 1900. The meat, on the other hand, was only sold by the Chinese, as it was not popular with the Thais.\n\nAs more and more Siamese traveled abroad in the late nineteenth century, they experienced new – mostly European – culinary practices. These new experiences enhanced their own sense of culinary ‘self’, through local dishes that were unavailable to them overseas. King Chulalongkorn, for example, constantly expressed a sense of longing for vernacular home dishes such as nam phrik and khai chiew while traveling through Europe in 1907. More significantly, the encounters with the culinary ‘others’ beyond the Siamese cultural home forced these travelers to reconsider their own food in a different cultural landscape. A dialectical relationship emerged between the home culinary practices and the ‘Others’. It was through these experiences that the Thai culinary language was constructed.\n\nThe MKHP: The Birth of the Thai Cookbook\n\nThe discourse of siwilai in the late nineteenth century played an important part in the creation of cookbooks in the Thai language. The Siamese elite at this stage were eager to re-position themselves culturally to fit into the civilized world order shaped by the European powers. In 1890, the first cookbook written in Thai was completed within the confines of the Bangkok court. This cookbook, Tumra Thum Kub Khao Farang (farang cookbook), was a collection of recipes translated from English and French sources by King Chulalongkorn and one of his lesser wives, Chao Chom Nom Jotikasthira.\n\nThe Tumra Tum Kub Khao Farang represented the Siamese elite’s first effort in localizing the European culinary codes (mainly British and French) through cookbook writing. The farang cookbook provided the Siamese with a culinary window that reveals the inner workings of a siwilai culinary repertoire. The Siamese court retained its position as the center of the culinary ‘high’ code by translating these European recipes. Unlike the Siamese court’s localization of seaborne culinary codes from the time of Ayutthaya and early Bangkok, the translation of the siwilai culinary code in the late nineteenth century represented something entirely different. Instead of being at the pinnacle of the culinary landscape seizing upon ordinary kitchens, the Siamese court was now the translator of siwilai. In short, by translating the European culinary codes, the Siamese court positioned itself as the culinary bastion of siwilai, a gateway between the civilized European world and the Siamese cultural home.\n\nBy 1908, the first Siamese recipe book, the MKHP, was compiled by Lady Plian Phasakorawong. Inspired by Isabella Beeton’s cookbook, The Book of Household Management, Lady Plian assembled the culinary codes available to her and wrote a five-volume long, encyclopedic cookbook. In MKHP, cooking recipes were presented along with stories about some of the dishes. In some part, Lady Plian even discussed the suitability of different Siamese regions for growing different kinds of crops. MKHP can be also considered as a culinary example of the Thai ‘manual knowledge’ that was constructed. The virtues represented in Lady Plian’s cookbook is what the Siamese elite of the time considered as essential attributes to a modern Lady (suphap-satri). In his analysis of modern Thai gender relation in early Twentieth century Scott Barmé points out that the desirable characteristics of a Thai modern lady are base on a combination of ‘traditional’ domestic skills and ‘modern’ learning and sociability. Suphap-satri was defined as a counter part to suphap- burut (gentlemen), their attributes were not fixed, but follow the modernization landscape of the turn of the century Siam where social relations between men and women, and between social classes gradually transformed according to the way the Siamese ruling class translated Western modernity.\n\nThe invention of their modern meanings were inspired by the idea of instilling a set of morality that was of contemporary relevance to the modernization process, and a behavioral code that the modernizing Siamese elite considered fundamental to the nation’s progress and prosperity. This new meaning of modern and refined men and women were based largely on class consciousness, perpetuated by the literati. The Sombat Phu Di, or ‘Characteristics of a Properly Behaved Person’ written by Chao Phraya Wisut Suriyasak (Pia Malakul, 1867-1961) best exemplified the Siamese elites’ obsession with instilling behavioral coded of conduct among its educated populace. This manual provided its readers with a list of socially appropriate behaviors. From ‘show respect to elders’, ‘do not lie’, ‘be mindful of personal hygiene’ to ‘do not show your merriment when others are suffering’, Sombat Phu Di provided an appropriate code of conduct as defined by the ruling elite.\n\nHistorian Craig Reynolds points out that the principles informing Sombat Phu Di are ‘very bourgeois and very Buddhist’. These two dynamics represented the Siamese elite’s modernization project. Reynolds argues that the Buddhist morals, which have its own list of ‘dos and don’t’, were the ideological precursor to the phu di code, since they also reflect the traditional Siamese education system. The articulation of the phu di code, nevertheless, was based on social classes. The ‘proper’ social behavior was determined by the Siamese elite, which by the late nineteenth century began to include a phu di middle class, although still very dependent on the Bangkok court.\n\nApplying Reynolds’ analysis of the Sombat Phu Di to Lady Plian’s cookbook, one could say that the principles behind the MKHP were also very bourgeois on the one hand, and very court-centric on the other.
