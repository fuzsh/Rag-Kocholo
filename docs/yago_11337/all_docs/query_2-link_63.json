        "text": "Despite Thailand being a constitutional monarchy, the monarchs wield significant influence. Any legal changes in Thailand require the approval signature of the Chakri monarchs. Moreover, criticizing or speaking ill of the monarchs and royal family members is prohibited. How do the monarchs influence the spiritual, economic, and cultural life of Thailand? Let's delve into it with Mytour's article.\n\n1. Introduction to the Chakri Dynasty of Thailand\n\nFollowing the coronation of King Rama X, the Chakri Dynasty of Thailand has captured the attention of many. How many Chakri monarchs has the dynasty seen? How was the Chakri dynasty established? How many years has it endured? All these questions will be meticulously answered in the following article.\n\nThe Chakri Monarchs of Thailand Across the Eras (Image Source: Compilation)\n\nThe Chakri Dynasty has been established since 1782, spanning 242 years of history. Before King Rama X ascended to the throne in 2019, the Thai Chakri dynasty had witnessed 9 reigns.\n\nAfter the complete collapse of the Ayutthaya kingdom, a Siamese general named Taksin rose to the throne. Taksin the Great was the sole king of the Thonburi Kingdom. Following a coup in 1782, King Taksin was deposed. General Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok seized power and established the Chakri dynasty. He assumed the title Rama I (King of Kings).\n\nSince then, the entire land of Thailand has been under the rule of the Chakri dynasty to this day. Upon ascending the throne, King Rama I decided to relocate the capital to the east bank of the Chao Phraya River. Later, this area developed into the bustling capital of Bangkok.\n\nIf King Rama I laid the foundation for a prosperous nation, then Rama II propelled and developed the culture further. By the reign of King Rama III, efforts were made to establish peaceful relations with Western powers to avoid the fate of being invaded like neighboring countries.\n\n2. The Monarchs of Chakri Thailand Reigning Over the Nation\n\n2.1 Rama I: King Phra Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (1737-1809)\n\nYodfa Chulaloke was the first king to establish the Chakri dynasty in 1782. Before ascending to the throne, King Phra Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke (Rama I) held the title Chao Phraya Chakri for over 10 years.\n\nKing Rama I is credited with building the Chakri dynasty of Thailand (Image Source: Compilation)\n\nKing Rama I decided to relocate the capital to Bangkok and constructed the city in the architectural style of ancient Ayutthaya. He ruled the nation for 27 years, leaving significant historical marks, notably the victory against the Burmese invasion of Siam in 1785-1786. Additionally, King Rama I is revered as one of the greatest Chakri monarchs of Thailand.\n\n2.2 Rama II: King Phra Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (1767-1824)\n\nAfter the demise of King Rama I, King Loet La Naphalai succeeded his father in 1089. During his nearly 15-year reign, the Chakri dynasty under his rule was much more peaceful than his father's era. King Rama II mainly focused on advancing arts and literature. Towards the end of Rama II's reign, Siam bolstered its military strength, enhancing its national standing on the international stage among neighboring countries.\n\n2.3 Rama III: King Phra Nangklao (1788-1851)\n\nDuring King Phra Nangklao's reign, he primarily focused on reforming the tax system and national finance. Additionally, King Rama III opened up trade with China throughout his 27-year rule.\n\nKing Rama III implemented a flexible governance policy and established friendly relations with the West (Image Source: Compilation)\n\nFurthermore, King Rama III also reestablished diplomatic relations with Western powers, dating back to the Ayutthaya era. Unlike the two previous reigns, King Rama III did not pass the throne to his offspring but instead to his half-brother.\n\n2.4 Rama IV: King Mongkut (1804-1868)\n\nRegarded as one of the most renowned Chakri monarchs among Western countries, King Mongkut even appeared in the legendary Broadway musical - The King and I (1956). Additionally, his character was portrayed in a Hollywood film in 1956.\n\nKing Rama IV ruled the nation for 17 years. During his reign, the Chakri dynasty faced significant pressure from the West. Consequently, King IV had to sign treaties relinquishing royal monopolies over foreign trade. He passed away due to malaria during an expedition.\n\n2.5 Rama V: King Chulalongkorn (1853-1910)\n\nKing Chulalongkorn is acclaimed as one of the greatest Chakri monarchs of Thailand. King Rama V was the pioneering Siamese monarch of the Chakri dynasty to study abroad in Europe. During his European education, he promoted Siamese culture, its people, and the country's progress to European authorities.\n\nKing Rama V was the first Chakri monarch to study abroad in the West (Image Source: Compilation)\n\nThroughout his 42-year reign, King Rama V made efforts to modernize the nation by completely abolishing slavery. Additionally, he ceded some territory to the West to avoid invasion, as neighboring countries faced.\n\n2.6 Rama VI: King Vajiravudh (1881-1925)\n\nThroughout his reign, King Rama VI tirelessly encouraged creativity among the people, fostering patriotism and national pride. Additionally, King Vajiravudh implemented numerous reform policies, modernizing the military. In 1912, he quelled a coup initiated by disgruntled palace officials. This stemmed from accusations and suspicions of King Rama VI's extravagant spending and alleged attempts to overthrow the Chakri dynasty.\n\n2.7 Rama VII: King Prajadhipok (1893-1941)\n\nAmong the Chakri monarchs of Thailand, King Rama VII was the constitutional monarch of the Land of the Golden Temple. He also became the first constitutional monarch after the Siamese revolution. In 1935, King Prajadhipok officially abdicated after a coup by a group of military officers. In his later years, he spent his remaining time living happily with his wife in England. King Rama VII had no children.\n\n2.8 Rama VIII: King Ananda Mahidol (1925-1946)\n\nAs King Rama VII had no children, his nephew, King Ananda Mahidol, succeeded to the throne. King Ananda Mahidol's biological father was Prince Mahidol, the son of King Rama V. At the age of 9, while studying in Switzerland, King Ananda Mahidol was chosen to ascend the throne. During that time, the government also changed the country's name to Thailand in 1939.\n\nKing Rama VIII was shot and died in his bedroom at the palace in Bangkok. This incident occurred before he could return to Switzerland for his studies.\n\n2.9 Rama IX: King Bhumibol Adulyadej (1927-2016)\n\nAfter King Ananda's passing, Bhumibol Adulyadej succeeded his elder brother in 1946. He is one of the longest-reigning Chakri monarchs in the Chakri dynasty. King Rama IX is regarded as an icon of Thai royalty, blending traditional and modern ideals. Additionally, the touching love story between him and Queen Sirikit has moved many.\n\nKing Rama IX was a wise and beloved monarch who earned the people's respect throughout his reign (Image Source: Compilation)\n\nDespite numerous challenges faced by Thailand during his reign, King Rama IX pursued a policy of reconciliation, preventing coups. As a result, he was the first monarch to be bestowed the title 'Lifetime Achievement in Human Development' by the United Nations.\n\nThrough 1,000 implemented projects, King IX helped lift farmers out of poverty. To the Thai people, King Rama IX was a great leader. His contributions are forever remembered by the people. In 2016, King Bhumibol Adulyadej passed away, leaving a profound sense of loss among the Thai populace.\n\n2.10 Rama X: King Vajiralongkorn (1952 - present)\n\nSucceeding King Rama IX is his biological son - King Vajiralongkorn. He is currently the reigning monarch of Thailand, officially ascending to the throne on May 4, 2019. Following the coronation ceremony, King Vajiralongkorn became the 10th monarch of the Chakri dynasty.\n\nKing Rama X is the incumbent King of the Land of the Golden Temple (Image Source: Compilation)\n\nHe is the only son of King Rama IX and Queen Sirikit. He ascended to the throne at the age of 64, becoming the oldest reigning monarch at the time of his coronation.\n\n3. Who is the longest-reigning Chakri monarch of Thailand?\n\nAmong the Chakri monarchs of Thailand, Rama IX holds the record for the longest reign. Over his 70-year rule, he remained beloved and revered by the Thai people for his projects improving social welfare.\n\nFurthermore, King Rama IX was a polymath, possessing artistic talent and wielding political power for the betterment of his people. This is why the Thai people revered King Bhumibol Adulyadej as 'a living saint'."
