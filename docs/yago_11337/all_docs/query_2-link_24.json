M. King Paramindr Maha Prajadhipok Pra Pokklao Chowyoohua : and containing his coronation, year B. E. 2468 = [Paralleltitel in Thai]. -- Bangkok : Siam Postage Stamp Co., o. J. -- passim]\n\n\"The following monograph on infectious and epidemic diseases, written by Dr. Ira Ayer, the former Adviser of the Department of Public Health, in 1926, is here given with only a few additional remarks and slight modifications :\n\n\"The Department forwards epidemiological and pertinent information to the Health Organization of the League of Nations, of which Siam is a member, and exchanges similar information by telegraph and radio with the Eastern Bureau of the League at Singapore. The work of the Bureau at Singapore is regarded as of great value, not only intending to standardize returns so that they are more easily comparable and in distributing information of practical value, but in bringing the different administrations into closer touch with one another and fostering a spirit of co-operation which should be of far reaching effect.\n\n\"The notifiable epidemic diseases are\n\nplague,\n\nsmallpox,\n\ncholera and\n\nepidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis.\n\nTelegraphic reports of all cases of these diseases are required to be made to the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nAbb.: Meningitis, Autopsiebefund\n\n[Bildquelle: CDC / Wikipedia. -- Public domain]\n\n\"Epidemic cerebro-spinal meningitis is not very prevalent and has been confined chiefly to prisons and barracks. It was first recorded in Bangkok in the report of the Medical Officer of Health for the year 1921.\n\nAbb.: Xenopsylla chepsis (Orientalischer Rattenfloh), der primäre Übertrager der Pest\n\n[Bildquelle: CDC / Wikimedia. -- Public domain]\n\n\"The first case of plague appears to have been noted in Bangkok in 1904, about ten years after the beginning of the, present pandemic which, starting from the interior of China, has gradually involved in some degree nearly every country in the East. The disease established itself in Bangkok and quickly spread to certain localities in the interior. Though by no means as serious as in certain other eastern countries it has become one of the endemic diseases of Siam. No documentary records are available for the earliest occurrences but some examples from unofficial sources of information may be of interest. The inland town of Korat [โคราช\n\n], which was affected soon after plague was reported in Bangkok, was subject to almost yearly outbreaks; in 1906 a whole section of the, town was burned in an attempt to eradicate the disease; in 1908 the number of daily cases is said to have reached a maximum of 35; in 1912, during a single dry season, over 800 people are said to have died. Departmental records for the interior provinces date from 1914. In the year 1917 during the course of a severe epidemic in which the population of this town of about 7,000 people was literally decimated, very thorough reconstructive work was carried out under the direct supervision of the Director of the Medical Department of the Ministry of the Interior; since then there have been only a few minor recurrences.\n\nAbb.: Lage von Korat [โคราช]\n\n[Bildquelle: OpenStreetMap. -- Creative Commons Lizenz (Namensnennung, share alike)]\n\n\"An officer of the provincial gendarmerie, who was stationed at Korat [โคราช], tells of the following interesting experience. One day he met a procession carrying a bier upon which lay a figure dressed like a corpse for burial. People beating drums headed the procession and others carrying lamps and torches flanked it on either side; it was followed by a huge crowd of excited people. The procession passed around the city walls and finally entered a temple, where offerings were made and the bier was left, the people believing that the plague spirits had been tricked into entering the figure and, this then being on holy ground, they could not get out to resume their evil work in the town. This is of interest as showing the attitude of some of the people not so many years ago, but now very different.\n\n\"A number of other places were early affected and show a somewhat similar history to that of Korat. In 1906 at Nagor Pathom [Nakhon Pathom - นครปฐม] over 300 persons are said to have died in a population of less than 3,000. The writer has seen instances where whole households have died within a few days. The death of two or three in a family of five or six has frequently occurred. Villages of over two thousand people have been deserted until the epizootic had killed most of the infected rats and the people could safely return. It says something for public health that such occurrences are now becoming infrequent.\n\nAbb.: Lage von Nakhon Pathom (นครปฐม)\n\n[Bildquelle: OpenStreetMap. -- Creative Commons Lizenz (Namensnennung, share alike)]\n\n\"In the earlier outbreaks buildings or whole sections of infected towns were not infrequently burned. More recently, a large amount of alteration and reconstruction of buildings has been undertaken and, wherever this has been done, definite results in diminution or cessation of plague have been attained.\" Loans of money were sometimes made to small property owners to expedite such improvements. \" Unfortunately, in the absence of powers to enforce building regulations, insanitary conditions gradually recur.\n\n\"The health authorities have been able to concentrate upon the rat as the chief factor in plague because epidemic pneumonic plague is rare in Siam and bubonic plague is seldom \"if ever in this country\" directly spread by the sick individual. There is a seasonal tendency in plague, usually the months of January to March or April.\n\nAbb.: Vibrio cholerae, der Choleraerreger, elektronenmikroskopische Aufnahme\n\n[Bildquelle: Tom Kirn, Ron Taylor, Louisa Howard - Dartmouth Electron Microscope Facility / Wikimedia. -- Public domain]\n\n\"Severe epidemics of cholera occurred long before departmental records were kept. The older residents will tell of regular processions of coffins in what is now the principal business street of Bangkok. These belong to a past generation, but still cholera is one of the most serious of the epidemic diseases with which the health authority has to deal.\n\n\"The first general cholera epidemic of which official records are available, began in February 1919 in a small town on the upper course of the River Ping [แม่น้ำปิง] near the Burmese frontier. Notwithstanding all that could be done the disease spread rapidly and during the next two years there occurred over 18,000 cases and 13.000 deaths. Although sporadic cholera is reported every year from different localities, there is a tendency to a periodicity of about six years in these extensive outbreaks.\n\nAbb.: River Ping [แม่น้ำปิง]\n\n[Bildquelle: Kmusser / Wikimedia. -- Creative Commons Lizenz (Namensnennung, share alike)]\n\n\"An epidemic began in Bangkok in October 1925 and again extended rapidly. By the end of September 1925, over 10.000 cases and 7.000 deaths had been reported in the interior provinces, and 3,000 cases and 1,800 deaths in Bangkok. Very active educational propaganda was carried on, posters were placed prominently throughout the city and in the provinces, information concerning precautions to be taken was disseminated by means of public lectures and in the cinema halls, many thousand leaflets were distributed. The effect of this propaganda was visible in the actions of a considerable number of the population.\n\n\"During a period of two months at the height of the epidemic and before the onset of the rains, the Department of Public Health distributed over 1,000,000 gallons of water at the rate of about 17,500 gallons per day to communities in the vicinity of Bangkok, which had not access to the city water supply. Medicine was freely distributed and 237,206 anti-cholera inoculations were performed.\n\n\"The Siamese Red Cross Society greatly assisted in this emergency by making the strenuous effort needed to prepare at the Queen Saovabha Memorial Institute [สถานเสาวภา] the exceptional quantity of vaccines required, and further showed its desire to be of the highest service by supplying these to the health authorities free of charge during the whole period of the epidemic.\n\n\"The Navy also gave valuable assistance by converting the naval hospital at Bangkok into an emergency cholera hospital, furnishing the full staff, equipment and medical supplies.\n\n\"One of the Royal Princes generously lent his former palace to the Department of Public Health for use as an emergency cholera hospital. By reason of location and arrangement this became the best emergency hospital established by the Department. Private firms and citizens also gave material assistance by lending motor cars and a large water boat to the Department.\n\n\"It is of interest to note that in these epidemics the disease has tended to be more serious and persistent in the great central valley and along the course of the larger rivers, and relatively much less severe in certain Circles where the people depend for their domestic water supplies upon deep wells. In both the last and preceding epidemics Bangkok had the advantage of the present water system which undoubtedly did much to lessen the severity of the disease in the city.\n\n\"Since then two smaller outbreaks of cholera have taken place, the only noteworthy feature of these being the extensive use of anti-cholera vaccination which had become popular in most parts of the infected area and which undoubtedly checked their virulence even before the occurrence of heavy rainfall which has been often observed to have a very marked effect upon this disease.\n\nAbb.: Pocken\n\n[Bildquelle: George Henry Fox 1886 / Wikipedia. -- Public domain]\n\n\"Smallpox is a definitely preventable disease but only at the price of continued watchfulness. Several years ago smallpox broke out in a small isolated southern fishing community. For various reasons, the outbreak got out of hand before the Ministry was informed of the true conditions and the disease spread to other places on the coast. The central health department then took charge and the epidemic was promptly checked, hut the conditions in the localities first affected were evidence that, left to itself, smallpox could still disorganize the life of communities in this country. Their activities were practically suspended, people marked by the disease were seen everywhere and, though the epidemic was beginning to burn itself out, persons in the active stages of the disease were widely scattered in the villages. In the face of this disaster there was a pitiful feeling of helplessness among these people until they appreciated the assistance which the health authorities were able to give them.\n\n\"On the whole the Government may properly feel some gratification regarding this disease as not only is the population becoming fairly well protected by continued vaccination but by intensive vaccination in the event of an outbreak a number of threatening epidemics have been brought under control.\n\n\"The conscientious objector is fortunately not prevalent in this country.\n\n[...]\n\nAbb.: Grippe-Symptome\n\n[Bildquelle: CDC / Wikipedia. -- Public domain]\n\n\"Siam did not escape the great pandemic of influenza. It appeared in Bangkok in the month of October 1919 and spread from point to point over the whole country. The type was somewhat less severe than in many other places but over 80,000 deaths were reported as due to influenza during the six months of prevalence, in many places business was at a stand-still and even the government offices were closed.\n\nAbb.: Lebenszyklus der Plasmodien\n\n[Bildquelle: Wikipedia. -- Public domain]\n\n\"Year in and year out malaria justifies its characterization by Osler [Sir William Osler, 1st Baronet, 1849 - 1919] as the greatest single destroyer of the human race. When one has once seen a fever stricken village with more than half the population sick, with perhaps a death in nearly every household, it makes an impression not easily forgotten. Between 40,000 and 50,000 deaths from malaria have been reported in a single year. The question of dealing with malaria is of course constantly before the health authorities ; quinine is distributed in increasing quantity but, owing to its extent and complexity, the malarial problem of Siam is yet far from practical solution.\" It is a worthy matter of note that the Speech from the Throne, already referred to, made special comments upon this serious national problem, and indications are not wanting that immediate steps will be taken to study the specific local factors.\n\nAbb.: Lebenszyklus von Entamoeba histolytica\n\n[Bildquelle: CDC. -- Public domain]\n\n\"Dysentery is prevalent throughout the country. The amoebic form [\n\nAmöbenruhr] is a frequent cause of disability among foreigners, and it is likely that eating uncooked salads and garnished foods is one of the chief causes of this. During the epidemic of cholera such foods were not served in any of the hotels of the Royal State Railways, an example which is believed to be worthy of imitation.\n\nAbb.: Lebenszyklus des Hakenwurms (Ancylostoma duodenale)\n\n[Bildquelle: CDC. -- Public domain]\n\n\" Hookworm and intestinal parasites are prevalent and widely spread. Owing to the activities of the Sanitary Campaign data concerning these diseases are more complete than for any others except the four notifiable epidemic diseases. Of variable intensity in different parts of the country, they are generally a good index of sanitary conditions and because of the facility with which they can be demonstrated and cured are largely utilized in connection with educational propaganda for improvement of the public health.\n\nAbb.: Positiver Befund von Darmparasiten in 722.000 Stuhlproben 1917 - 1923-03-31 (in Prozent, mehrere Befunde im gleichen Stuhl sind möglich)\n\n[Datenquelle: Siam : general and medical features / by the Executive Committee of the 8th Congress of Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine. -- Bangkok : Bangkok Times, 1930. -- S. 217]\n\nPneumonia as well as some of the characteristic tropical diseases also require consideration.\n\nOther diseases are, \" however] \" notable for their absence or comparative rarity. Among these may be mentioned\n\ntyphus fever,\n\nthe relapsing fevers,\n\ncertain diseases caused by flukes such as schistosomiasis,\n\nkala azar,\n\nhuman trypanosomiasis (African sleeping sickness),\n\nMalta fever [Brucellosis],\n\npellagra,\n\ndiphtheria,\n\nscarlet fever\n\nand others.\n\nYellow fever has fortunately never been brought into the Far East. Apparently one has to thank distance for this and there has been some apprehension on the part of eastern health authorities that with greatly increased facilities of communication the disease might be introduced. The extent of such a disaster in eastern conditions and a virgin field can only be guessed. But the Rockefeller Foundation, in its successful attempt to control yellow fever in its American strongholds and its undertaking to do a similar service for the west coast of Africa is performing a world service which will probably prevent such possibilities from becoming realities.\"\n\n[Quelle: Siam : general and medical features / by the Executive Committee of the 8th Congress of Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine. -- Bangkok : Bangkok Times, 1930. -- S. 218 - 222, 224f.]"
