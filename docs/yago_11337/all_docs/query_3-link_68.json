        "text": "(Aka: Arabeske, Arabeska, Arabeski – Colour – 1966)\n\nWhen American director Stanley Donen decided to cast debonair actor Cary Grant (born Archibald Alexander Leach – 1904-86), his co-partner of Grandon Productions, in the romantic comedy-thriller “Charade” (1963), Donen sought a helping hand from its leading actress Audrey Hepburn to rope in Grant since he was a bit conscious of his 25 years age difference with Hepburn. Although Grant had long wanted to work with Hepburn, it would be only after certain modifications were effected in the original script of Peter Stone from his own novel, that Grant would be suitably convinced to accept the role. The film would be his third collaboration with Donen, seventieth movie and 30th anniversary of his entry into movies. Grant’s 59th birthday also fell during the filming and he had a new love in actress Dyan Cannon.\n\nSet in Paris, Peter Joshua’s (Grant) help is sought by Reggie Lampert (Hepburn) to locate $250,000 in gold stashed away by her murdered husband while three sinister men are also on the look out to recover it. In the process, Joshua and Lampert fall in love. When the audience saw Hepburn’s doe-like eyes gazing at Grant, the age suddenly ceased to matter.\n\nDonen had directed Hepburn in “Funny Face” back in 1957 which featured a plot notably different from that of its Broadway musical version. Hepburn had acted in that with 58 year old Fred Astaire, 30 years her senior whom she had expressly insisted to cast as her leading man by using it as a precondition to her participation in that movie.\n\nCasting men of higher age with Hepburn would become a regular case in her career, being one of the reasons Grant originally refused to act with her in “Charade”. Anyhow, “Funny Face” brought Donen nomination for “Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Motion Pictures” by the Directors Guild of America and for a “Golden Palm” at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival.\n\n“Charade” was fervently made by Donen in tune with his close friend Alfred Hitchcock’s “North by Northwest”, one of his favourite movies and when it was released in December 1963, two weeks after the assassination of President J. F Kennedy, it turned out to be a huge financial success. The film also spawned a series of stylish thrillers, that even in 2002, director Jonathan Demme remade it under the title “The Truth About Charlie”.\n\nThe film’s success inspired Donen to make yet another breezy, romantic thriller in 1966 titled “Arabesque” with Cary Grant in the leading role. Understandably, Grant flatly refused the role, well aware that he was of the tender age of 62 by then. He wouldn’t have minded acting with Loren, lined up for the movie, even though their brief affair during the 16 weeks they were in Spain in 1956 filming director Stanley Kramer’s “The Pride and the Passion”, according to a biography of Grant, didn’t lead to the altar. The search for a leading man ended when Grant himself recommended the casting of 50 year old, 6’ 3” Gregory Peck in the role of Oxford professor of languages with Italian siren Sophia Loren as the leading lady.\n\nGregory Peck (more details ref. my review of “StarChoice 14: The Million Pound Note”) had completed his performance as David Stillwell, a New York accountant suffering from amnesia in director Edward Dmytryk’s black and white suspense thriller “Mirage” (1965), and was available for the filming of “Arabesque”. “Mirage” was based on the novel “Fallen Angel” by Walter Ericson (aka. Howard Fast who wrote “Spartacus”). The script of “Mirage” written brilliantly by Peter Stone as a follow-up to “Charade”, helped the casting of Peck in “Arabesque” easier for Donen.\n\nUnlike in “Mirage” in which Peck with his distinctive low-pitched voice was trying to figure out his past, in “Arabesque” which is shot in Technicolor, Peck would appear as Professor David Pollock, a man on a clock trying to decipher a secret inscription.\n\nProduced by Donen under the banner of Stanley Donen Enterprises, Ltd and presented through Universal Pictures, “Arabesque” opens with the arrival of Professor Ragheeb to keep up with his appointment with Mr. Saeed for an eye check up. Ragheeb was surprised to learn from Sloane that Saeed has taken to flu and Sloane is looking after his appointments. Even though Ragheeb’s eyes were found to be in good order, Sloane went ahead to put drops into his eyes to dilate the pupils. Moments later, Ragheeb was dead. Sloane extracts a piece of paper hidden inside one of the temples of his spectacles which had a series of signs inscribed on it.\n\nCut to: a class room at the Oxford University. David Pollack, the visiting American professor, was explaining about Hieroglyphics from a display sign that could be from the reign of the great Pharaoh Ramses II. In the dark room, we could make out the figure of Sloane watching the professor conclude his lecture and inform the class that Professor Ragheeb will be back tomorrow.\n\nSloane introduces himself to Pollack as “Major Sylvester Pennington Sloane of Her Majesty’s 42 Highland Fusiliers”. Now retired, he is the private secretary to Mr. Nejim Beshraavi – yes, “The Nejim Beshraavi” of the shipping lines, who would like to meet Pollack in London for which a car is now waiting.\n\nHaving refused to go with Sloane for keeping up with the routine of his Wednesdays, Pollack was later jogging through the park when he was forcibly pulled into a mysterious black Rolls Royce inside which he meets up with His Excellency, Mr. Hassan Jena, the Prime Minister of a Middle Eastern country whom Pollack admired. Apart from the driver, the other passenger who made the introductions was Mohammed Lufti, Jena’s Ambassador to Great Britain.\n\nNecessary apologies were offered to Pollack by Jena for having used unorthodox method for making his acquaintance. He had two requests for Pollack. Officially, Jena is not supposed to be in England and has not seen Pollack. His visit is to be kept a secret. Jena believes that his fellow countryman, Nejim Beshraavi, the richest and the most powerful citizen, has reasons to approach Pollack with a business proposition. Pollack confirms this and adds that he had already turned him down. Having established that, Jena confirms that Pollack’s association with Beshraavi could be valuable to the cause of freedom since Beshraavi is opposed to Jena’s programmes and could create violent oppositions to it in the near future. As for his second request, Jena would like Pollack to re-establish contact with Beshraavi to find out what his intentions are and when he intends to act. Since the assignment carries a certain amount of risk; Beshraavi respects no one’s life but his own, Pollack was offered the choice to simply walk away from this proposal. However, Pollack elects to shoulder the job for Jena.\n\nPollack meets up with Beshraavi in the library of a house in London near the Zoological Gardens where Beshraavi also introduces to Pollack his “excessively loyal” Peregrine falcon called Hassan, named after his beloved Prime Minister Hassan Jena since Jena and the falcon share so many sterling qualities.\n\nProducing the piece of paper he had obtained belligerently through Sloane from Professor Ragheeb, he asks Pollack to decipher it. At a glance, Pollack expresses his opinion that it is a copy of a Hittite inscription dating back to the Second Millennium.\n\nPollack being an expert in deciphering messages written in Egyptian hieroglyphics (ancient languages), Beshraavi is prepared to pay $30,000 to him to stay in his house and decipher it by 8 pm. When Pollack was attempting to decipher the inscription while enjoying the famous Quality Street twist wrap sweets, he meets up with the exotic Yasmin Azir, the mistress of Beshraavi who is a captive in her own house.\n\nYasmin’s attempt to lead the conversation to the cipher was shortlived. Still in a sociable frame of mind, her further conversation was cut short by the arrival of Beshraavi who asserts to Pollack his proprietary interest in Yasmin.\n\nDuring dinner that night with Pollack, Beshraavi, and his friend, the banker Beauchamp, Yasmin, in an adventurous mood, secretly slipped a note into Pollack’s hand which was discovered by all, due to the sloppiness of Pollack.\n\nExplaining to Beshraavi with a cool exterior that it’s just a prescription, he manages to retire to his room. Once Yasmin had also left the dining room, Beauchamp shares a gossip with Beshraavi which he had heard at the Exchange that when Prime Minister Jena arrives in London the day after tomorrow, he will sign a treaty which specifies Anglo-American finance in return for a promise that Jena’s country uses only English and American tankers.\n\nEven though this would mean that Beshraavi’s ships will be laid up for good, Beshraavi was confident that there will be no treaty signed.\n\nMeanwhile, David finds that Yasmin had slipped into his hand not one, but two papers: one was a newspaper clipping about Professor Ragheeb’s death due to “fall from eighth floor window”, while the other was a handwritten note directing him to meet up with her at the “first room top of the stairs.”\n\nWhen Pollack finally meets up with her, having disposed of the papers, Yasmin informs him that Ragheeb was murdered by Beshraavi’s men and they would kill him too if he didn’t keep out of this. Once again, their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of Beshraavi.\n\nWith Beshraavi inside the bedroom, Yasmin was forced to take a shower despite the masculine compliments of Pollack who was hiding behind her.\n\nSoon a chase was on to locate the missing Pollack during which Pollack escapes with Yasmin on the pretext that he had kidnapped her. They were chased by Beshraavi’s thug Mustafa to the Zoological Gardens, down the Monkey House, past the caged animals into the aquarium wing where a fight eventually ensues between Pollack and Mustafa. Pollack was saved by the timely intervention of a man in trench coat and hat who later identifies himself as Inspector Webster, CID whose department had been watching Yasmin’s house since Beshraavi started staying there. Then again, when a zoo official demands to see his identity card, Webster shoots him with a silenced gun. Pollack’s mind always travelling, was now perplexed: Whose side is Webster on? He is not with the authorities, or with Beshraavi. He can’t be with Prime Minister Jena. Then Webster clarifies that he is with Yasmin and they all want the cipher. The chase is on……\n\nLoosely based on the novel “The Cipher” by Gordon Cotler and screenplay by Julian Mitchell, Pierre Marton (Peter Stone) and Stanley Price, ”Arabesque” would provide Stanley Donen with his second box office success in a row. Before Donen diversified into chic comedies and thrillers when musical films lost popularity by the end of the 1950s, Donen was a dancer/choreographer. Once hailed as “the King of the Hollywood musicals”, he had tried to create a direct continuation from the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals. During the course of an illustrious career, he would co-direct “On the Town”, “Singin’ in the Rain” with Gene Kelly, helm sole directorship of movies such as “Royal Wedding”, “Seven Brides for Seven Brothers”, “Funny Face”, “The Pajama Game”, “The Grass is Greener”, etc. The last surviving reputable film director from Hollywood’s Golden Era, Donen had shifted his home base from America to England after the production of “Indiscreet” in 1958, where he will remain until the early 1970s.\n\nWith Peck’s talent in “Arabesque”, Donen was able to bring out good characterization of the protagonist Pollack and used the antagonists and the plot to challenge Pollack at a greater pace, even though Peck falls short from the comic charisma of Cary Grant. In shooting action scenes, mainly during the run through the cornstalk field, Peck also had difficulty due to an old leg injury from a horseriding accident.\n\nDonen has expertly dealt with the shower scene limiting the frames showing Peck staring at Loren’s body parts too long that would create the risk of Pollack crossing the line of decency and become interpreted as a pervert. Peck also seems to know that casual glances are more sexy than staring.\n\nIn 1966 when “Arabesque” came out, having been elected the National Chairman of American Cancer Society, Peck would take a three year break from acting to devote his time on humanitarian causes. His next appearance would be in director J. Lee Thompson’s “Mackennas’s Gold” in 1968, a role reportedly offered to Clint Eastwood who turned it down to make his “Hang ‘Em’ High”, co-produced by Eastwood’s Malpaso Productions.\n\nApart from Sophia Loren, this rollicking adventure film also stars Alan Badel, Kieron Moore and George Coulouris. British stage/screen actor Alan Badel of “Salome”, “Magic Fire”, “Children of the Damned”, stars as the sinister Beshraavi.\n\nBorn in Rusholme, near Manchester in September 1923, Badel had graduated from the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1939 winning a Bancroft Gold Medal. Moore began his stage career with the Abbey Theatre in Dublin were he displayed his ability to speak Gaelic. His portrayal of Romeo to Claire Bloom’s Juliet at the Old Vic Theatre in London in 1952-53 was well noted. Badel’s performance as the sinister Negim Beshraavi in this film conveys the perfect subdued menace the role calls for.\n\nOnce described as “handsome in a slightly eccentric fashion”, Irish stage and television actor Kieron Moore (Kieron O’Hanrahan – 1924-2007) of “Anna Karenina”, “David and Bathsheba”, “The Green Scarf”, “The Thin Red Line”, with his dark Latin looks and brawny build, stars as Yussef Kasim. He was discovered by Sir Alexander Korda who whisked him out of the cast of Sean O’Casey’s Irish play “Red Roses for Me” in London.\n\nWhile acting in American films from 1930 to 50, British character actor George Coulouris (1903-89) was often cast in explosive roles. He had gained his training in acting at London’s Central School of Speech and Drama along with fellow students Laurence Olivier and Peggy Ashcroft.\n\nHaving performed in movies such as “Hotel Berlin”, “King of Kings”, it would be after his performance in “The Skull” that he would be cast in “Arabesque”, in the role of Professor Ragheeb. Coulouris won a National Board of Review “Best Actor” award in 1941 for his performance in “Citizen Kane”.\n\nThe other supporting actors are: John Merivale (Major Sloane), Duncan Lamont (Webster), Carl Duering (Prime Minister Hassan Jena), Ernest Clark (Beauchamp), Harold Kasket (Lufti), Gordon Griffin (Fanshaw), Larry Taylor (Mustafa), etc.\n\nThe film is photographed in Panavision by Kensington born Christopher (George Joseph) Challis (1919-2012), a good friend of Donen who would use Challis on six of his films during Donen’s British period in the 1960s. Challis was a technician on early British colour movies such as “The Drum”, “The Four Feathers”, before he became second unit cameraman on “The Thief of Bagdad”. He owes his knowledge in cinematography mainly to Georges Périnal and Jack Cardiff and would later become an essential member of the Archers production company of directors Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger which enabled him to experiment with creative cinematography. Although Challis received several nominations for BAFTA award for Best British Cinematographer, including for “Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines” (1965), he finally won it in 1967 for “Arabesque”.\n\nTo heighten the mystery of this thriller Challis’s camera work is full of dazzling styles that played with focus and disorienting camera angles, especially during the scenes when Pollack was in a drugged stupor. Very often images are shown through reflections on the body of the Rolls Royce, on glass of the low table, on the round side panel, through the aquarium glass, etc.\n\nApparently, Challis’ camera angles consistently favoured Sophia Loren, focusing attention on her chiseled facial features and statuesque figure looking luscious in gorgeous outfits of tailored cuts and rich materials.\n\nWhile the Art direction is done by (George) Reece Pemberton (1914-77) who specialized on TV series; make-up for the movie is carried out by British make up artist William (Bill/Billy) T. Partleton (1911-75) of “Christopher Columbus”, “The Prisoner”, “Sink the Bismarck!” fame. The film is edited by Frederick Wilson (“The Prisoner”, “Sword of Lancelot”). You may note the replica of a golden palm on Beshraavi’s desk – which could have acted as a perfect model for one of the prosthetic hands of the evil drug-lord Han of Bruce Lee’s “Enter the Dragon”.\n\nAmerican composer and songwriter Henry Mancini (Enrico Mancini – 1924-94) who had provided music for Donan’s “Charade” repeats his stylish music in this movie, as well. Educated at the Juilliard School of Music, Mancini was the arranger and pianist with the post-war Glenn Miller Band before coming over to Universal in 1952. He had composed music for “Touch of Evil”, “Days of Wine and Roses”, “Hatari”, “The Pink Panther”, “A Shot in the Dark”, “What Did You Do in the War, Daddy?”, etc. Audrey Hepburn’s song “Moon River” in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” was composed by Mancini to the lyrics of Johnny Mercer which won the Oscar for Best Song.\n\nFor the opening music of this movie, Mancini has provided a continuous procession of tones in a time honoured way laced with Middle Eastern tones to the stylish James Bond-ish title theme. There are several other themes, one of them is a powerful dotted rhythm, and another full of graceful charm, including the rapid running passages of the solo violin notes during the chase scenes to the Zoological Gardens, which are quite noteworthy.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Italian screen goddess Sophia Loren (Sofia Villani Scicolone) was basking in international stardom for sometime. She was avidly sought after by film makers such as Alfred Hitchcock, Joseph Levine, even, Arthur Miller, to the intense promotion by Carlo Ponti (1912-2007), her romance in blossom. Prior to her appearance in “Arabesque”, Loren had appeared in director Michael Anderson’s “Operation Crossbow” (aka: The Great Spy Mission – 1965), Daniel Mann’s “Judith” and Peter Ustinov’s “Lady L” (both in 1966) and was slated to appear with Marlon Brando in Charles Chaplin’s “A Countess from Hong Kong”. Chaplin had seen Loren in “Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow” and was enthralled by her.\n\nEven though, both “Judith” based on an unpublished (later published) novel by Lawrence Durrell modified according to Loren’s suggestions, in which she acted as an Austrian Jewess Judith Roth who, after surviving Nazi concentration camps, visits Israel in 1948 to track down her Nazi husband who had betrayed her; as well as, “Lady L”, in which she acted with Paul Newman and David Niven, both had fizzled out at the box office. However, for movie audiences, the statuesque Italian leading lady Loren whom writer Lawrence Durrell once described as “A sweet creature, great dignity and style”, symbolized Latin female sexuality.\n\nAlthough the 5 foot 8.5 inches tall Loren is one of the most beloved and recognizable actresses of the movie world who had worked with a long string of reputed directors and actors. But naturally, there is a small catch.\n\nActresses like Elizabeth Taylor, found the “Italy’s sensuous beauty” as their competitor. According to biographies of Liz Taylor and Richard Burton, being scared of “Miss-what’s-her-name” acting with Burton in “The V.I.P.s”, Elizabeth had pulled strings to have herself cast in the role. On another occasion, when Burton told Liz Taylor that Loren might take a role in “The Comedians” which offered a few numbers of love scenes with him, that picture was released with Liz in the role intended for Loren. Liz had even agreed to act in it, her seventh film with Burton, for half of her customary salary of $1 million thus enabling Burton to receive more salary than Liz for the first time, i.e. $750,000. In 1959,\n\nPeter Sellers had fallen head over heels in love with Loren when they acted in “The Millionaires” though Loren’s fundamental choice was Carlo Ponti, her keeper of the flame.\n\nWhen Donen approached Loren for “Arabesque” which scheduled to start production in England by the end of April, 1965, he did not have a script ready to show her. However, Loren was well aware of the works of Donen and furthermore, she always wanted the opportunity to work with Gregory Peck.\n\nBesides, Loren would be available in London after finishing her work in her second film for M.G.M “Lady L” by late April. For Loren and Ponti, January 1965 had brought fresh happiness when the French Premier Georges (Jean Raymond) Pompidou (1911-74) granted them with French citizenship which automatically enabled Ponti’s then estranged wife Giuliana to sue for divorce under French Law after six months of being a French citizen. Measuring up to the new citizenship, the 31 year old Loren was only happy to star as Lady Louise Lendale in “Lady L” shot in Paris, Nice, Monte Carlo with some scenes in Switzerland and England under the direction of Ustinov with whom Loren had worked as an uncredited extra in director Mervyn LeRoy’s epic film “Quo Vadis” (1951) starring Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr.\n\nFollowing the completion of “Lady L”, Loren was put up in a Georgian country house in Berkshire near Ascot for the shooting period from May to August in order that she has easy access to the locations at Ascot, Oxford, Pinewood Studios in London and other locations in the English countryside including at the Crumlin Viaduct, Caerphilly in South Wales while it was being dismantled. Caerphilly is, of course, amongst other things, famous for its cheese.\n\nSophia Loren has carried off the role of Beshraavi’s mistress Yasmin Azir with a quite charm and verve as Yasmin plays all the sides against each other, while her real loyalties will be revealed only at the end of the movie.\n\nOne time driving a Mercedes-Benz 230SL, she breezes through the movie as a Femme Fatale with her breath-taking beauty and stunningly alluring body elegantly attired exclusively by Christian Dior’s Marc Bohan who prepared a stylish wardrobe and related footwear (all of which would add to Loren’s personal wardrobe after the filming) on generous funding from Universal. In 1961 Marc (Roger Maurice Louis) Bohan had succeeded Yves Saint Laurent, who was called up for military service, at Dior where he would continue till May 1989 when he was replaced by Italian Gianfranco Ferrè setting stage for Ferrè to parade his exquisite flair for fashion.\n\nWith Sophia Loren’s taste usually excellent, if a bit expensive, Bohan wouldn’t have found a more willing patron than Loren who knew what it takes for star build up.\n\n“Arabesque” was nominated for BAFTA Award 1966 for Best Costume Design (Colour) but lost to Julie Harris of “The Wrong Box”.\n\nWhile Cinematographer Challis was very much impressed by the professionalism of Sophia Loren, she can also be game for fun. One of her biographies related an incident during the shooting of the shower scene when Peck had to hide next to her while she took the shower.\n\nTo put her at ease, Peck had told her not to feel embarrassed, that it’s all in the game. With her unflinching beautiful hazel eyes, Loren asked him what makes him think she would be embarrassed, then readily took the shower naked to Peck’s regal silence.\n\nIronically, both “Arabesque” and “Lady L” were released in May 1966 while Loren’s “Judith” was still in its release screening. Serious moviegoers found “Arabesque” a bit imperfect, and Loren was at the receiving end of resentment for adverse characterization of the Arabs in the movie.\n\nNevertheless, with the presence of an impressive star cast consisting of Peck, Loren, Badel and production crew of Donen, Challis, Mancini and of course, James Bond title designer Maurice Binder’s psychedelic visuals gracing the main titles, “Arabesque” is still fun to watch. Put your feet up and enjoy. Until next time, Ciao, Jo\n\n(PS: The DVD of this movie is available with main dealers such as amazon.com, TCM Shop, etc)\n\n(Text: © JS/Manningtree Archive)\n\nIt seems like only yesterday since I returned from Madrid in July, and today I am packing for yet another journey – this time back to Bangkok. The good side of packing is that it not only makes you take stock of the essentials you will need for the itinerary you have in mind, but also makes you realize that the next few weeks are not meant for a mundane or mediocre life. It will be days of life in hotel rooms, of room service, taxis, laptop, different timmings ……\n\nBangkok is not a Mr. Stranger to me – once a Bang (village) of thatched houses amidst the kok (wild plum) trees that eventually took the form of “Bangkok”. It is home to many of my friends and to my business connections whom we make it a point to visit almost every year since the last eleven years.\n\nThe people of Bangkok have a certain energy and personality, a certain charm and graciousness. Thai tranquility is the result of their supreme tolerance of others.\n\nTrue to its dictum as the Land of Smiles, we have had quite a good measure of momentous and happy moments there.\n\nThis would be our first Christmas in Bangkok even though we had a lovely time there for New Year back in 2006 having spent the Christmas of 2005 in Singapore. Being in Bangkok would mean that 2012 would be the second time since we moved into our present apartments that the Christmas decorations and the crib will not be set up.\n\nI will miss the beauty that would have surrounded me in the festive decorations throughout our house, illuminated with the glow of candles and fairy lights. We will also miss making mince pies in our house, and tucking presents in secret places. However, the Christmas tree, stars and angels have all appeared in their relevant places.\n\nTalking of angels, the other day I was playing Greek singer Panos (Panagiotis) Psaltis’ Aggele Mou (My Angel) while sorting out my suitcases. Now, that is a song with so much sadness within it that it tugs at your heart strings. In this poignant song that wafted out of my music system, Panos calls for an angel to come down to earth to give advice on how to heal his troubled heart.\n\nThen again, many a Greek songs have a peculiar melancholic aura that hangs around your head for a while when you first hear them – at least for me. Of the few singers from Greece of the 1960s I like, how can I forget Nana Mouskouri or Demis Roussos (Forever and Ever) whose songs capture the flavour and spirit of Greece perfectly?\n\nCarina has seen Nana Mouskouri (born Ionna Mouschouri) at a live performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London sometime back and, like the rest of the audience felt transported to Greece with Nana’s beautiful melancholic songs. The one song she liked in particular was the 1961 version of “White Roses from Athens” (Weiße Rosen aus Athen), which I too agree is a beautiful song.\n\nBorn to theatre usherette Aliki (Alice) and film projectionist Constantine Mouskouri in Chania, Crete in Greece on October 13, 1934, Nana Mouskouri’s education in music started at a very early age. Aiming for a career in the classical field, her lessons were rooted in piano, harmony and vocal. Conforming to her parents wish for her to become a classical artist, in 1950, she continued to pursue the same lessons at the classical Athens Conservatoire. In spite of this, when she heard the compositions of American Jazz music and blues, her interests took a turn to pop music and Jazz which would cast a strong influence in her musical career. She wanted to sing like Billie Holliday, Edith Piaf, Nat King Cole and Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nMaking her radio debut in 1956, she became the leading female vocalist on Radio Athens. In 1958, she met the renowned classical musician Mános Hadjidákis who had provided music for the movie “Never On Sunday” (Pote tin Kyriaki). In Greece, Mános Hadjidákis and Mitzi Theodorakis are the great poets of song. Although her shift from serious music prevented her from sitting for her final exams as she was not keeping with her classical studies, she formed a small jazz group consisting of friends and started performing as a songstress at the Tzaki, a “tavern” in Athens and later in various nightclubs in the Greek capital.\n\nMoved by Nana’s artistry, Hadjidákis went ahead to compose pop songs for her. Having done her initial recording in Greece, Nana went on to win honours at the 1960 Festival of Mediterranean Song in Barcelona (Spain). Her impressive performance against highly professional competitors brought her a recording contract with Paris-based Phillips-Fontana and many offers. It was the beginning of a shooting star called Nana Mouskouri.\n\nNana was soon to become popular all over the world as one of the greatest Greek singers. But before all this, when she was thirty-three, she embarked on a tour with Harry Belafonte throughout America which turned out to be highly successful. Belafonte had been looking for a partner having decided to part from Myriam Makeba (yes, the one who sang “Pata Pata” in 1957). In her “Memoirs”, Nana writes about how she embarked on this tour.\n\nIn order to audition Nana, whom Belafonte had seen on Eurovision, had sought the help of Quincy Jones and Irving Green to have her brought over to New York. Although Nana met up with Belafonte and his wife Julie for dinner at Trader Vic’s at the Plaza Hotel, the next day he was absent “due to a last-minute problem” when she appeared for audition at his headquarters on Sixty-Seventh Street. Taking stock of the situation, Nana had put all her heart into that audition, her voice resplendent with melancholy, nostalgia and dreams. The audience gave her a standing ovation after she sang half-dozen Greek songs followed by a couple of her favourite French songs. Even Belafonte, who in fact had posted himself in the adjoining room listening to her in order to avoid having to get rid of her if she disappointed him, turned up in the audition hall to cheer her at the beginning of her last song. The next day, she won the part – stepping into the shoes of Myriam Makeba.\n\nIn 1962, Quincy Jones produced her first U.S album titled “Nana Mouskouri in New York” which also became a great success. That album featured a dozen songs including “That’s My Desire”, “No Moon at All”, “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes” (written by Jerome Kern and Otto Harbach for the operetta “Roberta” (1933)), “I Get a Kick Out of You”, “But Not For Me” (Written by George and Ira Gershwin for musical “Girl Crazy” (1930)), “Almost Like Being in Love”, etc.\n\nThe voice is the most natural instrument that exists. It is with vocal music that the history of music had begun. Nana has a voice that is flawless and perfect, surprisingly mellow, far reaching and dynamic. Without a trace of an accent, she had sung in Greek, German, Italian, Spanish, French, Dutch, Hebrew, Maori, Welsh and English, perfectly at ease as a native of the country whose language she sings. This is one quality that would act as an important factor in her success and propel her into a life surrounded by musicians, assistants, sound engineers, technicians, press officers and a private secretary.\n\nWinner of numerous gold and platinum records, Nana’s beautiful voice and songs sours beyond the national boundaries, winning her endless admiring listeners from all over the world. She had earned this acclaim by simply being herself, her style devoid of any allegiance to that of any other renowned singer. Europe’s answer to the American songbird Barbra Streisand, Nana’s records met up with good sales in Continental Europe and the UK while in Germany, they were once constantly appearing in the top of the hit-charts.\n\nDuring a career that spans half a century, Nana has recorded over 1,500 songs, selling more than 300m records. When she sings, she appears to dig deep into the depths of the lyrics, her voice blending them into magical melodies. Sometimes described as “the voice of dreams” and “the voice of nostalgia”, her songs sparkle with that inimitable Mouskouri touch like the unmistakable tones of a bouzouki. In “A Little Paper Moon” (Hartino to Feggaraki), Nana whispers in confidence of the emptiness of life when her beloved is not with her; “Never On Sunday” (Ta Pedia Ton Pirea) provides a glimpse of the life of people in the suburbs of Athens. Then there is: “Where Has My Little Boy Run Away” (Pou Petaxe T’Agori Mou), “My Love is Somewhere” (Kapou Iparhi Agapi Mou); “You Were Sweet and Kind” (Issoun Kalos); “My Dear Little Mother” (Manoula Mou); “Behind the Rose Bushes” (Pisso Apo Tis Triandafilies); “Hello Love”; “Dance Till Your Shoes Fall Off”; “Only Love”; “Love Minus Zero/No Limit”; “Even Now”, “The Last Rose of Summer”; “Feelin’ Groovy”; “Land of Dreams”; “Christos Genate”; etc…. the list of songs are endless. With an essentially pure yet complicated voice, her songs are delivered with a proud modesty, always striving for that perfection regardless whether the lyrics she sings are tragic poetry or pedestrian commercial phrases.\n\nAs a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, she had helped raise funds to help children. In March 2010, having served as a member of the European parliament for five years from 1994 until 1999, she offered her annual pension of 25,000 euros to tackle the crippling economic crisis of Greece, pledging it until debt-laden Greece climb out of its economic black hole.\n\nThere is always music in our house. I have always found it wonderful for relaxation – even just a little background music when I work would provide me with the emotional charge. I have a couple of Nana’s albums (LPs) and for the rest of her songs, for the time being I will have to depend on the Internet.\n\n“At Christmas, play and make good cheer, for Christmas comes but once a year,” wrote Thomas Tusser four hundred and fifty years ago. Now that Christmas is around the corner, its message of peace and goodwill is loud and clear. The joys of giving and sharing; of cards and Christmas trees; of family reunions and good friends meeting once again – that’s all part of the essence of Christmas. At this time of hope – of joy – of love, I will be remembering many of the happy days; of days of laughing conversations; and other treasured times of good and bad now past. And I would welcome that peace which comes down to earth during this time of the year to find a resting place in my heart.\n\nBut what is Christmas time without Christmas songs? For every Christmas we add new decorations to our existing collection. Likewise, we fondly carry over a tradition of choosing one main Christmas music album for each Christmas season. Last year, it was the Sinatra family.\n\nThe year before, we were entertained by the album of cherished carols by The Hamburg Students’ Choir who had made those recordings on the Christmas Eve of 1955 during a service attended by British Armed Forces in Hamburg.\n\nThis year it will be Nana Mouskouri who will provide an overall mood which is encompassingly mellow. I do not have “The Christmas Album” of Nana but that would be available at MBK or elsewhere in Bangkok. I am sure, Nana’s “The Christmas Album” would provide the perfect musical accompaniment for this Christmas season, especially since it contains the German versions of “Silent night” (Stille Nacht heilige Nacht), and “O Christmas tree” (O Tannenbaum) and “O come all ye faithful” and “Hark the herald angels sing” in English.\n\nLobby of The Mandarin Oriental Hotel, Bangkok\n\nNow that we are leaving the well-padded perimeter of predictability of our home to be amidst the many activities in the fascinating Krung Thep, the “City of Angels” (Bangkok), I wonder when I will be able to make my next post. But I would think of this break as the rose bush that is cut back in the winter so that it may grow strong in the spring. However, the one thing I know for sure is that I will find time to visit the blogs of my great circle of friends and enjoy the company of each one of you during this wonderful season of the year.\n\nMoon in the sky softly creeping\n\nOver the town from above\n\nAnd I lie awake hardly sleeping\n\nSo lonely for only your love\n\nEven now, each night, I remember\n\nDays of summer when blossoms filled each bough\n\nIn the cold, gray days of December,\n\nMy darling, I miss you even now\n\nWhen will I see you again?\n\nCome to my arms where you belong\n\nMy world will be empty till then\n\nFor you are the words to my song\n\nEven now, each night, I remember\n\nDays of summer when blossoms filled each bough\n\nIn the cold, gray days of December,\n\nMy darling, I miss you even now\n\nIn the cold, gray days of December,\n\nMy darling, I miss you even now\n\nCiao, Jo\n\n(Lyrics of song: “Even Now” by Nana Mouskouri can be heard in YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA2MYrElKco )\n\n(Music albums of Nana Mouskouri are available with main dealers such as amazon.com, HMV, etc)\n\n(Text and all photos (except of Nana Mouskouri and album sleeves): © JS/Manningtree Archive)\n\n(At Suvarnabhumi Airport, Bangkok – January 2013)\n\nThe jingles, bells and whistles have faded – the calm has set in around me. Arriving back in Cochin was like a locomotive train pulling into the last station after a long journey, letting out the steam and settling down.\n\n(Cochin, Kerala)\n\nBut my mind is always travelling. After all these years of visits to Bangkok, that mysterious appeal of Bangkok still pulls me to it. There are many special people in there that I care about – not too many places in there I can go without someone saying, “Hi, It’s good to see you back, Jo” or similar. Missing someone is just a part of moving on…. after all, Goodbyes are not forever.\n\n(At Mandarin Oriental, Bangkok)\n\nBack home, the wind has scattered one month’s deciduous leaves on the ground. But this is not unfamiliar to me. Then again, there is the blissful tranquility and peace of our home – the old, familiar pillow to rest the head on. When we are able to find tranquility within ourselves, only then it is worthy to seek it elsewhere too. I had often found it in the twinkle of a smile, in the presence of my loved ones, in the solitude of a church, up the hill at Le Celle in Tuscany.\n\n(View of Tuscany – taken in Assisi)\n\nToday I wish to write about Le Celle, a Santuario of San Francesco di Assisi situated above Cortona. It is one of the most distinctive hermitages of medieval Franciscanism – a place that draws you close to God, whoever and whatever you believe that to be.\n\n(View of Tuscany – taken in Assisi)\n\nTuscany is a place where, more than anywhere else, I breathe easily. It was in Firenze at Il Porcospino, a Trattoria owned by our good friends Valerio Lo Cascio and his lovely wife Elvida where Valerio suggested that we visit Eremo Le Celle.\n\n(Valerio and Elvida)\n\nThat lovely autumn day appeared perfect for visiting this pious hermitage for which our friendly abbots of Basilica de San Antonio in Padova had so much praise. Carina and Bianca were enthralled when they heard of this place.\n\nWe have had a good number of wonderful meals and hearty times at Il Porcospino. There prevailed a homely ambiance exemplified by an efficient staff serving Tuscan cuisine. I had read somewhere that the most exquisite food was served for the Medicis in Firenze, especially during the time of Lorenzo de’ Medici (1449-1492). Situated right opposite the entrance of Cappella Medici, Il Porcospino seems to have gained certain competence in their quest for the cuisine Lorenzo il Magnifico savoured.\n\nAs we got into Valerio’s four-wheel drive, their black Labrador, Asia, jumped in and took his place in the luggage area where he was safely tucked in. Well, San Francesco loved birds and animals – Asia would be welcome there.\n\nA momentous event occurred some eight hundred years ago which was to affect the course of history for many people to this very day. This was the moment when a young man named Giovanni “Francesco” di Bernardone (1181-1226), born into wealth, realized that he was personally called to his vocation – to follow the way of the apostles in poverty and simplicity. This little pauper known as Saint Francis of Assisi who cultivated austerity, but had retained his love for singing, is not a stranger to any of us.\n\nSan Francesco is the embodiment of the spirit of Christian romance. We know of his belief that love alone, not suffering, can bring us in unity with God. We know that he had this great intuition to not keep for himself the inspiration that came to him but to pass it on to a community…..\n\nEven though Asia had remained quiet throughout the ride, at times, resting his doggy-long snout on Bianca’s shoulder, or looking out through the windshield, once we started climbing the five km road through endless sloping ranks of vines and olives up to Cortona, he showed signs of impatience to get out of the vehicle.\n\nPast Cortona, on the well paved path of the villages that wind among settlements on the hillsides where there is no traffic at all, Valerio allowed him to run before our car, something Asia apparently enjoyed, which is absolutely impossible in the streets of Firenze.\n\nThe Etruscan city of Cortona with its medieval and Catholic influences, offers an interesting archaeological element to the visitor. Dominating the entire Valdichiana, this walled city with streets and buildings dating from ancient times offers wonderful view as far as Lago Trasimeno. In “Aeneid III and IV”, Virgil called it “…mother of Troy and grandmother of Rome” while in 1993, Pope John Paul II regarded it as“… a marvelous city where everything speaks of God – the nature, the mountains, the woods…”\n\nYou have to pass by Cortona in order to reach Le Celle and Chiesa di Santa Margherita located above it. Situated around 80 km from Firenze, at about 600 meters above sea level on the border between Tuscany and Umbria, it is the birth place of many artists, namely Pietro da Cortona (Pietro Berrettini, 1596/7–1669) who designed the silver urn in the 17th century to contain the body of the great Franciscan Saint Margherita (1247-1297) which is on a windowed casket on the high altar of Chiesa di Santa Margherita. Likewise, artist Luca Signorelli (1445/50–1523) whose important works can be found in the Museo Diocesano, was also born here.\n\nCortona is home to a good collection of Etruscan and Roman bronzes, Athenian and Etruscan pottery, and ancient coins which can be viewed at Museo dell’Accademia Etrusca in the Palazzo Casali. The Bistecca Festival (Sagra della Bistecca) is held here in mid August which is in homage to the delicious char-grilled Bistecca alla Fiorentina made from Chianina cattle. The city is featured in the book and movie “Under the Tuscan Sun” (2003) starring Diane Lane.\n\nOne of the first places of the friars, Le Celle is located just five km from Cortona, backing on to Mount Sant’Egidio. I was told that, more than 30,000 visitors leave behind their routine of daily life and hike or ride up to this hermitage each year. This is hardly surprising since the moment you step into its premises; you could feel the air of mysticism that engulfs it.\n\nI have visited a few sacred places allied to early Franciscanism. Though no two monasteries are alike, Le Celle, ranks amongst one of the most prominent of them where you can experience the beauty and tranquility of the uncorrupted nature.\n\nIn the absolute silence that cloak this area, you could feel the mildness and wholesomeness of the air, you could hear the rustling of the wind, the natural sound of the running water of the stream, the chirps and calls of birds in vocal communication, see the green meadows and flowering pastures, well-watered gardens, useful growth of various trees…… Indeed, the sense of peace Le Celle exudes is almost tangible.\n\nLe Celle’s architecture has a predominantly medieval character to it, similar to Cortona and the habitations in the surrounding areas. Devoid of much artistic value, it has a very humble appearance.\n\nConstructed in an irregular manner during a period spanning 1200 to 1600 without a pre-established design, it epitomizes the poverty and simplicity of the early Franciscan architecture which gives it a charming appearance amidst the natural beauty of the surrounding leafy mountainous area – thickly populated by trees and bushes including age-old oaks, spruce, acacia, beech, sweet chestnut, cypress, parasol-pine or rows of maples and olive groves with River Vingone streaming on one side.\n\nThe sanctuary became known as Le Celle after Francesco and his companions chose it as a temporary place of domicile in 1211, a few years after his conversion. To Francesco, it was a period of two halves, one was down-to-earth, the second inspired and imaginative. As per his custom, Francesco used to spent long periods in solitary and secluded places in silence and prayer because he felt it offered him better atmosphere to be with God and converse with Him.\n\nWhile he was preaching in Cortona, inspired by the brotherly love and peace spread by Francesco, a young noble named Guido Vagnottelli offered him great hospitality in his house. Impressed by the devotion and humbleness of Guido, Francesco was only happy to receive him into his Order – no resume, internship experience, and credentials such as extra certification in specialized skills. Having given away all his wealth to the poor, Guido soon embarked on a rigid discipline of Franciscan ideals at Le Celle.\n\nYears later, San Francesco’s charisma would also conquer the heart of young Margherita who was born in Laviano near the Castiglione del Lago in Umbria but spent the second part of her life in Cortona. She was fascinated by the Saint’s life which reminded her that you cannot convince other people of what you say unless your own life is in accordance with it.\n\nSimilar to “Blessed Guido”, Francesco’s words also penetrated the hearts of many citizens of Cortona, springing spiritual enthusiasm in them. On many occasions they had listened to the priests without actually hearing anything. When they listened to Francesco, they actually heard.\n\n(Statue of San Francesco at San Damiano, Assisi)\n\nSeeking his future presence amidst them, the inhabitants of Cortona generously offered him the desolate site of a small chapel dedicated to the Archangel Michael which existed at the foot of Mount Sant’Egidio since the Lombard invasions. We can see a similar pattern here when Count Orlando Cattani of Chiusi donated the Mount of La Verna to Francesco in 1213, which became Tuscany’s holiest pilgrimage center.\n\nThe small chapel situated by the clear stream, the waterfall (together with the stream, it becomes active during winter), caves, ravines and trees, was at that time surrounded by few small cottages of hermits and peasant dwellings.\n\nHere heaven seemed to reach down to earth. Francesco found it to be a suitable place where he could direct his mind completely to God – away from the world, peaceful, with the essential solitude and water. The area was engrossed in nature, beautiful and untainted, which was joyful to Francesco for he loved beauty in everything, in life. What he saw then at Le Celle is rather what the visitor sees today.\n\nHaving chosen a cave, he built his little shelter there with stones. This is the little cell, Le Celle in which he briefly lived. We can see a boulder here which is the remainder of that early cave of San Francesco.\n\nWe enter Le Celle after we cross the middle bridge known as Ponte Barberini, so named for having been built by the Capuchin novice Antonio Barberini (1607-1671), the cardinal-nephew of Pope Urban VIII (Maffeo Barberini – 1568-1644).Ponte del Granduca which is a bit downstream is named after Gian Gastone de’ Medici (Giovanni Battista Gastone, 1671-1737), son of Cosimo III de’ Medici and the last Medicean Grand Duke of Tuscany, who constructed it in 1728.\n\nThe first impression as we step into Le Celle is of peace, silence, plainness and good sense. Inside the cell where San Francesco stayed and prayed, there exists his wooden plank which was his cot, in its original place.\n\nAbove the door of the cell is an ancient manuscript: “Take off your shoes because the place in which you stand is holy ground.” Surrounding Francesco’s cell, other poor little huts were constructed at that time, out of natural caves or with branches of trees to accommodate his companions who underlined the similarity of their souls, to lead a life of meditation and spiritual friendship.\n\nSome documents cite that San Francesco visited the sanctuary in April, 1215 for Easter after having spent the period of Lent in Isola Maggiore, the second largest island on Lake Trasimeno in Umbria. In Chapter VII (105) of “Vita prima S. Francisci”, his first biographer Tommaso da Celano set down that, during April 1226 while in Siena for treatment of the infirmity of eyes, Francesco fell gravely ill and upon recovery, he had gone to Le Celle with Brother Elias where he fell ill again. He was escorted to the Church of St. Mary of Porziuncola (later Basilica Papale di Santa Maria degli Angeli Porziuncola) where he will die peacefully at the age of forty-four on October 3, 1226. It was at Porziuncula where he founded the Franciscan Order of Friars Minor back in 1209.\n\n(La Porziuncola)\n\nDuring that final stay at Le Celle, his body bearing the marks of stigmata which he received in September 1224 on the mountain of La Verna (Monte Penna), Francesco had documented the ideals he had believed in and his last wishes. Probably, Le Celle holds the honour of being the place where he dictated his Testament.\n\n(Basilica Papale di San Francesco in Assisi)\n\nAfter completing the construction of the Lower church forming part of Basilica di San Francesco on a hill at the west side of Assisi in 1230 (Foundation stone was laid on July 17, 1228 and construction started as per design and supervision of Brother Elias, by then the second Minister General of the Order of the Friars Minor), in order to promote the growth of the Order and to conserve the precious places where Francesco and his first followers had stayed, in 1231, six year’s after the death of San Francesco, Elias undertook a number of restoration and expansion works at Le Celle strictly according to the virtue of poverty loved by San Francesco.\n\nOn the upper floor, he arranged eight cells measuring two meters by two that opened onto a long corridor that cut across its center. A door marked no: 4 with Elias’ picture above it, is traditionally believed as his cell (one of Elias’ two residences, the other being in Assisi). It is believed that Sant’Antonio di Padova, who was educated and specially fitted to preach, was also a visitor to Le Celle during this time.\n\nCaught in the differences between Pope Gregory IX and excommunicated Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (1194-1250), Elias was forced to retire to Cortona in 1239 where he built a church and monastery dedicated to San Francesco.\n\nWith the departure of Elias, Le Celle gradually lost its significance though some hermits lived there, including a community of Fraticelli (Little Brethren or Spirituali). This group of Friars Minor observed extreme proponents of the rule of San Francesco, mainly regarding poverty, his original lifestyle. Fraticelli developed into a separate entity after they were declared heretical in 1296 by the Church under Pope Boniface VIII (1235-1303).\n\nIt was during the period of Fraticelli that the present church was constructed at Le Celle, but after their departure in 1318, the convent was left abandoned though no one proposed that it should be abolished.\n\nBy 1537, the hermits from the newly founded Order of Capuchin Friars Minor, offshoots of Franciscans, took their turn to occupy Le Celle after it was granted to them by the Bishop of Cortona, turning it into the seat of their novitiate.\n\nThey led a life of extreme austerity, poverty and simplicity – as closer to the ideals of San Francesco as was practicable, working among the poor and teaching the Christian life by living it.\n\nRetaining the original architectural style, they enlarged the convent, constructing the highest part on the existing structure which now houses some twenty cells in the size of two meters by two on the upper level, corresponding to the number of novices who enter the Order each year to engage in prayer and work.\n\nThe present chapel which the visitor will find adjacent to San Francesco’s cell was the Dormitory of the first community which was transformed into an Oratory dedicated to the Stigmata of San Francesco in 1614.\n\nIt has a small altar, devoid of art objects, but only an essential picture of Madonna and Child, hanging above it. Similar paintings, including one by Italian painter Simone Pignoni (1611-1698), can be seen elsewhere in the sanctuary.\n\nThe building also houses a Bibliotheca to cater to the religious and cultural needs of the brothers. Of the good number of old theological books, you could see leather bounded volumes of “Compendium Theologiae Moralis” by Fr Gabriele De Varceno. Apart from vegetable gardens, the front and sides of the buildings are adorned with beautiful lawns and hedges, well maintained.\n\nThis atmospheric and evocative place has changed little since the Middle Ages. The humble friars of Le Celle are not bounded by its walls, but live their lives in the public eye, inspiring others to follow their example.\n\nThe laity could observe the lives of the friars as they went on in a continuous succession of prayer and work. Rituals like daily procession after reciting Matins, etc are observed in their monastic life.\n\nA placard here displays the timing of their daily routine in which private prayer, public reading, communal worship and manual work are balanced.\n\nOver the centuries the sanctuary grew famous among the believers as a godly inheritance of the past. The serene ambiance, the simplicity of the buildings, the way of pious life, the contents of the library, the regular activities of preaching and catechesis, the grooming of the novices, the signature look of the friars – all reflects austerity and the original poverty and compassion towards every suffering person – aspects that reach out and touch the discerning visitor.\n\nEremo Le Celle heartily welcome homeless people who seek their solace or anyone who want to know and assimilate the very essence of Francesco’s unique vision and wish to involve in the life of their community.\n\n(Valerio with Asia)\n\nThey provide facilities for spiritual retreat to priests as well as to independent groups of visitors in the little houses beside the convent for limited period of time. A friar, who generously allowed us to take photographs on the site, told me that some couples even chose the hermitage to bless their wedding. The charm of San Francesco remains irresistible.\n\nThere were fewer visitors today. But unlike the lot I have observed in some places of worship in Italy where they simply chatter and click photographs; loiter around in flip-flops, wearing revealing tops and trousers that reach just below the knees, that impious phenomenon was missing here.\n\nThis is not a place for sightseeing and the air of serenity draws your attention to the notice that enjoin strict silence – for almost everywhere you walk, San Francesco’s spirit reappears.\n\nAs I walked out into the side courtyard, I could see Asia happily moving around on the paved ground in the company of Bianca. He was staring at the swallows darting by the old oak tree. Upon seeing me, he came running towards me. How happy he appeared in this special place…\n\nAt this point, I could hear bells calling the friars to pray. It is time for us to leave – for now. I believe I will come back here another time and I know I would be welcomed to this magical experience. When you start believing, you will discover that all things are really possible. San Francesco was a house without windows or doors. We all could come and go – in peace. Ciao, Jo\n\nPS: Asia left for dog heaven in November 2012.\n\nPaintings Courtesy: Wikipedia Public Domain:\n\n1) “Êxtase de São Francisco de Assis “ (1642) by Jusepe (José) de Ribera (1591-1652);\n\n2) “San Francesco di Assisi “ (1597-99) by Lodovico (Il Cigoli) Cardi (1559-1613);\n\n3) “Estasi di Santa Margherita” by Jacopo Alessandro Calvi (Il Sordino – 1740-1815)\n\n(Photos: © Joseph Sebastine-Carina Simeon-Bianca Celine Diane-Andrea Lalis Sebastine/Manningtree Archive.)\n\n(Aka: La Mujer Pirata – La Regina dei Pirati – A Raínha dos Piratas – Die Piraten Königin – Technicolor – 1951)\n\n“Ahoy, landlubbers! Come abroad the good ship “Sheba Queen” and lend an ear to Anne of the Indies”\n\nSo much has been written about the buccaneers of the high seas. Even though the deplorable activities of pirates are rightly condemned by the humanity, world literature has nonetheless romanticised them with stories depicting the daredevil deeds of pirates such as Sir Henry Morgan, Blackbeard, etc and correspondingly lionised them in many movies produced in the Americas and Continental Europe.\n\nThe West Indian buccaneers were initially hunters of pigs and cattle on the islands of Hispaniola and Tortuga until they became pirates after being driven off by the Spaniards. Long before Johnny Depp flashed on screen as Captain John Sparrow doing his rounds with the “Pirates of the Caribbean” series, swashbucklers in the kinds of Elliott Dexter, Douglas Fairbank, Errol Flynn, Burt Lancaster, Gregory Peck, Louis Hayward, etc. ruled the high seas. This doesn’t mean that the period was devoid of dashing females wielding deadly swords and thrived in the sunshine. Historians tell us that a significant minority of historical pirates have been female, who were acclimatized to the wild ways and conquered the seas.\n\nThe 1945 film, “The Spanish Main” by director Frank Borzage (The Big Fisherman) featured the fictionalized account of the real-life cross-dressing buccaneer Anne Bonny (1698-1782), a daring Caribbean femme fatale who joined the crew of pirate John “Calico Jack” Rackman after having an affair with him. Reputed to be the first film of RKO Radio in the Technicolor, starring Paul Henried, Maureen O’Hara and Binnie Barnes in the role of Anne Bonny, it told the story of Dutch sea Captain Laurent “The Barracuda” Van Horn. Shipwrecked on the coast of Spanish-governed Cartagena, he escapes from the hangman’s noose and takes up piracy for revenge against Spain. The film registered impressive profit in the box-office and won George Barnes an Academy Award nomination for Best Colour Cinematography.\n\nIn 1946, a short story by Herbert Ravenel Sass titled “Queen Anne of The Indies”, appeared in the Saturday Evening Post which generated enough excitement amongst the New York publishers and Hollywood studios prompting Sass to draw up a movie treatment of the story in 1948. Originally slated to be a Walter Wanger (Walter Feuchtwanger – 1894-1968) project starring the indestructible redhead Susan Hayward, this fictionalised treatment failed to generate necessary enthusiasm in independent producer Wanger due to its larger budget that he sold the story rights to 20th Century-Fox. (Some confusion prevails here regarding the different treatments of the story prepared for Wanger). At that time, Wanger was also busy with a grand project for the comeback of Greta Garbo who was on long retirement. But when “Anne of the Indies” was finally released in 1951, Wanger was in the “cooler” for having shot and wounded his wife Joan Bennett’s agent Jennings Lang when he found them together in the MCA (Music Corporation of America) parking lot.\n\nIn early 1950, at Fox’s instance, a new script was prepared by Romanian born screenwriter/playwright Arthur Caesar incorporating unused footage shot for “The Black Swan” (1942) starring Tyrone Power. The studio assigned George Jessel to produce while tests were done with Patricia Neal and Valentina Cortese for the title role.\n\nHowever, Darryl F. Zanuck, Vice-president in charge of production for 20th Century Fox was still unsatisfied with the script that a revision was done on it by Philip Dunne, a contract writer at Fox since 1936, sprucing up the character of Anne. When the film would finally appear on screen, Philip Dunne and Arthur Caesar are given credit for the screenplay.\n\nNaïve, darkly sensual actress Linda Darnell was also considered for the role of Anne before it finally went to American actress Jean Peters (Oct 15, 1926 – Oct 13, 2000). Hailing from East Canton in Ohio, Elizabeth Jean Peters grew up on a small farm, majored in literature and won a screen test with 20th Century-Fox as prize for winning the Miss Ohio State Pageant title in the fall of 1945. Owing to a contract with Fox, Jean moved to Los Angeles and later acquired a small part in “I Wonder Who’s Kissing Her Now” (1947). However, it would be her role as Catana Perez (replacing Linda Darnell) in director Henry King’s “Captain from Castile” (1947) that will bring her star treatment and public attention though the film grossed net loss because the studio spent more for it than the market could afford.\n\nAfter a brief slump in her popularity, the 5’ 5” (166cm) Jean had pursued the studio and convinced them to cast her as “Anne of the Indies”. It was a down to earth, unglamorous role– exactly what she preferred since sometime earlier the studio had put her on her first suspension owing to her refusal to don sexy roles. However, being the current romantic interest of the legendary billionaire Howard Hughes, beautiful Peters with brown hair and green eyes must have found it easy to step over that suspension. Even though she had a celebrated romance with Hughes in 1947, their marriage will take place only in 1957 after living with him off and on for a decade.\n\nJacques Tourneur was given the director’s hat for the project in January 1951. Essentially a small-budget director with a penchant for the macabre, Tourneur had a reputation to direct movies on various genres since he always accepted all the scripts offered to him.\n\nHaving finished directing “The Flame and the Arrow” (1950) starring Burt Lancaster and Virginia Mayo, Tourneur was in the right mood for yet another swashbuckler. With a secured contract with Fox and devoid of interference from producer George Jessel, the film went into production at the 20th Century-Fox Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nSynopsis: Once the credits flashed over the screen, an establishing note on the state of affairs of the 17th century Indies is shown: “Less than two hundred and fifty years ago, the last of the great pirates wrote their names in blood and fire across the pages of maritime history. This is the story of a buccaneer Captain whose name for one short year struck terror in the hearts of seafarers and merchants, from the ports of the Caribbean to the great trading houses of London….”\n\nAs the movie begins, we are shown the names of two English ships, Royal Charles and Sea Lady are being stricken off a register of ships for having been destroyed or sunk by the notorious Captain Providence. We then cut to: the deep ocean off Antigua where the English vessel Gemini is preparing to repel the attack of Anne’s flagship Sheba Queen. As the two ships draw nearer and the canons started firing, Anne suddenly appears on the deck of her ship while her men valiantly fought the English, their swords flashing in fierce combat. Even Anne joined her men in the fight. Before long, the English Captain had surrendered.\n\nInside her cabin, Anne threw the enemy’s flag on top of the wooden desk and was pleased to learn from Dr. Jameson that he had attended to all the wounded. At this time he wanted to tend to Anne’s wound which he was sure would leave a scar on her beauty. Anne was not unfamiliar to scars most of which she had received from the English. But she is not a wench to brood over her scars, has chosen not to show her pain, even now, at her moment of glory though the fact remained that she had lost her sailing master in this assault.\n\nShe invited the doctor, her confident, to the deck where her crew were making the prisoners walk the plank – a sight, she was certain, would put some iron in the alcoholic doctor’s soul. The Captain of Gemini was grumbling that he had struck his flag hoping to receive some water. He protested to Anne about the merciless treatment meted out to the prisoners by her men. Anne retorted that she had learned such mercy from the English. Did they show mercy to her brother? They had hanged him in chains in the wharf of Port Royal with all the English just spitting on his face – she snapped at him.\n\nThe hatred towards the English that had grown in her heart for the death of her brother, was one of the many scars Anne accumulated in her life that made her reject her femininity. The Captain was given the opportunity to express his last words. All he had to say was that, her brother was a pirate and he deserves the end that he got as Anne will deserve hers. But Anne knew that she had chosen to live with that. “By the veins of your nose you have drunk your king often in wine, now drink him in salt water” With that reply, she ordered the Captain to walk the plank.\n\nIt was then she noticed the handsome man in irons being led to the plank, the upper part of his body exposed. They have found him imprisoned in the English vessel which meant he is not a friend of the English. Questioning him, she learned that he is a Frenchman named Pierre François. When she introduced herself to him, it was a revelation to him. Caught in the propaganda that surrounded Captain Providence, Pierre had never expected the buccaneer Captain to be a woman. Furthermore, he had least expected it when her palm cracked on his face for having disrespectfully addressed her as “mademoiselle” rather than in her proper title of “Captain” which displayed the forcefulness of the identity she had chosen.\n\nIt was revealed that Pierre was the owner/master of the Bordeaux registered Irish privateer, Molly O’Brien, captured by the English. He is being sent to England to stand trial for having captured too many English ships. Anne had allowed her men the pleasure to make their prisoners walk the plank except for Pierre. Being sea-smart, Anne knew that Pierre, a sea artist, would make a suitable replacement for the navigator she had lost and that was what she did to the displeasure of her Scottish first mate Red Dougal, who had been delegated by Blackbeard to protect her. As for Pierre, who is fond of life, it was not a hard choice to make when his choice was between joining the buccaneers or walk the plank.\n\nWhen the booty from the Gemini was shared with her crew, Pierre was permitted to choose something for himself. While Pierre decided a woman’s dress, Anne laid her claim on a sword with a long blade, the virility of which reflected on her authority. However, Pierre’s choice had kindled her curiosity to make her enquire if he has a wench somewhere. Pierre would only reply that he is a Frenchman. Anyhow, she let him know that the sword was selected for Captain Teach, Blackbeard, a great sea-rover of a soul whom she is certain she would find in Nassau where they plan to get the supplies. The Sheba Queen headed for Nassau.\n\nAnne is a protégée of the notorious English pirate Captain Edward Teach (aka. Blackbeard ca. 1680–1718). Since childhood, he was father, mother and schoolteacher to her and her half-brother. Although she knew that her father was English, his name never passed the lips of her mother who succumbed to death when Anne was young. She was called Anne Providence owing to her birth on New Providence Isle, a night to Nassau town.\n\nThe Black Anchor Tavern in Nassau looked a beehive of boisterous merriment. Apparently, the tavern was taken over by Blackbeard and his men and their women for partying and their idea of fun appeared to be to laugh, shout, fight, bear-wrestle, break things, get drunk, etc in the dreadful manner possible. The enormous figure of Blackbeard sat at the head of a wooden table with a woman on his lap, drinking heavily and having a great time.\n\nIt was during the bear-wrestling that Anne and her entourage walked in. At the sight of Blackbeard, Pierre had tried to excuse himself to go off for some business in Nassau, but reluctantly stayed when Anne assured him of her protection. So excited was Blackbeard to see her there, that he said she’s like a Northeaster after a calm.\n\nAlthough Blackbeard had doubts about Pierre which was also intensified later by Dougal, his main interest was focused on Anne and the sword she presented him. When all of his men shied away from being a willing partner to the impulsive Blackbeard to help try the new sword, Anne was ready to let him try to carve her. A fierce but friendly duel of swords broke out between Anne and Blackbeard in which Anne displayed some playful but competent skills of swordsmanship but it was pretty obvious that he could have won over Anne easily. However, when Blackbeard was momentarily distracted, Anne grabbed the chance to win; a trickery which Blackbeard merely laughed off in a fatherly manner. Then again, Anne’s glory was short-lived when she learned from Dougal that Pierre had slipped out of the Tavern while the duel was on. The confidence she had placed in him has been displaced.\n\nLater, confronted by Anne in her cabin, Pierre didn’t provide her with a proper explanation about his absence, to satisfy her doubt about his loyalty. He had neither gone to see a wench, nor is he a spy because he knows nothing of her plans. All Nassau knows that she’s in the port. Suspicious that he is hiding a secret, she ordered Dougal to put him in irons. Subsequently, he was tied up on the deck and mercilessly flogged until Dr. Jameson convinced her to stop.\n\nDr. Jameson was evidently dismayed for having been ordered by Anne to search Pierre’s cabin where he had found half of a map tucked inside his mattress. Though Anne cannot read, she can read from patterns. Assisted by Dr. Jameson, she finally figures out that the map is a link to Captain Henry Morgan’s treasure. When Morgan (ca. 1635-1688) captured Panama City, he had taken a king’s ransom which has not been accounted for.\n\nHaving matched the piece of map with her main map, she questioned Pierre, now lying on the wooden floor of her cabin, drained from “the taste of the cat”. Pierre had no qualms in telling her that he had bought it five years ago from an inn-keeper on the Bordeaux waterfront who found it in the body of a lodger of his. Once Anne assured him to make him equal partner with her, Pierre opened up further and related to her that his men in Porto Bello had told him of a Portuguese in Nassau trusted by Henry Morgan, In fact Pierre had been taken prisoner by the English while he was heading to Nassau to meet the Portuguese. At Nassau, Pierre had learned from the Portuguese man that a man called Pedro Mendoza living in Port Royal in Jamaica possessed the other half of the map.\n\nIt was then Dr. Jameson remarked to her that since she now knows what Pierre knows, she could very well kill him and go after the treasure on her own. But Anne would have none of that, for she had given Pierre her word. And that counts.\n\nPort Royal was the lion’s den – the Headquarters of England’s Caribbean Squadron. That’s where they will go once they careen the hulk of Sheba Queen encrusted with hardened barnacles, to restore the ship to its proper speed. Dr. Jameson confirmed that the parchment and the ink of the map looked authentic to him.\n\nAs Blackbeard had taught her, Anne had carefully docked her ship in a secret cove, known only to Blackbeard and Anne, ideally positioned to cannon and command the passage through the reef while her ship lay inoperable.\n\nLater, while she was walking along the beach with Pierre, she was surprised to learn that he was born in Paris. Anne advocated that he can take her there as a partner after they have lifted the treasure. But overriding this subject was her curiosity to know for whom he had chosen that yellow dress.\n\nHe had obviously noted the anxiety in her question and told her that it is for no one in particular – perhaps for a woman he hoped someday to meet. Having caught with her guard down, she quickly pulled herself up to her rank, but her sudden change in manner essentially gave away the tell-tale sign of affection for him that was growing in her heart.\n\nThe following day, Pierre walked into his make-shift cabin and found Anne trying on the yellow corseted dress he had chosen from the booty. This is the moment for which that dress was made for. She looked like a breath of spring. Even though her face looked unaffected from his sudden intrusion, the thoughtful Frenchman knew that he had awakened the feminine side of this ruthless pirate queen.\n\nWell, she can’t underestimate his ability to get through to her heart and to melt away her defences. But he would use his power responsibly. Pierre helped her tie the back ribbons of the dress, an act which acted as the precursor to a conversation that stirred the woman inside her, exposed her inner feelings she was silently weaving around Pierre. She dared him to tell her “how a Frenchman, a gentleman, made love?” knowing that it would draw him to her. Soon, they merged into a passionate kiss.\n\nIt seems all good things in life are not meant to last. The expression of their “burning” desire turned out to be short-lived and frustrating as Dougal suddenly walked in and caught them in the act.\n\nOn hearing the news about an approaching ship, Anne’s spyglass confirmed the arrival of Blackbeard’s flagship “(Queen Anne’s) Revenge”. How happy she appeared in welcoming Blackbeard with Jamaican rum. She listened to him saying that he had looked for her in Tortuga and had realised that she’s docked here to careen.\n\nWithout losing much time, Blackbeard accused that Pierre is a traitor. He is Lieutenant Pierre François La Rochelle of the French Navy. He had seen Pierre at Martinique when the French hanged his colleague Sam Austine from a yardarm. Confronted once again by Anne, Pierre explained that everything which Blackbeard told was true. He merely neglected to mention about the commission because the memory of that chapter was painful to him. He was cashiered from the navy in disgrace. He had witnessed the hanging only because the entire officers were ordered to be present. Anne is in command here, and he is not on Blackbeard’s deck. She can be assured that he will serve her loyally.\n\nDisregarding her support for Pierre, Blackbeard’s sword struck out at Pierre. Abruptly, Anne’s sword lashed out at Blackbeard with dynamic forcefulness. During the angered spat of words that followed, Anne slapped his face- in front of his men. She ordered him and his men off the island. The line has been crossed. Blackbeard never forgets an insult. Now there will be war between them.\n\nAs Blackbeard and his men left the island, Anne ordered Dr. Jameson to care for Pierre lying unconscious on the ground. Before she moved off from Pierre, she couldn’t resist planting a kiss on his forehead.\n\nThe Sheba Queen was safely anchored off the coast of Jamaica. Given that Anne was denied from going to the island in his place to obtain the other half of map from Petro Mendoza, she arranged with Dougal to take Pierre on a row boat to leave him ashore at the Portland Point and wait for him on the beach. She gave Pierre some English Guineas to pay the man and advised him to offer Mendoza a share of the treasure if he insists for more.\n\nAt Port Royal, Pierre went straight to “The Governor’s Tavern” where the English Aristocrats were engaged in smoking, drinking, playing table games or other things such men usually do in such places. Pierre was recognised as “Captain La Rochelle” by the Maitre d’ and promised to arrange the people whom Pierre wanted to meet urgently.\n\nIn a dark room upstairs, he met a pretty woman we soon discover to be his wife Molly La Rochelle. He confirmed to her that their plan has succeeded and that the legendary Captain Providence is a woman. They seal their reunion with a kiss before he was called downstairs to meet up with the English Naval officers who have engaged him to entrap the pirates.\n\nThe English were rejoiced at the news that the Sheba Queen was anchored off Portland Point and will remain there till daybreak. And, of course, they appreciate that Captain Providence suspects nothing though they were rather surprised to learn that the notorious pirate is a female. With this information in hand, the English attack Anne of the Indies …..\n\nAs Darryl Zanuck once said, “Success in movies boil down to three things: story, story, story.” The final climax of the film was subject of deliberations since Zanuck was not satisfied by the motive provided for Anne. The result was that Dunne suggested shooting the climax in different ways. However, after the shooting was completed, having found that the present ending was unsatisfactory to the audience, the ending was again modified with further retakes. According to Tourneur’s contract which stipulated that the production was to be completed within fifteen weeks, the production of “Anne of the Indies” must have been wound up before May, 1951 since by then Tourneur was supposed to be in Argentina for the production of “Way of a Gaucho”.\n\nAdventure movies call for a directorial and an acting style which is well known to adventure directors such as Raoul Welsh, Howard Hawks, John Huston, Richard Fleischer, Henry Hathaway, Michael Curtiz, and Jacques Tourneur. Shot in Technicolor by Cinematographer Harry Jackson and ably edited by Robert Fritch, director Jacques Tourneur’s film features restraint and admirable performances of his stars in well made up sets, lighting and studio locations.\n\nThe film truthfully portrays Anne as a ruthless pirate who has denied her femininity and doesn’t know what it means to be a woman, or to be loved. In order to illustrate Anne’s crisis of identity, Tourneur used a scene in the beginning of the film to establish Anne’s strong heart and the softness of her bosom when Dr. Jameson tends to her wound. Despite Jean Peters’ cute and pretty looks which occasionally subdue her efforts to make Anne look dangerous and ruthless, her performance with an athletic agility is flawless though, couple of times, her cheerful countenance has appeared rather teasing.\n\nLouis Jourdan’s performance in the role of Frenchie merited critical acclaim. Ever since Zanuck had that terrible polo ball accident in late December 1941, he had switched his interest in sport to croquet which he used to arrange on the lawn of his house in Palm Springs. Frequented by a cross-section of Hollywood society, international celebrities, etc, his lawns became the croquet capital of California. Jourdan who was a contract star of Fox and best of the regulars to Zanuck’s house, was found to be perfect fit for the role of Pierre.\n\nLouis Jourdan’s movies conjure up an image of him as a suave, dashing, romantic charmer. In spite of this, the Marseilles born Jourdan (aka Louis Gendre) had also managed to appear in villainous roles. Beginning his acting career in the French film “Le Corsaire” (1932), Jourdan became a star after producer David O. Selznick cast him in Alfred Hitchcock’s court room drama “The Paradine Case” (1947) for which Franz Waxman was the music director. But his finest performance before he acted in “Anne of the Indies” was in Max Ophuls’ “Letter from an Unknown Woman”.\n\nBritish actor Herbert Marshall (1890-1966) with considerable stage experience acts as the alcoholic Dr. Jameson who helplessly hovers around watching Anne trapped in her crisis of identity. The mannerism of the wise and philosophical Dr. Jameson in the scenes where Anne displays her determination to acquire the respect she deserves; when she is in conflict with her human emotions; is well portrayed by Marshall.\n\nIn the role of the boisterous Blackbeard, the heavyset, stage character actor Thomas Gomez (Sabino Tomas Gomez – 1905-1971) made use of the opportunity to drink, laugh, turn tables, and swash his sword to realistically portray the larger-than-life of the renowned pirate.\n\nGomez was a member of the Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne theatre group before he ventured into movies. An aficionado of gourmet dining and a close friend of Jean Peters, he had co-starred with her in “Captain from Castile”\n\nTall and hefty, England born actor James Robertson Justice (James Norval Harald Robertson Justice – 1907-1975) with whiskers and booming voice had completed a series of films, viz. “The Black Rose” and “The Magnet” (1950), “Blackmailed”, “Pool of London”, “Captain Horatio Hornblower” and “David and Bathsheba” (1951) prior to his role as Red Dougal.\n\nThe mannerism of Dougal when Anne chose Pierre as her sea artist when she knew nothing of him; his confidential talks with Blackbeard and Dr. Jameson; his ever watchful eyes on Anne; the suppressed outrage on his face when he caught Anne and Pierre kissing – have all been perfectly portrayed by Justice.\n\nHailing from a show biz family, the 5’ 2” (157cm) Debra Paget (Debralee Griffin) obtained an acting contract from 20th Century-Fox at the age of 14, debuting in “Cry of the City” (1948). Having earned proficiency in speaking from Helena Sorrell, the dramatic coach of 20th Century-Fox, and fairly active in movies at that time, she co-starred with Louis Jourdan and Jeff Chandler in director Delmer Daves’ “Birds of Paradise” which also hit the screens in 1951.\n\nAlthough Paget’s role in “Anne of the Indies” is confined to few dark scenes, her effervescent beauty lights up the darker scenes which are rampant in many of Tourneur’s films. Appearing pale and innocent, Paget has nothing much to do except look distressed and wear a few moments of brave face when she antagonizes Anne over Molly’s rights over her husband.\n\nOther members of cast are Francis Pierlot (Herkimer), Sean McClory (Hackett), Holmes Herbert (British sea captain), Byron Nelson (Bear handler), Douglas Bennett (Bear wrestler), Mario Siletti (Auctioneer), etc.\n\nNotwithstanding the lesser budget, the film features sets and props with truthful authenticity, there are Naval cannons, antique swords, males’ earrings and some of the guns used by the pirates and the English are even Flintlock pistols.\n\nThe artistic and talented art directors Lyle Wheeler (1905-1990) and Albert Hogsett have faithfully created the set pieces, though standard and familiar, with the expertise of set decorators Thomas Little and Claude Carpenter.\n\nLynn had started his career at M.G.M when David Selznick hired him to work under production designer William Cameron Menzies on “Gone with the Wind” following which he ran the art department of Twentieth Century-Fox from 1944 to 1960. Lynn won five Academy Awards for Best Art Direction after having been nominated twenty-nine times, four of which in 1951.\n\nWhile the makeup is by Ben (Benjamin Emmet) Nye, the film’s wardrobe is directed by American Costume designer Charles Le Maire (1897-1985) who ran the Wardrobe department of 20th Century-Fox from the early 1940s. For this film he had collaborated with Costumes designer Edward Stevenson (1906-1968) who himself started in Hollywood from 1922 and became the chief designer at RKO from 1936-49.\n\nAlthough most of the costumes are standard pirate and navy gear which kept up the atmosphere, the feminine costumes for Jean Peters and Debra Paget and for some extras are very minimal. Apart from the yellow dress Anne wears inside the make-shift cabin, the other one is a white nightgown shown in very dim lighting as she gazed at the glittering sea.\n\nGerman composer Franz Waxman (Franz Wachsmann – 1906-1967) with orchestration by Edward Powell have provided a rousing score that blend well with the romantic nature of the story. Other than montage, music is one of the two most “invisible” contributing arts to cinema and Waxman is renowned for his very close understanding of when music should appear in the narrative.\n\nArriving in America in 1934, Waxman provided his first original score for “Bride of Frankenstein” (1935) after which he worked for two years with Universal Studios, before moving to M.G.M and later onto Warner Bros until he won the Academy Award for “Sunset Boulevard” (1950) and “A Place in the Sun” (1951).\n\nYears and years later, this routine swashbuckler evoked some deliberations in seminars and conferences because of the identity crisis of the lead character. There were also some writings including an essay titled “Femininity and the masquerade: Anne of the Indies”.\n\nConsidering the lack of depth in the psychological density of the main characters and also in the thinly plotted story, I would think this movie was just another job for Tourneur.\n\nI would also like to think that Tourneur made this film without any alternative agenda other than to make a simple pirate tale – some 81 minutes of entertainment which has all the virtues of the genre: sea-battles, swashbuckling, adventure and drama with a twist showcasing the protagonist as a female dressed in male attire to suit the environment of the buccaneers of the story; and also, to differentiate this film from a series of swashbuckler films featuring male leads various studios were chucking out during 1940s and 50s.\n\nAnne of the Indies cannot be compared to a lively, colourful period film featuring a protagonist with the lighter-than-air agility of Douglas Fairbanks or an extrovert, acrobatic hero portrayed by Burt Lancaster. Nevertheless, this old-fashioned harmless family movie has an underlining story of Anne going through her identity crises, searching for love which is quite unfamiliar to her.\n\nAnne’s love is her weakness and to us it has made her human, even though she is riddled with faults. By making Anne endearing to us, lovely Jean Peters leaves a memory of a breed of heroines long gone from our screens. Until next time, Ciao, Jo.\n\n(This review is dedicated to the memory of lovely Jean Peters)\n\n(Text: © JS/Manningtree Archive)\n\nThe first time I saw Bangkok’s Suvarnabhumi International Airport was in April 2009– a bird’s-eye view from the multi-layered-glass window of an airborne Boeing 777-200 of Singapore Airlines.\n\nHaving taken off from Singapore’s Changi Airport for a journey covering 878 miles (1413 kms), we had cruised over the Gulf of Thailand and once above Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province in mainland Thailand, we flew past the new Bangkok airport before the airplane took a circle for the final approach for touchdown. Until the night of 27-28 September 2006, Don Muang Airport was the primary port of entry to Bangkok by air, a responsibility the new “airport of smiles” took over when Suvarnabhumi was officially opened on September 28.\n\nNow back here once again in early January 2013 to catch our outbound flight to Singapore, the place was milling with people returning home after the New Year holidays.\n\nAlthough the exterior architecture of Suvarnabhumi airport looked modern and high-tech, I could see that the starkness of the concrete, light-weight steel and clear and e-coated glass of the interior is rightfully neutralised by an indelible stamp of “Thainess”.\n\nConstructed in accordance with the design of Nuremberg (Germany) born architect Helmut Jahn of Chicago based Murphy/Jahn Architects who won the design competition held by the Thai Government in 1994, the airport is truly a combination of transportation centre and shopping mall.\n\nIn order to create a building that required low energy but benefited from cutting edge state-of-the-art technology, the architects collaborated with two Stuttgart engineering firms, Werner Sobek Ingenieure (for structural issues) and Transsolar Energietechnik (for climate control). The result was a huge complex of functionally separate buildings, unified under a large roof trellis on steel support structures with exposed precast concrete elements.\n\nBuilt as per innovative designs with new materials and systems of advanced technology, the airport has ample provision for future growth. The structures are protected from direct tropical sunlight while the interior climate is controlled with minimal air-changes.\n\nDesignated high traffic areas of the floor are provided with highly wear resistant finishes. In spite all this, the airport attracted the grievance of culture-conscious citizens who found the design devoid of the values and aesthetics that supports the Thai tradition and culture.\n\nThe Thai government, always engaged in shaping and promoting traditional art and “Thai culture”, soon swung into action.\n\nThe result was the formation of an expert committee drawn from the best of competent specialists in Thailand.\n\nAware that the salient features of traditional Thai architecture like sloping multi-tiered roofs, soaring towers and pointed spires, and so forth, is not suitable for large scale project like an airport terminal, the cultural leadership decided to create a symbiosis of Thai traditional flair and modernity by embellishing the interior of the structure.\n\nA series of art representing the various aspects of Thai culture, history and landscapes, etc were set up inside the airport which was adeptly designed to let in lot of controlled daylight.\n\nHuge statues of mythical figures and masked dance drama from Ramakien to mural works to classical oil paintings to Thai pavilions representing different styles of traditional houses, formed a pattern of cultural fabric that spread inside the airport.\n\n(After the destruction of Ayutthaya (see picture above) by the Burmese in 1767, the Indian epic Ramayana was rewritten (not translated) in Thai format by Phraphutthayotfa Chulalok, King Rama I (1737-1809) calling it the Ramakien which unmistakably reflects local values.)\n\nWhile the airport and those who pass through it are favoured to be under the protection of these mythical figures, these representations offer a last-minute aide-memoire of Thainess for the departing foreigner – whereas to the returning Thais, it is a welcoming reminder of their unique and engaging culture.\n\nAccording to recent media reports, the airport is geared for its second-phase (which includes a new terminal and third runway) and also possibly a third-phase infrastructure development projects to boost its capacity.\n\nAlthough some dark clouds are visible against these projects due to complaints from residents of the area not in favour of noise and pollution, this would hopefully be surmounted to the satisfaction of all concerned by the generally genial Thais who are renowned for their knowledge and practice of diplomacy.\n\nBeyond the Immigration Control on the second floor in Terminal 2, at the bottom of the gently sloping white-tiled concourse area, we will finda huge centrepiece of art. Called “Churning of the Milk Ocean” (aka: Samudra Manthan) and designed by an artisan of Thailand’s Department of Fine Arts, it measures 21 metres long, 3 metres wide and 5.5 metres high.\n\nIt was reportedly funded by the Chairman of King Power, reputed to be the World’s Top Ten Travel Retailers, whose Duty Free outlets occupy an extensive area of retail space in this airport.\n\nI was photographing this centrepiece and making notes from the official placard placed in front of it when a feminine voice suddenly greeted me.\n\n“Sawasdee”\n\nA brunette in her late thirties, she was taller than I am, more broadly built. Her hair was pulled back in a bun, (Well, it is too hot outside to wear it down) and I could smell that special something which Coco Chanel once phrased “that unseen but unforgettable fashion accessory” – the perfume.\n\nFew moments ago, I had seen her reading that placard. She greeted me politely with a wai, her head slightly bowed. I always liked a Wai – the gesture of respect performed with folded palms before the chest which has its origins in India.\n\nLeaving my camera dangling on its sling, I smiled and returned her wai which she had performed with immaculate accuracy.\n\n“Is this important?” Her smile flashed, beckoning at the centrepiece. No shilly-shallying – simple and straightforward.\n\n“Certainly”\n\nTo me, this sculptor is every bit as fascinating as the Tower of Gustave Eiffel or Dome of Filippo Brunelleschi.\n\nI soon learned that it was my acute concentration and also as her knowledge about the sculpture’s association with my country which made Khun Mirella (name changed for reasons of privacy), a native of Barcelona, unable to resist the question.\n\nI must admit, I was as curious as Mirella when I first saw this. There is something about it that draws the eye. I had pointedly checked on the story depicted in this decorative art inspired by religious devotion. With my Nikon in hand and some free time to spare, I wouldn’t have found a better chance to devout my attention to it though by this time of the day, the sunlight was a bit off to the back, obscuring the frontal features.\n\nThe tableau depicted an episode from the “Hindu Puranas” (Hindu literature). This legend takes many versions in different adaptations including a bass-relief at Angkor Wat in Cambodia.\n\nThe tableau showed a three-headed snake (Vasuki, aka Naga) coiled around a mountain (Mount Mandara) on which stood Lord Vishnu (Phra Narai/Witsanu in Thai) incarnated as a huge turtle (Kurma Avatar). The tail-end of the snake was held by a group of Devas (demigods depicted in human form) while the Asuras (Daityas, demons with demonic faces and coloured bodies) held Vasuki by the hood.\n\nBy pulling the serpent to both ends in a tug of war, the Devas and Asuras were churning the Ocean of Milk to extract the nectar of immortality (Amrita) sought by the two groups. This information is readily available on the placard.\n\nFor a detailed version, the scene depicting “the Vishnu Kurmavatara and the Churning of the Milk Ocean” saga is set in a time too long ago. While passing through Lord Indra’s kingdom, Sage Durvasa Muni chanced upon Indra, the king of Devas, who was travelling on the back of his white elephant Airavata and present Indra with a garland. Indra placed the garland on the trunk of his elephant which the animal simply threw away to the ground.\n\nHaving considered this a great disrespect to him, the Muni, supposed to be an incarnation of Lord Shiva and known for his short temper, cursed Indra, casting him down from dominion over the three worlds (Trailokya). Consequently, Indra and the Devas were bereft of all strength and fortune. Taking advantage of this weakness, the Asuras, with the help of Bali, gained control of the universe, defeating the weak Devas.\n\nAccepting the advice of Lord Vishnu, the Devas formed an alliance with Asuras to jointly churn the Ocean of Milk and share between them the nectar (amrita) of immortality derived from the process. But Lord Vishnu had promised the Devas that he would ensure that only they would drink the amrita and obtain immortality to defeat the Asuras.\n\nUsing Mount Mandara as the churning rod, and Vasuki, the snake as the churning rope, the Asuras opted for the head-end of the snake while, once again according to Lord Vishnu’s advice, the Devas took hold of the tail-end since those at the hood are destined to be fumed by the poison emitted by Vasuki, the Emperor of Nagas.\n\nDuring the process of the churning of the cosmic ocean for thousands of years, the Devas and Asuras pulled the snake’s body back and forth rotating the mountain.\n\nAt one stage, when the mountain began to sink, Lord Vishnu took his second incarnation in the form of a turtle to support the mountain on his back.\n\nIn addition to the deadly poison Halahal which Lord Shiva drank but was timely stopped from swallowing by Goddess Parvati; numerous opulent things were also produced by the churning, one of which was Dhanvantari (Heavenly Physician) carrying the pot of the nectar of immortality, Amrita.\n\nAfter a bit of intrigue, Lord Vishnu, having taken the form of the beautiful femme fatale Mohini (the only female avatar of Lord Vishnu), helped Devas to acquire the Amrita and the Asuras are banished into the underworld.\n\nFast forward to my present location at Suvarnabhumi airport, Mirella had introduced herself as one of those rare and inevitable people, who can design their own clothes, use an electric drill and paint.\n\nIn 2008 when economic crisis hit Spain, her business had taken the slump. However, she had used considerable expertise and a modest budget to transform her daunting ladies-wear business into a thriving shop selling Chinese goods at reduced prices that was appealing to the cost-conscious Spanish customers. These inexpensive goods where imported from suppliers in China who were drawn to her to avail the low-cost gateway for their products to the European Union. As part of her annual “quick discussion” visits to China since 2009, it is her custom to take ten days break in Thailand on her return journey home.\n\nWhile we were talking, I had noticed that apart from few tattoos of Chinese dragons, she had tiny diamonds on posts impaled through piercings in the crease of her left nose and under the lower lip. But it was her split tongue that held my attention.\n\nMuch later I couldn’t help thinking about the object behind this “signature make-up” she has created on her to “make my own imprint on life – my own inimitable style” It’s not that she would go to any length to be in fashion – it’s the quest for individuality! I am glad that she was receptive to my suggestion to mention about our encounter in one of my future posts.Thank you.\n\nMirella had done the tongue bifurcation (forking/splitting) during last year in England though she got the idea from a Dutchman she had met at the Chatuchak Weekend Market (aka. Jatujuk or J.J) of Bangkok. That was in 2009.\n\nShe had stayed at a hotel in Sukhumvit Soi 11, Bangkok’s expat hub for clubbing and dining. It was her first visit to Bangkok and she had hit the city hard and had lot of fun – a typical tourist experience.\n\nSukhumvit Soi and Chatuchak Market are not unfamiliar to us. Chatuchak Market is fun – a mammoth market covering an area of about 35 acres containing more than 15,000 shops and stalls.\n\nIt generates nearly 175,000 visitors on a market day, and an estimated 30 to 32 million Bhat per day.\n\nA place where professional and amateur art-lovers and artists meet, the items on display consists of a vast array of art objects and antiques such as Japanese, Vietnamese and Chinese porcelains; Khmer bronze and pottery; accessories; household items; cloths; leather goods; potted plants; pets such as dogs, cats, birds, aquarium fishes; native food, amongst other bric-a-brac.\n\nThough the prices are marked in most cases, you are free to ask for a proper discount since the market follows the art of bargaining long practised in Asian countries including Thailand.\n\nWe had come across stalls in this market for tattoos where you will be fascinated by the various traditional and mythical designs available for decorating the body.\n\nOnce I had found a stall run by a team of Indian Mehndi artists offering traditional, modern, contemporary and retro Mehndi styles. But I don’t think such body modification as tongue-splitting is available there though at Chatuchak Market you could find practically anything.\n\nHaving had another closer look at the sculpture, Mirella had bid farewell and left for her boarding gate. Looking past the aircrafts parked on the tarmac of the parking bay, I could see that the sky was clear and cloudless – something I preferred when I fly.\n\nAs I sat in the air-conditioned commons sipping my iced drink, I saw Carina beckoning at me to join her at the Blue Elephant Duty Free.\n\nThe couple of bags in her hand were clear indication that she had found the special curry pastes and seasoning sauces we couldn’t find at the MBK (Maboonkrong) Shopping Mall yesterday.\n\nThat is the one good thing about Bangkok. Being a national treasure house and Thailand’s spiritual, cultura"
