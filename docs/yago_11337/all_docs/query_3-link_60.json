        "text": "Brief Biography of Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong\n\nDetails\n\nCategory: PeaceEnvoy Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong\n\nPublished on Wednesday, 31 July 2013 08:58\n\nWritten by Super User\n\nHits: 19497\n\nThe Life and Work of the World Peace Envoy\n\nHon.

Mr. Sudharm Kosolkitiwong (deceased)\n\n7. Mr. Sunai Kosolkitiwong\n\nPlace of Birth : Samphanthawong District, Bangkok, Thailand\n\nFAMILY\n\nThe forefathers of Mr. Tecksue Sae Chua were noblemen in China. His birthplace was in Tia-ang district, Canton county, Kwangtung province, South China. Mr. Tecksue was a fellow college graduate with the former President Chiang Kai-shek. He served the government in the fourth highest position after President Chiang Kai-shek. He was a nationalist and a man of justice. In the great troubled times of China, the country was still full of corrupted government officials. Mr. Tecksue was in serious dispute with President Chiang Kai-shek and disagreed with the government’s style of administration. Upon learning that President Chiang Kai-shek had issued an order to kill him, he fled to Thailand in 1932. He then earned his living as a doctor of Chinese traditional medicine.\n\nEARLY LIFE\n\nWhen Dr. Suchart was a young boy, he liked talking about the subject of Dhamma and rendering compassionate services to his fellow beings. He was not interested in learning in school but liked to learn more from others. After his father passed away when he was 9 years old, his mother had to work alone to raise her 7 children.\n\nIn his youth, the young Suchart liked playing under the Great King Rama I Memorial Bridge and swimming in the Chao Phraya River. Once, while swimming, he was seized by a cramp, unable to swim and sinking. Before he lost consciousness, he felt something lifting his body up, keeping his face and nose above water. His body floated along the river until a Chinese coffee seller’s boat passed by and rescued the boy Suchart from the water.\n\nThe memory of this incident of his miraculous survival remained strong in his mind. When Dr. Suchart was a grown-up and had to do public service, he firmly believed that the reason for him being alive was to render his services to others, therefore he did not die young.\n\nWhen he was 10 years old, he stole 10 bahts from his mother and bought sweets for his friends. His mother found out about it and punished him by tying his right ankle with a piece of rope and attached the other end to the front door of the family’s house to humiliate him. From then on, young Suchart made a vow not to ask for any money from his mother. Thanks to her compassion, she sometimes left one or two bahts for him on his bed. On the days that he had no bus fare, he yielded to the necessity and took the money.\n\nSince then, young Suchart did not go to school. He earned his own living getting paid for work: for example, serving noodles and coffee to patrons at footpath shops. Some nights, he returned home at one or two o’clock to find his mother still waiting up for him.\n\nAt the age of 14, he left home to work as an apprentice in trading shops. In the meantime, he continued his primary education at Wat Ratchaburana (Wat Lieb) School for Adults. He was able to not only pass but skip grades as well. After only two years of his studies, he completed grade IV primary education.\n\nAt the age of 17, he worked with Mr. Sahas Mahakoon at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. During that period, a movie businessman brought a film to pledge for a loan. With young Suchart’s assistance, he met Mr. Sahas Mahakoon and the loan was granted. As a token of thanks, that man gave young Suchart an amulet of a Buddhist monk named Luang Poo Tuad (Changing Salty into Fresh Water), which was widely regarded as sacred. After receiving it, he kept it without paying it much attention. Until one day, young Suchart had an urge to test the miracle of his amulet. He then went to see a Buddhist monk in a temple and asked him about the method of invoking the sacred force of the amulet. That monk advised young Suchart of the right procedure.\n\nWhen he began the procedure as suggested, he felt a big ball of light flying straight at his face which made him unconscious. After coming to his senses, his friends who witnessed the experiment told him that Phra Bodhisattva (a Would-be Buddha) Luang Poo Tuad came but he did not believe them. Afterwards he tested it again and again more than a hundred times until the Holy Spirit of Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad really possessed young Suchart’s body and said, ”This man wants to test me, so I will take him on as my medium.”\n\nSTART TO CURE SICK PEOPLE WITH HIS DIVINE POWER (1961-1964)\n\nWhen the news spread out that the Supreme Spirit of Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad used the body of young Suchart Kosolkitiwong as his medium, many sick people who suffered from all kinds of illnesses that were unable to be cured by doctors came to receive treatment from the divine power of Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad, through young Suchart. Many of them were thoroughly cured.\n\nAfter a while, young Suchart was not willing to work for the Spiritual World so he planned his escape and fled to Laos but the Holy Spirit of Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad still followed him and possessed him as before. During that period, there were political problems between the two countries and people were forbidden to go across the border. Dr. Suchart then challenged the sacredness of Luang Poo Tuad that if he was really sacred, Luang Poo Tuad must help him to return safely to Thailand. He was then miraculously returned home. It was at that time that he reached the mandatory age to be drafted into the armed forces. and served in the army for one year and six months.\n\nSERVING IN THE ARMY\n\nPrivate Suchart was drafted on March 23rd, 1964 and served in the First Anti-aircraft Regiment. Firstly, he was trained to man the anti-aircraft guns for four months at Camp Thanarat, Pranburi District, Prachuapkirikhan Province. Then he was transferred to an anti-aircraft unit. The official transfer letter from the Commander of Thanarat Camp read in part “P.V. Suchart Kosolkitiwong is a very good private with wonderful brain. A rank of Lieutenant Corporal is fit for him.”\n\nWhile being a soldier, P.V. Suchart was very diligent, disciplined, and obedient to orders of his Commander. Sometimes, he felt in him divine power from the Spiritual World. On one occasion, while listening to lecture, P.V. Suchart raised his hand for permission to speak in front of the class. With the permission, he then spoke about strategy which was a matter far beyond the knowledge of a private. This puzzled and surprised the audience. On a certain hot day, P.V. Suchart said that he would call for rain. He then went to sit in the open-air, prayed a hymn and it then rained.\n\nSERVING THE SPIRITUAL WORLD\n\nAfter Dr. Suchart left military service, the Supreme Spirit of Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad (Changing Salty into Fresh Water) possessed Dr. Suchart’s body and said that the situation of the country was so bad that he requested Dr. Suchart to establish Samnak Poo Sawan (the House of Divine Sages in Heaven) to assist the country.\n\nSamnak Poo Sawan was officially founded on Visakha Puja Day in 1966 (Wednesday 4th May 1966) at a rented house No. 118/2 Soi Ana-mai, Sook Sawasdi Road, Bangpakok Sub-district, Rat Burana District, Bangkok, Thailand.\n\nSAMNAK POO SAWAN IN THE WORLD\n\nThe ten-point objectives of Samnak Poo Sawan (the House of Divine Sages) are as follows:\n\n1. Help relieve the physical and spiritual sufferings of all mankind;\n\n2. Help lessen defilements in the minds of selfish human beings;\n\n3. Help abolish dogmatic beliefs and ignorance in the minds of men;\n\n4. Help uphold social justice in the world;\n\n5. Help protect the existence of peace and monarchical institutions;\n\n6. Help promote the progress of religions by all available means;\n\n7. Help support all meditation practitioners in search of Nirvana;\n\n8. Help cooperate with the efforts of the Would-be Buddha (Bodhisattva);\n\n9. Help bring ethical morality to the minds of the younger generations;\n\n10. Help confirm the belief in “Life after death” to frighten sinful men.\n\nSamnak Poo Sawan in the Spiritual World is situated in the fifth realm of heaven named Nimmannaradi. It is the House where Divine Sages, Devas and Brahmas of all the heavens who have knowledge and experiences gather together for listening to and practising Dhamma.\n\nOn August 7th, 1965 at 12.30 hrs., at Baan Na-Bua, Renu Nakorn District, Nakhon Phanom Province, the Communist Party of Thailand declared the use of arms for killing Thai people. When the Devas and Brahmas who attained enlightenment during their life on earth, particularly those who were enlightened in Thailand knew that Thais would kill and destroy fellow Thais, they tried to seek ways and means to descend to earth to help human beings. The Three Realms of the Spiritual World: the World of Brahma Gods, the World of Heavenly Bodies, and the World of Misery Beings had decided at the end of year 1965 to found Samnak Poo Sawan in the world. This was done with the purposes of protecting the independence of Thailand, making Thai people religious while appreciating Dhamma through their mind purification, and lessening of defilements in their selfish minds during these times of calamity.\n\nThe Three Immortal Souls of the Great Masters of Heaven who descended to work at the House of Divine Sages in the earthly world included:\n\n1. The Supreme Patriarch Kurupajarn, (Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad Changing Salty into Fresh Water), the important Supreme Patriarch during the time of the old capital, Ayutthaya, about 400 years ago.) He is the Great President of Samnak Poo Sawan in the earthly world.\n\n2. Tao Maha Brahma Jinna Panjara, (the right-hand disciple of the Most Venerable Moggallana Mahathera during the time of Lord Buddha, over 2500 years ago.) He is the Counsellor and Ceremonial Lord of the Spiritual World.\n\n3. Somdej Phra Buddhacharn (Toh) Brahma Ransi, (the Most Famous Ecclesiastical Monk during the early time of the Rattanakosin period about 100 years ago.) He is the Prime Director of Samnak Poo Sawan.These Three Supreme Spirits from the Spiritual World descended to work regularly\n\nat the Centre by possessing human medium who lived in pure and noble ways of life.\n\nDr. Suchart Kosolkiiwong became a medium for the Three Supreme Spirits of the Great Masters. He was chosen by the Spiritual World to do its work and whose karma in past lives twined with those of the Three Great Masters. His karma also tied with Thailand, as he was born in Thailand many times before including his present life. He was therefore chosen to help protect Thailand and the Thai people to remain forever Thais.\n\nDr.Suchart himself lived an ascetic and celibacy life, ate vegetarian meals, and conducted himself as a holy man by regularly practicing meditation at a schedule set for him by the Great Masters.\n\nTHE PEACE ENVOY OF THE WORLD OF DIVINITY\n\nIn 1973, the Spiritual World appointed Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong as the Peace Envoy of the World of Divinity.\n\nLater on, when the world’s tensions intensified and troubles existed everywhere, the work of Samnak Poo Sawan was then expanded to promote true peace in the world.\n\nTHE WORK AT SAMNAK POO SAWAN\n\nPhra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad requested that Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong resign from all professional jobs in order to work at Samnak Poo Sawan and devote himself to help the human world. At that time, he already believed wholeheartedly that the Holy Spirit of Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad really existed and all works were of the Spiritual World. So he prepared his body and mind to be able to immediately receive the divine power from the Spiritual World. For the first six months he took only two vegetarian meals a day: breakfast and lunch, and daily practised meditation for many hours. Many years later, when he had to work in communication with foreigners, he took three vegetarian meals a day. Vegetarianism is a way to secure a clean and pure body, free from the vengeful spirits of slaughtered animals. It helps purify the mind and soul of those who practice it to attain Dhamma and meditation easier and faster.\n\nDr. Suchart renounced his worldly well-being, unmarried, refrained from attending social gatherings for pleasure and from drinking alcohol and smoking. He dedicated himself to the holy life to have a clean body and mind to communicate with the Spiritual World.\n\nLater in 1970, Samnak Poo Sawan was relocated to 270 Soi 65 (Chaturong Songkhram), Petchkasem Road, Bangkae Nua, Khet Pasicharoen, Bangkok. Miss Ladda Prasertkul, one of the followers of Samnak Poo Sawan, donated the land and religious people donated money for the construction of its buildings.\n\nDr.Suchart, the appointed Prime Director of Samnak Poo Sawan, received divine power to cure people from their sicknesses. They believed in him and came to get their treatment free of charge. At first, the Centre opened for this service on Saturdays and Sundays. Later on, due to the Centre’s extra works, it limited its treatment service to only on Sundays. The number of people to receive treatment each Sunday was limited to 300. The Center recorded statistics and listed patients who had recovered from their sicknesses that were caused by black magic or being possessed by evil spirits. It published, with the patients’ consent, several cases in many issues of various publications.\n\nAfter giving out treatments to patients on each Sunday, Dr. Suchart preached, taught Dhamma and also answered Dhamma questions from the audience. It was one of his ways to help relieve his fellow mankind from spiritual sufferings. His teachings also covered many other fields of knowledge, for example, philosophy, economics, history, political science, science, and so on. These Dhamma preachings were also published in many publications.\n\nStarting in 1978, when Dr. Suchart had to concentrate on promoting inter-religious brotherhood and world peace, he assigned a properly trained person to replace him in giving out treatment services. In 1989, Samnak Poo Sawan was confiscated by orders of the Treasury Department, so the treatment of bathing with lustral water was stopped.\n\nAt present, the treatment is done by patients or their family members making a wish in front of the image of Luang Poo Tuad, (Changing Salty into Fresh Water) on the second floor of the House of Divine Sages, and drawing a piece of paper from a container. This paper has a medicine number printed in it. They then present this number at the first floor and receive a list of herbal medicine in accordance with the number they have drawn. Who wants lustral water and lustral oil can also ask for them there. Many people have their wishes fulfilled and their sickness cured.\n\nThe work of the Spiritual World at Samnak Poo Sawan can be divided into 3 periods:\n\n1. The period of Soul Led Human (1966-1976) when H.S.H. Prince Choompakaputra Jumpala, Professor Dr. Kloom Vajropala, Professor Dr. Luang Samarn Vanakij, Major General Tawil Kasetradhat, Dr. Boonyong Vongvanich, Acharn Kelong Panich, Acharn Booncheun Thongyu, Acharn Usa Palarachune etc. worked for 10 years.\n\n2. The period of Human Led Soul (1977-1991). From 1977-1981 when its works advanced to the United Nations and various countries in Europe, America, Asia and Australia, several persons such as Police Major General Pibul Pasawat, Major General Prasit Cheunboon, Lieutenant General Samak Suwannakorn etc. led its works for 5 years.\n\nDuring 1982-1991, the ten years of defending against law-suits, it was\n\nJudge Chalermchai Jarupaibul who led its works.\n\n3. The last period, Enter the Disciples (1992-2005), Assoc.Prof. Dr.Phichai Tovivich, Rear Admiral Sura Yutthawong, Dr. Thongmoah Champa-ngern etc. led its work. The World Peace Envoy (Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong), who then became Ven. Ariyawanso Bhikkhu, acted till his death as the Master of Ceremonies for events involving the Spiritual World.\n\nDHAMMA MISSIONS TO BOOST MORALE\n\nIn 1972, with the independence of Thailand being threathened, the Great Masters arranged holy rituals and made “Sacred Talismanic Cloth to Protect Thai Independence.” Dr. Suchart distributed them to soldiers, policemen and civilian volunteers in the troubled border areas for their protection against any harm. With the motto, “Without independence, how can religion exist? When people suffer famine, no peace can be realized,” Dr. Suchart led the Dhamma Missions of the House of Divine Sages to boost morale. These missions traveled extensively to all parts of the country, distributing the Holy Talismanic Cloth, medicines, and other useful supplies to those men. By his speeches, Dr. Suchart raised their morale, their will to fight on, and their pride in their work, all of which were important for the protection of the security, safety and independence of the nation. He encouraged them to boost their patriotic love for their nation, religion and king. He also taught them to be good person and to practise the religious teachings of their faith, to be vigilant, and to refrain from over-drinking. If the places that he visited were important historical places, he would tell them about their significance and encouraged them to carry out their duty as soldiers with their utmost ability because our courageous Thai kings and ancestors had protected this land for us to live happily in peace. We would be ashamed, if we could not protect this land from harm.\n\nHe also emphasized that Thailand is an agricultural country. It was essential for each family to grow edible plants and vegetables at home in order to feed its members and thus cutting expenses. Dr. Suchart brought with him books, “Pueng Na Din, Chart Plod Bhai, (Rely on Top Soil, the Nation is Safe)” and “Kwarm Samred Kong Si Nak Karn Kaset (The Success of Four Agriculturists)” and Dhamma books of Samnak Poo Sawan to distribute to soldiers as well.\n\nBesides travelling to distribute Talismanic Cloth to Protect Independence, on some occasions, he received commands from the Great Masters of the World of Gods to travel alone to the frontier to conduct the correct ceremonies of the World of Souls to help protect Thailand. These frontier trips were during 1975-1976 while the Communist invasion threat was imminent. Dr. Suchart began launching the task of distributing Talismanic Cloth on the 5th of March, 1972 and ended it in 1979. The Communist terrorists stopped their actions and laid down their arms. When there were no Communists, the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan ordered close.\n\nDr. Suchart told us about distributing Talismanic Cloth that though this cloth had no talismanic wordings, it had great meanings because there were pictures of Somdej Phra Buddhacharn (Toh) Brahma Ransi in the middle as well as drawn pictures of the four courageous Thai kings. On the left were King Naresuan the Great and King Putta Yodfa the Great. On the right were King Ram Kamhaeng the Great and King Taksin the Great. There were also pictures of four big animals: elephant, tiger, naga and singh. Therefore 9 items altogether. The Talismanic Cloth size was 9x9 inches, and was made in the reign of King Rama IX, all together totaled three 9s. The sound of 9 in Thai means taking a step forward, so stepping forward for Thainess. This Cloth was a symbol of protection and was blessed with the power of Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. It would protect us only when we maintained our vigilancy, our good moral conduct, and our readiness to sacrifice ourself for the greater whole. This Talismanic Cloth helped save lives of many soldiers who attacked and destroyed the enemy base at Kun Ching, Huay Sai.\n\nDr. Suchart spoke about the risks associated with travelling to distribute the Talismanic Cloth. He had been attacked by gunfire about 3-4 times. The first time was when distributing it at Lao Kor 6, Na Haew District, Loei Province. The bridge to that place was broken, Upon seeing us, the Communist terrorists stationed were taken by surprise and started their shooting. Another time, Major General Prasit Chuenboon accompanied the group at Na Chaluay, Ubon Ratchathani Province. When they arrived at the burnt bridge, the land below was full of land mines but Dr. Suchart told the driver to continue. Two communist terrorists on the mountain were stunned to see the vehicle driving through mined land and opened fire. The third risk, from Tung Chang to Uttaradit Province, a Communist terrorist’s vehicle chased them, but they escaped. There were 73 provinces in Thailand at that period, 49 provinces were under the Communists. The world believed that Thailand would be the next domino and would collapse under Communism like Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.\n\nSamnak Poo Sawan had published many books on Dhamma Missions to Boost Morale, the distribution of Talismanic Cloth to Protect Thai Independence, as well as Dr. Suchart’s speeches made during these trips.\n\nBUILDING PHRA SRI ARIYA MAITREYA TO NULLIFY EVIL SPELLS\n\nIn 1965, the situation of war in Vietnam seemed to be spreading to Thailand. At that time, refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos began to take refuge in Thailand. Different ideologies and ideas splitted the Thais into camps, and the situation on the border was undesirable.\n\nIn 1966, Dr. Suchart was commanded by the Great Masters to travel to collect soil from several holy places both in Thailand and from neighbouring countries: Thailand, India, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Indonesia, Malaysia and Burma. On the 19th of May, 1970, on Visakha Puja Day, Dr. Suchart held a ceremony to consecrate the blessings of the Devas and Brahmas into the soil brought from the holy places in 7 countries.\n\nDevas of Suvanabhumi Peninsula and Protector Devas reported that the Peninsula would be facing serious troubles, The meeting of the Three Realms of the Spiritual World decided therefore to build an Image of Phra Bodhisattva (a Would-be Buddha) Sri Ariya Maitreya, so he could spread his blessings to protect the Suvarnabhumi Peninsula from imminent dangers. Inside the Image of Phra Sri Ariya Maitreya contained soil from the holy places of the 7 countries.\n\nSamnak Poo Sawan had proceeded accordingly to nullify evil spells that would befall on the Suvarnabhumi Peninsula, by invoking Phra Bodhisattva Sri Ariya Maitreya’s blessed compassion for mankind. This future Buddha, according to our belief, resides on the fourth realm of heaven (Dusit Heaven) in his waiting to be the next Buddha succeeding the Samana Gotama Buddha. With his divine compassion to save the world, together with the blessings from Devas and Brahmas who were intended to be born again to practise Dhamma to achieve Arahathood, the Suvarnabhumi Peninsula would face less troubles.\n\nBy the decision of the World of Souls, Samnak Poo Sawan under the care of the Supreme Spirit of Luang Poo Tuad (Changing Salty into Fresh Water) had built the Image of Phra Sri Ariya Maitreya for the following purposes:\n\n-To nullify evil spells and to lessen the effect of hell fire to befall on the Suvarnabhumi Peninsula (Indo-China).\n\n-To place this Image at the balcony of Samnak Poo Sawan’s Building so every visitor can pay respect.\n\n-To promote Buddhism at its mid-era to last for a long time. The great merit from this act would give blissful peace to people in the Suvarnabhumi Peninsula.\n\n-To strengthen close relationships between Thailand and its neighbouring countries, leading first to peace in the vicinity and then the world.\n\nOn 18th July 1970, on Saturday of the 15th night of the waxing moon of the 8th month in the year of the dog at 13.00 hrs, His Royal Highness Pra Vorawongther Pra-ong Chao Anusorn Mongkolkarn of the Chakri Dynasty presided over the Casting Ceremony of the Image of Phra Bodhisattva Sri Ariya Maitreya, who stood at 6 feet in width and 6 feet in height.\n\nOn 9th August 1970, Tao Maha Brahma Jinna Panjara, the Ceremonial Lord of the World of Souls, Overcomer of Mara (Demons) and Head of 16 Realms of Rupa Brahma, descended to Earth to put soil from holy places in 7 countries in the head of the Image of Phra Bodhisattva Sri Ariya Maitreya, to lessen the conflicts in the Indochinese Peninsula.\n\nOn 11th August 1970, Samnak Poo Sawan organized the Ceremony to Install the Image of Phra Bodhisattva Sri Ariya Maitreya on the balcony of its building.\n\nDuring 19th-21st March 1971, Samnak Poo Sawan organized the Celebration and Eye-Opening of the Image of Phra Bodhisattva Sri Ariya Maitreya. There was a miracle: it rained heavily and the Image of Phra Bodhisattva Sri Ariya Maitreya shedded tears. Tao Maha Brahma Jinna Panjara told members of Samnak Poo Sawan in writing: “the fourth month rain is miraculously heavy, Phra Sri Ariya Maitreya sheds tears feeling pity for human beings who live their immoral lives.”\n\nPROMOTION OF VEGETARIANISM\n\nIn 1972, Samnak Poo Sawan under the supervision of Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong set up a demonstration-workshop named “Kin Pua Yu (Eat to Survive)” to promote vegetarian foods. It was his opinion that Thailand accepted Buddhism as her national religion with five precepts for all Buddhists. The first precept was to abstrain from killing, but flesh consumption encouraged the killing of animals. So a vegetarian restaurant was set up there. Dr. Suchart instructed members of Samnak Poo Sawan and encouraged the public to see bad effects and dangers of consuming flesh and to see benefit of vegetarianism. Later on, another demonstration-workshop “Kin Pua Yu” was set up at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan for the purpose of persuading tourists who visited that place to taste and learn to like vegetarian foods more and more. This was also the beginning of the Vegetarian Centre of Thailand in 1972, which later led to the formal establishment of the Vegetarian Centre of Thailand in 1977. 14\n\nAt present, the Vegetarian Centre of Thailand is an associated member of the Inter-national Vegetarian Union. Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong was the Founding President of the Centre. Associate Professor Dr. Phichai Tovivich is now the President after Acharn Kelong Panich, the former President of the Centre passed away in 2008.\n\nDR. SUCHART’S VOWS\n\nWhen Dr. Suchart studied in-dept and understood clearly about life, he knew that the Great Masters wanted him to work for public services. He was determined and intended to do as they commanded. On December 21st, 1972 at 19.00 hours, in the midst of the meeting of members at Samnak Poo Sawan, Dr. Suchart made his vows to dedicate himself to serve the Devas and Brahmas, working along the path of a Would-be Buddha, His vows to serve the work of Samnak Poo Sawan were as follows:\n\n1. I will run this place with justice;\n\n2. My life has no meaning and I dedicate my life for the work of Samnak Poo Sawan;\n\n3. I have no future. I will pray and meditate to have a peaceful state of mind so that the Supreme Spirits can easily work through my body;\n\n4. The command of the Great Masters comes first, above those of my parents and superiors;\n\n5. I am willing to die rather than bowing to Adhamma or unrightiousness.\n\nHIS DAILY WAY OF LIFE\n\nDr. Suchart dedicated himself to work for all mankind according to the Bodhisattva’s way. His daily way of life included:\n\n- Gave up business, houses and properties, lived a good ascetic life and had no family;\n\n- Refrained from going out for sensual pleasure and from social gatherings for any enjoyment;\n\n- Spent his restful, non-working time praying and in meditation in order to communicate with spirits in the Spiritual World;\n\n- Took strictly vegetarian meals;\n\n- Lived like a hermitage with only bare necessity, and slept on a piece of cloth only.\n\nAs a Layman before Ordination The daily routine of Dr. Suchart which the Great Masters assigned for him, with the exception when he had to do such jobs of Samnak Poo Sawan as distributing the Holy Talismanic Cloth, going to Ratchaburi or abroad, appeared below. Only Monday was a free day. This routine was practised since the 15th of January 1973, and all relevant members of Samnak Poo Sawan khew it well.\n\n04.00-06.00 hrs. after praying, exercise by walking in meditation.\n\n07.00 hrs. breakfast\n\n08.00-11.30 hrs. listening to news and reading newspapers\n\n11.30-13.00 hrs. lunch\n\n13.00-16.00 hrs. practising meditation and vipassana (no disturbance allowed)\n\n16.00-17.00 hrs. walking in meditation for exercise\n\n18.00-19.00 hrs. dinner\n\n19.00-21.00 hrs. free time\n\n21.00-22.00 hrs. praying and meditating\n\n22.00 hrs. going to bed\n\n22.00-04.00 hrs. time for the soul\n\nAfter Ordination\n\nIn 1991, after he became a monk and advanced in age, he practised dhamma for the monkhood but lived in solitude in the forest, leaving it from time to time only to visit his fellows.\n\nHis routine while being a monk during his first three years of ordination (from 1992-1994) was as follows:\n\n03.00 hrs. morning chanting\n\n04.00 hrs. meditation\n\n06.00 hrs. conducting private affairs, walking in meditation\n\n10.00 hrs. having his sole meal of the day.\n\n11.00 hrs. praying, walking in meditation, doing private matters\n\n16.00 hrs. evenining chanting\n\n17.00 hrs. walking in meditation in forest\n\n19.00 hrs. meditation and rest 16\n\n20.00 hrs. time for his soul to rest\n\n01.00 hrs. waking up and meditate\n\nNote: On Buddhist holy days, he would abstain from talking, and would meditate or walk in meditation till dawn to do penitence.\n\nHis routine in later periods of monkhood until his passing away (from 1995-2005) was as follows:\n\n03.00 hrs. getting up, doing private affairs\n\n04.00 hrs. morning chanting\n\n05.00 hrs. walking in meditation\n\n06.00 hrs. having breakfast\n\n07.00 hrs. giving advices to followers\n\n08.00 hrs. working and reading\n\n10.00 hrs. having meal\n\n11.00 hrs. giving advices to followers\n\n12.00 hrs. getting news of the world\n\n13.00 hrs. working time of the Holy Soul\n\n15.00 hrs. working, checking of documents and reading\n\n18.00 hrs. evening chanting\n\n19.00 hrs. getting world news\n\n21.00 hrs. taking a rest for the mind and soul\n\nLaying out System and Rules of Work\n\nAfter he was appointed Director, more people volunteered to work for Samnak Poo Sawan. The Great Masters therefore laid down rules for followers in each category at Samnak Poo Sawan. Later, when the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan was open and started to function, he adapted those rules to be used there too.\n\nIn working for world peace, Dr. Suchart deemed it necessary to have a wide, open area with an atmosphere of inter-religious brotherhood conducive to men’s peace of mind, so he provided a place, about 100 kilometers south of Bangkok, and called it, “the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan.”\n\nTHE RELIGIOUS LAND HOOPPHA SAWAN\n\nThe Religious Land Hooppha Sawan is situated in the mountain range named “Tham Phra” (locally named “Suae-Mohb” or crouching tiger) at Donsai Sub-district, Pak Tho District, Ratchaburi Province.\n\nThis place had an important historical significance. In the third century of the Buddhist Era, King Ashoka the Great of the Indian Sub-Continent sent out several Buddhist missions to disseminate Buddhism in many lands. One Buddhist mission led by the Most Venerable Sona Mahathera and the Most Venerable Uttara Mahathera had travelled by ship to Suvarnabhumi Peninsula. That ship sank at Prachuapkhirikhan Province. The Buddhist mission continued their travel by cart and took their night stop over in a cave later named “Salika,” located at Suae Mohb mountain. The mission then climbed up its peak to have a bird’s eye view of the local community to start their preaching of Buddhism. This place was the dawn of Buddhism in Thailand. The mission later traveled to the Khoo-Bua Village some 10 kilometerss away from the Tham Phra site and started propagating Buddhism.\n\nOn one occasion, when Luang Vichit Vatakarn, the then Director-General of the Department of Fine Arts realized the importance of this place, he officially declared on February 25th, 1935 , the Tham Phra mountain range a registered archaeological site of the Ratchaburi Province.\n\nIn 1970, Dr. Suchart and one novice made a trip on foot to this mountain range to seek a suitable place to practise meditation. After surveying the area, he considered it a proper place as it enjoyed a fine view and was conducive for meditation and relaxation. With this reason, he started developing the place to be a religious centre for all religions. He then proceeded to contact leaders of other religions and erected objects of worship of Buddhism and other religions, which would pave the way to promote inter-religious brotherhood and to organize the World Eternal Peace Conference in the future.\n\nThe development and construction of the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan proceeded mindfully with the best conservation of nature. On each occasion that a ceremony was organized, the chairman of the ceremony would plant a memorable tree as well.\n\nOn each peak of the mountain range at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan, there were important objects of worship, for example, the Peace Pagoda, a symbol of world peace; the 9-metre high Image of Lord Buddha; Hindu God Lord Ganesha; the huge Image of the Would-be Buddha Kaccayana Mahathera, built in Chinese style; the 9-metre high Statue of Lord Jesus Christ; a miniature statue of the Virgin Mary, presented by the Vatican; and the 9-metre high Image of the Would-be Buddha Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (Kuan Yin). According to the project of promoting inter-religious brotherhood, there were plans to erect other images of all Holy Founders or symbolic structures of great religions of the world with the granted permission from their respective religious leaders.\n\nThe Holy Statue of the Most Famous Ecclesiastical Buddhist Monk and Royal Counsellor of King Rama IV and King Rama V of the Chakri Dynasty (B.E. 2331-2415/A.D. 1788-1872) known as Somdej Phra Buddhacharn (Toh) Brahma Ransi was installed in the Singh Mongkol Boon Bamrung cave.\n\nInside the “Salika Cave” was the Holy Statue of “Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad (Changing Salty into Fresh Water),” the 3rd Supreme Patriarch of Ayutthaya Period. In front of the cave, the Statue of King Rama I the Great, the founder of the present Chakri Dynasty and Bangkok City was installed. He once marched his army to face his enemy and stopped at this place. Besides, there were Prasart Phra Dhatu (Pavilion), and the Chief Lord Indra Hall. There were also places for conducting rituals and ceremonies: the Jinnapooto Memorial Foundation Hall, Brahma Ransi Pavilion, and so on.\n\nThe most important building was the World Eternal Peace Conference constructed to convene the World Eternal Peace Conference.\n\nThe landscape of the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan was fully suitable for pilgrimage. All the time there were religious people who traveled there to pay homage to objects of worship. Particularly on weekends, there were many organized tour groups visiting the site. Each month about ten thousand people visited the Religious Land.\n\nAt the beginning of his work to develop the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan, Dr.Suchart had to fight against influential groups who with commercial purpose in mind attempted to commence rock-blasting activities of the Tham Phra mountain range, a protected national archaeological site.\n\nTo achieve the ten-point objectives of Samnak Poo Sawan, the following offices were set up at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan:\n\n1. Jinnapooto Memorial Foundation\n\n2. Office of the World Peace Envoy\n\n3. International Federation of Religions\n\n4. Inter-religious Brotherhood Promotion Centre\n\n5. Vegetarianism Promotion Centre\n\n6. World Eternal Peace Conference Project\n\n7. Youth Morality Training Centre\n\n8. International Meditation Centre\n\n9. Psychic Ailment Treatment Centre\n\n10. Bodhisattva Housing Project\n\nAll these tasks were under the responsibility of Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong.\n\nThe Religious Land Hooppha Sawan organized activities according to periods of\n\ntraditional festivals for merit making, and arranged festivals on significant occasions relating to the nation, the religion, and the monarchy. Some important ceremonies were organized here. These included the Consecration Ceremony of the Buddha Amulets containing holy soils from 9 countries (for unity), the Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of the Peace Pagoda, the Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of the World Eternal Peace Conference Hall, etc. In such ceremonies the participants were ambassadors, representatives from diplomatic corps, as well as more than ten thousand religious people.\n\nAt the Religious Land in the night of the 19th of every month, religious followers from all parts of Thailand would gather around the Peace Pagoda to practise religious activities and listen to Dhamma speeches of Dr. Suchart, who was also often referred to as the Peace Envoy. Those speeches helped them learn about the situation of the country and the world. They also learned about using meditation power to halt military forces. After the speech, they all chanted and prayed in unison to the Divine Power for the safety and peace of the nation and for all mankind. They then spent the rest of the night in meditation on the 12-acre flat area on the mountain range till 04.00 hrs. when they once again chanted together before departing for home. This activity was initiated in 1977 and lasted until March 1991.\n\nDr. Suchart also instructed members of Samnak Poo Sawan and the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan in the various provinces to arrange regular chanting, praying and meditating sessions for the safety and peace of the nation and the entire world.\n\nIn June 1981, Dr. Suchart and his Executive Committee had drafted “Rules of the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan” for the purpose of making the Religious Land a supramundane land.\n\nTo keep up with world events, the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan adopted the adjusted ten-point objectives to serve the new society as guidelines for performing its works as follows:\n\n1. Help relieve the physical and spiritual sufferings of all mankind;\n\n2. Help lessen defilements in the minds of selfish human beings;\n\n3. Help abolish dogmatic beliefs and ignorance in the minds of men;\n\n4. Help uphold social justice in the world;\n\n5. Help protect the existence of peace and the monarchical institutions;\n\n6. Help promote the progress of religions by all available means;\n\n7. Help support all technical experts who have genuine knowledge and who are truly committed to working for the prosperity of society and the country;\n\n8. Help cooperate with all well-wishers for the good of our nation;\n\n9. Help bring ethical morality to the minds of the younger generations;\n\n10. Help confirm the belief in “Life after death” so that people will avoid committing sinful acts.\n\nDr. Suchart has undertook to work in line with these objectives for the New Society and at the same time to work also for world peace.\n\nTo carry out all projects for world peace, he promoted activities to instill basic ethical morality in the mind of the younger generations: to become peace lovers, to realize the supreme value of life and to apply non-violence means in solving their future problems. Furthermore, he organized and directed many activities in relation to world peace promotion projects. Those included:\n\n1. The ordination of monks and novices, there were about\n\n30 monks and novices ordained at each time.\n\n2. The setting up of social welfare volunteer group named the ‘Lion Youth Group”\n\nwith the purpose to train them to do beneficial work for the\n\ncommunity and to behave themselves according to the Buddhist doctrines as\n\nto try to get rid of the sources of all evils --greed, hatred and delusion -- from\n\ntheir minds.\n\n3. The arrangements of Buddhist meditation programmes for the general public;\n\n4. The dissemination of the Buddhist ideals and morality to the public through the media of film, slides, books, newspapers, etc.\n\nIn his future programmes, he was very interested in setting up the International\n\nMeditation Centre at Hooppha Sawan too but it was not materialized.\n\nJINNAPOOTO MEMORIAL FOUNDATION\n\nDr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong and his Executive Committee had formed the Jinnapooto Memorial Foundation with the granted licence from the Department of Religious Affairs to carry out its manifested objectives. It was registered as a legal entity with the National Police Department on September 9th, 1975. Prof. Dr. Kloom Vajaropala was the first Chairman of the Foundation. Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong was appointed the second Chairman in 1976-1989.\n\nAccording to the licence, the Jinnapooto Memorial Foundation had the following objectives:\n\n1. Propagate Buddhism.\n\n2. Research, study and propagate biographies of the Supreme Patriarch Kurupajarn Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad (Changing Salty into Fresh Water) and Somdej Phra Buddhacharn (Toh) Brahma Ransi.\n\n3. Research, study and disseminate information on the subject of spirituality and the mind.\n\n4. Provide public services according to the resolution of the Executive Committee.\n\n5. Help promote the ten-point objectives of Samnak Poo Sawan.\n\n6. Carry out other beneficial public activities as agreed by the resolution of the Executive Committee.\n\n7. The Foundation was a non-political entity.\n\nDr. Suchart himself implemented the objectives of the Foundation with many\n\nactivities, for instance:\n\n- Accepting invitations to give lecture on Dhamma at many academic institutes of\n\ndifferent levels and to give interviews on the subject of peace and religion in radio and television programmes.\n\n- Visiting soldiers and policemen stationed along the remote borders to boost their morale.\n\n- Propagating sermons of the Great Masters of Samnak Poo Sawan\n\nin newspapers, Dhamma publications, Dhamma cassette tapes and making slides to be used during his lecture.\n\n- Erecting objects of worship in the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan. The most important one was the Peace Pagoda (Santi Chedi) which was a miniature of Nibbana Chedi in heaven. It had ten intricate spires representing the ten virtues of Lord Buddha. Inside each spire enshrined the Holy Relics of Lord Buddha, Arahants and Bodhisattvas presented by Sri Lanka, Nepal and also Thailand. There were also Holy Soils from sacred places of various countries and Holy Soils from the Four Holy Places of Buddhism in the Jambu Continent (India) which were enshrined at the base of the Pagoda. The most beautifully and elaborately designed image of Lord Buddha was inside the Peace Pagoda, opened for public worship only on the 19th of every month and on special occasions. In the pagoda, there was a stone inscription on the wall, telling about the importance of the Peace Pagoda.\n\n- Providing religious functions on significant days of Buddhism, celebrations of festival days, and particularly on Visakha Puja Day, the ceremony of Paying Homage to Great Masters of Samnak Poo Sawan would be organized.\n\n- Forming the International Federation of Religions.\n\n- Setting up the Inter-religious Brotherhood Promotion Centre.\n\n- Doing research, studying and propagating biographies of the Supreme Patriarch\n\nKurupajarn Phra Bodhisattva Luang Poo Tuad (Changing Salty into Fresh Water) and Somdej Phra Buddhacharn (Toh) Brahma Ransi.\n\n- Disseminating the facts on spirituality and mind through lectures, books\n\nand audio-visual aids.\n\n- Contributing money and humanitarian aids to help people who were suffered from calamity.\n\n- Donating money to construct lodgings at Ananda Kuti, Nepal, for pilgrims who\n\ntraveled to pay homage to the Holy Places of Buddhism.\n\n- Helping in the restoration of school buildings, and distributing clothes, stationary\n\nand medicines to needy pupils and students.\n\n- Supporting the ordination of novices, monks and as well as lay-people who were\n\ndetermined to practise meditation and mind purification.\n\n- Offering scholarships to assist good but needy students and pupils. In 1976- 1977, he offered a total of 26 scholarships to undergraduates in universities and in secondary schools both in Bangkok and in many provinces. After presenting scholarships, he gave a speech on moral conduct, and told how meditation could benefit both in their studies and examination.\n\nPROPAGATION OF DHAMMA AND MORALITY\n\nIn 1972-1980:\n\nDr. Suchart led his missions to boost the morale of the soldiers and policemen stationed along the remote border to encourage their dedication for the cause of the nation and world peace. He made more than 30 trips.\n\n1973-1981:\n\nUpon invitations, he gave lectures on the nation’s and world’s situation, the Buddhist solutions to social problems etc. at many academic institutes of different levels, government agencies, seminars, country prisons and so on. He was invited to lecture about 140 times.\n\n1977-1981:\n\nHe gave monthly interviews on peace and religion to the press, media, radio and television programmes many times.\n\nHe directed the composition of nearly 20 songs on morality and peace ideals to be recorded and presented to audiences.\n\n1977-1981:\n\nOn the 19th of each month, he delivered his speech on morality and peace ideals and relayed important events of the world to those religious people of different faiths.\n\nDr. Suchart occasionally gave his lecture on Buddhist morality and peace ideals to those on tours to the Religious Land.\n\n- To educate the general public on Dhamma and peace ideals as well as to urge their prompt awareness of the threat of war, he issued and published about 90 publications.\n\n- Whenever he was on his religious mission abroad, he never failed to urge the people to be aware of the immediate threat of war and guide them to the way of permanent peace.\n\n- On December 25th, 1977, he issued a declaration on “the World Peace Day.” An appeal for world peace was made to such prominent world figures as Heads of States and Heads of Governments, Kings, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Ambassadors and so on, urging them to live in peaceful unison.\n\n- On April 9th, 1981, he issued the Peace Declaration and sent it to the Thai Government, warning them of the possible war that might bring an unmeasurable disaster to the people as well as urging them to change their minds from greed, hatred, delusion (the three evil causes of fighting among men), and campaigning for the nationwide prayer for world peace.\n\n- While attending the Annual NGO/DPI Conference of the United Nations at the United Nations Headquarters in New York on September 10th, 1981, he urged mass prayer for the cause of human unity and world peace.\n\nINTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF RELIGIONS\n\nWhen the world situation became tense with the possible outbreak of World War III, Dr. Suchart considered that it was high time to work fully for world peace. He saw the need to have a particular centre devoted for world peace. So he suggested to the Executive Committee’s Buddhist members of Samnak Poo Sawan and the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan to form the International Federation of Religions (IFR). The IFR was registered with the Government of Thailand on 18th November 1975 with its headquarters at the No. 59, Soi 31 (Swasdi), Sukhumvit Road, Klongton Sub-district, Pra Khanong District, Bangkok. Maj. General Prakarn Bhuvanartnurak was the President of the Federation.\n\nObjectives of the IFR\n\nAccording to Article III of its Constitution, the IFR has the following objectives:-\n\n1. To help promote mutual practice amongst members having strict observance of the teachings of the great founders of religions;\n\n2. To help strengthen unity, solidarity, and brotherhood amongst members;\n\n3. To help propagate the sublime doctrines of religion;\n\n4. To help render cooperation in the work of social, educational, cultural, and other humanitarian services;\n\n5. To help promote a lasting peace and harmony for all mankind, and collaborate with other organizations working towards the same goal;\n\n6. To help promote unification amongst men with an idea of creating world unity;\n\n7. To help eliminate controversial disagreement on religions and political doctrines in order to raise the spirit of religious brotherhood and equality for all mankind;\n\n8. To help promote human rights in their work that will not cause harm and difficulties to mankind;\n\n9. To help search for ways and means to work together on the World Eternal Peace Conference.\n\nIn 1977, Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong was elected President and served in this position up until 1989. When the Court of Justice confiscated the property of Jinnapooto Memorial Foundation, the Federation stopped functioning and was closed.\n\nUnder his direction, he made strenuous efforts to materialize his peace ideals, expanding all-out nationwide activities especially of the branch offices of the International Federation of Religions and appealing the ideal to people of all walks of life. There were IFR’s branches in 52 provinces.\n\nThe IFR began to work on its inter-religious brotherhood promotion.\n\nLater, he moved the headquarters of the Jinnapooto Memorial Foundation and the International Federation of Religions to be permanently sited at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan, the proposed venue for the World Eternal Peace Conference. From this place his Religious Mission for Peace had been sent to many countries around the world, to strengthen religious brotherhood and peace cooperation among those prominent religious leaders and peace activists, and introduce them to his peace ideal especially on solidifying religious and peace forces against the war mongers. He also proposed to them his plan to hold the international meeting to prevent war, the World Eternal Peace Conference scheduled for 1982 at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan.\n\nINTER-RELIGIOUS BROTHERHOOD – THE WAY TO PEACE\n\nTo publicize to the general public the achievement made by the IFR’s Religious Mission for Peace in promoting inter-religious brotherhood and world peace cooperation, the IFR organized the Exhibition of the Religious Mission for Peace on various occasions:\n\nOctober 19th, 1977:\n\nAn Exhibition of Christianity – Buddhism Brotherhood Promotion\n\nDecember 25th, 1977:\n\nThe Anointing and Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of the 9-metre High Statue of Lord Jesus Christ, the construction of which was completed in 1979.\n\nFebruary 19th, 1978:\n\nAn Exhibition of Buddhism-Sikhism Brotherhood Promotion.\n\nOctober 19th, 1978:\n\nA Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of the World Eternal Peace Conference Hall with the participation of representatives of 5 major religions including diplomatic corps members from 19 countries stationed in Bangkok.\n\nOctober 6th, 1979:\n\nBishop Peitro Carretto, President of the Episcopal Commission on Dialogue and Ecumenism in Thailand conferred the image of Virgin Mary brought from the Vatican City to Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong to be sited along with the Statue of Lord Jesus Christ on a mountain peak at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan.\n\nOctober 19th, 1980:\n\nA Praying Ceremony for World Peace was held along with 4 other functions:\n\n- An Anointing and Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of the 9-metre high Image of the Would-be Buddha Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva (Kuan Yin).\n\n- An Exhibition of the Works on the Inter-religious Brotherhood Promotion by the 3rd-6th Missions.\n\n- The Fourth Year Celebration of the Peace Pagoda with its renovation in golden leaves.

After the appointment, with his high responsibility, Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong started working immediately for world peace in time for the current political world situation.\n\nAppointed by World Organizations\n\nIn Dr. Suchart’s contacts with foreign countries, important international organizations and world prominent persons agreed with his idea and works. They therefore appointed him to the following positions:\n\nThe First Time: The World Constitution and Parliament Association (WCPA) held its 4th Annual Conference in New Delhi, India between 21st-24th February 1981. At this conference, a delegate presented an urgent motion for the WCPA worldwide campaign for the World Constitution to be adopted by world citizens. There had to be a person travelling to promote better understanding with the governments around the world. This delegate requested that the Conference suggest a nominee so that they would unanimously adopt the motion. No one was nominated to be elected. A senator of Bombay then proposed that the Conference establish an ad-hoc committee of 5 members comprising representatives of Sri Lanka, Mexico, India, America and Australia to choose an appropriate person for this purpose.\n\nThe Conference reconvened its meeting on February 24th, 1981 and at 16.30 hrs. Dr. T. P. Amerasinghe, Barrister and Judge of the High Court of Sri Lanka, announced to the quorum of the plenary session, “By a special resolution unanimously adopted by a Trustee, we the World Constitution and Parliament Association, in recognizing the grand work for peace he has already performed and in believing that as an Ambassador for Peace he can advance the process of obtaining ratification of the Constitution for the Federation of Earth and the call for a Provisional World Parliament to meet in 1982, are pleased to appoint Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong, President of the International Federation of Religions, as Peace Envoy of the Association under the Resolution passed at the New Delhi Conference of the Association held between February 21st -24th, 1981.”\n\nThe Second Time: At the First Session of the Provisional World Parliament in Brighton, England on 4th-17th September 1982, the plenary voted unanimously confirming the appointment of Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong as “World Peace Envoy.”\n\nThe Third Time At the Second Session of the Provisional World Parliament in New Delhi, India on March 15th-29th, 1985, the delegates carried out unanimously the motion to confirm the appointment of Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong to serve the special position of “World Peace Envoy.”\n\nThe Fourth Time At its meeting held at Denver Marriott West Colorado, U.S.A., from June 27th to 29th, 1986, the Executive Cabinet of the World Constitution and Parliament Association passed a special resolution to re-elect Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong “World Peace Envoy” for the fourth time in succession.\n\nThe Fifth Time Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong was appointed “World Peace Envoy” again from a unanimous decision of the 3rd Provisional World Parliament of the WCPA met at Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel in Miami, Florida, U.S.A. on 23rd of June, 1987 which Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong attended from 18th-28th June 1987.\n\nThe Sixth Time At the Congress of the Executive Committee of WCPA at its Headquarters, Lakewood, Colorado , U.S.A. from the 17th-19th June 1990. The Congress decided for Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong to continue to be the World Peace Envoy.\n\nThe Seventh Time In the ceremony of presenting the Honourary Medal “Summa Cum Laude” from Dr. Edward C. Yang, Rector of John Dewey University of the U.S.A. at Samnak Poo Sawan on the 30th of March, 1991, Dr. Reinhart Ruge, President of WCPA read the citation of the World Peace Envoy’s work and appointed him the World Peace Envoy for the seventh time. Later in May 1991 in WCPA’s assembly, there was a decision to confirm the appointment of Dr. Suchart the World Peace Envoy for another term.\n\nAfter that, the Provisional World Parliament of WCPA’s assembly and every annual conference of WCPA would confirm the re-appointment of the World Peace Envoy even though he had already ordained as a Buddhist monk.\n\nDr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong’s appointment as “World Peace Envoy” by the world conference was due to the fact that those prominent world leaders had realized, from their meetings and conferences together with him, that he had a firm determination to invite religious, peace and political leaders from all over the world to attend the World Eternal Peace Conference to halt the imminent outbreak of World War III.\n\nThe Appointment of the Permanent World Peace Envoy\n\nIn the 6th Session of the Provisional World Parliament held at Bangkok Centre Hotel, Bangkok, Thailand on the 24th-27th of March, 2003 in the midst of the catastrophe of the world situation when the U.S.A. started to attack Iraq on the 20th of March 2003, the Office of the World Peace Envoy and the Kuan Yin Inter-religious Park jointly organized the 60th Birthday Anniversary Celebration of Ven. Ariyawanso Bhikkhu (Dr. Suchart Kosol-kitiwong) at the Kuan Yin Inter-religious Park, the headquarters of the Office of the World Peace Envoy. Among delegates of the Provisional World Parliament who joined the ceremony, there included members who had faith in Ven. Ariyawanso Bhikkhu. Dr. T.P. Amerasinghe read the citation praising Ven. Ariyawanso Bhikkhu. Dr. Reinhart Ruge and Dr. T.P. Amerasinghe signed their names on the letter appointing Ven. Ariyawanso Bhikkhu “Permanent World Peace Envoy” on 28th March 2003.\n\nWORKS OF THE PEACE ENVOY OF THE WORLD OF DIVINITY\n\nWhen Dr. Suchart worked on behalf of Peace Envoy of the World of Divinity, he gave sermons and suggested means for solving important problems with wits and deep thoughts. He also provided for public benefit straight forward and factual comments on situations of the country and the world.\n\nMost of his sermons iterated the teaching of each religion for believers to live together peacefully and happily. He considered that all mankind even though different in religious belief should not disunite. The World Wars had broken out twice which had made great catastrophes for mankind. If World War III broke out, it would probably eradicate all races of humanity from earth. The prevalent political world situation inclined toward the possible outbreak of World War III. It showed the fact that men were unable to achieve world peace through military-cum-political supremacy nor economic wealth. But peace would materialize through united religious forces of the whole world to prevent the outbreak of World War III. By inviting religious, political and peace leaders to attend the World Eternal Peace Conference in the atmosphere of the Religious Land, they would cooperate to seek solutions to the world problems. Dr. Suchart firmly believed that only through religious power could the outbreak of World War III be prevented. With this opinion, he carried out the work for the inter-religious brotherhood.\n\nDr. Suchart was a Thai citizen who never studied English nor could he speak English. While traveling to do work which must use English, he had a personal interpreter. He fashioned a belief that:\n\n“This work does not depend on languages but on ideas and action. Everyone can learn several languages but not everyone can learn ideas.”\n\nEventhough in the NGO Conference of the United Nations, he was cordially invited to speak and he spoke in the Thai language.\n\nHe had firm determination to work for peace and had courage to travel for disseminating his ideas. When some had doubts and asked questions, he would explain with reasons and gave clear answers to them.\n\nHe organized Religious Missions for Peace and traveled to meet with prominent leaders to propose ideas and principles of works for the cause of world peace.\n\nFrom 1966-1976, he traveled to many provinces and countries with the purpose of promoting inter-religious brotherhood, pilgrimage and bringing holy objects, such as, holy soils, Holy Relics of Lord Buddha from different countries and also from Thailand to be enshrined in the Image of the Would-Be Buddha Phra Sri Ariya Maitreya, the Peace Pagoda, the Statue of King Rama I, the World Eternal Peace Conference Hall for the cause of true peace in the Suvarnabhumi Peninsula (South East Asia Region) and in the world.

He also met H.E. William Gopalava, President of Sri Lanka for strengthening better understanding and exchanging view.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1981, he organized 11 Religious Missions for Peace going around the world as follows\n\nIn 1977\n\nOn May 9th-17th, 1977, the First Religious Mission for Peace went to Italy and Israel to promote inter-religious brotherhood with the leaders of Christianity and Islam.\n\n- Being in audience with H.H.

Pope John Paul II at the Vatican City.\n\n- It met with the prominent religious and peace leaders of Poland and participated in a peace dialogue.\n\nIn 1979\n\nHe directed the peace referendum campaign of peace lovers in Thailand on the topic of “Thai People Want Peace” which Major General Prasit Chuenboon was the campaign leader.\n\nIn January, just 9 days after Thailand’s neighbouring country, Cambodia, fell under the Vietnamese troops backed by the Heng Samrin regime, the International Federation of Religions under the direction of Dr.Suchart Kosolkitiwong had mounted a nationwide peace referendum campaign to show to the world that all Thai people were peace lovers, did not engage in any form of aggression or violation of another country’s sovereignty but wanted to remain in friendly relations with all regardless of political differences. The peace referendum was carried out through opinion polling commencing on January 16th, 1979, ending in August, 1980 lasting 1 year and eight months (with some intervals owing to other works). It was noted with satisfactory result that over one million and seven hundred thousand people supported the plan by giving their peace supporting signatures. 39\n\nOn June 6th-26th, 1979, the Fourth Religious Mission for Peace travelled to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to meet with the peace and religious leaders in order to strengthen inter-religious brotherhood and cooperation.

At that time there was a report that the US Secretary of State had close relationship with Prime Minister Chou En-Lai of the People’s Republic of China after the 44\n\nformer’s several visits to China. It was also reported that in the plenary session of the Chinese Communist Party Congress, Prime Minister Chou En-lai criticized in strongest terms the peace policy of the US Secretary of State. In the same letter, Dr.Suchart forwarded his idea for peace as follows:\n\n“… We, on our part, are doing everthing possible to build the religious brotherhood of all faiths. I have also come to a firm conclusion that peace can only come about after all contending parties have reached a common conviction that peace can only be secured by the vibration of the mind and not merely by word power of the lips.\n\nI have, therefore, felt that time has now come for all of us to use religion as the instrument for peace, so that we can stop once and for all this wanton destruction of human lives…\n\n… A permanent peace for this human world could materialize only when leaders of both contending camps can speak sincerely from their hearts. If both parties can really come, we should organize a big ceremony for true peace by issuing communique arma-ments so that they could be smelted down into the statues and images of all prophets and gods. For peace can never endure when all parties are still piling up their arms. The seed of wrath, of illusion and of greed, whenever it springs up, can turn man all of a sudden into a killer.\n\nOnce, a trained mind can penetrate and absorb the bliss of Dharma, such mental phenomena could generate the power that will overcome all obstacles to the mighty power of real and everlasting peace…”\n\n- On January 16th, 1975, Dr. Suchart wrote to H.E. Leonid Brezhnev, Chairman of Supreme Presidium of the USSR, a personal letter presenting his views on peace:\n\n“… True peace will only emerge in this world through the search for means to end conflicts in the ways of life of our human society. I consider, therefore, that the course of action inspired by Communist doctrines cannot produce real peace. On the contrary, it will divide the world into blocs and factions. It cannot consolidate the world into one harmonious society…\n\n… If peace is truly your ultimate goal, one thing that we should strive to accomplish is to explore the solution to current conflicts, so that a firm pedestal for world peace could be built. Such means cannot be found in any medium but inside the human mind, from which the forces of righteousness, morality and contentment could spring forth and make wonders. 45\n\nI am firmly convinced that ever since this world was opened up for human habitation, the means to produce peace rests hither in the man’s mind as characterized by his conviction on morals, honesty and faith in religion. Such are the forces that produce real and everlasting peace…\n\n… Alas, it is only too rare to find someone courageous enough to stand up amidst this maniacal world and rally for the means to end contemporary conflicts and schisms. I now take this first step out to solicit your cooperation for the building up of brotherhood of mankind and fraternity of religions…”\n\n- On March 24th, 1975, he wrote to H.E. Chou En-Lai inviting him to visit Thailand as a senior statesman and proposed to help to cure his sickness resulting from his past action and the revenge of spirits.\n\n- On January 21st, 1978, he sent a personal letter to H.E.

Campaigning for Peace Referendum of Thai People\n\nThe International Federation of Religions (IFR) campaigned for referendum of peace-loving Thai people nationwide from 1979-1980. Later on November 5, 1980 Dr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong, President of the IFR had presented to H.E. Dr. Kurt Waldheim, the UN Secretary-General, the Peace Referendum Record together with samples of one million signatures given by 90 per cent of peace-loving Thai people at the UN Headquarters, New York, the U.S.A.\n\n2. Receiving Holy Soils from Various Countries\n\nHe asked for holy soils from one important place of the respected country. This soil could be from: 1. the Parliament Building, 2. the Government House, 3. the temple, 4. the church or the mosque which was considered most sacred, or the official residence of leaders of the non-religious countries. All soil collected would be contained in the foundation stone of the conference hall. From 1977-1981, he sent out official letters to the foreign Embassies in Thailand and to the Thai Embassies in foreign countries fof this purpose. He then sent a team to receive the holy soil from the embassies in Thailand.\n\nSome countries sent representatives to offer it at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan. 85 countries participated in this project.\n\n3. Construction of the World Eternal Peace Conference Hall at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan\n\nOn October 19th, 1978, the Foundation Stone Laying Ceremony of the World Eternal Peace Conference Hall was held with the participation of the representatives of 5 major religions including diplomatic corps members from 19 countries with good relation with Thailand, namely the United States of America, the United Kingdom, the Union Soviet Socialist Republics and so on. In addition, more than ten thousand general and prominent people attended the function. In this ceremony diplomatic corps members from nineteen countries including from Thailand were represented to place the Holy Soils, presented by their countries, at the Foundation Stone base of the Peace Conference Hall. The Holy Soils placed at the Foundation Stone Base were presented by 85 various countries worldwide.\n\nLater on January 19th, 1981, the actual construction of the Peace Hall commenced with major financial support from public donations and was due to be completed in time for the World Eternal Peace Conference scheduled for 1982.\n\n4. Forming Committees to Prepare for the Peace Conference\n\nCommittee members were both Thais and foreigners. The committees were:\n\n- The General Conference Organizing Committee\n\n- The Honorary Advisory Committee\n\n- The Advisory Committee\n\n- The Preparation Committee the Peace Conference\n\n5. Making a Project in Brief and Topics for the Peace Conference\n\nIn May 1981 he sent the project in brief for the World Eternal Peace Conference\n\ntogether with a questionnaire to the religious, peace and state leaders soliciting their ideas and seeking their support to attend the conference.\n\nThe proposed main topics to be discussed at the conference included:\n\n1. Why were men born? For what purpose does our life exist? Where shall we go after death?\n\n2. How will the religious force play a major and effective role in preventing World War III? How can it bring peace to the world?\n\n3. Consideration to ratify principles of World Constitution for the establishment of Provisional World Parliament and World Government in the future.\n\n4. Consideration to ratify the usage of world common language.\n\n5. Consideration to declare the Indo-Chinese Peninsula as a zone of independence, neutrality and peace, to ease the tension and to prevent the cause of World War III, leading to a better and peaceful living of the Indo-Chinese people.\n\n6. Ratification to guarantee the independence and neutrality of Thailand.\n\n7. Ratification of the status of the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan as “the Centre of Peace Promotion” which shall not be violated by anyone.\n\n8. Consideration the use of the world’s single currency.\n\n9. Consideration to reduce or destroy war arms of every kind especially those weapons of mass destruction. (W.M.D.).\n\n10.

Consideration of righteous conduct for one’s self so that one can attain his/her physical and mental health with high morality.\n\n6. Participation\n\nTo have worldwide participation, an official invitation had been extended to the political, religious and peace leaders around the world. It was interesting to note that more than 200 prominent world figures acknowledged the receipt of this invitation to attend this historic conference even though the actual date for the conference had not yet been fixed.\n\n7. Fixing the Date for the World Eternal Peace Conference\n\nIn October 1981, after attending an NGO meeting of the UN Department of Information Affairs as the IFR was an associated body with the United Nations, he discussed with the United Nations on the suitable date of the World Eternal Peace Conference. The date for the Peace Conference was then fixed for September 5th-12th, 1982 at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan, Ratchaburi Province, Thailand.\n\n8. Asking for a Message to read on the First day of the Peace Conference\n\nRequest was sent out for messages from some prominent world and religious\n\nLeaders to be read at the Conference Opening Ceremony and to be printed in the commemorative books to be distributed on the day of the conference. The request was well accepted and many messages received. The World Peace Envoy viewed that Thailand had a suitable geographical area, not very large and not very small, with a ruler who was a patron of all religions, with good culture and tradition and people that can freely choose their faith. If the peace conference could be organized, a proposal would be submitted to the conference to adopt a resolution setting up “the Centre of the World Religions,” “the Centre of the World Cultures” and “the Centre of the World Peace” at the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan. Thailand would be well known the world over for its peace promoting initiatives.\n\nHowever, when the IFR and the Religious Land Hooppha Sawan faced with troubles in 1982, the World Peace Envoy wrote to political, religious and peace leaders worldwide reporting on the unability to hold the Peace Conference as planned.\n\nSCOPE AND QUANTITY OF WORKS\n\nDr. Suchart Kosolkitiwong was responsible for many broad scopes of work. He had to perform according to the objectives of Samnak Poo Sawan and launched works of the Religious Land H"
