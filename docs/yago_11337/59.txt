The Chakri Dynasty has been established since 1782, spanning 242 years of history. Before King Rama X ascended to the throne in 2019, the Thai Chakri dynasty had witnessed 9 reigns.

After the complete collapse of the Ayutthaya kingdom, a Siamese general named Taksin rose to the throne. Taksin the Great was the sole king of the Thonburi Kingdom. Following a coup in 1782, King Taksin was deposed. General Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok seized power and established the Chakri dynasty. He assumed the title Rama I (King of Kings).

Since then, the entire land of Thailand has been under the rule of the Chakri dynasty to this day. Upon ascending the throne, King Rama I decided to relocate the capital to the east bank of the Chao Phraya River. Later, this area developed into the bustling capital of Bangkok.

If King Rama I laid the foundation for a prosperous nation, then Rama II propelled and developed the culture further. By the reign of King Rama III, efforts were made to establish peaceful relations with Western powers to avoid the fate of being invaded like neighboring countries.
