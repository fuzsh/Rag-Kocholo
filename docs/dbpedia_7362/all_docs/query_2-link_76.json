We compared three methods of measuring asthma in the Danish National Birth Cohort (n>50.000). When the children were 7 years old, the prevalence of asthma was estimated from a self-administered questionnaire using parental report of doctor diagnoses, ICD-10 diagnoses from a population-based hospitalization registry, and data on anti-asthmatic medication from a population-based prescription registry. We assessed the agreement between the methods using kappa statistics. Highest prevalence of asthma was found using the prescription registry (32.2%) followed by the self-report (12.0%) and the hospitalization registry (6.6%). We found a substantial non-overlap between the methods (kappa = 0.21–0.38). When all three methods were combined the asthma prevalence was 3.6%. In conclusion, self-reported asthma, ICD-10 diagnoses from a hospitalization registry and data on anti-asthmatic medication use from a prescription registry lead to different prevalences of asthma in the same cohort of children. The non-overlap between the methods may be due to different abilities of the methods to identify cases with different phenotypes, in which case they should be treated as separate outcomes in future aetiological studies.",

        "text": "Discussion\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the largest population-based study to simultaneously employ and compare three different asthma classification methods that are commonly used separately in epidemiological studies. Case ascertainment by means of self-report, a hospitalization registry, and a prescription registry yielded variable estimates of asthma prevalence during the first 7 years of age ranging from 6.6%–32.7%. Moreover, our study revealed a substantial non-overlap between cases identified by the three methods resulting in a prevalence of 3.6% if all three methods were combined to define asthma. Measures of agreement were low (kappa = 0.21–0.38).\n\nPrevalence measures of asthma are difficult to compare across settings because of the lack of a “gold standard”. Another Danish study that employed ICD-10 codes of asthma in the DNPR found a prevalence of 5.0% of asthma in a cohort of children followed from birth to 12 years of age [15], which is consistent with our findings, despite an older study population. A population-based study from Norway that used data on prescriptions on anti-asthmatic medication from the Norwegian Prescription Database found a 12-month asthma prevalence of 9.1% among all Norwegian children aged 0–19 [16]. Compared to the prescription data prevalence reported in the present study, the Norwegian prevalence seems low, but this may be explained by the quite different outcome definitions and prevalence measures that were employed in the two studies. In a population of Canadian children aged 5 to 9 years, Yang et al. found a prevalence of asthma by self-reports of 15.7% and 21.1% using health claims [17]. The same question from the ISAAC questionnaire was used to define self-reported asthma as in our study. The health claims diagnosis was defined as at least one hospitalization for asthma at any time during the child’s life or two separate ambulatory or emergency room visits for asthma within a two year frame and had been validated against an expert consensus diagnosis of asthma [18]. While the self-report prevalence concurs quite well with our findings, the prevalence of the asthma health claims diagnosis cannot be directly compared to any of our results, since our registry data do not include primary care physicians’ diagnoses, whereas the employed Canadian health claims data do [18].\n\nOverall, studies using self-report of asthma have yielded a range of different prevalences, illustrated for example by the ISAAC study, which reported 12-months prevalences of asthma ranging from 1.6–36.8% using the same standardized questionnaire in different populations [19].\n\nThe overall agreement of the asthma classification methods in our study was low, with kappa-values below 0.40 for all comparisons. This is in contrast to the results reported in the aforementioned study by Yang et al. that compared self-reported asthma with asthma diagnosis based on health claims data and found an overall agreement of kappa = 0.60 [17]. The better agreement with self-report in the study by Yang et al. may be due to the inclusion of primary care physicians’ diagnoses which are lacking in our study. However, as in our study, the agreement between the methods was higher when classifying non-cases.\n\nA recent study by Nwaru et al. compared self-reported measures of asthma from a Finnish version of the ISAAC questionnaire with purchase of at least one anti-asthmatic medication during the preceding 12 months and found that the self-reported measures had a 98% agreement both with regard to classifying cases and non-cases of asthma [20]. Self-reported asthma was defined as a child with any wheezing symptom or use of asthma medication during the preceding 12 months plus ever asthma (with or without a doctor confirmation) and the definition of asthma based on the prescription registry included children with at least one prescription. The definitions therefore differ from those used in our study, both with regard to the prevalence period as well as the symptom-based definition which may explain the higher agreement of the compared measures in the Finnish study. Other studies that have compared self-reported measures of asthma and prescription data have found lower agreement between the methods [21], [22].\n\nThe variable prevalence estimates across the three methods that we employed, and the substantial non-overlap between the cases they identified, are noteworthy. The correct interpretation of this is hampered by the fact that we have not assessed the true prevalence of asthma in our population which would require a clinical assessment of each individual. It is reasonable to assume that the three methods we employed may have different error sources and thus variable degrees of misclassification for a given biological phenotype. However, for the case definition using the prescription register data, we used a validated definition of asthma that has previously been shown in a study by Moth et al. to have a specificity of 0.86 and a sensitivity of 0.63 compared with discharge information and a questionnaire completed by general practitioners in those without a discharge diagnosis [14]. For self-reported measures, poor recall of past events could have affected the results, although we believe this would not lead to any systematic over- or underreporting of the conditions.\n\nWhile different error sources may explain some of the variance in the prevalences of asthma among the assessment methods, it is also possible that the three methods identify asthma cases with biologically distinct phenotypes. For example, the hospitalization registry may capture more severe phenotypes than the prescription registry or maternal self-report. The overrepresentation of more severe cases when using this classification method may however be appropriate for studies of aetiological associations if hospitalized cases have a different phenotypical aetiology compared to the cases identified using the other methods. In contrast, the prescription registry may identify a heterogeneous mix of cases, ranging from suspected asthma cases that may have been prescribed anti-asthmatic medication to clarify a diagnosis to more severe cases that continuously require anti-asthmatic treatment. A study showed that 13.9% of all children in Denmark aged 0–15 years had redeemed prescriptions of at least one anti-asthmatic drug in one year but not all of these children had received an asthma diagnosis leading to an overestimation of the asthma prevalence [23]. This is also true for the self-reported diagnosis for asthma that also may comprise a broad spectrum of cases with respiratory symptoms ranging from mild to severe, including wheezing.\n\nWheezing symptoms in young children aged 0–3 years are common and many are prescribed anti-asthmatic mediations [24]. These wheezing symptoms are often transient or viral-induced and later remit [5]. Including the transient wheezers in the asthma measures may dilute possible associations between exposures and clinically relevant asthma and this may have implications for studies of aetiological associations. When we excluded the first three years of life from the register data and compared it to current self-reported asthma we did not, however, find an overall increased agreement between the methods. This supports the conclusion that the three methods may not identify the same asthma cases and that the outcomes may represent different phenotypes of asthma.\n\nThe extent to which the non-overlap between the methods may be due to misclassification or, to different phenotypes being identified by each method, has implications for how to use these methods in studies where each individual has been assessed by more than one method simultaneously. Assuming that the methods identify a single phenotype, methods can be combined. In aetiologic studies of asthma where the aim is to estimate a relative risk for a given factor high specificity may be desirable even at the expense of lower sensitivity; this could be obtained by requiring that two or more methods agree on the asthma case ascertainment. For example, the self-reported measures could be used in combination with the prescription register definition to define an asthma case which in our study would lead to an asthma prevalence of 10.2% On the other hand, assuming that the methods identify different phenotypes we may need to do separate analyses, one for each case definition.\n\nIn conclusion, our large-scale prospective study comparing three different methods for asthma ascertainment revealed a substantial non-overlap between cases identified by the three methods. Reflective of either different biases or different phenotypical expressions of asthma, these classifications need to be carefully considered when deciding on asthma outcomes in future aetiological studies."
