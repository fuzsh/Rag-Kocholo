        "text": "The Æsir and Their Idols\n\nJonas Wellendorf, University of California, Berkeley\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the early eighteenth century, a vicar of Western Telemark in central Norway visited the farm Flatland. An evil plague had struck the farmer, his family, and all of his livestock. As if this were not enough, the farmer’s harvest had failed. The vicar soon discovered that the farmer harbored an ancient idol that had survived through generations, and with a fervor proper to the pietistic spirit of his time, the clergyman smote the ulcerous member of his flock with the lightning of the godly word. The farmer reluctantly admitted giving shelter to the idol, but he denied ever having directed any worship towards it. As the vicar was shown to the place where the abominable object was kept, he was horrified to see a decaying piece of wood onto which a hoary chisel ignorant of heaven had sculpted something not quite resembling a human face. The wooden idol, it turned out, was known by the name of Gudmund. The vicar commanded that it be destroyed, but when no one reacted, he seized an axe, chopped the worm-eaten idol to pieces and burned it. The farmer afterwards mended his ways, and all were healed.\n\nDoctrine\n\nAmong Scandinavians\n\nThis story has nothing to say about veneration of Þorgarðr, and he is made for the explicit purpose of being sent to Iceland in order to fulfill a specific task. For these reasons, it is obvious that he should not be considered an idol. Nevertheless, we do find some of the same elements as in stories about idols: Þorgarðr is fashioned by human hands and in the image of his maker, he is magnaðr or imbued with strength/power, and the human agent is confident that the effigy will be successful. Jarl Hákon is generally portrayed as a reprehensible character in Old Norse literature, but in this particular anecdote he is successful in his undertaking and is able to exact what the earl must have considered a suitable revenge upon the Icelander Þorleifr jarlsskáld. Had the anecdote involved a confrontation with a Christian missionary rather than a pagan skald, the outcome would surely have been different, but in the pagan context in which the acts of the earl are portrayed, they cannot be considered immediately objectionable. We might even see the account about the how the long dead Saint Mercurius killed Julian the Apostate with his spear as a parallel (Maríu saga pp. 699–702).\n\nAmong Their gods\n\nI wish to stress the importance of perspective by returning to Gudmund, the idol who might have been venerated by Norwegian peasants in the early eighteenth century. In 1959, the Norwegian folklorist Olav Bø devoted a long study to the traces of early modern Norwegian idolatry. He argued that the effigies mentioned by Pontoppidan and a number of other sources did not originate as images of pagan gods but were originally statues of saints or remains of supporting pillars of stave churches with humanoid faces carved onto them. In the wake of the Reformation, churches were purged of their old papist interiors, including figures of saints. Some of these effects fell into disuse and were repurposed. The status of the statues of the saints then was unstable, just like that of the Old Norse gods and their cult figures had been centuries before. The post-Reformation material allows us to follow the development of their ontological standing more closely and through additional reversals of fortune. Like the Old Norse gods and their statues, the statues of saints were degraded to idols and discarded, but some were salvaged and elevated to gods by peasants, only to be degraded once again to idols and smashed by zealous Lutheran vicars.\n\nAccounts of the destruction of idols are conventional narratives that present a standardized sequence of events, although details may vary from one text to the other. The multitude and longevity of such accounts show that they remained popular through millennia. At the same time, these accounts are often stereotypical to such an extent that it is an insurmountable challenge to penetrate the layers of convention and uncover a historical reality in which representations of pagan gods lost their divine status and came to be identified as idols. The texts discussed in this article nevertheless demonstrate how the undoubtedly long and complex process of conversion to Christianity came to be remembered as a series of stand-offs between champions of the Church and of the pagans.\n\nWorks cited\n\nPrimary sources\n\nBarbǫru saga\n\nBarthólómeus saga postula\n\nBiblia sacra vulgata\n\nEiðsifaþingslǫg: Kristinn réttr hinn forni\n\nEinarr skálaglamm: see Vellekla\n\nEverriculum fermenti veteris\n\nFóstbrœðra saga\n\nGrímnismál: see Poetic Edda\n\nGylfaginning\n\nHallfreðar saga\n\nHauks þáttr Hábrókar\n\nHávamál: see Poetic Edda\n\nHorace\n\nHymiskviða: see Poetic Edda\n\nJómsvíkinga saga\n\nKonungs skuggsjá\n\nLandnámabók\n\nLárentíus saga biskups\n\nLegendary Saga of St. Óláfr\n\nLíkneskjusmíð\n\nMaríu saga\n\nÓláfs saga Tryggvasonar\n\nPétrs saga postula I\n\nPoetic Edda\n\nPorphyry\n\nRagnars saga loðbrókar\n\nRǫgnvalds þáttr ok Rauðs\n\nSeparate Saga of St. Óláfr\n\nSkáldskaparmál\n\nStjórn\n\nSveins þáttr ok Finns\n\nTveggja postula saga Pétrs ok Páls\n\nVatnsdœla saga\n\nVellekla\n\nVafþrúðnismál: see Poetic Edda\n\nVǫluspá: see Poetic Edda\n\nÞorleifs þáttr jarlsskálds\n\nǪgmundar þáttr dýtts\n\nSecondary Sources\n\nFootnotes"
