        "text": "Attention Needed - Article Stub\n\nThis particular article is still lacking the necessary information, images, and/or general formatting.\n\nYou can assist Ragnarok Wiki by improving it.\n\nThat's who you are. The one who must fight evil at any cost.\n\n-Wotan Wagner to Magne\n\nMagne Seier (portrayed by David Stakston) is the main protagonist in the Netflix Original Series Ragnarok. He is the student of Edda Secondary School and later, Signy's boyfriend who struggles to make Jutul family, the affluential family who owned Jutul Industries A/S, change their company's flawed practices which didn't bode well to the environment surrounding Edda.\n\nOver the course of the series, due to his paranoid schizophrenia and passion towards anything related to Norse Mythology which adapted into his favorite comic book series, the tale of his struggle in changing Jutul family was filtered by his fantasy which reimagined himself as the reincarnation of Thor the God of Thunder. Jutul family was similarly reimagined as Jötnar, specifically Ragnarök veterans just as his friends and father figure Wotan Wagner reimagined and Odin and his fellow reincarnated Gods of Asgard. As his struggle came to a close, so did his fantasy. Upon his \"death\" at hands of Jörmungandr, Magne found his closure and inner peace, able to move on from his issues at last.\n\nBiography[]\n\nMagne was born and spent some of his early childhood in Edda. When his father Asbjørn died in an accident, he, his mother Turid and his brother Laurits moved away. Magne grew up into a shy teenager, who was still trying to overcome his father's absence. Due to some undiagnosed mental health and learning difficulties, Magne found it difficult to integrate into ordinary life. He found solace in his favorite comic book series which tells about the adventures of Thor and to greater extent, Norse Mythology itself. Upon returning to his hometown, Magne's life changed.\n\nUpon his arrival, Magne helps an old man on an electric scooter to switch the scooter back on. By helping the old man leading to the old lady who witnessed his act of kindness thanking him, the young man's journey which filtered by fantasy born from combination or his emotional and mental issues as well as aforementioned mythology began; the old lady rubbed her hand on his forehead, awakening his true nature as Thor reincarnated. Another catalyst of this journey was the tragic death of Isolde Eidsvoll from paragliding accident which, in his perspective, implied to be due to blood curse casted by an evil being.\n\nFrom there, Magne rapidly noticed changes in himself. The most notable of which was that he now possessed superhuman strength and sharper senses, not even needing his glasses anymore. One night, after getting drunk off of mead at Jutulheim, Magne goes to wash his face and sees himself as Thor in the mirror, which confirms that he is Thor reborn.\n\nMagne ends up engaging in a battle against the Giants, still present on earth, while trying to adapt to the new skills he has acquired.\n\nThroughout the Series[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nAs the Seiers drive into Edda, their car gets stuck behind an old man on an electric scooter in the middle of the road, who comes to a halt trying to turn right. Magne decides to get out of the car and tries to help the old man. While he is in the process of helping him, an old woman comes out of a hair salon and sees Magne. She approaches him, telling him that he is a good boy, and looks up at him intensely before touching his forehead. A change flickers through his eyes. This confuses Magne and makes him feel awkward, when he gets back in the car, he tries to roll up the car window, only succeeding in breaking the door handle. He then has the odd sense that it is about to rain, which his mother challenges, only for rain to suddenly start to pour down.\n\nOnce they get to their new home, Laurits complains that they will be living beside a drug dealer. Magne pays attention to a brochure lying by their mailbox, as he picks it up to try to read what it says, his vision becomes blurry and he takes his glasses off to discover he can see perfectly.\n\nMagne and Laurits arrive at the local high school Edda Secondary School to attend. They are put in front of the class and introduced by Erik, their history teacher. He asks them to look for an available seat next to a student named Gry, who seems to be of Magne's interest, but in an act of mischief, Laurits steals the seat and Magne ends up sitting next to green advocate Isolde, whom he becomes friends with.\n\nIsolde later dies when she appears to paraglide into power lines. That rainy night, a distraught Magne holds his father's sledge hammer as lightning fills the sky. He throws the hammer and it disappears into the clouds.\n\nAs the high school mourns Isolde's death, Magne suspects it was not an accident. His enquiries begin to disturb the Jutul's. He learns the hammer he threw went over 1500 metres and embedded itself in Vidar Jutul's car.\n\nMagne learns that he can run superhumanly fast, and is uninjured when he's hit by a snowplow traveling 50 km/h. The Jutuls invite him to dinner and after drinking mead, he realizes the family is not as they seem, such as mother Ran Jutul holds him to a standstill, then defeats him at arm-wrestling, after Magne looked at her and saw her as an old woman. When he goes to the bathroom to wash his face, he looks in the mirror, and he sees himself as a bearded warrior.\n\nMagne goes jogging the next morning, and decides to punch a tree to test his strength. When he does, his hands do not get hurt and he punches the tree some more, until his last punch breaks down the tree. He later looks up on the internet about mead in Norse mythology. He then learns about the Old Gods, and that his powers were awakened by the old woman. He goes to her at the grocery store and she tells him everything.\n\nMagne continues Isolde's work in investigating the Jutuls and their role in Edda's water pollution problem while learning more about his abilities and evading the increasingly suspicious Jutuls. Magne and the Jutul's son, Fjor, are both romantically interested in Gry, who seems to care about both. On a school trip up the mountains Magne confesses his love for Gry but she chooses to go off with Fjor, seemingly embarrassed at Magne's admission.\n\nAfter seeing Vidar cutting up raw reindeer meat, Magne realizes that it matches the same blood from Isolde's jacket at the time of her death. Magne then deduces that Vidar was behind Isolde's death all along, and warns him that he will not get away with it. After Magne follows Fjor and Gry, Vidar sends Trym, the hellhound, to kill him. However, Trym proves to be no match for Magne, who kills him.\n\nMagne is punished for killing Trym, as no one else knows of the strange happenings and see him only as a troubled boy, and when he proposes to submit an assignment critical of Jutul Industries, he is forced to return Isolde's laptop to Erik, who had given it to him. To make amends, Erik gives Magne Isolde's mobile phone, which he found high on the mountain. Magne succeeds in unlocking it and finds the incriminating photos Isolde had taken of the cavern in the mountains. He goes up the mountain and discovers 2,500 barrels belonging to Jutul Industries leaking toxic waste. Magne reports the existence of the barrel store to the police but when they go to find them the toxic barrels have disappeared (as the police had pre-notified the Jutuls of the visit). Magne is not taken seriously by the police and the school authorities and he is excluded from the school subject to psychological evaluation.\n\nMagne is diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic by the psychiatrist and is prescribed antipsychotic drugs, which he refuses to take. Fjor informs Magne that he was correct about the toxic barrels from Jutul Industries, and reveals that they are going to be shipped away from Edda. Someone, presumably Magne, dumps some toxic barrels on the police station steps and they begin an investigation in spite of Vidar's attempts to intimidate the police chief. Fjor takes Gry to an abandoned warehouse and starts to attack her, but Magne intervenes and saves her life. Vidar appears, identifies Magne as Thor and attacks him. Before he does, Magne warns Fjor and Gry to run.\n\nMagne is almost overcome by Vidar, but he calls up lightning and, directing a bolt from the sky, uses it to strike Vidar, presumably killing him. Magne is hurt by the lightning as well, but it appears that he survived the strike, as just before the screen fades, he closes his hand into a fist.\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nThe second season picks up right where the first season left off, with Magne calling up the lighting bolt from the sky to strike Vidar, which ended up hurting him as well, though nobody was killed. Wenche was there watching them fight and then flew away, turning into an eagle. Magne runs up to the mountains seeking for answers from Wenche, she takes him into a different realm where Magne finds out that he as to wait for the battle, and that he is not alone. He has to gather up the other Gods. Magne asks Laurits to be on his side on the great battle, but Laurits still finds it hard to believe Magne.\n\nThough happy by the news of his name has been cleared now that Jutul Industries A/S' shady activities became known to the public thanks to his more clever decision to dump some of its toxic barrels right in front of police station as told by Erik, Magne knows better he can't just relax yet given to his newfound mission. As per Erik's input (the history teacher didn't know about Magne's discovery about his true self as Thor reincarnated thus assuming it part of lessons he missed), he browsed everything he can about the thunder god in internet. Soon, Magne finds his first ally Iman (who is the reincarnation of Freyja) to fight the giants.\n\nOne night, Magne and Laurits sneak into the Jutulheim to forge Mjölnir in what they mistakenly think is the eternal fire in the living room. They are caught by Vidar, and Laurits is labelled as a traitor. Magne, Laurits, and Iman meet Odin. Later, when Vidar and Laurits go to Jutulheim, Magne follows. When Vidar was about to kill Laurits, Magne interferes. Magne and Vidar fight, and Vidar dies from being impaled by his own axe.\n\nMagne regrets killing Vidar as it alienated Laurits, who doesn't believe that Vidar was going to kill him. Magne, disheartened, drops out of the fight and leaves his hammer to Odin. Iman tries to get Magne to join the fight again, but Magne refuses. In the mountains, Magne begs the heavens to take his powers, and during Vidar's funeral, he does the same.\n\nMagne finds out that his prayers worked and he lost his powers, he was relieved. When Magne hears from his mom that Fjor fired her because of Laurits, he got furious and tried to antagonize Fjor. But he didn't have any powers anymore, leading Fjor to knock him down. Magne turns back to Odin asking for his powers back but he wasn't welcome anymore as Iman had Harry in his place. Magne tries to stop thinking about it, but he couldn't ignore the fact that his team was using their powers selfishly. Magne again tried to talk to Odin and asks him if there's a way to do this without killing anyone, but he tells him there is no other way which really frustrates him. When Ran tries to harm Laurits at home, Magne steps in trying to defend his brother, but without his powers he can't do anything. That's when he decides to do whatever it takes to win the battle and goes back to Odin to actually ask for his powers back and accepts that he would do whatever is necessary. Odin tells him that his greatest weapon, Mjölnir, is the only way by which he can stand a chance against the Giants. Magne decides to lie to Laurits for the sake of the world to get the key of Jutulheim, which Saxa gave to him.\n\nMagne, Wotan, Iman and Harry, accompanied by Halvor, set out to Jutul Industries. Magne tricks Laurits into giving him the key to unlock the old warehouse where the ancient forge was located. Wotan distracts the guards while the others sneak into the warehouse. The guards inform Fjor and he sets out to the old warehouse. In the Warehouse, Iman keeps guard while Magne and Harry, along with Halvor manage to locate the ancient forge and start crafting Mjölnir. Meanwhile, Iman and Harry engage in a fight with Fjor who overpowers them and severely injures Harry. They manage to craft Mjölnir and Magne returns home while the others get caught. As a result, Iman and Halvor are fired from the hospital. Magne tries throwing the hammer, but his powers don't return. Later, Magne notices the pet in Laurits' room. Then, storms rage in the skies again, as the news of the Jutuls' victory enrages Magne, who discovers that it was lightning that created Thor. As he takes his hammer, he is confronted by Laurits, who realizes that Magne lied to him. Magne leaves anyway and awakens the hammer, causing his powers to return. Magne goes to Jutulheim to face Fjor, only to find an injured Saxa there. Saxa offers to help Magne and they end up having intimate intercourse. Later, as the Jutuls are about to leave, after beating up Laurits, Magne appears in front of them and attacks them with Mjölnir, destroying their car. However, before he can finish them Laurits calls for him, having been severely injured by the Giants. Magne rushes to attend to his brother and the Giants escape.\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nWith the power of Mjölnir in the hands of the Gods, Wotan wants them to move quickly to kill the Giants. Magne hesitates though, afraid that his brother will be killed in the ensuring conflict, as promised by the Giants. The fellowship of the Gods breaks up as a result, and Magne hides the hammer away.\n\nUltimately, it is revealed that Magne is delusional suffering from paranoid schizophrenia, which was an earlier diagnosis in season 1. It is shown that coming back to the place where he lost his father as a child and soon after arriving losing his first and only friend Isolde caused a fracture in his reality from the tramua. We see as the final episode of the season unfolds that the fantasy of Ragnarok was inspired by \"Young Thor\" comics he read as a child after losing his father, and everything supernatural that occurred happened in his head.\n\nThe powers, the magic, the Gods and the Giants are all part of an elaborate world created in Magne's head. In the final episode as he is breaking out of the fantasy, throwing away his comics, and finally starting a serious relationship with Signy, there are changes in perception such as the Jutuls house transforming from a castle-like building to a well-built house on the hill. With the death of his Thor persona at the hands of the Midgard Serpent, Magne recognises that he is finally ready to move forward, onto his real life.\n\nThat being said, Magne never imagined supernatural adventures he went through as Thor reincarnated while doing nothing. The struggle to end Jutul Industries' controversial practices against environment, being joined by friends and a new father figure in it, and the rift between him and Laurits for the latter's relation with Jutuls were all genuine albeit seen through his perspective which filtered by his fantasies.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nMagne is polite, quiet and a good boy. He is also straightforward and doesn't keep secrets. This is revealed when he casually reveals his love for Gry Isungset in front of his peers.[1] He believes in what is right and just. He can be quick to temper in matters of injustice and evil. Magne is very down to earth and tries to help anyone as much as he can. He doesn't care much about conformity, how others percieve him in terms of popularity or what is \"cool\" which we see when he confidently sits with Isolde knowing it might ostracise him.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nMagne is tall, blonde, has blue eyes, and he originally wore glasses until his sight got better, thanks to his true nature being unlocked. However, due to the reveal that the whole thing is in Magne's head, this becomes difficult to explain. It is not known how or why his eyesight became better.\n\nFamily[]\n\nMagne's father, Asbjørn died in an accident when he was a young child. His mother raised him and his brother Laurits as a struggling single mother.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nPowers and Abilities[]\n\nMagne possesses all of Thor's powers and abilities, like:\n\nSuperhuman Strength: Magne has super strength, enabling him for example to move a car by himself, break down a tree with his fists, and also throw a hammer over 1537 meters and later 571 meters. In episode 1 of season 2 he effortlessly bend a metal baseball bat. He is also far from his maximum potential as his strength grows each seasons. He can also harms other deities like The Giants. He can lift heavy things with absolutely no effort, like when he lifted Iman Reza sit in a chair with a microwave.\n\nSuperhuman Durability: Magne has the ability to withstand unnaturally high levels of physical harm. His limits are unknow as his powers are not in their maximals. He can survive attacks from other superhuman being like Vidar Jutul. Even with no powers he could take the strength of Fjor Jutul only by his constitution.\n\nSuperhuman Speed: Magne can run 100 meters in seven seconds (6.98 Seconds), faster than the world record. This ability also give Magne better reflexes, in fight he could dodge attacks from other superhuman beings like Vidar Jutul.\n\nEnhanced Senses: Magne has extremely accurate senses, allowing him to see, hear, smell, taste, and feel better than an average being.\n\nAccelerated-Healing Factor: Magne gets bitten by Trym, but the wound on his arm heals in a matter of minutes. His vision also got better after he got his powers but we don't know if it's because of his healing factor or his enchanced senses.\n\nImmortality: Because he is the reincarnation of Thor, he possesses immortality: an endless lifespan, as he can never die, never age, and can shrug off virtually any kind of physical damage.\n\nDivine Weather Manipulation: While he doesn't control it purposefully and it is instead fueled by strong emotions, Magne can make it rain and summon a thunderstorm with his powers. He also can predict the weather.\n\nElectrokinesis: Magne can use both his hands and the hammer Mjölnir to summon, create, shape and manipulate electricity, such as lightning.\n\nPowers not yet developed:\n\nAbsolute Combat:\n\nDivine Lightning Manipulation:\n\nLightning bolt projection:\n\nStorm manipulation:\n\nSkyed Energy Manipulation:\n\nHoly cosmic manipulation:\n\nSky manipulation:\n\nPurification:\n\nSoil manipulation:\n\nFertility inducement:\n\nPlanet-Earth manipulation:\n\nWeaknesses[]\n\nOld World Weapons: Being a Norse God, apparently Magne can only die if he is wounded with weapons from the Old World.\n\nEquipment[]\n\nMjölnir[]\n\nAs Thor's reincarnation, Magne wields the Thunder-God's hammer Mjölnir, the world's most powerful weapon. Like Thor, Magne uses the hammer to defeat the giants. When he throws the hammer, it always returns to his hand.\n\nEpisodes[]\n\nGallery[]\n\nMagne Seier/Gallery\n\nTrivia[]\n\nMagne is neurodiverse, but in what way is never specified. Most likely he is autistic. He is shown to have had problems with aggression in the past and uses a stim toy to focus. The only clear diagnosis we hear is that he has dyslexia.\n\nInterestingly, the name given to the character refers to Thor's son, Magni. According to mythology, Magni is the result of a relationship between Thor and the giant Járnsaxa.\n\nHis Super Empowering probably doesn't count, but in his climactic fight with Vidar at the end of Season One, Magne summons lightning to end the fight. At the start of Season Two, Vidar explicitly notes this is a sign Magne is close to attaining his true power as Thor, and has become much more dangerous (especially since he did it without his hammer). Shortly after, Magne's strength and muscle mass increase dramatically, such that by the middle of Season Two, his rematch with Vidar is far more even."
