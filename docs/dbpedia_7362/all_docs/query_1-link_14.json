Joe Nguyễn has deep roots in the community. His experiences and involvement with the community makes him an ardent champion for investing in Washington families and residents, expanding economic opportunities, and marks him as a bold leader in our fight against the climate crisis.\n\nJoe is the Chair of the Environment, Energy & Technology Committee. He also serves as the Vice Chair of the budget-writing Ways & Means Committee and sits on the Human Services Committee. Elected to the Senate in 2019, he has spent his tenure advocating for working families and community members who historically have been left out of the political process. His priorities mirror the committees he serves on.\n\nThroughout his first term, Joe has prioritized increased funding for social services. He has championed legislation to modernize and increase access to basic needs programs, like raising funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program. He has helped make historic investments in affordable housing and alleviating the homelessness crisis. Joe has also been a staunch leader to reform our criminal justice system. For example, legislation he championed has expunged cannabis-related misdemeanors, a measure that works to address the disproportionately higher rates at which BIPOC and lower-income communities have been prosecuted.\n\nJoe has been a thoughtful and innovative leader in his efforts to mitigate the climate crisis. He knows only too well how marginalized communities experience environmental harm disproportionately, and that to ensure that our communities thrive as a whole, we need to act urgently. His sponsored legislation has increased availability of zero emissions vehicles and expanded the Clean Buildings Act.\n\nJoe recognizes the talent and potential of Washington’s students. To provide students equal access to education, he sponsored legislation to allow Community and Technical Colleges to offer four-year computer science degrees. That work has allowed Washington students, particularly students of color and low-income students, to access opportunities in a rapidly growing and competitive computer science industry.\n\nJoe resides in West Seattle with his family.\n\nA Fellow of the British Advance Higher Education Academy, Prof. Joseph Iannelli serves as the education and research liaison to European Universities for the entire Washington State University (WSU) system, where he also serves as a full professor in the Voiland College of Engineering and Architecture. He has been contributing to global-engagement initiatives for over 14 years, having negotiated transatlantic-collaboration Memoranda of Understanding between WSU and 17 European Union (EU) universities and 8 Reciprocal Student Exchange agreements with as many EU universities, including 4 universities in Denmark and Sweden. He finds himself at home in the Scandinavian cultures, having visited Denmark and Sweden five times in as many years, met with internalization officers in those countries’ universities, forged mutually beneficial partnerships, and led cohorts of US students to study in Sweden. His work in international relations is guided by three strategic objectives:\n\n• Educating diverse internationally-minded students for leadership in multicultural globalized societies\n\n• Establishing mutually-beneficial international partnerships to advance knowledge more effectively than allowed by the resources of any single institution\n\n• Securing transatlantic domestic and international funding to support students, professors, and staff in international experiences.\n\nHis contributions include an international double internship program with Bosch, the development of a transatlantic plant science research collaboration between WSU and the University of Cologne, the establishment of WSU’s International Double Master’s degree program, jointly with Switzerland’s Zürich University of Applied Sciences, and the development of an international Mission-to-Mars workshop, presented at France’s University of Lorraine and produced online by Austria’s Technology University of Graz. Together with colleagues at Linköping University he has developed the STARS.Se (Student Training And Research Semesters ) international program in Sweden, which integrates a traditional exchange semester with research projects carried out by integrated teams of US and Swedish students. The program fosters the development of deep relations among US and Scandinavian students and has attracted support from Boeing, Saab, NSF, STINT, and Erasmus+.\n\nMs. Williams is NW Natural’s Vice President, Chief Public Affairs and Sustainability Officer.
