Endothelin-1 and -2 activate two G-protein coupled receptors, ETA and ETB, with equal affinity, whereas endothelin-3 has a lower affinity for the ETA subtype. Genes encoding the peptides are present only among vertebrates. The ligand-receptor signaling pathway is a vertebrate innovation and may reflect the evolution of endothelin-1 as the most potent vasoconstrictor in the human cardiovascular system with remarkably long lasting action. Highly selective peptide ETA and ETB antagonists and ETB agonists together with radiolabeled analogs have accurately delineated endothelin pharmacology in humans and animal models, although surprisingly no ETA agonist has been discovered. ET antagonists (bosentan, ambrisentan) have revolutionized the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension, with the next generation of antagonists exhibiting improved efficacy (macitentan). Clinical trials continue to explore new applications, particularly in renal failure and for reducing proteinuria in diabetic nephropathy. Translational studies suggest a potential benefit of ETB agonists in chemotherapy and neuroprotection. However, demonstrating clinical efficacy of combined inhibitors of the endothelin converting enzyme and neutral endopeptidase has proved elusive. Over 28 genetic modifications have been made to the ET system in mice through global or cell-specific knockouts, knock ins, or alterations in gene expression of endothelin ligands or their target receptors. These studies have identified key roles for the endothelin isoforms and new therapeutic targets in development, fluid-electrolyte homeostasis, and cardiovascular and neuronal function. For the future, novel pharmacological strategies are emerging via small molecule epigenetic modulators, biologicals such as ETB monoclonal antibodies and the potential of signaling pathway biased agonists and antagonists.\n\nI. Historical Introduction\n\nThe vasoconstrictor actions of a factor obtained from the culture media of bovine aortic endothelial cells was first characterized in 1985 by Hickey et al. (1985) and was proposed to have the chemical composition of a peptide, because trypsin abolished the observed activity. The structure of this endothelium-derived constricting factor was identified in 1988 by Yanagisawa et al. (1988) from the supernatant of porcine aortic endothelial cells and named endothelin (now called endothelin-1 or ET-1). This remarkable paper ignited worldwide interest in both academia and the pharmaceutical industry by showing that ET-1 was the most potent vasoconstrictor identified to date, producing extremely powerful contraction of a range of mammalian blood vessels in vitro, including human arteries and veins. The response was unusually long lasting and difficult to wash out ( ). In the anesthetized denervated rat, in vivo ET-1 caused a rise in arterial pressure, and this pressor response was typically sustained for more than 1 hour. In the same year, the sarafotoxins, a family of peptides with high degree of sequence similarity to ET-1, were identified from the venom of a snake Atractaspis engaddensis or burrowing asp (Kloog et al., 1988; Takasaki et al., 1988). In accord with the actions of ET-1 in vivo, the symptoms of envenomation included very powerful contraction of the coronary arteries sufficient to cause the heart to stop. In humans, two further peptides, endothelin-2 (ET-2) and endothelin-3 (ET-3), were identified (Inoue et al., 1989) to complete the family of endogenous endothelin agonists. Pharmacological preparations such as rat aorta and rabbit pulmonary artery were initially identified that exhibited differences in the rank order of affinities for the three endogenous ET isoforms, suggesting the presence of two receptor subtypes. A year later, two novel G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) were identified: ETA (Arai et al., 1990) where ET-1 and ET-2 were more potent than ET-3 (ET-1 = ET-2 > ET-3), and ETB (Sakurai et al., 1990), where all three isoforms were equally effective (ET-1 = ET-2 = ET-3).\n\nYanagisawa et al. (1988) correctly predicted the biosynthesis of a 39-amino acid intermediate \"Big endothelin\" from proendothelin by proteolytic cleavage at paired basic residues and the subsequent production of the mature 21-amino acid peptide by a previously unknown processing pathway involving a putative \"endothelin converting enzyme.\" The predicted endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) was discovered (Takahashi et al., 1993, Xu et al., 1994). A second enzyme, ECE-2 (Emoto and Yanagisawa, 1995), was also identified. Thus within 7 years, all the essential components of the ET pathway had been revealed ( and ).\n\nKey milestones in the development of pharmacological agents were the first ETA-selective peptide antagonists, BQ123 (Ihara et al., 1992a) and {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"FR139317\",\"term_id\":\"258103156\",\"term_text\":\"FR139317\"}}FR139317 (Aramori et al., 1993). ETB agonists were identified, including the linear or modified ET-1 sequences [Ala1,3,11,15]-ET-1 (Saeki et al., 1991), BQ3020; (Ihara et al., 1992b), and IRL 1620 (Takai et al., 1992) and the snake venom toxin sarafotoxin 6c (Williams et al., 1991). The first selective peptide ETB antagonist was BQ788 (Ishikawa et al., 1994). It was very clear that the clinical goal was the discovery of orally active, small molecule ET receptor antagonists that would block the potent and long lasting vasoconstrictor actions of ET in the human cardiovascular system. Within 5 years of the discovery of ET-1, the first ETA/ETB antagonist with oral bioavailability was identified by Clozel et al., (1993). Its successor bosentan (Tracleer; Actelion, Allschwil, Switzerland), also a mixed ETA/ETB antagonist, was the first in class to be introduced into the clinic, initially for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (Rubin et al., 2002).\n\nAn ETA-selective antagonist ambrisentan (Letairis, Volibris; Gilead, Foster City, California) was approved for clinical use in PAH in 2007 (Vatter and Seifert, 2006), followed by the more ETA-selective antagonist sitaxentan (Thelin; Pfizer, Groton, Connecticut) (Benza et al., 2007; Galie et al., 2009). However, in 2010 sitaxentan was voluntarily withdrawn by Pfizer (Groton, Connecticut) owing to cases of idiosyncratic hepatitis, resulting in mortality from acute liver failure (Don et al., 2012). Bosentan was the structural basis for the development of macitentan, approved for clinical use in 2013 and representing the next generation of antagonists, being more potent, with longer receptor occupancy as well as undergoing conversion to an active metabolite, properties contributing to greater pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic efficacy (Patel and McKeage, 2014). Despite the success of both mixed receptor and ETA-selective antagonists, the second pharmacological strategy of reducing ET-1 levels by inhibiting ECE has yet to be proven successful in the clinic.\n\nThe aim of this review is to focus on key concepts in the pharmacology of ETs, their receptors, and the interaction of the signaling pathway with agonists, antagonists, and synthetic enzyme inhibitors, particularly in humans, in vitro and in vivo. Remarkably all ET peptides, receptors, and synthetic enzymes have been deleted in mice with many components selectively deleted or overexpressed in specific cell types. The resulting phenotypes have provided insights into their role in the ET signaling pathway, which are evaluated in this review. The third aim is to summarize advances in the clinical pharmacology of ET agents. To date nearly 28,000 endothelin-related papers and reviews have been published. The following should be consulted for more detailed information on ET pharmacology, physiology, and pathology: antagonists (Kohan et al., 2012; Clozel et al., 2013; Maguire and Davenport, 2015), the heart (Drawnel et al., 2013; Chester and Yacoub, 2014; Nasser and El-Mas 2014), kidney (Kohan et al., 2011a,b; Hyndman and Pollock, 2013; Boesen, 2015; Culshaw et al., 2015), vasculature (Sandoval et al., 2014), hypertension (Schiffrin, 2001; Rautureau and Schiffrin, 2012; Speed and Pollock, 2013; Laffin and Bakris, 2015), atherosclerosis and diabetes (Pernow et al., 2012), cancer (Rosanò et al., 2013a; Irani et al., 2014), and PAH (Moorhouse et al., 2013; Miyagawa and Emoto 2014). The International Union of Pharmacology/British Pharmacological Society (IUPHAR/BPS) curated database, Guide to PHARMACOLOGY, provides detailed information on pharmacological parameters for ET ligands (Davenport et al., 2015).\n\nII. Endothelins and Sarafotoxins\n\nA. Endothelin-1 and Big Endothelin-1\n\nThe structure of ET-1, considered the parent compound of the family, is shown in comprising 21 amino acids with a free amino terminus and C-terminal carboxylic acid. Within the endothelins and sarafotoxins residues 1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 15, 16, 18, 20, and 21 are always conserved (Huggins et al., 1993). The ETs are unusual compared with other bioactive peptides because the amino acid residues are linked by two disulfide bonds. A number of three-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structures have been proposed for ET-1 but these have not produced a consensus for its conformation and are difficult to interpret (Wallace and Janes, 1995). ET-1 is one of a very few vasoactive peptides that have been successfully crystalized and the X-ray structure has been solved (Janes et al., 1994). This differs from the various NMR models, particularly in the C-terminal helical tail that is crucial for receptor interaction, and the proposed structure is supported by binding data. A major reason for the variability in NMR is that these use ET-1 in organic solvents, whereas X-ray studies were carried out on crystals from an aqueous solution that better reflects the in vivo environment.\n\nThe structure of ET-1 is unusual among the mammalian bioactive peptides in possessing two intramolecular disulfide bonds between Cys residues crosslinked at positions 1 and 15 and 3 and 11 ( ). Experimentally, residues at positions 10, 13, 14, 17, 18, and 21 are crucial for binding (Huggins et al., 1993; Janes et al., 1994; Orry and Wallace, 2000), with loss of Trp21 for example completely abolishing activity. These residues are located consecutively, separated by two amino acids, which is consistent with a secondary helical structure. X-ray crystallography also suggests there is a helical structure, and these residues are aligned as a stripe ( ).\n\nRadioligand binding studies using [125I]-Big ET-1 demonstrated unequivocally that at physiologic concentrations, despite the presence of the mature sequence within the molecule, Big ET-1 does not bind to either receptor subtype (Russell et al., 1998). Molecular modeling shows that the accessibility for binding of amino acids 1–5 are greatly reduced in Big ET-1 compared with ET-1 and that residues 16–21 are also affected as a result of the folding back of the C terminus of Big ET-1. In addition, Big ET-1 is resistant to proteolytic cleavage by enzymes that are able to metabolize the mature peptide (Peto et al., 1996). As a result, inhibition of the processing of Big ET-1 to ET-1 is an attractive target for lowering endogenous levels of the mature peptides through selective ECE inhibition.\n\n1. Endothelin-1 Synthesis within Endothelial Cells.\n\nET-1 is the most abundant isoform in the human cardiovascular system and the primary source is thought to be vascular endothelial cells, although the peptide is produced by other cell types, including epithelial cells, for example in the lungs, kidney, and colon; macrophages and monocytes, enteric glia cells in the periphery, as well as choroid plexus and certain neurons and reactive glial cells in the central nervous system. However, most of the information about ET-1 synthesis has been determined from studying endothelial cells that form a single layer of cells lining every blood vessel in the cardiovascular system that have a mass comparable with other endocrine glands. ET-1 has been detected in endothelial cells in all types of vessel, from large conduit arteries, resistance arteries (contributing to the maintenance of blood pressure), large veins, and venules. ET-1 is likely to be present and have a role in controlling perfusion in every organ in the body.\n\nET-1 is synthesized and released continuously from endothelial cells, and levels of pre-proendothelin (preproET-1) are modulated predominantly at the level of transcription, with evidence implicating numerous transcription including, activator proton 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor kappa B, FOXO1, VezF1, HIF-1, and GATA2. Both physical and chemical stimuli contribute to alterations in levels of preproET-1 mRNA in physiologic and pathophysiological conditions [e.g., shear stress, hypoxia, thrombin, and vasoactive factors such as angiotensin II (ANGII)] (for a detailed review of ET-1 gene regulation, see Stow et al., 2011). In the vasculature, shear stress is critical in determining the balance between ET-1 and NO production, and, at least in mice in vivo, shear stress alteration in endothelial gene expression appears to involve AMP-activated protein kinase stimulation of the anti-inflammatory transcription factor Krüppel-like factor 2 (Young et al., 2009). Hypoxia, for example in tumors, also has an important role in increasing expression of endothelial genes including ET-1 that possess hypoxic responsive elements in their promotors, contributing to disease progression (Spinella et al., 2014). One of the most important regulators of ET-1 production in endothelial cells is transforming growth factor (TGF) β. It has been demonstrated in bovine aortic endothelial cells in culture that TGFβ signaling via the ALK5/Smad 3 pathway results in an increase in preproET-1 via an AP-1 site and/or smad binding element (Castañares et al., 2007), resulting in a mature cell phenotype.\n\n2. ECE-1 Synthetic Pathway.\n\nET-1 is synthesized in a three-step process ( and ). The ET-1 gene encodes a 212-amino acid precursor, preproET-1. Removal of the 17-amino acid signal by a signal peptidase generates proET-1, which in turn is cleaved at both the C and N terminals by furin enzymes, which remove 35 and 122 amino acids, respectively, to yield Big ET-1 (Xu et al., 1994; Turner and Murphy, 1996). PC7 has also been proposed as a second convertase (Blais et al., 2002); however, deleting furin in endothelial cells substantially reduced generation of ET-1 (Kim et al., 2012). Furins activate a wide range of proteins by cleaving basic amino pairs of Arg and Lys, and this stage is not tractable to selective inhibition of the ET pathway.\n\nIn contrast, the final conversion is affected by an unusual but selective hydrolysis of Trp21-Val22 by activity of ECE-1. ECE-1 belongs to the type II membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease family and exhibits maximal activity at pH 7.0 for the cleavage of Big ET-1. ECE-1 comprises a short cytoplasmic N-terminal tail, a membrane-spanning region, and a large extracellular domain containing a zinc-binding motif essential for enzymatic activity. Four isoforms, ECE-1a–d (Schweizer et al., 1997; Valdenaire et al., 1999), derived from a single gene by differential splicing of mRNA transcripts, have been identified in humans. The enzymes differ only in the amino acid sequence of the extreme N terminal and show comparable efficiency of conversion of Big ET-1 (Jeng et al., 2002). They do differ in their subcellular localization, although the relative levels of the isoform mRNA species vary between human tissues: ECE-1c mRNA is generally the predominant isoform. ECE-1a and ECE-1c were localized at the cell surface; ECE-1b was intracellular and showed significant colocalization with a marker protein for the trans-Golgi network (Schweizer et al., 1997). The fourth isoform (ECE-1d) was also identified, with converting activity comparable with that of the other three isoenzymes. In contrast to ECE-1b, ECE-1d is expressed at the cell surface, although less strongly than ECE-1a (Valdenaire et al., 1999).\n\nECE-1 is widely expressed in human tissues (Rossi et al., 1995; Davenport et al., 1998; Davenport and Kuc, 2000) and intriguingly is upregulated in a number of cancers (Smollich et al., 2007; Whyteside et al., 2014). Term embryos of ECE-1 knockout (KO) mice (ECE-1−/−) (section V.B.1) exhibited similar craniofacial and cardiac abnormalities to those seen in ET-1- and ETA-deficient embryos. Unexpectedly, in view of the lowered efficiency of ECE-1 in generating ET-3 from Big ET-3, epidermal melanocytes and enteric neurons of the distal gut were also absent in these animals, similar to the developmental phenotype seen in ET-3−/− and ETB KO mice (Yanagisawa et al., 1998b).\n\nET-1 is unusual for vasoactive peptides in being synthesized by a dual pathway ( ). ECE-1 has been visualized in small secretory vesicles of the constitutive pathway, from where ET-1 is thought to be continuously released to maintain normal vascular tone (Haynes and Webb, 1994). ET-1 has also been localized together with ECE-1 and ECE-2 in specialized Weibel-Palade storage granules that are unique to endothelial cells and that are an integral component of the regulated pathway. These structures degranulate after external physiologic or pathophysiological stimulus (chemical or mechanical), releasing ET-1 to produce further vasoconstriction (Russell et al., 1998; Russell and Davenport, 1999a). Big ET-1 that has escaped conversion to ET-1 within endothelial cells can be detected in the plasma. ECE-1 has also been localized to smooth muscle cells in human blood vessels and converts Big ET-1 in vitro and is upregulated in atherosclerosis (Maguire et al., 1997; Maguire and Davenport, 1998). Given the larger volume of the smooth muscle compared with the single layer of endothelium, smooth muscle ECE may be a more important source of ET-1 in pathophysiological conditions. Plasma levels of ET-1 are typically ∼5 pmol/l, suggestive of a locally released rather than a circulating peptide (Davenport et al., 1990). In comparison Big ET-1 is detected at ∼1 pmol/l in plasma (Suzuki et al., 1991).\n\n3. ECE-2 Synthetic Pathway.\n\nECE-2 also belongs to the type II membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease family and shares 59% sequence similarity to ECE-1 (Emoto and Yanagisawa, 1995; Yanagisawa et al., 2000; Lorenzo et al., 2001). In common with ECE-1, there are also four ECE-2 isoforms possessing a conserved catalytic unit and differing only in their N terminal. The isoforms differ in their localization, and this may be the reason for the variation in the N terminal; ECE-2b was found to be highly expressed in neuroendocrine tissues (brain, pituitary, and adrenal medulla), whereas the other isoforms were in peripheral tissues (Ikeda et al., 2002). In contrast to ECE-1, the optimum pH for ECE-2 activity is acidic (pH 5.5), which would favor an intracellular localization and a potential role under low pH conditions, for example in ischemia. This difference provides an experimental method for distinguishing between the activities of the two enzymes. In agreement, ECE-2 was found to be localized to the acidified environment of vesicles of the secretory pathway in human endothelial cells but was not detected in Weibel-Palade storage granules ( ; Russell and Davenport, 1999b).\n\nAlthough ECE-2 efficiently converts Big ET-1, it is important to emphasize that the enzyme is able to process other biologically active peptides. In a study testing ECE-2 for activity against 42 peptides, 10 were processed including conversion of ANGI to ANG1–7 (a vasodilator) and the inactivation of bradykinin. Selective pharmacological inhibition of ECE-2 activity may therefore be difficult to interpret because other vasoactive pathways could be altered in addition to ET-1 (Mzhavia et al., 2003). ECEs have also been reported to beneficially degrade intracellular beta-amyloid produced within the endosomal/lysosomal pathway and autophagosomes (Pacheco-Quinto and Eckman, 2013). Intriguingly, knocking out the ECE-2 gene in mice (section V.B.1) was without any alteration of the phenotype: mice show normal development, life span, and fertility (Yanagisawa et al., 2000). However, a combined double KO, ECE-1(−/−)/ECE-2(−/−) resulted in more severe or additional abnormalities than those in the ECE-1 single knockout embryos, suggesting a significant developmental role for ECE-2. Importantly, whereas levels of ET-1 were reduced, ET-1 was still detectable in the double KO animals, emphasizing the potential for contribution from other pathways to ET-1 synthesis.\n\n4. Peptidic Converting Enzyme/Neutral Endopeptidase Inhibitors: Phosphoramidon.\n\nThere are two important aspects of its properties that need to be considered in interpreting the action of phosphoramidon on the endothelin synthetic pathway. Phosphoramidon is not selective for ECE-1, because it was originally developed to inhibit a related enzyme neutral endopeptidase/neprilysin (NEP), and it will also increase levels of vasodilators such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and inactivate other peptides, including the enkephalins and tachykinins. To confirm ECE activity in a particular cell or tissue preparation in vitro, the action of another NEP inhibitor, thiorphan, must be compared with that of phosphoramidon. Thiorphan does not inhibit ECE-1, and the formation of ET-1 in the presence of this compound is generally accepted as providing evidence of ECE activity. Although using two compounds increases complexity, both reagents have been used in experimental medicine studies to characterize Big ET-1 conversion in vivo (see for example, Plumpton et al., 1995; Webb, 1995; Hand et al., 1999) as well as in animal models. A second complication in interpreting pharmacological assays is that NEP also metabolizes ET-1 to inactive fragments via a two-stage process, opening of the Ser5-Leu6 bond followed by cleavage at the amino side of Ile19 (Skolovsky et al., 1990), and inhibition in tissues derived from kidney, where NEP is particularly abundant, may therefore cause an unanticipated rise in ET-1 (Turner and Tanzawa, 1997).\n\nFinally, phosphoramidon is a protein and does not cross the plasma membrane, therefore its use either in cell-based assays, in vitro or in vivo, will only report on extracellular ECE activity not intracellular ET-1 synthesis (Parnot et al., 1997). This is important because mature ET-1 can be detected together with ECE within Weibel-Palade bodies and secretory vesicles of endothelial cells and it is likely many inhibitors will not alter intracellular synthesis.\n\n5. Small Molecule, Selective Converting Enzyme-1 Inhibitor: PD159790.\n\nDespite the identification of ECE-1 as a rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis of ET-1, there has been much less development of selective small molecule inhibitors that could potentially reduce levels of ET-1 in pathophysiological conditions compared with the considerable effort to discover receptor antagonists. PD159790 was developed to be selective for ECE-1 compared with NEP (Ahn et al., 1998). The compound has been validated experimentally by altering the pH of endothelial cells in culture: at the optimum for ECE-1 activity, pH 6.9, PD159790 inhibited Big-ET-1 conversion but not at the optimum for ECE-2, pH 5.4 (Russell and Davenport, 1999a). In addition, the compound had no effect on the alternative pathway for ET-1 metabolism via chymase generation of ET-1(1-31) (Maguire et al., 2001).\n\n6. Small Molecule Converting Enzyme/Neutral Endopeptidase Inhibitors: Daglutril (SLV306) and SOL1.\n\nNo small molecule-selective ECE inhibitor has been tested in the clinic, but compounds have been developed to inhibit both ECE and NEP. Such compounds would be predicted to be antihypertensive by inhibiting the formation of the vasoconstrictor ET-1 as well as increasing vasodilators such as ANP that would normally be inactivated by NEP-mediated metabolism.\n\nThe ECE/NEP inhibitor SLV338 has been tested in a number of animal models characterized by elevated levels of ET and therefore potentially tractable to inhibition of ET synthesis, such as in ischemic areas of the brain after stroke. SLV338 was tested for 27 weeks in spontaneously hypertensive, stroke-prone rats. The compound significantly lowered the incidence of stroke and improved survival in a blood pressure-independent manner compared with untreated animals, suggesting a new target for primary stroke prevention (Wengenmayer et al., 2011). Sharkovska et al. (2011) showed that SLV338 was able to preserve kidney function and reduce mortality in a rat model of severe acute ischemic renal failure. In a chronic renal failure model using Nω -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME) to inhibit nitric oxide synthesis for 4 weeks, which increases levels of ET; SLV338 did not reduce blood pressure, but importantly abolished renal tissue damage (interstitial fibrosis, glomerulosclerosis, and renal arterial remodeling). In a rat model of experimental renovascular hypertension (2-kidney, 1-clip), SLV338 was equally effective as losartan at preventing cardiac remodeling (Kalk et al., 2011). These results are potentially important because there are currently few drugs for the treatment of chronic renal failure.\n\nDaglutril (SLV306) was the first in class, orally active, dual ECE/NEP inhibitor to enter clinical trials (Tabrizchi, 2003; Dickstein et al., 2004; Parvanova et al., 2013), where it was reported to be well tolerated without the disadvantages of side effects of edema and liver toxicity observed with some ET receptor antagonists. SLV306 is a prodrug, hydrolyzed to an active metabolite, KC-12615. In proof of principle studies in volunteers, oral SLV306 significantly increased endogenous plasma ANP concentrations, while reducing the rise in blood pressure after infusion of Big ET-1 (Seed et al., 2012). Initial studies in animal models of diabetes showed that SLV306 was comparable to captopril, an ACE inhibitor, in reducing proteinuria and preventing nephrosclerosis (Thöne-Reinke et al., 2004). In this model, changes in the ET system in the kidney are thought to mediate renal damage by cell proliferation and interstitial inflammation. A limitation of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system for treating hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes is that they become less effective as the condition advances. SLV306 was as effective as captopril in decreasing renal interstitial matrix content as well as protein and albumin excretion (Thöne-Reinke et al., 2004) and could have an additional benefit in targeting the ET pathway to improve renal function. However, in a small randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy, Daglutril on top of losartan did not alter albuminuria that had been predicted from animal studies or renal hemodynamics (Parvanova et al., 2013). This may have been the result of the comparatively short duration of the trial (8 weeks). Importantly, ambulatory blood pressure was reduced, particularly at night when there is a greater risk associated with high blood pressure in this patient group. There was the expected corresponding significant rise in levels of plasma Big ET-1, suggesting inhibition of ECE, but there was no change in proANP that would have been expected as a consequence of NEP inhibition. SLV306 has also been evaluated in a small study of patients with congestive heart failure who underwent right-sided heart catheterization. The results are difficult to interpret because, although pulmonary pressure and right atrial pressure decreased significantly with a maximum effect observed between 6 and 8 hours, there was no clear concentration response relationship between the three doses tested (Dickstein et al., 2004).\n\nSOL1 has been described as a dual ECE/NEP nonpeptide inhibitor, although it is less effective at inhibiting ECE-1 compared with NEP at neutral pH in vitro. However, the compound was effective in inhibiting the Big-ET-1-induced rise in blood pressure in DOCA salt hypertensive rats (10 μmol⋅kg−1) (Nelissen et al., 2012) and chronic treatment reduced macrophage infiltration (Lemkens et al., 2012a). SOL1 normalized impaired endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor responses in spontaneously hypertensive rats, although there was no effect on blood pressure (Lemkens et al., 2012b).\n\n7. Chymase—A Pathophysiological Synthetic Pathway?\n\nA surprising finding in the double ECE-1/ECE-2 KO mice was the presence of mature ET peptides, suggesting other proteases could synthesize ETs (Yanagisawa et al., 2000). Chymase is a serine protease associated with inflammatory responses, including those in the vasculature, and has been implicated in a range of cardiovascular diseases, particularly after release from mast cells. The enzyme is an alternative synthetic pathway for angiotensin II as well as ET-1. Chymase converts Big ET-1 to an intermediate ET-1(1–31), by cleaving the Tyr31–Gly 32 bond, which in turn is converted to the mature peptide by NEP (Fecteau et al., 2005; D'Orleans-Juste et al., 2008). Pharmacologically ET-1(1–31) has no selectivity between ETA and ETB receptors in human heart, and vasoconstriction was fully blocked by an ETA-selective antagonist, reflecting the predominance of the ETA receptor on vascular smooth muscle (Maguire et al., 2001; Maguire and Davenport, 2004).\n\nIn ligand binding assays in human heart, ET-1(1–31) had a similar affinity for both receptor subtypes, but this affinity was approximately 100 times lower than for ET-1. In functional assays in human arteries, ET-1(1–31) caused vasoconstriction (although again less effective than ET-1 itself) that was blocked by an ETA antagonist. This action was unaffected by the ECE inhibitors PD159790 or phosphoramidon, although the appearance of the mature peptide, ET-1, was detected in the bathing medium (Maguire et al., 2001) and may therefore contribute to some of the observed functional response to ET-1(1-31). Interestingly, involvement of chymase activity in conversion of Big ET-1 was confirmed in rat aorta (artery) but not vena cava (vein) (Watts et al., 2007).\n\nHow important is the chymase pathway compared with ECE? The results from in vitro pharmacology experiments using human vessels, including coronary arteries, clearly demonstrated the potential for vasoconstriction for the putative chymase product (Maguire et al., 2001). In contrast to humans that have only one chymase, mice express several isoforms, so results are more difficult to interpret in this species. However, mouse mast cell protease 4 is thought to be most similar in activity to human chymase. Levels of ET-1 were reduced by 40% in mouse mast cell protease 4 KOs (Houde et al., 2013), and pressor responses to Big ET-1, but not to ET-1, were reduced (Semaan et al., 2015). Studies on isolated arteries from the kidneys of diabetic mice showed that Big ET-1 vasoconstriction produced by the chymase-dependent pathway measured by chymase inhibition was significantly greater in diabetic compared with control kidneys. It was speculated that this pathway might therefore contribute to end-stage renal disease (Harrison-Bernard et al., 2013).\n\nA potential source of chymase is degranulation of mast cells that may occur under pathophysiological conditions, and a working hypothesis is that this would provide an alternative pathway for ET-1 synthesis in disease. However, paradoxically, injection of ET-1 was found to be toxic to mast cell-deficient mice, suggesting that mast cell degranulation releases proteases that metabolize ET-1 to reduce endogenous ET-1 levels and pathophysiology in vivo (Maurer et al., 2004).\n\nET-1(1–31) levels were increased to several times higher concentrations, and for longer, than ET-1 in the plasma of patients with acute myocardial infarction (Oka et al., 2014). In contrast, although Big ET-1 levels were elevated in patients with chronic heart failure compared with controls, there was no change in ET-1(1–31) (Leslie et al., 2004). There are currently insufficient data to determine whether changes in ET-1(1–31) are associated with clinical and experimental pathophysiological conditions.\n\n8. Is Dual Vasopeptidase Inhibition a Pharmacologically Flawed Concept?\n\nAlthough volunteer and clinical studies with SLV306 have provided, to a certain extent, proof of mechanism of action, the results have been disappointing in proving efficacy of ECE/NEP inhibition in heart failure and diabetes. It is possible that inhibition of ECE may switch Big ET-1 conversion to an alternative pathway such as chymase, particularly in disease. In animal models with normal renal function this does not appear to be the case. In a positron emission tomography study, [18F]-Big ET rapidly accumulated unchanged in the kidney and there was little evidence of conversion by an alternative pathway (Johnström et al., 2010). The study by Parvanova et al. (2013) was well designed and powered but failed to meet the primary criteria of reducing albuminuria despite promising data from animal studies. The authors speculated that although the reduction in ET produced beneficial effects, the increase in ANP could have increased preglomerular vasodilatation, thus maintaining glomerular perfusion and filtration despite lowered blood pressure. Although the efficacy of a specific inhibitor of ECE-1 has not been tested in the clinic, the clinical evidence is against dual inhibition of ECE/NEP as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit the ET pathway.\n\nB. Endothelin-2 and Big Endothelin-2\n\n1. Synthesis of Endothelin-2.\n\nIn humans and other mammals including monkeys, cats, dogs, and cattle, ET-2 differs from ET-1 by two amino acids, Trp6 and Leu7. Synthesis of ET-2 is thought to be essentially similar to that of ET-1 ( ). Preproendothelin-2 is formed after transcription of the EDN2 gene. After removal of the signal sequence, proendothelin is cleaved by furin, to Big ET-2, a 38-amino acid peptide. Interestingly, ECE-1 and ECE-2 were about 10% less efficient in vitro in converting Big ET-2 to mature peptide compared with conversion of Big ET-1, despite sharing the same scissile bond (Trp21-Val22) (Emoto and Yanagisawa, 1995). The ET-2 synthetic pathway has been studied in detail in human renal adenocarcinoma cells because these produce high levels of ET-2. Synthesis was inhibited by phosphoramidon and ECE confirmed by sequencing (Yorimitsu et al., 1992, 1995; Shinmi et al., 1993).\n\nIn vivo, Gardiner et al. (1992a) showed that Big ET-2 was converted to produce cardiovascular actions (dose-dependent pressor effect, bradycardia, renal and mesenteric vasoconstriction), similar to Big ET-1. All these responses were blocked by phosphoramidon, but the ECE/NEP inhibitor had no effect on the actions of the mature peptide. Similar results were obtained in the anesthetized, ganglion-blocked rat, where intravenous bolus doses of Big ET-2 were compared with Big ET-1 where the cardiovascular actions of both peptides were prevented, as expected, by phosphoramidon but not thiorphan (Mattera et al., 1993).\n\n2. Expression.\n\nThe cellular and organ distribution of ET-2 has not been as extensively studied as ET-1, but a pattern is emerging of a more restricted organ distribution. Big ET-2 was detected at higher levels in human plasma than Big ET-1 (Matsumoto et al., 1994), although the concentration of ET-2 (∼0.9 pmol/l) is a one-fifth of that of ET-1 (Davenport and Maguire, 2006). Big ET-2 concentration was ∼2 pmol/l of plasma (Suzuki et al., 1991). The most likely source in the plasma is overspill from endothelial cells: both ET-2 mRNA and Big ET-2 have been detected (Howard et al., 1992; O'Reilly et al., 1993a,b). ET-2 mRNA and/or peptide have been detected in a number of human tissues: vasculature, heart, lung, kidney, intestine, and ovaries (Howard et al., 1992; Marciniak et al., 1992; Plumpton et al., 1993; Karet and Davenport, 1996; Palanisamy et al., 2006). Similarly, in the rat, although all 16 organs examined had measurable mRNA for ET-1, ET-2 mRNA was restricted to heart, lung, ovary, stomach, and intestine (Uchide et al., 1999, 2000). High levels were expressed by regions of the intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon, and rectum) as well as the ovary, but not testes (De La Monte et al., 1995; Takizawa et al., 2005). Pituitary glands and medulla oblongata had higher ET-2 mRNA levels than ET-1 (Masuo et al., 2003), suggesting a possible role in these tissues that requires further exploration, although most brain regions had lower or undetectable levels of ET-2 (cerebellum and cerebrum). An alternative strategy using a transgenic mouse line that expresses codon-improved Cre recombinase (iCre) under regulation of the endothelin-2 gene (edn2) to map ET-2 expression showed expected expression from previous studies in ovary, stomach, and intestine with a punctate expression in the corneal epithelium, liver, lung, pituitary, uterus, and heart. Interestingly, in the mouse embryo, expression was localized in developing hair follicles and the dermis (Cacioppo et al., 2015).\n\nThe tertiary structure of ET-2 was found to be essentially the same as ET-1 by NMR and any differences in pharmacology would be attributable to changes in the characteristics of the two side-chains of Trp6 and Leu7 (Arvidsson et al., 1998). However, in humans and other mammalian preparations both peptides are equipotent. Studies comparing radiolabeled [125I]-ET-2 with [125I]-ET-1 binding in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells that express ETA receptors found identical affinity constants (KD = 0.1 nM) and similar maximum receptor density values (46 and 54 fmol per million cells, respectively). Both ligands had the same association rate constants of 0.01 minute−1 and similar slow dissociation rates (Roubert et al., 1991), although Devesly et al. (1990) reported ET-2 dissociated more rapidly at 37°C than ET-1 in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts that also express ETA. In human smooth muscle from aorta and coronary artery that express mainly ETA receptors, saturation binding assays were monophasic, Hill slopes close to unity, and KD values were 0.7 nM for [125I]-ET-2 and 0.4 nM for [125I]-ET-1 (Bacon and Davenport, 1996). Antagonists such as {\"type\":\"entrez-nucleotide\",\"attrs\":{\"text\":\"FR139317\",\"term_id\":\"258103156\",\"term_text\":\"FR139317\"}}FR139317 were equally effective at competing for [125I]-ET-2 as for [125I]-ET-1 binding. In agreement, in functional assays, ET-2 had a similar potency as a vasoconstrictor to ET-1 in all human isolated vessels tested (saphenous vein, aorta, coronary, internal mammary artery, and pulmonary arteries (Maguire and Davenport, 1995). ET-2 was also found to be equipotent with ET-1 in animal preparations, for example, rat portal vein (Guimaraes et al., 1992).\n\n3. Vasoactive Intestinal Contractor and Big Vasoactive Intestinal Contractor.\n\nIn rodents, ET-2 differs from ET-1 by three amino acids ( ; Asn4, Trp6, and Leu7) (Bloch et al., 1991) and is also called vasoactive intestinal contractor (VIC) because it was originally identified by its ability to contract isolated mouse ileum (Ishida et al., 1989). The synthetic pathway is the same as ET-2: preproVIC, a 175 amino acid precursor protein, via a 38-amino acid Big VIC, which in turn is cleaved to VIC and a C-terminal fragment, which is sensitive to phosphoramidon inhibition (Saida et al., 1989, 2000, 2002; Yorimitsu et al., 1992).\n\nThese amino acid substitutions have no effect on the pharmacology of VIC, with the peptide having the same affinity for both receptor subtypes. [125I]-VIC had a similar autoradiographical distribution in human, porcine, and rat tissues compared with [125I]-ET-1 and [125I]-ET-2 (Davenport and Morton, 1991; Davenport et al., 1991). No differences were found in the ability of unlabeled VIC, ET-1, ET-2, or ET-3 to compete for [125I]-VIC in ligand binding assays or in vasoconstrictor responses in the guinea pig longitudinal smooth muscle (Yoshinaga et al., 1992). In other ETB (Cozza et el., 1992; Lin and Lee, 1992) or predominantly ETA preparations, VIC was equipotent with ET-1 and ET-2 (Douglas and Hiley, 1990; Schoeffter and Randriantsoa, 1993). VIC had a lower potency than ET-1 in cultured human smooth muscle cells (Iwashima et al., 1997).\n\n4. Distinct Physiologic/Pathophysiological Role for Endothelin-2.\n\nAlthough the pharmacology of ET-2 is similar to ET-1 and both peptides may be released from the same cells, such as the endothelium, and exist in the same tissue compartments, there is increasing evidence that ET-2 does not simply duplicate ET-1 but has a distinct physiologic and potentially pathophysiological role. This difference may be achieved by a change in levels of gene expression and through differences in synthesis.\n\nDeletion of the ET-2 gene in mice produces a different phenotype to that affected by disrupting the ETA/ET-1 or the ETB/ET-3 pathways. The ET-2 phenotype was characterized by severe growth retardation, hypoglycemia, ketonemia, and increased levels of starvation-induced genes as well as severe hypothermia, but surprisingly intestinal function was normal (Chang et al., 2013; section V.A.3). After selective deletion of the ET-2 gene in epithelial cells, mice showed no abnormalities in growth and survival, but major changes were observed in lung morphology leading to increased levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and a deficiency of oxygen (hypoxemia) in the blood. It is not yet clear whether this phenotype is a consequence of internal starvation as a consequence of reduction in ET-2 expression or whether ET-2 may have a critical function in the pulmonary system. ET-2 mRNA localized to epithelial cells, whereas receptor mRNA was mainly present in mesenchyme, suggesting a paracrine function for ET-2 (Chang et al., 2013). PAH remains the major clinical indication for ET antagonists (Liu et al., 2013), where the importance of dysregulation of vascular cell growth is increasingly recognized. Selective deletion of ET-2 may provide new clues to the progression of this disease and the role of ET-2 in PAH warrants further investigation.\n\nEvidence is emerging that ET-2 plays a key role in ovarian physiology, with ET-2-mediated contraction proposed as a final signal facilitating ovulation (Meidan and Levy 2007; Ko et al., 2012; Ling et al., 2013). ET-2 expression is higher than ET-1 in ovaries (Uchide et al., 1999). ECE-1 and ET-2 were found to be transiently expressed in rat ovaries during ovulation (Ko et al., 2006), and in mice, induced superovulation resulted in a surge of ET-2 mRNA expression after 11 hours that coincided with the time of follicular rupture and then subsequently declined (Palanisamy et al., 2006). The precise mechanism of rupture and ovulation are undetermined, but ET-2 caused contraction of the smooth muscle layer surrounding each follicle (Ko et al., 2006). In support, tezosentan (a mixed ETA/ETB receptor antagonist), reduced ovulation and resulted in mature unruptured follicles despite gonadotropin superovulation. Although differences are reported between species in the action of ET-2 in ovarian physiology (see Ling et al., 2013), overall the results suggest ET-2 has both a spatial and temporal role in mediating follicular rupture, without which normal ovulation cannot proceed. Further studies on ET-2 signaling pathways in ovulation are needed and may lead to the identification of new drug targets for associated with infertility such as Luteinized Unruptured Follicle Syndrome.\n\nET-2 also has a distinct chemokine role, functioning as a chemoattractant for neutrophils at low levels, although inhibition of migration occurs at high concentrations (Elferink and de Koster, 1996). The peptide was also found to be as effective as the inflammatory chemokine CCL2 in stimulating chemotaxis in macrophages, mediated via ETB receptors through the MAPK pathway (Yen et al., 1997; Grimshaw et al., 2002b). ET-1 has been shown to affect many stages of cancer development, including proliferation, angiogenesis, migration, invasion, and apoptosis (Grant et al., 2003; Bhalla et al., 2009), but there is increasing evidence for a role for ET-2. The peptide has been isolated from renal adenocarcinoma cell lines (Ohkubo et al., 1990). ET-2 is absent from breast tissue, but under hypoxic conditions, cultured cells from HTH-K mice human breast tumor cell lines show enhanced expression of ET-2, ETA, and ETB but not ET-1 and ET-3 (Grimshaw et al., 2002a,b). ET-2 may be the principle isoform increased in hypoxic tumors with increased ET-2 in cancers such as those found in the skin, where expression is three times higher in basal cell carcinoma compared with normal skin (Tanese et al., 2010). Further studies are required to determine whether the ET-2 pathway is a potential target in cancer therapy (Grimshaw et al., 2004).\n\nC. Endothelin-3, the Receptor Subtype Selective Isoform and Big Endothelin-3\n\nET-3 is the only endogenous isoform that, at physiologic concentrations, can distinguish between the two receptor subtypes, because it has the same affinity at ETB receptors as ET-1 and ET-2 but has much lower or little affinity for ETA than the other isoforms ( ). It was an early discovery in the field by Matsumoto et al. (1989) that ET-3 was the most abundant ET peptide in rat brain, mainly localized to neurons and glia of the neostriatum, hypothalamic nuclei, hippocampus, and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and medulla oblongata (Giaid et al., 1991). This led to the proposal that ET-3 was the \"brain\" endothelin peptide, particularly because the ETB subtype comprises ∼90% of the ET receptors in human normal cerebral cortex (Harland et al., 1995) (section III.C).\n\nKO mice also emphasize the importance of the ET-3/ETB pathway in the development of the enteric nervous system (Kurihara et al., 1999), a complex network of neurons and glia in the gut controlling intestinal motility, secretion, and blood flow. A mutation in ETB is a common cause of Hirschsprung disease (section V.B.3), in which enteric nervous system precursors and neural crest-derived epidermal melanoblasts fail to colonize the intestine and skin.\n\n1. Endothelin-3 Synthesis and Kell.\n\nControversy remains concerning the precise contribution of ECE-1 to ET-3 synthesis. ECE-1-deficient mice recapitulated the combined phenotype of both ET-1/ETA- and ET-3/ETB-deficient mice. Tissue ET-3 levels were lower than in wild-type animals, suggesting that ECE-1 was an important converting enzyme for both Big ET-1 and Big ET-3 in vivo, at least in mice (Yanagisawa et al., 2000). However, Big ET-3 has been reported to be poorly converted by ECE-1 when tested as the purified enzyme or in isolated tissue preparations (D'Orléans-Juste et al., 1991; Telemaque and D'Orléans-Juste, 1991; Shimada et al., 1994; Turner and Murphy, 1996), owing to differences in the scissile bond Trp21-Ile21 in Big-ET-3 compared with Trp21-Val21 in Big ET-1 and in the C-terminal sequence. However, Big ET-3 in vivo produces vasoconstriction, for example, in the chronically instrumented rat (called proendothelin-3 by Gardiner et al., 1992a,b), suggesting the existence of further converting enzymes. The Kell blood group comprises 20 different antigens borne by the protein Kell, a 93-kDa membrane bound glycoprotein expressed by erythrocytes with homology to the type II membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease family that includes ECE-1 and ECE-2 (Clapéron et al., 2005). A recombinant, nonphysiologic form of Kell has been shown to efficiently cleave Big ET-3, suggesting the existence of a specific converting enzyme for the synthesis of ET-3 (Lee et al., 1999).\n\nClapéron et al. (2005) expressed the Kell K2 antigen under more representative physiologic conditions in erythroid and nonerythroid cells lines. Kell K2 efficiently cleaved Big ET-1 as well as Big ET-3 (Big ET-2 was not tested), but unlike ECE-1, the enzyme was inhibited efficiently by thiorphan as well as phosphoramidon. It was not selective for ET synthesis because it also cleaved tachykinins. The relative contributions of Kell versus ECE-1/ECE-2 to the synthesis of mature peptides remain unclear but may explain the disappointing results of targeting the latter (see section V.B.1), and further studies are required to comprehensively delineate the synthetic pathways contributing to the production of the mature endothelin peptides.\n\n2. Expression.\n\nET-3 (typically ∼0.3 pmol/l) and an order of magnitude higher level of Big ET-3 (∼6 pmol/l) are detectable in human plasma (Matsumoto et al., 1994). Changes associated with disease have not been extensively investigated, but concentrations of Big ET-3 increased significantly in hemodialysis patients (together with Big ET-1 and Big ET-2) but with only a moderate rise in corresponding active peptides (Miyauchi et al., 2012). Human endothelial cells do not synthesize ET-3, but one possible source of circulating Big ET-3 could be the adrenal gland, where this peptide has been visualized in secretory cells of the medulla using selective antisera, although mature ET-3 could not be detected (Davenport et al., 1996). If released, further processing of Big ET-3 could occur within the vasculature by smooth muscle cell ECE (Davenport et al., 1998). ET-3 has been detected in other tissues, including heart (Plumpton et al., 1993), endometrium (O'Reilly et al., 1992; Cameron et al., 1993) using HPLC fractionation combined with radioimmunoassay, brain, and pituitary using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay—interestingly the pituitary was stated (but not shown) to have higher levels of ET-3 than ET-1 (Takahashi et al., 1991). In other species, high concentrations of immunoreactive ET-3 were found in the intestine, lung, pituitary gland, and brain (greater than 100 pg/g wet tissue) in rats; in agreement with humans, only pituitary gland expressed higher levels than ET-1 (Matsumoto et al., 1989). Northern analysis showed that preproET-3 mRNA was expressed in the eye, submandibular gland, brain, kidney, jejunum, stomach, and spleen (Shiba et al., 1992). Big ET-3 was also localized by immunocytochemistry (with Big ET-1 and Big ET-2) to mast cells and macrophages in the rat gastrointestinal tract (Liu et al., 1998). Because ET-3 does not activate ETA receptors at physiologic concentrations, the expression should correlate with higher densities of ETB receptor—and this is true to a certain extent for the brain and pituitary (compare in ).\n\nD. Snake Venom Peptides, the Sarafotoxins\n\nThe sarafotoxins are a family of four isoforms (S6a, S6b, S6c, S6d; ) with a high degree of sequence similarity to ET-1, identified from the venom of the snake Atractaspis engaddensis (Kloog et al., 1988; Takasaki et al., 1988). The main differences are in residues 5, 6, 7, and 17, which are Asp, Met, Thr, and Gln. The venoms evolved to immobilize mammalian prey and can be fatal in humans. Symptoms are a rapid rise in blood pressure consistent with systemic vasoconstriction, as observed with ET-1 and changes in electrocardiogram consistent with coronary vasoconstriction or direct inotropic actions on the heart accompanied by changes in the electrocardiogram associated with atrioventricular block and cardiac arrest (Kurnik et al., 1999). The most widely studied are S6b and S6c. Sarafotoxin 6b has similar affinities for both endothelin receptors with a profile similar to ET-1/ET-2, although less potent, whereas S6c is used as a moderately selective ETB agonist (Maguire et al., 1994, 1996; Maguire and Davenport, 1999). A fifth isoform, bibrotoxin, was isolated from the venom of the burrowing asp Atractaspis bibroni with an amino acid sequence similar to S6b but with the substitution of Ala4 instead of Lys4 and similar pharmacology (Becker et al., 1993).\n\nIII. Receptor Structure, Distribution, and Function\n\nETs activate two receptor subtypes (Davenport, 2002), ETA (Arai et al., 1990) and ETB (Sakurai et al., 1990), that belong to Class 1 (Family A or rhodopsin-like) of the G protein-coupled, 7 transmembrane-spanning domains receptors (GPCR). Although ET receptor-like genes are found outside the vertebrates in the cephalochordate amphioxus, suggesting a long lineage in eukaryote evolution, genes encoding peptides are only present among vertebrates: jawless vertebrates (lampreys and hagfishes), cartilaginous vertebrates (sharks, rays, and chimaeras), and bony vertebrates (ray-finned fishes and lobe-finned vertebrates including tetrapods). It is therefore likely that the receptor-ligand signaling pathway is a vertebrate innovation consistent with the role of the development and regulation of the cardiovascular system (Braasch and Schartl, 2014).\n\nThe sequencing of the human genome is virtually complete and most if not all genes encoding GPCRs have been identified (Foord et al., 2005; Davenport et al., 2013). The receptors most closely related in structure to ETA and ETB are GPR37 (endothelin receptor type B-like or Parkin-associated endothelin receptor-like receptor) and GPR37L1. Neither of these receptors was activated by any of approximately 20 ET peptides, Big ET precursors, or known ET receptor ligands (such as BQ123 and BQ3020) that were tested at high concentration. Two other peptides, prosaptide and prosaposin, have been identified as cognate ligands for GPR37 and GPR37L1 (Meyer et al., 2013). In addition, none of the ET ligands had any activity against the remaining ∼80 GPCRs in the screen that are currently classified as orphans, because their endogenous ligand is not yet known.\n\nStudies continue to be published suggesting the existence of further ET receptor subtypes: for example, ETB isoforms were proposed with ETB1 present on endothelial cells and ETB2 on smooth muscle cells, but the evidence is against this. In competition binding assays, ETB receptors expressed by human isolated endothelial compared with smooth muscle cells in culture could not be distinguished by a range of ET ligands (Flynn et al., 1998). Radiolabeled ETB ligands were always found to bind with a single affinity and Hill slopes close unity in saturation binding assays (Molenaar et al., 1992, 1993; Nambi et al., 1994) and to produce monophasic curves in competition binding assays versus [125I]-ET-1 in human native (Peter and Davenport 1995a,b; Russell and Davenport, 1996) or recombinant ETB receptors (Nambi et al., 1994; Reynolds et al., 1995). In global ETB receptor knockout mice both the direct constrictor (smooth muscle) and indirect vasodilator (endothelium) responses to the ETB agonist sarafotoxin 6c were abolished (Mizuguchi et al., 1997). Current evidence only supports the existence of two subtypes, ETA and ETB, according to NC-IUPHAR nomenclature (Davenport, 2002). No further Family A GPCRs have been identified that might bind ET peptides.\n\nA. Endothelin A Receptors\n\n1. Structure.\n\nThe human ETA receptor has 63% sequence similarity with the human ETB receptor over a 420-residue match length. The amino acid sequences of human ETA differ from other species, for example by 9% from rat ETA and by 12% for the ETB. The ETA gene spans more than 40 kilobases and contains eight exons and seven introns. It is located on chromosome 4 and encodes a 427-amino acid protein (Hosoda et al., 1992). The amino acid sequence of the human ETA receptor is shown in . The receptor sequence displays a high degree of conservation between human and animal species, including pig, dog, sheep (95%), rat (93%), and mouse (92%). The main differences are in the N terminus, rather than within the transmembrane domains that contribute to binding, and reflect that ET-1 structure is conserved across mammalian species. shows the amino acids that have been mutated and reported to alter the binding of ET ligands. The choice of amino acids to mutate is determined usually by modeling the three-dimensional structure and identifying amino acids that are likely to have groups associated with the binding of ligand to the receptor. For example, an extensive study mutating 18 amino acids identified that Gly97, Lysl40, Lys159, Gln165, and Phe315, located in transmembrane regions 1, 2, 3, 3, and 6, respectively, reduced binding of radiolabeled ET-1. Interestingly mutation of Tyr263, Arg326, and Asp351 preserved ET-1 binding but reduced that of the antagonist bosentan. All of these three residues are conserved in the ETB subtype, consistent with bosentan displaying little selectivity for either ETA versus ETB.\n\nPosttranslational modifications, phosphorylation, palmitoylation, and glycosylation can further modulate the function of GPCRs ( ). Mutation of a cluster of five Cys residues present in the cytoplasmic tail did not alter binding but prevented palmitoylation of the receptor, resulting in a failure of ET-1 to stimulate the transient increase in the cytoplasmic calcium. Posttranslational modification by palmitoylation would seem to be essential for functional activity of ETA (Horstmeyer et al., 1996). Truncation of the entire N terminus that included a possible glycosylation site abolished binding activity, but it is unclear whether this is the result of a structural change or whether glycosylation is important (Hashido et al., 1992). Phosphorylation is crucial for ligand induced desensitization in ETB receptors, with rapid deactivation after ET-1 stimulation and most activity lost within 5 minutes. In contrast, ETA did not undergo ligand-induced phosphorylation and continued to signal with little reduction in activity after 5 minutes, consistent with long-lasting constrictor activity (Cramer et al., 1997).\n\n2. Receptors Mutations.\n\nETA receptor knockout mice bear morphologic abnormalities nearly identical to ET-1 and ECE-1 knockout mice. Homozygous mice died at birth of respiratory failure secondary to severe craniofacial abnormalities (Hosoda et al., 1994; section V.B.2). ETA receptors are essential for development, and mutations will be lethal or detrimental. Deletions in the ETA receptor in mice mimic the human conditions collectively termed CATCH 22 or velocardiofacial syndrome. These include severe craniofacial deformities and defects in the cardiovascular outflow tract. Great vessel malformations highly similar to those seen in neural crest-ablated chick embryos and human congenital cardiac defect also occur.\n\n3. Splice Variants.\n\nAt least three alternatively spliced ETA receptor transcripts have been reported in human tissues, including aorta, heart atria, and lung. Deletions of exon 3 (producing a protein with two membrane-spanning domains), exon 4 (producing a protein with three membrane-spanning domains), and exon 3 plus exon 4 (producing a protein lacking the third and fourth domain) have been identified, but these did not bind ET-1 when expressed in cells (Miyamoto et al., 1996; Bourgeois et al., 1997; Zhang et al., 1998). The significance of alternative splicing of ETA mRNA is unclear but could reduce the abundance of active receptor and reduce functions such as contractility. For example, mRNA encoding the predicted truncated receptor with the deletion of exon 3 and 4 was more abundant in human melanoma cell lines and melanoma tissue than the wild type (Zhang et al., 1998).\n\nB. Endothelin B Receptors\n\n1. Structure.\n\nHuman ETB gene (EDNRB) comprises 7 exons and 6 introns, is located on chromosome 13, and encodes a 442-amino acid protein. The ETB receptor has an unusually long N terminus ( ) that can be cleaved by a metalloprotease to remove the first 64 amino acids while still retaining ET-1 binding capacity. It is thought that amino acids associated with the first, second, third and seventh transmembrane spanning domains and associated extracellular loops are mainly involved in ligand binding where interestingly most of the naturally occurring or experimental mutations that affect ET ligand binding and ligand receptor selectivity coincide. The carboxyl terminus, as with other GPCRs, is important for intracellular signaling.\n\nLike ETA receptors, ETB receptors have a surprising number of potential post-translational modifications ( ). There are 13 phosphorylation sites comprising Tyr, Ser, Cys residues mainly located in the C terminus. There is a potential glycosylation site at Asn59 in the N terminus but no evidence yet that this is important for binding, although in other GPCRs at least one glycosylation site is often critical for receptor expression at the cell membrane and for function (Okamoto et al., 1998). In addition, there are four sites for possible palmitoylation. The clustering of Cys residues is conserved across many GPCRs, and the degree of C-terminal palmitoylation may act as a selector for coupling with different G proteins and different pathways of intracellular signaling (Stannard et al., 2003a,b). For example, ET mitogenic activity that stimulates extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK/MAP kinases) critically depends on palmitoylation (but not on phosphorylation) of ET receptors (Cramer et al., 2001). Okamoto et al. (1998) showed that substitution of three residues Cys402, Cys403, or Cys405 with Ser gave an unpalmitoylated mutant that retained binding and surface expression but did not couple to G proteins, suggesting a critical role in signaling.\n\n2. Receptor Mutations.\n\nHomozygote ETB knockout mice exhibit a different and nonoverlapping phenotype to ETA-deficient animals with survival for up to 8 weeks. The enteric nervous system precursors and neural crest-derived epidermal melanoblasts fail to colonize the intestine, causing an aganglionic megacolon and a pigmentary disorder in their skin. ET-3 knockouts display an identical phenotype (section V.B.3; Kurihara et al., 1999). This phenotype is similar to Hirschsprung disease (estimated at 1/5000 live births), a multigenetic disorder, where one of the causative genes includes mutations in ETB receptor expression (Tanaka et al., 1998). Hirschsprung disease can also be associated with Waardenburg syndrome (where in addition to colonic aganglionosis the patients have sensorineural hearing loss, hypopigmentation of skin and hair, and pigmentary disturbances of the irides) that is also linked to mutations in the ETB and ET-3 genes. The effect of some ETB receptor mutations in Hirschsprung disease have been tested experimentally. For example, A183G, W276C, R319W, M374I, and P383L had reduced intracellular signaling and reduced receptor density resulting in a loss of function, although all mutants bound ET-1 with high affinity ( ; Abe et al., 2000), suggesting ET agonists such as IRL 1620 could rescue function, whereas others such as the C109R mutation failed to translocate into the plasma membrane and had low ET-1 affinity.\n\nA naturally occurring 301-base pair deletion of the ETB gene resulting in a lack of ETB expression, elevation of plasma ET levels, and aganglionic megacolon was identified in \"spotting lethal\" rats. ETB deficiency caused early onset of renal impairment characterized by reduced sodium excretion and decreased glomerular filtration rate (Hocher et al., 2001; Taylor et al., 2003). A missense mutation in the ETB gene is also associated with Lethal White Foal Syndrome, an equine version of Hirschsprung disease (Metallinos et al., 1998).\n\n3. Splice Variants.\n\nAlternative splice variants of ETB receptors have been reported in humans but they do not seem as important as for other transmitters such as dopamine. Elshourbagy et al. (1996) identified a variant where substitution of 42 amino acids of the intracellular carboxy terminus of the ETB receptor was replaced with an alternative 36-residue sequence, resulted in a receptor retaining binding but lacking any potential palmitoylation sites so that ET-stimulated inositol phosphate accumulation was abolished. Messenger RNA encoding the variant was not particularly abundant, except in skeletal muscle where it represented more than 40% of the total mRNA. Shyamala et al. (1994) described a variant encoding a 10 amino acid increase in the length of the second cytoplasmic domain that exhibited limited distribution in heart, lung, brain, and placenta, but there was no change in binding characteristics or downstream signaling, and therefore the physiologic or pathophysiological significance is unclear. Tanoue et al. (2002) described a mutant ETB gene associated with Hirschsprung disease where the transcript lacked a 134-base pair nucleotide sequence corresponding to exon 5 that may not have been translated or rapidly degraded as a possible cause of the disease. An alternative transcript of the rat ETB in brain has also been reported (Cheng et al., 1993).\n\nC. Distribution of Endothelin Receptors\n\nThe distribution of mRNA encoding the two receptors is shown in , measured in adult mouse tissues, a species widely used for cell-specific disruption of the ET genes. The pattern emphasizes that ET receptor mRNA is likely to be detected in all tissues or organs receiving a blood supply, reflecting the ubiquitous expression of ETA on vascular smooth muscle and ETB on endothelial cells. Highest relative expression of ETA mRNA is associated with the heart and lungs with relatively low expression in the CNS. ETA mRNA was the fifth most abundant GPCR in heart atria and 11th in ventricle, emphasizing the importance of the ET pathway in the cardiovascular system (Regard et al., 2008). By radioligand binding, the brain regions measured have high expression of ETB receptors and in the periphery the lung is also a particularly ETB rich tissue.\n\nThe relative ratio of the two subtypes, measured by competition binding in human tissues, is shown in . The human brain contains a high density of ET receptors (see Schinelli, 2006 for review), with ETB accounting for 90% of total ET receptors in the cerebral cortex (Harland et al., 1995), localized to neuronal regions, particularly levels III and IV. The small proportion of ETA receptors detected were largely restricted to the smooth muscle of the cerebral vasculature (pial arteries and intracerebral vessels) and leptomeninges, with much lower but detectable levels in the gray and white matter. ETB receptors were not detected in the vascular structures or leptomeninges. Functional studies in rat cerebellum suggested glial cells expressed the ETB subtype, whereas some responses of neurons were ETA mediated (Davenport and Morton, 1991; Morton and Davenport, 1992). Smooth muscle cells of the small pial arteries and arterioles that penetrate into the human brain only express ETA receptors (Adner et al., 1994; Yu et al., 1995; Lucas et al., 1996; Harland et al., 1995, 1998; Pierre and Davenport, 1995, 1998a,b, 1999) that play a major role in the maintenance of cerebral blood flow. ET-1 potently constricts brain vessels, including cerebral (Adner et al., 1994) and pial arteries (Hardebo et al., 1989; Thorin et al., 1998; Pierre and Davenport, 1998b, 1999). The latter are particularly sensitive to ET-1 and provide the therapeutic rationale for blocking the actions of the peptide, which is thought to be a mediator of cerebrovascular disorders including delayed vasospasm associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage and stroke. In contrast to the periphery, both ligand binding (Yamaga et al., 1995) and functional studies suggest that human brain endothelial cells isolated from capillaries (diameter <10 µm) that form the blood-brain barrier and from larger microvessels express ETA receptors linked to phospholipase C and IP3 accumulation (Stanimirovic et al., 1994; Spatz et al., 1997) possibly functioning to increase capillary permeability, leading to edema (Purkiss et al., 1994). These studies used a comprehensive range of agonists and antagonists to show ETA-mediated responses, but this intriguing finding has not been explored further. Interestingly, there are numerous reports of upregulation of expression of ETB receptors in cerebrovascular smooth muscle in rat models of, for example, global ischemic stroke (Johansson et al., 2012), subarachnoid hemorrhage (Vikman et al., 2006), or cerebrovascular remodeling associated with diabetes (Kelly-Cobbs et al., 2011), although effectiveness of ETA or dual receptor antagonists in human cerebrovascular disease appears to be limited.\n\nIn human peripheral tissue, the lungs have the highest density of ET receptors (∼9600 fmol/g protein) measured to date compared with other peripheral tissues and even higher than the brain (∼5000 fmol/g protein) (Henry et al., 1990; McKay et al., 1991; Marciniak et al., 1992; Knott et al., 1995; Russell and Davenport, 1996). ETA receptors predominate on smooth muscle of pulmonary arteries and resistance vessels where the subtype mediates vasoconstriction (Hay et al., 1993; Maguire and Davenport, 1995), although McCulloch et al. (1996) suggested a contribution from ETB receptors in resistance vessels. The majority of ETB receptors in the lungs are present on the endothelium, but this receptor is also localized to airway smooth muscle and mediates bronchoconstriction (Adner et al., 1996; Takahashi et al., 1997; Hay et al., 1998), although Fukuroda et al. (1994a) detected an ETA component in isolated human bronchi responses to ET-1. Lower levels of receptors are detectable in parenchyma, airway submucosal glands, and small conduit arteries (Russell and Davenport, 1995). Plasma levels of ET-1 are increased in PAH and correlate with the severity of disease, as well as its prognosis (Rubens et al., 2001). ET-1 levels are also increased in explanted lungs (Giaid et al., 1993), as is the density of both subtypes in distal pulmonary arteries of patients with PAH (Davie et al., 2002). In PAH, this increase in ET-1 is thought to cause sustained vasoconstriction and stimulates cellular proliferation, cell migration, fibrosis, and hypertrophy (see Vachiery and Davenport, 2009).\n\nIn human heart, both receptor subtypes are expressed by the myocardium of atria and ventricles (Bax et al., 1993; Molenaar et al., 1992, 1993; Peter and Davenport, 1995a,b, 1996a; Pönicke et al., 1998) and septum, although the ETA receptor predominates. In myocytes ETA comprise 90% of the receptors. In contrast ETB receptors are more abundant in the atrioventricular conducting system (Molenaar et al., 1993). ET-1 is a potent positive inotropic agent (Davenport et al., 1989; Moravec et al., 1989). In vivo the endogenous ligand ET-1 has a tonic positive inotropic effect in normal subjects that can be blocked by BQ123 and is independent of any effect on the peripheral vasculature (MacCarthy et al., 2000). In the right ventricle of human hearts from PAH patients, there was a significant increase in the ratio of ETA to ETB receptors compared with normal hearts as well as a significant increase in the medial layer of small pulmonary arteries. The latter provide the rationale for efficacy of ET antagonists, although the increase in ETA in the ventricle is likely to be an adaptive response to left heart failure to cause a beneficial increase in cardiac output. This would be blocked in the setting of ET antagonism (Kuc et al., 2014). Interestingly, the density of the ETA subtype is increased by 50% in the left ventricle of patients with ischemic heart disease, whereas ETB receptor density is unaltered compared with nonfailing hearts (Peter and Davenport, 1996b).\n\nD. Function of Endothelin Receptors in the Cardiovascular System\n\n1. Endothelin A Receptor Constriction in the Human Cardiovascular System.\n\nThe two receptor subtypes exhibit contrasting cardiovascular actions under normal physiologic conditions. ET-1 is the most abundant isoform in the human cardiovascular system. On release from the endothelium, primarily directed abluminally, the peptide causes vasoconstriction, mainly via ETA receptors that are the principle subtype in the vascular medial layer (comprising mainly smooth muscle cells) in large conduit arteries and veins as well as small resistance vessels ( ). Electron microscope autoradiography has confirmed unequivocally the presence of high densities of ETA but low densities of ETB receptors in smooth muscle cells with few receptors of either subtype associated with the surrounding collagen (Russell et al., 1997).\n\nIn some, but not all, human vessels, ETB mRNA and a low density of ETB receptors (usually <15%) have been detected in the medial layer from certain vessels ( , Davenport et al., 1993, 1995a,b). Extensive pharmacological characterization of human isolated vessels shows that ETB agonists such as BQ3020 do not have any activity up to a concentration of 10 μM. Occasionally some vessels were found to respond to the more potent sarafotoxin 6c, but the magnitude of the response was much less than for ET-1. ET-3 was at least two orders of magnitude less potent than ET-1 consistent with activating ETA rather than ETB receptors. Finally all antagonists tested to date, such as BQ123, cause a parallel and rightward shift of the ET-1 concentration response curve in all vessels examined with Schild slopes close to unity (Maguire and Davenport, 1995, Pierre and Davenport, 1998a,b). Although there is a consistent pattern of ETA-mediated constriction in human vessels, in animals the relative contribution is more complex, with vasoconstriction via ETA, ETB, or a mixture of both depending on species or vascular beds. For example, BQ3020 and sarafotoxins 6c are potent constrictors of rat renal and mesenteric beds; BQ123 does not fully block these responses.\n\nIn agreement with in vitro studies in humans, infusion of BQ123 caused vasodilatation in volunteers when the ETA antagonist was infused into the brachial artery (Haynes and Webb, 1994), a finding repeated in other clinical studies. These observations are consistent with blocking the action of ET-1 that is being continuously released from the endothelium on vascular smooth muscle ETA receptors. This was significant as antagonists of other vasoconstrictors, such as ANGII, do not alter blood flow in normotensive individuals. In marked contrast, infusion of an ETB-selective antagonist BQ788 caused systemic vasoconstriction in healthy volunteers, showing that the main consequence of activation of endothelial ETB receptors by tonically secreted ET-1 was the physiologic basal release of nitric oxide (Verhaar et al., 1998).\n\nThe pharmacological action of ET-1 is very unusual compared with other vasoactive mediators such as ANGII. It remains the most powerful constrictor of human vessels discovered with a remarkably long-lasting action. For example, after intracisternal injection of 10 pmol ET-1 into dogs, the diameter of the basilar artery was 76% of the control after 3 days (Asano et al., 1989). No human vessel has been reported that does not respond to ET-1, suggesting the peptide is the \"universal\" vasoconstrictor. ET-1 is thought to play a major physiologic role in regulating vascular function and the flow of blood in most, if not all, organ systems, including heart, kidney, lungs, and liver. Other cell types that synthesize the peptide can also modulate vascular reactivity, including perivascular neurons in the periphery, perivascular astrocytes in the CNS, and, under pathophysiological conditions such as atherosclerosis, macrophages and monocytes. Overproduction of ET in pathophysiological conditions from the endothelium and other cellular sources can lead to constriction of vessels in conditions such as PAH, leading to vascular remodeling. This is exacerbated particularly where there is reduced production of opposing vasodilators such as nitric oxide, prostacyclin, and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor. Activation of the ETA receptor can drive proliferation in multiple cell types and contributes to fibrosis and inflammation.\n\nIt has often been reported that ET-1 binds irreversibly to ETA receptors. This raises a critical question about the tractability of ETA receptors as therapeutic targets in, for example, cerebral vasospasm, where antagonists if they are to be effective are required to reverse an established constrictor ET response (Pierre and Davenport, 1999). However, although dissociation of [125I]-ET-1 from cloned ETA receptors was slow compared with other ligands with a half-life of the about 6 hours (as would be expected for long-lasting constrictor responses), binding was not irreversible (Blandin et al., 2000). Similarly, about 20% of specific [125I]-ET-1 binding had dissociated from native ETA receptors in human aorta after 20 minutes (Maguire et al., 1996). Established ET-1 responses can be reversed in vitro and in vivo by receptor antagonists (Warner et al., 1994; Pierre and Davenport, 1999).\n\n2. Does Endothelin B Receptor-Mediated Constriction Change in Human Vascular Disease?\n\nDetailed pharmacological studies have investigated whether there is functional evidence for an upregulation of ETB receptors in human isolated coronary arteries. Constrictor responses to sarafotoxin 6c were variable, with 40% of healthy arteries and 50% of vessels containing an atherosclerotic lesion not responding to the ETB. Where vessels did respond, there was no difference in the maximum responses obtained in healthy and diseased tissues. There was also no change in ETB receptor density in the medial layer of atherosclerotic compared with control arteries (Maguire and Davenport, 2000). These results were supported by clinical studies. BQ123 caused coronary vasodilation and improved endothelial dysfunction in patients with atherosclerosis or its risk factors (Halcox et al., 2001). In a further 39 patients, ETB antagonism caused coronary microvascular constriction and not dilatation, without affecting epicardial coronary tone or endothelial function. Combined ETA and ETB blockade, however, dilated coronary conduit and resistance vessels and improved endothelial dysfunction of the epicardial coronary arteries (Halcox et al., 2007). Thus the results of both in vitro and in vivo studies show that ETA receptors contribute to basal constrictor tone with no evidence for constrictor ETB receptors in human atherosclerosis. Animal studies where ETB receptors are increased in pathophysiological conditions, in for example rat coronary arteries, are not representative of humans (Skovsted et al., 2014).\n\nOf particular relevance is what happens in PAH, the current target of ET antagonists. McCulloch et al. (1996) found ET-1 caused a biphasic response in pulmonary resistance arteries (150–200 μm internal diameter) with constrictor responses to low concentrations of ET-1 (<1 nM) blocked by an ETB antagonist, but at higher concentrations, greater than 1 nM, ET-1 responses were blocked by an ETA but not an ETB antagonist, suggesting that at levels of ET-1 in the pathophysiological range ETA receptors will be activated. Davie et al. (2002) quantified the ratio of the two receptor subtypes in small arteries (500–1000 μm) from PAH patients and healthy controls. Although overall ET receptor density in distal arteries was twofold greater than in controls, there was no change in any vessel in the ratio of ETA to ETB. These results suggest that ETB-mediated constrictor responses occur at low ET concentrations, but in the absence of a change in subtype ratio it is unlikely there would be increased ETB constrictor response in this patient group.\n\n3. Endothelin B Receptor Vasodilatation.\n\nAlthough the vascular endothelium represents only 1% of the weight of the vessel wall it is distributed as a monolayer throughout all vessels in the body. The paradox that the potent vasoconstrictor ET-1 was also a vasodilator was quickly recognized after its discovery and was particularly evident from early in vivo studies (Wright and Fozard, 1988), because vasodilator responses can be lost during the preparation of vessel for in vitro research. ET-1, released from endothelial cells, functions in an autocrine manner to feed back onto endothelial ETB receptors to release vasodilators, principally nitric oxide, but also prostacyclin or endothelium derive hyperpolarizing factor depending on the vascular bed. This feedback mechanism limits the constrictor actions of ET via smooth muscle ETA receptors and has an essential physiologic role in cardiovascular homeostasis. ET-1 is continuously released from the endothelial constitutive pathway. Low levels of ET-1 promote vasodilatation, whereas higher and pathophysiological concentrations increase blood pressure and total peripheral vascular resistance. In ET-1+/− heterozygous mice, levels of ET-1 in plasma and lung tissue were lower than wild type, and the animals developed elevated blood pressure and mild hypertension rather than the fall in blood pressure that might have been expected (Kurihara et al., 1994) but explainable by ETB-mediated dilatation as the predominant action of ET-1 in the wild-type mice.\n\nIn healthy volunteers, low doses of ET-1 infused into the brachial artery cause vasodilatation consistent with ETB-mediated release of vasodilators, but this was followed by sustained vasoconstriction of the forearm vascular bed at higher doses because the peptide accessed the smooth muscle ETA receptors (Kiowski et al., 1991). High concentrations of ET-3 also cause vasodilatation (Haynes et al., 1995a,b). Blocking ETB receptors using BQ788 caused vasoconstriction in healthy volunteers, showing that the main consequence of activation of endothelial ETB receptors by tonically secreted ET-1 was the physiologic basal release of nitric oxide (Verhaar et al., 1998). Similarly, ETA receptor antagonism caused vasodilatation in the peripheral circulation of volunteers and patients with chronic heart failure, whereas selective ETB receptor antagonism caused vasoconstriction in each group. ETB receptor antagonism may therefore cause potentially deleterious vasoconstriction in chronic heart failure (Love et al., 2000). Only nitric oxide, from a range of potential vasodilators tested as physiologic antagonists, was found to fully reverse ET-1-mediated constrictions in human epicardial coronary arteries (Wiley and Davenport, 2000, 2001a) and also inhibited ET-1 binding (Wiley and Davenport, 2001b). It is well established that nitric oxide inhibits ET-1 synthesis, for example in cultured endothelial cells (Ohkita et al., 2002) and synthetic ECE-1 enzyme (Kuruppu et al., 2014).\n\nThus ETB-mediated release of nitric oxide and other vasodilators is crucial in acting as a counterregulatory pathway to limit ETA-mediated vasoconstriction through stimulation of vascular cyclic GMP. In pathophysiological conditions where there is endothelial cell dysfunction resulting in a loss of vasodilators, the vasoconstrictor and other pathophysiological effects of ET-1, such as cell proliferation, will be potentiated. In addition, Big ET-1 levels are raised in some condition such as heart failure (Love et al., 2000), and alternative pathways for ET-1 synthesis from Big ET-1, for example by the vascular smooth muscle, would result in ET-1 binding immediately to ETA receptors and thus negating activation of the endothelial ETB feedback pathway that opposes vasoconstriction.\n\n4. Endothelin B Receptor Clearing Receptors.\n\nIn addition to vasodilatation, endothelial ETB receptors function as clearing or scavenger receptors to internalize the ligand-receptor complex and remove ET-1 from the circulation ( ; Gasic et al., 1992; Fukuroda et al., 1994b). Systemic and selective blockade of ETB receptors results in a significant rise in circulating ET-1 (Plumpton et al., 1996). Importantly this is not simply the result of displacement of ET-1 release from the endothelium that would otherwise have bound to vascular ETA receptors, because plasma ET-3 levels also rise. Increases in plasma ET-1 have also been reported for mixed antagonists that block both receptors, such as bosentan, where there is a dose-dependent rise in plasma ET-1 (see, for example, Williamson et al., 2000). With mixed antagonists, provided ETA receptors are blocked it is unlikely that ET-1 will have any adverse effect, whereas selective blockade of ETB may potentially be detrimental. In contrast, administration of the selective ETA antagonists in animals and humans usually does not increase but in some cases reduce plasma ET-1 levels compared with nonselective antagonists, which have been documented to increase ET-1 levels. For example, in patients with heart failure acute ETA antagonism by sitaxentan caused selective pulmonary vasodilatation associated with a reduction in plasma ET-1 (Givertz et al., 2000). Monitoring changes in plasma ET-1 provides an elegant biomarker of receptor occupancy of ETB receptors and also a guide as to the selectivity of antagonists in vivo.\n\nClearance of ET-1 in humans is very efficient and was reported to be biphasic. The half-life of the initial phase was 4 minutes, with a longer late phase that had not reached basal after 1 hour (Vierhapper et al., 1990). A biphasic curve was obtained with Big ET-1 with a half-life of 7 minutes and 23 minutes for the late phase (Hemsen et al., 1995). By comparison, ET-3 plasma half-life was 1.7 minutes (Weitzberg et al., 1995). In humans, the lungs (Dupuis et al., 1996), liver (Gandhi et al., 1996), and kidney (Saito et al., 1991) are important sites for removal of ET-1. This reflects that these organs are ETB rich ( ): Seventy percent of the ET receptors in both the cortex and medulla of the kidney are ETB and localize to endothelial cells throughout the renal vasculature consistent with clearing ET-1 (Kuc et al., 1995; Gariepy et al., 2000). In lung comprising about 50% ETB, the majority are present on the vascular endothelium. The isolated perfused liver extracts proportionately more ET-1 than the lungs, with 80% uptake in a single pass through binding to ETB receptors on hepatic stellate cells and is reduced in conditions such as cirrhosis (Rockey and Weisiger, 1996). Plasma levels of ET-1 are increased in patients with cirrhosis, and elevated concentrations in the liver are thought to be a consequence of both increased synthesis and decreased clearance (Hinterhuber et al., 2004).\n\nThe technique of positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]-ET-1 allows the dynamic distribution and uptake to be visualized in all organs (Johnstrom et al., 2005). This study confirmed the rapid removal from the circulation within 2 minutes, and the major sites for clearance of circulating [18F]-ET-1 were the lungs, the liver, and the kidney (particularly the glomeruli, cortex, and inner medulla/papilla), with only low levels of uptake visualized in the thyroid, pituitarym and salivary glands and no binding to the skeleton or brain, the latter indicating the peptide did not cross the blood-brain barrier. BQ788 injected before [18F]-ET-1 significantly reduced clearing in lung and kidney by 85% confirming the role of the ETB subtype, although interestingly [18F]-ET-1 significantly increased in the liver because the label was no longer cleared by ETB receptors and now bound to the ETA subtype. BQ788 injected after [18F]-ET-1 did not displace the radioligand, consistent with internalization of ET-1 by ETB receptors and degradation in the lysosome (Bremnes et al., 2000). [18F]-ET-1 could not be visualized to the heart despite expressing this organ expressing ETB receptors, but binding was detected under BQ788 blockade. These results emphasize the importance of ETB receptors in maintaining low circulating plasma levels and the potential for ET-1 levels to rise under pathophysiological conditions where clearance is reduced. ETB receptors are expressed by a number of cell types in addition to endothelial cells including epithelial and smooth muscle cells. Do these contribute to removal of ET-1? Selective deletion of endothelial ETB receptors in mice (with other ETB receptors expressed by other cell types unaffected with no change in ETA) resulted in impaired clearance of an intravenous bolus of labeled ET-1 (Bagnall et al., 2006; Kelland et al., 2010b). [18F]-Big ET-1 was also rapidly cleared from the circulation of the rat (half-life ∼3 minutes) with uptake of radioactivity in three major organs: the liver and lungs were major sites for conversion (inhibited by phosphoramidon), whereas in the kidney [18F]-Big ET-1 was excreted largely unmetabolized (Johnstrom et al., 2010).\n\nE. Receptor Heterodimers?\n\nGPCRs were originally considered as monomeric proteins, but it is now well established that GPCRs are able to form dimers, particularly receptors in Family C, and there is some evidence for a number of Class A receptor dimers, e.g., β1 and β2 adrenoceptors, CCR2 and CCR5 (Pin et al., 2007). NC-IUPHAR has published a number of criteria that should be met before a heterodimer can be established. There should be a specific pharmacological property, such as a ligand-specific response of the heterodimer. There should be evidence for physical association in native tissues or primary cells; coimmunolocalization using antibodies recognizing each of the subunits should be used, ideally by electron microscopy level, energy transfer technologies, and recombinant fluorescent proteins. Knockout animals or RNAi technology may also provide key information on the existence of heterodimeric GPCRs in vivo.\n\nGregan et al. (2004) demonstrated that ETA/ETB heterodimers artificially expressed in HEK293 cells could be coimmunoprecipitated using ETB-specific antibodies, detected using FLAG-tagged ETA and myc-tagged ETB receptors and confirmed using fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy. The authors observed a pharmacological difference in that ETA/ETB heterodimers internalized more slowly in response to ET-1 than with BQ3020. If this occurred in native tissues this could change the number of functional ETB receptors on the cell surface and also the clearance of ET-1. Evans and Walker (2008a,b) explored evidence for both homo (ETA/ETA, ETB/ETB)- and heterodimers (ETA/ETB). These studies used energy transfer technologies and coimmunoprecipitation to show close association for each of the dimer pairs and a pharmacological difference between homodimers that when stimulated by ET-1 mediated a transient increase in calcium but a sustained increase was obtained to ET-1 with ETA/ETB heterodimers. These studies meet some of the required criteria, but were all done in HEK293 cells. Further experiments are required in native tissues to determine whether heterodimers exist, for example, in epithelial cells where both subtypes are expressed and whether such dimers have any physiologic or pathophysiological significance.\n\nIV. Classification of Selective Agonists and Antagonists\n\nOver the last 20 years the development of agonists and antagonists of varying degrees of specificity for both receptors has been extensive, not only as pharmacological probes but also for candidate drugs. The most concise overview (many compounds from which are discussed individually in this section) is maintained on the IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY (GotPdb) web site (Pawson et al., 2014; Southan et al., 2016). The entry for ETA antagonists is at guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=219 and for ETB at guidetopharmacology.org/GRAC/ObjectDisplayForward?objectId=220, where further information on structure-activity and molecular structures can be downloaded. Although the GtoPdb entries are an expert-curated core set, the much larger number of receptor-to-compound mappings in ChEMBL represents a maximal compilation extracted from the medicinal chemistry literature (PMID 24214965). Release 20 of ChEMBL (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/) specifies 3885 unique chemical structures mapped to ET receptors, but this includes inactive compounds and entries are not categorized pharmacologically as agonist or antagonist. As a triage, these 3885 records were filtered to distinct structures with a reported affinity greater than 1 µM then mapped to PubChem Compound Identifiers. This resulted in 1133 chemical structures with binding data for the ETA receptor, 534 for the ETB, 456 against both, 677 A-only, and 78 B-only. Lists for these sets of ChEMBL IDs are available as supplementary data on figshare (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1549677).\n\nA comparatively large number of nonpeptide antagonists were developed for potential clinical use. ET receptor antagonists are classified as either selective for one receptor subtype or alternatively as mixed or \"balanced\" antagonists that block both receptors. The classification is usually made by the company or group discovering the compound by measuring the affinity at the two subtypes and calculating a ratio of selectivity, but there is no agreed definition. We have proposed ETA-selective compounds should display more than 100-fold selectivity for the ETA subtype and those with less than 100-fold ETA selectivity should be classified as mixed antagonists (Davenport and Maguire, 2006). Similarly, ETB agonists and antagonists should display 100-fold selectivity to be useful research compounds. In practice, the tool compounds described below display at least two orders of magnitude selectivity and, provided appropriate concentrations are chosen, would be expected to be selective in both in vivo and in vitro assays. In contrast, a number of antagonists developed for clinical use display marginal selectivity ( ). Bosentan is commercially available and is a mixed ETA/ETB antagonist. One of the first orally active nonpeptide antagonists to be discovered, it has been widely used in in vitro and experimental models.\n\nA. Agonists\n\nET-1 is equipotent for ETA and ETB and will therefore activate both. ET-1 has been widely used in pharmacological preparations in vitro and in vivo as well as experimental medicine studies in volunteers and patients. Most studies characterizing and localizing ET receptors have used [125I]-ET-1 (directly labeled via Tyr13, a residue not critical for ligand-receptor interaction) that binds with the same affinity to both subtypes. This radiolabeled analog of ET-1 is stable under nonphysiologic binding conditions with little or no degradation being detected. ET-1 can also be labeled with the positron emitting isotope [18F] and used to image and quantify ET receptors in vivo (Johnstrom et al., 2005). [125I]-ET-2, [125I]-VIC, and [125I]-sarafotoxin 6b have also been labeled and used in saturation assays where they also bind to both subtypes (Davenport and Morton, 1991; Bacon and Davenport, 1996; Maguire et al., 1996). Binding was also detected using [125I]-ET-Big ET-1 labeled at Tyr13 to follow processing by enzymic cleavage to the mature labeled peptide, whereas no specific binding was detected with Big [125I]-ET-1 labeled at Tyr31, where enzymic activity yielded the inactive C-terminal fragment (Russell et al., 1998). [18F]-ET-Big has also been used to quantify and characterize conversion in vivo using PET (Johnstrom et al., 2010).\n\nSome authors preferred to inject Big ET-1 instead of ET-1 for in vivo studies in the rat designed to characterize antagonists such as bosentan, arguing that the conversion to the mature peptide by the vasculature is a better representation of the ET signaling pathway (Clozel et al., 1994). However, in a detailed study that compared the ability of bosentan to block the actions in vivo of ET-1 versus Big ET-1, it was clear that the responses were not the same, with the authors concluding that ET-1 triggered a covert mesenteric vasodilator mechanism that was antagonized by bosentan but not seen with the precursor (Gardiner et al., 1994).\n\n1. Endothelin Receptor A-Selective Agonists.\n\nNo ETA-selective agonists, either peptide or nonpeptide, have been discovered.\n\n2. Endothelin Receptor B-Selective Agonists: Sarafotoxin 6c, IRL1620, BQ3020, and Radioligands.\n\nInitially receptor subtypes were characterized by their rank order of affinity for the three ET peptides: ETA: ET-1 = ET=2 > ET-3 versus ETB: ET-1 = ET-2 = ET-3. Therefore, ET-3 is the only endogenous ET peptide that distinguishes the two receptor subtypes. For ligand binding assays, ET-3 can be radiolabeled at three positions: Tyr6, Tyr13, and Tyr14. Tyr6 is generally used because it is more difficult to separate [125I]-ET-3 labeled at the latter two Tyr residues, although all three ET-3 ligands have similar affinities. In practice, the selectivity of ET-3 for ETB versus ETA receptors is often only about two orders of magnitude ( ), and it is difficult to precisely delineate the two subtypes in functional experiments without the use of selective antagonists. ET-3 has been used in clinical studies, for example by Haynes et al., (1995a, b).\n\nFour synthetic peptides have become established as the most highly cited compounds that are selective agonists at the ETB receptor with greater selectivity than ET-3, and interpretation of results for these are unequivocal. Sarafotoxin 6c, one of the four sarafotoxin isoforms originally identified from the snake venom, has remarkably high selectivity for rat ETB receptors (200,000-fold', Williams et al., 1991), although less so for ETB human receptors ( ; Russell and Davenport, 1996). The peptide is resistant to peptidases. [Ala1,3,11,15]-ET-1 (Saeki et al., 1991) is a linear analog of ET-1 where substitution of Ala for Cys residues removes the disulfide bridges, converting the ET-1 structure to an ETB agonist. The most widely used ETB-selective agonists are IRL1620 (Suc-[Glu9, Ala11,15]-endothelin-18-21) (Takai et al., 1992), which is a truncated linear analog where the N terminus has an N-succinyl modification that reduces metabolism by nonspecific peptidases, and BQ3020 ([Ala11,15]Ac-ET-l6-21) (Ihara et al., 1992b). Sarafotoxin 6c has been used in experimental medicine studies in humans (Haynes et al., 1995a, b). All four peptides have been radiolabeled to characterize ETB receptors, although [125I]-BQ3020 and [125I]-IRL1620 have been most frequently used (Ihara et al., 1992b; Molenaar et al., 1992). [125I]-BQ3020 binds with subnanomolar affinity to the ETB receptor with 1500-fold selectivity for this subtype over the ETA receptor, and [18F]-BQ3020 has been used as a selective PET imaging agent in vivo (Johnstrom et al., 2000, 2006). [125I]-IRL1620 is also highly ETB selective (Watakabe et al., 1992).\n\n3. Endothelin Receptor B Agonists in Chemotherapy and Neuroprotection.\n\nETB agonists have been tested for clinical application in cancer (Maguire and Davenport 2012; Gulati et al., 2012). A Phase 1 clinical trial of IRL-1620 (SPI-1620, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals; (Henderson, Nevada)) was carried out in"
