        "text": "Understand\n\n[edit]\n\nAarhus is known as \"The City of Smiles\" (Danish: Smilets By). This slogan probably started as publicity to improve the city's image, but it has nevertheless caught on.\n\nBeing a university city and centre of education, Aarhus has a large student population and one of the lowest median ages of any city in Europe. The cultural scene here is always thriving. For years, Aarhus has been an incubator for Danish artists and performers. It is also home to Aarhus Festuge, Scandinavia's largest cultural festival, held annually for 10 days at the end of August. In addition, Aarhus, along with the East Jutland Metropolitan area for which it serves as the central hub, is the fastest-growing area in Denmark in terms of population. There is a huge building boom taking place with new high-rises sprouting like mushrooms on the skyline. Little wonder, then, that Aarhus was selected as 2017's European Capital of Culture, with a full slate of events on tap all year throughout the entire city and region.\n\nOrientation\n\n[edit]\n\nAarhus C\n\n[edit]\n\nAarhus City is the central district and the most active area of the city with several interesting and special neighbourhoods, including these:\n\nIndre by (Inner City) is the old medieval core of the city which used to be walled and gated up until 1857. A large part of the inner city is pedestrianized. The Latin Quarter is a small special quarter with cobblestone streets, low-rise buildings and old townhouses that has been preserved.\n\nVesterbro, situated north and west of Indre by, is mostly a residential area. However, you'll find several major attractions including the Botanical Gardens, the Old Town museum and the main university campus.\n\nÃ˜gade-kvarteret is a residential quarter immediately northwest of the Latin Quarter and also presents a unique town environment with lowrise buildings and colourful townhouses, mostly from around the 1850s-1920s. Most of the streets of the quarter are named after Danish islands.\n\nAarhus Ã˜ is a new residential neighbourhood on the harbourfront.\n\nTrÃ¸jborg is located north of the inner city and is like a small town within the city. The area was developed in the early 1900s with mostly four- or five-storey apartment blocks in brick. It used to be a working class neighbourhood. It is a somewhat quiet residential quarter but also includes a central shopping street with restaurants and a cinema.\n\nFrederiksbjerg is another quarter with its own charm and character. Located immediately south of the broad railway yard in the city centre, this area was developed primarily in the late 1800s and most of the original buildings have been preserved. It is a lovely mix of bustling street life, restaurants, specialty shops, small businesses and residential areas. Mostly low-rise buildings and townhouses, with several small parks in between.\n\nAarhus N\n\n[edit]\n\nAarhus Nord (Aarhus North) is a large postal district comprising the northern parts of the city. It is made up mostly of quiet residential neighbourhoods, but boasts natural attractions such as the Risskov urban forest, EgÃ¥ EngsÃ¸ lake area, and some beach parks. The district is also home to several educational institutions, a large business park, an industrial park with light industry, and a huge regional hospital. Some of the neighbourhoods in Aarhus N, like Skejby and Vejlby, are former suburban villages that have merged with the city.\n\nAarhus V\n\n[edit]\n\nAarhus Vest (Aarhus West) is perhaps the largest postal district and includes all the western neighbourhoods of the city. Most of it is residential areas of more recent development, but some neighbourhoods, like Ã…by and Hasle, are former suburban villages or outlying farms that have merged with the city. There are several natural attractions in this large area, including the Brabrand Lake area and the nature site of SkjoldhÃ¸jkilen, and many opportunities for sports.\n\nViby and HÃ¸jbjerg\n\n[edit]\n\nViby (officially Viby J, with J for Jutland) is a former railway town that has merged with the expanding city. It is sometimes unofficially referred to as Aarhus S (Aarhus South) along with HÃ¸jbjerg, SkÃ¥de and Holme, three adjacent districts and neighbourhoods. There is some activity around the central square of Viby Torv, but otherwise these southern parts of town are predominantly residential. Marselisborg Forests and the Moesgaard Museum are the two most important attractions here.\n\nWhen to go\n\n[edit]\n\nAs the seasons change, the character of Aarhus changes accordingly. In winter, outdoor activities are limited and this is primarily a time for the indoors. It is unusual for everything to be covered in metre- thick layers of snow and the temperatures are not excruciating cold normally, but daylight hours are limited, the trees stand bare, and the skies are often depressingly grey. While the city is still full of people, the outdoor street life is uninspiring for most visitors, except for the Christmas period of December. At this time, the city centre is decorated, and as Christmas approaches, more street vendors sell sweet treats and comfort food such as Ã¦bleskiver, pancakes, mulled wine, and sugar-glazed almonds.\n\nStarting in Apr-May and ending with Oct-Nov, the city has more to offer. The beech trees burst into leaves around the first of May, and daylight hours and temperatures increase rapidly throughout this month. Having waited for this, citizens are quick to fill the parks and green spaces; street life shows much more intensity and diversity, and several outdoor events take place. However, Aarhus, as the rest of Denmark, is almost closed down with empty streets during Easter.\n\nMajor attractions in Aarhus are open throughout the summer, but quite a few restaurants are closed for several weeks, though not all at once; there are still plenty of opportunities. However, if you plan to visit a specific eatery, confirm their hours beforehand. In July and August, many residents leave the city or travel abroad. University students have time off from their studies and many visit family in other cities, work elsewhere, or travel. Working people have five weeks of paid vacation and nearly everybody spends some of it during this season. For these reasons, the city centre can appear deserted in mid-July to early August and chances are that you will encounter more visitors than residents. It would therefore be a good idea to combine a visit to Aarhus with excursions to nearby countryside and attractions in the height of summer. From mid-August, things start to happen again in the city as residents return. It is still summer and soon time for the annual Aarhus Fest.\n\nThrough September, the temperatures begin to cool and it gets windier, but there are still many daylight hours in the day and the weather is usually fine. From October the leaves on the trees start to turn yellow and red, and any trace of summer ends with the onset of November. September and October are also a good time to visit if you want to include outdoor and nature experiences to your trip, just bring more warm clothing. October and parts of November is a particularly beautiful time of year in the city parks and forests with all the vibrant colours of autumn.\n\nTourist information\n\n[edit]\n\nAs most other places in Denmark, the official tourist website of Aarhus is managed by VisitDenmark, a public-private partnership with free tourist services. The Aarhus website is called VisitAarhus.\n\nThe main office for tourist information in the city is in the Dokk1 library building at the harbour front. Ask the staff at the information desk and they will help you. In the summer, extra staff servicing tourists specifically are there to help. There is also a touchscreen available with interactive tourist information about the city, and a plethora of free inspirational and informative pamphlets about notable sights and happenings in the region.\n\nGet around\n\n[edit]\n\nThe entire city is clean and well organized, which makes walking an excellent and enjoyable way to get around. The inner city has an extensive pedestrian zone, and almost every town road in Denmark has sidewalks. If you want to venture further out, several routes have been established for exercise and for leisurely strolls. Known as \"sunbeams\", they avoid heavily trafficked roads and includes nature experiences.\n\nBy bicycle\n\n[edit]\n\nBicycles are easily available for rent in the central parts of town. In addition to the listings below some hotels have bikes available for rental by their guests.\n\nEven though Denmark is very flat generally, Aarhus has some of the steepest roads in the country and they can be quite a challenge if you aren't used to ride a bicycle. However, most roads are a breeze and on longer rides, you can usually plan your route to avoid the hardest ascends if you fear the \"Aarhusian Alps\".\n\nThe inner city of Aarhus has a network of bicycle streets (Danish: Cykelgader) where priority is given to cyclists. Here bicycles can use the entire lane and cars are not supposed to drive faster than normal cycling speed. However not all drivers respect these rules (perhaps because they are unaware of them), so you should still watch out for car traffic.\n\ny\n\nBy light rail\n\n[edit]\n\nThe electric light rail system \"Aarhus Letbane\" opened its first line in late 2017, as the first rail system of its kind in Denmark, and is bound for further expansions into the suburbs in coming years.\n\nTickets can be purchased with credit cards at electronic stands on selected stops, and the tickets are fully compatible with the local yellow bus system (and vice versa). Tickets cannot be purchased aboard the light rail train. Bicycles can be brought along for an extra fee, although not on the inner city stretch \"Skolebakken - Universitetshospitalet\" during weekday mornings and afternoon rush hour periods (07:00-09:00 and 15:00-17:00). The train schedules, important info, and the zoning system can be checked at the Letbanen website.\n\nBy bus\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are two bus systems in Aarhus, both operated by Midttrafik. Yellow buses serve local routes within the city limits, and Blue buses serve municipal and regional routes. The blue bus routes pass through the inner city, so if you have to go on longer journeys, you do not have to change between the two systems. X-buses are express blue buses, discernible by a large X sign. X-buses make fewer stops, are equipped with free Wifi, usually have toilets and you are allowed to eat and drink. All blue buses have limited cargo space for heavy luggage, bicycles, etc., that you can use if you inform the chauffeur. You can enter the yellow city buses using all doors. On the blue regional buses entrance is at the front door only (with some exceptions, such as the 200 and 100).\n\nTickets are preferably purchased in advance in the Midttrafik app or in the Midttrafik webshop. The app is free for download on App Store and Google Play. Here you can buy single tickets, multi trip ticket cards, and special tourist tickets for busses and Letbanen. As a special service, blue buses also offers the opportunity to buy a ticket with cash from the chauffeur. Tickets bought on blue buses (and trains) can also be used to ride the local yellow buses, but not necessarily the other way around. If you ride without a valid ticket, you risk getting fined heavily, so don't take chances.\n\nBus tickets for travel within the city limits are kr 22, or kr 11 if you are under 16 years of age. Up to two accompanied children (under 12 years) travel for free. Multi-trip ticket cards are also available (10-trips), varying in price depending on how far you want to go. Cheaper cards are also available for people under 16 years old. Finally, there are tickets that allow you to ride all you want for 30 days, with prices depending on how far you wish to travel. For planning trips, it is recommended to use Rejseplanen; the official travel planner website for all Danish public transport. It is also available as an app.\n\nNight buses are extra buses and routes to and from the outlying districts and suburbs throughout the night. The fare is double the normal price.\n\nIn all of Denmark, train tickets can also be used to ride local bus lines, if you get on the bus within the time limit on your ticket.\n\nBy taxi\n\n[edit]\n\nBy car\n\n[edit]\n\nAarhus has very good public transit and in the inner city most sights are within walking distance of each other. A car is therefore really only needed if you want to explore the countryside. In addition, you will find that parking is restricted and rather expensive in Aarhus C. Free parking is scarce, except at a few places like Tangkrogen, in front of Ceres Park & Arena and at some shopping centres.\n\nWhile traffic rarely comes to a complete standstill, the ring roads and inner city streets are often quite congested during rush hour. That being said, should you need a car while staying in Aarhus, there are several car rental companies with centrally located rental stations.\n\nRemember to yield to cyclists. Aarhus is a hilly city and cyclists going downhill will often be approaching intersections at high speed.\n\nThere is a low emission zone in Aarhus; see Driving in Denmark#Low Emission Zones.\n\nDo\n\n[edit]\n\nFor a city its size, Aarhus offers a multitude of things for visitors to do. Public events are generally oriented for folks of all ages and budgets, so whether you're a solo visitor, a family, young, old, handicapped, on a tight budget, or in the mood to splurge, there's much to choose from.\n\nGuided tours and sightseeing\n\n[edit]\n\nTheatre & performing arts\n\n[edit]\n\nEvery second year in May, Aarhus is host to the International Living Theatre (ILT) festival, with the next event taking place in 2025. For a number of days, thespians from all over the world meet up here and share the universe of stage art in its broadest sense with each other and interested participants and audiences.\n\nCinema\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are three mainstream movie houses in Aarhus, and a number of smaller niche theaters.\n\nLive music\n\n[edit]\n\nFestivals and events\n\n[edit]\n\nBeaches\n\n[edit]\n\nAlmost the entire coastline of Denmark consists of publicly-accessible sandy beaches well suited for leisurely activities, and the Aarhus area is no different. Beachcombers might want to be on the lookout for petrified belemnites and sea urchins, but you shouldn't expect to spot any amber in this part of Denmark.\n\nThe municipality offers real-time updates of water quality, temperature, etc., at area beaches, on a website and via a free mobile app. Be aware that there is increased wave activity throughout the entire bay whenever the catamaran ferry is passing through. The phenomenon is harmless and only lasts 5-10 minutes, but small children are sometimes frightened by this, especially when it happens on an otherwise calm day.\n\nSwimming pools\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are a total of four public indoor swimming pools throughout the city that can be used most of the year. Be sure to check up, as some are closed for extensive periods in the summer. Same price at all venues: kr 45; special prices for children and groups. You can rent towels and bathing suits at some places, but it is expensive.\n\nSports\n\n[edit]\n\nThroughout the city there are a number of sports complexes, small and large stadiums, indoor sports halls, and several facilities for street sports. Apart from the free street-level activities, you'll need to be a member of a team to visit most of these places, but sometimes hourly rental or trial lessons are offered.\n\nFootball: Aarhus GF play soccer in Superliga, Denmark's top tier. (And other sports: GF is Gymnastikforening, since you were wondering.) Their home ground is Ceres Park (capacity 19,400) 2 km south of city centre.\n\nAarhus hosts many large sports events on both national and international level. You may want to attend or plan your visit around one of these events. Among the coming happenings, Aarhus will present Urban Sports Festival in the summer of 2024, European Choir Festival in 2025, and Tall Ships Races in 2026.\n\nBoating\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the summer from early May through September you can rent canoes at the central community centre of and paddle along the Aarhus River for short or extended journeys.\n\nAngling\n\n[edit]\n\nTo fish as a recreational activity in Denmark, you are required to buy an Angler Fishing License (Fisketegn).\n\nThere are several popular spots for angling on the harbourfront, although eating bottom-feeders caught in the harbour is not recommended for health reasons. The sea, coasts and countryside around Aarhus, present many opportunities for angling. Saltwater fish includes sea trout, cod, mackerel, herring, and flatfish. Sometimes migrating fish like garfish are plentiful, depending on the season. Freshwater fish in streams and lakes, includes trout, pike, perch, and in some places zander, roach or bream.\n\nHorse riding\n\n[edit]\n\nA few places offers horseback riding as an alternative way to experience the immediate countryside.\n\nGolf\n\n[edit]\n\nThe East Jutland region has many options for golfers. The courses are of a high quality and often situated in beautiful settings. As part of this region, Aarhus has several options:\n\nMiscellaneous\n\n[edit]\n\nEat\n\n[edit]\n\nThis page uses the following price ranges for a typical meal for one, including soft drink: Budgetup to kr 120 Mid-rangekr 120-300 Splurgekr 300 and up\n\nAarhus is generally known as one of the best places to eat in Denmark. However, the best places are not necessarily located at the most prominent addresses, so a bit of browsing is recommended if you have a particular interest in fine dining. Prices tend toward the low end â€” perfect for perennially cash-strapped university students â€” but that's not necessarily an indicator of low quality; you can find surprisingly good food at some of these budget-priced places. Several spots have lunch offers.\n\nWith an immigrant population of around 15%, Aarhus has many opportunities for ethnic food; Italian, Greek, Middle Eastern, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai and Japanese food are the most common cuisines, and again, prices are usually quite affordable.\n\nMost restaurants close the kitchen at 21:00, but you can usually sit back and enjoy your meal for as long as you like. At gourmet spots, it is a good idea to book a table beforehand, and for groups of five or more people it is highly recommended. Otherwise, you risk being turned down in the door, due to the unexpected workload or lack of space. Many restaurants are closed for extensive periods throughout the year; usually in the summer months or Jan-Feb, so be sure to check in advance if you plan to visit a specific place.\n\nBarbecue and burgers\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the last decade or so, Aarhus has experienced a veritable \"burger war\", with good quality burger joints popping up everywhere, making for strong competition. Middle Eastern fare such as kebab, shawarma and falafel can be had at numerous eateries in nightlife districts, and Aarhus has several choices for traditional Danish-style barbecue as well.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nIn addition to what's listed below, no visit to Denmark would be complete without patronizing a PÃ¸lsevogn (sausage wagon): street vendors that sell a variety of hot dogs, sausages, and sometimes burgers. The inner city has several, including one in front of the central station and another at City Hall Square, most of which are owned by a Danish charity that donates the surplus to needy children.\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nMediterranean\n\n[edit]\n\nFrench and Italian fare is popular and easy to find around Aarhus, but the Mediterranean options also includes a few Spanish and Greek style restaurants.\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nPizzerias are abundant throughout the city, including the outlying districts. Some places puts in an extra effort:\n\nOther noteworthy places with budget options include:\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nGood restaurants with a broader and more substantial Mediterranean menu include:\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nAsian\n\n[edit]\n\nBudget\n\n[edit]\n\nThere are many options for a budget-priced Asian meal. Chinese restaurants usually offer budget-priced lunch buffets, a few Ã  la carte dishes, and takeaway boxes. Notable also is a cluster of Asian-style eateries in NÃ¸rregade.\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nSushi dominates the roster of mid-priced Asian restaurants in Aarhus, and there are many options. In addition, the following restaurants stands out in the Asian-style category:\n\nInternational gourmet\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile gourmet dining in Denmark traditionally means French cuisine, the large and diverse slate of such restaurants in Aarhus also includes Italian and Spanish-inspired gourmet cooking, seafood restaurants, and New Nordic. Four places have been awarded a Michelin star and several are mentioned in respectable food guides, including the White Guide covering Nordic countries specifically.\n\nMost larger hotels have their own restaurant, usually with decent-quality international fare at mid-range prices, and some with outstanding dining. You don't have to have a room there to eat there. See the \"Sleep\" section or individual hotel websites for details. Further out into the countryside, traditional inns (kroer) also offer culinary experiences comprising both native Danish fare as well as international gourmet cuisine, again mostly at mid-range prices.\n\nMid-range\n\n[edit]\n\nGreat quality international gourmet food can be had for mid-range prices. Even if your budget is limited to mid-range, do also check out \"Splurge\" restaurants, as more expensive places are known to offer special promotional discounts from time to time.\n\nSplurge\n\n[edit]\n\nSteakhouses\n\n[edit]\n\nDenmark is well-known worldwide for its pork, but also produces topnotch beef. Many restaurants have steak on the menu, including some of the international gourmet spots, but a few places serve it as the specialty of the house. To enjoy the best possible steak in Aarhus, you will have to splurge.\n\nTraditional Danish food\n\n[edit]\n\nUnlike the experimental and often quite expensive dining of the New Nordic Cuisine, traditional Danish food is hearty, simple, and of course old-school â€” and its popularity is surging on Denmark's restaurant scene these days. Special menus are served around Mortens Aften (St. Martin's Day; 11 November), Christmas, and Easter. Prices are mostly mid-range.\n\nVegetarian\n\n[edit]\n\nMany eateries in Aarhus have vegetarian dishes or alternatives on the menu. Only a few places are dedicated vegetarian only.\n\nCafÃ©s\n\n[edit]\n\nThe many cafÃ©s in Aarhus span a diverse range, from tiny holes-in-the-wall with two chairs to extravagantly decorated places with mirror rooms and waiters in fancy clothes. Some places serve only the most basic items, while other places offer lunch, evening dinners or cocktails and parties at night. So whatever you are looking for, it shouldn't be a problem to find a cafÃ© that suits your taste or pocket.\n\nThe majority of cafÃ©s in Aarhus are unique, each with their own individual charm and character, and you'll find an emphasis on high-quality coffee in quite a few of them. However, national chain cafÃ©s also have a presence, with locations of Espresso House, emmerys, Lagkagehuset and Anettes Sandwich across the city, and Starbucks have two cafÃ©s in the inner city as well. If you're not a coffee drinker, cafÃ©s also often serve hot chocolate and sometimes smoothies, but quality tea is only just beginning to catch on around these parts.\n\nTake note that in almost all cafÃ©s in Denmark you are expected to contact staff yourself, usually at the desk, to grab a menu card, to place your order and when you wants to pay. This is often very bewildering to tourists, but is how things are typically done in Denmark and not a sign of rude or ignorant service.\n\nAlthough there is a high concentration in the inner city, cafÃ©s can be found all over town. A few special places might be hard to discover without particular mention:\n\nBakeries\n\n[edit]\n\nDenmark has a long tradition of unique, good quality bread and confectionery. You might find it in cafÃ©s or in common bakeries across the city, but some places merit a visit for the special effort they put into the craft of baking.\n\nand are two Danish chains of high-end bakeries with attached cafÃ© sections. Lagkagehuset has seven spots across town and presents a great selection of cakes which, apart from the Danish pastries of course, include cold confectioners cakes such as layercakes and creamcakes. Emmerys is an organic certified bakery with five spots offering brunch servings, while the cake selection is more limited. Both chains offers breakfast and various snack foods and they are open every day of the week.\n\nDrink\n\n[edit]\n\nAarhus has a lively nightlife, with everything from big mainstream clubs to small alternative hangouts playing niche music. Aarhus' young population fuels a major part of the partying, and the large numbers of students tend to keep prices reasonable. The legal age for buying alcohol in Denmark is 16 and 18 relative to the amount of alcohol present in a given drink, but some bars limit entry to those over 20 or even 23. In any case, it pays to have picture ID on you if you want to indulge in the bar scene. Prices are generally higher than in other parts of Europe, but cheaper than Copenhagen and with several budget options. Entry fees are almost non-existing. The action tends to concentrate around JÃ¦gergÃ¥rdsgade, Frederiksgade, Ã…boulevarden, Vestergade, the Latin Quarter, Mejlgade, NÃ¸rregade, and the riverside (Ã…en), the latter of which is the most expensive area.\n\nThe nightlife in Denmark and Aarhus is quite safe, though occasionally plagued with young immigrants (primarily of Middle Eastern descent) who harass people, sell drugs, and engage in vandalism. These incidents might be rarer these days, but if you are a group of young males with a Middle Eastern look, be aware that you could risk being denied access to some of the more popular spots. Drinking does not limit itself to the night (or the weekends) in Danish culture, so you will not have a problem finding a good place for a cold beer, a nice drink or a glass of wine in the afternoon or even in the morning.\n\nThe most widely available Danish beers are Tuborg, Carlsberg and Ceres. With a 150-year history in Aarhus, Ceres was by many considered the \"beer of Aarhus\", with Ceres TOP as the flagship pilsner, but the beer is not brewed locally anymore. Most places also serve other well-known international brands, mostly on draft. Quite a few spots specialize in quality beers and craft brews, and offer a large variety for the beer connoisseur. This trend seems to have spilled over and affected many of the regular places as well.\n\nCocktail bars are getting increasingly popular, with most places now offering some kind of mixed drink as an alternative to the omnipresent beer. Quality whiskey, rum and gin can be had in many bars. While in Danish culture wine is traditionally enjoyed with food rather than by itself, there are a few high-end wine bars that are very popular.\n\nMany Aarhus bars change concept and/or owners quite often, some every 2-3 years or so, while other spots close and new ones emerge. The listing below is therefore incomplete and may be out of date, though we've tried to limit it to places with proven staying power.\n\nFrederiksbjerg\n\n[edit]\n\nA neighbourhood with its own atmosphere, separated from the rest of the city centre by the central rail yard. Frederiksbjerg's nightlife scene is a mix of traditional bodegaer and vÃ¦rtshuse of the type you can read about below, as well as some newer and more fashionable spots.\n\nFrederiksgade\n\n[edit]\n\nThis partly pedestrianized street brims with nightlife.\n\nRiverside\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of the cafÃ©s near the mouth of the river turn into bars and nightclubs in the late evening, but there are also many places here dedicated exclusively to nightlife. One of the busiest bar scenes in the city, the riverside can be hectic Friday and Saturday nights, attracting many young people. The rest of the week, the promenades along the river offers a more laid-back vibe. Despite the many upscale and fashionable places, there are a surprisingly ample selection of budget-friendly options in between. The nightlife scene here starts off at Immervad, the small bridge crossing the canal at Frederiksgade, and stretches all the way to the mouth of the river at the harbourfront.\n\nSkolegade\n\n[edit]\n\nSkolegade is an old narrow sidestreet behind Ã…boulevarden with a long history as a nightlife destination. Most of the action is near the south end, closest to the riverside.\n\nLatin Quarter\n\n[edit]\n\nAs at the riverside, several of the Latin Quarter's cafÃ©s turn into festive bars in the evening, while other places serve as such all day.\n\nElsewhere\n\n[edit]\n\nBodegaer and vÃ¦rtshuse\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Denmark, a bodega is a traditional Danish pub or bar. The bodega has a long cultural history in Denmark and is conceptually somewhat similar to an English pub, but only a few places offer meals and live music. You could warm up at one before going to a concert or a fancy club, or you can drop in for a coffee or a beer in the afternoon. It should be fairly easy to find yourself engaged in a conversation at these places, as the majority of people are here to socialize and unwind.\n\nIn the older days, when alcohol was seen as a basic thirst-quencher for the working man, bars were much more abundant. These were watering holes with the sole purpose of serving cheap beers all day, every day. The Danish word for these basic bars is vÃ¦rtshus, which loosely translates as \"hosting-house\": in other words, a place that hosts people for drinking. Times have changed, but there are still some of these places left in Aarhus, many with their own peculiar charm. They are mostly frequented by regulars, but visiting strangers are welcomed too. The crowd at these places can be a lovely mix of joyful people at times, especially weekend nights.\n\nCeres TOP pilsner is the de rigueur beer in bodegaer and vÃ¦rtshuse, but other alcoholic beverages are usually available too, along with coffee and soft drinks. An \"Aarhus set\" consists of a Ceres TOP with a shot of Arnbitter on the side, both beverages from Aarhus. Shots of black liquorice-flavoured vodka, often referred to as Fisk, are popular with young people.\n\nIn popular usage, the terminology can be confusing: the words vÃ¦rtshus, bodega, and cafÃ© are nowadays often employed indiscriminately in business names, and in particular vÃ¦rtshus can be used for any kind of bar. To learn more about the true original vÃ¦rtshus concept â€” and to learn how to differentiate between the three categories yourself â€” you can start your field research at these spots:"
