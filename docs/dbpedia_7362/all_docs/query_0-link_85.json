        "meta_description": "Objectives It is unknown if prenatal exposure to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) increases the risk of low Apgar score in offspring.\n\nSetting Population-based study using health registers in Denmark.\n\nParticipants We identified all 677 021 singletons born in Denmark from 1997 to 2008 and linked the Apgar score from the Medical Birth Register with information on the women's prescriptions for AEDs during pregnancy from the Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics. We used the Danish National Hospital Registry to identify mothers diagnosed with epilepsy before birth of the child. Results were adjusted for smoking and maternal age.\n\nResults Among 2906 children exposed to AEDs, 55 (1.9%) were born with an Apgar score ≤7 as compared with 8797 (1.3%) children among 674 115 pregnancies unexposed to AEDs (adjusted relative risk (aRR)=1.41 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.85). When analyses were restricted to the 2215 children born of mothers with epilepsy, the aRR of having a low Apgar score associated with AED exposure was 1.34 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.01) When assessing individual AEDs, we found increased, unadjusted RR for exposure to carbamazepine (RR=1.86 (95% CI 1.01 to 3.42)), valproic acid (RR=1.85 (95% CI 1.04 to 3.30)) and topiramate (RR=2.97 (95% CI 1.26 to 7.01)) when compared to unexposed children.\n\nConclusions Prenatal exposure to AEDs was associated with increased risk of being born with a low Apgar score, but the absolute risk of a low Apgar score was <2%. Risk associated with individual AEDs indicate that the increased risk is not a class effect, but that there may be particularly high risks of a low Apgar score associated with certain AEDs.",

        "text": "Variables, data sources and measurement\n\nMedication exposure\n\nThe Danish Register of Medicinal Product Statistics holds information on all redeemed prescriptions since 1 January 1996. AEDs that are used solely in hospitals are not included in the register. We included information on all redeemed prescriptions from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2008. The exposure window was defined as 30 days before the estimated day of conception to the day prior to birth. AED exposure was defined as redemption of prescription for medicines with the Anatomical Therapeutic Codes (ATC code) N03A (AEDs) and N05BA09 (clobazam).\n\nPregnancies exposed to monotherapy were defined as pregnancies where the mothers had redeemed prescriptions for only one type of AED, while pregnancies exposed to polytherapy were defined as pregnancies of mothers who had redeemed prescriptions for more than one type of AED in the exposure window. For both monotherapy and polytherapy, the mothers may also have redeemed prescriptions for other types of medicine during pregnancy. The estimated average daily dose of AEDs was calculated from the total amount of AEDs redeemed during the time from 30 days before pregnancy until birth divided by the number of days in the same time period. On the basis of the defined daily dose (DDD),10 the estimated daily AED dose was dichotomised into high (>50% of DDD) and low (≤50% of DDD).\n\nEpilepsy and psychiatric disease\n\nThe Danish National Hospital Registry holds information on inpatients since 1977 and outpatients from 1995. From 1977 to 1993, diagnostic information in the Danish National Hospital Register was based on the International Classification of Diseases, 8th revision (ICD-8), and from 1994 to 2008 on ICD-10. ICD-9 has not been used in Denmark. We used this register to identify mothers diagnosed with epilepsy before birth of the child (ICD-8: 345 and ICD-10: G40 and G41).\n\nThe Danish Psychiatric Central Research Register was used to identify parents diagnosed with psychiatric disorders before birth of the child (ICD-8: 290–315 and ICD-10: F00.0-F99.9). We specifically looked at mothers with substance abuse (ICD-8: 291, 294.3, 303, 304 and ICD-10: F10-F19) and severe psychiatric disorders (ICD-8: 296.1–296.8, 298.1 and 295 and ICD-10: F30-F31 and F20).\n\nPregnancy outcomes\n\nThe Danish Medical Birth Registry contains data on newborn children including information on gestational age and Apgar score (0–10) at birth (5 min).\n\nMain results\n\nAfter adjustment for smoking and maternal age, children of women using AED during pregnancy (N=2906) had an adjusted RR of 1.41 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.85) of having a low Apgar at 5 min (≤7) when compared to children of women who did not use AEDs during pregnancy (table 2). We also estimated the risk of a low Apgar score with additional adjustment for gestational age and found an almost unchanged adjusted relative risk (aRR) of 1.38 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.82).\n\nWe analysed the adjusted OR (aOR) of being born with an Apgar score ≤7 (aOR=1.47 (95% CI 1.10 to 1.94)) and the aOR of being born with an Apgar score of 8–9 (aOR=1.59 (95% CI 1.49 to 1.81)) compared to being born with an Apgar score of 10 (see online supplementary etable 1).\n\nWhen stratified on the mothers’ epilepsy diagnosis prior to birth, the unadjusted RR of having a low Apgar score following AED exposure was increased by 34% in offspring of women with epilepsy (RR=1.34 (95% CI 0.90 to 2.01)) (table 3). There were too few cases to estimate the adjusted risk in offspring of mothers without an epilepsy diagnosis, but the unadjusted estimate was 77% increased (RR=1.77 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.88)) (table 3).\n\nWe found that the crude RRs were increased for all types of AEDs, although the estimates reached statistical significance only for use of carbamazepine, valproic acid and topiramate exposure (table 4 and figure 1). When we restricted the analyses to children exposed to monotherapy, there was no increased risk associated with lamotrigine exposure and only exposure to carbamazepine was significantly increased compared to unexposed children (see online supplementary etable 2 and efigure 1). Owing to a low number of exposed cases with a low Apgar score (<5), it was not possible to assess the risk associated with topiramate and oxcarbazepine monotherapy exposure in pregnancy.\n\nWe analysed the outcome after exposure to high and low doses of AEDs (monotherapy only). There were 1339 children exposed to high doses of AEDs among whom 19 (1.4%) had a low Apgar score, and 1164 children were exposed to low doses of AEDs among whom 25 (2.2%) had a low Apgar score. The unadjusted RR associated with high AED drug dose was 1.10 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.72) and the unadjusted RR associated with low AED dose was 1.68 (95% CI 1.14 to 2.48) when compared to unexposed children (comparison of RR for high dose with low dose; p=0.16).\n\nWe analysed the outcome after exposure to monotherapy and polytherapy of AEDs. There were 2459 children exposed to AED monotherapy among whom 44 (1.79%) had a low Apgar score, and 447 children were exposed to AED polytherapy of whom 11 (2.46%) had a low Apgar score. The aRR (adjusted for smoking and maternal age) associated with AED monotherapy was 1.36 (95% CI 1.01 to 1.85) and the aRR associated with AED polytherapy was 1.65 (95% CI 0.87 to 3.14) when compared to unexposed children (comparison of aRR for monotherapy with polytherapy; p=0.60).\n\nKey results\n\nAED exposure in pregnancy was associated with an elevated risk of being born with a low Apgar score (≤7), although the absolute risk was low (<2%).\n\nThere are only few studies of Apgar score at birth following exposure to AEDs in pregnancy. A multicentre study across 25 centres in the USA and the UK of the neurodevelopmental effects of antiepileptic drugs study found no difference in risk of low 5 min Apgar score when comparing the risk in offspring of women who used carbamazepine, lamotrigine, phenytoin and valproate.8 A Finnish register study found no risk of low 5 min. Apgar score associated with overall AED therapy in offspring of women with epilepsy,7 but a more than doubling of the risk associated with valproate exposure. We found increased risks of low Apgar score at 5 min. following carbamazepine, valproic acid and topiramate exposure, but the number of exposed cases was low.\n\nWe also found that AED exposure in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk for the less severe outcome (ie, Apgar score 8–9). An Apgar score of 8–9 has also been associated with adverse outcome in the affected children.6\n\nLimitations\n\nEven though we studied almost 3000 exposed pregnancies, only 2% of children exposed to AEDs were born with an Apgar score ≤7, and in a large number of analyses it was not possible to adjust the risk estimates for potential confounders. Therefore, unadjusted residual confounding may account for some of the risk associated with AED exposure.\n\nAdjusting for gestational age had almost no effect on the association between AED exposure in pregnancy and risk of low Apgar score in the offspring. AED exposure in pregnancy was not associated with preterm birth in a recent study from Denmark,11 and prior to study onset it was decided to focus on two well-established confounders, namely smoking in pregnancy and maternal age.12 ,13 In addition, low gestational age following AED exposure may lie on the causal pathway between AED exposure and low Apgar score and therefore should not necessarily be adjusted for.14\n\nThe Apgar score was registered at birth with some measurement error, and at that point of time, the use of AEDs in pregnancy would have been known. However, we have no reason to believe that allocation of a specific Apgar score was influenced by the knowledge of the AED exposure during pregnancy.\n\nThe study was based on redeemed prescriptions which for AEDs are a good estimator of compliance with AED use.15 However, the exposure window was based on the time point when the women redeemed a prescription and not on when they actually ingested the tablets; therefore, misclassification of timing of the exposure may have occurred. We therefore did not analyse the risk of low Apgar score by exposure trimester. Since the timing of exposure is not precise, it was not possible to discriminate between sequential monotherapy (ie, switching from one AED to another AED without overlap) and polytherapy (two AEDs taken concomitantly), and both groups were included as polytherapy. The children exposed to polytherapy may thus in reality have been exposed to sequential monotherapy, although switching between AEDs without overlap is probably not common.\n\nWe were unable to identify a difference in risk of low Apgar score between children exposed to high dose and low dose of AEDs in pregnancy.16 ,17 However, our estimate of drug dose is based on the reimbursement rate in pregnancy and thus is most likely an imprecise measure of drug dose in pregnancy. Given the low number of exposed cases within individual AEDs, it was not possible to compare high dose with low dose within individual AEDs.\n\nWe analysed all singletons born in Denmark, and loss to follow-up is very unlikely in this study."
