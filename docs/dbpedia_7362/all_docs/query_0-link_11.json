        "text": "How do you balance your family life with an academic career? Betina Elfving, Associate Professor at the Department of Clinical Medicine, has great experience in this area. Here are her 3 valuable tips: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Plan and organize I am very structured and have managed many things by planning ‚Äì especially at home. For example, meal plans and carpooling with other parents, so I only had to drive the kids to gymnastics once a month instead of every week. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Adapt and prioritize self-care I put aerobics and gymnastics on hold when the kids were little. There simply weren‚Äôt enough hours in the day for it. Instead, I started running, as it was easier to fit in. Once the pickup-drop-off phase was over, I joined a gym and went straight from work to exercise three days a week. It was wonderful to have time to do something for myself again. Now I row a sea kayak in Vejle Fjord. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build a support network I‚Äôve acted as a single parent for many periods. My husband is a fighter pilot and has been deployed to Afghanistan or stationed with the Air Force in the USA and the Netherlands several times. It was almost a given that the kids would get a fever the moment John boarded a plane. But I simply had to make it work. When my mother retired, she would sometimes stay with us for a week if I needed to conduct experiments in the lab. We also had a young girl employed during the peak years, and our neighbor has occasionally picked up the kids from daycare if I was stuck in traffic on the highway.\n\nClinical Professor returns to Aarhus University to strengthen cancer research We are excited to announce that Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly will join Aarhus University as a Clinical Professor at the Department of Clinical Medicine starting September 1, 2024. With a background in hematology Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly brings a wealth of expertise, particularly in the field hematologic cancer such as lymphoma. His work emphasizes the power of \"real world data\" to enhance patient outcomes by improving diagnosis, treatment, and side effect management. Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly took his medical degree at Aarhus University in 2007, and now, after significant contributions at Aalborg University and Aalborg University Hospital, he returns to lead groundbreaking research on hematology. His role will also include collaborations with Department of Hematology, Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA), and Department of Clinical Epidemiology (KEA). Join us in welcoming Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly back to Aarhus University where his work will undoubtedly contribute to better healthcare outcomes for patients. üì∏: Private.\n\nWe welcome 951 new students to Health. Head of Education Jeppe Norskov Stokholm is very positive about this year's admissions and is especially pleased that so many students have secured a place in their top-priority program. \"We at Health are very happy that, once again this year, we have full enrollment in all our programs and can offer a study place to so many new, talented, and dedicated young people who wish to study at Aarhus University. More than 95% have been admitted to the study program they most wanted to join, which provides a very good foundation for a successful student life with good results,\" says Jeppe Norskov Stokholm. More applicants than ever before have been offered a study place at Aarhus University. In total, 7,612 applicants have been offered a place at Aarhus University. This corresponds to an increase of 3% compared to last year.\n\nIs there such a thing as too much detail in a medical body scan? With today‚Äôs incredible advancements in PET/CT scanning technology, it is possible to create dynamic images of an entire human body and map organs in the smallest detail. However, the images produces contain more information than can be visually comprehended, and this problem is exactly what our newly appointed professor Ole Lajord Munk aims to solve. ‚ÄúWe are developing mathematical models and using AI to extract the important quantitative information from images that doctors need,\" says the new professor of medical physics. Ole Lajord Munk is already unlocking critical data about how diseases like cancer and diabetes alter our body's glucose uptake, which could ultimately lead to more precise diagnoses and better personalized treatments of a wide range of diseases. Aarhus Universitetshospital\n\nUncovering the hidden power dynamics of elite sport \"During my early studies, I became increasingly exposed to the challenges within international elite sport. This led me to question the practices, processes, and policies shaping the sport world today\". At Aarhus University, Associate Professor J√∂rg Krieger from the Department of Public Health delves into how historical power imbalance continue to influence the global sport system, with a particular focus on the Olympic Movement. His research critically examines the impact of these historical decisions on athletes, especially in areas such as racism, sexism, and anti-doping. In 2021, J√∂rg Krieger published \"Power and Politics in World Athletics: A Critical History\", offering a comprehensive look at global athletic governance, and his ongoing research continues to explore the relationship between sport and politics, including how national politics have influenced sport organizations across continents. Learn more about J√∂rg Krieger and his research at the Department of Public Health's website. üì∏: Simon Fischel, AU Health\n\nNew checklist aims to prevent side effects in patients with arthritis. Inappropriate prescription of an antirheumatic drug for an unsuitable patient can lead to severe side effects such as intestinal perforations, blood clots, heart failure, or liver damage. To address this issue, researchers from the Department of Biomedicine at Aarhus University and the Rheumatology Department at the University Clinic for Innovative Patient Pathways in Silkeborg have developed a comprehensive safety checklist for the newer medications used in treating rheumatic diseases. ‚ÄúWith the increasing number of medications on the market, it becomes more challenging for healthcare professionals to make prescriptions without risking serious side effects,‚Äù explains Associate Professor Tue Kragstrup, one of the researchers behind the study. Although the checklist is primarily intended for doctors prescribing medications to patients with rheumatic diseases, the study is also relevant to other doctors and patients. Dr. Lykke Skaarup, one of the researchers behind the data extraction in the study, explains. ‚ÄúThe principles behind the checklist can be applied across other disease areas because we have documented a method to systematically identify contraindications and precautions for a group of medications,‚Äù she says.\n\nHealth student takes home Olympic silver for Denmark ü•àüëè Congratulations to Anne-Marie Rindom, who just now won the silver medal in ILCA 6 dinghy. In her day-to-day, Anne-Marie is a dual career student at the Department of Public Health doing her master‚Äôs degree in sports science. We are extremely proud to be cheering her on for her fourth Olympics ‚Äì this time adding a silver medal to her collection comprising a bronze medal from Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and a gold medal from Tokyo in 2021. Anne-Marie is a great example of what you can achieve through the dual career programme ‚Äì combining academic achievement with a career in professional sports. üåä Screenshot from DR1 ‚Äì Danish Public Broadcasting\n\n‚ÄúAI should assist rather than replace clinicians‚Äù Those are the words of Associate Professor Ruben Pauwels from the Department of Dentistry and Oral Health. He is focused on how we use digital data and medical imaging in healthcare and his research aims to enhance clinical workflows and improve patient care by leveraging AI and optimizing imaging technologies. The associate professor began his journey into this field with his Master‚Äôs thesis in Biomedical Sciences, and his passion has only grown since. Today, he collaborates with dental subspecialists to enhance image processing, lesion detection, and bone quality assessment using deep learning. ‚ÄúMy long-term goal is to establish an enhanced clinical workflow, in which artificial intelligence does not take over for the clinical expert, but assists them in their work,‚Äù Ruben Pauwels states and elaborates: ‚ÄúThere is no specific point at which we can consider an AI-based model to be ‚Äòfinished‚Äô; there is always potential to improve its performance as more data and new deep learning methods become available. Thus, my secondary goal is to set up an infrastructure in which the ‚Äòcontinuing education‚Äô of AI models can be streamlined.‚Äù\n\nThis building could foster the next revolutionary life science company.

Mats Bue associate professor at our Department of Clinical Medicine is making significant strides in improving the prevention and treatment of bone and joint infections Bue's goal is to refine bone infection treatments, aiming to improve patient outcomes, enhance functional recovery, and reduce healthcare costs. To achieve this, he is working on several projects, including a novel antibiotic treatment with a uniquely long half-life that could potentially revolutionize treatment for orthopedic staphylococcal infections. As co-founder of the Aarhus Denmark Microdialysis Research Group (ADMIRE), Bue has pioneered models for microdialysis sampling in bone and soft tissues, crucial for understanding antibiotic penetration. His research reveals that bone tissue's complexity and heterogeneity affect antibiotic behavior and that administration methods significantly impact therapeutic outcomes. As Mats Bue puts it: ‚ÄúOur research findings have resulted in new antibiotic dosing regimens and greater awareness of when, how and how much antibiotics we administer to orthopaedic patients.‚Äù"
