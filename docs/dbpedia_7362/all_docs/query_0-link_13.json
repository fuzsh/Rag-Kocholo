        "text": "Quality and durability\n\nChresten Findahl Brodersen founded Findahl mobelfabrik in 1946 in the town of Skarrbaek. Findahl produced throughout it's history literally tsunami's of dining chairs such as the Mosbøl chair (over one 1 million). In the early 50s Findahl started to produce sofa's and lounge chairs. Even though these designs were very recognizable and well crafted they and their designer never got the high design status. Something that is actually quite remarkable given the lines and aesthetically pleasing curvature that was worked into these pieces. Furthermore quite remarkable as this all happened years before the successes in sofa and chair design by the likes of Andersen, Vodder en Wikkelso.\n\nIt is therefor that we would like to credit Chresten Findahl Brodersen as one of the remarkable designers between WWII and Hay days of Danish mid century design.\n\nUpon Chresten Findahl's illness in 1980, the leadership of the factory is handed over to his son Orla Findahl. Around 30 years later a factory fire destroys most of the factory and a renewed furniture factory rizes from its ashes focussing on sustainable designs and operation. Orla Findahl remains as excecutive of Findahls untill December of 2018. In that year Findahls is purchased by Hammel Furniture A/S that continue to produce the Findahl designs.\n\nFrom > Skaerbaek - untill now\n\nBackground > Solid Danish craftmenship and focus on quality and durability\n\nArchitecture & design studio > Chresten Findahl Brodersen\n\nSignature > Mosbøl chair\n\nCheck it out!

Most probably his passion was not with steel and not much later he changed his material of choice to become wood and went on designing for E. Knudsen Studio (Tegnestue) in Odense. In 1947 he starts his own furniture design studio and made designs that are known all over the world. His work is exhibited in among other places the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nØstervig signature piece is the free standing shelves and chests unit that he designed for KP Møbler. These come with organically shaped legs and bronze tubing to uphold the bottom chest or shelf. In addition to these his designs as freelance designer for Bramin (chairs), Sibast (chairs), Pedersen & Søn, Rollschau (lounge chairs) are still very popular!\n\nFrom > 1912-1986, Odense\n\nBackground > Shipbuilding and design\n\nEducation > Ship architecture and furniture design\n\nArchitecture & design studio > E.

The designs made by Omann Jun Møbelfabrik have been designed by the Omann family that worked the factory. The exact role and responsibility of Gunni Omann has been a bit vague. Often he is even referred to as not having a part in the design process, ever so often he is. We took the position to call whoever was designing at Omann Jun, Gunni Omann and that be it. Gunni Omann designed not only for Omann Jun Møbelfabrik he also designed for Axel Christiansen Odder/ ACO Møbler.\n\nOmann Jun is famous for its famously styled credenzas. Renowned for Omann, and recognizable from a distance, are the signature grip designs. These grips come in a fantastic aerodynamic space ship shape. Furthermore, furniture with the Omann label have been made in a high quality mostly with rosewood and qualtity teak and compete in the premier league of Danish mid-century modern design. To name a couple key pieces, the credenza number 18 and 19 are true gems to the eye. Credenza 18 is since 2016 re-made by Omann in Horsens and still enormously popular.\n\nFrom > Horsens Denmark\n\nBackground > Founded in 1933 by Andreas Omann\n\nMasterpiece > Credenza no. 18\n\nSignature > Aerodynamic grips\n\nManufacturer > Omann Jun\n\nCheck it out! GunniOmann @ Furnip\n\nSpace age crazyness\n\nVerner Panton is without question one of Denmark's most influential 20th-century furniture and interior designers. During his career, he brought to life innovative and futuristic designs in a variety of materials, especially plastics, and in vibrant and exotic colors. His style was very ‘1960s’ but that style revived into fashion late 20th century. Several furniture makers like Vitra still produce Panton's most well-known furniture models.\n\nPanton studied architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen, graduating in 1951. During the first two years of his career, 1950–1952, he worked at the architectural practice of Arne Jacobsen. Panton shortly thereafter started his own design and architectural office. He became well known for his innovative architectural proposals, including a Collapsible House (1955), the Cardboard House and the Plastic House (1960). Near the end of the 50s, his chair designs became much more unconventional, with no legs or discernible back. In 1960 Panton was the designer of the very first single-form injection-moulded plastic chair. This Stacking chair or S chair, became his most famous and mass-produced design resulting organic shapes inspired by the human body requirements, the tongue. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Verner Panton experimented with designing entire environments: radical and psychedelic interiors that were an ensemble of his curved furniture (ao Fritz Hansen), wall upholstering, textiles and lighting (Louis Poulsen).\n\nFrom > Copenhagen, 1926-1998\n\nEducation > Architecture at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in Copenhagen\n\nArchitecture & design studio > Vernet had his own studio from 1954\n\nMasterpieces > Cone Chair (1958), The Panton Chair (1960), Peacock Chair, Verner Panton S-chair model 275 Thonet, Bayer exposition ships Visiona O + II Köln (1968-1970), Spiegel Canteen Hamburg (1969)\n\nManufacturer > Among others Vitra, Fritz Hansen and Louis Poulsen\n\nCheck it out! VernerPanton @ Furnip\n\n'Systematic'\n\nPoul Cadovius is a designer and furniture producer, he was born in 1911 in Denmark. Originally trained as a saddler and upholster, Cadovius became interested in industrial design and particularly in modular wall systems. His purpose was to create pieces of furniture which could be adaptable to all kind of different interiors. So he designed many modular system collections whose number of combinations is impressive. In 1948, he created one of his most remarkable and mythic piece: the Royal System. These modular shelves are still considered as a reference by the world of design.\n\nFrom > 1911 -2011, Frederiksberg\n\nBackground > Upholsterer, designer and cabinet maker\n\nSignature > His minimalistic aesthetic is considered a perfect harmony between form and function—industrial and organic, affordable and elegant. Although the Royal System shelving unit was his main contribution to Danish modernism, Cadovius registered more than 400 patents throughout his long career, leaving behind a legacy that inspired many future designers. He bought the France & Søn Company, he designed many pieces for this firm with other designers. He introduced his functional approach by creating flat-pack furniture, which made France & Søn grow very fast, because there main market was in the USA. Thanks to his innovative approach of modular shelves and flat-pack furniture, Cadovius is considered as one of the greatest designers of the 20th Century.\n\nManufacturer > Mid 60s, Cadovius purchased the well-established furniture manufacturer France & Søn -credited with the industrialization of teak furniture production- and eventually renamed the company CADO.\n\nMasterpieces > The iconic shelving system Royal system was designed in 1948 by Poul Cadovius, and has been one of the greatest Danish furniture successes in history. It was one of the world's first wall-mounted furniture systems, and the idea behind the design was innovative. Poul Cadovius saw a challenge in the heavy, space-stealing traditional furniture, which occupied too much floor space. With the introduction of the new wall-mounted shelving concept, the furniture was simply moved off the floor onto the walls, leaving more space in the room - as Poul Cadovius expressed it himself: \"Most of us live on the bottom of a cube. If we put the walls even with the floor, we get a lot of space to live on”.\n\nPrices > The Royal System (1948) shelving unit went on to win the gold medal at the Finland Furniture Fair in 1950 and silver medal at the XI Triennale di Milano 1957.\n\nCheck it out! PoulCadovius@ FurnipCadovius@ Furnip\n\nA chair is to have no backside. It should be beautiful from all sides and angles.”\n\nPursuit to create the perfect chair\n\nHans Jørgen Wegner was without question truly one of the Greats of Danish furniture design. Recognized by many as one of the most innovative furniture designers and in particular Hans J. Wegner was the indisputable grandmaster of Danish chair design. Throughout a long and productive life Wegner designed roughly 500 different chair designs, many of which have become popular classics and are still in production today.\n\nKnown for ‘The chair’\n\nOne of Wegner’s signature pieces was used by Nixon and Kennedy in a 1960 televised debate and is now simply known as 'The chair'!\n\nWegner’s background as a cabinetmaker gave him a deep understanding of how to integrate exacting joinery techniques with exquisite form. His aesthetic was also based on a deep respect for wood and its characteristics, and a vast curiosity about other natural materials that enabled him to bring an organic, natural softness to formalistic minimalism.\n\nFrom > 1914 - 2007, Tønder\n\nBackground > Cabinet maker and Furniture design\n\nEducation > Danish School of Arts and Crafts, 1936 - 1940, he became a teacher here later on in his career.\n\nStart > In 1938, Wegner was approached by architects and designers Arne Jacobsen and Erik Møller, and started designing furniture for the new Aarhus City Hall.\n\nArchitecture & design studio > In 1938 Wegner opens his own design studio, in 1992 he retires and his daughter takes over.\n\nSignature > The fact that Wegner was a cabinetmaker first and a designer second makes him a unique furniture designer. A master of detail who flawlessly merges craftsmanship with exquisite design. Wegner insisted on the highest standard of craftsmanship for his furniture, and his chairs often feature traditional mortise and tenon joints and unique materials such as paper cord.\n\nManufacturer > Hans J. Wegner made designs for FDB Møbler, PP Møbler, Carl Hansen & Son, master cabinetmaker Johannes Hansen.\n\nMasterpieces > Peacock chair, the Round chair (1949), the Wing chair (1949) and the Y-chair: the CH24 was one of Wegners first designs for Carl Hansen & Son. Known as the Wishbone chair, it has been in continuous production since its introduction.\n\nAwards > Lunning Price in 1951, the grand prix of the Milan Triennale in 1951 and the Danish furniture price in 1980. Almost all of the world's major design museums exhibit his works.\n\nHansJWegner @ Furnip\n\ngorgeous lights!\n\nSven Middelboe was a Danish designer. In times when lighting became a signature feature for interior design he was chief of design in the lighting fixtures business of Nordisk Solar Compagni. Nordisk Solar, founded by Jacob L. Jørgensen was a manufacturing company surfing the electrification wave since 1919 making electricity metering devices and fittings. Much later it merged and acquired it's way into Solar and even later into Jakobsson after the take over of Swedish Hans-Agne Jakobsson. Early 80s it moved all activities to Sweden.\n\nThere is very little information to find about Sven Middelboe but we do know he created some stunning lighting fixture designs like the Verona and the Barcelona from the 60s and 70s.\n\nFrom > 1910 -\n\nSignature > Verona lamp\n\nManufacturer > Nordisk Solar Compagni\n\nCheck it out!

Stamped “Løvig” or “Hedensted Møbelfabrik” for the Danish village in which they were produced, as well as the year of production, Løvig Nielsen’s beautifully crafted designs are experiencing a vintage revival.\n\nFrom > Denmark\n\nFurniture focus > Wooden desks, tables and storage units.\n\nSignature > Løvig Nielsen favored high-quality and beautifully grained woods such as rosewood and walnut, and his designs often featured tapered legs and organic curved edges.\n\nManufacturer > Stamped “Løvig” or “Hedensted Møbelfabrik” for the Danish village in which they were produced, as well as the year of production.\n\nMasterpiece > The ‘Boomerang Desk’ (1956) which features an L-shaped table top on V-shaped legs with subtle brass detailing.\n\nCheck it out! Peter Lovig Nielsen @ Furnip\n\nDining chair galore!\n\nNiels Otto Møller founded the JL Møllers Møbelfabrik in 1944. At the time it was a small woodworking studio in his home town, focussing on producing traditional furniture. Møller also invested time in creating newer modern designs of which the No.1 Chair (1946) was the first. For the remainder of his life Møller would produce only his own designs.\n\nIn the early fifties he produced some of his most widely known designs, the No. 71 and No. 78 chairs. These chairs strongly represent, through the choice of materials and the soft curves, the Scandinavian mid century modern vision of practical yet well-made design.\n\nEarly fifties JL Møllers Møbelfabrik expanded into exporting to Germany, Japan and the United States. To accomodate the growth a new factory was build on a plot of land purchased in 1961 in the town of Højbjerg, not far from his home town. In this new factory an impressive array of high end designs from Niels Otto Møller were made and it estabilished the brand JL Møller as a label of well made Danish design. In the year after his death in 1982 and to this day his sons, Jorgen Henrik Møller and Jens Ole Møller have continued the privately ownded family company.\n\nFrom > Århus, 1920 - 1982\n\nEducation > In 1939 Møller completed the cabinet maker education and followed through with enrolling in Århus School of Design which he completed in 1942\n\nArchitecture en designstudio > In 1944 Niels O.

NielsOMøller @ Furnip\n\nThe Bronze Era that’s where it started\n\nPoul Hundevad succes started in the bronze age when the original Guldhøj chair was made. This chair, a foldable footstall really, was found in a burial mound in Hundevad's birthplace Vamdrup. Hundevad decided to remake the bronze age chair with some small alterations in his own furniture studio. He sided for different wood types such as oak, teak, wenge and rosewood and finished it much like the original with leather upholstery. It was a great su cces and Hundevad sold and sells the remakes all over the world.\n\nHundevad was in addition to a skillful carpenter also a designer with talent. Many designs, such as dining chairs, credenzas, tables, serving carts, book shelves and cabinets can be attributed to his name. Examples include the 1950 square dining table designed with Kai Winding, and model 30 a round dining table with chairs in 1958. His Egyptian Chair from 1950 has been described as a flowing unity of separate parts, a tell tale for early Danish furniture making.\n\nIt is obvious that the period he was active in, was the timeline epicenter of Danish modern design. Hundevad certainly has adapted bits and pieces from his contemporary designer colleagues, like working functionality and flexibility of use into his designs. The latter being very fashionable in Danish furniture making at the time. Poul Hundevad, if we can summarize him in one centence was an old skool Danish furniture maker and designer that put craftmanship first! This allowed him to work the fashions of his time, into beautifully made thoroughly modern designs.\n\nFrom > 1917 - 2011, Vamdrup Denmark\n\nBackground > Carpenter\n\nDesignstudio > Designstudio and production form the early fifties in Vamdrup\n\nSignature > Functionality and durability, preference for rosewood and teak.

PoulHundevad @ Furnip\n\nHome grown Dutch design!\n\nWébé became one of Holland's biggest furniture producing companies. Much of this succesful growth can be attributed to Dutch designer Aloysius (Louis) Allegonda Petrus van Teeffelen who became head of design for Wébé in 1955. Van Teeffelen designs are quite commonly found in todays Dutch livingrooms. Van Teeffelen was to leave the company in 1967 and turned out to be the only succesful designer to work for Wébé. Many of his designs can be aligned to the Danish mid-century modern style, but with some fairly unique construction style. With the Pelican easy chair (1960's) he reached the highest design level in Holland. Other striking examples of his design skill were the Wébé Cowhorn Chair (1950's), Scissor Chair (1950's), Easy Chair (1960) and a range of tables and modular storage furniture. Van Teeffelen's designs are considered to be exemplary for the mid-century modern movement and highly coveted by collectors today. So get your own home grown dutchie if you can!\n\nFrom > Holland, 1921-1972\n\nSignature > Use of curved solid teak, characteristic contruction methods and many of his designs aligned perfectly to the Danish mid-century modern style.\n\nInfluencer > Louis van Teeffelen designs show some course similarities with designs made by the Danish Poul Cadovius (1911-2011)\n\nBrands > Wébé and suspected by many that van Teeffelen designed also for Topform.\n\nMasterpiece > The Pelican Fauteuil (1960's), with his signature style beautiful scissor like legs are shaped to resemble the legs of a pelican, with the armrests resembling the beak of the creature, a true Dutch design classic.

LouisvanTeeffelen @ Furnip\n\nRe-present time\n\nKai Kristiansen designs are iconic for the mid-century modern era and Danish design in particular. Kristiansen is known for his exquisite craftmanship and innovative and human centric designs. He is commonly viewed as one of the most talented Scandinavian designers of the 20th century. Many of his superb designs include a very broad array of furniture items such as multifunctional desks, tables, chairs, credenzas, dressoirs, cabinets and the like. Most pronounced design of Kai Kristiansen is the dining-Z-chair, model #42. Kai Kristiansen designs were refined and difficult to construe.

Andersen definately used the wave of consumption growth of the fifties and sixties. He focussed largely on seating items such as chairs and sofa's but also on tables, all of these in most cases made from teak and rosewood. Our humble opinion that particularly his designs for CF Christensen (CFC Silkeborg) are truly recognisable Andersen designs. Examples of this are the Smile table and the facetted coffee table.\n\nMuch coveted by collectors that pay top dollar for his designs, Andersen catered to the likes of many mainly because of the rich quality and visually pleasing design elements.\n\nFrom > 1903 - 1991, Aarhus\n\nBackground > Trained cabinet maker 1920 - 1922\n\nDesignstudio > Johannes Andersen opened his own design studio in the mid 30s and designed for many Scandinavian furniture makers.Signature > The Scandinavian style was well known for distinctive shaping, elegant lining and cool looks.

JohannesAndersen @ Furnip\n\nLong Lasting L1\n\nJacob (Jac) Jacobsen was a textile engineer by training. He started his own textile machinery import business in 1934. This start up later grew into a multinational enterprise named Luxo and was to focus on lighting only. This later focus was predominantly due to the Luxo L-1!\n\nWhat is the story behind Luxo L-1?\n\nIn 1936 Jacobsen received in a shipment of British sewing machines two crane like balanced lighting armatures. Through his general interest for mechanics he was fascinated by these, what were Anglepoise lamps by George Carwadine. Jac reached out to Carwadine and enquired to become distributor for the lamps in Norway. Carwadine accepted the offer on the premisses that Jacobsen purchased 500 lamps and would seek product design approval from the Norwegian product safety board Nemko. Although the original Anglepoise design was well thought through, the design had to be adjusted to attain Nemko approval. Jacobsen designed a modified lamp inspired by the anglepoise with a balancing system based on rods and springs resembling human limbs and called it Luxo L-1, Latin for ‘I give light'.\n\nThe L-1 soon became popular to aid any desk activities in schools offices industry and healthcare. Over 70 years later the original version of the L-1 is still in production and has sold over 25 million copies worldwide!\n\nIn 1998 Luxo got listed on the Oslo stock exchange with the Jacobsen family as majority stakeholder. At the age of 95 Jac Jacobsen was still active in the Luxo company, he died that year in 1996 leaving behind a great lighting company.\n\nFrom > 1901 - 1996, Norway\n\nBackground > Engineer, businessman, industrial and designer\n\nDesign studio & Manufacturer > Jacobsen founded the Norwegian industrial group Luxo\n\nAwards > The Luxo L-1 won several Norwegian design awards between 1958 and 1972 and was also awarded the Classic Award for Design Excellence by the Norwegian Design Council in 1993\n\nMasterpiece > The Luxo L-1 went into production in 1938. Characteristic: high functionality and timeless beauty. The Luxo-1 belongs to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nCheck it out!

He also produced for Dutch furniture firm Bovenkamp in the sixties and cooperated with Royal Copenhagen who provided for handpainted ceramic tiles in a range of rosewood coffee tables.\n\nSeverin Hansen Jr. was in his sixties, we're talking the early 50's, when he aligned with Haslev Møbelsnedskeri for whom he also designed a line of cabinets and truly beautiful tripod lamps out of solid teak. These teak lamp stands in good condition are truly much sought after. Apart from the above not much is known about Severin's life and ways. Either way, this does not make his designs less desired by interior designers or collectors. His clear cut lines and the way connections are crafted with 45 degree angles on his tables, stand out and are true signatures for Severin's designs.

Swivel chairs or revolving chairs furbished in leather with a cast aluminum or chromed metal base.\n\nThe Skjold Sørensen factory resided in Ansager Denmark on a stone's throw away from LEGO land in Billund. In the sixties the factory is steadily producing his and other's designs but they hit the jackpot when Sørensen designs and produces swivel chairs with a ludicrous headrest in the seventies. The suspended headrests allow for many to see a resemblance with Wegner's ox chair and is an instant succes.\n\nAlso without the huge headrest the chair is sold heavily and can be frequently seen around. Skjold Sørensen chairs are highly fashionable and much desired pieces because of the sturdy character and bombastic looks.\n\nFrom > Denmark, AnsagerArchitecture & design studio > Skjold Sørensen signature > Seating, leather upholstery, metal base\n\nManufacturer > Skjold Sørensen, but he also produced for other Danish designers\n\nCheck it out!

Illum Wikkelsø designed for the Niels Eilersen factory where he made his most well know designs. Illum designed in a remarkably short space of time an array of variations on sofa and easy chair designs, that seem inspired by Finn Juhl because of their organically twisting and shaped arm rests and the like. In the years leading up to this, Eilersen embraced and pioneered the steam bending technology for solid wood and made it to be, not only a prominent technique but also the signature for the Eilersen factory. Mid sixties Wikkelsø (inspired undoubtedly by Wegner’s The chair designed the back and arm rests in one piece of steam bend solid wood.

Jo Hammerborg thought up these UFO like pendant lamps, to let the light escape the lamp housing in the best possible way. Good to know that these UFO designs also look great. A sign of the times for the sixties and seventies. Ridiculously popular at the time and still today. Hammerborg started under the realm of Georg Jensen after graduating from the Royal Danish Academy of fine arts. Eventually he is hired by Fog & Morup in 1957 and transforms the at that time slate company to become a design leader and commercial succes. A true vintage classic is the Nova lamp, a three layered UFO by Jo Hammerborg and Fog & Morup. So, don’t phone home, but call us at Furnip if you want one!\n\nFrom > 1920 - 1982 (skydiving accident), Randers, Denemarken\n\nBackground > Silversmith, a clear differentiation from other Danish luminair designers, most of whom have a architectural background\n\nEducation > Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen\n\nDesign studio > With Fog & Mørup in 1957, he left the company in 1980 to start his own studio. Fog & Mørup trended downwards from the day he left.\n\nSignature > Hammerborg’s silversmith skillset radiates from every lamp he designed through the use of UFO like shapes and organic curves. Attention to detail, the use of high quality materials and finishes and a trim down on visibility of functional elements like switches and joints make his designs. As an example his designs are based on simple shapes, made from cylindrical tapes in some cases, and those basic design elements were used in subsequent designs. Hammerborg also proliferated the material use concept as seen in wooden furniture into his lamp designs, often three or more material versions were launched of his luminaires.\n\nManufacturer > Fog & Morup, Holmegaard glassworks\n\nMasterpieces > NOVA lamp\n\nAwards > Hammerborg’s lightning designs for Fog & Mørup won numerous prizes, among them a Buenos Aires Centro Investigacion de Diseno Industrial first prize in 1965 for the Nova and six iF International Forum Product Design Awards in 1969 and 1970 for the Classic, Tunika, Saturn, Diskos, and Hydras I and II\n\nCheck it out!

We do however judge that Johannes must have had a fetish for books judging from his impressive line of book cupboards, shelves and desk/shelves/secretary combination designs. Johannes Sorth owned Bornholm's Møblerfabrik and produced most of his own designs. Through focussing on the production of combination furniture he clearly aimed for growth through the urbanisation of Denmark in the sixties and seventies. These days one can imagine these space saving designs are quite popular in urban Asia and our own major cities.

JohannesSorth @ Furnip\n\nSwedish knock-down!\n\nSwedish national Folke Ohlsson was a popular designer throughout the fifties and sixties. His designs combine simplicity with more traditional elegant features laid on top of typical sixties designs. His designs are often credited as ‘Scandinavian Modern’ however also now and then referred to as ‘Danish Modern’.\n\nHe moved to San Francisco in 1953 to found his furniture company DUX Inc. Ohlsson there made the first serious commercial strides happen for knock-down furniture concepts. Knock-down furniture referring to items that are shipped in pieces and assembled by the customer. The concept optimized shipping costs and is nowadays run to perfection by those other Swedes, IKEA ;-)\n\nOhlsson was a highly coveted designer receiving a staggering 30 design awards in his days. His time independent designs are then understandably also heavily copied throughout the world. Ohlsson has clearly put Scandinavian furniture design on the map in the USA and for this he received in 1964 the Royal Order of Vasa-decoration of King Gustav VI Adolf from Sweden.\n\nFrom > 1919 - 2003, Sweden\n\nArchitecture & design studio > Dux inc.\n\nSignature >Traditional details combined with the simplicity and proportions of contemporary style in the 60's\n\nManufacturer > Dux inc and Fritz HansenMasterpiece > Scissor chair\n\nCheck it out!

Quite a good move by the farmer’s family, as their son grew into a succesful mid-range designer with sizeable success in Denmark. Furthermore, much of his designs were exported to the US in the sixties!\n\nAfter his study furniture design and placements with Mogens Kold and Bramin Møbelfabrik, Arne started his own furniture workshop to make his own designs. It was 1970 when he was forced to close his studio due to health issues.\n\nOne of his in our opinion better designs is the easy chair he designed for Bramin in the fifties. Also the Scissor chair for Mogens Kold is a design with character. These particular chairs inspired de Dutch Louis van Teeffelen to craft his similar Pelican chair for Wébé.\n\nFrom > 1919 - 1989, Kirkeby Sogn in Denmark\n\nBackground > Internship at P.

ArneHovmandOlsen @ Furnip\n\nIndustrial simplicity serving no one but mankind!\n\nBørge Mogensen was a true pioneer. His ambition was to create sustainable and user centric furniture to enrich the life of it's user. Furniture made with simple and fashion free aesthetics freed from any thrills.\n\nMogensen completed his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1942, where Klaare Klint was one of his tutors. Soon after he took office as chief design of FDB møbler (Fredericia). He engaged on an ambitious endeavour to renew Danish furniture making. This would lead eventually to the creation of modernistic highly functional furniture that anyone could afford.\n\nIn 1950 Mogensen started his own design studio and soon thereafter lined up with a young interior architect and entrepeneur named Andreas Graversen. Several years later Graversen became the owner of FDB Møbler. Their cooperation yielded many famous designs right until the late sixties. One of which was the hunting chair.\n\nBørge firmly believed that furniture had to create tranquility, not unrest. In addition, he was loved for his material use, working with solid oak, natural leather, wool and brass. Mogensen had the ability to create unique and distinct furniture with adjusting simple lining and accentuation of surfaces. Always with the intention to craft something that was easy to the eye and fit to mass produce.\n\n“My goal is to create things that will serve man and give him the lead role, instead of, by the force of the devil adapt man to the things.”\n\nIn 1971 Børge and Andreas were rewarded with the Danish Furnituremakers Award for their contribution to the Danish furniture industry. Later, in 1972, Mogensen was appointed Honoury Royal Designer for Industry at the Royal Society of Arts in London. Examples of Mogensen's fine designs are on display in almost all self respecting design musea across the globe.

BørgeMogensen @ Furnip\n\nDesigner ahead of his time!\n\nEjvind Johansson is also referred to as the most famous unknown designer, not a very coveted title actually. If we have to guess much of this image has been caused because he was ahead of his time. Johansson was well know for his unorthodox style. Often mixing classical English and Scandinavian styles with modernistic simplistic shaping and through that created timeless pieces of furniture. To this day these are highly popular across the globe.\n\nIn 1956 he became head of design at FDB (Fredericia), where he filled the seat that Børge Mogensen left behind and Poul M. Volther before him. And although he fitted well with the movement at FDB, his style was slightly different. This particularly shows in the J67 chair. The chair base and the seat are FDB in every way, however the back of the chair is complex, organic and individualistic. He left FDB in 1958 to move on to design for Ivan Gern. It was for Gern that his most well known designs were made among which the Eye chair #84.\n\nFrom > 1923 - 2002, Denmark\n\nEducation > Apprenticeship as a carpenter, College of Arts and Crafts in Copenhagen 1942 -1946\n\nSignature > Unconventional designs, combinations and construction methods\n\nBrands > Ivan Gern, Federica Stolefabrik (FDB)\n\nMasterpiece > J67 and the Eye chair #84 for Gern\n\nCheck it out!

Schooled as a linguist and mathematician he gained a number of degrees throughout his life as to be expected had many interests and talents. It was while serving in the navy he grew into carpentry. In 1949 he moved to Denmark to study at the prestigious Frederikberg Tekniske Skole, where he was taught by prominent Danish architect and interior designer, Finn Juhl.\n\nAfter finishing school in 1952, Klein returned to Norway to establish his own furniture design studio. In that Norwegian period his designs however are clearly Danish mid century modern in style with recognizable use of fine woods like teak and well proportioned, well crafted forms. Later on, he became interested in using plastic to craft furniture. He invented new manufacturing methods using plastics and in parallel worked closely with Danish manufacturer Bramin in order to finance his plastic endeavours. Eventually he sold off his intellectual property on the plastics conversion methods to Bramin and Fritz Hansen. In 1960, Klein and his family moved to Denmark which allowed him to work full time at Bramin. He remained with the company until it closed in 1980.\n\nFrom > 1919, Norway\n\nBackground > Linguist and mathematicianMaster > Finn Juhll\n\nArchitecture & design studio > Founded his own design studio in Norway in 1952, but moved to Denmark in 1960 to work full time at Bramin\n\nSignature > Use of fine woods like teak and well proportioned, well crafted forms\n\nManufacturer > Bramin and Fritz Hansen\n\nCheck it out!
