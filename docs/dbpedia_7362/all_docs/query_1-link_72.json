The diagnostic processes were similar between studies, and the final diagnosis is a best-estimate consensus lifetime diagnosis based on multiple sources of information such as clinical evaluation by research psychiatrists, different types of semi-structured interviews made by trained research nurses and research psychiatrists, medical records, course of the disease and data from multiple informants. Diagnosis was made in accordance with the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Version IV (DSM-IV) or International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) criteria. Controls were recruited from the Betula study, an ongoing longitudinal, prospective, population-based study from the same geographic area (North Sweden) that is studying aging, health, and cognition in adults. All subjects (cases and controls) participated after giving written informed consent and the regional Ethical Review Board at the University of Umeå approved all original studies and participation in the PGC. GWAS genotyping was performed at Broad Institute.\n\nAndreassen, O | 19571808 | Norway (TOP) | scz_top8_eur\n\nIn the TOP study (Tematisk omrade psykoser), cases of European ancestry, born in Norway, were recruited from psychiatric hospitals in the Oslo region. Patients were diagnosed according to SCID and further ascertainment details have been reported. Healthy control subjects were randomly selected from statistical records of persons from the same catchment area as the patient groups. All participants provided written informed consent and the human subjects protocol was approved by the Norwegian Scientific-Ethical Committee and the Norwegian Data Protection Agency.\n\nBlackwood, D | 19571811 | Edinburgh, UK | scz_edin_eur\n\nCases and controls were recruited from the southeast of Scotland, and ascertainment has been previously described as part of the International Schizophrenia Consortium studies.

DNA samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute.\n\nBørglum, A | 19571808 | Denmark | scz_aarh_eur\n\nDNA samples for all subjects were collected from blood spots systematically collected by the Danish Newborn Screening Biobank), with case/control status established using the Danish Psychiatric Central Register. Cases were diagnosed clinically according to ICD-10 criteria. Controls were selected to match the cases by birth cohort. The Danish Data Protection Agency and the ethics committees in Denmark approved the human subjects protocol.\n\nBramon | 23871474 | Seven countries (PEIC, WTCCC2) | scz_pewb_eur\n\nBramon | 23871474 | Spain (PEIC, WTCCC2) | scz_pewb_eur\n\nThe Psychosis Endophenotypes International Consortium (PEIC) was part of WTCCC2. Samples were collected through seven centers in Europe and Australia (the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, London; GROUP (consisting of the University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam; the University of Groningen, Groningen; Maastricht University Medical Centre, Maastricht; and the University of Utrecht, Utrecht); the University of Western Australia, Perth; the Universidad de Cantabria, Santander; the University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh; Heidelberg University, Heidelberg and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Munich). To allow for a DSM-IV diagnosis to be ascertained or ruled out, all participants (including controls and unaffected family members) underwent a structured clinical interview with the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (SADS), the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders (SCID), or the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). We included cases with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Participants in all groups were excluded if they had a history of neurological disease or head injury resulting in loss of consciousness.\n\nBuxbaum, J | 20489179 | New York, US & Israel | scz_msaf_eur\n\nSamples contributed by Mount Sinai were derived from three cohorts. In all cohorts, ethical approval was obtained from all participating sites, and all subjects provided informed consent. Two of the cohorts were in a prior paper on copy number variation. One of the cohorts was from the Mount Sinai brain bank, where DNA was extracted from postmortem samples, and another comprised of patients ascertained in Israel. The third cohort included subjects more recently recruited through the Mount Sinai Conte Center.\n\nCorvin, A | 19571811 | Ireland | scz_dubl_eur\n\nThe case sample was collected primarily in the Dublin area and the ascertainment procedure has been previously described. The controls were recruited, from the same region through the Irish Blood Transfusion Services. All participants gave written, informed consent and the collections were approved through the Federated Dublin Hospitals and Irish Blood Transfusion Services Research Ethics Committees, respectively. DNA samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute.\n\nCorvin, A; Riley, B | 22883433 | Ireland (WTCCC2) | scz_irwt_eur\n\nThe case sample was recruited from the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. All cases had four Irish grandparents and ascertainment details have been reported elsewhere. Ethics approval was obtained from all participating hospitals and centers. Controls were blood donors from the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, whose Ethics Committee approved the human subjects protocol. All participants gave written informed consent. Samples were genotyped at Affymetrix (Santa Clara, California, US) laboratory as part of the WTCCC2 genotyping pipeline.\n\nEhrenreich, H | 20819981 | Germany (GRAS) | scz_gras\n\nThe Gottingen Research Association for Schizophrenia (GRAS) collection included cases recruited across 23 German hospitals. Controls were unscreened blood donors recruited at the Georg-August-University according to national blood donation guidelines. Cases completed a structured clinical interview and were diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. The study was approved by the Georg-August-University ethics committee and local internal review boards of the participating centers. All participants gave written informed consent.\n\nEsko, T | 15133739 | Estonia (EGCUT) | scz_egcu_eur\n\nThe Estonian cohort comes from the population-based biobank of the Estonian Genome Project of University of Tartu (EGCUT). The project was conducted according to the Estonian Gene Research Act and all participants provided informed consent (www.biobank.ee). In total, 52,000 individuals aged 18 years or older participated in this cohort (33% men, 67% women). The population distributions of the cohort reflect those of the Estonian population (83% Estonians, 14% Russians and 3% other). General practitioners (GP) and physicians in the hospitals randomly recruited the participants. A Computer-Assisted Personal interview was conducted over 1–2 ours at doctors’ offices. Data on demographics, genealogy, educational and occupational history, lifestyle and anthropometric and physiological data were assessed. Schizophrenia was diagnosed prior to the recruitment by a psychiatrist according to ICD-10 criteria and identified from the Estonian Biobank phenotype database. Controls were drawn from a larger pool of genotyped biobank samples by matching on gender, age and genetic ancestry. All the controls were population-based and have not been sampled for any specific disease.\n\nEsko, T; Li, Q; Dominici E | 15133739, 24166486 | J&J and Roche cases, EGCUT controls | scz_jr3a_eur\n\nEsko, T; Li, Q; Domenici E | 15133739, 24166486 | J&J and Roche cases, EGCUT controls | scz_jr3b_eur\n\nEsko, T; Li, Q; Domenici E | 15133739, 24166486 | J&J and Roche cases, EGCUT controls | scz_jri6_eur\n\nEsko, T; Li, Q; Dominici E | 15133739, 24166486 | J&J and Roche cases cases, EGCUT controls | scz_jrsa_eur\n\nCases were collected by Johnson and Johnson (J&J) and Roche as part of clinical collaborations with hospitals and outpatient centers. Cases were diagnosed according to DSMIV criteria, with medical record review by a trained psychiatrist. There were reliability trials across centers for the J&J studies. The J& J cases were mostly collected in Eastern Europe, with most coming from Estonian and Russia (>100); intermediate numbers from Austria, the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and Spain (50–100); and smaller collections from Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland (<50). The Roche cases were assessed with a structured psychiatric assessment by trained interviewers. Most of the Eastern European controls were from the Estonian Biobank project (EGCUT) and were ancestrally matched with cases from the J&J sample.\n\nGejman, P | 19571809 | US, Australia (MGS) | scz_mgs2_eur\n\nEuropean ancestry case samples were collected by the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia (MGS) collaboration across multiple sites in the USA and Australia as described in detail elsewhere. Cases gave written informed consent, and IRBs at each collecting site approved the human subjects protocol. A survey company (Knowledge Networks, under MGS guidance) collected the European ancestry control sample and ascertainment is described in detail elsewhere. DNA samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute.\n\nGurling, H | 19571811 | London, UK | scz_uclo_eur\n\nAll cases and controls were collected by University College London and had both parents from England, Scotland or Wales. All participants gave written informed consent and the U.K. National Health Service multicenter and local research ethics committee approved the human subjects protocol. Further details on ascertainment are available elsewhere. The samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute.\n\nJönsson, E | 19571808 | Sweden (Hubin) | scz_ersw_eur\n\nCases were recruited from northwestern Stockholm County and ascertainment has been described previously. Cases gave informed consent and the human subjects protocol was approved by the ethical committees of the Karolinska Hospital and the Stockholm Regional Ethical Committee.

Diagnoses were made according to DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria following interview and medical record review. US cases were recruited from schizophrenia clinical trials in a range of settings as part of a trial with Eli Lilly. Diagnoses were made according to DSM-III or DSM-IV criteria following interview by psychiatrist and medical record review. No controls were sampled as part of the study, and ancestrally-matched controls were chosen from the Myocardial Infarction Genetics Consortium (MIGen, dbGaP ID phs000294.v1.p1) that was genotyped with the same SNP array.\n\nLencz, T; Darvasi A | 23325106 | Israel | scz_ajsz_eur\n\nCases and controls were sampled from an Ashkenazi Jewish repository (Hebrew University Genetic Resource, http://hugr.huji.ac.il). Patients were recruited from hospitalized inpatients at 7 medical centers in Israel and were diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Controls were sampled through the Israeli Blood Bank and did not report any chronic disease or regularly prescribed medication at the time of assessment. Full ascertainment details have previously been reported. Local ethics committees and the National Genetic Committee of the Israeli Ministry of Health approved the studies and all participants gave informed, written consent.\n\nLevinson, D | 22885689 | Six countries, WTCCC controls | scz_lacw_eur\n\nCases collected as part of a larger pedigree-based study were partitioned into two subsamples. Cases with two genotyped parents were analyzed as trios (see PI Levinson, ms.scz_lemu_eur in the Trio section below). Unrelated cases who could not be used as part of a trio were included as a separate case-control analysis, using independent controls, matched by ancestry and genotyping array, from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. Cases were identified from different clinical settings (e.g. inpatients, outpatients and community facilities) in six countries (Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, UK, and the US). Diagnoses were established using semi-structured interviews, psychiatric records and informant reports. Case subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-III-R criteria. All protocols were approved by loci IRBs, and all cases provided written informed consent.\n\nMalhotra, A | 17522711 | New York, US | scz_zhh1_eur\n\nThe case and control subjects were recruited in the New York metropolitan area and ascertainment methods have been described previously. All participants gave written, informed consent and the IRB of the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System approved the human subjects protocols. DNA was genotyped at Zucker Hillside.\n\nMowry, B | 21034186 | Australia | scz_asrb_eur\n\nThese subjects were part of the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank. The case sample was recruited in four Australian States (New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria) through hospital inpatient units, community mental health services, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation services, non-government mental illness support organizations, and, in the initial stages, through a large-scale, national, multi-media advertising campaign. This sample is comprised of 509 cases from larger metropolitan centers of Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth. Cases gave written informed consent, and the human subjects protocol was initially approved by the Hunter New England Area Health Research Committee and subsequently approved by relevant Institutional Ethics Committees in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. Healthy controls were recruited through multi-media advertisements, and other sources. Controls were from the metropolitan centers of Brisbane, Newcastle, Sydney, Melbourne, and Perth. Controls gave written informed consent, and the human subjects protocol was approved by the Hunter New England Area Health Research Committee and Institutional Ethics Committees in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. The samples were genotyped in two stages at the Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, Newcastle, Australia.\n\nO’Donovan, M: Owen, M | 19571811 | Cardiff, UK | scz_caws_eur\n\nThe case sample included European ancestry schizophrenia cases recruited in the British Isles and described previously. All cases gave written informed consent to. The study was approved by the Multicentre Research Ethics Committee in Wales and Local Research Ethics Committees from all participating sites. The control sample used the Wellcome Trust CaseControl Consortium (WTCCC) sample described elsewhere, but included similar numbers of individuals from the 1958 British Birth Cohort and a panel of consenting blood donors (UK Blood Service). Samples were genotyped at Affymetrix service lab (San Francisco, USA).\n\nO’Donovan, M: Owen, M: Walters, J | 22614287 | UK (CLOZUK) | scz_clm2_eur\n\nO’Donovan, M: Owen, M: Walters, J | 22614287 | UK (CLOZUK) | scz_clo3_eur\n\nCLOZUK cases were taking the antipsychotic clozapine and had received a clinical diagnosis of treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Patients taking clozapine provide blood samples to allow detection of adverse drug-effects. Through collaboration with Novartis (the manufacturer of a proprietary form of clozapine, Clozaril), we acquired blood from people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia according to the clozapine registration forms completed by treating psychiatrists as previously reported. The samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute. The UK Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) approved the study. The controls were drawn from the WTCCC2 control samples (~3,000 from the 1958 British Birth Cohort and ~3,000 samples from the UK Blood Service Control Group). An additional 900 controls, held by Cardiff University, were recruited from the UK National Blood Transfusion Service. They were not specifically screened for psychiatric illness. All control samples were from participants who provided informed consent.\n\nOphoff, R | 19571808 | Netherlands | scz_ucla_eur\n\nThe case sample consisted of inpatients and outpatients recruited through psychiatric hospitals and institutions throughout the Netherlands. Cases with DSM-IV schizophrenia were included in the analysis. Further details on ascertainment are provided elsewhere. Controls came from the University Medical Centre Utrecht and were volunteers with no psychiatric history. Ethical approval was provided by local ethics committees and all participants gave written informed consent.\n\nPalotie, A | 19571808 | Finland | scz_fi3m_eur\n\nPalotie, A | Not published | Finnish | scz_fii6_eur\n\nFinnish cases were drawn from a nationwide collection of families with schizophrenia spectrum disorders.

All participants provided written informed consent and approval was obtained from the ethics committees at each location.\n\nPato, C | 19571811 | Portugal | scz_port_eur\n\nCases and controls lived in Portugal, the Azorean and Madeiran islands, or were the direct (firstor second-generation) Portugese immigrant population in the US, as previously described. Controls were not biologically related to cases. All participants gave written informed consent and the IRB of SUNY Upstate Medical University approved the protocol. The samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute.\n\nPetryshen, T | 24424392| Boston, US (CIDAR) | scz_cims_eur\n\nCases were recruited from inpatient and outpatient settings in the Boston area by clinician referral, through review of medical records, or through advertisements in local media. Cases were diagnosed with DSM-IV schizophrenia through a structured clinical interview (SCID) by trained interviewers with review of medical records and a best estimate diagnostic procedure including reliability trials across interviewers. A psychiatrist or a PhD-level mental health professional made the final diagnostic determination. Controls were ascertained through local advertisements from the same geographical area. Ethical approval was provided by local ethics committees and all participants gave written informed consent.\n\nRietschel/Rujescu/Nöthen | 19571808 | Bonn/Mannheim, Germany | scz_boco_eur\n\nThese German samples were collected by separate groups within the MooDS Consortium in Mannheim, Bonn, Munich and Jena. For the PGC analyses, the samples were combined by chip and ancestry. In Bonn/Mannheim, cases were ascertained as previously described. Controls were drawn from three population-based epidemiological studies (PopGen), the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg (KORA) study, and the Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) study. All participants gave written informed consent and the local ethics committees approved the human subjects protocols. Additional controls were randomly selected from a Munich-based community sample and screened for the presence of anxiety and affective disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Screener. Only individuals negative for the above mentioned disorders were included in the sample.\n\nRujescu, D | 19571808 | Munich, Germany | scz_munc_eur\n\nFor the Munich sample, cases were ascertained from the Munich area of Germany, as described previously. The controls were unrelated volunteers randomly selected from the general population of Munich. All were screened to exclude a history of psychosis/central neurological disease either personally or in a first-degree relative. All participants gave written informed consent and the local ethics committees approved the human subjects protocols.\n\nSt Clair, D | 19571811 | Aberdeen, UK | scz_aber_eur\n\nAscertainment and inclusion/exclusion criteria for cases and controls have been previously described. All participating subjects were born in the UK (95% Scotland) and gave written informed consent. Both local and multiregional academic ethical committee approved the human subjects protocol. The samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute.\n\nSullivan, PF | 18347602 | US (CATIE) | scz_cati_eur\n\nCases were collected as part of the Clinical Antipsychotics Trials of Intervention Effectiveness (CATIE) project and ascertainment was previously described. Participants were recruited from multiple sites in the USA with informed written consent and approval from the IRBs at each CATIE site and the University of North Carolina (Chapel Hill). The control subjects were collected by MGS (described above) and gave online informed consent and were fully anonymized. There was no overlap with controls included in the MGS collaboration sample.\n\nSullivan, PF; Sklar P; Hultman C | 23974872 | Sweden | scz_swe1_eur\n\nSullivan, PF; Sklar P; Hultman C | 23974872 | Sweden | scz_s234_eur\n\nSullivan, PF; Sklar P; Hultman C | 23974872 | Sweden | scz_swe5_eur\n\nSullivan, PF; Sklar P; Hultman C | 23974872 | Sweden | scz_swe6_eur\n\nSamples from the Swedish Schizophrenia Study were collected in a multi-year project and genotypes in six batches (sw1–6). All procedures were approved by ethical committees at the Karolinska Institutet and the University of North Carolina, and all subjects provided written informed consent (or legal guardian consent and subject assent). All samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute. Cases with schizophrenia were identified via the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register which captures all public and private inpatient hospitalizations. The register is complete from 1987 and is augmented by psychiatric data from 1973–1986. The register contains International Classification of Disease discharge diagnoses made by attending physicians for each hospitalization. Case inclusion criteria included ≥2 hospitalizations with a discharge diagnosis of schizophrenia, both parents born in Scandinavia and age ≥18 years. Case exclusion criteria included hospital register diagnosis of any medical or psychiatric disorder mitigating a confident diagnosis of schizophrenia as determined by expert review. The validity of this case definition of schizophrenia was strongly supported by clinical, epidemiological, genetic epidemiological and genetic evidence. Controls were selected at random from Swedish population registers, with the goal of obtaining an appropriate control group and avoiding ‘super-normal’ controls. Control inclusion criteria included never being hospitalized for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder (given evidence of genetic overlap with schizophrenia), both parents born in Scandinavia and age of ≥18 years.\n\nWalters, J | 21850710 | Cardiff, UK (CogUK) | scz_cou3_eur\n\nCases were recruited from community mental health teams in Wales and England on the basis of a clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (depressed sub-type) as described previously. 35 Diagnosis was confirmed following a SCAN interview and review of case notes followed by consensus diagnosis according to DSM-IV criteria. The samples were genotyped at the Broad Institute. The UK Multicentre Research Ethics Committee (MREC) approved the study and all participants provided valid informed consent.\n\nWeinberger, D | 11381111 | NIMH CBDB | scz_lie2_eur\n\nWeinberger, D | 11381111 | NIMH CBDB | scz_lie5_eur\n\nSubjects were recruited from the Clinical Brain Disorders Branch of the NIMH ‘Sibling Study’ as previously described. In brief, cases and controls gave informed consent and only participants of European ancestry were included in the current analysis. Cases completed a structured clinical interview and were diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Samples were genotyped at the NIMH.\n\nWendland/Schubert | Pfizer | Not Published | Multiple countries | scz_pfla_eur\n\nPfizer contributed anonymized individual genotypes for cases from seven multi-center randomized, double-blind efficacy and safety clinical trials (A1281063, A1281134, A1281148, A245–102, NRA7500001, NRA7500002, NRA7500003, and NRA7500004) as well as a set of purchased samples (NRA9000099). Trial samples were collected for antipsychotic medications across outpatient and inpatient treatment settings. All participating cases had a diagnosis of schizophrenia and were assessed using a structural clinical interview by trained interviewers, with systematic procedures to quality-control diagnostic accuracy and reliability trials across participating sites in the United States and internationally. Purchased blood samples were obtained from PrecisionMed International by Pharmacia and Upjohn Corporation, and were collected from diagnosed subjects with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. All studies were reviewed by both central and local institutional review boards, depending on the study site, before recruitment of subjects started. Protocol amendments were approved while the study was in progress and before the data were unblinded. The studies were conducted in conformity with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Code of Federal Regulations (21CFR, Part 50) and the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, and were consistent with Good Clinical Practice and the applicable regulatory requirements. Participants provided written informed consent before enrollment. An optional blood sample was collected from clinical trial subjects for pharmacogenetic analysis to investigate potential associations between genetic variant drug response and general characteristics of schizophrenia and related disorders. Sample collection was not required for participation in the original clinical trials. The controls (A9011027) were recruited in a multi-site, cross-sectional, non-treatment prospective trial to collect data, including DNA, from cognitive normal and free of psychiatric diseases elderly subjects in the US. Subjects were specifically recruited to match the gender, age, and ethnicity information from the LEADe and UCSD MCI studies. The study described here is within the scope of patient consent.\n\nWerge, T | 19571808 | Denmark | scz_denm_eur\n\nCases were ascertained through psychiatric departments and twin pair studies, and were of Danish parentage for at least the prior three generations. The controls were collected at the University of Aarhus, and included 500 medical students, all of Danish parentage for at least three generations. All subjects gave written informed consent and the Danish Data Protection Agency and the ethics committees of Denmark approved the human subjects protocol.\n\nBipolar Disorder\n\nAdolfsson, R | Not published | Umeå, Sweden | bip_ume4_eur\n\nClinical characterization of the patients included the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), the Diagnostic Interview for Genetic Studies (DIGS), the Family Interview for Genetic Studies (FIGS) and the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN). The final diagnoses were made according to the DSM-IV-TR and determined by consensus of 2 research psychiatrists. The unrelated Swedish control individuals, consisting of a large population-based sample representative of the general population of the region, were randomly selected from the ‘Betula study’.\n\nAlda, M; Smoller, J | Not published | Nova Scotia, Canada; I2B2 controls | bip_hal2_eur\n\nThe case samples were recruited from patients longitudinally followed at specialty mood disorders clinics in Halifax and Ottawa (Canada). Cases were interviewed in a blind fashion with the Schedule of Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia-Lifetime version (SADS-L) and consensus diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV and Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC). Protocols and procedures were approved by the local Ethics Committees and written informed consent was obtained from all patients before participation in the study. Control subjects were drawn from the I2B2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside) project. The study consists of de-identified healthy individuals recruited from a healthcare system in the Boston, MA, US area. The de-identification process meant that the Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review Board elected to waive the requirement of seeking informed consent as detailed by US Code of Federal Regulations, Title 45, Part 46, Section 116 (46.116).\n\nAndreassen, OA | PMID:21926972 [PGC1], PMID:20451256 | Norway (TOP) | bip_top7_eur\n\nIn the TOP study (Tematisk omrade psykoser), cases of European ancestry, born in Norway, were recruited from psychiatric hospitals in the Oslo region. Patients were diagnosed according to the SCID and further ascertainment details have been reported. Healthy control subjects were randomly selected from statistical records of persons from the same catchment area as the patient groups. The control subjects were screened by interview and with the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD). None of the control subjects had a history of moderate/severe head injury, neurological disorder, mental retardation or an age outside the age range of 18–60 years.

A summary of mean and median age at interview, age of onset (AOO), diagnostic subtypes (BD 1 versus BD 2), presence of psychotic symptoms, suicide attempt and family history of psychiatric disorders has been provided previously for both the Toronto and London cohorts. From the Toronto site (Centre for Addiction & Mental Health (CAMH)), BD individuals and unrelated healthy controls matched for age, gender and ethnicity were recruited. Inclusion criteria for patients: a) diagnosed with DSMIV/ICD 10 BD 1 or 2; b) 18 years old or over; c) Caucasian, of Northern and Western European origin, and three out of four grandparents also N.W. European Caucasian. Exclusion criteria include: a) Use of intravenous drugs; b) Evidence of intellectual disability; c) Related to an individual already in the study; d) Manias that only ever occurred in relation to or resulting from alcohol or substance abuse/dependence, or medical illness; e) Manias resulting from non-psychotropic substance usage. The SCAN interview (Schedule for Clinical Assessments in Neuropsychiatry) was used for subject assessment. Using the SCAN interview along with case note review, each case was assigned DSM-IV and ICD 10 diagnoses by two independent diagnosticians, according to lifetime consensus best-estimate diagnosis. Lifetime occurrence of psychiatric symptoms was also recorded using the OPCRIT checklist, modified for use with mood disorders. Similar methods and criteria were also used to collect a sample of 538 BD cases and 513 controls for the London cohort (King’s College London; KCL). Both studies were approved by respective institutional research ethics committees (the CAMH Research Ethics Board (REB) in Toronto, and the College Research Ethics Committee (CREC) at KCL), and informed written consent was obtained from all participants.

Approximately half of the GAIN sample was collected as multiplex families or sib pair families (waves 1–4), the remainder were collected as individual cases (wave 5). Subjects were ascertained at 11 sites: Indiana University, John Hopkins University, the NIMH Intramural Research Program, Washington University at St. Louis, University of Pennsylvania, University of Chicago, Rush Medical School, University of Iowa, University of California, San Diego, University of California, San Francisco, and University of Michigan. All investigations were carried out after the review of protocols by the IRB at each participating institution. At all sites, potential cases were identified from screening admissions to local treatment facilities and through publicity programs or advocacy groups. Potential cases were evaluated using the DIGS, FIGS, and information from relatives and medical records. All information was reviewed through a best estimate diagnostic procedure by two independent and non-interviewing clinicians and a consensus best-estimate diagnosis was reached. In the event of a disagreement, a third review was done to break the tie. Controls were from the NIMH Genetic Repository sample obtained by Dr. P. Gejman through a contract to Knowledge Networks, Inc. Only individuals with complete or near-complete psychiatric questionnaire data who did not fulfill diagnostic criteria for major depression and denied a history of psychosis or BD were included as controls for BiGS analyses.
