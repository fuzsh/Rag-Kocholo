        "text": "Short description\n\n6 full day presence with a mix of lectures and case studies based on real-life examples. The participants will be trained in various concepts on how to drive innovative research projects. This includes preparing and presenting an investor pitch as well as submitting a high-level business plan. Part of the course will be home assignments – both as part of a group and individually.\n\nShort description\n\nTo create a framework for integrating project management tools into the interaction between supervisors and Ph.D. students. The content includes time to reflect on meta-communication strategies to discuss your work together with your supervisors. This includes integrating planning for key decision points related to your Ph.D. project. In addition, you will be introduced to the PDCA framework, which stands for Plan-Do-Check-Act. This framework will be used to reflect on how to optimize your independent work through Plan-Do; and your work with others through Check-Act.\n\nShort description\n\nHalf-way in your PhD, you now know what being a PhD student really is about. It is also a turning point where questions such as “what options do I have”, “how can I make the most of my doctoral degree” and “how do I make a sensible choice for my future career “ may start to pop up and cause both excitement and concern. This workshop aims at giving you the tools to answer those questions and to support you in being able to make an informed choice for the next step in your career. In the workshop, you will consider 1. your professional development so far and whether there competences you would like to improve during your part b, and 2. How you can start preparing for the transition by building your network, understanding your options and increasing your awareness of what a “good” job/work life is to you.\n\nShort description\n\nThe aim of the course is to ensure that the participants can convey and handle responsible research communication of their own PhD project. Through different media channels and via different presentations techniques, the participants will be able to explain and present complex research in an engaging and understandable way to an audience whether it be the general public, journalists, patients, students in a classroom or a foundation’s review committee.\n\nShort description\n\nIn this workshop, we make the objectives of the PhD education explicit and equip students with strategies and tools to develop as independent scientists. In session 1, we discuss the skills and competences of a PhD – and their importance to society. In session 2, students present their research projects in small, cross-departmental groups and for each project discuss the opportunities for developing independence. Session 3 has a focus on the collaboration with supervisors and presents ways to negotiate roles and address progression during the education.\n\nShort description\n\nThe course is designed as a blended learning approach with a combination of out-of-class online learning and in-class face-to-face teaching. It is estimated to last over six weeks (4x4 hours in-class seminars, approx. and approx. 8 hours structured asynchronous online learning activities). The activities will consist of a mix of reading materials, watching videos, producing texts and models, participating in individual as well as group activities in-class and out-of-class, developing lesson plan and teaching portfolio as well as giving peer-feedback. To complete the course and receive ECTS credit and diploma it is mandatory to be active online and complete all activities (including peer-feedback and portfolio) and respect the activity deadlines.\n\nShort description\n\nThe students will obtain knowledge about bone cells and bone biology under physiological and pathophysiological conditions such as osteoporosis, rheumatology, rare bone diseases, cancer-induced bone diseases, and parathyroid and kidney diseases, as well as their current therapies. Moreover, the student will obtain basic knowledge about clinical and pre-clinical bone study design, in vitro cell cultures, serum bone markers, bone epidemiology, pre-clinical and clinical computed tomography (CT) and DEXA, and bone pathology and histology. Finally, the students will learn to identify the strengths and weaknesses in their PhD-study, and network with fellow PhD students within the bone field.\n\nShort description\n\nA PhD is a time to submerge into interesting research and exciting new contexts, but it is also a time to tend to your future career. Your PhD is a step towards your next job regardless of your professional background and your thoughts on career direction. This session will aim at encouraging you to build career management skills during your PhD: strengthen your knowledge and understanding of how adding a career perspective to your PhD is beneficial both for your professional development as a researcher and for ensuring that you have the skills, knowledge and experience necessary for your next career step, whatever that is.\n\nShort description\n\nThe aim of this course is to ensure participants are able to apply the Three Rs (reduce, replace, refine) effectively in the design of procedures and projects and make appropriate ethical and scientific judgments. The course is obligatory for persons who wish to achieve a personal license to independently plan, implement and take responsibility for the design and performance of animal experimentation within the European Union according to the EU Directive 2010/63/EU Article 23.2 and the Danish executive order 12 of 07/01/2016, §56.\n\nShort description\n\nThis peer-feedback course is only available for research year students. The course is focused on academic and personal development throughout the research year. Students will be put in groups of 4-5 students for the entire year. The groups will meet 4 times, and in the meetings each student will give a short presentation (5-10 minutes) to the group, followed by 20 minutes for feedback. Each group will also have a fixed mentor for the year, who will be responsible for guiding the process during the meetings."
