This is one of the questions that Associate Professor Morten Overgaard from the Department of Public Health helps his fellow researchers answer. At the department‚Äôs Biostatistical Research Unit his work is about securing the tools and a correct foundation for other researchers to be able to deliver results with a more direct societal impact. And he is mainly concerned with methods of handling survival data. ‚ÄúWhen you wish to say something about survival, it is often a central problem that as a researcher, you can only follow the study participants during a particular period, not until they are all dead,‚Äù explains Morten Overgaard, and elaborates: ‚ÄúThe correct handling of this and similar problems is crucial for the ability of my research colleagues to get something useful out of their analyses. So, we help them to assess what can be said about survival in such a situation ‚Äì what are, for example, good measures? And how can they be estimated with this type of data?‚Äù Through his work, Morten Overgaard aims to demystify survival analysis, addressing common misconceptions and prerequisites needed to utilize these methods effectively. His contributions are vital for ensuring that analyses are free of bias and produce dependable results.\n\nWe are thrilled to announce that Henrik Birn will join us as clinical professor and chair at the Department of Clinical Medicine and Department of Kidney Diseases on September 15th. Henrik‚Äôs research spans both rare and common forms of chronic kidney disease, focusing on complications and treatments like kidney transplants. \"My research will contribute to a better diagnosis and treatment of people with kidney disease, both those who have not yet reached kidney failure and those who are already being treated for it. This includes better diagnostics, simpler and safer diagnosis assessment and more effective and individually tailored treatment options,\" says Henrik Birn and continues: \"The professorship gives me the opportunity to become more closely involved in teaching medical students in kidney diseases and internal medicine. My ambition is to create the framework for engaging teaching that stimulates independent thinking and a lifelong interest in searching for new knowledge.\"\n\nNew professor at Health focuses on cutting-edge heart diagnostics and treatment. Chief physician Evald Christiansen is a prominent cardiologist with a long career in cardiology. And he has just been appointed as a clinical professor at the Department of Clinical Medicine at Aarhus University and Aarhus University Hospital. The new professor is an expert in performing advanced heart tests, which include accessing patients' blood vessels to map and treat potential narrowings or blockages. The primary focus of the new professorship is combating these types of narrowings, also known as ischemic heart disease. \"My research focuses on what we call invasive coronary diagnostics and treatment. Through large international randomized studies, we aim to optimize both the diagnosis and treatment of ischemic heart disease,\" says Evald H√∏j Christiansen, who looks forward to bringing his experience into his new role as professor. The new professor is particularly excited about participating in the education of medical students and young doctors, as well as training in complex angioplasties both at Aarhus University Hospital and internationally.\n\n35-year research effort recognized with international award Professor Per Fink has just been awarded the prestigious Signe and Ane Gyllenberg Foundation‚Äôs 75th anniversary prize. He has dedicated his career to advancing the understanding, diagnosis, and treatment of functional disorders such as fibromyalgia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome. His pioneering research has been instrumental in bringing functional disorders to the forefront of both national and international research agendas, and has helped advance the field tremendously. \"Developing evidence-based treatments and increasing understanding of functional disorders is not only important for improving patients‚Äô quality of life. It also helps combat the stigma that many of these patient‚Äôs experience. We continue to work to ensure that all doctors have the necessary knowledge to manage these complex diseases,\" says Per Fink. This international award, accompanied by a ‚Ç¨50,000 prize, honors Per Fink‚Äôs groundbreaking work in the field of functional disorders, which the professor describes as \"an enormous recognition and a great honor.\" Signe och Ane Gyllenbergs stiftelse\n\nGroundbreaking research from Aarhus University published in Nature A new study from the Department of Biomedicine has uncovered why the virus causing cold sores doesn't escalate into a more severe brain infection. This vital discovery could have significant implications for understanding and preventing neurological complications associated with the virus. The research, now published in the prestigious journal Nature, is a testament to the dedication and expertise of the team at Aarhus University. The study provides insights into the body's immune response, explaining how our natural defenses keep the virus in check. This could pave the way for new treatments to prevent severe brain infections. The team behind the project celebrated the breakthrough and recognition in Nature with a well deserved glass of champagne. ü•Ç. Huge congratulations to Professor S√∏ren Riis Paludan Trine Mogensen Jacob Giehm Mikkelsen and all the co-authors on this remarkable achievement. Learn more about the study and its significance in the article below üëá\n\nHow do you balance your family life with an academic career? Betina Elfving, Associate Professor at the Department of Clinical Medicine, has great experience in this area. Here are her 3 valuable tips: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Plan and organize I am very structured and have managed many things by planning ‚Äì especially at home. For example, meal plans and carpooling with other parents, so I only had to drive the kids to gymnastics once a month instead of every week. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Adapt and prioritize self-care I put aerobics and gymnastics on hold when the kids were little. There simply weren‚Äôt enough hours in the day for it. Instead, I started running, as it was easier to fit in. Once the pickup-drop-off phase was over, I joined a gym and went straight from work to exercise three days a week. It was wonderful to have time to do something for myself again. Now I row a sea kayak in Vejle Fjord. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build a support network I‚Äôve acted as a single parent for many periods. My husband is a fighter pilot and has been deployed to Afghanistan or stationed with the Air Force in the USA and the Netherlands several times. It was almost a given that the kids would get a fever the moment John boarded a plane. But I simply had to make it work. When my mother retired, she would sometimes stay with us for a week if I needed to conduct experiments in the lab. We also had a young girl employed during the peak years, and our neighbor has occasionally picked up the kids from daycare if I was stuck in traffic on the highway.\n\nClinical Professor returns to Aarhus University to strengthen cancer research We are excited to announce that Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly will join Aarhus University as a Clinical Professor at the Department of Clinical Medicine starting September 1, 2024. With a background in hematology Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly brings a wealth of expertise, particularly in the field hematologic cancer such as lymphoma. His work emphasizes the power of \"real world data\" to enhance patient outcomes by improving diagnosis, treatment, and side effect management. Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly took his medical degree at Aarhus University in 2007, and now, after significant contributions at Aalborg University and Aalborg University Hospital, he returns to lead groundbreaking research on hematology. His role will also include collaborations with Department of Hematology, Department of Molecular Medicine (MOMA), and Department of Clinical Epidemiology (KEA). Join us in welcoming Tarec Christoffer El-Galaly back to Aarhus University where his work will undoubtedly contribute to better healthcare outcomes for patients. üì∏: Private.\n\nWe welcome 951 new students to Health. Head of Education Jeppe Norskov Stokholm is very positive about this year's admissions and is especially pleased that so many students have secured a place in their top-priority program. \"We at Health are very happy that, once again this year, we have full enrollment in all our programs and can offer a study place to so many new, talented, and dedicated young people who wish to study at Aarhus University. More than 95% have been admitted to the study program they most wanted to join, which provides a very good foundation for a successful student life with good results,\" says Jeppe Norskov Stokholm. More applicants than ever before have been offered a study place at Aarhus University. In total, 7,612 applicants have been offered a place at Aarhus University. This corresponds to an increase of 3% compared to last year.\n\nIs there such a thing as too much detail in a medical body scan? With today‚Äôs incredible advancements in PET/CT scanning technology, it is possible to create dynamic images of an entire human body and map organs in the smallest detail. However, the images produces contain more information than can be visually comprehended, and this problem is exactly what our newly appointed professor Ole Lajord Munk aims to solve. ‚ÄúWe are developing mathematical models and using AI to extract the important quantitative information from images that doctors need,\" says the new professor of medical physics. Ole Lajord Munk is already unlocking critical data about how diseases like cancer and diabetes alter our body's glucose uptake, which could ultimately lead to more precise diagnoses and better personalized treatments of a wide range of diseases.
