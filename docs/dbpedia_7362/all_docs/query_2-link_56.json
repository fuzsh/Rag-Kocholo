        "text": "Tanner Memorial Reading Room\n\nRoom 035\n\nFollowing Utah Agricultural College (now Utah State University) President Joshua H. Paul’s resignation in April 1896, the college’s Board of Trustees selected Joseph M. Tanner to fill the vacancy.\n\nPresident Tanner guided the college through four successful years (1896-1900). Under his administration, the college embarked on a comprehensive two- and three-year Manual Training Program. These programs offered young men practical instruction “in the use of hand and machine tools..., to fit them for industrial pursuits as proficient carpenters, smiths, machinists and founders.” Young women were also offered similar courses in domestic arts.\n\nMany capable and very influential members were added to the faculty during Tanner’s administration. While principal of the Brigham Young College, Tanner had encouraged such scholars as John A. Widtsoe to go east for graduate study. Others, such as Lewis A. Merrill, followed Tanner’s advice and a number of these Harvard graduates joined the UAC faculty after returning.\n\nTanner was the father of prominent Utah philanthropist O.C. Tanner.\n\nLeonard Arrington (1917-1999) Room\n\nRoom 035A\n\nGrowing up on a chicken farm, Leonard Arrington first entertained thoughts of becoming a farmer himself. When the time for college came, Leonard chose the University of Idaho, where he had attended a Future Farmers of America convention, hoping to major in agriculture. The chemistry requirements soon led Arrington to change his mind and he concentrated instead on agricultural economics.\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Idaho, Leonard continued his education at the University of North Carolina, where he began studies towards a doctorate in economics and began teaching classes. World War II interrupted his schooling. Following the war, Arrington began working as an economics professor at Utah State Agricultural College, returning in subsequent years to the University of North Carolina, where he received his doctorate in economics in March 1952. His dissertation was entitled “Mormon Economic Policies and Their Implementation on the Western Frontier, 1847-1900.” Arrington is perhaps best known for his seminal works, Great Basin Kingdom: An Economic History of the Latter-day Saints, 1830-1900 (1958) and Brigham Young: American Moses (1985).\n\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, Leonard participated in several important professional endeavors, including the establishment of the Mormon History Association and the creation of the Western Historical Quarterly. In 1972, he became historian of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nIn March 1982, Grace, Leonard’s wife of nearly forty years, succumbed to heart disease. Both personally and professionally bereft, Leonard turned to his role as educator and found solace in his classes at Brigham Young University. Leonard later married Harriet Horne, who supported his research and writing by completing drafts of his books on her computer and collaborating with him on occasion.\n\nLeonard left behind a legacy of scholarship and mentoring that rightly earned him the title “Dean of Mormon History.” Largely because of his leadership, Mormon historical studies in the second half of the twentieth century became a viable subject in the larger discipline of American history. Utah State University Special Collections and Archives is the home to his extensive collections of papers, comprised of more than 270 linear feet of archival boxes. The Libraries also annually host the Leonard J. Arrington Lecture in Mormon History and Culture in his honor.\n\nSamuel George Ellsworth (1916-1998) Room\n\nRoom 035B\n\nSamuel George Ellsworth was born on June 19, 1916 in Safford, Arizona. He graduated from high school in Kansas City, Missouri, then attended Kansas City Junior College in 1935 and 1936. After serving a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints mission to the North Central State Mission in Minnesota, he attended Utah State Agricultural College, where he graduated with bachelor’s degree in both history and mathematics in June 1941. During World War II, George served as a staff sergeant, clerk and administrative inspector at Hammer Field in Fresno, California. From January 1945 to June 1946, George served as a Chaplain in the Philippines. After leaving the U.S. Army, he continued his education at the University of California at Berkeley where he received master’s in history in 1947, and a doctorate in history and philosophy in 1951. He returned to the Utah State Agricultural College where he taught in the History Department until his retirement in 1983.\n\nIn addition to his long teaching career, George published extensively and was a member of many local, state and national historical associations. He received a number of prominent awards and wrote numerous articles, reviews and encyclopedia entries dealing with the Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints and Utah history. George is perhaps best known for his seventh-grade textbook Utah’s Heritage. The textbook was published in 1972 and a second edition was published in 1985. George was the co-founder of the Western Historical Quarterly and was the managing editor from 1969-1979. He additionally published Dear Ellen: Two Mormon Women and Their Letters in 1974, The Journals of Addison Pratt in 1990, Seasons of Faith and Courage: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in French Polynesia, A Sesquicentennial History, 1843-1993 (a joint project with Kathleen C. Perrin) in 1994, and The History of Louisa Barnes Pratt came after his death in 1998.\n\nFife Room\n\nRoom 035C\n\nThe Fife Folklore Archives is named for folklorists Austin E. (1909-1986) and Alta S. (1912-1996) Fife, Utahns who helped shape the field of folklore. Using summer vacations and weekends, the Fifes traveled all over the west, most intensively in their native Utah, with a camping trailer, recording equipment, camera and stenographic materials to collect the folklife of the American West, including cowboy songs and Mormon folklore. Typically, one of them would interview someone while the other took notes or operated a recording device. They also visited libraries throughout the west, taking notes and making copies of songs and stories housed in regional archival collections.\n\nIn 1966, the Fifes deposited at Utah State University Library their extensive fieldwork collections. The collections included acetate discs and reel-to-reel field recordings, sixty-seven bound volumes of field notes/transcriptions, the extensive Fife Slide Collection of Western U.S. Vernacular Architecture and their extensive folklore book collection. In 1972, the library established the Fife Library of Western Folklore (later renamed the Fife Folklore Archives) under the administration of the Special Collections Department within the original Merrill Library. Along with the creation of a folklore repository, the Fife’s worked with folklorist Williams A. Wilson to create a folklore program at Utah State University.\n\nThe Austin E. and Alta S. Fife Folklore Archives is one of a handful of leading research facilities that acquire, preserve and make available the materials in folklore fields that constitute particular areas of institutional focus and strength. The Fife Folklore Archives collects field data, oral histories, monographs, slides, photographs, periodicals, books, audio recordings and non-commercial video recordings on the subject of folklore, particularly but not exclusively in the areas of regional folklore, folk groups, genres and themes.\n\nHatch Room\n\nRoom 035D\n\nThe Hatch Memorial Library Room and rare book collection have been important resources in teaching and research at Utah State University for more than 50 years. The Hatch Room, with its architectural elements, art works and furnishings, were all gifts to the university by L. Boyd and Anne McQuarrie Hatch in 1953. In addition to furnishing the room, Boyd and Anne had earlier developed a collection of rare printed materials for the library, including publications related to art history, interior design, architecture, landscape architecture, history, and religion.\n\nThe donors envisioned the Hatch Memorial Library as an inviting place where scholars could experience the arts and conduct humanities-based research.\n\nThe room was officially dedicated in 1953, and Henry Aldous Dixon, then president of what was the Utah State Agricultural College spoke. He said the room served two purposes — to preserve the best expressions of the western hemisphere’s cultural heritage and to give students of the day an opportunity to work in the intimacy of artistic beauty.\n\nIn 1952, the Hatches proposed creating a reading room that would house the Ella Gardener McQuarrie Hatch Book Collection and other rare materials. Antique furniture and decorative arts were, and are, important elements in the room’s design and in its educational purpose. The proposed gift included a 16th century English refectory table, English oak linen-fold panels, a Ming Dynasty vase, 15th century Italian faldistorium (folding chair), a 17th century Flemish tapestry and other fine antique objects.\n\nGift of Gail Bird Weinshenker and Ned M. Weinshenker in Memory of her Mother\n\nRoom 114\n\nThis room is dedicated to Joan Bird Johnson (1922-1993).\n\nJoan had a radio program in St. Paul, Minnesota in the mid-1940s called Auntie Joan’s Children’s Hour. She played all the parts in the stories, and read all the commercials. Her radio programs were energetic and fun-loving.\n\nJoan was an amateur actress who frequently had leading roles in local plays. Her jazz piano was very lively, and she was a wonderful artist and an accomplished athlete.\n\nJoan’s second marriage was to William H. Johnson in 1973 in Point Pleasant, New Jersey. He was originally from Morgan, Utah. Their time together was filled with an abundance of love and happiness.\n\nJoan was loved by all and a joy to be around.\n\nGift of Dan C. (1930-2017) and Manon Caine (1931-2017) Russell\n\nRoom 149\n\nAfter graduation from Logan High School, Manon Caine entered college at the Utah State Agricultural College (now Utah State University), graduating with a bachelor’s degree in English in 1953. While at USAC, she enjoyed singing in choir, theater, dance, Sponsor Corps and Chi Omega Sorority. She went on to earn a master’s degree in education from Stanford University, where she also sang in choir and participated in theater.\n\nManon met Dan Russell when he transferred to USAC from the University of Arizona. After he fulfilled his commitment to the U.S. Army and Manon finished graduate school, they were married in 1956. During the next two years they lived in New York City, where Dan attended school for an MBA degree and Manon worked for the American Field Service. Manon and Dan were devoted supporters of the performing arts in northern Utah.\n\nIn honor of Max P. Peterson (1938-2018) Director of USU Libraries, 1983-2000. Gift of his wife, Karen\n\nRoom 151\n\nMax P. Peterson, born in Montpelier, Idaho, completed a bachelor’s degree in history and later a master’s degree in political science from Utah State University. He was affiliated with Phi Alpha Theta and Pi Sigma Alpha and received a University Research Fellowship (1964-1965). He later attended the University of Arizona to complete a doctoral work.\n\nMax began his career at USU Libraries in 1965 and retired as director of libraries in June, 2000. A significant highlight of his career at Utah State University includes expanding information availability to scholars and students beyond the library collections by advocating cooperative efforts with statewide, regional and national library associations. Later, Max encouraged the increasing use of technology to modernize the library technical processes and patron access to the most up to date information systems, while also championing the expansion of collections and services in USU’s Special Collections and Archives.\n\nJosey Barnes Wayman (1929-2012) News Lounge\n\nJosey Barnes Wayman graduated from the Utah State Agricultural College (now Utah State University) in 1951 with a composite degree in speech and English. While a student at USAC, she was active in student affairs, performed in eleven theater productions and was crowned queen of the 1950 Junior Prom. Immediately after graduation, Josey became a pioneer in a new industry called “television” at KDYL-KTVT Channel 4, NBC, in Salt Lake City, the first television station west of the Mississippi.\n\nIn a nine-year career in television, Josey rose from model, to hostess of a daily program, to women’s program director. Before the age of thirty, she had won three consecutive Lifeline of America broadcast awards, was elected Western States vice president of American Women in Radio and Television, hosted both the first weekly network program and colored television program in the Intermountain West and had her biography appear in both Who’s Who of American Women and Who’s Who in the West.\n\nMay Swenson (1913-1989) Study Lounge\n\nRoom 418B\n\nMay Swenson was born in Logan, Utah, on May 28, 1913, and graduated from Utah State University (then the Utah State Agricultural College) in 1934. In 1936, May departed for New York City to make a life for herself as a poet. May’s honors include fellowships from the Guggenheim, Ford, Rockefeller and MacArthur Foundations, as well as a National Endowment for the Arts grant. She received the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, the Bollingen Prize from Yale University and an award in literature from the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Utah State University awarded May an honorary doctorate in 1987, the same year she received a prestigious MacArthur Foundation Fellowship. At the time of her death in 1989, May had published eleven books of poetry and served for nine years as chancellor of the Academy of American Poets."
