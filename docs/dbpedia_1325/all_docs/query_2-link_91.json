        "text": "This report on Revaluing Public Sector Food Procurement is the result of a unique collaboration between policy-makers, practitioners and scientists working together during the Foodlinks project. The idea for the report emerged during the initial stages of experimenting with how we exchanged our knowledge on public sector food procurement that came from our work within municipal administrations, urban and national governments, European platforms, civil society and the wider academic community. We wanted to ‘make’ a report together that reflects not only the reality of devising and implementing innovative approaches to public sector food procurement throughout Europe, but also offers an Action Plan to help and encourage urban governments to take up the challenge of more sustainable purchasing practices. This is the result of that work. The report was written as a joint collaboration over a number of months using a wiki on a web-based platform that was also open to other members of our...\n\nThe purpose of the ERA-Net project &quot;iPOPY&quot; was to obtain knowledge on barriers for implementing sustainable food in the supply chain for public institution. The case of school meals was chosen for detailled studies. Especially the public procurement of organic food supply chains have been studied. The study was carried out in Denmark, Finland, Italy an Norway. The economic turnover in this sector are counted in billion euros. The study identified a number of institutional, regulatory, economic, ideological and marked based barriers. The analysis of the collected data documents that many italian provinces and municipalities have succeded in implemeting a relatively high share of sustainable, local and fair trade produced food in the supply chain for school meals, with user payment. In Finland there is a national policy of free school meals for all school children, but Finland have no policy and almost no practices on using sustainable food in school meal provision. In Norwa...\n\nPublic procurement has been recognized as a tool to promote more sustainable production and consumption practices. As such, an increasing body of literature has become available in recent years focusing on the sustainable public procurement of food. This article reviews the literature on the sustainable public procurement of food with the aim to analyze how sustainability is framed. This is done by analyzing what aspects of sustainability are emphasized and what practices are identified as sustainable. A systematic literature review was conducted between the years 2000 and 2020, identifying 103 articles. Results from the literature review indicate that the focus has primarily been on studies to evaluate and explore policy and good practices for procuring sustainable foods. A dominant focus on specific foods types and origins, e.g., those locally sourced and organic foods, is highlighted by a large share of the literature to address all three sustainability pillars. We observed that ...\n\nThe present methodological handbook provides the methodologies which will be applied in each work package of the Strength2Food project. In particular, it contains a list of indicators on how to assess sustainability in food and agro-food supply chains. This methodological handbook aims at facilitating the task for field studies, both proposing several prioritizations (indicator, variable, value chain level), detailing how we will combine relatively common variables (eg., number of animals per hectare, …) into indicators (eg., carbon footprint) and indicating how we will provide default values for the majority of the requested variables (for one indicator, providing only 2-3 case-specific values and relying on default values for the other variables is enough to obtain a case-specific indicator). Methods and issues specific to each workpackage are also discussed in dedicated sections and the description of each indicator include a description of whether and how the indicator will be a...\n\nFood consumption outside home is a growing phenomenon that is rapidly gaining in importance in terms of its impact on both consumers and the food system. This paper presents an innovative tool for measuring the sustainability of food intended for public consumption in organizations such as schools, hospitals and workplaces. Drawing on an in-depth review of the food sustainability literature, the FOODSCALE method quantifies eleven sustainability categories which together cover thirty-six food sustainability indicators. A number of characteristics distinguish the FOODSCALE method from other food sustainability assessment tools. First, it covers the three dimensions of sustainability – society, economy, environment – treating these as interdependent and coexisting. Secondly, it considers the entire food system, thus incorporating aspects of production, distribution, procurement, consumption and waste disposal. Cross-cutting themes of health and human agency complement the eleven specified categories to present a holistic assessment of food sustainability. The tool helps to identify both good practice and areas for improvement and points towards specific measures for increasing food sustainability. Following a detailed discussion of the tool, the paper presents results of a comparative study of eight cases across five organizations in the Republic of Ireland. Results show significant differences in sustainability performance across cases and within organizations. The role of key decision makers in organizations and possible points of intervention are highlighted in the discussion. The research demonstrates the potential of the FOODSCALE method for assessing the (un)sustainability of food intended for public consumption. Building on theoretical insights from the alternative food systems literature, the paper emphasises the central role of organizations in supporting (un)sustainable food systems and highlights potential pathways toward more sustainable food procurement and provision. The paper makes a major contribution to the advancement of empirical research on the social, economic and environmental impacts of food provision in large-scale organizations."
