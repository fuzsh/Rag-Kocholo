        "text": "Cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) ruthenium complexes as remarkably active catalysts for ethenolysis\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nMarx, Vanessa M.; Sullivan, Alexandra H.; Melaimi, Mohand; ...\n\n2014-12-17\n\nIn this paper, an expanded family of ruthenium-based metathesis catalysts bearing cyclic alkyl amino carbene (CAAC) ligands was prepared. These catalysts exhibited exceptional activity in the ethenolysis of the seed-oil derivative methyl oleate. In many cases, catalyst turnover numbers (TONs) of more than 100,000 were achieved, at a catalyst loading of only 3 ppm. Remarkably, the most active catalyst system was able to achieve a TON of 340 000, at a catalyst loading of only 1 ppm. Finally, this is the first time a series of metathesis catalysts has exhibited such high performance in cross-metathesis reactions employing ethylene gas, withmoreÂ Â» activities sufficient to render ethenolysis applicable to the industrial-scale production of linear Î±-olefins (LAOs) and other terminal-olefin products.Â«Â less\n\nSelf-study program on HTML browser--application to Clinical Nursing General Remarks Course.\n\nPubMed\n\nOchiai, N; Sota, Y; Ezumi, H\n\n1997-01-01\n\nWe created a self-study program using HTML browser on the Clinical Nursing General Remarks Course, Eighty-three students each selected a published book on a personal history (written personal reflections from individuals who had undergone medical treatment and hospitalization), read it and submitted reports of their impressions of the histories. Their reports were arranged from a nursing perspective and entered on the home page of our college using HTML browser. We intended that the students would become more interested in reading of the personal histories, and that they would acquire new self-study skills and increase their interest in Internet through use of our program. In addition, we hoped that this program would encourage positive communication and mutual sharing of information. The students were able to easily refer to a personal history according to their interest from a nursing perspective. Therefore this program realized the mutual learning among students and other users.\n\nRemarkable cycle-activated capacity increasing in onion-like carbon nanospheres as lithium battery anode material\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDong, Jiajun; Zhang, Tong; Zhang, Dong; Zhang, Weiwei; Zhang, Huafang; Liu, Ran; Yao, Mingguang; Liu, Bingbing\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOnion-like carbon nanospheres (OCNSs) with an average diameter of 43 nm were produced on a large scale via a combustion method and examined as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. The OCNSs exhibit a remarkable electrochemical cycling behavior and a capacity much higher than that of graphite. The capacity increases significantly with increasing charge-discharge cycles and reaches a value of 178% of the initial value (from 586 mA h g-1to 1045 mA h g-1) after 200 cycles. Further investigation provides unambiguous experimental evidence that such a remarkable capacity increase is related to the stable onion-like structure of the OCNSs and to the existence of large numbers of disordered/short graphitic fragments, which gradually provide more active sites for Li ion storage. The unique electrochemical performance of OCNSs provides a new way to design a high-performance anode material for rechargeable batteries.\n\nAntibacterial activity of essential oils extracted from Satureja hortensis against selected clinical pathogens\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGÃ¶rmez, Arzu; YanmiÅ, Derya; Bozari, Sedat; GÃ¼rkÃ¶k, Sumeyra\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe antibiotic resistance of pathogenic microorganisms has become a worldwide concern to public health. To overcome the current resistance problem, new antimicrobial agents are extremely needed. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of Satureja hortensis essential oils against seven clinical pathogens. Chemical compositions of hydro distillated essential oils from S. hortensis were analyzed by GS-MS. The antibacterial activity was investigated against Corynebacterium diphtheria, Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia plymuthica Yersinia enterocolitica, Y. frederiksenii, Y. pseudotuberculosis and Vibrio cholerae by the use of disc diffusion method and broth micro dilution method. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of essential oils were found as low as 7.81 Âµg/mL. Notably, essential oils of S. hortensis exhibited remarkable antimicrobial activities against the tested clinical pathogens. The results indicate that these essential oils can be used in treatment of different infectious diseases.\n\nOtofaciocervical syndrome and metachondromatosis in a girl: Presentation of a novel association and remarks on clinical variability of branchial-arch disorders.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalinas-Torres, Victor M; Salinas-Torres, Rafael A\n\n2016-06-01\n\nOtofaciocervical syndrome (OFCS) is a rare disorder characterized by facial, ear, branchial, and musculoskeletal anomalies, along with hearing loss and mild intellectual disability. Clinically, its distinction from branchiootorenal syndrome can be difficult. To date, the coexistence of OFCS and metachondromatosis has not been reported. Here, we describe a sporadic patient with both OFCS and metachondromatosis. This novel association prompts us to do some remarks on the clinical variability of branchial-arch disorders; in fact, our observations are consistent with the highly variable expressivity of OFCS and illustrate the need of a more accurate characterization of these branchial-arch disorders. In the meantime, involvement of clavicles, scapulae and shoulders remains a distinctive feature of OFCS. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The study involved 160 patients diagnosed with hypertension and 42 controls. Based on the exclusion criteria, 42 were not eligible for this study. The remaining 118 hypertensive patients were categorized into 2 subgroups based on left ventricular mass index and relative ventricular wall thickness: a normal model subgroup with hypertension (HNM) and an HLVH subgroup. Serum CaN levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while serum CaN activity was determined by malachite green colorimetric assay. Among the HNM and HLVH subgroups, a positive correlation was demonstrated between serum CaN activity, but not serum CaN level, and HLVH. Moreover, the HLVH subgroup displayed a remarkable increase in the levels of brain natriuretic peptide, cystatin C, urinary albumin/creatinine ratio, and left atrium diameter compared to the HNM subgroup and controls. There was a positive correlation between serum CaN activity and LVH in hypertensive patients. Activated CaN could play an important role in the pathophysiologic mechanism of HLVH. Serum CaN activity could be a clinically useful diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for LVH. Â© 2018 S.

Task-related practice is a critical component for improving patient outcomes. Objective To test the feasibility of providing quantitative feedback about daily walking performance and motivating greater skills practice via remote sensing. Methods In this phase III randomized, single blind clinical trial, patients participated in conventional therapies while wearing wireless sensors (tri-axial accelerometers) at both ankles. Activity-recognition algorithms calculated the speed, distance, and duration of walking bouts. Three times a week, therapists provided either feedback about performance on a 10-meter walk (speed-only) or walking speed feedback plus a review of walking activity recorded by the sensors (augmented). Primary outcomes at discharge included total daily walking time, derived from the sensors, and a timed 15-meter walk. Results Sixteen rehabilitation centers in 11 countries enrolled 135 participants over 15 months. Sensors recorded more than 1800 days of therapy, 37,000 individual walking bouts, and 2.5 million steps. No significant differences were found between the two feedback groups in daily walking time (15.1Â±13.1min vs. 16.6Â±14.3min, p=0.54) or 15-meter walking speed (0.93Â±0.47m/s vs. 0.91Â±0.53m/s, p=0.96). Remarkably, 30% of participants decreased their total daily walking time over their rehabilitation stay. Conclusions In this first trial of remote monitoring of inpatient stroke rehabilitation, augmented feedback beyond speed alone did not increase the time spent practicing or improve walking outcomes. Remarkably modest time was spent walking. Wireless sensing, however, allowed clinicians to audit skills practice and provided ground truth regarding changes in clinically important, mobility-related activities.

F.\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThese observations represent the author's personal perspective regarding the ideas presented at this third Asia Pacific Conference on Few-Body Problems in Physics. It is not intended as a summary talk in the traditional sense, but is comprised of remarks emphasizing physics not speakers. Many of the talks covered results of those other than the speaker, and the ideas discussed will hopefully outlive the rapporteurs bringing these ideas to life at APFB05 held at the Suranaree University of Technology in Nakhon Ratchasima.\n\nTransforming the Activation of Clinical Trials.\n\nPubMed\n\nWatters, Julie T; Pitzen, Jason H; Sanders, Linda J; Bruce, Virginia Nickie M; Cornell, Alissa R; Cseko, Gary C; Grace, Janice S; Kwon, Pamela S; Kukla, Andrea K; Lee, Michael S; Monosmith, Michelle D; Myren, John D; Kottschade, Rebecca S; Shaft, Marc N; Weis, Jennifer Jenny A; Welter, Jane C; Bharucha, Adil E\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe Institute of Medicine and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognize that activating clinical trials in the United States is lengthy and inefficient. Downstream consequences include increased expense, suboptimal accrual, move of clinical trials overseas, and delayed availability of treatments for patients. An in-tandem processing initiative is here highlighted that transformed the activation of clinical trials (TACT), reduced the activation time by 70%, and offers a paradigm for enhanced translational readiness.

The purified enzyme Aga-BC7050 was 85 kDa according to SDS-PAGE and 168 kDa according to gel filtration, indicating that its native structure is a dimer. With p-nitrophenyl-Î±-d- galactopyranoside (pNPGal) as the substrate, optimal temperature and pH were 55 Â°C and 6.0, respectively. At 60 Â°C for 30 min, it retained > 50% of its activity. It was stable at pH 5.0â10.0, and showed remarkable resistance to proteinase K, subtilisin A, Î±-chymotrypsin, and trypsin. Its activity was not inhibited by glucose, sucrose, xylose, or fructose, but was slightly inhibited at galactose concentrations up to 100 mM. Aga-BC7050 was highly active toward pNPGal, melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose. It completely hydrolyzed melibiose, raffinose, and stachyose in < 30 min. These characteristics suggest that Aga-BC7050 could be used in feed and food industries and sugar processing.

Building upon prior fMRI work examining how facial affect and prosodic cues are used to infer a speaker's communicative intent, the authors examined whether children and adolescents with ASD differ from typically developing (TD) controls in their processing of sincere versus ironic remarks. At the behavioral level, children and adolescents with ASD and matched TD controls were able to determine whether a speaker's remark was sincere or ironic equally well, with both groups showing longer response times for ironic remarks. At the neural level, for both sincere and ironic scenarios, an extended cortical networkâincluding canonical language areas in the left hemisphere and their right hemisphere counterpartsâwas activated in both groups, albeit to a lesser degree in the ASD sample. Despite overall similar patterns of activity observed for the two conditions in both groups, significant modulation of activity was detected when directly comparing sincere and ironic scenarios within and between groups. While both TD and ASD groups showed significantly greater activity in several nodes of this extended network when processing ironic versus sincere remarks, increased activity was largely confined to left language areas in TD controls, whereas the ASD sample showed a more bilateral activation profile which included both language and âtheory of mindâ areas (i.e., ventromedial prefrontal cortex). These findings suggest that, for high-functioning individuals with ASD, increased activity in right hemisphere homologues of language areas in the left hemisphere, as well as regions involved in social cognition, may reflect compensatory mechanisms supporting normative behavioral task performance.

M.; ...\n\n2014-11-28\n\nOur first-principles density functional theoretical modeling suggests that NO oxidation is feasible on fully oxidized single Î¸-alumina-supported platinum atoms via a modified Langmuir-Hinshelwood pathway. This is in contrast to the known decrease in NO oxidation activity of supported platinum with decreasing Pt particle size believed to be due to increased platinum oxidation. In order to validate our theoretical study, we evaluated single Î¸-Al 2O 3-supported platinum atoms and found them to exhibit remarkable NO oxidation activity. A comparison of turnover frequencies (TOF) of single supported Pt atoms with those of platinum particles for NO oxidation shows that single supported PtmoreÂ Â» atoms are as active as fully formed platinum particles. The overall picture of NO oxidation on supported Pt is that NO oxidation activity decreases with decreasing Pt particle size but accelerates when Pt is present only as single atoms.Â«Â less\n\nStandardization of clinical pharmacist's activities: Methodology.\n\nPubMed\n\nGregorovÃ¡, Jana; RychlÃ­ÄkovÃ¡, Jitka; Å aloun, Jan\n\n2017-09-01\n\nEstablishing standardized and controlled system of work at a clinical pharmacy department and establishing effective recording of activities of a group of four clinical pharmacist when providing clinical pharmaceutical care (CPC) in a hospital. The duration of evaluated period is 5.5Â years. The first part was defining the purpose, methods and activities of clinical pharmaceutical care, the next part was designing the software for recording patient's data and CPC activities. To verify the functionality of our system the third part was conducted (from January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2015). CPC activities were defined precisely. During the 6Â months period, 3946 patients were reviewed (17% of patients admitted), in this group, 41% patients was labeled as risk (these patients had one or more risk factor). 1722 repeated reviews were performed, 884 drug therapy recommendations were recorded. The calculated average time necessary for one CPC activity is 28 min. During the 5Â year period, standardized system of work in clinical pharmacy department was established. This system is based on clearly defined activities and it enables external control. Our results supply data for negotiations with health insurance companies.\n\nRemarkable Transglycosylation Activity of Glycosynthase Mutants of Endo-D, an Endo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae*\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFan, Shu-Quan; Huang, Wei; Wang, Lai-Xi\n\n2012-01-01\n\nEndo-Î²-N-acetylglucosaminidase from Streptococcus pneumoniae (Endo-D) is an endoglycosidase capable of hydrolyzing the Fc N-glycan of intact IgG antibodies after sequential removal of the sialic acid, galactose, and internal GlcNAc residues in the N-glycan. Endo-D also possesses transglycosylation activity with sugar oxazoline as the donor substrate, but the transglycosylation yield is low due to enzymatic hydrolysis of the donor substrate and the product. We report here our study on the hydrolytic and transglycosylation activity of recombinant Endo-D and its selected mutants. We found that Endo-D preferred core-fucosylated N-glycan for hydrolysis but favored nonfucosylated GlcNAc acceptor for transglycosylation. Several mutants showed significantly enhanced transglycosylation efficiency over the wild type enzyme. Two mutants (N322Q and N322A) were identified as typical glycosynthases that demonstrated remarkable transglycosylation activity with only marginal or no product hydrolysis activity. Kinetic studies revealed that the N332Q and N322A glycosynthases had much higher catalytic efficiency for glycosylating the nonfucosylated GlcNAc acceptor. In comparison, the N322Q was much more efficient than N322A for transglycosylation. However, N332Q and N332A could not take more complex N-glycan oxazoline as substrate for transglycosylation, indicating their strict substrate specificity. The usefulness of the N332Q glycosynthase was exemplified by its application for efficient glycosylation remodeling of IgG-Fc domain.

A survey was sent to a randomly selected sample of 1511 medical physicists from July through October 2001 using primarily e-mail methods; a total of 851 surveys was received, for a response rate of 56%. Of these, 427 were responses from physicists who do partly or only clinical diagnostic medical physics; it is this group for which results are presented. Fifty-four percent of the physicists who reported doing any clinical diagnostic medical physics performed clinical activities only in diagnostic medical physics. Fourteen percent of all those doing clinical diagnostic medical physics were women. Over 97% of the physicists doing clinical diagnostic medical physics reported having graduate degrees in physics; 53% had PhDs. The mean total weekly hours worked by physicists doing clinical diagnostic medical physics was 42. Medical physicists doing only clinical diagnostic activities reported working approximately 40 hours weekly, whereas those doing partly clinical diagnostic medical physics reported working 14 hours weekly in the field (approximately one-third of their work time). Radiography and fluoroscopy, computed tomography, nuclear medicine, and mammography are all fields in which the majority of those doing any clinical diagnostic medical physics are active. Full-time physicists working only in diagnostic medical physics were responsible for a median of 25 units of equipment, compared with a median of 10 units for those working only partly in the field. Number of units evaluated, frequency of evaluation, and hours per evaluation were reported for almost 20 types of equipment. Medical physicists performing diagnostic clinical activities typically are responsible for a large number and wide variety of imaging\n\nResearch-active clinical nurses: against all odds.\n\nPubMed\n\nSiedlecki, Sandra L; Albert, Nancy M\n\n2017-03-01\n\nTo develop a theoretical understanding of factors that impact decisions of clinical nurses to conduct a research study. Only a small percentage of all nurses are research-active and even fewer clinical nurses are research-active. Several researchers have explored barriers to research activity by clinical nurses, but few have examined why, in spite of all odds, some clinical nurses are research-active. As the purpose of this study was to develop a theoretical understanding of the research-active nurse, a grounded theory approach was used. The sample interviewed for this study consisted of registered nurses (nÂ =Â 26) who worked in a hospital or ambulatory setting, had daily direct patient contact and had participated as principal investigator on at least one completed clinical nursing research study that was not in fulfilment of an educational requirement. The interviews were digitally recorded and analysed by two researchers using the constant comparative method. The findings from this study suggest that the conduct of research by clinical nurses was the direct result of a clinical trigger, characteristics and beliefs of the nurse about research and their role in generating knowledge, and the presence of support conditions, such as a research mentor. Clinical nurses can and do conduct research, in spite of constraints due to a lack of time, money and/or knowledge, if they have access to research mentors and are practising in a research-supportive environment. Nurses at the bedside are in a unique position to identify problems most in need of solutions. Findings from this study provide a foundation upon which to develop and test various programmes that seek to increase the number of clinical nurses who are research-active.

A comparison of reporting in published articles\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMallett, Susan; Altman, Douglas G.; Sauerbrei, Willi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nAlthough biomarkers are perceived as highly relevant for future clinical practice, few biomarkers reach clinical utility for several reasons. Among them, poor reporting of studies is one of the major problems. To aid improvement, reporting guidelines like REMARK for tumour marker prognostic (TMP) studies were introduced several years ago. The aims of this project were to assess whether reporting quality of TMP-studies improved in comparison to a previously conducted study assessing reporting quality of TMP-studies (PRE-study) and to assess whether articles citing REMARK (citing group) are better reported, in comparison to articles not citing REMARK (not-citing group). For the POST-study, recent articles citing and not citing REMARK (53 each) were identified in selected journals through systematic literature search and evaluated in same way as in the PRE-study. Ten of the 20 items of the REMARK checklist were evaluated and used to define an overall score of reporting quality. The observed overall scores were 53.4% (range: 10%-90%) for the PRE-study, 57.7% (range: 20%-100%) for the not-citing group and 58.1% (range: 30%-100%) for the citing group of the POST-study. While there is no difference between the two groups of the POST-study, the POST-study shows a slight but not relevant improvement in reporting relative to the PRE-study. Not all the articles of the citing group, cited REMARK appropriately. Irrespective of whether REMARK was cited, the overall score was slightly higher for articles published in journals requesting adherence to REMARK than for those published in journals not requesting it: 59.9% versus 51.9%, respectively. Several years after the introduction of REMARK, many key items of TMP-studies are still very poorly reported. A combined effort is needed from authors, editors, reviewers and methodologists to improve the current situation. Good reporting is not just nice to have but is essential for any research to be useful.

Prior research has concentrated on identifying administrative barriers and proposing various solutions to reduce activation time, and consequently associated costs. Here, we expand on previous research by incorporating social network analysis and discrete-event simulation to support process improvement decision-making. We searched for all operational data associated with the administrative process of activating industry-sponsored clinical trials at the Office of Clinical Research of the University of South Florida in Tampa, Florida. We limited the search to those trials initiated and activated between July 2011 and June 2012. We described the process using value stream mapping, studied the interactions of the various process participants using social network analysis, and modeled potential process modifications using discrete-event simulation. The administrative process comprised 5 sub-processes, 30 activities, 11 decision points, 5 loops, and 8 participants. The mean activation time was 76.6 days. Rate-limiting sub-processes were those of contract and budget development. Key participants during contract and budget development were the Office of Clinical Research, sponsors, and the principal investigator. Simulation results indicate that slight increments on the number of trials, arriving to the Office of Clinical Research, would increase activation time by 11 %. Also, incrementing the efficiency of contract and budget development would reduce the activation time by 28 %. Finally, better synchronization between contract and budget development would reduce time spent on batching documentation; however, no improvements would be attained in total activation time. The presented process improvement analytic framework not only identifies administrative barriers, but also helps to devise and evaluate potential improvement scenarios.

The purpose of this investigation is to assess research activity within the medical speciality of Clinical Biochemistry by comparing it with a matched control group from other medical specialities in Denmark. A list of all physicians registered in Denmark (23,127 persons) was drawn from the database \"Laeger.dk\". Of these, 5,202 were generalists (not included) while 11,691 were from other specialities. Of the 126 specialists from Clinical Biochemistry, 57 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Each of these 57 was matched according to medical title with two randomly chosen specialists from other specialities, totaling 114. Using Medline and the Web of Science, the number of publications and the number of citations were then ascertained. 25% of the 11,691 specialists held a PhD degree or doctoral degree, DMSci, (Clinical Biochemistry: 61%). The 171 specialists included in the study had 9,823 papers in Medline and 10,140 papers in the Web of Science. The number of Medline papers per specialist was 71 for Clinical Biochemistry compared to 51 for the control group. The number of citations per specialist was 1,844 for Clinical Biochemistry compared to 816 for the control group. The top ten H-indices (of which 8 were in Clinical Biochemistry) ranged from 30 to 69. Both the number of papers and the number of citations were higher for Clinical Biochemistry than for the control group. The difference was most pronounced among professors.\n\n[Antibacterial activity of panipenem against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].\n\nPubMed\n\nAbe, Tomomi; Fukuoka, Takashi; Sato, Yuki; Ito, Kazuyoshi; Sei, Masami\n\n2002-12-01\n\nAs the post-marketing surveillance of panipenem/betamipron (Carbenin), MICs of panipenem (PAPM) against 1355 clinical isolates of 28 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of parenteral carbapenem antibacterials, imipenem (IPM) and meropenem (MEPM), and parenteral cephem antibacterials, cefozopran, cefepime, and sulbactam/cefoperazone. The activity of PAPM was comparable to that of IPM against almost all species tested. Compared with MEPM, PAPM was more active against Gram-positive bacteria and Bacteroides spp., and less active against Gram-negative bacteria. Compared with the parenteral cephems, PAPM was more active against most of species tested and its MIC ranges were narrower than those of the cephems as were those of other carbapenems. In this surveillance study, the incidence of resistance in various species were as follows: 39.3% for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 47.3% for penicillin-intermediate Streptococcus pneumoniae (PISP), 15.1% for penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP), 0.9% for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli, 3.4% for ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, 19.2% for beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae, 24.0% for beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae, and 1.0% for metallo-beta-lactamase producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Against these resistant strains, carbapenems including PAPM showed generally more potent activity than cephems. It was noted that PAPM showed the most potent activity against PISP and PRSP, which showed high incidence of 62.4% totally, among tested drugs. Metallo-beta-lactamase producing P. aeruginosa exhibited high resistance and BLNAR H. influenzae also exhibited low susceptibility against all tested drugs. But no remarkable change in the activity of PAPM against other species\n\nPhenytoin: 80Â years young, from epilepsy to breast cancer, a remarkable molecule with multiple modes of action.\n\nPubMed\n\nKeppel Hesselink, Jan M; Kopsky, David J\n\n2017-08-01\n\nIn 1908 phenytoin (5,5-diphenylhydantoin) was first synthesized as a barbiturate derivative in Germany by professor Heinrich Biltz (1865-1943) and subsequently resynthesized by an American chemist of the pharmaceutical company Parke-Davis in 1923 in Detroit. Screening phenytoin did not reveal comparable sedative side effects as barbiturates and, thus, Parke-Davis discarded this compound as a useful drug. In 1936, phenytoin's anticonvulsive properties were identified via a new animal model for convulsive disorders, developed by Putnam and Merritt, who also evaluated its clinical value in a number of patients in the period 1937-1940. For many diseases, mechanism of action of phenytoin remains obscure. The voltage-gated sodium channel was and is generally regarded as the main target to explain phenytoin's activity as an anticonvulsant and an anti-arrhythmic drug. This target, however, does not explain many of the other clinical properties of phenytoin. We will explore a number of original articles on phenytoin published in its 80Â years history and give extra attention to the various hypothesis and experiments done to elucidate its mechanisms of action. Phenytoin has been explored in over 100 different disorders; the last two promising indications tested in the clinic are breast cancer and optic neuritis. Most probably, there are multiple targets active for these various disorders, and the insight into which targets are relevant is still very incomplete. It is remarkable that many pharmacological studies tested one dose only, mostly 50 or 100Â Î¼M, doses which most probably are higher than the non-plasma bound phenytoin plasma levels obtained during treatment.\n\n[Antibacterial activity of cefpodoxime against clinical isolates in 2000 and 2001].\n\nPubMed\n\nAbe, Tomomi; Fukuoka, Takashi; Sato, Yuki; Ito, Kazuyoshi; Sei, Masami\n\n2002-12-01\n\nAs the post-marketing surveillance of cefpodoxime proxetil (Banan), MICs of cefpodoxime (CPDX, an active form of Banan) against 1090 clinical isolates of 22 species from 15 medical institutions all over Japan from June 2000 to March 2001 were measured using the broth microdilution method approved by the Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and compared with those of oral cephem antibacterials, cefaclor, cefdinir, cefditoren, and cefcapene. In this study, remarkable change in the activity of CPDX was observed in Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae compared with the susceptibility in the studies before Banan was launched. This cause is considered to be the increase in the incidence of the following resistant strains: penicillin-intermediate S. pneumoniae (47.3%), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP, 15.1%), and beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant (BLNAR) H. influenzae (24.0%), which were scarcely isolated in 1989 when Banan was launched. Other tested drugs also exhibited low activity against these resistant strains. However, CPDX showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of 2 micrograms/mL against PRSP. Against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, CPDX also showed comparatively good activity with MIC90 of < or = 4 micrograms/mL, which was almost equal to that in the studies before its marketing. Against quinolones-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, CPDX showed excellent activity with MIC90 of 0.5 microgram/mL. Against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae except for Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, and Morganella morganii, CPDX showed good activity. However, in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp. Proteus spp., and Providencia spp., there are some high-resistant strains to all tested drugs including CPDX. Against Peptostreptococcus spp., MIC90 of CPDX was 8 micrograms/mL and its MIC range was widely distributed from 0.03 to 32\n\nGamma-Ray Attenuation Measurements as a Laboratory Experiment: Some Remarks\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAdamides, E.; Koutroubas, S.

A.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nIt is pointed out that the Viking missions to Mars are the most extraordinary and complex remote effort ever performed by man. Factors which made the Viking results so remarkable are related to the technological engineering accomplishment, the voluminous scientific data about the planet, and the public interest. Quite surprisingly it was found that the Viking 1 landing site was very similar to the California desert. Attention is given to details of spacecraft landing on the Martian surface, aspects of landing site selection, the design and the operation of Lander instruments, the nine different investigations performed by the Lander, the significance of the pictures obtained of Mars, the remarkable heterogeneity of the planet, the extent and variety of volcanism, the presence of water in the solid and gaseous form on the Martian surface, the presence of water in the liquid phase at some time in the past, the two natural Martian satellites, the composition of the Martian polar caps and their changes during the seasons, the composition of the atmosphere, and the biological results, which remain ambiguous.\n\n[Industry-Academia Collaboration in the Clinical Laboratory Field: Chairmen's Introductory Remarks].\n\nPubMed\n\nInaba, Tohru; Ikemoto, Toshiyuki\n\n2016-01-01\n\nIndustry-academia collaboration has become essential in contemporary medicine.

Remarkably, discussion of neuronal activity is largely absent in clinical neuroscience. Advances in neurotechnology and computational capabilities, accompanied by shifts in theoretical frameworks, have led to renewed interest in the information represented by single neurons. Using direct interfaces with the nervous system, millisecond-scale information will soon be extracted from single neurons in clinical environments, supporting personalized treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disease. In this review we focus on single neuronal activity in restoring communication and motor control in patients suffering from devastating neurological injuries. We also explore the single neuron's role in epilepsy and movement disorders, surgical anesthesia, and in cognitive processes disrupted in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease. Finally, we speculate on how technological advances will revolutionize neurotherapeutics.

It was developed to address widespread deficiencies in the reporting of such studies. In this paper we expand on the REMARK checklist to enhance its use and effectiveness through better understanding of the intent of each item and why the information is important to report. Methods REMARK recommends including a transparent and full description of research goals and hypotheses, subject selection, specimen and assay considerations, marker measurement methods, statistical design and analysis, and study results. Each checklist item is explained and accompanied by published examples of good reporting, and relevant empirical evidence of the quality of reporting. We give prominence to discussion of the 'REMARK profile', a suggested tabular format for summarizing key study details. Summary The paper provides a comprehensive overview to educate on good reporting and provide a valuable reference for the many issues to consider when designing, conducting, and analyzing tumor marker studies and prognostic studies in medicine in general. To encourage dissemination of the Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK): Explanation and Elaboration, this article has also been published in PLoS Medicine.

It is responsible for various clinical manifestations, including favism, hemolytic anemia, chronic non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, spontaneous abortion, and neonatal hyperbilirubinemia. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the severity of G6PD deficiency is of great importance but that of many G6PD variants are still unknown. In this study, we report the construction, expression, purification, and biochemical characterization in terms of kinetic properties and stability of five clinical G6PD variants-G6PD Bangkok, G6PD Bangkok noi, G6PD Songklanagarind, G6PD Canton+Bangkok noi, and G6PD Union+Viangchan. G6PD Bangkok and G6PD Canton+Bangkok noi showed a complete loss of catalytic activity and moderate reduction in thermal stability when compared with the native G6PD. G6PD Bangkok noi and G6PD Union+Viangchan showed a significant reduction in catalytic efficiency, whereas G6PD Songklanagarind showed a catalytic activity comparable to the wild-type enzyme. The Union+Viangchan mutation showed a remarkable effect on the global stability of the enzyme. In addition, our results indicate that the location of mutations in G6PD variants affects their catalytic activity, stability, and structure. Hence, our results provide a molecular explanation for clinical manifestations observed in individuals with G6PD deficiency. Copyright Â© 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Understanding of PAL has been based on processes and outcomes in controlled settings, such as clinical skills labs. PAL in the clinical setting, a complex learning environment, requires fresh evaluation. Socio-cultural theory is proposed as a means to understand educational interventions in ways that are practical and meaningful. We describe the evaluation of a PAL intervention, introduced to support students' transition into full time clinical attachments, using activity theory and activity systems analysis (ASA). Our research question was How does PAL transfer to the clinical environment? Junior students on their first clinical attachments undertook a weekly same-level, reciprocal PAL activity. Qualitative data was collected after each session, and focus groups (n = 3) were held on completion. Data was analysed using ASA. ASA revealed two competing activity systems on clinical attachment; Learning from Experts, which students saw as the primary function of the attachment and Learning with Peers, the PAL intervention. The latter took time from the first and was in tension with it. Tensions arose from student beliefs about how learning takes place in clinical settings, and the importance of social relationships, leading to variable engagement with PAL. Differing perspectives within the group were opportunities for expansive learning. PAL in the clinical environment presents challenges specific to that context. Using ASA helped to describe student activity on clinical attachment and to highlight tensions and contradictions relating PAL in that setting. Planning learning opportunities on clinical placements, must take account of how students learn in workplaces, and the complexity of the multiple competing activity systems related to learning and social activities.\n\nDanish research-active clinical nurses overcome barriers in research utilization.\n\nPubMed\n\nAdamsen, Lis; Larsen, Kristian; Bjerregaard, Lene; Madsen, Jan K\n\n2003-03-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to examine whether there was a difference between clinical nurses who were research-active, and clinical nurses who were nonresearch-active in utilization of research. A further aim was to identify the most significant barriers faced by a group of Danish clinical nurses in their use of research. Discrepancy between the improved quality of research results and the lack of implementing them was the starting point for a series of studies which showed the types of barriers clinical nurses found especially cumbersome when applying the research results of other researchers. This study investigates whether the clinical nurses' own engagement in research had any impact on their perception of research utilization. The study had an exploratory and descriptive design. Seventy-nine Danish clinical nurses participated and semi-structured interviewing was used as the research method. There was a statistically significant difference between the research-active and nonresearch-active nurses on various variables. The study showed that, to a larger extent, research-active nurses used evidence-based knowledge and were generally more internationally orientated. Furthermore, two important barriers for research utilization were identified by all 79 clinical nurses included in the study, i.e. 90% of the nurses explained that the quantity of research results was overwhelming, and 75% of them found that they were unable to evaluate the quality of the research. Clinical nurses, who were research-active themselves, experienced more success in overcoming some of the barriers, which existed in applying research to practice. The research potential found amongst clinical nurses in Denmark needed to be further supported through training and guidance in research methodology, establishing introductory stipends and part-time research positions. By doing so, some of the barriers affecting research utilization and the so-called theory-practice gap might be reduced.

In the current study, endophytic actinomycetes from rhizome of Zingiber officinale were explored in terms of its diversity and bioactive properties. Fourteen different organisms were isolated, identified and screened for activity against Pythium myriotylum and human clinical pathogens. Among these, Nocardiopsis sp. ZoA1 was found to have highest inhibition with excellent antibacterial effects compared to standard antibiotics. Remarkable antibiofilm property was also shown by the extract of ZoA1. Its antifungal activity against Pythium and other common phytopathogens was also found to be promising as confirmed by scanning electron microscopic analysis. By PCR-based sequence analysis of phz E gene, the organism was confirmed for the genetic basis of phenazine biosynthesis. Further GC-MS analysis of Nocardiopsis sp. revealed the presence of various compounds including Phenol, 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethylethyl) and trans cinnamic acid which can have significant role in the observed result. The current study is the first report on endophytic Nocardiopsis sp. from ginger with promising applications. In vivo treatment of Nocardiopsis sp. on ginger rhizome has revealed its inhibition towards the colonization of P. myriotylum which makes the study to have promises to manage the severe diseases in ginger like rhizome rot.\n\n[Post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--I. Gram-positive bacteria].\n\nPubMed\n\nIgari, Jun; Oguri, Toyoko; Hiramatsu, Nobuyoshi; Akiyama, Kazumitsu; Koyama, Tsuneo\n\n2002-02-01\n\nAs a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (CZOP), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, and carbapenems. Changes in the bacterial sensitivity for CZOP were also evaluated with the resistance ratio calculated with breakpoint MIC. Sixteen species (1,913 strains) of Gram-positive bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA; n = 178), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA; n = 199), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE; n = 98), methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE; n = 164), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n = 72), Staphylococcus saprophyticus (n = 28), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 206), Enterococcus faecium (n = 91), Enterococcus avium (n = 72), Streptococcus pyogenes (n = 133), Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 138), penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP; n = 133), penicillin-intermediate resistant S. pneumoniae (PISP; n = 100), penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (PRSP; n = 29), Streptococcus milleri group (n = 135) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 137). CZOP possessed comparable antibacterial activities against MSSA and MSSE to other cephems, and was also effective on MRSE but not on MRSA. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. saprophyticus was comparable to or higher than other cephems. CZOP, however, did not indicate an antibacterial activity against S. haemolyticus, just like other cephems. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecalis was comparable to cefpirome (CPR) and higher than other cephems. No antibacterial activity of CZOP against E. faecium and E. avium was observed, just like other drugs. An antibacterial activity of CZOP against S. pyogenes was as potent as that of cefotiam (CTM), cefepime (CFPM) and CPR, and that against S. agalactiae was\n\nRemarkable Reproducibility of Enzyme Activity Profiles in Tomato Fruits Grown under Contrasting Environments Provides a Roadmap for Studies of Fruit Metabolism1[W][OPEN\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBiais, BenoÃ®t; BÃ©nard, Camille; Beauvoit, Bertrand; ColombiÃ©, Sophie; Prodhomme, DuyÃªn; MÃ©nard, Guillaume; Bernillon, StÃ©phane; Gehl, Bernadette; Gautier, HÃ©lÃ¨ne; Ballias, Patricia; Mazat, Jean-Pierre; Sweetlove, Lee; GÃ©nard, Michel; Gibon, Yves\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo assess the influence of the environment on fruit metabolism, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum âMoneymakerâ) plants were grown under contrasting conditions (optimal for commercial, water limited, or shaded production) and locations. Samples were harvested at nine stages of development, and 36 enzyme activities of central metabolism were measured as well as protein, starch, and major metabolites, such as hexoses, sucrose, organic acids, and amino acids. The most remarkable result was the high reproducibility of enzyme activities throughout development, irrespective of conditions or location. Hierarchical clustering of enzyme activities also revealed tight relationships between metabolic pathways and phases of development. Thus, cell division was characterized by high activities of fructokinase, glucokinase, pyruvate kinase, and tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes, indicating ATP production as a priority, whereas cell expansion was characterized by enzymes involved in the lower part of glycolysis, suggesting a metabolic reprogramming to anaplerosis. As expected, enzymes involved in the accumulation of sugars, citrate, and glutamate were strongly increased during ripening. However, a group of enzymes involved in ATP production, which is probably fueled by starch degradation, was also increased. Metabolites levels seemed more sensitive than enzymes to the environment, although such differences tended to decrease at ripening. The integration of enzyme and metabolite data obtained under contrasting growth conditions using principal component analysis suggests that, with the exceptions of alanine amino transferase and glutamate and malate dehydrogenase and malate, there are no links between single enzyme activities and metabolite time courses or levels.

In this work the remarkable bifunctional behavior of the defective UiOâ66(Zr) metal organic framework is shown for acidâbase pair catalysis. The active site relies on the presence of coordinatively unsaturated zirconium sites, which may be tuned by removing framework linkers and by removal of water from the inorganic bricks using a dehydration treatment. To elucidate the amphoteric nature of defective UiOâ66, the Oppenauer oxidation of primary alcohols has been theoretically investigated using density functional theory (DFT) and the periodic approach. The presence of acid and basic centers within molecular distances is shown to be crucial for determining the catalytic activity of the material. Hydrated and dehydrated bricks have a distinct influence on the acidity and basicity of the active sites. In any case both functions need to cooperate in a concerted way to enable the chemical transformation. Experimental results on UiOâ66 materials of different defectivity support the theoretical observations made in this work.

The HAAL are recognized by a remarkably high UV exposure, strong changes in temperature and salinity, and a high content of toxic elements, especially arsenic. Being exposed to remarkably extreme conditions, they have been classified as model systems for the study of life on other planets. Particularly, Acinetobacter strains isolated from the HAAL were studied for their survival competence under strong UV-B irradiation. Clinical isolates, Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter johnsonii, served as reference material. Whereas the reference strains rapidly lost viability under UV-B irradiation, most HAAL-derived strains readily survived this exposure and showed less change in cell number after the treatment. Controls for DNA repair activity, comparing dark repair (DR) or photo repair (PR), gave evidence for the involvement of photolyases in the DNA repair. Comparative measurements by HPLC-mass spectrometry detected the number of photoproducts: bipyrimidine dimers under both PR and DR treatments were more efficiently repaired in the HAAL strains (up to 85Â % PR and 38Â % DR) than in the controls (31Â % PR and zero DR ability). Analysis of cosmid-cloned total genomic DNA from the most effective DNA-photorepair strain (Ver3) yielded a gene (HQ443199) encoding a protein with clear photolyase signatures belonging to class I CPD-photolyases. Despite the relatively low sequence similarity of 41Â % between the enzymes from Ver3 and from E. coli (PDB 1DNPA), a model-building approach revealed a high structural homology to the CPD-photolyase of E. coli.\n\nRemarkable resilience of teeth.\n\nPubMed\n\nChai, Herzl; Lee, James J-W; Constantino, Paul J; Lucas, Peter W; Lawn, Brian R\n\n2009-05-05\n\nTooth enamel is inherently weak, with fracture toughness comparable with glass, yet it is remarkably resilient, surviving millions of functional contacts over a lifetime. We propose a microstructural mechanism of damage resistance, based on observations from ex situ loading of human and sea otter molars (teeth with strikingly similar structural features). Section views of the enamel implicate tufts, hypomineralized crack-like defects at the enamel-dentin junction, as primary fracture sources. We report a stabilization in the evolution of these defects, by \"stress shielding\" from neighbors, by inhibition of ensuing crack extension from prism interweaving (decussation), and by self-healing. These factors, coupled with the capacity of the tooth configuration to limit the generation of tensile stresses in largely compressive biting, explain how teeth may absorb considerable damage over time without catastrophic failure, an outcome with strong implications concerning the adaptation of animal species to diet.\n\nRemarkable recoveries: research and practice from a patient's perspective.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarasch, Marc Ian\n\n2008-08-01\n\nMind-body therapies are often portrayed in the literature as self-palliative, adjunctive, and complementary, but rarely as contributive to cure. Many physicians continue to view them as acceptable indulgences so long as they are harmless and the patient remains fully compliant with a standard treatment regimen. The possibility that such modalities might help drive the healing process itself is infrequently acknowledged. This article addresses the topic of such therapies, examining remarkable recoveries in cancer, and suggesting the need for a \"Remarkable Recovery Registry\" to expand the literature on these cases. The author discusses the importance of complementary alternative medicine, and emotional and pyschologic support in the treatment regimen, and the need for health care providers and patients to work together to provide the best emotional environment for the healing process.\n\nCommunicationâElectrolysis at High Efficiency with Remarkable Hydrogen Production Rates\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nWood, Anthony; He, Hongpeng; Joia, Tahir; ...\n\n2016-01-20\n\nSolid Oxide Electrolysis (SOE) can be used to produce hydrogen with very high efficiencies at remarkable hydrogen production rates. Through microstructural and compositional modification, conventional low cost Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) materials have been used to create a Solid Oxide Electrolysis Cell (SOEC) that can achieve remarkable current density at cell voltages allowing higher conversion efficiency than current commercial electrolysers. Current densities in excess of 6 A/cm2 have been achieved at 800Â°C with a cell voltage of < 1.67 V. This cell shows a more than 3-fold increase in hydrogen production rate at higher efficiency than established commercial electrolysers.\n\nDo Urinary Cystine Parameters Predict Clinical Stone Activity?\n\nPubMed\n\nFriedlander, Justin I; Antonelli, Jodi A; Canvasser, Noah E; Morgan, Monica S C; Mollengarden, Daniel; Best, Sara; Pearle, Margaret S\n\n2018-02-01\n\nAn accurate urinary predictor of stone recurrence would be clinically advantageous for patients with cystinuria. A proprietary assay (Litholink, Chicago, Illinois) measures cystine capacity as a potentially more reliable estimate of stone forming propensity. The recommended capacity level to prevent stone formation, which is greater than 150 mg/l, has not been directly correlated with clinical stone activity. We investigated the relationship between urinary cystine parameters and clinical stone activity. We prospectively followed 48 patients with cystinuria using 24-hour urine collections and serial imaging, and recorded stone activity. We compared cystine urinary parameters at times of stone activity with those obtained during periods of stone quiescence. We then performed correlation and ROC analysis to evaluate the performance of cystine parameters to predict stone activity. During a median followup of 70.6 months (range 2.2 to 274.6) 85 stone events occurred which could be linked to a recent urine collection. Cystine capacity was significantly greater for quiescent urine than for stone event urine (mean Â± SD 48 Â± 107 vs -38 Â± 163 mg/l, p <0.001). Cystine capacity significantly correlated inversely with stone activity (r = -0.29, p <0.001). Capacity also correlated highly negatively with supersaturation (r = -0.88, p <0.001) and concentration (r = -0.87, p <0.001). Using the suggested cutoff of greater than 150 mg/l had only 8.0% sensitivity to predict stone quiescence. Decreasing the cutoff to 90 mg/l or greater improved sensitivity to 25.2% while maintaining specificity at 90.9%. Our results suggest that the target for capacity should be lower than previously advised. Copyright Â© 2018 American Urological Association Education and Research, Inc. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Active learning, an approach that actively samples from a large pool, provides an alternative solution. Its major goal in classification is to reduce the annotation effort while maintaining the quality of the predictive model. However, few studies have investigated its uses in clinical NLP. This paper reports an application of active learning to a clinical text classification task: to determine the assertion status of clinical concepts. The annotated corpus for the assertion classification task in the 2010 i2b2/VA Clinical NLP Challenge was used in this study. We implemented several existing and newly developed active learning algorithms and assessed their uses. The outcome is reported in the global ALC score, based on the Area under the average Learning Curve of the AUC (Area Under the Curve) score. Results showed that when the same number of annotated samples was used, active learning strategies could generate better classification models (best ALC â 0.7715) than the passive learning method (random sampling) (ALC â 0.7411). Moreover, to achieve the same classification performance, active learning strategies required fewer samples than the random sampling method. For example, to achieve an AUC of 0.79, the random sampling method used 32 samples, while our best active learning algorithm required only 12 samples, a reduction of 62.5% in manual annotation effort.

We sought to develop a rapid, accurate, and noninvasive assessment of vitiligo state. In daylight and Wood's light examinations, 2 common clinical types of vitiligo were identified as amelanotic with sharply demarcated borders and hypomelanotic with poorly defined borders. Photographs were taken at the time of examination and a skin biopsy at the edge of a vitiligo lesion was performed. One year after the initial visit, the vitiligo was classified as stable if no new lesions had appeared, and as active if the number, size, or both of existing vitiligo lesions were increased. Skin biopsy specimens from 71 patients were stained and immunostained for melanocytes, CD8 + T lymphocytes, and E-cadherin. The active lesions were associated with hypomelanotic appearance with poorly defined borders (PÂ <Â .001), and histologically with an infiltration of CD8 + T lymphocytes in the epidermis and dermis (PÂ =Â .017), with a strong expression of E-cadherin (PÂ =Â .044). The fact that this was a single-center study and that activity was sometimes site-dependent are limitations. The hypomelanotic with poorly defined borders type could be a good indicator of the actual activity of a vitiligo lesion. Copyright Â© 2017 American Academy of Dermatology, Inc.

The origin of all of the pyrimidine atoms has been previously determined using labeling studies and suggests that the pyrimidine is formed using remarkable chemistry that is without chemical or biochemical precedent. Here we report the overexpression of the closely related Candida albicans pyrimidine synthase (THI5p) and the reconstitution and preliminary characterization of the enzymatic activity. A structure of the C. albicans THI5p shows PLP bound at the active site via an imine with Lys62 and His66 in close proximity to the PLP. Our data suggest thatmoreÂ Â» His66 of the THI5 protein is the histidine source for pyrimidine formation and that the pyrimidine synthase is a single-turnover enzyme.Â«Â less\n\nClinical features of adult-onset chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection: a retrospective analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nArai, Ayako; Imadome, Ken-Ichi; Watanabe, Yuko; Yoshimori, Mayumi; Koyama, Takatoshi; Kawaguchi, Takeharu; Nakaseko, Chiaki; Fujiwara, Shigeyoshi; Miura, Osamu\n\n2011-05-01\n\nWe performed a retrospective analysis of patients with adult-onset chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection (CAEBV). First, we analyzed five patients (aged 28-72) diagnosed at our hospitals with EBV-infected clonally proliferating T cells. Four patients were administered cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (CHOP) chemotherapy, but no remarkable decrease of viral load was observed in three of the patients. The other patient died 19 days after initiation of CHOP treatment due to disease progression. Addition of high-dose cytarabine to the regimens of two of the patients was discontinued shortly after administration, due to the development of grade 4 pericardial effusion. Together, these regimens may be insufficient for treating adult-onset CAEBV. We next reviewed 23 adult-onset CAEBV patients, adding 18 previously reported patients to the five patients described in the present study. T cells were frequently infected (87%), whereas NK- and T-cell types are known to be almost equally prevalent in childhood-onset cases. The time duration from the onset of disease to initiation of treatment averaged 20 months. Reports showed that 12 patients died; seven patients died at an average of 8 months after initiation of treatment. Patients' disease courses seemed to be rapidly progressive and more aggressive than those of childhood-onset cases. More cases must be studied to clarify clinical features and establish an optimal treatment strategy.\n\nIn vitro activity of AT-4140 against clinical bacterial isolates.\n\nPubMed\n\nKojima, T; Inoue, M; Mitsuhashi, S\n\n1989-11-01\n\nThe activity of AT-4140, a new fluoroquinolone, was evaluated against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared with those of existing analogs. AT-4140 had a broad spectrum and a potent activity against gram-positive and -negative bacteria, including Legionella spp. and Bacteroides fragilis. The activity of AT-4140 against gram-positive and -negative cocci, including Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, was higher than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin. Its activity against gram-negative rods was generally comparable to that of ciprofloxacin. Some isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MIC of methicillin, greater than or equal to 12.5 micrograms/ml) were resistant to existing quinolones, but many of them were still susceptible to AT-4140 at concentrations below 0.39 micrograms/ml. The MICs of AT-4140, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin for 90% of clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus were 0.2, 12.5, 6.25, and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively. AT-4140 was bactericidal for each of 20 clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at concentrations near the MICs. AT-4140 inhibited the supercoiling activity of DNA gyrase from E. coli.\n\nThe Remarkable History Of Hypnosis In New Orleans (SociÃ©tÃ© Du MagnÃ©tisme De La Nouvelle OrlÃ©ans): A Tribute to Dabney Ewin.\n\nPubMed\n\nTramontana, Joseph\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDr. Dabney Ewin was a major factor in the revitalization of the New Orleans Society for Clinical Hypnosis (NOSCH) after it had been dormant for many years.

This is especially the case in the Mediterranean and oversea territories/departments of France, characterized by extreme hydro-climatological features and with a large part of the population exposed to flood risks. The recurrence of remarkable flash flood events, associated with high hazard intensity, significant damage and socio-political consequences, therefore raises several issues for authorities and risk management policies. This study aims to improve our understanding of the hazard analysis process in the case of four remarkable flood events: March 1930, October 1940, January 1980 and November 1999. Firstly, we present the methodology used to define the remarkability score of a flood event. Then, to identify the factors leading to a remarkable flood event, we explore the main parameters of the hazard analysis process, such as the meteorological triggering conditions, the return period of the rainfall and peak discharge, as well as some additional factors (initial catchment state, flood chronology, cascade effects, etc.). The results contribute to understanding the complexity of the processes leading to flood hazard and highlight the importance for risk managers of taking additional factors into account.\n\nIranian Clinical Nursesâ Activities for Self-Directed Learning: A Qualitative Study\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGhiyasvandian, Shahrzad; Malekian, Morteza; Cheraghi, Mohammad Ali\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: Clinical nurses need lifelong learning skills for responding to the rapid changes of clinical settings. One of the best strategies for lifelong learning is self-directed learning. The aim of this study was to explore Iranian clinical nursesâ activities for self-directed learning. Methods: In this qualitative study, 23 semi-structured personal interviews were conducted with nineteen clinical nurses working in all four hospitals affiliated to Isfahan Social Security Organization, Isfahan, Iran. Study data were analyzed by using the content analysis approach. The study was conducted from June 2013 to October 2014. Findings: Study participantsâ activities for self-directed learning fell into two main categories of striving for knowledge acquisition and striving for skill development. The main theme of the study was âRevising personal performance based on intellectual-experiential activitiesâ. Conclusions: Study findings suggest that Iranian clinical nurses continually revise their personal performance by performing self-directed intellectual and experiential activities to acquire expertise. The process of acquiring expertise is a linear process which includes two key steps of knowledge acquisition and knowledge development. In order to acquire and advance their knowledge, nurses perform mental learning activities such as sensory perception, self-evaluation, and suspended judgment step-by-step. Moreover, they develop their skills through doing activities like apprenticeship, masterly performance, and self-regulation. The absolute prerequisite to expertise acquisition is that a nurse needs to follow these two steps in a sequential manner.

In clinical practice, seizures in patients with Alzheimerâs disease can easily go unrecognised because they usually present as non-motor seizures, and can overlap with other symptoms of the disease. In patients with Alzheimerâs disease, seizures can hasten cognitive decline, highlighting the clinical relevance of early recognition and treatment. Some evidence indicates that subclinical epileptiform activity in patients with Alzheimerâs disease, detected by extended neurophysiological monitoring, can also lead to accelerated cognitive decline. Treatment of clinical seizures in patients with Alzheimerâs disease with select antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), in low doses, is usually well tolerated and efficacious. Moreover, studies in mouse models of Alzheimerâs disease suggest that certain classes of AEDs that reduce network hyperexcitability have disease-modifying properties. These AEDs target mechanisms of epileptogenesis involving amyloid Î² and tau. Clinical trials targeting network hyperexcitability in patients with Alzheimerâs disease will identify whether AEDs or related strategies could improve their cognitive symptoms or slow decline.

At the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, a Magnet-designated organization, extensive work has been conducted to incorporate nursing-related outcomes in the organization's quality plan and to integrate roles for clinical nurses into the Department of Nursing and organization's core performance-based programs. Content and strategies that promote active involvement of nurses and prepare them to be competent and confident stakeholders in quality initiatives are presented. Engaging clinical nurses in the work of quality and performance improvement is essential to achieving excellence in clinical care. It is important to have structures and processes in place to bring meaningful data to the bedside; however, it is equally important to incorporate outcomes into practice. When nurses are educated about performance and quality measures, are engaged in identifying outcomes and collecting meaningful data, are active participants in disseminating quality reports, and are able to recognize the value of these activities, data become one with practice.\n\nThe content of the work of clinical nurse specialists described by use of daily activity diaries.\n\nPubMed\n\nOddsdÃ³ttir, ElÃ­n JakobÃ­na; SveinsdÃ³ttir, HerdÃ­s\n\n2011-05-01\n\nEvaluate the usefulness of the role of clinical nurse specialists and the content of their work by mapping their activities. The clinical work of advanced practice nursing differs in different countries, and a clear picture is lacking on what exactly advanced practice nurses do. Prospective exploratory study. The setting of the study was the largest hospital in Iceland where over half of the country's active nursing workforce are employed, including the only clinical nurse specialists. Of 19 clinical nurse specialists working at the hospital, 15 participated. Data were collected over seven days with a structured activity diary that lists 65 activities, classified into six roles and three domains. In 17 instances, the 'role activities' and 'domain activities' overlap and form 17 categories of practice. The clinical nurse specialists coded their activities at 15-minutes interval and could code up to four activities simultaneously. Daily, the clinical nurse specialists evaluated their clinical nurse specialist background. The roles that occupied the greatest proportion of the clinical nurse specialists' time were education, expert practice and 'other' activities, while the smallest proportions were in counselling, research and practice development. The domain they worked in most was the institutional domain, followed by the client/family domain and the clinical outcome management domain. All of the clinical nurse specialists reported working on two activities simultaneously, 11 of them on three activities and six on four activities. They self-assessed their background as clinical nurse specialists as being very useful. The activity diary is a useful tool for assessing the content of practice. Clinical nurse specialists spend too much time on activities related to the institution. Nurse managers are advised to provide clinical nurse specialists with ample time to develop the direct practice role in the client/family domain.

Here, we describe the finding of remarkably high durability with the use of a novel support material. This material is based on hollow carbon nanocages developed with a high degree of graphitization and concurrent nitrogen doping for oxidation resistance enhancement, uniform deposition of fine Pt particles, and strong Pt-support interaction. Accelerated degradation testing shows that such designed catalyst possesses a superior electrochemical activity and long-term stability for both hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction relative to industry benchmarks of current catalysts. Further testing under conditions of practical fuel cell operation reveals almost no degradation over long-term cycling. Such a catalyst of high activity, particularly, high durability, opens the door for the next-generation PEMFC for \"real world\" application.\n\nCarbon nanocages: A new support material for Pt catalyst with remarkably high durability\n\nPubMed Central\n\nWang, Xiao Xia; Tan, Zhe Hua; Zeng, Min; Wang, Jian Nong\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLow durability is the major challenge hindering the large-scale implementation of proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) technology, and corrosion of carbon support materials of current catalysts is the main cause.

This survey aimed to describe the basics characteristics and clinical research activity among the Cancer Cooperative Groups (Groupes coopÃ©rateurs en oncologie). The second objective was to identify facilitators and barriers to their research activity. A questionnaire was sent to all the clinicians involved in 2014 as investigators in a clinical trial sponsored by one of the ten members of the Cancer Cooperative Groups network. The questions were related to their profile, research activity and the infrastructure existing within their healthcare center to support clinical research and related compliance activities. In total, 366 investigators responded to our survey. The academic clinical trials sponsored by the Cancer Cooperative Groups represented an important part of the research activity of the investigators in France in 2014. These academic groups contributed to the opening of many research sites throughout all regions in France. Factors associated with a higher participation of investigators (more than 10 patients enrolled in a trial over a year) include the existing support of healthcare professionals (more than 2 clinical research associate (CRA) OR=11.16 [3.82-32.6] compared to none) and the practice of their research activity in a University Hospital Center (CHU) rather than a Hospital Center (CH) (OR=2.15 [1.20-3.83]). This study highlighted factors that can strengthen investigator clinical research activities and subsequently improve patient access to evidence-based new cancer therapies in France.

To promote clinical use of PET, sociomedical evaluation is necessary. In this paper, sociomedical situations concerning clinical use of PET in Germany is reported. Some comparisons are made between Japan and this country putting emphases on several points such as 1) number of cyclotron and PET facilities, 2) social restriction to transportation of radioisotopes, 3) activities of satellite PET facilities, and 4) clinical indications for PET studies. Number of cyclotron was larger in Japan (29) than in Germany (17), but number of PET facilities was larger in Germany (47) than in Japan (29). The reason seems that in Germany transportation and buying of radioisotopes is less restricted. Hence, more than half of PET facilities in Germany are \"satellite facilities\" which do not have their own cyclotrons. Radioisotope distribution seems to serve as a backbone of \"satellite concept.\" Additionally in Germany, list of clinical indications for PET study is almost completed and now is widely in applied to most cases. To promote clinical use of PET in Japan, the German system might serve as an important socioeconomic model in Europe instead of the United States.\n\nPatient centered integrated clinical resource management.\n\nPubMed\n\nHofdijk, Jacob\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe impact of funding systems on the IT systems of providers has been enormous and have prevented the implementation of designs to focused on the health issue of patients. The paradigm shift the Dutch Ministry of Health has taken in funding health care has a remarkable impact on the orientation of IT systems design. Since 2007 the next step is taken: the application of the funding concept on chronic diseases using clinical standards as the norm. The focus on prevention involves the patient as an active partner in the care plan. The impact of the new dimension in funding has initiated a process directed to the development of systems to support collaborative working and an active involvement of the patient and its informal carers.

These contributions were all the more remarkable given the scientific and social times in which she worked. While Muriel is perhaps best known for her work on the life cycle and transmission of the African trypanosome, Trypanosoma brucei, which she carried out in Uganda at the height of a major Sleeping Sickness epidemic, her work on the Clostridia during the First and Second World Wars made significant contributions to the understanding of anaerobes and to the development of anti-toxoid vaccines, and her work on the immunology of Trichomonas foetus infections in cattle, carried out in collaboration with the veterinarian W. R. Kerr, resulted in changes in farming practices that very quickly eradicated trichomoniasis from cattle herds in Northern Ireland. The significance of her work was recognized with the award of Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947 and an Honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Glasgow, where she had earlier studied, in 1948.\n\nCLINICAL SURFACES - Activity-Based Computing for Distributed Multi-Display Environments in Hospitals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBardram, Jakob E.; Bunde-Pedersen, Jonathan; Doryab, Afsaneh; SÃ¸rensen, Steffen\n\nA multi-display environment (MDE) is made up of co-located and networked personal and public devices that form an integrated workspace enabling co-located group work. Traditionally, MDEs have, however, mainly been designed to support a single âsmart roomâ, and have had little sense of the tasks and activities that the MDE is being used for. This paper presents a novel approach to support activity-based computing in distributed MDEs, where displays are physically distributed across a large building. CLINICAL SURFACES was designed for clinical work in hospitals, and enables context-sensitive retrieval and browsing of patient data on public displays. We present the design and implementation of CLINICAL SURFACES, and report from an evaluation of the system at a large hospital. The evaluation shows that using distributed public displays to support activity-based computing inside a hospital is very useful for clinical work, and that the apparent contradiction between maintaining privacy of medical data in a public display environment can be mitigated by the use of CLINICAL SURFACES.\n\nA great pioneer of clinical science remembered: introduction to the special issue in honor of Paul E.

Porous carbons with high nitrogen content were obtained from the calcination of MOF after introducing an ionic liquid (IL) (IL@MOF) via the ship-in-bottle method. The MOF-derived carbons (MDCs) and IL@MOF-derived carbons (IMDCs) were characterized using various techniques and used for liquid-phase adsorptions in both water and hydrocarbon to understand the possible applications in purification of water and fuel, respectively. Adsorptive performances for the removal of organic contaminants, atrazine (ATZ), diuron, and diclofenac, were remarkably enhanced with the modification/conversion of MOFs to MDC and IMDC. For example, in the case of ATZ adsorption, the maximum adsorption capacity of IMDC (Q 0 = 208 m 2 /g) was much higher than that of activated carbon (AC, Q 0 = 60 m 2 /g) and MDC (Q 0 = 168 m 2 /g) and was found to be the highest among the reported results so far. The results of adsorptive denitrogenation and desulfurization of fuel were similar to that of water purification. The IMDCs are very useful in the adsorptions since these new carbons showed remarkable performances in both the aqueous and nonaqueous phases. These results are very meaningful because hydrophobic and hydrophilic adsorbents are usually required for the adsorptions in the water and fuel phases, respectively. Moreover, a plausible mechanism, H-bonding, was also suggested to explain the remarkable performance of the IMDCs in the adsorptions. Therefore, the IMDCs derived from IL@MOF might have various applications, especially in adsorptions, based on high porosity, mesoporosity, doped nitrogen, and functional groups.\n\nClinical trial network for the promotion of clinical research for rare diseases in Japan: muscular dystrophy clinical trial network.\n\nPubMed\n\nShimizu, Reiko; Ogata, Katsuhisa; Tamaura, Akemi; Kimura, En; Ohata, Maki; Takeshita, Eri; Nakamura, Harumasa; Takeda, Shin'ichi; Komaki, Hirofumi\n\n2016-07-11\n\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most commonly inherited neuromuscular disease. Therapeutic agents for the treatment of rare disease, namely \"orphan drugs\", have recently drawn the attention of researchers and pharmaceutical companies. To ensure the successful conduction of clinical trials to evaluate novel treatments for patients with rare diseases, an appropriate infrastructure is needed. One of the effective solutions for the lack of infrastructure is to establish a network of rare diseases. To accomplish the conduction of clinical trials in Japan, the Muscular dystrophy clinical trial network (MDCTN) was established by the clinical research group for muscular dystrophy, including the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, as well as national and university hospitals, all which have a long-standing history of research cooperation. Thirty-one medical institutions (17 national hospital organizations, 10 university hospitals, 1 national center, 2 public hospitals, and 1 private hospital) belong to this network and collaborate to facilitate clinical trials.
