        "text": "I've been working on my trim and breathing techniques in the water to lower my SAC rate and I've got it down to .497 cu ft/ min, my question is, when is your SAC rate considered too low?\n\nYou're looking for a \"number\" answer. Well, SAC rates are going to vary from diver to diver. Some experienced divers while stationary (such as during a safety or deco stop) have SAC rates that can get down in the 0.3 cuft/min range. Divers with larger lung volumes will typically have higher SAC rates, e.g., all other things be equal, a large man might have a higher SAC rate than a small woman.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases (healthy individuals), the SAC rate is too low when one shows physiological signs of inadequate ventilation. One of the most common signs of this is the post-dive headache caused by skip breathing (CO2 retention). Know that some individuals have adapted to higher levels of CO2 in the blood which alters blood pH and can induce physiological changes in respiration and/or metabolism. These changes can initiate/potentiate narcosis. These individuals should take precautions against physical over-exertion during a dive.\n\nAs a newer diver, I wouldn't get too hung up on SAC rate. The danger is that you'll be more prone to skip breathe. Instead, just try to relax more. Streamline your gear. Achieve horizontal trim. Take your time. Hover whenever you can. Your consumption is...whatever it turns out to be. Take this into account in your gas planning. If you need more gas, get a bigger tank.\n\nAs BT is saying, too much emphasis on SAC can quickly get you into trouble. There is another thread currently running discussing the same issue where you can get details.\n\nAlso, a SAC is never a fixed number, but is usually fairly consistent based on the dives you do. For example in doubles and a stage in a high flow cave where a fair amount of swimming effort is needed, I can plan on my SAC being right around .65 cu ft per minute, and this is consistent from dive to dive per the average depth function of my computer and the gas used. In a low flow cave, it will be closer .60. On my deco stops I plan on a resting SAC of about .4, although on longer deco where I really relax it will drop close to .3.\n\nIt is important to note here that I am also not trying to stretch my gas but rather I am ensuring I stay efficient yet well ventilated to keep CO2 levels down.\n\nWhen you say your SAC is .497, it really means nothing without also providing the general context. Some people will sit in front of the television and breathe of a reg, then claim a SAC somehwere around .2 and imply it is somethig special. Not really. It is also almost impossible to scale up to a real dive.\n\nSimilarly, some divers may do a resting SAC in the water, but again it tells you very little, except maybe what you might expect on a deco stop.\n\nA swimming SAC works better, but how you set it up is important. Ideally, you will swim at a steady pace and a steady depth for 5 minutes to get into a steady balanced state regarding your metabolism, CO2 production etc, then note your SPG pressure a depth and the time to the second, and then maintain that depth for 5 to 10 minutes while continuing to swim at the same steady pace. The longer the swim the better, and the deeper the depth the better as both help to give you a more accurate calculation.\n\nThen note the end time and the end pressure and crunch the numbers for the gas used perminute that that depth.\n\nYou can also run trials at different workloads to see how that impacts your SAC. That works much better than taking a resting SAC and trying to scale it up with wild ass guess constants like 1.5, 2.0 etc.\n\nIdeally, you will also have a computer or bottom timer with an average depth function. That along wqith careful recording of start and end pressures and notes on the dive will let you develop a very accurate picture of your SAC under different real world conditions.\n\nI've been working on my trim and breathing techniques in the water to lower my SAC rate\n\nWhy? What is your goal?\n\nI don't ask this to be facetious, but if your goal is to make your air last as long as most people, you are probably already there.\n\nIf your goal is to stay down as long as more experienced buddies, you will probably get there just by diving more and learning to relax.\n\nIf/when you do get your SAC down below average, then, unless you are a solo diver, your bottom time will be limited by other divers.\n\nFor most of us, a low SAC just means you will end most dives with lots of unused air left in your tank."
