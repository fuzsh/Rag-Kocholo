        "text": "Retin Obasohan selected the top Belgian playing abroad in last week's games\n\nTraditionally, every week we bring you a list of the top performances of Belgians who are currently playing abroad.\n\nRetin Obasohan\n\n#1. This week's number one is former international guard Retin Obasohan (189-1993, college: Alabama, currently plays in Israel). He was the major contributor in a 1-point Hapoel Jerusalem's victory against the closely-ranked Bnei Hasharon (11-7) 89-88 in the Israeli Winner League in Monday night's game. Obasohan recorded 24 points, 5 rebounds and 3 assists in 36 minutes on the court; quite an impressive performance considering it's only his first season in pro basketball. It was the game of the round between two top 4 ranked teams. Hapoel Bank Yahav Jerusalem (13-6) is placed first in the Winner League. It was his team's fourth consecutive victory in a row. There are only two games left until the end of the Regular Season. So now every game will be critical. Obasohan has individually a very good year with high stats. He averages: 18.3ppg, 4.3rpg, 4.8apg, 1.4spg, 2FGP: 45.0%, 3FGP: 46.7%(35-75) and FT: 80.7% in 19 games he played so far. Obasohan has a dual citizenship: Belgian and Nigerian. He played for the Belgian senior national team year ago.\n\nIsmael Bako\n\n#2. Second place goes to former international center Ismael Bako (208-1995, currently plays in Basketball Champions League). Bako managed to help BAXI Manresa to win against the fourth-ranked Treviso (0-4) crushing them 108-88 in the Basketball Champions League last Thursday. He recorded 5 points and grabbed 10 rebounds. BAXI Manresa (3-1) is placed second in group J. It was his team's third consecutive victory in a row. There are only two games left until the end of the Basketball Champions League Top 16. So now every game is very crucial. Bako's overall stats this season are: 9.3ppg, 7.2rpg, 1.1apg, 1.1bpg, 2FGP: 58.8%(30-51) and FT: 77.4%. He played for the Belgian national team in 22.\n\nJean Salumu\n\n#3. The Belgian player who performed third best last week abroad was former international shooting guard Jean Salumu (193-1990, currently plays in France). Salumu could not help Chalons-Reims (1-1) in their last game. Despite his very good performance Chalons-Reims lost 77-86 at home to the lower-ranked (#7) Pau-Lacq-Orthez. Salumu was the top scorer with 22 points. He also added 3 passes in 34 minutes. This year Salumu's overall stats are: 7.0ppg, 1.2rpg, 2FGP: 70.8%(17-24), 3FGP: 22.0% and FT: 78.9% in 13 games. He played for the Belgian national team year ago.\n\nAndy Van Vliet\n\n#4. Power forward Andy Van Vliet (213-1995, college: William & Mary, currently plays in Israel) faced previously mentioned Retin Obasohan in the Israeli Winner League last game. Van Vliet was not able to help Bnei Hasharon (11-7) in their last game on Monday. Despite his good performance Bnei Hasharon was edged 89-88 on the road by the leading Hapoel Jerusalem. Van Vliet recorded 14 points. There are only two games left until the end of the Regular Season. So now every game will be important. Van Vliet has relatively good stats this season: 11.8ppg, 5.2rpg, 1.6apg and 1.2bpg. He used to play for the Belgian national team back in 22.\n\nOrdane Kanda-Kanyinda\n\n#5. Former international point guard Ordane Kanda-Kanyinda (186-1996, currently plays in Lithuania) led Mazeikiai to a victory over the fifth-ranked Kretinga (10-28) crushing them 101-47 in the Lithuanian NKL (second division) last Saturday. Kanda-Kanyinda was MVP of the game. He scored 20 points, grabbed 4 rebounds and dished 8 assists in 30 minutes. Ereliai Mazeikiai (14-22) is placed third in Places 8-14 group. There are only three games left until the end of the Second Stage. So now every game will be extremely important. This year Kanda-Kanyinda's total stats are: 8.2ppg, 1.6rpg, 3.4apg and 1.3spg in 10 games. He used to play for the Belgian national team years ago.\n\nEmmanuel Lecomte\n\n#6. Point guard Emmanuel Lecomte (180-1995, college: Baylor, currently plays in Lithuania) was not able to secure a victory for Jonava (10-11) in their game against Zalgiris (4-2) in the Lithuanian LKL. Despite his good performance on Sunday night Lecomte was the second best scorer with 12 points. He also added 6 assists. This season Lecomte has very high stats. He averages: 15.6ppg, 2.6rpg and 4.8apg. Lecomte is a former international player as he played for the Belgian senior team year ago.\n\nQuentin Serron\n\n#7. Former international guard Quentin Serron (190-1990, currently plays in France) couldn't help Boulazac Basket (3-2) in their game against ALM Evreux (11-12) in the French ProB (second division), despite his very good performance in Tuesday night's game. He was the second best scorer with 15 points. Serron also added 5 passes in 34 minutes. But Boulazac Basket lost 69-77 in Evreux to the much lower-ranked (#10) ALM Evreux. Serron has averaged so far 8.2ppg, 3.3rpg, 3.8apg and 1.3spg in 21 games. He used to play for the Belgian national team years ago.\n\nToumani Camara\n\n#8.
