        "text": "Just 10 days into the season, it’s far too early to be panicking. But it’s not too early to test the trade value of the players on your roster who are off to blistering hot starts. Those are the two main themes of this week’s column, in which we take a look at 10 notably fast and notably slow starts around the league.\n\nFast Starts\n\nKlay Thompson (27.0 ppg, 2.3 rpg, 2.5 apg, 1.3 spg, 1.0 bpg, 3.3 3s, 53.7 percent from the field)\n\nKlay has stepped on the gas like Ricky Bobby with a bag of cereal taped to the bottom of his car. And if you drafted him, you have every right to be wearing a very obnoxious grin on your face right now. Bottom line: Thompson looks great. With that said, I still think you’re potentially looking at a sell-high moment. There’s so much buzz around the Warriors right now, and ultimately I expect Thompson’s scoring average to creep closer to the low-20’s as opposed to the upper-20’s (his progression in points has been 12.5 -- > 16.6 -- > 18.4 over his first three years, and it’s much easier to envision something closer to the 20-22 ppg range). And when you add in low rebound and assist totals, plus the fact that he may not keep blocking shots at this rate (career: 0.5 bpg), selling high is something to consider. And that’s all it is, something to consider. There’s nothing wrong at all with keeping him all year; I just think it’s worth taking a gander around your league to see what you could get for him.\n\nDeron Williams (17.5 ppg, 7.3 apg, 0.8 spg, 1.3 3s, 39 minutes per game)\n\nSo far, the Lionel Hollins era in Brooklyn has rejuvenated Williams and Joe Johnson (22.0 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 4.3 apg, 2.0 3s), and to be honest, my only major concern here is how much Williams is playing. He has missed an average of 13 games the last four seasons, and while it’s easily possible for a 30-year-old to bounce back and stay fully healthy, I’d explore the trade market to see if Williams can be dealt for a productive player who’s more durable.\n\nEditor's Note: Rotoworld's partner FanDuel is hosting a one-day $175,000 Fantasy Basketball league for Friday's NBA games. It's $25 to join and first prize is $15,000. Starts at 7pm ET on Friday. Here's the FanDuel link.\n\nAlso: You can follow me on Twitter here, and check out all the exclusive content in the Rotoworld Season Pass right here.\n\nTobias Harris (17.8 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 1.2 spg, 0.6 bpg, 0.6 3s)\n\nNo contract extension before the deadline means added motivation for Harris, who appears to be set up for good times on the court this season. In addition to the points, boards and steals, I’m cautiously encouraged by his shot-blocking – after not posting a block in his first two games, Harris has recorded a block in three straight, giving some hope that he can approach 1.0 bpg for the first time since 2012-13, when he averaged 1.4 bpg in 27 games for the Magic.\n\nDerrick Favors (18.4 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.2 spg, 1.6 bpg, 60.7 percent from the field)\n\nNot all of my preseason favorites have panned out (see Trey Burke below), but things are going flat-out splendidly for Favors so far. As is the case with Harris, I’m not actively trying to sell high here. At age 23, and already in his fifth year in the league, the breakout is in full effect for Favors, who’s more likely to keep traveling at this speed than slow down.\n\nBrandon Knight (18.4 ppg, 7.2 rpg, 7.2 apg, 2.0 spg, 1.6 3s, 40.8 percent from the field)\n\nI am of two minds on this one. On the one hand, it seems unlikely that Knight can keep up this pace, especially in rebounds and steals. I just don’t see it. However, he does have a coach who was pretty good at posting dynamic all-around lines, and Knight himself did average 17.9 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 4.9 apg, 1.0 spg and 1.5 3s last year. Taking everything into consideration, I would certainly deal him if the right offer came along, but I have no problem holding onto Knight and just enjoying the production. Milwaukee’s rotation is somewhat of a mess at other positions, but there’s clarity right now at point guard, and I can see Knight being a strong contributor all year long.\n\nSlow Starts\n\nCarmelo Anthony (19.6 ppg, 4.0 rpg, 4.4 apg, 0.6 spg, 0.0 bpg, 1.2 3s, 40.6 percent from the field)\n\nAs bad starts go it could be worse, and to me there’s actually one encouraging stat here: 4.4 apg. That would be a career-high for Melo, and if he can maintain that while cranking up his scoring (27.4), rebounding (8.1), steals (1.2) and blocks (0.7) closer to last year’s levels, then we’ve got something glorious going on. Bottom line: The adjustment to the triangle is clearly taking some time, but I’d stay patient if you have Melo on your roster, and absolutely try to buy low if the owner in your league is impatient. This is a buy-low window that could slam shut very quickly.\n\nDerrick Rose (15.3 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 5.3 apg, 1.3 spg, 1.3 3s in 26 minutes per game)\n\nEvery time I look at a roster where I drafted Rose, I ask myself what I was thinking. It was a trap, and I knew it was a trap, but I still walked into it. However, as impatient and frustrated as we all may be, this is not the time to trade him away. Doing so would be a classic case of under-selling a player with top-20 potential. I like to think of it like this: If I’m really eager to deal a player, and really sick of having him on my roster, everyone else in my league probably feels the same way. I won’t argue with ridding yourself of the headache once Rose gets it going – and I’ll certainly be trying to do that myself – but Rose is still highly capable of posting big lines, and we’d be wise to wait for a few of those before we start making offers.\n\nKenneth Faried (10.8 ppg, 9.5 rpg, 2.3 apg, 0.3 spg, 0.8 bpg)\n\nBad times all around for Faried and the Nuggets offense, which as of Friday had a leading scorer (Ty Lawson) averaging 12.5 ppg. But it’s not like Faried has shown us nothing this year – he started the season with 22 points, 17 boards and four assists in just 28 minutes, and has basically had two bad games along with two good ones. Furthermore, his 9.5 rpg and 2.3 apg are both above his career-best. All things considered, I would absolutely try to get him in a trade if you think that’s an option in your league.\n\nLuol Deng (13.0 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 1.2 apg, 1.2 spg, 0.4 bpg, 0.4 3s, 49.0 percent from the field)\n\nI mentioned my concerns about Deng’s declining production prior to the season, and though I’d ultimately expect him to end up closer to 15 ppg, I don’t have high hopes for the rest of his numbers and would not be trying to pick him up in a trade.\n\nTrey Burke (10.0 ppg, 4.2 apg, 1.2 spg, 0.6 bpg, 0.8 3s on 33.3 percent from the field)\n\nFirst, the bad news: Burke has been been awful. And 19-year-old Dante Exum has looked like the more explosive player when he’s been on the court. Now, a small measure of consolation: Burke’s offensive game begins (and mostly ends) with his outside shot. Through his first four games, it was not falling at all (2-of-17 on 3s). But in his last game, he hit 2-of-5 3s, finishing with six points, three boards, two assists, a steal and two blocks in 23 minutes (and likely would have gotten more run had he not gotten into some foul trouble). As I said, it’s a small measure of consolation, and it certainly could get worse for Burke before it gets better. However, he only needs a game or two of hot shooting to get back to what he was doing in the preseason (15.9 ppg, 5.4 apg, 0.9 spg and 2.4 3s on 46.2 percent shooting), and while I am concerned about one of my favorite late-round players, I haven’t given up on a Burke breakout just yet.\n\nRandom Thoughts, Part 1: Terrence Jones (14.0 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 1.0 spg, 1.8 bpg, 0.8 3s) has been inconsistent game-to-game, but overall is looking like the breakout player we hoped he’d be. It’s not the worst idea to see if his two-game absence due to a bruised leg has made the fantasy owner in your league a little bit impatient. … So far so good for Darren Collison, who has averaged 15.0 ppg, 4.2 rpg, 6.8 apg and 2.0 spg in 35 minutes per game, all well above his career-highs. My concern is that eventually Ramon Sessions and/or Ray McCallum will start to get more run and knock Collison down closer to the 30 mpg range. I don’t think he’ll fall off dramatically, but I’ll take the under on all the stats listed above. … Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (bruised ribs) has played two full games this season. In those games, he has averaged 14.0 ppg, 10.0 rpg and 1.5 bpg. It’s way too soon to declare that he has fixed his offensive issues, but he’s absolutely a player I want on my rosters to see how it plays out.\n\nRandom Thoughts, Part 2: Elfrid Payton is and will likely continue to be a percentage destroyer (34.1 from the field, 45.0 from the line), but it’s great to see his all-around game translating immediately to the NBA (last three games: 11.0 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 7.0 apg, 2.3 spg, 0.7 bpg). … It’s too early to give up on Kelly Olynyk, who got benched against the Rockets, but has still posted 12.5 ppg, 7.0 rpg, 1.3 spg and 1.0 3s in just 25 minutes per game. … After a rough first couple of games, Andrew Wiggins’ last two outings have been encouraging: 12.5 ppg, 5.0 rpg, 1.5 spg, 1.0 bpg and 0.5 3s in 34 minutes per game. … Meanwhile, these are not fun times for Jabari Parker, who has yet to block a shot and is just 2-of-8 on 3s through his first five games. The points (10.0) and rebounds (6.8) should improve sooner rather than later, but expecting a consistent all-around stat line from Parker this year is not looking realistic. … Stay patient with Paul Millsap. The Hawks have still only played three games heading into the weekend, and Millsap dropped a season-high 17 points with seven boards, three assists, five steals and two blocks on Wednesday. And he is still attempting 3s – he just happens to have started off 1-of-7 on the season.\n\nThrowback Box Score of the Week\n\nFifteen years ago this Saturday (Nov. 8, 1999), Nuggets PG Nick Van Exel dropped 23 points, four rebounds, 20 assists, two steals and two 3s on a deeply depressing edition of my beloved Hawks.\n\nAlso of note in that game: Raef LaFrentz had 24 points, six boards, two 3s and five blocks for Denver, while my least-favorite Hawk of all time (Isaiah Rider) led Atlanta with 28. This was also the fourth career game for a rookie PG named Jason Terry, who scored 12 points in 23 minutes off the bench while not doing a good job guarding the likes of Nick Van Exel.\n\nIn Closing…\n\nThe Sixers are very very bad, but if nothing else, at least they gave us this."
