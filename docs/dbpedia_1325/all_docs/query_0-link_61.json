He was born in Sombor, Yugoslavia. He received his forestry education at the University of Zagreb, where he also obtained his Ph.D. in Forest Genetics in 1964. On an American Fellowship, he studied poplar breeding and cultivation in Italy and France. His scientific work on poplar genetics and breeding started at the Poplar Research Institute in Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, and was later continued with a Post-Doctoral Fellowship at the Faculty of Forestry, University of Toronto (1966–1967). In 1967, he joined the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources as a Research Scientist, and was instrumental in setting up an active poplar research and breeding program in the Province of Ontario. Louis returned to the Faculty of Forestry, University of Toronto, as a Professor in 1984. The University provided a unique forum where he was able to link his outstanding scientific experience with the advanced education and research of a new generation of young professionals and scientists. There he supervised the research of three Post-Doctoral Fellows, 13 Ph.D. and 14 Masters students. During his career, Louis has authored over 150 publications. His enthusiasm for his work on poplars and willows has always been infectious. 100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\nLouis Zsuffa’s expertise has been sought by international development agencies for developing countries. Thus, he has given special lectures and participated in collaborative projects in China, India, Costa Rica, Malaysia, and Nepal. He is a founding member of the Poplar Council of Canada. He has served in executive positions on the International Poplar Commission of FAO, the Biomass Energy Agreement of the International Energy Agency, the Poplar Council of Canada, and the International Union of Forest Research Organizations.

He was a nominee for the prestigious Marcus Wallenberg Prize in Sweden. Louis Zsuffa has dedicated his professional life to poplar and willow culture. As an individual, Louis has always been a kind, gentle, and generous person, showing support and understanding to students and colleagues alike. He continues to enjoy the support and companionship of his wife Mara.

Throughout the ages, people have capitalized on the diverse characteristics of the many species and clones that make up the genus Populus — their rapid growth, ease of reproduction by vegetative means, and widespread natural occurrence. These characteristics have led to the many valuable economic and environmental uses that have been found for poplar trees and poplar wood — pulp and paper, panel products, lumber, shelter for farm crops, streamside protection and erosion control, and, most recently, phytoremediation and treatment of wastes. Thus, it is not surprising that poplars were among the first trees to be cultivated. Poplar culture began in Asia but is practiced now wherever poplars are found naturally or will grow, on all six continents.\n\n0\n\nLike any other plant or animal that has been found useful, humanity has tried to improve the utility of poplars through breeding. Most poplars are particularly amenable to breeding and genetic improvement efforts due to their characteristics of early sexual maturity, relative ease of crossing, and ease of reproduction by vegetative means. In recent years, Populus has also become a model genus for research on plant molecular genetics and the implementation of advances in woody plant biotechnology. North America is blessed with extensive natural resources of trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides). There are also a number of other native poplars which are easily cultivated and have been extensively hybridized amongst themselves and with related poplars from Europe and Asia. Poplar culture has been firmly established in North America for more than 100 years. Some of the front-line technological advances in poplar breeding, improvement, and utilization are still taking place in the United States and Canada.\n\n100\n\nHowever, poplar culture is a specialized science and art, requiring careful understanding and attention to clonal characteristics, site conditions, and specific cultural practices if the desired growth and benefits are to be achieved. Diseases and insect pests are a constant threat that can quickly reverse the gains of genetic improvement. Identification and control of the numerous poplar clones can be a poplar grower’s nightmare.\n\n95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nThis book is intended to gather under one cover important source information about North American poplars for the benefit of poplar growers and scientists. It provides perspectives on the current state and future prospects of all aspects of poplar culture and use in North America. As such, it updates and considerably\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\nxii\n\n0\n\n0\n\n12 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\front pages.vp Thursday, November 08, 2001 8:31:51 AM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPreface 95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\n95\n\nexpands the scope of the 1983 Michigan State University publication, The culture of poplars in eastern North America by Donald I. Dickmann and Katherine W. Stuart. The core of that publication and of the present volume is an introduction to the genus Populus, poplar breeding strategies, and the ecology and silviculture of poplar plantations. Included in the expanded scope is discussion of the physiological ecology of poplars, the ecology and silviculture of natural stands of poplars, particularly trembling aspen, the environmental benefits of using poplars for windbreaks, phytoremediation, and urban planting, and the properties and utilization of poplar wood. Expanded treatment is given to insect pests and poplar diseases. Nearly 50 descriptions of commercial poplar clones and cultivars are included as well as a key to Populus species and major hybrids.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\nThe present volume complements the 1996 National Research Council of Canada publication, Biology of Populus and its implications for management and conservation, edited by R.F. Stettler, H.D. Bradshaw, Jr., P.E. Heilman, and T.M. Hinckley. That book presents recent advances in our fundamental understanding of the biology of poplars and interprets the relevance of the research findings to practical aspects of poplar culture and conservation. In the present volume, the editors have focused on the practical side, in an effort to offer relevant information on how to grow and use poplars, with sufficient background on the supporting science that poplar growers and scientists alike can benefit. The 21st Session of the International Poplar Commission (IPC) — a subsidiary body of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations — was held in western North America in September 2000, with more than 250 participants from 31 countries. The IPC was established in 1947 to promote and coordinate the breeding, cultivation, management, and utilization of poplars and willows. The theme of the 21st Session (IPC 2000), ‘Poplar and willow culture: Meeting the needs of society and the environment,’ inspired the publication of a volume that would showcase the current status of the poplar sector on this continent and document succinctly the scientific and technological advances that have been made.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nThe editors are deeply indebted to the generosity of the Canadian Forest Service, Natural Resources Canada, for providing the funding to make this publication possible, and to the United States Forest Service for its strong support of the project. The Poplar Council of the United States and the Poplar Council of Canada / Conseil du peuplier du Canada, both voluntary, nonprofit organizations dedicated to the goals of IPC within their respective countries, have given valuable support and encouragement. Many colleagues provided constructive criticism of drafts of individual chapters.

Dickmann\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nIntroduction The subject of this book — the genus Populus, collectively known as the poplars — comprises a singular group of trees. Because they are ubiquitous in the Northern Hemisphere, extremely useful, and possess unique characteristics unmatched by any other temperate tree genus, almost everyone has some knowledge or opinion about poplars. Unfortunately, certain poplar attributes are considered less than stellar. Therefore, these trees invoke a range of sentiments among people that reaches from the sacred to the profane. On the one hand, poplars have been treated with reverence and esteem. The white poplar (P. alba) was linked with the Greek mythological deities Hercules and Persephone. A poplar tree cured Hercules of his serpent bite. The indigenous people of North America regarded poplars as powerful and sacred medicine trees (Altman 1994; Moerman 1998). Because of their attractive looks or striking stature, poplars have been planted for millennia throughout the world as decorative ornamentals or as line plantings. They have been depicted in ink or impressionistic pastels by great artists such as van Gogh, Monet, and Cézanne (Fig. 1). Poets have immortalized them in romantic verse. Scientifically, Populus is among the most-studied and most-written-about tree genera. The wood of poplar is highly versatile and prized by the wood-products industry. The exceptionally fast growth rate of poplars amazes people, and this trait, among others, has led to their extensive use in wood-producing plantations and windbreaks. On the other hand, poplars have a defective, even sinister, side. In Christian legend, aspen (P. tremula) is the tree from which the cross of Jesus was hewn. Then, to make matters worse, Judas Iscariot allegedly hanged himself on an aspen. This considerable disgrace cursed the tree to shudder and tremble ever afterward. The bite of this curse is lessened, however, because several other tree species also are implicated in these infamous events. Whatever the truth, this superstition was so powerful that 19th-century lumberjacks in the Great Lakes Region refused to 100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n100\n\n95\n\nD.I. Dickmann.

Poplars — especially hybrids — are often regarded as “junk trees” because of their short life span, susceptibility to breakage, and predisposition to diseases and insect damage. Hucksters of “bargain” nursery plants sell unfit hybrid poplar varieties to the public via gaudy Sunday-supplement ads, reinforcing the junk-tree image. The handbook Weeds of the Northeast lists cottonwood (P. deltoides) among the other noxious plant competitors of the region (Uva et al. 1997). Timber companies spray poplars that volunteer in their conifer plantations with herbicides. Because of their messy habits, many municipalities have passed ordinances banning the planting of poplar trees. One author refers to them as “plebeian” (Rogers 1917).\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:21:59 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1. An overview of the genus Populus 95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n95\n\nSo there is a yin to balance each yang. In this book, however, the authors embrace the yang, extolling the positive side of poplars and emphasizing their multifarious benefits. We are unashamedly enthusiastic about poplars, and we strongly feel that if their limitations are recognized, their many virtues can be employed to wonderful effect.\n\n5\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nWhat’s in a name? All true poplars are members of the genus Populus. The origin of this generic Latin name is an interesting study in linguistics and the blurred roots of plant nomenclature. Populus is said to be derived from the early Roman expression arbor populi, meaning “the people’s tree,” because poplars were frequently planted in public places and meetings were held beneath them (Rupp 1990). In fact, the Latin word populus is defined as “a multitude, host, crowd, throng, a great number of persons or things; the people.” Other versions of the root of Populus have been proposed based on ancient Greek or Latin usage (Rupp 1990; Edlin 1963), but they are more fanciful than etymologically correct. The common English name “poplar,” a derivative of its Latin appellation, seems to be one of the few common tree names to be shared, in different forms, by several other modern European tongues. It is peuplier in French, populier in Dutch, Pappel in German, poppel in Danish, poppeli in Finnish, poplys in Welsh, and pioppo in Italian. In some parts of North America, the related “popple” is colloquially used for aspen, perhaps because of the tendency of the wood to pop and spark when burned. In the southeastern U.S., however, the name poplar is equivocal because there it usually refers to yellow or tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera). Furthermore, if you buy “poplar” wood at a lumber store anywhere, yellow poplar is what you will get. True poplar wood usually is marketed under the name “aspen” or “cottonwood.”\n\n100\n\nThe idea of constant motion, referring to the well-known tendency of leaves to noisily flutter in the slightest breeze, is a trait most people associate with poplars. Besides the normal common name, various colloquialisms applied to poplars reflect this trait (Harlow 1957). For example, one Gaelic name for European aspen is crann critheach, or “the shaking tree.” Aspen’s Welsh folkname — coed tafod merched — means “tree of the woman’s tongue.” The Greeks also shared this simile for a poplar leaf. New World people were not to be outdone in this regard; the Acadian refugees in Louisiana called their local poplar langues de femmes. Finally, the Onondaga Indian name for the North-American quaking aspen is NutKi-e, meaning “noisy leaf.”\n\n95\n\n75\n\n100\n\n95\n\nThis characteristic leafy motion, an effect produced by the airfoil-like flattened petiole displayed by most members of the genus, has not been lost on poets seeking inspiration. The sight and sound of the wind rippling a poplar canopy can conjure powerful romantic images in the mind of those so inclined. A few examples\n\n25\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n3\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n3 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:21:59 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPoplar Culture in North America 95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nwill make the point. In Act II of the ever-popular comic operetta The Pirates of Penzance, librettist William S. Gilbert conveyed a romantic reversal of fortune using a poplar metaphor. Composer Arthur Sullivan set the scene to music.\n\n25\n\n25\n\nAnd the brook, in rippling measure, Laughs for very love, While the poplars, in their pleasure, Wave their arms above.\n\n5\n\n0\n\n75\n\n5\n\n0\n\nBut a few stanzas later the mood has changed: Pretty brook, thy dream is over, For thy love is but a rover! Sad the lot of poplar trees, Courted by the fickle breeze!\n\nPoplars figure prominently among the trees in A Shropshire Lad, the classic collection of verses published in 1896 by Alfred Edward Housman. For example, these stanzas from poem LII allude to the poet’s roots in the English countryside: Far in a western brookland That bred me long ago The poplars stand and tremble By pools I used to know.\n\nA far more grim but no-less romantic take on people and poplars is conveyed in poem XXVI, which begins with these lines: Along the fields as we came by A year ago, my love and I, The aspen over stile and stone Was talking to itself alone.\n\nThen again in the second stanza: And sure enough beneath the tree There walks another love with me, And overhead the aspen heaves Its rainy-sounding silver leaves;\n\n100\n\nContemporary poets do not slight poplars. Seamus Heaney’s 1996 collection Spirit Level included these lines from a short poem entitled “The Poplar”: Wind shakes the big poplar, quicksilvering The whole tree in a single sweep.\n\n95\n\n75\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nNow we must make the transition from rhyme to reality. The two sections that follow will discuss poplars in general, the current classification of the genus, and each currently recognized species.

To avoid clutter, individual attributions to these references will not be given in the text. Scientific papers, articles, or books that present something new or from which data are taken, however, will be cited individually.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\nGeneral characteristics of poplars Poplars are all deciduous or (rarely) semi-evergreen forest trees with a wide distribution in the Northern Hemisphere, from the tropics to the northern latitudinal limits of tree growth. Stem form is characteristically tall and straight (excurrent), but even within a species stems of individuals or clones can be multiply branched (deliquescent) or twisted and convoluted (Fig. 2). Poplars are short-lived compared to other trees such as white pine, oaks, or Douglas fir, in large measure because they are host to many diseases and insect pests. Nonetheless, the fast growth rate of poplars often enables them to reach large size. The characteristic cottonwoods of eastern North America (P. deltoides) and the Pacific Northwest (P. trichocarpa), for example, can become enormous trees. The cell nucleus of poplars contains two sets of 19 (2n = 38) chromosomes; rarely, triploid plants with three sets of chromosomes (3n = 57) are found. The physical size of the Populus genome is remarkably small — 6 times smaller than maize and 40 times smaller than loblolly pine. In addition, the favorable ratio between genetic length and physical length in Populus chromosomes makes the genus an attractive choice for genetic mapping and cloning of genes of special importance to forest trees (Bradshaw 2000).\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nAll of the taxa in the genus are dioecious. Individual trees bear either male (pollen-bearing) or female (seed-producing) flowers, both of which are borne on pendant catkins (Fig. 3). Occasionally, some trees will produce a small number of bisexual catkins. In most populations of poplar, male and female trees tend to be approximately equal in number, but there are exceptions. In the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, for example, female aspen trees predominate at low elevation, but at high elevations nearly all trees are male (Mitton and Grant 1996). Generally, male trees tend to be more precocious, producing more catkins per tree, but — at least in aspen — female trees grow faster than males. Emergence of the male and female catkins precedes the flush of leaves in the spring; in aspens, flowers appear at the very first hint of spring (Fig. 3A). After wind pollination, the fruit — an elongated cluster of capsules sometimes likened to a necklace — quickly matures. Ripe capsules split into two, three, or four parts, and the tiny, cottony seeds take to the air (Fig. 3B). Old trees can produce over 50 million seeds in a single season. Because the cotton is regarded as a nuisance, male trees are preferred for\n\n25\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n5 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:00 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPoplar Culture in North America 95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nFig. 2. The form of mature poplar trees varies, depending upon the genetic makeup of a tree and the environment in which it is growing.

There is no poplar leaf archetype. Leaves always are simple, never compound, but they may be narrow or lanceolate, maple-like, round, oblong, deltoid, heart-shaped, or rhombic; they may be longer than wide, wider than long, or equal in both dimensions (Fig. 4). Even on the same tree, leaves may differ considerably in shape; early-season leaves that are preformed in the bud often are distinctly different than leaves initiated during the growing season. Petioles vary in length from less than 1 cm to nearly 10 cm. Autumn coloration of poplar leaves generally is yellow or pale gold, although some western clones of P. tremuloides turn bright orange. In a mountainous setting, this marvelous though short-lived splash of color is a major scenic attraction.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0\n\n6 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:01 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1.

Large branches tend to be brittle and are easily broken off by strong winds, wet snow, or ice. In many species, small branches are abscised in a process not dissimilar to autumn leaf abscission, a trait unique to poplars. Poplar bark, which can be creamy white, various shades of gray, olive green, orange–brown, or bronze in color, often remains smooth for many years, especially in the aspens. Lenticels are prominent on the young bark (Fig. 5A). On older trees, the lower bark breaks up into coarse, corky ridges. In cottonwoods, these ridges may extend well up into the crown (Fig. 5B). 100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nPoplars are major invaders of disturbed sites, but the ecological habitats occupied by the various taxa in the genus break rather cleanly into two categories. Many poplar species typically grow in riparian or wet habitats, ranging from the far northern boreal latitudes to the tropics (Fig. 6A). In wetlands, they are adapted to seasonal flooding or high water table conditions, and their seeds find a favorable environment for germination on the fresh silt or sand left when the water recedes. In contrast, upland habitats are the major province of the aspen and white poplars\n\n25\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n7\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n7 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:03 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPoplar Culture in North America 95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nFig. 3.

An overview of the genus Populus 95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nFig. 4. While all leaves in the genus Populus are simple — not compound — the shape, prominence of teeth on the margins, and petiole length vary considerably among pure species and hybrid taxa.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n25\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(Fig. 6B). One of aspen’s major ecological roles is the colonization of upland areas burned by intense, stand-replacing fires, and its seeds germinate readily on ash-covered soil. In the Lake States, for example, large areas were colonized by aspen, following the extensive fires of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, moving aspen into a prominence that it did not have in the pre-European settlement forests of the region. Aspens also will grow in wet depressions or on swampy margins, provided some kind of disturbance has allowed them to become established.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nAnother distinctive feature of the genus Populus is its predisposition to form clones by vegetative propagation. “Clone” is derived from the Greek word meaning a twig or slip. The major characteristic of clonal offspring is that they are exact genetic copies of their parent — unless mutations occur to either parent or progeny. In technical jargon, “ortet” refers to the original seed-derived donor plant of a clone; “ramets” are the individual clonal offspring, which can be derived from the original ortet or other ramets propagated from it. In certain naturally growing poplars, the ortet may have originated millennia ago, and its clonal offspring have gone through thousands of self-replicating generations. Clones of planted poplar cultivars may go back hundreds of years and many generations to the ortet. Although exact genetic copies of the ortet, clonal ramets may not necessarily look exactly like their parent or like one another.

Unfortunately, neither the public at large nor fanatical “eco-terrorists” realize that clones are as common in the natural world of plants as are flowers. This fact applies to poplars more than any other tree group. There is nothing inherently sinister in a clone, and anyone who thinks so is ignorant of basic botany. Vegetative propagation of clones enables many plant species to successfully compete and reproduce in the ecological habitats they occupy. Cloning also can be a very effective strategy for invading new habitats. In horticulture and forestry, where plant clones have been used since antiquity, the desirable attributes of a plant variety or an unusual form can be captured\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:26 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1.

Virtually everyone who grows ornamentals or plants a garden uses clones. On the other hand, there are social and environmental issues concerning the use of genetically modified organisms — and the clones that may arise from them — that need to be dealt with by society. But eco-terrorism is not the way.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nCertain types of vegetative propagation or cloning occur after a poplar tree has been cut down or killed suddenly; e.g., by a fire. Most poplars will produce copious sprouts from a cut stump or the root collar of a tree that has been killed, although this ability declines as the tree matures. Eventually, a few large, surviving stump sprouts may take on the appearance of individual trees. Suckers are the second way that poplars vegetatively reproduce under natural conditions. These shoots are produced abundantly from shallow, horizontal roots, especially in the aspens, and in this way a single parent tree may produce a forest of clonal offspring (Fig. 7). Suckering occurs principally after a tree is killed, but living trees also will send up suckers from roots that have invaded adjacent open areas. Certain riparian poplars also reproduce vegetatively by a process called cladoptosis.\n\n25\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n11\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n11 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:27 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPoplar Culture in North America 95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nFig. 6.

An overview of the genus Populus 95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nFig. 7. Nothing about the aspens is more remarkable than their ability to produce tens of thousands of root suckers per hectare after mature trees are suddenly killed or harvested.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n25\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nWhole lateral twigs, often with leaves attached, can be abscised from large trees, and they may root and form clonal plants if they lodge in moist soil. Larger branches that break off from trees during the dormant season also will root and form new trees if they become covered with silt or sand. These last two modes of vegetative reproduction represent minor but ecologically significant means by which riparian poplars become established along the banks of streams or on sandbars when high water recedes.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nMost important for silvicultural and horticultural applications is the establishment of clonal poplar plants with hardwood stem cuttings. This strictly anthropogenic form of vegetative reproduction employs 20- to 30-cm long (sometimes shorter or longer) sections of dormant, 1-year-old woody shoots as planting stock. Amazingly, if these “sticks” are planted in the spring they will quickly produce roots from existing primordia in the inner bark and new shoots from the buds (Fig. 8). The resultant clonal plants often grow several meters tall in the first growing season. This trait alone has allowed the widespread and successful planting of cottonwood and balsam poplars. Unfortunately, the aspens cannot be reproduced from hardwood stem cuttings, although they will propagate — albeit with difficulty — from root cuttings. Leafy “softwood” cuttings from aspen shoots also will root, an expensive process that requires greenhouse misting facilities. Thus, aspen plantations are relatively rare.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nThe wood of poplar is very versatile and widely used by the forest products industry.

The wood is used for pulp and paper, veneer, excelsior, composition boards (especially oriented-strandboard, also known as OSB), lumber, and energy. Among the North American poplars the wood of aspen is most highly prized, and because of its abundance and wide distribution it is one of the most important wood raw materials in Canada and the Lakes States.\n\nTaxonomy\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nThe genus Populus is one of two members of the family Salicaceae, the other being the willows (Salix). Because they are so similar biologically, poplars and willows often are treated similarly in the horticultural and silvicultural trades. The International Poplar Commission, for example, includes willows under its umbrella. Populus comprises six taxonomically distinct sections, consisting of nearly 30 species of worldwide natural distribution in the Northern Hemisphere (Table 1). Twelve species are indigenous to North America, with five or six currently of commercial importance. Because the genus Populus is a complex amalgam of tree taxa, it makes a fascinating — if equivocal — study of taxonomic classification. The thorny problems associated with the sorting and orderly description of tree species are further complicated in the genus for two reasons.

Second, poplars are outcrossing, wind-pollinated, and show few inherent barriers to crossbreeding, so they readily hybridize, both naturally and through controlled pollinations. Interspecific hybrids among species in sections Aigeiros, Tacamahaca, and Populus are commonplace, as are intersectional hybrids between members of Aigeiros and Tacamahaca (Table 3). Many hybrid combinations, however, are facile only in one direction.1 For example, the well-known hybrid P. trichocarpa × P. deltoides almost always requires embryo rescue because of premature dehiscence of the capsule, whereas the reciprocal — P. deltoides × P. trichocarpa — usually produces viable seed (Stettler et al. 1996). Because most hybrids are fertile, they can generate backcrosses to either of the parent species or combine with one another to form advanced generation hybrids. The result of all this crossbreeding within Populus is a multitude of intermediate forms, creating taxonomic havoc.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\nBased on their manner of dealing with this genetic complexity, poplar taxonomists segregate into two distinct camps (Eckenwalder 1996). Splitters, exemplified by Russian and Chinese practitioners, regale in naming new poplar taxa. Their tally of species can reach as high as 85, with 53 species in China alone! On the other hand, Western and North American taxonomists tend to be lumpers, adopting rigid standards for acceptance of new species. Lumpers view many of the species proposed by the splitter camp either as hybrids that do not breed true or subspecies of a single diverse taxon. Their lumped list comprises as few as 22 distinct species. Whatever their camp, no two authorities seem to agree on the exact number of species. Being inclined to lumping, I have adopted here the conservative view of poplar speciation proposed by North American poplar taxonomist James Eckenwalder of the University of Toronto (Table 1). (See also Chaps. 12 and 13 in Part B.) Only recognized species and hybrids warrant a distinct Latin binomial. The full Latin name, which always is italicized, also includes the name of the authority who first described the taxon (usually abbreviated but not italicized). Examples of a full Latin appellation are Populus heterophylla L. (this common abbreviation refers to the authority Karl von Linne or Linnaeus, who first proposed the system of binomial nomenclature) or Populus guzmanantlensis Vazq. & Cuevas. Often the authority is omitted in the interest of brevity. Recognized subspecies and varieties also are Latinized and italicized; e.g., Populus fremontii var. mesetae. The complete Latin name of a taxon always should be used, with or without authority, at first reference in a publication or an oral presentation (see Tables 1–3). 100\n\n95\n\nClonal or cultivar names (also called epithets) are not italicized and are placed after the Latin designation, bracketed by single quotes.

These names may be encountered in the poplar literature, and this listing is presented to help interested readers sort out taxonomic origins.\n\nExperiment Station in Stoneville, MS, is Populus deltoides ‘Bolivar Belle.’ The venerable Lombardy poplar is Populus nigra var. italica ‘Lombardy.’ A hybrid cultivar would be similarly designated, e.g., the natural hybrid from Iowa Populus alba × P. grandidentata ‘Hansen.’ If the hybrid has been assigned its own Latin binomial — in the case of the previous example P. ×rouleauiana (Table 3) — it can be used in place of the two parent species; i.e., P. ×rouleauiana ‘Hansen.’ If known varieties, clones, cultivars, or hybrids were parents in a hybrid combination, they should be identified in the full name; e.g., Populus nigra var. betulifolia × P. trichocarpa ‘NE-12.’ It is essential to always use the times (×) symbol when designating a hybrid, otherwise an uninformed reader may take it for an actual species. A general description of the members in each section in the genus Populus follows, along with known varieties and hybrids. Emphasis is on North American taxa.\n\nSection Abaso 100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nAbaso is a monotypic section with P. mexicana as the single member (Table 1). This species had been previously placed in synonymy with P. fremontii because it superficially resembles the southwestern Aigeiros cottonwoods. But Eckenwalder (1977) proposed it as a distinct species in a section of its own. A small to medium-sized riparian poplar, P. mexicana has linear, willow-like juvenile leaves, deltoid to round mature leaves, and dry, bright yellow, blunt buds. It consists of two subspecies (Table 2), one native to the east coast of Mexico (subspecies mexicana) and one native to the west coast (subspecies dimorpha).

Subspecies mexicana also occurs in the mountains of Oaxaca and Chiapas, making it the most southerly distributed New World poplar.\n\nSection Turanga Like section Abaso, Section Turanga at one time was monotypic, but it now comprises three riparian species (Table 1), among them the principal poplars native to the continent of Africa. There was a proposal to place the poplars in section Turanga in a separate genus, Euphratodendron, because of certain distinctive characteristics of their wood anatomy and flower structure, but these trees still remain poplars. The primitive floral characteristics of members of this section are archetypical. Populus euphratica, the most well-known member of the section, is an extraordinary species. A small- to medium-sized tree native to North and Central Africa, as well as western and central Asia, its distinctive features include slender, sympodial branches (i.e., the shoot apex aborts); small, downy buds; and leathery leaves, which vary in shape from linear on juvenile plants to toothed and rounded on mature plants. It is usually a tree with a short stocky bole and branchy crown. The species often grows in shrubby thickets along watercourses, but in favorable locations in central Asia it can attain commercial quality. Euphrates poplar can tolerate hot, arid, saline conditions or waterlogging and may offer some potential in hybridization programs whose objective is to create tolerance to such conditions. In fact, recent artificial hybrids with P. deltoides, P. nigra, and P. simonii have been successful (Zsuffa et al. 1996). A few clonal selections are planted in Morocco. 100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nA recent addition to Turanga is P. ilicifolia, a native of equatorial East Africa, making its natural range the southernmost among the world’s poplars. This species heretofore had been considered a form of P. euphratica. It roots well from stem and branch cuttings and grows into a large tree up to 30 m in height and 1.5 m in diameter, making it a candidate for tropical poplar culture. Populus pruinosa is another recent addition to section Turanga, but it also was once considered only a subspecies of P. euphratica. Although also a riparian poplar,\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:37 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1. An overview of the genus Populus 95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\n95\n\nthis remarkable poplar has a wide ecological amplitude. In the eastern part of its range in the Sinkiang region of China, P. pruinosa grows in desert conditions, where mean annual rainfall is less than 50 mm and the salt content of the soil can range from 2 to 3%!\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\nSection Leucoides Section Leucoides contains three species, none of which are of great economic significance, although they are important ecologically. Populus heterophylla, the swamp cottonwood, is a medium to large tree distributed along the eastern U.S. coastal plain and the Mississippi Valley north to Michigan.2 Leaves are ovoid to cordate and are borne on a round petiole. Twigs are dull brown or gray with a distinctive orange pith and stout, resinous, reddish-brown buds. Never a common tree, swamp cottonwood inhabits mixed-species forests in swamps, sloughs, and along river borders, usually on heavy clay soils with high water tables. Swamp cottonwood is among the most flood-tolerant of poplars; it will thrive on sites that are too wet for eastern cottonwood. Experience with propagation of swamp cottonwood is minimal, although cuttings appear difficult to root. It does, however, produce root suckers.\n\n0\n\nThe two other species in section Leucoides are Asian. Populus lasiocarpa, native to the humid and semi-humid subtropics of China, is a striking tree with huge (up to 35 cm long and 25 cm wide) heart-shaped, bright green leaves with red midribs and petioles. It grows rapidly, but does not propagate easily from cuttings. It is one of the better poplars for ornamental uses. Populus glauca (formerly P. wilsonii), also distributed in central and western China, is similar to the previous species.\n\nSection Aigeiros For many years, Aigeiros has been the most important section of Populus for plantation culture in North America or the world as a whole. Ecologically, this section includes some of the major riparian poplars in the Northern Hemisphere. Aigeiros, which includes cottonwoods and black poplar, contains three species, two of which are native to North America (Table 1). Both the pure species and their hybrids are of great commercial significance.\n\n100\n\n95\n\nThe most familiar and important member of this section is P. deltoides, the eastern cottonwood. Distributed over most of the eastern and midwestern U.S. and southern Canada to the foothills of the Rocky Mountains, eastern cottonwood is a medium to large tree that develops a long, straight bole and small, round crown under forest conditions. But when growing in the open, the stem typically\n\n75\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n2\n\nFor a detailed portrayal of the natural ranges of most poplar species indigenous to North America, see the Atlas of United States Trees, Vol. 1 (1971) and Vol. 3 (1976) by former U.S. Forest Service dendrologist Elbert L.

Cottonwood leaves are deltoid to cordate in shape, with roundly toothed margins, and they hang from long, flattened petioles. The twigs are stout, angular to ribbed in cross section, and produce slightly resinous, outcurved buds. Bark on young trees is smooth and greenish-yellow to gray, becoming ashy-gray and deeply furrowed on older trees.\n\n5\n\n0\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\nEastern cottonwood is a tree usually associated with bottomlands, alluvia, and riparian corridors, where optimum growth occurs on silty or sandy loam soils. In the lower Mississippi Valley, the best stands are found on the land between the river and the levees that is seasonally flooded. After flood waters recede, the raw sediment that is left behind can be colonized by many thousands of cottonwood seedlings per hectare. In the northern part of its range, cottonwood will grow almost anywhere, and it can withstand droughty conditions. In the southern Lake States, for example, cottonwood is a common invader of old fields, gravel pits, and other disturbed upland sites, as well as the sand dunes along the shore of Lake Michigan (Fig. 9).\n\n0\n\nLike other poplars, eastern cottonwood is highly intolerant of shade and competition; therefore, it must establish dominance early. It grows in pure stands or in association with other bottomland or pioneer species. The southern form of eastern cottonwood (subsp. deltoides; Table 2) is often regarded as the fastestgrowing native tree in North America. On the best sites in the Mississippi River Delta, height growth can average over 4 m/year for the first 5 years (Knowe et al. 1998), and over 145 m3/ha (40 cords/acre) of pulpwood can be produced in a 12year rotation (McKnight 1970). At maturity, eastern cottonwood can attain large size, reaching heights of over 50 m and diameters of more than 1.5 m.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nEastern cottonwood usually produces good seed crops yearly when mature, and it will rapidly invade newly exposed, moist soils. The cottony seed can be carried long distances by the wind or on the surface of moving water. During seed shedding in areas with a high density of cottonwood, the air may be filled with cotton, and lawns may appear as though snow had just fallen. For this reason, cottonwood is regarded as a nuisance by many homeowners and municipalities, and it is generally not recommended for ornamental use. Vegetative reproduction via stump sprouts by this species is vigorous if trees are young when cut. Cottonwood also can be propagated with high survival rates by hardwood stem cuttings, although some genotypes root poorly. Therefore, rooting ability is an important selection criterion in cottonwood genetic improvement programs. In the Mississippi Delta of the southern U.S., trees can grow to over 5 m in height during the first year after a cutting is planted (McKnight 1970). The northern form of cottonwood (subsp. monilifera) generally does not root as easily from hardwood stem cuttings nor does it grow as fast as the southern subspecies. Eastern cottonwood is an important commercial timber species, particularly in the southern U.S. where it is used for match stock, excelsior, sawtimber, veneer, and pulpwood. It has been widely planted on industrial land in the Mississippi\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n22\n\n0\n\n0\n\n22 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:37 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1. An overview of the genus Populus 95\n\n75\n\n95\n\nFig. 9. Eastern cottonwood primarily is associated with riparian areas or wetlands throughout the eastern two-thirds of North America, but in areas with adequate rainfall it will grow almost anywhere. These cottonwoods have naturally established on a sand dune along the Lake Michigan shore.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n25\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nRiver Delta, where the rich alluvial soils combined with the inherently fast growth rate of improved clones produce high wood yields. In addition to forest plantings, cottonwood has been extensively used in shelterbelts and for reclamation of strip-mine spoils. Indigenous people used this cottonwood for various pharmaceutical aids (Moerman 1998). Decoctions of twigs, leaves, and bark were used to treat wounds, snakebites, venereal disease, worms, and bronchial infections; poultices of leaves were applied to bruises, sores, and boils. Five natural varieties of eastern cottonwood were proposed at one time, but Eckenwalder (1977) recognized just three subspecies (Table 2). Eastern cottonwood also has shown a substantial predisposition to hybridize, both naturally and under controlled conditions (Table 3). The most important group of hybrids worldwide is P. deltoides × P. nigra, known collectively as P. ×canadensis (synonym P. ×euramericana)3 or Euramerican hybrids. This hybrid usually has P. deltoides as the maternal parent, because the reciprocal cross rarely is successful. 100\n\n100\n\n3\n\n95\n\n75\n\nAccording to the rules that govern plant nomenclature, P. ×euramericana, the binomial by which this hybrid is widely known and which at one time was adopted by the International Poplar Commission, does not take precedence over that proposed earlier by Moench (or Mönch) — P. ×canadensis (Boom 1957; Rehder 1940). Moench’s binomial was first and should be the one used, and we will follow that convention in this book.\n\n25\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n23\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n23 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:39 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPoplar Culture in North America 95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\n95\n\nMany of the hybrid poplar clones now under cultivation worldwide belong to this group; e.g., cultivar ‘I-214’ in Europe and cultivar ‘Eugenei’ in North America. Intersectional hybrids of P. trichocarpa with P. deltoides (P. ×generosa or Interamerican hybrids) also have become prevalent in poplar culture, especially in the states of Washington and Oregon, the Canadian province of British Columbia, and western Europe. Both Euramerican and Interamerican hybrids show hybrid vigor (heterosis) in which certain hybrid offspring outgrow or outperform both of their parents in some way. Worldwide P. deltoides remains the most important poplar taxon in genetic improvement programs and plantation forestry.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\nThe plains cottonwood (P. deltoides subsp. monilifera) — the state tree of Wyoming — deserves special mention, if only because of its enigmatic taxonomy. Charles Sprague Sargent, pioneer dendrologist and director of the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, originally included this cottonwood as a variety of P. deltoides. But that designation did not stand. Early in the 20th century, fullfledged species status (P. sargentii) was awarded to this western tree. In the 1927 and 1953 editions of the Checklist of United States Trees, the species status of plains cottonwood was upheld. In the latest checklist (Little 1979), however, Sargent’s view once again held sway; plains cottonwood was listed as P. deltoides var. occidentalis. Most authorities have since followed Little’s lead. Nonetheless, Eckenwalder (1977) claimed that plains cottonwood so closely resembles the cottonwood of the Great Lakes Region and other northern areas that they all should be included as subsp. monilifera. Oddly, the only unambiguity seems to be the common name, just the reverse of the usual situation in plant nomenclature where Latin names eliminate ambiguity.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nThe habitat of plains cottonwood is the high steppes of the U.S. and southern Canada. In that habitat, plains cottonwood is often the only tree found, so it has quite naturally become part of the legend and romance of the old West. It was a sure sign of water in an arid land, and its shade provided relief from the blazing sun. Plains cottonwood was virtually the only firewood or building material — save sod — readily available. In winter, the sweet and nutritious inner bark and branches were fed to horses by indigenous people and settlers. Indians also ate the buds, seed capsules, and inner bark. Buds were boiled to make a yellow dye, leaves could be fashioned into a flute-like instrument, and young trees were used as “sacred poles” during ceremonies (Moerman 1998). In a region where trees are not abundant, plains cottonwoods often served as trail markers and gathering sites. Some of them achieved lasting notoriety. The Lone Sentinel Cottonwood that stood on the banks of the Arkansas River in Kansas, for example, marked the place where the town of Dodge City sprang up. Plains cottonwood is lesser in stature than the southern cottonwood (subsp. deltoides), with a spreading crown consisting of small leaves and hairier twigs. It occurs in the region below 2100 m elevation that can be classed as semiarid, growing in open stands or as solitary individuals along stream banks and in other moist places. Plains cottonwood has been tested for planting in windbreaks, as\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n24\n\n0\n\n0\n\n24 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:39 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1.

Because of the stressful condition under which it grows, plains cottonwood is considered by some to be more susceptible to insect and disease pests than other eastern cottonwoods, but research has not borne this out.\n\n5\n\n0\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\nAnother arid-zone poplar in section Aigeiros is P. fremontii, the common, lowelevation cottonwood of northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. from western Texas to the San Joaquin Valley of California. It is a large tree (up to 30 m in height and 1.2 m in diameter) with small deltoid leaves that turn bright yellow in the fall. Besides providing welcome shade, the tree has a fibrous inner bark from which Mohave women made skirts. Indians also ate or chewed green catkins and capsules; used decoctions of the inner bark and leaves to prevent scurvy and treat sores, cuts, and bruises; and wove baskets from the young twigs (Moerman 1998). The Spanish word for poplar is alamo, and the Franciscan mission where the heroic but doomed Texans held off the Mexican army in 1836 was named for the adjacent grove of Fremont cottonwoods (Rupp 1990). This poplar is widely planted as an ornamental and for fuel around ranches and in towns throughout its native region (Fig. 9).\n\n0\n\nTaxonomic confusion also typifies the other southwestern cottonwoods. The Rio Grande cottonwood is native to western Texas and New Mexico. Once regarded as a separate species (P. wislizeni) or a variety of P. fremontii, it now is placed as a subspecies under P. deltoides (Eckenwalder 1977). Among the uses for this poplar by indigenous people, the catkins, capsules, and buds were collected for chewing gum or food (Moerman 1998). Another cottonwood found in New Mexico, Texas, and northern Mexico, formerly designated P. arizonica, is now included under P. fremontii as var. mesetae. Yet a fourth southwestern cottonwood found in central and southwestern Texas and northern Mexico has been proposed — P. palmeri. This rather obscure, medium-sized tree with ovate leaves now is placed in the synonymy of P. deltoides.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nThe last species in section Aigeiros is native to Eurasia, although its widespread and ancient cultivation has obscured the exact limits of its original natural range. Populus nigra, the black poplar, is the “type” species for the section, but it actually differs in many traits from the two cottonwoods in the section. In fact, it more closely resembles section Tacamahaca poplars in some traits, and its chloroplast DNA has ties to P. alba of section Populus (Smith and Sytsma 1990). Eventually, the North American cottonwoods may have to be placed in a section of their own, leaving P. nigra as the sole member of section Aigeiros. Black poplar is a large tree that often produces an irregular, branchy crown. The typically crooked, buttressed bole can be massive, frequently producing large burs or epicormic branches. Many stands, however, produce straight, well-formed trees; e.g., along the Danube River in Eastern Europe. The leaves of black poplar are rhombic–ovoid, dark green in color, with finely toothed margins and long,\n\n25\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n25\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n25 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:39 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPoplar Culture in North America 95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\n95\n\nflattened petioles. The twigs are round in cross section, reddish, and produce gummy, outcurved buds. The juvenile bark is yellow–white, becoming dark and deeply fissured with age. Black poplar is an aggressive species that seeds into wastelands, riverbanks, and other exposed sites. It sprouts vigorously from stumps and, to some extent, suckers from roots. Propagation from stem cuttings also is very easy. At maturity, black poplar may reach heights of 40 m and diameters of nearly 2 m. The high human population density in most of its natural range, combined with a long history of exotic poplar introductions and disruption of riparian ecosystems, threatens the genetic integrity of this species. Therefore, conservation and restoration of natural riparian ecosystems dominated by black poplar are being given high priority in many European countries.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\nThe large geographic distribution of P. nigra and its widespread cultivation have given rise to a plethora of named varieties and cultivars. Prominent among the cultivated clones of black poplar have been those exhibiting a columnar (fastigiate) growth habit; variety italica (Lombardy poplar) and variety thevestina (Fig. 10). Lombardy is the oldest and best-known columnar variety, having been introduced from central Asia into cultivation in the Po Valley of Italy in the 18th century (Zsuffa 1974). Lombardy poplar is a male tree that may represent propagules from a single original tree or a family of similar trees. As a consequence, some recognize it as a cultivar, others as a true variety. The dramatic silhouette produced by this distinctively columnar tree has become almost a synonym for the fastigiate growth habit. Lombardy poplar has been used extensively throughout the world as a landscape ornamental, and it may be the most widely planted of all poplars (see Part B of this book). Currently, a breeding program in Turkey is aimed at producing columnar types with a broader genetic diversity. In North America, Lombardy poplar and other P. nigra varieties are more susceptible than native poplars to the canker caused by Dothichiza populea. This canker is largely responsible for the pitiably short life span of black poplars in certain regions of the eastern United States and Canada. In addition, massive infection of the stem by a wetwood bacterium frequently occurs, contributing to their rapid decline in plantings. Nonetheless, large, magnificent trees over 40 years old can be found in the northern Great Lakes and in the western U.S. and Canada.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nGrowth rates of P. nigra in North American tests have been variable, depending upon site and clone used, but they compare very favorably with other poplar species or hybrids. The major role black poplar has played in North American poplar culture, however, is as a parent in hybrid crosses produced naturally or by poplar breeders (Table 3). The Euramerican clones (P. ×canadensis) have been especially significant. The original North American Euramerican clones were 19thcentury emigrants from Europe, but during the 20th century many new hybrids were created by indigenous breeding programs. The Euramerican hybrids remain fundamental to North American poplar culture. Recently, intersectional hybrids\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n26\n\n0\n\n0\n\n26 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:39 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1.

The striking columnar (fastigiate) form of the P. nigra varieties italica (Lombardy) and thevestina have long made them popular in North America for windbreaks and line plantings.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n25\n\n5\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\nbetween P. nigra and the Asian P. suaveolens (formerly P. maximowiczii) have shown great promise for plantation wood production, and a few of these clones are now planted widely.\n\nSection Tacamahaca The fifth section in Populus, Tacamahaca, collectively known as the balsam poplars, contains nine species (Table 1). These largely riparian poplars are distributed in the northern latitudes, and several species are of commercial importance. Three species are native to North America (P. balsamifera, P. trichocarpa, and P. angustifolia), with the remaining six found in Asia. No Tacamahaca poplars are indigenous to Europe.\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nBalsam poplar (P. balsamifera) is the most widely distributed Tacamahaca poplar in North America, occurring transcontinentally across the northern U.S. and Canada to Alaska. It grows farther north than any North American poplar, occurring in shrubby form on Alaska’s North Slope. According to Little (1979), the Latin binominal P. balsamifera (literally “bearing resin”), by which this species has long been known, was used synonymously for eastern cottonwood for many years. Apparently, the early description by Swedish taxonomist Karl von Linne was too vague to distinguish between the two. Thus, P. tacamahaca was proposed for balsam poplar, but this name did not gain wide acceptance.\n\n25\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n27\n\n0\n\n5\n\n0\n\n27 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:41 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nPoplar Culture in North America 95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\n95\n\nBalsam poplar has ovate leaves, dark lustrous green above and pale metallic green below, often with rusty brown blotches. The leaf margins are finely toothed and the petioles round. The twigs also are round in cross section, with out-curved buds that are saturated with a fragrant, amber-colored resin that is one of this species most distinctive characteristics. In fact, the word balsam is said to be a derivation of the ancient Hebrew bot min, meaning “the chief of oils” (Rupp 1990). The bark of balsam poplar is smooth, greenish to reddish brown, turning gray with scaly ridges as it ages. The wood is soft, light brown in color with a grayish sapwood. It is considered inferior to aspen for bleached pulp by the forest industry because of the high resin content and dark color of the heartwood.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\nBalsam poplar is a medium-sized tree that reaches its largest proportions in the Northwest. Its habitat usually is moist or wet soils, such as the borders of streams, lakes, swamps, and depressions, although it will also grow on dry sites. Balsam poplar is an intolerant pioneer species that will rapidly invade disturbed wet sites by suckering or seeding. Although relatively short-lived, it will outlive quaking aspen and may eventually dominate on sites where the two coexist. Like aspen, balsam poplar commonly acts as a pioneer species, eventually succeeded by more tolerant hardwoods and conifers. Owing to its adaptability to dry conditions, resistance to cold, and ease of propagation by stem or root cuttings, balsam poplar has been planted for shelterbelts, although forest plantations of this species are virtually unknown. The hybrid with P. deltoides (P. ×jackii; Table 3), however, has been planted for wood production in eastern Canada. Although the wood of balsam poplar is not of great commercial importance, the tree has other useful attributes. In his compilation of Native American ethnobotany, Moerman (1998) lists balsam poplar among the 10 plants with the greatest number of uses by indigenous people. The buds were used to make a salve or a decoction for coughs, lung infections, and sprains; a poultice of root scrapings was applied as a disinfectant and for headaches or other pains; a decoction of the inner bark was used as an eyewash, a tonic, and a treatment for tuberculosis and venereal disease; and branches and leaves were used in sweat baths for rheumatism and other pains. Young twigs were fed to horses when other food was not available, and the inner bark and sap were consumed by humans. Smoke from the buds and bark repelled flying insects; the inner bark also could be smoked in pipes when mixed with tobacco. Bees apparently use the resin of balsam poplar to seal cracks in their hives (Rupp 1990).\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\nA note on the Balm-of-Gilead poplar is necessary here. Both the name and identity of this vegetatively propagated female tree are another source of confusion. Originally, the commercial cultivar Balm-of-Gilead was considered a clone of heartleaf poplar, a variety of balsam poplar given the name P. tacamahaca var. candicans (later becoming P. balsamifera var. subcordata). Other authorities maintained heartleaf poplar’s species or hybrid status with the binomial P. candicans or P. ×candicans. Eckenwalder (1996) considered Balm-of-Gilead to be a P. ×jackii hybrid, which fits with the heart-shaped leaves. To add to the\n\n25\n\n5\n\n100\n\n95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n28\n\n0\n\n0\n\n28 W:\\D074 Poplar\\Ventura files\\001 Dickmann.vp Wednesday, November 07, 2001 3:22:41 PM\n\nColor profile: Generic CMYK printer profile Composite 150 lpi at 45 degrees\n\n100\n\n100\n\nDickmann: Chapter 1. An overview of the genus Populus 95\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\n95\n\nconfusion, Balm-of-Gilead (or just “Balm”) also is a colloquial name generally applied to balsam poplar in parts of its natural range. The leaves of Balm-ofGilead and heartleaf poplars are larger and more cordate than normal balsam poplars, and they are whitish and hairy below, particularly on the veins and petioles. Balm-of-Gilead has been planted extensively as an ornamental tree and for windbreaks. The western counterpart of balsam poplar is black cottonwood (P. trichocarpa), which occurs largely in the Pacific coastal states and western Canadian provinces from southern California to Alaska, and east through the Inland Empire. Morphologically, it is similar in most respects to balsam poplar, except that the capsules of black cottonwood split into three parts when mature rather than the two parts of balsam poplar, and the bark on older trees of black cottonwood is furrowed rather than scaly. In fact, where the ranges of the two species overlap in Alberta and the northern Rocky Mountains of the U.S., distinguishing one from the other may be impossible unless capsules can be examined. In this zone of overlap, hybrids between the two inevitably occur, complicating identification to the species level. Hybrid trees can have capsules in each catkin that split into either two or three parts.\n\n75\n\n25\n\n5\n\n0\n\nBlack cottonwood is a fast-growing tree component of moist bottomland, riverine, or alluvial ecosystems where it grows in pure stands or in association with other low-elevation hardwoods and conifers (Fig. 11). This species reaches its best development in climatic regions dominated by moist Pacific Ocean air. Black cottonwood grows to the largest size of any native poplar or any western hardwood; in the Puget Sound area, heights of 50 m and diameters over 1.5 m can be achieved. Mature forest-grown trees in coastal habitats develop long clear boles; from a commercial standpoint, this species has no equal among poplar taxa in stem fo"
