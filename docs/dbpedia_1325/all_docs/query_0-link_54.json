        "text": "During the peeling of veneer, lathe checks as deep as 70 to 80% of the veneer thickness are formed. This study showed that during adhesive testing according to EN 314 deep lathe checks in birch (Betula pendula Roth) veneer significantly reduced the shear strength of phenol-formaldehyde (PF) bonded plywood, even though these checks are not mentioned in the standard. In addition, we show that specimens tested open can fail by a different mechanism than those pulled closed, especially when checks are deep. Lathe checks were also shown to influence bond strengths when using the Automated Bonding Evaluation System (ABES). These findings stress the importance of measuring lathe check depth and considering the orientations of checks during testing to get a better understanding of bond quality in veneer-based products.\n\nThe practice of veneering compomers to amalgam restorations has not been studied. This in vitro study was designed to assess the shear peel bond strength and fracture pattern of 3 currently available compomers veneered to amalgam. Sixty cylindrical preparations were filled with amalgam. Half (30) had no surface treatment, whereas the other half were air abraded. In both groups, 10 specimens each were veneered with Dyract AP, Hytac, and F2000 according to the manufacturers' instructions. All samples were kept at 37 degrees C in 100% relative humidity for 48 hours. SPBS was assessed with a universal testing machine and fracture patterns with a stereomicroscope. The results were analyzed with 2-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparison test. Dyract AP veneered to air-abraded amalgam had the highest SPBS (5.78 +/- 1.30 MPa); F2000 veneered to non-air-abraded amalgam had the lowest (2.99 +/- 1.4 MPa). Sandblasting significantly influenced SPBS in the case of Hytac (P<.02) and F2000 (P<.01). Within the non-air-abraded group, Dyract AP had significantly higher SPBS than Hytac (P<.03) and F2000 (P<.015). F2000 air-abraded specimens exhibited adhesive bond failure only, whereas all other groups showed both adhesive and combined bond failures. Of the 3 compomers tested for veneering to amalgam, Dyract AP showed the highest SPBS. Air-abrading the amalgam surface was found to improve the SPBS of Dyract AP, though not significantly. Low SPBS and poor adhesion indicated that F2000 is unsuitable for veneering amalgam.\n\nThe 3D moldability of veneers, as opposed to the moldability of plastic or other materials, is limited because of the characteristics of wood. By mechanical treatment under appropriate conditions, it is possible to partially modify veneer characteristics. In this study, the intention was to determine the effect of factors influencing the 3D moldability of veneers. Therefore, this study was focused on determining the 3D moldability of veneers with square and circular shape, which were stressed under six moisture content levels (i.e., 0%, 8%, 16%, 20%, 30%, and 100%). To determine the influence of wood species, the results for beech veneers of 0.5-mm thickness were compared to the results for birch veneers of 0.5mm thickness. These sets of samples were stressed with a spherical stamping tool with three different radii of curvature (i.e., 20, 40, and 80 mm). There is currently no standardized method for assessing the 3D moldability of veneers, as opposed to metals (metal sheets). Becau..."
