        "text": "The S&P 500 ended essentially unchanged in just another slow and sleepy summer week - NOT! The first part of that statement is true and given where we started on Monday morning, it feels like a win. The week was anything but sleepy but I’m sure traders are looking forward to some this weekend. Last week ended on a very negative note with the S&P 500 falling nearly 2% extending the weekly losing streak to three weeks, breaking key technical levels in the process. The losses came in response to a weak jobs report, the third disappointing economic report following the Fed’s rate decision on Wednesday, where Chair Powell set the table for rate cuts in the fall but overall seemed pretty content with the backdrop. The data caused the volume of criticism that the central bank was behind the curve to grow louder, and investors were forced to rethink the soft-landing narrative.\n\nPrior to the session the Nikkei had fallen over 5% overnight as the Yen continued to surge as crowded short positions associated with carry trades continued to be unwound after the surprise Bank of Japan rate hike earlier in the week. Not to mention the increasing geopolitical concerns ahead of a potential escalation in the Middle East. There were clear signs of strain on Friday with the VIX trading up to nearly 30. That being said, I don’t think anyone was really prepared for what happened in Asia on Sunday night.\n\nOver the weekend crypto markets, which I watch as a gauge of risk sentiment, were down a couple of percent on Saturday. The fact that one of the greatest capital allocators of all time, Warren Buffet, disclosed that his company continued to build a massive war chest of cash after selling half its Apple position, did get some attention. However, on Sunday night S&P futures were only modestly lower on the re-open. That being said, things escalated pretty quickly as Asian markets re-opened. The Yen continued to rally, sending the Nikkei into freefall closing down >10%, the largest single day selloff since 1987, with banks getting hit particularly hard. The selloff spread throughout Asia with circuit breakers getting triggered and crypto currencies falling >20%. There were really no headlines to be found leaving investors searching for the boogey man and raising questions about forced liquidations.\n\nThis is where I will shamelessly plug our new weekly podcast, Inside the ICE House: Market Storylines. In our maiden voyage, I discussed the increasing impact of quantitative investment strategies in markets. Please check it out.\n\nThat is a topic we’ve discussed in this space before and one that I believe has been playing a large role in the volatility seen recently. Trending markets and a low volatility environment allowed positions to build up. That environment was helped by growing popularity/profitability of volatility selling strategies. Index volatility was suppressed by large dispersion trades, where funds sold index volatility verse single stock vol. This turned into the perfect recipe for a version of Volmageddon Part Deux (I will be sad to see the Olympics end).\n\nThe losses in Europe and the US were much more contained overnight with those indices/futures trading down 2-3% but as the US open drew closer the VIX surged to over 50 in a scramble for protection briefly touch 65, the highest level since 2020. The S&P 500 opened down around 4% bringing the peak to trough declines to just under 10%. Shortly after the open, ISM services came in better-than-expected rebounding back above 50 reversing some of the steep decline seen in the previous month. This helped the market stabilize easing some of the fears of a hard landing that began to bubble up and quiet the irrational calls that the Fed should rush to the market with an emergency rate cut. By mid-day the VIX had been cut in half with the S&P 500 rallying about 2.5% off the lows. Another wave of selling came in the back half of the day a preview of what we’d see over the next couple of sessions.\n\nOn Monday night Asian markets rebounded recouping a good portion of the previous day’s losses and in general markets have spent the week trying to stabilize. It has been a pretty quiet week of economic data and news. Comments from BOJ deputy governor Uchida on Tuesday night downplayed the prospects for additional tightening in the near term in part pointing to the market volatility and then the following day the BOJ Summary of Opinions pointed to further tightening being “conducted carefully” with some suggestion that rates would need to move to ~1% by 2H of 2025 helping to calm some of the currency volatility.\n\nYesterday’s claims report got outsized attention in a week otherwise devoid of economic data, with initial claims moderating to 233k completely reversing the previous week’s jump. This sent the S&P 500 up >2% and helped the market break a three-day streak of weakness into the close. By recent standards today was a pretty tame day with markets closing the day modestly higher and around unchanged for the week.\n\nThroughout this week I’ve highlighted that I believe much of what we’ve seen is about the unwinding of crowded positioning and purging of leverage in the system. This has been happening for a couple of weeks but as everyone rushed for the door at the same time that became a destabilizing event. There is no way positions can be fully unwound in that environment so there tend to be aftershocks which is why we’ve seen waves of selling into the end of the day with systematic risk reduction continuing. The big question from here is how much more of that unwind needs to happen. I get the sense that we are in the latter innings, with a lot of that work already behind us. That being said, Monday’s events will linger in the minds of investors for some time, and it will take a while for charts to repair and volatility to compress before the systematic bid comes back into the market. One positive note from a flow perspective is that the corporate buyback machine will get cranking again as most companies are now out of the buyback blackout window. The VIX ended the week down lower but still around 20. I've included a chart just to put the move in perspective."
