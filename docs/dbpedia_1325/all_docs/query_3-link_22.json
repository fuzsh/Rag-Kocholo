        "text": "Looking today at week-over-week shares outstanding changes among the universe of ETFs covered at ETF Channel, one standout is the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Real Estate Index Fund (IYR) where we have detected an approximate $110.1 million dollar inflow -- that's a 3.1% increase week over week in outstanding units (from 58,950,000 to 60,800,000). Among the largest underlying components of IYR, in trading today Simon Property Group Incorporated (SPG) is up about 0.7%, and Equity Residential (EQR) is up by about 0.3%.

Comparing the most recent share price to the 200 day moving average can also be a useful technical analysis technique -- learn more about the 200 day moving average ».\n\nExchange traded funds (ETFs) trade just like stocks, but instead of ''shares'' investors are actually buying and selling ''units''. These ''units'' can be traded back and forth just like stocks, but can also be created or destroyed to accommodate investor demand. Each week we monitor the week-over-week change in shares outstanding data, to keep a lookout for those ETFs experiencing notable inflows (many new units created) or outflows (many old units destroyed). Creation of new units will mean the underlying holdings of the ETF need to be purchased, while destruction of units involves selling underlying holdings, so large flows can also impact the individual components held within ETFs."
