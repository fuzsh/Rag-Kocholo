The role of miR-188-5p in gastric cancer has not been determined. In this study, we found that the expression of miR-188-5p was downregulated in gastric cancer (GC) tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. And lowly expressed miR-188-5p was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stage. Moreover, overexpression of miR-188-5p significantly inhibited GC cell proliferation, migration and invasion but promoted cellular apoptosis. In mechanism, we identified transcription factor ZFP91 as a target gene of miR-188-5p in GC. We found that miR-188-5p overexpression significantly inhibited the expression of ZFP91 in GC cell lines. And there was an inversely correlation between the expression of miR-188-5p and ZFP91 in GC tissues. What's more, we found that restoration of ZFP91 in miR-188-5poverexpressed MGC-803 and SGC-7901 cells promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Finally, we also showed that overexpression of miR-188-5p inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Taken together, our findings indicated that miR-188-5p serves as a tumor suppressor in human gastric cancer by targeting ZFP91, suggesting that miR-188-5p might be a promising therapeutic target for GC treatment.\n\n75 FR 14422 - Wrangell-Petersburg Resource Advisory Committee\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2010-03-25\n\n....

The city, built by Peter the Great, is situated in the former swampy delta of the Neva River which connects the large Lake Ladoga (the frozen white surface on the edge of the photograph) to the Gulf of Finland. An interesting feature of St. Petersburg which can be discerned in this photograph is the new storm surge barrier built from both sides of the Gulf of Finland out to the island of Kronstadt in the middle. This barrier, similar to that which was built on the Thames River south of London to protect it from storm surges out of the North Sea, was constructed to protect St. Petersburg from storm surges coming out of the Baltic Sea and being magnified by the topography and hydrography of the Gulf of Finland. Also visible as a thin line between Kronstadt and St. Petersburg is the ice-free shipping channel kept open much of the winter. Power plant plumes are also visible on the frame. St. Petersburg is the home of the Russian cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, who flew aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery during STS-60.\n\nThree centuries of multi-storied St. Petersburg\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLavrov, Leonid; Perov, Fedor; Eremeeva, Aleksandra; Temnov, Vladimir\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe article is devoted to assessment of the role of high-rise buildings in the St. Petersburg historic city's ensemble. Features of formation of city architectural look, the conditions of city typical silhouette's appearance which is characterized by the contrast of a small number of high-rise structures with a low horizontal mass building are observed. The consequences of the emergence of a significant number of great height buildings, the silhouette of which conflicts with the traditional St. Petersburg landscape's compositional principles, are analyzed. The economic reasons of high-rise construction of residential and office buildings are given. The conclusions about the prospects of St. Petersburg high-rise construction in the light of city-building and economic factors are made.\n\nExpression and function of microRNA-188-5p in activated rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts.\n\nPubMed\n\nRuedel, Anke; Dietrich, Peter; Schubert, Thomas; Hofmeister, Simone; Hellerbrand, Claus; Bosserhoff, Anja Katrin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nActivated synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis (RASF) play a critical role in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent studies suggested that deregulation of microRNAs (miRs) affects the development and progression of RA. Therefore, we aimed to identify de-regulated miRs in RASF and to identify target genes that may contribute to the aggressive phenotype of RASF. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed a marked downregulation of miR-188-5p in synovial tissue samples of RA patients as well as in RASF. Exposure to the cytokine interleukine-1Î² lead to a further downregulation of miR-188-5p expression levels compared to control cells. Re-expression of miR-188-5p in RASF by transient transfection significantly inhibited cell migration. However, miR-188-5p re-expression had no effects on glycosaminoglycan degradation or expression of repellent factors, which have been previously shown to affect the invasive behavior of RASF. In search for target genes of miR-188-5p in RASF we performed gene expression profiling in RASF and found a strong regulatory effect of miR-188-5p on the hyaluronan binding protein KIAA1199 as well as collagens COL1A1 and COL12A1, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR. In silico analysis revealed that KIAA1199 carries a 3'UTR binding site for miR-188-5p. COL1A1 and COL12A1 showed no binding site in the mRNA region, suggesting an indirect regulation of these two genes by miR-188-5p. In summary, our study showed that miR-188-5p is down-regulated in RA in vitro and in vivo, most likely triggered by an inflammatory environment. MiR-188-5p expression is correlated to the activation state of RASF and inhibits migration of these cells. Furthermore, miR-188-5p is directly and indirectly regulating the expression of genes, which may play a role in extracellular matrix formation and destruction in RA. Herewith, this study identified potential novel therapeutic targets to inhibit the development and progression of RA.\n\nExpression and function of microRNA-188-5p in activated rheumatoid arthritis synovial fibroblasts\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRuedel, Anke; Dietrich, Peter; Schubert, Thomas; Hofmeister, Simone; Hellerbrand, Claus; Bosserhoff, Anja-Katrin\n\n2015-01-01\n\nActivated synovial fibroblasts in rheumatoid arthritis (RASF) play a critical role in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

To shed empirical light on this phenomenon, we examined subjects' bids for one St. Petersburg gamble with a real monetary payment. We found that bids were typically lower than twice the smallest payoff, and thus much lower than is generally supposed. We also examined bids offered for several hypothetical variants of the St. Petersburg Paradox. We found that bids were weakly affected by truncating the gamble, were strongly affected by repeats of the gamble, and depended linearly on the initial \"seed\" value of the gamble. One explanation, which we call the median heuristic , strongly predicts these data. Subjects following this strategy evaluate a gamble as if they were taking the median rather than the mean of the payoff distribution. Finally, we argue that the distribution of outcomes embodied in the St. Petersburg paradox is so divergent from the Gaussian form that the statistical mean is a poor estimator of expected value, so that the expected value of the St. Petersburg gamble is undefined. These results suggest that this classic paradox has a straightforward explanation rooted in the use of a statistical heuristic.\n\nThe mean, the median, and the St. Petersburg paradox\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHayden, Benjamin Y.; Platt, Michael L.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe St. Petersburg Paradox is a famous economic and philosophical puzzle that has generated numerous conflicting explanations.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying HCC progression are still not completely clear. Given the crucial role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer metastasis, we aimed to analyze the expression and function of a metastasis-associated miRNA named miR-188-5p in HCC. miRNA array analysis was performed to search for metastasis-associated miRNAs in HCC. miR-188-5p expressions in tumor tissues and adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues of HCC patients and cell lines were evaluated by real-time PCR. The protein expression levels were analyzed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Luciferase reporter assays was used to validate the target of miR-188-5p. The effect of miR-188-5p on HCC progression was studied in vitro and in vivo. miR-188-5p was significantly decreased in HCC and its expression levels were highly correlated with multiple nodules, microvascular invasion, overall and disease-free survival of HCC. Ectopic expression of miR-188-5p suppressed HCC cell proliferation and metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5) was identified as a major target of miR-188-5p. Enforced expression of miR-188-5p inhibited the expression of FGF5 significantly and the restoration of FGF5 expression reversed the inhibitory effects of miR-188-5p on HCC cell proliferation and metastasis. These findings collectively demonstrate a tumor suppressor role of miR-188-5p in HCC progression via targeting FGF5, suggesting that miR-188-5p could serve as a potential prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for HCC.

Using miRNA profiling analysis, we find that miR-188-5p was significantly down-regulated in metastatic PCa. Down-regulation of miR-188-5p is an independent prognostic factor for poor overall and biochemical recurrence-free survival. Restoration of miR-188-5p in PCa cells (PC-3 and LNCaP) significantly suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and inhibits tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. We also find overexpression of miR-188-5p in PC-3 cells can significantly enhance the cells' chemosensitivity to adriamycin. LAPTM4B is subsequently identified as a direct target of miR-188-5p in PCa, and is found to be significantly over-expressed in PCa. Knockdown of LAPTM4B phenotypically copies miR-188-5p-induced phenotypes, whereas ectopic expression of LAPTM4B reverses the effects of miR-188-5p. We also find that restoration of miR-188-5p can inhibit the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway via the suppression of LAPTM4B. Taken together, this is the first report unveils that miR-188-5p acts as a tumour suppressor in PCa and may therefore serve as a useful therapeutic target for the development of new anticancer therapy.

Field-study methods were of a reconnaissance nature, and thus, interpretations in the report are tentative. Landscape of the northern end of Mitkof Island on which Petersburg is situated is characterized by a gently sloping, muskeg-covered terrain, with altitudes mostly less than 30 m. In contrast, much of the rest of the island is composed of mountainous terrain with many steep valleys. During the Pleistocene Epoch, the Petersburg area presumably was covered by ice several times; glaciers deeply eroded many valleys on Mitkof Island and adjacent areas. The last major deglaciation probably was largely completed by 12,000 years ago. Delayed rebound of the earth's crust, after the melting of large amounts of ice, permitted extensive inundation of land in the Petersburg area. Subsequently, emergence has elevated marine deposits to a present-day altitude of at least 65 m and probably to 75 m. Bedrock in the Petersburg map area is composed of relatively hard metamorphic rocks, chiefly phyllite and probably some graywacke. Rocks are of Middle(?) Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age. Five types of surficial geologic material of Quaternary age were recognized: (1) mixed deposits consisting of diamicton, silt-clay, and sand or sandy pebble gravel, (2) alluvial deposits, (3) shore and delta deposits, (4) organic deposits, and (5) artificial fill. Geologic structure in southeastern Alaska is complex because several cycles of tectonic deformation since at least early Paelozoic time have affected different parts of the region. The latest of the major tectonic events in southeastern Alaska occurred in Tertiary time, with some minor activity continuing into the Quaternary Period. Along the outer coast of southeastern Alaska\n\n36 CFR 7.64 - Petersburg National Battlefield.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-07-01\n\n... 36 Parks, Forests, and Public Property 1 2011-07-01 2011-07-01 false Petersburg National Battlefield. 7.64 Section 7.64 Parks, Forests, and Public Property NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, DEPARTMENT OF THE... mechanical work upon motor vehicles, except in emergencies, in any public place is prohibited.

METHODS: We collected data about all pregnancy-related deaths in St. Petersburg over the period 1992-2003 using several sources of information. An independent research group reviewed and classified all cases according to ICD-10 and the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom. We tested trends of overall and cause specific ratios (deaths per 100,000 births) for four 3-year intervals using the chi2 test. FINDINGS: The maternal mortality ratio for the study period was 43 per 100,000 live births. A sharp decline of direct obstetric deaths was observed from the first to fourth 3-year interval (49.8 for 1992-94 versus 18.5 for 2001-03). Sepsis and haemorrhage were the main causes of direct obstetric deaths. Among the total deaths from sepsis, 63.8% were due to abortion. Death ratios from sepsis declined significantly from the first to second study interval. In the last study interval (2001-03), 50% of deaths due to haemorrhage were secondary to ectopic pregnancies. The death ratio from thromboembolism remained low (2.9%) and stable throughout the study period. Among indirect obstetric deaths a non-significant decrease was observed for deaths from cardiac disease. Death ratios from infectious causes and suicides increased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal mortality levels in St. Petersburg still exceed European levels by a factor of five. Improved management of abortion, emergency care for sepsis and haemorrhage, and better identification and control of infectious diseases in pregnancy, are needed. PMID:16628301\n\n14.

The stone is also frequently seen among pavement slabs and in parapets of embankments and bridges around the city. This list of examples where Rapakivi Granite has been used could be expanded further. All Rapakivi Granites used in the buildings of St.Petersburg were quarried from the so-called Vyborg massif. At present it has been found that the massif occupies an area of about 18 000 km2. In the past granite of the Vyborg massif was worked from several quarries in the vicinity of Fredrikshamn (Hamina) in Finland for use in St Peterburg. The best known granite quarries are at Piterlaks (Piuterlahti) and Gimmekyul (HÃ¤meenkylÃ¤). Sometimes Rapakivi Granite form Finland differs in appearance from typical varieties. Thus columns of a classical portal in the house at N 7 in Pochtamtskaya Street are hewn from this greyish variety. Other examples are the plinth of the General Staff and Trade Store buildings. After the 1960s varieties from the Leningrad district, and Korosten (Ukraine) massifs were used in St Petersburg. Today it is possible to find examples of Rapakivi Granite from Finland in cities in the USA, South Africa, United Kingdom and Germany. It is a long used stone as demonstrated by its cultural heritage. It is also used as an ornamental or decorative stone in modern architecture.

Two main steps for circulating BMCs to integrate into CNV lesions are extracellular matrix remodeling and consequential cell migration. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were found to be involved in CNV development; however, little is known about whether miRNAs regulate the contribution of BMCs to CNV. In the present study, we found that the expression of miR-188-5p was decreased in cultured hypoxic MSCs and BMCs within laser-induced CNV in mice. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and MMP-13 were both discovered as targets of miR-188-5p by bioinformatics predictions and dual-luciferase reporter system. Accordingly, increased expression of MMP-2/13 was found in hypoxic MSCs and BMCs in CNV lesions. Furthermore, miR-188-5p mimic transfection caused downregulation of MMP-2/13 in hypoxic MSCs and decreased tube formation of co-cultured vascular endothelial cells. Intravitreal injections of a miR-188-5p agomir attenuated the severity of CNV and inhibited the migration of BMCs into CNV lesions in mice. Our study suggests that miR-188-5p regulates the contribution of BMCs to CNV development by targeting MMP-2/13-mediated extracellular matrix degeneration, and miR-188-5p serves as a therapeutic target to treat CNV-related diseases.

L.; Ziv, A. D.; Iakovleva, E. A.; Palmgren, F.; Berkowicz, R.\n\nThe bi-annual data set of concentrations of several traffic-related air pollutants, measured continuously in street canyons in St. Petersburg and Copenhagen, is analysed jointly using different statistical techniques. Annual mean concentrations of NO 2, NO x and, especially, benzene are found systematically higher in St. Petersburg than in Copenhagen but for ozone the situation is opposite. In both cities probability distribution functions (PDFs) of concentrations and their daily or weekly extrema are fitted with the Weibull and double exponential distributions, respectively. Sample estimates of bi-variate distributions of concentrations, concentration roses, and probabilities of concentration of one pollutant being extreme given that another one reaches its extremum are presented in this paper as well as auto- and co-spectra. It is demonstrated that there is a reasonably high correlation between seasonally averaged concentrations of pollutants in St. Petersburg and Copenhagen.\n\nSaint Petersburg magnetic observatory: from Voeikovo subdivision to INTERMAGNET certification\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSidorov, Roman; Soloviev, Anatoly; Krasnoperov, Roman; Kudin, Dmitry; Grudnev, Andrei; Kopytenko, Yury; Kotikov, Andrei; Sergushin, Pavel\n\n2017-11-01\n\nSince June 2012 the Saint Petersburg magnetic observatory is being developed and maintained by two institutions of the Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS) - the Geophysical Center of RAS (GC RAS) and the Saint Petersburg branch of the Pushkov Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism, Ionosphere and Radio Wave Propagation of RAS (IZMIRAN SPb). On 29 April 2016 the application of the Saint Petersburg observatory (IAGA code SPG) for introduction into the INTERMAGNET network was accepted after approval by the experts of the first definitive dataset over 2015, produced by the GC RAS, and on 9 June 2016 the SPG observatory was officially certified. One of the oldest series of magnetic observations, originating in 1834, was resumed in the 21st century, meeting the highest quality standards and all modern technical requirements. In this paper a brief historical and scientific background of the SPG observatory foundation and development is given, the stages of its renovation and upgrade in the 21st century are described, and information on its current state is provided. The first results of the observatory functioning are discussed and geomagnetic variations registered at the SPG observatory are assessed and compared with geomagnetic data from the INTERMAGNET observatories located in the same region.\n\nQuality of attachment in St Petersburg (Russian Federation): A sample of family-reared infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nPleshkova, Natalia L; Muhamedrahimov, Rifkat J\n\n2010-07-01\n\nThe study aimed to describe the quality of attachment in the sample of children living in St Petersburg (Russian Federation). Up to the present there were no studies on quality of attachment relationship among infants living in families in the Russian Federation (RF), including families living in St Petersburg. The study results have an important value for understanding of development of attachment patterns in a changing society with a previous history of being a totalitarian state. The St Petersburg sample consisted of 130 children, living in families, aged 11-16 months old (mean = 13.3 months). Children were living in largely normative low-risk families. The Strange Situation Procedure was used (Ainsworth Blehar, Waters, & Wall, 1978). The attachment categories were classified according to the criteria of the DMM model (Crittenden, 2002). Results presented show that 50% of children showed the complex strategies (pre-A3-4 compulsive caregiving and compliant, pre-C3-4 aggressive and feigned helpless, A/C). It was found that among a St Petersburg sample of families there was small number of children with secure attachment pattern and many children with complex attachment strategies.\n\n77 FR 41688 - Security Zones; 2012 Republican National Convention, Captain of the Port St. Petersburg Zone...\n\nFederal Register 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014\n\n2012-07-16\n\n...-AA87 Security Zones; 2012 Republican National Convention, Captain of the Port St. Petersburg Zone... prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port St. Petersburg or a designated representative.

Using survey data from nationally representative samples from Finland in 1971, 1992, and 1999 and from two former Soviet areas, Estonia in 2000 and St. Petersburg in 1996, we investigated the following: (a) differences across decades and countries in acceptance of the sexual double standard (SDS) in attitudes toward marital infidelity and women's initiating sex; and (b) the relationship between the SDS and sexual satisfaction. Results show that Finland in the 1990s was more egalitarian than Finland in 1971, St. Petersburg in 1996, or Estonia in 2000. Egalitarian sexual attitudes were positively related to sexual satisfaction.\n\nAnalyses of rocks and minerals from the laboratory of the United States Geological Survey, 1880 to 1914\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nClarke, Frank Wigglesworth\n\n1915-01-01\n\nThe present Geological Survey of the United States was organized in 1879. In 1880, in connection with the Colorado work, a chemical laboratory was established at Denver in charge of W. F. Hillebrand, with whom were associated Antony Guyard and, later, L. G. Eakins. In 1882 W. H. Melville was placed in charge of a second laboratory at San Francisco, and in the autumn of 1883 the central laboratory was started in Washington, with myself as chief chemist. In November, 1885, Dr. Hillebrand was transferred to Washington; early in 1888 he was followed by Mr. Eakins, and the Denver laboratory was discontinued. In the spring of 1890 Dr. Melville also was transferred to Washington, and since then the geochemical work of the Survey has been concentrated at headquarters. The special laboratories of the water-resources and technologic branches of the Survey are not included in this statement and their work is not represented in this bulletin.Up to January 1, 1914, nearly 8,000 analyses have been made in the laboratory at Washington of rocks, minerals, ores, waters, sediments, coals, metals, and other substances with which geology has to do. Some-hundreds of analyses were also made in the laboratories at Denver and San Francisco. A fair amount of research work upon mineralogical and analytical problems has also been done. In *all of this work the following chemists have been employed: E. T. Allen, R. K. Bailey, Charles Catlett, T. M. Chatard, F. W. Clarke, L. G. Eakins, J. G. Fairchild, F. A. Gooch, Antony Guyard, W. B. Hicks, W. F. Hillebrand, W. F. Hunt, W. H. Melville, H. C. McNeil, Chase Palmer, R. B. Riggs, W. T. Schaller, E. A. Schneider, George Steiger, H. N. Stokes, E. C. Sullivan, William Valentine, R. C. Wells, W. C. Wheeler, and J. E. Whitfield. At present, January 1, 1914, eight of these chemists are employed in the Survey.

It was shown that the MIC of the drugs for the diphtheroids was within the ranges of < 0.015 to > 32.0 micrograms/ml. 66 per cent of the Corynebacterium strains circulating in St. Petersburg was resistant at least to 1 antibacterial drug. The Corynebacterium isolates with moderate resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin (57.3 per cent) and resistant to trimethoprime (16.7 per cent) were the most frequent. 8.0 per cent of the diphtheroids was resistant at least to 4 antibacterial drugs. No significant difference in the susceptibility of the ANF group corynebacteria and C.pseudodiphtheriticum to the drugs was observed. Gentamicin, rifampicin, tetracycline and doxycycline showed high activity against the corynebacteria at present circulating in St. Petersburg. When antibacterial therapy of the infection due to corynebacteria fails it is necessary to estimate antibioticograms of Corynebacterium pure cultures.\n\n44.

Total globally anthropogenic GHG emissions were the highest in the history of the year 2000 to 2010 and reached 49 (4.5) Giga ton CO2eq per year in 2010. Many governments addressed their commitment to reducing GHG emission. The Government of Indonesia (GoI) has released a target in reducing its GHG emissions by 26% from level business as usual by 2020, and this target can be increased up to 41% by international aid. In this study, the GHG emissions for Sumatera Utara province are assessed and divided into six sectors. They are Agricultural, Land Use and Forestry, Energy, Transportation, Industrial, and Waste sectors. The results show that total GHG emissions for Sumatera Utara province in the baseline year 2010 is 191.4 million tons CO2eq. The business-as-usual projection of the GHG emission in 2020 is 354.5 million tons CO2eq. Mitigation actions will reduce GHG emissions up to 30.5% from business as usual emission in 2020.\n\nYa.B.

As part of on-going serial studies, we sought to explore the influence of opioid availability on aspects of the syndemic as it has affected the city of St. Petersburg. We employed a sequential approach in which quantitative data collection and statistical analysis were followed by a qualitative phase. Quantitative data were obtained in 2013-2014 from a respondent-driven sample (RDS) of people who inject drugs (PWID). Individuals recruited by RDS were tested for antibodies to HIV and interviewed about drug use and injection practices, sociodemographics, health status, and access to medical care. Subsequently, we collected in-depth qualitative data on methadone use, knowledge, and market availability from PWID recruited at nine different locations within St. Petersburg. Analysis of interview data from the sample revealed the percentage of PWID injecting methadone in the 30 days prior to interview increased from 3.6% in 2010 to 53.3% in 2012-2013. Injection of only methadone, as compared to injecting only heroin or both drugs, was associated with less frequent injection and reduced HIV-related injected risk, especially a lower rate of injecting with a previously used syringe. In-depth questioning of methadone injectors corroborated the finding from serial quantitative surveys of PWID that methadone's black market availability is a recent phenomenon. Spatial analysis revealed widespread methadone availability but no concentration in any specific districts of the city. Despite the prohibition of substitution therapy and demonization of methadone, the drug has emerged to rival heroin as the most commonly available opioid in St. Petersburg. Ironically, its use is associated with reduced injection-related HIV risk even when its use is illegal. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This study sought to uncover social and structural aspects contributing to fatal overdose risk in St. Petersburg and assess prevention intervention feasibility. Twenty-one key informant interviews were conducted with drug users, treatment providers, toxicologists, police, and ambulance staff. Thematic coding of interview content was conducted to elucidate elements of the overdose risk environment. Several factors within St. Petersburg's environment were identified as shaping illicit drug users' risk behaviours and contributing to conditions of suboptimal response to overdose in the community. Most drug users live and experience overdoses at home, where family and home environment may mediate or moderate risk behaviours. The overdose risk environment is also worsened by inefficient emergency response infrastructure, insufficient cardiopulmonary or naloxone training resources, and the preponderance of abstinence-based treatment approaches to the exclusion of other treatment modalities. However, attitudes of drug users and law enforcement officials generally support overdose prevention intervention feasibility. Modifiable aspects of the risk environment suggest community-based and structural interventions, including overdose response training for drug users and professionals that encompasses naloxone distribution to the users and equipping more ambulances with naloxone. Local social and structural elements influence risk environments for overdose. Interventions at the community and structural levels to prevent and respond to opioid overdoses are needed for and integral to reducing overdose mortality in St. Petersburg.\n\nA Comparison of Secondary Chemistry Courses and Chemistry Teacher Preparation Programs in Iowa and Saint Petersburg, Russia\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSanger, Michael J.; Brincks, Erik L.; Phelps, Amy J.; Pak, Maria S.; Lyovkin, Antony N.\n\n2001-09-01\n\nThis paper, which is a result of the collaboration between the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) in Cedar Falls, Iowa, and Herzen State Pedagogical University of Russia in Saint Petersburg, compares the 7-12 chemistry courses in Iowa and Saint Petersburg and the chemistry teacher preparation programs at UNI and Herzen. Differences in the 7-12 chemistry courses include curriculum design (spiral versus layer cake), students' extracurricular activities, and access to technology in the classroom. Differences in the chemistry teacher preparation programs include the number of methods and chemistry content courses required, the number of chemistry teaching majors, the proportion of teaching majors enrolled in the different natural science programs, and the typical minors and endorsements received by these majors. Although we noted many differences in chemistry instruction between Iowa and Saint Petersburg, the secondary and college instructors still face many similar issues, which include overcoming student chemophobia, improving students' algorithmic and problem-solving skills, improving students' conceptual understanding at the particulate level, and dealing with shortages in qualified secondary science teachers.\n\nThe Education and Employment of Working-Class Girls, 1870-1914.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nHorn, Pamela\n\n1988-01-01\n\nExamines the influence of education upon the lives of British working-class girls between 1870-1914, taking into account the fact that for many, schooling was subordinated to work.

The study sample included 743 students aged 19 to 25 from 15 universities in St. Petersburg, Russia. All of the study participants completed a reliable questionnaire assessing the following types of childhood victimization: conventional crime, child maltreatment, peer victimization, sexual victimization, and witnessing violence. Participation in the study was anonymous. High rates of victimization and exposure to violence were reported by the study participants. The majority of the sample experienced at least one type of victimization during childhood or adolescence, and poly-victimization was reported frequently. The most common type of victimization reported was peer or sibling assault (66.94%), followed by witnessing an assault without weapon (63.91%), personal theft (56.19%), vandalism (56.06%), and emotional bullying (49.99%). Sexual assault by a known adult was reported by 1.45% males and 5.16% of females. This study provides new information on the scope of childhood victimization experiences in Russia. Further research is warranted, including epidemiological research with representative data across the country and studies of the impact of trauma and victimization on mental health and well-being of Russian adults and children.

S.; HÃ¶flich, Peter A.\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe present multi-slit, 1D and 2D optical and UV spectra of the remnant of supernova 1885 (SN 1885; S And) taken using the Hubble Space Telescopeâs Imaging Spectrograph (HST/STIS). These spectra of this probable subluminous Type Ia remnant, seen in silhouette against the central bulge of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), show strong and broad absorptions from neutral and singly ionized species of calcium, magnesium, and iron but with strikingly different distributions. Calcium H and K absorption indicates spherically distributed Ca-rich ejecta, densest in a lumpy shell expanding at 2000-6000 km s-1. Equally broad but weaker Ca I 4227 Ã absorption is seen to extend out to velocities of Ë13,000 km s-1. Magnesium-rich ejecta in the remnant are detected for the first time through Mg I 2852 Ã and Mg II 2796, 2803 Ã absorptions concentrated in a shell with expansion velocities from â 7000 {km} {{{s}}}-1 to at least 10,000 km s-1. Fe I 3720 Ã absorption is detected as two discrete blueshifted and redshifted absorptions suggestive of an Fe I shell with expansion velocities of Â±2000-8000 km s-1. Weak Fe II resonance absorptions in the wavelength region 2300-2700 Ã are consistent with prior HST UV images showing Fe II-rich ejecta confined to a small number of optically thick plumes. The presence of such iron plumes extending out from the remnantâs core plus layered shells of calcium and magnesium point to a delayed-detonation explosion. The spectra also suggest a roughly spherical explosion, contrary to that expected by a merger or collision of two white dwarfs. We conclude that SN 1885 likely was an off-center, delayed-detonation explosion leading to a subluminous SN Ia similar to SN 1986G.

The project is lead by the Geological Survey of Finland (GTK) and the partners in the project are Saimaa University of Applied Sciences from Finland and Federal State Unitary Enterprise \"Petersburg Complex Geological Expedition\" Russian together with Saint-Petersburg State University from the Russian Federation. As associates in this project are also natural stone companies from Finland, YlÃ¤maa Group Oy and Palin Granit Oy. The project is co-funded by the European Union, the Russian Federation and the Republic of Finland through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI). A great potential of natural stone that can be used in construction is located in the border zone between South-East Finland and the Leningrad region. Rapakivi granite from that area has been utilized for several important buildings worldwide since 18th century and the area holds still potential for future economic growth. The use of the stone particularly from this area is based on its visual expression and good properties with high durability and long life cycle that can be used as arguments in the future development. Strengthening of the knowledge of the material reserves in the area gives a long term basement for economic development. Special aim of the project is to promote the use of natural stone in the city construction, especially the use of left-over stone generated in the production. In the project the use of natural stone in larger cities from the 18th century until today including the towns St. Petersburg, Vyborg, Helsinki, Kuopio and Kotka will be reported.

He became widely known as an engineer-scientist, a Professor and industrial consultant, education reformer and leader of the technical elite of Germany. He directed the design and manufacture of over 300 models of simple mechanisms. They were sold to many famous universities for pedagogical and scientific purposes. Today, the most complete set is at Cornell University, College of Engineering. In this article we discuss the history, the modern state and our using the Reuleaux models that survived at St. Petersburg State University for educational purposes. We present description of certain models and our electronic resource with these models. We provide the information of similar electronic resources from other universities.\n\n43 CFR 3813.1 - Minerals reserved by the Act of July 17, 1914, subject to mineral location, entry and patenting.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2013 CFR\n\n2013-10-01\n\n..., 1914, subject to mineral location, entry and patenting. 3813.1 Section 3813.1 Public Lands: Interior... location, entry and patenting.

It lacks sensitive and specific biomarkers. Emerging evidences have suggested that microRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of various leukemias. This paper evaluated the association between microRNA expression and prognostic outcome for CN-AML, based on the RNA/microRNA sequencing data of CN-AML patients. High let-7a-2-3p expression and low miR-188-5p expression were identified to be significantly associated with longer overall survival (OS) and event free survival (EFS) for CN-AML, independently or in a combined way. Their prognostic values were further confirmed in European Leukemia Net (ELN) genetic categories. Also, in multivariable analysis with other known risk factors, high let-7a-2-3p and low miR-188-5p expression remained to be associated with longer OS and EFS. In addition, the prognostic value of these two microRNAs was confirmed in patients who received hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). To gain more biological insights of the underlying mechanisms, we derived the genome-wide differential gene/microRNA signatures associated with the expression of let-7a-2-3p and miR-188-5p. Several common microRNA signatures indicating favorable outcome in previous studies were up-regulated in both high let-7a-2-3p expressers and low miR-188-5p expressers, including miR-135a, miR-335 and miR-125b and all members of miR-181 family. Additionally, common up-regulated genes included FOSB, IGJ, SNORD50A and ZNF502, and FOSB was a known favorable signature in AML. These common signatures further confirmed the underlying common mechanisms for these two microRNAs value as favorable prognostic biomarkers. We concluded that high let-7a-2-3p and low miR-188-5p expression could be potentially used as favorably prognostic biomarkers independently or in a combined way in CN-AML patients, whether they received HSCT or not.

This explosion was the most powerful in a 1914â17 series of eruptions that were the last to occur in the Cascades before the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, Washington. Recent work by scientists with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in cooperation with the National Park Service is shedding new light on these eruptions.\n\nA new species of the genus Linoderus Sharp, 1885 (Coleoptera, Staphylinidae, Philonthina) from the Colombian Andes.\n\nPubMed\n\nLÃ³pez-GarcÃ­a, Margarita M; MÃ©ndez-Rojas, Diana M\n\n2014-05-09\n\nThe monotypic genus Linoderus Sharp, 1885 was described based on a species from Panama and since the original description nearly nothing has been added to its taxonomical knowledge. The aim of the present paper is to describe a new species of the genus from Colombia and to report the genus for the first time from South America, adding some biological notes of the species.\n\nNew optical museum at Saint-Petersburg for education and training\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVasil'ev, V. N.; Stafeef, S. K.; Tomilin, M. G.\n\n2009-06-01\n\nNowadays the educational problem of teaching optics and photonics is to attract the young generation to the wonderful and magic world of light, optical science, technology and systems. The main issue is to explain that in the course of last several hundred years optics has been representing the most clear world view for humanity. In fact, the optics itself is a multidisciplinary complex of independent scientific directions, and, moreover, it has always been a generator of new fields of knowledge. Besides, optics and photonics are the fields within which the most fundamental problems of today's reality are to be resolved. It is absolutely necessary to encourage our scholars in getting optics and photonics education as an alternative physical basis to gaining solely computer knowledge. The main obstacle is the poor connection between program of optical education and the real optical researches, disintegration of different branches of the optical science, the demographic situation, some problems with teaching mathematics and physics at schools, and the collision between traditional educational methods and the mentality of the new generation. In Russia the Saint-Petersburg State University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics offers partial solution to these problems: the organization of a real place for interactive optical science in a form of a new museum of optics, intended for education and training, seems to be the most effective way. This was the main reason for establishing such a museum in Saint-Petersburg at the end of 2008.\n\nLaw and Order in the Classroom: Reconsidering \"A Course on Citizenship,\" 1914\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nEllis, Lindsay\n\n2013-01-0"
