        "text": "Shane Battier\n\nMiami Heat - Forward\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (6th Pick) by the Memphis Grizzlies (2001)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 33 games, 4.4 PPG, 2.0 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.6 BPG\n\nBattier, who has always been a more defensively-minded player, has made it his goal to become more of an offensive contributor for the Heat this season. The Miami Heat went 3-0 this past week to improve to 26-7 overall. The corner three is, as Shane Battier notes, \"the closest shot that is worth the most, and it is an absolute killer if you're playing against it defensively.\" Battier scored six points off two threes while recording two assists and a block in the 111-87 win over Cleveland. The Heat have won six straight games by double digits, which is tied for the second longest such streak in franchise history. Miami is ranked second overall in the NBA averaging 103.8 points per game. The Miami Heat will face the New York Knicks and Linsanity on Thursday night.\n\nCarlos Boozer\n\nChicago Bulls - Forward/Center\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round (35th pick) by the Cleveland Cavaliers (2002)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 34 games, 15.6 PPG, 8.3 RPG, 1.7 APG, 1.0 SPG, 0.4 BPG\n\nBoozer continues to be a dominant offensive powerhouse for the Bulls, who went 2-1 this week. Boozer recorded his seventh double-double of the season scoring a game-high 23 points with a season-high 15 and five assists in the 89-80 win over the Boston Celtics. In the following two games, Boozer scored 32 points, grabbed 24 rebounds and tallied three assists as the Bulls lost the New Jersey Nets 97-85 and defeated the Atlanta Hawks 90-79. In the month of February the Bulls are 8-3, and Boozer is averaging 16.7 points per game and 7.5 rebounds per game. He has scored in double figures in nine of the Bull's eleven games, while shooting 55.5 percent from the floor.\n\nElton Brand\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers - Forward/Center\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (1st pick) by the Chicago Bulls (1999)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 30 Games, 10.1 PPG, 6.7 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.9 SPG, 1.5 BPG\n\nDespite a four-game losing streak, Brand has continued to help the 76ers to a 20-13 overall record and first place standing in the Atlantic conference. Brand, who averages 10.1 points per game, scored eight points while grabbing seven rebounds in a loss that ended when Kevin Love of the Minnesota Timberwolves made two free throws within one-tenth of a second to hand the 76ers another loss. During the fourth quarter, Brand went to block Nikola Pekovic's shot and aggravated a thumb injury. Brand did not play in the 89-76 loss to the Memphis Grizzles and is expected to miss the Houston game which is scheduled for Wed. Feb. 22. According to the 76ers, Brand will rest the thumb through the All-Star break, which will allow the injury time to heal.\n\nLuol Deng\n\nChicago Bulls - Forward/Center\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (7th pick) by the Phoenix Suns (2004)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 24 games, 15.9 PPG, 7.0 RPG, 3.0 APG, 1.2 SPG, 0.8 BPG\n\nSince Deng returned from injury two weeks ago, he continues to be an offensive powerhouse for the Chicago Bulls who went 2-1 this week and improved to 26-8 overall. The Bulls and Celtics faced off in a rematch of last season's memorable seven-game first-round series that included a total of seven overtime periods. Deng, who missed that series due to injury, tied his season high of 23 points - 14 of which were in the fourth quarter - to help solidify the 89-80 win over the Celtics. Deng guarded the Celtic's Paul Pierce and held the small forward to only 14 points. In six of the last seven meetings between the Bulls and Celtics, Deng has held Piece to less than 20 points. Deng scored 10 points, nine rebounds, and four assists to help the Bulls to a 90-79 win over the Atlanta Hawks. Said Deng, \"I don't have to focus as much on creating and everything else in the offense. It's get back to our regular roles on what makes us a great team. Defensively focusing, hustle plays, rebounding.\"\n\nChris Duhon\n\nOrland Magic - Guard\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round (38th pick) by the Chicago Bulls (2004)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 33 Games, 3.4 PPG, 1.7 RPG, 2.7 APG, 0.6 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nDuhon, who is averaging 20.7 minutes per game, continues to be an effective player off the bench for the Orlando Magic. He scored four points and tallied an assist and a block in 16 minutes of action in the 94-85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks. Duhon scored one point and tallied one rebound and two assists in the 90-78 loss to the Miami Heat. He averages 3.4 points per game and is shooting 38.8 percent from the floor.\n\nMike Dunleavy\n\nMilwaukee Bucks - Guard/Forward\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (3rd pick) by the Golden State Warriors (2002)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 22 Games, 10.6 PPG, 3.2 RPG, 1.9 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.2 BPG\n\nDunleavy remains a solid off-the-bench player for the Milwaukee Bucks, but was held to just seven points, four rebounds, and two assists in a 94-85 loss to the Orlando Magic. Three days later, Dunleavy redeemed himself by racking up 18 points, six rebounds, and one assist in a rematch with the Magic. The Milwaukee Bucks are now 13-19 overall and fourth in the Central Conference.\n\nGerald Henderson\n\nCharlotte Bobcats - Shooting Guard\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (12th pick) by the Charlotte Bobcats (2009)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 21 games, 15.0 PPG, 4.4 RPG, 1.8 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.4 BPG\n\nHenderson is still out due to an injury to his right hamstring sustained during the 112-68 loss to the Portland Trailblazers. Henderson did participate in a light practice on Tuesday Feb. 21 and said, \"I got into a full sprint and did a little jumping. It feels good - (the pain) is almost out of there.\" After losing 16 straight games, the Bobcats were able to rally and pull out a 98-91 win over the Toronto Raptors last Friday. Bobcat's head coach Paul Silas believes that once he gets all three starters back from injury, he'll field a far more competitive team.\n\nGrant Hill\n\nPhoenix Suns - Forward\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (3rd pick) by the Detroit Pistons (1994)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 31 Games, 9.5 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 2.0 APG, 0.7 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nHill remains a consistent contributor for the Phoenix Suns and helped them to a 2-2 record for the week. He had 18 points, six boards, two assists and one steal in 37 minutes in the 101-99 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. The Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers then faced off in back-to-back games with the Suns losing the first game 111-99 and defeating the Lakers 102-90 in game two. In the second game, Grant tallied 15 points, three rebounds, and two assists. In the last five games, Hill is shooting 45.2 percent from the field and averaging 13 points per game. The Suns are 14-19 overall.\n\nKyrie Irving\n\nCleveland Cavaliers - Point Guard\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (1st pick) by the Cleveland Cavaliers (2011)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 27 games, 18.6 PPG, 3.5 RGP, 4.9 APG, 0.9 SPG, 0.6 BPG\n\nIrving, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft continues to impress not only with his ball-handling and scoring skills, but also his ability to repeatedly deliver in clutch situations. Irving scored 17 points, grabbed four rebounds and dished out two assists against Miami in a game that was tied 17 times and had 19 lead changes before the Heat pulled away to a 111-87 win. Irving and his team were able to bounce back Friday night against the Sacramento Kings when Irving stepped to the foul line with 0.4 seconds left to hit two clutch free throws and to lift the Cav's to a 93-92 win. Irving finished the night with 23 points, three rebounds, two blocks, and an assist. After trailing the Pistons by 17 points, Irving and the Cavs were able to rally and win 101-100. Irving had 17 of his 25 points in the fourth quarter, while also grabbing five rebounds and recording eight assists.\n\nDahntay Jones\n\nIndiana Pacers - Guard/Forward (2003)\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (20th pick) by the Boston Celtics\n\n2011-12 Stats: 32 Games, 5.3 PPG, 1.9 RPG, 0.8 APG, 0.3 SPG, 0.2 BPG\n\nJones, who has been a regular contributor for the Pacers off the bench, recorded his second start of the season in place of the injured Danny Granger last Wednesday against the Cleveland Cavaliers. Jones had three points and five rebounds and saw 37 minutes of action in the 98-87 loss. He tied his season high 12 points, shooting 5-of-8 from the floor, and recorded one rebound and one assist in the 108-73 win over the Charlotte Bobcats. Jones helped the Pacers to a 3-1 week and help Indiana improve to 20-12 overall.\n\nCorey Maggette\n\nCharlotte Bobcats - Forward\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (13th pick) by the Seattle SuperSonics (1999)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 12 Games, 12.9 PPG, 4.8 RPG, 1.1 APG, 0.6 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nMaggette, who averages 27.5 minutes per game, helped break a 16-game losing streak and lead the Bobcats to a 1-2 week.

Redick\n\nOrlando Magic - Shooting Guard\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (11th pick) by the Orlando Magic (2006)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 33 Games, 11.2 PPG, 2.2 RPG, 2.1 APG, 0.3 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nRedick remains a solid role player off the bench for the Orlando Magic, averaging 25.7 minutes per game.
