Magalhães, and Luísa Carvalho\n\n1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels: surface quality evaluation Abstract: High-pressure laminates (HPL), manufactured with paper and thermosetting resins, are a value-added product that has been increasingly used for home and commercial surfaces and a practical solution for horizontal or vertical surfaces that require high physical, mechanical, and chemical performances, with a high versatility and excellent decoration ability. Intensive applications as scholar furniture with mar resistance, abrasion resistance, and dirt repellent; laboratory countertops with chemical resistance and dirt repellent; exterior ﬂooring with UV resistance, mar resistance, and abrasion resistance; technical ﬂooring with phosphorescent properties, abrasion and mar resistance for public buildings; hospital furniture with dirt repellence and antimicrobial properties; whiteboards with mar and abrasion resistance demands the introduction of advanced functionalities in high-pressure laminates not existent in the market. The development of innovative impregnation resins with new functionalities could result in multifunctional laminates as the result of the combination of new and better properties. In this chapter, the focus is on the production and characterization of decorative laminates, as well as the modiﬁcation of this material in order to provide advanced functionalities. Keywords: high-pressure laminates, advanced functionalities\n\n1.1 The HPL and its manufacture 1.1.1 Introduction According to the European Standard EN 438-2 [1] a high pressure laminate (Fig. 1.1) consists of layers of cellulosic ﬁbrous material. These layers consisting of an assembly of kraft paper sheets impregnated with thermosetting resins (the number of such sheets is dependent on the intended thickness), a printed or patterned layer designated as the decorative paper impregnated with a melamine resin, and in some cases an overlay paper sheet on the surface [2]. The decorative paper represents a cost between 2.1 and 18.4 % of HPL total price, the kraft paper a cost between 17.3 and 32.2 %, the phenolic resin between 11.5 and 28.2 %, the overlay between 0.5 and 3.4 %, the melamine resin between 1.2 and 10.4 %, and the energy between 6.9 and 8.2 % to the manufacturer [3]. DOI 10.1515/9783110416084-001\n\n2 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\nFig. 1.1: High-pressure laminates (courtesy of Sonae Indústria de Revestimentos).\n\nDecorative HPL are available in a wide range of colors, patterns, and abstracts combined with different textures and gloss levels. Excellent reproductions of natural materials such as textiles, fabrics, exotic wood veneers, and stone can be achieved. Different printing technologies, e.g. digital, screen, and offset printing, can be used to produce customized designs. Because of their impervious surfaces, HPL are easy to clean and maintain. Offered in various sizes, they allow large areas to be covered without seams. The manufacture of such laminates commonly starts with impregnation of decorative and kraft papers (Fig. 1.2 (a)). After a drying process, the impregnated paper sheets are bonded together by high-pressure pressing (Fig. 1.2 (b)). The high pressure is deﬁned as the simultaneous application of heat (temperature ≥ 120 °C) and high pressure (5 MPa), to provide ﬂowing and subsequent curing of the melamine and the phenolic resins. Curing the melamine resin makes the surface hard, providing scratch and damage resistance, while curing the phenolic resin bonds the kraft layers together and developing water resistance. The press cycle time is designed to cure the lami-\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1.2: (a) Impregnation and (b) pressing process (courtesy of Sonae Indústria de Revestimentos).\n\n1.1 The HPL and its manufacture | 3\n\nnates within the pack as uniformly as possible, so that they all perform the same. The longer they are pressed, the more extensively cured and less ﬂexible is the laminate. The market share of laminates has been growing over the years. Global demand for decorative laminates is expected to rise 5.6 % per year to 10.7 billion m2 in 2018, valued at US$ 40.8 billion [4]. Due to its durability and versatility, HPL is a common choice for horizontal and vertical applications in the construction and furnishing industries for high traffic settings such as hospitality, office furniture, healthcare, retail casework, commercial interiors, and education facilities [5]. Furniture and cabinets were the largest market for decorative laminates in 2013, accounting for nearly 70 % of the total demand. However, the expected increase of ready-to-assemble (RTA) furniture and ﬂooring, which are made from engineered wood and laminates, will beneﬁt from the demand of these products [4]. Nowadays, Paciﬁc Asia represents the largest and fastest growing market for decorative laminates, followed by North America and Europe. The Chinese market alone accounted for 31 % of the global demand in 2013. India is expected to post the most rapid gains in laminate demands worldwide through 2018 [4]. Increasing available income, constant economic growth, rising standards of living, and increased demand for housing in urban areas are some of the key growth drivers in the Paciﬁc Asian region. Increasing available income allow the customer to spend more on furniture, home accessories, and furnishings, among which decorative laminates play a key role. Additionally, a wide range of colors, designs, textures, and styles led to increased consumer interest and is expected to provide ample growth opportunities for the decorative laminates market [5]. Germany, France, and Sweden, where wood and paper industries are highly developed, are regional leaders in RTA furniture. The US also has a signiﬁcant production capacity for RTA furniture, cabinets, and laminate ﬂooring. Laminate counter tops and laminated doors will beneﬁt from an acceleration of building construction in 2018. Laminate countertops face competition of other products as natural stone, engineered quartz, and solid surface, while in doors vinyl ﬁlms are also gaining a market share [4]. The major companies operating in the decorative laminates market include Formica Group, FunderMax, Kingboard Laminates Holdings Ltd., ABET Laminati, ARPA, Sonae Indústria de Revestimentos, Ronotex GmbH & Co., Kronospan Holdings Limited, Advanced Technology Inc., Armstrong World Industries Inc., Roseburg Forest Products Company, Sekisui Chemical Company Limited, Sierra Pine Ltd., Tarkett SA, Timber Products Company, Woodcraft Industries Incorporated, OMNOVA Solutions Inc., Wilsonart International and Trespa [5].\n\n4 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\n1.1.2 The raw materials 1.1.2.1 Paper Three types of paper are used in the manufacture of HPL: kraft, decorative and overlay paper (Fig. 1.3). The kraft is used in the bottom layers. This type of paper, impregnated with phenolic resin, provides mechanical resistance, moisture and chemical resistance to HPL. The mechanical resistance depends on ﬁbre orientation. The weight of kraft paper is around 43 to 300 g/m2 . Decorative foils are alpha-cellulose papers with weights ranging between 40 and 200 g/m2 . The decorative paper should have good mechanical properties, quick resin absorption combined with sufficient mechanical resistance when humid, high opacity, and homogeneous ﬁber orientation. Furthermore, it should comply with general requirements related to capillary absorption, porosity, air permeability, durability in dry or humid conditions, surface pH, and speciﬁc requirements related to appearance characteristics as light resistance, smoothness, color, and pattern. The overlay paper, mainly composed of alpha-cellulose, is placed over the decorative paper and is generally impregnated with melamine resin. When pressed over the decorative paper, it becomes transparent or translucent and allows a clear view of the decorative layer. It contributes to an increase of the resistance to staining, scratching and abrasion, which allows use in ﬂooring applications. For that purpose mineral particles such as silica, alumina, corundum, or tungsten carbide are added. This kind of paper has an initial weight between 24 and 32 g/m2 .\n\nOverlay paper (melamine resin) Decorative paper (melamine resin) Kraft paper (phenolic resin) Fig. 1.3: Paper used in the manufacture of HPL.\n\n1.1.2.2 Melamine formaldehyde resin The most common resins used in the impregnation of decorative paper are melamine formaldehyde resins (MF resins). These are used because of their unique surface properties in terms of hardness, chemical stability, and transparency, which allow brilliant visual appearance of the surface decors and good performance in use at reasonable prizes [6].\n\n1.1 The HPL and its manufacture | 5\n\nHowever, these resins also present some disadvantages, such as poor long-term oxidation resistance and susceptibility to attack by strong acids and bases [7]. Melamine formaldehyde (MF) resins are a prominent type of aminoplastics. In the ﬁrst step (methylolation), depending on the reaction conditions (mainly the melamine-to-formaldehyde molar ratio), up to six molecules of formaldehyde may react with melamine to form water-soluble methylolated melamine compounds, also known as methylols. These methylols may further condense under liberation of water to form MF prepolymers, which consist of either methylene- or methylene ether-bridged melamine rings. Typically, MF resin prepolymers intended for paper impregnation are of low molecular weight and consist of a statistical mixture of oligomers with about three to ﬁve melamine units, in oder to keep the viscosity low and allow for good paper penetration [8]. The main properties of melamine-formaldehyde resins are described in Tab. 1.1. During MF synthesis, the most important parameters are: – molar ratio of the different monomers: – molar ratio formaldehyde/melamine (F/M); – molar ratio formaldehyde/amine groups (F/N2 ); – solid content; – raw materials purity; – synthesis process: – pH; – Temperature; – Sequence and addition of different raw materials; – Length of the different stages of synthesis. The effective curing temperature range of MF resins starts at about 100 °C and reaches the optimum at approximately 150 °C [9]. Tab. 1.1: Main properties of melamine-formaldehyde resins.

As a ﬁrst step, the décor paper is impregnated with resin, where the paper is soaked in the impregnated resin and then dried. In a second step, the impregnated paper is coated with the impregnated resin and then dried to ﬁnal moisture content of 6–7 % and generally a weight between 60 to 130 g/m2 [10, 11]. An important quality estimate used by the industry to characterize dried semiﬁnished paper sheets is the amount of volatiles in the impregnated ﬁlm, which is dominated mainly by the moisture content. The determination of the residual moisture content (volatile content) occurred by differential weighing after a 5 min drying at 160 °C. If the moisture content is too high the stacked or rolled sheets are often found to stick together (block formation). On the other hand, if the content is too low the resin often has lost too much reactivity during impregnation and drying already, so that it will not show sufficient adhesion when ﬁnally laminated onto the carrier board. In both cases, the resin does not allow for forming surfaces that fulﬁl the customer’s requirements [6]. Another important feature is the ﬂow that represents the amount of excess resin in the sample. Flow is determined from weight differences after pressing a 3 inch diameter piece, partially cured, submitted to pressing and temperature for 5 min. After the pressing process, the disk laminate is cooled and weighed (initial weight). After removing the resin, which has ﬂowed out of the disk (the amount of resin located at the side of the blank), the laminate is weighed again (ﬁnal weight). The difference between the initial and ﬁnal weight, related to the weight of the original disk laminate, gives the ﬂow of the impregnate [12]. The wettability of paper by impregnation resins is a very important to ensure a correct impregnation of paper with the resin. The penetration of resin in paper is a complex process, which involves a series of physicochemical process (wetting phenomena, viscous drag, etc.). In paper, the lower the contact angle of the ﬂuid with the sheet is, the higher the penetration into paper, due to higher capillary pressure according the Young–Laplace–Gauss theory (equation (1.1)): P = 2𝛶 cos Θ𝛶 .\n\n(1.1)\n\nContact angles can be measured in a surface energy evaluation system (Fig. 1.4) using the sessile drop method. The probe liquids can be the impregnation resins as melamine, polyurethane, or phenolic resin. The drop image is acquired using a CCD camera, and the corresponding contact angle is calculated after ﬁtting the drop contour line to an ellipse. Contact angles of resins in different papers used in the laminate could be evaluated, e.g, the contact angle between melamine and polyurethane resins\n\n1.1 The HPL and its manufacture | 7\n\nFig. 1.4: Contact Angle System Dataphysics OCA 20.\n\nwith decorative paper, phenolic resin with kraft paper, and water with a high-pressure laminate. Normally the static mode is used, and the data acquisition should be performed at a frequency of one sample per second. The droplet volume is usually 4 µl. For each sample, an average of the contact angles of three drops of each liquid should be considering by measuring at different sites of the substrate. Contact angles should be measured over time during approximately 60 s allowing the drop to reach the equilibrium. The determination of surface energy-free energy of papers is also important to evaluate the affinity of paper towards layers to phenolic resins, thus predetermining the variable penetration/withdrawal of resin upon industrial impregnation and providing a homogeneous distribution of resin in depth of impregnated papers. The measurements of contact angles are also important to assess the quality of the ﬁnal surface, namely dirt repellence. The equipment ABES (automated bonded evaluation system) designed by Philip Humphrey [13] can be used to study the degree of cure of the resin in impregnated papers. It provides a quantitative means for evaluating the dynamics of bond strength development under highly controlled conditions, including those that may occur during manufacture of HPL or melamine-faced boards [14]. To test different impregnated papers (e.g. kraft, decorative, and overlay), they are cut into (117 × 20 mm) strips using a pneumatically driven cutting device used for standardized ABES sample preparation. Due to the different mechanical properties of the impregnated papers (kraft, decorative, and overlay) and their different thickness, several sample conﬁgurations\n\n8 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels can be selected, always with a standard overlap area of 100 mm2 (20 × 5 mm). It is possible to test several different types of bonds that occur on HPL (e.g. overlay paper over decorative paper, decorative paper over kraft paper, and kraft paper over kraft paper). After the conﬁguration is established, the specimen is put in the device and pressed in a miniature hotpress. Immediately after curing to a preselected extension (pressing time), the press opens and the lap-shear specimen is tested in shear mode (Fig. 1.5). Tensile load and pulling head movement are monitored until failure occurs.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1.5: ABES equipment.\n\n1.1.3.2 The pressing process After the impregnation process, the paper is cut to size and stacked. The number of kraft sheets placed in the stack depends on the intended thickness of the HPL. The stack is then loaded onto the laminating press. It is important to notice that the layer structures, paper used, resins properties and pressing operating conditions (time, temperature) inﬂuence the HPL characteristics. A pressing time too long can cause excessive resin curing, and the paper becomes too brittle. If the time is too short, curing is insufficient, the laminate tends to stick to the press plate, and the physical and chemical performances of the product surface are negatively affected.\n\n1.2 HPL properties 1.2.1 Test methods for HPL characterization EN 438 standard speciﬁes the methods of test for determination of the properties of high-pressure laminates, namely: determination of thickness, determination of length and width, determination of edge straightness, determination of edge squareness, determination of ﬂatness, resistance to surface wear, resistance to abrasion, resistance to immersion in boiling water, resistance to water vapor, resistance to wet conditions, resistance to dry heat, dimensional stability at elevated temperature, dimensional stability at ambient temperature, resistance to climatic shock, resistance to impact by a small-diameter ball, resistance to impact by a large-diameter ball, resistance to crack-\n\n1.2 HPL properties |\n\n9\n\ning under stress, resistance to crazing, resistance to scratching, resistance to staining, lightfastness, resistance to UV light, resistance to artiﬁcial weathering, resistance to cigarette burns, and resistance to blistering.\n\n1.2.1.1 Assessment of appearance The laminates are inspected for surface appearance under standardized conditions of lighting and viewing. A horizontal inspection table, with a height of approximately 700 mm and large enough to accommodate the largest sheets to be inspected, is used. The light source provides a diffused illumination of (1200 ± 400) lx over the whole area of the largest sheets to be inspected. This may be either diffused daylight or diffused artiﬁcial daylight. The laminates are observed at a convenient distance, approximately 1.5 m, of the lights from the inspection table.\n\n1.2.1.2 Resistance to surface wear According to EN 438-2, this test measures the ability of the decorative surface of the laminate being tested to resist abrasive wear through to the sublayer. Abrasion is achieved by rotating a specimen in contact with a pair of loaded cylindrical wheels covered with abrasive paper. As the wheels are turned by the rotating specimen, they abrade an annular track on the specimen’s surface. The numbers of revolutions of the specimen required to cause deﬁned degrees of abrasion are used as measures of resistance to surface wear. This test is not applicable to ﬂooring grade laminates. An apparatus Taber model 5135 is generally used (Fig. 1.6). Two wheels are prepared with preconditioned unused abrasive paper. Then the wheels are ﬁtted to the machine, and the specimen is clamped in the holder. The wheels are lowered onto the specimen starting the abrading step. At the beginning of the test, the specimen should be observed after each 25 revolutions. The test con-\n\nFig. 1.6: The TABER® rotary platform abrasion tester – Model 5135 – taber abraser.\n\n10 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\nFig. 1.7: Exceeded IWP in surface wear test.\n\ntinues until the initial wear point (IP) is reached, which is deﬁned as the point at which the ﬁrst clearly recognisable wear-through of the print, pattern, or plain color appears and the sublayer becomes visible in three quadrants (Fig. 1.7). The IP is recorded as the number of revolutions. The resistance to surface wear of the laminate under test is the IP rounded to the nearest 50 revolutions or, in case of complaints, the average of the three specimen IP, rounded to the nearest 50 revolutions.\n\n1.2.1.3 Resistance to abrasion (ﬂooring-grade laminates) This test measures the ability of the decorative surface of the laminate being tested to resist abrasive wear-through to the sublayer (EN 438-2). The test is similar to the former one. The specimen rotates in contact with a pair of loaded cylindrical wheels covered with abrasive paper. As the wheels are turned by the rotating specimen, they scratch an annular track on the specimen’s surface. The number of revolutions of the specimen required to cause a deﬁned degree of abrasion is used as measures of resistance to abrasion. This test is applicable only to ﬂooring-grade laminates. The same apparatus of the previous test method is used (see Fig. 1.6). The initial procedure is similar. The specimen is observed after each 100 revolutions, and the abrasive papers should be renewed after every 200 revolutions, until the initial wear point (IP) is reached, as described in the previous test. The initial wear point (IP) is the point at which the ﬁrst clearly recognizable wearthrough on the print, pattern or plain color appears and the sublayer becomes exposed in three quadrants. The initial wear point is reached when there are areas of at least 0.60 mm2 wear-through in two quadrants and an area of 0.60 mm2 wear-through becomes visible in a third quadrant. The sublayer for printed patterns is the background on which the pattern is printed; for plain colors it is the ﬁrst sublayer of different color.\n\n1.2 HPL properties |\n\nAC1\n\nAC2\n\n∙Light residential ∙Most residential use spaces ∙Infrequent traffic ∙Moderate foot (i.e.bedroom) traffic (i.e. living room or dining room)\n\nAC3\n\n∙High-traffic rooms ∙Commercial space with light traffic (i.e. small officers)\n\nAC4\n\n∙All residential uses ∙Heavily traffic commercial areas\n\n11\n\nAC5\n\nCommercial use in high– traffic spaces (i.e. department stores and public bulding)\n\nFig. 1.8: AC rating for abrasion resistance [15].\n\nThe number of revolutions is recorded as the IP-value. The resistance to abrasion of the laminate being tested is the average of the initial wear-point (IP) values obtained on three specimens, rounded to the nearest 100 revolutions. Taber Industries [15] suggests an AC rating for abrasion resistance (Fig. 1.8).\n\n1.2.1.4 Resistance to immersion in boiling water The effect of immersion in boiling water for 2 h is determined by the increase in mass and thickness of test specimens and by noting any change in appearance, according to EN 438-2. Four specimens are taken from the same laminate with 50 ± 1 mm square, and of the thickness of the laminate being tested, and cut in such a way that no appreciable heat is generated and the edges are free from cracks. Cut edges should be smooth. Each specimen is weighed to the nearest 1 mg, and the thickness is measured at the middle of each of the four cut edges. The specimens are placed in a vessel containing boiling distilled water. After 120 ± 5 min, the specimens are removed from the boiling water and allowed to cool for 15 ± 5 min in the vessel of distilled water maintained at 23 ± 2 °C (Fig. 1.9). The specimens are dried with a clean dry cloth and then weighed again to the nearest 1 mg. The percentage by mass of boiling water absorbed by the laminate under test and the percentage increase in thickness are the average of the values obtained on the three specimens.\n\nResistance to water vapor According to EN 438-2, this test determines the ability of the laminate surface to resist water vapor. A specimen of 100 × 100 mm, cut from the laminate being tested, is held in place over the neck of a ﬂask containing boiling water, so that the decorative surface of the\n\n12 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\nFig. 1.9: Resistance to immersion in boiling water.\n\nFig. 1.10: Resistance to water vapor.\n\nTab. 1.2: Rating scale for surface appearance in resistance to immersion in boiling water test.

After 1 h the specimen is removed and allowed to recover for 24 h in normal ambient conditions before examination. The result of the examination, in terms of change in appearance, is expressed in accordance with the following rating scale speciﬁed in Tab. 1.2.\n\n1.2.1.5 Resistance to dry heat This test determines the suitability of decorative laminates for use in kitchens, where contact with moderately hot cooking utensils can occur (EN 438-2).\n\n1.2 HPL properties |\n\n13\n\nThe laminate specimen bonded to chipboard is put in contact with a standard aluminium alloy block (Fig. 1.11) with a given speciﬁc heat, initially at a speciﬁed test temperature of 160 °C, and is cooled down for 20 min. After this time has elapsed, the block is removed. Resistance to the test conditions is assessed by visual examination in accordance with the rating scale speciﬁed in Tab. 1.3.\n\nFig. 1.11: Apparatus for the dry heat test.\n\nTab. 1.3: Rating scale for surface appearance in dry heat resistance test.

On the ﬁrst day, four specimens are placed in a hot wet conditioning chamber for 8 h, and then the procedure described in Tab. 1.4 is followed. After 4 cycles, the specimens are assessed in accordance with the rating scale speciﬁed in Tab. 1.5. All the specimens and control specimens are tested for ﬂexural strength and modulus of elasticity in ﬂexure in accordance with EN ISO 178 [16].\n\n14 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\nTab. 1.4: The 5-day test cycle.

The resistance to impact is measured as the spring force for which no visible damage occurs (Fig. 1.12). The impact resistance of the laminate being tested is the maximum value of the spring force, in Newtons, for which no damage occurs in a series of ﬁve strikes.\n\n1.2.1.8 Resistance to scratching The resistance to scratching of the decorative laminate sheet being tested is expressed as a numerical rating which deﬁnes the maximum applied load which does not produce a continuous surface scratch (EN 438-2). A test specimen square measuring 100 ± 1 mm is cut from the sheet being tested, and a scratch testing apparatus with a diamond scratching point is used (Fig. 1.13).\n\n1.2 HPL properties |\n\n15\n\nFig. 1.12: Impact tester with support ﬁxture for impact tester.\n\nFig. 1.13: Type of apparatus for measuring resistance to scratching.\n\nThis equipment permits to apply a load with an accuracy of ±0.1 N to the scratching point, since it has a moveable weight that according its position permits ﬁxation of the load. The diamond scratching point is hemispherical, with a point radius of 0.090 ± 0.003 mm and an included angle of 90 ± 1°. The height of the arm is adjusted so that it is horizontal when the diamond point rests on the test specimen. The test starts by making two scratches at 1.0 N load with a spacing of 1 to 2 mm between the scratch marks. This procedure is repeated on the same specimen with loads of 2.0 N, 4.0 N, and 6.0 N, leaving a space of 3–5 mm between each pair of scratches. The specimen is removed from the apparatus, and the scratched area of the surface is rubbed with a suitable contrast medium to help the observation of the scratches using a viewing enclosure.\n\n16 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\nFig. 1.14: Type of apparatus to observe surface damage after testing.\n\nTab. 1.6: Rating scale for scratch resistance.

The scratch resistance of the laminate being tested is expressed in accordance with the rating scale shown in Tab. 1.6.\n\n1.2.1.9 Resistance to staining The staining resistance method (EN 438-2) determines the chemical resistance of HPL when in contact with a series of agents. The time and conditions of contact are speciﬁed for each agent. At the end of the speciﬁed contact period, the specimens are washed and examined for residual surface marks. In Tab. 1.7, the list of staining agents of EN 438-2, organized in three groups, is presented. The reference agents of each group are marked with an asterisk; if the laminate under test meets speciﬁcation requirements when tested with each of the ﬁve staining agents marked with an asterisk and underlined, then it is considered to comply with the speciﬁcation for stain resistance. In the case of a speciﬁc complaint, the staining agent in question (selected from Group 1, 2, or 3) is used to verify the quality of the laminate (Tab. 1.7). This test method may also be applied using other staining agents to cover speciﬁc requirements, e.g. other chemicals.\n\n1.2 HPL properties |\n\n17\n\nA disc is immersed into the staining agent for between 30 and 60 s, quickly placed on the test surface. and immediately covered with an inverted glass Petri dish.

The apparatus is speciﬁed in EN ISO 4892-3 [17]: a test chamber with eight ﬂuorescent UV-Iamps, a heated water pan, test specimen rack, and provisions for controlling and indicating operation times and temperature (Fig. 1.15). The lamps are UV-B lamps of 40 W with a peak emission at 313 nm and a spectral energy distribution as speciﬁed in EN ISO 4892-3. Usually two specimens are cut from the laminate. One specimen is exposed, and the other (the control specimen) is kept in dark conditions. According to EN ISO 4892-3, the specimens are cycled through periods of exposure to UV radiation, followed by periods of no radiation, where the samples are turned to the inside lamps.\n\n1.2 HPL properties |\n\n19\n\nFig. 1.15: UV chamber.\n\nTab. 1.9: Rating scale for staining resistance test.

Any change of appearance of the test specimen is assessed using the same rating scale as the previous test (Tab. 1.9). Quantitative assessment can be carried out using a color meter and a gloss meter.\n\n1.2.1.12 Resistance to cigarette burns This test is intended to determine the ability of decorative laminates to resist heat from a burning cigarette placed on the surface. Three test pieces (each 100 × 100 mm) are cut out of the laminates. For this test, pale tobacco ﬁlter cigarettes from each of three wellknown brands are used. The cigarette is ignited and allowed to burn approximately 10 mm. Then the burning cigarette is placed for full-length contact with the horizontal surface of the specimen in a draught-free area. The glued seam of the cigarette should not be in contact with the specimen. The cigarette continues burning until an additional 20 mm length is consumed. If the cigarette goes out before this occurs, the test must be repeated (Fig. 1.17). The surface is cleaned with a soft cloth moistened with ethanol to remove any combustion residues. The surface is examined, and the assessment is done in accordance to the rating scale speciﬁed in Tab. 1.10.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 1.17: Cigarette test in high-pressure laminates.\n\n(c)\n\n1.2 HPL properties |\n\n21\n\nTab. 1.10: Rating scale for cigarette burn resistance.

Using either a specular gloss meter or a reﬂectometer (Fig. 1.18) the aim of this test is to assess the specular gloss of the test piece as a numerical value or to compare the specular gloss of the test piece against a master sample.\n\nFig. 1.18: Specular gloss meter/reﬂectometer.\n\nA 200 × 200 mm test piece is cut from the laminate being tested. When different designs and surface ﬁnishes are used the surface for comparison should be stated. The gloss meter is placed on the surface of the test piece. Measurements are carried out using a gloss meter with the speciﬁed geometries and according to the following procedure: measure the gloss using the 60° geometry method. If the result is > 70 units (high specular gloss), additional measurements shall be carried out using the 20° geometry method. At least 2 measurements are carried out in each of the four directions of the board (longitudinal and transverse) at the determined angle. The mean value for each direction is calculated.\n\n1.2.1.14 Determination of color of HPL The aim of this test is to measure the surface color level of laminates when there are doubts about the intensity of color, yellowing, mate surfaces, etc. The equipment used – a color meter (Fig. 1.19) – has a light source and three ﬁlters that simulate the behavior of human vision and measure the amount of light reﬂected by the sample. Colors can be described by means of a qualitative or quantitative system.\n\n22 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\nFig. 1.19: Color meter.\n\nThe qualitative system CIELAB is a color space speciﬁed by the CIE (Commission internationale de l’éclairage) and indicates if the sample is lighter, darker, redder, greener, more or less yellow, or blue compared with a standard piece. According to this system, the color is described by 3 coordinates: L∗ represents the lightness, a∗ represents the content from red to green and b∗ represents the content from yellow to blue. ∆L∗ , ∆a∗ , ∆b∗ represent the differences between the tested sample and the standard piece, and can be calculated by the difference between the coordinate value of the sample and the coordinate value of control. The color difference ∆E∗ can be calculated using equation (1.2): ∆L∗ = L∗sample − L∗control , ∆a∗ = a∗sample − a∗control , ∆b∗ = b∗sample − b∗control ,\n\n(1.2)\n\n∆E∗ = √(∆L∗ )2 + (∆a∗ )2 + (∆b∗ )2 .\n\n1.2.2 HPL speciﬁcations The type of ﬁnal applications could change the main properties and speciﬁcations desired in a high-pressure laminate.

Mar resistance is the resistance of the coating surface to permanent superﬁcial damage, as a consequent of the application of dynamic mechanical forces [18]. In order to introduce this property in HPL, there are some strategies that report the incorporation of additives in the decorative paper impregnation resin. U.S. Patent No. US 4532170 A (1985) [19] proposes the production of a high-pressure laminate with scuff resistance by incorporating ﬁnely divided polyethylene wax having a particle size of about 1–25 microns and a melting point of 220–230 °F. The wax is incorporated as part of a coating mixture applied to the face of a nonimpregnated décor paper sheet in an ultra-thin layer, and then impregnated with conventional melamine formaldehyde resin. The use of an ultra-thin facing layer comprising abrasion-resistant particles and sufficient binder material has also been reported [20]. Another proposed solu-\n\n24 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\ntion consists of the use of a combination of a thermosetting resin, substantially fully hydrolyzed polyvinyl alcohol, fumed amorphous silica, and particulate abrasive material with a hardness higher than that of silica [21]. However, incorporation of abrasive materials in paper often results in severe damage to the delicate, highly polished, or intricately etched surfaces of the press plates when the abrasive particles deposited in the papers come into contact with them [22] . The damage in the press plates requires replacement or reconditioning, which implies an extremely high cost. Therefore, new studies were done in with the aim of protecting the plate ﬁnish, namely the use of mixture of melamine formaldehyde resin, alumina particles, a silane coupling agent, and a thickening agent, that suspends the alumina and protects the plates in the impregnation and coating process [23]. Another approach was to treat the surface of the ﬁnishing plates in order to make them more resistant [24]. Wilsonart® HD® High Deﬁniton® Laminates and AR Plus® are high-pressure laminates with mar resistance.\n\n1.3.2 Abrasion resistance When a product has abrasion resistance, it will resist to the erosion caused by scraping, rubbing, or other types of mechanical wear. This allows the material to retain its integrity and keep its form. This feature is particularly important in horizontal applications where wear is accentuated, in particular in products for ﬂooring applications. Nowadays, in HPL, abrasion resistance is provided by adding aluminum trioxide (corundum) particles to the melamine resin used to impregnate the decorative or overlay papers. The ﬁner the particle size of the corundum, the greater must be the amount applied to the decorative paper in order to achieve sufficient wear resistance [25]. Another approach involves addition of organosilica particles, produced by sol-gel method, to the impregnation resin of the decorative and/or the overlay papers [26]. Commercially there is the MONOCHROM from Polyrey with this feature.\n\n1.3.3 Resistance against strong chemicals Taking into account the exceptional mechanical strength properties of HPL, it is important to improve its resistance to strong chemical agents, making them a solution for use in different types of laboratories such as research, photographic, and cosmetic. In order to develop HPL with higher chemical resistance, many solutions have been described in patents. It is suggested that a chemical-resistant decorative laminate made with a bottom portion impregnated with phenolic resin, a top portion impregnated and coated with vinyl ester terminated bisphenol A epoxy resin, and a middle portion impregnated with aminotriazine-aldehyde resin which acts as a barrier to phenolic resin contact with the vinyl ester terminated bisphenol A epoxy resin.\n\n1.3 Upgrading HPL characteristics | 25\n\nThese resins present a viscosity between 400 and 800 cP. In order to control the viscosity some thixotropic agents were added [27]. It was also proposed to coat the decorative paper with vinyl ester terminated bisphenol A epoxy resin matrix containing hollow plastic microspheres through its thickness [28]. When these laminates were put into contact with sodium hydroxide 10 % and 50 %, sulphuric acid 70 %, concentrated hydrochloric acid, concentrated phosphoric acid, glacial acetic acid, formic acid 90 %, concentrated ammonium hydroxide, potassium permanganate and acetone, they were not affected. However, concentrated nitric acid destroyed the laminate. Dion (1992) suggested a coating with a mixture comprising an unsatured acrylated urethane, a diluting monomer, and a photo initiator [29]. To improve acid resistance, in particular, it has been proposed to combine melamine chemistry with other amino aldehyde compounds with reduced basicity. This approach could reduce not only the basicity of the ﬁlm, but would also permit the buildup of an amino self-condensed network with better resistance properties. Imidazolidinone derivatives are one of the prime candidates for such modiﬁcation [30]. Nowadays, some solutions of HPL with high chemical resistance are available on the. CHEMARMOR® , by Nevamar, has been tested and proven to have superior chemical resistance and signiﬁcantly higher NEMA wear value than competitive laminates. It provides resistance to acids/bases, solvents, stains, indicators, and general reagents. Pionite ChemGuard incorporates the decorative features of high pressure laminate into a durable chemical resistant surfacing material. In order to test the chemical resistance of laminates, two methods were applied. In method A, volatile chemicals are tested by placing a cotton ball saturated with the reagent in the mouth of a 1-ounce bottle and inverting the bottle on the surface of the laminate. In method B, nonvolatile chemicals are tested by placing ﬁve drops of the reagent onto the surface of the laminate and covering with 24 mm watch glass. For both methods, the reagents are left on the laminate for a period of 24 h. The laminate is then washed with water, cleaned with detergent and naphtha, rinsed with deionized water and dried with a towel. The effect of the different reagents is then evaluated. Formica has a commercial solution called Chemtop2™. In the HPL Chemtop2™, chemicals and reagents were placed in contact with the surface of the Chemtop2 laminate sheet in a covered method (watch glass cover) for a period of 16 h prior to visual examination and evaluation. This evaluation encompassed acids, alkalis, dental supplies, photo lab supplies, solvents, general reagents, hospital and health care, mortician supplies, harsh household products, ANSI/NEMA reagents. Only the dichromate cleaning solution, formic acid 90 %, sulfuric acid 96 %, potassium permanganate 25 %, silver nitrate 10 %, wrights blood stain may cause a slight change in gloss or color, depending upon the duration or exposure, while the nitric acid 70 % cause slight damage, depending upon the duration or exposure. Manufactured with Trespa’s unique Electron Beam Curing (EBC) technology, Trespa® Toplab® PLUS surface is easy to clean and shows a high resistance to a large number of aggressive chemicals.\n\n26 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\n1.3.4 Weathering resistance Exposure to climatic conditions affects various aspects of the coatings properties such as physical and mechanical properties. Sunlight and humidity are the most important weathering factors [31]. To have weathering resistance is essential in laminates used in facades of buildings, outdoor furniture and partitions and bulkheads balconies. Coatings formulated for exterior durability should exclude or minimize resins components that are readily oxidized and that absorb UV radiation at wavelengths longer than 290 nm. To improve the UV resistance of decorative laminates the application of UVresistant top layers of polyacrylates or butyl rubber to aminoplast layers is prescribed. However, these top layers present low scratch resistance. Ratzch [32] showed that it is possible to obtain an UV-resistant decorative laminate if the paper is impregnated with an aminoplastic resin that contains UV stabilizers (HALS alone or combinations of HALS with UV absorbers). Kamoun and coworkers [33] reported that in MF resins water and weather resistance can be enhanced by the addition of hexamine under alkaline conditions. Synthetic transparent iron oxides could be also an excellent choice for UV resistance in decorative laminates. Nowadays, they are readily available in powder form and as predispersed dispersions for solvent- or waterborne applications. Available in a range of natural color shades from yellow through red to brown, transparent iron oxides offer the wood-ﬁnish formulator the combination of the following properties: – excellent transparency; – permanence to light; – durability; – chemical resistance; – UV screening; – economy; – nontoxicity. This type of pigment ﬁnds application on a wide variety of wood-care systems, including those for fencing, decks, lawn furniture, siding, cabinetry, and ﬂooring [34]. There are several commercial solutions presently available. Trespa® Meteon® panels are reported to have good performance outdoors. The panels are described to be practically impervious to acid rain as well. The Formica group offers an innovative solution, the VIVIX® solid phenolic, engineered exterior façade panels, having a decorative surface on both sides. This lightweight rainscreen cladding solution combines excellent weather and UV resistance properties for enhanced durability and ease of maintenance. Prodema and Durian use a PVDF layer on the upper surface that shows UV resistance. This PVDF ﬁlm is also antigraffiti and non-stick, preventing organic matter from developing on the panel’s surface and reducing the buildup of dust and dirt cause by pollution.\n\n1.3 Upgrading HPL characteristics\n\n| 27\n\n1.3.5 Self-healing properties One major problem in polymeric layers is the propensity to damage when exposed to critical conditions or long-term use The surfaces may develop microcracks with negative visual impact, which are impossible to remove in thermosetting materials [35]. One solution would be HPL with self-healing properties. Self-healing materials have the ability to repair microcracks independently of their location, restoring the structure and performance of the material, and, to some degree, minimizing negative visual impact of the damaged surface [35]. This approach allows obtaining more durable materials, with reduced maintenance costs and with a broader range of application in aggressive environments [35]. The concept of selfhealing mimics the healing of biological injured tissue. It may be classiﬁed according to two aspects [35, 36]: – autonomic (without any external intervention) or nonautonomic (with external intervention); – extrinsic (requiring an additional regeneration agent) or intrinsic (without any additional regeneration agent). An autonomic extrinsic self-healing system for incorporation as an additive in the impregnation resin of the HPL decorative paper has been proposed by Antunes [37] (2013). This approach can be described as follows: (i) the healing agent (a drying oil) and an appropriate drying catalyst are encapsulated within the polymeric matrix; (ii) when the laminate surface is damaged, capsules rupture, releasing the healing and drying agents by capillary action; (iii) upon contact with atmospheric oxygen, the healing agent undergoes crosslinking, promoting the repair of the cracked areas [36]. So far, all the large HPL producers do not have any solutions in this area. Only the furniture company Haworth is testing a polyurethane resin in order to confer self-healing properties to its products. Arpa also has a product called FENIX NTM TM, which possesses thermal recovery to microcracking. FENIX NTM™ is an innovative material created for interior design by Arpa Industriale. It is produced by the simultaneous application of heat (approx. 150 °C) and high speciﬁc pressure (> 7 MPa) in order to have a homogeneous nonporous high density product. The core structure of FENIX NTM is composed of paper impregnated with thermosetting resins. Its external surface involves the use of nanotechnology, and its decor is obtained through next generation resins developed by Arpa Industriale’s research.\n\n28 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\n1.3.6 Postformable laminates Especially for the production of kitchen tops, laminates are curved around the edges of a wooden substrate in a postforming line. For this purpose the laminate is exposed to heat for a short period of time provided by hot air or infrared radiation and then bent around the edges [38]. In order to add postformability to a laminate, many solutions have been described in patents. The approaches reported are related to the modiﬁcation of the melamine resin that is used to impregnate the decorative layer with caprolactams [39], glucosides [40], carbamates [41], mannatin [42], epoxies [43], and polyethylenoglycol [44]. Also several patents describe modiﬁcations to the phenolic resins to improve postforming characteristics [45, 46].\n\n1.3.7 Dirt repellence For a liquid to spread on a material it must have a surface energy lower than the surface free energy of that material. To achieve a hydrophobic surface the surface free energy must therefore be lower than 72 mN/m, which is the surface tension of water. To achieve an oleophobic surface, the surface free energy must be even lower since most oils have a surface tension around 20–30 mN/m. In decorative laminates the dirt repellency could be achieved applying a surface treatment to the dried overlay to form a treated overlay, wherein the surface treatment consists of a ﬂuorourethane reaction product of at least one diisocyanate, polyisocyanate, or a mixture of polyisocyanates [47].\n\n1.3.8 Antibacterial action In use, high-pressure laminates are a breeding ground for bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. Therefore, attempts have been made to develop high-pressure laminates exhibiting antimicrobial action [48]. Growth-retarding or microbicidal additives can be incorporated into melamine coatings to produce so-called “active” coatings. The additives can be incorporated onto melamine surfaces in an additional coating step by applying them as a solution or dispersion, or during the production together with the coating resin. Antimicrobial additives fall into two groups: organic and inorganic. The organic compounds described in the literature include phosphonium salts, protoporphyrinebased sulfonium salts, antibiotics, chlorophenyl derivatives, biomimetic polyamides, arylsulfonyl alkenenitrile, aminobenzylsulfonyl acrylamide, quaternary ammonium salts, and 2,4,4′-trichloro-2′-hydroxydiphenolether (triclosan), and 2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-\n\n1.3 Upgrading HPL characteristics\n\n| 29\n\n4-methylsulfonylpyridine, and the inorganic compounds. Inorganic additives are typically heavy metals such as silver, copper, and zinc in different forms (metallic–salt; colloidal–nano-sized), light-activated singlet oxygen sources such as titanium dioxide, or other salts such as barium metaborate. Besides the addition of antimicrobial additives, also nanoparticles have been associated with improved antimicrobial properties, although their mode of action in this regard has not yet been thoroughly investigated. HPL with this property are already seen on the market. A collaboration of Formica® and BioCote® presents Protec+™, a high-performance premium laminate product. Protec+™ introduces an additional layer of hygienic protection through the utilization of the antimicrobial properties of silver. Also Trespa® Virtuon® has inherent antibacterial properties, without the addition of antimicrobial additive, with a surface manufactured using Trespa’s unique in-house technology, electron beam curing (EBC).\n\n1.3.9 Thermal comfort Phase change materials (PCM) are “latent” heat storage materials. The thermal energy transfer occurs when the material changes from solid to liquid, or liquid to solid. Unlike conventional materials, PCM can absorb and release heat at a nearly constant temperature. They store 5–14 times more heat per unit volume than conventional storage materials such as water, masonry, or rock. A large number of phase change materials (organic, inorganic, and eutectic) are available in any required temperature range [49].\n\n1.3.10 Phosphorescence Phosphorescence is a speciﬁc type of photoluminescence related to ﬂuorescence. Photoluminescence is light emission from any form of matter after the absorption of photons. It is one of many forms of luminescence (light emission) and is initiated by photoexcitation (excitation by photons); hence the preﬁx “photo”. The introduction of this feature in HPL has great potential, since it can not only focus on usual applications (furniture and decoration) but also open up new markets (signage, security, entertainment, and homes). It can already be made for its use in vertical and horizontal signage (emergency exit signs and emergency plans) and also in commercial and leisure areas (shops, bars, and clubs) and home environments (child room). The afterglow could be achieved by incorporating the phosphorescent pigment in the melamine resin impregnated overlay paper. The laminate produced with this special overlay should maintain good surface appearance to natural and artiﬁcial light and have the ﬂuorescent effect in the dark.\n\n30 | 1 Introduction of advanced functionalities in laminates for wood-based panels\n\nReferences [1] [2]\n\n[3] [4]\n\n[5]\n\n[6]\n\n[7] [8] [9]\n\n[10] [11] [12] [13]\n\n[14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22]\n\nHigh-pressure decorative laminates (HPL).

In recent decades, driven by increasing environmental requirements, manufacturers made signiﬁcant advancements in development and production of natural ﬁber-based materials. With respect to matrices, because of their poor recyclability, thermosets are nowadays supplanted by thermoplastics polymers. Nonetheless, the development of thermoplastic–natural ﬁber materials is especially constrained by signiﬁcant differences in the surface energies of components. Improvement of interface quality by chemical means is not detailed in this chapter, which is merely devoted to physical routes for ﬁber activation. Of these we focused here on wave and radiation activations, physico-chemical treatments, and thermomechanical technologies. In general, the effects on ﬁbers are detailed: the chemical, physical and mechanical modiﬁcations.\n\n2.1 Introduction What is really a composite material? No universal literal deﬁnition can be found, but only a compromise. Indeed, any strict deﬁnition is at best imprecise and could or could not include systems considered by some to be composite. According to Lee, the following description has been chosen after deliberation [1]: A multiphase material formed from a combination of materials which differ in composition or form, remain bonded together, and retain their identities and properties. Composites maintain an interface between components and act in concert to provide improved speciﬁc or synergistic characteristics not obtainable by any of the original components acting alone.\n\nFrom this description, a composite can be considered to be a combination of two or more materials: reinforcing elements, ﬁllers, and matrix binder. Polymer composites can be described as plastics within which ﬁbers or particles are embedded. The plastic is called the matrix, and the ﬁbers or particles dispersed within it are the reinforcements. The latter is usually stiffer than the matrix, giving a stiffening effect to the overall material. Examples of products manufactured using composite systems include automobile and aircraft parts, bathtubs, vanities, truck hoods, recreational boats, small appliances, and storage tanks. Composite use has continuously grown since its introduction in the 1960s.\n\nDOI 10.1515/9783110416084-002\n\n34 | 2 Activation of natural ﬁbers using physical routes\n\n2.1.1 Reinforcements With respect to ﬁllers, natural ﬁbers as reinforcing elements have attracted much attention, as emphasized by the numerous reviews on the topic. In recent decades, driven by increasing environmental requirements, manufacturers made signiﬁcant advancements in the development and production of natural ﬁber-based composites. The automotive market sector is an example of an area that has an important increase in cellulose ﬁber usage. In this case, biosourced ﬁber materials are commonly used for dashboards, door panels, seat backs, and interior parts. Due to their good mechanical properties, glass and mineral ﬁllers or reinforcements are able to ﬁt the structural and durability demands of automobile exterior and interior parts. Nevertheless, mineral ﬁber-reinforced polymers exhibit several disadvantages. These are known to be abrasive, difficult to condition, and frequently lead to important tool wear. They are obtained from nonrenewable resources and present potential health hazards caused by particles released during machining. Cellulose-based ﬁbers are identiﬁed as good reinforcing ﬁllers. This is one of the two major factors of the very existence of natural ﬁber plastic composites: (i) to produce a less expensive composite, (ii) to obtain a material with better properties overall compared to those of both raw polymer and ﬁbers. As an example, the effect of the nature of ﬁllers on the mechanical properties of polypropylene-based composites is reported in Tab. 2.1. Tab. 2.1: Mechanical properties of ﬁlled polypropylene composites (according to Williams [2]).

For instance, the energy required to manufacture a ﬂax ﬁber material (including activation, harvesting, and ﬁber preparation) is only 9.55 MJ kg−1 versus 54.7 MJ kg−1 for a glass ﬁber compound, i.e. six times lower. Besides, breaking mineral ﬁlled composites results in sharp splinters that can be involved in injuries of workers and/or users. Glass ﬁber-based materials have poor recycling properties and high density: approximately 40 % higher than those made of natural ﬁbers [5]. Moreover, using biosourced reinforcements in composites also presents several advantages: the bio-based resource is widely available, environment friendly, sus-\n\n2.1 Introduction |\n\n35\n\ntainable, not abrasive and low in cost. Natural ﬁbers also have lower densities, high speciﬁc properties, and allow high ﬁlling levels [6, 7]. At this time, researchers as well as automakers are evaluating the environmental impact of a vehicle’s entire life cycle and developing natural ﬁberr composites. However, regarding markets, the automotive industry has no monopoly: the use of bioﬁbers is current in several other sectors, such as leisure, medical, and building, with an increase of 13 % over the last 10 years and an annual use of nearly 275 million kg. But there is also a disadvantage related to the use of natural ﬁbers as a reinforcement of matrices. The presence of hydroxyl and other polar groups involves high moisture adsorption properties. During the processing of hot melt under high pressure, water present in ﬁbers does not boil at normal processing temperatures. As an example, at 800 psi (55 bar) in the extruder, water boils at 270 °C (518 °F). Furthermore, when the blend passes through zones where pressure is lowered, water suddenly and violently boils. Thus, it is recognized that adsorbed water in cellulosic ﬁbers can lead to steam formation during processing. As a result, the porosity of the obtained material is increased and its density lowered. The water also accelerates the oxidation of the hot melt during processing leading to a composite weaker and less durable. In the 1980s attention was paid to reduce moisture from cellulosic ﬁbers: treatment of bioﬁbers with glyoxal [8] or thermal coupled chemical treatment with alcohols [9]. Regarding the ﬁnal material, the higher the ﬁbrous ﬁller content in a composite material is, the higher the water adsorption, unless each cellulose particle is fully encapsulated in the matrix and thus inaccessible to water. Actually, moisture adsorption typically shows a linear increase with the increase in cellulose ratio in the composite.\n\n2.1.2 Polymer matrix The matrix is the other component of a composite. Because of their poor recyclability, thermosets are nowadays supplanted by thermoplastics in natural ﬁber-based composites. The development of thermoplastics–natural ﬁbers materials is constrained by two main physical limits [10]: – the upper temperature at which the ﬁber can be processed, – the signiﬁcant difference in the surface energies of compound. Dealing with the ﬁrst point, plant materials generally contain a third to three quarters cellulose, a third or less of lignin, a third or less of hemicellulosics and minerals, by weight (Tab. 2.2). Typically, natural ﬁbers begin to undergo some dehydratation at temperatures belong the thermoplastic melting point (110 °C). This phenomenon is followed by a decrease of the degree of polymerization of the three main constituents, which is enhanced in the presence of moisture. Lignin and hemicelluloses begin to degrade at about 150 °C and 160 °C, respectively. Because of their limited thermal stability, natural ﬁbers can be formally deteriorated between 130 and 230 °C, depend-\n\n36 | 2 Activation of natural ﬁbers using physical routes\n\nTab. 2.2: Composition of commonly used ﬁbers.

The advantage of these composites was their light color in relation to tannin based ones (Fig. 3.3), and they yielded a good modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) in bending for composites 65 % matrix resin/35 % natural ﬁbers. Composites 50 % matrix resin/50 % natural ﬁbers gave also good results when tested in tension. The best results appear to be obtained using (i) higher curing temperatures (180 °C) with long postcure times and (ii) medium temperature (150 °C) and longer press times (360 s). In conclusion natural ﬁber nonwoven mat composites of good performance can be prepared with a number of biosourced matrix resins, the ones reviewed here being condensed tannin-hexamine, tannin-resorcinol-aldehyde, tannin-furfuryl alcohol, and an epoxidized vegetable oils.\n\nReferences | 85\n\nFig. 3.3: Color difference of a ﬁber nonwoven mat composite bonded with an epoxidezid vegetable oils matrix, lighter colored, and a ﬁber nonwoven mat composite bonded with a tannin-hexamine system.\n\nReferences [1] [2]\n\n[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]\n\n[9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]\n\n[15]\n\nTheis M, Grohe B.

Beall and Henrique Reis\n\n4 Ultrasonic press control and evaluation of wood-based composite panel properties Abstract: Composite press control and the subsequent evaluation of panels produced can be done separately or integrated for closed-loop process control. Ultrasonic press control is based on determining a key minimum point in ultrasonic transmission through one or more boards in the press. The time of press opening can be conservatively determined and/or adjusted to the type of resin or the desired internal bond. After pressing, panels can be evaluated for average elastic or strength properties or variation in properties.\n\n4.1 Introduction This chapter focuses on wood composites that are formed from particles, chips, or ﬂakes, including medium density ﬁberboard, particleboard, and oriented strandboard (OSB). Plywood is not included since its characteristics and processing are quite different from the composite panels. One common characteristic of the formation of composite panels is the density gradient produced in the pressing process (Fig. 4.1).

The denser surface results in a desirable feature of a more uniform and compact surface; however, the strength of the board is largely controlled by the core. The performance of the oriented strandboard with this density proﬁle mimics the performance of a board with sandwich construction, where the outer higher-density layers are located where the maximum bending stresses exist. and the lower density core is located where the maximum shear stresses occur. At the same time, the less dense core contributes to the board bending stiffness by increasing its cross-section bending moment of inertia. In a typical composites mill, a “mat” is assembled on a “former”. and is precompressed before being loaded into the press. Most industrial presses have 20 “openings”, or pairs of heated platens. After curing, the boards are removed with an “unloader”, and then normally move to an air-cooled board cooler before being subsequently processed. After cooling, the boards are typically evaluated by measuring the internal bond (IB; tension perpendicular). In IB tests, specimens of 50 by 50 mm in area are bonded to like-size metal blocks that can be pulled in tension to determine the load at failure. This is done for only a few selected panels on the basis of economical considerations (often once a shift), and this data is assumed to reﬂect the condition of other panels in the same production run. Since the IB is dependent on the time in the press, a change in IB properties can be addressed by a change in press time. Therefore, these processes involve a very crude open-loop control system. With any major changes in the raw material and/or adhesive, the IB values are assessed for modifying the press cycle. The length of the press time is critical from both an economical and technical perspective. For example, an overly short press time can lead to “blows” from residual internal board steam pressure that exceeds the strength of the adhesive bonding. Even without a blow, the panel can still have an unacceptably low IB if the press is opened too early. Extending press time is one of possible means of increasing the degree of curing and therefore the IB; however, this can cause overcuring problems and a lower IB, as well as a decrease in production rate.\n\n4.2 Background 4.2.1 Assessment methods Hot pressing is a very complex process involving mechanical, physical, and chemical changes, with a three-dimensional gradient of temperature, gas pressure, and moisture content changing through the mat with time. Therefore, interactions between the initial mat conditions and the press conditions may signiﬁcantly affect resin curing and bonding behavior. Many techniques, largely off-line, have been used to evaluate the curing process and bonding behavior. Once the board has been produced, its per-\n\n4.2 Background |\n\n89\n\nformance in service is affected by the type and loading of resin, density, and density gradient, and, for OSB, ﬂake orientation.\n\n4.2.1.1 Nonacoustic methods Several techniques have been used to determine the bonding efficiency of wood-based raw materials [2]. None are candidates for on-line process control, but can be used to understand fundamental interactions. Surface analysis techniques have been used to investigate the adherend surface to infer its bonding performance. Because of the relatively modest cost of the equipment, contact angle measurements have been used to estimate the wettability or the surface free energy of wood. Other surface analytical instruments, such as x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy, have been used to measure the chemical composition of the wood surface to estimate the potential bonding ability. However, wood adhesion is not just controlled by chemical properties. Physical properties, such as density and porosity, will also inﬂuence resin performance. Thermal analysis techniques, such as differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, and torsional braid analysis, can measure the changes related to either the chemical reaction or the mechanical properties of the curing resin. Although these techniques can provide useful information on the extent of resin cure, samples for wood adhesion measured by these methods are usually in the form of bulk resin, mixtures of resin and wood powders, resin-impregnated glass cloth, or wood wafers. Because of the lack of the true interaction between resin and wood, optimal conditions for resin curing determined by these methods may not be suitable for optimal bonding processes for hot pressing. Several techniques, such as an optical ﬁber method and dielectric analysis, have been applied to monitor the curing of bulk polymers or wood-based composites during pressing. Since only the resin information is obtained, these techniques are unlikely to be suitable for monitoring hot-pressed wood composites in which determining resin condition is not sufficient to insure a highly integrated structure. Moreover, these techniques require embedded sensors in the test materials, causing problems of intrusion and nonrepeatability. There have been models to predict the endpoint in curing or development of bond strength, but the variations in mat formation and compression, moisture content of the furnish (and contributed by the resin) do not permit adequate press control using such models.\n\n4.2.1.2 Ultrasonic methods Ultrasonic testing (UT) techniques have been used for polymer cure monitoring with a variety of probe arrangements to excite different kinds of waveforms, such as longitudinal, shear, guided waves, and interface waves (another type of guided wave).\n\n90 | 4 Ultrasonic press control and evaluation of wood-based composite panel properties\n\nBecause of the direct connection between the propagating behavior of sound waves and the mechanical properties of the material, information on the extent of resin cure and bonding strength between resin and adherend can be obtained by measuring various ultrasonic parameters. Among all ultrasonic parameters, measurement of velocity is the simplest. Another technique is the acousto-ultrasonics (AU) approach, which combines the advantages of acoustic emission (AE) and conventional UT. Typical uses of AU are with laminated composites and composite-like materials that are highly heterogeneous and anisotropic. Unlike conventional UT that usually measures velocity and attenuation, AU affords more ﬂexibility to assess different properties with diverse parameters. In AU, as in conventional through-transmission ultrasonics, a pulse or burst is injected into a material and the response is captured at a second point. The received signal characteristics are a result of multiple reﬂections, wave interactions, and mode changes [3] and can be processed by extracting different types of signal waveform parameters. These characteristics can be described by parameters that are measures of signal attenuation, velocity, shape, and frequency content. Root mean square (RMS) voltage is often used as a measure of signal energy. The inverse of RMS voltage can be used to approximate signal attenuation. RMS can be calculated from √∑ V i RMS = , n where n is a number of measured data points from signal and V i is the voltage value at point i. Signal velocity is calculated from transit time t, the time from the transmitter to the receiver, based on the assumption of a direct signal path of distance d: V = d/t. In order to detect the ﬁrst arrival, the threshold level for the received signal must be placed just above the noise level. In highly attenuating and dispersive materials, such as wood, the leading edge of the waveform may be difficult to detect, decreasing the apparent velocity. It should also be obvious that the assumption of the direct signal path overestimates the actual velocity in perhaps every case. Signals can also be processed by determining moments from the following expression: M n = ∫ y("
