        "text": "Bimetric MOND gravity\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMilgrom, Mordehai\n\n2009-12-15\n\nA new relativistic formulation of MOND is advanced, involving two metrics as independent degrees of freedom: the MOND metric g{sub {mu}}{sub {nu}}, to which alone matter couples, and an auxiliary metric g-circumflex{sub {mu}}{sub {nu}}. The main idea hinges on the fact that we can form tensors from the difference of the Levi-Civita connections of the two metrics, C{sub {beta}}{sub {gamma}}{sup {alpha}}={gamma}{sub {beta}}{sub {gamma}}{sup {alpha}}-{gamma}-circumflex{sub {beta}}{sub {gamma}}{sup {alpha}}, and these act like gravitational accelerations. In the context of MOND, we can form dimensionless 'acceleration' scalars and functions thereof (containing only first derivatives) from contractions of a{sub 0}{sup -1}C{sub {beta}}{sub {gamma}}{sup {alpha}}.moreÂ Â» I look at a subclass of bimetric MOND theories governed by the action I=-(16{pi}G){sup -1}{integral}[{beta}g{sup 1/2}R+{alpha}g-circumflex{sup 1/2}R-circumflex-2(gg-circumflex){sup 1/4}f({kappa})a{sub 0}{sup 2} M({upsilon}-tilde/a{sub 0}{sup 2})]d{sup 4}x+I{sub M}(g{sub {mu}}{sub {nu}},{psi}{sub i})+I-circumflex{sub M}(g-circumflex{sub {mu}}{sub {nu}},{chi}{sub i}), with {upsilon}-tilde as a scalar quadratic in the C{sub {beta}}{sub {gamma}}{sup {alpha}}, {kappa}=(g/g-circumflex){sup 1/4}, I{sub M} as the matter action, and allow for the existence of twin matter that couples to g-circumflex{sub {mu}}{sub {nu}} alone. Thus, gravity is modified not by modifying the elasticity of the space-time in which matter lives, but by the interaction between that space-time and the auxiliary one. In particular, I concentrate on the interesting and simple choice {upsilon}-tilde{proportional_to}g{sup {mu}}{sup {nu}}(C{sub {mu}}{sub {lambda}}{sup {gamma}}C{sub {nu}}{sub {gamma}}{sup {lambda}}-C{sub {mu}}{sub {nu}}{sup {gamma}}C{sub {lambda}}{sub {gamma}}{sup {lambda}}). This theory introduces only one new constant, a{sub 0}; it tends simply to general relativity (GR) in the limit a{sub 0}{yields}0 and to a\n\nGrowth histories in bimetric massive gravity\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBerg, Marcus; Buchberger, Igor; Enander, Jonas\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWe perform cosmological perturbation theory in Hassan-Rosen bimetric gravity for general homogeneous and isotropic backgrounds. In the de Sitter approximation, we obtain decoupled sets of massless and massive scalar gravitational fluctuations. Matter perturbations then evolve like in Einstein gravity. We perturb the future de Sitter regime by the ratio of matter to dark energy, producing quasi-de Sitter space. In this more general setting the massive and massless fluctuations mix. We argue that in the quasi-de Sitter regime, the growth of structure in bimetric gravity differs from that of Einstein gravity.\n\nADM Analysis of gravity models within the framework of bimetric variational formalism\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGolovnev, Alexey; KarÄiauskas, Mindaugas; Nyrhinen, Hannu J., E-mail: agolovnev@yandex.ru, E-mail: mindaugas.karciauskas@helsinki.fi, E-mail: hannu.nyrhinen@helsinki.fi\n\n2015-05-01\n\nBimetric variational formalism was recently employed to construct novel bimetric gravity models. In these models an affine connection is generated by an additional tensor field which is independent of the physical metric. In this work we demonstrate how the ADM decomposition can be applied to study such models and provide some technical intermediate details. Using ADM decomposition we are able to prove that a linear model is unstable as has previously been indicated by perturbative analysis. Moreover, we show that it is also very difficult if not impossible to construct a non-linear model which is ghost-free within the framework ofmoreÂ Â» bimetric variational formalism. However, we demonstrate that viable models are possible along similar lines of thought. To this end, we consider a set up in which the affine connection is a variation of the Levi-Civita one. As a proof of principle we construct a gravity model with a massless scalar field obtained this way.Â«Â less\n\nPrimordial fluctuations from inflation in dRGT bimetric theory of gravity\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSakakihara, Yuki; Research Center for the Early Universe; Tanaka, Takahiro\n\n2016-09-19\n\nWe investigate primordial gravitational waves and curvature perturbations in de Rham-Gabadadze-Tolley (dRGT) bimetric gravity. We evaluate the power-spectra in the leading order in slow roll. Taking into account the decay of massive graviton, we find that the action up to the second order reduces to the Einstein theory with a non-minimally coupled scalar field, which is simplified to a minimally coupled model by conformal transformation. We also find that the tensor to scalar ratio for large field inflation with power law potential is larger than the general relativity counterpart for any choice of parameters in dRGT bimetric gravity. In addition,moreÂ Â» we confirm that the usual consistency relation holds and we have a steeper spectrum for gravitational waves.Â«Â less\n\nRecent developments in bimetric theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchmidt-May, Angnis; von Strauss, Mikael\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThis review is dedicated to recent progress in the field of classical, interacting, massive spin-2 theories, with a focus on ghost-free bimetric theory. We will outline its history and its development as a nontrivial extension and generalisation of nonlinear massive gravity. We present a detailed discussion of the consistency proofs of both theories, before we review Einstein solutions to the bimetric equations of motion in vacuum as well as the resulting mass spectrum. We introduce couplings to matter and then discuss the general relativity and massive gravity limits of bimetric theory, which correspond to decoupling the massive or the massless spin-2 field from the matter sector, respectively. More general classical solutions are reviewed and the present status of bimetric cosmology is summarised. An interesting corner in the bimetric parameter space which could potentially give rise to a nonlinear theory for partially massless spin-2 fields is also discussed. Relations to higher-curvature theories of gravity are explained and finally we give an overview of possible extensions of the theory and review its formulation in terms of vielbeins.\n\nGeneral virial theorem for modified-gravity MOND\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMilgrom, Mordehai\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAn important and useful relation is known to hold in two specific MOND theories. It pertains to low-acceleration, isolated systems of pointlike masses, mp, at positions rp, subject to gravitational forces Fp. It reads âprpÂ·Fp=-(2/3)(Ga0)1/2 [(âpmp)3/2-âp mp3/2]; a0 is the MOND acceleration constant. Here I show that this relation holds in the nonrelativistic limit of any modified-gravity MOND theory. It follows from only the basic tenets of MOND, which include departure from standard dynamics at accelerations below a0, and space-time scale invariance in the nonrelativistic, low-acceleration limit. This implies space-dilatation invariance of the static, gravitational-field equations, which, in turn, leads to the above point-mass virial relation. Thus, the various MOND predictions and tests based on this relation hold in any modified-gravity MOND theory. Since we do not know that any of the existing MOND theories point in the right direction, it is important to identify such predictions that hold in a much larger class of theories. Among these predictions are the MOND two-body force for arbitrary masses, and a general mass-velocity-dispersion relation of the form Ï2=(2/3)(MGa0)1/2[1-âp(mp/M)3/2], where M = âp mp.\n\nCosmological perturbation and matter power spectrum in bimetric massive gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGeng, Chao-Qiang; Lee, Chung-Chi; Zhang, Kaituo\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe discuss the linear perturbation equations with the synchronous gauge in a minimal scenario of the bimetric massive gravity theory. We find that the matter density perturbation and matter power spectrum are suppressed. We also examine the ghost and stability problems and show that the allowed deviation of this gravitational theory from the cosmological constant is constrained to be smaller than O(10-2) by the large scale structure observational data.\n\nCosmological histories in bimetric gravity: a graphical approach\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMÃ¶rtsell, E.\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe bimetric generalization of general relativity has been proven to be able to give an accelerated background expansion consistent with observations. Apart from the energy densities coupling to one or both of the metrics, the expansion will depend on the cosmological constant contribution to each of them, as well as the three parameters describing the interaction between the two metrics. Even for fixed values of these parameters can several possible solutions, so called branches, exist. Different branches can give similar background expansion histories for the observable metric, but may have different properties regarding, for example, the existence of ghosts and the rate of structure growth. In this paper, we outline a method to find viable solution branches for arbitrary parameter values. We show how possible expansion histories in bimetric gravity can be inferred qualitatively, by picturing the ratio of the scale factors of the two metrics as the spatial coordinate of a particle rolling along a frictionless track. A particularly interesting example discussed is a specific set of parameter values, where a cosmological dark matter background is mimicked without introducing ghost modes into the theory.\n\nGravitational waves in ghost free bimetric gravity\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMohseni, Morteza, E-mail: m-mohseni@pnu.ac.ir\n\n2012-11-01\n\nWe obtain a set of exact gravitational wave solutions for the ghost free bimetric theory of gravity. With a flat reference metric, the theory admits the vacuum Brinkmann plane wave solution for suitable choices of the coefficients of different terms in the interaction potential. An exact gravitational wave solution corresponding to a massive scalar mode is also admitted for arbitrary choice of the coefficients with the reference metric being proportional to the spacetime metric. The proportionality factor and the speed of the wave are calculated in terms of the parameters of the theory. We also show that a F(R) extensionmoreÂ Â» of the theory admits similar solutions but in general is plagued with ghost instabilities.Â«Â less\n\nMOND as a regime of quantum gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSmolin, Lee\n\n2017-10-01\n\nWe propose that there is a regime of quantum gravity phenomena, for the case that the cosmological constant is small and positive, which concerns physics at temperatures below the de Sitter temperature, or length scales larger than the horizon. We observe that the standard form of the equivalence principle does not apply in this regime; we consider instead that a weakened form of the equivalence principle might hold in which the ratio of gravitational to inertial mass is a function of environmental parameters. We consider possible principles to determine that function. These lead to behavior that, in the limit of ââ0 and c ââ , reproduces the modifications of Newtonian dynamics first proposed by Milgrom. Thus modified newtonian dynamics is elucidated as coding the physics of a novel regime of quantum gravity phenomena. We propose also an effective description of this regime in terms of a bimetric theory, valid in the approximation where the metric is static. This predicts a new effect, which modifies gravity for radial motions.\n\nOn the local structure of spacetime in ghost-free bimetric theory and massive gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHassan, S. F.; Kocic, Mikica\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe ghost-free bimetric theory describes interactions of gravity with another spin-2 field in terms of two Lorentzian metrics. However, if the two metrics do not admit compatible notions of space and time, the formulation of the initial value problem becomes problematic. Furthermore, the interaction potential is given in terms of the square root of a matrix which is in general nonunique and possibly nonreal. In this paper we show that both these issues are evaded by requiring reality and general covariance of the equations. First we prove that the reality of the square root matrix leads to a classification of the allowed metrics in terms of the intersections of their null cones. Then, the requirement of general covariance further restricts the allowed metrics to geometries that admit compatible notions of space and time. It also selects a unique definition of the square root matrix. The restrictions are compatible with the equations of motion. These results ensure that the ghost-free bimetric theory can be defined unambiguously and that the two metrics always admit compatible 3+1 decompositions, at least locally. In particular, these considerations rule out certain solutions of massive gravity with locally Closed Causal Curves, which have been used to argue that the theory is acausal.\n\nGravitational radiation and the ultimate speed in Rosen's bimetric theory of gravity\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCaves, C. M.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nIn Rosen's bimetric theory of gravity the (local) speed of gravitational radiation is determined by the combined effects of cosmological boundary values and nearby concentrations of matter. It is possible for the speed of gravitational radiation to be less than the speed of light. It is here shown that the emission of gravitational radiation prevents particles of nonzero rest mass from exceeding the speed of gravitational radiation. Observations of relativistic particles place limits on the speed of gravitational radiation and the cosmological boundary values today, and observations of synchroton radiation from compact radio sources place limits on the cosmological boundary values in the past.\n\nRecovering a MOND-like acceleration law in mimetic gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVagnozzi, Sunny\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWe reconsider the recently proposed mimetic gravity, focusing in particular on whether the theory is able to reproduce the inferred flat rotation curves of galaxies. We extend the theory by adding a non-minimal coupling between matter and mimetic field. Such coupling leads to the appearance of an extra force which renders the motion of test particles non-geodesic. By studying the weak field limit of the resulting equations of motion, we demonstrate that in the Newtonian limit the acceleration law induced by the non-minimal coupling reduces to a modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND)-like one. In this way, it is possible to reproduce the successes of MOND, namely the explanation for the flat galactic rotation curves and the Tully-Fisher relation, within the framework of mimetic gravity, without the need for particle dark matter. The scale-dependence of the recovered acceleration scale opens up the possibility of addressing the missing mass problem not only on galactic but also on cluster scales: we defer a full study of this issue, together with a complete analysis of fits to spiral galaxy rotation curves, to an upcoming companion paper.\n\nExtended Weyl invariance in a bimetric model and partial masslessness\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHassan, S. F.; Schmidt-May, Angnis; von Strauss, Mikael\n\n2016-01-01\n\nWe revisit a particular ghost-free bimetric model which is related to both partial masslessness (PM) and conformal gravity. Linearly, the model propagates six instead of seven degrees of freedom not only around de Sitter but also around flat spacetime. Nonlinearly, the equations of motion can be recast in the form of expansions in powers of curvatures, and exhibit a remarkable amount of structure. In this form, the equations are shown to be invariant under scalar gauge transformations, at least up to six orders in derivatives, the lowest order term being a Weyl scaling of the metrics. The terms at two-derivative order reproduce the usual PM gauge transformations on de Sitter backgrounds. At the four-derivative order, a potential obstruction that could destroy the symmetry is shown to vanish. This in turn guarantees the gauge invariance to at least six-orders in derivatives. This is equivalent to adding up to ten-derivative corrections to conformal gravity. More generally, we outline a procedure for constructing the gauge transformations order by order as an expansion in derivatives and comment on the validity and limitations of the procedure. We also discuss recent arguments against the existence of a PM gauge symmetry in bimetric theory and show that, at least in their present form, they are evaded by the model considered here. Finally, we argue that a bimetric approach to PM theory is more promising than one based on the existence of a fundamental PM field.\n\nA general theory of linear cosmological perturbations: bimetric theories\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLagos, Macarena; Ferreira, Pedro G., E-mail: m.lagos13@imperial.ac.uk, E-mail: p.ferreira1@physics.ox.ac.uk\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWe implement the method developed in [1] to construct the most general parametrised action for linear cosmological perturbations of bimetric theories of gravity. Specifically, we consider perturbations around a homogeneous and isotropic background, and identify the complete form of the action invariant under diffeomorphism transformations, as well as the number of free parameters characterising this cosmological class of theories. We discuss, in detail, the case without derivative interactions, and compare our results with those found in massive bigravity.\n\nVerlinde's emergent gravity versus MOND and the case of dwarf spheroidals\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDiez-Tejedor, Alberto; Gonzalez-Morales, Alma X.; Niz, Gustavo\n\n2018-06-01\n\nIn a recent paper, Erik Verlinde has developed the interesting possibility that space-time and gravity may emerge from the entangled structure of an underlying microscopic theory. In this picture, dark matter arises as a response to the standard model of particle physics from the delocalized degrees of freedom that build up the dark energy component of the Universe. Dark matter physics is then regulated by a characteristic acceleration scale a0, identified with the radius of the (quasi)-de Sitter universe we inhabit. For a point particle matter source, or outside an extended spherically symmetric object, MOND's empirical fitting formula is recovered. However, Verlinde's theory critically departs from MOND when considering the inner structure of galaxies, differing by a factor of 2 at the centre of a regular massive body. For illustration, we use the eight classical dwarf spheroidal satellites of the Milky Way. These objects are perfect testbeds for the model given their approximate spherical symmetry, measured kinematics, and identified missing mass. We show that, without the assumption of a maximal deformation, Verlinde's theory can fit the velocity dispersion profile in dwarf spheroidals with no further need of an extra dark particle component. If a maximal deformation is considered, the theory leads to mass-to-light ratios that are marginally larger than expected from stellar population and formation history studies. We also compare our results with the recent phenomenological interpolating MOND function of McGaugh et al., and find a departure that, for these galaxies, is consistent with the scatter in current observations.\n\nExtending applicability of bimetric theory: chameleon bigravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDe Felice, Antonio; Mukohyama, Shinji; Uzan, Jean-Philippe\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThis article extends bimetric formulations of massive gravity to make the mass of the graviton to depend on its environment. This minimal extension offers a novel way to reconcile massive gravity with local tests of general relativity without invoking the Vainshtein mechanism. On cosmological scales, it is argued that the model is stable and that it circumvents the Higuchi bound, hence relaxing the constraints on the parameter space. Moreover, with this extension the strong coupling scale is also environmentally dependent in such a way that it is kept sufficiently higher than the expansion rate all the way up to the very early universe, while the present graviton mass is low enough to be phenomenologically interesting. In this sense the extended bigravity theory serves as a partial UV completion of the standard bigravity theory. This extension is very generic and robust and a simple specific example is described.\n\nThe Real Problem with MOND\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDodelson, Scott\n\nGravitational potentials in the cosmos are deeper than expected from observed visible objects, a phenomenon usually attributed to dark matter, presumably in the form of a new fundamental particle. Until such a particle is observed, the jury remains out on dark matter, and modified gravity models must be considered. The class of models reducing to modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) in the weak field limit does an excellent job fitting the rotation curves of galaxies, predicting the relation between baryonic mass and velocity in gas-dominated galaxies, and explaining the properties of the local group. Several of the initial challenges facing MOND have been overcome, while others remain. Here we point out the most severe challenge facing MOND.\n\nOn Rosen's theory of gravity and cosmology\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nBarnes, R. C.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nFormal similarities between general relativity and Rosen's bimetric theory of gravity were used to analyze various bimetric cosmologies. The following results were found: (1) physically plausible model universes which have a flat static background metric, have a Robertson-Walker fundamental metric, and which allow co-moving coordinates do not exist in bimetric cosmology. (2) it is difficult to use the Robertson-Walker metric for both the background metric (gamma mu nu) and the fundamental metric tensor of Riemannian geometry( g mu nu) and require that g mu nu and gamma mu nu have different time dependences. (3) A consistency relation for using co-moving coordinates in bimetric cosmology was derived. (4) Certain spatially flat bimetric cosmologies of Babala were tested for the presence of particle horizons. (5) An analytic solution for Rosen's k = +1 model was found. (6) Rosen's singularity free k = +1 model arises from what appears to be an arbitary choice for the time dependent part of gamma mu nu.\n\nGeneralizing MOND to explain the missing mass in galaxy clusters\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHodson, Alistair O.; Zhao, Hongsheng\n\n2017-02-01\n\nContext. MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) is a gravitational framework designed to explain the astronomical observations in the Universe without the inclusion of particle dark matter. MOND, in its current form, cannot explain the missing mass in galaxy clusters without the inclusion of some extra mass, be it in the form of neutrinos or non-luminous baryonic matter. We investigate whether the MOND framework can be generalized to account for the missing mass in galaxy clusters by boosting gravity in high gravitational potential regions. We examine and review Extended MOND (EMOND), which was designed to increase the MOND scale acceleration in high potential regions, thereby boosting the gravity in clusters. Aims: We seek to investigate galaxy cluster mass profiles in the context of MOND with the primary aim at explaining the missing mass problem fully without the need for dark matter. Methods: Using the assumption that the clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium, we can compute the dynamical mass of each cluster and compare the result to the predicted mass of the EMOND formalism. Results: We find that EMOND has some success in fitting some clusters, but overall has issues when trying to explain the mass deficit fully. We also investigate an empirical relation to solve the cluster problem, which is found by analysing the cluster data and is based on the MOND paradigm. We discuss the limitations in the text.\n\nDark matter (energy) may be indistinguishable from modified gravity (MOND)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSivaram, C.\n\nFor Newtonian dynamics to hold over galactic scales, large amounts of dark matter (DM) are required which would dominate cosmic structures. Accounting for the strong observational evidence that the universe is accelerating requires the presence of an unknown dark energy (DE) component constituting about 70% of the matter. Several ingenious ongoing experiments to detect the DM particles have so far led to negative results. Moreover, the comparable proportions of the DM and DE at the present epoch appear unnatural and not predicted by any theory. For these reasons, alternative ideas like MOND and modification of gravity or general relativity over cosmic scales have been proposed. It is shown in this paper that these alternate ideas may not be easily distinguishable from the usual DM or DE hypotheses. Specific examples are given to illustrate this point that the modified theories are special cases of a generalized DM paradigm.\n\nSelf-acceleration in scalar-bimetric theories\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBrax, Philippe; Valageas, Patrick\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe describe scalar-bimetric theories where the dynamics of the Universe are governed by two separate metrics, each with an Einstein-Hilbert term. In this setting, the baryonic and dark matter components of the Universe couple to metrics which are constructed as functions of these two gravitational metrics. More precisely, the two metrics coupled to matter are obtained by a linear combination of their vierbeins, with scalar-dependent coefficients. The scalar field, contrary to dark-energy models, does not have a potential of which the role is to mimic a late-time cosmological constant. The late-time acceleration of the expansion of the Universe can be easily obtained at the background level in these models by appropriately choosing the coupling functions appearing in the decomposition of the vierbeins for the baryonic and dark matter metrics. We explicitly show how the concordance model can be retrieved with negligible scalar kinetic energy. This requires the scalar coupling functions to show variations of order unity during the accelerated expansion era. This leads in turn to deviations of order unity for the effective Newton constants and a fifth force that is of the same order as Newtonian gravity, with peculiar features. The baryonic and dark matter self-gravities are amplified although the gravitational force between baryons and dark matter is reduced and even becomes repulsive at low redshift. This slows down the growth of baryonic density perturbations on cosmological scales, while dark matter perturbations are enhanced. These scalar-bimetric theories have a perturbative cutoff scale of the order of 1 AU, which prevents a precise comparison with Solar System data. On the other hand, we can deduce strong requirements on putative UV completions by analyzing the stringent constraints in the Solar System. Hence, in our local environment, the upper bound on the time evolution of Newton's constant requires an efficient screening mechanism that both damps the fifth\n\nCan the Î CDM model reproduce MOND-like behavior?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDai, De-Chang; Lu, Chunyu\n\n2017-12-01\n\nIt is usually believed that MOND can describe the galactic rotational curves with only baryonic matter and without any dark matter very well, while the Î CDM model is expected to have difficulty in reproducing MOND-like behavior. Here, we use EAGLE's data to learn whether the Î CDM model can reproduce MOND-like behavior. EAGLE's simulation result clearly reproduces the MOND-like behavior for abâª10-12 m/s 2 at z =0 , although the acceleration constant, a0, is a little larger than the observational data indicate. We find that a0 increases with the redshift in a way different from what Milgrom proposed (a0âH ). Therefore, while galaxy rotation curves can be fitted by MOND's empirical function in the Î CDM model, there is no clear connection between a0 and the Hubble constant. We also find that a0 at z âª1 is well separated from a0 at z =0 . Once we have enough galaxies observed at high redshifts, we will be able to rule out the modified gravity model based on MOND-like empirical function with a z -independent a0.\n\nTHINGS about MOND\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGentile, G.; Famaey, B.; de Blok, W. J. G.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWe present an analysis of 12 high-resolution galactic rotation curves from The HI Nearby Galaxy Survey (THINGS) in the context of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). These rotation curves were selected to be the most reliable for mass modelling, and they are the highest quality rotation curves currently available for a sample of galaxies spanning a wide range of luminosities. We fit the rotation curves with the \"simple\" and \"standard\" interpolating functions of MOND, and we find that the \"simple\" function yields better results. We also redetermine the value of a0, and find a median value very close to the one determined in previous studies, a0 = (1.22 Â± 0.33) Ã 10-8 cm s-2. Leaving the distance as a free parameter within the uncertainty of its best independently determined value leads to excellent quality fits for 75% of the sample. Among the three exceptions, two are also known to give relatively poor fits in Newtonian dynamics plus dark matter. The remaining case (NGC 3198) presents some tension between the observations and the MOND fit, which might, however, be explained by the presence of non-circular motions, by a small distance, or by a value of a0 at the lower end of our best-fit interval, 0.9 Ã 10-8 cm s-2. The best-fit stellar M/L ratios are generally in remarkable agreement with the predictions of stellar population synthesis models. We also show that the narrow range of gravitational accelerations found to be generated by dark matter in galaxies is consistent with the narrow range of additional gravity predicted by MOND.\n\nSpacetime symmetries and topology in bimetric relativity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTorsello, Francesco; Kocic, Mikica; HÃ¶gÃ¢s, Marcus; MÃ¶rtsell, Edvard\n\n2018-04-01\n\nWe explore spacetime symmetries and topologies of the two metric sectors in Hassan-Rosen bimetric theory. We show that, in vacuum, the two sectors can either share or have separate spacetime symmetries. If stress-energy tensors are present, a third case can arise, with different spacetime symmetries within the same sector. This raises the question of the best definition of spacetime symmetry in Hassan-Rosen bimetric theory. We emphasize the possibility of imposing ansatzes and looking for solutions having different Killing vector fields or different isometries in the two sectors, which has gained little attention so far. We also point out that the topology of spacetime imposes a constraint on possible metric combinations.\n\nDistant star clusters of the Milky Way in MOND\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHaghi, H.; Baumgardt, H.; Kroupa, P.\n\n2011-03-01\n\nWe determine the mean velocity dispersion of six Galactic outer halo globular clusters, AM 1, Eridanus, Pal 3, Pal 4, Pal 15, and Arp 2 in the weak acceleration regime to test classical vs. modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). Owing to the nonlinearity of MOND's Poisson equation, beyond tidal effects, the internal dynamics of clusters is affected by the external field in which they are immersed. For the studied clusters, particle accelerations are much lower than the critical acceleration a0 of MOND, but the motion of stars is neither dominated by internal accelerations (ai â« ae) nor external accelerations (ae â« ai). We use the N-body code N-MODY in our analysis, which is a particle-mesh-based code with a numerical MOND potential solver developed by Ciotti et al. (2006, ApJ, 640, 741) to derive the line-of-sight velocity dispersion by adding the external field effect. We show that Newtonian dynamics predicts a low-velocity dispersion for each cluster, while in modified Newtonian dynamics the velocity dispersion is much higher. We calculate the minimum number of measured stars necessary to distinguish between Newtonian gravity and MOND with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. We also show that for most clusters it is necessary to measure the velocities of between 30 to 80 stars to distinguish between both cases. Therefore the observational measurement of the line-of-sight velocity dispersion of these clusters will provide a test for MOND.\n\nCan MOND type hypotheses be tested in a free fall laboratory environment?\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDas, Saurya; Patitsas, S. N.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe extremely small accelerations of objects required for the onset of modified Newtonian dynamics, or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), makes testing the hypothesis in conventional terrestrial laboratories virtually impossible. This is due to the large background acceleration of Earth, which is transmitted to the acceleration of test objects within an apparatus. We show, however, that it may be possible to test MOND-type hypotheses with experiments using a conventional apparatus capable of tracking very small accelerations of its components but performed in locally inertial frames such as artificial satellites and other freely falling laboratories. For example, experiments involving an optical interferometer or a torsion balance in these laboratories would show nonlinear dynamics and displacement amplitudes larger than expected. These experiments may also be able to test potential violations of the strong equivalence principle by MOND and to distinguish between its two possible interpretations (modified inertia and modified gravity).\n\nFine tuning and MOND in a metamaterial \"multiverse\".\n\nPubMed\n\nSmolyaninov, Igor I; Smolyaninova, Vera N\n\n2017-08-14\n\nWe consider the recently suggested model of a multiverse based on a ferrofluid. When the ferrofluid is subjected to a modest external magnetic field, the nanoparticles inside the ferrofluid form small hyperbolic metamaterial domains, which from the electromagnetic standpoint behave as individual \"Minkowski universes\" exhibiting different \"laws of physics\", such as different strength of effective gravity, different versions of modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) and different radiation lifetimes. When the ferrofluid \"multiverse\" is populated with atomic or molecular species, and these species are excited using an external laser source, the radiation lifetimes of atoms and molecules in these \"universes\" depend strongly on the individual physical properties of each \"universe\" via the Purcell effect. Some \"universes\" are better fine-tuned than others to sustain the excited states of these species. Thus, the ferrofluid-based metamaterial \"multiverse\" may be used to study models of MOND and to illustrate the fine-tuning mechanism in cosmology.\n\nTensor-vector-scalar-modified gravity: from small scale to cosmology.\n\nPubMed\n\nBekenstein, Jacob D\n\n2011-12-28\n\nThe impressive success of the standard cosmological model has suggested to many that its ingredients are all that one needs to explain galaxies and their systems. I summarize a number of known problems with this programme. They might signal the failure of standard gravity theory on galaxy scales. The requisite hints as to the alternative gravity theory may lie with the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm, which has proved to be an effective summary of galaxy phenomenology. A simple nonlinear modified gravity theory does justice to MOND at the non-relativistic level, but cannot be consistently promoted to relativistic status. The obstacles were first side-stepped with the formulation of tensor-vector-scalar theory (TeVeS), a covariant-modified gravity theory. I review its structure, its MOND and Newtonian limits, and its performance in the face of galaxy phenomenology. I also summarize features of TeVeS cosmology and describe the confrontation with data from strong and weak gravitational lensing.\n\nMass eigenstates in bimetric theory with matter coupling\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSchmidt-May, Angnis, E-mail: angnis.schmidt-may@fysik.su.se\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this paper we study the ghost-free bimetric action extended by a recently proposed coupling to matter through a composite metric. The equations of motion for this theory are derived using a method which avoids varying the square-root matrix that appears in the matter coupling. We make an ansatz for which the metrics are proportional to each other and find that it can solve the equations provided that one parameter in the action is fixed. In this case, the proportional metrics as well as the effective metric that couples to matter solve Einstein's equations of general relativity including a mattermoreÂ Â» source. Around these backgrounds we derive the quadratic action for perturbations and diagonalize it into generalized mass eigenstates. It turns out that matter only interacts with the massless spin-2 mode whose equation of motion has exactly the form of the linearized Einstein equations, while the field with Fierz-Pauli mass term is completely decoupled. Hence, bimetric theory, with one parameter fixed such that proportional solutions exist, is degenerate with general relativity up to linear order around these backgrounds.Â«Â less\n\nEn route to Background Independence: Broken split-symmetry, and how to restore it with bi-metric average actions\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBecker, D., E-mail: BeckerD@thep.physik.uni-mainz.ded; Reuter, M., E-mail: reuter@thep.physik.uni-mainz.de\n\n2014-11-15\n\nby the non-invariant functional RG equation. As an application, we compute the scale dependent spectral dimension which governs the fractal properties of the effective QEG spacetimes at the bi-metric level. Earlier tests of the Asymptotic Safety conjecture almost exclusively employed âsingle-metric truncationsâ which are blind towards the difference between quantum and background fields. We explore in detail under which conditions they can be reliable, and we discuss how the single-metric based picture of Asymptotic Safety needs to be revised in the light of the new results. We shall conclude that the next generation of truncations for quantitatively precise predictions (of critical exponents, for instance) is bound to be of the bi-metric type. - Highlights: â¢ The Asymptotic Safety scenario in quantum gravity is explored. â¢ A bi-metric generalization of the EinsteinâHilbert truncation is investigated. â¢ We find that Background Independence can coexist with Asymptotic Safety. â¢ RG trajectories restoring (background-quantum) split-symmetry are constructed. â¢ The degree of validity of single-metric truncations is critically assessed.Â«Â less\n\nEn route to Background Independence: Broken split-symmetry, and how to restore it with bi-metric average actions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBecker, D.; Reuter, M.\n\n2014-11-01\n\nThe most momentous requirement a quantum theory of gravity must satisfy is Background Independence, necessitating in particular an ab initio derivation of the arena all non-gravitational physics takes place in, namely spacetime. Using the background field technique, this requirement translates into the condition of an unbroken split-symmetry connecting the (quantized) metric fluctuations to the (classical) background metric. If the regularization scheme used violates split-symmetry during the quantization process it is mandatory to restore it in the end at the level of observable physics. In this paper we present a detailed investigation of split-symmetry breaking and restoration within the Effective Average Action (EAA) approach to Quantum Einstein Gravity (QEG) with a special emphasis on the Asymptotic Safety conjecture. In particular we demonstrate for the first time in a non-trivial setting that the two key requirements of Background Independence and Asymptotic Safety can be satisfied simultaneously. Carefully disentangling fluctuation and background fields, we employ a 'bi-metric' ansatz for the EAA and project the flow generated by its functional renormalization group equation on a truncated theory space spanned by two separate Einstein-Hilbert actions for the dynamical and the background metric, respectively. A new powerful method is used to derive the corresponding renormalization group (RG) equations for the Newton- and cosmological constant, both in the dynamical and the background sector. We classify and analyze their solutions in detail, determine their fixed point structure, and identify an attractor mechanism which turns out instrumental in the split-symmetry restoration. We show that there exists a subset of RG trajectories which are both asymptotically safe and split-symmetry restoring: In the ultraviolet they emanate from a non-Gaussian fixed point, and in the infrared they loose all symmetry violating contributions inflicted on them by the non\n\nMOND Calculations of Bulk Dispersions and Radial Dispersion Profiles of Milky Way and Andromeda Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxies\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAlexander, S. G.; Walentosky, M. J.; Messinger, Justin\n\nWe present a new computational method for calculating the motion of stars in a dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) that can use either Newtonian gravity or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). In our model, we explicitly calculate the motion of several thousand stars in a spherically symmetric gravitational potential, and we statistically obtain both the line-of-sight bulk velocity dispersion and dispersion profile. Our results for MOND calculated bulk dispersions for Local Group dSphâs agree well with previous calculations and observations. Our MOND calculated dispersion profiles are compared with the observations of Walker et al. for Milky Way dSphâs, and we present calculatedmoreÂ Â» dispersion profiles for a selection of Andromeda dSphâs.Â«Â less\n\nRoad to MOND: A novel perspective\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMilgrom, Mordehai\n\n2015-08-01\n\nAccepting that galactic mass discrepancies are due to modified dynamics, I show why it is specifically the Modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) paradigm that is pointed to cogently. MOND is thus discussed here as a special case of a larger class of modified dynamics theories whereby galactic systems with large mass discrepancies are described by scale-invariant dynamics. This is a novel presentation that uses more recent, after-the-fact insights and data (largely predicted beforehand by MOND). Starting from a purist set of tenets, I follow the path that leads specifically to the MOND basic tenets. The main signposts are as follows: (i) Space-time scale invariance underlies the dynamics of systems with large mass discrepancies. (ii) In these dynamics, G must be replaced by a single \"scale-invariant\" gravitational constant, Q0 (in MOND, Q0=A0=G a0, where a0 is MOND's acceleration constant). (iii) Universality of free fall points to the constant q0â¡Q0/G as the boundary between the G -controlled, standard dynamics, and the Q0-controlled, scale-invariant dynamics (in MOND, q0=a0). (iv) Data clinch the case for q0 being an acceleration (MOND).\n\nStrong Constraints on Cosmological Gravity from GW170817 and GRB 170817A\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBaker, T.; Bellini, E.; Ferreira, P.

We show that this measurement allows us to place stringent constraints on general scalar-tensor and vector-tensor theories, while allowing us to place an independent bound on the graviton mass in bimetric theories of gravity. These constraints severely reduce the viable range of cosmological models that have been proposed as alternatives to general relativistic cosmology.\n\nInvarianza de las ecuaciones de movimiento bajo transformaciones de escala espacio-temporales en la dinamica de Newton modificada (MOND)\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAcosta, R.; Tuiran, E.; Molina Redondo, U.\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe basic principles that originated the Modified Newtonian Dynamics MOND, are shown, as well as a description of the fundamentals aspects of the theory: modification of gravity and modification of inertia. Also, it is considered the behaviour of the movement equations under space-temporal scale transformations of the movement equations, that is, transformations that have the form (t, r) --> (lambda*t, r). It was observed in this way that the MOND regime comes from the requirement of the invariance of the movement equations with respect to this transformations.\n\nThe Bimetric cementless total hip replacement: 7-18 year follow-up assessing the influence of acetabular design on survivorship.\n\nPubMed\n\nRussell, R C; Ghassemi, A; Dorrell, J H; Powles, D P\n\n2009-08-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the mid- to long-term survivorship of Bimetric cementless total hip replacement and assess how it is affected by the acetabular design. This was a retrospective analysis of 127 Bimetric cementless total hip replacements in 110 patients with a follow-up of 7-18 years. A single design stem and three different cementless metal-backed acetabular designs were used. Patients were assessed clinically using the Harris hip score and radiologically by independent review of current hip radiographs. There was only one case of aseptic loosening of the femoral stem. The earliest acetabular design showed a high failure rate whilst the latter two designs showed a 96% survivorship at a mean of 9.5 years. We conclude that a combination of the bimetric stem with either of the latter acetabular cup designs has a good mid- to long-term performance.\n\nThe dark-baryonic matter mass relation for observational verification in Verlinde's emergent gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShen, Jian Qi\n\n2018-06-01\n\nRecently, a new interesting idea of origin of gravity has been developed by Verlinde. In this scheme of emergent gravity, where horizon entropy, microscopic de Sitter states and relevant contribution to gravity are involved, an entropy displacement resulting from matter behaves as a memory effect and can be exhibited at sub-Hubble scales, namely, the entropy displacement and its \"elastic\" response would lead to emergent gravity, which gives rise to an extra gravitational force. Then galactic dark matter effects may origin from such extra emergent gravity. We discuss some concepts in Verlinde's theory of emergent gravity and point out some possible problems or issues, e.g., the gravitational potential caused by Verlinde's emergent apparent dark matter may no longer be continuous in spatial distribution at ordinary matter boundary (such as a massive sphere surface). In order to avoid the unnatural discontinuity of the extra emergent gravity of Verlinde's apparent dark matter, we suggest a modified dark-baryonic mass relation (a formula relating Verlinde's apparent dark matter mass to ordinary baryonic matter mass) within this framework of emergent gravity. The modified mass relation is consistent with Verlinde's result at relatively small scales (e.g., R<3h_{70}^{-1} Mpc). However, it seems that, compared with Verlinde's relation, at large scales (e.g., gravitating systems with R>3h_{70}^{-1} Mpc), the modified dark-baryonic mass relation presented here might be in better agreement with the experimental curves of weak lensing analysis in the recent work of Brouwer et al. Galactic rotation curves are compared between Verlinde's emergent gravity and McGaugh's recent model of MOND (Modified Newtonian Dynamics established based on recent galaxy observations). It can be found that Verlinde rotational curves deviate far from those of McGaugh MOND model when the MOND effect (or emergent dark matter) dominates. Some applications of the modified dark-baryonic mass relation\n\n(2 + 1)-dimensional interacting model of two massless spin-2 fields as a bi-gravity model\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoseinzadeh, S.; Rezaei-Aghdam, A.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nWe propose a new group-theoretical (Chern-Simons) formulation for the bi-metric theory of gravity in (2 + 1)-dimensional spacetime which describe two interacting massless spin-2 fields. Our model has been formulated in terms of two dreibeins rather than two metrics. We obtain our Chern-Simons gravity model by gauging mixed AdS-AdS Lie algebra and show that it has a two dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) at the boundary of the anti de Sitter (AdS) solution. We show that the central charge of the dual CFT is proportional to the mass of the AdS solution. We also study cosmological implications of our massless bi-gravity model.\n\nThe Bimetric cementless total hip replacement: 7â18Â year follow-up assessing the influence of acetabular design on survivorship\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGhassemi, A.; Dorrell, J.

This is a problematic entity from the viewpoint of existence and uniqueness properties. We accurately describe the freedom of choosing a square root of a (non-degenerate) matrix. It has discrete and (in special cases) continuous parts. When continuous freedom is present, the usual perturbation theory in terms of matrices can be critically ill defined for some choices of the square root. We consider the new formulation of massive and bimetric gravity which deals directly with eigenvalues (in disguise of elementary symmetric polynomials) instead of matrices. It allows for a meaningful discussion of perturbation theory in such cases, even though certain non-analytic features arise.\n\nNewtonian Gravity Reformulated\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDehnen, H.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWith reference to MOND we propose a reformulation of Newton's theory of gravity in the sense of the static electrodynamics introducing a \"material\" quantity in analogy to the dielectric \"constant\". We propose that this quantity is induced by vacuum polarizations generated by the gravitational field itself. Herewith the flat rotation curves of the spiral galaxies can be explained as well as the observed high velocities near the center of the galaxy should be reconsidered.\n\nA Primer to Relativistic MOND Theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBekenstein, J. D.; Sanders, R. H.\n\nWe first review the nonrelativistic Lagrangian theory as a framework for the MOND equation. Obstructions to a relativistic version of it are discussed leading up to TeVeS, a relativistic tensor-vector-scalar field theory which displays both MOND and Newtonian limits. The whys for its particular structure are discussed and its achievements so far are summarized.\n\nStructure formation in nonlocal MOND\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTan, L.; Woodard, R. P.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe consider structure formation in a nonlocal, metric-based realization of Milgrom's MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). We derive the general equations for linearized scalar perturbations about the ÎCDM expansion history. These equations are considerably simplified for sub-horizon modes, and it becomes obvious (in this model) that the MOND enhancement is not sufficient to allow ordinary matter to drive structure formation. We discuss ways in which the model might be changed to correct the problem.\n\nTesting Modified Gravity Theories via Wide Binaries and GAIA\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPittordis, Charalambos; Sutherland, Will\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe standard ÎCDM model based on General Relativity (GR) including cold dark matter (CDM) is very successful at fitting cosmological observations, but recent non-detections of candidate dark matter (DM) particles mean that various modified-gravity theories remain of significant interest. The latter generally involve modifications to GR below a critical acceleration scale Ë10-10 m s-2. Wide-binary (WB) star systems with separations â³ 5 kAU provide an interesting test for modified gravity, due to being in or near the low-acceleration regime and presumably containing negligible DM. Here, we explore the prospects for new observations pending from the GAIA spacecraft to provide tests of GR against MOND or TeVes-like theories in a regime only partially explored to date. In particular, we find that a histogram of (3D) binary relative velocities, relative to equilibrium circular velocity predicted from the (2D) projected separation predicts a rather sharp feature in this distribution for standard gravity, with an 80th (90th) percentile value close to 1.025 (1.14) with rather weak dependence on the eccentricity distribution. However, MOND/TeVeS theories produce a shifted distribution, with a significant increase in these upper percentiles. In MOND-like theories without an external field effect, there are large shifts of order unity. With the external field effect included, the shifts are considerably reduced to Ë0.04 - 0.08, but are still potentially detectable statistically given reasonably large samples and good control of contaminants. In principle, followup of GAIA-selected wide binaries with ground-based radial velocities accurate to â² 0.03 { km s^{-1}} should be able to produce an interesting new constraint on modified-gravity theories.\n\nUltra-diffuse cluster galaxies as key to the MOND cluster conundrum\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMilgrom, Mordehai\n\n2015-12-01\n\nModified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) reduces greatly the mass discrepancy in clusters of galaxies,but does leave a global discrepancy of about a factor of 2 (epitomized by the structure of the Bullet Cluster). It has been proposed, within the minimalist and purist MOND, that clusters harbour some indigenous, yet undetected, cluster baryonic (dark) matter (CBDM), whose total amount is comparable with that of the observed hot gas. Koda et al. have recently identified more than a thousand ultra-diffuse, galaxy-like objects (UDGs) in the Coma cluster. These, they argue, require, within Newtonian dynamics, that they are much more massive than their observed stellar component. Here, I propound that some of the CBDM is internal to UDGs, which endows them with robustness. The rest of the CBDM objects formed in now-disrupted kin of the UDGs, and is dispersed in the intracluster medium. The discovery of cluster UDGs is not in itself a resolution of the MOND cluster conundrum, but it lends greater plausibility to CBDM as its resolution. Alternatively, if the UDGs are only now falling into Coma, their large size and very low surface brightness could result from the inflation due to the MOND, variable external-field effect (EFE). I also consider briefly solutions to the conundrum that invoke more elaborate extensions of purist MOND, e.g. that in clusters, the MOND constant takes up larger than canonical values of the MOND constant. Whatever solves the cluster conundrum within MOND might also naturally account for UDGs.\n\nNew Views on Dark Matter from Emergent Gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSun, Sichun; Zhang, Yun-Long\n\n2018-01-01\n\nWe discuss a scenario that apparent dark matter comes from the induced gravity in the (3+1)- dimensional spacetime, which can be embedded into one higher dimensional flat spacetime. The stress tensor of dark energy and dark matter is identified with the Brown-York stress tensor on the hypersurface, and we find an interesting constraint relation between the dark matter and dark energy density parameter and baryonic density parameter. Our approach may show a new understanding for Verlinde's emergent gravity from higher dimensions. We also comment on some phenomenological implications, including gravitational wave solutions and MOND limit.\n\nMilky Way Mass Models and MOND\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMcGaugh, Stacy S.\n\n2008-08-01\n\nUsing the Tuorla-Heidelberg model for the mass distribution of the Milky Way, I determine the rotation curve predicted by MOND (modified Newtonian dynamics). The result is in good agreement with the observed terminal velocities interior to the solar radius and with estimates of the Galaxy's rotation curve exterior thereto. There are no fit parameters: given the mass distribution, MOND provides a good match to the rotation curve. The Tuorla-Heidelberg model does allow for a variety of exponential scale lengths; MOND prefers short scale lengths in the range 2.0 kpc lesssim Rdlesssim 2.5 kpc. The favored value of Rd depends somewhat on the choice of interpolation function. There is some preference for the \"simple\" interpolation function as found by Famaey & Binney. I introduce an interpolation function that shares the advantages of the simple function on galaxy scales while having a much smaller impact in the solar system. I also solve the inverse problem, inferring the surface mass density distribution of the Milky Way from the terminal velocities. The result is a Galaxy with \"bumps and wiggles\" in both its luminosity profile and rotation curve that are reminiscent of those frequently observed in external galaxies.\n\nANDROMEDA DWARFS IN LIGHT OF MOND. II. TESTING PRIOR PREDICTIONS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMcGaugh, Stacy; Milgrom, Mordehai\n\nWe employ recently published measurements of the velocity dispersions in the newly discovered dwarf satellite galaxies of Andromeda to test our previously published predictions of this quantity. The data are in good agreement with our specific predictions for each dwarf made a priori with modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND), with reasonable stellar mass-to-light ratios, and no dark matter, while Newtonian dynamics point to quite large mass discrepancies in these systems. MOND distinguishes between regimes where the internal field of the dwarf, or the external field of the host, dominates. The data appear to recognize this distinction, which is a unique featuremoreÂ Â» of MOND not explicable in ÎCDM.Â«Â less\n\nCosmology in bimetric theory with an effective composite coupling to matter\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGÃ¼mrÃ¼kÃ§Ã¼oÄlu, A. Emir; Heisenberg, Lavinia; Mukohyama, Shinji\n\nWe study the cosmology of bimetric theory with a composite matter coupling. We find two possible branches of background evolution. We investigate the question of stability of cosmological perturbations. For the tensor and vector perturbations, we derive conditions on the absence of ghost and gradient instabilities. For the scalar modes, we obtain conditions for avoiding ghost degrees. In the first branch, we find that one of the scalar modes becomes a ghost at the late stages of the evolution. Conversely, this problem can be avoided in the second branch. However, we also find that the constraint for the second branchmoreÂ Â» prevents the doubly coupled matter fields from being the standard ingredients of cosmology. We thus conclude that a realistic and stable cosmological model requires additional minimally coupled matter fields.Â«Â less\n\nDark matter and MOND dynamical models of the massive spiral galaxy NGC 2841\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSamuroviÄ, S.; VudragoviÄ, A.; JovanoviÄ, M.\n\n2015-08-01\n\nWe study dynamical models of the massive spiral galaxy NGC 2841 using both the Newtonian models with Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) and isothermal dark haloes, as well as various MOND (MOdified Newtonian Dynamics) models. We use the observations coming from several publicly available data bases: we use radio data, near-infrared photometry as well as spectroscopic observations. In our models, we find that both tested Newtonian dark matter approaches can successfully fit the observed rotational curve of NGC 2841. The three tested MOND models (standard, simple and, for the first time applied to another spiral galaxy than the Milky Way, Bekenstein's toy model) provide fits of the observed rotational curve with various degrees of success: the best result was obtained with the standard MOND model. For both approaches, Newtonian and MOND, the values of the mass-to-light ratios of the bulge are consistent with the predictions from the stellar population synthesis (SPS) based on the Salpeter initial mass function (IMF). Also, for Newtonian and simple and standard MOND models, the estimated stellar mass-to-light ratios of the disc agree with the predictions from the SPS models based on the Kroupa IMF, whereas the toy MOND model provides too low a value of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, incompatible with the predictions of the tested SPS models. In all our MOND models, we vary the distance to NGC 2841, and our best-fitting standard and toy models use the values higher than the Cepheid-based distance to the galaxy NGC 2841, and the best-fitting simple MOND model is based on the lower value of the distance. The best-fitting NFW model is inconsistent with the predictions of the Î cold dark matter cosmology, because the inferred concentration index is too high for the established virial mass.\n\nCosmological variation of the MOND constant: Secular effects on galactic systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMilgrom, Mordehai\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThe proximity of the MOND acceleration constant with cosmological accelerationsâfor example, a0âc H0/2 Ï âpoints to its possibly decreasing with cosmic time. I begin to consider the secular changes induced in galactic systems by such presumed variations, which are assumed to be adiabatic. It is important to understand these effects, in isolation from other evolutionary influences, in order to identify or constrain a0 variations by detection of induced effects, or lack thereof. I find that as long as the system is fully in the deep-MOND regimeâas applies to many galactic systemsâthe adiabatic response of the system obeys simple scaling laws. For example, in a system that would be stationary for fixed a0, the system expands homologously as a0-1 /4, while internal velocities decrease uniformly as a01 /4. If a0âc H at all relevant times, this change amounts to a factor of Ë2.5 since redshift 10. For rotating systems, the angular frequency Î© âa01 /2. The accelerations increase relative to a0 as a0-1 /4, pushing the system towards the Newtonian regime. All this follows from the appearance of a0 in MOND and the scale invariance of the deep-MOND limitâtwo basic tenets of MOND. More complicated evolution ensues when parts of the system become Newtonian, or are so from inception. For example, these parts may become unstable since they are not protected by MOND's stabilizing effects. The existence of such regions also modifies the MONDian regime since they affect the potential everywhere, and constituents might migrate between the Newtonian and MONDian regimes. Studying these last effects would require detailed numerical calculations.\n\nTesting Verlinde's emergent gravity in early-type galaxies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTortora, C.; Koopmans, L. V. E.; Napolitano, N. R.; Valentijn, E. A.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nEmergent Gravity (EG) has been proposed to resolve the missing mass problem in galaxies, replacing the potential of dark matter (DM) by the effect of the entropy displacement of dark energy by baryonic matter. This apparent DM depends only on the baryonic mass distribution and the present-day value of the Hubble parameter. In this paper we test the EG proposition, formalized by Verlinde for a spherical and isolated mass distribution using the central dynamics (Sloan Digital Sky Survey velocity dispersion, Ï) and the K-band light distribution in a sample of 4032 massive (M_{\\\\star }â³ 10^{10} M_{â}) and local early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the SPIDER datasample. Our results remain unaltered if we consider the sample of 750 roundest field galaxies. Using these observations we derive the predictions by EG for the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and the initial mass function (IMF). We demonstrate that, consistently with a classical Newtonian framework with a DM halo component or alternative theories of gravity as MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), the central dynamics can be fitted if the IMF is assumed non-universal and systematically changing with Ï. For the case of EG, we find lower, but still acceptable, stellar M/L if compared with the DM-based Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW) model and with MOND, but pretty similar to adiabatically contracted DM haloes and with expectations from spectral gravity-sensitive features. If the strain caused by the entropy displacement would be not maximal, as adopted in the current formulation, then the dynamics of ETGs could be reproduced with larger M/L.\n\nTesting the MOND paradigm of modified dynamics with galaxy-galaxy gravitational lensing.\n\nPubMed\n\nMilgrom, Mordehai\n\n2013-07-26\n\nThe MOND paradigm of modified dynamics predicts that the asymptotic gravitational potential of an isolated, bounded (baryonic) mass, M, is Ï(r)=(MGa0)1/2ln(r). Relativistic MOND theories predict that the lensing effects of M are dictated by Ï(r) as general-relativity lensing is dictated by the Newtonian potential. Thus MOND predicts that the asymptotic Newtonian potential deduced from galaxy-galaxy gravitational lensing will have (1) a logarithmic r dependence, and (2) a normalization (parametrized standardly as 2Ï2) that depends only on M: Ï=(MGa0/4)1/4. I compare these predictions with recent results of galaxy-galaxy lensing, and find agreement on all counts. For the âblueâ-lenses subsample (âspiralâ galaxies) MOND reproduces the observations well with an râ²-band M/Lrâ²â¼(1â3)(M/L)â, and for âredâ lenses (âellipticalâ galaxies) with M/Lrâ²â¼(3â6)(M/L)â, both consistent with baryons only. In contradistinction, Newtonian analysis requires, typically, M/Lrâ²â¼130(M/L)â, bespeaking a mass discrepancy of a factor â¼40. Compared with the staple, rotation-curve tests, MOND is here tested in a wider population of galaxies, through a different phenomenon, using relativistic test objects, and is probed to several-times-lower accelerationsâas low as a few percent of a0.\n\nFractional quantum Hall systems near nematicity: Bimetric theory, composite fermions, and Dirac brackets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNguyen, Dung Xuan; Gromov, Andrey; Son, Dam Thanh\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe perform a detailed comparison of the Dirac composite fermion and the recently proposed bimetric theory for a quantum Hall Jain states near half filling. By tuning the composite Fermi liquid to the vicinity of a nematic phase transition, we find that the two theories are equivalent to each other. We verify that the single mode approximation for the response functions and the static structure factor becomes reliable near the phase transition. We show that the dispersion relation of the nematic mode near the phase transition can be obtained from the Dirac brackets between the components of the nematic order parameter. The dispersion is quadratic at low momenta and has a magnetoroton minimum at a finite momentum, which is not related to any nearby inhomogeneous phase.\n\nLinear spin-2 fields in most general backgrounds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBernard, Laura; Deffayet, CÃ©dric; Schmidt-May, Angnis; von Strauss, Mikael\n\n2016-04-01\n\nWe derive the full perturbative equations of motion for the most general background solutions in ghost-free bimetric theory in its metric formulation. Clever field redefinitions at the level of fluctuations enable us to circumvent the problem of varying a square-root matrix appearing in the theory. This greatly simplifies the expressions for the linear variation of the bimetric interaction terms. We show that these field redefinitions exist and are uniquely invertible if and only if the variation of the square-root matrix itself has a unique solution, which is a requirement for the linearized theory to be well defined. As an application of our results we examine the constraint structure of ghost-free bimetric theory at the level of linear equations of motion for the first time. We identify a scalar combination of equations which is responsible for the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost mode in the theory. The bimetric scalar constraint is in general not manifestly covariant in its nature. However, in the massive gravity limit the constraint assumes a covariant form when one of the interaction parameters is set to zero. For that case our analysis provides an alternative and almost trivial proof of the absence of the Boulware-Deser ghost. Our findings generalize previous results in the metric formulation of massive gravity and also agree with studies of its vielbein version.\n\nCirque du Monde as a health intervention\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFournier, Cynthia; Drouin, MÃ©lodie-Anne; Marcoux, JÃ©rÃ©mie; Garel, Patricia; Bochud, Emmanuel; ThÃ©berge, Julie; Aubertin, Patrice; Favreau, Gil; Fleet, Richard\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAbstract Objective To present Cirque du Soleilâs social circus program, Cirque du Monde, to explore its potential as a primary health care tool for family physicians. Data sources A review of the literature in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, LaPresse, Eureka, Google Scholar, and Ãrudit using the key words circus, social circus, Cirque du Monde, and Cirque du Soleil; a Montreal-based initiative, Espace Transition, modeled on Cirque du Monde; and personal communication with Cirque du Soleilâs Social Circus Training Advisor. Study selection The first 50 articles or websites identified for each key word in each of the databases were examined on the basis of their titles and abstracts in the case of articles, and on the basis of their titles and page content in the case of websites. Articles and websites that explored an aspect of social circuses or that described an intervention that involved circuses were then retained for analysis. Because all literature on social circuses was searched, no criterion for year of publication was used. Synthesis No articles on the social circus as a health intervention were found. One study on the use of the circus as an intervention in schools was identified. It demonstrated an increase in self-esteem in the children who took part. One study on the use of the circus in a First Nations community was found; it contained nonspecific, qualitative findings. The other articles identified were merely descriptions of social circuses. One website was identified on the use of the social circus to help youth who had been treated in a hospital setting for major psychiatric disorders to re-enter the community. The team in the pediatric psychiatry department at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Sainte-Justine, the childrenâs hospital in Montreal, Que, was contacted; they were leading this project, called Espace Transition. The unpublished preliminary findings of its pilot project demonstrate substantial improvements in overall patient\n\nN-body simulations in modified Newtonian dynamics\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nNipoti, C.; Londrillo, P.; Ciotti, L.\n\nWe describe some results obtained with N-MODY, a code for N-body simulations of collisionless stellar systems in modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). We found that a few fundamental dynamical processes are profoundly different in MOND and in Newtonian gravity with dark matter. In particular, violent relaxation, phase mixing and galaxy merging take significantly longer in MOND than in Newtonian gravity, while dynamical friction is more effective in a MOND system than in an equivalent Newtonian system with dark matter.\n\nEmergence of a dark force in corpuscular gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCadoni, M.; Casadio, R.; Giusti, A.; Tuveri, M.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe investigate the emergent laws of gravity when dark energy and the de Sitter space-time are modeled as a critical Bose-Einstein condensate of a large number of soft gravitons NG. We argue that this scenario requires the presence of various regimes of gravity in which NG scales in different ways. Moreover, the local gravitational interaction affecting baryonic matter can be naturally described in terms of gravitons pulled out from this dark energy condensate (DEC). We then explain the additional component of the acceleration at galactic scales, commonly attributed to dark matter, as the reaction of the DEC to the presence of baryonic matter. This additional dark force is also associated to gravitons pulled out from the DEC and correctly reproduces the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) acceleration. It also allows for an effective description in terms of general relativity sourced by an anisotropic fluid. We finally calculate the mass ratio between the contribution of the apparent dark matter and the baryonic matter in a region of size r at galactic scales and show that it is consistent with the Î CDM predictions.\n\nNonstandard gravitational waves imply gravitational slip: On the difficulty of partially hiding new gravitational degrees of freedom\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSawicki, Ignacy; Saltas, Ippocratis D.; Motta, Mariele; Amendola, Luca; Kunz, Martin\n\n2017-04-01\n\nIn many generalized models of gravity, perfect fluids in cosmology give rise to gravitational slip. Simultaneously, in very broad classes of such models, the propagation of gravitational waves is altered. We investigate the extent to which there is a one-to-one relationship between these two properties in three classes of models with one extra degree of freedom: scalar (Horndeski and beyond), vector (Einstein-aether), and tensor (bimetric). We prove that in bimetric gravity and Einstein-aether, it is impossible to dynamically hide the gravitational slip on all scales whenever the propagation of gravitational waves is modified. Horndeski models are much more flexible, but it is nonetheless only possible to hide gravitational slip dynamically when the action for perturbations is tuned to evolve in time toward a divergent kinetic term. These results provide an explicit, theoretical argument for the interpretation of future observations if they disfavored the presence of gravitational slip.\n\nAn ecological approach to problems of Dark Energy, Dark Matter, MOND and Neutrinos\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, Hong Sheng\n\n2008-11-01\n\nModern astronomical data on galaxy and cosmological scales have revealed powerfully the existence of certain dark sectors of fundamental physics, i.e., existence of particles and fields outside the standard models and inaccessible by current experiments. Various approaches are taken to modify/extend the standard models. Generic theories introduce multiple de-coupled fields A, B, C, each responsible for the effects of DM (cold supersymmetric particles), DE (Dark Energy) effect, and MG (Modified Gravity) effect respectively. Some theories use adopt vanilla combinations like AB, BC, or CA, and assume A, B, C belong to decoupled sectors of physics. MOND-like MG and Cold DM are often taken as antagnising frameworks, e.g. in the muddled debate around the Bullet Cluster. Here we argue that these ad hoc divisions of sectors miss important clues from the data. The data actually suggest that the physics of all dark sectors is likely linked together by a self-interacting oscillating field, which governs a chameleon-like dark fluid, appearing as DM, DE and MG in different settings. It is timely to consider an interdisciplinary approach across all semantic boundaries of dark sectors, treating the dark stress as one identity, hence accounts for several \"coincidences\" naturally.\n\nThe Globular Cluster NGC 2419: A Crucible for Theories of Gravity\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nIbata, R.; Sollima, A.; Nipoti, C.; Bellazzini, M.; Chapman, S. C.; Dalessandro, E.\n\n2011-09-01\n\nWe present the analysis of a kinematic data set of stars in the globular cluster NGC 2419, taken with the DEep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph at the Keck II telescope. Combined with a reanalysis of deep Hubble Space Telescope and Subaru Telescope imaging data, which provide an accurate luminosity profile of the cluster, we investigate the validity of a large set of dynamical models of the system, which are checked for stability via N-body simulations. We find that isotropic models in either Newtonian or Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) are ruled out with extremely high confidence. However, a simple Michie model in Newtonian gravity with anisotropic velocity dispersion provides an excellent representation of the luminosity profile and kinematics of the cluster. The anisotropy profiles of these models ensure an isotropic center to the cluster, which progresses to extreme radial anisotropy toward the outskirts. In contrast, with MOND we find that Michie models that reproduce the luminosity profile either overpredict the velocity dispersion on the outskirts of the cluster if the mass-to-light ratio (M/L) is kept at astrophysically motivated values or else they underpredict the central velocity dispersion if the M/L is taken to be very small. We find that the best Michie model in MOND is a factor of ~104 less likely than the Newtonian model that best fits the system. A likelihood ratio of 350 is found when we investigate more general models by solving the Jeans equation with a Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme. We verified with N-body simulations that these results are not significantly different when the MOND external field effect is accounted for. If the assumptions that the cluster is in dynamical equilibrium, spherical, not on a peculiar orbit, and possesses a single dynamical tracer population of constant M/L are correct, we conclude that the present observations provide a very severe challenge for MOND. Some of the data presented herein were obtained at the W\n\nThe MOND External Field Effect on the Dynamics of the Globular Clusters: General Considerations and Application to NGC 2419\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDerakhshani, Kamran\n\n2014-03-01\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the external field effect in the context of the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of globular clusters (GCs). Using N-MODY, which is an N-body simulation code with a MOND potential solver, we show that the general effect of the external field for diffuse clusters, which obey MOND in most of their parts, is that it pushes the dynamics toward the Newtonian regime. On the other hand, for more compact clusters, which are essentially Newtonian in their inner parts, the external field is effective mainly in the outer parts of compact clusters. As a case study, we then choose the remote Galactic GC NGC 2419. By varying the cluster mass, half-light radius, and mass-to-light ratio, we aim to find a model that will reproduce the observational data most effectively, using N-MODY. We find that even if we take the Galactic external field into account, a Newtonian Plummer sphere represents the observational data better than MOND to an order of magnitude in terms of the total Ï2 of surface brightness and velocity dispersion.\n\nThe mond external field effect on the dynamics of the globular clusters: general considerations and application to NGC 2419\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDerakhshani, Kamran, E-mail: kderakhshani@iasbs.ac.ir\n\n2014-03-01\n\nIn this paper, we investigate the external field effect in the context of the MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) on the surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of globular clusters (GCs).

P.; D'Agostini, G.\n\n2014-10-01\n\nAn extension of a previously published model of a bimetric Universe is presented, where the speeds of light associated to positive and negative mass species are different. As shown earlier, the asymmetry of the model explains the acceleration of the positive species, while the negative one slows down. Asymmetry affects scale factors linked to lengths, times and speeds of light; so that if a mass inversion of a craft can be achieved, then interstellar travels would become non-impossible at a velocity less than the speed of light of the negative sector, and possibly much higher than that of the positive sector.\n\nAlternative Gravity Rotation Curves for the LITTLE THINGS Survey\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOâBrien, James G.; Chiarelli, Thomas L.; Dentico, Jeremy; Stulge, Modestas; Stefanski, Brian; Moss, Robert; Chaykov, Spasen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nGalactic rotation curves have proven to be the testing ground for dark matter bounds in spiral galaxies of all morphologies. Dwarf galaxies serve as an increasingly interesting case of rotation curve dynamics due to their typically rising rotation curve as opposed to the flattening curve of large spirals. Dwarf galaxies usually vary in galactic structure and mostly terminate at small radial distances. This, coupled with the fact that Cold Dark Matter theories struggle with the universality of galactic rotation curves, allow for exclusive features of alternative gravitational models to be analyzed. Recently, The H I Nearby Galactic Survey (THINGS) has been extended to include a sample of 25 dwarf galaxies now known as the LITTLE THINGS Survey. Here, we show an application of alternative gravitational models to the LITTLE THINGS survey, specifically focusing on conformal gravity (CG) and Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND). In this work, we provide an analysis and discussion of the rotation curve predictions of each theory to the sample. Furthermore, we show how these two alternative gravitational models account for the recently observed universal trends in centripetal accelerations in spiral galaxies. This work highlights the similarities and differences of the predictions of the two theories in dwarf galaxies. The sample is not large or diverse enough to strongly favor a single theory, but we posit that both CG and MOND can provide an accurate description of the galactic dynamics in the LITTLE THINGS sample without the need for dark matter.\n\nSpace-time philosophy reconstructed via massive NordstrÃ¶m scalar gravities? Laws vs. geometry, conventionality, and underdetermination\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPitts, J. Brian\n\n2016-02-01\n\nWhat if gravity satisfied the Klein-Gordon equation? Both particle physics from the 1920-30s and the 1890s Neumann-Seeliger modification of Newtonian gravity with exponential decay suggest considering a \"graviton mass term\" for gravity, which is algebraic in the potential. Unlike NordstrÃ¶m's \"massless\" theory, massive scalar gravity is strictly special relativistic in the sense of being invariant under the PoincarÃ© group but not the 15-parameter Bateman-Cunningham conformal group. It therefore exhibits the whole of Minkowski space-time structure, albeit only indirectly concerning volumes. Massive scalar gravity is plausible in terms of relativistic field theory, while violating most interesting versions of Einstein's principles of general covariance, general relativity, equivalence, and Mach. Geometry is a poor guide to understanding massive scalar gravity(s): matter sees a conformally flat metric due to universal coupling, but gravity also sees the rest of the flat metric (barely or on long distances) in the mass term. What is the 'true' geometry, one might wonder, in line with PoincarÃ©'s modal conventionality argument? Infinitely many theories exhibit this bimetric 'geometry,' all with the total stress-energy's trace as source; thus geometry does not explain the field equations. The irrelevance of the Ehlers-Pirani-Schild construction to a critique of conventionalism becomes evident when multi-geometry theories are contemplated. Much as Seeliger envisaged, the smooth massless limit indicates underdetermination of theories by data between massless and massive scalar gravities-indeed an unconceived alternative. At least one version easily could have been developed before General Relativity; it then would have motivated thinking of Einstein's equations along the lines of Einstein's newly re-appreciated \"physical strategy\" and particle physics and would have suggested a rivalry from massive spin 2 variants of General Relativity (massless spin 2, Pauli and Fierz\n\nDETECTING TRIAXIALITY IN THE GALACTIC DARK MATTER HALO THROUGH STELLAR KINEMATICS. II. DEPENDENCE ON NATURE DARK MATTER AND GRAVITY\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRojas-NiÃ±o, Armando; Pichardo, Barbara; Valenzuela, Octavio\n\nRecent studies have presented evidence that the Milky Way global potential may be non-spherical. In this case, the assembling process of the Galaxy may have left long-lasting stellar halo kinematic fossils due to the shape of the dark matter halo, potentially originated by orbital resonances. We further investigate such a possibility, nowÂ considering potential models further away from ÎCDM halos, like scalar field dark matter halos andÂ Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), and including several other factors that may mimic the emergence and permanence of kinematic groups, such asÂ a spherical and triaxial halo with an embedded disk potential. We find that regardless ofmoreÂ Â» the density profile (DM nature), kinematic groups only appear in the presence of a triaxial halo potential. For the case of a MOND-like gravity theoryÂ no kinematic structure is present. We conclude that the detection of these kinematic stellar groups could confirm the predicted triaxiality of dark halos in cosmological galaxy formation scenarios.Â«Â less\n\nComparing dark matter models, modified Newtonian dynamics and modified gravity in accounting for galaxy rotation curves\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Xin; Tang, Li; Lin, Hai-Nan\n\n2017-05-01\n\nWe compare six models (including the baryonic model, two dark matter models, two modified Newtonian dynamics models and one modified gravity model) in accounting for galaxy rotation curves. For the dark matter models, we assume NFW profile and core-modified profile for the dark halo, respectively. For the modified Newtonian dynamics models, we discuss Milgromâs MOND theory with two different interpolation functions, the standard and the simple interpolation functions. For the modified gravity, we focus on Moffatâs MSTG theory. We fit these models to the observed rotation curves of 9 high-surface brightness and 9 low-surface brightness galaxies. We apply the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to test the goodness-of-fit of each model. It is found that none of the six models can fit all the galaxy rotation curves well. Two galaxies can be best fitted by the baryonic model without involving nonluminous dark matter. MOND can fit the largest number of galaxies, and only one galaxy can be best fitted by the MSTG model. Core-modified model fits about half the LSB galaxies well, but no HSB galaxies, while the NFW model fits only a small fraction of HSB galaxies but no LSB galaxies. This may imply that the oversimplified NFW and core-modified profiles cannot model the postulated dark matter haloes well.

Building on previous results, we propose a unified view of the effective parameters of all these theories. Based on this structure, we explore the viable space of parameters for each family of models by imposing the absence of ghosts and gradient instabilities. We then focus on the quasistatic regime and confirm that all these theories can be approximated by the phenomenological two-parameter model described by an effective Newton's constant and the gravitational slip. Within the quasistatic regime we pinpoint signatures which can distinguish between the broad classes of models (scalar-tensor, vector-tensor or bimetric). Finally, we present the equations of motion for our unified approach in such a way that they can be implemented in Einstein-Boltzmann solvers.\n\nMOND simulation suggests an origin for some peculiarities in the Local Group\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBÃ­lek, M.; Thies, I.; Kroupa, P.; Famaey, B.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nContext. The Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M 31) galaxies possess rotating planes of satellites. The formation of these planes has not been explained satisfactorily so far. It has been suggested that the MW and M 31 satellites are ancient tidal dwarf galaxies; this might explain their configuration. This suggestion gained support by an analytic backward-calculation of the relative MW-M 31 orbit in the MOND modified dynamics paradigm. The result implied that the galaxies experienced a close flyby 7-11 Gyr ago. Aims: Here we explore the Local Group history in MOND in more detail using a simplified first-ever self-consistent simulation. We describe the features induced by the encounter in the simulation and identify possible real counterparts of these features. Methods: The initial conditions were set to eventually roughly reproduce the observed MW and M 31 masses, effective radii, separation, relative velocity, and disk inclinations. We used the publicly available adaptive-mesh-refinement code Phantom of RAMSES. Results: Matter was transferred from the MW to M 31 along a tidal tail in the simulation. The encounter induced the formation of several structures resembling the peculiarities of the Local Group. Most notably are that 1) a rotating planar structure formed around M 31 from the transferred material. It had a size similar to the observed satellite plane and was oriented edge-on to the simulated MW, just as the real plane. 2) The same structure also resembled the tidal features observed around M 31 by its size and morphology. 3) A warp in the MW developed with an amplitude and orientation similar to that observed. 4) A cloud of particles formed around the simulated MW, with the extent of the actual MW satellite system. The encounter did not end by merging in a Hubble time. The simulated stellar disks also thickened as a result of the encounter. Conclusions: The simulation demonstrated that MOND might explain many peculiarities of the Local Group; this needs to\n\nCirque du Monde as a health intervention: perceptions of medical students and social circus experts.\n\nPubMed\n\nFournier, Cynthia; Drouin, MÃ©lodie-Anne; Marcoux, JÃ©rÃ©mie; Garel, Patricia; Bochud, Emmanuel; ThÃ©berge, Julie; Aubertin, Patrice; Favreau, Gil; Fleet, Richard\n\n2014-11-01\n\nTo present Cirque du Soleil's social circus program, Cirque du Monde, to explore its potential as a primary health care tool for family physicians.
