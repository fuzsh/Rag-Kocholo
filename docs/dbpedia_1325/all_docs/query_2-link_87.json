The conference at which these papers were originally presented (The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, April 2007) was organized in honor of Ellen Kohler, who devoted her life to the excavation, study, and publication of Gordion. She died two years before this volume was published, and we therefore decided to dedicate it to her memory, in recognition of the wisdom and support that she provided to all of us. A few months before this volume went to press, we also lost another friend and colleague from Gordion: Crawford Greenewalt, Jr., or “Greenie”, as he was fondly known. Many of the most significant publications in Anatolian archaeology during the last half-century have been skillfully guided by Greenie’s hand. One does not often find tangible evidence of the extent of that guidance in the publications themselves, because Greenie never allowed the full acknowledgment of his contributions to a book or article to appear; but he contributed years of his life to editing, supplementing, and improving the manuscripts that all of us were writing. In other words, we were able to mature as scholars because he was willing to use the enormous breadth of his\n\nknowledge and vision to bring our scholarship to a level that it would otherwise not have reached. We therefore respectfully dedicate this book to him as well, in memoriam, in recognition of his intellectual support and generosity of spirit. Many people have played a valuable role in the production of this book. Charles Williams and Crawford Greenewalt Jr. were founts of information on all aspects of Gordion, and they championed the project at every stage of production. Gabriel Pizzorno, Gareth Darbyshire, and Kimberly Leaman prepared and organized the illustrations, and served as a perpetual source of support, along with Mary Voigt. Gareth Darbyshire devoted long hours to the preparation of the index, and Theodora Ashmead and Walda Metcalf helped substantially with the editing, as did Caitie Barrett and Michael Strother. Jennifer Quick prepared the manuscript for publication with her customary speed and expertise, while Jim Mathieu provided overall guidance for the Penn Museum Publications department. The comments from the two anonymous reviewers were enormously helpful. It is a pleasure to acknowledge the financial support for the volume’s publication from the Penn Museum, the 1984 Foundation, the Provost’s Research Fund of the University of Pennsylvania, and the George B. Storer Foundation.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\n1\n\nIntroduction: The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion C. Brian Rose\n\nB\n\netween the fall of the Hittite Kingdom and the creation of the Persian empire, there arose in central and southern Asia Minor a series of powerful states whose rulers occasionally claimed descent from the Hittite kings, and whose inhabitants spoke a variety of languages—Luwian, Aramaic, Lydian, and Phrygian, among others (Mellink 1992; Hawkins 2000; Bryce 2005:384). Fieldwork at several of the leading cities in these states began over 50 years ago, but within the last two decades they have yielded an astonishing series of new discoveries that have completely altered our understanding of early 1st millennium BC Anatolia, including the monumental fortification wall at Sardis, the Phrygian inscriptions of the palace entrance at Kerkenes, and the Kattamuwa stele from Zincirli, which speaks of a soul separate from the body (Dusinberre 2003:49–56; Draycott and Summers 2008; Wilford 2008). Some of the most dramatic new discoveries have been made at Gordion, the Phrygian capital that controlled much of central Asia Minor for close to two centuries and interacted with empires and states both east and west, including Lydia, Greece, Assyria, Persia, and the Syro-Hittite realm of Tabal, among others. Excavations have been conducted at Gordion over the course of the last 60 years: between 1950 and 1974 by Rodney Young, and from 1988 to 2006 by Mary Voigt. Although for many years its topographical development was regarded as relatively well understood, a recently revised analysis of Gordion’s chronology has transformed what had been interpreted as a Kimmerian attack of ca. 700 BC into a conflagration possibly related to new construction that occurred 100 years earlier (DeVries 2007, 2008, Voigt 2005, Rose and Darby­\n\nshire 2011). As a consequence, the chronology of Phrygian architecture, ceramics, and artifacts has changed dramatically, as has our understanding of the history and archaeology of central Anatolia during the Iron Age. In spite of the economic and political importance of Gordion and Phrygian culture in general, both topics have consistently been omitted from courses in Old World archaeology, primarily because Gordion lies too far to the west for many Near Eastern archaeologists, and too far to the east for those in the Classical world. The lack of scholarly focus on Phrygia has begun to change only recently. Several new books and articles on Phrygian topography and religion have appeared within the last decade (Uçankus 2002; Berndt-Ersöz 2006; Sivas and Tüfekçi Sivas 2007; Sams 2011b; Voigt 2011; Roller 2011), and an overview of recent research at Gordion was published in 2005, under the title The Archaeology of Midas and the Phrygians (Kealhofer 2005). Only a few of the chapters in the latter volume focused on the Phrygian settlements, however, and there remained a need for a second volume that dealt more comprehensively with the changing topography of Gordion and its surroundings from the 10th century BC through the arrival of Alexander in 333. With this objective in mind, a conference on the Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion was held at the University of Pennsylvania in April 2007, with papers that spanned six centuries of Gordion’s history and included talks on the regional exploitation of wood, flora, and fauna in antiquity, as well as the consistently fluctuating interaction between the site’s inhabitants and the landscape.\n\n2\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\nWe also wanted to highlight the techniques we have developed to present our vision of Phrygian Gordion to the public—both the conservation/ reconstruction of the buildings themselves, and their graphic rendering on a multi-phase plan. We therefore included chapters on Gordion’s new site management plan by Frank Matero, on landscape preservation by Naomi Miller, and on the reconstruction of the city plan by Gabriel Pizzorno and Gareth Darbyshire.1 Nearly all of the papers delivered at the conference appear in these proceedings, and to them we have added an unpublished article on Midas and Delphi by the late Keith DeVries. The authors whose names are highlighted in bold in this Introduction have contributed chapters to the volume. Rather than summarizing each of the talks in this chapter, I have opted to present an overview of the topographic development of Gordion, incorporating references to this volume’s chapters within the larger narrative and linking the archaeological changes as much as possible to contemporary historical events in Anatolia and the Near East. During the last few decades the chronological designations for the Phrygian levels have changed—what began as “Persian” was reassigned to “Middle Phrygian,” and two different but linked systems are now commonly used. One is periodic (Early, Middle, Late Phrygian) and derives from the Young excavations; the other is based on stratigraphy, with a YHSS prefix (Yassıhöyük Stratigraphic Sequence), and was formulated by Mary Voigt. The two systems with numerical dates for the Phrygian levels appear below: Early Iron Age Initial Early Phrygian Early Phrygian Early Phrygian Destruction Middle Phrygian Late Phrygian\n\nyhss 7\n\n11th c.–ca. 950 BC\n\nyhss 6B\n\nca. 950–900 BC yhss 6A ca. 900–800 BC ca. 800 BC yhss 5 ca. 800–540 BC yhss 4 ca. 540–330 BC\n\nThe beginning of the Early Phrygian Period is generally dated to the 10th century BC, although\n\nthe Phrygians’ ancestors appear to have arrived in central Anatolia from Thrace during the 12th century, at roughly the same time in which another Thracian group began to occupy the citadel of Troy (Sams 1988, 1994a; DeVries 1990:371–72, 390–91; Wittke 2004; Vassileva 2005a. For Troy, see Rose 2008). As Mary Voigt and Robert Henrickson have noted: There is no stratigraphic break to indicate a significant hiatus in settlement at Gordion after the fall of the Hittites, so that time alone cannot account for the observed changes in architecture, domestic features, ceramics, and animal remains between the Late Bronze and the Early Iron Age. The ceramic data do not support a gradual transition from the Late Bronze Age into the Early Iron Age. Instead, the archaeological evidence strongly suggests a population change at this time, rather than simply a shift in political and economic organization. (Henrickson and Voigt 1998:101)2 The Early Phrygian citadel and its surroundings looked very different from what one sees today. The settlement would probably have risen 5–9 m above the surrounding plain (vs. 13–16.5 m today), and the Sakarya River lay on the east side of the mound (as one can see in Fig. 3.2 of Ben Marsh’s chapter), having traveled to the western side relatively recently, perhaps as late as the 19th century (Marsh 1997:23–26; 1999; 2005). We currently perceive the mound as having contained a unified settlement across the upper surface, and from the Hellenistic period onward that was true; but in the Early Phrygian period the mound was probably significantly smaller, with a high, fortified elite quarter at the east (the “Eastern Mound”), a low domestic quarter at the west, probably unfortified (the “Western Mound”), and a street that cut diagonally through them (foldout plan in back pocket) (Voigt et al. 1997:4–6).3 The street was over 7 m wide and slightly over 2 m lower than the walking level in the Terrace Zone area, while its length, from one end of the mound to the other, would have been ca. 285 m (Fig. 1.1). The citadel’s central area, on the east side of the mound of Yassihöyük, had reached its final form before the end of the 9th century and was divided\n\nIntroduction: The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.1. South Enclosure walls. Section facing northwest. Drawing: W.W. Cummer. Source: Gordion Project, Penn Museum.\n\ninto two zones of very different function (Fig. 1.2) (DeVries 1990:373–77). A gate building probably decorated with carved stone orthostats was framed by two wings, one of which, at the north, was used for the storage of pithoi (Sams 1995, 2005; DeVries 1990:377).4 The gate led to two courts (the “Outer,” which was stone-paved, and the “Inner”), separated from each other by a wall that must have been over 4 m high judging by the breadth of its foundations. This was a quarter intended for the elite. Although both courts were flanked by megarons, the Inner Court was much larger, with three times as many megarons. Reconstructing their original number is not easy since the remains are so lacunose; but the Middle Phrygian buildings are similar in number, size, and position to that of their predecessors. This fact, coupled with the foundations uncovered by Young, enables one to posit as many as 12 megarons in the Inner Court— vs. 4 in the outer one—with 4 on the western side and 8 on the eastern side, organized in two rows of 4 set opposite each other (cf. DeVries 1990:396) (foldout plan). A more precise discussion of the reconstruction method appears in the chapter by Gabe Pizzorno and Gareth Darbyshire, along with\n\na color phase plan that juxtaposes the Early and Middle Phrygian buildings. The 4 megarons in the Early Phrygian Outer Court, nearest the gate, appear to have had pebbled floors, with an unusually elaborate mosaic featuring polychromatic geometric designs in the main room of Megaron 2 (Salzmann 1982:4, 6–8, 78, 93–94 nos. 46–56; Megaron 2, Young 1958:143; Megarons 9, 12, Young 1964:288–90; Young 1965; Megaron 1, DeVries 1980a:37).5 Another zone of activity, on the southwest side of the citadel (the “Terrace Zone”), was devoted to industry. Although only 11 buildings here have been excavated, one can safely reconstruct two long rows of buildings—8 in each row positioned on either side of a 16 m wide court (foldout plan). The length of each building is close to twice its width, so each group of two represents a nearly perfect square, and the interior, at 21 x 11.50 m, encompasses approximately the same space as the megarons at Mycenae, Pylos, and Tiryns. Within the rooms was preserved an abundance of equipment for textile and grain processing, with some buildings containing between 500 and 600 loomweights (DeVries 1990:385–86; Burke 2005:71, fig. 6-2).6\n\n4\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\nM12\n\n8\n\nM11\n\nInner Court\n\nM4\n\nM10\n\n7 3 2\n\nCC Building\n\nM9 6 5\n\n1\n\nM3\n\nOuter Court M1\n\n4\n\nTerrace Building\n\nM2\n\n3 2 1\n\nGate Building\n\nYASSIHÖYÜK/GORDION Early Phrygian Period YHSS Phase 6A\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100 M\n\nFig. 1.2.

Source: Gordion Project, Penn Museum.\n\nKeith DeVries felt there was enough evidence to estimate the work force that would have handled this equipment on a regular basis, and made his calculations using the following method: 2 of the 8 buildings on the east side of the zone appear to have been used for storage, while the rest were intended for industrial activity. If one assumes the same situation at the west, then 12 would have been devoted to some aspect of production. Each one would have been large enough to house at least 25 people, almost certainly women; this would have meant a total of\n\n300 workers in the zone if all of the buildings were in operation simultaneously (DeVries 1980a:40). Primary access between the elite and industrial quarters appears, not surprisingly, to have been limited to one door on the inner side of the Gate Complex, with the backs of the industrial buildings facing the elite megarons at the east. Indeed, the highly restricted access routes between these districts suggest a society more tightly controlled than any other in Anatolia or the Near East. Although there was very likely a second city gate, careful coordina-\n\nIntroduction: The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion\n\ntion of traffic would have been essential, especially given the fact that workers would have continually exited to retrieve water from the Sakarya River since there were no wells or cisterns on the citadel (Young 1964:286). Other than the elite objects discovered in Megaron 3, one receives a glimpse of aristocratic life in the citadel during this period from the “doodle stones,” or incised drawings on the exterior of Megaron 2, analyzed here by Lynn Roller. These feature men, animals, and scenes that may refer to falconry, some of which may be linked to the Matar cult; they stand in stark contrast to the kind of activity that would have occurred in the industrial zone, with hundreds of women, probably slaves, providing the infrastructure for that lifestyle. Until recently, the achievements of Early Phrygian Gordion were assumed to have occurred during the 8th century, but the radiocarbon and dendrochronological dates of seeds and wood found within the destruction level, coupled with the type and style of the associated artifacts and pottery, indicate a date of ca. 800 BC for the conflagration (Voigt 2005, DeVries 2007, 2008; DeVries in Rose and Darbyshire 2011). This discovery, in turn, allows us to situate Early Phrygian Gordion in a different historical context, set against the reigns of a series of powerful men: Assurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III in Assyria, Sarduri I of Urartu in northeastern Anatolia, and Hiram I and Solomon in Phoenicia and Israel, respectively. We have no contemporary references to Gordion in the Assyrian texts, although the Muski—the Assyrian word for Phrygians—are mentioned in the Annals of Assurnasirpal II as having paid tribute to the king at the beginning of his reign (Wittke 2004).7 In addition to tribute, there is good evidence for diplomatic and gift exchanges between these and other rulers, as evinced by the rock-cut relief of King Warpalawas at İvriz, near Konya. The ivory horse trappings in North Syrian style found in one of Gordion’s Terrace Building units probably fall into a similar category (Young 1962a:166–67).8 The new chronology also demonstrates that Gordion’s Early Phrygian architecture was even more innovative than had been previously thought: the site featured the earliest known stone megaron and akroterion in the Near East, dating to the initial Early Phrygian building phase in the 10th century\n\n5\n\nBC, as well as the earliest pebble mosaics, dated to the 9th century. The rows of workshops, over 100 m in length, were among the longest in Anatolia, second only to those in the Hittite capital at Hattuşas. The roofing systems are particularly noteworthy: the ceiling of Megaron 2 featured beams over 10 m in length with no internal supports, which is, as far as we know, a more daring feat of engineering than one would have found in roughly contemporary Assyrian palaces, including the throne room of Assurnasirpal II (884–859 BC) at Nimrud (Liebhart 1988). Such an achievement attests to an unusually high level of skill in architecture and carpentry, but it also led to extensive exploitation of the surrounding landscape. The latter subject is explored by John Marston, who has undertaken a comprehensive study of Gordion’s utilization of specific wood types with an eye toward clarifying issues of ecology and landscape during the Phrygian period. The amount of earth-moving that occurred during the Early Phrygian period would have been enormous, as one can judge from the monumental burial mounds, such as Tumulus W, or the tons of earth that separate the “Early Phrygian Building” in the elite quarter from Megaron 9, which stood above it. Moreover, the industrial buildings were constructed on a terrace that rose 2 m above the level of the Outer and Inner Courts, which would have necessitated the transport of over 20,000 m3 of earth to the citadel. Nevertheless, even a project as extensive as the latter would have involved less earth than was necessary to build a medium-sized tumulus, and would have represented no significant challenge to a community accustomed to such ambitious building projects (DeVries 1990:373–74).9 An even more monumental public works project was still to come: toward the end of the 9th century, the rulers of Gordion planned for a major change in the appearance of the citadel—not in the number and general layout of the settlement’s buildings (at least on the Eastern Mound), but in the height of the citadel itself, which would be raised 4–5 m above its Early Phrygian level. This involved the excavation and movement of over half a million cubic meters of clay—the same kind of herculean public works project that is foreshadowed in the construction of Tumulus W and would reappear 60 years later when Tumulus MM was created.\n\n6\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\nPreparations for the new project were already under way ca. 800 BC: the builders had blocked the access route between the Terrace Zone and the Outer Court, and had begun the process of laying rubble and clay fill in a partially dismantled Gate Complex, while adding new water facilities related to construction, as Mary Voigt’s chapter in this volume carefully demonstrates. Megaron 3 had been filled with a variety of luxury goods, many of which were found near the door and therefore perhaps placed here for storage during construction; most of the other megarons had been emptied of their contents,\n\nalthough the buildings in the Terrace Zone still contained the equipment for weaving, grinding, and cooking that were in use there. It was at this time that a massive fire swept through the site during one of the summer months, with the flames probably fanned by winds from the north (DeVries 1980a:36; 1990:386).10 The fire may, in fact, have been caused by construction-related activities, although summer fires in Anatolia were probably just as common then as they are now.

This, of course, ties into the question of the number of city gates in operation at the end of the Early Phrygian period, and given the fact that the main gate was blocked before the fire started, the existence of a second city gate is virtually certain, as Mary Voigt argues in her chapter. The redating of the destruction level has completely transformed our understanding of the material culture of Asia Minor in the late 9th century, as Kenneth Sams demonstrates in his chapter. Ceramics that were regarded as typologically backward in the old chronology can now be shown to have been innovative in form and decoration, just like the\n\narchitecture and city planning in evidence on the eastern side of the citadel. The earliest Phrygian inscriptions can now be placed ca. 800 BC or shortly thereafter, which means that they precede the oldest Greek inscriptions by at least a half-century (Rose and Darbybshire 2011; Sass 2005:146–52). Moreover, it is now clear that the destruction levels at Gordion and Hasanlu date to the same time, thereby supplying us with unusually detailed views of the public infrastructure in place ca. 800 BC at two key fortified citadels in central Anatolia and northwestern Iran (Dyson 1989). During the new building program none of the earlier buildings was dismantled, and the Early Phrygian Gate Complex was actually used to support the foundations of its Middle Phrygian successor, which is why so many cracks are now visible in the masonry of the earlier structure (DeVries 1990:391–400). Other than the greater height of the new citadel, the layout of the constituent buildings was essen-\n\n8\n\nFig. 1.5. Plan of the settlement with the forts of Kuş Tepe and Küçük Höyük.

Source: Gordion Project, Penn Museum.\n\ntially the same, although there were a few significant changes: the same number of Terrace Zone buildings were constructed, but they were shifted farther toward the new gate complex, and the vestibule of each building became much deeper so that it was essentially the same size as the main room (foldout plan). The buildings were also free-standing rather than components of a single conjoined row, presumably to hinder the spread of fire (Fig. 1.3). The stepped Glacis of the new citadel was faced with sections of different colored stones, apparently from several different quarries (Fig. 1.4) (Voigt and Young 1999:205).13 Although color had been a significant component of Early Phrygian architecture and its decoration, the choice of stone in this case may also have been intended to highlight the extent of the area under Phrygian control.14 Such a manipulation of colored stone in architecture is also reminiscent of the alternating light and dark orthostat reliefs at Arslantepe/Malatya and Carchemish\n\nduring the same general period. One completely new addition was Building A—a six-room complex constructed on the southeast side of the citadel adjacent to the Middle Phrygian Gate, which would have conveyed a sense of greater impregnability to the citadel’s visitors. Although both the Eastern and Western Mounds were raised, the central street was not, which meant that it now lay ca. 7 m below the new occupation level within the Middle Phrygian citadel. The two mounds would consequently have seemed even higher than they actually were. The new building program also included an outer fortification system that featured mud-brick walls at least 4 m high set on stone foundations 3.50 m thick, within a defensive ditch immediately in front of them.15 Square towers were constructed at intervals of ca. 16 m, and the entire area under protection now reached nearly 500,000 m2 (Figs. 1.6–1.9) (Sams 2010, Marsh 1999).16 The walls were linked\n\n10\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\nto forts constructed at the northern end (Kuş Tepe) and the southeast (Küçük Höyük) (Fig. 1.5). The latter mound was excavated by Machteld Mellink between 1956 and 1958, and revealed a mud-brick platform 12 m in height, at least 50 m long, and over 10 m wide, on top of which a four-story wood and mud-brick fortress had been constructed (Fig. 1.6) (Young 1957:324–25; 1958:140–41; Edwards 1959:264; Mellink 1959). The extent and position of these fortifications did not become clear until a program of magnetic prospection conducted between 2007 and 2009 revealed conclusively that the fortifications reached as far north as Kuş Tepe (Figs. 1.7, 1.8). Such a dual system of defenses with inner and outer fortifications has a long history in ancient Near East, beginning at least as early as the 3rd\n\nmillennium BC at Troy and continuing in the late Bronze and early Iron Age at Hattuşas, Kanesh, Zincirli, and Troy again in a different configuration (Jablonka 2006; for Troy, Rose 2008:409n55; for Hattusas, Seeher 2002; for Kanesh, Özgüç 1999; for Zincirli, Wartke 2005). The Trojan system also featured a defensive ditch, as did a relatively large number of settlements in Anatolia (Carchemish), Syria (Qatna, Ebla, Kadesh), and Palestine (Hazor, Lachish, Askelon), among others, so the presence of such a feature at Gordion is not unexpected (Bunimovitz 1992; Finkelstein 1992).17 The excavation of the fortification walls on either side of Küçük Höyük did not yield clear evidence for dating, but the earliest evidence for occupation within the Lower Town is Middle Phrygian (Voigt and Young 1999:211–15), and the following\n\nFig. 1.7.

To raise the level of the citadel mounds, the work force used approximately 175,000 m3 of clay, and trace elements demonstrate that a substantial quantity of it came from the area adjacent to the Sakarya River (Voigt and Young 1999:203n6). In other words, there would have been a massive excavation along the river at the same spot in which the fortifications were built. It seems logical to assume that the digging for the foundations of the city wall yielded a substantial amount of the clay used to raise the level of the central part of the citadel, and that the two operations were part of a single building program. Such simultaneous construction of inner and outer fortifications was relatively common in Anatolia and the Near East in antiquity, both in the Bronze Age and in later periods. If the same situation prevailed here, which seems compelling, then we can date the construction of the outer fortifications to the early 8th century.18 The building program at the beginning of the Middle Phrygian period would therefore have been even more monumental than we have assumed.19 Here too we should view such extensive building activity against the backdrop of an almost equally energetic campaign of city foundations and citadel constructions in eastern Anatolia (Urartu under Argishti I), the Upper Euphrates (Zincirli/Sam’al in North Syria), and Assyria (Nimrud under Assurnasirpal II). Each new construction would have highlighted the need for increasingly sophisticated defenses in the other areas. It is worth noting that the population of Gordion increased significantly at this point, as surface survey and excavation have demonstrated, and with the coordinate increase in agricultural cultivation, more irrigation channels would have been cut, thereby furnishing additional clay for building activities in the citadel (Kealhofer 2005:148; Miller 2010). There is, of course, the question of how such a large population would have been fed, and many of the answers can fortunately be pulled from the site’s plant and animals remains, as the work of Naomi Miller and Melinda Zeder has demonstrated (Miller, Zeder, and Arter 2009). It may have been only at this time that substantial buildings began to be constructed in the Lower Town, in the area protected by the new fortification\n\nwall. In an area near Küçük Höyük Mary Voigt uncovered several Middle Phrygian buildings set on an artificial terrace well above the level of the plain—a development that is noteworthy in itself (Sams and Voigt 1995:375–76); Voigt et al. 1997:6–8). Ben Marsh shows in his chapter that alluviation from the Sakarya River increased significantly during the first half of the Middle Phrygian period, probably in large part due to the massive removal of clay along the river’s course. Deforestation and grazing may also have played a role; but in any event, the periodic flooding that had begun to occur would have necessitated the construction of terraces for the new Lower Town structures, although the flooding would have been hindered by the new fortification walls. New construction extended to the Western Mound as well: massive rubble foundations of Middle Phrygian date were excavated at the northwest corner of the Western Mound, possibly suggesting that a defensive wall now surrounded the public buildings and dwellings that appear to have existed there (Voigt and Young 1999:210–11; Voigt 2000:194). Further to the northwest lay the Outer Town, which was also the site of new occupation at this time, although excavation has revealed few of the houses that once punctuated the area (Voigt 2005:35). Combining all of the evidence for new building at Gordion during the 8th century allows us to reconstruct the following program: a 5 m rise in the heights of both Eastern and Western Mounds, with new monumental structures in both areas; the construction of an outer line of defense protected by a ditch and by forts at north and southeast; and the beginning of habitation in both the Lower and Outer Town, which were, in turn, linked by the stonepaved street that separated the Eastern and Western Mounds.20 It is only during this period of 8th century construction that we have evidence for the lives of two of Gordion’s rulers—Gordias and Midas. Our information regarding the former is limited to the story of the knotted cornel bark attached to the ox-cart in which he had first entered the city; but Midas, reportedly his son, was an historical character whose career is described in contemporary writing (Roller 1983; Roller 1984; Mellink 1992:622–34; Sams 1995, DeVries 2008, Berndt-Ersöz 2008).21 The Greek and Latin citations indicate that he mar-\n\nIntroduction: The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion\n\n13\n\nFig. 1.9.

Source: Gordion Project, Penn Museum.\n\nried the daughter of the ruler of Aeolian Kyme and was the first non-Greek to have made a dedication at Delphi, specifically a wood and ivory throne that Herodotos saw in the Corinthian Treasury there.22 A part of this may still exist: a statuette of an ivory lion-tamer in Phrygian style, probably dating to the late 8th century, was actually discovered near the Delphic Corinthian Treasury, and in this volume Keith DeVries attempts to link the statuette to the throne in question. The most important references to Midas are in the Assyrian Annals, where he is referred to as Mita of Mushki, and these constitute our best historical sources for Phrygian military and diplomatic initiatives during the 8th century, most of which involved the Assyrians and the city-states in the Upper Euphrates/Taurus region. By the middle of the 8th century, many of these city-states were either independent or Urartian allies, having earlier been Assyrian vassals. With the advent in 745 of Tiglath-Pileser III, who launched a new war on Urartu, allegiances\n\nshifted again, and several of the Syro-Hittite citystates sent tribute to the new king, such as Urik(ki) of Que (Cilicia) and Warpalawas of Tyana.23 This change in allegiance was also transitory: the Assyrian Annals indicate that during the last quarter of the 8th century Midas’ support against the Assyrians was increasingly sought by cities in the Upper Euphrates region, including Pisiri of Carchemish, Ambaris, King of Tabal, and Kurti of Atuna.24 Midas’ prominence, however, clearly extended across a much wider area, as attested by the discovery in Tyana of a stone stele, probably basalt, that had been erected by Midas himself (Mellink 1979; Brixhe and Lejeune 1984:260–67, no. T2).25 The presence of such a stele in Tyana is not surprising, since the king of the area, Warpalawas, was an ally of Midas, but the inscription is striking in that it was written in Phrygian even though Luwian was the primary language in the area. By 709 Assyrian power had clearly forced Midas to reverse course: he sent tribute to Sargon II and sub-\n\n14\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\nsophisticated fortifications. What is surprising, in light of Gordion’s extensive interaction with North Syria, is the absence of sculptural representations of Gordias or Midas. During the 8th and 7th centuries, many of the Syro-Hittite city-states featured public stone statues of their kings, often 3 or 4 m high, while at Gordion none of the settlement’s rulers appear to have been represented in sculpture or painting, and the same was true for Lydia.26 The primary mode of commemoration for the Phrygian kings lay in their tumuli, and in at least one case it looks as if a royal tumulus actually influenced the architecture of the citadel. This is Tumulus W, the oldest known burial mound at Gordion (mid-9th century), which was set on the highest point of a ridge to the northeast of the city. It looks as if the Early Phrygian Gate Complex was turned from its planned orientation so that both tumulus and gate were directly aligned (cf. Young 1962a:168). As Richard Liebhart has argued, it seems that a prominent individual at Gordion died while the gate was being constructed, which prompted the entrance to be modified so that anyone leaving the citadel would be directed toward the burial mound (Fig. 1.9).27 During the Middle Phrygian rebuilding, the Gate was rotated approximately 30 degrees further toward the southeast, so that one now looked in the direcFig. 1.10.

Magnetic prospection reveals sequently intercepted anti-Assyrian agents en route that this tumulus was never looted, and it should from Que to Urartu, ultimately turning them over to contain the tomb of an individual whose importance the Assyrian governor of Que (Mellink 1992:622). to the Middle Phrygian settlement was paramount. With so much military conflict and shifting alle Tumulus MM, which is the subject of four giances, it is hardly surprising that Gordion and sevchapters in this volume, stands nearly twice the size eral of the neo-Hittite city-states constructed such of Tumulus W and can be seen from virtually every\n\nIntroduction: The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion\n\ncorner of the site and its surroundings. Once regarded as the tomb of Midas himself, the dendrochronology points to a date ca. 740 BC for its construction, which suggests that the tomb was built by Midas at the beginning of his reign to honor his predecessor. The mound was nevertheless just as much a monument to Midas himself in that it was the largest tumulus in Asia Minor, and would remain so until the construction of the burial mound of the Lydian king Alyattes at Sardis nearly 200 years later (Hanfmann 1980:100–101). Especially noteworthy is the technique used to construct the wooden tomb chamber within MM, which had to bear the weight of a 53 m high mound set above it, as Richard Liebhart has outlined in his chapter. It is this feat of engineering for which Midas should be remembered rather than the vast quantities of gold attached to him by later Greek and Latin authors. As has often been pointed out, not a single object of gold was discovered within the tomb chamber, nor are gold objects commonly found in excavations on the mound or in tumuli (for gold, DeVries 1990:382; for gold ring, rosette, Edwards 1959:265, 266; for gold and electrum fibulae and jewelry, Young 1962a:166; for furniture decoration, Young 1964:287; for gold foil, Voigt and Young 1999:211; for the tumuli, Kohler 1980; 1995:197). Yet as Mary Ballard notes in her chapter, we may be viewing the story of Midas’ gold through the wrong lens. The shroud that covered the 60-year-old occupant of Tumulus MM featured an inorganic pigment called goethite that endowed the garment with a kind of golden appearance that may have been replicated in the textiles for which the Phrygians were famous. Richard Liebhart’s inspection of the chamber has also yielded an astonishing new discovery: it appears that some of the mourners at the funeral had their names inscribed on a wooden beam that was added to the roof at the conclusion of the ceremony (Sams 2010; Liebhart et al. n.d.). Most of this 9 m long beam cannot currently be viewed due to its location on the roof, but names appear on both ends of the beam, thereby suggesting that more of them were similarly inscribed, and one of those names also appears on a bronze bowl found by Young within the tomb chamber (Brixhe and Lejeune 1984:98–100, G-105). This practice, if interpreted correctly, differs little from that involving memorial books at modern\n\n15\n\nfunerals, but it was unique in antiquity as far as we know. The menu of the funeral meal, which included barbecued goat or lamb, a lentil stew, and a winebeer-mead punch, has been reconstructed by Patrick McGovern based on the residue in the vessels, while reconstructions of the extraordinary boxwood serving stands that held the various dishes are presented here by Elizabeth Simpson, who situates them within the context of woodworking at Gordion (for the meal, McGovern et al. 1999; for furniture, Simpson 2010). As Maya Vassileva notes, the Phrygians were equally famous for the fibulae and bronze belts that were found in large quantities in Tumulus MM and some of the other tumuli at Gordion. These fibulae have been found as far west as Athens and Olympia, while the belts, which occasionally featured incised geometric decoration, were imported by elite Greeks and dedicated in such high-profile sanctuaries as Delphi, Didyma, and Samos (Vassileva 2005b, 2007). Strabo linked the end of Midas’ life to the Kimmerian raids on Asia Minor ca. 700 BC, and most scholars found this relatively easy to accept as long as the destruction level of the site was dated to the same period (Strabo 1.3.21). The new chronology, however, has cast doubt not just on the circumstances of Midas’ death, but also on the presence of the Kimmerians in this part of Anatolia (Ivantchik 2001; Berndt-Ersöz 2008:22–29). Certainly their strength during the late 8th and 7th century was formidable: the Urartian kingdoms were heavily damaged by Kimmerian raids in 714, and both Sargon II and the Lydian king Gyges reportedly died in combat with them in 705 and 654/2, respectively. There may in fact be some evidence for their attack on Gordion, although it is to be found in an extramural Middle Phrygian settlement northeast of the citadel. Excavation in this area, analyzed here by Gunlög Anderson, yielded a cemetery (the “Common Cemetery”) above houses that appear to have been destroyed by an attack ca. 700. Although it is clear that the citadel was not seriously damaged by the Kimmerians, the outlying areas may have been.28 The 7th century evidentiary record at Gordion is not as full as that from the 9th and 8th centuries, but a significant amount of relevant material has been uncovered during both the Young and Voigt excavations, bringing new clarity to issues of local\n\n16\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\nceramic production and construction techniques as well as changes in agriculture and diet (Voigt et al. 1997, Voigt and Young 1999). The tumulus tradition continued, as did the wooden tomb chambers, but they now held both inhumation and cremation burials. If one examines five of those constructed between 650 and 600, one immediately notices the disappearance of the bronze belts and fibulae that had been so characteristic of the Phrygian elite during the 9th and 8th centuries, although gold objects now began to be included in the funeral assemblages (Kohler 1980, 1995). Thus far there is little evidence for contact with the Greek world during this period: only a small amount of imported pottery (Corinthian Late Geometric and Protocorinthian) has been uncovered, and only three amphoras, all of which date toward the end of the 7th century (DeVries 1980a, 1997, 2005, 2007, 2008). At some point toward the end of the 7th century, Gordion’s power began to diminish as that of Lydia grew, and Lydian influence is clearly detectable in Gordion’s archaeological record throughout the first half of the 6th century (Mellink 1992:648–49). Electrum coins struck in Lydia were in use at the site ca. 600 BC or shortly thereafter, and the brightly colored figural and geometric architectural terracottas that begin to appear at Gordion in the early 6th century are probably in part a by-product of Lydian influence (Young 1964:283; for Lydian hoard, Bellinger 1968; Akerström 1966:136–61; for architectural terracottas, Glendinning 2005). The fact that such substantial quantities of Lydian pottery have been found in the fort of Küçük Höyük may also suggest the presence of a Lydian garrison there (Young 1958:141). A visitor to Gordion from Lydian Sardis would undoubtedly have been struck by the large number of similarities between the two cities, as Crawford Greenewalt cleverly demonstrates in this volume.29 The influence of Phrygian culture on other areas of Asia Minor, however, was still pronounced: recent excavations at Kerkenes, nearly 250 km east of Gordion, have revealed a late 7th/early 6th century entrance to the palatial complex that features a Phrygian dedicatory inscription, while other areas of the site have produced an aniconic cult idol and bronzes in Phrygian style. At Midas City, nearly 100 km west of Gordion, a rock-cut monumental façade perhaps carved in the early 6th century was\n\ndedicated to Midas, apparently as a kind of heroon, even though the area in question was now controlled by the Lydians (for Kerkenes, Draycott and Summers 2008; for Midas City, Berndt 2002).30 In the end, Gordion’s sophisticated fortification system and its defenders folded in the face of the mid-6th century Persian attack: a large siege mound similar to the one at Cypriot Paphos is still preserved on the southeast side of Küçük Höyük, and hundreds of trilobate arrowheads discovered within the remains of the fort indicate overwhelming archery fire (Young 1957:324; Mellink 1959). Magnetometry and electric resistivity have also revealed the existence of a smaller siege mound against the northwest face of Kuş Tepe, which was reduced to an enormous pile of mud-brick as a consequence of the attack. Only two human skeletons were found in the remains of Küçük Höyük, but the casualties must have been high, as during the Persian attack on Lydian Sardis. With Gordion’s two forts subdued, the Persians probably seized control of the city relatively quickly, and the compromised fortifications were never rebuilt. Yet in this new phase of Persian control, generally referred to as Late Phrygian, the site continued to prosper, with notable new construction in several areas of the Eastern Mound during the late 6th/early 5th century (DeVries 1990:400).31 These include the rebuilding of a massive megaron (Building C) and the addition of a small but extensively decorated structure at the northwest of the Gate Complex (for Building C, see Young 1955:8; Mellink 1980b:91). The latter featured polychromatic wall mosaics and painted processional friezes, probably related to cult, that provide our sole representations of Phrygian women at Gordion (Fig. 1.10) (Mellink 1980b).32 More imposing was a radical addition to Building A (the “Mosaic Building”), the evidence for which Brendan Burke presents in this volume: the western end now featured a stone-paved court that led to a large room decorated with an elaborate pebble mosaic, and a colonnaded court with painted architectural elements at the south. At some point in the late 5th or early 4th century the citadel buildings collapsed and began to be spoliated, although the precise chronology is not yet clear. Pharnabazos, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, wintered at Gordion in 408 BC with a contin-\n\nIntroduction: The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion\n\ngent of Athenians, which suggests a relatively high level of prominence still in place, but an earthquake may have occurred shortly thereafter, as well as an attack by the Spartan general Agesilaos in 395 BC.33 Although the Hellenica Oxyrhynchia notes that the Spartan attack was unsuccessful, a profusion of arrowheads discovered by Young within and around the gate probably stems from that attack and stands as an indication of its severity (Young 1955:11).34 By the same token, however, it also proves that the citadel’s defenses were still functioning. Several of the Middle Phrygian buildings had been robbed of stone before these events occurred, but the spoliation increased as the 4th century progressed, and the configuration of the mound was radically transformed (for those well underway by 500 BC, Voigt and Young 1999:202; for those of the mid-5th century, Edwards 1959:265).35 Much of what had been the elite quarter was now devoted to metallurgical activities: a bronze foundry was constructed above the remains of the Painted House, and an ironworking complex was set up nearby (for bronze foundry, Young 1955:3, 10; for ironworking, Sams and Voigt 1990:79; 1991:460; Voigt and Young 1999:220, 224).36 Yet none of this should be taken as evidence of a depressed economy. There is abundant evidence for the manufacture of alabaster, antler, and bone items, and the number of Greek imports actually increased at this time (Sams and Voigt 1990:79; Voigt, pers. comm. 2010). There also appears to have been a flourishing trade route in place between Gordion and the Black Sea site of Herakleia Pontike, as Mark Lawall demonstrates in this volume. Nevertheless, at the time of Alexander’s arrival, one of the few prominent buildings still largely intact would have been the “Mosaic Building” adjacent to Building A, and this is perhaps the best candidate for the structure that would have held Gordias’ ox-cart with the legendary knot.37 Until this point, the topography of the central part of the city had remained relatively stable, but this too would change in the early Hellenistic period: the central street that had divided the Eastern and Western Mounds was completely filled in, thereby creating a relatively level surface across the entire area that can still be seen today (DeVries 1990:400–401). Although this would have been a small-scale enterprise by comparison to some of the\n\n17\n\nother public works projects at Gordion, it would still have involved the movement of nearly 14,000 m3 of earth. The newly leveled area provided additional space for habitation, and houses were gradually built across it in the course of the Hellenistic period. The reasons for this leveling program were no doubt varied, but one may have been the shifting course of the Sakarya in the Lower Town, which probably made habitation there more difficult; another would have been the increased security that residence on the mound would have supplied, which is a phenomenon that occurred repeatedly at Troy as well. Encapsulating all of these topographical changes in a single comprehensive plan is a daunting prospect, and the foldout color phase plan included at the back of this volume, influenced in part by Wilhelm Dörp­feld’s plan of Troy, is still a work in progress that will change as new data become available. But this plan, together with the articles contained within this volume, will provide a new basis for assessing the evolving topography of Gordion during much of the 1st millennium BC, as well as the states and empires with which the Phrygian kingdom interacted.38 Notes\n\n1.1. Two of the papers will hopefully be published separately in other publications: Melinda Zeder (Diachronic Patterns of Animal Exploitation at Gordion) and Robert Henrickson (The Iron Age Beginnings of the Early Phrygian Ceramic Tradition). 1.2. The larger number of horse bones in the Early Iron Age levels may indicate that the new settlers brought horses with them (Zeder and Arter 1994:114). Genz (2003:185–88) has expressed reservations about the conclusions of Voigt and Henrickson. 1.3. During the Middle Phrygian period, the street would have linked the “Outer Town” at the north to the “Lower Town” at the south, but there is no evidence for Early Phrygian occupation in either area. Early Phrygian levels were uncovered on the Western Mound in only one small sondage, so the nature of the settlement there is still very uncertain (Voigt and Young 1999:209). 1.4. Three rows of pithoi were found in this wing at the time of excavation (Young 1956:260). For the orthostats, see Sams 1989; Orthmann 1971:31–33, 61–62, 220–21; Prayon 1987:48–52. 1.5. The floor does not survive in Megaron 10, but all of the surrounding megarons had pebble floors, and this\n\n18\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\none would undoubtedly have followed suit. The floor in Megaron 9 featured red, white, yellow, and blue pebbles, so we should probably reconstruct a geometric design along the same lines as the one in Megaron 2, to which Megaron 9 was oriented. 1.6. In one of the CC (Clay-Cut) Terrace Building units, sifted barley lay on the floor, probably intended for beer production (DeVries 1990:386). The number of sheep bones in Early Phrygian levels represents an increase over those in Early Iron Age strata (Zeder and Arter 1994:113–14), but this is probably related more to meat consumption than wool production. 1.7. Although no images of rulers have been unearthed at the site, there are two objects retrieved from the destruction level that probably indicate how members of the Phrygian cavalry would have looked (Young 1960a:240; DeVries 1980a:47, figs. 7, 8). These include a wooden frieze with three warriors mounted on horses, probably part of a piece of furniture, as well as an ivory plaque of a single equestrian. 1.8. The distinctively Phrygian bronze belt worn by King Warpalawas in the İvriz relief may have been a gift from Midas (Mellink 1992:638), while the bronze situlae from Tumulus MM may have been offered to Midas’ predecessor by the ruler of a region under Assyrian control (Young 1981:268). Hundreds of ivory plaques, some of which are very likely to have been gifts, were found in the palace at Samaria (Crowfoot and Crowfoot 1938), and Hiram I, king of Tyre, sent cedar trees to Solomon when he was building the Temple in Jerusalem (1 Kings 5:10). 1.9. I thank Ben Marsh and Mary Voigt for guidance regarding these estimates. 1.10. In the former article he mentions the discovery in Megaron 3 of 19 pits of cornelian cherries, a summer fruit that had apparently been consumed shortly before the fire. The buildings on the northeast side of the elite quarter were not burned, and the wind generally comes in from a northern direction, at least during the summer. The fire may therefore have started in the Inner Court and then moved with the wind in a western and southern direction toward the gate. 1.11. Only two cattle skeletons were found in the destruction level, in Building CC3, and they appear to have been slaughtered before the fire (DeVries 1990:386). 1.12. The fills in Megaron 4 were disturbed, and the building had clearly been searched for valuables after the fire (Young 1964:287).\n\n1.13. The quarry sources changed completely between the Early and Middle Phrygian periods. Ryelite, a light igneous rock, was used for the upper part of the Early Phrygian Gate, presumably because it is lighter and would have been more suitable for an area of occasional seismic activity. There is no ryelite in Middle Phrygian architecture, although gypsum and andesite are used for the first time. I owe these observations to Frank Matero. The stone sources for Phrygian architecture were examined by William McClain in 1992, who determined that the volcanic and sedimentary stones came from Duatepe and Çile Dağ, respectively (Sams 1992:472–73). 1.14. This suggestion was proposed by Mary Voigt. The Early Phrygian architecture on the citadel was filled with color: the area between the gate complex and the “Post and Poros Building” was paved with red and white stones set in a checkerboard pattern (Sams and Voigt 1995:373); the Polychrome House featured walls of bright red and blue stone (Young 1956:260); and the first Early Phrygian circuit wall, which was connected to the Polychrome House, contained courses of white, red, and yellow (Young 1964:291). The wings of the gate were stuccoed but apparently unpainted (Young 1956:258). 1.15. The existence of the ditch is based on magnetic prospection conducted at the site in 2007 (Sams 2009). 1.16. The crescent shape of Küçük Höyük is the result of a Persian siege mound set up against the fort. 1.17. For advice on the Syrian and Palestinian examples, I thank J.P. Dessel and Jodi Magness. 1.18. This is not far from the reasoning proposed by G. Roger Edwards (1959:264), although he suggested an early 7th century construction date for the fortifications based on the generally accepted date of ca. 700 for the destruction level. 1.19. Mary Voigt’s excavations had already demonstrated an increase in building activity during the Middle Phrygian period (Voigt et al. 1997; Voigt and Young 1999). With the magnetic prospection results attesting to the actual size of the outer fortifications, our estimate of the extent of that activity needs to be increased again. 1.20. Mellink’s excavations revealed that there were several phases of construction in the Küçük Höyük area (Mellink 1959). 1.21. For the Classical sources, see Strabo 1.3.21; Aristotle Politics 1.3.16; Eusebius Chronicle 696 BC. 1.22. Herodotos 1.14 (ivory throne); Aristotle 611.37 (Rose); Pollux 9.83. 1.23. The historical sources for these events are conve-\n\nIntroduction: The Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion\n\nniently summarized in Mellink 1992. 1.24. For possible royal gift exchange during the reign of Midas, see supra, note 1.8. 1.25. The Bayındır tumulus in Lycia contained a burial that included objects in Phrygian style, and this too was probably set up during the period when Midas ruled Gordion. For the contents, see Özgen and Öztürk 1996:27; for Bayındır, DeVries 2008:42–43. 1.26. For an overview of these statues, see Draycott and Summers 2008:17–21. Rulers regularly appeared in relief format in Near Eastern iconography, but the tradition of colossal statues in the round seems unique to the Upper Euphrates region, especially between the 9th and 7th centuries BC. The one example found thus far on the Anatolian plateau is at Kerkenes, dating to the early 6th century BC (Draycott and Summers 2008). 1.27. A full presentation of the evidence for the link between Tumulus W and the Early Phrygian Gate will appear in Liebhart et al. n.d. 1.28. Without additional evidence from the area linking the attack specifically to the Kimmerians, however, one can only speculate. 1.29. A puppy burial found in a late Middle Phrygian context on the Western Mound probably also indicates Lydian influence (Sams and Voigt 2004:196). For the tradition in Lydia, see Greenewalt 1978. 1.30. The polychromatic figural and geometric architectural terracottas from Pazarlı, near Çorum, constitute another example of continued Phrygian influence in the 6th century (Koşay 1941). 1.31. This included, in addition to the examples cited above, Building M (Edwards 1959:265); Building E\n\n19\n\n(Young 1955:5), which featured a hearth constructed of well-cut red stone; Building X (Young 1955:5; DeVries 1990:396); and the “Yellow House” (Edwards 1959:266–67). 1.32. This building, generally referred to as “the Painted House,” dates ca. 500–490 BC. The style of the paintings is similar in several respects to the frieze on the Polyxena sarcophagus from the Troad (Sevinç 1996). 1.33. Hellenica Oxyrhynchia 1.4; 21.6; Young (1955:6; 1962a:154) thought that the earthquake dated to the mid 5th century; DeVries (1990:400) to ca. 400. Building X (DeVries 1990:396) contained a bridle with ivory and bronze strips, similar to those from Persepolis. It therefore looks as if this structure functioned in part as a storage site for horse gear. For Agesilaos, see Bruce 1967:141–42. 1.34. A hoard of sigloi with a date range of 420–375 BC was almost certainly concealed at the time of the attack (DeVries 1990:400). 1.35. This was true also for the Lower Town, 500–480 BC (Voigt and Young 1999:214). 1.36. Access to the inner court was limited by a new wall set up near (but not blocking) the entrance pylon, ca. 475–450 BC (Edwards 1959:266). 1.37. Arrian (Anabasis 2.3) locates the cart and its knot in the Temple of Zeus at the time of Alexander’s arrival at the site, but there is no evidence that temples per se existed at Gordion, other than (possibly) Megaron 2 during the Early Phrygian period (Mellink 1983). 1.38.

Pizzorno and Gareth Darbyshire Introduction\n\nS\n\nix decades of archaeological investigation at Gor­ dion have provided a wealth of information about ancient Anatolia, in particular regarding the Early and Middle Phrygian periods. However, with the ambitious scale of the project have come major challenges, chief among which is the recording of the spatial layout of the excavated remains: the mapping of Gordion. The lack of accurate spatial representations of the site has consistently hindered the analysis and publication of the excavated material. A complete site map combining all excavated data was never produced, and little of the ancient architecture could be precisely located in a site-wide coordinate system. The seriousness of this situation is difficult to overestimate. Most of the records for the excavation trenches and their assemblages were ultimately linked to architectural features, many of which no longer survive. Consequently, the key data could not be located spatially with acceptable accuracy, either in absolute terms or relative to each other. The existence of specific problems associated with the mapping had long been known, and indeed some of the surveyors responsible for the maps and plans attempted remedies over the years, but no definitive solutions were ever found. The situation reached a critical juncture in 2007, when two new initiatives required the accurate spatial referencing of Gordion’s data. Brian Rose had just became co-director of the project and suggested that a phase plan of the Citadel Mound would improve the comprehension and presentation of the excavated remains. At the same time, the authors commenced the Digital Gordion project, the goal of which is to improve the accessibility and analysis of the Gordion\n\nmaterials through the digitization of the archived records and the creation of an online research environment (Darbyshire and Pizzorno 2009b). It rapidly became clear that this new research environment would require an accurate spatial referencing component in order to fully integrate all the data. The present chapter documents our research into the history of mapping at Gordion, outlines our understanding of the problems, and presents the strategy we have developed for rectifying the situation. If at times our evaluation of past work seems less than kind, it is only because a frank and in-depth investigation into the problems, their magnitude, and their root causes is an inescapable first step toward finding the best solution. To illustrate the potential of our approach, we include a provisional phase plan of the key architectural units excavated on the Citadel Mound from the Early, Middle, and Late Phrygian periods— the first such plan ever produced for the site (foldout in back pocket). We also include a new site map, customized to show the features relevant to our discussion (Fig. 2.1, see color insert). These are examples of the kind of select cartography that we can now generate from the Digital Gordion geo-spatial dataset.\n\nApproaching the Problem Earlier attempts to comprehend and resolve the mapping problems at Gordion were too narrowly focused and consequently failed to recognize their underlying causes. The few solutions that were formulated only addressed immediate concerns, without ever confronting the core set of problems that had created the situation in the first place. One of\n\n24\n\nThe Archaeology of Phrygian Gordion, Royal City of Midas\n\nthe greatest shortcomings of these earlier attempts was the restriction of their analytical scope solely to the maps and plans themselves. That is to say, the problems with the mapping were approached in a cartographic manner, focusing on the measuring and drawing of the plans but largely ignoring their content. In contrast, we have taken a holistic approach, one that, in addition to the cartographic aspects of the matter, also focuses on the content of the plans and the social milieu in which they were produced. Thus, while technical considerations remain a key component of our strategy, we have also taken into account other types of information: the archaeological evidence itself (structures, deposits, and artifacts); the site’s topography; the operational context of the excavations (aims and methodology, personnel, organization, logistics, and scheduling); and technological details (the type, condition, and capabilities of the equipment used). Our preliminary survey of the Gordion Archive for pertinent records included more than 2,000 maps and plans, together with ancillary materials such as excavation notebooks, surveyors’ reports, and aerial and satellite imagery. Tracing and evaluating the development of mapping at Gordion over the course of 60 years is no easy task, in part because the project has outlived a number of those involved, but also because clear policies for documenting the survey work were never established. Where records exist, they are of uneven quality and scope, and the paucity of documentation means that our interpretations and working hypotheses inevitably carry some degree of speculation. Nevertheless, there is much to be learned from a series of short reports written by the surveyors themselves, and from the surveyors’ logs that survive.1 These, coupled with the maps, plans, and other documents (publications, notes, sketches, and correspondence), have allowed us to piece together a comprehensive history of mapping at Gordion.\n\nChronology of the Surveys and Mapping The earliest archaeological excavations at Gordion were carried out in a single season by Gustav and Alfred Körte in 1900. Their published report\n\nincludes a site map that is the first cartographic representation of Gordion’s archaeology. The map presents key geographical features and trench locations, but only one of the trenches has a detailed plan in the publication (Körte and Körte 1904). Following a hiatus of 50 years, archaeological investigations resumed in 1950 under the ægis of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology (henceforth Penn Museum). The first excavation series, and the most extensive in terms of the area investigated, was directed by Rodney S. Young between 1950 and 1973.2 Over 1,500 maps and plans were produced to document the results of the 17 seasons of digging. The year 1974 saw only a limited survey season, directed by Keith DeVries. That autumn, Young was killed in a car accident and major excavations did not resume until 1988. In the intervening period, under the direction of DeVries and G. Kenneth Sams, work focused on the analysis of excavated material, particularly the tens of thousands of artifacts, and to a much smaller degree on the evaluation and conservation of excavated architecture (DeVries 1986, 1987a, 1988a). Surveying was only carried out in 1979 and 1980, as part of the architectural conservation program, and in 1987 in preparation for a renewed series of excavations. Penn’s second excavation series began in 1988, with Mary M. Voigt as field director, and lasted until 2006.3 These excavations were much less extensive than Young’s, but the recovery and recording of evidence was more detailed, and hundreds of maps and plans were generated. These years also witnessed a number of excavations and surveys carried out on behalf of Turkey’s General Directorate for Cultural Properties and Museums. The Museum of Anatolian Civilizations, Ankara, excavated Mamaderesi Tumulus in 1988, under the direction of Melih Arslan, in cooperation with the Gordion Project (Arslan 1989, Temizsoy 1992, 1993, 1994), and in 1989 Tahsin Saatçi investigated the three Kızlarkayası tumuli (Saatçi and Kopar 1990, 1991). That same year, a general evaluation survey of Gordion’s tumuli was conducted and the results plotted on the standard 1:5,000 Turkish cartographic series and on an unprojected schematic map (unpublished). Three more tumuli were dug by Remzi Yağcı in 1990 (Yağcı 1992). With the exception of thirteen small inspec-\n\n25\n\nFig. 2.2.

As well as the excavations, other activities have generated spatial data. In 1987 and 1988 William Sumner conducted a survey of other sites in the area (the initial phase of the Gordion Regional Survey Project). The following year, a series of aerial photographs of the Citadel Mound and the Lower Town was taken by Wilson and Eleanor Myers using a balloon. In 1992 Andrew Goldman and Keith Dickey directed an intensive survey of the Outer Town, continued for another season by Goldman alone in 1995 (unpublished). A geomorphological study of Gordion and its environs was conducted by Ben Marsh between 1992 and 1995, and expanded for the Gordion Regional Survey Project directed by Lisa Kealhofer between 1996 and 2002 (Kealhofer 2005). Marsh’s ongoing work has produced a number of important geomorphological and archaeological maps (Marsh 1997, 1999, 2005, and this volume). Another significant development has been the resumption, in 2007, of geophysical survey (unpublished geophysical investigations at Gordion had been conducted by E.K. Ralph in 1965). Ongoing work by Stefan Giese and Christian Hübner, of GGH GbR, has focused on the Citadel Mound, parts of the Lower and Outer Town zones, and on several of the tumuli. A second geophysics team, directed by Compton James Tucker and Joseph Nigro of the Goddard Space Flight Center, NASA, began work in 2009, focusing on the cemetery areas (Sams 2009:139–41; 2010:289–91; 2011a:462–64). In 2008 a new survey of Middle Phrygian architecture on the Citadel Mound was initiated by Ömür Harmanşah of Brown University, and that same year a Penn team directed by Gabriel H. Pizzorno and William R. Fitts was on-site to resurvey as many extant fixed points as could be found. Most recently, in 2010, Gareth Darbyshire and John Hinchman carried out a new balloon aerial photographic survey of the Citadel Mound, Lower Town, and Northeast Ridge cemetery area. In addition, a differential Global Positioning System (dGPS) survey of the same areas, totalling more than 1,500 control points and including all extant visible architecture, was conducted by Darbyshire and Philip Sapirstein.\n\nMapping Gordion The map produced by the Körte expedition of 1900 shows the contemporary relief, hydrology, vegetation, settlement, and transportation network, as well as the archaeological topography, trench locations, and elevations of selected points (Fig. 2.2). Although in many ways inaccurate, it constitutes a useful reference source for the late Ottoman landscape. Given the limitations of the Körte map and the absence of anything else that could be used, new cartography was essential at the beginning of the Penn project, and a number of basic site maps had to be produced during the first season.\n\nTroubled Beginnings In 1950, mapping work at Gordion was carried out by Mahmut Akok, an established Turkish archaeologist and illustrator; Edward B. Reed, a student from Princeton University; and Zihni Azım, who, like Akok, was an illustrator in Ankara. Although there are no accounts detailing the survey work that season, we have managed to reconstruct the essential sequence of events through a careful examination of the maps and plans that were produced (both draft and final versions), and the field notebooks and published reports (Young 1950, 1951). Akok, who was the senior surveyor, spent only two weeks on-site collecting data (Young 1951:4), and produced three maps (the areas covered by these are indicated in Fig. 2.1). The first two, at a"
