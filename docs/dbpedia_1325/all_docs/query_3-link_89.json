        "text": "2023-24 stats: 30.4 ppg, 11.5 rpg, 6.5 apg, 1.2 spg, 1.1 bpg, 61.1 FG%, 27.4 3P% in 73 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 7 ($45,640,084)\n\nThe best two-way player in the NBA, Giannis Antetokounmpo remains an absolute force on offense and defense, a player who combines his freakish physical attributes with all-out effort every time he plays, even after winning a championship and having two MVP awards on his mantle at home.\n\nThe Greek Freak, a Top 3 finisher in VORP, BPM, WS/48 and Global Rating in 2023-24, remains as dominant as ever, finishing fourth in the MVP vote this year after leading the Milwaukee Bucks to a 49-33 regular season. An ill-timed injury late in the regular season ended Antetokounmpo’s campaign, and he wasn’t able to return to help prevent Milwaukee from losing in the first round of the playoffs, but when he was out there, he showed no signs whatsoever of slippage in performance or impact.\n\n2023-24 stats: 24.9 ppg, 12.8 rpg, 3.5 apg, 2.3 bpg, 1.1 spg, 56.1 FG%, 25.9 3P% in 81 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 15 ($40,600,080)\n\nFor the first time in 2023-24, there was a legitimate debate as to whether or not LeBron James was the best player on his own team. That’s how excellent Anthony Davis was on the campaign, which was the healthiest run of his career.\n\nDavis played in 76 games on the year, setting a career-high mark in that regard while putting up over 24 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks nightly, earning All-Star honors but missing out on All-NBA, a questionable snub. He ranked Top 10 in VORP and WS/48 and ninth overall in Global Rating on the year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers did fail to get out of the first round of the postseason but it’s hard to fail Davis for that, as LA. drew the Nuggets, the reigning champions at the time who have had the Lakers’ number of late, to open the playoffs. Plus, Davis was excellent in his five 2023-24 postseason games, averaging 27.8 points, 15.6 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.6 blocks on 63.4 percent shooting from the floor, elite marks that helped prove Davis remains a Top 10 player in the game today.\n\n2023-24 stats: 21.7 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 4.2 apg, 0.8 spg, 0.3 bpg, 53.7 FG%, 33.8 3P% in 97 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 20 ($37,893,408)\n\nMid-season trades rarely result in big impacts on teams making deep playoff runs that same year, but the Indiana Pacers’ Pascal Siakam pickup was an exception. One of the top NBA performers of the past five years even though not considered a star by many, Siakam was fantastic once again in 2023-24, including in the playoffs, where he helped lead Indiana to the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nSiakam only missed two games in the regular season, and they say availability is the best ability, right?\n\nA whirlwind of energy, size, length and skill, the Cameroonian forward further ensured himself a payday this summer as he’ll be an unrestricted free agent, one set to undoubtedly sign a max contract.\n\n2023-24 stats: 22.9 ppg, 7.1 rpg, 5.3 apg, 0.9 spg, 0.6 bpg, 45.5 FG%, 34.5 3P% in 87 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 138 ($11,608,080)\n\nAfter three seasons of futility, former No. 1 overall pick Paolo Banchero put the Orlando Magic back on the right path in 2023-24, leading the team to the playoffs with a 47-35 record and came just one game short of reaching the second round of the postseason.\n\nBanchero is an absolutely bruising forward with the size of a 4 but the quickness and skill of a 3, who can use his strength to get to the basket but also has counter moves in the form of turnarounds and fadeaways that make him a true load to defend. He’s also a good playmaker and a versatile defender, showing All-NBA-type upside as a 21-year-old, especially as his three-point shot continues to improve.\n\nThe first-time All-Star has a very bright future and should have the Magic in the playoff picture for years to come.\n\n2023-24 stats: 22.9 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 5.0 apg, 1.1 spg, 0.7 bpg, 57.0 FG%, 33.3 3P% in 70 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 29 ($34,005,250)\n\nPlaying a career-high 70 games while looking as trim as we’ve seen him since college, former No. 1 pick Zion Williamson had a very good season even despite not earning any accolades for 2023-24.\n\nUnfortunately, that did not carry over to the playoffs, as Williamson got injured while having arguably the best big-stage performance of his career against the Lakers in the Play-In Game when he had 40 points on 17-of-27 shooting, 11 rebounds and five assists in a tied game before going down.\n\nIf Williamson can carry over that level of form in 2024-25, he’ll surely skyrocket up this ranking next season. As is and for what it’s worth, the advanced stats were quite high on the former Duke Blue Devil’s 2023-24, as Williamson ranked in roughly the Top 25 in BPM, VORP and WS/48 this past campaign.\n\nHere’s hoping for more health in Williamson’s future, as the explosive uber-strong wing is one of the most exciting players to watch in the league when he’s out there.\n\n2023-24 stats: 21.2 ppg, 8.4 rpg, 3.0 apg, 0.7 spg, 0.6 bpg, 49.6 FG%, 40.5 3P% in 78 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 24 ($36,016,200)\n\nWithout question, Karl-Anthony Towns is one of the best bigs in the NBA today. Even so, 2023-24 was a tricky season for him, as he did miss a lot of time due to injury. Then, in the playoffs, he had some high moments but also some lows, at times getting benched late in games in favor of fellow floor-spacing big man Naz Reid.\n\nOver Towns’ final seven playoff games this season, he had a brutal stretch of shooting, hitting just 20.9 percent of his threes, and if we remove one four-for-five-shooting evening from that stretch, that number becomes 13.2 percent, coinciding with the Wolves going 3-4 in that time frame and getting knocked out of the playoffs by Dallas.\n\nWhat’s more, Minnesota also was 12.7 points per 100 possessions worse during his time on the floor in the postseason. Gobert, as we mentioned in his slide, was roughly a plus-16 over that same stretch.\n\nLike it or not, that tough showing at times in the playoffs plus how much success the team had without him in the regular season (and the fact Reid can fill in what he does at a fraction of the cost, contract-wise) will lead to many questions about Towns’ future with the team this summer.\n\n2023-24 stats: 13.9 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 3.7 apg, 0.8 spg, 0.6 bpg, 56.0 FG%, 30.9 3P% in 85 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 67 ($22,266,182)\n\nDenver’s versatile complementary weapon Aaron Gordon had some standout performances this postseason even if it wasn’t enough for the Nuggets to repeat. Regardless, Denver more than likely wouldn’t have taken home the 2023 championship without Gordon’s contributions, as he’s been an excellent role player for the team since getting there back in mid-2020-21.\n\nGordon is an inconsistent outside shooter but he’s got a solid midrange game and is a very good offensive rebounder and put-back player when opponents have a smaller defender on him. As a slasher, few are as explosive as Gordon and considering the level of passer Jokic is, that play type is hugely productive and important for the Nuggets.\n\nHis defense is what is most impactful, however, as Gordon can defend multiple positions – from guard to big – at a very high level, allowing the Nuggets to mask the point-stopping deficiencies of Murray and Jokic to the point Denver had a Top 10 defense this season.\n\n2023-24 stats: 23.2 ppg, 8.2 rpg, 2.0 apg, 0.9 spg, 0.5 bpg, 48.0 FG%, 39.9 3P% in 55 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 95 ($17,259,999)\n\nUtah Jazz big man Lauri Markkanen wasn’t able to quite match his excellent 2022-23 season in which he earned All-Star and Most Improved Player honors but the fact he was at least able to somewhat repeat his statistical output from the year prior indicates it wasn’t a fluke.\n\nMarkkanen is a very smooth scoring forward/big hybrid who can space the floor from three, and can hit tough shots over good defense thanks to his size, skill and body control. Markkanen isn’t much of a passer or a super impactful defender but he’s certainly one of the better young floor-spacing 4s in basketball.\n\n2023-24 stats: 24.0 ppg, 9.2 rpg, 5.0 apg, 0.5 spg, 0.3 bpg, 47.2 FG%, 31.1 3P% in 46 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 48 ($28,226,880)\n\nPower forward Julius Randle would be far higher in this ranking if not for the injury that ended his season early. It’s easy to wonder if the Knicks’ playoff run might have turned out differently with a healthy Randle in the mix considering his All-Star-level play in 2023-24 before going down.\n\nInterestingly enough, Randle might have one of the most perfectly appropriate salaries in the league based on the fact he was the preseason No. 48 player according to our overall aggregate ranking while also placing 48th overall in salary for 2023-24.\n\nThe athletic lefty power forward can space the floor, is an elite driver for a big man and is an underrated playmaker, so here’s hoping he returns to form next season because his energy and productivity make him a great fit for this Knicks squad.\n\n2023-24 stats: 15.8 ppg, 9.3 rpg, 3.0 apg, 1.6 bpg, 0.9 spg, 57.4 FG%, 35.1 3P% in 62 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 178 ($8,882,640)\n\nPossessing huge potential thanks to his elite size, length and skills for a big man, we’re all still waiting for Cavaliers forward Evan Mobley to take the next step and start to at least approach his All-Star ceiling. We’ve seen glimpses of it here and there but overall, more was expected out of the former USC standout at this point, as Mobley arguably is the same level of player today that he was as a rookie.\n\nMaybe that’ll come with improved strength or a more reliable outside jumper but there’s no doubt Mobley has more in him than being a stagnant 15-point-per-game player. The fact he only played 50 regular-season games this year due to injury also didn’t help his place in this ranking.\n\nNonetheless, Mobley is still just 22 (very soon to turn 23) so there’s still hope he’ll be able to hit that next level; it’s just getting to be time, heading into his fourth season next year, when we’ll have to see him be an All-Star to believe he has that in him.\n\n2023-24 stats: 22.2 ppg, 6.6 rpg, 4.2 apg, 0.7 bpg, 0.5 spg, 46.3 FG%, 33.6 3P% in 70 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 55 ($25,568,182)\n\nWashington Wizards power forward Kyle Kuzma is a versatile offensive weapon who can space the floor from three, hit shots off the dribble, create for others, handle the ball and overall get buckets from the 4-spot.\n\nHis problem is that his defense, which you’d think would be a plus considering how versatile and quick he is for a frontcourt player, is not very impactful and he can be a bit of a shot-chucker with the ball in his hands.\n\nKuzma has already proven he can be a good role player on a championship-level team from his 2019-20 run with the Lakers so maybe as Washington picks up more talent, the 28-year-old will better be able to showcase his impact on winning.\n\n2023-24 stats: 22.5 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 2.3 apg, 1.6 bpg, 1.2 spg, 44.4 FG%, 32.0 3P% in 66 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 51 ($27,102,202)\n\nA player who saw his stock fall in 2023-24 was Grizzlies big man Jaren Jackson Jr., who came into the year with high expectations coming off a strong 2022-23 both for him individually and for his team, even ranking 30th overall in our preseason aggregate ranking.\n\nHowever, injuries to Jackson and the fact superstar lead guard Ja Morant missed basically the entire season led to a stepback of a campaign for Jackson and the Grizzlies at large.\n\nWe fully expect a bounce-back year for Jackson in 2024-25, as he’s an extremely impactful defender (he’s the 2022-23 Defensive Player of the Year, after all) thanks to his great length and lateral quickness, and a good offensive player behind his floor-spacing, ball-handling prowess.\n\nHe just needs to toughen up on the glass and improve his willingness to share the ball.\n\n2023-24 stats: 16.6 ppg, 6.5 rpg, 3.0 apg, 0.9 spg, 0.6 bpg, 48.4 FG%, 35.1 3P% in 76 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 19 ($39,270,150)\n\nAlthough his days of getting paid like a Top 20 player are certainly over, Sixers’ Tobias Harris is a solid player overall, a 4 with some of the skills of a 3, quick feet and toughness on defense and floor-spacing, ball-handling chops on offense.\n\nHe’s just not the type of player who will step up and produce more when a star on his team is out; Harris just sort of is who he is on a nightly basis. And that’s an above-average starter, a very solid modern-day big man with versatility on both ends of the floor.\n\n2023-24 stats: 21.0 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.8 apg, 0.8 spg, 0.6 bpg, 45.1 FG%, 40.2 3P% in 54 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 49 ($27,586,207)\n\nMissed time and the Blazers’ porous record caused Jerami Grant to fall down this ranking when his actual numbers were decent enough, particularly with regard to his scoring efficiency.\n\nGrant is a versatile forward who can play the 4 in most lineups while providing floor spacing, and who is a solid one-on-one scorer, a trait he has developed as his career has progressed. He can also defend a litany of other positions on the other end at a respectable level, as well as get some buckets as a slasher.\n\nIf Grant is your best player, your team more than likey won’t be very good, but as a complementary piece on a contender, he could be having an Aaron Gordon-type of impact.\n\n2023-24 stats: 15.2 ppg, 5.5 rpg, 1.7 apg, 1.0 spg, 0.8 bpg, 45.4 FG%, 35.8 3P% in 77 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 183 ($8,409,000)\n\nAn up-and-down shooting season prevented Keegan Murray from taking the next step this year when many thought he was a lock to take a leap in 2023-24.\n\nMurray did up his scoring average by roughly three points but the fact his three-point percentage dipped from 41.1 percent to 35.8 percent was somewhat concerning. At the same time, if Murray was still able to improve his overall scoring while seeing his three-point percentage drop, shouldn’t that give hope that a big third-season leap is ahead for the soon-to-be 24-year-old if he gets his three-point shooting back to his rookie rate?\n\nRegardless, Murray is a smooth swingman with a pretty shooting stroke who can also get some buckets from the midrange off the dribble, and we still think highly of his future.\n\n2023-24 stats: 12.9 ppg, 5.9 rpg, 1.8 apg, 0.9 spg, 0.8 bpg, 43.4 FG%, 32.7 3P% in 95 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 100 ($16,847,826)\n\nAn important part of Dallas’ march to the Finals in 2023-24 despite his mundane averages, it’s fair to say if the Mavericks didn’t trade for PJ Washington and his frontcourt mate, coming up in just a few spots on this list, they probably don’t make it to the championship series this year.\n\nWashington’s athleticism out of the frontcourt was hugely important for Dallas, as his ability to finish lobs created easy baskets for the Mavericks in the playoffs. Washington meshed quite well with Doncic and Irving on that front.\n\nThe former Kentucky standout was also able to space the floor from three for Dallas, giving it a solid role player to place alongside its two star guards, with the right level of athleticism to help mask the team’s previous defensive deficiencies.\n\n2023-24 stats: 13.7 ppg, 8.1 rpg, 1.6 apg, 0.7 spg, 08 bpg, 45.4 FG%, 36.3 3P% in 76 games\n\nSalary ranking: No. 170 ($9,326,520)\n\nFormer No. 3 overall pick Jabari Smith didn’t make a huge jump in the 2023-24 season after a just-decent rookie year, at least not if you only look at the regular counting stats. But it was promising to see his advanced stats take a solid leap (-1.1 VORP to 1.0, -3.7 BPM to -0.4 and .037 WS/48 to .111), along with his three-point percentage (30.7 percent accuracy from deep 36.3 percent).\n\nSo the future remains bright for the 21-year-old Auburn product, who has elite defensive potential and a skillful offensive game, one that should allow him to space the floor, drive it, block shots and defend on switches for the Rockets."
