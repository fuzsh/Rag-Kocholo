JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM VOLUME 62 JANUARY 1981 NuMBER | WOOD ANATOMY OF THE NEW WORLD PITHECELLOBIUM (SENSU LATO)! DANIEL L. CASSENS AND REGIS B. MILLER THE New Wor pb ee Martius s.l. consists of over 150 species of shrub- to tree-size plants. These species are mostly plants of tropical areas, ranging throughout eee and South America and the West Indies. In addition, Ebenopsis Britton & Rose and some species of Havardia Small occur in Texas and Mexico, and the range of a few species of Pithecellobium sensu stricto extends into southern Florida. The habitat of Pithecellobium s.l. is generally dry to mesic, but some species of Zygia P. Browne grow in or near water. Few specific uses of the wood are reported. However, some species of Abarema Pittier, Arthrosamanea Britton & Killip, Cojoba Britton & Rose, Marmaroxylon Killip, and Samanea Merr. reach tree size and are used locally. Occasionally these woods appear in foreign markets, where they may have commercial potential. Pithecellobium s.l. is a mimosoid legume in the tribe Ingeae, which is characterized by Mohlenbrock (1963a) as follows: Calyx and corolla generally 5-lobed, cupular or tubular. Stamens numerous, indefinite, connate for a portion of their length. Ovary generally unicarpellate, but carpels varying from 1 to 15 per flower. Leaves usually bipinnate, once-pinnate in a few species; glands pe qucnil present along winged or unwinged rachis; stipular spines sometimes present. Fruit or legume flat, terete, or moniliform; coria- ceous, ligneous, fleshy, or papery; dehiscent, elastically dehiscent, or inde- S diverse and described it as compressed; coriaceous, hard, or subfleshy; arcuate, circinnate, or rarely suberect; and indehiscent or dehiscent. The valves after 'The a for this paper was conducted at the U. S. Forest Products Laboratory, Madison, Wisconsin, in partial fulfillment of Cassens’s requirements for the D degree i the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It is submitted as Journal Paper No. 7752, Purdue University Agricultural Experiment Station, West Lafayette, Indiana. Journal of the Arnold Arboretum 62: 1-44. January, 1981. 2 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 dehiscence are often twisted, but not elastic. Bentham relied heavily on this diversity of the legume to characterize his sections and series. Later taxono- mists used the manner of legume dehiscence, the presence or absence of spines and arils, and leaf characters to distinguish segregate genera of Pithecellobium s.1. The splitting of the New World Pithecellobium s.]. began with the formation of Havardia and Siderocarpos by Small (1901). Merrill (1916) described Samanea, Fawcett and Rendle (1920) revived Zygia, and Pittier (1927) described Abarema. Britton and Rose (1928) described Chloroleucon, Cojoba, Ebenopsis (= Siderocarpos), Jupunba, Painteria, and Punjuba as new genera and also recognized Havardia, Samanea, and Zygia. Pseudosamanea was described by Harms (1930), and later Briton and Killip (1936) described Klugiodendron and Arthrosamanea. In t me publication Britton and Rose founde Macrosamanea. Finally, Killip a Marmaroxylon (Record, 1940). More recent taxonomic publications (Burkart, 1949; Dugand, 1948, 1966; Hutchinson, 1964; Kleinhoonte, 1940; Mohlenbrock, 1963a, 1963b) continue to recognize at least some segregates of Pithecellobium. Other publications (Irwin, 1966; Macbride, 1943; Cowan, 1961; Standley & Record, 1936; Standley & Steyermark, 1946; Woodson & Schery, 1950), however, indicate that Pithecellobium should not be divided into segregate genera. Kostermans (1954) completed a monograph of the Asiatic, Malaysian, Australian, and Pacific species of Mimosaceae formerly included in Pithecello- bium. Newly described genera include Morolobium Kosterm. (one species), Parasamanea Kosterm. (one species), Serialbizzia Kosterm. (two species), Parenterolobium Kosterm. (one species), Cylindrokelupka Kosterm. (three species), and Paralbizzia Kosterm. (three species). Kostermans reinstated Cathormion Hassk. (one species) and recognized Zygia (four species), Painteria (one species), and A barema (44 species). Maintaining Pithecellobium as one large genus or reducing it to several smaller ones continues to be the basis for considerable disagreement among taxonomists. Therefore, it was concluded that an investigation of the secondary xylem might provide additional information for developing a more acceptable classification system. Classical diagnostic features of the secondary xylem were examined to determine whether certain species form distinct groups. Observations of the secondary xylem can help determine the validity of a genus, and in complicated situations it can provide evidence for supporting or negating morphological findings. Thus, each of the groups recognized was compared with the proposed generic segregates. It was reasoned that if the groups and the generic segregates correspond, the secondary xylem provided evidence for the formation of distinct taxa within the Pithecellobium complex. However, if the secondary xylem is homogeneous, or the groups and the generic segregates do not correspond, the evidence would suggest maintaining Pithecellobium in a broad sense. In addition, the relationships and specialization levels of different tissues are described and discussed. A practical benefit derived from an investigation of the secondary xylem is based on the macroscopic and microscopic characters that are key aids in the identification of unknown wood specimens. 1981] CASSENS & MILLER, PITHECELLOBIUM 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS TABLE | lists the 266 wood specimens of 83 species examined from the Pithecellobium complex. All of the wood specimens included here have erbarium vouchers. Additional specimens and species without vouchers are included by Cassens (1973) In all cases this investigation is based on the secondary xylem; hence, the use of such terms as ‘‘Abarema wood-type.’’ The name Abarema may also be used in another sense; that is, as a particular genus segregated from Pithecellobium. The placement of a species with a different generic name into a particular wood type does not imply a taxonomic transfer of the epithet into that segregate genus. However, it does indicate the anatomical similarities of all species included in that wood type Standard methods were used in the preparation and examination of all microscope slides. However, some measurements need further explanation. For example, length measurements were taken for 25 vessel elements and 25 fibers. An average pore diameter was obtained by measuring 25 of the larger pores and then averaging the 10 largest. A numerical distribution of pores was determined from counts in 10 fields that covered a total of 8.48 width and height were calculated by cell count and micrometer the height in micrometers and number of cells was calculated by measuring 25 of the higher rays and then averaging the 10 highest. Rays higher than 20 cells were only measured in micrometers. For the wood descriptions, an average of all the specimens was calculated. For example, if the grand average was 900 and the lowest and highest specimen averages were 800 and 1000, respectively, then the figures are reported in the anatomical descriptions in the form ‘*800(-900)-1000.’’ The standard size classes for pore diameter and distribution, vessel element and fiber length, and intervascular pits are reported according to the definitions of the Committee on the Standardization of Terms of Cell Size (1937, 1939), Chattaway (1932), and Record and Chattaway (1939). For each specimen the occurrence of amorphous inclusions, crystals, and natural saponins is reported. The crystal type, shape, and arrangement within the particular cell type was observed. When crystals were surrounded by a sheath that did not disintegrate when treated with Jeffrey’s maceration solution or hydrofluoric acid, they are termed ‘‘integumented.”’ o test for the presence or absence of natural saponins, small chips of heartwood were placed in a vial and covered with distilled water. The vial was shaken by hand for several seconds. If very little or no froth appeared, the test was considered negative. If froth appeared and then disappeared in a few seconds, the test was ‘‘short positive.’ If abundant froth appeared and remained, the test was positive. The fluorescence of dry heartwood is a character used for identification purposes. A freshly exposed wood surface was placed under a long-wave TABLE 1. Wood specimens examined for each wood type.

ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTIONS TABLE 2 summarizes the important anatomical characters for each wood type, and Ficures 1-8 illustrate typical anatomical characteristics of the Pithecellobium complex. Complete descriptions of the individual wood types are given below. TaBLe 3 lists the physical characters that are often of value in wood identification. The different heartwood colors referred to in the descriptions are illustrated by a color photo in Cassens (1973) Pithecellobium s.1., including Albizia, is characterized by several features that do not vary significantly among the different wood types. These characters are not repeated in the wood descriptions. A general description of Pithecello- bium s.1. is as follows: Heartwood light yellow, yellow-brown, red-brown, and dark brown to light brown with dark stripes. Specific gravity 0.52—1.09; fluorescence yellow, very pale yellow, or negative; froth test positive, short positive, or negative; growth increments more or less demarcated by fine bands of marginal parenchyma or by flattened cells. Wood diffuse porous; pores few to moderately numerous (3 to 17/sq. mm.), generally distinct without aid of a hand lens except in Chloroleucon, Ebenopsis, Klugiodendron, and Zygia; diameter moderately small to moderately large (78-273 um.). Vessel elements very short to medium sized (217-437 .m.); perforation plates simple with mostly transverse to oblique end walls; intervascular pitting alternate, vestured, and minute, very small, or medium sized (3-10 um.). Rays homo- cellular, extremely fine to fine (1 to 5 cells wide, or 12-38 um.), generally uniseriate, many specimens occasionally biseriate in part, in some wood types consistently 3 to 5 cells wide; height extremely low (11 to over 20 cells, or 177-405 ym.). Paratracheal parenchyma vasicentric to confluent; apotra- cheal parenchyma sometimes diffuse or in marginal bands; integumented, chambered, rhomboidal crystals often in long chains. Yellow to brown, nonbirefringent compound occasionally to frequently present in portions of the vessels and ray cells of all wood types except Albizia, Klugiodendron, and Macrosamanea; vessels and rays of the Ebenopsis wood-type completely occluded with this compound. Fibers moderately short to medium sized (728-1355 um.), septate or nonseptate; pits simple and inconspicuous. Abarema wood-type (51 specimens, 20 species). Sapwood yellowish white, distinct; heartwood red-brown.

COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF SECONDARY XYLEM WITHIN PITHECELLOBIUM S.L Pithecellobium s.J. is a small part of the relatively large, anatomically specialized subfamily Mimosoideae of the Leguminosae. In a family or subfamily where the secondary xylem is specialized, large variations—particu- larly in those characters of phylogenetic significance—are generally not found. In the secondary xylem of the Pithecellobium complex, notable variations in tracheary element length, perforation plate type, vessel pitting, and ray structure were not observed (TaBLE 2). However, based on anatomical characters that do not clearly suggest phivlogenetie trends, the woods of Pithecellobium can still be divided into four groups, each group containing from one to six different wood types. The four groups are based on the presence or absence of septate fibers and confluent parenchyma. Group | lacks both septate fibers and confluent parenchyma and is composed of the Chloroleucon, Ebenopsis, Samanea, Pseudosamanea, Cojoba, and Abarema wood-types. Group 2 has septate fibers but lacks confluent parenchyma; it is composed of Pithecellobium sensu stricto, Havardia, Arthrosamanea, and Albizia wood-types. Group 3, which lacks septate fibers but has confluent parenchyma, comprises Zygia and Marmaroxylon wood-types. Group 4 has both septate ee and confluent parenchyma and contains only the Macrosamanea wood-ty Although each of the four groups is anatomically ssn, relationships among the different groups are difficult to ascertain. Groups , however, appear to be more closely related than any other aaa of groups. Both groups are characterized by confluent parenchyma, uniseriate rays, medium-sized vessel elements, and intervascular pits 5-7 pm. in diameter. Similarities and differences are about the same among the other groups; therefore, relationships cannot be determined. However, the groups provide a convenient context for discussing the characteristics found in each wood type. Group | (both septate fibers and confluent parenchyma absent) The Cojoba wood-type has moderately short vessel elements, medium- sized pores, red-brown heartwood, and very small to minute (3-5 ym.) intervas- cular pits. The minute vessel pitting in this wood type is unique in the Pithe- cellobium complex. 36 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 The Samanea wood-type has moderately short vessel elements, moderately large pores, biseriate rays, medium-sized (7-10 ym.) intervascular pits, and dark brown heartwood. The intervascular pitting and biseriate rays distinguish this wood type from all others in Grou The Abarema wood-type has pede rately short to medium-sized vessel elements, moderately large pores, small (5-6 ym.) intervascular pits, mostly uniseriate rays, and red-brown heartwood. This wood type is distinguished from others in Group | by the size of the pores and intervascular pits, and by the mostly uniseriate rays. The Pseudosamanea wood-type has moderately short vessel elements, moderately large pores, uniseriate rays, small to medium-sized (6-8 «m.) intervascular pits, and red-brown heartwood. The presence of mostly unise- riate rays and the size of the intervascular pits and pores differentiates this wood type in Group |. The Chloroleucon wood-type has very short vessel elements, medium-sized pores, small (6-7 ym.) intervascular pits, uniseriate rays, yellow-brown heartwood, and a specific gravity of 0.65. The size of the pores, the color of the heartwood, and the specific gravity separate this wood type in Group 1 The Ebenopsis wood-type has very short vessel elements, medium-sized pores, small (6-7 ym.) intervascular pits, uniseriate rays, dark brown heart- wood, vessels filled with an amorphous substance, and a specific gravity of 1.09. This wood type is distinguished by the color of the heartwood and the high specific gravity. The various wood types in Group | are identifiable by relative differences in cell dimensions and macroscopic characteristics. Phylogenetic relationships among the wood types are not clear, but interesting observations are noted. The vessel element lengths of the Chloroleucon and Ebenopsis wood-types are nearly the same, but both are shorter than that of any other wood type in the Pithecellobium complex. The short vessel element length indicates that the two woods are probably at a higher level of specialization than any others in the Pithecellobium complex. Other microscopic features of these woods are nearly identical, and only the macroscopic features vary. Thus, the Chloroleucon and Ebenopsis woods appear more closely related to each other than to any others in Group 1 The wood of Chloroleucon vinhatico (Record) Record deserves special mention. It has rays two or three cells wide, while those of other species of Chloroleucon are uniseriate. Thus, C. vinhatico is distinct, but it is maintained in the Chloroleucon wood-type because other anatomical characters are similar. The vessel elements of the Samanea, Pseudosamanea, and Cojoba wood- types are similar in length, although they are longer than those of Ebenopsis and Chloroleucon types. The Cojoba wood-type has smaller intervascular pits and pores than do the Samanea and Pseudosamanea types. Pseudosamanea and Cojoba wood-types have uniseriate rays, whereas the Samanea wood-type is biseriate. Samanea and Pseudosamanea wood-types differ slightly in ray width and intervascular pit diameter. Therefore, the Samanea and Pseudosa- » 1981] CASSENS & MILLER, PITHECELLOBIUM 37 manea wood-types appear closely related. The Cojoba type does not appear close to any other wood types in Group 1 The Abarema wood-type has the longest vessel elements in Group 1 and is probably at the lowest level of specialization. Differences in vessel element length, intervascular pit diameter, pore diameter, wood color, and specific gravity suggest that the Abarema type does not appear closely related to Ebenopsis, Chloroleucon, or Cojoba wood-types. However, because of simi- larities of pore diameter and specific gravity, the Abarema, Samanea, and Pseudosamanea wood-types are somewhat similar. Group 2 (septate fibers present, confluent parenchyma absent) The wood types of Albizia and Arthrosamanea are characterized by rays two to four cells wide, vasicentric to aliform parenchyma, medium-sized to moderately large pores, small to medium-sized intervascular pits, moderately short to medium-sized vessel elements, and light yellow to light brown heartwood. These two wood types are discernible from all others in the group by ray width and heartwood color. The woods of Albizia and Arthrosa- manea cannot be separated. They are maintained as two separate wood types on the basis of taxonomic findings. The Havardia and Pithecellobium s.s. wood-types have medium-sized pores, small to medium-sized intervascular pits, very short to medium-sized vessel elements, and mostly uniseriate rays. These two wood types appear more closely related to each other than to any others in Group 2. Septate fibers, abundant in Havardia and scarce in Pithecellobium s.s., separate these two types. Heartwood color and specific gravity also vary among some species, suggesting that Havardia and Pithecellobium s.s. wood-types are distinct from each other. Due to differences in ray width, pore diameter, vessel element length, and certain physical characters, the Albizia and Arthrosamanea wood-types do not appear closely related to the Havardia and Pithecellobium wood-types. The Pithecellobium s.s. and Havardia wood-types have shorter vessel elements and narrower rays than the Albizia and Arthrosamanea wood-types. Thus, the Pithecellobium s.s. and Havardia wood-types suggest a higher level of specialization within Group 2. Group 3 (septate fibers absent, confluent parenchyma present) The Marmaroxylon and Zygia wood-types have medium-sized vessel ele- ments and pore diameters, nonseptate fibers, aliform to mostly confluent parenchyma, small intervascular pits, and mostly uniseriate rays. The heart- wood of the Marmaroxylon wood-type is light brown with dark stripes, while that of the Zygia type is light yellow. The microscopic features of Marmaroxylon and Zygia wood-types are similar. These two wood types thus appear more closely related to each other than to any other types. Group 4 (both septate fibers and confluent parenchyma present) The Macrosamanea wood-type has moderately short to medium-sized vessel elements, medium-sized pores, small intervascular pits, uniseriate rays, septate 38 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 fibers, and aliform to mostly confluent parenchyma. The secondary xylem of the Macrosamanea wood-type appears distinct from all others in the Pithecellobium complex. COMPARISON OF WOOD TYPES WITH TAXONOMIC CLASSIFICATION SYSTEMS The secondary xylem of Pithecellobium s.1. may be an aid in developing a taxonomic classification system that more nearly reflects the relationships of this complex genus. Based on variation in the macro- and microscopic wood anatomy, 15 wood types are apparent. For the most part, these 15 types compare favorably with the existing classification systems that have been proposed for Pithecellobium. In 1875 Bentham monographed the New World Pithecellobium complex. studied by Bentham are obscure today: their names do not appear in recent literature, and wood specimens are unavailable. Therefore, some recently proposed species names could be synonyms for those in Bentham’s monograph. In TaBLe 4 the various wood types are aligned with the corresponding sections and series proposed by Bentham (1875). Eight species in the Abarema wood-type, one in Arthrosamanea, three in Chloroleucon, two in Havardia, three in Macrosamanea, five in Pithecellobium s.s., and nine in Zygia were known to Bentham and correspond directly with the section and series as indicated. However, the only species in the Samanea wood-type (Samanea aman (Jacq.) Merr.) and one of seven species in the Cojoba wood-type Giese (Cojoba) sophorocarpum (Bentham) Britton & Rose) also appear in series 2, Carnosae. K/ugiodendron laetum (Poeppig & Endl.) Britton & Killip appears in section Abaremotemo, but observations of the secondary xylem suggest that K. laetum belongs in its own wood type, Klugiodendron. Clypearia is from the Old World and is thus not considered in this investigation. With few exceptions, the secondary xylem can be used as a basis to form the same groups that Bentham proposed as sections and series. The Pseudosamanea, Arthrosamanea, Cojoba, and Ebenopsis wood-types also contain some species known to Bentham. He placed these species in such widely different genera as Lysiloma, Mimosa, Acacia, and Inga. Current practice dictates their placement in Pithecellobium s.|. or its segregates. In 1928 Britton and Rose investigated the North and Central American species of Pithecellobium. In Tas_e 4 their segregate genera are aligned with the various wood types. The Cojoba, Chloroleucon, Ebenopsis, Havardia, and Pithecellobium wood-types contain seven, four, one, three, and five species, respectively, from Central America, and Britton and Rose listed these same species in the respective genera. The eight Central American species in the Abarema wood-type correspond to six species of Jupunba and two species of Samanea. The Samanea wood-type contains one Central American species that Britton and Rose list in Samanea. Three of the five 1981] CASSENS & MILLER, PITHECELLOBIUM 39 Tas_e 4.

Albizia wood-type is characterized by rays two to four cells wide, septate fibers, and a light yellow heartwood, whereas the Pseudosamanea wood-type has predominantly uniseriate rays, nonseptate fibers, and a red-brown heart- wood; thus, these wood types do not appear closely related. The Zygia wood-type contains eight species from Central America: six are listed in Zygia by Britton and Rose; the other two were not named at the time of their 1928 publication. With regard to Central American species, there are marked similarities among the wood types and the genera as proposed by Britton and Rose. 40 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 There are two exceptions—certain species of Albizia are included in the Pseudosamanea wood-type, and certain species of Samanea are included in the Abarema wood-type. A comparison of all species in the Pithecellobium complex studied by Bentham (1875) and by Britton and Rose (1928) with those species comprising the various wood types is included in Cassens (1973). A study of the Mimosaceae and Caesalpiniaceae of Colombia was initiated by Britton and Rose and completed and published by Britton and Killip (1936). They recognized Abarema, Albizia, Arthrosamanea, Chloroleucon, dosamanea, Punjuba, Samanea, and Zygia as distinct genera. Although a limited number of Colombian species were examined in this study, observations of the secondary xylem support Britton and Killip’s genera with few exceptions. Too few wood specimens were available to allow an understanding of the Klugiodendron and Punjuba wood-types. In addition, the Albizia and Arthrosamanea wood-types appear closely related and cannot be separated. Mohlenbrock (1963a, 1963b) has reviewed the Pithecellobium complex and its segregate genera. His key to the natural genera includes Albizia, Arthrosa- manea, Chloroleucon, Ebenopsis, Havardia, Samanea, and Zygia. Pithecello- bium sensu Mohlenbrock contains the New World segregates Abarema and Cojoba. Pseudosamanea and Macrosamanea are listed as synonyms of Albizia. On the basis of the secondary xylem, Albizia and Arthrosamanea wood-types cannot be separated. However, the Abarema and Cojoba wood-types can be separated from Pithecellobium, and the woods of both Pseudosamanea and Macrosamanea can be separated from A/bizia. With the exceptions noted, the genera accepted by Mohlenbrock and the proposed wood types correspond Hutchinson (1964) notes the taxonomic problems of Pithecellobium s.1. and suggests that a monograph be undertaken on a worldwide basis. However, he does cite Samanea, Albizia, Pseudosamanea, and Zygia as acceptable genera, which agrees with observations concerning the secondary xylem. In summary, Bentham’s monograph recognized six sections and four series in the New World Pilicodiooain complex. Later taxonomists raised these sections and series to generic status and added other genera. If the secondary xylem is used as a basis, the Abarema, Chloroleucon, Cojoba, Ebenopsis, Havardia, Macrosamanea, Marmaroxylon, Pithecellobium, Pseudosamanea, Punjuba, Samanea, and Zygia wood-types can be defined. The woods of Albizia and Arthrosamanea are inseparable. With the exceptions noted, these wood types correspond closely with the various sections and series proposed by Bentham, and the segregate genera proposed by more recent taxonomists. If the segregates of the Pithecellobium complex are to receive common acceptance, taxonomic study and possible transfer of a number of the species examined in this investigation will be required. Several transfers in the A barema wood-type are necessary due to changes in nomenclatural procedure. Britton and Rose (1928) created the genus Jupunba and cited Jupunba jupunba (Willd.) Britton & Rose as the type species. This name is a tautonym and is thus incorrect according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, Article 24.4. Therefore, Britton and Killip (1936) proposed Abarema and cited A. jupunba (Willd.) Britton & Killip as the type species. All species 1981] CASSENS & MILLER, PITHECELLOBIUM 41 with the generic name Jupunba should be transferred to Abarema. It is our opinion (based on our observations of the xylem anatomy) that the genus Abarema should include the following taxa: Pithecellobium arenarium Ducke, P. auriculatum Bentham, P. elegans Ducke, P. fanshawei Sandwith, P. gonggrijpii Kleinhoonte, P. langsdorfii Bentham, P. leucophyllum Spruce ex Bentham, P. mataybifolium Sandwith, P. panurense Spruce ex Bentham, P. villiferum Ducke, Samanea corymbosa (Rich.) Pittier, S. leucocalyx Britton & Rose, S. macradenia (Pittier) Britton & Rose, S. marginata (Spruce ex Bentham) Pittier, and S. pedicellaris (DC.) Killip. Additional species of Pithecellobium that appear to belong to other genera (again based on anatomical observation of the xylem) include the following: P. glabripetalum H. S. Irwin to Albizia; P. acacioides Ducke and P. mathewsii Bentham to Chloroleucon; P. membranaceum (Bentham) Schery to Cojoba; P. consanguineum Cowan to Macrosamanea; P. collinum Sandwith, P. dinizii Ducke, and P. umbriflorum Ducke to Marmaroxylon; and P. juruanum Harms to Zygia. Another transfer question was named by a taxonomist who did not support the segregation of small genera from Pithecellobium, the transfers have never been made to the appropriate segregate genera. SPECIALIZATION OF PITHECELLOBIUM S.L. Various authors have reported on the significance of the secondary xylem in the determination of phylogenetic relationships. The secondary xylem can be used to determine whether the wood of Pithecellobium s.l. is primitive or advanced (specialized) with respect to other species. Advanced (specialized) is a relative term that suggests that a particular wood is at a higher phylogenetic rank than a primitive one. Pithecellobium s.\\. is characterized by very short to moderately long libriform fibers with minute, slitlike simple pits. The vessel elements are very short to medium sized with simple perforation plates, transverse to oblique end walls, and alternate intervascular pitting. The fiber : vessel ratio of the different wood types ranges from 2.7 to 3.9. The pore diameters are moderately small to moderately large and appear circular to oval in cross section. The rays are extremely low in height, extremely fine to fine in width, and homogeneous. Most of the rays are uniseriate or in part biseriate and are without uniseriate wings. A few rays are two to five cells wide. Most woods in the Pithecellobium complex are characterized by abundant vasicentric to aliform paratracheal parenchyma. Confluent paratracheal bands are sometimes present. Distinct storied structure does not occur in the complex, but occasional isolated areas exist. These anatomical features indicate that the woods of Pithecellobium s.l. are relatively specialized. Features of a primitive xylem do not exist. Although the woods of Pithecellobium s.|. contain only specialized tracheary elements and tissue types, there are statistically significant differences in vessel element and fiber lengths. Differences also exist in both ray width 42 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 and parenchyma type. Based on vessel element length, Abarema and Mar- maroxylon wood-types with longer vessel elements suggest a lower level of specialization in the Pithecellobium complex, whereas the shorter vessel elements of Chloroleucon and Ebenopsis suggest a higher level. Based on fiber length, Chloroleucon is again the most specialized wood type, whereas Marmaroxylon is the least. When all wood types are considered, there is an overlapping of the confidence intervals for vessel element and fiber lengths, indicating a continuum throughout the generic complex. ost woods in the Pithecellobium complex have rays that are uniseriate or partially biseriate. However, the rays in Samanea, Albizia, and Arthrosa- manea are commonly two to four cells wide. Therefore, the ray tissue in these three wood types is less specialized than others in the Pithecellobium complex. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS The secondary xylem of 83 species of the Pithecellobium complex indicates that on the basis of the presence or absence of septate fibers and confluent parenchyma, four distinct wood groups can be defined. Other anatomical characteristics indicate that these four groups can be further divided into 15 wood types: Abarema, Albizia, Arthrosamanea, Chloroleucon, Cojoba, Ebenopsis, Havardia, Klugiodendron, Macrosamanea, Marmaroxylon, Pithe- cellobium s.s., Pseudosamanea, Punjuba, Samanea, and Zygia. Although the woods of ieee and A /bizia are indistinguishable, they are maintained as two separate wood types because of published morphological findings. The woods of Klugiodendron and Punjuba constitute two additional types; due to insufficient and immature xylarium specimens, they have not been included in the key or discussed in detail. When the various wood types are compared to the taxonomic classification systems proposed by Bentham (1875) and by Britton and Rose (1928), marked similarities become obvious. Based on the secondary xylem, the various species of the Pithecellobium complex fall into groups similar to those proposed by the various taxonomists who prefer the segregation of several small genera from Pithecello Observations oe secondary xylem indicate that 26 species could appro- priately be transferred to segregate genera. In addition, name changes from Jupunba to Abarema are needed due to incorrect nomenclature. Most anatomical features expressing specialization trends do not vary appreciably within the Pithecellobium complex. Therefore, the evolutionary relationships between different wood groups and types are unclear. However, differences in vessel element and fiber lengths and (to a lesser extent) ray width indicate some specialization levels among wood types. Based on vessel element length, the Abarema and Marmaroxylon wood-types appear at the lowest level of specialization in Pithecellobium s.1., whereas the Chloroleucon and Ebenopsis wood-types appear at the highest. The Samanea, Albizia, and Arthrosamanea wood-types have wider rays than others in the Pithecello- bium complex, thereby indicating a lower level of specialization. 1981] CASSENS & MILLER, PITHECELLOBIUM 43 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors wish to express their appreciation to Dr. B.

Howarp THE FOLLOWING NOTES were derived from a study of living plants in the West Indies, from herbarium specimens, and from the extensive literature on the family Lauraceae. They will be the basis of a treatment of the family in the pertinent volume of the Flora of the Lesser Antilles, now in preparation. Beilschmiedia Nees Beilschmiedia pendula (Sw.) Hemsley, Biol. Centr.-Am. 3: 70. 1887. Kostermans (1964), Imchanitzkaja (1974), and others credit the combination to Bentham or to Bentham and Hooker (1880, p. 152), where the transfer of taxa was suggested but the combination was not in fact made. Imchanitzkaja (1974, p. 195) has designated the lectotype as Swartz s.n. (s), from Jamaica. Cinnamomum Schaeffer Cinnamomum Schaeffer (Bot. Exped. 74. 1760) is a nomen conservandum. The original spelling of the generic name was Cimamomum, with the macron presumably indicating extra length, so the conserved spelling is Cinnamomum. The type species, published in Blume (Bijdr. Fl. Nederl. Indié. 11° stuk. 568. 1826), is indicated as ‘‘C. zeylanicum Blume (Laurus cinnamomum Linnaeus).’’ This is antedated by C. verum Bercht. & Presl (Prir. Rostlin. : 36, 37-44. t. 7. 1825). The epithet C. zeylanicum Breyne is occasionally aged in the literature and in some recent annotations. The reference, ‘‘Breynius in Ephem. Ac. Nat. Cur. Annua 4: 139, 140. 1676,’’ appears to be pre-Linnaean and so the name is invalid. Kostermans has combined the genera Cinnamomum and Phoebe and has made most of the necessary combinations in a paper entitled ‘‘The New World Species of Cinnamomum Trew’’ (1961). In this action he has been followed by Imchanitzkaja (1974) and Adams (1972), but not by Allen (1964), Bernardi (1962), or Philcox (1978). I will accept Kostermans’s view for the Flora of the Lesser Antilles. Cinnamomum elongatum (Nees) Kosterm. Reinwardtia 8(10): 21. 1961. Phoebe elongata Nees emend. Mez, Jahrb. Bot.

January, 1981. 46 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 Cinnamomum elongatum and C. cubensis have had varying treatments since the original publication, and the bibliographic citations have varied as well. Britton and Wilson (1924, p. 319) apparently were the first authors to combine the two species when they accepted Phoebe elongata (Vahl) Nees and placed P. cubensis Nees in synonymy; they have been followed by Brooks (1933, p. 225). Most recently, Imchanitzkaja (1974, p. 204) reversed the status of the two names by accepting P. cubensis and considering P. elongata as synonym. Leon and Alain (1951, pp. 186, 187) and Fournet (1978, p. 486) accepted both species, as did Kostermans (1961, p. 21) when he made the new combinations in Cinnamomum In the original description of Phoebe elongata, Nees (1836, p. 116) cited “Laurus elongata. . . Vahlin Herb. Willd. No. 7780. Fol. 1, Poeppig 1311.” The Poeppig specimen was from Peru and was excluded by Mez (1889), who referred it to P. triplinervis (Ruiz & Pavon) Mez (1889, p. 211). This, in effect, would typify P. elongata Nees by the remaining specimen cited by Nees, ‘“‘Vahl in Herb. Willd. 7780. Fol. 1.’’ However, Mez cited this under P. montana (Sw.) Griseb., while he typified P. elongata Nees emend. Mez by ‘‘Vahl in herb. Willd. n. 7780. fol. 2 (nec 1).’’ The specific characters are not readily identifiable in the microfiche of the Willdenow herbarium, and the correct typification depends on a reexamination of the herbarium material Roig and Acuna (in Leén & Alain, 1951, p. 186) listed ‘‘Laurus elongata Vahl’’ as a basionym of Phoebe elongata. Kostermans (1964, p. 293) listed Cinnamomum elongatum (Vahl ex Nees) Kostermans, with a basionym of ‘Phoebe elongata Vahl ex Nees,’’ although elsewhere (ibid., p. 1276) he also cited P. elongata (Vahl) Nees. For Laurus elongata Kostermans (ibid., p. 615) cited Vahl ex West, with the reference ‘‘Beskriv. af St. Croix 282. 1793.’’ Although Vahl is generally credited with the names used in West’s publication, this time the specific name “‘longifolia’’ was used without any description, and the name ‘“‘elongata’’ = not appear. Vahl’s name is not appropriate to the ee tas refer Mez (1889, pp. 182, 202, 203) eae Phoebe cubensis, number 26 in his key, as a collective species. Phoebe elongata was listed as number 26a but was not included in the key Britton and Wilson were the first to combine the taxa, and the: accepted name should be Cinnamomum elongatum (Nees emend. Mez) Kosterm. Cinnamomum falcatum (Mez) Howard, comb. nov. Ocotea? falcata Mez, Jahrb. Bot. Gart. Berlin 5: 388. 1889. Type: Guade- oupe, Duchassaing s.n. (B). Boeke talento (Mez) Mez a 7 Symb.

Kostermans recognized that Mez’s transfer of Ocotea falcata to Phoebe was invalid, as a later homonym, but he unnecessarily created a new name in Cinnamomum. The transfer of Ocotea? falcata Mez as the correct basionym is in order. 1981] HOWARD, LAURACEAE 47 Endlicheria Nees Endlicheria sericea Nees, Linnaea 8: 38. 1833. Kostermans (1964, p. 507) and others cited the authority for this cau as (Hooker ex Nees) Nees and gave Laurus sericea Hooker ex Nees a the basionym. In fact, Nees (1836, p. 369) listed as a synonym the ee cbliched herbarium name attributed to ‘‘Hooker in Herb. Arnott.’’ The exclusion of the parenthetical reference is important since the implied basionym would be invalid, having been antedated by L. sericea Blume (1 Endlicheria sericea Nees is typified by ‘‘Sieber Fl. Ins. Trinit. 175”’ (B), which was probably from Guadeloupe (Brooks, 1933, p. 227). The genus and species are not included in the Trinidad flora by Philcox (1978). Endlicheria guadaloupensis Mez, Jahrb. Bot. Gart. Berlin 5: 124. 1889. Kostermans (1937, p. 547) had placed this species in the synonymy of Endlicheria sericea Nees. Fournet (1978, p. 481) thought the species had been overlooked by recent workers. He recognized the taxon, known only from the original collections by Duchassaing, as having larger leaves than E. sericea. Abundant recent material clearly shows that Kostermans’s conclu- sion was correct. Laurus L. Laurus geminiflora Ham. Prodr. Pl. Indiae Occ. 37. 1825. Hamilton published a brief, generalized description and stated that he had seen living material on St. Kitts and Jamaica and herbarium material in the collections of Professor Desvaux. However, no specimen has been located in Paris, and the treatment of the Hamilton binomial in the literature is confusing. Meissner (1864, p. 102) assigned the Hamilton name, with a question mark, to the synonymy of Goeppertia geminiflora Meissner. He cited material collected by Martin in British Guiana and by Guillemin (23/) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. One staminate specimen was attributed to the herbarium of Kunth and one to that of de Candolle. Meissner, however, did not cite material by Hamilton or Desvaux. I assume, therefore, that the specific epithet ‘‘geminiflora Meissn.’’ is a new name and not a transfer or representative of a basionym In 1889 Mez (pp. 78, 79) established the new genus Systemonodaphne Leprieur 223 and Poiteau 63, 64, from British Guiana, were also cited. Laurus geminiflora Ham. is cited in synonymy with a question mark. Kostermans (1936, pp. 754, 755) described the new genus ak ae aisle daphne. He based the single species, P. geminiflora (Meissner) Kosterm on Goeppertia geminiflora Meissner, with the type specimen designated as Guillemin 231. Kostermans (1936, p. 756) considered Martin 45 to represent 48 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 the monotypic Systemonodaphne of Mez, which he felt should be renamed S. mezii Kosterm. He concluded, ‘‘Laurus geminiflora Desvaux in Hamilton, Prodr. Fl. Ind. Occ. (1825) p. 37 does, according to the description, not correspond either with Phyllostemonodaphne or with Systemonodaphne.”’ However, in 1964 Kostermans (p. 527) listed ‘‘Goeppertia geminiflora (Desv.) Meissn.”’ and stated that the basionym is Laurus geminiflora Desv. As indicated above, Kostermans must be in error, or the nomenclature of both Systemono- daphne and Phyllostemonodaphne must be reconsidered. Laurus geminiflora Ham. remains an unplaced name of the Antillean flora until herbarium material can be located. Litsea Lam. Duss (1897, p. 306) listed ‘‘Tetranthera laurifolia Jacq., Litsea sebifera Pers.’’ as cultivated in the botanical garden at St. Pierre, Martinique, and repre- sented by his own collection 343, Fournet (1978, p. 499) repeated the reference but did not indicate if the taxon was still under cultivation. Philcox (1978, p. 563) stated that “‘a specimen of the East Indian Litsea sebifera Juss. presumably from the island of Trinidad is located in the National Hoven at St. Augustine, Herb. Trin. n. 979, but no further data are available.’ Two specimens of Duss (348, 4094, and 348, 4095, both at ny), representing material once cultivated at St. Pierre and noted as escaped, were originally named Tetranthera laurifolia Roxb. and are annotated as Litsea glutinosa (Lour.) Roxb. The material available can not be properly placed at this time. Nectandra Rolander and Ocotea Aublet In The Bahama Flora (1920), Britton and Millspaugh accepted the genus Ocotea Aublet and listed Nectandra Rolander in synonymy. Only a single species, O. coriacea (Sw.) Britton, was involved, although the three specific names cited in synonymy were in three genera. In his subsequent work with other coauthors on the floras of Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Trinidad, Britton recognized the two genera Ocotea and Nectandra. In 1957 Kostermans described the genera and subgenera of the Lauraceae that he proposed to accept in a revision of the family. He recognized Ocotea Aublet with three subgenera, one of them subg. Nectandra (Rolander) Kosterm. Kostermans noted that the sexual condition of the flower (perfect or unisexual), the attitude of the tepals at anthesis, and the arrangement of the pollen sacs of the anthers (at two levels or in an arcuate row) were not satisfactory generic characters used either singly or in combination. In fact, he found no fruiting or vegetative characters useful in distinguishing the gene There has been no consensus to follow Kostermans’s action. In adv the Lauraceae of Venezuela, Bernardi (1962) concluded that although the separation of some species of Ocotea and Nectandrais very difficult, combining the genera did not simplify the problems of nomenclature or the determination of the species. Actually, he found it relatively easy to differentiate between them in the field by quickly glancing at the stamens. Bernardi continued to recognize both Nectandra and Ocotea in three papers published in 1967 in which he transferred several species from one genus to the other. Allen 1981] HOWARD, LAURACEAE 49 (1964, p. 64) maintained two genera and stated, ‘‘Eventually, a detailed, monographic study will be made of this group. Possibly future examination of herbarium material not now available, together with field observations and anatomical study, may show them to represent opposite extremes o a single variable genus. Until such time, despite an overlapping of characteris- tics in some plants, 1.e., the occasional indeterminate position of the anther cells which appear to be in obscure arc-formation or approach superposition on two distinct planes, they are considered as separate genera.’’ Allen (1966, p. 226) wrote, “‘Subsequently Kostermans has seen fit to combine all three genera, Ocotea, Nectandra and Pleurothyrium, under Ocotea. If we accept this reduction the entire taxonomic fabric of the Lauraceae will be further imperiled; for elsewhere in the family there are several instances where reasons equally strong can be found for combining ecnera hitherto maintained as distinct entities by all students of the Lauraceae.’ Most recently, Imchanitzkaja (1974) recognized both Nectandra and Ocotea and, after reviewing the reaction to Kostermans’s lumping, commented (translation by author): “‘In this work we consider Nectandra as a separate genus, although in the future, with the accumulation of more observations, possibly it will be united with Ocotea. At this point, we do not have enough material to decide the question of Nectandra’s taxonomic position in view of the small amount of work done on the species of Nectandra and Ocotea, and the absence of essential research on their morphology, anatomy, and In reality, the more Practical approach for a limited flora such as that t. field and are more often than not of little value with most herbarium specimens. For many years Dr. C. K. Allen drew meticulous sketches of floral dissections of the Lauraceae she examined. These sketches may be annotated once or several times with the generic names Ocotea, Nectandra, and/or Phoebe, with or without question marks, indicating that even after a lifetime of work she was unable to establish the genus for a particular specimen. Bernardi (in Kostermans, 1964, p. viii) referred to the many species transfers he contemplated and perhaps completed (Bernardi, 1967a, 1967b, 1967c). The transfer of species from Ocotea to Nectandra and vice versa by a single author or successive authors clearly indicates uncertainty among the authorities concerning the generic assignment. It suggests that the designation of the genus has often been based on the particular flower that was dissected. Nees (1836) and Mez (1889), the early monographers on the family, attempted to solve the problem by recognizing a larger number of genera, even suggesting that dioecism was in itself a reliable character at the generic level or for a major division within a genus. In practical work with herbarium specimens, it is difficult to determine if a stamen is functional and producing pollen, or if the pistil is perele or signe: Personal observations made in the field suggest that a polyg ndition is common. Some species described as having perfect flowers were seen to produce only one or a very few 50 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [VoL. 62 fruits per panicle, and such sexual differences of perfect and functionally unisexual flowers can be observed in the inflorescences. A full understanding of these structural differences, and of the localized production of fruit or the heavy, early fall of flowers, will require additional special study. Some plants of the Lauraceae in the West Indies produce aberrant or species and never in others. The aberrant inflorescence may be diffuse and may have many small leaves or a superfluity of bracts. In other plants, by contrast, the aberrant inflorescence may be congested with an abnormal number of bracts, flowers, or floral parts. Since such specimens are gathered in flower, there is no information available on the production of fruit by these abnormal flowers, and no records can be found to indicate if a plant that produces a monstrous inflorescence one year may dothe same again. The leaves of stems associated with monstrous inflorescences eggersiana show pinnate venation of the stem leaves, but plinervy on the leaves from what may be an abnormal inflorescence. The characteristic of domatia in the axils of secondary veins has also been used in the classification of species. Present observations from dried specimens suggest that this characteristic is also unreliable. The domatia may be present or absent, lebetiform or marsupiform, and glabrous or barbate on the same leaf or adjacent leaves. A special study is also needed to compare the domatia in fresh and dried leaves. Although fruit size and shape have been used in descriptions, these characters have not been evaluated satisfactorily by field studies. The fruiting pedicel of Ocotea is brightly colored (usually red), and the mature fruit is dark purple or black. The fruit is variously referred to as a drupe or a berry. es indication of a hard cau thus, their classification as one-seeded berries seems more appropriat n dry, the ans pedicel may be described as terete or clavate, enti gradually or abruptly into a flat surface, or into a cupular one thatis crateriform, cyathiform, or urceolate, with the margin smooth, irregular, or pedicels. The nature and amount of variation resulting from drying are not fully appreciated; therefore, the value of pedicel shape in dried specimens remains to be determined for nearly all species from the Lesser Antilles. The following species, considered in alphabetical order, have been reported from the Lesser Antilles generally either as Ocotea or Nectandra and merit some comment. Ocotea alpina R. A.

Beard 457 (Ny). Martinique: San Martin on Mt. Pelée, Duss 4411 (ny). Flowering material of this species has previously been determined as Ocotea jacquinii and Phoebe falcata. It is clearly distinct from the former in the smaller fruits and glabrous leaves and differs from the latter in the urceolate cupule and in staminal characters. The specimens Beard 457, Britton & Cowell 696, and Howard & Nevling 16864 are aberrant in having galled flowers in monstrous inflorescences, and stem leaves abnormal in size, shape, and thickness. The galled flowers are aggregated into bracteate clusters and have the perianth parts much thickened. Accessory sterile stamens appear to be formed in all three series in some flowers. This species occurs in mist forests above 800 meters altitude. Nectandra antillana Meissner in DC. Prodr. 15(1): 153. 1864. In the original description several collections were cited from Cuba, Hispaniola, and Jamaica, in addition to Belanger 160, from Martinique, and Imray s.n., from Dominica. Imchanitzkaja (1974, p. 203) stated the lectotype to be ‘‘Jamaica, Red Hills, Rio Cobre, Sloane (pm) (Sloane, 1725, Nat. Hist. Jamaicae 2: 21, tab. 165).”’ Bernardi (1962, p. 190, esp. note no. 1) noted that material of this taxon had been called Nectandra globosa (Aublet) Mez, N. pisi Miq., or N. glabre- scens Bentham. In 1973 Barneby and Allen annotated material of N. antil- lana as N. glabrescens Bentham, and specimens of N. krugii Mez as N. 32 JOURNAL OF THE ARNOLD ARBORETUM [voL. 62 globosa (Aublet) Mez. Imchanitzkaja (1974) did not discuss any of these names, but Adams (1972, p. ) commented under N. antillana, ‘‘In the strict sense confined to the Greater Antilles and St. Thomas, perhaps also extending to Guadeloupe. N. globosa (Aublet) Mez replaces this species in continental America.”’ Kostermans (1936, pp. 14-19), Bernardi (1962, p. 120), and Allen (1964, p. 118) have discussed this nomenclatural tangle. Although the complete problem will not be solved by my comments, an observation is needed. Both Nectandra globosa (Aublet) Mez and Ocotea globosa (Aublet) Schlecht. & Cham. appear to be based on Laurus globosa Aublet (Hist. Pl. Guiane Fr. 364. 1775). Laurus globosa Aublet bears a brief description, ‘‘fructu nigro, calice rubente,’’ and reference to ‘‘Borbonia fructu globoso, nigro, calice e viridi rubente, Plum. Gen. 4.’’ Lamarck (Encycl. 3: 451. 1789) cited Aublet and added descriptive material and the references ‘‘Plumier Mss. vol. 6, t. 99°’ and ‘‘Sloane Hist. 2 p. 21 t. 166 f. 1.\"’ The Sloane reference is to Trichilia moschata Sw. (Meliaceae), according to Fawcett and Rendle (Fl. Jam. 4(2): 211. 1920). The Plumier manuscript reference is important. Kostermans (1936, p. 20) equated Plumier Gen. 4 with ‘‘Plumier’s plant, figured in Descr. pl. Amer. ed. Burm. (1775) p. 50, t. 60°’ when he noted that, according to Uroan (Repert. Sp. Nov. Beih. 5: 49. 1920), plate 60 is identical with N. antillana Meissner. He thus came to the conclusion that while the Burman edition does repeat the Plumier Nova Plantarum reference and the polynomial, there are, in addition, three synonyms (from Catesby, from Clayton, and from Linnaeus’s Hortus Cliffortianus and Species Plan- tarum), all of which are today referred to Persea borbonia (L.) Sprengel. The illustration (¢. 60), although crude, is Nectandra antillana Meissner, not Persea borbonia (L.) Sprengel. Kostermans did not indicate that Urban had made reference to Plumier Mss. Vol. 6, ¢. 99 (Repert. Sp. Nov. Beih. 5: 112. 1920). The correct name for Nectandra antillana Meissner of the Greater Antilles is Ocotea globosa (Aublet) Schlecht. & Cham. Despite the citations of Meissner (1864) and Mez (1889) and the general reports of Imchanitzkaja (1974) and Fournet (1978), I have seen no specimens from the Lesser Antilles that should be referred to this species. Herbarium material previously identified as N. antillana has proven to be O. membranacea (Sw.) Howard. Barneby and Allen’s annotations of N. krugii Mez as N. globosa (Aublet) Mez are not accepted. Ocotea cernua (Nees) Mez, Mitt. Bot. Vereins Kreis Freiburg 47, 48: 422. 1888 Mez published this combination one year preceding his larger paper (1889) that is usually cited as the bibliographic reference. Mez referred only to “Sieber fl. mixt. No. 385,’’ but this can not be regarded as lectotypification since Nees (1836, p. 424) did not cite such a number among the syntypes mentioned in the original description of Oreodaphne cernua Nees. Typification of this species requires further study. 1981] HOWARD, LAURACEAE 53 Ocotea clavigera Mez, Jahrb. Bot. Gart. Berlin 5: 239. 1889, Bot. Jahrb. 30(Beibl. 67): 18. 1901. Originally Duchassaing and |’Herminier collections from Guadeloupe were cited as in the Berlin and the Barbey-Boissier herbaria. No lectotype has been chosen, and the species is referred to the synonymy of Ocotea imrayana ez Ocotea dominicana (Meissner) Howard, comb. nov. Oreodaphne? dominicana Meissner in DC.

The collection Sieber 229, from Trinidad, cited by Mez (1889, p. 400) must have a mixed label and must have originated in Guadeloupe (Brooks, 1933, p. 227). Recent collections have shown that two sizes of leaves are found in this species. Small leaves 8-17 cm. long are usually associated with flowering specimens. Sterile collections or those with detached fruits may have leaves 25-39 cm. long. Field observations on the growth habits of this taxon are needed Ocotea dussii Mez, Bull. Herb. Boiss. II. 5: 241. 1905. In the original description three collections by Duss (3888, 4033, and 4037) in the herbarium of Krug and Urban (s) were cited. A lectotype should be chosen if the original material still exists at Berlin. I have not seen material of Duss 3888, but specimens in other herbaria may bear the numbers 4033, 4037 or 4037, 4033 on one label. I suspect that originally Duss 4033 was a collection in fruit, and 4037 a collection in staminate flower. Unfortunately, several sheets of Duss 4037, 4033—as well as D"
