In the last five games, Boozer is nearly averaging a double-double with 12.6 points and 8.8 rebounds rebounds per game. He registered his 17th double double of the season when he scored 12 points and grabbed 10 boards in the 93-83 win over the Dallas Mavericks.

They will take on the Chicago Bulls in the first round.\n\nLuol Deng\n\nChicago Bulls - Forward/Center\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (7th pick) by the Phoenix Suns (2004)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 53 games, 15.5 PPG, 6.5 RPG, 2.9 APG, 1.1 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nDeng, who missed two games due to bruised ribs, returned to action last Thursday for the Bulls. Deng, an offensive-minded forward, recorded 11 points and grabbed three rebounds in the 83-72 loss to the Miami Heat. He scored a game-high 22 points and recorded six rebounds, three assists and a steal as the Bulls dropped the Mavericks 93-83. He registered nine points, eight rebounds, two assists and a block in the 92-87 win over the Indiana Pacers. Deng, who averages 39.5 minutes, leads the NBA in minutes per game. The Chicago Bulls, who finished with the best record in the Eastern Conference, are one of only two teams in the NBA to win 50 games this year.\n\nChris Duhon Orland Magic - Guard\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round (38th pick) by the Chicago Bulls (2004)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 62 Games, 3.7 PPG, 1.6 RPG, 2.4 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nDuhon, a solid contributor off the bench for the Orlando Magic, helped snap a three-game losing streak last night. The Magic had lost their previous three contests to Boston (102-98), Utah (117-107) and Denver (101-74). Duhon tallied two rebounds and four assists in 19 minutes of action off the bench for the Magic as they defeated the struggling Charlotte Bobcats 102-95. In the last five games, Duhon is averaging 17.7 minutes, three points and 1.4 rebounds per game for the Magic, who is 37-28 overall and in third place in the Southeast Division. The Magic face the Indiana Pacers in the NBA First Round.\n\nMike Dunleavy Milwaukee Bucks - Guard/Forward\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (3rd pick) by the Golden State Warriors (2002)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 54 Games, 12.4 PPG, 3.7 RPG, 2.2 APG, 0.5 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nDunleavy, a steady contributor off the bench for the Milwaukee, helped the Bucks win two of their last three games.

The fourth-year pro saved his best for last as he averaged a season-high 16.3 points per game in April while scoring at least 20 points five times this month. Henderson also led the team in steals per game and made field goals. Unfortunately, the Bobcats had a historically bad year as they set the NBA record for the lowest winning percentage with a 7-59 record. Said Henderson, \"Nobody in here is used to losing like we have lost this year. It just kind of humbles you and teaches you a lot about what it takes to be successful in this game. It also teaches you what it takes to have a good team in the NBA.\"\n\nGrant Hill\n\nPhoenix Suns - Forward\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (3rd pick) by the Detroit Pistons (1994)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 49 Games, 10.2 PPG, 3.5 RPG, 2.2 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.6 BPG\n\nIn his 17th season in the NBA, Hill has struggled of late due to a lingering knee issue that required surgery. He has played in only three of the Suns' last 16 games. The Suns lost to the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night 100-88 costing them a trip to the playoffs. This is the first time since 1988 that the Suns have missed the playoffs for the second consecutive season. Hill finishes the 2011-12 campaign averaging 28.1 minutes, 10.2 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.2 assists in the 49 games played this season.\n\nKyrie Irving\n\nCleveland Cavaliers - Point Guard\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (1st pick) by the Cleveland Cavaliers (2011)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 40 games, 19.0 PPG, 3.8 RGP, 5.7 APG, 1.0 SPG, 0.5 BPG\n\nIrving, a likely contender for NBA Rookie of the Year, leads the Cavaliers in scoring, averaging 18.5 points per game.

Irving, who normally averages 30.5 minutes per game, saw 10 minutes of action where he scored five points and tallied a rebound and an assist in the 96-85 loss to the Washington Wizards. Irving helped lead the Cavs to a 21-44 overall record and fifth place in the Central Division.\n\nDahntay Jones\n\nIndiana Pacers - Guard/Forward (2003)\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (20th pick) by the Boston Celtics\n\n2011-12 Stats: 65 Games, 5.3 PPG, 1.8 RPG, 1.0 APG, 0.4 SPG, 0.2 BPG\n\nJones remains a steady contributor off the bench for the Pacers, who locked up the No. 3 spot in the Eastern Conference and will have home court advantage against Orlando in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.

Maggette struggled with injuries throughout the year and missed the Bobcats' final 10 games due to a right Achilles tendon injury he initially suffered on March 30 in the 99-88 loss to the Denver Nuggets. Maggette finished his 13th NBA season averaging 27.5 minutes, 15.0 points, 3.9 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 0.7 steals per game.\n\nJosh McRoberts\n\nLos Angeles Lakers - Forward/Center\n\nDrafted: 2nd Round (37th pick) by the Portland Trail Blazers (2007)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 49 Games, 2.5 PPG, 3.3 RPG, 1.0 APG, 0.3 SPG, 0.4 BPG\n\nMcRoberts, a reserve averaging 13.9 minutes per game for the Los Angeles Lakers, has seen time in four of the Lakers last five games.

Redick\n\nOrlando Magic - Shooting Guard\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (11th pick) by the Orlando Magic (2006)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 65 Games, 11.6 PPG, 2.3 RPG, 2.5 APG, 0.4 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nRedick has become one of Orlando's top scorers in the absence of all-star center Dwight Howard, who underwent back surgery and is out indefinitely. Since Howard left the team, Redick has scored in double figures in eight of the last 11 games including a career-high 31 points in a 102-95 victory over the Charlotte Bobcats. Redick hit six three-pointers in that game and has been on fire in the month of April, averaging 14.5 points per game. His 14.5 points per game in April is his highest scoring average in any month during his six-year NBA career. The former National College Player of the Year has now hit at least one three in 11 straight games. Redick closed out the regular season averaging a career-high 11.6 points per game and will look to keep up his hot shooting against the Indiana Pacers in the first round of the NBA Playoffs.\n\nNolan Smith\n\nPortland Trail Blazers - Point Guard\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (21st pick) by the Portland Trail Blazers (2011)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 43Games, 3.5 PPG, 1.3 RPG, 1.3 APG, 0.4 SPG, 0.1 BPG\n\nAfter struggling to find a consistent role with the Trail Blazers for much of the 2011-12 season, Smith emerged as a key player during Portland's final six games.

Smith had his two highest scoring games at the end of the year, scoring 16 points against Utah twice. The final month of his first professional season saw him average 21:06 minutes per game, 6.4 points per game and 2.3 assists per game with a 1.93:1 assist-to-turnover ratio.\n\nLance Thomas\n\nNew Orleans Hornets - Forward\n\nDrafted: Undrafted out of Duke in 2012\n\n2011-12 Stats: 41 Games, 3.8 PPG, 2.9 RPG, 0.3 APG, 0.2 SPG, 0.0 BPG\n\nThomas spent an entire month in the NBA Development League this season, but came out better on the other end. After being waived by New Orleans just three games into the 2011-12 season, Thomas re-signed with the Hornets in February and became a key contributor in the post. He started the final six games and played a career-high 45:45 minutes in the season finale, scoring 11 points and grabbing eight rebounds. Thomas was New Orleans' leading free throw shooter, hitting 83.9 percent of his shots from the charity stripe and sinking 17 of his final 18 foul shots. He scored in double figures four times, including in two of his final three games.\n\nShelden Williams\n\nNew Jersey Nets - Forward/Center\n\nDrafted: 1st Round (5th pick) by the Atlanta Hawks (2006)\n\n2011-12 Stats: 58 Games, 4.6 PPG, 6.0 RPG, 0.6 APG, 0.8 SPG, 0.7 BPG\n\nWilliams finished out the regular season as a reliable contributor for the New Jersey Nets, who played their final game in the Garden State on Monday before their impending move to Brooklyn. Williams, who was the Nets' most durable player over the first 52 games of the season, missed the final four games with an eye injury and a hyperextended knee. Williams finished the season averaging 22 minutes, 4.6 points, and 6.0 rebounds per game. He set career highs in rebounds per game (6.0), steals per game (0.8) and blocks per game (0.7) in his first season with the Nets.\n\n-d-u-k-e-"
