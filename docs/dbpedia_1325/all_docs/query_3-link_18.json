        "text": "The financial reporting of both companies and investment research services use a basic earnings per share (EPS) figure divided into the current stock price to calculate the P/E multiple (i.e. how many times a stock is trading (its price) per each dollar of EPS).\n\nprice\n\n(netIncome / shareNumber)\n\n= -\n\nThe P/E ratio and P/S reflects how many times investors are paying for every dollar of a company's sales. Since earnings are subject, to one degree or another, to accounting estimates and management manipulation, many investors consider a company's sales (revenue) figure a more reliable ratio component in calculating a stock's price multiple than the earnings figure.\n\nprice\n\n(revenue / shareNumber)\n\n= -\n\nThe price-to-book value ratio, expressed as a multiple (i.e. how many times a company's stock is trading per share compared to the company's book value per share), is an indication of how much shareholders are paying for the net assets of a company.\n\nprice\n\n(totalStockHolderEquity / shareNumber)\n\n= -\n\nROE this ratio calculates how much money is made based on the investors' investment in the company.investors want to see a high return on equity ratio because this indicates that the company is using its investors' funds effectively.\n\nnetIncome\n\ntotalStockHolderEquity\n\n= -\n\nROE this ratio calculates how much money is made based on the investors' investment in the company.investors want to see a high return on equity ratio because this indicates that the company is using its investors' funds effectively.\n\nnetIncome\n\ntotalStockHolderEquity\n\n= -\n\nThe larger the operating cash flow coverage for these items, the greater the company's ability to meet its obligations, along with giving the company more cash flow to expand its business, withstand hard times, and not be burdened by debt servicing and the restrictions typically included in credit agreements.\n\noperatingCashFlow\n\ncapex\n\n= -\n\nFor conservative investors focused on cash flow coverage, comparing the sum of a company's capital expenditures and cash dividends to its operating cash flow is a stringent measurement that puts cash flow to the ultimate test. If a company is able to cover both of these outlays of funds from internal sources and still have cash left over, it is producing what might be called \"free cash flow on steroids\". This circumstance is a highly favorable investment quality.\n\noperatingCashFlow\n\n(capex + dividendPaid)\n\n= -\n\nThe cash conversion cycle (CCC = DSO + DIO â€“ DPO) measures the number of days a company's cash is tied up in the production and sales process of its operations and the benefit it derives from payment terms from its creditors. The shorter this cycle, the more liquid the company's working capital position is. The CCC is also known as the \"cash\" or \"operating\" cycle.\n\nDays of Sales Outstanding + Days of Inventory Outstanding + Days of Payables Outstanding\n\n= -\n\nProfit is the main goal of for-profit organizations. The goal is to make a profit through growth and to grow every year. As a result, one of the most important roles of the financial and investment analyst is to track and forecast profitability.\n\nIncomeBeforeTax\n\nrevenue\n\n= -\n\nThe Asset Turnover ratio can often be used as an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is deploying its assets in generating revenue.\n\nrevenue\n\nTotalAssets\n\n= -\n\nThe PEG ratio is a refinement of the P/E ratio and factors in a stock's estimated earnings growth into its current valuation.The general consensus is that if the PEG ratio indicates a value of 1, this means that the market is correctly valuing (the current P/E ratio) a stock in accordance with the stock's current estimated earnings per share growth. If the PEG ratio is less than 1, this means that EPS growth is potentially able to surpass the market's current valuation. In other words, the stock's price is being undervalued. On the other hand, stocks with high PEG ratios can indicate just the opposite - that the stock is currently overvalued.\n\nPriceEarningsRatio\n\nExpectedRevenueGrowth\n\n= -\n\nOverall, this measurement allows investors to assess a company on the same basis as that of an acquirer. As a rough calculation, enterprise value multiple serves as a proxy for how long it would take for an acquisition to earn enough to pay off its costs in years(assuming no change in EBITDA).\n\nEntrepriseValue\n\nEBITDA\n\n= -\n\nHelps investors determine whether a stock is trading at, below, or above its fair value estimate,A price/fair value ratio below 1 suggests the stock is trading at a discount to its fair value, while a ratio above 1 suggests it is trading at a premium to its fair value.\n\nprice\n\nIntrinsicValue\n\n= -\n\nA metric that represents the amount of cash a company has on hand for each outstanding share of its common stock. It provides insight into the liquidity and financial health of a company. It helps investors understand how much cash is available to support the company's operations or pursue investment opportunities on a per-share basis.\n\nShortTermInvestments+CashAndEquivalents\n\nShares\n\n= -\n\nA metric that represents the amount of free cash flow generated by a company for each outstanding share of its common stock. It helps investors assess how much cash is available on a per-share basis after accounting for capital expenditures.\n\nFreeCashFlow\n\nShares\n\n= -\n\nA metric that represents the amount of cash generated from a company's core operating activities for each outstanding share of its common stock. It provides insight into the cash-generating capability of a company's primary business operations on a per-share basis. It is used by investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash from its core activities and support its ongoing business.\n\nOperatingCashFlow\n\nShares\n\n= -"
