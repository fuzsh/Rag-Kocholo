        "text": "Materials and methods\n\nMice and genotyping for generation of conditional Neurod1 knockout mice\n\nNeurod1 systemic null (KO) mice die within a few days after birth because of severe hyperglycemia. To overcome this problem, we extended our analysis in the inner ear by using Neurod1 conditional knockout (CKO) mice [Neurod1f/f,Tg(Pax2-cre)].\n\nTo generate the Neurod1 CKO mice, we crossed a Pax2-cre line (Ohyama and Groves 2004) with the floxed Neurod1 line (Goebbels et al. 2005). For this study, we crossed homozygotic floxed Neurod1 mice (Neurod1f/f) with heterozygous Neurod1f/+,Tg(Pax2-cre) mice. The resulting Neurod1f/f,Tg(Pax2-cre) mice were CKO mutants, and the Neurod1f/+,Tg(Pax2-cre) heterozygous siblings served as controls, here referred to as wildtypes. To monitor endogenous Neurod1 expression, we used Neurod1f/z,Tg(Pax2-cre) mice as mutants and Neurod1+/z mice as controls, in which a LacZ reporter replaced the Neurod1 coding region (Kim et al. 2001). Expression of the lacZ reporter was monitored by β-galactosidase staining. To compare the Neurod1 CKO effect with the systemic Neurod1 null mice (Neurod1 KO mice), we examined the Neurod1 z/z mice. Offspring was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction analysis of tail DNA by using cre-specific primers, which produce a 280-bp product, and Neurod1-specific primers, which produce a 400-bp product from the Neurod1-coding region and a 600-bp product from the floxed allele. Embryos were collected from timed pregnant females at embryonic day 9.5 ( E9.5), E11.5, E12.5, E13.5, and E14.5, counting noon of the day the vaginal plug was found as E0.5. We also analyzed mice at postnatal day 0 (P0), P7, P14, and P30. Pregnant mothers or juvenile mice were anesthetized with a lethal dose of Avertin (1.25% 2.2.2-tribromoethanol at a dose of 0.025 ml/g body weight). Embryos were dissected from the uterus and perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) by using a peristaltic pump. Heads were isolated and fixed in 4% PFA for further analysis. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Iowa Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (ACURF #0804066).\n\nX-gal staining\n\nHeads of mice perfused with 4% PFA were hemisected. Ears were dissected and then briefly washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer. The samples were stained in a solution containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer, 0.01% deoxycholic acid, 0.02% NP40, 2 mM magnesium chloride, 5 mM potassium ferricyanide, 5 mM potassium ferrocyanide, and 0.1 mg/ml X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactoside) for about 24 h at room temperature (Matei et al. 2006).\n\nIn situ hybridization\n\nIn situ hybridization was performed by using an RNA probe labeled with digoxigenin. The plasmids containing the cDNAs were used to generate the RNA probe by in vitro transcription. The dissected ears were dehydrated in 100% methanol and rehydrated in graded methanol and digested briefly with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (Ambion, Austin, Tex., USA) for 15–20 min. The samples were then hybridized overnight at 60°C to the riboprobe in hybridization solution containing 50% (v/v) formamide, 50% (v/v) 2× saline sodium citrate (Roche), and 6% (w/v) dextran sulfate. After the unbound probe had been washed off, the samples were incubated overnight with an anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. Following a series of washes, the samples were reacted with nitroblue phosphate/5-bromo, 4-chloro, 3-indolyl phosphate (BM purple substrate; Roche Diagnostics, Germany) which is enzymatically converted to a purple-colored product. The ears were mounted flat in glycerol and viewed with a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope by differential interference contrast microscopy, and images were captured with MetaMorph software. All probes used in this study are listed in .\n\nTable 1\n\nProbeSource Neurod1 Lee et al. 1995 Neurog1 Ma et al. 1998 Nhlh1 and Nhlh2Gift from Dr. Thomas Braun, Max Planck Institute for Heart and Lung Research, Bad Nauheim, Germany Prox1 Oliver et al. 1993\n\nImmunofluorescence\n\nFor immunofluorescence staining, the ears were dehydrated in 100% ethanol overnight and rehydrated and blocked with 0.25% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.01% Triton X-100 for 1 h. The primary antibodies for tubulin (Sigma), Myo VII (Myosin VIIa, Proteus Biosciences), and caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology) were used at dilutions of 1:800, 1:200, and 1:100, respectively. Ears were incubated with antibodies for 48 h at 4°C. After several washes with PBS, corresponding secondary antibodies (Alexa fluor molecular probe 647 or 532 or 488; Invitrogen) were added at a dilution of 1:500 and incubated overnight at 4°C. The ears were washed with PBS and mounted in glycerol. Images were taken with a Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope.\n\nLipophilic dye tracing\n\nThe heads of the mice were cut sagittally along the midline, and three different colored dyes were inserted to label the afferent and efferent fibers from and to the inner ear. Lipophilic-dye-soaked filter strips (Fritzsch et al. 2005b) were inserted into the alar plate of the brainstem to label the afferent fibers of the eighth cranial nerve. Efferent fibers were labeled by applying dye into the olivo-cochlear efferent bundle as it crosses the floor plate in rhombomere 4. Disregarding the type of dye inserted into the brainstem, the afferents were shown with a green color and efferents with a red color. Half heads were kept in an oven at 60°C for about 3–7 days depending on the age of the mice to allow proper diffusion. In the E14.5 mice the dyes were injected into rhombomeres 2, 5, and 7 to label the afferent and efferent fibers. The ears, vestibular ganglia, and brains were subsequently dissected out for analysis, and images were taken via the Leica TCS SP5 confocal microscope. Afferent tracing from the ear was performed by selectively placing the dye-soaked filter strips into the vestibular and cochlear sensory epithelia. For double- and triple-color tracing from the ear, NeuroVue red dye inserted into the cochlear apex was coded as red and NeuroVue maroon, a blue color dye inserted into the base was coded as blue. NeuroVue Jade dye, which gives a yellow color with white light, was applied to the anterior crista/horizontal crista or utricle and was shown with a false color code as green in epifluorescent light. Brains were viewed as whole-mounts or as coronal sections.\n\nResults\n\nKO and CKO Neurod1 null mice have a similar ear phenotype\n\nThe near complete early fatality of the Neurod1 KO mice (Kim et al. 2001) combined with the possibility of additional ear-specific phenotypes attributable to insulin deficiency (Sanchez-Calderon et al. 2007) has arrested analysis in postnatal mice as proinsulin plays a neuro-protective role (Sanchez-Calderon et al. 2007). Moreover, one characteristic of the lack of insulin is peripheral neuropathy, a problem that could compromise later stage analysis of innervation in Neurod1 null mice. We have sidestepped this problem by crossing a Tg(Pax2-cre) line (Ohyama and Groves 2004) with a conditional deletion of Neurod1 (Goebbels et al. 2005) to generate a new line that is viable and fertile. Pax2-cre is expressed in the early somite stage in the ear before and during Neurod1 expression (Kim et al. 2001; Ohyama and Groves 2004). In contrast to late-expressing Tg(Atoh1-cre) that had no effect on inner ear neurons (Pan et al. 2009), Tg(Pax2-cre) has been used to effectively recombine floxed genes such as Dicer (Soukup et al. 2009) in the ear.\n\nTo ascertain the effectiveness of conditionally deleted Neurod1 with Tg(Pax2-cre), we compared the phenotypes of Neurod1 CKO mice with those of Neurod1 KO mice. The loss of spiral ganglia was remarkable and indistinguishable for Neurod1 CKO and KO mice ( ) with only a few scattered surviving ganglion neurons near the middle turn of the cochlea ( ). Neurod1-lacZ showed a massive loss of spiral ganglia with some vestibular ganglia in both types of mutants, compared with heterozygotic control mice ( ). In addition to sensory neurons, Neurod1-lacZ was expressed in many hair cells of all sensory epithelia of both CKO and KO mice ( ). In control mice, Neurod1-lacZ expression was also detected in hair cells but with a more prominent expression in the spiral and vestibular ganglia ( ).\n\nAbsence of Neurod1 causes massive reduction and disorganization of innervations\n\nConsistent with the previous study of Neurod1 KO mice (Kim et al. 2001), we found distorted and diminished innervation of the inner ear in Neurod1 CKO mice by using lipophilic dye tracing ( , ) and nerve fiber labeling with anti-tubulin ( , ). Only a few afferent fibers extended to the cochlea of Neurod1 CKO mice ( , ) compared with the dense innervation in control littermates ( , ). Whereas radial fibers were tightly spaced in control mice, both KO and CKO Neurod1 mice had severely reduced radial fibers ( , ). Cochlear innervation was restricted to type I radial fibers to inner hair cells in the apex and base of the Neurod1 KO mice without any recognizable type II fiber projections to outer hair cells. Type II fibers preserved some normal orientation, including the innervation to three rows of outer hair cells, only in the middle turn of this mutant cochlea ( ). In newborn Neurod1 CKO mice, we observed a similar reduction of afferent fibers and incomplete formation of radial fibers ( , ). In both mutants, afferent fibers were comparatively more in the middle turn of the cochlea consistent with the topology of remaining spiral ganglion neurons. The basal part of the middle turn showed some type II fibers, which extended randomly toward the base and apex of the cochlea ( ). The fibers near the basal and apical tip were extremely reduced with only a few collaterals from the middle turn extending along inner hair cells ( , ). In contrast, the apical part of the middle turn ( ) showed numerous disorganized projections to inner and outer hair cells and a disorganization of type II fibers, as recently described in various mutants affecting supporting cell development (Fritzsch et al. 2010; Puligilla et al. 2007).\n\nTo further assess the correlation between the defects in innervations to the reduced number of spiral neurons, we injected dyes into the apex of the cochlea ( ). In wildtype control mice, such injections led at best to efferent fibers going to different parts of the same epithelium and, only in the vestibular system efferent fibers reached nearby sensory epithelia (data not shown). Our injections into the apex labeled unusually projecting type I and type II afferent fibers in the middle turn ( ). Although type II fibers showed some extent of normal trajectory in the upper middle turn, type I fibers had multiple terminal branches in the lower middle turn and apex of the cochlea ( ), rather having single type I fibers innervating single inner hair cells, as in the wildtype. Moreover, in the lower middle turn, type II fibers seemed to be branches of type I fibers, which finally ran as a single fiber to the apical tip ( ). Combined, these data suggest that the remaining innervation of the ear in Neurod1 CKO mice comes about through extensive branching of individual neurons so that type II neurons branch to both the apex and the base, whereas type I neurons reach multiple inner hair cells within the same area and between different parts of the cochlea.\n\nWe have previously shown that the efferent system is severely reduced in the Neurod1 KO mouse (Kim et al. 2001); we obtained similar information in Neurod1 CKO mice ( ). The reduction and disorganization of efferent fibers were closely matching that of afferent fibers consistent with previous data suggesting that the efferent fibers navigate along afferents (Fritzsch et al. 1999). We showed that in control mice, the efferent fibers from the lateral superior olivocochlear nucleus projected to the inner hair cells, which exclusively make contacts with the afferent fibers in the inner hair cells, and that the fibers from the medial olivocochlear nucleus innervate the outer hair cells after crossing the tunnel of Corti ( , insert in d, f, h). Only wildtype efferent fibers exhibited the formation of the intraganglionic spiral bundle (IGSB in ). The efferent fibers in the middle turn of Neurod1 CKO mice projected directly to the inner and outer hair cells following the afferent fibers ( ). However, the base and the apex were innervated by fibers emanating from inner spiral bundles that extended along the inner hair cells or toward the outer hair cells ( ).\n\nConsistent with the retention of the vestibular ganglia, we found a persistence of more profound projections to the vestibular sensory epithelia, which we analyzed by both tubulin immunofluorescence labeling and dye tracing ( ). We found some variability among those remaining fibers. Among the five vestibular sensory epithelia, the saccule was the most affected in terms of fiber reduction ( ). We demonstrated the size reduction of vestibular ganglia and of their survival near adulthood in Neurod1 CKO mice ( ). Canal crista and utricular fibers were also severely disorganized in contrast to those of control littermates ( ). Dye injections in the anterior canal labeled many fibers to the utricle displaying an unusual trajectory parallel to the striola region with both bouton and calyceal endings ( ). Few fibers in the saccule were labeled from the injection in the apex of the cochlea ( ). This mixed peripheral innervation was consistent with the mixed neuron labeling from both vestibular and cochlear nucleus injections ( ). As previously shown in Neurod1 KO mice (Kim et al. 2001), the surviving vestibular and spiral ganglia were displaced from their original position. Our observation in CKO mice revealed that these ganglia were not only displaced, but also remained as mixed ganglia of both vestibular and spiral neurons ( ); this correlates with the lost specificity of topological fiber projection.\n\nIn summary, our data suggest that Tg(Pax2-cre) can effectively recombine floxed Neurod1 early enough in ear development to generate a viable Neurod1 null mouse with an ear phenotype that is nearly identical in terms of loss of spiral afferents presumably through neuronal apoptosis. The Neurod1 CKO mouse can thus be used to assess in depth the phenotype of ear-specific Neurod1 loss after birth without any additional systemic problems related to the absence of insulin. In both KO and CKO of Neurod1, we cannot rule out that additional effects through the local production of Neurod1 expression-mediated proinsulin (Sanchez-Calderon et al. 2007) adds to the Neurod1 phenotype.\n\nLoss of inner ear sensory neurons correlates with expression changes in other bHLH genes\n\nTo assess further the timeline of neuronal loss, we studied the onset of apoptosis in delaminating sensory neurons of E9.5 otocysts with a conditional deletion of Neurod1 ( ). We showed a rapid and complete elimination of the floxed Neurod1 via Cre-mediated recombination by demonstrating absence of any in situ signal for Neurod1 in the Neurod1f/f,Tg(Pax2-cre) mice ( ). Consistent with this early and complete loss of Neurod1, we found an enhanced upregulation of Neurog1 nearly throughout the otocyst ( ). Neurog1 is expressed in the proliferating precursor neuronal cells and is responsible for the formation and delamination of inner ear sensory neurons (Ma et al. 1998) but is rapidly downregulated in differentiating neurons. We observed prominent Neurog1 gene expression in the ventral region of the otic vesicle in E9.5 control mice ( ). We found less intense Neurog1 expression in the ventral region of the Neurod1 CKO otocyst, whereas in the postero-dorsal region, there was an aberrant upregulation of Neurog1 expression, suggesting a negative feedback loop of Neurod1 on Neurog1 (compare ). The reduction in the ventral part of the otocyst could indicate a loss of neuronal precursors attributable to apoptosis in Neurod1 CKO mice. We tested the latter assumption by using an antibody against activated Caspase 3 and found additional labeled cells inside and outside the otocyst in the Neurod1 CKO mice ( ), suggesting an increased cell death of delaminating and intra-otocyst cells in the absence of Neurod1. These data were consistent with a progressive loss of sensory neurons in Neurod1 CKO mice, resulting in a much reduced number of Neurod1-positive neurons ( ).\n\nThe bHLH genes Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 are expressed in all cranial ganglia including the vestibulo-cochlear ganglia and also in cochlear and vestibular hair cells (Kruger et al. 2006). Previous work has demonstrated that Neurog1, Neurod1, and Nhlh1 are involved as a cascade in sensory neurogenesis (Ma et al. 1997). Moreover, Neurod1 and Nhlh1 have been suggested to play redundant roles in the development of vestibular and spiral ganglion neurons (Kruger et al. 2006). To improve our understanding of this aspect of possibly multiple interacting bHLH genes being involved in the differentiation of inner ear sensory neurons, we investigated Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 gene expression in Neurod1 CKO mice by in situ hybridization. In control mice, both Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 were massively expressed in the vestibular and spiral ganglia in the early embryonic stage ( ). Nhlh2 expression remained exclusively in the sensory neurons and was greatly reduced in the mutant spiral ganglion and, to a lesser extent, in the vestibular ganglion ( ). At later stages, Nhlh2 was almost absent in the region of the spiral ganglion but continued to be expressed in a reduced set of vestibular ganglion neurons in Neurod1 CKO mice (data not shown). Likewise, Nhlh1 expression was progressively reduced in these ganglia in the absence of Neurod1 as early as E11.5 ( ). The reduction in Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 expression in sensory neurons of the ear closely followed the progressive reduction of sensory neurons as demonstrated by Neurod1 expression with the β-galactosidase reporter system ( ).\n\nIn combination, these data indicate that a rapid loss of sensory neurons occurs in Neurod1 CKO mice with minor expression changes in Neurog1, indicating a possible feedback loop of Neurod1 on Neurog1, as suggested in the development of the olfactory system (Kawauchi et al. 2004). Both Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 genes might be able to rescue the remaining sensory neurons as previously proposed (Kruger et al. 2006), but additional double-null mutants are required to determine which of the two Nhlh genes is more important for this possible rescue of inner ear sensory neurons in the absence of Neurod1.\n\nIn addition to Nhlh genes, we also observed the expression of Prox1 in Neurod1 CKO mice. Prox1 is expressed in inner ear supporting cells and spiral neurons (Bermingham-McDonogh et al. 2006) and is required for the differentiation of type II spiral neurons, hair cells, and supporting cells (Fritzsch et al. 2010; Kirjavainen et al. 2008). With in situ hybridization, we showed dominant Prox1 expression in the spiral ganglia in wildtype newborn mice ( ), whereas in the mutant, only a few Prox1-positive neurons remained near the modiolus ( ). The downregulation of Prox1 may be involved in the disorganization of cochlear afferents in Neurod1 CKO mice, as recent evidence supports the role of Prox1 in guiding at least the extension of type II spiral fibers (Fritzsch et al. 2010).\n\nAbsence of Neurod1 results in overlapping projections of vestibular and cochlear afferents\n\nUsing lipophilic dye tracing, we have previously demonstrated that vestibular and cochlear afferents develop segregated central projections into the vestibular and cochlear nuclei, respectively, as early as E12.5 (Maklad and Fritzsch 2003). We injected lipophilic dyes in the cochlea and vestibular organs ( ) of Neurod1 CKO mutant mice and showed here, for the first time, that the absence of Neurod1 resulted in overlapping vestibular and cochlear afferent projections to the vestibular and cochlear nuclei ( ). This overlapping central and peripheral projection was consistent with the finding of mixed vestibular and cochlear neurons in the surviving ganglia of Neurod1 CKO mice ( , ). Lipophilic dyes with different chromatic properties were applied to the cochlea and utricle and showed that, as early as E14.5, the vestibular and cochlear fibers were segregated and reached their target nuclei in the brain in control littermates ( ). In contrast, in Neurod1 CKO mice, fibers from both end organs reached the brain as a single nerve that entered through the cochlear nucleus instead of having two divisions ( , ). In E16.5 (data not shown), newborn (P0), and P7 control mice, we demonstrated not only the complete segregation between vestibular and cochlear fibers, but also fibers from the basal and apical region of the cochlea reaching distinct aspects of the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei ( ). In the absence of Neurod1, these fibers displayed no tonotopic organization in the target nuclei, and fibers labeled from vestibular injections overlapped with those from cochlear injections ( ). Moreover, the efferent bundles were also misguided in Neurod1 CKO mice in which some efferent fibers were rerouted and exited with the facial nerve or cochlear nerve, instead of exiting only with the vestibular division (insert in ). This suggests that the absence of a vestibular division results in a rerouting of efferent fibers, which sometimes reach the ear after having exited through the facial nerve ( )\n\nIn Neurod1 CKO mutant mice, vestibular and cochlear afferents not only entered as a single nerve root, but their fibers also projected to both cochlear and vestibular nuclei, respectively, in addition to their original target nuclei projections ( , ). For example, at E14.5, some cochlear fibers were found projecting not only to the DCN and AVCN, but also caudally to the vestibular nuclei and rostrally to the cerebellum ( ). Some vestibular fibers reached the cochlear nuclei, and some projected through the cochlear nuclei to reach vestibular nuclei ( , ). These differential projections of cochlear and vestibular afferents were most apparent in later stages and in coronal sections ( ). Vestibular fibers projected to both vestibular and cochlear nuclei in Neurod1 CKO mice ( , ), whereas these were limited entirely to the vestibular nuclei in control animals ( ). Likewise, cochlear afferents projected exclusively to the cochlear nuclei in wildtype mice ( ), whereas many cochlear afferents projected to vestibular nuclei in Neurod1 CKO mice ( , ). This altered central projection of the vestibulo-cochlear fibers was confirmed by applying dye only to the anterior crista of the inner ear. This labeling showed that the vestibular afferent fibers projected to both the vestibular and cochlear nucleus, rather than being restricted to the vestibular nucleus ( ).\n\nIn summary, these data demonstrate that, in the absence of Neurod1, the cochlear and vestibular fibers fail to segregate and reach distinct parts of their target nuclei ( ). Neurod1 is therefore not only necessary for the survival of most cochlear and many vestibular neurons, but is also required to regulate the expression of genes that allow organ-specific fiber projections such as Brn3a (Huang et al. 2001). Further work with restricted injections to all six sensory organs is in progress to show the lack of segregation among vestibular fibers in more detail.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNeurod1 is essential for neuronal differentiation (Pan et al. 2009) and can convert non-neuronal cells into neurons (Lee et al. 1995) through the regulation of over 500 downstream genes (Seo et al. 2007). We have analyzed the role of Neurod1 in inner ear neurosensory cell development by using a newly generated Neurod1 CKO mouse. Consistent with our previous report (Kim et al. 2001), we have found substantial loss of inner ear sensory neurons and the remaining afferents and efferents are disorganized in Neurod1 CKO mice but not completely absent as previously suggested (Liu et al. 2000). In addition, we have identified a novel role: Neurod1 is required for segregating and organizing central and peripheral projections in the surviving sensory neurons.\n\nNeuron formation of the inner ear depends on a number of bHLH genes (Neurog1, Neurod1, Nhlh1, and Nhlh2). Neurog1 null mice never form neurons and show a reduction of hair cells, suggesting a lineage and some clonal neurosensory relationship (Satoh and Fekete 2005). Neurod1 CKO mutants show loss of spiral and vestibular neurons and truncation of sensory epithelia. Nhlh1 and Neurod1 play a redundant role in the development of sensory neurons in Nhlh1-Neurod1 compound null mice (Kruger et al. 2006). We suggest that residual neurons might survive by compensatory gene activation of Nhlh1 and/or Nhlh2. Crossing our viable Neurod1 CKO mice with existing mutants of both Nhlh1 and Nhlh2 might show that these three genes are necessary for the survival of all inner ear sensory neurons. Clearly, neither Nhlh1 nor Nhlh2 can substitute for Neurod1 to upregulate the program needed for nerve guidance. Neurog1 null mice show no neuronal migration and can be compared with Neurod1 null mice to establish the expression profiles of genes necessary for migration.\n\nNeurod1 is required for segregated projections in the peripheral ear and for proper afferent and efferent organization within sensory epithelia\n\nPrevious work has identified several genes relevant for some aspects of pathfinding of nerve fibers, such as neurotrophins (Tessarollo et al. 2004), POU domain factors (Huang et al. 2001), semaphorins (Gu et al. 2003), Erbb2 (Morris et al. 2006), Slitrk6 (Katayama et al. 2009), Foxg1 (Pauley et al. 2006), and Prox1 (Fritzsch et al. 2010). In addition, defects in supporting cell development affect sensory neuron projections (Puligilla et al. 2007; Shim et al. 2005). Neurod1 is known to lie upstream to Prox1 in the developing hippocampus and is involved in directed growth of neuronal processes (Roybon et al. 2009). Consistent with a possible regulation of Prox1 by Neurod1 in the ear, we have found little Prox1 expression left in only a few sensory neurons in the mutant mouse ( ). The unusual and random fiber growth to the area of outer hair cells ( ) is therefore possibly in part mediated by the downregulation of Prox1, since the Prox1 null phenotype has derailed innervation of outer hair cells (Fritzsch et al. 2010). We have previously shown that Neurod1 regulates the neurotrophin receptor tyrosine kinase Ntrk3, and that the reduction in innervation closely mimics the loss of spiral neurons in Ntf3 and Ntrk3 null mutant mice (Fritzsch et al. 2004). The derailment of peripheral innervation including the unusual branching of what appears to be single fibers will allow us to correlate the Neurod1 phenotype with specific genes with similar defects and ultimately to establish causality comparable with that of Ntrk3 and Prox1.\n\nNeurod1 promoter analysis has revealed many downstream target genes including Prox1, Ntrk3, semaphorin 3a, neuropilin2, plexin A2, Ephb2, Robo1, and Slit2/3, which are directly involved in fiber guidance (Seo et al. 2007). In addition to the role of chemoattractants for fiber growth, the repellents play an equally important role in generating the correct innervation pattern. A class of axon repellents, the semaphorins, prevent the growth of neurons in the dorsal part of otocyst, if the neuropilin receptor is present (Gu et al. 2003). Semaphorin signaling of axon repulsion requires the plexin A2 co-receptor which is expressed in the vestibular and spiral ganglia of developing inner ear (Murakami et al. 2001). Moreover, Slit/Robo signaling can affect axon guidance, axon branching, and neuronal migration (Wong et al. 2002). Ephb2 guides the contralateral efferent growth cones, which show inappropriate pathway selection in the midline with a defect in the vestibular efferent in the absence of Ephb2 (Cowan et al. 2000). The way in which these known and suspected (Fekete and Campero 2007) guidance molecules in the ear depend on Neurod1 requires further investigation. A comparison of Neurod1 with wildtype ears by using deep sequencing might allow to elucidate, in more detail, the expression differences related to the aberrant projections reported here for Neurod1 null mice.\n\nNeurod1 is required for segregated central projection of cochlear and vestibular neurons\n\nWe describe here, for the first time, the disorganization of centrally and peripherally projecting afferents in Neurod1 null mice. In the ear of Neurod1 null mice, individual afferents branch profusely to reach most hair cells despite their highly reduced numbers. This expansion is comparable to the only other case of severe reduction of afferents, the Ntf3 null mouse (Farinas et al. 2001). The exuberant branching of remaining afferents implies that competition with other afferents may normally block such expansion, but a genuine direct effect of Neurod1 is also possible. The efferents are also reduced in Neurod1 CKO mice; the remaining efferents never form the normal intra-ganglionic spiral bundle, and the inner spiral bundle provides branches that run along the inner hair cells.\n\nIn Neurod1 CKO mice, cochlear and vestibular fibers enter the cochlear nucleus as a single bundle, and both cochlear and vestibular fibers project to both cochlear and vestibular nuclei. Neurod1 therefore regulates aspects of central and peripheral branching and pathfinding in sensory neurons. This effect is related to the nerve fibers, not to the Neurod1 expression in the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) (Fritzsch et al. 2006) as Tg (Pax2-cre) do not express in the DCN, thereby cannot eliminate Neurod1 in the DCN. However, even a severe reduction of cochlear nuclei in mutants with conditional deletion of Atoh1 has only minor effects on afferent projections (Maricich et al. 2009). Conditional deletions of Neurod1 at a later stage are now needed to uncouple neuronal survival in the ear from the proposed pathfinding regulation. We demonstrate here that Neurod1 is responsible not only for survival, but also for neuronal differentiation such as the segregation of cochlear and vestibular afferent projections. Indeed, Neurod1 expression in cochlear spiral neurons is, in addition to Gata3 (Karis et al. 2001) and Prox1 (Fritzsch et al. 2010), the only approximately specific marker for spiral neurons.\n\nIn summary, our findings show a more sophisticated action of Neurod1 in the developing ear than the previously suggested simple role in neuronal survival. These data are in line with the 500 genes directly regulated by Neurod1 (Seo et al. 2007), most of which have a known or suspected function in neuronal guidance. More work on putative neuronal guidance genes is now needed in these viable mutants in order to understand the precise way in which Neurod1 can regulate features of inner ear neuronal development including targeted peripheral and central projections that are so disorganized in Neurod1 null mice."
