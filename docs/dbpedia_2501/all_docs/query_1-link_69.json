The cut scene happens and then nothing. My party is still in the maze. Trying again just replays the scene over the old one and I'm still stuck.

This way at least there is one full day people can attend.\n\nLocation\n\nI would suggest either one of these towns:\n\n- Cologne (I am of course totally biased, but there is a reason why all the big conventions are held there)\n\n- London\n\n- Paris\n\n- Maybe Amsterdam or Brussels, but I don't know how stress free traveling there is via public transportation when coming from far away, compared to the first three.\n\nI'd also be down for Munich, Bern, Prague, Berlin, Kopenhagen, Vienna and such, but from what I've seen on the forums so far I think the ones I mentioned above would make most sense. Though a more southern location would probably be more inviting for the folks from Italy.\n\nJust to get this out of the way:\n\nLocations that require you to own a car or take endless bus drives to get to are out of the question.\n\nLodging\n\nOut of experience I can say that two options make sense:\n\n1. Collectively staying at a Hostel for a weekend tends to work rather well.\n\nThey tend to offer large rooms where the guests can hang out and be rather affordable when it comes to beds.\n\nEveryone/ most people staying there over night also means not having to worry about wrapping things up late at night, because everyone is sleeping at the same place anyway.\n\n2. Someone who attends happens to have access to a location that can be used to host bigger groups.\n\nSome people can crash there over night in sleeping bags, everyone who wants more comfort can rent into a nearby hotel or hostel.\n\nProgram\n\nForum meet-ups usually don't have any noteworthy program. Usually people just hang out, in the evening everyone goes out to dinner at a restaurant together and then there'll be partying back at the meeting room which usually involves consumation of large amounts of alcohol, but that is not a requirement of course\n\nI think it would fun to run some small sessions of D&D depending on how many people would attend.\n\nPeople who stated their interest in the meet-up so far:\n\n@Buttercheese @Skatan @RelSundan @abacus @Anduin\n\nPlease note that none of these count as actual commitment.\n\nThe meet-up is purely hypothetical at this point, there is no guarantee that this meet-up will actually happen.\n\nAight, that should sum things up for now.\n\nAlso, this should go without saying but I know you guys too well by now, for those of you who know for a fact that they can not attend because they live too far away/ can't afford the trip: Please don't flood this thread with complaining about how this meet-up should be happening at your place instead. I am not gonna go through the trouble of organising a meet-up that I myself can not attend to. If you wanna do a meet-up in your area please go make your own\n\nAll atendees have to be 18 or older or come with an adult who's liable for them.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nOpinions on Spell Revisions mod\n\nHi all,\n\nI'm planning on starting a new run through the trilogy with a mage main, and wanted to know what people thought about this mod. At first look it seems like this mod nerfs mage characters by weakening many of the class's best spells. Do the spell upgrades for the less-used spells make up for this? Thanks.\n\n↧\n\nAwesome PS:T fan art\n\nUnfortunately there's not a lot of official concept art and promotional art for Planescape: Torment (original or EE).\n\nLuckily, there's some very nice fan art out there to make up for it.\n\nFeel free to post any PS:T related fan art in this thread – be it art that you made yourself, or art that you found online and liked.\n\nIn the latter case, please cite the artist and link to the artwork's \"official\" webpage if it has one (Google Reverse Image Search and TinyEye can help)... It's not only common courtesy to give credit to creators, it also helps readers who want to find out more about an artwork or browse other art by the same artist etc.\n\nHere are some that I found online, and deemed worth showcasing:\n\n\"At the Smoldering Corpse Bar\" by Deusuum [Alex]\n\n\"Planescape Torment\" by Maik Beiersdorf\n\n\"Sigil\" by Samize\n\n\"Torment fanart\" by Chinasky66\n\n\"Fall From Grace\" by eilidh [Eleni Tsami]\n\n\"Dak'kon\" by Grosnus [Michał Sobejko] (Author's deviantart page is offline... )\n\n\"Annah of The Shadows\" by Grosnus [Michał Sobejko]\n\n\"Annah (fan-art/redesign)\" by deadred-art [Michele Chang]\n\n\"lady of pain\" by breath-art [Jian Guo]\n\n↧\n\nAll you wanted to know about the next Beamdog's project\n\nI think the time has come for a new \"All you wanted to know about\" thread.\n\nBrus here suggested we should call it Project Fireball, X,Storm,Severance,Sanctuary,Hurricane,Realm Z,Ivory Plane,Sapphire, Soul Nexus etc. I agree because right now we still haven't heard an official word defining which particular project is in the works.\n\nBut a certain project is indeed in the works, there's no doubt about that.\n\nIn the end of 2015, there was a meeting between Beamdog and WotC, after which plans for the next years became known in-house.\n\nIn December 2015, the main site of Beamdog offered 3 new vacant jobs, with the description that \"more original content is on the horizon.\"\n\nDavid Gaider soon joined the team.\n\nAccording to Andrew Foley, Beamdog are currently (as of April, 2016) further ahead on developing it than they were on SoD in January 2014.\n\nPhillip Daigle said in an interview to RPGamer in March, 2016: \"We'd like to continue working with Wizards of the Coast on Dungeons & Dragons titles. We love D&D and we love making D&D games. At the same time, however, we're also going to be developing our own projects and brands. For now I can't reveal anything, but going forward you'll see both great licensed and original IP projects from Beamdog.\"\n\nhttp://www.rpgamer.com/games/dnd/bgenh/bgenhsodint.html\n\nIt reads that they know already there will be both licensed and original IP projects.\n\nHere're the main versions and evidence presented:\n\nVersion 1. PSTEE (Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition)\n\n1.\n\nIt's a tweet by Trent Oster from March, 2012.\n\n2. \"I've been getting a lot of requests for a revisit of [Planescape:] Torment,\" Cameron Tofer told http://www.shacknews.com/. \"We would love to have the opportunity to do it.\"\n\nIt's a news bit from March, 2012.\n\n3. \"Hmm. We have a Planescape.zip file here that seems to have a bunch of source codey stuff in it ;-)\n\n-Trent\"\n\nIt's a comment by Trent Oster from August, 2012.\n\n4. The IP regarding Planescape: Torment is the property of Hasbro, and we all know Beamdog are good friends of Hasbro.\n\n5. WotC, a subsidiary of Hasbro, \"would absolutely consider licensing out Planescape, or any of their other great D&D IPs, if they were approached with a proposal\".\n\nIt's a quote by WotC from 11/02/2013.\n\nSo, WotC sees Planescape Torment as one of their D&D IPs.\n\n6. \"I'm sure we could add some real value to a PS:T:EE if we were ever able to do it. Make it available on multiple platforms, for instance. It's my favorite game and I hope we get a chance to work on it some day.\"\n\nIt's a comment by Amber Scott from March, 2015.\n\n7. In an AMA from 1 year ago, Trent Oster on the question about enhancing IWD2 or PST, mentioned only Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition: \"besides from having too many colons in the title, is something we are interested in working on\".\n\n8. In a recent interview to Kotaku, Trent Oster admitted (on the possibility of going their own way, making their own universe fantasy universe) that he didn’t want to leave the past behind, not yet.\n\n9. Go to 1:19:30 from the most recent Arv interview with Trent Oster and Phillip Daigle:\n\n10. Buttercheese (Tari Toons) created a doodle based on that moment, which was retweeted by both by Trent Oster and Phillip Daigle:\n\n11. Chris Avellone, a Lead Designer on PST and a Narrative Consultant for SoD, when answering several questions on http://www.rpgcodex.net/ once said:\n\n\"Beamdog and Torment possibility: I'd love to if the chance existed.\"\n\n12. Later this year TToN will be released, which will create a wave of nostalgia for PST, and there probably won't be a better time to release PSTEE.\n\nVersion 2. A new game\n\n1. \"I don't think it's some big secret that we're interested in continuing work on original BG-style games in the future. We love the genre, we love playing the games, and we know how to build them.\n\nIf we were to make an expansion or DLC for an existing game like BG2EE or IWDEE it would retain the same ruleset as the base game.\n\nAny new D&D games that get made would use 5th Edition.\"\n\nIt's a comment by Phillip Daigle from January, 2016.\n\n2. \"our plans for the future. We want to leave the IE-era games in an excellent state and then move on to something more modern eventually.\"\n\nIt's a comment by Phillip Daigle from February, 2016.\n\n3. Andrew Foley in February, 2016, liked this comment:\n\n\"It (PSTEE) would be nice, but at the moment I would rather see new content such as icewind dale 3 , iwd2 ee with a new expansion or a brand new IE game.\"\n\n4. The same quote from the recent interview to Kotaku as in the Version 1:\n\n\"Whereas D&D, I have all that knowledge and if I want some more knowledge I can just go on the internet or pop open a rule book. To me, that’s just the power that D&D has that crafting your own stuff from scratch just cannot have.\" - it could be just pointing to the fact a new game would be based on D&D, it shouldn't specifically be about PSTEE.\n\n5. In April, 2016, David Gaider tweeted this:\n\nAnd Phillip Daigle mentioned that document had something to do with Bhaal:\n\n6. David Gaider is a Creative Director at Beamdog, so it basically means he has much more ideas than content for an EE.\n\nMaybe two projects (an EE of an existing title and a new IP) are being worked on in the same time?\n\nLike a new EE for now and a new IP for the more distant future, so that the situation about SoD sales etc could be more clear:\n\nIn the interview to to RPGamer in March, 2016 Phillip Daigle said: \"We've got lots of ideas for spots in the Baldur's Gate series that could be filled in, but we're waiting to see what the reception to Siege of Dragonspear is like before we commit to anything major. First we need to see what the fans want, then we'll look at what we can deliver. We've also got an eye towards the future. The Infinity Engine was built almost 20 years ago and limits us in a lot of ways. We're actively exploring next-gen technology for some potential future games.\"\n\nVersion 3. Something else (IWD2EE anyone?)\n\n1. In an interview with http://www.pcgamer.com Trent Oster mentioned:\n\n\"Icewind Dale II implemented the 3rd Edition rules and has a completely different UI scheme. We're really not sure how deep those changes run,\" Oster explained. \"The move to 3rd Edition rules would invalidate all the character classes and require a pretty thorough rework of the entire game to bring in the features from our Infinity Plus Engine. At minimum, nightmares abound.\"\n\n2. In an interview with http://venturebeat.com Trent Oster answered this question: \"You talked about “nightmares” about the idea of working on enhanced editions for Icewind Dale II and Planescape: Torment. Is this still the case, or have you made any progress on Icewind Dale II at this point?\"\n\nTrent Oster: \"We’ve yet to really dig into them. Torment is probably the easier of the two as the rules are at least similar. Icewind Dale II had a large deviation due to the move to 3rd Edition D&D rules. We’re still working on Infinity as we wrap up the 1.3 update for BGII. After the holidays, we’ll have more time to dig into the possibilities.\"\n\n3. In the latest AMA an answer on PSTEE or IWD2EE was the same:\n\n\"We don't announce projects in development, but we do love the Infinity Engine and Forgotten Realms and would like to do more work on these games in the future.\"\n\n\"We usually don't comment about games in development, but we have said that we've been building up the capabilities of our team and we love the Forgotten Realms. We'd have to get a concept and bring people on board, but it's something we would love to do in the future.\"\n\n↧\n\nWish spell - is it affected by wisdom higher than 18?\n\nTitle says it all: Does wisdom over 18 have any effect on the options available from the Wish (or Limited Wish) spells? There's a ton on info on the whole wish/wisdom mystery out there, but not this particular bit.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nVynd, drow assassin NPC now available for BG:EE, Tutu and Trilogy.\n\nVYND\n\n“Why leave? Because in the Underdark, there are mind flayers, beholders and aboleths. Up here, there are sheep. And trees. So I weighed things up and I thought, you know what? How bad could a little sunburn possibly be?”\n\nNew download link here, or check out his forum.\n\nLOCATION\n\nBurning Wizard Inn, Beregost.\n\nSTATS\n\nStr: 16\n\nDex: 19\n\nCon: 15\n\nInt: 16\n\nWis: 10\n\nCha: 11\n\nRace: Elf (Drow)\n\nClass: Assassin\n\nAlignment: Neutral Evil\n\nProficiencies: Long Sword, Dart\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\n\"When asked about his past, Vynd wonders aloud how you'd feel if some nosy bastard you barely know asked for your life story. You've pieced together that he's not new to the surface world, and he left the Underdark by choice. Beyond that, he remains a mystery. A snide, abrasive mystery.\"\n\nVynd is found in Beregost looking for work, and seems to consider his presence on the surface a non-issue. He is unashamedly self-interested, with a sometimes acidic, sometimes childish, but always relentless sense of humour.\n\nFEATURES\n\nVynd includes banters with all Bioware NPCs, numerous interjections, a friendship track, and a soundset kindly provided by Icewind Dale.\n\nPlayer-initiated dialogue becomes available after the first timed friendship talk. However, not all dialogue options appear right at the beginning. More conversations are unlocked as the friendship track progresses, so be sure to check back!\n\nSick of reputation management? No worries. Vynd knows that being liked has advantages. Though evil in alignment, he'll stick with you no matter how popular you are, and fits right in with a good-aligned party. Unless it includes Kivan. Be warned. Sadly, this feature is not currently compatible with Enhanced Edition.\n\nHuge thanks to G3 for providing this jerk with a home, to Kulyok for her Branwen BG2 NPC tutorial, to cmorgan for crossplatform code, and to everyone else who's made BG:EE compatible mods. Couldn't have made sense of this mess without you.\n\n↧\n\nPST:EE - Traduzione Condivisa Termini Specifici\n\nTraduzione Condivisa Termini Specifici presenti in Planescape Torment: Enhanced Edition\n\nIn questo thread manterrò un OP costantemente aggiornato con la traduzione che si è scelto di adottare per termini specifici dell'universo di Dungeons & Dragons o per termini ricorrenti nel gioco.

Ratatoskr and I are currently working on a Mazzy expansion mod (All Things Mazzy), but in several months when that's done we are planning on tackling Hexxat.\n\nSo we were wondering what would you like to see changed or added? I probably won't spend much time trying to fix all the bugs with her. If there's a bug you can report it to Beamdog and hopefully they'll fix it in the next patch (I already reported a bug with her stupid Casket).\n\nThe Hexxat mod will have some things already (since they're being put in our Mazzy mod and will be copied into the Hexxat mod as well just with script so they only install once if you have both mods):\n\n1)More people responding to Hexxat drinking Clara and some (like Mazzy or Keldorn) turning hostile and others either leaving, or joining Mazzy and Keldorn if they choose to fight. (Some people leave and you can get them again if you don't have Hexxat, some leave forever, and some won't fight on their own but will join Mazzy and/or Keldorn if they're there and turn hostile).\n\n2) If you kill Hexxat then you can raise Clara (she rejoins your party dead). She's a level 3 Shadowdancer (we're saying she was only a high level before because Hexxat was controlling her. Otherwise her story doesn't really warrant a high level since she's just some peasant turned prostitute turned mediocre thief. But she'll level up fast.) I don't plan on doing much with the Clara NPC in our Mazzy mod as we're busy with Mazzy, but we needed a good resolution for that quest to fit with Mazzy as her character didn't seem like it would be ok with Clara just being eaten and Hexxat joining.\n\n3) In the mod Mazzy and her will also have a scene after Hexxat sneaks out the first night to go drink some peasant girl which Hexxat admits when caught sneaking back in (she's really open about her daily murdering and feeding in all the in-game dialogue). Mazzy objects, which leads to more confrontation. Other than that we're not doing much with Hexxat in this mod since Mazzy and Hexxat are basically incompatible. For Mazzy, Hexxat is just a monster to be destroyed.\n\n4) We have a continuation of Korgan/Hexxat's first banter which involves several more conversations that we felt were more Korganlike. It went in a weird direction and evolves into a strange, somewhat disturbing friendship, but we like it anyways.\n\n5) We plan more expansion of Edwin attempting to get a hold of and use Hexxat's cloak for his own magic, along with her Casque (one of Edwin's life-goals is working out a spell of permanent mental domination so he can create an army of mind-controlled slaves to permanently travel with him).\n\nSo as I said, we will be doing a Hexxat mod in the next six months or so, so whatever else you want to see changed/added to that let me know. The more specific the better. Saying \"I want more dialogue options when talking with Hexxat\" is fine, but if you have specific conversations that really got on your nerves let us know since we'll track them down first when modding. For compatibility reasons I don't plan on destroying and rewriting any of Hexxat's conversations (no matter how much I'm tempted to do so sometimes), but I'm happy to add to a conversation in a compatibility-friendly way, like by giving the PC additional responses that can then take the conversation in a different direction.\n\nAlso if anyone wants to take on the writing for Clara (either now or later) let us know. We're always open to working with a 3rd person on writing provided you want to take her in the same direction we do, and you're willing to let us both edit what you write. We'll be as annoying editing your stuff as we are with each other. I'm happy to code any dialogues and add them into the mod, provided you don't give me any complicated quests or cutscenes to code (they take too much time to code and test given how inexperienced I am, and I'm busy coding Mazzy). But I've got coding dialogues down, so I can code them quickly no matter how convoluted.\n\n↧\n\nNew versions of NearInfinity available\n\nNear Infinity (or short: NI) is an open source cross-platform browser and editor for resources of Infinity Engine games.\n\nDownload latest release\n\nNear Infinity Wiki\n\nSummary of new features:\n\nSupports the following Infinity Engine games, including expansions:\n\nBaldur's Gate\n\nBaldur's Gate II\n\nIcewind Dale\n\nIcewind Dale II\n\nPlanescape: Torment\n\nBaldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition\n\nBaldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear\n\nBaldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition\n\nIcewind Dale: Enhanced Edition\n\nPlanescape Torment: Enhanced Edition\n\nSupports the following fan-made conversions and compilations:\n\nBGTutu and EasyTutu\n\nBaldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)\n\nEnhanced Edition Trilogy (EET)\n\nSupports case-sensitive filesystems (as found on Linux and derivates) without the requirement of tolowered game installations.\n\nDLC support (which is currently used for the \"Siege of Dragonspear\" expansion provided by GOG and Stream)\n\nNative ACM and WAVC sound support (no acm2wav or acmtool required anymore)\n\nNative Ogg Vorbis sound support\n\nNative MVE movie playback support (the movie format used in the original BG1/BG2 and IWD games)\n\nA new area viewer (found in the view tab of each ARE resource entry), featuring:\n\nDay and night maps\n\nSimulation of different daylight lighting conditions\n\nOverlay support (for displaying water, lava, etc.)\n\nVisualization of various map structures (actors, regions, doors, animations, ...)\n\nMap zooming (fixed zoom levels and auto-zoom)\n\nVarious conversion routines (found under the menu Tools->Convert):\n\na powerful BAM Converter\n\nImage to BMP (supports transparency; required for images displayed in BG(2):EE's item descriptions)\n\nImage to MOS\n\nImage to PVRZ\n\nImage to TIS\n\nSyntax highlighting support and selectable color schemes for BCS scripts, GLSL and SQL resources Extended search (found under the menu Search) and many more...\n\nThese are work in progress releases, so you may still find a bug or two, especially in the new features.

Podobny temat napisałem w części anglojęzycznej, ale - zapytam i tu (kto wie, może napisałem niezrozumiale?).\n\nKupiłem sobie BG: EE oraz SoD - i mam takie pytanie. Z tego co widziałem, można w SoD rozpocząć rozgrywkę poprzez załadowanie save z BG - wówczas mamy do dyspozycji swoją drużynę z tego save. Jeśli w drużynie mieliśmy Imoen - jest ona odłączana i coś tam opowiada o tym, że dołączy później, blablabla. Pytanie jest takie: jeśli w BG miałem w drużynie Imoen, wymaksowałem jej poziomy, a potem usunąłem z drużyny przed zrobieniem save z którego skorzystam później aby rozpocząć przygodę w SoD - ta Imoen będzie miała statystyki z mojego save (przecież gdzieś to musi być zapisane, skoro mogę ją znowu przyłączyć do drużyny w BG), czy też gra \"zapomni\" jej poziom i sprzęt i załaduje jakąś tam wersję bazową?\n\nA jeśli nie - to jeśli mam Imoen w drużynie z save - to ta spotkana później w SoD będzie jej odbiciem - czy też będzie to jakaś tam wersja bazowa? Z tego, co ona mówi na początku SoD (włączyłem sobie tylko sam początek - dalej nie grałem, aby sobie nie popsuć rozrywki) - zaczyna się uczyć czarodziejstwa. Czyli zakładam, że jakiś poziom maga mieć musi, nawet jeśli w BG nigdy jej nie dwuklasowaliśmy.\n\nDzięki z góry za odpowiedzi!\n\n↧\n\nDark Horizons unusable items\n\nI love the Dark Horizons mod, but some of the better items in it, like Duragon's Plate+3 and that shield the paladin carries in the Friendly Arm encounter seem to be completely unusable. I thought this might be by design, but some of the items for sale also suffer from this. I've even tried to drag items into editors to find and fix issues, but they still don't work. Should I just look for an earlier version of this mod, and try to replace the items, or they just hopelessly bugged in all versions?\n\n↧\n\nPost Your Battlestations.\n\nAnyone else here into computers? Do you have a cool system you would like to show off or maybe to post your Baldur's gate nest? I just finished tricking mine out and would like to share. I built my computer from scratch and recently added a custom cooling loop to it. I use my computer to build 3DCG cut scenes for personal enjoyment mainly. I am working on a few scenes for a mod that is not BG related. I also use it for video editing, gaming, and internet. I have it hooked up to my home theater so I can do everything from one spot. Pictures of consoles and Home theaters are welcome as well.\n\n↧"
