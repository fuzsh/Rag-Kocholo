        "text": "To celebrate Parental Alienation Awareness Day today, here is a brilliant concise way to say it all in 3 mins! An English-subtitled Brazilian video: A Morte Inventada. It reminds us that Alienation is world-wide. The sincerity of the people, the gender neutrality and the clear child-focus gets this our gold medal.\n\nThis short video is the one to share by email, Facebook or Twitter today with friends, family and work colleagues. It is great because it is really hard to say everything about PA without putting off your listeners. We found it through Ron Berglas who aims to fund a programme on Parental Alienation. Click to see more and donate. Ron produces and hosts a local public service TV show in LA.\n\nThey translate A morte inventada as “Fading away”. But the literal translation is far more powerful: The invented death. If you speak Portuguese, you can watch the full version in parts on Youtube. It would be great to get that with English-subtitles too. Since the trailer is in subtitles anyway, here is the full script with stills of the speakers.\n\nThe Invented Death\n\nSisters: She only spoke ill of him … to a point where they didn’t even speak his name any more. So I did not know my father’s name. … We didn’t have pictures … we didn’t have anything.\n\nDaughter: But I had to share my mother’s fate and if I had a good time with my father, it was like cheating on my mother\n\nProfessional: It is when a parent alters the child’s perception of the other parent and this altering creates hatred.\n\nFather: There were many fathers’ days that I couldn’t be with them, many birthdays that I missed that I couldn’t even talk to them.\n\nSon: My father went many times with an official of justice to try to see us. But we always ran away before he got there.\n\nSister: I went after what really happened – all those stories she told me – how many of them were really true?\n\nProfessional: A child having a “living dead” parent – I mean killing a parent when he is still alive, to kill the image of a father or a mother within life – that is something very complicated for a child to emotionally survive later.\n\nDaughter: And after that I only spoke to him sporadically on the phone to ask for money for many years. … I didn’t see him for 11 years.\n\nOlder man (passionately): Because when you take a loved one from the family circle – without evidence, without proof – you impose one of the most inhuman penalties a father or mother and a family can suffer – especially against the child that could not defend him or herself not even defend his or her father or mother, depending on the case.\n\nSister: I found out that everything I lived and felt through my childhood and teenage years, was a lie that my mother told me.\n\nPost created by Nick Child, Edinburgh"
