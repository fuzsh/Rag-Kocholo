Table,\n\nWith the rentes of Rome, as me best likes;\n\nSenn graithe over the grete se with good men of armes\n\nTo revenge the Renk that on the Rood died!\"\n\nThen this comlich king as cronicles telles,\n\nBounes brothly to bed with a blithe herte;\n\nOff he slinges with sleght and slakes his girdle, 191\n\nAnd for slewth of slomour on a sleep falles.\n\nBut by one after midnight all his mood changed;\n\nHe mette in the morn-while full marvelous dremes;\n\nAnd when his dredful dreme was driven to the ende,\n\nThe king dares for doute, die as he sholde,\n\nSendes after philosophers, and his affray telles:\n\n\"Senn I was formed, in faith, so ferd was I never!\n\nFor-thy ransackes redily and rede me my swevenes,\n\nAnd I shall redily and right rehersen the sooth.\n\n\"Me thought I was in a wood, willed mine one\n\nThat I ne wiste no way whider that I sholde,\n\nFor wolves and wild swine and wicked bestes\n\nWalked in that wastern wathes to seek,\n\nThere lions full lothly licked their tuskes\n\nAll for lapping of blood of my lele knightes!\n\nThrough that forest I fled there flowres were high,\n\nFor to fele me for ferd of tho foul thinges,\n\nMerked to a medow with mountaines enclosed\n\nThe merriest of middle-erthe that men might behold.\n\nThe close was in compass casten all about\n\nWith clover and clerewort cledde even over;\n\nThe vale was enveround with vines of silver,\n\nAll with grapes of gold, greter were never,\n\nEnhorild with arbory and alkins trees,\n\nErberes full honest, and herdes there-under;\n\nAll fruites foddemed was that flourished in erthe,\n\nFair frithed in fraunk upon the free bowes; 192\n\nWas there no danking of dew that ought dere sholde;\n\nWith the drought of the day all dry were the flowres.\n\n\"Then descendes in the dale, down fro the cloudes,\n\nA duchess dereworthily dight in diapered weedes, 193\n\nIn a surcote of silk full selcouthly hewed,\n\nAll with loyotour overlaid low to the hemmes\n\nAnd with ladily lappes the lenghe of a yard,\n\nAnd all redily reversed with rebanes of gold,\n\nWith brouches and besauntes and other bright stones; 194\n\nHer back and her breste was broched all over,\n\nWith kell and with coronal clenlich arrayed,\n\nAnd that so comly of colour one knowen was never.\n\n\"About sho whirled a wheel with her white handes,\n\nOverwhelm all quaintly the wheel, as sho sholde;\n\nThe rowel was red gold with real stones,\n\nRailed with riches and rubies ynow;\n\nThe spekes was splented all with speltes of silver,\n\nThe space of a spere-lenghe springand full fair;\n\nThere-on was a chair of chalk-white silver\n\nAnd checkered with charbocle changing of hewes\n\nUpon the compass there cleved kinges on row,\n\nWith crowns of clere gold that cracked in sonder;\n\nSix was of that settle full sodenlich fallen,\n\nIlk a segge by himself and said these wordes:\n\n'That ever I regned on this roo me rewes it ever!\n\nWas never roy so rich that regned in erthe!\n\nWhen I rode in my rout rought I nought elles\n\nBut rivaye and revel and raunson the pople!\n\nAnd thus I drive forth my dayes whiles I drie might,\n\nAnd therefore derflich I am damned for ever!'\n\n\"The last was a little man that laid was beneth;\n\nHis leskes lay all lene and lothlich to shew,\n\nHis lockes liard and long the lenghe of a yard,\n\nHis lire and his ligham lamed full sore,\n\nThe tone eye of the berne was brighter than silver\n\nThe other was yellower than the yolk of a nay.\n\n\"'I was lord,' quod the lede, 'landes ynow,\n\nAnd all ledes me louted that lenged in erthe.\n\nAnd now is left me no lap my ligham to hele\n\nBut lightly now am I lost, leve eche man the sooth.'\n\n\"The second sir, forsooth, that sewed them after\n\nWas sekerer to my sight and sadder in armes;\n\nOft he sighed unsound and said these wordes:\n\n'On yon see have I sitten als soveraign and lord,\n\nAnd ladies me loved to lap in their armes,\n\nAnd now my lordshippes are lost and laid for ever!'\n\n\"The third thoroughly was thro and thick in the shoulders,\n\nA thro man to thret of there thirty were gadered;\n\nHis diadem was dropped down, dubbed with stones,\n\nEndented all with diamaundes and dight for the nones;\n\n'I was dredde in my dayes,' he said, 'in diverse rewmes,\n\nAnd now damned to the dede, and dole is the more!'\n\n\"The fourt was a fair man and forcy in armes,\n\nThe fairest of figure that formed was ever.\n\n'I was frek in my faith,' he said, 'whiles I on folde regned,\n\nFamous in fer landes and flowr of all kinges;\n\nNow is my face defaded and foul is me happened,\n\nFor I am fallen fro fer and frendles beleved.'\n\n\"The fift was a fairer man than fele of these other,\n\nA forcy man and a fers, with fomand lippes;\n\nHe fanged fast on the feleighes and folded his armes\n\nBut yet he failed and fell a fifty foot large;\n\nBut yet he sprang and sprent and spradden his armes,\n\nAnd on the spere-lenghe spekes he spekes these wordes:\n\n'I was in Surry a Sire and set by mine one\n\nAs soveraign and seinyour of sere kinges landes;\n\nNow of my solace I am full sodenly fallen\n\nAnd for sake of my sin yon sete is me rewed.'\n\n\"The sixt had a sawter seemlich bounden\n\nWith a surepel of silk sewed full fair,\n\nA harp and a hand-sling with hard flint-stones;\n\nWhat harmes he has hent he hallowes full soon:\n\n'I was deemed in my dayes,' he said, 'of deedes of armes\n\nOne of the doughtiest that dwelled in erthe;\n\nBut I was marred on molde in my most strenghes\n\nWith this maiden so mild that moves us all.'\n\n\"Two kinges were climband and claverand on high,\n\nThe erest of the compass they covet full yerne.\n\n'This chair of charbocle,' they said, 'we challenge hereafter,\n\nAs two of the chefest chosen in erthe.'\n\n\"The childer were chalk-white, cheekes and other,\n\nBut the chair aboven cheved they never.\n\nThe furthermost was freely with a front large\n\nThe fairest of fisnamy that formed was ever,\n\nAnd he was busked in a blee of a blew noble\n\nWith flourdelys of gold flourished all over;\n\nThe tother was cledde in a cote all of clene silver,\n\nWith a comlich cross corven of gold;\n\nFour crosselettes crafty by the cross restes\n\nAnd thereby knew I the king, that cristened him seemed.\n\n\"Then I went to that wlonk and winly her greetes,\n\nAnd sho said: 'Welcome, iwis, well art thou founden;\n\nThou ought to worship my will, and thou well couthe,\n\nOf all the valiant men that ever was in erthe,\n\nFor all thy worship in war by me has thou wonnen;\n\nI have been frendly, freke, and fremmed til other. 195\n\nThat thou has founden, in faith, and fele of thy bernes,\n\nFor I felled down Sir Frolle with froward knightes; 196\n\nFor-thy the fruits of Fraunce are freely thine owen.\n\nThou shall the chair escheve, I chese thee myselven,\n\nBefore all the cheftaines chosen in this erthe.'\n\n\"Sho lift me up lightly with her lene handes\n\nAnd set me softly in the see, the septer me reched;\n\nCraftily with a comb sho kembed mine heved,\n\nThat the crispand krok to my crown raught;\n\nDressed on me a diadem that dight was full fair,\n\nAnd senn proffers me a pome pight full of fair stones,\n\nEnameld with azure, the erthe there-on depainted,\n\nCircled with the salt se upon sere halves,\n\nIn sign that I soothly was soveraign in erthe.\n\n\"Then brought sho me a brand with full bright hiltes\n\nAnd bade me braundish the blade: 'The brand is mine owen;\n\nMany swain with the swing has the swet leved,\n\nFor whiles thou swank with the sword it swiked thee never.'\n\n\"Then raikes sho with roo and rest when her liked,\n\nTo the rindes of the wood, richer was never;\n\nWas no pomerie so pight of princes in erthe,\n\nNe none apparel so proud but paradise one.\n\nSho bade the bowes sholde bow down and bring to my handes\n\nOf the best that they bore on braunches so high;\n\nThen they helded to her hest, all holly at ones,\n\nThe highest of ech a hirst, I hete you forsooth.\n\nSho bade me frith not the fruit, but fonde whiles me liked:\n\n'Fonde of the finest, thou freelich berne,\n\nAnd reche to the ripest and riot thyselven.\n\nRest, thou real roy, for Rome is thine owen,\n\nAnd I shall redily roll the roo at the gainest\n\nAnd reche thee the rich wine in rinsed cuppes.'\n\n\"Then sho went to the well by the wood eves,\n\nThat all welled of wine and wonderlich runnes,\n\nCaught up a cup-full and covered it fair;\n\nSho bade me derelich draw and drink to herselven;\n\nAnd thus sho led me about the lenghe of an hour,\n\nWith all liking and love that any lede sholde.\n\n\"But at the mid-day full even all her mood changed,\n\nAnd made much menace with marvelous wordes.\n\nWhen I cried upon her, she cast down her browes:\n\n'King, thou carpes for nought, by Crist that me made!\n\nFor thou shall lose this laik and thy life after;\n\nThou has lived in delite and lordshippes ynow!'\n\n\"About sho whirles the wheel and whirles me under,\n\nTil all my quarters that while were quasht all to peces,\n\nAnd with that chair my chin was chopped in sonder;\n\nAnd I have shivered for chele senn me this chaunce happened.\n\nThus wakened I, iwis, all wery fordremed,\n\nAnd now wot thou my wo; worde as thee likes.\"\n\n\"Freke,\" says the philosopher, \"thy fortune is passed,\n\nFor thou shall find her thy fo; fraist when thee likes!\n\nThou art at the highest, I hete thee forsooth;\n\nChallenge now when thou will, thou cheves no more!\n\nThou has shed much blood and shalkes destroyed,\n\nSakeles, in surquidrie, in sere kinges landes;\n\nShrive thee of thy shame and shape for thine end.\n\nThou has a shewing, Sir King, take keep yif thee like,\n\nFor thou shall fersly fall within five winters.\n\nFound abbeyes in Fraunce, the fruites are thine owen,\n\nFor Frolle and for Feraunt and for thir fers knightes\n\nThat thou fremedly in Fraunce has fey beleved. 197\n\nTake keep yet of other kinges, and cast in thine herte,\n\nThat were conquerours kidd and crowned in erthe.\n\n\"The eldest was Alexander that all the world louted,\n\nThe tother Ector of Troy, the chevalrous gome;\n\nThe third Julius Cesar, that giaunt was holden,\n\nIn eche journee gentle, ajudged with lordes.\n\nThe fourth was Sir Judas, a jouster full noble,\n\nThe masterful Macabee, the mightiest of strenghes;\n\nThe fift was Josue, that jolly man of armes,\n\nThat in Jerusalem host full much joy limped;\n\nThe sixt was David the dere, deemed with kinges\n\nOne of the doughtiest that dubbed was ever,\n\nFor he slew with a sling by sleight of his handes\n\nGolias the grete gome, grimmest in erthe;\n\nSenn endited in his dayes all the dere psalmes\n\nThat in the sawter are set with selcouthe wordes.\n\n\"The tone climand king, I know it forsooth,\n\nShall Karolus be called, the kinge son of Fraunce;\n\nHe shall be cruel and keen and conquerour holden,\n\nCover by conquest contrees ynow;\n\nHe shall encroch the crown that Crist bore himselven,\n\nAnd that lifelich launce that lepe to His herte\n\nWhen He was crucified on cross, and all the keen nailes\n\nKnightly he shall conquer to Cristen men handes.\n\n\"The tother shall be Godfray, that God shall revenge\n\nOn the Good Friday with galiard knightes;\n\nHe shall of Lorraine be lord by leve of his fader\n\nAnd senn in Jerusalem much joy happen,\n\nFor he shall cover the cross by craftes of armes\n\nAnd senn be crowned king with crisom annointed.\n\nShall no dukes in his day such destainy happen,\n\nNe such mischief drie when trewth shall be tried.\n\n\"For-thy Fortune thee fetches to fulfill the number,\n\nAls ninde of the noblest named in erthe;\n\nThis shall in romaunce be redde with real knightes,\n\nReckoned and renownd with riotous kinges,\n\nAnd deemed on Doomesday for deedes of armes,\n\nFor the doughtiest that ever was dwelland in erthe;\n\nSo many clerkes and kinges shall carp of your deedes\n\nAnd keep your conquestes in cronicle for ever.\n\n\"But the wolves in the wood and the wild bestes\n\nAre some wicked men that werrayes thy rewmes,\n\nIs entered in thine absence to werray thy pople,\n\nAnd alienes and hostes of uncouthe landes.\n\nThou gettes tidandes, I trow, within ten dayes,\n\nThat some torfer is tidde senn thou fro home turned.\n\nI rede thou reckon and reherse unresonable deedes\n\nEre thee repentes full rathe all thy rewth workes.\n\nMan, amend thy mood, ere thou mishappen,\n\nAnd meekly ask mercy for meed of thy soul.\"\n\nThen rises the rich king and raght on his weedes,\n\nA red acton of rose, the richest of flowres,\n\nA pesan and a paunson and a pris girdle; 199\n\nAnd on he hentes a hood of scarlet full rich,\n\nA pavis pillion-hat that pight was full fair\n\nWith perry of the Orient and

Gawain grippes his wepen;\n\nAgain that grete batail he graithes him soon,\n\nRadly of his rich sword he rightes the chaines;\n\nIn he shockes his sheld, shuntes he no lenger,\n\nBut all unwise, wodewise, he went at the gainest,\n\nWoundes of those widerwinnes with wrakful dintes;\n\nAll welles full of blood there he away passes;\n\nAnd though him were full wo, he wondes but little,\n\nBut wrekes at his worship the wrath of his lord!\n\nHe stickes steedes in stour and sterenfull knightes,\n\nThat steren men in the stirrupes stone-dede they ligge!\n\nHe rives the rank steel, he rittes the mailes;\n\nThere might no renk him arrest; his resoun was passed!\n\nHe fell in a frensy for fersness of herte;\n\nHe fightes and felles down that him before standes!\n\nFell never fey man such

hoves.\n\nYet Sir Wawain for wo wondes but little,\n\nBut woundes of those widerwinnes with wonderful dintes,\n\nAls he that wolde wilfully wasten himselven,\n\nAnd for wondsome and will all his wit failed,\n\nThat wode als a wild beste he went at the gainest;\n\nAll wallowed on blood there he away passed;\n\nIch a wye may be ware by wreke of another! 219\n\nThen he moves to Sir Mordred among all his knightes,\n\nAnd met him in the mid-sheld and malles him through,\n\nBut the shalk for the sharp he shuntes a little;\n\nHe share him on the short ribbes a shaftmond large.\n\nThe shaft shuddered and shot in the shire berne\n\nThat the sheddand blood over his shank runnes\n\nAnd shewed on his shin-bawde that was shire burnisht!\n\nAnd so they shift and shove he shot to the erthe,\n\nWith the lush of the launce he light on his shoulders\n\nAn acre-lenghe on a laund full lothly wounded.\n\nThen Gawain gird to the gome and on the grouf falles;\n\nAll his gref was graithed; his grace was no

with his rout, restes he no lenger,\n\nFor rade of our rich king, rive that he sholde.\n\nThen kaires he to Cornwall, care-full in herte,\n\nBecause of his kinsman that on the coste ligges;\n\nHe tarries trembland ay, tidandes to herken.\n\nThen the traitour treunted the Tuesday there-after,\n\nTrines in with a trayn tresoun to work,\n\nAnd by the Tamber that tide his tentes he reres,\n\nAnd then in a mett-while a messanger he sendes\n\nAnd wrote unto Waynor how the world changed\n\nAnd what comlich coste the king was arrived,\n\nOn flood foughten with his fleet and felled them o

encircled about, 221\n\nAnd Sir Gawain the good in his gay armes,\n\nUmbegripped the gers and on grouf fallen,\n\nHis banners braiden down, beten of gules,\n\nHis brand and his brode sheld all bloody

lastes,\n\nTil Drighten and derf dede have done what them likes!\"\n\nThen caught they up the corse with care at their hertes,\n\nCarried it on a courser with the king selven;\n\nThe way unto Winchester they went at the gainest,\n\nWery and wandsomly with wounded knightes;\n\nThere come the prior of the place and professed monkes,\n\nA-pas in procession, and with the prince meetes,\n\nAnd he betook them the corse of the knight noble:\n\n\"Lookes it be clenly keeped,\" he said, \"and in the kirk holden;\n\nDon for him diriges, as to the dede falles,\n\nMensked with masses for meed of the soul;\n\nLook it want no wax, ne no worship elles,\n\nAnd that the body be baumed and on erthe holden;\n\nYif thou keep thy covent, encroch any worship\n\nAt my coming again, yif Crist will it thole;\n\nAbide of the burying til they be brought under\n\nThat has wrought us this wo and this war moved.\"\n\nThen says Sir Wichere the wye, a wise man of armes:\n\n\"I rede ye warily wend and workes the best,\n\nSujourn in this citee and semble thy bernes,\n\nAnd bide with thy bold men in the burgh rich;\n\nGet out knightes of countrees that castels holdes, 223\n\nAnd out of garrisons grete good men of armes,\n\nFor we are faithly too few to fight with them all\n\nThat we see in his sorte upon the se bankes.\n\nWith cruel countenaunce then the king carpes these wordes:\n\n\"I pray thee care not, sir knight, ne cast thou no dredes!\n\nHad I no segge but myself one under sun,\n\nAnd I may him see with sight or on him set handes,\n\nI shall even among his men malle him to dede,\n\nEre I of the stede stir half a steed lenghe!\n\nI shall strike him in his stour and stroy him forever,\n\nAnd there-to make I mine avow devotly to Crist\n\nAnd to his moder Mary, the mild Queen of heven!\n\nI shall never sujourn sound, ne saught at mine herte,\n\nIn citee ne in suburb set upon erthe,\n\nNe yet slomour ne sleep with my slow eyen,\n\nTil he be slain that him slogh, if any sleight happen,\n\nBut ever persew the paganes that my pople destroyed\n\nWhiles I may pare them and pinne in place there me likes.\"\n\nThere durst no renk him arrest of all the Round Table,\n\nNe none pay that prince with plesand wordes,\n\nNe none of his lege-men look him in the eyen,\n\nSo lordly he lookes for loss of his knightes!\n\nThen drawes he to Dorset and dreches no lenger,\n\nDref-ful, dredless, with droopand teres,\n\nKaires into Cornwall with care at his herte;\n\nThe trace of the traitour he trines full even,\n\nAnd turnes in by the Trentis the traitour to seek,\n\nFindes him in a forest the Friday there-after;\n\nThe king lightes on foot and freshly ascries,\n\nAnd with his freelich folk he has the feld nomen!\n\nNow isshewes his enmy under the wood eves\n\nWith hostes of alienes full horrible to shew!\n\nSir Mordred the Malbranche, with his much pople,\n\nFoundes out of the forest upon fele halves,\n\nIn seven grete batailes seemlich arrayed,\n\nSixty thousand men - the sight was full huge -\n\nAll fightand folk of the fer landes,\n\nFair fitted on front by tho fresh strandes.\n\nAnd all Arthurs host was amed with knightes\n\nBut eighteen hundreth of all, enterd in rolles.\n\nThis was a match un-mete, but mightes of Crist,\n\nTo melle with that multitude in those main landes.\n\nThen the royal roy of the Round Table\n\nRides on a rich steed, arrayes his bernes,\n\nBuskes his avauntward, als him best likes;\n\nSir Ewain and Sir Errak, and other grete lordes\n\nDemenes the middle-ward menskfully there-after,\n\nWith Merrak and Meneduke, mighty of strenghes;\n\nIdrous and Alymer, thir avenaunt children,\n\nAyers with Arthur with seven-score of knightes;\n\nHe rewles the rereward redyly there-after,\n\nThe rekenest redy men of the Round Table;\n\nAnd thus he fittes his folk and freshly ascries,\n\nAnd senn comfortes his men with knightlich wordes:\n\n\"I beseek you, sirs, for sake of our Lord,\n\nThat ye do well today and dredes no wepen!\n\nFightes fersly now and fendes yourselven,\n\nFelles down yon fey folk, the feld shall be ours!\n\nThey are Sarazenes, yon sorte, unsound mot they worthe!\n\nSet on them sadly for sake of our Lord!\n\nYif us be destained to die today on this erthe,\n\nWe shall be heved unto heven ere we be half cold!\n\nLook ye let for no lede lordly to work;\n\nLayes yon laddes low by the laike end;\n\nTake no tent unto me, ne tale of me recke;\n\nBes busy on my banners with your bright wepens,\n\nThat they be strenghely stuffed with steren knightes\n\nAnd holden lordly on-loft ledes to shew;\n\nYif any renk them arase, rescue them soon;\n\nWorkes now my worship; today my war endes!\n\nYe wot my wele and my wo; workes as you likes!\n\nCrist comly with crown comfort you all\n\nFor the kindest creatures that ever king led!\n\nI give you all my blessing with a blithe will,\n\nAnd all Bretons bold, blithe mot ye worthe!\"\n\nThey pipe up at prime time, approches them ner,\n\nPris men and preste proves their strenghes;\n\nBremly the brethe-men bragges in trumpes,\n\nIn coronettes comlyly, when knightes assembles;\n\nAnd then jollyly enjoines these gentle knightes;nobr>\n\nA jollier journee ajudged was never,\n\nWhen Bretones boldly enbraces their sheldes,\n\nAnd Cristen encrossed them and castes in fewter! 224\n\nThen Sir Arthur host his enmy escries,\n\nAnd in they shock their sheldes, shuntes no lenger,\n\nShot to the sheltrones and shoutes full high;\n\nThrough sheldes full sheen shalkes they touch!\n\nRedily those rydde men of the Round Table\n\nWith real rank steel rittes their mailes;\n\nBrenyes brouden they brist and burnisht helmes,\n\nHewes hethen men down, halses in sonder!\n\nFightand with fine steel the fey blood runnes;\n\nOf the frekkest on front un-fers are beleved.\n\nHethenes of Argyle and Irish kinges\n\nEnverounes our avauntward with venomous bernes,\n\nPeghtes and paynimes with perilous wepens,\n\nWith speres dispitously despoiles our knightes\n\nAnd hewed down the hendest with hertly dintes!\n\nThrough the hole batail they holden their wayes;\n\nThus fersly they fight upon sere halves,\n\nThat of the bold Bretons much blood spilles;\n\nThere durst none rescue them for riches in erthe,\n\nThe steren were there so stedde and stuffed with other;\n\nHe durst not stir a step, but stood for himselven,\n\nTil three stales were stroyed by strenghe of him one!\n\n\"Idrous,\" quod Arthur, \"ayer thee behooves!\n\nI see Sir Ewain over-set with Sarazenes keen!\n\nRedy thee for rescues, array thee soon!\n\nHie thee with hardy men in help of thy fader!\n\nSet in on the side and succour yon lordes!\n\nBut they be succoured and sound, unsaught be I ever!\"\n\nIdrous him answers ernestly there-after:\n\n\"He is my fader, in faith, forsake shall I never -\n\nHe has me fostered and fed and my fair brethern -\n\nBut I forsake this gate, so me God help,\n\nAnd soothly all sibreden but thyself one.\n\nI broke never his bidding for berne on life,\n\nBut ever buxom as beste blithely to work.\n\nHe commaund me kindly with knightly wordes,\n\nThat I sholde lely on thee lenge, and on no lede elles;\n\nI shall his commaundment hold, if Crist will me thole!\n\nHe is elder than I, and end shall we bothen;\n\nHe shall ferk before, and I shall come after;\n\nYif him be destained to die today on this erthe,\n\nCrist, comly with crown, take keep to his soul!\"\n\nThen romes the rich king with rewth at his herte,\n\nHeves his handes on height and to the Heven lookes:\n\n\"Why then ne had Drighten destained at His dere will 225\n\nThat He had deemed me today to die for you all?\n\nThat had I lever than be lord all my life-time\n\nOf all that Alexander ought whiles he in erthe lenged!\"\n\nSir Ewain and Sir Errak, these excellent bernes,\n\nEnters in on the host and egerly strikes;\n\nThe hethenes of Orkney and Irish kinges\n\nThey gobone of the gretest with grounden swordes,\n\nHewes on those hulkes with their hard wepens,\n\nLayed down those ledes with lothly dintes;\n\nShoulders and sheldes they shrede to the haunches,\n\nAnd middles through mailes they merken in sonder!\n\nSuch honour never ought none erthly kinges\n\nAt their ending day but Arthur himselven!\n\nSo the drought of the day dryed their hertes\n\nThat both drinkless they die; dole was the more!\n\nNow melles our middle-ward and mengen togeder.\n\nSir Mordred the Malbranche with his much pople,\n\nHe had hid him behind within these holt eves,\n\nWith hole batail on hethe, harm is the more!\n\nHe had seen the contek all clene to the end,\n\nHow our chevalry cheved by chaunces of armes;\n\nHe wiste our folk was for-foughten that there was fey leved;\n\nTo encounter the king he castes him soon,\n\nBut the cherles chicken had changed his armes;\n\nHe had soothly forsaken the sauturour engreled,\n\nAnd laght up three lions all of white silver,\n\nPassand in purpure of perry full rich, 226\n\nFor the king sholde not know the cautelous wretch.\n\nBecause of his cowardice he cast off his attire;\n\nBut the comlich king knew him full swithe,\n\nCarpes to Sir Cador these kindly wordes:\n\n\"I see the traitour come yonder trinand full yerne;\n\nYon lad with the lions is like to himselven;\n\nHim shall torfer betide, may I touch ones,\n\nFor all his tresoun and trayn, als I am trew lord!\n\nToday Clarent and Caliburn shall kithe them togeders\n\nWhilk is keener of carfe or harder of edge!\n\nFraist shall we fine steel upon fine weedes.\n\nIt was my darling dainteous and full dere holden, 227\n\nKeeped for encrownmentes of kinges annointed;\n\nOn dayes when I dubbed dukes and erles\n\nIt was burlich borne by the bright hiltes;\n\nI durst never dere it in deedes of armes\n\nBut ever keeped clene because of myselven.\n\nFor I see Clarent uncledde that crown is of swordes,\n\nMy wardrope at Walingford I wot is destroyed.\n\nWiste no wye of wonne but Waynor herselven;\n\nSho had the keeping herself of that kidd wepen,\n\nOf coffers enclosed that to the crown longed,\n\nWith ringes and relickes and the regale of Fraunce\n\nThat was founden on Sir Frolle when he was fey leved.\"\n\nThen Sir Marrak in malencoly meetes him soon,\n\nWith a malled mace mightyly him strikes;\n\nThe bordour of his bacenett he bristes in sonder,\n\nThat the shire red blood over his breny runnes!\n\nThe berne blenkes for bale and all his blee changes,\n\nBut yet he bides as a bore and bremly he strikes!\n\nHe braides out a brand bright als ever any silver\n\nThat was Sir Arthur owen, and Utere his faders,\n\nIn the wardrope at Walingford was wont to be keeped;\n\nTherewith the derf dog such dintes he reched\n\nThe tother withdrew on dregh and drust do none other\n\nFor Sir Marrak was man marred in elde,\n\nAnd Sir Mordred was mighty and in his most strenghes;\n\nCome none within the compass, knight ne none other,\n\nWithin the swing of sword, that he ne the swet leved. 228\n\nThat perceives our prince and presses to fast,\n\nStrikes into the stour by strenghe of his handes,\n\nMeetes with Sir Mordred; he meles unfair:\n\n\"Turn, traitour untrew, thee tides no better;\n\nBy grete God, thou shall die with dint of my handes!\n\nThee shall rescue no renk ne riches in erthe!\"\n\nThe king with Caliburn knightly him strikes;\n\nThe cantel of his clere sheld he carves in sonder,\n\nInto the shoulder of the shalk a shaftmonde large\n\nThat the shire red blood shewed on the mailes!\n\nHe shuddered and shrinkes and shuntes but little,\n\nBut shockes in sharply in his sheen weedes;\n\nThe felon with the fine sword freshly he strikes,\n\nThe felettes of the ferrer side he flashes in sonder,\n\nThrough jupon and gesseraunt of gentle mailes,\n\nThe freke fiched in the flesh an half-foot large;\n\nThat derf dint was his dede, and dole was the more\n\nThat ever that doughty sholde die but at Drightens will!\n\nYet with Caliburn his sword full knightly he strikes,\n\nCastes in his clere sheld and coveres him full fair,\n\nSwappes off the sword hand, als he by glentes -\n\nAn inch fro the elbow he oched it in sonder\n\nThat he swoones on the swarth and on swim falles -\n\nThrough bracer of brown steel and the bright mailes,\n\nThat the hilt and the hand upon the hethe ligges.\n\nThen freshlich the freke the fente up-reres,\n\nBroches him in with the brand to the bright hiltes,\n\nAnd he brawles on the brand and bounes for to die.\n\n\"In faye,\" said the fey king, \"sore me for-thinkes\n\nThat ever such a false thef so fair an end haves.\"\n\nWhen they had finisht this fight, then was the feld wonnen,\n\nAnd the false folk in the feld fey are beleved!\n\nTil a forest they fled and fell in the greves,\n\nAnd fers fightand folk followes them after,\n\nHuntes and hewes down the hethen tikes,\n\nMurtheres in the mountaines Sir Mordred knightes;\n\nThere chaped never no child, cheftain ne other,\n\nBut choppes them down in the chase; it charges but little!\n\nBut when Sir Arthur anon Sir Ewain he findes,\n\nAnd Errak the avenaunt and other grete lordes,\n\nHe caught up Sir Cador with care at his herte,\n\nSir Clegis, Sir Cleremond, these clere men of armes,\n\nSir Lot and Sir Lionel, Sir Launcelot and Lowes,\n\nMarrak and Meneduke, that mighty were ever;\n\nWith langour in the land there he layes them togeder,\n\nLooked on their lighames, and with a loud steven,\n\nAls lede that list not live and lost had his mirthes -\n\nThen he stotays for mad and all his strenghe failes,\n\nLookes up to the lift and all his lire changes,\n\nDown he sways full swithe, and in a swoon falles,\n\nUp he coveres on knees and cries full often -\n\n\"King, comly with crown, in care am I leved!\n\nAll my lordship low in land is laid under,\n\nThat me has given guerdones, by grace of Himselven,\n\nMaintained my manhed by might of their handes,\n\nMade me manly on molde and master in erthe,\n\nIn a teenful time this torfer was rered,\n\nThat for a traitour has tint all my trew lordes!\n\nHere restes the rich blood of the Round Table,\n\nRebuked with a rebaud, and rewth is the more!\n\nI may helpless on hethe house by mine one,\n\nAls a woful widow that wantes her berne!\n\nI may werye and weep and wring mine handes,\n\nFor my wit and my worship away is forever!\n\nOf all lordshippes I take leve to mine end!\n\nHere is the Bretones blood brought out of life,\n\nAnd now in this journee all my joy endes!\"\n\nThen relies the renks of all the Round Table;\n\nTo the real roy they ride them all;\n\nThen assembles full soon seven score knightes\n\nIn sight to their soveraign that was unsound leved;\n\nThen kneeles the crowned king and cries on loud:\n\n\"I thank thee, God, of thy grace, with a good will,\n\nThat gave us vertue and wit to venquish these bernes,\n\nAnd us has graunted the gree of these grete lordes!\n\nHe sent us never no shame ne shenship in erthe\n\nBut ever yet the over-hand of all other kinges;\n\nWe have no leisere now these lordes to seek,\n\nFor yon lothly lad me lamed so sore!\n\nGraith us to Glashenbury; us gaines none other; 229\n\nThere we may rest us with roo and ransack our woundes.\n\nOf this dere day work the Drighten be lowed,\n\nThat us has detained and deemed to die in our owen.\"\n\nThen they hold at his hest holly at ones,\n\nAnd graithes to Glashenbury the gate at the gainest;\n\nEntres the Ile of Avalon and Arthur he lightes,\n\nMerkes to a manor there, for might he no further;\n\nA surgen of Salerne enserches his woundes;\n\nThe king sees by assay that sound bes he never,\n\nAnd soon to his seker men he said these wordes:\n\n\"Do call me a confessor with Crist in his armes;\n\nI will be houseld in haste what hap so betides.\n\nConstantine my cosin he shall the crown bere,\n\nAls becomes him of kind, if Crist will him thole!\n\nBerne, for my benison, thou bury yon lordes\n\nThat in batail with brandes are brought out of life,\n\nAnd sithen merk manly to Mordred children,\n\nThat they be slely slain and slongen in waters;\n\nLet no wicked weed wax ne writhe on this erthe;\n\nI warn, for thy worship, work als I bid!\n\nI forgive all gref, for Cristes love of heven!\n\nIf Waynor have well wrought, well her betide!\"\n\nHe said \"In manus\" with main on molde where he ligges, 230\n\nAnd thus passes his spirit and spekes he no more!\n\nThe baronage of Bretain then, bishoppes and other,\n\nGraithes them to Glashenbury with glopinand hertes\n\nTo bury there the bold king and bring to the erthe\n\nWith all worhsip and welth that any wye sholde.\n\nThroly belles they ring and Requiem singes,\n\nDos masses and matins with mornand notes;\n\nReligious reveste in their rich copes,\n\nPontificalles and prelates in precious weedes,\n\nDukes and douspeeres in their dole-cotes,\n\nCountesses kneeland and claspand their handes,\n\nLadies languishand and lowrand to shew;\n\nAll was busked in black, birdes and other,\n\nThat shewed at the sepulture with syland teres;\n\nWas never so sorrowful a sight seen in their time!\n\nThus endes King Arthur, as auctors allege,\n\nThat was of Ectores blude, the kinge son of Troy\n\nAnd of Sir Priamous, the prince, praised in erthe;\n\nFro thethen brought the Bretons all his bold elders\n\nInto Bretain the brode, as the Brut telles.\n\nHic jacet Arthurus, rex quondam rexque futurus.\n\n(Here lies Arthur, king once and king to be.)\n\nHere endes Morte Arthure, written by Robert of Thornton\n\nR. Thornton dictus qui scripsit sit benedictus. Amen.\n\n(May the said R. Thornton, who wrote this, be blessed. Amen.)"
