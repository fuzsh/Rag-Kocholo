Played PS:T a few months ago (not finished yet, got distracted) and I didn't even think about it. Too much exposition or what? I found the mortuary pretty fascinating, just like bascially everything about the game world. I went into PS:T knowing it was a a text heavy game and that was that. If you don't like reading and have no attention-span you shouldn't play the game. Its like going into Wizardry and complaining about the combat or going into Dragon Age and complaining about the gay sex.\n\nI know its probably an age old discussion for you guys but can someone enlighten me what the problem with the Mortuary is supposed to be?

By the time I left the mortuary, the hooks were in really deep.\n\nThe Mortuary was one of the best openings for a game IMO. Mysteries, challenged expectations, wierdness, characters that jump off the screen. I knew the game was for me right then and there. (I was young and impressionable, but zombies that were nice? some you could talk to? extracting stuff from their mouths (or was it their head)!? ultimately empathizing with those things you thought you had to kill? That's the good shit right there!)\n\nThe off-putting stuff for me was the D&D system, it was really incongruent with the gameplay. There's a game about talking and mysteries, and I have to care about THAC0, classes, multiclassing limitations, etc.? I'd rather the character system was about beliefs, personality and relationships that build over time, with maybe skills, starting blank. But then that system baggage was mandatory with the setting (and a selling point).\n\nMortuary needs to be populated with high pitched voiced nurses with multitude of colorful hairs and carry a giant syringe while wearing a nurse outfit, preferably with an elegant top and skirt before it becomes palatable to the mainstream crowd.\n\nTNO also needs to be younger cause immortals don't age. Also, Morte needs to be more of a familiar cat/dog/dragon or mini-succubi instead of a floating skull that has no distinguishing features.\n\nI don't know about you, but many people would be triggered easily by a flying, talking skull.\n\nPerhaps people would be more engaged if Morte made TNO kill 10 of those zombies before advancing the MQ. There could be a little map in one of the topmost corner with a little radar showing which shambling NPCs are the zombies.\n\nEDIT: Come to think of it, there should be something near the edge of the screen that tracks how many zombies the player has killed so they know when the first quest is done.\n\nMortuary needs to be populated with high pitched voiced nurses with multitude of colorful hairs and carry a giant syringe while wearing a nurse outfit, preferably with an elegant top and skirt before it becomes palatable to the mainstream crowd.\n\nTNO also needs to be younger cause immortals don't age.

You are stopping halfway through. Planescapte: Torment should take place in high school and begin with TNO waking up in the nurse's office. Morte should obviously be a cute girl.\n\nAre you guys ripping off weaboo game tropes?\n\nI've never played one so those jokes go over my head."
