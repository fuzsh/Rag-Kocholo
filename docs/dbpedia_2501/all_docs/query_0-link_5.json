        "text": "Chris Avellone who worked on Fallout 2 and now works for Obsidian has updated his blog with a question and answer session all related to game design. Most of it mentions things about RPG character design. Of note:\n\n<blockquote>4. a) Who has been your favorite character (of all the characters you have worked on) to develop and why?\n\nMorte and Fall-From-Grace in Torment, Myron in Fallout 2 (he was the first full companion I'd ever done) followed by Cassidy (the second), then Kreia in Knights of the Old Republic II.\n\nJust about every character I've worked on, though, has \"moments\" that I've really enjoyed scripting for them (writing HK-47's definition of love, or the Handmaiden's Echani philosophy of combat, how Atton obsesses over Pazaak to prevent his thoughts from being picked up by Jedi, or Visas Marr's feelings for your character).</blockquote>\n\nYou can read it all here at Chris Avellone's blog.\n\nThere is not enough stuff in the news, that can be used for rage against Bethesda and stupid todays-games! :>\n\nBut you are not alone, german Fallout community is very silent too.\n\nI hope, our Mister Avellone will write more cool stuff in future, because it always inspire me while working on my Shattered Destiny 2 mod. In fact, it's the reason why I am overthinking a lot story- and character related stuff right now.\n\nOnozuka Komachi said:\n\nI for one can't believe this news isn't getting more commentary. The man knows what he's talking about and has the same tastes I do.\n\nGames are what matters. If he's not working on some awesome shit, no comments for him, no siree.\n\nMorbus said:\n\nOnozuka Komachi said:\n\nI for one can't believe this news isn't getting more commentary. The man knows what he's talking about and has the same tastes I do.\n\nGames are what matters. If he's not working on some awesome shit, no comments for him, no siree.\n\nWas he... was he being facetious?\n\nAnyways, anyone who worked on PS:T and FO is good in my book.\n\nYellow said:\n\nMorbus said:\n\nOnozuka Komachi said:\n\nI for one can't believe this news isn't getting more commentary.

If he's not working on some awesome shit, no comments for him, no siree.\n\nWas he... was he being facetious?\n\nHe? Who? Me? Yes, of course.\n\nMyron rocks. Each time I play FO2 he's on my team. He's just so goddamn annoying it grows on you. And he's actually not too bad in battle when you keep him doped up and give him ample time to recover.\n\nSuAside said:\n\nMorte is just... awesome.\n\nbut Myron as one of his favs? odd.\n\nwhile a decently worked out character, he was also very fucking annoying as far as i'm concerned.\n\nThat means he's awesome. The worst characters are those you don't care about (AKA Fallout 3's cast)."
