        "text": "Welcome to Story driven Games OT!\n\nYou ask why did I create this OT? I'm a huge sucker for story rich games, narrative experiences, walking sims, visual novels etc. If it has great story, engaging characters, captivating narration, I've played it or I will definitely play it (and I hope that you'll play it too!)\n\nThere's one thing that I enjoy even more - finishing these games and sharing freshly formed emotions & opinions with other people. These games can have long-lasting impacts and it would be a big shame to not share these experiences with others.\n\nThere will be 2 (at least in the beginning) constantly updated sections in this thread:\n\nNotable releases this month – I'll monthly scour depths of Steam and other stores to search for intereseting story driven games you might haven't heard about it.\n\nGame of the month – usually biggest release of month to drive discussion as much as possible.\n\nWe are a community and this thread should be teamwork. Advices, recommendations, critique and anything else that comes to your mind are not just highly appreaciated but encouraged.\n\nThere are only two rules:\n\nGeneral ERA rules which you can find here https://www.resetera.com/threads/general-faq.9777/\n\nWe are all friends here to have a healthy discussion and enjoy our time here. Please leave hostility, hatred, insults and personal attacks away from this thread.\n\nRecommendations for newcomers\n\nPlanescape: Torment\n\n\"What can change the nature of a man?\"\n\nYou are the Nameless One, a hulking figure covered in scars and tattoos collected over the course of countless lives—none of which you can remember, but are now coming back to haunt you. You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking The Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself.\n\nPortals riddle the planar metropolis of Sigil, providing access to anywhere in existence, but only if you have the proper key. Known as the \"City of Doors,\" Sigil is a neutral ground where demons, devas, and races from across the multiverse gather under the watchful shadow of the Lady of Pain, the city's enigmatic ruler. This is a place where the word is mightier than the sword, where thought defines reality, and belief has the power to reshape worlds.\n\nSOMA\n\nThe radio is dead, food is running out, and the machines have started to think they are people. Underwater facility PATHOS-II has suffered an intolerable isolation and we're going to have to make some tough decisions. What can be done? What makes sense? What is left to fight for?\n\nEnter the world of SOMA and face horrors buried deep beneath the ocean waves. Delve through locked terminals and secret documents to uncover the truth behind the chaos. Seek out the last remaining inhabitants and take part in the events that will ultimately shape the fate of the station. But be careful, danger lurks in every corner: corrupted humans, twisted creatures, insane robots, and even an inscrutable omnipresent A.I.\n\nBastion\n\nBastion is an action role-playing experience that redefines storytelling in games, with a reactive narrator who marks your every move. Explore more than 40 lush hand-painted environments as you discover the secrets of the Calamity, a surreal catastrophe that shattered the world to pieces. Wield a huge arsenal of upgradeable weapons and battle savage beasts adapted to their new habitat. Finish the main story to unlock the New Game Plus mode and continue your journey!\n\nThe Last of Us\n\n20 years after a pandemic has radically changed known civilization, infected humans run wild and survivors are killing each other for food, weapons; whatever they can get their hands on. Joel, a violent survivor, is hired to smuggle a 14 year-old girl, Ellie, out of an oppressive military quarantine zone, but what starts as a small job soon transforms into a brutal journey across the U.S.\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt | Hearts of Stone | Blood & Wine\n\nTrained from early childhood and mutated to gain superhuman skills, strength and reflexes, witchers are a distrusted counterbalance to the monster-infested world in which they live.\n\nPlay as professional monster hunter, Geralt of Rivia, tasked with finding a child of prophecy in a vast open world rich with merchant cities, viking pirate islands, dangerous mountain passes, and forgotten caverns to explore.\n\nNight in the Woods\n\nCollege dropout Mae Borowski returns home to the crumbling former mining town of Possum Springs seeking to resume her aimless former life and reconnect with the friends she left behind. But things aren't the same. Home seems different now and her friends have grown and changed. Leaves are falling and the wind is growing colder. Strange things are happening as the light fades.\n\nAnd there's something in the woods...\n\nLife is Strange\n\nFollow the story of Max Caulfield, a photography senior who discovers she can rewind time while saving her best friend Chloe Price.\n\nThe pair soon find themselves investigating the mysterious disappearance of fellow student Rachel Amber, uncovering a dark side to life in Arcadia Bay. Meanwhile, Max must quickly learn that changing the past can sometimes lead to a devastating future.\n\nThe House in Fata Morgana (recommended by BoukObelisk)\n\nYou awaken in a decrepit old mansion.\n\nA woman with eyes of jade stands before You, informing You that You are the Master of the house, and she Your Maid. However, You have no memories, no concept of self—or, indeed, any certainty that You are even alive.\n\nThe Maid invites You to join her on a journey through the mansion's lifeless halls, to behold the numerous tragedies that have befallen its residents. She suggests that among them, perhaps You will find some trace of Yourself.\n\nSilent Hill 2 (recommended by BoukObelisk)\n\nSilent Hill 2 follows James Sunderland, whose life is shattered when his young wife Mary suffers a tragic death. Three years later, a mysterious letter arrives from Mary, beckoning him to return to their sanctuary of memories, the dark realm of Silent Hill.\n\nYou must guide James through all-new environments and creepy new areas closed off in the original game. Real-time weather effects, fog, morphing, and shadows set the stage for heart-stopping frights. Be brave as you journey to uncover the truth.\n\nThe Longest Journey (recommended by BoukObelisk)\n\nThe Longest Journey is an amazing graphical adventure, where the player controls the protagonist, April Ryan, on her journey between parallel universes. Embark on an exciting and original journey of discovery, where you will explore, solve puzzles, meet new people, face terrifying monsters, learn, grow, and live the adventure of a lifetime!\n\nWhat Remains of Edith Finch (recommended by Regawdless)\n\nWhat Remains of Edith Finch is a collection of strange tales about a family in Washington state.\n\nAs Edith, you'll explore the colossal Finch house, searching for stories as she explores her family history and tries to figure out why she's the last one in her family left alive. Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.\n\nThe gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.\n\nUltimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.\n\nHomeworld 1 (recommended by BoukObelisk)\n\nDeported to a harsh desert world, exiles have struggled for three thousand years to regain the stars. Now it's up to you to guide them home through a brutal empire bent on annihilation.\n\nHomeworld 1 follows the Kushan exiles of the planet Kharak after their home planet is destroyed by the Taiidan Empire in retaliation for developing hyperspace jump technology. The survivors journey with their spacecraft-constructing mothership to reclaim their ancient homeworld of Hiigara from the Taiidan, encountering a variety of pirates, mercenaries, traders, and rebels along the way.\n\nShadowrun: Dragonfall (recommended by BoukObelisk)\n\nIn 2012, magic returned to our world, awakening powerful creatures of myth and legend. Among them was the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge, who emerged without warning from the mountains of Germany, unleashing fire, death, and untold destruction across the countryside. It took German forces nearly four months to finally shoot her down - and when they did, their victory became known as The Dragonfall.\n\nIt's 42 years later - 2054 - and the world has changed. Unchecked advances in technology have blurred the line between man and machine. Elves and trolls walk among us, ruthless corporations bleed the world dry, and Feuerschwinge's reign of terror is just a distant memory. Germany is splintered - a stable anarchy known as the \"Flux State\" controls the city of Berlin. It's a place where power is ephemeral, almost anything goes, and the right connections can be the difference between success and starvation. For you and your team of battle-scarred shadowrunners, there's no better place to earn a quick payday.\n\nNow, a new threat is rising, one that could mean untold chaos and devastation. One that soon has you and your team caught on the wrong side of a deadly conspiracy. The only clue: whispers of the Dragonfall. Rumors that the Great Dragon Feuerschwinge may still be alive, waiting for the right moment to return…\n\nThe Beginner's Guide (recommended by OniluapL)\n\nThe Beginner's Guide is a narrative video game from Davey Wreden, the creator of The Stanley Parable. It lasts about an hour and a half and has no traditional mechanics, no goals or objectives. Instead, it tells the story of a person struggling to deal with something they do not understand.\n\nHellblade - Senua's Sacrifice (recommended by Fredrik)\n\nSet in the Viking age, a broken Celtic warrior embarks on a haunting vision quest into Viking Hell to fight for the soul of her dead lover.\n\nCreated in collaboration with neuroscientists and people who experience psychosis, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice will pull you deep into Senua's mind.\n\nDanganronpa Series (recommended by MikeNeko)\n\nHope's Peak Academy is home to Japan's best and brightest high school students—the beacons of hope for the future. But that hope suddenly dies when Makoto Naegi and his classmates find themselves imprisoned in the school, cut off from the outside world and subject to the whims of a strange, murderous little bear named Monokuma. He pits the students against each other, promising freedom to anyone who can murder a fellow classmate and get away with it.\n\nIt's up to you to find out who Monokuma really is, and why you've been taken from the world you once knew. But be careful what you wish for—sometimes there's nothing more deadly than the truth...\n\nMikeNeko's advice:\n\nThis is very important, try under no circumstance to find which item to offer to whom until you have completed the game. the spoilers ruin the experience and are in every wiki and faq around even on things as simple as character sheets.\n\nSherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments\n\nWill you follow your moral compass, or will you apply the letter of the law?\n\nThe great freedom of action in Crimes & Punishments allows you to conduct your investigations in the manner you deem appropriate. Use the 14 extraordinary skills of detection for which Sherlock is famous, choose the avenues of enquiry you wish to pursue, interrogate your suspects and, from your deductions, name the guilty parties... you can even determine their fate! The ramifications are far-reaching, and your decisions will exert a real influence through your reputation or the surprising consequences that will arise where you least expect them…\n\nGravity Rush | Gravity Rush 2\n\nI'm going to nominate Gravity Rush 1-2. It is a bit of an odd choice and one that will not immediately feel like the narrative has much of a substance or worth to it. The characters will feel like one note tropes and the actions, consequences etc will often feel insignificant. As you play the game more however you will start to take note of some of the darker tones and themes. How underneath the surface things are much more complicated and in the same way this further develops characters as you begin to realise they are the way they are also due to their circumstances.\n\nThis is a long but fantastic post on reddit that was posted also in the OT a while back. It contains some spoilers.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/gravityrush/comments/7rhp9x/gravity_rush_the_spirit_of_kindness_spoilers/\n\nThe style and presentation of the narrative is also interesting and certainly not the pace for everyone. At its core it is about Kat who discovers her role in the first game. She essentially becomes a super hero, the hero for the city. This comes with the exciting world saving adventures as well as the more mundane, delivering and mingling with the regular folk. It shows Kat not just in action but also in her daily life. Gravity Rush 2 expands on this, she has found her identity and knows herself as the Gravity Queen who loves helping people but she must again find her place and build up the trust of the people in a new city meaning back to mingling and helping people with various tasks, big and small.\n\nIt is important to note that this isn't like a typical power trip where you just go from one fight to another. Kat's growth also comes from playing with others and seeing how they interact. It is as much about her as a super hero as it is about how she fits into the world. For example, in the gravity days comics one of her jobs was to baby sit.\n\nThe game also has one of my favourite endings in recent memory. It wraps up the game very well and leaves you wanting more. I will say that it did take quite a while to get there though and not all of it is great from a narrative perspective.\n\nNier Automata\n\nNieR: Automata tells the story of androids 2B, 9S and A2 and their battle to reclaim the machine-driven dystopia overrun by powerful machines.\n\nHumanity has been driven from the Earth by mechanical beings from another world. In a final effort to take back the planet, the human resistance sends a force of android soldiers to destroy the invaders. Now, a war between machines and androids rages on... A war that could soon unveil a long-forgotten truth of the world.\n\nSagebrush\n\nnewgamewhodis said:\n\nAfter both Outlast II and Farcry 5 failed to explore what makes cults so intoxicating, so easy to feel trapped until the guillotine falls, this little indie walking sim came out of nowhere and smashed it. You'll spend an isolating two hours at Black Sage Ranch, sometime after it was abandoned following a mass suicide. The lo-fi PS1 aesthetics allow for the game to build a creeping sense of dread with very little - the doors and floorboard creak out of turn, or a swarm of buzzards slowly come into focus as you get closer. Sagebrush is absolutely terrifying, but its terror comes from a real place, not the ghouls of Outlast or the magic dust of Farcry. There are a few caveats - namely, the ring leader's voice acting lacks the charisma one might expect for a cult leader, and there are a couple of instances where one's progression could get stuck if they can't find the necessary item. But if you liked the creeping dread of Gone Home, or if you loved binging Wild Wild Country, or if have any interest in cults, I recommend checking it out.\n\nAlice: Madness Returns\n\nnewgamewhodis said:\n\nAlice: Madness Returns didn't get the respect it deserved. While the American McGee's first Alice offered a refreshing visual twist on the Alice in Wonderland mythos, the sequel went above and beyond with its storytelling and visual diversity. In order to service the gameplay, the story is a bit drawn out, but what is there is expertly told - via immaculate cutscenes that look like woodcuts, excellent voice overs, and first-person exploration bits that occasionally serve as interludes between levels. Alice's adventure in Lewis Carroll's books are often interpreted as a way to mask and explore personal trauma, but here, the trauma is both explicit and darker than one could imagine. It's a grim tale, but one that is told beautifully.\n\nNotable releases this month (September 2018)\n\n428: Shibuya Scramble\n\nA kidnapping on the streets of Shibuya brings together a hot-blooded detective, hard-hitting journalist, former gang leader, the head researcher of a big pharma manufacturer and a part-timer stuck in cat costume for a series of events each more unexpected and outrageous than the last.

Hundreds of kingdoms have risen and fallen in these lands, and now it is time for you to make your mark—by building your own kingdom! To do so, you'll need to survive the harsh wilderness and the threat of rival nations… as well as threats within your own court.\n\nPathfinder: Kingmaker is based on Paizo's award-winning Pathfinder Adventure Path of the same name. You certainly don't need to be familiar with the story, but if you are, you will encounter characters you know and love as well as a host of brand-new events, companions, allies, and threats that expand and enhance the original Adventure Path. With help from Paizo and their authors, the story and quests have been expanded by RPG writer Chris Avellone and the Owlcat team, allowing for even more adventure in the already rich narrative of the Stolen Lands.\n\nWhile Pathfinder: Kingmaker is a single-player game, you won't be adventuring alone. \"Kingmaker\" features a diverse cast of companions and NPCs, including iconic characters from the Pathfinder setting itself. You'll need to decide who to trust and who to watch carefully, as each companion has an agenda, alignment, and goals that may differ from yours. Your journey will become their journey, and you'll help shape their lives both in the moment and well into the future.\n\nLife is Strange 2\n\nTwo brothers Sean and Daniel Diaz, 16 and 9, are forced to run away from home after a tragic incident in Seattle. In fear of the police, Sean & Daniel head to Mexico while attempting to conceal a sudden and mysterious supernatural power.\n\nLife on the road is tough and now totally responsible for his much younger brother, Sean begins to realise that his decisions will impact their lives forever…\n\nSeers Isle\n\nSeers Isle is an interactive graphic novel, set in a fantasy version of medieval northern Europe, where your choices impact the fate of a group of characters.\n\nA group of shaman apprentices set foot on the shores of a sacred island to be initiated to magic.\n\nAs they progress through the wilderness, looking for the \"Seers\", their spirit-guides, they realize they're not alone.\n\nWho is this strange horned woman they are seeing in their dreams?\n\nLamplight City\n\nThe Gateway to Vespuccia, the City of Air and Light, Lamplight City - the thriving port city of New Bretagne is a beacon of progress and industrial advancement in the New World. Yet beneath the promises of a shining 19th-century future, the city rests upon foundations of poverty, class struggle, and crime.\n\nFor police detective turned private investigator Miles Fordham, Lamplight City's shadowy corners are just part of the territory.

Uncover the secrets and mysteries of Neuville's Mansion. Test your logic against diverse puzzles, locate and use a variety of items, and don't lose your sense of direction, as navigation itself becomes an obstacle in your path!\n\nkiller7\n\nkiller7 chronicles the connection between two men whose intertwined path develop into a compelling tale of revenge and altering personas, propelling players into the consciousness of one man, Harman Smith and his seven different personalities.\n\nYour goal: stop Heaven Smile, a group responsible for a wave of indiscriminate violence that is plaguing the world. Unique characters, complex story, and dark imagery presented with striking cel-shaded graphics are all the essential ingredients for this classic title.\n\nOmni Link\n\nOmni Link is a visual novel at it's core, but it's unlike other visual novels you've read before. Game-play and dialogue choices mesh together so you can see a real impact to your decisions. A story is not only about reading, it's about experiencing. Get involved with Omni Links characters, and experience their pains and joys as if they are your own. It all comes together in the end for an epic conclusion.\n\nAfter the prologue, the game takes you on a mission for Zaos Corporation. You encounter an alien vessel and connect with an entity known as Ectype D-7, an attractive and powerful being of technology. You quickly learn that there is more to this ship and A.I. than meets the eye. The artificial intelligence is so advanced she is able to absorb energy from other ships and duplicate them. As well as use a mysterious ability called Omni Link.\n\nMatch your abilities against a faceless terror. An enemy called \"The Virus\" awakens near the edge of the galaxy. Suns are disappearing and planets are dying. No one knows exactly what the Virus is or what it wants. Take the Virus on full force, or select an easier difficulty to breeze through the story.\n\nHidden gems\n\nGame of Thrones (2012) (recommended by Artdayne)\n\nIt's a bit difficult to go too in depth without spoiling and also because there are so many layers to the story. The game is a very tightly confined 20-25 hour game that mostly follows the main story. It takes place just before the beginning of the show/books and continues a bit into it. Most of the stuff in the main series takes place off screen though. Lord Varys is voiced by the actor in the show, same for Cersei and Jeor Mormont. The game follows two primary characters, both are the eldest sons of noble families from the Westerlands, which if you're not familiar, Tywin Lannister is the Warden of the Westerlands. One of them is a member of the Night's Watch and has been at the wall for nearly 20 years, and a good portion of your experience playing that character will be at or around the wall. The other character is a red priest who lived in Essos for about 20 years but recently returned to his castle as his father just died and he's there for the funeral and to possibly take over as the Lord of his castle as the rightful heir but there are complications.\n\nIt's an RPG so there are different classes you can play with those two characters, you often have one other person in the party of one of those two main characters at any time and the combat is sort of like KOTOR or Dragon Age Origins. You can queue up attacks, slow down time to issue attacks ahead of time and some attacks synergize to increase damage. There is some choice and consequence where your decisions effect the game and of course new gear upgrades.\n\nLike I said, it's kind of rough technically, really depends on what your tolerance is for that sort of thing, if you don't mind a bit of jank in your games you'll probably love the story.\n\nShadow of Memories\n\nShadow of Memories is a 2001 PS2 game set in multiple eras ranging from 1580 to 2001. After being resurrected by \"Homunculus\", in a purgatory like place after being killed in 2001, you're given the ability to travel through time to find your killer. But what is this mysterious Homunculus's intentions?\n\nThere is no action in this game just using items at the right time ala Monkey island. It's fairly short and has old PS2 jank, but the atmosphere is unique. It has a lingering sense of dread, as you could be killed in a cutscene, or visited by the creepy Homunculus, or scolded by an ugly af townsperson. It has 6 endings with one of them as far as I remember being very satisfying.\n\nThe Norwood Suite (recommended by newgamewhodis)\n\nnewgamewhodis said:\n\nA lovely bit of absurdist theater, inspired by Lynch but with its own sense of jazz and humor that keeps it from feeling like a rip off. Another one of my favorite walking sims, elevated by one of the best soundtracks of last year.\n\nFar from Noise (recommended by newgamewhodis)\n\nnewgamewhodis said:\n\nThis is a calming game, but not in the sense that you'll relax while playing it. It's calming in that, after you've played it, and questioned yourself, you'll come out on the other side of the journey with a more calm and clear-sighted purpose. Or you'll careen off a cliff. It's all up to you.\n\nGhost of a Tale (recommended by newgamewhodis)\n\nnewgamewhodis said:\n\nThis game really surprised me. I was expecting a fun little stealth-lite title with cute mousey boys. What I got was indeed stealth-lite, but it comes with this expansive, lore-rich map that folds in on itself and recalls--wait for it--Dark Souls. Combined with old-school quest design and an incredibly rich and well-written story (seriously, one of year's best so far), Ghost of a Tale is a game world I won't soon forget. It's the best narrative I've played so far in 2018.\n\nRumu (recommended by newgamewhodis)\n\nnewgamewhodis said:\n\nRumu is one of those games I read about and immediately bought. You play as an automated vacuum cleaner in a house where the owners are always just out of sight. It flirts with horror, but ends up telling a much more human tale. The actual story isn't revolutionary, but its framed in a novel way that recontextualizes the house as something systemic, something to be overcome. It didn't make my Year End list last year, but it's a game I haven't forgotten, months after playing it. And the music and visuals are delightful."
