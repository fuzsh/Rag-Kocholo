        "text": "Those two works were followed by Nature morte, and all three were created in collaboration with Jean Jauvin and Laurent Maslé, who often work in contemporary dance. Jean Jauvin seeks to create lighting that comes alive, with an architectural approach to lighting design. Laurent Maslé is known for the organic nature of his sound environments, and is also interested in acoustic ecology.\n\nJulie Andrée T. was invited to the Avignon Festival in 2010 to present Not Waterproof andRouge. She has collaborated with various artists such as Jacob Wren, Martin Bélanger, Xavier LeRoy, Benoît Lachambre and Dominique Porte, and has been a member of the collective performance group Black Market International since 2003. An occasional curator, she has also taught performance art at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston."
