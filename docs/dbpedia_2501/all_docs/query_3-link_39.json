He created various tableaux of these banquets in the style of Dutch still lives from the 17th century, which were generally painted to boast of the plethora of ingredients available in the expanding world. When applied to the present day, where in the West our over-abundance of food has removed any connotations of wealth and luxury, it appears ludicrous and ugly. The wastefulness means it is more likely to be interpreted as a pile of rubbish than a feast."
