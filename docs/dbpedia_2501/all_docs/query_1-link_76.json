        "text": "Zeb Does Obsidian/Black Isle\n\nAlpha Protocol: Team Mina\n\nI’ve been obsessively watching videos about Fallout 76 and that has meant delving down into the world of gaming YouTube and I’m telling you guys, some of these videos are so utterly cringe they cause me physical pain. Is this just what it’s like to consume other people’s video game content??? Is this the way that I make YOU feel?????? If it is then why have you let this farce go on for so long??????????\n\nLest I stare too long into the abyss of YouTube gaming and the self-reflection that arises from it, let’s talk about Alpha Protocol now. I really don’t have a whole lot to say, so we’ll be keeping this post short and sweet. Spoilers follow, and a mention of sexual violence.\n\nThis is really just the story of one extremely boring man surrounded by a glimmering constellation of brilliant, deadly women, huh? The point is probably supposed to be that they can all be romanced, but Obsidian was kind enough to ensure that they are all fully-fledged, capable and interesting characters in their own right, and I more or less stopped paying attention to Mike altogether at some point to lavish my attentions on them.\n\nSpeaking of lavishing attentions, I did think the Mina romance was pretty dang cute, and I think they have a great dynamic together:\n\nMike: Now this is why I love you.\n\nMina: You can send roses to my dead drop in Prague.\n\nMike: Does the pope shit in the woods?\n\nMina: I really hope not.\n\nMike: Sorry, mixed metaphors.\n\nThe only regrettable thing about it was that I never got rid of Mike’s horrible scraggly beard, and I am truly sorry for Mina that she had to experience kissing that.\n\nSteven Heck is 100% serving the absolutely unhinged chaotic energy that I try to channel every time I sit down to write a blog post (only slightly more homicidal) and I have to say the portion of the game featuring him was a true highlight:\n\nHeck: Did you know a soccer ball can decapitate a man at 400 miles per hour?\n\nThe AI in this game is uhhhhhhh something you really must behold for yourself. At one point 5 enemies slowly clambered down a ladder one after another to be karate chopped to death at the bottom.\n\nI accidentally chose SIE as my handler for the final mission and felt really uncomfortable with the scene where she talks to Mike while he’s restrained. She behaves very suggestively and almost kisses him, and the whole time I was thinking how unacceptable people would find a scene like that if their genders were reversed and it was a woman who was tied up and a man making a pass at her while she was restrained. It feels like it falls into that sexual double standard where men are supposed to interpret any sexual interest as a personal victory even if that interest is actually predatory and/or threatening. And you know what I have to say to that?\n\nSo overall…this is a really interesting one. Alpha Protocol‘s strength is certainly the sheer intricacy of the story it tells, and the significant impact that player choices have on outcomes of all kinds. “Moral choices” is a buzzword (buzzphrase?) that gets tossed around in RPGs a lot, and I think this game delivers on that promise in a great way. The plot itself was perfectly enjoyable if not deeply engaging, and a number of the characters shone. As for gameplay, I got really tired of playing through stealth and playing through as a shooter because both systems were so janky and repetitive – in short, combat was something of a repetitive chore. Overall, though, I’d say this game gets a 7/10 shitting popes.\n\nAnd now for Dungeon Siege III! Otherwise known as a game I know literally nothing about! We’ll see if it also takes me several months to complete…\n\nWell, Boys, Here We Are Again With Alpha Protocol\n\nIt speaks volumes about my General Mental State that last night I had a nightmare where I downloaded the original Neverwinter Nights 2 Bishop Romance Mod and it was absolutely despicable and I was like “I fucking hate this but I’m doing it for my BLOG” and I refused to stop playing it. Psychoanalyze THAT, why don’t you?\n\nSo I started playing Mask of the Betrayer and I just really really wasn’t feeling it, so I’m gonna toss it onto the backburner for now. To Be Revisited when I’m back in the mood for D&D! For now, it’s SPY TIME! That actually makes this post sound a lot more fun than it is, because it mostly has to do with me being terrible at video games.\n\nWhat you should know right off the bat is that I’ve more or less entirely forgotten how to play a FPS game. This fact will suffice to explain the majority of what will follow in the rest of this post.\n\nI got things off to a fucking excellent start, and I have some texts that preserve my incompetence in time forever like a dragonfly encased in amber:\n\nDid I manage to finally make him look like a pervert? Well, you can answer that for yourself. It is my utmost pleasure to present to you Michael “Definitely Not a Spy, Just a Normal Man” Thorton:\n\nYes, indeed, I DID play through the entirety of the game so far with him looking like this!\n\nWhat’s excellent is that Thorton is genuinely the dumbest man in the world.\n\nScarlet: [holds up magazine article, next to which is an advertisement of a woman’s legs] Look at this!\n\nMike: Are those your legs?\n\nMike: I’m looking for a man. Not in that way.\n\nMike: *steps into the path of an oncoming train and is immediately reduced to smithereens*\n\nOkay, that last one is just a reflection of me being dumb. Do you see what I’m saying, though? I have a strong suspicion that all of the suave/flirtatious dialogue choices are equally ridiculous, and I would take them at every opportunity were it not for my mortal fear of turning Thorton into an Actual Pervert. I can handle the aesthetic, not the true enactment!\n\nI’m fucking stuck on the Brayko boss fight. And I mean STUCK. The first time I played through I was like “Huh, maybe I shouldn’t have exclusively specced for stealth. Well, shit.” So I tried and I tried and I eventually gave up and quit in a rage, and then I decided that I would start the game over again with a better-built character. It’s honestly the most genious brain thing I’ve ever done because now I’m entirely sick of the game and I still can’t beat Brayko lmao!\n\nRemember when I was playing Baldur’s Gate 2 and couldn’t defeat moon boy dweeb Rasaad’s final boss fight and consequently spiraled down into inane hateful anger and the depths of crushing despair? Yeah, a similar psychological process is happening now. I SWOM TO JOM GUYS, who would have thought that Alpha Protocol was going to be the game to make me have a mental breakdown this playthrough? I was sure it’d be South Park: the Stick of Truth!\n\nEdit 10/30: well, the day after making this post I beat Brayko super easily so I think the solution to any hard boss fight is just to complain about it on the Internet. If you’re looking for actual tactics, though, I can help! I immediately ran to the left alcove to hide and then used my AR to winnow down his health to JUST before the cutscene triggers (when he reaches a certain health the cutscene triggers and the fight changes). Then I used chain shot and headshot him as many times as possible. This got him well below half health. When the other enemies came out I focused on avoiding/killing them until Brayko came downstairs and then I repeated the process: get rid of his shields with the AR and then chain shot. When he went into his stabby cocaine rage I ran and angled the camera so that I could see him, so when he stopped chasing and started cowering I knew right away. That’s when I was able to do the most damage to him besides the initial stage of the fight. This tactic took him down really fast. Good luck!\n\nPlease please PLEASE send me all your game-beatiest vibes! I need all the help I can get!!!!!!\n\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Thick with Child\n\nToday I was in the ABSOLUTE worst mood for absolutely no reason whatsoever; we’re talking actively glaring and stomping around and wanting to wreck shit, and then I decided to read through basically the entire backlog of this blog, and I emerged in a state of pure bliss.\n\nWith that out of the way, it’s time to return to Neverwinter Nights 2. Spoilers follow!\n\nAlthough, to a critical eye, any post on this blog might constitute what the experts call a “fuck up,” I’m sad to say that I REALLY AND TRULY did fuck up by apparently having a massive brain aneurysm and forgetting to talk about all of the end-game stuff with Bishop in the post entirely and completely dedicated to dunking on Bishop and Casavir. My bad!!!!!\n\nSo if you’re not familiar with the plot, Absolute Rat Bastard Bishop betrays your side to the King of Shadows and nopes the fuck out with some real classic lines for the ages:\n\nBishop: Stay on the walls – you might live through this. For what it’s worth, you almost made me stick around, but that’s why I’m going to have to do this […] I was thinking it would be as easy to hate you as I did Duncan but I don’t…at all. But see, that’s the reason it’s going to end like this. I’m not going to be tied to anyone or anything again.\n\nOkay. So. SO. Just to reiterate? “I love you but I refuse to Have Feelings so I have to kill you” is REALLY the justification here. That’s SERIOUSLY what he’s going with.\n\nThere are also some definite undertones of “Fuck you for not choosing me over Casavir” but…..but……it’s not like Casavir fared any better, my dude!!! Rodiewen friendzoned him and made him carry 300 pounds of healing potions into the final battle!!!!!!\n\nJust to confirm this suspicion: I was perusing this guide to figure out which companions will turn on you in this confrontation scene, and the walkthrough describes what happens if you romance Casavir (which I obviously did NOT do because I don’t actually hate myself that much):\n\nBishop: Don’t think I didn’t see you and the paladin here, right before the siege. And to think that before that I was willing to fight for you – I would have died for you.\n\nDeciding to betray your unrequited crush’s side in a war against all-consuming evil and actively plotting for her death is uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh pretty much well-off the “Unable to Handle Rejection” charts. Forget about Neckbeard Anders, this is like genuinely some incel levels of violent, vengeful batshit derangement over not getting fucked.\n\nWOLFCEL\n\nOkay, sorry, can I just remind you: someone looked at this and was like “Hmmmm, let’s keep the jawline, wolf fetish and aggressive sociopathy, add just a little bit more explicit sexuality and drag n’ drop this Whole Situation into the land of the Nords.” I CAN’T FORGET THIS FACT SO YOU HAVE TO SUFFER WITH ME.\n\nIf you can look past the hordes (ok there are two but that’s two too many imo) of dogshit men who are inexplicably obsessed with your player character, the great news is that Neverwinter Nights 2 kind of sucks ass! My chief complaints are as follows: inconceivably bad camera controls, party controls and AI, boring combat and a positive plethora of bugs, glitches and crashes. I don’t usually spend that much time discussing things like this but I think that’s been because I haven’t really encountered a game where these components are as awful as they are in this game. They really, really are.\n\nIf you can look past the shambling technical state of the game, the great news is that NWN 2 has worse pacing than any game I’ve ever played – and may I remind you that I’ve played Dragon Age II??? There is SO much boring, unnecessary shit in the first act especially – like, how many errands do you have to run for the Neverwinter Guard before they let you into the Blacklake District?\n\nIf you can look past the significant parts of the game that are aimless, meandering fetch-questing, the great news is that the game forces you to spend vast quantities of time with a group of characters who seem, by and large, specifically designed to be as annoying and antagonistic as possible.\n\nOne of the things that I usually love about RPG companions is the sense of found family that emerges as the companions gradually bond with each other and overcome their differences. Unfortunately, I can’t think of a single instance of one companion in this game being anything approaching companionable or friendly towards another companion in this game. Everyone hates everyone, and it really, truly grates on the nerves after a while.\n\nTo be entirely fair, however, there were some truly funny moments amongst all the bickering and they are as follows:\n\nKhelgar: Now don’t be bringing my mother into this! You’d best be careful, you simpering little father’s girl, or you’ll learn a thing or two about Ironfist honor and manhood!\n\nQara: Oh, you mean the two smallest things in Faerun? From what I hear, no woman could learn about Ironfist manhood from you, Khelgar.\n\nDeekin: I like gnomes, / So dumb and fat, / Fat and dumb / In burrows like moles / Shoot ’em full of arrows / Put ’em on a stick / That’s why I like gnomes.\n\nGrobnar: My word. Just hearing that gives me the shivers…I say, this is…genius. The tone, the tempo. You can almost feel the angst and pain of the gnomes as they are filled with arrows… and put on sticks. And the theme of the piece… now, that is tragedy, in its deepest, most primal form. And the climax, the uplifting portion, where the affirmation of liking gnomes is confirmed… And then brought full circle with the physical and emotional double meaning of them being in the mind and in the stomach. Amazing. I say, travelling to Neverwinter with you all has really been broadening my horizons — who would have thought I’d get to meet a kobold author and playwright!\n\nCredit where credit is due! The funniest character this game is Neeshka and she is an absolute delight. It also helps that I’m just such a sucker for the “scampy disaster rogue girl” trope.\n\nNeeshka *imitating Elanee*: This water is so unnatural and deep, unlike the swamp of dead people I grew up in!\n\nBishop: How many enemies do you have? There’s almost more than I can count.\n\nNeeshka: There’s a surprise.\n\nBishop: Well then you’ll be paying me another way. My bedroll’s a little cold at night – I’m thinking you can fix that.\n\nNeeshka: I could always set you on fire, Bishop. That’d solve two problems.\n\nI know I already mentioned that one but it deserves to be mentioned again.\n\nTrent Vendal: Look at this. An actual Watchman on patrol.\n\nNeeshka: What? Wh-?\n\nKhelgar Ironfist: He means us, girl.\n\nNeeshka: Oh, Gods, I keep forgetting.\n\nAlso she fucking BREAKS A GEAS because she loves your character so much:\n\nNeeshka: I can’t! I won’t betray the only person who ever showed me kindness!\n\nWE STAN A TIEFLING QUEEN.\n\nWe’re rapidly tumbling downhill into the part of the post where I enter some kind of fugue state and just start to ramble derangedly. So I had to take like 5 screenshots of this absolutely haunting portrait of a man because I kept forgetting about it and screenshotting over them:\n\nIsn’t it something? Now that thousands (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) of people have read this blog I’m gonna set up a Patreon and use the proceeds to commission an oil painter to create a life size replica of this painting. It’s gonna be a giant scandal and it’s gonna be great.\n\nCharlotte: [has Rodiewen start stealing items from a shop in broad daylight, right after the elderly owner was threatened by thugs and forced to witness a bloodbath]\n\nNWN2: Your alignment has shifted one point towards evil.\n\nCharlotte:\n\nMe @ me:\n\nI will not be dissuaded of my conviction that someone at Obsidian was tasked with the job of coming up with the most disgusting way of describing pregnancy possible because at one point Dhaegun describes Rodiewen’s mother as being (brace yourself) “THICK WITH CHILD”. I’m not even one of those people who thinks pregnancy is automatically body horror or whatever, and I HATE IT SO MUCH.\n\nBesides Neeshka, my favorite characters in the game were the adorable little kobald bard-turned-merchant Deekin (from the Neverwinter Nights expansions) and Kiriel the giant spider who, when befriended as opposed to killed, takes up residence in the dungeons of your Keep. ❤ ❤ ❤ I’m actually thinking I might go back and play the NWN expansions just for Deekin!\n\nAt one point Rodiewen is talking to Grobnar about his hopeless pursuit of an elusive mythical being named the Wendersnaven, and she has the option of saying the following:\n\nRodiewen: I want to believe.\n\nSO. As you may be able to tell, this game is a hot mess. But by now you should know that I have a terrible soft spot for the scrappy underdog entries of vastly popular RPG franchises (hello, DA2 and Oblivion). I care for those games infinitely more than I care for this one, but it still kind of charmed me in its own disastrous way. In some ways it feels like a very VERY rough prototype for Dragon Age: Origins, so if you’ve played that game for the millionth time and you’re looking for something to scratch the same itch you might want to check this game out. Just….be prepared. 6.5/10 Wendersnavens. In 3 words: Fuck those dudes.\n\nBut but but! I’m not through with Neverwinter Nights 2 yet; I’m still going to play the expansion Mask of the Betrayer because it’s supposed to be amazing. We’ll see……………………………..\n\nNeverwinter Nights 2: Breaking Dawn\n\nI have two (2) pieces of housekeeping news.\n\n1. It is with the utmost shame and chagrin that I tell you, my beloved reader, that I have failed in my most sacred duty as a blogger: informing you of my 69th blog post. It came and it went and I was derelict, wanton, careless of its passage. All I can offer you now as compensation after the fact is that I couldn’t remember how to spell derelict and almost auto-corrected it to “erectile.” I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me, and if someone hasn’t hired a sniper to take me out and end this debacle before blog post 420 (!!!!!), you know I’ll do better next time.\n\n2. To every person (and there have been a few) who has written me an angry essay about how I’m actually just a huge bitch for not liking the Skyrim Romance Mod:\n\nThe day is coming when I make a post that’s just Emperor Palpatine’s face.\n\nAnyways, let’s talk about Neverwinter Nights 2. I finally fucking finished it, for starters! I unfortunately have a WHOLE POST’S WORTH of nonsense to spew about the disaster of a love triangle that is featured in this game so if you’re, like, actually interested in the plot of the game or some such shit that’ll be the next post. Also, in light of the…enthusiastic responses that I’ve gotten about the Skyrim post, I just want to assure you that the anger that I manufacture here is exaggerated for comedic purposes!!!!! I promise!!!! Let’s get to it!\n\nFor the longest time this was the only thing in my draft for this post:\n\nBecause I innately sensed with every fiber of my being that my poor character (her name is Rodiewen, which is a really really stupid name but I’ve named like 500 characters now and they can’t all be winners) was going to get shoe-horned into the middle of some godforsaken motherfucking love triangle between Casavir The World’s Most Boring Man and Bishop the LITERAL sociopath.\n\nHere’s the thing about love triangles: the only good one is The Age of Innocence by Edith Wharton and the rest of them are garbàge. If you’re going to pull it off the romantic choices should meaningfully represent different ideologies or otherwise reflect on the main character’s overarching internal struggle in some way, but nobody does that!! 99% of the time it’s just like……Oh no, how will Mary Sue choose between Alpha Bad Boy with a Secret Soft Side and White Bread Boy Next Door Who She Treats Like a Pet Dog? With that in mind, let’s talk about Bishop and Casavir lol.\n\nI spent some time Hate-Googling phrases like “Casavir is boring” and “Casavir is the worst companion” just to validate my feelings about him, and here are some of my favorite results from that Googling. First of all, there’s this companion popularity poll in which Casavir is the only companion with ZERO VOTES:\n\nI also found this forum discussion, in which user PrincessPurpleBlob writes the following (terrifyingly astute) description of him: “hi… I’m casavir and I’m obsessed with Old Owl Well. I also hate bishop… oh, did I tell you that I want to protect you?“\n\nHe is without a doubt the most aggressively self-important, pompous and bland character I’ve ever encountered in my life. He’s plain tofu, rice cakes and khaki pants as a human being. He’s Cullen on steroids. He’s also an overbearing gentlesir and a giant hypocrite. He’s CONSTANTLY all like “hurr durr m’lady I must protect you from the bad bad man” like Rodiewen’s not an unstoppable machine of death and also an autonomous grown woman capable of assessing her own risks and making her own choices. The hypocrisy comes in when he tries to act like all the helicopter-paladining about Bishop is just out of moralistic righteousness but it’s obvious that it’s just because he’s 1) into Rodiewen and 2) threatened by Bishop’s interest in her and 3) trying to control who she interacts with because he can’t handle his own personal insecurity.\n\nWhen he’s confessing his love the game gives you the option of saying “Why are you doing this?” and I have never related to a piece of in-game dialogue more in my life.\n\nLike seriously, me @ Casavir every time he opens his stupid goddamned mouth:\n\nThe single interesting thing about this love triangle is that Bishop consistently points out Casavir’s overbearing hypocrisy and challenges him to let Rodiewen speak for herself instead of cutting in and speaking over her. Hmmmmm. HMMMMMM. But! Before you start thinking Bishop’s the better choice, let’s do talk about the original Mr. Savage Wolf himself.\n\nTo be completely fair, he’s 7000% more tolerable than his sexually-assaulting, abusive bastardization in Skyrim Romance, but he’s still an absolute fuck-knuckle. He’s totally one of those social Darwinist edgelord motherfuckers who’s like “Oh I’m not racist, I hate everyone equally >:)” and it blooooooooows.\n\nHe’s also one of those dudes who thinks that being an asshole makes him interesting so he just goes around saying the edgiest things he can possibly think of under the impression that it gives him the semblance of a personality. While Rodiewen and Elanee are discussing tactics together, this is how he offers to help:\n\nBishop: I thought I heard the cries of a damsel in distress. Someone has to take up Shandra’s usual role, it seems.\n\nThis is right after Shandra has died sacrificing herself for the group’s survival, mind you. Am I wrong in sensing that he’s like 0.5 milliseconds away from saying “lol triggered??” at any given point in time?\n\nHowever, the amazing thing about Bishop is every female character’s absolute intolerance for his skeezy bullshit:\n\nBishop: Well then you’ll be paying me another way. My bedroll’s a little cold at night – I’m thinking you can fix that.\n\nNeeshka: I could always set you on fire, Bishop. That’d solve two problems.\n\nBishop: [didn’t screenshot, sorry] The way to resolve your problems is clearly to run away and “go” “camping” with me, a psychopathic bastard man who you’ve known for like three in-game days. This is a normal thing to suggest.\n\nRodiewen: I’d rather stab myself in the throat.\n\nLmao anyways they’re both fucking dead now so that’s the end of that. THAT was a pretty bold move on Obsidian’s part, gotta say!!!!!!!\n\nAccording to TV Tropes, Chris Avellone prefers writing “romances that end poorly” to traditional romances, and I think this whole……situation could definitely be understood from that perspective. It’s also really strongly reminiscent of the Atton/Disciple stuff in KOTOR 2 as well as Annah/Fall-From-Grace in Planescape: Torment: one character is chaotic, cynical and dodgy while the other is excessively lawful, moralistic and contained and while they both like your character there is very little content that could actually be construed as a full-fledged romance beyond their jealous rivalry.\n\nIt’s a much less compartmentalized approach to writing attraction than what you typically see in a BioWare game, for instance. With the exception of Anders, I can’t really think of any BioWare characters who continue to overtly and persistently crush on your character when you have not indicated interest in them too. I think there are pros and cons to both styles: the former feels more organic and realistic, but I like that the latter gives you the choice to opt in or opt out as opposed to forcing you to experience romantic attention when you’re not interested in it.\n\nBecause honestly, this is more or less how it went in this game:\n\nObsidian: Here’s a couple of guys to tell your female player character that she’s beautiful and fight for her love! Compliments and male attention are integral parts of this wish-fulfillment power fantasy we are crafting for you! 🙂\n\nCharlotte:\n\nHey, you know what? The other thing about love triangles is that all the waffling back and forth and hand-wringing could be solved by a good old-fashioned ménage à trois if anyone involved had a since ounce of creativity. ON THAT NOTE, stay tuned for my upcoming Neverwinter Nights 2 fanfiction post!!!!!!!! (I JEST. IN CASE YOU WEREN’T SURE.)\n\nMy final bullet point today is that talking so much about love triangles made me think about Twilight: Breaking Dawn and then that made me think about this again:\n\nIt’s very important.\n\nWell, that’s that. Another day, another cathartic rant about the toxic mores of socialized masculinity as embodied in sundry video game creations.\n\nKOTOR 2: Bao-Dur ASMR and My 7,000 Feelings About Kreia\n\nWelcome to KOTOR II part 2: the part that isn’t exclusively about C*rth and my all-consuming enmity towards him. You know there’s gonna be all kinds of spoilies!!\n\nIf I’m remembering KOTOR correctly there is a fair bit less character interaction in this game than the first game, with fewer conversations and no personal quests. While there are banters upon entering the Ebon Hawk and opportunities to turn your companions into Jedi, these don’t quite make up the difference. There are a few standout moments that I’d still like to address.\n\nExile: Do you understand men?\n\nMira: That’s why I dress like this. When they’re looking down to check you out, you can usually smash them on the base of the skull, or deliver an uppercut that knocks them flat. It’s simple- when you want a man, you jab him with a Bothun stunner, then while he’s screaming in pain you slap some stun cuffs on him. Then starve him for two or three days until he becomes open to suggestion, then double check his bounty and see if he’s worth anything.\n\nI mean, okay, so this bitch Atton is stuck in a prison cell and a lady comes in to rescue him, and his genious brain immediately fires off this absolute horseshit:\n\nAtton: You know women. Dark Jedi are bad enough, but when a woman falls to the Dark Side you better space yourself before they catch you. Uh, no offense or anything.\n\nThen he immediately goes on to describe her as a “half-naked…personal fantasy of mine” and I’m just like…………….you DO realize that she could either save your life or leave you to perish of starvation right now? There’s also the love triangle between him, the Exile and the Disciple. In which he literally STAKES HIS CLAIM to the Exile by saying that he “noticed her first.” You’re not a motherfucking old-timey prospector, Atton!!!!\n\nI just gave him a lot of shit, but you know what? Atton’s pretty dang great. A solid dude, if a bit of a mess, and super funny. The last thing to know about Atton is that he canonically thinks about fucking to keep Kreia out of his head, and that’s incredible.\n\nWe’ll be talking about my favorite companion for a considerable amount of time, but 2nd place definitely goes to Bao-Dur. I love his contemplative, gentle nature and how it belies the massive destruction that he enabled during the Mandalorian Wars. ALSO his voice actor, Roger Guenveur Smith, has the BEST VOICE. Bao-Dur ASMR anyone????\n\n187 people on r/KOTORmemes agree with me!!!!!\n\nOkay, enough fucking around. I’m mainly here to talk about Kreia and how she is, hands down, one of the most complex and fascinating characters I’ve ever encountered in a video game. In my opinion, Kreia, Ravel Puzzlewell and Flemeth make up the triumvirate of incredibly well-written, morally grey older women in RPGS and I am here! for! it! Her nihilistic, cynical outlook serves as a darker counterpoint to Jolee Bindo’s more compassionate, optimistic take on grey morality in the first game.\n\nEverything about her characterization makes her intriguing – her hatred of the Force and her belief that it locks the Jedi and Sith into a never-ending cycle of conflict and that the galaxy would be better off without it; her denunciation of the Jedi Council’s hypocrisy and inefficacy; her manipulation of the game’s entire course of events from the killing of the Triumvirate to the creation of a new order of Jedi.\n\nAlso can we talk about how every word that comes out of her mouth is an amazing quote?\n\nKreia: The true war is waged in the hearts of all living things, against our own natures, light or dark. That is what shapes and binds this galaxy, not these creations of man.\n\nKreia: It is such a quiet thing to fall…but far more terrible is to admit it. Kreia: I would have killed the galaxy to protect you. I would have let the galaxy die. You are more rare than you know; and what you have taught yourself must not be allowed to die. You are not a Jedi. Not truly. And it is for that I love you.\n\nHer devotion to the Exile is one of the most incredible things about her, and while it’s less intellectually demanding I have to say that I also adore her contempt for Atton:\n\nAtton: Explain something to me.\n\nKreia: I do not have the years required — nor the desire to indulge you.\n\nWhile Kreia offers up these incredible meditations on grey morality and the difference between intent and outcome, it’s unfortunate that the rest of the game’s morality system remains relatively black and white. You’re awarded Light Side and Dark Side points in a completely comprehensible fashion and there is no real room for actions that fall outside that dichotomy.\n\nIn addition, I have to admit that the actual planet levels in KOTOR II feel much more aimless and cobbled-together than the planet levels in the the first game. The overall structure seems to be “do random side quests until someone decides to tell you about the Jedi here or provide you transportation” and it doesn’t help that the side quests were not especially exciting or multi-faceted. Overall, though, this is a delight of a game and I’m so glad to have the chance to add Kreia to my list of best-written video game characters. 8/10 Carths-in-bright-red-track-pants.\n\nNext comes Neverwinter Nights 2 featuring the OG Bishop, may God help and preserve us all.\n\nStar Wars Knights of the Republic II: the Sith Lords and the Return of an Ancient Enemy\n\nYou should have noticed by now that every few months I have a miniature identity crisis and cope with that by choosing a new design for this blog. Hope you like the new look, but don’t get too attached to it! It’s time for KOTOR II or, *deep breath* Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords AKA the game with clunkiest title in the world. Spoilers for KOTOR follow!\n\nMy first order of business is to proudly inform you that playing a Star Wars game did NOT cause me to re-watch The Star Wars Holiday Special, for the first time in the history of this blog. This is either massive character growth or a huge disappointment depending on your proclivities. I will still be using Lumpy GIFs on all possible occasions, okay? Okay.\n\nMy second order of business is to demand the following of the universe: why the fuck is Canderous Ordo a returning companion in this game? Like, who at Obsidian looked at Canderous and his endless, monotonous ramblings about blah blah “glory in battle” and decided that we players just hadn’t gotten enough of that yet? The fundamental problem is that the Mandalorians will never not suck balls and bore me to tears and I genuinely feel that Canderous’s personality never extended beyond being Mandalorian.\n\nI’m happier about the other returning characters from KOTOR. HK-47? Still a delight in its contemptuous, bloodthirsty way. Welcome aboard! T3-M4? A little darling, and what would we ever do without it? And you know that that pitiful 20 second cutscene with Hallucination Bastila left me emotionally stunned. I was just that thirsty for more of my No.1 Lesbian Space Goddess, to the extent that I frantically devoured the mere scraps that the game saw fit to toss my way.\n\nKOTOR II: (brief glimpse of Bastila where she remains voiceless and vanishes seconds after attacking the Exile)\n\nCharlotte:\n\nBut we’re tiptoeing around the elephant in the room, aren’t we? Because longtime followers of my quest to gain the title of RPG queen may remember how, during the period of time in which I played Knights of the Old Republic, I had a very normal and appropriate emotional reaction to a certain character. A certain character whose stupid floppy hair is definitely extremely greasy, who does not physically possess the capacity to ever shut the damn fuck up about his tissue paper man ego, who actually fucking threatens to spank the female protagonist like 0.5 seconds before telling her that she reminds him of his dead wife. That’s right. Welcome back to the Carth Hate Zone, babes.\n\nSo Carth Onasty is now a Republic General and can I just say, first of all, that the bright red track pants are wayyyyy more of a self-burn than anything I could hope to accomplish with mere words:\n\nHe’s in this game for like 3 minutes total but every single second of his presence was excruciating suffering for me and he managed to be a sad, pathetic loser within that brief timeframe. You see, KOTOR 2 assumes that female Revan romanced him in the first game, but in my case nothing could be further than the truth. Considering how KOTOR panned out for me, (Bastila+Revan 4eva), present day Carth is creepily pining after a woman who expressed the absolute opposite of romantic interest in him:\n\nCarth: I can’t lose her even if she wants to be lost.\n\nLet me translate the bullshit: “My feelings are more important than her feelings and I’m going to pursue someone who is not interested in being pursued.”\n\nThe woman is battling the true Sith empire beyond the boundaries of the known galaxy, my dude!! I think that’s slightly more important than your dick!!!!!\n\nThen he says THIS:\n\nCarth: You tell her that Carth Onasi is waiting for her.\n\nCool cool cool cool cool cool cool. Just couple of quick thoughts about this: 1) Given Carth and Revan’s turbulent history, that is quite possibly the most threatening fucking sentence I’ve ever heard in my life. 2) To be totally frank, I’d probably vanish from the outer limits of the known universe too if I knew that Carth Onasi was waiting for me to come back. Mystery fucking solved.\n\nIs it normal or advisable to spend this much of my post ranting derangedly about a character who is present for approximately .5% of the game’s duration? No, probably not, but if you’re coming to this blog after three years still looking for “normal” or “advisable” posts then I kind of feel like that’s your own problem. Anyways, I’ve gotten it all out of my system now, and this may very well be the last Carth Hate Zone I ever write, so have a final parting meme:\n\nWell, that took up a totally justified amount of time. I have so much left to say about KOTOR II that I think I’m going to end this one here and make another post instead of totally overwhelming you all at once. Just know that I have approximately 7,000 feelings about Kreia and you’re going to have to listen to all of them.\n\nIcewind Dale II: Introducing a Delicate New Scientific Measure\n\nHere is the energy with which I choose to begin this post:\n\nYou know it’s gonna be a good one.\n\nWhile this was still a draft I had this post saved as “Drow Tim” for several weeks. Obviously it was supposed to say “Drow Time” but after I recognized my typo, I just loved the idea of Drow Tim too much to change it. Like “Oh yeah, so there’s Tim in Accounting, always brings in muffins, great guy- and then there’s Drow Tim, you’ll recognize him right away due to the red eyes and general bloodlust. He works in IT.”\n\nThere’s a cat lady in this game, an old woman named Firtha, and she is one of Ravel Puzzlewell’s other forms:\n\nFirtha: I see…I’ve *seen* a brambled garden, blacker than ink, a crow’s nest of a city that spins atop a great mast of stone, and a glacier of black ice- ice that smells of ashes and smoke. But that’s not the strangest thing…I see these things, but it’s not *me* who’s seeing them, but it’s always through another’s eyes, a woman’s eyes, I see these…these other lives, all a-colored grey and sadness, branching outwards- like some great, black, twisted tree.\n\nWay to make me homesick for a much better game, Icewind Dale II!\n\nMy character for this game is named Ves and the only reason I have any kind of emotional attachment to her is because of the portrait I chose for her, which I really, really love:\n\nThank you, portrait artist Jason Manley!\n\nIt turns out that if you toss a drow my way (from the IWD2 NPC Project) and he just happens to be very sad and very confused about life and very good at brooding, my cartoonishly clownish nature demands that I allow him at least a little bit of room in the corner of my heart devoted to fictional characters. With that in mind, welcome to the *✧Elf Boy Commitment Issue Journey *:･ﾟ✧* part 6. It is literally the wildest portion of the adventure thus far so hold on for the ride.\n\nElf Boy no. 6 is a drow refugee named Rizdaer, and let me walk you through the emotional and spiritual journey I underwent when reading his character description:\n\nOff to a good start, right? Well, it turns out that the dynamic of this particular relationship is actually just FUCKING BONKERS. I mean…….. Riz’s go-to move after knowing Ves for 2 days is to repeatedly attempt to establish an intense dom/sub dynamic with her and then skulk off to sadly brood when she’s like “No thank you sir?” It also helps that he chooses to have these conversations at the absolute worst times:\n\nVes: *escorting sobbing children back to their village after rescuing them from an evil sorceress*\n\nRizdaer: I’m going to start loudly calling you “Mistress” now. Hope that’s okay with you\n\nLook, everybody’s fave meme is back!\n\nThere’s been a 5000% change in the quality of this blog since I realized that I could use memes on it, but I don’t know if it’s for better or for worse.\n\nThe Sadly Attempting BDSM part of the relationship is interspersed with little moments that literally could not be MORE LIKE DRUGS TO ME. Like????? “Oh Ves is keeping watch and decides to tuck the blankets around a curled up elf boy and he smiles in his sleep and snuggles down into them. Have a normal emotional reaction to that, Charlotte, why don’t you?”\n\nSo yes yes it’s all the “learning to love after a past of unimaginable darkness” stuff that warms my stupid, heterosexual heart. But guess what happens after that? Ves and Rizdaer both fucking perish one after the other in the final boss fight. We’re talking unrevivable decimation. Holy fuck, you guys! What kind of D&D Romeo and Juliet shit is that, are you kidding me? Just picture it: hideous monsters everywhere, the roar of battle in your ears, and suddenly your soulmate falls right before your eyes. And then before you know it, unimaginable pain and darkness. BAM. Poetry!!!!!!!!!!! RIP and thus ends the *✧Elf Boy Commitment Issue Journey *:･ﾟ✧* part 6 on the saddest note yet.\n\nI would kill and/or die for Peony, a delightfully bratty gnome wizard companion. Her feats include: challenging Rizdaer to a snowball fight (he goes right for the throat and just shoves snow down her shirt) and happily commenting that the swarms of attacking boars remind her of a zoo because you get to see so many animals up close and personal! Not to mention body positivity talks with with Hildury, another companion who is an orc and insecure about her looks, and the following exchanges:\n\nPeony: I’m sucking on an icicle! See?\n\nVes: Congratulations?\n\nAnd:\n\nVes:I know what you’re talking about.\n\nPeony: No you don’t! [sticks her tongue out at you]\n\nShe’s just such a scampy little brat!\n\nIf one Targos guard greets you by commenting “We could build another palisade out of all the goblin bodies you’ve slain” it’s kind of nice and congratulatory. If 12 of them surround you and chant it one after another it starts to become slightly concerning. Guess which one happens in Icewind Dale II?\n\nThere is no better metaphor for late stage capitalism than the man in Dragon’s Eye who repeatedly charges Ves & Co thousands of coins to travel from location to location as the world actively crumbles around them. Talk about topical, am I right?\n\nRemember when I was playing Baldur’s Gate and decided to pick up a dead body I found in the sewer in case it could be useful for a quest later on? Well, somebody at Black Isle was on the same wavelength as me because if you pick up corpses in the Severed Hand you can later use them to intimidate a monster out of a fight!\n\nNow onto the most important part of this post. A few days ago I entered some kind of dissociative state and this is the result: a comprehensive system designed to measure key Elf Boy characteristics. Elf Boys AND quantitative behavioral measures? What could be better!!!!!!! My main discovery from this project is that Solas is very, very difficult to categorize. Because he sucks.\n\nFigure 1: Dumbass/nerd and Chad/bishie* *Solas physically cannot be categorized as “Bishie” or “Chad.” There needs to be a little box in the corner labeled “Egg.” That’s where he belongs.\n\nFigure 2: Necessity of Therapy and Extent of Commitment/Attachment Issues*\n\n*Solas is easily the worst-adjusted of all the elf boys, but not in an actual “neurodivergent person who could suffer less with therapy” kind of way. There is no therapy in the world that could fix the things that are wrong with him.\n\nFigure 3: Murderousness and Broodiness*\n\n* Zevran, Fenris and Rizdaer are all more stereotypically violent and bloodthirsty than Solas, but are any of them planning on destroying the world?\n\nHaha anyways, I really don’t have a whole lot to say about Icewind Dale II as a game. The combat is slightly less demanding than Icewind Dale but it still requires a great deal of thought, patience and planning. The story and character elements are all slightly bulkier than the first game, but the main thing I enjoyed was the broad variety of environments that this game allows you to explore compared to the first game, which was mostly just underground dungeon after underground dungeon. 7 out of 10 Drow Tims. I had a decent time but I’m happy enough to be moving on.\n\nI realized that I can’t get a copy of Baldur’s Gate Dark Alliance II for a reasonable price and I refuse to pirate it soooooo Star Wars time, kids!\n\nIcewind Dale: Using Memes to Compensate For This Post’s Inadequacy\n\nSince Planescape: Torment reconfigured my entire life I’ve been reading about the Infinity engine games and I found out about a Solaufein companion mod for BG2. What the hell! You’re telling me that for all the time I put up with that stodgy old hypocritical turd Keldorn, Elrys could’ve been chilling with a MORALLY GREY AND CONFLICTED DROW WARRIOR? That while she was half-heartedly romancing Moon Boy dweeb Rasaad she could have been HEALING SOLAUFEIN’S BROKEN HEART, thus beginning the ✧･ﾟ*✧Elf Boy Commitment Issue Journey *:･ﾟ✧* far earlier than expected? GOD I’M SO MAD. Anyways I’m lowkey considering a re-play but for now let’s talk about Icewind Dale.\n\nWhen you try to talk to squirrels in this game you get the same message as you do in Baldur’s Gate: “Squirrel: has nothing to say to you.” That was one of the very first things I pointed out about Baldur’s Gate and, in the spirit of nostalgia, it will also be my first comment here. ❤\n\nI KNOW I probably spend too much time making fun of the sci-fi/fantasy names that writers come up with, but do they truly expect me to take an NPC seriously when his name is Gerth? TRULY? You frankly cannot give a person a name that is one letter away from (and still sounds exactly like) a word that is most commonly associated with the thickness of a penis and expect me to take them seriously.\n\nSo the thing about Icewind Dale is that it’s much, much more of a dungeon crawl than it is a traditional RPG like Baldur’s Gate. The story is pretty much entirely on the rails, and it’s essentially just extended, grueling fetch quest after extended, grueling fetch quest. With that in mind, the chief appeal is the layered and challenging combat. For ME, through? Well, I experienced something of a learning curve when it came to combat in this game.\n\nI was so tired when I was trying to make this that I just typed “Making a meme” into Google and sat staring blankly at the results for a few seconds.\n\nThat’s kind of the cool thing about a game like this, though. I made all of these giant mistakes, but I DID eventually rectify every single one of them and learn how to be a much more strategic player.\n\nOkay, I say that I learned and grew and improved but I did read like half a page of strategy tips for the final battle before realizing that I was reading about some fight in Baldur’s Gate instead of Icewind Dale. IN MY DEFENSE, it was 2AM and I had been up since 7AM having:\n\nA) taken a massive exam that I’d been studying for for weeks\n\nB) Watched Britney Spears’ Crossroads and Twilight Breaking Dawn parts 1 and 2 consecutively because……………….I’m a trash gremlin.\n\nI have to admit that at a certain point I sort-of-kind-of got tired of the grueling combat and just plowed through the remainder of the game on autopilot. Like you can only play so many encounters that look like this and enjoy it:\n\nI was so nonplussed by the game that I ended up putting on TV shows in the background while I bashed my way through dungeons. And THAT is how I ended up sobbing about Queer Eye while clearing out notoriously difficult dungeon Dragon’s Eye, in case you were wondering about how my brand is doing.\n\nI downloaded this NPC mod, which gives you a full party of companions with conversations and banter just like in Baldur’s Gate II. It was so great, everyone! If you ever play Icewind Dale you should totally use it!! I have several specific things to say that are related to it and they are as follows:\n\nAt the very end of Dragon’s Eye my entire party was wiped out by the boss battle except for aloof snobby elf boy Korin, and I like to think that this was the start of his redemption arc. Because how could you not be changed by the horror of seeing an entire dungeon filled with not just the corpses of your enemies but also your friends- having to gather all the belongings that you can carry from their bloody, lifeless bodies and (still mortally wounded yourself) desperately fight your way back to humanity in order to restore them back to life?\n\nReviving the entire party was so expensive that I ended up having to grind by killing and skinning dozens upon dozens of yetis, but the thing was that the party didn’t have enough money for weapons and Korin had to leave a lot of them in Dragon’s Eye, so they all just hand to beat the yetis to death with their fists. Gotta get that bread, am I right?\n\nI Googled “let’s get this bread minions” to find us a good visualization and came up with probably the most cursed Google image results smörgåsbord I’ve ever encountered:\n\nDid you see how I used the proper letters when spelling smörgåsbord? This is what I have learned from living in Norway, I’m so cultured now!\n\nHaving mentioned a “snobby aloof elf boy” you and I both know that Icewind Dale DID feature part 5 of the *✧Elf Boy Commitment Issue Journey *:･ﾟ✧*. It was very much in keeping with the overarching theme of emotionally damaged but secretly vulnerable elf boys who gradually learn that they can express their feelings so I don’t have that much to say except that at one point Korin is talking about how much he used to venerate the goddess of love (whose name I forget and don’t have a screenshot of) and it’s like “oh yeah, ok, he used to be religious” but then WHOAAAAA he’s suddenly talkin about how he had some kind of like mystical mind sex connection with her????? Damn dude ok!!\n\nThe other thing is that you have the option to “laugh tantalizingly” in response to something he says so I spent a really long time thinking about what a tantalizing laugh sounds like and here are my suggestions:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1Rzw-hV7Ng\n\nYou know what I think? Restoring cut content to a video game isn’t always a good thing, because sometimes there’s a TOTALLY legitimate reason that it was cut in the first place. The last main segment of the game takes place in Lower Dorn’s Deep, and Beamdog restored this character called the Voice of Durdel Anatha who’s this haunted spirit in armor that follows you around and literally challenges you to a extremely annoying and tedious fight every time you rest and enter a new area in the Deep.\n\nYou can only get rid of it after completing several objectives withing the Deep, so I basically wanted to die the entire time I was there.\n\nWell, all I can say is that this Black Isle/Obsidian playthrough sure is keeping me on my toes. Our last game featured a lovingly-crafted, intricate narrative worthy of the greatest tomes and virtually no notable combat, and our current game is pretty much the opposite. the story is….uh, functional, to put it kindly, but it is crammed full of challenging, dense, thought-provoking combat. (Squish ’em together and you get the best of both worlds with Baldur’s Gate II.) It’s like a 8 out of 10 objectively as a game, but my enjoyment of it was like a 5 out of 10 tantalizing laughs.\n\nIcewind Dale 2 is up next. I’ve heard mixed things, so…..we shall see. Take care everyone!\n\nPlanescape: Torment: What Can Change the Nature of a Blog?\n\nWe’ve seen our fair share of posts here on Zeb Does BioWare dot com, have we not? Fanfiction and anti-fanfiction? Yes, because I have no shame! Unnecessarily personal ramblings about mental health and trauma? Yes, because the Internet Void is my informal therapist! Wrap-ups, book reviews, Dorian exposés, dozens of good old fashioned stream-of-consciousness-bullet-point-clusterfucks? Of course!!! But I think we’ve reached a first today: I’ve finally played a game so damn good that I’m going to actually TRY to do it justice with a semi-serious post.\n\nSo here we go. Planescape: Torment has challenged my entire notion of what a game can be – the depth of the story it can tell, the thoughtfulness that it can demand from its player, its potential power and intelligence and raw emotion. I can’t totally abandon my bullet point format, but this post will mostly be a collection of moments in the game that fascinated, challenged, delighted or otherwise moved me. All of the featured concept art is by Eric Campanella, and SPOILERS FOLLOW!\n\nLittle Stories\n\nPlanescape: Torment is obsessed with the act of story-telling: the power and vulnerability that comes with sharing oneself with others; a story’s ability to entrap, enlighten, despair, enchant. The Nameless One is assailed by stories and story fragments throughout his quest. There is an entire gallery full of stories told through art, a dungeon of imprisoned skulls that clamor for acknowledgment or share their tales recalcitrantly. The Sensates possess a store of sensory stones that immerse their user in a fragment of memory, an intense snippet of a long-forgotten person’s existence, and Yves the Tale-Chaser at the Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts embodies our yearning to share stories and the allure that they contain. Here are some of my favorites:\n\nThere is a woman named Ingress frantically running through the streets of the Hive. When The Nameless One approaches her, he learns that she accidentally stepped through a portal as a child thirty years ago. Since then she has been trying to find her way home, but has developed a crippling fear of any kind of doorway because she is afraid they will take her to another plane:\n\n“There’s Worlds, there’s…Her eyes gleam madly. “…planes that be sinking sands, fields thirsty nettles be, sightless worlds where y’limbs are given life and hate, cities of dust whose people are dust and whisper ash, the house without doors, the Twilit Lands, the singing winds, the singing winds…” She starts to sob quietly, but she seems all out of years. “And shadows…the terrible shadows there be.”\n\nThe Nameless One finds a plane-traveler to take her home at long last.\n\nThe Nameless One develops an ability to speak to corpses, a skill called Stories-Bones-Tell. He speaks with a zombie worker in the Mortuary who was a scholar and bodyguard for a young woman in a land far away. He became trapped in Sigil while searching for her, and died soon afterwards. Separated from the land he loved and having failed in his duty, now entrapped in never-ending service to the Dustmen, this nameless zombie recites poetry for The Nameless One:\n\n“It is difficult to meet as it is difficult to part.\n\nThe north wind has weakened; hundreds of flowers fade away.\n\nWhen the Spring worms die, the silk shall never come again.\n\nWhen the candle wax becomes ash, tears shall stop.”\n\nHe smiles at you politely.\n\nIn the Dead Nations, TNO encounters a forlorn female zombie.\n\nThis rotting female corpse is shaking her head and moaning sadly. As you approach, however, she turns and holds her hands out to you, as if asking for aid.\n\nIt turns out that she cannot remember her name, and longs for one desperately.\n\nShe stands quietly for a time, staring at the floor. Suddenly, she raises her head. “Yooouuu….naaaaame? Naaammmme mmmeee?”\n\nYou think of a name but before you can speak it the zombie hushes you, drawing close and cupping a hand over her ear. You whisper the name to her…the corpse nods, then smiles. “Yeeessss….thhhhaaaank yooouuuu.”\n\nThere is a bureaucrat stuffed away in a little office, resigned to the thankless task of fighting the infestation of cranium rats in Sigil. When The Nameless One asks him about how he came into his position, the bureaucrat is so delighted to share the story and talks for so long that the party gets a free rest out of the conversation.\n\nIn Ragpicker’s Square, TNO encounters a man named Nodd who struggles to express himself properly. The tale he tells is as follows:\n\n“So Nodd’s parents takes him aways, they does, puts him in a dark place, a Winged Tower, where they pokes needles an’ hooks in Nodd’s head…voices stop, aye, they do, but Nodd can’t think right, can’t talk right. Nodd escapes the place, he does, wakes up in th’ Hive, aye.”\n\nAll Nodd can remember of his life before is his beloved sister, Amarysse. He begs The Nameless One to find her. Amarysse has been working as a prostitute and is overjoyed to hear that her brother is alive. She gives TNO all the coin that she can spare and promises to visit Nodd as soon as she can; Nodd is inexpressibly happy when he hears this.\n\nThere is a lonely girl named Karina at the indoor marketplace. She is delighted to have someone to talk to, and babbles to The Nameless One. When he comments on this, she gets self-conscious.\n\nShe shuffles her feet and looks embarrassed. “I, uh…Well…I’ve been told that I probably talk a bit too much and, well…people tend to avoid me…and I don’t really have any friends or male friends courting me….sometimes I get lonely…” Her voice gets lower and lower until she is finally silent. She stares at the ground at her feet.\n\nThe Nameless One encourages her.\n\n“I don’t think you’re a bad person, Karina. I happen to like you.”\n\nHe encourages a kind young guard to approach her and talk to her; the guard returns looking dazed and blissfully happy.\n\nThere is a man in the Smoldering Corpse Bar named O.\n\n“I am O.” For some reason, when he speaks his name, it sounds like he’s speaking much more than a single letter- as if the speaking of his name contained untold possibilities and nuances. No human tongue could ever create such a sound.\n\n“What are you?”\n\n“It is my name. It is the name of a portion of eternity. I am a letter in the divine alphabet. Understanding me leads to understanding existence. I am writ in the true names of half of everything. My being encompasses truth. I am mathematic, organic, metaphysic.”\n\nThis isn’t quite the right place for this, but I don’t have a better one. In much the same way that I find myself accidentally choosing romantic dialogue in approximately half of the RPGs I play, I unintentionally manouvered The Nameless One into a rather steamy scene with Annah. The scene took an indescribably hilarious turn:\n\nAnna: I want tae bite yeh, soft-like around the neck…[ She teases the side of your neck with her teeth, never breaking skin, and with every whisper, you can feel her breath along your ear. Her hand slides up around the back of your neck and tightens, and you can feel her nails digging into your skin.] I want tae drag me nails along the back of yer neck, and force yeh to kiss me.\n\nMorte: I’d just like to interject here and point out that I’m not going to say anything to spoil the mood, chief. I’ll just float here and watch. Don’t mind me, just sitting here, floating and watching, that’s me.\n\nFinally, there is an old woman who seems to have had enough of adventurers bothering her.\n\nOld Woman: [thrusts out her pelvis and mimics the Nameless One’s heroic stance] Greetin’s, I have some questions… Can ye tell me about this place? Who’s the Lady o’ Pain? I’m lookin’ fer the magic Girdle of Swank Iron, have ye seen it? Do ye know where a portal ta the 2,817th Plane o’ the Abyss might be? Do ye know where the Holy Flamin’ Frost-Brand Gronk-Slayin’ Vorpal Hammer o’ Woundin’ an’ Returnin’ an’ Shootin’-Lightnin’-Out-Yer-Bum is? …Dung, all o’ it! Only gets ye in the dead-book! I ought ta kick ye in the shins fer even pesterin’ a poor ol’ woman about it all! Now go away and leaves me in peace!\n\nHorrors of the Planes\n\nPlanescape: Torment manages to be viscerally horrifying in places, in a way that is hard to imagine given that it is a pixel-y isometric game. These horrors show The Nameless One’s world for the bleak, chaotic place that it is, but the most disturbing of all are the glimpses of what The Nameless One himself is capable of.\n\nThere is a man named Marrow Friend in Ragpicker’s Square, a Collector of dead bodies who cannibalizes them before giving them over to the Dustmen:\n\nHis fingers scrabble spider-like on your arm, as if looking for a piece to tear off. He licks his split lips again, and you watch yellowish drool drip from them. With a raspy moan, his fingers suddenly dig into the skin on your arm and pull off a bit. You watch, and feel your stomach churn as he takes the bit of flesh and shoves it into his mouth. He chews it slowly, then swallows. “Yoooo ded?”\n\nMarrow Friend holds a finger bone with a ring on it, and The Nameless One resorts to extreme measures to access the ring when it refuses to budge from the finger:\n\nYou place the ring finger of your left hand into your mouth, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and bite down as hard as you can. There is a sickening *crunch* and you are overcome with the taste and smell of blood. You spit the bloody finger out and place the rotted, ring-laden finger bone against the gushing stump.\n\nAt another point in time he removes some of his intestines so that he can get a ring that a previous incarnation hid there.\n\nComing back to stories again, the Nameless One and his party exchange tales with Yves the Tale-Chaser. My favorite is Morte’s:\n\n“An elderly man was sitting alone on a dark path, right? He wasn’t certain of which direction to go, and he’d forgotten both where he was traveling to and who he was. He’d sat down for a moment to rest his weary legs, and suddenly looked up to see an elderly woman before him. She grinned toothlessly and with a cackle, spoke: ‘Now your *third* wish. What will it be?'”\n\n“‘Third wish?’ The man was baffled. ‘How can it be a third wish if I haven’t had a first and second wish?'”\n\n“‘You’ve had two wishes already,’ the hag said, ‘but your second wish was for me to return everything to the way it was before you had made your first wish. That’s why you remember nothing; because everything is the way it was before you made any wishes.’ She cackled at the poor berk. ‘So it is that you have one wish left.'”\n\n“‘All right,’ said the man, “I don’t believe this, but there’s no harm in wishing. I wish to know who I am.'”\n\n“‘Funny,’ said the old woman as she granted his wish and disappeared forever. ‘That was your first wish.'”\n\nThese words are later echoed in a memory fragment The Nameless One unlocks at the art gallery, and ultimately it is revealed that this story tells of The Nameless One and Ravel Puzzlewell.\n\nThe Nameless One’s quest is in many ways about tracing the damage that previous incarnations enacted in their quests for answers and release. The Practical Incarnation seems to have seen people as mere tools to be used, abused and discarded in accomplishing his goals, and several of The Nameless One’s party members have been shaped by his ruthlessness. The Practical Incarnation took Ignus on as an apprentice when he was a child, but when Ignus did exactly what he was told to do The Practical Incarnation burned him repeatedly, instilling in him a destructive relationship with fire and a hateful subservience to The Practical Incarnation. TPI is the one who “saved” Dak’kon, lying to him about the Circle of Zerthimon and ensaring him in unending slavery by taking advantage of his githzeri nature. He also took Morte from the Pillar of Skulls and beat him when he refused to help TPI, and much of Morte’s evasiveness can be traced back to his fear and distrust of The Nameless One because of The Practical Incarnation.\n\nThere is also the matter of Deionarra, a woman who was obsessively devoted to The Practical Incarnation despite his contempt for her and constant manipulation and exploitation. In one sensory stone, The Nameless One is forced to watch in agony as The Practical Incarnation’s seduces Deionarra, feeding her lies with psychopathic deliberation in order to kill her and use her as a spy in the Fortress of Regrets. When The Nameless One confronts The Practical Incarnation about his treatment of her, he says the following:\n\nTPI: Women have always walked our path with us – whether Deionarra or Ravel or any other woman, and they have suffered, and it has always been their CHOICE.\n\nChanging Natures\n\nAgain and again, Planescape Torment asks one question: what can change the nature of a man? At the heart of this question are many puzzles: why is The Nameless One so different in various reincarnations – is it random, or built off of fragments of past experiences? Is his redemption possible, or is he damned no matter what he does? Are his good deeds truly good deeds, or are they still corrupt because his motive in accomplishing them is selfish? How does the prospect of eternal life alter the way that a person sees themselves as part of the world? What does it even mean to become a “good” person? How do we bear the legacy of past wrongs we have committed?\n\nAt the very end of the game, The Nameless One finally seems to have developed an answer to the main question:\n\n“If there is anything I have learned in my travels across the Planes, it is that many things may change the nature of a man. Whether regret, or love, or revenge or fear – whatever you believe can change the nature of a man, can. I’ve seen belief move cities, make men stave off death, and turn an evil hag’s heart half-circle. This entire Fortress has been constructed from belief. Belief damned a woman, whose heart clung to the hope that another loved her when he did not. Once, it made a man seek immortality and achieve it. And it has made a posturing spirit think it is something more than a part of me.”\n\nBelief in redemption and compassion are what separate The Nameless One from the Practical Incarnation, the one who wrote the following:\n\n“What little life there is in the world is draining out this hole in my body. The world can burn, the planes can burn, just give me life! I will destroy this life so badly, break it, smash it, and stain it in blood and feces, so you cannot live it either. Let all creation burn for I cannot die!”\n\nCompare this to The Nameless One’s decision to sacrifice himself, dying to an eternity of suffering in the Blood Wars, because he knows that his continued life comes at the expense of the innocent people who die in his place.\n\nThis same belief in redemption and compassion even changes the nature of the Paranoid Incarnation – when he is finally met with understanding and empathy, he knows a peace that he never has before:\n\nHe looks frightened. “I…” To your surprise, he reverts to normal speech…and all the inflections to his voice are gone. It is calm, level, and much like your own. “I…no longer wish to live like this.”\n\n“You have suffered much. You were born into a world where nothing made sense, where strangers claimed they know you, they blamed you for things you knew nothing of, and they tried to hurt you.”\n\nFinally, The First Incarnation’s belief in his own irredeemability and guilt created the reality where his crime was unforgivable, his punishment eternal. A great explanation I found here:\n\nRemember in the Planes belief itself forms reality. In actuality, reality didn’t care about the crime any more than it cares about anything else, the First Incarnation did. His guilt was so extreme over his crime that he believed his crime was unforgivable strongly enough that reality itself changed to accommodate that and thus stated that it was unforgivable. The opposite is also true, if at any point the First Incarnation or any of his future incarnations believed strongly enough that that the crime wasn’t so bad or that he had paid enough penance, then he wouldn’t have gone to hell at the end of the game. In other words, the Nameless One’s hell is entirely self inflicted.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI don’t think there is such a thing as a perfect game, and to be perfectly fair I will mention some of the problems I found with Planescape: Torment.\n\nThere was a sudden jarring change in gameplay in the last third or so of the game: what had previously been mostly conversation, puzzles and thoughtful interactions suddenly became much more combat focused once The Nameless One traveled to the other planes, and in a game without especially enjoyable combat this was kind of a drag.\n\nI’d also mention that as much as I enjoyed Annah and Fall-From-Grace as individual characters, there’s this totally tired Betty and Veronica dynamic between them, and all of their interactions involve suspicion or jealousy of some kind, usually over The Nameless One. I also got very tired of all of Morte’s lascivious little jokes about female characters and their appearances. One of the prostitutes at the Brothel for Slaking Intellectual Lusts has HAD HER TONGUE CUT OUT and Morte’s response to this is essentially “Uhuhuh a woman who is hot and can’t speak? Daddy likey!!!111”\n\nThere we go. Now this feels like a classic Charlotte post.\n\nBut these are exceptions to the general rule that I fucking loved this game so much. It has worked its way into my mind and my heart and I’ll be thinking about it for a long, long time to come. 10/10 stars. We’ve started the Black Isle/Obsidian playthrough on quite a high, and I can’t wait to see where we’ll go from here."
