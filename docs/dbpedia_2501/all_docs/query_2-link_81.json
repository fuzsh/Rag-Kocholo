        "text": "Ringing true to his cubist artwork, Pablo Picasso Nature Morte (Still Life), 1960, is a stunning display of an avant-garde twist on still-life composition. It consists of bold colors and textured surfaces that make this etching & aquatint truly unique. Bold, bright colors coupled with a balanced composition allows for Picasso to create a seemingly cubist piece with very organic undertones. Its curved lines accent the sharp angles that make up the background and foreground, adding to the idea that the still-life medium can indeed still appear to be alive. Its shiny, matte color and crackled detail extend beyond the surface of the work, allowing for an affect caused by the paint to echo cubist characteristics so unique to Picasso’s hand. Seven plates had been used in the production of the Nature Morte (Still Life), 1960 artwork, allowing each of its 11 colors to reverberate throughout the entirety of the impression.\n\nCreated in 1960, this color aquatint artwork on Arches paper is hand signed by Pablo Picasso (Malaga, 1881 – Mougins, 1973) in pencil in the lower right margin. Numbered from the edition of 300 in pencil in the lower left margin; printed and published by Atelier Commelynck, Paris.\n\nCatalogue Raisonné & COA:\n\nPablo Picasso Still Life (Nature Morte) 1960, is fully documented and referenced in the below catalogue raisonnés and texts (copies will be enclosed as added documentation with the invoices that will accompany the final sale of the work).\n\n1.
