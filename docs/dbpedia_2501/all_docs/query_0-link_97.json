Play the award-winning classic, now enhanced for iOS!\n\nReviewers say:\n\n\"Planescape: Torment is a wonderful game, and its Enhanced Edition is a splendid, unobtrusive, beautifying update.\"\n\n-Geek & Sundry\n\n\"Planescape: Torment still stands tall as a landmark masterpiece that can continue to age gracefully, now on your phone or tablet\"\n\n-Touch Arcade\n\n\"Planescape: Torment is a timeless classic, the Enhanced Edition just makes it better\"\n\n-Bleeding Cool\n\nUncover secrets of past lives in this story-rich, tactical roleplaying game set in Sigil, a dark fantasy city at the heart of the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse. Explore the planes, survive combat alongside a party of bizarre companions, and solve puzzles unlike any ever seen in the genre.\n\nThe original Planescape: Torment was released in 1999 to widespread critical acclaim. It won RPG of the Year from multiple outlets for its unconventional story, characters, and amazing soundtrack. Since then, millions of Planescape: Torment fans have enjoyed exploring the strange and dangerous city of Sigil and surrounding planes.\n\nDiscover an incredibly rich story and a unique setting unlike anything else in fantasy. Defeat strange and alien creatures, engage in rich dialogue, and explore the dark and dangerous Planescape setting in this 50+ hour RPG classic.\n\nThis is Planescape: Torment like youâve never seen before.\n\nStory:\n\n\"What can change the nature of a man?\"\n\nYou are The Nameless One, a hulking figure covered in scars and tattoos collected over the course of countless livesânone of which you can remember, but are now coming back to haunt you. You are prodded awake by Morte, a floating skull and keeper of secrets, to embark on an adventure taking the Nameless One from the dirty streets of Sigil into the mysterious Outer Planes and even into the depths of Hell itself.\n\nIn your search for answers, you'll find companions matching the bizarre nature of the planes: a chaste succubus who can kill with a kiss, a confused crossbow-wielding cube, a suit of armor animated by a spirit demanding JUSTICE, and more. With these companions and others at The Nameless Oneâs side, you will explore worlds in search of answers, all to discover that some destinies cannot be escaped and some memories cost more than an immortal should be willing to pay.\n\nBeamdogâs Enhanced Edition titles are designed for 7 inch and larger tablets.

The Nameless One can change his class, alignment, and even gain new abilities based on your choices.\n\n-Remastered Music: The full Planescape: Torment soundtrack has been remastered in-game to add more depth to Sigil and the multiverse.\n\n-New Tablet Interface, Same Planescape Feel: Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition has been designed with tablets in mind. Open and close side menus with a touch, select dialog options with handy conversation buttons, and make tactical decisions with a brand-new action indicator.\n\n-A Planescape For Today: Modern features such as tab highlighting, area zooming, combat log, quickloot, and more!\n\n-Play It Your Way: Enable Enhanced Edition features as you desire or turn them off to experience Planescape: Torment in its original glory.\n\n- Planescape: Torment: Enhanced Edition is available in English, French, Polish, German, and Korean.
