        "text": "This is a sub-page of Planescape: Torment.\n\nDialogue\n\nMorte's Intro Dialogue\n\nThe introduction dialogue from Morte in-game is much smaller than the actual dialogue in the files. The unused text shows that the player would be able to deviate from the main “what the hell is going on?” dialogue tree, such as asking Morte who he is and just plain ignoring Morte and walking around the room.\n\nMorte has a few comments about Dhaal's book in the script files, but they are never played when you approach Dhaal.\n\nTemporary Dead Dabus Dialogue\n\nThe dead Dabus has nothing else to say to you. Try again when Steve puts the final dialogue in.\n\nJust a temporary message for when you tried to continue to talk to the dead Dabus.\n\nEvil Githyanki\n\nI'm a Githyanki con artist who's trying to lead the player into a trap. Player: Well, I'll be sure to stay awy(sic) from you, then. Farewell.\n\nTemporary text for an unused Githyanki that was supposed to lead the player into a trap can be found.\n\nLying Salesman\n\nI'm a bitch, I'm a liar, I'm a thief, I'm your mother, I'm an oozing sore that cannot be ignored... no, wait, that's Meredith Brooks. What I am is a salesman who lies and through my lies you can find the truth. Maybe. Player: I'll be interested to see if the designer can pull that off. Should be fun!\n\nTemporary dialogue for an unused merchant that would have a lying gimmick. It seems the player would have to see through his lies.\n\nLower Ward Characters\n\nFiller dialogue exists for all of the faceless NPCs in the Lower Wards. It's likely these were used before real dialogue for the generic Lower Ward characters was written.\n\nTemporary Buried Village text\n\nTemporary text for the Buried Village villagers can be found in the dialogue files. Like the Lower Ward temporary text, it was used until the real dialogue was written.\n\nCurst Anarchist text\n\nTemporary text for the anarchists in Curst's warehouse can be found in the dialogue files.\n\nTemporary Zombie Text\n\nI am one of the \"rotting herd\" of zombies that fill the catacombs. I shamble to and from work, just like Chris Avellone. Blah, blah. Blah?\n\nTemporary text for the catacomb zombies.\n\nRobtest\n\nA diagloue file named “ROBTEST” that is a dialogue tree that shows the stats for the Silver-Headed Hammer, a Lockpick, the Battle Axe and Embalming Fluid.\n\nJarckel the Three-Faced\n\nI'm Jarckel the three-faced. The theory is that you'll get three of me and have puzzles based on the drinks you give me. Maybe I'll give you something cool for it.\n\nA temporary dialogue file for a character named “Jarckel the Three-Faced” can be found. It seems he would be a gimmick character based on drinking with him.\n\nTemporary Trash Warrens Guard\n\nWe're's the brothers who stand guard overs the gates inta th' Trash Warrens and the Buried Village below. Ye either have to trick us or fight us inta lettin' you by.\n\nTemporary text for Trash Warrens guards can be found. Apparently, at one time, the player would talk to two guards instead of a single collector when you first reached the Trash Warrens.\n\nTemporary Sigil NPC dialogue\n\nI'm a possible haunt that flits around Sigil and some of the other areas. I don't know whether I'll actually be implemented or not.\n\nTemporary dialogue for a random Sigil NPC.\n\nTemporary Fane Dialogue\n\nI'm Fane, the leader of the Starved Dogs Barking Clan in the tenement of thugs. I'm a MEAN person. MEAN! MEAN!\n\nTemporary text for the leader of the Starved Dogs.\n\nCranium Rat template\n\nIt's possible that the cranium rats in the game may actually be able to speak with the character. If so, this template is here for it.\n\nThis is a template that would've been filled in if Cranium Rats were able to speak to the player. They don't, so this is unused.\n\nTemporary Clerk's Ward Drunk\n\nI'm a drunk rake that likes to wander around the Clerk's Ward and pick fights. If I see you, you're bound to be a target, so watch yourself.\n\nTemporary for a drunk that would attack the player in the Upper Ward can be found in the dialogue files. No easy to aggro drunks exist in the Clerk's Ward in the final version.\n\nTemporary Clerk's Ward Thief\n\nI'm a fat, puffing pickpocket from the upper class ward. Chances are, you will have already encountered others of my ilk in the lower class ward.\n\nThis is the only remnant of a thief-like generic NPC in the Clerk's Ward.\n\nTemporary Evil Book text\n\nI am an evil book of spells you can carry around in your inventory.\n\nTemporary description for an evil book. It could possibly be temporary text for the Grimoire of Pestilential Thought, which is a book that contains spells, but will give them to you after you do certain evil tasks for it, such as selling one of your companions into slavery.\n\nTemporary Dustman chanter text\n\n\"I am one of the mourners that chant outside the Dustman kiosk in AR0200 (Hive B). We 'mourn the living' and the player can ask us to mourn for those who have lost loved ones.\"\n\nThis temporary text is used in two files “DMOURN3” and “DMOURN4”. It seems that all of the Dustman mourners outside the obelisk that's just past the Mortuary would've had their own unique dialogue at one time. In the final, they all use the same text.\n\nCurst Prisoners\n\nThere are many unused dialogue files for prisoners that would've inhabited the Curst prison. There doesn't seem to be any good reason why it was cut, as it makes the prison a lot more interesting.\n\nIngress' Teeth\n\nThere's a big chunk of text showing what happens if you use the Ingress' Teeth on Morte. You can either let the teeth jump into Morte's mouth on his own or force them into his mouth. Either way, what happens is that the teeth tear off his old teeth and jump into the crevices in his mouth, which causes Morte to howl with pain. After a while, the teeth settle in, but Morte is still pissed about what the teeth did."
