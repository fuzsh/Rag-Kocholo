        "text": "Actually the shadows are the souls of those who died in TNO's place. Every time TNO \"dies\" and resurrects, another soul has to die in his place to keep the balance. I think Ravel is the one who explains this aspect of the curse. It's also the reason why you can only die a limited number of times (six with a full party) in the Fortress of Regrets: you resurrect once for each party member you have with you, and the last one you die \"for good\".\n\nOh and I'm sure the full glory bit is canonically TTO. I was wrong, it was Chris Avellone who posted this originally. Here's the whole bit.\n\nYeah I remember this too I think the one fans most had trouble with was Fhjull. Everyone was crying and raving about how inconsequential he is to the plot - never mind that there are hints that he and TNO have crossed paths in the past, that both himself and Trias are involved in something to do with TNO, and that he really, really would like to do horrible to TNO and would happily do them if it weren't for Trias's geas forcing him to be helpful.\n\nAgreed. Paranoid is Chaotic Neutral taken to its furthest extreme - he has far, far too weak a grasp on reality to be considered truly Evil and none of his horrible actions are as a means to an end (like Practical) or because he likes being evil; he just truly believes everyone is out to get him and that he's acting out of self-defense.\n\nKeep in mind that a lot of the information you hear about Ravel in Sigil is completely twisted and deformed, or just plain wrong. Not surprising when you consider that she was banished by the Lady of Pain (and history is written by the victors - especially when they're a very tall, unreal woman with knives all around her face who can kill you just by looking at you funny). I think this is one of the best aspects of the game: you think Ravel will be evil because that's how the people in Sigil describe her and you're used to everyone being omniscient in RPGs and no one giving you false information. Then you meet her and talk to her and you realise everyone in Sigil was wrong about her (remember her real reason for trying to open portals in Sigil? not to let other gods in, but to free the Lady of Pain from her Cage).\n\nThis also works on the three incarnations to an extent: if Paranoid is Chaotic Neutral (see above) and Practical is Neutral Evil then you get the 3 alignments. It's another example of everything following the Rule of Three in Planescape (the game does this really nicely with its themes). But I always thought, even before reading Avellone's explanation, that the 3 shards were Trias, Fhjull and Ravel. Ravel is actually the most difficult to fit in, until you meet her and talk to her - then it becomes very apparent that most of the stories about her are wrong and she's not evil, even though she's a Grey Hag. None of her actions which are ascribed (by the people in Sigil) as being evil turn out to be quite what they think they are, including the reason for her riddle in the first place and her reason for opening the Cage.\n\nBut yeah, even with all this there's still some ambiguity and room for alternative explanations. That's the beauty of it"
