This test blends five different worlds: a video documentation of a sculpture, a virtual surrealist world, a graphical user interface and worlds that explore transitional states between these realities. My goal is to create physical access points to my virtual environments in order to explore our relationship with technology that allows bridges between worlds. In nature morte, I am working with immobile subjects in somewhat static environments. Dynamism is created through the constant renewal of our point of view in these worlds. sound by idmx and baron lanteigne\n\nThis is the first iteration of nature morte.
