        "meta_description": "Title: Nature Morte No.1\nYear: 2022\nSize: 80 X 60\nTechnique: Oil on Canvas \n\nStill lifes are works for me in which I can take a breath. While I put a lot of thought and time into creating still life pieces I see them more as a way to focus on the beauty of everyday items. There is no longer the pressure of capturing the essence of one person or the layers that go along with that. A still life to me is more of a simple yet refreshing view of life. A still life (also known by its French title, nature morte) painting is a piece that features an arrangement of inanimate objects as its subject. Usually, these items are set on a table and often include organic objects like fruit and flowers and household items like glassware and textiles. The magic of still life paintings is  that they can show us a new way of looking  at the ordinary objects around us. Once  they are placed into a specific arrangement  and then captured in paint they seem to be  imbued with a life beyond the ordinary.  \nI often use still life as a more direct link to  art history and the artists and time periods I  admire. I will often take bits and pieces  from still lifes that were created by different artists  and put them together to create a new and  interesting composition. I often look to artists from the Dutch Golden Age who are  renowned for their still life interpretations  and amazing flower arrangements. I also enjoy looking at the French impressionists and post-impressionists who have  their own more modern views on  representing these objects. Modern in the sense of selected objects being represented coming from the late 19th century. Modern can also be used to describe the way in which those artists stylistically paint, with loose vivid strokes of paint. They aimed to create the overall impression of an object while the Dutch from the 17th century captured it realistically and in clarity. By contrasting these two methods of still life painting I can have a more rounded view of techniques of representation.\nIn my painting “Nature Morte no.1” I took  inspiration from a French work for the  bottom of the composition and combined  it with the bouquet inspired by a Dutch  work from the 17th century. I then painted  the composition in my own style and vision  for the whole piece to come together and  remain unified. I sought to capture the  beauty of the flowers which are traditionally beautiful along with the harder  bumpy spewing melon which is beautiful in  its own way. These objects I feel actually  compliment one another quite beautifully  and gives a contrast for both textures and  colours.",
