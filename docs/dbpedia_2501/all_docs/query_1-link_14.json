( why would Lawfull evil demons be happy to see him.. hmm?, they are notoriously happy for a chance to kill chaos, this was also mentioned often)\n\n- Nameless ones animation model is pretty stoic overally, but the only time you see him smile, is when he readies to go and fight in blood war during ending( possibly for all eternity), could this be because he sees it as poetic justice ? to be forced to fight in the war he caused for all eternity or be tasked to end it when it's considered un-endable?\n\n- Games title is \"planescape torment\", it could also refer to the ending, not the actual cycle of his rebirth, but his penalty for his original crimes to live the consequenses of his crime for all eternity.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nAditionally :\n\n- He also refers in the \"true\" ending where he merges with his mortality that he is being guided by greater powers and ALWAYS was guided by them, and that they wouldn't leave him be now that they know who he is. Perhaps he was part of some larger game between chaos and law ?"
