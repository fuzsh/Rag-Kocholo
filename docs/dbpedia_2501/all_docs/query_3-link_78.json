        "text": "Nature Morte/Still Life: 19th and 20th Century Prints and Drawings\n\nThis exhibition features fourteen European prints and drawings from the 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nInformed by 19th century global travel and scientific exploration, French and English artists produced meticulous botanical renderings. Twentieth-century artists captured the domesticity of objects in still lifes both realistic and abstract."
