        "text": "Denmark, 1950s\n\nOil and collage on canvas.\n\nSigned.\n\nMogens Andersenâ€™s works are masterful examples of contrast and colour play, varying wildly from image to image. His main interests lay in French Modernism, and he spent long periods in Paris until 1964; his friendships with Pierre Soulages and Jean Bazaine allowed him to develop his signature dark arabesques. After settling back in his home country of Denmark, he continued working until he lost all sight at 82. During his lengthy career, Andersen received the Eckersberg and Thorvaldsen medals, among various other honours.\n\nH: 91 cm / 2' 11 7/8\"\n\nW: 148 cm / 4' 10 1/4\"\n\nPrice: on application\n\nAdd to enquiry list\n\nPurchasing and Shipping:\n\nWhen buying online at Modernity, you can pay by wire transfer.
