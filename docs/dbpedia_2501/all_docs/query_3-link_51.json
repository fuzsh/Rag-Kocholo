        "text": "Overlooking the Bombay Yacht Club, Gateway of India and the new tower of the Taj Mahal Hotel, the brand new permanent location for Nature Morte—co-founded by Aparajita Jain and Peter Nagy—holds a certain wistful allure towards the bustling city of Mumbai. It takes over the third floor of Block A in the historic Dhanraj Mahal at Apollo Bandar, a space surrounded by a strong sense of architectural heritage—and AD100 Rajiv Saini of his eponymous Mumbai-based design firm took note of this while conceptualising the space.\n\n“We didn't want another plain white box gallery. And we wanted something that had a feeling of the city,” Peter tells AD India, and the raw, unfinished look of the space conveys this seamlessly. Inspired by the pared-back architecture of Tadao Ando, Saini orchestrates a play of steel elements (both stainless and corten) against recycled wood. The roughness adds character, texture to the walls against which artwork is sure to shine. Coupled with his meticulous attention to detail, the space is at once gritty and polished.\n\nAlso read: Housed in Bengaluru's 200-year-old villa, Kaash creates a living archive of Indian craft\n\nMumbai’s burgeoning art scene brought the duo to the city, marking Nature Morte’s fourth location outside Delhi—previously, Nature Morte has explored branches in Berlin, Kolkata and Gurgaon. Nagy reveals, “The taste of Mumbai's art community continues to be challenging, appreciating experimental and progressive art more.” Nagy revived Nature Morte in New Delhi following a founding stint in New York’s East Village from 1982 to 1988. And for a gallery that kicked off its journey as a curatorial experiment that challenges the boundaries of art and pushes conventional notions by championing conceptual, lens-based installation genres, Mumbai and its flourishing art world proves to be perfect breeding ground.\n\nAlso read: Jerry Pinto remembers the history of art in Mumbai as Chemould celebrates 60 years\n\nNature Morte’s art invites users to engage, to explore, to meander through installations—a far cry from the pristine ‘hands-off’ approach of most galleries. “We approach every show as a Still Life, as a collection of objects we put together, hence the name of the gallery,” says Nagy. Celebrated Indian artist Subodh Gupta’s solo show of new works entitled A small village, around the corner, up in the mountain captures this philosophy perfectly.\n\nThis marks his seventh show with the gallery, and it continues his provocative investigations of common objects—manifesting as complex, free-standing sculptures, paintings and wall reliefs. Gupta’s evocative depictions of humble objects act as metaphors for the passage of time, for the human condition, and for the bonds of family and community. His titles for many of these works—such as What's in A Name and Close to the river where wood is burning among others—speak of the discoveries and mysteries associated with travel and the theatre of life.\n\nAlso read: KNMA's Prussian Blue unpacks the colour's historical significance and myriad connotations\n\nCuratorially speaking, Aparajita and Peter are curious about how their bevy of artists—many of whom come from architectural backgrounds such as Martand Khosla, Asim Waqif, Ayesha Singh—will react to the strong visual and architectural character of this gallery space in Mumbai. They also want to open doors for artists who might not have had strong representation in the city before, with a sprinkling of international names. A melting pot of culture, Mumbai welcomes any and all art forms with open arms—and the experimental Nature Morte is yet another feather in her cap."
