She also teaches Audiovisual Distribution in the Universitat Internacional de Catalunya.\n\nABO announces \"Concise Collections on Teaching Eighteenth-Century Women,\" a new series that seeks to promote the teaching of eighteenth-century women writers and artists who remain seriously underrepresented in university classrooms, beyond a small collection of now-canonical authors.\n\nIn ABO’s Pedagogies section, we seek to publish groupings of three to five short articles focused on a specific female author/artist/grouping in each of the next six issues. The issue on Charlotte Lennox (Spring 2022) has now selected six proposals and is closed to further submisisons.\n\nUpdated Submission deadline!\n\nThe general conference theme “cultures of collectivity” presents some very current and relevant possibilities for the study of late antique and medieval English languages and literatures. Any proposal that considers this theme in general will be welcome, but two foci will be of particular interest.\n\nFirst, the study of book culture and literacy has been a growing field in recent years both in terms of groups of readers and groups of texts. This approach might address ideas concerning reading communities, literacy and education, book sharing, book production and combining of texts as complete or excerpted works, and use and re-use of books or texts over time.\n\nTheatre and Performance Research in an Age of Conspiracy\n\nTaPRA-SCUDD 2021 Postgraduate Symposium\n\nFriday 25th June 2021, Online (GMT)\n\nWhile you here do snoring lie, Open-eyed conspiracy His time doth take.\n\nIf of life you keep a care, Shake off slumber, and beware: Awake, awake!\n\n– William Shakespeare, The Tempest (c. 1610-1612), Act II, scene 1. Song, line 295."
