        "text": "In business, things very rarely go according to plan. Here's my number one example of that. When I first launched Retold, I had 2 big clients lined up. 2 companies with whom I planned to have 4-5 figure monthly deals over the course of at least 6 months. I was excited. I was ready. We'd talked it over, and things were looking promising. That was back in November 2023. By February 2024, I was officially wrapping things up with one of those companies after a few months of working together. We weren't just failing to get on the same page -- we weren't even in the same book. What about the other company, you ask? We never even started working together. They decided to go in a different direction, and our partnership never even had the chance to come into fruition. By March 2024, my client list was looking completely different than anything I could have foreseen for Retold in November 2023. Some whom I'd just met. Some whom I'd met in previous years but didn't know I'd be working with. Some who popped up out of nowhere and ended up being my favorite people to work with. Moral of the story? You can plan all you want in business, but life will always have other plans. And also, don't count your chickens before they hatch! What's one of the most important lessons you've learned in your career thus far, whether as an employee or a business owner? #Business #Marketing #ContentMarketing #Founder ----------------------------------------------- Hi there, I’m Marina, founder of a B2B Content Marketing Agency called Retold I can help you with… → Content Consulting → Content Creation → Content Strategy → Content Distribution → LinkedIn Profile Optimization → LinkedIn Personal Branding I’m just a DM away :) 𝗣𝗦: 𝗗𝗠 𝗺𝗲 '𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗𝗬' 𝘁𝗼 𝗴𝗲𝘁 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗙𝗥𝗘𝗘 𝗰𝗼𝗽𝘆 𝗼𝗳 𝗺𝘆 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝗹𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗮𝗿 & 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗠𝗮𝗿𝗸𝗲𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗔𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁\n\nAgencies are the worst business model known to humankind… Most people start their own business because they want more: • Time • Freedom • Enjoyment But then go and do something stupid like building an agency. And kiss those dreams goodbye. It starts out fun. You get a few clients and start making really good money. But you get to a point where you start to feel a bit stretched. Then another client joins. And another. And another. Oh god… now you’re really busy. Not seeing your friends or family. Working on Sundays. Unable to hire quality staff to deliver for your clients. So you end up doing it all yourself. If that sounds like you… Here’s what you need to do: 1. Turn your knowledge into a course 2. Build an audience to sell it to 3. Start enjoying life again Agency owners have so much knowledge stuck in their brains. That they could make a fortune from. If only they’d build a digital course. Want to learn how?

Other than the love from everyone (which was humbling) I would have to agree 👉 I underestimated \"pipeline\" and \"sales\"... Got the process fixed in the first 7/10 days and the last 2 weeks have been MEGA (lots of moving conversations now - was shitting myself for a week or so) but yeah... If you're planning on being a founder/co-founder YOU MUST BECOME OBSESSED WITH SALES to start with. Oh! also ADAPT FAST OR DIE! 👉 \"There is no perfect time to launch\" - We developed Processes, planned everything, developed a cool website and (everyone keeps telling me) our branding is sick... It was still not a perfect time to launch AND THAT'S OKAY! 👉 There is a wave of exciting entrepreneurs / experts emerging right now. I have spoken to as many other entrepreneurs and experts as I can this month. They ALL give me so much belief and inspiration. It's infectious working with and speaking to ambitious people everyday - i can't wait to fill Deviation with people like this! 👉 I FUCKING LOVE THIS I wake up hype, I work for 8/10/16 hours and I finish my day as hype as i started it. That's not for everyone and I will never preach that is necessary BUT I love this man and nothing hits like the buzz of a win or exciting development man I know I said 5 bullets... but REPRESENT man! Mind still blown 🤯 🤯 And that has been month 1! We're getting some traction under the wheels, the flywheel has started to turn, we're starting to get this show on the road... Even if I was given a shitter of a team in the sweepstake ;) Let's Go 🔥🔥🔥\n\nI thought niching down was about saying no to everybody who didn’t fit a profile. This stressed me because I wasn’t in a position to select clients. So I felt like I would be leaving money on the table. But it turns out, rather than saying no to people. Niching down is more about specializing in a particular type of client, problem, and solution. And becoming the expert at helping them. It's about attracting and starting conversations with people who have the problem I solve. Because I was relying on hope marketing, I was forced to take any project that came my way out of fear of not knowing when it would happen again. But as I specialized, I could take ownership and do things that would get me in front of the people I could help best. So instead of leaving money on the table, I was replacing it. Instead a group of random projects that spread me thin. I started having the same work, just different people. That gave us control of our processes, our costs, and allowed us to scale. -- If you are struggling to specialize your agency and feel it's holding you back.

I mean, think about it. When was the last time you were excited to answer the door for a stranger trying to sell you something? Or thrilled to pick up a call from an unknown number? Exactly.... ... Never. And yet, so many agents are still being told that this is the way to grow their business. That if they just hustle more... knock on more doors... make more calls... they'll eventually strike gold. But here's the thing: there's a better way. 👉🏼 A way that doesn't involve being a nuisance in people’s lives. 👉🏼 A way that allows you to attract your ideal clients effortlessly instead of constantly chasing them down. 👉🏼 A way that DOESN’T have you chained to your laptop or on non-stop calls all day. And that way is through content creation. And I don’t just mean posting your listings ❌ Or posting market infographics... or replicating your business card in your content pushing people to work with you... I mean actually creating highly strategic content that builds relevancy, omnipresence and intimacy with your ideal clients. Creating content that allows people to know, like, and trust you. Creating content that is saying the right thing at the right time to the right people. When you do this, you free yourself from the trap of spending all of your time trying to get 1-1 conversations. Through content creation and properly showing up online, you’re able to talk to hundreds or thousands of potential clients at the same time through the power of social media. So if you're tired of the old-school, high-pressure tactics that never seem to work... If you're tired of cold calling and chasing down leads all day every day and want a system that allows you to build relationships at scale… Comment “GUIDE” below and I’ll send you The Listings Lab Method Guide for free to start learning how! 👇🏼 #coaching #realestate #realestateadvice #realestatemarketing\n\nYou have a course, digital product, or group program, and you want to launch it. ...so you can make sales and actually help the people you want to help. The problem is, you don't know what to say, or how to talk about your offer in a way that connects with the right people, and isn't Shamwow-level over-the-top cringey. 🤦♀️ And let's not forget you're writing your own copy on top of preparing the thing you're selling, serving clients, running a business, and being a human with a life. It can be stressful and overwhelming. It can also keep you from ever launching the thing in the first place. 🫤 Or instead of a launch, you do a flick: \"Here’s my offer. Buy it or don't. I'm going back to sleep.\" Stop wasting your time and wearing yourself out. Just hire me to do it for you. 👋 Here's the deal. Over the next month or so, I'm changing my Copy in a Week offer into a more complete experience to help you go from \"launching someday\" to launching within the next few weeks. And that also means the price is going up. When I relaunch the offer, it will be at least $5K, possibly more. And it will still be an incredible value. I have space for ONE beta project this month. You will get a launch strategy session and plan, copy for a sales page, copy for 6 launch emails, and copy for 6 social posts (repurposed from emails). You will get all of this in a week, so you can get your funnel done and launch your offer with a whole heckuva lot more ease than if you did this by yourself. I cannot guarantee big launch numbers, but I can help you set realistic launch goals and determine how to make the most of your launch. And I can tell you that clients have used my copy to make money repeatedly. The investment is $4,000 if you book by August 31. If you want the ONE spot I have open, message me. We'll get on a call to figure out if this offer makes sense for you right now. If it doesn't, I will tell you. 💜 #launchcopy #launchstrategy #salespage #copywriter\n\nHaving trouble attracting high-quality clients for your agency? Or maybe your offer seems a lot like everyone else's, making it hard to stand out? You're not alone. The agency space is more now competitive than ever. (Especially with the market becoming so saturated over the last few years) But what if I told you there's a way to close more high-quality clients, at bigger prices, with faster onboarding, and fewer people? All it takes is a few simple changes to your offer and positioning... ... and it's all in my new full step-by-step Agency Offer guide where I show you: 🚀 How to create an offer that attracts 2-5x more high-quality clients... ... and makes them easier to close at higher prices. 🚀 Simple (but powerful) positioning strategies to make your agency stand out... ... and boost your cold outreach conversion by 2-3x with just a couple tweaks. 🚀 How to structure your offer for faster onboarding with a smaller team... ... so you can increase your profit margins while cutting your operating costs. 🚀 Real-life case studies of clients who've scaled their agencies applying these changes to their offers. 🚀 And much more on how you can grow your agency just by tweaking your offer and positioning! 👉 Click the link in the comments to watch the full guide now! (It's a total game-changer) - Kilian\n\nI spoke with 26 founders in different niches and found their 2 biggest challenges with building an online presence: (Also how I will solve them) It was closer to 50 over the past few months but these are the results, based on real data: 1) How, when & what to post 2) Time management issues Or in other words: it takes too much time to post consistent content. Most agencies solve this by offering ghost-writing. \"We'll write everything for you\" I disagree. Your goal is to build trust at scale, so is there anything better than your words to do that? And what's even worse... You will waste more time communicating & re-aligning with an agency than you save. But it doesn't have to be this way... You can produce your own high quality, lead generating content in 1h a day. If that sounds a lot... You spend more time on 1-1 calls. Personal branding is doing that AT SCALE... Okay so what's the solution? The time spent isn't the actual issue here. It's the fact that that you don't know if you're spending that time correctly. Because a founder wants to spend their time on the most needle moving tasks. So if the main goal of building an online presence is to become that thought leader and drive traffic to your business, you need one thing... Consistency. Because a personal brand is nothing but a consistent projection of who you are and what you do. This also makes it easy to monetize because if you have consistent traffic, you can apply this traffic to sales systems so you can convert them. It took me months to figure out a way to do this consistently. (233 days to be precise) So this is why I'm launching an agency that solves this problem. A agency that show you how to project your personality consistently but helps to grow and scale it for maximum ROI. This is what you should be outsourcing. Not the thing you are good at: Building trust. Thoughts on this? That's it for today. See you tomorrow , if you follow me :) Also likes help out a lot (just started on Linkedin)\n\nI STARTED MY AGENCY 4 YEARS AGO AND DIDN’T KNOW A SINGLE THING ABOUT IT… And these are some things I wish I knew back then. ⚡️ Being visible once or twice isn’t gonna cut it — stay consistent. You don’t have to be visible everyday, what works for you works. But you can’t just try once or twice and say it doesn’t work. ⚡️ You have to learn the skill before you delegate — I know how we delegate things esp things that aren’t our expertise but you still gotta know how it works, well for many reasons. ⚡️ You don’t need to master a skill or factor before starting, but it’s important that you have a foundation for basis of your improvement. You can’t just…believe in yourself + bad work + charge premium ≠ success in the industry. ⚡️ The two most important things, after the product or service itself is SALES & MARKETING. Without that, the business is dead. ⚡️ There’ll be clients who aren’t aligned for you but are other people’s dream clients. Find people with the same flow and vibe as you. ⚡️ You have your own goals, dreams, and path. Stop looking at everyone else’s and listening to everyone else’s advice just because it worked for them. Sometimes, you gotta figure sht out for yourself. (And yes including this post!!) ⚡️You need to know yourself so well - strengths, weaknesses, motivators, goals to perform the best way you can. ⚡️ Fix your systems even if you’re not scaling yet! Trust me, you’ll need it in the long run. ⚡️ Your systems should be in place and strong enough to replace anybody and everybody. Be system dependent, not people dependent. ⚡️ You need to get people to line up for you, not the other way around chasing prospects. ⚡️ What works for you, works for you. And you only. You need to trust your gut to evaluate your next move. Here’s to bringing our businesses forward! 🥂 #socialmediamarketing #marketingagency #contentstrategy #socialmedia #contentcreation #businessowner"
