        "text": "Ok, I have noticed I am not the only one who is a huge from of the classic game Planescape: Torment. So in honor of what is IMO the greatest electronic RPG of its time, and maybe all time, let us discuss and reminisce about the likes of Morte the floating skull, and Fall-from-Grace, the Lawful Good succubus cleric.\n\nLet us start with just one of the many nuggets of PC and NPC interaction gold that is Morte.\n\nHive Dweller: (Referring to Morte) Oh, look! A floating skull!\n\nMorte: Oh, look! A talking turd!\n\nEh. I liked the book. Felt just like playing the game, to me - since that's what it practically was: just another play through of the game. But it's been, what, 15 years since I've read it? So maybe I'm full of crap here.\n\nI also enjoyed the three books based off Mass Effect; fun scifi action books. And the Star Wars book Revan was decent, but definitely felt lacking in the end. I never played the video games and didn't realize it was based off a video game until afterwards, so when it ended I didn't realize that t was leading into the next game in the series.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with books based on games is that they assume you've played the game and then skip the descriptive details. Or they throw in characters for the fan to go \"hey! I know that guy!\" but the casual reader has no idea what's going on. Sometimes that's fine for small stuff, but the gimmick gets old quick. And it definitely shouldn't be used as an excuse to skip explanations or descriptions. But I see it happen a lot.\n\nI had the same issue with the most recent Drizzt Do'Urden novel - he threw in characters he expects you to know, despite the book being Book 1 in a trilogy. And despite it being a prequel to the Out of the Abyss campaign. A book that's a prequel AND Book 1 of a trilogy should absolutely not require background knowledge from othe books by the same author. I don't care if you're using the same characters, stop skipping explanations and descriptions.\n\nbookrat wrote:\n\nEh. I liked the book. Felt just like playing the game, to me - since that's what it practically was: just another play through of the game. But it's been, what, 15 years since I've read it? So maybe I'm full of crap here.\n\nBear in mind there are two different \"books\" -- the official novelization by Roy and Valerie Vallese (where Annah is an ugly old lady and the Nameless One is given a name) and the \"fan\" novel, which is where a fan just took the text from the game itself and edited into a narrative by a fan named Rhyss Hess. Notably, the latter is the \"book\" packaged with the GOG.com version of the game.\n\nThe official novelization shouldn't have felt like a playthrough of the game since so many details were in fact different--the plot was only very loosely connected. Although of course if you or anyone liked it, that is by all means your right and pleasure! Nonetheless if someone says, \"the novel was awful,\" they're almost undoubtedly talking about the Vallese novel, which is criticized heavily FOR changing so many details.\n\nThe Hess edit IS a playthrough of the game, pretty much. Although IMO it could actually use MORE editing, it is pleasurable to read because it's the in-game text and the in-game text is pleasurable to read (at least to fans of the game!). (Honestly, I'm kind of surprised Chris Avellone never became a novelist. After all the massive amounts of game text he's written it would be a breeze.)\n\nJust clarifying because some folks talking about the \"book\" may in fact be talking about two different texts. I know some are indeed talking about the Vallese novel."
