        "text": "Chris Avellone has his hands full these days. As one of the lead designers on the new Planescape: Torment project, he's got to walk the fine line between staying true to a loyal pen and paper user base and making a fun computer game. So far it seems he and the rest of the Planescape team have been doing a hell of a job. We caught up with Chris recently and asked a few questions about the new game and where it's headed. What we learned is that Planescape is definitely going to be a game unlike any other that RPG fans have yet seen. We also learned that Chris can be a little psycho when it comes to halflings. Bilbo beware...\n\nIGN-PC: Planescape is a license that Interplay has been sitting on for quite a while. What took y'all so long to get around to developing a title?\n\nChris Avellone: Many different factors came into play. There were several ideas that Black Isle had been toying around with. We first had to decide exactly what kind of a game we wanted to develop to get the most out of the Planescape license. After a lot of bouncing around and concepting and more concepting, it was finally decided that we wanted to do an additional game utilizing the Bioware InfinityÂ¿ Engine from Baldur's Gate. So here we are.\n\nIGN-PC: There's a lot of hype surrounding this release already, in what way is it really going to be different from other RPGs?\n\nCA: Other RPGs, you see a death screen, you reload. In Torment, every time you hit the death screen, the plot advances.\n\nThere are no dwarves; no elves; no swords and no goddamn halflings. No killing the evil wizard Foozle. No big artifact that spells doom for the world.\n\nWe have inventory items that talk to you. Strange locations -- pillars of talking heads, human anthills beneath mountains of garbage, ring-shaped cities that hover above infinitely tall spires. Pubs where angels and demons sit and talk with each other. A game where internal character development is the focus of the game...your player character is the puzzle you're trying to solve. Who are you? How did you get to this state? Forget about saving the princess, destroying the artifact, killing the wizard, demon lord, or whoever the all-powerful evil entity is this week. In Torment, the quest is you and what you can discover about yourself as a player character. You build your character based on ACTIONS you take in the game, not by moving points around on a character generation screen.\n\nAlso, Torment plays around a lot more with the AD&D rules than most AD&D games ever have. The Planescape license and the universe itself allow a lot more flexibility than most AD&D settings have, and it even encourages it. In addition to the new creatures we've created, you'll see typical AD&D creatures in a different light, either in new roles or with totally radical personalities.\n\nIGN-PC: Tell us a little bit about the main character. How did y'all come up with the idea of an immortal as a player character?\n\nCA: Death in most RPGs is just a cue to return to the load screen. Or a reason to stop playing the game for the evening... the death screen in an RPG is probably one of the main reasons that make people turn off their computers and go to bed for the night. We asked ourselves, what would happen if there were no death screen? Wouldn't it be one more reason to keep playing to the wee hours of the morning? You could have an uninterrupted gaming experience if the death screen literally helped advance the plot.\n\nThere's more to it than that, though. We wanted a character that could have horrible things happen to his physical body, and he'd get better. Wouldn't it be cool to have a character whose body could be used as a tool to help solve certain puzzles? On top of it, it poses all sorts of challenges from game design standpoint. If the player doesn't have to worry about death, what kind of new challenges and threats can you introduce to maintain the same level of \"fate\"? We've come up with a whole bunch of them...\n\nPlanescape is a strange setting, and it can be pretty intimidating at first. We wanted to make sure we're not intimidating the player right from the start. The player should have the chance to explore this new world without fear... at least at first. That way he can pay much more attention to the surroundings and have more fun with them, rather than worrying about being stabbed to death or peppered with arrows every other screen.\n\nIGN-PC: What about the other characters that your player comes in contact with? Tell us a little bit behind their concepts.\n\nCA: We have a number of strange allies that can join your party. There is a puritan succubus, a ghostly suit of armor that's too obsessed with justice to realize it's dead, a walking, talking logic cube that talks to his crossbows, and a bunch of other whacked out characters. They all have their own agendas, and more often than not, these agendas intersect with your own.\n\nThe ally you're going to interact with the most with is Morte. He's a floating, smack-talking skull (eyeballs still intact for the purpose of giving him more expression) who's the first character you run into in \"Torment\". He's been around for a long time, seen a lot of the planes, and he's more than happy to dispense advice for the player character during the game. He acts as kind of the player's encyclopedia, compass, and even hint book on occasion. He's not really an effective combatant (his bite can only do 1-3 points of damage), but he has amassed such a collection of insults over his lifetime that he can literally taunt a target into attacking, or even taunt them to death in certain cases. Morte is also there to break the tension every once in a while. The Planescape universe can get pretty serious and grim at times, and Morte is a means by which we can inject a little humor and sarcasm into the game.\n\nIGN-PC: From what you've told IGN-PC earlier, the monsters that players will have to deal with in this game are very different from those found in other Dungeons and Dragons worlds. Can you give us an example of a couple of different monster types?\n\nCA: We have some new monsters that have never been encountered in an AD&D game, and we also have some conventional AD&D monsters that have a Planescape twist to them. For example, zombies and skeletons aren't necessarily your enemies in Planescape... they're usually found as janitors or custodians in a lot of places you go to, and they will go about their duties even while a huge battle is raging all around them. Some of the AD&D creatures are not commonly encountered outside of Planescape. We introduce Modrons, logical (and sentient) geometric shapes that live on a plane composed out of gears, and the Dabus, custodians of the City of Doors that communicate only through floating word puzzles. They're probably two of the tamest examples of creatures you can encounter in Torment.\n\nIGN-PC: You're using a modified version of the same engine that's to be used in Baldur's Gate. What kind of modifications did you make?\n\nCA: The most obvious modification we did is clearly the scale. We zoomed in on the action much more than Baldur's Gate did. This has a number of benefits for us. The art comes across with a much higher level of detail and gives us the chance to work more on intricate designs. It also creates more of an intimate feeling for the player because he cannot see as far as in a different scale. While it does not give you the kind of \"overview\", it certainly creates much more of a subliminally \"unsettling\" atmosphere, which perfectly matches our vision of the Planescape's setting. On the other hand, this change leads to higher memory requirements than Baldur's Gate, but since we are generally handling memory management slightly different, this doesn't necessarily reflect on the end user specs. Other changes can mostly be found in the games' Artificial Intelligence (AI) where we have created a different core, due to our different requirements for the game. Many of the elements Bioware created for their Infinity Engine have been enhanced or furthered by us. We took them and look closely to find how we could completely tax the system. Making a number of adjustments, it's amazing, just how far we could go sometimes.\n\nIGN-PC: The art in Torment already looks pretty amazing. What did you use for inspiration in the game's art direction?\n\nCA: A lot of inspiration for the work is from the original Planescape manuals... We felt it was the most faithful approach and would do TSR's spikey, dark and weird vision the most justice. Anything else (from a book on rusty farm machines to a little sketch drawn on a greasy napkin) is fair game for inspiration. Beyond that, we blended a lot of the stuff that stews around in our funky imaginations. During our pre-production, the art team and the design team sat down and laid out the framework for all the art in the game. What's very cool is that we have allowed time to polish the art to our own satisfaction, to avoid feeling rushed. This may not seem like much, but the relaxed mood allows the artists to create their amazing work.\n\nIGN-PC: The Outer Planes are a pretty dangerous area, filled with gods, demons and the like. How hard has it been to build a game in which the character has the potential to come in contact with such powerful antagonists? How did you handle the problem?\n\nCA: Planescape has never really been about fighting everything you come across. That's what makes it so cool. In a number of the Planescape adventures you could encounter some really powerful creatures, including Gods, Titans, Pit Fiends, and the situation always provided the players, no matter what the level, with some means of dealing with these NPCs that didn't involve trying to kill them. We projected the same approach on Torment and brought in some elements that helped combat the problem.\n\nÂ¿ Your character is pretty tough. He can't lock horns with Gods, but he can inconvenience them quite a bit. Â¿ To keep it true to the Planescape universe, there's always an option other than kicking the crap out of every creature you encounter. You can trick them, bribe them, reason with them... but you can still kick the crap out of them, too. Â¿ You might run up against powerful antagonists, but you can make some powerful friends over the course of the game... some friends that join your party can make greater demons hesitate before attacking.\n\nIGN-PC: One of the original designers of the Planescape universe, Zeb Cook, is on staff at Interplay. How has this helped your team in the development of this project?\n\nCA: Although he's not directly associated with the project, Zeb is an invaluable resource because he's two thousand years old. Aside from being able to tell us what the dinosaurs really looked like, he's been gaming for most of his life. He knows the foundation of the Planescape universe, and he, like Colin McComb (who also wrote a ton of Planescape material), have plenty of ideas on how to improve the game, and they both help check the game for consistency.\n\nIGN-PC: Tell us a little bit about the team you've assembled. What prior experience have they had in game design?\n\nCA: The team is rather small for contemporary development standards with ten members. Most of them have long years of experience in creating computer games and have worked on a number of titles before, but still we have been able to uncover a number of new talents, who bring in some refreshingly different visions.\n\nGuido Henkel is the producer of the title. Guido is probably best known for his allround work on the \"Realms Of Arkania\" series and as the former president of Attic Software before he decided to join Interplay. He is making sure everything \"happens\" and ties everything together, making sure all aspects of the game's development are covered appropriately.\n\nTim Donley is the project's lead artists who has worked on a number of Interplay titles, including Starfleet Academy, Carmageddon, Redneck Rampage, and Red Asphalt.\n\nChris Avellone is the project's lead designer. Chris used to work in paper games before and also did work on Starfleet Academy, Fallout 2, Red Asphalt, Die by the Sword, and Conquest of the New World.\n\nIGN-PC: How long do you think it's going to take players to get through your game? Will there be any reason for them to want to play again?\n\nCA: Playing time is impossible to estimate a this point, and even later, it is always a rough guess because you will always have people who manage to solve any game within a third of your estimation. We are currently shooting for thirty to forty hours of gameplay. It might not seem extremely long for an RPG, but quite frankly we feel that most RPGs are just too big. It makes you wonder how many people actually finish those games. We have put a lot of focus on the game's resolution and we want to make sure people do not lose interest in the game for any reason, and drop it before they actually played it to the end.\n\nWe have a number of plot lines and potential seeds in the game that will allow for quite a bit of replayability. We hope we can instill this feeling in the player that he asks himself, what would have happened if... ? Since the game is about the character's internal development, as opposed to gathering material items only, this question becomes more intriguing as the game goes along.\n\nIGN-PC: What has turned out to be the most difficult part of developing this title?\n\nCA: Leaving the office...\n\nIGN-PC: What's next for your team? In a perfect world, what kind of game would you develop next?\n\nCA: Well, in a perfect world, we would probably all enjoy our success on the sunny beaches of Belize until the end of time. Seriously, though, we're so absorbed in Torment right now that it's hard to step back and take a look at the next project. We've got some ideas kicking around, but we'll see how they pan out."
