Morte Rictusgrin

A mimir is a magical construct designed to provide information on all aspects of life on the Outer Planes. The floating skull Morte is a mimir and the Nameless One's companion. He is a 2nd-level fighter but obviously limited in his weapons and inventory slots. He is skilled in biting and begins the game as having Chaotic Good alignment.

The Lead Designer, Chris Avellone, provided the following colourful description of Morte:

A smack-talkin' floating skull companion, who's kind of your compass, encyclopedia, friend, and resident jackass. His only real combat attack is his bite and the fact that he's gathered such a repertoire of insults over the centuries that he can literally taunt people to death.

Morte's weakness is female zombies so you'll have to keep on eye on him. As described by Guido Henkel (initial Project Director):

Lets say you're trying to sneak out of an area, when all of a sudden there a female zombie shows up. Morte, our nice little sarcastic skull, has a total thing for female zombies. He just has to shack up with them. And although you are trying to sneak out somewhere, Morte will walk right up to the zombie and start talking her up. That, of course, destroys your whole plan because you have no control over his actions at that point.
