        "text": "Australians Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde were known as “The Woodies” and were one of the most successful doubles pairing in the history of tennis. Woodbridge won all four Grand Slam titles in doubles and mixed doubles, was a former world number one, and won an Olympic gold medal. Woodbridge’s professional career spanned from 1988 to 2005 where he earned more than $10 million in prize money.\n\nOn the ATP Tour Woodbridge won 83 doubles titles with the vast majority coming either with Woodforde or Sweden’s Jonas Björkman. Woodbridge’s first doubles title came in March 1990 in Casablanca with Simon Youl as his partner. His first title with Woodforde came just under a year later at the Donnay Indoor Championships in Belgium. The Woodies would play together for the best part of a decade until Woodforde retired from the sport in 2000. Woodbridge then partnered with Björkman until the end of 2004.\n\nWoodbridge reached 20 Grand Slam doubles finals where he won 16 titles; 11 with Woodforde and 5 with Björkman. The Woodies won the Australian Open (1992, 1997), Wimbledon (1993–97, 2000), the US Open (1995–96), and the French Open (2000). Woodbridge and Björkman then won the Australian Open (2001), Wimbledon (2002–04), and the US Open (2003). Woodbridge won his first mixed doubles title at the 1990 US Open with Liz Smylie as his partner. Woodbridge then won the 1992 French Open and the 1993 Australian Open with Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, before going on to win the 1993 US Open and the 1994 Wimbledon championship with Helena Suková. Woodbridge’s final Grand Slam mixed doubles title came at the 2001 US Open when he played with Rennae Stubbs.\n\nWoodbridge competed in four successive Olympic Games; 1992 Barcelona, 1996 Atlanta, 2000 Sydney, and 2004 Athína. Once again his best results came with Woodforde with the pair winning gold in Atlanta and silver in Sydney. After his retirement from the sport Woodbridge worked as a commentator for both the Seven Network and the Nine Network. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2010."
