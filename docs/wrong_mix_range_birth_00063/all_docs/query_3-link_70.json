        "text": "Rybakina made headlines after winning Wimbledon for a reason other than her success. The 23-year-old was born in Moscow and represented Russia until 2018, and was able to go on and lift her maiden Grand Slam title at the All England Club this year despite Russians and Belarusians being banned because she represents Kazakhstan instead.\n\nThe world No 26 made the decision to change citizenship years before the ban came into place but benefitted from representing Kazakhstan, with Russian players currently also banned from competing in team competitions like the Davis Cup and Billie Jean King Cup in tennis’ response to the war in Ukraine. And it appears that dozens of players are hoping to follow in Rybakina’s footsteps and ditch Russia and Kazakhstan.\n\nSpeaking to Championat, the vice president of Kazakhstan’s tennis federation claimed that 30 Russian tennis players had applied for Kazakh citizenship. “Until today, there were more than 30 applications,” Yuriy Polskiy said.\n\nJUST IN: Novak Djokovic Australian Open ban verdict given by Todd Woodbridge\n\nWhile the majority of players looking to change allegiances were juniors who had not yet started their professional career, Polskiy revealed that some adult pros were also interested in representing Kazakhstan though did not name anyone. He continued: “They are mostly children, from 12 years old and up. There are also professionals, adult players who would like to make such a transfer.”\n\nThe Kazakh tennis vice president explained that some were unable to represent Kazakhstan because of the International Tennis Federation’s rules around the ‘World Cup of tennis’ tournaments - the Davis Cup and the Billie Jean King Cup. “But not everyone can, because if you have played for the senior national team of one country, in the Davis Cup or the Billie Jean King Cup, you cannot play for another country,” he said.\n\nAnd Polskiy also revealed that some current top Russian players had considered moving to Kazakhstan in the past, as Rybakina and ATP world No 43 Alexander Bublik did early in their careers. “Of the current Russian national team, I mean both men's and women's, of those who are at the top of tennis, many thought about the possibility of \"moving\" to Kazakhstan, but those decisions were not realised for various reasons,” he admitted.\n\nDON'T MISS\n\nKyrgios praised for new attitude after 'sheepish' reaction to Aus Open\n\nMurray holds his nerve to seal Gijon Open quarter spot after tie-break\n\nNadal thanks tennis fans as Spaniard confirms wife and son both 'well'\n\n“By the way, that process happens all the time, it happened a month ago, it will happen in five, ten years. Especially now we have many requests from players from Russia, Belarus and Ukraine for such a transfer.”\n\nWith Kazakhstan becoming a tennis nation in demand, he explained their selection process for players looking to switch allegiances. “We are wise enough to choose only those who are interesting to us, because our priority is local players. But, when we see that a tennis player is in a situation, as Jelena was, that they will either finish playing, or they will receive support and continue, then the president of our Association gives a chance,” Polskiy added."
