        "text": "Mark Woodforde first told Todd Woodbridge to shut up during the\n\nbest-of-three doubles final at the 1991 Donnay Indoor\n\nChampionships in Brussels. They had won the opening set against\n\nLibor Pimek and Michiel Schapers 6-3 and were leading 3-0 in the\n\nsecond. \"We'd never made a final before, and Todd couldn't stop\n\nyapping,\" says Woodforde. \"He was so nervous, he was frothing at\n\nthe mouth.\"\n\nWhile Woodbridge frothed, Pimek and Schapers fussed. \"Those guys\n\nwere in total disarray,\" Woodforde says. \"In fact, they had gone\n\ninto the tank.\"\n\nStill, Woodbridge fretted. During the changeover, he asked his\n\nmore experienced partner, \"What if they rally and win the next\n\ntwo sets?\"\n\nWoodforde counseled, \"Just stay calm, play normal, and we'll win.\"\n\n\"But what if....\"\n\n\"Look across the net. They're screaming at each other.\"\n\n\"But what....\"\n\n\"Todd, shut up!\"\n\nHe did, and they won the set 6-0 for their first title.\n\nForty-one tournament championships later, Woodbridge says, \"I've\n\ngotten better.\"\n\n\"A lot better,\" says Woodforde. In fact, he hasn't told\n\nWoodbridge to shut up since.\n\nShutting up these Australians is one thing; shutting them down\n\nis another. In a kind of March of the Woody Soldiers, the finest\n\nmen's doubles team of the past decade consolidated its dominance\n\nin 1996, finishing atop the rankings for the third time in five\n\nyears and winning 12 of the 13 finals they made (the most since\n\nJohn McEnroe and Peter Fleming won 15 in 1979). Last July they\n\nbecame the first pairing this century to win Wimbledon four\n\nconsecutive times. Then, after winning Olympic gold in August,\n\nthey became the first Open era duo to successfully defend a U.S.\n\nOpen crown. Their victory last week in the Australian Open was\n\ntheir eighth Grand Slam doubles title, a team record in the Open\n\nera.\n\nYet in the singles-minded world of contemporary tennis, the\n\nWoodies travel in obscurity. \"We're not like Boris Becker or\n\nAndre Agassi, getting our bums wiped at every tour stop,\" says\n\nWoodforde.\n\n\"People never know who we are,\" says Woodbridge. \"Even umpires.\"\n\nFor the uninitiated, the 31-year-old Woodforde is the steady,\n\nsturdy senior partner. At 25, Woodbridge is more like an\n\nunbridled colt. He's usually polite, almost courtly with\n\ninterviewers. He does, however, possess a wasp's nest of a\n\ntemper, which he usually directs at his equipment bag--once\n\nnearly shattering a watch within.\n\nWhile the Woodies have healthy singles rankings (Woodbridge is\n\n32nd, Woodforde is 44th), doubles prowess has accounted for more\n\nthan half of their winnings: Last year each made $676,593 from\n\ndoubles, compared with Woodforde's $655,434 and Woodbridge's\n\n$404,040 from singles. But while they don't care who their\n\ndoubles opponents are, there's one singles player they both\n\ndread: the other Woody. \"It's like playing your wife,\" says\n\nWoodbridge, who is 5-2 against his partner.\n\n\"To keep Todd happy,\" explains Woodforde, \"I have to lose.\"\n\nThrough seven years of Woodwork, Mark and Todd have maintained\n\nan unshakable friendship. \"They're amiable and approachable,\"\n\nsays doubles specialist Grant Connell of Canada, \"but a little\n\nremoved and isolated from the rest of us. I've known the Woodies\n\nfor almost 10 years, and it wasn't until a few months ago that\n\nthey asked me to dinner.\"\n\nThe Woodies like to hang together (\"We always exchange Christmas\n\ncards and gifts,\" says Woodforde), but they live apart--2,500\n\nmiles apart. Woodforde and his girlfriend, Erin Quigley, share a\n\nhouse in Mission Hills, Calif. Woodbridge and his wife, Natasha,\n\ncall Orlando home. Todd and Natasha met through her older\n\nsister, Nicole Bradtke, who happens to be Woodforde's mixed\n\ndoubles partner. Also, Mark was Todd's best man at his wedding\n\nin 1995. \"It all gets so incestuous,\" says Natasha.\n\nAt their most cohesive the Woodies move as a single organism,\n\nanticipating each other's games and reactions. Lacking\n\noverpowering serves, they confound opponents with an array of\n\ndinks, sharply angled volleys and off-pace returns. \"Most teams\n\nhave a weakness you can key on--a feeble backhand volley or a\n\nslow second serve,\" says Connell. \"The real strength of the\n\nWoodies is that they have no weaknesses.\"\n\nWoodforde was five when he was given a racket by his father, a\n\ntennis pro at a club in Adelaide. At eight he vowed, \"Some day\n\nI'll be good enough to earn enough money to buy Mum and Dad a\n\ndishwasher.\" When he was turned down by the state-run tennis\n\nschool, Mum and Dad took out a loan to bankroll him on the tour.\n\nBy the time he was good enough to spring for a dishwasher, his\n\nparents had already bought one.\n\nIt may have been puppy love that drew the 23-year-old Woodforde\n\nto McEnroe, perhaps the best and most carnivorous of all doubles\n\nplayers. \"Like most pros,\" Woodforde recalls, \"I thought John\n\nwas a bit of an a------.\" But in 1988 McEnroe, then 29, was\n\nlooking for a partner, and Woodforde had just beaten him twice\n\nin singles--most memorably at the U.S. Open. Mustering his\n\ncourage, Woodforde made a pitch. \"So,\" snapped McEnroe, \"just\n\nbecause you beat me two times in two weeks, you think you're\n\ngood enough to play doubles with me?\"\n\nWoodforde mumbled, \"Uh ... yeah.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that,\" McEnroe responded, and upon that\n\nfoundation of mutual respect a doubles team was built. \"My\n\nthinking at the time was simple,\" says McEnroe now. \"If you\n\ncan't beat 'em, join 'em.\"\n\nWoodforde reminded McEnroe of Rod Laver: \"He was an Aussie, a\n\nlefty and had red hair.\" The southpaws played seven tournaments,\n\nwinning three, including the 1989 U.S. Open. When McEnroe\n\ndissolved the union in 1990 to focus on singles, he told\n\nWoodforde to find a righthander who was younger and, preferably,\n\na countryman, to help with communication. Woodbridge fit the\n\nbill: He was Sydney-born and fresh out of the Australian\n\nInstitute of Sport, the school that had rejected Woodforde.\n\nThese days, the Woodies' biggest doubles trouble is a lack of\n\ncompetition. Although many women pros regularly play doubles to\n\nsharpen their skills at the net, the top male players rarely do\n\nso, finding the pay too meager, the risk of injury too great and\n\nthe scheduling too erratic. \"Doubles is a poor relation to\n\nsingles,\" laments Woodforde.\n\nYou wouldn't know how poor from looking at the ATP Tour's 1997\n\nmoney winner list, in which Woodbridge ranks second ($263,011)\n\nand Woodforde fourth ($223,011). But once a few more rich\n\nsingles purses have been collected by other players, the\n\nWoodies' rankings will shift rapidly downward. It is, after all,\n\na different financial universe in doubles. At the world\n\nchampionships in Hartford in November, the total prize pool for\n\nthe 16-man event was $500,000, less than half the $1.34 million\n\nPete Sampras got for winning the world singles championships\n\nthat same month. \"I think that's appalling,\" says Woodforde,\n\nwhose victory in Hartford was worth $82,500.\n\n\"Is Woodforde kidding?\" snickers McEnroe. \"He and Woodbridge\n\nonly split 165 grand for beating Grant Connell and Byron\n\nSomebody. Come on! They should be looking up to the Lord and\n\nthanking him for getting paid anything to beat those guys. The\n\nfact is that the Number 1 doubles team in the world today\n\ndoesn't sell any tickets.\"\n\nAnd that's no knock on Woodies.\n\nCOLOR PHOTO: LANE STEWART When Team Woody (from left, Mark and Erin, and Natasha and Todd) gets together, spirits rarely flag.
