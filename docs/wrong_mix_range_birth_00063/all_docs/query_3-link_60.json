        "text": "About the book\n\nThis picture book tells the story of Jackie Ormes, the first Black woman cartoonist to be nationally syndicated in the United States. She was also a journalist, fashionista, philanthropist, and activist, and her artistry brought joy to people everywhere. But in post–World War II America, Black people were still being denied their civil rights, and Jackie found herself in a dilemma: how could she stay true to her signature “Jackie joy” while remaining honest about the inequalities Black people were fighting against?\n\nThis event is presented in partnership with Southern Delaware Alliance for Racial Justice (SDARJ).\n\nAbout the author\n\nWhen Chicago native Traci N. Todd was born, her parents decided her initials should stand for dynamite, just like her father’s. He raised her on Ray Charles and Nina Simone, and her mother read to her, instilling a love of literature. Todd, a children’s book editor, is also the author of Nina: A Story of Nina Simone.\n\nTodd is one of three authors on the Children’s Author Panel Discussion, moderated by Nancy Sakaduski.\n\nNancy (Day) Sakaduski, an award-winning writer and editor, founded Cat & Mouse Press in Lewes in 2012 to support local authors and produce books that are humorous and entertaining. Writing for children and adults, she has authored 24 published books.\n\nPurchase the book\n\nPlease help support local independent bookstores by purchasing this book at Browseabout Books, official bookseller of the History Book Festival. Online sources and digital versions are tempting; however, supporting local brick and mortar shops helps to preserve our vibrant main streets. Drop by Browseabout, order books online, or call the store at 302-226-2665. You also may purchase a copy at biblion in Lewes.\n\nAbout the Festival\n\nThe History Book Festival is the first and only book festival in the United States devoted exclusively to history. With the help of our presenting funding partners — Delaware Humanities and The Lee Ann Wilkinson Group, Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices I PenFed Realty — as well as our program and community partners, volunteers, and donors, the 2023 History Book Festival will be full of great discussions with authors of newly published narrative nonfiction and historical fiction. Our Keynote Address is presented by Sally Mott Freeman and John K. Freeman, and our Closing Address is presented by Dogfish Head Beer & Benevolence.\n\nSpecial thanks to our program partners for their continuing support: the Lewes Public Library for event promotion and venue; Browseabout Books in Rehoboth Beach, official bookseller of the History Book Festival; Lewes Chamber of Commerce for event promotion, and the Cape Gazette and Delmarva Public Media, our media partners.\n\nAdditional thanks to our community partners: ACLU Delaware, Beebe Healthcare, CAMP Rehoboth, Historic Lewes Farmers Market, Lewes Historical Society, Rehoboth Art League, Rehoboth Beach Historical Society & Museum, Seaside Jewish Community, and Southern Delaware Alliance for Racial Justice (SDARJ)."
