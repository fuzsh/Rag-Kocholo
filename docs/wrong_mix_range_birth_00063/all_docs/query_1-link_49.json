        "text": "Juniors\n\nIn juniors, Woodbridge made the finals of the Jr Australian Open in 1987 and 1989, and Wimbledon in 1989.\n\nPro tour\n\nHe is best known as one of the top doubles players in the world for most of the 1990s and into the early 2000s (decade). His primary doubles partnerships were first with fellow Australian Mark Woodforde and later with Swede Jonas Björkman. Woodbridge and Woodforde are often referred to as \"The Woodies\" in the tennis world. Woodbridge also had a career high singles ranking of 19 after reaching the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1997, beating Michael Chang, Marcos Ondruska, Alex Rădulescu, Patrick Rafter and Nicolas Kiefer before losing to Pete Sampras. He did however have the distinction of being one of the few players to beat Sampras at Wimbledon, knocking him out in the first round in 1989.\n\nThe Woodies won a record 61 ATP doubles titles as a team, including 11 Grand Slam events. After Woodforde retired from the tour in 2000, Woodbridge established a partnership with Björkman that resulted in five Grand Slam titles in four years. At the end of 2004, Björkman ended his partnership with Woodbridge. According to an interview Woodbridge granted to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Björkman wanted him to play more weeks on the tour, but Woodbridge wanted to limit his time away from his family as much as possible.\n\nWoodbridge then took on India's Mahesh Bhupathi as his new partner, who had just been dumped by Belarusian Max Mirnyi. Coincidentally, Björkman and Mirnyi ended up partnering together. In the 2000 Sydney Olympics, he partnered with Woodforde to reach the final. In the fourth set tie-breaker against Canadians Sébastien Lareau and Daniel Nestor, he served a double fault to lose the match. He was a member of the Australian Davis Cup Team, playing the most ties (32) of any player.\n\nWoodbridge announced his retirement at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships after 17 years as a tennis professional and 83 ATP tournament doubles titles, an all-time record at the time now surpassed by the Bryan brothers. According to the ATP website, he finished his career with US$10,095,245 in prize money.\n\nAfter retirement\n\nIn 2006 and 2007, Woodbridge joined the Seven Network's commentary team for the Australian Open.\n\nHe also became an ambassador for bowel cancer awareness group \"Let's Beat Bowel Cancer\". A Cabrini Health initiative.\n\nIn 2007, Woodbridge joined the 6th season of Dancing with the Stars, the Australian version. In 2008 and 2009, Woodbridge aligned himself closely to the sailing community through his commitments at Hamilton Island Race Week hosting tennis clinics and wine tasting events.\n\nWoodbridge served as the tournament director for the 2009 Australian Open legends event. In July 2009, he was appointed coach of the Australian Davis Cup Team, taking on a newly expanded, full-time position that merges a role as the national men's coach overseeing the male player development pathway with the Davis Cup coaching job.\n\nIn January 2010 on Australia day, The Woodies were inducted to the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame for their achievements in tennis. As a part of the induction ceremony, their bronzed statues were placed with other great Australian tennis players at the Melbourne Park. In July 2010 The Woodies were inducted to the International Tennis Hall of Fame.\n\nIn January 2011, Woodbridge was confronted on court by Belgian player Kim Clijsters for comments he made via SMS to Rennae Stubbs alleging Clijsters was pregnant. In June that year, Woodbridge started anchoring the Seven Network's Wimbledon coverage.\n\nPersonal life\n\nTodd and Natasha Woodbridge married on 8 April 1995 in Melbourne; they have two children Zara, and Beau.\n\nSingles performance timeline"
