        "text": "NEW HAVEN — Advocates and unhoused residents are vowing to fight to keep an encampment open after the city issued Amistad Catholic Workers LLC a notice of violation Tuesday and ordered it to stop using six prefabricated shelters on Rosette Street.\n\nA state marshal delivered the papers to property co-owners Mark Colville and Luz Catarineau-Coville at the tail end of a previously scheduled press conference held in 90 degree heat on a day when the city and state both had their hot weather protocols activated. The order came now that a 180-day temporary certificate of occupancy expired Monday.\n\n\"We'll keep fighting and we'll win,\" said Todd Godek, one of the residents in the shelter community. \"You can't knock us down lower than we've already been.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nHis wife, Suki Godek said the Rosette community had a positive impact.\n\n\"I think it saved my life,\" she said. \"It allowed me to stay with my husband and my dog ... I'm able to take my medications for my mental health every day and I know they'll be safe.\"\n\nThe 180-day allowance seems to be at the center of the community's ability to stay. City officials have said the state gave the community a 180-day permit that can't be renewed, while advocates say it's in the city's power to extend it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nOn Tuesday, Leigh Appleby, a spokesman for state Department of Administrative Services, issued an updated statement that reiterated the municipal building departments are responsible for permitting projects and enforcing the State Building Code in their areas. However, the statement added temporary structures are only allowed for 180 days.\n\n\"Anything erected longer than that must meet the State Building Code for permanent structures,\" Appleby said. \"Temporary structures still need to conform with the structural strength, fire safety, means of egress, accessibility, light, ventilation and sanitary requirements of the code.\"\n\nHe said these structures don't meet a number of the requirements for the foundation, insulation, sanitary provisions and fire. The structures also don't meet the strength thresholds for wind and snow.\n\n\"Once the permit expires, the temporary structure and membrane structures must be taken down,\" Appleby said, adding people have an expectation the structures they're in are safe. \"Building codes are put in place to ensure just that. It is the responsibility of municipal building officials to assure that all structures are up to code and are safe environments for all occupants.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nCity and state officials have said New Haven's Housing and Homeless Services Department is ready to help the residents with longer term solutions.\n\nMayor Justin Elicker was out of the office when the group of advocates and residents went to deliver its statements in person Tuesday and ask him to reconsider having the power shut off to the the community, but his chief of staff, Sean Matteson, stood nearby and listened to the group's concerns.\n\n\"We're just trying to follow the rules as we know them to be,\" Matteson said.\n\nCoville said the city needed to make the zoning permanent for the Rosette Neighborhood Village, and create other communities like it on a larger scale.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n\"We will not be vacating these tiny homes,\" Colville said.\n\nIn a hint of what may be to come, Sean Garganelli McCreight, a member of the Rosette Neighborhood Village Collective, a faith-based support organization that has raised money for the shelters, said that in addition to violating the rights of the people who live in the shelters, shutting down the shelters interferes with the support group's right to practice religious activities.\n\n\"Our hope would be for a corrective solution,\" McCreight said.\n\nMembers of the Rosette community touted the benefits of the small homes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n\"During the past nine months, a micro-neighborhood of tiny homes for unhoused New Haveners has taken shape and been allowed to flourish in the backyard of 203 Rosette St. in the Hill with both the consent and cooperation of all the surrounding neighbors and homeowners,\" said Suki Godek, a resident of one of the six shelters who also was one of the residents evicted from the former \"Tent City\" encampment off Ella T. Grasso Boulevard near the West River on March 16, 2023.\n\nShe said while new in New Haven, this model of emergency shelters has been successfully used across the country.\n\n\"The reason for its success is that it literally restores unhoused individuals and families to the status of neighbor,\" she said. \"Its benefits are even more visible in the obvious physical and mental health improvements experienced by those who have been fortunate enough to dwell in these homes. Most of us know very well the trauma of being criminalized and evicted simply for having no place to go. For us, the Rosette Village means the end of the brutal way of life.\"\n\nTyrell Buckner, another resident in the community, said the people who live in the tiny homes don't want to be in an institutional shelter and this gives them a chance to be neighbors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\n\"Today, we wish to send a clear message to the mayor ... These are not 'shacks,'\" said Tyrell Buckner, another resident. \"These are our homes.\"\n\nJoel Nieves, another resident, said he ended up living in the Rosette community after making the decision 1 1/2 years ago to \"get sober and get off drugs,\" only to learn that support he got from the state to go through a program ceased when the program ended.\n\n\"I've been homeless since I finished my program,\" he said. \"Mr. Mayor, I say to you, 'Am I not human? Do I not deserve to live, as you do?'\"\n\nHe later said outside Elicker's office, \"We are sick and tired of being treated by your office as less than human.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nColville accused the city of using the state building code to overturn the city's Board of Zoning Appeals' earlier 4-1 approval.\n\nThe prefab shelters in the Hill section, which the city initially called for Amistad to dismantle after the group put them up without the proper permits, were able to remain under a temporary, 180-day building permit.\n\nWhile the BZA gave the property a variance so the shelters fall on the right side of city zoning, they're still illegal units, Elicker said Monday. For the shelters to be legal under the state building code, each would need a bathroom and kitchen."
