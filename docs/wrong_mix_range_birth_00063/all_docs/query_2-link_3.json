        "text": "Inducted into the Australian Tennis Hall of Fame in Jan 2010; inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2010; Sport Australia Hall of Fame Legend 2008.\n\nWoodbridge formed half of one of the most successful doubles combination in history, pairing with compatriot Mark Woodforde to win 11 Grand Slam doubles titles and five straight Wimbledon titles as well as an Olympic gold medal at Atlanta in 1996.\n\nFrom 1996 to 1997 the 'Woodies' came within one match of holding all four major doubles titles simultaneously, winning the Wimbledon, US Open and Australian Open trophies before falling in the French Open final. Woodforde retired shortly after the pair claimed the 2000 Roland Garros title - completing their Grand Slam set - and Woodbridge began a successful partnership with Sweden's Jonas Bjorkman that reaped a further five major doubles titles.\n\nPart of Australia's winning Davis Cup teams in 1999 and 2003, Woodbridge retired after the 2005 Wimbledon championships with a record-breaking 83 doubles titles. He also proved an adept singles player, peaking at world No.19 in May 1997, reaching the Wimbledon semifinals the same year and winning two career singles titles."
