        "text": "Mate Pavić is the most talented men’s-doubles specialist to emerge in a generation. In May, at the age of twenty-four, he rose to No. 1 in the world, the youngest player to accomplish that since Australia’s Todd Woodbridge—who, with fellow-Aussie Mark Woodforde, was a member of the legendary doubles team known as the Woodies—did so in the early nineties, when he was barely into his twenties. Pavić is tall, six feet four inches, and brings Novak Djokovic to mind: he’s lean, sinewy, dark-haired, and stubbly bearded, with a palpable intensity and an assassin’s stare on the court. He moves like Djokovic, too, with a first step as explosive as that of anyone in tennis, and is able to change direction on a dime.\n\nPavić was born in Split, Croatia, and was being coached by his father on a tennis court at a younger age than most of us learn to ride a bike. He played some singles at the start of his pro career but seldom won. (He reached no higher than No. 295.) Maybe he didn’t have the gladiatorial temperament that singles requires. Or maybe he realized that he had skills that would serve him better in doubles: trigger-quick reflexes and a comfort at the net, where singles doesn’t get played much anymore. Perhaps he simply noticed that he tended to win when he played doubles: as a teen-ager, he was part of a duo that won the Wimbledon boys’-doubles championship.\n\nHis partner on the tour in recent years has been Oliver Marach, of Austria. Marach is thirty-eight, which, these days, makes him more or less a typical men’s-doubles player. Only four of the top twenty doubles players on the men’s side are under thirty. (The Bryan brothers, who have dominated doubles in this century, turned forty earlier this year.) Marach possesses twenty-one career doubles titles, a number of them earned with Pavić. Earlier this year, they won the Australian Open.\n\nThey entered the U.S. Open as the No. 1 seed. In doubles, that honor doesn’t come with quite the same trappings that being a No. 1 singles seed brings; their first-round match, held late on Wednesday afternoon, was on Court 15, on a distant edge of the Open grounds, and the several hundred fans on hand arranged themselves as comfortably as they could on several rows of courtside metal bleachers that had spent the day baking in the ninety-plus-degree heat. Doubles players are used to this, of course—used to being on the periphery of the game. A championship-doubles’ winner will receive three hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or about a tenth of what a singles’ champ will earn. The big sponsorship deals elude them. And television has found no way to make room for them, despite the fact that the game can be mesmerizing, and that if you play tennis and have reached a certain age—the age, say, that you land your first job out of college—you are probably playing doubles.\n\nThough, let’s be clear: you aren’t playing remotely the doubles that men on the pro tour play today. Chip-and-charge? Not so much. The serves are as big as those over at the stadiums where singles matches are unfolding. They are not getting chipped back. They are not getting returned successfully very often—a result not only of the pace of the serves, but of the looming presence of today’s bigger, stronger, faster players, who command the net while their partners serve, threatening to cut off returns and thus pressuring the returner to thread the needle. Pavić, at the net, anticipates, pounces, feigns, leaps, lunges, and, in general, terrorizes his opponents. In another life, he might have put on a few pounds and played cornerback in the N.F.L.\n\nPavić and Marach’s opponents in their first-round match were João Sousa, of Portugal, and Argentina’s Leonardo Mayer. Neither was ranked in the doubles’ Top 50. But, because of those big serves and tight return windows, holding serve in men’s doubles is fairly routine, break points are rare, and matches are rarely lopsided, even when a top-ranked duo is playing an unseeded opponent. It often comes down to a few points here and there. And so it was in the heat and obscurity of Court 15 on Wednesday.\n\nMayer and Sousa never saw a break-point opportunity in the first set. Marach and Pavić saw two and earned one when Pavić, a lefty playing on the deuce side of the court, as lefties tend to do, drove an inside-out forehand crosscourt so deep and flat and hard that all Sousa could do was sort of block it back. Marach met the floating ball at the net and angled it out of reach into the alley and off the court. Set One: 6–3, Marach-Pavić.\n\nDuring the second set, Pavić seemed to be everywhere: smashing overheads, knifing stab volleys, absorbing flat forehands aimed at his net-hugging midsection with reflex volleys. I lost count of how many volleys he hit for winners—along with how many of his serves went unreturned. At one point, he shanked a volley that somehow fell, with luck, for a winner, and he laughed, raising his arms in a theatrical shrug toward his opponents. They laughed, too. Pro-level doubles can convey the fun of the game in ways that singles, with its lonely warriors, has a tougher time doing.\n\nBut, for all Pavić’s brilliance, Mayer and Sousa were solid in the second set, and there were no breaks of serve—and so it went to a tiebreak. And here Marach, who had been struggling with his first serve through much of the match, double-faulted twice, the last one giving Mayer-Sousa the set. A half-hour later, late in the third set, Marach double-faulted again, on a break point, putting him and Pavić down 5–6 and, a game later, when their opponents held their serve, out of the Open. Marach sat next to Pavić during the changeover after his double-fault, smashing his racquet and hanging his head. Pavić did what doubles partners do: draped an arm over his shoulder to convey that it was no big deal.\n\nPavić left the court with a security minder who would guide him through the crowd on the long walk back to the players’ locker room over by Arthur Ashe Stadium. He was nodding and smiling at something the guard was saying. He had to know, because players do, how well he had played. He had to know, because players need to, that there would be more afternoons, better afternoons, to come."
