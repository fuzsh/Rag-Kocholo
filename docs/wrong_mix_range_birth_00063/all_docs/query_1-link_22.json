        "text": "Bio Together Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, known as \"The Woodies,\" earned a record 61 ATP doubles titles, including 11 majors. The pair held the record for the most doubles wins in ATP history, until it was tied by Mike and Bob Bryan in May of 2010. They were the first team to win five straight Wimbledon titles, and the only team in the Open Era to win at least one Grand Slam doubles title for six consecutive years. Their 11 Grand Slam titles as a team are an Open Era success story, and are second only to John Newcombe / Tony Roche's record of 12. The duo was named ATP Top Doubles Team five times (1992, 1995, 1996, 1997, 2000). The Woodies won two Olympic Medals - Doubles Gold (1996) and Doubles Silver (2000), and were hailed as the Australian Davis Cup's \"Best Doubles Team\" with a record of 14-2. In addition, both Woodbridge and Woodforde held singles rankings within the top 20.\n\nWoodbridge currently holds the ATP record for most doubles titles (83) in Open Era history. He spent 204 weeks at No. 1 throughout his career, and has a career doubles record of 782-260. He holds the Australian Davis Cup record for the most years played (14 years); most doubles wins (25); and was a member of the winning team in 1999 and 2003."
