It is time again to preview the Paris Masters, the year’s ninth and final ATP Masters 1000 tournament, and as usual I’ll deviate from the normal.\n\nLast year, I had discussed how difficult it has been for some top players to win at the Accor Arena. Besides, I also largely focused on how the tournament became the career highlight of many fringe players, who were consistent for most parts of their careers no doubt, but not good enough to break the hegemony of the bigger stars, at the game’s biggest stages.\n\nEven as the 51st edition of the prestigious tournament gets underway in the coming week, I’ll focus on a player who was mentioned as an afterthought in the abovementioned post.\n\nMaking headlines off the court"
