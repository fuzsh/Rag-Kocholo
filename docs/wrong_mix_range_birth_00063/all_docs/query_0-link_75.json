        "text": "When the marvellously unfiltered Bernard Tomic confessed on Rod Laver Arena that he was ''absolutely not'' looking forward to meeting fellow tennis trickster Alexandr Dolgopolov in tonight's third round, he was not telling Dolgopolov - or the Ukrainian's reliably hilarious Australian coach Jack Reader - anything new.\n\nSo what, specifically, is it about Dolgopolov that so troubles Tomic, who has lost all three previous clashes between the two? ''The physical threat,'' quips Reader, jovially, of his whippet-like 183-centimetre charge against the 195cm Tomic.\n\nNo, Jack, let's be serious. ''You'd have to ask Bernie. It's Bernie that doesn't like playing Alex. Alex likes playing Bernie.'' And why, exactly, is that? ''Because Bernie doesn't like playing him. You always like someone who doesn't want to play ya.''\n\nWelcome to Reader's world, and one of the more unlikely double-acts in the game: the Lancashire-born Adelaide resident and knockabout chain-smoker with the dated mullet hairdo, mentor to the flamboyant son of a Ukrainian tennis coach who plays an exuberantly free-spirited but not always super-consistent game.\n\nYet as much as Reader may be a mine of oddball one-liners, he is also a purist in some respects. He knows Tomic and his coach and father, John, and admires the Queenslander as a natural, thinking man's tennis player rather than one of the metronomic baseline stereotypes that Tomic's off-pace tactics and rhythm-breaking ways can so frustrate.\n\n''A couple of years ago people were saying that Bernie needs a big forehand, needs more weapons, and I said to him, 'Bernie, carry on how you're going', because he's a student of the game. He's learning to play tennis, and as he gets along, the hitting of the ball, that's the easy part.''\n\nExcept against Dolgopolov, a fellow rhythm-breaker who dropped just seven games to a passively flat-footed Tomic in their first meeting, at the 2009 Brisbane International. Then, in Sydney 12 months ago, Tomic won the first set tie-breaker but then just three more games. Most recently, Shanghai in October, in a fourth-round match relocated by rain to a quick indoor practice court, without a scoreboard, TV cameras or even an umpire's microphone, Tomic won the first set 7-5, but just one more game and clearly lost interest towards the end, appearing at one stage to be walking towards his chair before Dolgopolov's serve had even landed.\n\n''You can see it quite often,'' Reader told us afterwards. ''If it's a guy that's battled to get where he's at, that's really battled, well then they'll keep going, [whereas] someone who's got there a little easier and stuff, they're the ones who tend to throw in the towel a bit.''\n\nYet this week, the child prodigy Tomic has done quite the opposite, retrieving a two-sets-to-love deficit against 22nd seed Fernando Verdasco in serious heat and over more than four hours on Monday. Then, after dropping the first set to power-serving Sam Querrey, he took the next three with a composed and astute round two effort in prime time.\n\nAfterwards came that refreshing but slightly eyebrow-raising confirmation of Todd Woodbridge's admission that Dolgopolov's style ''actually rattles Bernard more than any person I have seen on the circuit these past couple of years''. Interesting.Tomic's take on it is that, yes, it is difficult, and hence the ''tough and weird scorelines''. He recalls Shanghai as ''playing a player that's very weird in a weird court. I won that first set there but he seems to play good tennis and bad tennis for a set. So it's very difficult. You have to just hold your game against him and hope for the best. You can play really good and you can't do nothing sometimes.\n\n''I consider myself very smart and tactical. I know where to get balls to the opponents â€¦ where I can create good shots for me. As opposed to him. I think [he's] very unco[-ordinated] and very weird to play, and I'm sure a lot of players say the same thing about him.''\n\nThe say-it-as-it-is Tomic, meanwhile, is described by Jim Courier as ''the most talked about player right now in the locker room'', where the teenager's critiques of his peers are being accepted as long as he keeps walking the walk at the same time. Tomic has played one less set than Dolgopolov but has spent an extra half-hour on court, and had his third consecutive scheduling wish granted with another night-time fixture on Rod Laver Arena.\n\nReader says his man is ''just warming up'', despite saving a match point against Tobias Kamke on Wednesday after falling two sets behind to Australian Greg Jones in round one. Against Tomic though, Dolgopolov said: ''I won all the three times, so that will give me a bit of confidence. For sure I know how to play him.\n\nLoading"
