        "text": "“Arbitrage” is a slick, independently financed bit of business about a hedge-fund honcho’s encounter with the morally slippery slope.\n\nGiven its subject matter, the movie shares some things with last year’s superior indie financial drama “Margin Call.” Like that film, this one opens in a season that four years ago rattled the globe to its fiscal core. The tremors continue. And like that film, the title is likely to have non-financial types consulting the dictionary.\n\n“Arbitrage” also boasts veteran actors doing fine work, among them Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Tim Roth. “Arbitrage,” too, premiered at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nUnlike “Margin Call,” however, writer-director Nicholas Jarecki’s debut narrative feature, while dramatically diverting, does little to further our understanding of money and the people who move the largest piles of it around the globe.\n\nInstead “Arbitrage” is a fairly traditional family drama with thriller undertones cast in the world of high finance.\n\nWhen we meet Robert Miller (Gere) on his 60th birthday, he seems to have it all — or much of it: a gorgeous Manhattan townhouse. A lovely, attuned mate in Ellen (Sarandon), children who love and honor him. Daughter Brooke (Brit Marling) appears to be a pitch-perfect heir to the family business.\n\nAlas, Robert quickly turns out to want more. He returns his family’s adoration then escapes to his girlfriend’s apartment. One-time supermodel Laetitia Casta portrays Julie, the French art dealer who grows increasingly frustrated with their arrangement.\n\nWhile Robert juggles wife and mistress, he is even more desperately attempting to sell his company before banks open his books and learn how much of his clients’ money he’s lost on a bad bet.\n\nGere’s very good at making Robert’s compromises seem more human than horrid. He portrays the philanthropic, philandering patriarch with his customary twinkle.\n\nTo make it clear that Robert’s actions aren’t exactly victimless, Jarecki ups the ante with a horrendous accident. Robert could deal with the aftermath honorably. Instead, he flees then drags a young black man with whom he has a history into his mess. Nate Parker portrays the accidental accomplice with a mix of resignation and a quiet smidge of deserved fury.\n\nBy now we’ve all been schooled to know that it’s not the bad act that will bring you down but the lying and covering up.\n\nWill Robert get nicked by Tim Roth’s zealous police detective Michael Bryer, too fueled by class resentment to root for? Will his moral, financial, marital hypocrisy be revealed?\n\nPerhaps it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Jarecki was inspired by a collection of essays about the financial crisis first published in Vanity Fair called “The Great Hangover.”\n\nOne of the last general-interest magazines standing, the publication mixes brainy (even biting) commentary by flinty minded columnists with fluffy-smart profiles and often tawdry features on the nasty goings-on of the seriously monied or politically connected.\n\n“Arbitrage” inspires the same mix of annoyance, ambivalence and fascination with wealth that Vanity Fair so often does. The mag’s editor, Graydon Carter, even makes a cameo appearance here.\n\nBy the end of “Arbitrage,” fans of “Pretty Woman” will no longer be able to console themselves with that movie’s Cinderella fantasy. No, this is really where Gere’s mergers-and-acquisition specialist landed once he ditched Julia Robert’s reformed hooker.\n\nLisa Kennedy: 303-954-1567, lkennedy@denverpost.com or twitter.com/bylisakennedy"
