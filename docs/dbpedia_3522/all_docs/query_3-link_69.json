        "text": "Dozens of high-profile names — including royalty, politicians and famous scientists — appeared in an avalanche of previously sealed court documents related to Jeffrey Epstein that were released late Wednesday and Thursday and Friday.\n\nThe trove of papers filed in Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre’s 2015 defamation suit against the dead sex offender’s “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell included references to Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton and Stephen Hawking, among other major figures.\n\nThe lengthy list of boldface names paints a troubling picture of Epstein’s double life as an ace financier who used his wealth and connections to victimize dozens of young women.\n\nThe 215 newly unsealed documents, nearly 5,000 pages, were released between Jan. 3 and Jan. 9 — naming more than 170 people with ties to Epstein, including victims and former employees.\n\nMany case records had previously come out but had been heavily redacted.\n\nBefore the document dump, online sleuths speculated about who might be named. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, for instance, did not appear in the documents, but was forced to defend himself from trolls in the hours before the formal release began.\n\nHere are all the A-listers who appeared in the newly revealed documents:\n\nPrince Andrew\n\nIn addition to Giuffre’s allegations she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew while underage, the documents reveal additional claims about the disgraced British royal – including that he allegedly participated in an “underage orgy.”\n\nOne woman, identified as “Jane Doe 3,” testified she was “forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical locations,” according to a 2014 court filing.\n\nThose included Ghislaine Maxwell’s London apartment, an unspecified location in New York and “on Epstein’s private island in the US Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other underaged girls).”\n\nFollow along with everything we’ve found out about Jeffrey Epstein and his associates.\n\nThe filing also claims Epstein told the “sex-slave” to “give the Prince whatever he demanded.”\n\nAnother Epstein accuser, Johanna Sjoberg, said in her own deposition that Prince Andrew touched her breast while they were posing for a photo on a couch at Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in 2001.\n\nIn that same photo, Sjoberg testified the royal also groped Giuffre’s breast with a puppet that looked like him.\n\nEpstein’s former butler, Juan Alessi, claimed Andrew received “daily” massages when he “spent weeks” at his boss’ Palm Beach, Florida, mansion, according to the documents.\n\nIn the wake of the documents’ revelations, the anti-monarchy group Republic reported Prince Andrew to London’s Metropolitan Police and demanded a renewed investigation.\n\n“It’s simple — the royals should not be above the law. Accusations of criminality should always be investigated thoroughly. THAT’S WHY THE MET MUST ACT,” the group posted on X. The Met has not commented on the request.\n\nBoth Prince Andrew and Buckingham Palace have repeatedly denied all allegations against him.\n\nBill & Hillary Clinton\n\nFormer President Bill Clinton’s name appears 73 times in the newly released papers, the Independent noted — but he is not implicated in anything illegal.\n\nAs part of her 2016 testimony, Sjoberg recalled Epstein telling her that Clinton “‘likes them young,’ referring to girls.”\n\nClinton — who flew on Epstein’s private jet multiple times — has denied having any knowledge of the creep’s crimes.\n\nIn documents that were unsealed Thursday night, it was revealed that the former president allegedly stormed into the Vanity Fair newsroom and “threatened” staffers to not publish stories about sex-trafficking allegations against “his good friend” Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe claim was mentioned by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre in a 2011 email exchange with a journalist from the Daily Mail, Sharon Churcher.\n\nSeveral references to Clinton in the document trove relate to Giuffre’s allegation Maxwell told her that she had flown the former president to Epstein’s private island on a helicopter.\n\nGiuffre relayed the story to Churcher, who then erroneously reported that Giuffre was also on board the alleged flight, she explained in a May 2016 deposition that was unsealed on Friday.\n\n“I believe that it was taken out of context. Ghislaine told me that she flew Bill Clinton in. And Ghislaine likes to talk a lot of stuff that sounds fantastical,” Giuffre said of Churcher’s version of events.\n\nIn her own deposition, Maxwell dismissed the story as “another one of Virginia’s lies” — though she admitted that she had flown with Clinton on Epstein’s plane.\n\nLater in the deposition, Maxwell is shown a flight log for Epstein’s plane that includes Clinton.\n\nIn June 2016, Judge Robert Sweet of the Southern District of New York denied Giuffre’s attorneys’ attempt to depose Clinton in her suit against Maxwell, writing that they had not established the “relevance” of the former president’s testimony, a court ruling released on Friday revealed.\n\nClinton’s name and initials of both himself and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, were included on the proposed list of search terms Maxwell’s team was asked to scan her emails and other files for, attorney correspondence indicated.\n\nThe last name “Clinton” appeared on the list, as did “BC,” “HC,” and “HRC.”\n\nGiuffre’s legal team also requested any potential communications between or related to Maxwell and Bill and HIllary as part of discovery, the Friday document trove showed.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nFormer President Donald Trump appeared at least four times in the unsealed documents.\n\nIn Sjoberg’s deposition, she described how Epstein once “called up” the real estate mogul and suggested visiting one of his casinos when Epstein’s private jet was diverted from New York City to Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\n“Jeffrey said, ‘Great, we’ll call up Trump and we’ll go to’ — I don’t recall the name of the casino, but — ‘we’ll go to the casino,’” Sjoberg testified.\n\nSjoberg later added that she never massaged Trump.\n\nIn her own deposition, Giuffre said she was lured into working as a masseuse for Epstein when she was 17 and working as a spa attendant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nAlan Dershowitz\n\nEpstein allegedly forced Jane Doe 3 to “have sexual relations” with his lawyer, former Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz, when she was a “minor,” according to claims in the documents.\n\nThe alleged incidents took place “not only in Florida but … on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,” one filing stated, adding that Dershowitz also was an “eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other minors.”\n\nIn a newly unsealed 2011 email, Sharon Churcher appears to remind Giuffre about Dershowitz’s presence in Epstein’s inner circle.\n\n“Don’t forget Alan Dershowitz… JE’ s buddy and lawyer -good name for your pitch,” Churcher wrote, noting Dershowitz’s ties with Claud von Bülow, who was convinced and then acquitted of the attempted murder of his wife, Sunny.\n\n“We all suspect Alan is a pedo and tho no proof of that, you probably met him when he was hanging put [sic] w JE,” Churcher added.\n\nThree years later — in December 2014 — Giuffre accused Dershowitz of sexually abusing her during her time with Epstein. But she later dropped those claims, saying: “I now recognize I may have made a mistake in identifying Mr. Dershowitz.”\n\nIn her May 2016 deposition, Sjoberg denied Giuffre’s allegations that she had sex with Dershowitz in the back of a limousine while Giuffre and Epstein were present.\n\n“I would remember that [if it happened],” Sjoberg insisted in the transcript released Friday.\n\nDershowitz, 85, has denied all allegations of wrongdoing. He defended himself and Epstein’s other associates earlier this week.\n\n“You could judge them for having shown bad judgment, but you can’t conclude that any accusations against them are true without hearing the evidence,” he insisted.\n\nHe also explained to The Post why it was important to fight the case.\n\nStephen Hawking\n\nEpstein offered a reward to Giuffre’s friends, acquaintances and even family members in order to “help prove” that her allegations that theoretical physicist and cosmologist Stephen Hawking participated in an orgy were false, an unsealed email between him and Maxwell stated.\n\nThe missive from January 2015 said Giuffre’s strongest allegation “is the Clinton dinner, and the new version in the Virgin Islands that Stephen Hawking participated in an underage orgy.”\n\nHawking — whose brilliant career coupled with his battle with early-onset ALS was documented in the Oscar-winning film “The Theory of Everything” — died in 2018 at age 76.\n\nAl Gore\n\nMaxwell’s attorneys requested Giuffre provide photos or videos of herself with several high-profile people — including former Vice President Al Gore.\n\nGiuffre’s team objected to the motion on the grounds that such documents were in “custody and control” of Maxwell and Epstein, the unsealed paper showed.\n\nSjoberg also denied ever meeting Gore in her testimony.\n\nTipper Gore\n\nAl Gore’s wife, Tipper, was also seen on Epstein’s private island, according to Giuffre’s deposition in a since-dropped case against Dershowitz, which was part of the cache of documents revealed in her 2015 defamation case against Maxwell.\n\nThe accuser said she had only seen the Gores at a dinner, chatting to each other.\n\nNeither has ever publicly addressed their alleged relationship with Epstein.\n\nSarah Ferguson\n\nSarah Ferguson was named in a 2009 deposition by Juan Alessi, who was the housekeeper at Epstein’s Florida mansion from 1991 to 2002.\n\nWhile her ex-husband Prince Andrew allegedly “spent weeks” getting “daily massages” at the luxe lair, Alessi said he believes the Duchess of York only visited the property once and “for a short period of time,” according to the documents.\n\nLeslie Wexner\n\nDuring her deposition, Maxwell denied giving a woman an outfit of a sexual nature to wear for Leslie Wexner, Epstein’s financial adviser and one-time business partner.\n\nMaxwell also said she had not communicated with the billionaire L Brands founder — whose ties with Epstein date back to the 1980s — about Giuffre’s lawsuit.\n\nIn the third trove of documents released Friday, Wexner’s wife, Abigail, was name-checked on what appeared to be a notepad or list from Epstein’s Palm Beach home.\n\nAbigail Wexner wanted to talk about something “private,” the handwritten note read.\n\nNew transcripts from Maxwell’s testimony that were released on Friday also revealed that the British socialite confirmed that she knew Epstein.\n\nShe denied, however, knowing whether Epstein accuser Maria Farmer was ever at Wexner’s Ohio property.\n\nIn her own testimony, Sjoberg denied meeting the Victoria’s Secret mogul.\n\nWexner has said he “was never aware of the illegal activity” Epstein was accused of committing.\n\nChelsea Clinton\n\nInstead of giving a deposition in a civil suit filed against her sick beau, Maxwell attended the wedding of former first daughter Chelsea Clinton, according to a trove of court documents unsealed Friday.\n\nThe socialite initially agreed to be deposed after she was subpoenaed in 2009 for Guiffre’s case, the alleged victim’s lawyers wrote in the 2016 motion.\n\n“At the eleventh hour Maxwell’s attorney informed plaintiff’s counsel that Maxwell’s mother was very ill and that consequently Maxwell was leaving the country with no plans to return,” the filing states.\n\nGiven the purported circumstances, her deposition was canceled.\n\nHowever, the now-convicted sex trafficker was photographed watching from the crowd of 400 as former President Bill Clinton walked his daughter down the aisle during the lavish ceremony.\n\n“Maxwell was photographed at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, New York, confirming the suspicion that she was indeed still in the country and willing to say anything to avoid her deposition,” the filing states.\n\nThe claims were made in a 2016 motion asking that Maxwell’s request to conceal her financial assets be denied, arguing that the money proves she was deeply tied to Epstein’s sex-trafficking operation.\n\nBill Richardson\n\nGiuffre testified that Maxwell sent her to have sex with late New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, according to the documents.\n\nSjoberg also recalled hearing about the Democrat being part of Epstein’s circle.\n\n“I want to say that he was supposed to come to dinner when we were in New Mexico. I don’t know if I met him. I believe that he and Ghislaine had dinner separate from myself,” she said in her deposition.\n\nRichardson died in September at age 75.\n\nJean-Luc Brunel\n\nOne of the men Maxwell ordered Giuffre to have sex with was Epstein’s close friend, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, Giuffre testified in 2016.\n\nSjoberg also recalled meeting Brunel at Epstein’s Palm Beach house, but testified that she did not have sex with him.\n\nBrunel died by suicide in December 2020 while in a Parisian prison on charges of raping underage girls.\n\nMarvin Minsky\n\nIn her 2016 deposition, Giuffre claimed that Maxwell ordered her to have sex with computer scientist and AI pioneer Marvin Minsky.\n\nMinsky — who received a $100,000 grant from Epstein in 2002, according to Nature magazine — died in 2016 at age 88.\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nSjoberg claimed to have met pop icon Michael Jackson at Epstein’s Palm Beach home.\n\nShe denied ever massaging Jackson — who died in 2009 at age 50.\n\nDavid Copperfield\n\nSjoberg described magician David Copperfield performing tricks at a dinner at one of Epstein’s homes.\n\n“He questioned me if I was aware that girls were getting paid to find other girls,” she added, noting that the illusionist did not specify what he meant.\n\nTom Pritzker\n\nIn her 2016 deposition, Giuffre claimed to have had sex “once” with Hyatt hotel chain heir Tom Pritzker.\n\nA spokesperson for Pritzker — who is worth an estimated $6.2 billion on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index — said he “continues to vehemently deny” the allegation.\n\nGlenn Dubin\n\nMaxwell “sent out” Giuffre to give the hedge fund billionaire an erotic massage after she completed her “training” as part of Epstein’s entourage, Giuffre testified.\n\n“Ghislaine told me to go to Glenn Dubin and give him a massage, which means sex,” Giuffre said of her encounter with the investor.\n\nDubin’s wife, former Miss Sweden Dr. Eva Andersson-Dubin, dated Epstein for several years.\n\nIn April 2016, Maxwell testified that she and Andersson-Dubin were friends, according to records that were released Friday.\n\nMaxwell was also confronted with testimony from the Dubins’ butler, Ricardo Rizzo, who recalled a time when Maxwell allegedly brought a distraught 15-year-old girl to the Dubins’ house.\n\nIn her own deposition, Sjoberg recalled giving massages to both Dubin and Andersson-Dubin, but said “there was nothing sexual” about the encounters.\n\nThe couple denied Giuffre’s claims against them in a 2019 Vanity Fair article.\n\n“The Dubins strongly deny these allegations, as we first said [in Vanity Fair] in 2019, when these unsubstantiated statements first surfaced as part of this same civil court proceeding,” a spokesperson for the couple told The Post Thursday.\n\nFrédéric Fékkai\n\nEpstein may have procured women for French celebrity hairstylist Frédéric Fékkai, Sjoberg claimed in her deposition.\n\n“I heard [Epstein] call someone, and say, ‘Fekkai is in Hawaii.
