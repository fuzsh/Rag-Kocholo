        "text": "After years of underrepresentation, Amazon Prime Video is among the major streaming services leading the charge when it comes to quality diversity. The best LGBTQ+ movies on Amazon Prime allow people worldwide to feel represented and seen within the medium they so enjoy. Following the considerable success of last summer’s rom-com Red, White & Royal Blue, Amazon is embracing its status as the streaming home for the best content for the queer community.\n\nThe streamer has a healthy collection of films for everyone, regardless of whether they identify as LGBTQ+ or are merely allies. If you’re looking to expand your horizons or watch a movie that feels more representative of you and your life, Amazon Prime Video has you covered with its impressive library of original and acquired movies. Digital Trends has curated a list of the best LGBTQ+ movies on Amazon Prime Video right now, from heartwarming rom-coms to emotional dramas and even a few genre offerings that cement the streamer as a treasure trove for the LGBTQ+ community and its allies.\n\nWhen you’re done going through this list, check out the best LGBTQ movies on Netflix, as well as the best LGBTQ films to stream right now on multiple services.\n\nRecently added to Amazon Prime Video\n\nReaching for the Moon\n\nr 2013\n\nBig Eden\n\npg-13 2000\n\nThe Kids Are All Right (2010)\n\n86%\n\n7.0/10\n\n106m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nJulianne Moore, Annette Bening, Mark Ruffalo\n\nDirected by\n\nLisa Cholodenko\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nAcademy Award nominee Annette Benning stars opposite Academy Award winner Julianne Moore in the 2010 drama The Kids Are All Right. The plot centers on a lesbian couple whose tranquil life gets disrupted by the sudden arrival of the man whose sperm they used to bring their two teenage children into the world. The Kids Are All Right was among the first major films to depict a same-sex couple raising teenage children, breaking new ground with a story grounded in deeply human emotions. Unlike other films, The Kids Are All Right is more concerned with depicting a relatable and complex story rather than sending a message. It isn’t afraid to show its characters as flawed, challenging, and ever-changing, painting a vivid portrayal of the dynamics of a same-sex couple raising a family.\n\nThe Birdcage (1996)\n\n71%\n\n7.2/10\n\n119m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nRobin Williams, Nathan Lane, Dan Futterman\n\nDirected by\n\nMike Nichols\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nA quintessential, widely beloved film for the LGBTQ+ community, Mike Nichols’ The Birdcage has not only stood the test of time but actually gets better every year. The late Robin Williams stars as Armand Goldman, a Jewish gay man and the owner of a drag club in Miami where his partner, the flamboyant and lively Albert, stars as the main attraction. When their son announces he is set to marry the daughter of a conservative U.S. senator, the couple must go out of their way to paint their unconventional family as everything but. The Birdcage is a delightful, hilarious, and groundbreaking entry in LGBTQ+ cinema, a celebration of the drag community and a loving depiction of family and tolerance with a timeless message that keeps resonating today.\n\nTo Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar (1995)\n\n60%\n\n6.7/10\n\n109m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nPatrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, John Leguizamo\n\nDirected by\n\nBeeban Kidron\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe late Patrick Swayze stars opposite Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo in the game-changing comedy To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar. The film follows three drag queens — Vida, Noxeema, and Chi-Chi — as they embark on a road trip to Los Angeles, becoming stranded in a small town and bonding with the people. Widely considered among the first mainstream depictions of drag queens on the big screen, To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar is an ode to life, beauty, and fantasy. Elevated by three spectacular and vibrant performances from its leading trio, the film acts as a love letter to freedom and identity. It is very much a product of its time, but the themes remain poignant and compelling, not to mention hilarious.\n\nTangerine (2015)\n\n86%\n\n7.1/10\n\n87m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nKitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, Karren Karagulian\n\nDirected by\n\nSean Baker\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nShot with three iPhone 5S smartphones, Tangerine is among the most important and impactful LGBTQ+ films of the last decade. This comedy-drama follows Sin-Dee Rella, a transgender sex worker who has recently finished a short stint in jail. After meeting her friend, Alexandra, Sin-Dee learns her boyfriend and pimp was unfaithful while she was away. Determined to learn the truth, Sin-Dee and Alexandra journey across Los Angeles and its many subcultures. Although far from an easy watch, Tangerine is a worthwhile, rewarding, and intimate look into the transgender experience and the enduring nature of real friendship in the face of betrayal. It’s stylized, dynamic, and wholly unforgettable, a crucial film to understand the modern state of LGBTQ+ cinema.\n\nCapote (2005)\n\n88%\n\n7.3/10\n\n114m\n\nGenre\n\nCrime, Drama\n\nStars\n\nPhilip Seymour Hoffman, Catherine Keener, Clifton Collins Jr.\n\nDirected by\n\nBennett Miller\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe late Philip Seymour Hoffman won a much-deserved Best Actor Oscar for his tour de force portrayal of iconic writer Truman Capote in the 2005 biopic Capote. The film depicts Capote’s writing of his magnum opus, In Cold Blood, interviewing the presumed murderers and forming an intimate bond with one of them. Guided by a masterful Hoffman, Capote is a revelatory portrayal of one of modern literature’s most fascinating yet elusive figures. It blends drama with just enough provocative elements to be riveting, yet never descends into cheap sensationalism, largely thanks to Hoffman’s profoundly evocative performance.\n\nFirebird (2021)\n\n49%\n\n7.1/10\n\n107m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Romance, War\n\nStars\n\nTom Prior, Oleg Zagorodnii, Diana Pozharskaya\n\nDirected by\n\nPeeter Rebane\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nSet in the Soviet Air Force at the height of the Cold War and based on a true story, Firebird tells a classic story of forbidden love. The film follows the love affair between Sergey, a young private with weeks left in his training, and Roman, a fighter pilot. Firebird walks familiar territory but offers enough nuance and insight to make this well-known story feel fresh and arresting. At its heart, the film is about love and the sacrifices required to make it work, enhancing its themes with a period setting that reflects real-world politics.\n\nAnything's Possible (2022)\n\n68%\n\n5.7/10\n\n96m\n\nGenre\n\nRomance, Comedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nEva Reign, Abubakr Ali, Courtnee Carter\n\nDirected by\n\nBilly Porter\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nKelsa is a young trans girl going through the typical challenges of senior year. Her life changes when she develops a close bond with Khal, a sensitive classmate who struggles with his future, but their blossoming romance will face many obstacles from their ever-changing classmates. Directed by Emmy-winner Billy Porter, Anything’s Possible is a refreshing take on high school romance, told from the perspective of characters who seldom get to take the spotlight. It’s sweet, charming, and surprisingly intuitive, representing a worthy addition to the over-crowded teen genre.\n\nC.O.G. (2013)\n\n60%\n\n5.6/10\n\n92m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Drama\n\nStars\n\nJonathan Groff, Denis O'Hare, Corey Stoll\n\nDirected by\n\nKyle Patrick Alvarez\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe ever-underappreciated Jonathan Groff leads the offbeat LGBTQ+ dramedy C.O.G., which stands for “Child of God.” The plot follows David, a recent Yale graduate who travels to Oregon to work at an apple factory, determined to earn some life experience outside of his privileged upbringing, eventually finding religion. C.O.G. is witty but sharp, unafraid to explore dark issues through a comedic lens. Groff’s anxious energy is expertly matched by a brilliant supporting cast, including Denis O’Hare, Casey Wilson, and a sinister and scene-stealing Corey Stoll.\n\nPermission (2018)\n\n62%\n\n5.3/10\n\n96m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance, Drama\n\nStars\n\nRebecca Hall, Dan Stevens, Gina Gershon\n\nDirected by\n\nBrian Crano\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nRebecca Hall and Dan Stevens are two of the most underrated actors working today. They shared the screen in the 2018 dramedy Permission, playing Anna and Will, a couple on the verge of marriage who decide to explore their relationship’s boundaries. Morgan Spector and David Joseph Craig co-star as a gay couple who are also testing their bond when they struggle with the decision to become parents. Permission offers enough clever observations into relationship dynamics to become a worthy film about love and connection. What really works here are the performances of a brilliant cast, especially Hall, Stevens, Spector, and the ever-reliable Gina Gershon.\n\nCassandro (2023)\n\n76%\n\n6.5/10\n\n107m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nGael García Bernal, Roberta Colindrez, Perla de la Rosa\n\nDirected by\n\nRoger Ross Williams\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nGolden Globe-winner Gael García Bernal stars as American-born Mexican luchador Saúl Armendáriz, best known as Cassandro, in the eponymous biopic directed by Roger Ross Williams. The film chronicles Cassandro’s rise to fame as an exótico luchador, his life as an openly homosexual man, and his subsequent international success. Cassandro is an exuberant showcase for García Bernal and a worthy depiction of Armendáriz’s legacy, showing how his efforts inside the ring as the “Liberace of Lucha Libre” subverted notions of masculinity in a country famous for its deep-rooted machismo.\n\nSaltburn (2023)\n\n61%\n\n7.1/10\n\n131m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Comedy, Thriller\n\nStars\n\nBarry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike\n\nDirected by\n\nEmerald Fennell\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nAcademy Award winner Emerald Fennell directs Academy Award nominee Barry Keoghan (The Banshees of Inisherin) in the psychological black comedy Saltburn. Keoghan plays Oliver Quick, an Oxford student who befriends the handsome and wealthy Felix Catton and is invited to spend the summer at the Cattons’ opulent home, Saltburn. There, Oliver begins introducing himself into the family’s life, leading to increasingly twisted events. Saltburn succeeds largely thanks to Keoghan’s arresting performance and scene-stealing work from Oscar nominees Rosamund Pike and Richard E. Grant. Its attempts to shock might come off as slightly juvenile, but Saltburn remains an effective study of obsession, envy, and queerness.\n\nMy Policeman (2022)\n\n50%\n\n6.5/10\n\n113m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Romance\n\nStars\n\nHarry Styles, Emma Corrin, David Dawson\n\nDirected by\n\nMichael Grandage\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nBased on the eponymous 2012 novel by Bethan Roberts, My Policeman stars Harry Styles, Emma Corrin, and David Dawson. The plot follows Tom, a policeman in 1950s Britain, who falls in love with a schoolteacher before beginning a torrid same-sex affair with a museum curator. My Policeman is not perfect—the plot meanders, and the message isn’t as impactful as it could be. However, strong work from Corrin and Dawson elevates the material. For his part, Styles does his best, particularly thanks to his chemistry with Dawson, and it’s just enough to keep the film afloat.\n\nThe People We Hate at the Wedding (2022)\n\n42%\n\n5.8/10\n\n99m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy\n\nStars\n\nKristen Bell, Ben Platt, Allison Janney\n\nDirected by\n\nClaire Scanlon\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nBen Platt and Kristen Bell star are struggling siblings in the romantic comedy The People We Hate at the Wedding. The plot centers on Alice and Paul, who travel to England for their half-sister’s wedding. However, tensions rise after years of bottled feelings emerge, leading to a chaotic series of events. Platt’s Paul carries the film’s queer representation, and he does impressively, especially once the film’s twist is revealed. The People We Hate at the Wedding is a tad too formulaic for its own good, but Bell, Platt, and the always-great Allison Janney pull through admirably.\n\nSummer of 85 (2020)\n\n65%\n\n6.9/10\n\n101m\n\nGenre\n\nRomance, Drama\n\nStars\n\nFélix Lefebvre, Benjamin Voisin, Philippine Velge\n\nDirected by\n\nFrançois Ozon\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nA classic coming-of-age romantic drama, Summer of 85 portrays the friendship and eventual romance between 16-year-old Alexis and 18-year-old David over a summer in Normandy in 1985. Summer of 85 thrives for the authenticity it brings to its portrayal of first love and its powerful and enduring effects. Director François Ozon crafts a thoughtful yet raw depiction of queer teen love, unafraid of exploring its darkest corners yet delicate enough to preserve its youthful innocence.\n\nRed, White & Royal Blue (2023)\n\n62%\n\n7.0/10\n\n121m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance\n\nStars\n\nTaylor Zakhar Perez, Nicholas Galitzine, Uma Thurman\n\nDirected by\n\nMatthew López\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nNicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez star in Prime Video’s rom-com Red, White & Royal Blue. Based on the bestselling novel, the film chronicles the romance between a British prince and the son of the president of the United States. Sweet, funny, and surprisingly steamy, Red, White & Royal Blue is a throwback to the classic romantic comedies of the 1980s and ’90s. The charming leads and supporting cast of familiar faces make Red, White & Royal Blue a perfect film for a satisfying afternoon at home.\n\nMy Fake Boyfriend (2022)\n\n5.2/10\n\n100m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance\n\nStars\n\nKeiynan Lonsdale, Dylan Sprouse, Samer Salem\n\nDirected by\n\nRose Troche\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nThe Prime Video original My Fake Boyfriend stars Keiynan Lonsdale, Dylan Sprouse, and Sarah Hyland.

His meddling friends create a fake boyfriend to help him get over the mess, but things get complicated when Andrew meets a guy he’s actually interested in, only to find himself trapped in a relationship with a fictional man. With a decent premise elevated by a trio of charismatic performers, My Fake Boyfriend is a solidly entertaining rom-com and another worthy entry in Prime Video’s ever-expanding LGBTQ+ catalog.\n\nTell It to the Bees (2019)\n\n50%\n\n6.4/10\n\n106m\n\nGenre\n\nRomance, Drama\n\nStars\n\nAnna Paquin, Holliday Grainger, Emun Elliott\n\nDirected by\n\nAnnabel Jankel\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nOscar-winner and X-Men movie star Anna Paquin co-stars opposite Holliday Grainger in the 2018 period drama Tell It to the Bees.

Gerrard is perhaps the greatest openly gay athlete ever but this doc is more about how Gerrard began his career with legendary Liverpool F.C. at just 8 years old, only to arrive at the top team as it was descending into irrelevance. Gerrard’s arrival soon spurs a triumphant reign in which Liverpool capture two FA Cups, three League Cups, a UEFA Cup, an FA Community Shield, a UEFA Super Cup, and a UEFA Champions League.\n\nMayor Pete (2021)\n\n63%\n\n4.3/10\n\nr\n\n96m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nPete Buttigieg, Chasten Buttigieg, Mike Schmuhl\n\nDirected by\n\nJesse Moss\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nPete Buttigieg took a shot at the presidency. He didn’t win the nomination that ultimately went to Joe Biden, but he did become the most prominent member of the LGBTQ community to run for president and is now the first openly LGBTQ Cabinet member in United States history. The documentary charts Buttigieg’s recent career successes, from serving as the mayor of South Bend to winning the Iowa caucus, up to his appointment as the country’s Transportation Secretary. The documentary also provides insight into his personal life with husband Chasten, although more depth could’ve been provided to that aspect of Buttigieg’s life. Nevertheless, the documentary resonates and provides a symbol for the LGBTQ community that those who don’t identify as heterosexual or cisgender still belong in the pantheons of power.\n\nMy Name Is Pauli Murray (2021)\n\n73%\n\n6.6/10\n\npg-13\n\n91m\n\nGenre\n\nDocumentary\n\nStars\n\nPatricia Bell-Scott, Dolores Chandler, Brittney Cooper\n\nDirected by\n\nJulie Cohen, Betsy West\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nJulie Cohen and Betsy West weren’t looking to find an unsung hero of the civil rights struggle when they first came upon Pauli Murray’s name. Instead, they were delving into the life of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg for the 2018 documentary RBG, and the name of this relatively unknown lawyer and activist kept popping up as one of Ginsburg’s biggest influences. As early as the 1940s, Pauli Murray was fighting for women’s rights and ultimately proved instrumental in adding the Equal Protection Clause to the 14th Amendment. Through archival footage and the extensive recordings Murray left behind when she passed away in 1985, My Name Is Pauli Murray paints an intimate portrait not only of an influential activist whose name has gone unspoken on too many tongues for too long but someone with a surprisingly contemporary understanding of gender that many today are still struggling to wrap their heads around.\n\nEverybody's Talking About Jamie (2021)\n\n62%\n\n6.3/10\n\npg-13\n\n115m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama, Comedy\n\nStars\n\nMax Harwood, Sarah Lancashire, Lauren Patel\n\nDirected by\n\nJonathan Butterell\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nJamie Campbell came out as the drag queen Fifi at a high school prom. The BBC reported on his story with the 2011 documentary Jamie: Drag Queen at 16, which inspired the stage musical Everybody’s Talking About Jamie. Four years after the premiere of the musical, the story was adapted to film with Max Harwood in the eponymous role. Jamie, a lot of critics will tell you, does not break new ground. The film is a story we’ve heard before and are likely to hear again. Regardless, it proves to be a fun and heartwarming musical, with Harwood’s inherent magnetism making up for any narrative shortcomings.\n\nJust Friends (2018)\n\n7.2/10\n\n80m\n\nGenre\n\nComedy, Romance, Drama\n\nStars\n\nMajd Mardo, Josha Stradowski, Jenny Arean\n\nDirected by\n\nAnnemarie van de Mond\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nJoris’ father died almost a decade ago, and while continuing to try and come to terms with the loss, a young Syrian refugee named Yad arrives in his life, working for his grandmother. Despite Joris’ conservative upbringing, he can’t deny the spark that exists between him and Yad, who quickly realizes that they aren’t “just friends” but share a much deeper — and romantic — bond. The hidden gem Dutch romantic comedy is part coming-of-age and part story of love that must defy the odds, familial pressures, and coming to terms with one’s true self.\n\nUncle Frank (2020)\n\n58%\n\n7.3/10\n\nr\n\n95m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nPaul Bettany, Sophia Lillis, Peter Macdissi\n\nDirected by\n\nAlan Ball\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nIn Amazon Prime’s original film Uncle Frank, Paul Bettany (WandaVision) plays Frank Bledsoe — a man about to learn that the secrets we keep from our families can be both more and less important than we ever imagined. Set in the early ’70s, Uncle Frank finds its titular lead living with his lover, Walid (Peter Macdissi). Frank’s pretty sure no one in his South Carolinian family knows he’s gay, but that changes when his young niece, Beth (Sophia Lillis), pays him a surprise visit in New York and discovers her uncle’s true life. Matters are further complicated when news of the death of the family patriarch arrives. Frank and Beth set out on their own to South Carolina for the services, leaving Walid behind because Frank doesn’t want the rest of his family to discover his secret. Walid follows anyway, and the trio has a touching, funny journey to the funeral, where some shocking surprises await them.\n\nMy Best Friend (2018)\n\n6.8/10\n\n91m\n\nGenre\n\nDrama\n\nStars\n\nAngelo Mutti Spinetta, Lautaro Rodríguez, Guillermo Pfening\n\nDirected by\n\nMartín Deus\n\nWatch on Amazon\n\nAlso known as Mi mejor amigo, this Spanish-language Argentinian film is a coming-of-age movie about Lorenzo, a 16-year-old boy in Patagonia discovering his sexuality, with the help and friendship of Caito, a 17-year-old who has been taken in by Lorenzo’s parents.
