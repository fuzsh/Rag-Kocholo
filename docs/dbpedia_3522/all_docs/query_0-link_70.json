        "text": "“Rich and Strange,” Alfred Hitchcock’s second flub of a cruise ship comedy, is proof that the director’s only preferred method of sea transport… should be a Lifeboat.\n\nHitchcock, ever a connoisseur of elaborate elopements and luxury voyages, made it one of his career themes to incorporate his own hobbyist travel into his movies. From his first work, “Pleasure Garden,” filmed partially at a villa on Lake Como, the director showed a knack for taking work along with him on a posh holiday. This surfaces most notably in Hitchcock’s lush later renderings of the many Swiss lodges that cameo in his complex globe trotting espionage plots.\n\nBefore that, though, Hitchcock embarked on two disastrous pleasure cruises: “Champagne,” and “Rich and Strange.”…\n\n\"Damn the pictures and the wireless and the office. I want some life! Life, I tell you!\"\n\nEvery now and then, a movie comes along that just pushes every single wrong button. Rich and Strange, which follows an unhappy young couple who is financially struggling on what is essentially a fairy tale escape cruise when a relative leaves them a small fortune to travel with, is a prime example of this for me. I have no problem with unlikeable protagonists in film. In fact I often prefer it. But they have to be interesting at least. Fred (Henry Kendall) and Emily (Joan Barry) are the furthest thing from it.\n\nUpon embarking on their journey, the two immediately start seeing other…\n\nAn English working-class couple receives some unexpected money from a wealthy relative and decides to spend them traveling to the Far East. During the journey they become involved with other people, putting their marriage in peril.\n\nWhether you see it as a failed experiment to cross genres or simply as a bad day at the office, \"Rich and Strange\" is hands down Alfred Hitchcock's worst film. It starts as a quirky comedy, in the second act takes a deep dive into exotic melodrama, only to become openly comedic again during the final 10-15 minutes. Some of it works but the tonal changes are confusing and there are some parts which are hopelessly dated. The final minutes are something of a…\n\nThis 1931 British film directed by A.Hitchcock bears 2 titles: Rich and Strange, and also East of Shanghai for the American and international market (A l‘Est de Shanghai in French).\n\n„East of Shanghai“ with its exoticism, would definitely appeal to international audiences, and indeed, the plot relies in part on the trope of travelling as a means of self-discovery under the guise of escaping one‘s daily tedious life (here, experienced by a British middle-class couple). The centerpiece of the film is a glitz and glamour cruise on a luxury liner that leads our protagonists from Marseille and Port Said to Singapore, with glimpses of the colonial era in the various countries visited along the voyage. Using rickshaws and buying carpets…\n\n“Somebody just pinched me.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“You know where.”\n\nRough and seasick. Difficult and dangerous. Broke and scared. Rich and strange, I guess.\n\nCute, mostly ship-bound Hitch on holiday. Fred (Henry Kendall), looking for a sea change (he wants life not liver pills) learns that he’s easily sea sick when he and his wife set out on a globe trotting adventure after he’s left an early inheritance by his still-living uncle.\n\nI assume some of the dim modern views on this are due to the fairly repellant character of Fred: rude to cats, speaks poorly of the Chinese, talks down to his wife, stupidly falls for the classic “princess on a boat” scam. I don’t disagree, he sucks, and he doesn’t…\n\nThey say love doesn't buy happiness, but that's especially so when you're a twit like Fred Hill (Henry Kendall). Fred hates his mundane life with his unambitious wife Emily (Joan Barry), to the point of despair, telling her \"the best place for us is the gas oven\". Nice. That's literally five minutes before a telegram arrives from a rich uncle dumping a pile of money on him. Because of course. So off they go on a trip to the Orient, first class all the way.\n\nThis romantic adventure dramedy from Hitchcock is so scattered it can't even make up its mind if it's a silent or not. There are intertitles and long silent sequences with Chaplin-esque story-telling mixed in with…"
