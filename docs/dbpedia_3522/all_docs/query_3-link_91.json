        "text": "It all starts with Sugilite, because, of course, it does. If not him, then it is Obsidian instigating the drama- but no, instead, Obsidian is the one left to bark out a laugh at the telltale purple sticky note on the fridge first thing in the morning.\n\nfull offense but at least have some etiquette whore. we all know you were sucking dick last night and all last night. and if not all of us just me. get ur act straight or ur going straight to the curb\n\nIt’s no secret who the ‘whore’ is. Aventurine, second youngest of the ten (really, the number is more like seven since that’s the amount of people who actually show their faces around here) ‘stonehearts’ who live in this apartment. Zealous, conniving… well, those could be described by everyone else too. Even Topaz, goody two shoes she is, has that side of her.\n\nIndeed, the thing that makes him stand out from the rest of them is… ahem… oh, who is Obsidian kidding- it’s his inability to keep his legs closed! God, the amount of times she’s seen him emerge from the bathroom at parties with his fly down and his lips swollen… she should be owed financial compensation for being a witness, honestly.\n\nStill, to drag someone back here? He’s got guts. Both him, and whoever he was going down on apparently.\n\nAfter letting out a final cackle, Obsidian reaches into the fridge and pulls out the bottle of tomato juice. She then proceeds to pour into a wine glass, pausing to swish the glass and admire the redness. She gulps it down, and lets out a refreshed sigh.\n\nHaha. It’ll be good to make fun of Sugilite over next time she sees him though.\n\n“Better him than me,” she hums smugly to herself in the empty kitchen, pouring herself another glass.\n\n**\n\nPearl observes that, today, exactly a week after a purple sticky note was stuck upon the fridge’s surface (which was hastily discarded by Aventurine), an ashen grey sticky note has taken its place.\n\nu little shit. you know how much i value my beauty sleep and i get woken up by your stupid dirty talk right outside my door about someone 'dripping'?? how the fuck do you turn someone on with that? keep it in ur pants or buy me some earplugs you prick\n\nAlthough it is crudely worded and, additionally, has incorrect grammar, if Pearl was put in that situation, she would most likely hold the same sentiments. Though, to have the same problem of being overheard occurs twice…\n\nIt is most likely the same person Aventurine is bringing over. Perhaps, someone he loses himself in? She could never envision such a possibility, though it’s not as if it could have ever been something she would have thought to ‘calculate’.\n\nPerhaps, she should start though. After all, it would be unfortunate if she would become the next victim of these ‘thereabouts’ the second youngest Stoneheart has unwittingly subjected two of the most foul mouthed members of this household to.\n\nPearl pulls out her phone as she opens the fridge and reaches into the ice cube tray, shaking a few of the solidified pieces of water into her palms, then dropping them into her mouth. She bites down, opening the application she utilizes to take notes with the satisfying crunch as pleasant stimulation.\n\n“Objective: Calculate how to best avoid Aventurine’s nightly escapades. Variables needed to generate solutions: Aventurine’s nightly habits, his partner’s nightly habits, vicinity of where said habits take place…” she rambles to herself, deciding to just take the ice cube tray in its entirety and set it down on the kitchen table. Power is needed to fuel the brain when it must operate in its full capacity— and avoiding any possible chicanery is a very necessary endeavor for such.\n\n**\n\nFor such an ‘elite group’, the Stonehearts sure have a very rudimentary way of communicating with each other, don’t they? The onslaught of sticky notes on the fridge from the past few weeks has proven this fact to Topaz. As for the subjects of said sticky notes… judging by the new, light blue one on the fridge, it seems that this persistent problem continues to, well, continue persisting and needing to be addressed.\n\nto Aventurine: I understand that this is an extremely personal matter, but seeing as I do not have your contact info, I will follow suit with this method. I have also become an unintentional witness, of sorts, to that visitor of yours. However, though I may be mistaken, I think you had shared… a more tender moment that I had overheard. Him wishing to stay a bit longer with you. For that I apologize, but also believe this serves as more proof you should make a more clandestine arrangement. from: Pearl\n\nAt the very least, Pearl doesn’t start off with slut shaming Aventurine, a refreshing breath of fresh air compared to… Sugilite and Obsidian. In all fairness, they’ve never been known to mince their words- or has anyone in this apartment, really. It’s just that to Aventurine, specifically, they’re particularly harsh. It feels like they’re always picking a fight with him to simply pick a fight, and then Topaz has to watch Aventurine’s ironclad defenses shield every single remark with a “they can fuck off” or “I don’t care” before asking her for her share of the math homework.\n\nBut, if it’s gotten to the point where even Pearl is complaining…\n\nSome of Aventurine’s luck must be rubbing onto Topaz, because somehow, she has not been struck with the misfortune of overhearing any… bedroom activities he’s been up to as of late. If anything, he’s kicked his bad habit of crudely mentioning his recent ‘conquests’ to Topaz (without her asking, mind you!) and has been acting a lot less… insufferable lately, in all honesty.\n\nCould he seriously have done some self improvement while she wasn’t looking? That scheming, loud mouthed, shameless Aventurine?\n\nUgh! How could she have been so blind to that, if so! And… and she most likely knows the culprit behind it too!\n\nNumby, her miniature pig, seems to sense her distress, nipping at her ankle. With a sigh, Topaz opens the fridge, grabs a bag of chocolate coins, then unceremoniously drops down onto a kitchen chair. A single waggle of her finger later, Numby is at her heels and eating unwrapped chocolate coins held out to it on her palm.\n\n“Keeping a secret like that from me? Ah, the nerve of those two!” Topaz huffs, holding a chocolate coin to her lips before taking an angry bite.\n\nYet, can she really be mad when it’s a boon in the long run? Who knew that Aventurine’s tutor could make him turn over a new leaf- even if it’s… unconventionally, and perhaps expectedly, somehow intertwined with his sexual antics. It’s about the end, not the means, right?\n\nStill— this much explains why she feels even more like a third wheel to those two than usual! Can’t Ratio even have the decency to hide those yearning eyes in front of her? And, besides, why are they yearning in the first place? If what Pearl says is true, then they’ve gotten further past that right? Something intimate and ‘true’…\n\nTopaz blinks.\n\nShe so has to grill him over this! A boyfriend is a very serious thing to keep away from her, and Aventurine owes her that much! They’ll have some serious debriefing, and she’ll hear their love story, starting from day one!\n\n“What’s the worst that could happen, right, Numby?” She coos, leaning down to pick up the mini pig, placing it on her lap. Numby oinks affirmatively, and that’s all the encouragement she needs.\n\n**\n\nAs the person who is the reason Aventurine was endorsed into the Stonehearts in the first place, Jade has thus been vested with the responsibility of keeping a close eye on him. Call it motherly, call it business as usual, but no matter what one labels their relationship…\n\nMadam Jade is almost required to be nosy about his business. And his recent concealed gloominess isn’t fooling her anytime soon. Especially not with these newest texts from little Jelena, which she is reading as they are currently sharing a lunch break together at a cafe.\n\nMm, well, what he doesn’t know won’t hurt him.\n\nJade takes a peek at Aventurine over the case of her phone, watching him stab at the stack of French toast he bought with a melancholic expression. She places her phone screen down, leaning forward on the table. She taps her nails against the surface.\n\n“So,” she starts, and she already sees his composure wane at that simple word. Perfect. That makes this easier than it usually is to pry things out of Aventurine.\n\n(And who taught him how to have such high walls? Himself, actually, but Jade reinforced it somewhat.)\n\n“Something on your mind, child? Or rather…”\n\nHe groans prematurely, rubbing his temples. Those lovely eyes of his squeeze shut as he purses his lips.\n\n“Please don’t say it, Madam.”\n\n“As I thought. It's someone on your mind.”\n\nAventurine takes a sip of his coffee, not meeting her eyes. In fact, he looks everywhere but her eyes. At the ceiling, at the table, at the floor- and she has an inkling he only dares not check on his phone because of the sheer intimidation factor of Jade’s presence.\n\nGood, good. He knows his manners.\n\nShe stirs her iced tea, regarding him fondly.\n\n“Did you have a fight? Something that you couldn’t smooth over?” She digs, and like most times, she hits the nail right on the head- evident in the way Aventurine sags further into his seat, fork falling limply out of his hands and clanking against his plate.\n\n“… It was bad, yeah,” he mumbles, barely expanding. That, too, is the usual Aventurine. Such a sullen child like this.\n\nThankfully for him, Jade knows all these little habits, and of course, the best way to address them is a gentle nudge.\n\n“Too bad for you to reconcile over it?”\n\nHe stiffens, and stares at his coffee like it’ll answer this prospect for him.\n\n“I’m… he wouldn’t give me the time of day, after what happened.”\n\n“Have you tested that for yourself, child? What’s one more grand gamble, hm?”\n\nThat seems to prompt an action, as Aventurine’s fist comes to slam down onto the table, making his eyes widen a split second after he realizes just what he did. He quickly redraws it, shaking his head all the while.\n\n“I- he’s not something I can just gamble with. I… he said I already treated him frivolously before, so… so I can’t do that.”\n\nWith a calm smile upon her lips, Jade raises her glass and takes a sip.\n\n“Then, all the more reason for you to give it your all and speak to him. And if you are scared— merely fuel yourself with that, alright?” She hums, reaching out to ruffle his hair, his head hung low.\n\nAfter a moment, he nods, and gets up from the table.\n\n“Okay,” Aventurine says, quietly, but full of resolve. He throws down a fifty dollar bill onto the table (far too much, but it’s the thought that counts), bows, then leaves the cafe.\n\nWith a triumphant laugh, Jade wishes only the best for him as she leans back in her chair.\n\nShe’d like to meet the one who caught his eye soon, after all.\n\n**\n\nAventurine sighs as he shuts off his phone, reading his email for the second time in the past hour. He’s already in the parking lot, so why is he so nervous now?\n\n“You’re thinking too hard, Kakavasha. Don’t you always say that’s my job?”\n\nAh. Right. Because he’s with him.\n\nHe turns in the passenger seat to face Ratio, his… extended/elongated fuck buddy turned… boyfriend (after some mishaps), who he’d been living with for the recent weeks. He’s distinguished, dressed formally, but not too formal, for this ‘event’.\n\nReally, they’re all just being nosy as hell, but it’s always west when he tries.\n\n“Sorry, sorry, Ratio~ I’m just nervous you’ll be clinging onto me the entire time,” Aventurine teases, leaning over the console to press his head against Ratio’s shoulder. Much to his surprise, Ratio huffs and takes his hand, squeezing it tightly.\n\n“Then they will simply have to deal with that,” he responds succinctly, like it’s a done deal, like that isn’t terribly embarrassing for a man of his ranking. To cling onto Aventurine, who pushed him away over and over again, insisted they were nothing more than ‘two warm bodies who fit well’, who said only his body made his personality was worth it-\n\nSoft lips pressed over his own knock him out of his thoughts, filling him up with a pleasant warmth. Ratio pulls away slowly, rubbing the back of his nape soothingly.\n\n“Kakavasha, are you with me?” He murmurs, eyes knitting together in concern. Aventurine manages to nod, his own hands coming to rest on Ratio’s waist.\n\n“Mhm.”\n\n“That’s good. Now, we should- no, you are not feeling up my shirt before we see your roommates.”\n\n“Booooo.”\n\nWith a roll of his eyes, Ratio grabs Aventurine’s sneaky wrist, and places it back onto the console. With a wiggle of his eyebrows, Aventurine smirks and pokes his cheek.\n\n“How about after, then?”\n\nRatio seems to give it genuine thought as he checks himself in the mirror one last time, before giving an affirmative nod.\n\n“If you’re good, perhaps.”\n\nGod, he loves this man.\n\n(They enter the restaurant hand in hand, quickly getting escorted to the table where the other Stonehearts are waiting, eagerness evident in their scouring eyes.\n\nTopaz speaks up first-\n\n“Well, give us the introduction, Aventurine!”\n\nAnd, Aventurine starts to think, all those sticky notes full of gripes, those fights, those misunderstandings, those tender moments only between the two of them,\n\nThey were worth it, just to see the way Ratio’s face lights up as Aventurine officially calls him his boyfriend, his hand squeezed so tight it hurts.)"
