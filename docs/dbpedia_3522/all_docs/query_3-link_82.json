        "text": "No, you’re not seeing double: Blake Lively and Isabela Ferrer just look that much alike.\n\nIt’s a fact that was only made the more noticeable when Isabela—who plays the younger version of Blake’s Lily Bloom in their new film It Ends With Us—stepped out onto the red carpet at the movie’s August 6 premiere looking much like Blake herself.\n\n“She did style me, this is all her doing,” Isabela confessed in an exclusive interview with E! News aired Aug. 6. “I have an Oscar De La Renta dress on in classic Blake fashion. I’m wearing her shoes, these are her Louboutin shoes.”\n\nFor the occasion, Isabela—per Blake's guidance—donned a gorgeous, flowered gown that matched the floral arrangements, courtesy of UrbanStems, that decorated the carpet.\n\nAnd for the 24-year-old, for whom It Ends With Us is her first big-screen acting role, Blake has been far more than just a stylist.\n\n“She’s been an absolute angel,” Isabela added. “A mentor and a big sister to me. And a new best friend. I don’t know where I’d be without her.”\n\nIt was a casting choice that really did feel like kismet. After all, not only did the two women mesh personally, but to an outside perspective, their similarities are almost uncanny. Even down to their voices."
