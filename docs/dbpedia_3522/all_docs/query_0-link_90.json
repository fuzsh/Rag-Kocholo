        "text": "BORN RICH DOCUMENTARY EXTRA CREDIT ASSIGNMENT\n\nDecember 09, 2022\n\nFor this paper, I watched the Born Rich Documentary on YouTube which is all about wealthy young people who inherited or are going to inherit a consequent financial amount or an empire from their parents. In this documentary, they talk about the challenges they faced growing up as a rich kid, how this affected their lives in various ways and how they respond to it.\n\nSocial stratification is a socioeconomic system that divides society’s members into categories ranging from high to low, based on things like wealth, power, and prestige. This is seen at the very beginning of the documentary when the servers are asked to treat the Johnson and Johnson family members differently in fact, they are asked to treat everybody as a member of the Johnson and Johnson family. This is to avoid offending any of the Johnson and Johnson family members. Also, this shows how wealthy and powerful the Johnson and Johnson family is compared to other families and their wealth and power.\n\nSocial mobility is the ability to change positions within a social stratification system. In the documentary, we learn about different families’ stories, and some of them were not always rich. Their grandparents or great-grandparents had to move their way up the social ladder. This is seen as the Johnson and Johnson brothers, who started low created their own company and quickly became one of the richest in America and moved to the upper class. This is known as intragenerational mobility, which is defined as the changes in a person's social mobility over the course of their lifetime. This helped the generations after that not to be born into the lower class but the upper class. This is known as intergenerational mobility, which is defined as a difference in social class between different generations of a family\n\nMeritocracy is an ideal system in which personal effort or merit determines social standing. In this documentary, meritocracy is questioned because these young men and women did not work for what they have or will inherit. Their parents, grandparents, or great-\n\nIdeology is the cultural belief system that justifies a society’s system of stratification. The system is a capitalist system which implies that the more money you make the more power and prestige you have and the higher your class.\n\nThe Davis-Moore thesis argued that the greater the functional importance of a social role, the greater must be the reward. For example, S IV Newhouse's parents are at the head of a label that contains big magazines such as Vogue, Vanity fair, Glamor, House and Garden, Bonne Appetit, etc., which provides entertainment for millions of people and employs millions of people. These need to be managed conveniently for it to prosper and hence comes with a greater reward. This family has been wealthy since their great grandparent hence stratification persists over generations.\n\nIn conclusion, doing this paper, I little more about growing up wealthy and the difficulties wealthy kids can phase such as parents' lack of involvement in their education, a lot of responsibilities at a young age, and the judgment of others. Being born rich comes with a fair load of challenges."
