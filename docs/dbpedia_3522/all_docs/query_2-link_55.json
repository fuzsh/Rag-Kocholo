        "text": "In his introduction to “The Age of Movies,” the Library of America anthology canonizing Pauline Kael, Sanford Schwartz writes that she was “undoubtedly the most fervently read American critic of any art” during her two-­decade tenure at The New Yorker. That’s not hyperbole. Such was the power of Kael’s voluminous writing about movies that she transformed the sensibility and standards of mainstream pop culture criticism in America — mostly for the better, despite her bullying personality (in print and in life), her sloppy professional ethics and her at times careerist escapades in self-dramatizing contrarianism. She had a lot to write about. Her prime years as a critic happily coincided with sequential renaissances in foreign cinema (the 1960s) and American movies (the 1970s). Week after week, she whipped up torrents of copy that could make causes célèbres out of even the most ephemeral Hollywood fluff. She upended journalistic criticism the way contemporaneous New Journalists like Tom Wolfe and Hunter Thompson revolutionized reportage. Her essays, fiercely present in the moment and epic in length, buttonholed readers so they’d feel as if they were sitting next to her in the dark, seeing every­thing she saw. She fired up her exultantly vernacular American prose as if she were writing high-octane fiction, not passing judgment on “Cabaret.”\n\nIt’s also true, as Schwartz writes, that Kael’s retirement, in 1991 at age 71, was a national news story. But her death, at 82 in 2001, was not. The culture of the new century was rapidly moving on. Now yet another decade has passed, and Kael may be little read outside of cineaste circles and film-studies academia (a milieu she detested). Most of her books are out of print. Ask moviegoers under 40 who she is, and you may draw a blank. Then again, what serious film critics of any era, including our own, are household names these days? We no longer live in the age of movies, and ambitious professional arts criticism is an increasingly arcane calling in a digital world where the old maxim, everyone’s a critic, is literally true. While much of Kael may be out of print, today it’s an anomaly when the output of any critic is collected in a book in the first place (let alone Kael’s 11 anthologies of full-length reviews). Few movies can muscle their way onto center stage in our reality-TV-saturated media universe. The individualistic filmmaking that sustained Kael and her peers now must fight to find financing or theatrical distribution outside New York. Even the once unassailable Oscars are suffering an identity crisis and struggling to hold on to their annual ­spotlight.\n\nIt’s hard to believe there was a time, not that long ago, when movie zealots would race to the newsstand on the days The New Yorker and The Village Voice were hot off the press to see Kael square off against her principal critical antagonist, the essential Andrew Sarris, on whatever was new in theaters that week. Though there are still some fine film critics at work, few readers wait for their verdicts on the new Almodóvar or Scor­sese the way so many once waited for Kael’s. Print movie critics declined in influence with the rise of Siskel and ­Ebert’s thumbs up-thumbs down appraisals on television. Now film criticism on television has largely vanished, too, succeeded by depersonalized aggregation sites like ­Rotten Tomatoes. The double-entendre book titles Kael chose to convey the orgiastic passions informing her criticism — “I Lost It at the Movies,” “Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,” et al. — seem as distant and overheated as the title cards in silent melodramas. Today’s mass audience is more likely to watch movies (or, more often, time-shifted television) on a digital screen at home or on an iPad than in the sensuous dark of a movie house.\n\nSome newcomers to Kael may not know what to make of “The Age of Movies.” Her style has been imitated by so many for so long that the excitement the ur-texts generated may not be instantly accessible. More than a few of the movies sparking her enthusiasm have faded into obscurity. (“The Last American Hero” is apparently M.I.A. even on Netflix.) So have some of the once-sacred cows she slaughtered, like Michelangelo Antonioni’s “Blow-Up.” To appreciate Kael’s trailblazing, you have to see it in its broader context. Luckily, that backdrop is filled in with sure-footed sophistication by Brian Kellow in “Pauline Kael: A Life in the Dark,” a fair-minded and deeply reported Kael biography being published simultaneously with the artfully winnowed Library of America sampling of her work. The books should be read side by side."
