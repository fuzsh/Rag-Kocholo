        "text": "When playwright Robert Harling wrote Steel Magnolias back in 1987—his poignant tribute to his sister’s journey to motherhood and eventual death from diabetes complications—he undoubtedly had no idea that decades later, people would still be quoting it regularly.\n\nHarling’s witty play had a successful off-Broadway run. Then TriStar Pictures bought the movie rights and Harling edited the script, transforming the play into a movie. The 1989 film had an all-star cast that included Sally Field, Dolly Parton, Shirley MacLaine, Daryl Hannah, Olympia Dukakis, and Julia Roberts.\n\nSince then, the Steel Magnolias play had a four-month run on Broadway in 2005, and the movie was remade by Lifetime in 2012, this time starring Queen Latifah.\n\nBut Harling’s clever words like \"I'm not crazy ... I've just been in a very bad mood for 40 years\" and \"If you can't say anything nice about anybody, come sit by me\" have become fodder for jokes with family around the table or friends in the salon. More so, the 1989 film’s powerful portrait of family, hope, loss, grief, and happiness, and strong Southern friendships has become a smash hit that has lasted through the ages. The film is a Southern staple with something for everyone who loves to laugh, cry, or eat armadillo cake. Here are 17 things you might not know about Steel Magnolias.\n\nSteel Magnolias Was Based On A True Story\n\nActor and writer Robert Harling wrote the play based on the true story of his sister, Susan Harling Robinson, who died from complications with diabetes. \"She was the only person that had been with me for forever,\" Harling told Southern Living. \"When we lost her, when she died in 1985, I was really in a very bad state with her loss.\" He began writing the play after learning his brother-in-law remarried months after his sister's death.\n\nThe Movie Offered Healing For Harling's Family\n\nHarling wanted his mother to leave the set when they filmed Julia Roberts' death scene, but his mother insisted on staying so she could see Julia get up and walk away after the director yelled cut. \"I said, 'I can't believe you put yourself through that,'\" Harling recalled saying to his mother in an interview with the Huffington Post. \"But Julia had become so special to my parents. She took some peace with that.\"\n\nThe Film Featured Real People\n\nThe nurses and other hospital staff seen in Julia Roberts' life-support scenes were actual medical professionals who tended to Harling's sister in her final days. Harling himself played the minister who presided over Shelby's wedding and funeral.\n\nIt Took 10 Days To Write\n\n\"The events that inspired it were so powerful that, after I found the story arena, it just poured out into my typewriter in a 24/7 tsunami of Southernness,\" Harling told Garden & Gun about the speedy writing process. \"I had no idea what I'd written. I asked the first person I gave it to if it even looked like a play. I wasn't really sure. All I knew was that I felt it portrayed my sister's life and spirit accurately, and that was enough for me.\"\n\nIt Was Originally A Short Story\n\nHarling originally wanted to turn his sister's life into a short story, but it quickly turned into a play because he wanted its Southernness to come out. \"I was an actor, so I thought, well, I know what a script looks like, and I know what dialogue looks like,\" Harling told Southern Living. \"I'm just gonna try to write this as a play. So, I did.\"\n\nHarling's Sister Inspired More Than Just Shelby\n\nWhen Harling hit a patch of writer's block while working on the play, he channeled his sister for one of its most famous scenes. \"I said, 'What would Susan do?' And what Susan would do would be outrageous,\" he told Today. \"She would do something completely inappropriate and totally out of the box.\" The result is that at Shelby's funeral, when her mother M'Lynn is understandably distraught, Clairee cheekily suggests that M'Lynn take out her grief by hitting Ouiser. \"Here, hit this!\" Clairee says in one of the film's memorable moments.\n\nOther Actresses Were Considered To Play Shelby\n\nOriginally, Winona Ryder was considered for the part of Shelby, but producers decided she was too young. Instead, they settled on Meg Ryan, who committed to the role before dropping out for a little film called When Harry Met Sally. That's when Julia Roberts stepped in.\n\n\"We brought her in, and she was Julia Roberts, so she was magic. She just walked into the room and lit it up, and I thought, that's my sister,\" Harling told Southern Living. (Coincidentally, Roberts later passed on the lead for You've Got Mail, which went to Ryan, Roberts told Andy Cohen in 2023.)\n\nAnother fun fact about the role of Shelby? When Nicole Kidman was starting out as an actress in Australia, one of her earliest roles was Shelby in the stage version of Steel Magnolias.\n\nHollywood Royalty Wanted In\n\nElizabeth Taylor went to see Steel Magnolias during its off-Broadway run, and thanks to her rave review, Hollywood legend Bette Davis called up Harling and started a push to be cast in the film as Ouiser. She also thought that Katharine Hepburn could make a fantastic Clairee and Elizabeth Taylor would be perfect as M'Lynn. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Harling said that Davis even invited him to tea to convince him that she was right for the role. The role, of course, went to Shirley MacLaine.\n\nHarling Wrote Truvy For Another Actress\n\nWhile Dolly Parton was perfect in the role of beauty shop owner Truvy, the part was actually written for someone else entirely—Margo Martindale. Harling and Martindale were friends in real life, and he wrote the role for her to play. She originated the role of Truvy in the play's off-Broadway debut.\n\nIt Was Filmed In The Author's Hometown\n\nPlaywright Robert Harling grew up in Natchitoches, Louisiana, and insisted on filming there. His decision had a huge impact on the town, which can still be felt today. \"For everyone who has seen the movie outside of Natchitoches, it is synonymous with the movie,\" Natchitoches Convention and Tourism Bureau former Executive Director Arlene Gould told The Shreveport Times. \"It had a tremendous impact on the tourism trade and on our community.\" You can even take a self-guided tour of the filming locations.\n\nSteel Magnolias Led To Soapdish\n\nAfter long days on set in Natchitoches, Louisiana, the cast would gather together to play games and chat. One night, according to the Huffington Post, Harling asked each actress to name the role she'd most like to play. Sally Field said she always played \"really noble, earnest women that wear crummy clothes. For once I'd like to play a b---h that gets to wear nice clothes.\" Harling loved the idea and started to think about a seeming sweetheart who was truly devilish. Soon after, Soapdish was born, and Field got to play the role of her dreams as an aging soap opera star who plots to ruin her co-star's career in the 1991 film.\n\nThere Was A Steel Magnolias TV Show\n\nCBS aired a pilot episode of a Steel Magnolias TV series in August 1990, but the show never made it to a full series. Perhaps CBS should try again, though. When Lifetime created its 2012 version of the film, starring Queen Latifah, Phylicia Rashad, and Condola Rashad, it was the channel's third-most-watched telecast ever.\n\nThe Film Sparked A Real-Life Romance\n\nThe sparks you saw between Roberts and her on-screen beau, Dylan McDermott, were real. When filming began on Steel Magnolias, Roberts was dating actor Liam Neeson, her co-star in 1988's Satisfaction. Then, she allegedly broke up with Neeson to date—and eventually become engaged to—McDermott. They never made it to the altar, though. Their relationship ended in 1990.\n\nVisitors Can Stay At The Steel Magnolia House\n\nThe historic Natchitoches house where Steel Magnolias was filmed is now a bed-and-breakfast and has been renamed The Steel Magnolia House. Guests can stay in rooms named after characters like Clairee, Ouiser, and Annelle.\n\nThe Christmas Scenes Were Filmed In August\n\nSouthern summers can be scorchers, but that didn't stop the cast and extras from donning their finest Christmas sweaters and winter hats to film the Natchitoches Christmas festival scenes. It might have been 100 degrees during filming, but it sure looked like December, thanks to the magic of the movies.\n\nThe Movie Has Inspired Others To Donate\n\nHarling told Today that a fan reached out to tell him that watching the film inspired them to donate a kidney to a neighbor in need. While Oscar nominations and Tony Awards are undoubtedly exciting, inspiring someone to save a life sounds like a truly incredible reward for a playwright.\n\nShirley MacLaine Knew The Movie Was Special\n\nIt was while filming one of those blazing hot Christmas festival scenes that Shirley MacLaine turned to playwright Robert Harling and told him she thought the film was important.\n\n“I think it revealed all the intricacies and the diversity of women's friendships,\" MacLaine later told Southern Living, reflecting on the movie's long-lasting legacy during its 25th anniversary.\n\n\"And we experienced that on the set. We made very good friends that are still there for us,\" she said. \"I think that, especially now, I think it's still resonating because we know we find comfort in each other and we can be honest and we can be cruel, and we can be funny. And we can be sarcastic and also know that we’re there for each other always. So I think that’s something we long for in this culture.”"
