        "text": "Dear Luke,\n\nI am sorry that your ability to move forward with tidying up the legal aspects of the end of your relationship is being frustrated by your former partner refusing to engage with you and your solicitor, and in effect ghosting you.\n\nFor readers not familiar with the phrase “ghosting”, it describes the social situation where a person suddenly and without explanation withdraws all communication.\n\nIn your case, ghosting goes beyond the social aspect because in law you may not have been married or in a civil partnership, but you have legal ties through your joint ownership of land.\n\nThose ties are binding unless you agree together to remove them in a decided way, or a court makes a formal order as to how the land you own may be disposed of.\n\nAs such, I urge you to redouble your efforts to locate your former partner because your best option is to have him involved in the process. Courts are always very reluctant to make decisions about a person without them present and, if forced to, any decision will be limited by the court’s interpretation of the powers at their disposal, which means you may not get the outcome you are hoping for.\n\nAt the same time, they will be seeking to ensure fairness between the parties. All of which will be time-consuming and expensive.\n\nOn a practical level, investing time now to track down your ex through clues on social media, employers, work colleagues, mutual friends or even an enquiry agent (private detective) would be time well spent to avoid going down the purely legal route.\n\nHowever, if required, the purely legal route will be to invoke the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 (TOLATA).\n\nIn law, you and your former partner hold the house you bought together on a 50:50 basis. The usual rule is that disposal of any interest in the land is ideally decided by the trustees (you and your former partner) by mutual consent.\n\nBut where there is no consent, you can ask the court to intervene. However, how the court can intervene is constrained by the law and may not grant you exactly what you wish in a direct way.\n\nThe undoubted complication here is your former partner being “in absentia”. In your witness statement to support a claim form, you will have to demonstrate to the court that as far as you are aware he is alive and go through all the efforts you have made to locate him and contact him.\n\nSomehow you will need to demonstrate he has been put on notice of the court case, which may not be straightforward if you do not know where he is. Hence the ultimate default I mention of using an enquiry agent to find his place of work or home where papers can be “served” (delivered) on him.\n\nHowever, there is still a risk the court will refuse to proceed without him being there, or it may direct further efforts to bring him into a process or discussions where his share in the house can be dealt with. All of which means costs will accrue.\n\nIt may be reasonable for you to ask him to pay these costs out of his share of the house, but costs are awarded at the discretion of the judge and are not guaranteed.\n\nSince TOLATA was introduced in 1996, various cases heard by the courts have considered the actual power of the court to deal with the disposal of shares in land and order the sale of land. Here you want the court to order that the 50pc share of the house owned by your former partner be transferred to you.\n\nPresumably, you have a figure in mind based on the value of the house. Clearly, you will require expert evidence about that figure to produce to the court and show it is fair and equitable.\n\nThat said, under TOLATA whilst a court may agree to an order for your house to be sold, it is a slightly different thing for you to ask for it to be transferred into your name, even if (as here) you are asking for a fair price to be paid to the absent co-owner.\n\nIt may be a stretch too far for the court to remove your former partner as owner. And as I say, it may be more likely for the court to say its power is limited to simply declaring the house should be sold. I say this having reviewed the relevant case law.\n\nThe practical outcome may still be you becoming the sole owner. Whatever the process of that happening, you should also be aware of stamp duty implications in terms of you buying out the other half of the house.\n\nAnd you will need to have a plan for the court to agree on where your former partner’s money will be paid to. If he is absent there is a process for it to be paid into court.\n\nAll in all, it will be a long and expensive journey. So, setting all this out in writing to your ex (if you have an email or postal address or even WhatsApp details for him) and telling him you will be seeking your costs against him, may persuade him to stop ghosting you and address these very significant issues in the real world.\n\nAsk a Lawyer should not be taken as formal legal advice, but rather as a starting point for readers to undertake their own further research."
