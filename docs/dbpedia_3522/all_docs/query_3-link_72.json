Have an account? .\n\nElizabeth Holmes dropped out of Stanford at 19 to start the blood-testing startup Theranos.\n\nTheranos' value grew to $9 billion until flaws in the technology were exposed and Holmes was charged with fraud.\n\nHere's how Holmes went from precocious child, to ambitious Stanford dropout, to an embattled startup founder now in prison.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Holmes was born on February 3, 1984 in Washington, DC. Her mom, Noel, was a Congressional committee staffer, and her dad, Christian Holmes, worked for Enron before moving to government agencies like USAID.\n\nSource: Elizabeth Holmes/Twitter, CNN, Vanity Fair\n\nHolmes' family moved when she was young, from Washington, DC to Houston.\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhen she was 7, Holmes tried to invent her own time machine, filling up an entire notebook with detailed engineering drawings. At the age of 9, Holmes told relatives she wanted to be a billionaire when she grew up. Her relatives described her as saying it with the \"utmost seriousness and determination.\"\n\nSource: CBS News, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nHolmes had an \"intense competitive streak\" from a young age. She often played Monopoly with her younger brother and cousin, and she would insist on playing until the end, collecting the houses and hotels until she won. If Holmes was losing, she would often storm off. More than once, she ran directly through a screen on the door.\n\nSource: Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was during high school that Holmes developed her work ethic, often staying up late to study. She quickly became a straight-A student, and even started her own business: she sold C++ compilers, a type of software that translates computer code, to Chinese schools.\n\nSource: Fortune, Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nHolmes started taking Mandarin lessons and part-way through high school, talked her way into being accepted by Stanford University’s summer program, which culminated in a trip to Beijing.\n\nSource: Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspired by her great-great-grandfather Christian Holmes, a surgeon, Holmes decided she wanted to go into medicine. But she discovered early on that she was terrified of needles. Later, she said this influenced her to start Theranos.\n\nSource: San Francisco Business Times\n\nHolmes went to Stanford to study chemical engineering. When she was a freshman, she became a \"president's scholar,\" an honor that came with a $3,000 stipend to go toward a research project.\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes spent the summer after her freshman year interning at the Genome Institute in Singapore. She got the job partly because she spoke Mandarin.\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nAs a sophomore, Holmes went to one of her professors, Channing Robertson, and said: \"Let's start a company.\" With his blessing, she founded Real-Time Cures, later changing the company's name to Theranos. Thanks to a typo, early employees’ paychecks actually said \"Real-Time Curses.\"\n\nSource: Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes soon filed a patent application for a \"medical device for analyte monitoring and drug delivery,\" a wearable device that would administer medication, monitor patients' blood, and adjust the dosage as needed.\n\nSource: Fortune, US Patent Office\n\nBy the next semester, Holmes had dropped out of Stanford altogether and was working on Theranos in the basement of a college house.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTheranos's business model was based around the idea that it could run blood tests, using proprietary technology that required only a finger pinprick and a small amount of blood. Holmes said the tests would be able to detect medical conditions like cancer and high cholesterol.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nHolmes started raising money for Theranos from prominent investors like Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tim Draper, the father of a childhood friend and the founder of prominent VC firm Draper Fisher Jurvetson. Theranos raised more than $700 million, and Draper has continued to defend Holmes.\n\nSource: SEC, Crunchbase\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes took investors' money on the condition that she wouldn't have to reveal how Theranos' technology worked. Plus, she would have the final say over everything having to do with the company.\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nThat obsession with secrecy extended to every aspect of Theranos. For the first decade Holmes spent building her company, Theranos operated in stealth mode. She even took three former Theranos employees to court, claiming they had misused Theranos trade secrets.\n\nSource: San Francisco Business Times\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes' attitude toward secrecy and running a company was borrowed from a Silicon Valley hero of hers: former Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Holmes started dressing in black turtlenecks like Jobs, decorated her office with his favorite furniture, and like Jobs, never took vacations.\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nEven Holmes's uncharacteristically deep voice may have been part of a carefully crafted image intended to help her fit in in the male-dominated business world. In ABC's podcast on Holmes called \"The Dropout,\" former Theranos employees said the CEO sometimes \"fell out of character,\" particularly after drinking, and would speak in a higher voice.\n\nSource: Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup, The Cut\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes was a demanding boss and wanted her employees to work as hard as she did. She had her assistants track when employees arrived and left each day. To encourage people to work longer hours, she started having dinner catered to the office around 8 p.m. each night.\n\nSource: Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShortly after Holmes dropped out of Stanford at age 19, she began dating Theranos president and COO Sunny Balwani, who was 20 years her senior. The two met during Holmes' third year in Stanford’s summer Mandarin program, the summer before she went to college.

She asked anyone who visited the company’s headquarters to sign non-disclosure agreements before being allowed in the building and had security guards escort visitors everywhere — even to the bathroom.\n\nHolmes hired bodyguards to drive her around in a black Audi sedan. Her nickname was \"Eagle One.\" The windows in her office had bulletproof glass.\n\nSource: Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAround the same time, questions were being raised about Theranos' technology.

Outside scientists began voicing their concerns about Theranos, too.\n\nSource: Vanity Fair, Business Insider\n\nBy August 2015, the FDA began investigating Theranos, and regulators from the government body that oversees laboratories found \"major inaccuracies\" in the testing Theranos was doing on patients.\n\nSource: Vanity Fair\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy October 2015, Wall Street Journal reporter John Carreyrou published his investigation into Theranos's struggles with its technology. Carreyrou's reporting sparked the beginning of the company's downward spiral.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nCarreyrou found that Theranos' blood-testing machine, named Edison, couldn't give accurate results, so Theranos was running its samples through the same machines used by traditional blood-testing companies.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes appeared on CNBC's \"Mad Money\" shortly after the WSJ published its story to defend herself and Theranos. \"This is what happens when you work to change things, and first they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world,\" Holmes said.\n\nSource: CNBC\n\nBy 2016, the FDA, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and SEC were all looking into Theranos.\n\nSource: Wall Street Journal, Wired\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn July 2016, Holmes was banned from the lab-testing industry for two years. By October, Theranos had shut down its lab operations and wellness centers.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nIn March 2018, Theranos, Holmes, and Balwani were charged with \"massive fraud\" by the SEC. Holmes agreed to give up financial and voting control of the company, pay a $500,000 fine, and return 18.9 million shares of Theranos stock. She also isn't allowed to be the director or officer of a publicly traded company for 10 years.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the charges, Holmes was allowed to stay on as CEO of Theranos, since it's a private company. The company had been hanging on by a thread, and Holmes wrote to investors asking for more money to save Theranos. \"In light of where we are, this is no easy ask,\" Holmes wrote.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nIn Theranos' final days, Holmes reportedly got a Siberian husky puppy named Balto that she brought into the office.

She said she did this because company counsel told her that alterations the company made to the machines were trade secrets and needed to be protected as such.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes spent seven days on the stand before the defense rested its case in early December.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nIn closing arguments, prosecutors argued that Holmes \"chose fraud over business failure\" while the defense argued she was \"building a business, not a criminal enterprise.\"\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter 15 weeks of trial, Holmes' case headed to a jury of eight men and four women on December 17, 2021.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nJurors deliberated for a total of seven days over the next few weeks before telling the court on January 3, 2022, that they were deadlocked on three of the 11 charges against Holmes. The judge read off some jury instructions to the group in court before instructing them to go back and deliberate further.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHours later, the jury returned a mixed verdict for Holmes, finding her guilty on one count of conspiracy to defraud investors and three counts of wire fraud. They found her not guilty on four other counts and failed to reach a verdict on the remaining three counts.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nThe counts Holmes was found guilty of were all related to investments; she wasn't convicted on any of the charges involving patients who received inaccurate test results.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes faced the possibility of decades in prison.

According to an account of the incident from Billy Evans, Holmes' partner, Rosendorff showed up at their home looking \"disheveled\" and said he felt \"guilty.\"\n\n\"He said when he was called as a witness he tried to answer the questions honestly but that the prosecutors tried to make everybody look bad (in the company),\" Evans recalled in an email to Holmes' attorneys about their interaction. \"He said that the government made things sound worse than they were when he was up on the stand during his testimony. He said he felt like he had done something wrong. And that this was weighing on him, He said he was having trouble sleeping.\"\n\nIn another of Holmes' motions for a new trial, she says the prosecution portrayed her relationship with Balwani differently in their respective trials, to her detriment.\n\nIn the final motion, Holmes said she was denied emails showing prosecutors failed to take appropriate steps to preserve a Theranos database that she claims would have helped her defense, even though the government furnished these materials when Balwani was on trial.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHolmes notched a small victory when the presiding judge ordered an evidentiary hearing regarding Rosendorff's testimony and appearance at her home. This hearing meant that Holmes' sentencing was postponed from October 17, 2022, to November 18 of that year.\n\nSource: Business Insider\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe evidentiary hearing proved useless to Holmes, though, as witness Rosendorff said he stood by his initial testimony and only went to her home because he was \"distressed\" at the idea of Holmes' child growing up without a mother.\n\n\"At all times the government encouraged me to tell the truth and only the truth,\" Rosendorff clarified at the hearing.\n\n\"I don't want to help Ms. Holmes,\" Rosendorff added. \"The only person that can help her is herself. She needs to pay her debt to society.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn November 8, the presiding judge denied all three of Holmes' motions for a new trial, paving the way for sentencing.\n\nDays before her sentencing, Holmes' attorneys asked that she get no more than 18 months, preferably under house arrest. They submitted 130 letters from friends and family — spanning everyone from Senator Cory Booker to even an ex-CDC chief — pleading for leniency.\n\nIn the end, Holmes' friends and family didn't get their wish. On November 18, 2022, Holmes was sentenced to 135 months, or 11.25 years, in prison with three years of supervised release beginning on April 27. \"I stand before you taking responsibility for Theranos.
