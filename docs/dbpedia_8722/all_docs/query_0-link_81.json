        "text": "Cinematographer Bert Glennon comes up with a number of impressive artistic compositions, although the film's biggest treat is seeing Ben Johnson given the opportunity to show off his sly charm and easygoing demeanor.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/4 | Aug 31, 2019\n\nThis may be the closest Ford ever got to making a musical.\n\nFull Review | Apr 3, 2012\n\nFord considered it among his personal favorites, and a handful of Ford's biggest admirers consider it a neglected masterpiece. (I do too.)\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/4 | Apr 3, 2012\n\nIt's as gentle and warm a film as [John Ford] ever made and it follows a classic Ford theme: the creation of a community in the west...\n\nFull Review | Sep 21, 2009\n\n...a simple, straightforward film telling a simple, straightforward story, artistic in its design and execution and poetic in its telling.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Sep 20, 2009\n\none of Ford's masterworks, a sublime, crisp, unpretentious western that doesn't wear its mythos on its sleeve\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 5/5 | Jul 13, 2009\n\nIt's one of the most likable of all the Westerns directed by John Ford.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: A | Jun 5, 2007"
