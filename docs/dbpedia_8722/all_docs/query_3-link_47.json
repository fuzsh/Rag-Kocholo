        "meta_description": "copyright 1959; Whitman Publishing Company, Racine, Wisconsin; hardbound; quite good condition with unmarked pages and mild ageing; decorative boards are vivid; slight spine wrinkle. Description -\"Based on the TV series Wagon Train which initially starred veteran movie supporting actor Ward Bond as the wagon master, later replaced upon his death by John McIntire, and Robert Horton as the scout, subsequently replaced by Robert Fuller. An American Western series that ran on NBC 1957-62 and then on ABC 1962-65, the series was inspired by the 1950 film Wagon Master directed by John Ford and starring Ben Johnson, Harry Carey Jr. and Ward Bond. It also harkens back to the early widescreen wagon train epic The Big Trail (1930) starring John Wayne and featuring Bond in his first major screen appearance. The show chronicles the adventures of a wagon train as it makes its way from Missouri to California. There were 284 episodes in 8 seasons: the first aired on September 18, 1957, and the final segment was broadcast on May 2, 1965.",
