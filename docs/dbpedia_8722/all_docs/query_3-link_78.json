        "text": "John Ford, a man who undoubtedly was strongly influenced in infancy by pounding hoofbeats, strong and silent horsemen, both red and white, and every butte and arroyo west of the Mississippi, obviously is not the director to ignore such magnetic attractions. And, \"Wagonmaster,\" his latest excursion into the Old West, which rolled into the Globe on Saturday to the accompaniment of fittingly, nostalgic airs, follows a trail made visually spectacular, dramatic and humorous by an expert. The adventures of this Mormon caravan, seeking green pastures in spite of natural and human obstacles, could have been banal in other hands, but under Ford's leadership it is an exciting trip well worth taking.Mr. Ford, it should be noted, is not deviating greatly from his own time-tested formula. A devotee of rolling stock and a moving story from 'way back, he cleaved to those ideas by having Elder Jonathan Wiggs, a pioneer disciple of Brigham Young, hire Travis and Sandy, a couple of footloose horse traders, to lead his settlers from Crystal City to beyond the San Juan River in the then virginal Utah territory. En route the train picks up a stranded one-wagon medicine show, and a covey of brutish outlaws seeking sanctuary from a pursuing posse.Naturally, the overpoweringly rugged terrain, the menacing killers and a tribe of touchy Navajos are not conducive to a peaceful trek. Each, in turn, nearly wrecks the hopes of the plodding pioneers. The Navajos, who stage a ceremonial dance and see one of the outlaws whipped for attacking one of their women, are left appeased. The outlaws, attempting a last bit of banditry, are mowed down in a climactic pitched battle. Before the promised land is reached, a couple of surging rivers are crossed and a wagon rut is dug across a craggy pass. Despite all these hurdles, romance, which is kept in a decidedly minor key, is permitted to flower, so that at the journey's end the young trail-blazers appear to be altar-bound, too.Ben Johnson, previously seen in \"The Mighty Joe Young,\" is handsome, natural, laconic and sits a horse well in the title role. Harry Carey Jr. is likable as his youthful and easy-going sidekick. As a veteran member of the John Ford acting company, Ward Bond does not fail his boss. His characterization of the train leader, a testy man who is forced to curb his cussing because of his religion, is the film's best portrayal. Charles Kemper contributes a solid delineation as the villainous outlaw chieftain, whose shotgun-toting \"boys\" seem to have journeyed to Utah all the way from the Ozarks. Russell Simpson, Jane Darwell and Joanne Dru are competent as a horn-blowing \"sister,\" elder and Ben Johnson's romantic vis-a-vis, respectively.Frank Nugent, a member of Mr. Ford's writing varsity, and Patrick Ford, the director's son, have kept the dialogue down to a sparse minimum and in keeping with their characters and surroundings. But, as has been the case in other John Ford Western case histories, the people and their story are only featured. The \"star\" of \"Wagonmaster\" is the vast, colorful Utah locale in which a portion of it was filmed.\n\nWAGONMASTER; written by Frank Nugent and Patrick Ford; directed by John Ford; an Argosy Pictures production presented by John Ford and Merian C.
