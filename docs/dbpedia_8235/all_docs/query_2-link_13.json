Genevieve was born December 12,1922 in Bronx, New York to Nicoletta (nee Muro) and Alfred Romano. She attended PS12 and graduated from Evander Childs High School. She was employed by New York Telephone. During her years there she witnessed the advent of technology, always learning and adapting. She willingly worked split shifts so she could attend every Broadway play she could during the extended break. The theater, music and arts were some of her many passions.        She married Ralph DeRose on June 10, 1950 and for 56 years they shared a life together filled with love, devotion,, respect, understanding and joy.  After living in the Bronx, they moved to their home of more than 50 years in Carmel, NY. She was a devoted wife and mother. Genevieve was actively involved in the community and church.

In addition to her husband, she is predeceased by her parents, beloved aunt and uncle John and Ann Jaudas, and her grandson, Michael Gebhardt.       Genevieve's life spanned nearly a century. She embraced life, always learning, staying current and engaging others of all ages and walks of life welcoming them into her heart and home. Family and faith were the cornerstones of her life and her love was truly unconditional. She was an inspiration to all, living the Golden Rule of treating others the way you would want to be treated and doing good without telling a soul.       Genevieve will be remembered for her positive attitude, sense of humor, wisdom, grace, fortitude and most of all for her vibrant spirit and loving heart.
