        "text": "These school administrators make between $150K and $300K per year. See which leaders in your local school district made the list.\n\nNEW JERSEY — More than 2,500 educational administrators in the state made salaries of $150,000 or more during the past school year, according to data from the New Jersey Department of Education. Three were paid double, while 22 earned at least $250,000.\n\nPatch pulled salary data that includes superintendents, principals and other employees in administrative positions — down to assistant principals — within New Jersey schools. Out of roughly 8,400 people who fit the description, 2,556 of them made $150,000 or more.\n\nIt's becoming increasingly common for school administrators in New Jersey to make that much. In 2011, then-Gov. Chris Christie implemented a $175,000 cap for superintendents. The Christie administration raised their maximum base pay to $191,584 in 2017.\n\nBut Gov. Phil Murphy signed a law in 2019 that eliminates the cap for superintendent salaries but set guidelines for school-executive contracts to limit or standardize bonuses and other perks.\n\nSome of the state's highest-paid superintendents — especially those in more affluent districts — received generous pay increases in the past year, according to analysis from NJ Advance Media. For instance, the salary for the superintendent of the 700-student Demarest district increased almost 50 percent, from $153,967 to $228,477. Millburn's superintendent went from a salary of $167,500 to $228,477, according to NJ Advance Media's report.\n\nSchool-executive pay has long been a controversial subject in both local school district budgeting and state policy. While administrative salaries are often a flashpoint for criticism in school policy, many districts struggled to maintain experienced superintendents when the position's pay was capped, according to a 2019 analysis from NJ Spotlight.\n\nSuperintendents, principals and other school leaders throughout the nation have faced intense scrutiny for COVID-19 management and from politically charged movements to overhaul or eliminate certain subjects and topics from the curriculum. But those obstacles have also fallen to teachers and other rank-and-file school employees. And New Jersey has faced a shortage of teaching candidates that preceded the pandemic.
