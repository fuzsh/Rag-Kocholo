        "text": "The surname Derose was first found in Limousin, where this illustrious family has held a family seat since ancient times.\n\nThroughout the centuries, the family branched, prospered, and expanded to various provinces. Many members participated in the events of the times and were honored with lands, titles and letters patent confirming their nobility. As well, the Larose's formed several alliances with other noble families and in this way, titles and lands were exchanged according to the contracts. Distinctive members of this ancient family attended the Assembly of Notables at Bordeaux in 1789.\n\nBlaise Larose, born in 1650, son of François and Marguerite (née Crevier), settled in New France in the 17th century. After his arrival in Quebec he married Hélène Cailly, born in 1656, daughter of Pierre and Marie (née Sosse), on 25th September 1673. 1\n\nDerose Spelling Variations\n\nHistory has changed the spelling of most surnames. During the early development of the French language in the Middle Ages, a person gave his version of his name, phonetically, to a scribe, a priest, or a recorder. Some variables were adopted by different branches of the family name. Hence, there spelling variations of the name Derose, some of which include Larose, Laroses, Larause, La Rose, La Rause, Rosse, De Rose, De Rosse and many more.\n\nDerose migration to the United States +\n\nIn the 1700s, land incentives were finally given out by France to 2,000 migrants. Early marriage was encouraged in New France, and youths of 18 took fourteen-year-old girls for their wives. The fur trade was developed and attracted migrants, both noble and commoner from France. 15,000 explorers left Montreal in the late 17th and 18th centuries, leaving French names scattered across the continent. The search for the Northwest passage continued. Migration from France to New France or Quebec, as it was now more popularly called, continued until 1759. By 1675, there were 7000 French in Quebec. By the same year the Acadian presence in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island had reached 500. In the treaty of Utrecht, Acadia were ceded by France to Britain in 1713. In 1755, 10,000 French Acadians refused to take an oath of allegiance to England and were deported. They found refuge in Louisiana. Meanwhile, in Quebec, the French race flourished, founding in Lower Canada, one of the two great solitudes which became Canada. Many of this distinguished family name Derose were prominent in social, cultural, religious and political affairs in France and New France. Amongst the settlers in North America with this distinguished name Derose were\n\nDerose Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nJohn James DeRose, who arrived in New York in 1798 3\n\nDerose Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nJohn James Derose, aged 40, who arrived in New York in 1801 3"
