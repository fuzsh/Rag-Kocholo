        "text": "NEWARK, NJ – Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr., (D-Newark) is announcing the endorsement of his longtime colleague and friend Mayor Ras Baraka in the Democratic Primary election for the 10th Congressional District seat. Congressman Payne and Mayor Baraka both grew up and continue to live in the South Ward of Newark, and they served together on the City Council.\n\n“Congressman Payne was born in Newark, raised in Newark, and has spent his career fighting for Newark residents – nobody understands our community the way he does,” said Mayor Baraka. “When we faced a public health crisis with thousands of lead pipes that had to be removed to protect our residents, Congressman Payne stepped up immediately with federal funding to get the project started. That’s the kind of leadership we need from our representatives in Washington, and it’s why I’m proud to stand with Congressman Payne.”\n\nCongressman Payne has consistently delivered federal funds for important local priorities including expanding head start programs, supporting local colleges and moving forward with infrastructure projects like the critical Gateway Tunnel. He successfully advocated to include $65 billion for broadband infrastructure and deployment into the bipartisan infrastructure bill, including provisions to close the digital divide, lower costs, increase competition, and protect consumers. Congressman Payne successfully petitioned FEMA to open a federal COVID-19 vaccine site in Newark, and his work helping pass the American Rescue Plan provided cash assistance to residents and businesses during the pandemic.\n\n“The City of Newark is incredibly fortunate to have a leader like Mayor Baraka at the helm, because he’s fully committed to both revitalizing the community and protecting what makes it such a truly unique and special place,” said Congressman Payne. “There’s nowhere else I would want to live than the South Ward of Newark, and no one I would rather have at my side than Mayor Baraka. I thank him for his support and look forward to supporting him and his team in their own election in May.”"
