        "text": "NEWARK, New Jersey (WABC) -- New Jersey Transit Police saved a newborn baby's life after she stopped breathing at Penn Station in Newark.\n\nThe officers found the baby girl and her mother inside the train station's bathroom.\n\nOfficer Bryan Richards gave the baby CPR, but she was still unresponsive and they rushed her to the hospital.\n\nAs Officer Alberto Nunes drove, the baby responded to chest compressions and started breathing.\n\nThe baby remains hospitalized at University Hospital, where she's expected to be okay.\n\nRELATED: Port Authority Police deliver baby on Staten Island Expressway\n\n\"It's obviously not something you see every day, but as a department it's something we do train on,\" said Richards, who told reporters he has a 7-month-old infant at home. \"We do train in CPR training every couple of years to keep our training up.... When the stress and everything else... you do go back to your training. And that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nWATCH: Hero NJT officers talk about saving infant\n\n----------\n\n* More New Jersey news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts"
