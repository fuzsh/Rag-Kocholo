Contact the center director to learn more about our child care options and schedule a tour!\n\nKinderCare Learning Center at Newark Programs\n\nInfant Programs (6 weeks–1 year)\n\nLeaving your baby in someone else’s care is a big step. Everyone at our centers—most importantly, our naturally gifted infant teachers—will work with you to make sure the transition goes smoothly. When you step into our infant classroom, you’ll see how much we want your infant to feel safe, loved, and ready to explore their world.\n\nToddler Programs (1–2 Years)\n\nEverything in our toddler classroom is designed for little explorers. That’s because a lot is going on at this age. When your child is wandering all over the place, that means they’re learning and discovering new things every day. We’ll help them explore their interests (and find new ones!) as they play and learn.\n\nDiscovery Preschool Programs (2–3 Years)\n\nThis age is filled with so much wonder and curiosity. That’s why we offer a ton of books and toys and bring artwork down to kids eye level. Children in discovery preschool also begin to learn how we all work together in a classroom. Simple math and science, pretend play, and group play help them get used to a more structured school setting.\n\nPrekindergarten Programs (4–5 Years)\n\nWhen you walk into one of our pre-K classrooms, you’ll see artwork and writing displayed around the room. Labels are everywhere to help kids connect letters with words. You’ll also see pictures on the walls that reflect the families in our community. Your child will also deepen their knowledge in language, math, science, Spanish, and social skills.\n\nTransitional Kindergarten Programs (4–5 Years)\n\nIf your child finished pre-K but missed the kindergarten cutoff date, transitional kindergarten is a great stepping stone to big-kid school. Our project-based learning model emphasizes critical thinking, communication, and creativity. Kids take lead roles on projects and complete them in small groups.\n\nKindergarten Programs (5–6 Years)\n\nWelcome to kindergarten: the gateway to grade school and everything that comes next! Offered in select centers, our kindergarten programs have small class sizes and curriculums that mix learning and fun. The basic building blocks of reading, writing, math, and science are key in kindergarten, so we make sure they get lots of practice in all of these areas.\n\nBefore- and After-School Programs (5–12 Years)\n\nYou can count on us to provide reliable care for your school-ager while you’re at work, with safe transportation from our center to your child’s school and back! Whether your child wants to start a drama club, build a volcano, or create a comic book, they will have a place to follow their dreams. Your child will start and end the day with a whole lot of fun!\n\nSchool Break Programs (preschool, prekindergarten, and school-age)\n\nWinter break, spring break, summer break—when school’s out (but you still need to work), you can count on KinderCare to provide a safe and supportive learning environment that’s focused on fun. We welcome children ages 5–12 during school break times and make sure they have a sensational, screen-free experience they won’t forget.\n\nLearning Adventures - Enrichment Program\n\nCooking Academy™ (3 – 12 Years)\n\nIn Cooking Academy, kids learn new recipes from cultures around the world and develop a healthy relationship with food. They’ll whip up everything from Southwest rainbow lettuce wraps to pumpkin muffins, building their skills in STEM, communication, and more along the way. And yes—little chefs get to eat their culinary creations!\n\nMath Adventures\n\nThe Math Adventures enrichment program is designed to teach important mathematics concepts like geometry, numbers, currency, measurements, and probability. Whether they’re couting currency or weighing their favorite toy, your child will explore math fundamentals that’ll give them a confident start for elementary school.\n\nMusic Explorers™ (2 – 4 Years)\n\nKinderCare families are already giving a standing ovation to our newest Learning Adventures program: Music Explorers! Kids will learn to sing, move, listen, play instruments, and even create their own tunes. Our original curriculum blends math, science, social studies, literacy, and mindfulness (think yoga!) for a uniquely KinderCare way of learning the foundations of music.\n\nPhonics Adventures® (2 – 4 Years)\n\nLearning how to read is a whole lot of fun at KinderCare! We help kids grow to love books and words (and get ready for kindergarten) in our Phonics Adventures program. From discovering the basics of vowels to practicing poetry, kids learn all about letters and sounds in small-group lessons made just for their age group. (Bonus: Kids who attend our phonics program are more prepared than their peers for school—and we have the data to prove it.)\n\nSTEM Innovators (3-8 Years)\n\nYou’ve probably heard a lot about how important STEM education is for your child, but what does that really mean? Our STEM Innovators program takes kids’ natural ability to make sense of the world and applies it to robotics, chemistry, coding, geology, and more. While your child experiments, they’ll discover how to use technology to do amazing things!\n\nFamily Stories\n\nDon't take our word for it. Hear what our families have to say about our amazing center! If you have a story about your experience at KinderCare, please share your story with us.\n\n“ My first son started KinderCare Learning Center at Newark at 1.5 years old and graduated Kindergarten from there. He started reading at 2.5 years old. They have a great phonics, math and language program and its almost as if your child is getting 1 to 1 attention. I accredit most if not all of his success to KinderCare Newark. My son now is 11 years old doing 8th grade full time curriculum work. He's supposed to be in 6th grade. He even attended summer camp this year and had a blast. Ms.Susan, Ms. Shana and her staff are very friendly and passionate about their job. The turn over is very low as evident that my second son who is now 18 months old has some of the same teachers my 11 year old had like Ms.Lateefa and others. Ms.Naomi is an excellent infant room teacher, Ms.Loretta in Infant C is super sweet and Ms.Erica, Ms. Linda, Ms.Kim, Ms.Kendra, Ms.Joy are wonderful as is all their staff. They truly love their jobs and love the children. They are very friendly and the curriculum they implement is outstanding. They have monthly themes, constant projects even in the infant room. They offer delicious food cooked right at the center. I have visited other centers and they smell or are overcrowded, they do not have a curriculum and the staff is sub-par. There is no other place I would trust or recommend.\n\nShow more\n\nYaneth C. - KinderCare Parent\n\n“ We have been part of the KinderCare family since 2006. We enrolled our first child when he was 18 months old. During his time at the center, my son was exposed to fun, learning experiences and to a caring staff that nurtured his individuality and love for learning. It was this experience that laid a strong foundation for a smooth transition to Kindergarten. When he began Kindergarten at a private school, his teacher commented on how far ahead he was ahead on his reading and math skills from other children in his class. This was in no small measure thanks to the work of the educators at KinderCare and to the curriculum they follow. When our second child came along, we had our doubts about putting him in daycare since he had been born premature and had several health challenges. In the end, we decided to enroll him and that was the best decision we could possibly have made. Under the leadership of Susan Casbar, the KinderCare staff welcomed our child with open arms and provided a level of care second only to what I could have provided myself. Starting with the Director and down the line of caregivers at the center, my child was surrounded by second mothers. Not only did the staff pay close attention to my son's developmental and nutritional needs, but I often found myself overwhelmed by the love that surrounded my children. Both of my children love to learn and explore. I know that their passion for learning was fueled by the enthusiasm and commitment of Ms. Toney, Ms. Lateefah, Ms. Krystal, and the entire KinderCare staff. My children are now in first and fifth grades, but we often return to visit our KinderCare family for special events and summer camp, and the staff always makes us feel at home. The relationship we forged with KinderCare continues and will for many years to come.\n\nShow more\n\nYacosta - KinderCare Parent\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat accreditations does KinderCare have?\n\nWe are your trusted caregiver.
