He began writing for London's Sunday Express that year as an expert racing correspondent, an arrangement that continued for 16 years. Inspired by the success of his autobiography, and the slim wages of journalism, Mr. Francis decided to write a crime mystery about a jockey who is killed in the middle of a race .\n\n\"Dead Cert\" came out in 1962, and after that he wrote about a book a year. His books were devoured by millions, and fans took pride in Mr. Francis' attention to detail and realism. He won many awards, including the Mystery Writers of America's Edgar Allan Poe Award an unprecedented three times. His wife, the former Mary Brenchley, died in 2000 .\n\nHe is survived by two sons, Felix, with whom he co-authored recent books, and Merrick. Before Mr. Francis began his writing career, he was unsure whether he would be remembered for much else besides riding Devon Loch, the Queen Mother's fallen horse. \"I heard one man say to another, 'Who did you say that was? Dick Francis? Oh, yes, he's the man who didn't win the Mr. Francis wrote in his autobiography .\n\n\"What an trial Avenue in Little Ferry in the early 1960s and Mr. DeRose placed his father's mixer in the lobby, where it remains to this day, a reminder DeROSE of the company's humble origins. Major Products, whose soup bases come in paste, liquid and powder form, also has manufacturing operations in Nevada, Canada and Europe. Its annual sales exceed $20 million, Daniel DeRose III said. Mr .\n\nDeRose was a hands-on business owner with an impeccable palate. \"When our research and development team wanted him to taste something,\" his son said, \"they'd come into his office with a tray, and he'd sample and say, 'It needs a little more celery' or 'It has too much He knew ingredients.\" Mr. DeRose was so devoted to running his company that he put off marriage. \"He always said if he didn't marry before he was 50, he wouldn't marry,\" said his broth tary\" and sang Strauss's \"Voices of Spring.\" She was cast in three minor films, including a musical with Abbott and Costello, then GRAYSON played Gene Kelly's girlfriend in a wartime revue that included major MGM stars, \"Thousands Cheer.\" \"Anchors Aweigh,\" a 1945 hit with Kelly and Frank Sinatra, confirmed her star status. Her bell-like soprano made her the ideal co-star with Hollywood's full-voiced male singers in operettas and other musicals .\n\nShe made three films with Howard Keel, two with Mario Lanza, one with Gordon MacRae. Other musicals included \"Two Sisters from Boston,\" \"Ziegfeld Follies,\" \"Till the Clouds Roll By,\" \"That Midnight Ess,\" \"The Toast of New Orleans,\" \"Lovely to Look At,\" \"The Desert Song\" and \"So This Is Love.\" Ms. Grayson was born Zelma Kathryn Hedrick on Feb. 9, 1922, in Winston-Salem, N.C.

Mr. Francis often said that if a mystery had FRANCIS not unfolded literally underneath his feet at the Grand National during the mid-1950s, he might never have started writing at all. Known as one of the most challenging events for horse and man, the course, just short of 4.5 miles, is filled with tall jumps that, if not cleared properly, often lead to fatal crashes. Mr .\n\nFrancis and his mount, Devon Loch, had survived the course and were in the lead strides away from the finish when the big brown gelding suddenly collapsed in a heap. After the incident, the horse stood up, apparently uninjured and healthy. News of the spectacular spill spread across Britain, where photos of the horse splayed out on the turf accompanied front-page news stories. Mr. Francis, then 37, retired from race riding months later, citing a body too plagued by injuries including six collar-bone breaks, five nose breaks, a fractured skull, a broken back and dislocated shoulders .\n\nHe once suffered a gash on his face when a horse stepped on it. His fame as Britain's favorite failed hero led an agent to push Dick Francis; jockey, writer of popular mystery novels By T. REES SHAPIRO WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE Dick Francis, a champion jockey for the British royal family who turned to writing crime fiction and helped launch an immensely popular subgenre of mysteries set in the horse-racing world, died Sunday at a home he kept in the Cayman Islands. No cause of death was reported, but he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in the mid-1990s. He was 89 .\n\nIn a career spanning four decades and 42 novels, Mr. Francis sold more than 60 million books. His protagonists, often former jockeys themselves, caromed through page-turning murder plots and ruthless kidnapping schemes. They endured impossibly excruciating torture but solved the mystery, nabbed the bad guy and usually got the girl. Reviewers said Mr .\n\nFrancis captured the authentic smells, sounds and sights of the racetrack. Author Carol Flake once wrote in The New York Times that Mr. Francis' plots moved so quickly that \"one is tempted to handicap his books rather than review them, assigning each a speed rating and a weight allowance.\" As a jockey in Britain after World War II, he won about 350 races during his nine-year career and was Champion Jockey of the 1953-54 season.
