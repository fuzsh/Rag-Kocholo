        "text": ".\n\nPhilip Roth penned Newark to literary fame. Set off a self guided tour and explore the places and passages from Roth's best known books. Beware, Newark endearment is quite contagious.\n\n\"I felt a deep knowledge of Newark, an attachment so rooted that it could not help but branch out into affection.\" - Goodbye, Columbus\n\nThe Counterlife - \"While dialing home from the restaurant, Henry remembered that after the lecture, the question period, Nathan had been asked by a student he wrote \"in quest of immortality.\" He could hear Nathan laughing and giving the answer-it was as close to his dead brother as he'd come all day. \"If you're from New Jersey, \"Nathan had said, \"and you write thirty books, and you win the Nobel Prize, and you live to be white-haired and ninety five, it's highly unlikely but not impossible that after your death they'll decide to name a rest stop for you on the Jersey Turnpike. And so, long after you're gone, you may indeed be remembered, but mostly by small children, in the backs of cars, when they lean forward and tell their parents, â€˜Stop, please, stop at Zuckerman-I have to pee.' For a New Jersey novelist that's as much immortality as it's realistic to hope for.\" 81 Summit Avenue\n\nI thought that if you knew that in this four-family Hobson Street house there once lived the third baseman Seymour Feldman and that down a few doors had lived Ronnie Rubin, who in his boyhood had been our catcher, you'd understand how and where the Feldman and the Rubin Families had been naturalized irrevocably by their young sons.\"\n\nWeequahic Neighborhood\n\nThe Plot Against America - \"Near the church was a small rectory; like most everything else situated within the black iron palings of this alien world it had been built during the latter part of the previous century, several decades before the first of our houses went up and the western edge of the weequahic neighborhood took shape as Newark's Jewish frontier. Behind the church was the grammar school serving the orphans-there were about a hundred of them-and a smaller number of local Catholic kids. The school and the orphanage were run by an order of nuns, German nuns, I remember being told. Jewish children raised even in tolerant households like mine would generally cross the street on the race occasions we saw them swishing our way in their witchy attire, and family lore had it had it that when my brother, as a small child sitting alone on our front stoop one afternoon, spotted a pair of them approaching from chancellor Avenue, he had called excitedly to my mother, \"look, Ma-the nuts.\"\n\nWeequahic High Portnoy's Complaint - \"Here, in fact, was a cheer that my cousin and his buddies used to send up from the stands at the end of a game in which Weequahic had once again met with seeming disaster. I used to chant it with them:\n\nIkey, Mikey, Jake and Sam, We're the boys who eat no ham, We play football, we play soccer- And we keep matzohs in our locker! Aye, aye, aye, Weequahic High!\"\n\n\"Which was more or less the prevailing attitude towards athletics in general, and football in particular, among the parents in the neighborhood: it was for the goyim. Let them knock their heads together for \"glory,\" for victory in a ball game! As my Aunt Clara put it, in that taut, violin-string voice of hers, \"Hershie! Please! I do not need \"goyische naches!\" Didn't need, didn't want such ridiculous pleasures and satisfactions as made the gentiles happy... At football our Jewish high school was notoriously hopeless (though the band, may I say, was always winning prizes and commendations); our pathetic record was of course a disappointment to the young, no matter what the parents might feel, and yet even as a child one was able to understand that for us to lose at football was not exactly the ultimate catastrophe.\"\n\nAt the western end of the neighborhood, the parkless end where we lived, there resided an occasional schoolteacher of pharmacist but otherwise few professionals were among our immediate neighbors and certainly none of the prosperous entrepreneurial or manufacturing families.\n\nClinton Avenue\n\nPlot Against America - \"I tried to gauge from what I saw beyond the bus window how much time remained before we got to summit Avenue and it was too late to unseal my fate. We were on Clinton Avenue just passing the Riviera Hotel, where, as I never failed to remember, my mother and father had spent their wedding night. We were clear of downtown, about halfway home, and directly ahead was Temple B'nai Abraham, the great oval fortress built to serve the city's Jewish rich and no less foreign to me than if it had been the Vatican.\"\n\nEssex County Courthouse\n\nI Married A Communist - \"We went into Newark's Third Ward, where the Negroes had come to occupy the streets and houses of the old Jewish immigrants' slum. Ira spoke to everyone he saw, men and women, boys and girls, asked what they did and how they lived and what they thought about maybe changing \"the crappy system and the damn problem of ignorant cruelty\" that deprived them of their equality.\n\nHe'd sit down on a bench outside a Negro barbershop on shabby Spruce Street, around the corner from where my father had been raised in a Belmont Avenue tenement, say to the men congregated on the sidewalk, \"I'm ever a guy to butt into other people's conversations,\" and begin talking to them about their equality, and to me he never looked more like the elongated Abraham Lincoln who is cast in bronze at the foot of the broad stairway leading up to Newark's Essex County Courthouse, Gutzon Borglum's locally famous, seated and waiting welcomingly on a marble bench before the courthouse, in his sociable posture and by his gaunt bearded face revealing that he is wise and grave and fatherly and judicious and good.\""
