Carter later completed additional graduate studies at Columbia University and the Union Theological Seminary in New York City.\n\nCarter entered local politics in Montclair, New Jersey in 1964, winning election to the Montclair Town Commission. He ran on the Montclair Community Committee slate and was the top vote-getter with 6,694 votes. Four of the five candidates on Carter's ticket won. He served as both the Commissioner of Public Works and the Vice Mayor of Montclair from 1964 to 1968. Carter also held a seat on the Montclair Township Commission. He was re-elected to the Township Commission in 1968, defeating eleven other candidates in the election.\n\nIn 1971, Carter sought the Republican nomination for New Jersey State Senator, running At-Large in Essex County. His running mates were three incumbent Senators, Michael Giuliano, James Wallwork, and Milton Waldor, as well as North Caldwell Republican Chairman Frederic Remington.
