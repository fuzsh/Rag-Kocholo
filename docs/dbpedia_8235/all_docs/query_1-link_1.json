He completed his undergraduate studies at Rutgers University and became a graduate of Rutgers Law School.\n\nHe began his Law practice in Newark NJ, in the 1960’s, ultimately moving to Nutley, New Jersey, where he was the senior partner of the firm DeRose & Rinaldi.\n\nHe later became Vice President and General Counsel of Little Ferry-based Major Products Co., a global manufacturer of soup base, gravy and seasonings. The company was founded by Mr. DeRose’s late brother, Daniel DeRose Jr.\n\nMr. DeRose was a member of the board of trustees for Columbus Hospital, in Newark, New Jersey and served as President of the Board.\n\nMr. DeRose was also active in New Jersey politics through the 1960’s and ’70’s, eventually representing Essex County in the State Senate, where he strongly opposed the creation of a state income tax. He later ran in the 1973 and 1977 New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial primaries.\n\nIn 1974, Governor Brendan Byrne appointed Mr. DeRose the New Jersey Commissioner for the Bi-State Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor, an interstate government regulatory agency, having the mission of investigating and policing criminal activity in the Port District. He also returned to serve as the commission’s secretary, in the early 1980’s."
