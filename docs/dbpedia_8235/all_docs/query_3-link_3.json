        "text": "Frank Sinatra was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants Natalina Della (Garaventa), from Northern Italy, and Saverio Antonino Martino Sinatra, a Sicilian boxer, fireman, and bar owner. Growing up on the gritty streets of Hoboken made Sinatra determined to work hard to get ahead. Starting out as a saloon singer in musty little dives (he carried his own P.A. system), he eventually got work as a band singer, first with The Hoboken Four, then with Harry James and then Tommy Dorsey. With the help of George Evans (Sinatra's genius press agent), his image was shaped into that of a street thug and punk who was saved by his first wife, Nancy Barbato Sinatra. In 1942 he started his solo career, instantly finding fame as the king of the bobbysoxers--the young women and girls who were his fans--and becoming the most popular singer of the era among teenage music fans. About that time his film career was also starting in earnest, and after appearances in a few small films, he struck box-office gold with a lead role in Urlaub in Hollywood (1945) with Gene Kelly, a Best Picture nominee at the 1946 Academy Awards. Sinatra was awarded a special Oscar for his part in a short film that spoke out against intolerance, The House I Live In (1945). His career on a high, Sinatra went from strength to strength on record, stage and screen, peaking in 1949, once again with Gene Kelly, in the MGM musical Das ist New York (1949) and Spiel zu dritt (1949). A controversial public affair with screen siren Ava Gardner broke up his marriage to Nancy Barbato Sinatra and did his career little good, and his record sales dwindled. He continued to act, although in lesser films such as Zu allem entschlossen (1952), and a vocal cord hemorrhage all but ended his career. He fought back, though, finally securing a role he desperately wanted--Maggio in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). He won an Oscar for best supporting actor and followed this with a scintillating performance as a cold-blooded assassin hired to kill the US President in Der Attentäter (1954). Arguably a career-best performance--garnering him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor--was his role as a pathetic heroin addict in the powerful drama Der Mann mit dem goldenen Arm (1955).\n\nKnown as \"One-Take Charlie\" for his approach to acting that strove for spontaneity and energy, rather than perfection, Sinatra was an instinctive actor who was best at playing parts that mirrored his own personality. He continued to give strong and memorable performances in such films as Schwere Jungen, leichte Mädchen (1955), Schicksalsmelodie (1957) and Verdammt sind sie alle (1958). In the late 1950s and 1960s Sinatra became somewhat prolific as a producer, turning out such films as Eine Nummer zu groß (1959), Die siegreichen Drei (1962) and the very successful Sieben gegen Chicago (1964). Lighter roles alongside \"Rat Pack\" buddies Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. were lucrative, especially the famed Frankie und seine Spießgesellen (1960). On the other hand, he alternated such projects with much more serious offerings, such as Botschafter der Angst (1962), regarded by many critics as Sinatra's finest picture. He made his directorial debut with the World War II picture Der Lohn der Mutigen (1965), which was the first Japanese/American co-production. That same year Colonel von Ryans Expreß (1965) was a box office sensation. In 1967 Sinatra returned to familiar territory in Sidney J. Furie's Der Mann am Draht (1967), once again playing as assassin in his only film to be shot in the U.K. and Germany. That same year he starred as a private investigator in Der Schnüffler (1967), a role he reprised in the sequel, Die Lady in Zement (1968). He also starred with Lee Remick in Der Detektiv (1968), a film daring for its time with its theme of murders involving rich and powerful homosexual men, and it was a major box-office success.\n\nAfter appearing in the poorly received comic western Dirty Dingus, der scharfe Bandit (1970), Sinatra didn't act again for seven years, returning with a made-for-TV cops-and-mob-guys thriller Das Cherry-Street-Fiasko (1977), which he also produced. Based on the novel by William Rosenberg, this fable of fed-up cops turning vigilante against the mob boasted a stellar cast and was a ratings success. Sinatra returned to the big screen in Die erste Todsünde (1980), once again playing a New York detective, in a moving and understated performance that was a fitting coda to his career as a leading man. He made one more appearance on the big screen with a cameo in Auf dem Highway ist wieder die Hölle los (1984) and a final acting performance in Magnum (1980), in 1987, as a retired police detective seeking vengeance on the killers of his granddaughter, in an episode entitled Laura (1987).\n\nWhitney Elizabeth Houston was born into a musical family on 9 August 1963, in Newark, New Jersey, the daughter of gospel star Cissy Houston (née Emily Lee Drinkard) and John Russell Houston, Jr., and cousin of singing star Dionne Warwick.\n\nShe began singing in the choir at her church, The New Hope Baptist Church in Newark, as a young child and by the age of 15 was singing backing vocals professionally with her mother on Chaka Khan's 1978 hit, 'I'm Every Woman'. She went on to provide backing vocals for Lou Rawls, Jermaine Jackson and her own mother and worked briefly as a model, appearing on the cover of 'Seventeen' magazine in 1981.\n\nShe began working as a featured vocalist for the New York-based funk band Material and it was the quality of her vocal work with them that attracted the attention of the major record labels, including Arista with whom she signed in 1983 and where she stayed for the rest of her career.\n\nHer debut album, 'Whitney Houston', was released in 1985 and became the biggest-selling album by a debut artist. Several hit singles, including 'Saving All My Love For You', 'How Will I Know', 'You Give Good Love', and 'The Greatest Love of All', were released from the album, setting her up for a Beatles-beating seven consecutive US number ones. The album itself sold 3 million copies in its first year in the US and went on to sell 25 million worldwide, winning her the first of her six Grammies.\n\nThe 1987 follow-up album, 'Whitney', which included the hits 'Where Do Broken Hearts Go' and 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody', built on her success but it was the 1992 film Bodyguard (1992) that sealed her place as one of the best-selling artists of all time. While the movie itself and her performance in it were not highly praised, the soundtrack album and her cover of the Dolly Parton song 'I Will Always Love You' topped the singles and albums charts for months and sold 44 million copies around the world.\n\nThat same year she married ex-New Edition singer Bobby Brown with whom she had her only child, their daughter Bobbi Kristina Brown in March 1993. It was about this time that her much documented drug use began and by 1996 she was a daily user.\n\nHer 1998 album, 'My Love Is Your Love' was well reviewed but the drug abuse began to affect her reputation and press reports at the time said that she was becoming difficult to work with, if she turned up at all. She was dropped from a performance at The 72nd Annual Academy Awards (2000) because she was \"out of it\" at rehearsals. Her weight fluctuated wildly - she was so thin at a 'Michael Jackson' tribute in 2001 that rumors circulated the next day that she had died - and her voice began to fail her. She was twice admitted to rehab and declared herself drug-free in 2010 but returned to rehab in May 2011.\n\nHer 2009 comeback album 'I Look To You' was positively received and sold well, but promotional performances were still marred by her weakened voice. Her final acting performance was in Sparkle (2012) (a remake of the 1976 movie, Sparkle - Der Weg zum Star (1976)), released after her death.\n\nShe was found dead in a Beverly Hills hotel room on 11 February 2012.\n\nBruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born September 23, 1949 in Long Branch, New Jersey, USA. His father, Douglas Frederick Springsteen, worked as a bus driver, and was of Irish and Dutch ancestry. His mother, Adele Ann (Zerilli), worked as a legal secretary, and was of Italian descent. He has an older sister, Virginia, and a younger sister Pamela Springsteen. Bruce was raised as a Catholic. He was inspired to take up music when he, at the age of seven, saw Elvis Presley on Toast of the Town (1948). When he was thirteen he bought his first guitar for 18 dollars. His mother took out a loan when Bruce was 16 and bought him a Kent guitar for 60 dollars.\n\nIn 1965, he became the lead guitarist in the band \"The Castiles\", he would later become lead singer in the band. The Castiles recorded two original songs at a public recording studio in Brick Township, New Jersey. From 1969 to 1971 he performed with Steven Van Zandt, Danny Federici and Vini \"Mad Dog\" Lopez in a band called \"Child\", that was renamed later to \"Steel Mill\" when guitarist Robbin Thompson joined the band.\n\nIn 1972, he signed a record deal with Columbia Records and released his debut album, \"Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J.\", with his New Jersey-based colleagues, who would later be called \"The E Street Band\", In January, 1973. The album had critical success and so did their second album, \"The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\", released in September, 1973, but had little commercial success. In 1975, after more than 14 month of recording, their third album was released, \"Born to Run\", which had both critical and commercial success for Springsteen and the band.\n\nIn 1977, he returned to the studio, after a two-year legal battle with former manager Mike Appel, and produced the album, \"Darkness on the Edge of Town\", released in 1978 and became a turning point musically for his career. In 1980 came the release of \"The River\", the album sold well and he followed up with the album \"Nebraska\" which had critical success but had little commercial success. Springsteen came back with a bang with the release of the album \"Born in the U.S.A.\" in 1984, which sold 15 million copies in the U.S. alone and had seven top ten singles. It became one of the best-selling albums of all time.\n\nAfter the huge success of the \"Born in the U.S.A.\" album he released a more calm and sedate album in 1987, \"Tunnel of Love\", which included songs about love lost and the challenges of love, after the break-up with first wife, Julianne Phillips. The albums released in 1992, \"Lucky Town\" and \"Human Touch\" were also popular, Human Touch being the most popular of the two, hitting the number one spot of the best-selling albums in the UK. In 1994 he won an academy award for the song \"Streets of Philadelphia\" featured in the film Philadelphia (1993).\n\nIn 1995, he released the album \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\", which was mostly a solo guitar album and was inspired by \"Journey to Nowhere: The Saga of the New Underclass,\" a book by Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Dale Maharidge. After being apart from the E Street Band for several years they reunited with a successful tour which ended in Madison Square Garden in New York in the year 2000. In 2002 he released the first studio album with the full band in over 18 years, \"The Rising\", and it became a critical and commercial success. In 2005 he released his third folk album (after \"Nebraska\" and \"The Ghost of Tom Joad\"), \"Devils & Dust\" It was followed by \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions\" in 2006 and \"Magic\" in 2007. His 16th album will be released on January 27, 2009 and is called \"Working on a Dream\".\n\nHe married for the first time at the age of 35 to actress Julianne Phillips. The marriage helped boost her acting career, but his traveling took it's toll on the marriage and the final blow came when she found out his affair with the American singer/songwriter/guitarist Patti Scialfa. Their marriage ended in 1989. He then married Patti Scialfa on June 8th, 1991, They had lived together since the separation between him and his first wife and they had a child before they married. They have three children together: Evan James Springsteen (born July 25, 1990), Jessica Rae (born December 30, 1991) and Sam Ryan Springsteen (born January 5, 1994).\n\nJon Bon Jovi, was born John Francis Bongiovi, Jr. On March 2, 1962, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey to parents John Francis Bongiovi, Sr. and Carol Sharkey.\n\nFamily: Jon's mother, Carol Sharkey, was a former model and one of the first Playboy Bunnies. She met Bon Jovi's father after she enlisted in the United States Marines. John was already in the Marines when they met.\n\nBon Jovi has two brothers, Anthony and Matthew. Bon Jovi has four children, and is married to Dorothea Hurley (1989-present).\n\nKnown best as a singer-songwriter, in 1983 he was the founder and frontman of a band that bears his name. Bon Jovi is also known as a record producer, actor and philanthropist.\n\nMusic Career: Bon Jovi's music career started in June of 1982 after he was turned down by several record labels, including Atlantic Records and Mercury (Polygram) for the song \"Runaway\" which he recorded with a studio band named \"The Allstars.\"\n\nAfter being turned down he visited New York City's major market rock station WAPP, also known as \"The Apple\" at 103.5FM. WAPP included the song on a compilation of local talent and it became in instant hit.\n\nIn 1983 he signed with Mercury Records to promote \"Runaway\" and had to form a new band. Jon Bon Jovi became David Bryan, Alec John Such, bassist, Tico Torres, drummer, and his neighbor, Dave Sabo at lead guitar. Sabo played only a few local shows before he left to form the group Skid Row with Rachel Bolan. Sabo was soon replaced with Richie Sambora.\n\nAfter \"Runaway\" became a worldwide hit, Bon Jovi wanted a name for the band. He wanted to call themselves Johnny Electric. But Richard Fischer, employed then by Doc McGhee, suggested that Bon Jovi follow the norm where many bands were naming their groups by the lead or frontman' name, such as, Van Halen, Dokken, Bryan Adams, Alice Cooper (70's), so Bon Jovi became the name of the band.\n\nThe band's breakout album, \"Slippery When Wet,\" was their third studio album released in 1986. It became the band's best-selling album, selling more than 28 million worldwide, according to a Jan. 29, 2008 issue of the Daily Telegraph.\n\nBon Jovi's next album, \"New Jersey,\" not only shared the same success as \"Slippery When Wet,\" the album had five top-10 hits on Billboard's Hot-100. No other album or artist ever produced as many top-10 hits, and as of this writing (September 4, 2016) this record still stands. And two of the top-10 hits, \"Bad Medicine\" and \"I'll Be There For You\" topped the charts at number one, according to Bon Jovi's Biography on the Billboard website.\n\nThe band then went on an 18-month international tour, and when they finished, the band went on a hiatus.\n\nHiatus and Young Guns II: During the hiatus, Bon Jovi was hired to write the soundtrack for the movie \"Young Guns II.\" During this time actor Emilio Estevez approached Bon Jovi and asked if he could use \"Wanted, Dead or Alive\" as the title song for the movie.\n\nBon Jovi balked at the idea, saying he didn't think that song was the proper song, so he quickly wrote \"Blaze of Glory.\"\n\nAs the story goes, Kiefer Sutherland in an interview for UNCUT magazine said; \"When Jon (Bon Jovi) joined the team for Young Guns II, we were all eating hamburgers in a diner and Jon was scribbling on this napkin for, say, six minutes. He declared he'd written 'Blaze of Glory', which of course then went through the roof in the States. He later gave Emilio Estevez the napkin. We were munching burgers while he wrote a No. 1 song... Made us feel stupid.\"\n\nAfterwards, Bon Jovi played the song in a New Mexico desert for Estevez and John Fusco. This was the first time Bon Jovi played the song and heard by anyone. When the co-producers heard the song in a trailer, it was a no-brainer. It became the theme song for \"Young Guns II.\"\n\n\"Young Guns II,\" which was released in 1990 named which Bon Jovi made into his next album \"Blaze of Glory.\" This was Bon Jovi's first solo album as the other band members were off doing other things during the hiatus.\n\nThe movie's budget was $20 million and went on to earn $44 million. Two hits came from this album, \"Blaze of Glory\" and Miracle.\" Bon Jovi earned several Grammy and Oscar nominations.\n\nWhile he wrote a song or two for a couple of shows before this, this was his first and only project where he wrote every song for a movie's soundtrack. He did go on to write songs for other movies, and many of the group's songs were used in a variety of TV series.\n\nBack Together (Kind Of): During the years from their first hit \"Runaway\" in 1982, the group has released 12 studio albums and Bon Jovi recorded two solo albums and a number of singles. Worldwide, his band has sold more than 130 albums, ranking them among the top of the best sellers.\n\nBut the band isn't sitting around and resting. In 2015 there were rumors of a planned new album to be released sometime in 2016.\n\nRumors used to spread like wildfires, but today, the Internet allows them to travel at the speed of light. Talk about a new album for 2016 was confirmed by a consultant, and another world tour would follow.\n\nOn September 30, 2015, Bon Jovi said during a press conference confirming the new album, its title will be \"This House Is Not For Sale.\" He further said that the album is about the group's integrity.\n\n\"Integrity matters and we're at a place in our career where we don't have anything left to prove,\" Bon Jovi said.\n\nHowever, the new album is the first one without creative input from Richie Sambora, who left the group in 2013.\n\nOn Bon Jovi's Facebook page, a post announced that the new album, \"This House Is Not For Sale\" was released on August 27, 2016\n\nActing Career: He started acting in the 1990's starring in minor roles in movies such as \"U-571,\" and \"Moonlight and Valentino,\" and as Helen Hunt's husband in the movie \"Pay It Forward\" starring Kevin Spacey. He also appeared on several TV shows such as \"Sex and the City\" and \"Ally McBeal.\"\n\nAccolades: In 2009, Bon Jovi was inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\nBon Jovi has also made appearances on some prestigious lists:\n\nIn 1996, he was named one of the \"50 Most Beautiful People In The World\" By People Magazine.\n\nIn 2000, the same magazine named him the \"Sexiest Rock Star.\"\n\nAlso in 2000 VH1 placed him on its \"100 Sexiest Artists.\"\n\nIn 2012 was ranked 50th in Billboard's magazine's \"Power 100,\" a ranking of \"The Most Powerful and Influential People In The Music Business.\"\n\n-In 2012, Hit Parader ranked Bon Jovi 31st in the \"Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists.\"\n\nPhilanthropy: In addition, Bon Jovi was the one of the founders and majority owners of the Arena Football League team Philadelphia Soul. He is the founder of The Jon Bon Jovi Soul Foundation which was founded in 2006 and exists to combat issues that force families and individuals into economic despair. He also campaigned for Al Gore in the 2000 Presidential election, John Kerry in the 2004 Presidential election, and Barack Obama in the 2008 Presidential election. In 2010, President Barack Obama named Bon Jovi to the White House Council for Community Solutions. He was also awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities from Monmouth University in 2001.\n\nJohn Joseph Travolta was born in Englewood, New Jersey, one of six children of Helen Travolta (née Helen Cecilia Burke) and Salvatore/Samuel J. Travolta. His father was of Italian descent and his mother was of Irish ancestry. His father owned a tire repair shop called Travolta Tires in Hillsdale, NJ. Travolta started acting appearing in a local production of \"Who'll Save the Plowboy?\". His mother, herself an actress and dancer, enrolled him in a drama school in New York, where he studied voice, dancing and acting. He decided to combine all three of these skills and become a musical comedy performer. At 16 he landed his first professional job in a summer stock production of the musical \"Bye Bye Birdie\". He quit school at 16 and moved to New York, and worked regularly in summer stock and on television commercials. When work became scarce in New York, he went to Hollywood and appeared in minor roles in several series. A role in the national touring company of the hit 1950s musical \"Grease\" brought him back to New York. An opening in the New York production of \"Grease\" gave him his first Broadway role at age 18. After \"Grease\", he became a member of the company of the Broadway show \"Over Here\", which starred The Andrews Sisters. After ten months in \"Over Here\", he decided to try Hollywood once again. Once back in Hollywood, he had little trouble getting roles in numerous television shows. He was seen on Neu im Einsatz (1972), Notruf California (1972) and Medical Center (1969) and also made a movie, Nachts, wenn die Leichen schreien (1975), which was shot in New Mexico. The day he returned to Hollywood from New Mexico, he was called to an audition for a new situation comedy series ABC was planning to produce called Welcome Back, Kotter (1975). He got the part of Vinnie Barbarino and the series went on the air during the 1975 fall season.\n\nHe starred in a number of monumental films, earning his first Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for his role in the blockbuster Nur Samstag Nacht (1977), which launched the disco phenomenon in the 1970s. He went on to star in the big-screen version of the long-running musical Grease (1978) and the wildly successful Urban Cowboy (1980), which also influenced trends in popular culture. Additional film credits include the Brian De Palma thrillers Carrie: Des Satans jüngste Tochter (1976) and Blow Out - Der Tod löscht alle Spuren (1981), as well as Amy Heckerling's hit comedy Kuck' mal wer da spricht! (1989) and Nora Ephron's comic hit Michael (1996).

John was most recently seen in Killing Season (2013), co-starring Robert De Niro, and directed by Mark Steven Johnson. John recently completed production on the Boston-based film, Der Auftrag - Für einen letzten Coup ist es nie zu spät! (2014), alongside Academy Award winner Christopher Plummer and Critic's Choice nominee Tye Sheridan. John plays a second-generation petty thief who arranges to get out of prison to spend time with his ailing son (Sheridan) by taking on a job with his father (Plummer) to pay back the syndicate that arranged his release. John has received 2 prestigious aviation awards: in 2003, the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Foundation Award for Excellence for his efforts to promote commercial flying, and, in 2007, The Living Legends Ambassador of Aviation award.\n\nJohn holds 11 jet licenses: 747, 707, Gulfstream II, Lear 24, Hawker 1251A, Eclipse Jet, Vampire Jet, Canadair CL-141 Jet, Soko Jet, Citation ISP and Challenger.

She was of Carpatho-Rusyn descent. Her mother envisioned a show business career for her daughter and would often lie about her age in order to get Sandy where she wanted to go. For example, her mother enrolled her in school early so she could have a head start. Sandy was only four years old when she entered the second grade. Sandra was an extremely pretty young lady, which enabled her to get into modeling. In fact, she was already very successful at her craft by the time she was 12 years old. This in turn led to television commercials for local companies, an added benefit for the young model.\n\nThrough her mother's prodding and the talent scouts, Sandra was signed to do a movie when she was 14 called Land ohne Männer (1957), released in 1957. While the film didn't exactly top the charts, it would lay the foundation for Sandra's career. The new young actress was then signed to two more films for 1958, Was weiß Mama von Liebe? (1958) and Zu jung (1958), both with a young actor, John Saxon. In 1959, Sandra appeared in five productions with April entdeckt die Männer (1959) and Die Sommerinsel (1959) being the two most popular. Sandra was 17 years old and becoming the heartthrob of teenage boys all across America. In 1960, Sandra appeared in only one film, Das Geheimnis der Dame in Schwarz (1960), but is remembered by her for something else. She married teen idol Bobby Darin in December of that year. It may have sunk a few teen boys' hearts, but most still were enamored of her. Her work, once again, took off. The 1961 releases were Happy End im September (1961), Romanoff und Julia (1961), and as Tammy Tyree in Tammy Tell Me True (1961).\n\nSandra had replaced the ever-popular Debbie Reynolds in the \"Tammy\" series, but the film and its 1963 sequel, Sandra und der Doktor (1963), didn't do all that well at the box-office. The films were now slowing for Sandra. The last few that she made were So bändigt man Eva (1964), Das Schlafzimmer ist nebenan (1965), Willkommen, Mister B. (1966), Doktor - Sie machen Witze! (1967), and Rosie! (1967). By 1967, her marriage to Darin ended and so did her film career. There was little call for a teenage movie star to play daughters and such, when everyone knew that she was a divorcée. Plus, the face of movies had changed and sugary stories were not the ones that people wanted to see. Sandra did nail down the part of \"Nancy Wagner\" in 1970's Voodoo Child (1970).\n\nIn the 1970s, Dee made a few appearances in made-for-television movies, but it was the film Grease (1978) that made her famous to a new generation. While she was not in the film, one of the popular songs was \"Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee\".\n\nSandra's last silver screen role was in Lost (1983). She died of kidney complications on February 20, 2005.\n\nAn soft-spoken, unassuming lawyer of intellectual bent, Samuel Alito, Jr. has seldom called attention to himself. But in 2005, he became a flash-point of controversy with his nomination to the United States Supreme Court. An Italian-American, he was born and grew up in Trenton, New Jersey, the son of Samuel Alito, Sr., and Rose (nee' Fradusco) Alito. He grew up in a comfortable middle class family, where his father was Director of the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services and his mother was a school principal. Alito attended public schools and excelled academically while participating in several extracurricular activities. From high school, he attended Princeton University and graduated summa cum laude in 1972. Following graduation, he joined the U.S. Army Reserve, becoming a Second Lieutenant in the Signal Corps. He also was accepted at Yale Law School, where he was known for his intelligence and diligence, and he became editor of the Yale Law Journal, the school newspaper. There was much social turmoil going on at the time, but Alito avoided the controversy and concentrated on his studies. During his senior year, he lived in Italy, where his father was born, and wrote his thesis about the Italian criminal system. He graduated in 1975 and was expected to seek a well-paying job with a prominent law firm. But instead, he became a clerk for Leonard Garth, a respected judge on the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In 1977, he joined the U.S. Attorney's office. Starting out as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, where he made criminal appeals before for the U.S. Attorney. In 1981, he joined the U.S. Department of Justice, working as assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General. There argued some cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. In both positions, he became known for his thoroughness and deliberate presentation of cases. That and his conservative views caught the attention of many in Washington, D.C., and in 1985, he was hired to be Deputy Assistant to U.S. Attorney General Ed Meese, where he provide Constitutional advice to the department. That same year, he married Martha-Ann Bomgardner, a law librarian whom he had first met while doing research as a law clerk.\n\nIn 1987, Alito's profile was raised when he was appointed U.S. Attorney for the district of New Jersey. This was a demanding position, and Alito prosecuted many important cases involving organized crime and drug trafficking. In spite of his mild demeanor, Alito was a vigorous and effective prosecutor, motivated not only by his personal ethics and sense of responsibility, but his belief that the perpetrators of organized crime gave his fellow Italian-Americans a negative and unjust image. In that capacity, he won several important convictions and made an impact against several criminal enterprises. This brought him to the attention of President George Bush, and in 1990, he was nominated to the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Impressed by his record, the U.S. Senate confirmed him unanimously. The Court has long been dominated by liberal judges appointed by Presidents who were Democrats, and Alito's rulings were often in the minority on the Court. This frustrated him initially and he had a few outspoken dissents, but he quickly reverted to the low-key, careful approach which he had demonstrated during most of his career. He made a good impression on both his subordinates and his colleagues, including many liberal judges. He was compared by many to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, due to their similar views and backgrounds, and Alito became referred to as Scalito in some circles, which annoyed him immensely. But he remained highly respected in both conservative circles and the legal community and during the Bush's Presdidency, he had been occasionally mentioned as potential choice for the U.S. Supreme Court. He paid little attention to this speculation and concentrated on his rulings. Thought a few of his rulings were controversial, he always made sure they were written with what he saw as adherence to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 2005, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor announced that she would be retiring from the Court. This drew national attention, as the court was closely divided on several important issues and O'Connor had been the deciding judge in most of them. Alito was interviewed by President George W. Bush and made a good impression, but Bush instead chose John Roberts of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Before confirmation hearings could begin, the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, William Rehnquist, died, and there were two vacancies. Roberts was quickly nominated to Rehnquest's position as Chief Justice. After much speculation, Bush unexpectedly chose White House Counsel Harriet Miers for the O'Connor vacancy. However, Meiers withdrew her confirmation after much criticism. At that point, Alito was asked by Bush to serve on the Court, and Alito accepted. In spite of Alito's high regard in the legal community, his nomination was controversial. Democratic Senators and many liberal advocacy groups attacked Alito, calling him a right-winger and charging that he would change the ideological composition of the Supreme Court for the worse. During confirmation hearings, Alito was questioned aggressively by Democratic Senators. Alito testified calmly and defended his record, while promising to be impartial and rule only on the basis of the Constitution. At one point, when Democratic Senators were questioning Alito on a club he had belonged to in college, his wife became frustrated and began to weep, and it made headlines and news coverage throughout the country. Alito looked like a dignified, reasonable jurist while his opponents looked both arrogant and buffoonish, and public opinion turned in his favor. Just before the Senate voted to confirm Alito, U.S. Senator John Kerry announced he would attempt a filibuster of Alito's nomination while he was on vacation in the Alps. This was widely ridiculed, and conservatives attacked Kerry as a wealthy dilettante. On January 31, 2006, Alito was confirmed by a vote of 58 to 42 in a vote that broke mostly along party lines.\n\nOn a Supreme Court closely divided between activist and textualist wings, Alito has voted with the textualists, of whom fellow justice Scalia is considered a leader.\n\n\"Two Ton\" Tony Galento, a stogie-smoking pugilist and bar-owner who claimed he trained on beer, hamburgers, and spaghetti, was one of the most colorful characters to ever contend for the heavyweight title.\n\nBorn Dominic Anthony Galento on March 12, 1910 in Orange, New Jersey, he earned his nickname after driving his ice truck to an arena, arriving just before the start of one of his fights. Spotting him in the parking lot, his manager asked him where he'd been.\n\n\"I had two tons of ice to deliver on my way here,\" Galento said. The greatest clown in boxing history had arrived.\n\nGalento, a dirty fighter who would deliberately head-butt, gouge, low-blow, and elbow his opponents, was one of the toughest men ever to box professionally. Defeating Lou Nova, Al Ettore, and Nathan Mann on his way to a shot at the heavyweight title, he was the most famous member of \"The Brown Bomber\" Joe Louis' \"Bum of the Month Club.\" The underdog Galento earned fistic immortality when he sent Louis to the canvas in the second round of their title bout. Louis admitted that he might have been the toughest man he ever met in the ring.\n\nBlessed with a lethal left hook, a roundhouse punch that could stagger the world's best boxers, Galento began his climb up the heavyweight division in 1928, a time when pro fighters fought almost every month. He was notorious for his street-fighting style that flouted the rules and often led to fouls. But it was as a clown that Galento would achieve immortality, and it was a style he perfected early on.\n\nOn one night in Detroit in 1931, Tony took on three opponents and K.O.ed them all, drinking beer between rounds. Ten minutes before a 1932 fight with Arthur DeKuh, he took on a $10 bet that he could consume 50 hot dogs. He won the bet, and then the fight in four rounds.\n\nThe 5-foot-9 brawler, who sported a fighting weight of 235 to 240 lbs., resembled an ambulatory beer barrel, according to one sports reporter. A bar-owner, Tony made much of his lack of training, which might consist of him posing for photographers quaffing down a brew at his bar, or wrestling with a rubber car tire suspended from a tree that had been a child's swing before Tony picked it as a sparring partner. Tony was a fat clown, and proud of it.\n\n\"Nobody really liked him except maybe the guys who hung out in his saloon,\" his corner man, Ray Arcel, admitted . \"He was a crude guy, to put it mildly, who would resort to all sorts of foul tactics to win a fight.\"\n\nJoe Louis, who eventually became friends with him, said that he hated the uncouth Galento because of his insults and race baiting, a crude psychology that Two-Ton Tony used to unsettle the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. Tony was interviewed by a reporter before his title fight with Louis:\n\nReporter: Tony, what do you think your chances are against Joe Louis? Galento: Joe who? Reporter: Joe Louis. Galento: I never hoid of da bum.\n\nWhile the Galento persona was popular among the people and helped hype the fight, Louis was offended by the lack of respect. The Champ, a fighter who hated clowning in the ring, had his pride further bruised in the second round, when Tony sent him to the canvass for a two-count. The crowd and press were stunned.\n\nGalento got his shot at Louis' title before 30,000 fans in Yankee Stadium on June 28, 1939. Before the fight, the six-to-one underdog baited the Brown Bomber, telephoning the Louis household and insulting Joe and his family, using racial epithets. Galento even made a sexual innuendo about Louis' wife during the pre-fight introductions, which caused the normally calm Louis to lose his composure.\n\n\"He got to me, and I hated him for it,\" Louis remembered. \"I never hated anybody before. I decided to punish him before I knocked him out. I wanted it to go into later rounds, but he kept calling me dirty names during the fight. So I ended it.\"\n\nGalento, who out-weighed Louis by 33 pounds, started the fight by bullying the discomfited World's Heavyweight Champion in the first round, almost sending him to the canvas with a left hook. At the end of the round, Louis was wobbly when he returned to his corner. In the second, Joe was staggered again, but he rallied late in the round and knocked Galento down, the first time Two-Ton had hit the canvass in his pro career.\n\nAfter Galento got up, The Champ started connecting with jabs, but seemingly out of nowhere, Tony launched his lethal left hook and it was Louis' turn to hit the canvass. Though Joe got up at the count of two, his legs were wobbly. But Galento could not finish Louis off. Two-Ton Tony's time of fistic immortality was over.\n\nBy the fourth, the six foot, two-inch Louis began using Galento's head as a speed bag. The fight was stopped by the referee at 2:29 of the round with Two-Ton Tony on the ropes. The next day, newspapers quoted Galento putting down Joe Louis:\n\n\"He's not as good as they rate him. He can't take a punch. I would have won. He pushed me and I went down. They shouldn't have stopped the fight.\"\n\nTwo-Ton Tony had required 23 stitches to stop the bleeding.\n\nGalento's career went downhill after reaching the pinnacle against the great Joe Louis. Though he went on to manhandle Lou Nova, the Baer brothers, Max and Buddy, beat him up badly in two fights. Like Louis, the normally easy-going Max, the only Jewish heavyweight champ in history, wound up hating Two-Ton Tony. Max claimed he enjoyed beating the stuffing out of Galento more than he did winning the heavyweight title back in 1934.\n\nAfter Max's brother, the six-foot, six-inch Buddy, badly beat Tony in a 1941 fight, Galento decided to try another way to make a living. As a wrestling referee, he often wound up wrasslin' with his wrestlers before an appreciative crowd. He returned to the ring in 1943, but quit after he K.O.ed Jack Suzek in 1944.\n\nIt was time to hang up the gloves, tie on the white apron, and retire to his New Jersey bar, which served as headquarters for his joke campaign as the Prohibition Party candidate for president. He appeared with fellow Bum of the Month club members Tami Mauriello and Abe Simon in the classic movie \"On the Waterfront,\" tried stand-up comedy, and appeared on TV with Joe Louis, commenting on their title fight. He even became friends with the Brown Bomber.\n\nJoe Louis learned to like the crude clown. He had charisma, Louis said. His problem was that he had been born out of his time. Tony should have been a bare-knuckle fighter, as \"The man was absolutely fearless.\"\n\nTwo-Ton Tony Galento died on July 22, 1979 from complications of diabetes. His crudity as a boxer was balanced out by his happy-go-lucky demeanor outside the ring which made him a beloved figure to locals and those fans who still remembered the pre-war days of heavyweight boxing."
