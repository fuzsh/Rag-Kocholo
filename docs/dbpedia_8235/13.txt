Mary L. DeRose, 104, passed away on Wednesday, April 10, 2024, at home. Born June 21, 1919, to August and Carlotta Monforte on Syracuse’s North side, she grew up on the South Side.

She was the last person in our family from the Greatest Generation. Mary was a housewife, amazing cook and excellent baker. She provided a loving home life for her family and was surrounded by four generations. Her holiday meals were legendary. Mary enjoyed the many tours she went on with her husband to Europe and elsewhere. Mary also enjoyed golfing at Bellevue C.C. and was an avid reader. She was truly a remarkable woman whose light can’t be replaced and will be sorely missed by family and friends.

Mary is survived by her sons, Ralph and Thomas, grandsons, Joseph B. (Danyelle) and Jason (Cyndi) and great-grandchildren, Jaegur, Gabriella and Isabella, along with many nieces and nephews.

Funeral services will be held on Monday, April 15, 2024 at 10:30am at St. Michael’s St. Peter’s Church, 4782 W Seneca Turnpike. A calling hour will be held from 9:30am to 10:30am prior to mass at church. Burial will be in Valley Cemetery.

In lieu of flowers donations in her memory can be made to St. Joseph’s Hospital; 973 James St, Suite 250, Syracuse, NY 13203.
