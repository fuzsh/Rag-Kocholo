Out-going Chair of Trustees, Sir Richard Heaton KCB, has proudly announced that Southwark’s newest almshouse will be called Appleby Blue in recognition one of the charity’s earliest benefactors, Dorothy Appleby, and in a nod to Bermondsey Blue.

The Charity hosted a site launch event today in Southwark Park Road to officially announce the start of construction of the new 57 home almshouse which will be completed by the end of 2021. Located in the heart of Bermondsey, the new almshouse will provide modern, independent sheltered housing fit for the 21st Century with beautiful indoor and outdoor spaces for use by the whole community. The building will be a benchmark in the way society considers sheltered housing, from both the innovative design and quality of the build, to the way it supports the quality of life of those who make it their home.

Appleby Blue is being developed by JTRE London, the UK branch of one of central Europe’s leading property developers, which shares the Charity’s desire for exceptional housing.

Martyn Craddock, CEO of United St Saviour’s, said: “The launch of Appleby Blue is a hugely exciting day for us, marking the beginning of an important new chapter in our history which has been years in the planning. Our aim is to provide exceptional housing for Southwark’s older people and to demonstrate the positive contribution that older people bring to the community and place they live. It is a true legacy for future generations and we are incredibly proud of it.”
