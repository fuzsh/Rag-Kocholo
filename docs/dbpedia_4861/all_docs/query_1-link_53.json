He was a loving husband, father, grandfather and friend. Born in a rural farming community near Boaz, Alabama in 1931, he was the eldest child of Elbert\" Floyd Dyar and Agnes Gerstman. For the family of ten children, especially in the height of the Depression, life was difficult. Large families were all but a must to produce enough on the farm for survival. After managing to finish Mount Hebron elementary school and Douglas High School by making up farm labor absent class, the day of decision was at hand. Should he stay on the farm to help provide for the large family or better serve by pursuing an education? The decision was made to enroll in Snead Jr. College in Boaz on a full workship to pay for all expenses, due to the gracious kindness of then president, Dr. F.M. Cook. After five quarters and a near A average (and no money) Floyd applied for admission to University of Alabama School of Dentistry. A Trailway bus ride to meet with Dr. Joseph Volker, Dean, and his admissions committee yielded a conditional fall admission, after classes in the summer at Howard College (even through his Biology professor at Snead said he was crazy to apply). Dr. F.M. Cook drove him to Birmingham to meet with Roscoe Whatley, Director of the Birmingham Regional Red Cross. There he secured a job manning the blood bank nights and weekends, which provided a room and a stipend to cover school expenses. Upon graduation from Dental School with honors, Floyd competed for and received an academic internship (one of thirty in the nation). There were nine training hospitals in the U.S., and recipients could list their priorities, 1 through 9. He selected New Orleans first and Seattle, last. He was sent to Seattle. The hand of providence was in action, however, for that's where he met his future sweet wife of 54 years. After the one-year internship in Seattle, he was transferred to the Coast Guard base in San Fransico for six months, then to the Coast Guard Air Base in Port Angeles, Washington. After Port Angeles, he was transferred to the U.S. Health, Education and Welfare regional office in Charlottesville, Virginia. In 1958, he and Betty were blessed with the birth of \"John\" Floyd Dyar, Jr. In the summer of 1959, the three made their home in Center Point, Alabama, where he established his dental practice. The following year, their daughter, Susan Strickland Dyar, was born. Dr. Dyar felt so blessed and was so proud of his sweet, kind, compassionate and Christian wife and two wonderful children. He was also blessed with 45 years in dental practice in Center Point and was so spiritually rewarded to be able to relieve pain and improve appearances for so many. He loved his patients, and they loved him. His beloved first grandchild, Danielle Elizabeth Dyar, born in 1987, and brought him unimaginable joy. In 1996, his grandson, Michael Gregory Parris, Jr. was born, bringing more joy. Fifteen months later, his third grandchild, Megan Marie Parris, came into his life and blessed him immensely. The last years of his wife Betty's life were fraught with declining health issues. Diabetic complications and inoperable knee and hip problems left her wheelchair-bound and eventually entirely bedridden. Dr. Dyar would retire from his dental practice in 2003 to become her full-time, loving and compassionate caregiver. He prayed to his Savior, that if possible, he would outlive her and be healthy enough to care for her with love and compassion. That this was allowed was such a joy and relief and blessing. Dr. Dyar was predeceased by his parents, his brothers Franklin D. Dyar and Bobby Jack Dyar, and his precious wife Betty Dyar.

It brings a smile to our hearts that, knowing we would eventually have to face this sad day, he wanted to leave his preparedness here for us in his stead.
