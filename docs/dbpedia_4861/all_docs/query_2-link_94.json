        "text": "This is an open letter to the NHS chief executives and chief nursing officers of the four UK nations, as well as relevant ministers, calling for the reinstatement of language that uses the word “woman” in NHS communications about women’s health.\n\nPlease sign our letter to NHS chiefs – all are welcome to sign:\n\nTo: Chief Executives for NHS England, NHS Scotland, NHS Wales, and Health and Social Care, Northern Ireland: Amanda Pritchard, Caroline Lamb, Judith Paget and Peter May\n\nand, Chief Nursing Officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland: Dame Ruth May, Alex McMahon, Sue Tranka and Maria McIlgorm.\n\nRe: The importance of the word “woman” in communication about women’s health\n\nThe Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender is a multidisciplinary group of clinicians concerned about changes to the NHS.UK website which have removed accurate and respectful terminology about women’s health.\n\nThe current removal of the language of women in healthcare communication harms women and undermines health outcomes. Removal of sex-based language is discriminatory and could leave the NHS open to legal challenge. Full impact assessments should have been done before any changes to communications.\n\nWe call for the reinstatement of sex-based, respectful communication that meets the healthcare needs of women. Specifically, the NHS must use women’s words for women’s bodies and women’s health problems.\n\nWe detail our concerns below:\n\nWe submitted Freedom of Information (FOI) requests to NHS Digital which is responsible for the health information content on the NHS.UK website.\n\nThe responses (found here, and here) confirmed that NHS Digital had taken the decision to remove the words ‘woman’ and ‘women’ from information on women’s health issues, in particular cancers affecting women.\n\n1. Our FOIs indicate that this is an ongoing explicit strategy that has taken place:\n\na. without public consultation,\n\nb. without an independent legal opinion regarding its acceptability under the Equality Act 2010 (discrimination on the basis of sex),\n\nc. without an equality impact assessment,\n\nd. without any comprehensive analysis of the likely impact on women’s health, awareness, access to treatment, health outcomes or trust in the NHS,\n\ne. without particular attention to the women who are most likely to be disadvantaged and excluded from their own health literature,\n\nf. without consideration of how women feel.\n\n2. In the FOI response, NHS Digital informed us that it had no recorded information which sets out the “guidance/evidence/rationale to support the removal/reduction of reference to woman/women”.\n\nNHS Digital itself therefore acknowledges that there is no documented evidence base for their actions.\n\n3. NHS communication exists to promote and support the health and wellbeing of the UK population, of which over half are women. It is already well known:\n\na. that there is a health literacy crisis that directly impacts on people’s health. In the UK 7.1 million adults read and write at or below the level of nine-year-olds, and critically, 43% of adults already do not understand written health information.”\n\nb. Clinicians are therefore trained not to use jargon and instead use language that enables complex medical information to be communicated so that women can be best informed and most optimally engage about their own health so they can make proper decisions.\n\nc. This necessitates clear simple messaging to ensure health literature correctly targets the female population it is designed for; women must recognise the information targeted at them.\n\nd. It should be easy to understand (in particular, the NHS guide to inclusive language stipulates to include sex when relevant in health information).\n\n4. If sex is omitted, female patients may not fully understand that the literature relates to them or their own clinical risks.\n\nThis then influences whether they will seek further advice or access to necessary clinical care. This jeopardises women’s health.\n\n5. Clear, unambiguous healthcare messaging that targets women is life-saving\n\ne.g. cancer where symptoms can be ambiguous. Early recognition and presentation by women is essential for survival, reduces morbidity, burden of treatment and lowers NHS costs. Using cervical cancer as a worked example, previous research suggests 40% of women do not know they have a cervix and 21% of women over 50 don’t know that screening reduces risk of cervical cancer. Women’s awareness and uptake of cervical screening has been on the wane.\n\nDespite this, NHS.UK has removed clear sex based language to support women’s health for cervical cancer and in other women only conditions, but not for men’s health.\n\n6. Disparity between NHS.UK health information offered to men and women is unjustified discrimination.\n\nIt results in lower quality, less effective health information communicated to women.\n\nThe only cancer affecting men specifically where the word “men” was removed was the updated section on penile cancer. Of all the forms of cancer affecting men, penile cancer is the least likely to cause confusion about whom or what part of the body it is affecting.\n\nTherefore the risk that men might misunderstand the information is minimal. In the far more common male cancers words for men have not been removed.\n\n7. For instance, the pages on the main male reproductive system cancers prostate and testicular – use the word ‘men’ liberally and support videos to ensure clarity of message and targeting of the correct patient population.\n\nFor example the video on prostate cancer says: “Prostate cancer is the commonest cancer in men in the UK“. In contrast, the pages on the three main gynaecological cancers – cervical, uterine, ovarian – have virtually eliminated the words ‘woman’ and ’women’ and there are no corresponding videos. Similarly, many of the pages on pregnancy and miscarriage have replaced the words ‘woman’ and ‘women’, with ‘you’, ‘people’ or ‘person’.\n\nIt is important that this high quality healthcare messaging for men remains and is safeguarded. We reference the discrepancies to demonstrate that this is an ideological decision, which has no place in health care communication. This ideological approach seems to have blinkered those responsible from looking at this from an evidence base, or from considering the possible harmful impact on women.\n\n8. This is in direct conflict with the Women’s Health Strategy for England,\n\nwhich states:\n\n“Language matters. Concern has been raised about removing language around biological sex and women – for example, referring to ‘pregnant people’. Such an approach has the potential for unintended adverse health consequences. The government has been clear that we must not countenance the erasure of women from our public discourse or our legislation.\n\nWe will work with NHS bodies to ensure that women are properly represented in communications and guidance, and that there is appropriate use of sex-specific language to communicate matters that relate to women’s and men’s individual health issues, and their different biological needs.”\n\n9. The new language excludes and discriminates against women protected under the Equality Act (2010)\n\ne.g. those with a learning disability and those whose first language is not English, who were previously likely to recognise the word ‘women’ and that the health literature as relating to them, but not the new iteration of ‘anyone with a cervix’.\n\n10. Importantly, this renders women’s health literature inaccurate and confusing\n\nFor example, 9 out of 10 of the symptoms listed on the symptoms page for Ovarian Cancer could occur in both men and women. The reframing of language excludes some affected women from the conditions discussed. For example, women who have had oophorectomies due to ovarian cancer remain affected by the disease but are no longer included by a phrase like ‘anyone with ovaries’. This studious avoidance of reference to women, even in relation to getting pregnant, leads to healthcare content that is nonsensical to the public. For example, “If you are under 40 and have regular sex without using contraception, there is an 8 in 10 chance you will get pregnant within 1 year” by definition includes men in the potential for pregnancy.\n\nFurther discussion about the adverse consequences of this removal of women’s words in relation to pregnancy and motherhood can be found here.\n\n11. The obfuscation and erasure of language around women and girls appears to be part of a wider pattern across the NHS.UK website\n\nIt affects other women-specific health issues such as menopause and menstruation.\n\n12. Notably, items updated since around the latter half of 2021 usually have little or no mention of ‘woman’ or ‘women’, whereas those from before that time often do\n\nFor instance, information such as Period Pain, Stopped or Missed Periods and Premenstrual Syndrome (all last reviewed prior to late 2021) use the words women and girls repeatedly. However, the page Heavy Periods (reviewed November 2021) fails to mention women and girls at all. Similarly, Early Menopause (reviewed February 2021) uses the word ‘women’ several times, whereas Menopause (reviewed May 2022) uses not a single instance of ‘women’ anywhere in the overview or symptoms sections.\n\n13. NHS.UK healthcare messaging shows a lack of concern for women, is disrespectful and insults women\n\nImportantly, it is considered misogynistic by many. It negates the pivotal role of communication in improving women’s health and undermines trust in the NHS. Language such as ‘people with a vagina’ is dehumanising and reduces women and girls to body parts, such as genitalia. Given many women already feel ashamed about their bodies, such messaging perpetuates such negative attitudes.\n\nInclusivity\n\n14. The FOIs submitted to NHS Digital highlight that the recent changes in language stem from a desire to be “inclusive”\n\nThis has taken precedence over integrity, evidence based care and clarity of communication.\n\n15. In reality, NHS Digital’s stated strategy for inclusivity has resulted in the active exclusion of women and girls from literature about their own healthcare.\n\nWords denoting women (the female sex in humans) in articles about their sex related conditions are already inclusive and should be central to respectful, accurate and patient centred healthcare messaging. For information targeted towards female patients, the NHS must be sensitive to what women need to know, what specifically applies to them, how to make such information most readily understood, and be respectful.\n\n16. Historically, women’s health care needs have been neglected by the scientific and medical professions; female anatomy, physiology and health conditions are still under-researched due to a pervasive bias of the male-as-default\n\nThis is now recognised and efforts are being made to remedy this historic imbalance to improve medical knowledge relating to the female body and women’s health outcomes. When the NHS obscures the language of women in health care communications this only serves to undo recent attempts to recognise the importance of knowledge and understanding of women’s specific health care needs, in order to improve health outcomes for women.\n\n17. Trusted sources of health information such as the NHS must support health literacy, understanding and patient confidence, not undermine them\n\nThe value and purpose of the NHS.UK website is so the public can access useful, scientifically accurate and clear health information. Health care professionals wish to signpost their patients to helpful materials, and need to be confident in the quality of those materials.\n\nWomen and men have distinct health care issues and needs. How can women trust a health service that renders women nameless and instead defines women as individual body parts?\n\nIn the FOI response, NHS Digital said it planned to make further changes to language about women’s and men’s health care issues as part of its work to improve its content.\n\nWe call for a full reinstatement of sex-specific language to communicate to women about their health care issues, across all NHS communications. We’ve invited those who share our concerns to sign this open letter too.\n\nThe NHS must use women’s words for women’s bodies and women’s health problems, and reverse the well-meaning but obfuscating and insulting changes to NHS.UK over recent years.\n\nFor any future changes we request you do full equality impact assessments, with proper consideration of consequential harms.\n\nWe would appreciate the chance to discuss our concerns with you. To arrange a meeting with representatives of the signatories, please email the Clinical Advisory Network on Sex and Gender at contact.cansg@gmail.com\n\nSigned,\n\nSinead Helyar, Nurse, NHS,
