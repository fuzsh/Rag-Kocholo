        "text": "Bill Appleby\n\nAugust 6, 1950 - September 17, 2007\n\nMy brother fought 10 long years of lymphoma before it finally took him. He suffered quite a bit during the last year. At least now he can be at peace  Terry Appleby 74\n\nScott Bankston\n\nJune 4, 1950 - October 21, 2011\n\nShortly after graduating from high school, Scott spent 3-4 years as a laborer in the construction industry and joined the Laborers Union. Scott was a strong believer in the Union he was part of. After his time spent as a laborer, in approximately 1978 Scott joined the Operating Engineers Union. While a member of this union Scott performed jobs like driving tractors, paving roads, and preparing land in different areas around San Diego in order that schools, homes and bridges could be built. Scott enjoyed his work in this capacity but he wanted more. Scott decided to go back to school. Scott attended San Diego State University and received a Bachelors Degree in Liberal Arts Psychology on May 28, 1998. Continuing his education for the next two years, he then received his Masters of Science Degree in Rehabilitative Counseling on May 31, 2000 and would pursue a future career in Psychology with an emphasis on brain injury. For the last ten years, Scott has worked with brain injury students for the San Diego Community College District. In this capacity he provided Drug and Alcohol Counseling and Anger Management Counseling. His most recent position was to assist brain injury patients in pursuance of a career. He would provide them with tools necessary to assist them in achieving their career goals. He provided teaching, counseling, advising, and he was passionate about leading and inspiring his students to attain their goals. Over the last six months, Scott's health started to decline. Even though there were health issues, his passing was unexpected.\n\nRoseanne Baskin Birney\n\nGreg Bear\n\nAugust 20, 1951 - November 20, 2022\n\nGreg Bear, a San Diego native who wrote such highly acclaimed and plausible science fiction novels as Blood Music, Darwins Radio and Eon and who helped create San Diego Comic-Con, died following a stroke after complications during heart surgery, according to the Science Fiction & Fantasy Writers Association, or SFWA. He served as the groups president from 1988 to 1990.\n\nLaurie Brickey Adamonis\n\nSeptember 5, 1950 - June 19, 2013\n\nLaurie was a third generation \"Brickey\", born in San Diego to the late Purl and Marjorie Brickey. In 1981 she moved to St George, Utah. She moved back to San Diego in 1987 where she went to work for the La Mesa Police Department as a dispatcher. In 2008 Laurie was diagnosed with Multiple Myeloma, which forced her to retire early. Laurie loved music and was an accomplished singer. She loved singing karaoke with her many karaoke friends, and spending time with her friends from La Mesa Police Department. She was predeceased by her daughter Janelle and survived by her husband Joseph of Santee, and brothers Wayne 62 and James 66 of St George and many nieces and nephews.\n\nSharon Brown Garrison\n\nAugust 31, 1950 - June 5, 2004\n\nSharon passed away from pancreatic cancer. She had three surviving children. We lived in San Diego until 1983, moved to the east coast for three years, then returned to the San Francisco Bay area. Sharon loved sewing, crafting, selling her designs at craft shows and traveling. We retired in 2002 and moved to Bozeman, Montana. -- Steve Garrison\n\nBeverly Butcher\n\nAugust 27, 1950 - March 1986\n\nBeverly was the keyboard player in our high school all girls band. Ramona Najimy was on drums and Laura Weiss played the flute. I handled the mike, bass guitar and tambourine. We made LOTS of noise in various garages  a groups gotta practice, you know -- and actually had some gigs. I remember a Honeywell company picnic and a Lebanese ethnic thingie that Ramona got for us. Beverly was a quiet person in real life, but a ROCKER while in the band. We did a lot of Rolling Stones, Janis Joplin, and the Beatles You get the idea -- really 60s. Beverly, you were cool. I wish I would've stayed in touch. -- Irma A. Groot 68\n\nGary Camren\n\n(No photo in yearbook)\n\nMy ex-husband died December 4, 2010 of heart disease and other problems. He lived on the golf course at San Diego Country Estates in Ramona and died at my home in Crest. He attended Crawford in 1966 and 1967, and Horace Mann before that. He transferred to San Diego High School his senior year. He did not like having his picture taken, even though he looked very much like Ricky Nelson. He was an avid fan of race car driver Jimmie Johnson, who used to swim in our pool with our sons when he was younger. Gary was a pipe fitter and plumber with Local 230 for over 35 years -- Bev Judd Camren 69\n\nGary Clarkson\n\n(No photo in yearbook)\n\nJune 28, 1949  April 25, 2008\n\nI was informed of Garys passing by his ex-wife. We were friends since junior high but were not able to get together much in these past several years. He was a fellow Marine and saw duty in Vietnam -- Bill Grantham\n\nKaren Sue Cochran-Reynolds\n\nMarch 3, 1950-August 9, 2004\n\nWe lost Karen Monday from a short battle with cancer at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego.

MacLaughlin of Pinehurst, NC.; aunt Vangie of Houston, Texas, and sister Kathy Lee of Phoenix, Ariz. She is also survived by her loving animals Charlotte, Nellie, Tucker, and Cindy. She was predeceased by her father Hugh Cochran, and stepmother Alice ( ? ). Karen was an RN at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego. She also spent much of her time volunteering her time and skills to the American Red Cross of San Diego. Not only was she a wonderful asset to the community she was a great friend and family member. Karen was a special person who touched many lives from lost animals to patients battling heart failure. She was a unique, vivacious, and wonderful human being. She touched all of our lives.\n\nRaymond Colangelo\n\nAugust 31, 1950  October 30, 2009\n\nLee passed away after a courageous battle with cancer, with his family at his side. He was born in San Diego at Mercy Hospital, and graduated from San Diego State University. An avid outdoorsman, Lee loved his many years working with animals at the Zoo and Wild Animal Park. A celebration of his life was held by friends and family.\n\nMary Coleman Evans Marquardt\n\nAugust 2, 1950 - August 25, 2006\n\n\"A head-on collision on state Route 371 killed three San Diego County residents and injured a fourth yesterday, the California Highway Patrol said. Travis M. Josephson, 36, and Mary Marquardt, 56, both of El Cajon, and Edward R. Coleman, 80, of San Diego, died, the Riverside County Coroner's Office said. The collision occurred at 2:45 p.m. on Route 371 east of Lake Riverside Drive, about six miles west of Anza. CHP Officer Ron Thatcher said Josephson was driving west when he lost control of the Hyundai Accent on a curve. The car crossed double-yellow lines into the eastbound lane, where it collided with a Subaru Legacy. Josephson died at the scene. The Subaru driver, Sheridan Marquardt Jr., 58, of El Cajon was hospitalized with moderate injuries. Mary Marquardt and Coleman, both passengers in the Subaru, were flown to Desert Medical Center in Palm Springs, where they died of their injuries, Thatcher said.\" -- San Diego Union-Tribune, August 26, 2006\n\nKevin DeCosta\n\nJune 19, 1950 - February 8, 2013\n\nKevin was born in San Diego and died in Carlsbad. His Mom was a dance instructor and Kevin learned to tap and jazz dance, performing at Russ Auditorium at City College. Much more effective was his Dad immersing him in the waters of Mission Bayhe water skied at 7 and was a lifelong bodysurfer and boogie boarder. Kevin was also a Boy Scout and developed a love for camping and the great outdoors. Kevin attended Grossmont College and SDSU where, just a few credits short of his degree in accounting he decided he really didn't want to be an accountant and stepped into the grocery business full time. From the age of 15, until the late 1990s he worked for Gilo Mattera, first at Big Bear Market and later at the Market Place, Jonathan's and Harvest Ranch Market. At 22, he was the youngest store manager the chain ever promoted. Kevin developed a fine appreciation for wine. He was undoubtedly one of a very small percentage of folks with the ability to blind taste a wine and know its varietal pedigree, the region it was from and even the vintage. His palate was that well developed and it led to his eventual opening of the Del Mar Wine Co. and then Encinitas Wine.\n\nJames DeHart\n\nI remember talking to Jim De Hart a few days before he was killed in the plane crash at OHare Airport in Chicago, on May 25, 1979. We ran into each other in a grocery store in Point Loma and he was encouraging me to continue with my interviewing for the airlines. He was a flight attendant on an American Airlines DC-10 that had an engine drop off just after take off. -- Susan Weetman Belair '68\n\nJeannie Dendrinos Wolfarth\n\nOctober 25, 1950 - January 14, 2004\n\nA proud-to-be native of San Diego, Jeannie was born October 25, 1950. Her grandfather was a partner in the Seven Seas Locker Club downtown San Diego. Her mother worked at Food Basket on Fairmont and University Avenue for over twenty years. At Crawford, she was known as the \"Cher\" look alike. After high school, she attended Pacific College where she became proficient in medical transcription. Even though Jeannie was often in a great deal of pain, she did not complain nor want anyone to feel sorry for her. Therefore, her almost seven year bout with breast cancer was kept from most. Her husband Bruce quit his work and cared for his wife Jeannie during this period. It was not until the last week of Jeannie ' s life that San Diego Hospice stepped into the picture. Jeannie died peacefully January 14, 2004 at her home in Singing Hills. Close friends, family, her animals, and the wonderful San Diego Hospice staff were present at her passing. Jeannie would want everyone to celebrate her life as she knew it. Committing herself to God, healthy food and exercise, love of San Diego, family, friend and her animals were Jeannie ' s fingerprints on life. We will miss her beyond imagination.\n\nDavid Denlinger\n\n(No photo in yearbook)\n\nGiovanna DeSanti Hauser\n\nSeptember 1, 1950 - March 18, 2017\n\nMary Ellen Dudick Cagan\n\nFebruary 27, 1950 - April 11, 2001\n\nMy sister Ellie is deeply missed by her son, family and friends.

They traveled with us from San Diego to Texas were we lived for four years, and then back with us when we returned to San Diego. During our return to California, Liz alone in one rental truck with two cats in the front cab, the brakes and power steering gave out while heading down the long, steep grade into Sierra Blanca outside of El Paso. Somehow she found the strength to steer the runaway truck and bring it to a stop at the gas station at the bottom of the hill. Liz took all of this in stride, and the next morning, as the truck was repaired, she and her husband enjoyed a breakfast of Huevos Rancheros and went on their way.

She would often say after driving her Mini, I still got it. Like her passion for music, Liz carried her youthful zeal and panache throughout her life to the very end, living through its daily demands with grace, fortitude, and loyal perseverance to her values and love of God.
