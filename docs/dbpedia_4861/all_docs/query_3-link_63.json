It is the 53rd entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Stooges are incompetent yet sincere street cleaners. Upon discovering a discarded envelope containing oil bonds, they dutifully return it to its rightful owner, B.O. Davis. Grateful for their integrity, Davis offers them a reward of five thousand dollars on the condition that they locate an honest individual possessing executive capabilities.\n\nGuided by an upright canine, the Stooges encounter a distressed young woman who reveals that her beloved has been unjustly imprisoned. To facilitate communication with the incarcerated man, the Stooges devise a plan to intentionally land themselves in jail. Once incarcerated, they successfully locate the individual in question, Percy Pomeroy.\n\nEmploying resourcefulness, the Stooges modify their prison attire to resemble guard uniforms using black paint, enabling their escape. However, their freedom is short-lived as they inadvertently encounter Davis, who is revealed to be \"Lone Wolf\" Louie, a notorious bond swindler. Consequently, both Davis and the Stooges find themselves incarcerated once more.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nCredited\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction notes\n\n[edit]\n\nSo Long Mr. Chumps was filmed on July 25â€“30, 1940.[2] The film title is a parody of the film Goodbye, Mr. Chips.[3] The jail sequences were reused in Beer Barrel Polecats.[3]\n\nWhen the Stooges drop their iron balls that are chained to their legs, the sounds that are heard are again the NBC Chimes, a gag recycled from the team's 1937 short Back to the Woods.[3]\n\nBud Jamison appeared in a deleted scene where he was a policeman noticing the Stooges and Pomeroy's girlfriend.[3]\n\nIn the final scene, where Moe and Larry were breaking rocks over Curly's head, Larry picks up what seems to be a rather heavy rock. Curly notices the rock and replies, \"Hey, wait a minute! That's a real one! I'm no fool.\" Curly then chuckles, while Larry and Moe smile. Often regarded as an unscripted moment, it was later determined that exchange was scripted in advance, as it appeared in director Jules White's final shooting script.[1]\n\nBruce Bennett (aka Herman Brix, a former Olympic athlete and Tarzan actor) appears in dual roles as both a truck driver and as one of the guards giving orders to the Stooges.[1][3]\n\nLaurel and Hardy had painted their prison uniforms white in 1927's The Second Hundred Years. They were also trash collectors in 1939's A Chump at Oxford.[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
