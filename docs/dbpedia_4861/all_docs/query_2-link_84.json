Scabemic joeratbrp The caps, gowns, and hoods worn today in these Commencement Exer- cises are patterned after the attire of monks and. students in the Middle Ages. Those who have earned the bachelor's degree wear a gown and a semistiff yoke, long pleated front, intricate shirring across the shoulders and back, which is also distinguished by long, pointed sleeves. The holder of a master's degree wears a similar gown, with long or short oblong sleeves which hang down in the traditional manner and open at the wrist. Those possessing the doctor's degree wear gowns with broad velvet panels down the front and three velvet bars on the full, round, open sleeves. This velvet trimming may be either black or the color distinctive of the field of learning represented by the degree. Most of the colors and meanings of the costumes are found in the hoods. These are silk-lined with the color or colors of the institution conferring the degree. The border of the hood is velvet and its color signifies the field of learning to which the degree pertains. All those taking photographs of gradu- ates are asked to stand in space re- served on the left, facing the platform. (The Bryant Commencement honors certified graduates and degree candidates who have been scheduled to complete course work by May 21, 1976.)
