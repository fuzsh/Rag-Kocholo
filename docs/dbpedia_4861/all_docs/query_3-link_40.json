        "text": "The Developer Podcast celebrates its 100th episode with a special edition that sees author Caroyn Steel in conversation with guests Stephen Witherford, co-founder of Witherford Watson Mann architects and Sofia Craxton, food anthropologist and manager of the community kitchen at almshouse Appleby Blue.\n\nWhat follows is a passionate and emotive discussion about how we design spaces for dignity, and the building as the beginning of a conversation about how we live and what we value.\n\nAppleby Blue is a contemporary almshouse of older people’s social housing for United St Saviour’s Charity, named for one of its benefactors, Dorothy Appleby. Its 57 flats include 51 one-bedroom and 6 two-bedroom flats, with 11 of the homes being fully wheelchair accessible. The charity subsidises the rent, which is described on the website as being “well within Housing Benefit limits.”\n\nSteel describes the building as feeling \"like a luxury hotel, but this is supported housing.\"\n\nThe private charity’s new almshouse is now home to 63 residents. In a city where loneliness is one of the biggest killers, architect Witherford says the question was how to create an architecture that promotes the good life. While the movement of the sun, natural materials and a connection to nature were all considered important elements, part of the answer was to create spaces that “deinstitutionalise” the building through social interaction.\n\nThe traditional almshouse has been linked to greater longevity for residents, according to a study by the Bayers Business School, which analysed up to 100 years’ worth of residents’ records from a group of almshouses in England. The report found that almshouse living can boost longevity by years. Alison Benzimra, a co-author of the report, is head of research at United St Saviour’s Charity.\n\n“It is well known that, on average, the lower a person’s socioeconomic status, the lower their life expectancy. However, intriguingly, our research has found that this doesn’t have to be the case,” writes co-author Professor Ben Rickayzen, Professor of Actuarial Science at Bayes Business School.\n\n“We discovered that many almshouse residents receive a longevity boost when compared to their peers of the same socioeconomic status from the wider population. More research is needed to ascertain exactly what factors cause almshouse residents to have a longer life; however, we postulate that it is the sense of the community that is the most powerful ingredient.”"
