        "text": "PCGS Membership Memorial Tributes\n\nDorothy Jean (Brewer) Burchett Hopkins (1930-2023) Dorothy was a past member and dedicated genealogist who generously donated all of her research to us several years ago.\n\nDorothy Jean Burchett Hopkins was born June 27, 1930, in Phoenix, Arizona, one of four children of Carl and Bertha Brewer from Missouri. Dorothy died on July 28, 2023, at the age of 93 in Largo, Florida.\n\nDorothy's lifelong career was teaching. She earned her Associate Degree in Childhood Education at Southwest Baptist College in Bolivar, then her Bachelor's and Master's in Education at Southwest Missouri State in Springfield. She taught elementary school for 32 years, starting in Wheatland, and then in nearby communities of Bolivar, Pleasant Hope, and Springfield. She retired in 1989 and enjoyed time with her husband, Don, of 43 years before he passed at the age of 64 in 1991.\n\nHer students include the current Governor of Missouri and the retired President of Baker University in Kansas and hundreds of other good and successful citizens. She certainly made her mark in the lives of many. In her classroom, she was known to have \"the look\" that would wither bad actors in their tracks and dimples that would light up a whole room.\n\nDorothy was married to Donald Ray Burchett from 1948 to his passing in November 1991 and they produced an only child, Sherryl Kay. They had so many interests in common and spent vacations traveling to Courthouses and Cemeteries in Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, etc. while researching genealogy clues as a lifetime hobby. Dorothy loved Don's parents, Edna and Emmett, and enjoyed spending time with them. She cared for Edna after the deaths of Emmett and Don.\n\nIn addition to teaching and family, Dorothy enjoyed sewing, cooking, taking long walks, shopping, and traveling, and she loved each of her three successive schnauzers. Over the years, she augmented her income by buying and selling Real Estate, both professionally and personally.\n\nNot many widows get the opportunity of a second chance at love, but Dorothy married Rex Hopkins in 1996 in a Hawaiian wedding and were blessed with 21 happy years together. They were able to share so many experiences traveling by RV caravan through Canada, Alaska, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, and the Copper Canyon in Mexico. They lived half the year in Bolivar and the other half in their home in Tucson. Rex fit right into the family with his dry wit and kind ways.\n\nIn 2016, their health declined, and they moved to a residential care facility in Florida near Dorothy's daughter, Sherryl, and her family. Rex passed in 2017 at 96-1/2 (as he liked to say) and was returned to Bolivar for burial in his family plot.\n\nUpon her move to Florida, Dorothy donated many boxes of genealogy records to the Polk County\n\nGenealogical Society in Bolivar who in turn did a wonderful job of indexing the files and preserving them. These files covered a variety of family trees around the Cedar, Polk, and St. Clair counties in Missouri and also related records that were gathered in many other states. The PCGS honored Dorothy with a nice write-up about the scope of these invaluable boxes of information, which are now available for viewing and copying at their Bolivar location or ordering on its website.\n\nDorothy is survived by her daughter, Sherryl Kay Florko (Kenneth); her granddaughter, Crystal Dawn Jagodzinski (David) and her grandson, Paul Matthew Belden (Amy); four great-grandchildren, David Joshua Belden, Daniel James Belden, Sarah Elisabeth Belden and Piper Jane Jagodzinski; and one step-great-granddaughter, Savannah Marie Jagodzinski. She is also survived by Rex's daughter, Jo Hopkins (Judge Bill) of Bolivar; and in Arizona a niece, Brenda Lee Gaskill, and two nephews, Brent and Temple Brewer.\n\nDorothy was predeceased by her first husband, Donald Ray Burchett, and her second husband, Rex Lee Hopkins in Missouri; her beloved inlaws, Lucy Edna (Clayton) Burchett and Emmett Loren Burchett; her father, Carl Dewey Brewer; her mother, Bertha May (Wyant) Brewer; and her three siblings, C. Richard Brewer, Donnie Brewer, and Ruby Lowry all passed in Arizona.\n\nGathering and Service: 11:30 a.m. Saturday, Aug. 26 at First Baptist Church, Rose Building, 114 N. Springfield Ave., Bolivar. Luncheon afterward: 1 p.m. Saturday, hosted by the family at Smith's Restaurant, 1340 State Hwy U, Bolivar. Graveside: 3 p.m. Saturday at Alder Cemetery, Hwy M, ½ mile east of Junction of M and AA. Interment next to Donald, Emmett, and Edna Burchett.\n\nCondolences may be expressed online at obituaries.nationalcremation.com/obituaries. If desired, flowers may be ordered through The Flower Patch in Bolivar, or in lieu of flowers, a memorial donation may be made to First Baptist Church of Bolivar.\n\nJuanita Ann (Gile) Hobson (1946-2023)\n\nJuanita Ann Hobson, 76, known to many as GiGi, passed away unexpectedly on April 5th, 2023, at Cox Hospital. She leaves behind her husband of 60 years, Larry Hobson.\n\nJuanita was born on August 6th, 1946, in Polk County, Missouri to Dale and Louise Gile. She worked for several years at Dr. Crippins Chiropractic clinic in Bolivar, MO. Prior to that she managed at P.N. Hirsch (later becoming Dollar General) for 20+ years. She loved baseball, the Kansas City Chiefs, quilting, bowling, genealogy, her life on the farm, and spoiling her grandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n\nJuanita grew up working from a young age, which included helping raise her brothers, Bill, Roger, and Richard. She met Larry in her late teens while she was working at The Penguin in Bolivar, MO. They were married in July of 1962, which was the start of a 60+ year marriage.\n\nThat life started quickly with two strong-willed and vivacious daughters, Brenda and Pamela. The four of them enjoyed countless hours at the Hobson farm, lake days at Pomme de Terre, trail rides at Chadwick Motorcycle and ATV Use Area, and cross country trips to California for family visits and off-road riding in the Mojave desert. One of Juanitas favorite pastimes on the lake was watching Larry solum ski while she drove the boat. She also enjoyed weekends away with Cheech in their highly competitive bowling tournaments across the country.\n\nJuanita started her role as grandparent in 1984 with Anastasia, then soon after had Cheri, Kamron, and Tyler. She didnt stop there though, she became a grandma to several other children when they needed her, including Emily and Timothy Kirklin. In the second part of grand-parenting life, she also had Ana join the bunch. Her life became ballgames, camping trips, teaching the grandkids to sew, pitch a ball, bowling like a professional, and baking pies. She was a specialist on Grandparents Day at school, stepping in for any student who didnt have a grandparent to celebrate with. She was always there with open arms to be a grandma to anybody.\n\nAfter years of practice, she took on the title of great-grandma in 2005. This was also when she was upgraded to be GiGi. She gave even more love to Cash, Jackson, Juan, JB, Joyce, Brock, Teagan, and even more over the last 18 years. Her open arms and doors remained welcoming to many other children who would come see her and their GiGi as well.\n\nThe farm and quilting were Juanitas oasis. Her dogs, her cows, the deer, the hummingbirds, and her flowers were where she wanted to be, unless the Chiefs were on, then you would find her in red watching the game. Her quilting space is full of what ifs, lets try this, and beautiful accidents. Her creative outlet had no boundaries. Whether she was inside or outside at the farm, she was able to do something she loved. She and Larry built their joy there together.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her mother and father, Dale and Louise Gile, brother, Richard Gile, several aunts and uncles, and grand-daughter, Anastasia Brewer.\n\nShe leaves her husband, Larry Hobson, her children, Brenda Nunn and Greg Cooper, and Pamela and Mark Hood, her grandchildren, Cheri and Brian Fisher, Kamron Hood and Kasey Bayer, Tyler Scheller, Ana Hood, her great-grandchildren, Cash, Jackson, Juan, JB, Joyce, Brock, Teagan, and many cousins and relatives.\n\nJuanita taught love, strength, and a little sass to all in this family and to any who were a part of her world. She will be greatly missed by all.\n\nDorothy V. Black (1936-2022)\n\nDorothy was a longtime PCGS member and supporter. Her generous donations have greatly supported our society over the last few years.\n\nDorothy Vanita Black, age 86 of Pittsburg, MO, passed away Sunday, December 18, 2022, at Citizens Memorial Hospital Bolivar, MO. She was born August 14, 1936, in Goodson, MO, to Cecil and Caroline (Shoman) Black.\n\nShe is preceded in death by her parents; three brothers: Kenneth, Clarence, and Buford Black; and a sister Doris Crawford. Dorothy is survived by many nieces, nephews, other relatives, and friends.\n\nAccording to Dorothys wishes her body will be cremated. Private inurnment will take place at a later date. Online condolences may be made at: www.greenlawnfuneralhome.com. Arrangements have been entrusted to Pitts Chapel Bolivar, MO.\n\nJack Glendenning (1927-2022)\n\nJack was our resident historian, longtime member and volunteer at PCGS. We have missed his presence greatly in recent years (after he entered the nursing home) but so much of our group's existence was intertwined with Jack and his boundless knowledge!\n\nJack Glendenning, loving husband and father of three, passed away at the age of 95, on Friday, September 16, 2022. Jack was born on May 17, 1927 in Joplin, MO to Frank and Edna May Glendenning.\n\nJack proudly served his country in the Korean War as a member of the United States Army. Upon his return, he attended Southwest Baptist University, and married his wife, Doris Jane Bean, on January 7, 1950. They lived and worked in Kansas City for the next 19 years. Along with his brother George Glendenning, he became owner and proprietor of a Bolivar staple, Polk County Electric, in 1969.\n\nFor the next nearly 40 years, Jack could be found working tirelessly at Polk County Electric, just off the square, serving the community. His business would become more than just a storefront, as on any given day you could find locals stopping by to drink coffee and catch up on the news, life and politics, grandchildren running around the showroom, and often a dog sleeping under the counter. People from all over the country would journey to see Jack, as a long- standing member of the Genealogical Society, to locate grave sites of past family members or further information on their familys ancestry.\n\nJack was co-author of the book, The Slicker Wars written alongside his brother-in-law, Clarke Thomas, and also played a major role in the opening of the Polk County Museum & Historical Society on West Locust in Bolivar. He was an avid card player and loved baseball and football.\n\nJack is survived by his three children, Kerry Meinecke and husband Tim, of Liberty Missouri, Dana Eversoll and husband Lee, David Glendenning and wife Gabriela, all of Bolivar; his grandchildren, Aaron Eversoll & his wife Amy, Kimberly Adams, Abby Glendenning (granddaughter-in-law), Rachel Roberts & her husband Jake, Adam Glendenning, and Alex Glendenning & his wife Jessica; two step grandchildren, Diego Brawn, and Fernanda Brawn; as well as many great-grandchildren. He is also survived by his beloved sister, Olive Thomas, of Carthage, Mo.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his wife, Doris Glendenning as well as his grandson Andy Glendenning and siblings Mary Lea Phillips, Bud Glendenning, George Glendenning and Ralph (Icky) Glendenning.\n\nA visitation for Jack will be held from 4-7 PM Wednesday, September 21, 2022 at the Butler Funeral Home in Bolivar. In lieu of flowers the family kindly asks that memorial donations be made to the Polk County Humane Society or to the Polk County Genealogical Society. These two organizations were very dear to him.\n\nBenjamin Lewis Gravely (1944-2022)\n\nBen was a long-time officer, member and volunteer at PCGS.

The second son of Harlie Campbell Gallatin and Gladys Louise (Warren) Gallatin. Harlie was raised in the church and in 1945 he accepted Christ and about two years later made a public commitment to full-time Christian service. In May, 1951 he graduated from Meadville High school and enrolled at Hannibal-LaGrange College. While a student at Hannibal-LaGrange, he served as song leader at Immanuel Baptist Church, Hannibal, and was licensed to the ministry there in July of 1952. On March 28, 1954, he was ordained as a Gospel Minister by Mt. Olive Church, Linn County MO. As a young man, Harlie pastored several small churches and continued to fill interim pulpits and supply preach as he pursued his education.\n\nHarlie Kay began his advanced studies by completing his A.A. Degree in Social Studies with Language Studies in Koine Greek from Hannibal-LaGrange in 1953. He earned his A.B. Degree in Modern History, Psychology, Philosophy with Language Study in German, from William Jewell College, Liberty, Missouri, in 1955, and his Bachelor of Divinity, Biblical Philology (Koine Greek, Hebrew & Aramaic), Historical & Archeological Studies from Central Baptist Theological Seminary, Kansas City, Kansas, in 1959. In 1961 he earned an M.A. in History: Modern Europe and United States with Language Studies in Latin & French, from The University of Central Missouri, Warrensburg. In 1972, Dr. Gallatin completed his Ph.D., in Ancient & Medieval History, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nWhile at Hannibal-LaGrange in 1952, Harlie met, as he would say, the young lady who would one day be my wife, Nancy Mae Morgan. They were united in marriage on August 5, 1954 and began a wonderful 67 year journey together. In 1961 Harlie and Nancy moved their three small children to Bolivar, Missouri, where Harlie began a 40 year career with Southwest Baptist University (then Southwest Baptist College) in the History and Political Science Department. He served as Chair of that Department, from 1970 until his retirement in 2001.\n\nHarlie Kay served in various other positions during his tenure at SBU and continued to adjunct for several years following his retirement. It was in the early 80's that he graduated from the typewriter to the computer. He purchased his first personal computer in 1984. He taught himself hypertext markup language (html) and over the years built a cluster of web pages for the University.\n\nOutside the classroom he was a man of few words but his words were always well thought-out, insightful and significant to those who knew him. He had a deep love for education and a pursuit of expanding knowledge through exploration and questioning. In addition to his service at the university, Harlie enjoyed years of leading a Men's Sunday School Class at First Baptist Church. He had the remarkable ability of creating that safe space in his home and classroom where a person could ask questions and grow in understanding and knowledge. Guided by his committed faith to the Lord of love, grace and mercy, Harlie was all about pointing others to God who has revealed Himself to us though the Bible and though His Son, Jesus Christ. Clearly, Harlie lived out his favorite scripture verse found in 2 Timothy 2:15. Study to show yourself to God as one approved, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\n\nHarlie was a truly devoted husband and father, adored and highly respected by his wife and children. Their home life was filled with lively, open conversation. Meal times often stretched into lengthy discussions or erupted into joyful storytelling and teachable moments. He often told his children Nothing is a waste of time. You can learn something from every experience. They saw him model the life of Christ. Harlie will be remembered by his family for his insight, his wisdom, and his gentle spirit; his commitment to God and the study of His Word; and by his heartfelt prayers at the dinner table, which few others had the wonderful privilege of experiencing. He will be sorely missed.\n\nHarlie was preceded in death by his parents and infant brother Warren Dean Gallatin.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Nancy, two daughters Kaylene (Gallatin) Cox and husband J. Mark Cox of San Antonio, Texas, and Rhonda (Gallatin) Proffitt of Owasso, Oklahoma, and one son Morgan Dean Gallatin of Bolivar; four grandchildren, Andrew Cox and wife Kendall, Alyssa (Cox) Leal and husband Luis, R. Aaron Cox and wife Chelsea, and Isaac D. Proffitt; and four great grandchildren, Cole and Harper Cox, Esai Leal and Cohen Cox.\n\nA Memorial Service will be held grave side on Sat.

Montgomery and Adelyn A. Peterson Montgomery, was born on September 23 in Omaha, Nebraska. She lived in Nebraska, Michigan, Okinawa and Florida before moving to Maryland in 1969.\n\nAfter obtaining her bachelors and masters degrees from Florida State University, Paula accepted a position with Montgomery County Public Schools as a library media specialist. She worked at seven schools over the next four years before being promoted to teacher specialist, first in Media Field Services and then Evaluation and Selection. Paulas calendar also began to fill with speaking and consulting engagements.\n\nPaulas quest for knowledge and interest in other cultures fueled a list of travel destinations that carried through the rest of her life. Her explorations included Mexico, the Amazon and Machu Picchu, the British Isles, Denmark, Spain, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and almost every one of the United States.\n\nShe was promoted again in 1979 to Chief of School Library Media Services with the Maryland State Department of Education where she continued until her retirement in 1988. Paula was a fierce proponent of equality in access to information, pushing the importance of library and internet accessibility for all. She was instrumental in the development of policies, programs and laws at all government and education levels. This included consulting with the U. S. Department of Education throughout the 1980s and 1990s, and presentations to the U. S. House Subcommittee on Education.\n\nPaulas initial writing ventures had begun about the time of her promotion, and ranged over the years from magazine articles to complete books. During this period, she also began publishing School Library Media Activities Monthly, an activity-driven magazine for school library media specialists to use in their lessons.\n\nBy 1989, Paula obtained her Ph.D. in Reading and became an Assistant Professor at Western Maryland College. Particularly fond of her roles as a publisher and educator, she began Crinkles, a magazine full of activities for children to help them explore topics while developing research and library-use skills.\n\nPaulas love of research spilled into her hobbies as well as she delved into her genealogical history.

You can leave online condolences at www.robertsblue.com\n\nSharon met husband, Bill, in Las Vegas, NM when he began his career with ATSF Railroad. They were introduced by a mutual friend and married shortly after. Sharon and Bill moved to Chicago, IL where both of their children were born. Bills next stop for the Railroad was La Junta, CO before moving their family to Emporia in 1970.\n\nDuring the next 16 years, they raised their children who were actively involved in 4-H and Bill and Sharon both served as leaders. Sharon also chaperoned groups of 4-Hers to Michigan and Pennsylvania. After their children were in school, Sharon began working in Food Service at USD #253. She then went to work for Butcher School where all the meals (including rolls, buns and pastries) were made from scratch. Sharon loved meeting and working with the ESU student athletes that volunteered to serve lunches.\n\nIn 1986, Sharon and Bill followed the railroad to Topeka. They lived in Meriden where Sharon worked in food service in Jefferson County schools. In 1990, Sharon and Bill once again moved with the railroad to Kansas City. In 1995, when Bill decided to retire early, Sharons only desire was to move back to Emporia to be close to her children and grandchildren.\n\nUpon returning to Emporia, Sharon went back to work part-time at Village School serving lunches and rejoined Grace Methodist Church where she was a member of the Abigail Circle. Sharon enjoyed spending time with her church family particularly Coffee and Chat on Thursday mornings. Sharon also became active with Friends of the Library where she volunteered weekly assisting with book donations for the book fair. Friends of 4-H was a natural fit for Sharon since both grandsons were actively involved. She enjoyed watching them show their animals and supported them any way she could. Sharon was also a member of the Prairie Hens extension unit. Sharon and family continue to sponsor a trophy for the shooting sports each year. Sharon was also a member of the Cosmopolitan Study Club where she was currently the Vice President. She enjoyed the monthly lunches and learning opportunities with her friends.\n\nSharon was a great supporter of all three grandchildrens sports following them around the state cheering them on. You couldnt miss that Sharon was also an avid KU basketball and Royals fan. Many days she would be sporting apparel from these two favorites. Sharon rarely missed a game whether on TV or radio. In 2016, Sharon treated her entire family to a trip to Kauffman Stadium to watch the Royals play. It was one of her favorite memories.\n\nSharon never embraced technology and preferred to handwrite or type a letter or pick up the phone to catch up with friends and family. After Bills death, Sharon decided to sell her home and moved to Ashley II where she lived for the past 11 years. Sharon loved to bake and share with neighbors, friends and family. She also enjoyed taking care of the boys mowing or doing maintenance at Ashley. She would remind them that there were Schwans treats in the freezer in the Community Building. Sharon also enjoyed taking care of the planters at Ashley II in the summer and loved attending the Christmas Brunch in December.\n\nSharon was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia in March and immediately began chemotherapy. During Sharons last days, she relied heavily on her faith and continued to read her bible passages when she able. She never complained and passed quietly to be rejoined with her beloved husband. Sharon will be deeply missed by her friends and family.\n\nhttps://www.robertsblue.com/obituary/sharon-ikerd\n\nSue Carrolle Holbert Brown (1934-2020)\n\nSue and her husband Ray were faithful members of the society, attending every meeting until health problems required a move to Springfield.

Kirchner Jr. of Bolivar will remember him for his commitment to and love of family and genealogy. Kirchner, 81, died April 10.\n\nSusan Sparks, Leta Gass and Betty Doyle, members of the Polk County Genealogical Society, remember Kirchner as a very generous man. He and his wife, Deva, were charter members of PCGS, joining 20 years ago.\n\nHe was a very generous man, Gass said. He had a sense of humor, and he was very shy.\n\nKirchner completely funded the societys first published book, Sparks said, and even gave the society 100 copies to sell. He visited at least half of Polk Countys 174 cemeteries to collect cemetery records to keep at the genealogical society.\n\nAfter he and Deva finished collecting records from the cemeteries, Kirchner again published a book with his findings and gave the society some to sell. Roy and Deva even visited the Greenwood, Flemington and Lehman cemeteries every Memorial Day (since 1972) to decorate the graves of relatives. We admired this tradition, daughter Christena Barber said.\n\nKirchner began his favorite hobby, genealogy work, on Jan. 1, 1957, although he was also interested in stamp collecting, coin collecting, old books, phonograph records, song collecting, tape recording and computers.\n\nIn an email from PCGS following Kirchners death, Kirchner was remembered for his involvement with the organization. Roy and Deva attended almost every meeting, every conference, every event PCGS had. He even enjoyed coming to our beginning genealogy classes because he thought he might learn something new.\n\nGass said Kirchner, known as Mr. K to them, helped the society over the years by helping purchase computers, microfilm machines and copy machines, in addition to his countless hours of research.\n\nHe didnt really want accolades, Sparks said. We call one of the computers he used Mr. Ks computer.\n\nWhen we started our journey, I called him Mr. Kirchner. He said, Thats my dad. So we gave him the nickname Mr. K. We meant it affectionately.\n\nSparks, Gass and Doyle also remember Kirchner for the high level of precision in his work. Personally, as I create something, I think, Now what would Mr. K say about this? Gass said.\n\nKirchners contributed genealogy work includes contributions to the PCGS history book and more than 50 volumes of research on Polk County families, including three out of the four main lines of his and his wifes family. At the time of his death, Kirchner was researching the fourth line of his family, the Thatch family line.\n\nHe also did genealogy work for other people, Gass said. It was his lifes work.\n\nThe genealogical society intends to publish the last of Kirchners work with a memorial to him at the end.\n\nThere will never be another Mr. K, Gass said.\n\nThe ladies agreed that the best word to describe Mr. K was unique.\n\nI think people are put in your path for a reason, Sparks said of her interaction with Kirchner over the years.\n\nKirchners daughters, Barber of Bolivar and Angelena Hirsch of Mexico, Mo., said they did not always know what genealogy project their dad was working on but that they are grateful for the family history he has completed for them. We are extremely grateful for our own personal family that he made these books. We hope to do one-tenth of the job he did, Barber said about continuing their dads genealogy work.\n\nThe girls said their dad lived a very independent and simple life. He was very old fashioned, and had an old-fashioned way of doing things. According to Barber, he still used a push reel mower and was still driving his one and only car, a 1955 Customline, just three days before his death. Hirsch said her parents never owned a microwave or a clothes dryer, and they still used a rotary phone. They have no cell phone or answering machine.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, the Kirchners upgraded from dial-up to high-speed Internet so he could continue his genealogy work at home. Kirchner owned a microfilm machine and still had a small collection of microfilm.\n\nHe had his clipboard at his side any time he was working, Hirsch said.\n\nSparks said family was most important to Kirchner, and Barber said Kirchner loved for his girls to call and share about their lives. He loved for us to share our lives with him, for my sister and I to tell him about our daily lives, she said. He loved to hear what we had going on.\n\nKirchner was very proud of his family, including one of his grandsons for following in his footsteps and going into the military. Kirchner served for 20 years, 20 days in the U.S. Air Force. He was proud of his grandson for doing that, Sparks said.\n\nBarber and Hirsch said that some of the most important things their dad instilled in them were to carry on a written heritage and to be precise. It is extremely important to carry on your written heritage, Barber said, to document your heritage for future generations. He also taught us it is important to be as correct as possible, to be precise, Hirsch said. To do things correctly and accurately.\n\nHe was his own editor, Barber said. When he sent something to us (at the genealogical society) we were under strict orders not to touch it, Sparks said about editing his work.\n\nThe girls said Kirchner also taught them to be responsible with their finances. He was very good with keeping his personal finances straight, Barber said. He wrote down every penny he spent, and he tried to inst"
