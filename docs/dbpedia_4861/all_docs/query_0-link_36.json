        "text": "Do you remember? : A Walk Through Laindon by Emma Thomas added 23/03/2011\n\nI have just got back from Ken Porter’s A Walk Through Laindon talk at the library and would just like to say how great it was. I’m only 27 (pretty sure I was the youngest there by a good few years lol) but I find old Laindon fasinating, my family first moved to The Chase in Langdon Hills in the early 1900’s and I’ve grown up hearing many interesting stories. I will be asking them to dig out there old photo’s and memory’s for this site and for Ken’s new book on the POW camp :o) Would recomend his talk to all so make sure to go along next year everyone!. Emma\n\nDo you remember? : Blue House farm by Dave/Eve Wilkins added 26/03/2011\n\nWe have just registered with this site,as local history is of some interest to us and we was wondering if there was any photos of blue house farm as my wife remembers it when she was very young, she must have been about 5 or 6 yrs old and was trying to tell me how scary the old farm was. So if anyone has any pics of the old farm we would love to see them, thanks\n\nDo you remember? : Re: blue house farm by Brian Baylis added 03/04/2011\n\nI don’t have any photo’s, but do memories of walking through the farm to school every day, even to being chased through mud, by some pigs and losing a shoe. Yuk! I can remember a certain amount about the layout, but whether I could put it on paper or not, is another matter.. I can remember when my brother, the lad next door and I tried ‘fishing’ in the pond there for sticklebats and the farmer told us to “Clear off!” and we Ran for it.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: blue house farm by Dave/Eve Wilkins added 07/04/2011\n\nwell that all rings true with my wife, “clear off” was one thing, but she remembers a gun being wedged up in the window to scare kids off, well that worked, until next time.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: blue house farm by Dave/Eve Wilkins added 16/04/2011\n\nIn the same area along Markams Chase, it seems there was an old tin “shed” which was used as a shop, does anyone remember this, or is there any pictures,\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Blue House farm by John Bathurst added 26/05/2011\n\nAny attempt to answer Dave and Eve Wilkin’s enquiry of 16th April 2011 concerning an old tin shed being used as a shop contains difficulties without a somewhat detailed explanation. Firstly it not absolutely certain that an old tin shed did not at some time become a shop except that all the shops in Markhams Chase were anything but made of tin.. Markhams Chase is difficult for a start. The practice of naming roads in rural areas like Laindon or Lee Chapel is a modern one. In the past they were usually referred to as « ways », either being spoken of as « the way to » or « the way from ». The road now known as Markhams Chase was, in fact, earlier known as « the way to Corringham » or « the way to Willow Park ». This is the manner in which it is referred to on the map of Laindon Hall Farm in or about 1700. Like many such tracks of a rural nature it was never more than what we would now call a bridle way since traffic making use of it would be either humans on foot, cattle or horses on the hoof, or the occasional farm vehicle. Un-surfaced and probably virtually unusable in bad weather it would be a Green Lane of which there are countless numbers throughout the UK, and, because of that, where the name « Green Lane » appears in fully urbanised areas, there is a clue to what it was that once existed. The name Markham Chase arose from the fact that Blue House farm was in the hands of the Markham family for some time at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The Essex Education Committee, needing to extend school places in the Laindon area, acquired from Charles Markham, last of the line farming at Blue House, a field (shown as field No. 11 on the map schedule) to construct a new Junior School. The site actually lay in Lee Chapel, east of the Green Lane and, in order for building work to commence, it was necessary to provide a hard surface to the track from its junction with St Nicholas Lane and Church Hill, both of which roads having already been provided with such hard surfaces.. In deference to the former owners of the new building site, this newly constructed section of road was renamed as Markhams Chase. The remaining section of the original road remained, and subsequently was shown on street maps as « Green Lane », Until this part of the original road was eventually obliterated by the development of the New Town Development Corporation Lee Chapel North estate no greater improvement other than that of providing an asphalt covered footpath along its length as far as its junction with Northumberland Avenue.. (It is worth noting here that, in their usual Cavalier manner the Commission or whatever one of the several names they were employing at that time may. in destroying this old track or thoroughfare, have been also destroying centuries of history. It has long been thought that this was a path trod by many a pilgrim en route to Canterbury. A straight, or moderately straight, line can be drawn from Billericay via Great Burstead through Green Lane, Laindon. and on via The Bridleway and One Tree Hill to Corringham, a line that approximates to known existing, or previously existing, « rights of way ». The Medieval citizens of Corringham were known to have had grazing rights on both sides of the Thames, so would have had the means of ferrying their cattle and others across that otherwise formidable barrier to progress.). By the time the new school (Markhams Chase County Junior and Infants) was constructed and taking in pupils in 1933 there were two specially constructed shops in the new Markhams Chase with a third opening fairly quickly afterwards. The first two lock up shops were built on the east side of the road just to the north of the school. Semi detached, they were a speculative gesture and one of them (that closest to the school) was never operated as a business and was eventually demolished with its partner still unused when both were acquired by the Basildon Development Corporation.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Blue House farm by Dave/Eve Wilkins added 05/06/2011\n\nWell thanks to John for the very in depth answer,the shop in question was there when a friend of mine moved in the top of Belstedes,Markhams chase end,as the end i now live in was yet built,so that may help date wise,it would have been the great knightlys end,but he does describe it as “a tin shed”,but as he was a school boy of about 8,maybe his memories arnt quite right,.. As you have explained how Markhams Chase got its name,ie they used to own Blue house farm,they must have been the ones who put a gun in the window of the farm to freighten of the kids,as my wife remembers this part but not the shop,,and the information you gave John is very interesting,and full of historical facts.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Blue House farm by Brian Baylis added 06/01/2013\n\nThe owners of Barkers Store, I met up with some years ago, in a pub in Norfolk, and by pure chance. They were in Salvation Army uniforms, and selling War Cry.. I had attended a wedding at Laindon in the 1950’s, so asked if there was any chance they could trace the same couple for me, when I discovered they had owned the shop.\n\nDo you remember? : Elizabeth Drive by Jeff Footer added 07/05/2011\n\nHi, I’m a Laindon boy born and breed. I now live the other side of the world have done now for some 40 odd years. Looking at this site it brings back some great memories, the shops the people and the surrounding areas. I have’nt seen anything on Elizabeth Drive thats where I was born, in a little house called Kenwood. So if anybodys got photos of the Drive or the people please post. We lived just up from Ebenezer Hall. I along with a lot of other people don’t understand why they killed a little town like Laindon. I look forward to some photos of the Drive and the people that lived down there.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Elizabeth Drive by Emma Thomas added 28/05/2011\n\nHi Jeff. I’m helping out with the archive and am currently typing up someones memories, they mention Elizabeth Drive, I’ve also found these pages that mention Elizabeth drive for you, hope the articals bring back some great memories!. http://www.laindonhistory.org.uk/page_id__70_path__0p6p18p52p.aspx .

Under the heading: “Building Activity” appears: “The Sanitary Surveyor” (Mr H B Mayhew) reported that since its last report plans had been submitted for 90 buildings, including 82 dwelling houses. The others included a billiard hall.. The Clerk: Where is the billiard hall?. The Surveyor: At Laindon (loud laughter)”. Has anybody any suggestion as to where or even if “Laindon’s Billiard Hall” that occasioned so much laughter in 1923 was ever built and where it might have been located?. The reason I ask this question is that it was in the 20s I think that Walter Sorrell who lived at “The Homestead”, Northumberland Avenue, built his bungalow which, he always claimed, was done by erecting the full-sized billiard table it contained first and then building the house around it! He was a bit of a joker, so perhaps he was just having us on.\n\nDo you remember? : Mr Parkinson, bicycle mechanic by Fraser Russell added 26/05/2011\n\nCan anyone tell me more about Mr. Parkinson? In the late 1990s he used to repair our bicycles in his shop at the corner of Durham Road and the High Road – now Parkinson’s Corner.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Parkinson, bicycle mechanic by Ian Mott added 27/05/2011\n\nThe Parkinson family played a significant part in the history of Laindon and there are a number of references to the family on the site. There is an article titled Parkinson Brothers Motor Engineers (Discover our Community – see how others see our Community through their Memories, Laindon – Community) and their snippets in the the old photographs of Laindon. We are trying to produce an article on the individual members of the family, but the remaining members are unhappy at the moment and unwilling to sanction us to proceed.. There must however eventually be a detailed article as the history of Laindon would not be complete without one\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Parkinson, bicycle mechanic by Gloria Sewell added 29/05/2011\n\nHello Fraser the Parkinson family have had a workshop in Laindon as long as I can remember, it was on the cornor of Somerset Rd this was opposite which is now Laindon Link, I think thats still there. My uncle Ken did his apprenticeship there they moved to Durham Rd when the council bought them out what happened to him when he retired i’m sorry I don’t know.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Parkinson, bicycle mechanic by Ian Mott added 08/06/2011\n\nThere is now an article Cliff Parkinson. (see Discover our Community, Noteworthy People)\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Parkinson, bicycle mechanic by William Diment added 26/09/2011\n\nWhile Cliff Parkinson has been well documented nothing appears in respect of Bill of the garage near the Fortune on War. Bill was m/cycle enthusiast and connected to the grass track racing which took place opposite the Summerhill garage on Sundays. Bill did not ride but loaned cycles to ‘his’ riders one of whom was a Bert Flashman and also his son who died after being shot down over Germany. Perhaps this is the reason for not seeking publicity. Bill’s penchant was the performance of m/cycles and his favourite was a twin horizontally opposed Douglas which had no clutch or chain and was propelled by means of a leather belt. It had no automatic engine lubrication which supplied by a manual pump on top of the underslung petrol tankand which had to be operated manually. Despite this if one arose early on a Sunday morning, this machine could be seen scorching up and down the Arterial road once again with Bert Flasman as rider. It was suggested that it could attain a speed of 80mph although I do not know how this was estimated as it had no speedometer, but no one questioned the veracity of this.\n\nDo you remember? : POW Camp at Langdon Hills and Army Camp by Ken Porter added 27/06/2011\n\nIs there is anybody out there who has any memories, information on the POW Camp that was on the corner of Dry Street and Crown Hill. Also any knowledge on the Army camp at the bottom of Old Church Hill.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: POW Camp at Langdon Hills and Army Camp by Gloria Sewell added 09/07/2011\n\nHello Ken I don’t remember to much about the POW camp except that the prisoners made toys for the local children. I do have quite strong memories of the army camp, most of the lads there were on national service so they were all quite young. The ones I recall were nice lads they used to have dances up the camp and they picked us girls up in army lorries to go to the dances. There was a lad there I can’t think of his name but his nickname was “rubber legs” because he could rock and roll so well, he and I used to win the jive contests up there. We would win chocs for me and cigarettes for him we always swapped because he didn’t smoke and I did. Most of the boys were known as Scouse, Jock, Paddy, Jordie depending where they came from. One dance came to a sharp halt and we were all ushered out onto the lorries and driven up Old Church Hill with the lights off, quite scarry for a 16yr old, we later found out it was an IRA scare. Some of the lads used to drive through the village in little jeeps called champs they were not allowed to give us lifts but they often did. I remember one lad I was friendly with his name was Geordie Appleby he had a motorbike, on his way back from leave to Laindon he was killed. I don’t know why I can,t recall why but he was not taken back home to be buried he was laid to rest in the tiny church next to the camp, Old St Marys, it is now a private dwelling. His headstone read best I can recall “In memory of corporal Ken Appleby Royal signals”. I wonder if it is still there, I last saw it in 1962.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: POW Camp at Langdon Hills and Army Camp by Jemima Chapman added 13/04/2012\n\nI remember the POWs working on the farms, with the land girls and farm workers.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: POW Camp at Langdon Hills and Army Camp by Don Joy ( Smith ) added 13/08/2015\n\nWas told years ago that my grandfather William ( Bill ) Turner, Laindon’s coal merchant had been a warden at the p.o.w camp.\n\nDo you remember? : Harry Lowes café by Keith Nock added 19/07/2011\n\nI wonder if anyone remembers Harry Lowes café it was between the Fortune of War and Pound Lane, my mum worked there. I remember passing it when I went to the High Rd school.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Harry Lowes café by Albert Merrison added 07/08/2011\n\nI remember Harry Lowes café from when I worked at S.X. Tools in Pound Lane, my fondest memories was going to have steak and kidney pudding during my lunch break. Does anyone remember S.X. Tools in Pound Lane, I did my apprenticeship there and stayed for 20 years until its closure in 1975. Albert (Bert) Merrison\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Harry Lowes café by Keith Nock added 08/08/2011\n\nhi bert yes i remember s.x tool what a lovely road pound lane was do you remember ted underdown he lived in bungalow in pound lane didnt they turn s.x.tool into a medical supply factory for awhile before they pulled it down\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Harry Lowes café by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 11/08/2011\n\nMy husband Chris remembers Harry Lowe’s café – Peter Cackett used to work there; I think Rita Tuttle used to work there too. It was a long American diner-type building. He frequented it in 1956/57. It had a juke box, place not over popular, probably because it was out of the way. Think Harry Lowe sold it and went to Spain. Also think Harry was an ex boxer.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Harry Lowes café by John Bathurst added 26/08/2011\n\nHarry Lowe’s Café was on the Southend bound side of the A127 (Southend Arterial Road) approximately 200 yards east of the (New) Fortune of War. Those who have access to the old Basildon Street Map published by Barnetts of Barking after the New Town was announced can see a photograph of the café much as it is described by Andrea Ash because Harry used to advertise by this particular medium. As his original intention had been to catch the passing trade, in the pre WW2 days when a run out to Southend was popular with cycle clubs (most of whom disdained using the expensively-constructed cycle track alongside the carriageways) he was also listed in the CTC (Cyclist’s Touring Club) and displayed the club’s sign prominently on the building’s facade. This meant that at weekends and bank holidays there were often large numbers of bikes parked against the café’s walls.. At the time of the 1945 General Election, Harry ( a staunch Labour Party supporter) allowed the use of his café as the local (Laindon and District) office of Charlie Letherland (1898- 1992) who was acting as agent for Captain (later Lord) Ray Gunter !1909-1977) standing as Labour Party candidate for Parliament. It was in this office that, in those pre-computer days, that volunteers spent hours laboriously addressing envelopes in order that every voter in the large South East Essex constituency received Ray’s election literature through the post.\n\nDo you remember? : Modley’s tea shop by Keith Nock added 26/07/2011\n\nHi I wonder if anyone can remember Mrs Modleys tea shop, it was on A127 between Church Road and Pound Lane on London bound carriageway. Mrs Modley used to have tables and brolleys outside selling teas and ice creams, near by was postoffice and Davis the builders merchant also Coles body builders.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Modley’s tea shop by Gloria Sewell added 28/07/2011\n\nHello Keith I think I remember this little tea shop I had a friend living in Royston Ave. i’m sure we used to go there, was there also a butchers along there somewhere. I can also recall an old gipsy lady living behind it in a proper old round colourfull gipsy caravan which was burnt when she died proberly in the 50s.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Modley’s tea shop by Keith Nock added 29/07/2011\n\nHi Gloria. Yes there was a butchers also a newspaper shop near pound lane. I remember gypsy lady and her son living on land which went up to church. I lived in bungalow on the A127 between Church Rd and the flyover, until we moved to Royston Ave. Are you related to Ken Davis of Kens Autos, I remember Ken and his son Keith. Keith was my best man at my wedding, how Laindon has changed, we had so much fun in those days\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Modley’s tea shop by Gloria Sewell added 31/07/2011\n\nHello Kieth; yes I am indeed. Ken was my uncle he opened his workshop at the back of the old Fortune of War when he left Parkinson’s. We lost Ken to Cancer a few years ago, after he moved up here to suffolk. I took care of him at the last to help poor Norma out. Keith still lives in the area but Sandra has moved this way and I still keep in touch with his son Geff and wife Jean. Ken had a small market garden here in Suffolk before he died.. The butchers in pound lane used to deliver my mums meat to use every Tuesday when we lived in King Edward Rd. and the dog always chased him, it didn’t like his white coat reminded him of the vet.\n\nDo you remember? : Ted’s café by By Robin Lockhart added 04/08/2011\n\nDoes anybody remember Ted’s café, well known for its ‘frothy coffee’ It used to be at one time the hang out for the Spooks Scooter Club. It was the 1st property you came to on the Southend bound carriageway before the New Fortune of War. Does anybody have any photos?\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Ted’s café by Gloria Sewell added 18/08/2011\n\nWow! yes Robin another memory, I don’t recall to much about it as I was a Motor Bike girl in the 50s 60s, but yes now you have said it I think it had quite a large car park didn’t it and was also used for lorries. It would be nice to hear a few of your scooter day memories even though I was a “Rocker” of course. When I was a teenager there was no mods and rockers thanks for the memory. Gloria\n\nDo you remember? : Clarks Bicycle Shop by Richard Haines added 05/08/2011\n\nDoes anyone remember Clarks shop situated near to the Station end of the High Road. The left hand window was always full of Dinky Toys and Hornby Trains, the right hand side I think was Raleigh bikes, anyone have more detailed memories of this aladdins cave? I used to buy the Meccano Magazine there when I was about ten in 1957.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Ian Mott added 06/08/2011\n\nI remember Clarks cycle shop, with the link through behind the counter to the wool / needle work shop next door. My first full size bike was purchased there in the 50s, a Rudge special. I had many years and many miles of enjoyment riding that bike, well into the 80s. I still have some bits in my shed.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Anne Burton added 12/08/2011\n\nYes, I remember buying a bicycle from Archer Clark around 1957. (I can’t remember how much deposit I paid but it took me about 18 months to pay the remainder at 30 bob a month, that would be £1.50). I believe Archer Clark was married to the sister of one of my school friends, Elizabeth Ferris, head girl at Laindon High Road School.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Richard Haines added 12/08/2011\n\nAnne, thanks for this, what make of bicycle was it? – must have been a nice one. My biggest purchase in the shop was a Hornby-Dublo train set I got for my birthday in June 1958. It cost £4-18-6, a huge amount for my mum to pay in those days. I already had my bike, a dark red New Hudson bought in Manor Park. Just right for the unmade sections of Tavistock and Claremont Roads. It was good then, sometimes a car would actually use those roads as well, interesting in the winter, dusty and bumpy in the summer!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Anne Burton added 16/08/2011\n\nHi Richard. I think it was a Rayleigh, red and white. It lasted for years and years. It had three speeds and dynamo lights which were good but didn’t work if I went through a puddle. It was the largest purchase I had made to date. I worked at the library in Laindon at the time and so was able to cycle home for lunch. Incidentally, when my mother was a young girl, for a time, she did housework for Archer Clark’s mother. . I know what you mean about unmade roads.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Gloria Sewell added 18/08/2011\n\nI think I am talking about the same Clark’s they used to sell clothing and wool as well I recall buying a pair of gloves for my son Tony appox. 1965 and they still had the wartime utility mark, old stock I presume. If it is of interest to anyone the Clarks relocated when thier shop was taken over by Basildon to Reedham, a little village on the Norfolk Broads with its own little ferry. Gloria\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Richard Haines added 02/09/2011\n\nHi Ann, talking about unmade roads and Clark’s shop, I used to cycle through to Inverness Road in about 1959/60, on my way to Clarks avoiding the High Road – can you remember any of those back roads at all, the houses were mostly empty then, about to be demolished and the road was cut through by the Laindon Link works. The road was very up and down, bumpy and restricted by bushes growing in it. I think I got back onto the High Road by using Essex Road. Can anyone remember using those back roads in earlier days before Laindon Link. I bet it was nice then.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 25/10/2011\n\nI used those back roads and your description is how I remember them. I think I would start off just past Byron’s shop and come out at the top of St Nicholas Hill. They often feature in my dreams for whatever reason – seeing the grass and ruts and bushes. . Also, somewhere, in Laindon I would pass a big house that had several large home-made dolls’ houses outside. May have been on the way to Dunton but don’t know because I was very young.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop by Ian Mott added 26/10/2011\n\nAndrea. The model houses could well have been those in David Davidson’s garden. His home was on the North side of the railway and the second bridge over the line (where Mandeville Way now crosses) and just before entering the Colony.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Clarks Bicycle Shop/Model Houses by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 26/10/2011\n\nIan, thanks, at last someone knows! Thought that had been another recurring dream! We did an awful lot of walking when I was young, mostly Dunton way or Langdon Hills etc. These model houses, as I remember, were in rows and were beautiful. I have never heard of David Davidson.\n\nDo you remember? : Laindon Park Primary School by Albert Merrison added 07/08/2011\n\nI was surprised to see that Laindon Park Primary School did not get a mention, my older brother Mick and my younger brother Robert and myself all attended this school. Miss Donaldson was the headmistress when I first went to the school – but who knew or knows what her first name was? Following her retirement, the schools head was Mr Jack Wilson. Any more memories of this lovely school would be much appreciated. Albert (Bert) Merrison\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Richard Haines added 08/08/2011\n\nI was at Laindon Park for one year only 57-58. Teachers, Mr Stone, then Mrs Hodgson. Memories only good ones, I loved it. Bus from High Road through Wash Road, very wet in the winter, then up Church Road to the school. In the summer we walked home down through the playing field, through Pound Lane then to Basildon Drive and home through Nichol Road. In football lessons we had shirts with CF for center forward etc, brilliant, I was always right half to get my own initials. Sports day teams were Drake (blue) Clive (yellow) Nelson (red) and Wellington (green) – who thought all that up? The canteen had semolina for afters – who could top that. My friends there were Keith English, Barry Keeble, Brian Stepney, Kenny Prince, Brian Archer, Andy Darroch. Girls I can remember were Susan Gregory, Gilian Bull, Valerie Boatwright, Jacqui Sheppard, Jill Strutt, Valerie Newman, Pamela Lane. I’ve often gone back to look, it still seems the same, what a nice little school. Can others remember more……..\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Keith Nock added 08/08/2011\n\nHi Bert what a lovely school Laindon Park was before they built flyover near Church Rd we had to cross A127 at Church Rd., thats when intersections were still open. I remember going into Coopers shop to get sweets. We had a teacher Mrs Hughes her husband used to teach at Laindon High Rd his knickname was tap tap. For our country dancing we had to go to the church hall which is now gone. I remember having our sports days in school field, now bike sheds have gone and new classroom built in their place. What great days!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Gloria Sewell added 18/08/2011\n\nHi everyone, sorry I can’t remember much about “Donaldsons” in the 40s to 70s but from 1979 my twins Shelly and James attended it. Then called Laindon Park School, the school had 89 pupils Mr Lilly was the headmaster it was still as you all remember it a fantastic little school I have a school photo I will be using in a later article. Anyone who had children there then may recall I used to run a disco every year for the children. One year we had halloween, another year we had a beach party they were always great fun and the whole school went. The childrens field used to be across the road is it still like this. When I had to take my children from the school when we moved to Suffolk they still say it was like leaveing a family behind. I am so thrilled this is one school that has remained on the whole untouched by Basildon it certainly gave my twins a good start they both have good jobs here in Suffolk .\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Val Scurlock (née Newman) added 21/08/2011\n\nGood to see so many of my classmates’ names, Richard. When I left Laindon Park at eleven I went to Chelmsford to school and soon after that we moved to Basildon so I lost touch with all of my Laindon Park friends. I can also remember Heather Fullerton, Linda Smith, Prudence Wakefield and Maureen Hugget. The teachers I can remember were Miss Davies, Mrs Card, Mrs Wilson (the headteacher’s wife) Mrs Hodgson, Mr Stone and Mr Eric Rand. When I was in Mr Stone’s class the school must have been full because I can remember walking to the church hall to have lessons every day. It was my job to make Mr Stone’s coffee at playtime, boiling up the milk on the old gas stove. Mr Rand was the teacher I could remember the most clearly. I think he taught us in top class. I remember the recorder group, which I have a photo of but can’t put a name to all the faces. Also he took us to the Robert Major concerts (for children) in the Royal Festival Hall, London on some Saturday mornings. (What an experience!) I remember the country dancing and going to Markham’s Chase for some kind of festival. I think I have a photo. I was at the school between 1953 and 1959 and during that time the brick building at the back for the school was built and I can remember having dinner in there.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Richard Haines added 24/08/2011\n\nHi, Valerie, you were in my class when Mr Stone was teaching for the 1957 term. I remember I sat near the front with Kenny Prince, on the blackboard always hung a map of the world with all the British countries marked in pink. We always joked how big USSR was. I remember all the girls names you mentioned above. Also in our class was Philip Trew who lived on the King Edward Road estate and Howard Davies who lived in Church Road. I left Mr Stones class at the beginning of 1958 to join Mrs Hodgsons top class. I remember in the morning some of the children were driven by their parents by car to the school, I was always rather envious of them. I also recall walking round the the church hall for some lessons but not many, ours was a lovely room wasnt it, with windows looking out to the playground, playing field and the A127 aspects down Church Road. I liked Miss Davies best of the teachers but there again so did most of the boys!!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by June Higgs (Ferguson) added 31/08/2011\n\nI was at Markham’s Chase school in ’53 and the festival you mentioned could have been the Queen’s Coronation celebrations when we had to make and dress up in costumes from the time of Elizabeth 1st.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Gloria Sewell added 02/09/2011\n\nHello June, I do have a photo of us at the festival at Markham’s Chase kindly sent to me by Josie Bowen (nurse trickys daughter) from Australia I will ask the webmaster to put it on my Markham’s Chase years article. . Change of subject when I was at Markham’s Chase all the local schools went on a trip to London after the trip teachers arranged for us to exchange letters from school to school, my pen pal was Gloria Negus from Donaldson’s can anyone tell me if she still lives locally thank you.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by William Diment added 03/10/2011\n\nHallow Bert, I suppose you like me no longer play cricket but have become a watcher. I did later become an umpire with Laindon CC when they entered league cricket but gave it up as it became partisan with a must win attitude whereas we played for the love of the game win or lose. However I digress from your enquiry.. I did attend Laindon Park Primary in the days when it was known as Donaldson’s but “Miss” Donaldson was actually a Mrs. and had a son named Maurice about the same age as me. The question of her Christian name has been raised before but enquiries failed to reveal this.. As to Jack Wilson, you know as well as me from past association.. PS. Does your better half still keep scores?\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by William Diment added 16/10/2011\n\nHallo Bert; Futher to your message regarding Donaldson’s School I now remember John Bathurst giving her Christian name as Margaret.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Ann & Albert Merrison added 17/01/2012\n\nHi Bill. Lovely to receive your messages regarding Laindon Park School. We moved from Wash Road 4 years ago, me having lived in Westralia for 67 years, we are now on the Wirral.. Thank you for the name of Miss Donaldson. . Regarding your other message, no I do not play cricket these days, but like you we are both watchers of sport. Ann does not keep score any more only an eye on me. . We hope you and your family are all well, with our very best wishes Bert & Ann Merrison\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by William Diment added 08/02/2012\n\nHallo Ann and Bert. I have just noticed your comment. Miss Donaldson was in fact a Mrs. and had a son Maurice approx. the same age as myself.. As regards my family, regretfully my wife Peggy passed away several years ago after many years as an invalid. My youngest son Tom retired and moved to a small township in the Canadian Rockies, but I do still have a son and a daughter, plus three grandchildren living locally. Still this is the way of the world as it is said, “time like an ever rolling stream bears all its sons away.” We must make the best of what little time is left to us.. My best wishes to you both.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Park Primary School by Jemima Chapman added 13/04/2012\n\nRe Laindon Park School / Donaldsons, when I went to this school it was run by a miss Donaldson, she changed my name, because she did not like jemima and would cain my brother across his left hand because he was left handed, hard times.\n\nDo you remember? : Laindon Service Station by Keith Nock added 16/08/2011\n\nHi I wonder if anyone can remember Laindon Service Station on the A127 the James family ran it for some time?\n\nDo you remember? : Re: laindon service station by Gloria Sewell added 18/08/2011\n\nHi Keith, yes I worked for Mr and Mrs James for a while Mr James ran the garage side of things Mrs James ran the café side I recall (no disrespects ) he was quite a henpecked little man. Mrs James used to sit on a stall in the café watching every thing that went on, she even counted the sweets in the jar at the end of a shift to make sure we hadn’t eaten any. I also worked on the pumps there. After that I don’t know or can’t recall what happened to the couple. I know it was sold on and became a very nice restaurant, which we always used Saturday nights. They did really good steaks especialy T Bones ,they also had in house entertainment this would have been about 1970. I can’t recall if they carried on selling petrol as well.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: laindon service station by Keith Nock added 19/08/2011\n\nHi Gloria thanks for reply, I remember the James family through the daughter muriel. I worked with her husband at that time Cliff Viner. I worked at Tonibell Ice cream. Mr James was very henpecked I think he went to Spain.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Service Station by June Higgs added 31/08/2011\n\nI also remember the wonderful T-Bone steaks served in the café that was previously Laindon Service Station. I also remember two young gituarists who played there at weekends and sung the Everly Brothers songs.. There were a few other cafés on the A127 close to the Fortune of War. Enefers which stood where McDonalds is now. Mr Enefer, I believe, is still alive and in his 90’s. Bill’s café (commonly called Dirty Bills which I will not elaborate on) owned by Bill and his blonde wife Pat, which was on the opposite side of the A127 on the corner of the road that led to Buckingham’s slaughter house. He had an amazing antique organ which I only heard played a few times. It played automatically when a handle was turned and and a cylinder with pins sticking out of it played the keys. It was destroyed when a fire burned down the building. Next door was a small bar and dance hall which was popular in the late 50’s. Further towards London was another petrol station that I cannot remember the name of. It had a café where you could sit all evening for the price of a coffee or a plate of chips and listen to the juke box. It was the first place to have a Johnny Mathis record who was a new singer at the time.. The most popular café was the Hiawatha café next door to the Radion Cinema. Does anyone else have memories of it?\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Service Station by Gloria Sewell added 02/09/2011\n\nI’m glad you remember the lovely T.Bone steaks. Dirty Bills, yes I do remember clearly he and Pat always had a ciggy hanging out of their mouths and the fantastic organ. I have asked somewhere on this site about the organ, it’s so sad to know it was destroyed in the fire. Bill’s was one of the regular cafés us bikers used together with Enifers. The café further up the A127 was Hatters also often used by us. The Hiawatha was the first café in Laindon to serve Frothy Coffee, do you recall that. I must confess the bar beside Bill’s was the first place I ever became intoxicated on 3 Cherry Bs. Do you also remember The Blinking Owl, not part of Laindon but one of the Laindon Bikers haunts? . When my next artical for the site is published I do refer to these places I am sure June our paths must have crossed somewhere along the way.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Service Station by June Higgs added 02/09/2011\n\nYes, I do remember the Blinking Owl café. I remember doing a “ton-up” along the A127 on the back of David Flashman’s bike hanging on for dear life, skirt and petticoats flying and wearing stilettos, well before helmets were compulsory. David Codell was sadly killed riding his bike.\n\nDo you remember? : Farmer’s Taxis by Keith Nock added 16/08/2011\n\nHi can anyone remember Sid and Beryl Farmer they had taxis business in Wraysbury Drive, Laindon\n\nDo you remember? : Re:Farmer’s taxis by Albert Merrison added 16/08/2011\n\nHi Keith. Yes I remember Farmer’s Taxis, I played cricket with their son Ray Farmer, which I have listed on my notes regarding Laindon Cricket Club.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Re:Farmer’s taxis by Keith Nock added 17/08/2011\n\nHi Bert, didn’t Ray live in bungalow next to Sid’s. I remember name on gates back in 80s. I met Sid Farmer I think he said he had been abroad. It’s a job to picture Wraysbury Drive now but I remembering the blouse factory.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Farmer’s Taxis by Ken Porter added 01/09/2011\n\nHi Keith. Like Bert who I played cricket with, I also played with Ray. Beryl lives on the Noak Bridge Estate and Ray I believe in the Southend area.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Farmer’s Taxis by W.H.Diment added 22/09/2011\n\nFurther to earlier messages, Farmers Taxis first appeared in the post war period and was run by 3 brothers using large american limousines, I believe were Cadillacs. Sid Farmer who I believe was senior in the business lived on the now defunct Brackenmount estate. On receipt of CPO he had a house and garages built in Church Rd. near to the A127. It was then that he was advised of a further CPO and moved to Wraysbury Drive, although the CPO was never finally implemented. Even in Wraysbury Drive he still fell foul of the Basildon Development Corporation as he was informed part of his garden was to be taken for the new extension of Noak Hill Rd.. It would seem that Sid had enough of the local government and moved to Leigh.. I too, in common with Ken Porter and Bert Merrison played cricket with the son, Ray Farmer.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Farmer’s Taxis by Brenda Hendry added 25/11/2011\n\nMy husband drove Sid Farmer’s taxis out of Laindon Station & Basildon Town Centre. He moved to Basildon from London when he was 19 (1962) and got a part time job with Sid. Do any drivers remember him his name was Roger.\n\nDo you remember? : Essex Country Club by Keith Nock added 20/08/2011\n\nHi I am sure lots of you will remember the Essex Country Club in Basildon Road later changed its name to the Irish Club now land is all built on. Has anyone got any stories to tell of there times there?\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Essex Country Club by June Higgs added 31/08/2011\n\nHi Keith, I think that the Essex Country Club was also called The Bas Club before it became the Irish Club.. Does anyone remember the Regal Club on the corner of Pound Lane and Nicholas Lane? I think it was run by Patsy Newth’s brother who later had a bar in Lloret de Mar called Gary Coopers.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Essex Country Club by Ken Porter added 01/09/2011\n\nHi Keith. Yes it become the Basildon Country Club before it was called the Irish Club. I have a feeling it reverted to the Basildon Country club before it closed down.. I joined Laindon Cricket Club in 1959, their home ground was at the back of the Club\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Essex Country Club by Anne Burton added 13/09/2011\n\nI used to go to the Basildon Country Club with my friend Wendy in the mid-late 1950’s. We had some lovely times there.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Essex Country Club by W.H.Diment added 15/09/2011\n\nFurther to Ken Porter and others, pre-war this was the Basildon Country Club, although virtually in the heart of Laindon could not be designated as Laindon due to there being a Laindon Park Country Club next to Parkinson’s Garage at the Fortune of War roundabout. I believe the name of the Basildon Rd. club was changed to Essex when taken over by Joe Rothstein and after his death became the Irish Club under Mrs. Jeakin\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Essex Country Club by Roger Wicking added 03/12/2012\n\nAll I know is that my brother, Tony Wicking got beaten up there! His Crime? Speaking too posh in early 1950’s. But he took like a man, being a Flying Officer he was; I trust his assailants got their just deserts.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Essex Country Club by George Le-Surf added 13/06/2017\n\nFor a short while in the late 60s it got became “The Liberal Club”. Although not a Liberal, I did a deal and helped them to construct a concrete car park at the front. In return I held my stag party and wedding reception there, in 1969, at “a very reasonable” cost. Earlier when it was still a club, and when we lived in Kent Road, my two older sisters, Sheila & Rene went there, with their two friends, the “Tice” twins; I think at the week ends.\n\nDo you remember? : Beulah house by Denise Lovell added 22/08/2011\n\nMy husband’s grandparents lived in a house called Beulah and he spent many happy summers at Beulah with his grandparents and aunts and uncles. Does anyone know this house (not there anymore sadly) or have any photographs? The family name was Haydon. I believe it was near where Laindon Link is now.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Beulah house by Eric Pasco added 22/08/2011\n\nHi Denise, Do not know about the name of the house but know the name Haydon who lived in the High Road near Laindon Link. Ralph Haydon was in my class at Laindon School and he had younger siblings 3 or 4 if I remember. This would be around 1962/63\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Beulah house by June Higgs added 31/08/2011\n\nHi Denise, Are you by any chance related to Ernie Lovell who used to ride a motorbike around Laindon in the late 50’s?\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Beulah house by Denise Rowling added 02/09/2011\n\nRalph Haydon now lives in Greece.\n\nDo you remember? : Yellow Birds Majorettes by Gloria Sewell added 24/08/2011\n\nHello can any one give me any information on the Yellowbirds Majorettes based at Blue House School 70s onwards as I am writing an article about them. My twins were in the group 1975 but I would like to extend the artical further thankyou for any information.\n\nDo you remember? : S.X.Tools by Gloria Sewell added 26/08/2011\n\nAfter reading Mr Albert Merrison’s comment on the message board re.Harry Lowe’s café. I thought it would be interesting to ask for peoples memories on the S.X.Tool Co. in Pound Lane. My father-in-law was employed there for a number of years as a toolmaker, his name was Mr James Muir, he was scottish and he worked there until it closed down and then went to Carreras. Another member of the family that worked there, I hope I am right in saying, was Mr Roy Webster.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: S.X.Tools by Robin Lockhart added 31/08/2011\n\nMy father worked at SX Tools just after the war, his name was George Lockhart. No futher info I’m afraid\n\nDo you remember? : Re: S.X.Tools by Gloria Sewell added 10/09/2011\n\nI lived on the other side of the 127 in the row of brick houses no.51 opposite the church ground my twins spent their early childhood their 1975-till we moved to Suffolk 1984 I m so glad to say that little piece of Laindon is still the same S.X. Tools was changed into a drug suppliers about then …..\n\nDo you remember? : Re: S.X.Tools by Gloria Sewell added 10/09/2011\n\nI should have said a row of brick houses in pound lane just past the Kathleen Ferrier Entrance……\n\nDo you remember? : Re: S.X.Tools by Donald Joy added 11/12/2015\n\nGloria, I do remember S.X. Tools being in the other part of Pound Lane. Can’t say anything of any use to anybody about it but, I did think, at a very young age, what a clever name it was. It one day dawned on me that S.X. was in actual fact the exact sound of our county name Essex. Thought I was really clever to have spotted that ! We must almost have been neighbours, well done for avoiding me.\n\nDo you remember? : Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Keith Nock added 29/08/2011\n\nHi I wonder if anyone remembers Pollards newsagents on A127 near Pound Lane\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Ken Porter added 01/09/2011\n\nHi Keith. Yes, I did a paper round for them for two years 1957/59. My round took me up Church Road, north of the A127. Down Wash Road, west direction, Royston Avenue, I went to the top of Rectory Road. At Weekends I had to do the round in two hits because of all the farmers brochures. Collected money on Saturday and Sunday. Paid 10/- a week increased to 12/6d when I added a few more houses. I received more in tips than my wage but I enjoyed it what ever weather.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Val Scurlock (née Newman) added 01/09/2011\n\nI remember a newsagents in that area and the name Pollards is familiar. I lived in Basildon Rd in the 50s, (the school end of the road) and I can also remember a newsagents or a shop that sold comics on our side of Church Road, near the end towards the A127. Later I think it became a motor bike shop or something like that. There was also Charlie Mesnards butcher shop opposite Mrs Coopers and the post office/sweet shop on the A127. I remember getting our orange juice and milk powder, (I think rationed) from there. I wasn’t born until 1948 so it must have been those supplies which carried on after the war to build up our strength.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Gloria Sewell added 10/09/2011\n\nhello valerie Mesnards the butchers used to deliver my mums meat to her on a Tuesday morning every week We used to have to shut the dog in because he always went for him i think it must of been the smell of the meat and he just wanted to eat him poor man …do you remember the plums that used to grow along the hedge on the 127 between pound lane and church rd we used ti pick them every year for jam ..One more thing Valerie do you remember Mrs (i think)bright that used to tell fortunes i think she lived in Chuch rd bye now Gloria\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by W.H.Diment added 15/09/2011\n\nThe other shops referred to by Val Scurlock, were Coopers Stores who were also newsagents formerly owned by Fred Tallboys. The wooden shop opposite was at one time a sweet shop until it became a butchers by Reg. Meznard, Charleys older brother. The shop near to the A127 in Church Rd., did become Gordon Swift’s M/cycles and still exists today under new management. The post/shop on the A127 next to Coles body builders was known as Reeves Post Office and Pollard’s was further west close to Pound Lane.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by William Diment added 24/09/2011\n\nHallo Gloria Sewell. The fruit trees on the north side of the A127 were probably left when the small dwellings which existed prewar were cleared, but were not entirely forgotten as some of the house names were used for road names on the Noak Mead estate.. Mrs.Bright, the fortune teller did live in Church Rd. opposite the shop which later became Swifts M/cycles. She had a daughter Norma who was a classical pianist and also taught the piano. Norma had a horse she kept in the field behind her house.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by William Diment added 25/09/2011\n\nHallo Gloria Sewell. The fruit trees to which you refer on the A127 were probably left over from the small dwellings which used to exist there, but although gone are not forgotten as some of the house names live on as road names in the Noak Mead estate. Similarly there is an apple tree in the hedge outside the Campanile Motel, probably a remnant of the old Brackenmount arera.. Also Mrs.Bright the fortuneteller did live in Church Rd., opposite to the shop which later became Swifts M/cycles. She had a daughter, Norma, who was a classical pianist and also taught locally. Norma had a horse which she kept in the field behind her house near to a timber dwelling in which a family named Bullock lived but later moved into Church Rd.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Val Scurlock (née Newman) added 25/09/2011\n\nW.H. Diment – Did you remember Gordon Swift’s motorcycles shop in Church Road being a newsagents before that? I can remember that in the 1950s.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by William Diment added 27/09/2011\n\nHallo Val Scurlock. I do not remember the shop in question as a paper shop as I had left the area for a period at the date you mention. Were Coopers still selling papaers at that time? My main memories of the shop was prewar and in entering, there was a long counter covered in little glass cabinets which contained all the sweets. In the bungalow next door lived a lady who called herself Madame Godfrey and taught singing With Norma Bright opposite, the arts in Laindon were well catered for.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Terry Rattenbury added 15/06/2012\n\nHello Val its taken me a while to read these messages, but I think you will find that before the shop was Swifts it was Coopers I used to go there on my way too Laindon park school. They later moved to the A127.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Terry Rattenbury added 17/06/2012\n\nSorry slight senior moment of course it wasnt Cooper’s they were further along Church road I meant to say prior to Swifts the shop was Pollard’s.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Pollard’s Newsagents on A127 by Don Joy (Smith ) added 13/08/2015\n\nMy friend and neighbour Raymond Broom, who sadly passed away aged just 17, did a paper round for Pollards which daily took him as far afield as Crays Hill ! He was once fined 10 shillings for riding a bicycle without lights while on his round ! I knew the Pollards son Dave who I believe was a year or 2 older than me and was always in awe of him as he was a leading Mod in the area and wore the most amazing suits. Oops the green eyed monster just resurfaced !\n\nDo you remember? : Manor Mission by Eric Pasco added 31/08/2011\n\nWho remembers going to Sunday School there? I believe it is still standing. The Rowe family I think ran the Mission. Went there from about 1952 – 1958. Always remember Harvest festival time.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Gloria Sewell added 31/08/2011\n\nYes, Eric I do recall the Manor Mission, but help me, was it in Manor Rd? I just can’t bring it into focus in my mind, except that we got little paper leaflets with a prayer on them from the meetings. Manor mission has a place in my memory but I need it jogged some times.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Gloria Sewell added 01/09/2011\n\nWas the park behind the prefabs a little futher up the road and did you go through a wooden gate to get to the park. If yes, I can recall it but very vaguely, as I was only 4 when we left the prefabs. I remember walking through the gate down an unmade road to the hall and comeing out to bye sweets at Steer’s before going back home.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Eric Pasco added 01/09/2011\n\nYes Gloria it was in Manor Road just up on the left hand side, behind a factory I think? Was more like a hall than a church. I am almost certain that the Rowe family who lived in the High Rd opposite the school were very much involved as Sunday School teachers. After Sunday school we used to walk up to Langdon Hills Rec up to watch Dad play cricket in the summer.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Eric Pasco added 02/09/2011\n\nIt was just off thre High Road maybe 100 yards on the left, if you continued up Manor Road it took you to the park where the prefabs were, so you are spot on. I do not remember the sweet shop.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Anne Burton added 05/09/2011\n\nI went to Sunday School at Manor Mission. Sunday School teacher Mrs Marleton (not sure about the spelling), she was the mother of a boy in my class at Markham’s Chase by the name of Geoffrey. Each week we received what they called a script, which was a picture of a scene in the bible with a relevant verse. You could find the scene in the bible and keep your script in place. I still have some of them. I kept attending until I was late one week and got a red tick instead of a black tick on my card and didn’t go any more as I thought it was rather unforgiving of them. I was only about 7 or 8.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Colin Ferrier added 11/09/2011\n\nI too went to Sunday School at Manor Mission sometime between 1947 and 52. The person in charge at that time was Mr Turle. At the rear of the church was a small hall where the cubs met on a weekly basis. The cubmistress was Miss Hickson who lived in Laindon High Road opposite Wilsons the chemist. I lived in the prefabs in Railway Approach until 1952.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 30/10/2011\n\nHave passed a fairly recent photograph of the Manor Mission to Ian, who will no doubt scan/publish it.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by John Rolph added 06/01/2014\n\nI never went to Sunday School there but remember it well – I lived for 14 years in the bungalow directly opposite the Mission.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Manor Mission by Ted Bruley added 14/01/2014\n\nI can remember going to cubs and scouts at Manor Mission Hall in Manor Road. This would be in the late forties I think. Mr Rowe was the scoutmaster and he lived on the corner of Pauls Road and Tavistock Road. I was later to live in Tavistock Road for eleven years.\n\nDo you remember? : Dorothy’s Sweet Shop by Robin Lockhart added 02/09/2011\n\nSomebody must remember Dorothys Sweet shop it was just up from the Hiawatha, only a small place next door to a hair-dressers on the end of a small parade. My mother worked there on a Sunday 9am to 9pm. It was owned Cecil Gatley, he also had a butchers shop in Church Rd and in the High Rd the other side of the station. These used to belong to Mesnards. Gatleys also had 2 shops next to Great Burstead church.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothy’s Sweet Shop by Val Scurlock (née Newman) added 05/09/2011\n\nRobin- Thanks for posting this message. I have been trying to put a page together about my family and memories and couldn’t remember the name of the shop. It all fell into place when I read your post. Cecil was my uncle and he married my Aunt Dolly (Newman). I remember that the shop was named after her. When I was in my early teens I worked in the sweet shop on Saturdays. I loved it. I think that is when I developed my sweet tooth. Cecil owned a butcher’s shop on the same parade as the sweet shop. My dad Wally Newman worked for him at one time and later when he was working for Fords he helped him out at weekends. At Great Burstead they had a butcher’s and a grocer’s shop and lived in the rest of the house. We spent a lot of time there as children. I can remember quite a few shops in the Hiawatha area.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothys Sweet Shop by Robin Lockhart added 05/09/2011\n\nHi, I remember a chap called Walley who used to drive one of the vans at the weekend when Joe was off, my Dad did as well. I used to work at the shop next to the church in Gt Burstead after school & all day Sat. Who was Mrs Stringer related to? I know Joyce & Margaret were Cecil & Dorothy’s daughters. Unfortunately no photos from those days\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothy’s Sweet Shop by Robin Lockhart added 05/09/2011\n\nHi, When did you used to visit the shops in Gt.Burstead? . I worked there from August 1955 until May 1957. Our paths must have crossed at sometime\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothys Sweet Shop by Val Scurlock (née Newman) added 08/09/2011\n\nMrs Lily Stringer was also in the Newman family, Dolly and Wally’s sister. She did a lot of work for St Nicholas church during her time. I’ll try to get a page about it written for the site.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothy’s Sweet Shop by Keith Nock added 08/09/2011\n\nHi Val was Lily related to Cyril Newman who lived in Church Rd? I remember he was a friend of my uncle George Bull who lived on the corner of Basildon Rd and Church Rd. I remember going in a sweet shop near Great Burstead Church, mum and dad used to walk up through the fields to it.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothys Sweet Shop by Val Scurlock (née Newman) added 08/09/2011\n\nYes, there were five children in the family in age order they were Lily, Dolly, George, Wally and Cyril. I will try to get on with some pages when I get back from holiday. We used to walk across the fields to Great Burstead in the summer sometimes. Cyril lived in a bungalow in Church Rd but not when we were living in Basildon Rd. I can’t remember the name of the road he lived in with his wife Winnie before she died.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothys Sweet Shop by Robin Lockhart added 08/09/2011\n\nHi, Just a small point. You mentioned Church Road and Basildon Road, well my wife used to live in Brackenmount which I think was close by. This was in the early 50’s to 1961,\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothy’s Sweet Shop by Keith Nock added 09/09/2011\n\nHi Robin I remember Brackenmount it ran from Basildon Rd to the A127. I remember a man called Wally Staden, he kept goats. I used to live in bungalow on the other side of A127, we used to go newting on ponds near where Yardley’s use to stand.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dorothy’s Sweet Shop by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 10/09/2011\n\nYes, do remember that sweet shop because my Uncle Will (Elliott) was the Barber next door – he lived in the house behind the shop..

There was a little chapel on the corner of Basildon Road and Bracken Mount. I think the road went through to the arterial road.

The land was sold for housing after they retired.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Gloria Sewell added 09/09/2011\n\nYes Kieth I remember Flack’s when I used to stay with my friend Veronica Nightingale, you may recall them they were a large family living in Royston Ave. The sons name was Harry all the girls had lovely curly hair. We used to go to Flack’s to get parafin for their heater and they also sold pigeon food, her father kept pigeons i’m sure thats where he got the food. We used to cycle that way across Barleylands to go see Billy Foil’s lions.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Keith Nock added 09/09/2011\n\nHi Gloria yes I remember Nightingale’s my uncle George Bull married Dimps Nightingale, I still keep in touch with Dimpses daughter Carol what a small world.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Gloria Sewell added 10/09/2011\n\nAs I say thats Laindon for you, was your uncle the butcher and have you had any contact with the Nightingales. I would love to know how Veronica is? When they moved to Wales, when we were 15, I went to stay with them in Wales, I haven’t seen her since. I would love to hear anything about her. Thanks\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Keith Nock added 10/09/2011\n\nHi Gloria no my uncle was a ground worker, i will get in touch with Carol and find out for you. I know Dimps is still alive in her 80s.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Gloria Sewell added 10/09/2011\n\nThankyou so much keith i know one of the sisters married a butcher in fact i think he had a shop nearby and also in Pitsea was Dimps a hairdresser .Two other girls i recall living near Flacks we were pals with were Barbara Flint and Jacky …….Married name Macglocklon married a soilder from Laindon camp bye now Gloria …\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Keith Nock added 11/09/2011\n\nHi Gloria, I have spoke to Carol, Veronica is well and still living in Wales. She has been married 40yrs but no children. Carol will pass message on if I could have your email address I will keep you in touch.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Gloria Sewell added 11/09/2011\n\nKieth thank you so much I am at this moment sitting here crying, Veronica was my oldest and bestest school friend we went and did everything together untill she moved to Wales. i dont know why we lost touch (marrage etc.) but we did, this means so much to me thank you again.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Gloria Sewell added 11/09/2011\n\nForgot to say thank you Laindon Archives site thank you so much without you I would never have found Veronica.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Anne Burton added 13/09/2011\n\nI remember Flack’s shop. When I was first married I lived at Phylbert, Dunton Road. When I had my first baby in 1964, I used to trundle the pram up Wash Road to the shop. The girls in the shop were very nice and sent me a ‘New Baby’ congratulations card.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by W.H.Diment added 15/09/2011\n\nFurther to Keith Knock and others, this shop was originally owned by Mr. Enefer who also had the café at the Fortune of War. It changed hands circa 1936, but I cannot remember the buyers name. The Flack family I believe purchased during the war years and it remained with them until it was closed after Dennis Flack’s retirement. It had a short lease of life as a secondhand furniture shop until being demolished for the housing estate of Noak Mead.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Val Scurlock (née Newman) added 19/09/2011\n\nWhen I was very young, before I went to school, my mum Renée (Irene) Newman (née Thomas) worked in Flack’s and I used to go with her and play in the back room. I remember colouring etc in there. That would have been in about 1951/2.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by Tracey Bradford added 05/06/2012\n\nHi Keith, I remember Flacks post office shop in Wash Rd. My Nan Irene Wells used go round there with me when I was younger to get a bag of sweets, bread, milk, etc. My nan and grandad used to live round the conner in Wash Road in a bungalow near the Prince of Wales. Also my nan used to be a cleaner in the Prince of Wales pub early in the mornings, I used to go with her when I stayed over night with her. . I will never forget it, they were the best times for me.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Flack’s Post Office by alan taylor added 22/10/2013\n\nHi Keith, I remember Flack’s, I lived in Martindale Aveue, after the Flack’s retired it was a second hand shop for a while, as you say there are houses there now. I can not remember his sisters name but they did live in Southend\n\nDo you remember? : Six T plus club by Gloria Sewell added 14/09/2011\n\nThis club started in the elderly peoples residence on the Kathleen Ferrier estate. Sorry can’t recall the name of the residence. I was on the steering commity and it was me who named the club. When it got started I became unwell and could not continue, does anyone know how long it went on for or even is it still going it started up approx. 1975?\n\nDo you remember? : Doctor Garson by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 17/09/2011\n\nI especially remember one day with Dr Garson at Dr Long’s surgery. Can’t remember the year, but there was an epidemic; I had time off from my London job to visit the Doctor for an innoculation. I was only a youngster but Dr Garson asked if I was going back to work and when I said no, he said ” well you can stay here and help me ” which I did – for the rest of the afternoon – placing small plasters on patients’ arms after the jab.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Doctor Garson by Robin Lockhart added 19/09/2011\n\nDr Garson remembered with great affection. He was my wife’s GP when she was a teenager, and he was also the President of Basildon Youth Association aka BYA in the early 60’s. . I believe he emigrated to Canada.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Doctor Garson by Keith Nock added 16/10/2011\n\nI remember doctor garson he was my doctor I think he emigrated to Canada, after that doctor Long became my doctor. He was very straight talking I remember I had a temperature Dr. Long looked at me in this thick vest I had on told me to take it off and I would be ok.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Doctor Samuel Long by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 25/10/2011\n\nWhen I was a small child, I smacked Dr Long’s face when he tried to examine me – he retaliated with a tap back on my face!. When my husband went to Dr Long to have a Whitlow lanced, he told the doctor it might make him jump, to which Dr Long drily replied ” well you’ll only jump seven feet because that’s the height of the ceiling”.\n\nDo you remember? : PEACHEY BROS by Dave Oakley added 11/10/2011\n\nWho remembers the green grocer Peachey’s? I worked there in the 60s, the shop had front shutters and when the snow blew it used to come right into the shop and cover us and the displays—BRRRRRRR.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: PEACHEY BROS by Gloria Sewell added 12/10/2011\n\nYes I do remember Peachey Bros they also had a shop in Laindon Shoping center when it first opened, in its better days, opposite the chemist and chinese take away.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: PEACHEY BROS by Norma Saggers added 22/11/2011\n\nI worked in Peachey’s Office above the warehouse, they had a German Shepherd called Max\n\nDo you remember? : Re: PEACHEY BROS by Don Joy ( Smith ) added 10/08/2015\n\ni remember Peacheys when they started trading from an old ex milk float that they trundled around the streets of Laindon. As they grew they had a stall on the grounds in front of Buckenhams the butchers along the High Road, after which they then occupied the shop next to the Radion that had previously been Clarks bike shop. As is well known they then went from strength to strength to become a major supplier of fruit and vegetables to schools and other establishments as well as running their own chain of shops.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: PEACHEY BROS by Donald Joy added 02/09/2015\n\nDave and Terry Peachey started out selling fruit and veg out of a van they drove around Laindons roads mid to late fifties as I recall. They then had a stall on ground to front and side of Buckenhams the butchers, how well I recall them calling out their prices of the produce they were selling. “4 pound a bob, get your taters ere” comes to mind. From there they moved into the shop immediately to the left of the Radion cinema as you stood facing it. Thereafter they just grew and grew opening shops all around the Basildon area plus a large warehouse on one of the industrial sites. Having grown in size and reputation they broke into the wholesale trade supplying among others most of the schools in the area.\n\nDo you remember? : Laindon Bed Race by Albert Merrison added 14/10/2011\n\nNow here is a question, how many of you “old” Laindon people remember the annual bed race, between the four Laindon pubs. It would start with the 4 landlords laying on a bed, which was pushed by as many people as you could muster, normally the local rugby club players. It would start at the Prince of Wales in Wash Road and move on to the Fortune of War (sadly no longer there), where a pint or three would be consumed, the “push” would then move on to the Laindon Hotel (sadly no longer there), where a further pint or four would be consumed before movinf on to the Crown Hotel where the whole “push” would end and where many, many pints would be consumed. The following year the whole process would happen again, but coming from the Crown Hotel to the Prince of Wales – much easier because most of the “push” was downhill. I believe that the race took place over the Easter weekend, possibly on Easter Monday. I think any monies collected went to the Burns Unit at St. Andrews Hospital (sadly no longer there). I hope many of you will remember this annual event. I think this race ended in early mid seventies.. Albert Merrison\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Bed Race by Ian Mott added 16/10/2011\n\nAlbert was this the same as the wheelchair races over the same course or did it replace it?.

I recall a body or coach builders there when I went to the clinic to see our local nurse Tricky (Bowen).\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Coles body builders by Keith Nock added 22/10/2011\n\nHi gloria no it was on the A127 between Church Rd., and Pound Lane on the London bound carriageway. I enjoyed your story about the Radion my auntie worked there as usherette come icecream lady\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Coles body builders by William Diment added 23/10/2011\n\nHi Keith, I remember Coles body builders next to Reeves Post Ofice. I also knew Tom Tanner and his neighbour “Jock Thompson” who was the foreman painter and all vehicles were painted by hand with paint mixed by Mr.Thompson. I was also friendly with his son Douglas and his friend who lived opposite, Sid Clarke. They joined the navy together and just before WW2 they were both lost having been swept overboard in a hurricane in the China seas. I also remember Ken Porter’s dad worked there.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Coles body builders by John Rolph added 06/01/2014\n\nMy father worked for Coles for many years and knew Tom Tanner. I went to the same school as Christine, the boss’s daughter.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Coles body builders by Don Joy ( Smith ) added 13/08/2015\n\nRonnie Stanley, one time of Pound Lane, who I know was in the year below me, worked at Coles after leaving LHR. He was there for many years and if retired now probably was there until that time. He married Carol Strand who lived in Vaughan Williams Road. The last time I saw both of them was at a reunion at LHR after it had closed and was astounded to learn that we had been near neighbours in Thundersley for years. Maybe you knew him, hope this is of some value to you.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Coles body builders by Donald Joy added 25/08/2015\n\nYeah Keith, I remember Ronnie Stanley who lived a short distance along the opposite side of Pound Lane to me working there. If memory serves me correct he started there from leaving school and stayed right through to ( I assume he has ) retirement. He was 1 year lower than me at LHR, went on to marry Carol Strand of Vaughan Williams Road and has lived in Thundersley for many years. I know this because I met them both at a reunion at LHR sometime before it was demolished. Bugger ! – she was my girlfriend for a week or two !\n\nDo you remember? : Mr Lane by Keith Nock added 22/10/2011\n\nHi I wonder if anyone remembers Mr Lane he was my rural science teacher at Laindon High Road school, his nickname was Bronco. I remember he had this large slipper which he hit you with, with great force\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Lane by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 25/10/2011\n\nYes, I remember Mr Lane from LHR – think his name was Ted? One of the old time type of teachers. I would like to know more about him. Someone somewhere told me he used to be a boxer and just wonder how true this was? And what about the mad Raymond Wood the music teacher who would play the death march on the piano if he was in a bad mood!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Lane by Anne Burton added 26/10/2011\n\nYes, I remember Mr Lane very well. Not only did he teach the boys about gardening (he liked soil to be called soil, not dirt); he was also the main maths teacher and used a snooker cue to wack miscreants. I expect his nickname was from the t.v. western about Bronco Lane but this was well after my time at the school.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Lane by Richard Haines added 26/10/2011\n\nMr Bronco Lane, we had him for Rural Science. I wish he was around now to help me with my back garden, he would have made short work of it. A subject I found really tedious back then and even moreso now. I think he lived near the school, that was the rumour then. About Mr Wood, I agree, quite mad and the description of him hitting a girl’s arm on this site thoroughly confirms it. He did let us bring in Bobby Vee records though, just to hear what popular music was about.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Lane by Gloria Sewell added 01/11/2011\n\nOh yes Mr Lane, I only remember him as the Maths teacher completely bald with a very bad attitude or maybe that was me, because no matter how hard I tried I could not conquer Maths and yet I was top of the class for arithmetic. The X=Y pied no way did I ever get it, in fact he told me I was the only pupil of his that was in the top A class and scored 0 out of 100 for Maths. He put me in the defaulters book once for having my elbows on the desk. Miss Harris told me I had to say sorry, my reply was no because although I put my elbows on the desk he put me in the book so we were even. I got detention for that but I did not apologise. As I said in my teen article i am afraid I was a bit of a rebel in the last year. To many fantastic changes going on in the world i’m afraid I wanted to get out there amongst it. Even then I would rather have been taught metalwork than cookery, strange I do believe this is the case now and girls do get the chance. I must say Germaine Geer was a big influence in my life.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Lane by Brian Baylis added 18/12/2011\n\nI remember Bronco, and can honestly say I could not stand the man for his way of speaking to us.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Lane by Isabel Smith added 12/04/2014\n\nYes I remember Mr Lane he taught Maths when I was at Laindon High Road in the 50’s. You were lucky he only hit you with a slipper as when he taught our class he had a billiard stick which he used to thump the desk with – quite scary! I think he must have broken it! I believe he had been a rugby player, but open to correction on that one!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Mr Lane by Donald Joy added 25/08/2015\n\nYeah Keith I remember “Bronco” only too well ! Our class lesson of Rural Science with him on one occasion started with all us boys sat on the wall outside the dining hall. I think we were being told what the days lesson would consist of ? Another Keith, Keith English called out “Bronco” which apparently upset Mr Lane. He then had each one of us in turn call out to him the name “Bronco” from which he deduced that mine matched that of the culprit ! I don’t recall the punishment but I reckon it was the usual defaulters slip culminating in yet another caning. The name “Bronco” came from a long running television series of the time called “Laramie”. A western that featured two main characters Bronco Laine and Jess Harper which oddly enough is who my younger brother was named after. So a lasting reminder of Mr Lane !\n\nDo you remember? : St Nicholas youth fellowship photo by Ken Porter added 23/10/2011\n\nHarry Rossiter has sent me this letter to see if anybody can trace a St Nicholas youth fellowship photo : -. Hi Ken. I spoke to you a while ago about a photograph taken of the church youth fellowship just before the war 1938 or 1939. Could you do me a great favour and have the following inserted in the St Nicholas parish magazine.. Has anybody a copy of a photo taken by the main entrance to St Nicholas Church just before WW2 of the St Nicholas youth fellowship with the rector Rev. Michael Lake. This after all is a slice of church history. I’ll list the names of those I remember who were in the photo. Some went off to war never to return. I was one of the lucky ones who did return from my RAF flying.. John Lock, Gwen Churchill (they married later) Vic Nunn, Eric Jee, Doreen Moorcroft, Margery Wise, Iris Hewett, Hilda and Dorothy Harber, Des Haley, James Day, Fran Cock and me Harry Rossiter. There are others whose names I forgot.. etc, etc,. Yours sincerely . Harry Rossiter\n\nDo you remember? : Re: St Nicholas youth fellowship photo by Patricia Smith(Franklin) added 01/11/2011\n\nI do not know about the photograph you mention but see the name James Day in your list. If this is the person I am thinking of he went to Palmers boys school in Grays and after the war returned as a curate at St Nicholas church. You might be interested to know that when we moved to our present address in Heckington, Lincolnshire, Canon James Day was the rector of St Andrews, our church here!\n\nDo you remember? : Laindon Fur and Feather Society by John Lambert added 24/10/2011\n\nMy family were resident in the plotlands area as it was known. My Uncle ‘Bill’ – William Lambert was chair of the Laindon Fur & Feather Society for some years. My Grandad, ‘Jack’ Lambert received Maundy money for his services to the St John Ambulance – have you any history surrounding the LF & FS? I have pictures etc.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Laindon Fur and Feather Society by Mary Saunderson (née Luton) added 09/06/2013\n\nHi John,. When I was a kid, I was an ardent member of the fur and feather club. It was held in he Laindon Memorial Hall, and there was a junior and senior devision, and the shows were on a Saturday, three or four times a year. Sometimes, there would be a guest speaker at the meetings. I used to regularly exhibit and somewhere in the loft have a stack of red cards (first prize) for a flemish giant rabbit. I really enjoyed it.. I believe that Jack Lambert was also a leading member of the St John’s Ambulance Brigade. I belonged to that as well.\n\nDo you remember? : Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 30/10/2011\n\nSomeone mentioned that he had a black and cream Dansette record player. Ian has scanned my photo of our black and cream Dansette record player that we bought in 1962. It did not have a model name but may have just been called a Dansette Hi-Fi.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Richard Haines added 01/11/2011\n\nAndrea, Yes it was me who had the Dansette my mum bought it for me in December 1961 in Town Square Basildon. Before that we had an Alba which did not have such a good sound. The Dansette had a cream body and front with the lift up lid in black, two knobs (for volume and tone) who needs an ipod? Among the first records I bought for it were ‘Weekend’ by Eddie Cochran and ‘Take good care of my Baby’ by Bobbie Vee.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Trevor Reynolds added 01/11/2011\n\nHi Andrea yes I can recall having a Dansette radio gram that went to every party in Laindon in the 60s. I can’t remember throwing it out as I still had it in the late 70s just changed the needle and it went on for ever. It also picked up Radio Luxembourg loud but not clear as it always drifted then returned. Aren’t you glad we moved from next door just as rock n roll was starting!!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 03/11/2011\n\nHi Trev; every time I hear Floyd Cramer I think of your brother Terry – he would play it over and over again – I loved it too – still do!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Joan Baterip added 03/11/2011\n\nbelieve it or not, we bought a Dansette Tempo record player at a boot sale a couple of years ago for £3.00 it works as well !! we bought it to test out our 45’s before putting them on our juke box. I did have a Dansette in the 60’s but over the years can’t remember what happened to it, can remember playing Beatnik Fly at the loudest volume though. Our juke box is an original 1958 Worlitzer which takes 100 45’s, and they are all 60’s records. I think we are trying to recapture our youth !! but we do really enjoy 60’s music. This Dansette is green and cream with the two large dials on the front, it even has the label inside with the full address of Dansette in Stanmore middx. What a bargain !!!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 03/11/2011\n\nRichard, when you see the photo you will see I am clasping an LP of Sonny Terry & Brownie McGhee but most of our collection of Elvis, Buddy and that type.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 04/11/2011\n\nHi Trev. No, not glad, enjoyed Terry playing Floyd Cramer day in and day out – great!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 04/11/2011\n\nRichard, hopefully you will see the picture soon – that will bring back memories for you! I was holding an LP of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee – loved them but not as much as rock n roll!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Richard Haines added 06/11/2011\n\nJoan, I like your taste in music. I remember buying Down Yonder with Sheba on the back, on holiday from Laindon in Lowestoft. I also had Beatnik Fly, Ja -Da and Old Smokie. Dansette must have been the Sony of the 1960s. I’ve also got some 78s of Jerry Lee Lewis, even Blue Suede Shoes by Carl Perkins, those Dansettes played anything.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 07/11/2011\n\nHi Joan, we have tried so many times to buy the same Dansette on ebay but price got too high every time. We have settled for a repro so that we can at least play all our 78’s, 45’s,. EPs and LPs; not bad sound and our Sunday morning breakfast’s are great now – going back in time!. By the way Joan, do you have a brother David? If so, we were the couple who took over his flat in Powell Road, do you remember it?\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Joan Baterip added 08/11/2011\n\nHi Richard, thank you for your comments, my husband is the real music fan in our family especially Jeff Beck, and although we do like some of the music of today, you can’t beat the 60’s, do you listen to “sounds of the sixties” on radio 2? it’s on every Saturday morning from 8 til 10am still with Brian Matthews !!. And thank you Andrea, yes Dave is my brother, and yes I do remember the flat in Powell Road, as I used to have my lunch there when I was at Laindon High Road School. My brother and his wife Doris moved from there to Victoria Road, where they still live. I can’t wait to tell them about you moving into Powell Road, thank you so much kind regards Joan.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Richard Haines added 10/11/2011\n\nHey Joan, yes I like the Brian Matthews show on Saturdays, it reminds me of being in Laindon when I was a kid listening to Saturday Club (how old is Brian anyway?). I can recall, he always played out with the number one – once it was Elvis singing Its Now or Never, fantastic but I got told off by mum for turning the volume up on the wireless too loud (all of Nichol Road can hear that!!). I also remember him interviewing a young group called the Beatles in early 1963 and wondering why they talked in a weird accent, nothing like us of course – I’ve never lost my Barking accent all my life. Andrea you should ask Trev Reynolds if he remembers going to see the film The Young Ones with Cliff and the Shadows at Southend Odeon in 1962 with me. Happy Days werent they.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 13/11/2011\n\nHi Joan, tell David we loved that little flat and made it our little nest for about four years. Regarding Brian Matthews, yes, we listen to SOTS too! Also on a Saturday night if we are at home we turn on BBC Essex and listen to Rock n Roll Heaven at 6pm for two hours – its really good – takes us back in time – which would have been spent in dear old Laindon.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 17/12/2011\n\nRichard – Brian Matthew was born in 1928 and still going strong. Trev may read this and reply about 1962 – the year I stopped living next door to him (got married). As far as music goes, fortunately our music is still played and sounds wonderful. Just listening to Brenda Lee on Rock n Roll Heaven BBC Essex uuuummmm.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Dansette Record Player by Andrea Ash (née Pinnell) added 22/12/2011\n\nStill on about the Dansette – tomorrow 23/12/11 BBC Essex on Steve Scruton Show they will be discussing Dansettes. I won’t be able to listen so if anyone does, would you please let me know what they say about it. Thanks.\n\nDo you remember? : Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 02/11/2011\n\nIn the 50s we had a fergerson Radiogram in a beautiful polished wood cabinet you lifted the top and there was the player with the stick through the middle where you stacked 3 or 4 records 78s the arm used to go back to release one and then forward to play with a saffire needle. My mum used to polish it every day it was her pride and joy I will never forget the sound of Johny Ray Cry, little white cloud that cried, Yes tonight Josephine, Franky Lane Jezerbel, Alma Cogan Twenty tiny fingers, Jim Reeves love letters in the sand. And my first ever record i bought Elvis Presley Heartbreak Hotel,I can still see us all trying to get the little saffire needle in the arm fun days …\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Richard Haines added 06/11/2011\n\nGloria, you know your Ferguson radiogram was very sought after back then. My first record player was a little Alba portable which played one record only and didnt switch off at the end. It was red and cream and I loved it. Then I heard my cousin Christine’s Pye Black Box and realised I needed to upgrade. Thats when mum went over to Basildon and bought my Dansette. Do you remember C’mon Everybody by Eddie Cochran? The beginning bit of that always sounded good !\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 08/11/2011\n\nOh yes the god of rock halls “come on every body and lets get together tonight, got some money in my jeans and really got to spend it right” blaring out, windows open o dear neighbours loved me, Fred and the gang 😮\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Nina Burton added 08/11/2011\n\nI agree with you – music in the 50s was great. Especially when skiffle came along, followed by rock and roll. (Love Letters in the Sand was sung by Pat Boon). My brother Dennis was a terrific Lonnie Donegan fan. I was about 10 years old then. When I started at LHR in 1957, the 4th year boys had a skiffle group. I saw them walking down the corridor with a washboard and home made double base (box with a pole and one string). My sister’s first 78″ record was ‘Great Balls of Fire’ by Jerry Lee Lewis. I was a great Marti Wilde fan and was glued to ‘Six Five Special’ on Saturdays. I had photos of Marti stuck to the inside of my desk lid at school. I also loved Cliff Richard, especially his first hit ‘Move it’. The first record I bought was “Shaking all Over” by Johnny Kidd and the Pirates (approx 1960). I went to see Marti Wilde’s “50 Years of Rock and Roll” anniversary concert at the Paladium in 2007. I can be seen on the DVD of that concert, sitting in the audience with a big smile on my face. It was sheer magic and he had some fantastic guests. Jet Harris, Big Jim Sullivan, Bruce Welch, Hank Marven, Justin Heyward and both his daughters, Kim Wilde and Roxanne Wilde. I still like going to see the golden oldens when they do the rounds. Marti, Joe Brown etc. I went to see Cliff’s ‘From a Distance’ concert at Wembley in the 80s but the tickets for his latest concerts are mega expensive. I also enjoyed all the music that my children liked in the 80s and 90s. Depache Mode, Aha, Police, Craftworks, Oasis, Erasure etc etc. But nothing beats the 50s and 60s – Long Live Rock and Roll!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 10/11/2011\n\nNina and Richard what was the programe called where they played a record and the panel voted on it? There was a blonde girl that always said (this is not my usual misspelling its the way she said it) owll gi it fove I’ll give it 5.. Editor: I remember that one Gloria, it was “Juke Box Jury”.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Richard Haines added 10/11/2011\n\nFred’s record was ‘I got a woman mean as she can be, some-a times I think she’s almost mean as me’ by Jerry Lee. My one was ‘He’s a rebel cos he never ever does what he should’ one of Lin’s favourites, the Crystals. All good stuff when youre 16 and at LHR. Another one I remember Fred and Pam playing was Stagger Lee, remember? I ‘ve got them all on CDs now for the car, Eddies greatest hits !!\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Nina Burton added 11/11/2011\n\nOur radiogram was a German make, Blau Punct (which I believe means blue spot). My parents bought it from Gamages in Romford around 1958. We’d only been connected to the electricity in 1957. It was compact and very good quality with a flat top and a dropdown front door which revealed the record player. The radio tuner was in the middle and the speakers at the bottom. The radio had a fantastic tone and in the early sixties, it sometimes picked up Laindon Police messages. We wondered what was breaking through until we realised it was a patrol car responding to a shout. Apparently, that kept happened to many radiogram owners in the area around that time, causing the Police to swiftly change to a different frequency. I recently found a photo of my dad sitting by that radiogram. I had to smile when I saw it, as not only did mum keep it highly polished, she also kept a potted spider plant on top, sitting on a lacy doily. No, her name wasn’t Mrs Bucket, it was Mrs Burton.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Nina Burton added 11/11/2011\n\nHi Gloria. I agree with the Editor – Juke Box Jury. I can add the girls name – Janice Nicholls. (I used to think David Jacobs was pleasant but a bit pompous). Do you remember the programme ‘Boy meets Girl’ where Una Stubbs and others used to dance to pop music. In those days black and white kids weren’t allowed to dance together. One week it was decided to allow Una to dance with a black boy – a first for TV. I was about 11 years old then and really into the great new music of the times.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Richard Haines added 12/11/2011\n\nNina, trust you to out-trump us all with a Blaupunkt radiogram. These were the best ones around, my cousin Frank who then lived in Canning Town had one shortly after he got married and I can remember him demonstrating it to us by turning the wick up a bit and playing Dreamin’ by Johnny Burnette. It was no good pestering mum though because she had already bought the Dansette for me in Basildon.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 14/11/2011\n\nOh guys talking about 50s 60s pop is the tops do you recall in 1964 Sir Jimmy Saville put on a show called “Top of the pops” (only kidding I know you will remember, it was on wednesday evening and one of the first artist to perform was my all time favorites The Rolling Stones “I wanna be your man”, Dave Clark 5 a local band also performed on that first show. It’s said the show was booked for 6 episodes, it went on to broadcast 1800. Other djs on the early shows I recall were Pete Murry, Alan Freeman and David Jacobs. What about the girls “Pans People”, if I remember right a local girl was a dancer in the group but I can’t recall who, just that they were fantastic my great love as a teen was dancing. The one I remember best from Pans People was Sarah Brightman and she went on to be a great singer. Oh I could go on forever about this era never to be forgotten never to come again. By the way the no. 1 that week was another “wanna record” The Beatles “I wanna hold your hand”.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Nina Burton added 16/11/2011\n\nGreat times. Just a couple of things. Sarah Brightman danced with Eileen Phillips’ troup “Hot Gossip”, not Pan’s People. The local girl was Sandy (Pearl) Penson who danced with Dougie Squires troup “The Second Generation”. The Dave Clark 5 were the resident group in the early days of the Mecca in Basildon – later to become Rachels. I saw many live groups there in the sixties, The Move, Geno Washington and his Ram Jam Band and the Who. The Who were fantastic, but when they trashed the stage at the end, we had to run for our lives. My favourite TV show was ‘Ready Steady Go’ which went out live. I remember The Animals and The Hollies giving some fantastic live performances, among many others of course. There’s nothing quite like it now.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 16/11/2011\n\nHI Nina you are right there is nothing like it now wasn’t it all so great. Sorry to disagree but after Pans People left Top of the Pops, Dee Dee Wilde one of the original dancers kept them going thats when Sarah Brightmen danced with them. She left to join Hot Gossip just before she married Andrew Lloyd Webber and Pans People became Legs & Co. I can’t recall Pearl dancing with them, the girl I was thinking of may have come from Pitsea area, not to sure maybe someone else can help on that. I was quite a Dave Clark follower to it’s a shame the Beatle’s were about at the same time as it took some of thier glory away.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 17/11/2011\n\nAnd yes Nina I do remember R.S.G. also a fantastic programe broadcast by Rediffusion. Cathy McGowan got her big break on it. Did you know Sir Cliff Richards never appeared on there because it was thought he was too popular and he would incite too greater a reaction from the audience (oh dear we were just as naughty then). Also our own Dave Clark bought the surviving recordings of the show, it’s such a shame that many wonderful episodes were wiped including the one where the Who had the whole episode “Ready Steady Who” to themselves. I suppose this was because thier 5.4.3.2.1 opened the show for a long time. Great time to live in Nina, so glad I did. Music and dancing was my passion.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Richard Haines added 17/11/2011\n\nBabs Lord was the ‘looker’ of Pans People. I can just about remember that – cool tall blonde. Dave Clark 5 were good as well, I used to go and watch them in 62/63 with Martin Brown who was in 5x with me, usually on Sunday evenings when things were relatively quiet. This was before any of their hit records. Later when I moved to a different part of Essex I saw The Who, at Chelmsford Corn Exchange and also The Small Faces, The Animals and The Fourmost at Colchester ABC. Quite an experience to look up and see Keith Moon and John Entwhistle drinking in the same bar as us-fantastic days.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Nina Burton added 17/11/2011\n\nGloria. I stand corrected. Sorry – I hadn’t realised Sarah Brightman had done a short stint with Pan’s People. I Googled it to find out more. Apparently she was only 16 and dropped out of school to join but was quickly head hunted by Arlene Philips for Hot Gossip. For some reason I never saw her dance with Pan’s People. I thought their last recruit had been Cherry Gillespie who later went on to dance on Wayne Sleep’s “The Hot Shoe Show “- I loved that. Apparently, Flick Colby, choreographer and co-founder of Pans People, who initially danced with them, moved back to USA, married and ran a gift shop. She died in May 2011 aged 65. As for Sir Cliff Richard – perhaps they were thinking back to his hot sultry performances on Oh Boy when he was aged 18 – apparently, a newspaper at that time wrote “Is this boy too sexy for TV?”. Who would have thought he’d achieve such longed lived success and still be going strong in the business aged 71. Your message about your Ferguson Radiogram certainly started the music memories. Such fun. Best wishes.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Nina Burton added 17/11/2011\n\nGloria. Oh dear! 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 was by Manfred Mann. I’ve got the giggles now. Never mind, two heads are better than one. Between us we get most things right in the end.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 18/11/2011\n\nWhoops Nina I too stand corrected big mistake worth a giggle considering my passion for the 50s and 60s. I’s so sad about Flick Colby I knew she had cancer, when her husband died, such a shame an icon of our era. It was once said of her “she was a true professional never to see the like again”, so true don’t you think Nina. . But lets stay on the Fergason gram theme which mum originally bought for herself to play her Johnny Ray “little white cloud that cried and cried (Double sided) and my favorite “Such a night” so raunchy for the time and of course her “Dick Valentines. But I of course took it over Saturday nights with Everly Brothers and the Righteous Brothers. The favourite for us all then the one that blared on all the grames was of course Twinkle and “terry” made me cry, oh dear were they teenage attention tears maybe.. Mum took me to see Johnny Ray at the London Palladium, Sammy Davies Jr was a supporting act, I recall he sung “That Old Black Magic” that was it loved him forever after that. That was a thrill for a 13 year old, the beginning of a great passion and love for music and great artist. I love this conversation thread keep it up Nina just to show some of the 50year old youngsters what they were missing pre Beatles and Rolling Stones (also fantastic sounds) but we still had the edge right.\n\nDo you remember? : Re: Fergason Radiogram by Gloria Sewell added 27/11/2011\n\nI recalled last nigh"
