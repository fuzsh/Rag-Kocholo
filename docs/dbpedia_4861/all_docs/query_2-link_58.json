        "text": "There. I said it. Let the Glimmerglasswegians and the Santa Fesions rail and\n\nfuss, but OTSL has really got the whole package together: top quality musical\n\nofferings, exciting young singers well on the road to major careers,\n\nwell-considered theatrical stagings that rival any major house (any), and an\n\nextra-musical ambiance that is just about unbeatable. Approaching the house\n\nthrough the lawn area profuse with candle-lit tables, free to any pre-show\n\npicnickers who care to use them, and being able to stay after the show to\n\nparty, applaud, and mingle with the artists in the large Fest tent, well, it is\n\nsort of Glyndebourne without the ‘tude.\n\nAdd to the mix the fact that this troupe has consistently performed their\n\nrepertoire in English, in a small house that fosters great immediacy of the\n\ntheatrical experience, at competitive prices, and, good God, it is ‘popular’\n\nopera! (Even when the title is not of the bread-and-butter variety). True, the\n\nLoretto Hilton lobby is cramped on SRO evenings but. . .there is always a\n\nstroll available on that candle-dotted lawn.\n\nMy recent visit found this resourceful company in its usual fine artistic\n\nform, beginning with as enchanting a production as I imagine possible of\n\nMozart’s Il Re Pastore (The Shepherd King).\n\nWolfgang’s youthful (he was nineteen) work is set to a much-used libretto by\n\nMetastasio, and is of the formulaic opera seria vintage. You know, the kind\n\nthat can be dead boring no matter how well it is performed. Not so here, thanks\n\nto a wholly winning, and dramatically truthful production directed by Chas\n\nRader-Shieber.\n\nFor Mr. R-S has imagined it as a sort of Upstairs Downstairs\n\nepisode with high notes, set in an English country house in a prior century,\n\nwhere a wealthy young woman and her fiance are hosting another well-to-do\n\ncouple for a visit. After perusing the actual score of Re in this\n\nsetting, our heroine becomes committed to the group’s enacting the story as the\n\nday’s entertainment, assigning roles to not only the other society figures, but\n\nalso to the bustling servants.\n\nThis giddy, play-acting atmosphere yielded impressive results, not only in\n\nfilling the story with meaningful (and not distracting) stage business, but\n\nalso allowing for emotional honesty and invention in the many (usually) static\n\nset pieces of this genre. It did not hurt that David Zinn’s set was one of the\n\nmost beautiful I can recall on this St. Louis stage, impeccably dressed. Nor\n\nthat Robert Perziola’s classy costumes spoke volumes in defining the character\n\nrelationships, and clarifying plot absurdities, including one\n\ndrop-dead-gorgeous beaded gown for “Arminta.”\n\nBut all this technical brilliance would have been for naught without a top\n\nnotch cast, and this, too, OTSL delivered in spades. The Gerdine Young Artists\n\ndevelopment program is a model of its kind, and this investment obviously pays\n\noff handsomely as four of the five soloists are former participants.\n\nL to R (foreground): Paul Appleby as Agenore, Daniela Mak as Tamiri, Alek Shrader as Alexander, Heidi Stober as Aminta, and Maureen McKay as Elisa in Il Re Pastore\n\nHeidi Stober was radiant as the young affianced woman who is compelled to\n\nimpersonate the Shepherd King Arminta and enact his plight. Her ample,\n\nwell-schooled, warm lyric soprano blossomed especially above the staff, and her\n\nstage demeanor served up a generous helping of star-quality. Miss Stober was\n\nwell partnered by her “betrothed,” the tenor Alek Schrader, pressed into duty\n\nto play the emperor Alexander. Mr. Schrader has an exceptionally pleasing\n\nMozartean timbre, and his bravura rapid-fire melismatic phrases were\n\nheart-racingly delivered.\n\nMy favorable impression of Maureen McKay in last summer’s Un Cosa\n\nRara was here confirmed with a securely sung Elisa, a maid who briefly\n\nenjoys enacting the longings of a noblewoman. Miss KcKay is capable of regaling\n\nus with accurate cascades of fioritura, likewise deploying her crystal\n\nclear tone in melting legato phrases. Her spunky stage savvy is\n\nequally bewitching. Paul Appleby has fewer fireworks to negotiate in the role\n\nof Agenore (advisor to Alexander, in love with Tamiri), but he sang with style\n\nand panache. As Tamiri, Daniela Mack complemented her cast mates with her\n\nslightly darker rich tone and attention to every musical detail. All five\n\noffered fine English diction, coached on this occasion by soprano Erie\n\nMills.\n\nIn the pit, conductor Jean-Marie Zeitouni discovered all the youthful spirit\n\nand buoyant lyrical possibilities in the score (after a bit of a slack rhythmic\n\nstart in the first few bars), and there was wonderful solo instrumental work as\n\nwell throughout the evening. His conscientious partnering of the singers seemed\n\nto free them to soar through this youthful-but-challenging work.\n\nThe baton was successfully passed the very next night to another conductor\n\nwhose stock is rising, Michael Christie, who helmed a musically rich reading of\n\nThe Ghosts of Versailles, by John Corigliano, libretto by William M.\n\nHoffman. After a sensational debut at the Metropolitan Opera in the early 90’s\n\nwhich was followed by several other revivals in major houses, Ghosts\n\nlanguished, largely (it is believed) owing to the lavish original designs, and\n\nmassive instrumental and vocal forces required.\n\nAt St. Louis, the production team and composer have sought to down-size the\n\npiece to make it more accessible to smaller opera companies. As evidenced here,\n\nthey have been largely successful in their attempt. Corigiliano is a brilliant\n\norchestrator, and his original score took full advantage of the huge pit and\n\nfull band of the Met. Here, Ghosts was re-scored in a new performing\n\nedition commissioned by OTSL and executed by John David Earnest. It was quite a\n\nsuccessful trade-off, and much variety and color remained, many times\n\n(favorably) suggesting the smaller scores of Benjamin Britten. While the\n\ninstrumental presence was almost always ample, there were a few climactic\n\nmoments that seemed a mite under-powered, not least of which was the very final\n\nsting of Act One. These minor quibbles aside, this was a very fine re-working\n\nof the piece, that retained its musical integrity.\n\nKevin J. Glavin as Louis XVI and Maria Kanyova as Marie Antoinette with (at rear l. to r.) Dorothy Byrne as Susanna and Hanan Alattar as Rosina in The Ghosts of Versaille\n\nWe were equally fortunate with the physical production, directed by James\n\nRobinson, with sets by Allen Moyer, costumes by James Schuette, and most\n\nimportant, highly evocative video projections by Wendall K. Harrington. As we\n\nentered the auditorium, we discovered the theatre at Versailles, on stage,\n\nbeing refurbished by a contemporary restoration crew in blue jump suits. That\n\nimage segued into the arrival of the ghosts, attired in lavish period costumes,\n\nand superb wigs/make-up by Tom Watson (a company treasure, he). The first notes\n\nof the score sounded, sans the usual conductor’s entrance, and the lighting\n\nmelded into disorienting video work that transported us to the deserted stage\n\nof long ago, “beyond time” as the program noted. It should be said that Paul\n\nPalazzo provided the uncommonly fine lighting designs for both evening’s\n\nperformances.\n\nOne element of the work that resisted diminution was the large cast demand.\n\nIt took a village to get this work up, and there was great depth in the entire\n\ncast largely thanks (again) to the company’s young artists, who also formed the\n\nchorus under Sandra Horst’s direction. I did find that the dancers contributed\n\nless to the overall dramatic experience than they might have, and elimination\n\nof the dance corps might be a possible further cut-back. The stage got crowded\n\nat times, although Mr. Robinson not only managed the traffic well, but focused\n\nthe important dramatic moments and developed believable characters and strong\n\nrelationships.\n\nWithout creating a laundry list, it is hard to single out all who were\n\nexcellent in this large ensemble cast. Certainly expectations were high for\n\nMaria Kanyova (another former apprentice) as Marie Antoinette, and she did not\n\ndisappoint. Ms. Kanyova has a responsive soprano, with a hint of metal that\n\nstands her in good stead in dramatic segments, but she can also scale her voice\n\ndown to float effective pianissimi that veritably float above the staff. She\n\nwas a worthy successor to the great Teresa Stratas who created the role.\n\nChristopher Feigum was suitably winning as Figaro, although in his first big\n\naria all the acting seemed to be external. The internal spark of creation crept\n\nin sometime during his (quite funny) Act One finale drag moments as the harem\n\ngirl and he remained fully engaged for the rest of night. His pliant, smooth\n\nbaritone gave considerable pleasure and he is a talent to watch.\n\nMr. Corigliano apparently loves his baritones and he created a fine\n\ncomplementary foil in Beaumarchais, well-taken on this occasion by James\n\nWeston. As should be, Mr. Weston has a little more maturity of tone and the\n\nbronze patina of his upper register contributed to a very effective contrast.\n\nHis love for the doomed heroine was wonderfully embodied and his alternately\n\nwitty and sensitive delivery enabled a well-rounded character to emerge.\n\nAs stage characters in the concurrent Figaro comedy, a jewel of an ensemble\n\nworked tightly together in a slightly heightened play-acting style. Samuel Read\n\nLevine (Leon), Paula Murrihy (Cherubino), Sean Panikkar (Almaviva) were all\n\nterrific, with young artist Jeanette Vechhione capturing the most applause for\n\nher technically secure stratospheric singing as Florestine. Hanan Alattar and\n\nDorothy Byrne were exquisite in their limpid lyrical outpouring of the extended\n\nAct Two duet for Rosina and Susanna, a musical high point.\n\nThe real-time bad guys were equally well-served by Lee Gregory, a vocally\n\nassured and physically active (and fearless) Wilhelm, and by stentorian,\n\ntireless tenor (and fine character actor) Matthew DiBattista as Begearss.\n\nElizabeth Batton did everything possible to amuse us in her star turn as\n\nSamira. Originally created for the particular gifts of Marilyn Horne, Ms.\n\nBatton made it her own with plummy tone, a well-modulated chest voice, and\n\nsound technique in the middle and (ringing) upper reaches. Quite a comedian,\n\nshe wisely eschewed the baritonal power of Ms. Horne for an equally successful\n\nand personalized performance.\n\nIf I had to mention only three more performers, I would include the\n\ncharacterful Louis XVI from Kevin J. Glavin, the firm-voiced Marquis of Kevin\n\nPark, and the delightful Woman with Hat sung by Erin Holland.\n\nUpon re-visiting The Ghosts of Versailles I still found it a\n\nparticularly well-calculated mix of old and new styles, in turn challenging and\n\ncomfortable, telling a dramatically satisfying and captivating story of fate\n\nand acceptance. If I still feel that the arias go on a bit longer than needed\n\nto make their musical or dramatic point, they never become uninteresting,\n\nespecially in the hands of such a capable roster of performers.\n\nThis production will go on to fall’s Wexford Festival, and it alone would\n\nmake it worth the trip to Ireland. It deserves many more performances.\n\nJames Sohre\n\nimage=http://www.operatoday.com/11_MG_8719a.gif\n\nimage_description=Alek Shrader as Alexander, Paul Appleby as Agenore, and Daniela Mack as Tamiri (all foreground) with supernumeraries Mark Goff and Elizabeth Zharoff in Opera Theatre of Saint Louis’s 2009 production of Mozart’s IL RE PASTORE.
