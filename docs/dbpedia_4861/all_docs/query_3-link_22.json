        "text": "DorothyPronunciationGenderFemaleOriginWord/nameGreekMeaningGift of GodOther namesRelated namesTheodore, Dottie, Dotty, Theodora, Dorothea, Dolly, Dorothee, Dot, Tia\n\nDorothy is a feminine given name. It is the English vernacular form of the Greek Δωροθέα (Dōrothéa) meaning \"God's Gift\", from δῶρον (dōron), \"gift\" + θεός (theós), \"god\".[1][2] It has been in use since the 1400s.[3] Although much less common, there are also male equivalents in English such as Dory, from the Greek masculine Δωρόθεος (Dōrótheos). Dorofei is a rarely used Russian male version of the name.[4] The given names Theodore and Theodora are derived from the same two Greek root words as Dorothy, albeit reversed in order.\n\nThe name grew in use among Christians due to popular legends surrounding Saint Dorothy of Caeserea. The name was at one time viewed as the English equivalent of the etymologically unrelated Russian name Daria or its diminutive Dasha.[5]\n\nTraditional English diminutives include, among others, Do, Dodi, Dodie, Doe, Doll, Dolley, Dollie, Dolly, Dora, Dori, Dorie, Doro, Dory, Dot, Dottie, Dotty, Tea, Thea, and Tia. Dorothy, with the nickname Doll or Dolly, was quite popular from 1450 to 1570 in England. Dorothy or the variant Dorothea, also with the nicknames Doll or Dolly, was also well used between 1750 and 1820.[6]\n\nThere are also many variants of the name in other languages.\n\nDorothy was a less common variant of Dorothea until it became more common and one of the top 10 most popular names for girls in the United States between 1904 and 1940. The name remained among the top 100 most popular names for American girls until 1961. It briefly left the top 1,000 names for girls in the United States in 2007 but returned in 2011 and has since increased in popularity. In 2022, it ranked 487th among the most used names for newborn girls in the United States, with 642 girls given the name in that year. Variant Dorothea is in occasional use in the United States, where 62 girls were given the name in 2022.[7]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nDorothy Allison (1949–present), American writer\n\nDorothy Arnold (1885–1910), American socialite who disappeared mysteriously\n\nDorothy Arnold (1917–1984), American actress\n\nDorothy Appleby (1906–1990), American actress\n\nDorothy Bernard (1890–1955), American actress\n\nDorothy Christy/Christie (1906–1977), American actress\n\nDorothy \"Dodie\" Clark (1995–present), British singer-songwriter and YouTuber\n\nDorothy Coburn (1905–1978), American actress\n\nDorothy Cross (1956–present), Irish artist\n\nDorothy Dalton (1893–1972), American actress\n\nDorothy Dandridge (1922–1965), American actress\n\nDorothy Davenport (1895–1977), American actress\n\nDorothy Davids (1923–2014), American educator, educational services administrator, and a Native American and women's rights activist\n\nDorothy Day (1897–1980), American journalist, social activist\n\nDorothy Dell (1915–1934), American actress\n\nDorothy Devore (1899–1976), American actress\n\nDorothy Dunbar (1902–1992), American actress\n\nDorothy Dunnett (1923–2001), Scottish historical novelist\n\nDorothy Dwan (1906–1981), American actress\n\nDorothy Ellis (1935–2018), American singer\n\nDorothy Fletcher (1927–2017), New Zealand historian\n\nDorothy Catherine Fontana (1939–2019), screenplay writer\n\nDorothy Garlock (1919–2018) , American author\n\nDorothy Garrod (1892–1968), British archaeologist\n\nDorothy Edna Genders (1892–1978), Australian Anglican deaconess\n\nDorothy Gibson (1889–1946), American actress\n\nDorothy Gish (1898–1968), American actress\n\nDorothy Grant, Haida fashion designer\n\nDorothy Gulliver (1908–1997), American actress\n\nDorothy Hamill (1956–present), American figure skater\n\nDorothy Antoinette Handy (1930–2002), American musician and scholar\n\nDorothy Hodgkin (1910–1994), British biochemist and winner of Nobel Prize in Chemistry\n\nDorothy Iannone (1933-2022), American visual artist\n\nDorothy Janis (1912–2010), American actress\n\nDorothy Misener Jurney (1909–2002), American journalist\n\nDorothy Kelly (1894-1966), American actress\n\nDorothy Kilgallen (1913–1965), American journalist and television game show panelist.\n\nDorothy Bush Koch (1959-present), daughter of United States President George H.
