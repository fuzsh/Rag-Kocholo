        "text": "The development was completed in May 2023, and provides 57 homes for a total of 63 residents aged 65 or over in Southwark.\n\nDesigned by Stirling Prize-winning architects, Witherford Watson Mann, the building provides a blueprint for future adult social housing projects for older persons.\n\nThe recent Almshouse Longevity Study (opens new window) found that living in an almshouse can boost a resident’s lifespan by as much as two and a half years. Appleby Blue represents a progressive evolution of this typology - it flips the conventional model of the almshouse as a retreat from society, built in the outer environs as an inward-looking development, firmly on its head. Located in the heart of Bermondsey with a bus stop right outside and the hustle and bustle of inner-city living, Appleby Blue enables its residents to remain active members of a thriving, intergenerational and diverse London community.\n\nFeatures\n\nThe building is designed to connect residents through its porous nature and welcoming floorplan, cultivating a strong sense of community and reducing loneliness. The 2-5 storey design enables a cascading level of interaction between the surrounding community and the almshouse residents. A luscious roof terrace includes raised beds for growing herbs and vegetables. The detail of the project is impressive, with raised beds created with residents in mind, to enable recreational gardening activities despite varying mobility levels.\n\nThe main communal space, the Garden Room, opens on to a planted garden court with a raised water feature running throughout, designed by Grant Associates. It forms the traditional almshouse courtyard style centre of the building, offering a space for residents and visitors to socialise or relax in peace and quiet. The acoustics of the space coupled with the sound of the water feature creates a relaxing, sanctuary-like space for residents and visitors, whilst remaining just a few feet away from the local transport links that keep them connected to the city.\n\nCommunity\n\nThe resident support model for the almshouse is integral to the physical environment and place. The team works closely with the Appleby Blue Centre Manager to create a holistic support plan which encompasses repairs and maintenance, benefits guidance and health and wellbeing. Appleby Blue also offers residents a library area, hobby room and skills room, where events from crochet lessons to digital skills sessions will be hosted for both residents as well as the wider community. The intergenerational use of the building aims to break down the barriers between young and old.\n\nThe Appleby Blue community kitchen sits at the heart of the building, as a kitchen should, with United St Saviour’s Charity running culinary-based community projects with local organisations to foster intergenerational connectivity in Southwark and provide important upskilling opportunities for young people in the borough.\n\nUnited St Saviour’s is working alongside research partners at Bournemouth University to explore how multigenerational socially inclusive activities can be co-created with older people around food growing, cooking and meal sharing to improve their health, wellbeing and social connectedness."
