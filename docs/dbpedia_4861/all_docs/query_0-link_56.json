        "text": "Olsen and Johnson - The \"Hellzapoppin'\" Boys\n\nOle Olsen and Chic Johnson were vaudeville comedians who eventually went on to Broadway, movies, radio and television. Their act originally consisted of playing musical instruments while interjecting jokes. They eventually developed their show into a revue of zany gags, known as blackouts, and their advertising would state \"anything can happen, and it probably will\".\n\nBelow is a photo, Olsen on the left and Johnson on the right.\n\nTheir most famous revue is \"Hellzapoppin'\", which featured all kinds of gags, mayhem, audience participation, etc. This revue was on Broadway and eventually made into a movie in 1941, starring Olsen and Johnson, but featuring dozens of others in various roles, including many cameos.\n\nI'd seen \"Hellzapoppin'\" on tv during the 1960s and it became one of my all-time favorite comedies, along with Olsen and Johnson as one of my all-time favorite comedy teams. They didn't make too many movies, and some years had passed before others were shown on tv or became available on video. Two other zany comedies of theirs are \"Crazy House\" (1943) and \"Ghost Catchers\" (1944). Below are a couple of scenes from the latter.\n\nBoth men died shortly before I became initially active in collecting autographed photos (Johnson in 1962 and Olsen in 1963). When I became very active in the hobby, in the 1970s and 1980s, their autographs were on my \"wanted\" list, if ever they would be offered at a reasonable price.\n\nWell, in the early 1990s, a person in NYC acquired a collection of signed photos and autograph albums from a friend who died. He had little interest in keeping most of them, so decided to sell, as he knew there would be collectors who'd be interested. His prices were very reasonable, quite cheap actually. I bought several from him, at least a few each time he sent me a list.\n\nI bought these signed album pages for $5 each, truly a bargain.\n\nYou can read a well-researched informative article about Olsen and Johnson, by Charles Stumpf, here.\n\nJudy Malcolm - From \"King Kong\" to The Three Stooges\n\nJudy Malcolm was a supporting actress in many short comedies in the 1930s through the late 1940s. I was familiar with her through her appearances in some of The Three Stooges comedies.\n\nHer real name was Marguerite Westergren, born in Buffalo, New York in 1910. Her cousin was a secretary to stage and screen actor Richard Dix, and suggested that Judy go to Hollywood and look into acting. She became very active as an extra and stand-in in features. According to her sister, Audrey Klinshaw, Judy was a stand-in for Fay Wray in 1933's \"King Kong\". In the scene where Wray and Bruce Cabot jump off a cliff into the river below, Judy did the actual jumping. Judy was also seen in some long-shots, in the hands of the giant ape Kong.\n\nShe eventually landed a contract at Columbia Pictures, where she was placed in their stable of supporting players, appearing in two-reel comedies with stars such as Vera Vague, Schilling and Lane, Hugh Herbert, Sterling Holloway, as well as The Three Stooges.\n\nIn 1990, I located her with the assistance of the Screen Extras Guild in Los Angeles. The clerk I talked to, looked up their records on Judy, and found that she took a withdrawal in 1948. They had an address for her, in Buffalo, New York.\n\nNow, I had something to go on, and was hoping that it would not lead me to a dead end, as happens so many times when trying to locate people from many years earlier. I called phone directory assistance in Buffalo, and there was a listing for a Judy Malcolm! I called, and the voice that answered was hesitant when I inquired if she was the actress. For some reason, she thought I was a crank caller. (Her reaction was similar to Dorothy Appleby's when I first called her, too). When I mentioned some of her movie credits, she then relaxed and realized I was legitimate. I invited her to be a guest at The Three Stooges Fan Club Convention in Pennsylvania, in July. She appreciated the interest, but said she was unable to travel because she had arthritis in her spine, and she would not be able to tolerate a long plane, rail or car trip. She was given an award in absentia, and I mailed it to her.\n\nBelow is a note I received from her shortly after my initial call. It's from January 16, 1990:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Cappello - Thank you so very much for your phone calls and lovely letter - They brought back some wonderful times and memories- Most sincerely, Judy Malcolm\".\n\nAnd here's a scene still from a Three Stooges comedy, with Judy on the left, with Curly.\n\nFor whatever reason, I never sent her a photo to autograph, something I regret.\n\nDuring our first conversation, Judy told me she created her own professional name. She always liked the name 'Judy', and her mother's maiden name was 'Malcolm', so she combined them to make her screen name.\n\nJudy died in 1998. I wrote this brief obituary which was published in the Fall 1999 issue of The Three Stooges Journal.\n\nI sent a copy to her sister, Audrey, who wrote this note to me:\n\n\"Dear Mr. Cappello - Today I received your note and the article you wrote about Judy. Thank you so much for your kindness - I really appreciate it.\n\nThe article was right on the money. Really enjoyed reading it. And - it was good to see her with 'the Stooges' again!\n\nI will make copies and send to her 2 nieces and 1 nephew - they all adored her.\n\nThank you again, Mr. Cappello, for remembering - I will treasure it.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nAudrey Klinshaw\".\n\nRobert Benchley\n\nRobert Benchley was a well-known humorist from the early 1920s into the 1940s. He wrote articles and essays for several magazines, including Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, covering topical events, with a humorous and satirical theme, and many of those have been collected in various anthologies over the years.\n\nMr. Benchley was a member of the famous 'Algonquin Round Table', which was a group of writers and actors who would meet weekly at the Algonquin Hotel in New York City during the 1920s and 1930s. Among the members were Dorothy Parker, Alexander Woollcott, George S. Kaufman, Harpo Marx, and Marc Connelly (in 1980, I wrote to Mr. Connelly, and he kindly sent me two photos, which you can see here and here).\n\nMr. Benchley appeared in many movies, as an actor or sometimes a narrator. He also appeared in a series of comedy shorts, in which he'd discuss a variety of subjects. Some titles include \"The Treasurer's Report\", \"The Sex Life of a Polyp\", \"Waiting for Baby\", and \"How to Eat\".\n\nHere's a portrait and a scene still:\n\nFor many years, up to his death in 1945, Mr. Benchley lived in the New York City suburb of Scarsdale, which is about 10 minutes from where I live.\n\nHe was still listed in the telephone directory as of 1971. Actually, the listing was for his widow Gertrude, listed as 'Mrs. Robert Benchley'. I called her and told her of my appreciation of Mr. Benchley's writings, several of which I'd read in books borrowed from my public library. I told her of my collection of autographs and my desire to add one of Mr. Benchley. While she did not have any signed photos, she did have some canceled checks which he had signed. She wrote down my address, and a few days later, I received this letter from her, along with Robert Benchley's signature cut from a canceled check. I suppose she didn't feel secure in sending me the entire check, but anyway, I was happy to receive the signature as is.\n\nMrs. Benchley wrote the incorrect year (1961) on the letter, so just to remind myself of when I actually received it, I wrote the correct year (1971) on the upper left.\n\nRuth Wallis - 'The Saucy Chanteuse'\n\nRuth Wallis began her career in the 1940s as a cabaret singer, but later introduced self-written songs which were risqué and loaded with double entendres (words and phrases with double meanings). She was very classy in her presentation of the songs, and while the songs were \"for adults only\", they were not vulgar in any sense.\n\nI had acquired a small collection of her recordings, which were on her own label. Even though her songs were not vulgar, the topics were not for general open discussion in the 1940s and 1950s. Some of the subjects of the songs included adultery, breasts, transgender, male genitals - well, you get the idea. And if not, here are some titles of a few of her most popular songs which will give you more of an idea - \"Boobs\", \"Drill 'Em All\", \"Ubangi\", \"The Pistol Song\", \"He'd Rather Be a Girl\", \"The Dinghy Song\", and \"The Hawaiian Lei Song\". And if you STILL don't get the idea, just think of double-meanings for each of those titles!\n\nI tried locating her for several years, but it seemed she was no where to be found. I was beginning to think that she may have been long dead, until I read a brief item in the mid-1990s about her being in London preparing a musical revue of her songs (she was not going to appear in it, but she was involved in the production, as the songs were all her own). Then shortly after, the May 1997 issue of Goldmine magazine published a career article by Chuck Miller (this article is a pdf) which mentioned her married name and that she had a \"ranch house in eastern Connecticut\".\n\nI located her address and phone number and called, but her son answered, explaining she was still in London but would be home in a few months. I wrote her a letter, shown below, and waited for a reply.\n\nAbout a month later, I received a vintage signed photo from Ms. Wallis, along with this handwritten letter: \"Dear Bill, Thank you for your lovely letter - We are working on releasing CDs in the very near future - like next week - ha! Regards, Ruth Wallis\".\n\nMore than one year later, in November 1998, I received a surprise in the mail - Ms. Wallis sent me a copy of her CD, \"Boobs - Ruth Wallis' Greatest Hits\".\n\nAfter listening to it, I called her and thanked her. She was very cordial and appreciated my interest and enjoyment of her songs recorded many years earlier.\n\nRuth Wallis died in December 2007, age 87.\n\nHere is a recording of her song \"Johnny Had a Yo-Yo\".\n\nWilliam Powell and Myrna Loy - Forever 'Nick and Nora Charles'\n\nI'm a big fan of comedy movies, especially those of the 1930s and 1940s. Among my favorites are the \"Thin Man\" series of comedy-mysteries.\n\nThe \"Thin Man\" movies starred William Powell and Myrna Loy as 'Nick and Nora Charles'. 'Nick' was a detective who retired after marrying wealthy 'Nora'. He just couldn't stay away from trying to solve murders and other crimes, thanks to being pushed by his wife who also became his \"associate detective\". Their characters were heavy drinkers and some of the humor was focused on alcohol-fueled antics. They also had a little dog, Asta, a wire-haired terrier who accompanied them almost everywhere.\n\nWhen I wrote to Mr. Powell in 1980, he was already long retired, living in Palm Springs. I sent him a couple of photos which he signed with only his name, and there is a slight 'shakiness' in the signature. You can see the photos here and here.\n\nI wrote to Myrna Loy about the same time, and sent her this photo, which she signed and promptly returned. She was living in New York City.\n\nAbout a year later, a friend sent me some glossy photos as a gift, and one was a very nice portrait of Powell and Loy, with Asta. I first sent the photo to Mr. Powell, who signed it, once again with only his name (and he abbreviated 'William' as 'Wm.'), and then to Ms. Loy, who not only signed it from herself, but also from 'Asta'. In my letter to her, I'd asked about the dog's real name, and she wrote this note on the back of the photo: \"The dog's name was Skippy. I don't know when they changed if they did.\" By \"changed\", she was referring to if more than one dog was used over the course of the series.\n\nThe photos signed by Mr. Powell were apparently among the last ones he actually signed, as shortly after, some friends sent him photos and they were returned with a rubber-stamped signature.\n\nFor a series of clips highlighting some of the humor in the movies, look at this YouTube video. And here's another one highlighting the alcohol-related humor.\n\nLouis Feinberg ----- WHO???\n\nYou don't know Louis Feinberg? Sure you do! He's Larry Fine, the frizzy-haired member of The Three Stooges comedy team, my all-time favorites.\n\nI was introduced to The Three Stooges comedies in the late 1950s, when the short movies were packaged for tv broadcast. In New York, they were shown on WPIX Channel 11, and hosted by 'Officer' Joe Bolton. I became a fan very quickly, and eventually saw the entire output of the Stooges, as their movies were shown many times over the next several years, with various hosts ('Captain' Jack McCarthy and 'Fireman' Todd Russell being two others).\n\nDuring the third week of August of 1973, I took my first solo long-distance vacation (previous vacations were always with family, and never actually more than a hundred or so miles from home base). I went to Los Angeles for a week, staying at the famous Ambassador Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard.\n\nAmong the many things I crammed into that week, was a visit to Larry Fine, who was residing in the Motion Picture Country Home in Woodland Hills, in a private room in the Lodge section. He'd been there for a few years, since suffering a stroke which left him with paralysis of his left side and somewhat slurred speech. Larry was very open to visits from fans, and when I called him and asked when I could visit, he said \"Any afternoon is ok.\" He then proceeded to give me driving directions from downtown Los Angeles to Woodland Hills!\n\nMy visit with Larry was very pleasant. I was expecting to see him as he appeared in the movies, with his \"frizzy hair\", and was taken aback when I saw him with his hair combed back smoothly, sitting in a wheelchair, slightly slumped to his left. But he stood up upon my entering the room, shook my hand and welcomed me, and then sat down again, and I felt better, that I wasn't being an intrusion. We had a very nice talk, about many things - the history of the Stooges, vaudeville, other movie comedians, some of the supporting players in the Stooges movies, personal appearances, etc.\n\nI told Larry I'd seen the Stooges in person twice, when they toured nationwide with a couple of their features in the 1960s. I mentioned the name of the cinema, Proctor's, in my hometown of Mount Vernon, and he said \"We played there in vaudeville with Ted Healy in the 1920s and '30s. We also played the Proctor's in New Rochelle, Yonkers, and White Plains.\" Those are nearby cities, and I was amazed at his memory of the geography. The stroke affected him physically, but apparently it did not impair his mental faculties, not during my visit.\n\nI'd brought with me a 35mm Nikkormat camera, loaned by my good friend Jack. I took a couple of pictures of Larry, and asked a passing nurse to take a picture of Larry and me. When I returned home, I sent him copies of the snapshots, but it wasn't until I moved to Los Angeles in 1974, that I visited him again, and he signed the 8x10s I printed in the photo lab at my workplace. Here's a close-up, a shot showing the wall of pictures in his room, and Larry and me.\n\nI told Larry I had some of their movies in 16mm format, and one title that interested him was \"Three Little Pigskins\". He asked me if I'd make a copy for him, as he occasionally would go to local high schools and colleges and show a couple of movies, after which he'd talk to the audience.\n\nI gladly had a duplicate made and sent it to Larry as a gift, my way of thanking him for his cordiality when I visited him. He sent me this letter, which is not dated, but was written in October of 1973, shortly after his birthday:\n\nHere's a transcription, since it may be a bit difficult to read as shown:\n\n\"Dear Bill,\n\nReceived the film 'Three Little Pigskins' today and was surprised and very pleased. I never realized you meant to give me the film as a gift, and I am very very grateful. Believe me I didn't act gracious to you for any ulterior motive, but because you seemed genuinely interested in the 3 Stooges, and therefore deserved my attention and respect as a loyal fan. Am looking forward to the pictures you took, and sincerely hope you get out to California again.\n\nNice of you to remember my birthday.\n\nHow do you like the stationery. That was drawn by and made for me, by a fan in Seattle, Washington. I guess I'm just lucky.\n\nAgain thank you for the film, and if there is anything I can do for you, please let me know.\n\nGratefully yours, Larry Fine\"\n\nBelow are Christmas cards I received from Larry, in 1973 and 1974, respectively.\n\nThe latter was mailed to me when I was living in North Hollywood. Larry's handwritten note inside the card reads:\n\n\"Dear Bill, Not writing any fan mail lately. Wrote this to you so you would know why you don't hear from me. Don't feel so good. Wishing you a Happy New Year. Sincerely, Larry\".\n\nLarry's health was declining, and he died little more than a month later, January 24, 1975, from a massive stroke.\n\nIn 1994, at a Three Stooges Fan Club Convention, I had the pleasure of meeting Larry's sister Lyla, and her husband Nate Budnick.\n\nMuriel Landers\n\nThe first time I saw Muriel Landers, was in a Three Stooges comedy, \"Sweet and Hot\" (1958). Her character was 'Tiny' Landers, and the plot had her not joining a nightclub act because she was afraid to perform in front of people. She was cured of her stage fright with hypnosis and gave a rousing singing and dancing performance.\n\nWhile living in North Hollywood in the mid-1970s, one thing I did during my spare time was locating people who'd worked with The Three Stooges. The first source I'd check was the local telephone directory (actually, the Greater Los Angeles Area had several directories, so I'd start with my local one, and then look into others).\n\nMuriel Landers was listed, with two phone numbers but no street address. I called the first number and her recognizable voice answered. I told her of my interest in her appearance with the Stooges, and she was quick to invite me over to visit. She gave me her address, on Hazeltine Avenue in Van Nuys, and soon I was there, enjoying an entertaining conversation with her over a cup of coffee and piece of home-made cake. (I later learned from Muriel's sister, actress Janice Davies, the cake was \"Muriel's Strawberry Wine Cake\", the only cake Muriel ever made. According to Janice, Muriel was \"famous for it among her friends\". Janice provided me with the recipe, shown here):\n\nI was familiar with some of Muriel's acting other than with the Stooges, including a touching dramatic role in the \"Twilight Zone\" episode 'A Piano in the House' (1962). I also remembered seeing her on the sketch comedy show \"Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In\" (1968) and some other assorted tv shows.\n\nAt the time I met her, she was not in the best of health, plagued by high blood pressure and diabetes. Yet, she was very lively and fun to be with. I visited her several times, a couple of times even grocery shopping for her (she'd ask if I could do the favor, and she gave me a list and the cash). Her mother Sylvia lived with her, as well as her three Pug dogs.\n\nMuriel had an assortment of glossy photos lying around her living room, and when I asked for an autographed picture, she chose this one. She used a ballpoint pen to inscribe the photo, and it \"skipped\" a bit, as such pens will do on a glossy surface. The inscription reads: \"To Bill, All Best Wishes to My Number 1 Fan!!\"\n\nOne sunny day, when she was showing me the garden and little chapel behind the house, I took two pictures of us together. (This was done by setting the timer after propping the camera on an outdoor wall). Muriel loved to 'mug' for the camera, as seen here and here.\n\nI moved back to New York in May of 1976, but kept in touch with Muriel by phone and mail. Her health continued to deteriorate until she suffered a stroke in February of 1977 and died. Her mother called me with the sad news. She sent me a funeral program, shown below.\n\nOn a side note: Several months later, when talking to Janice, she told me that she called several of Muriel's friends to invite them to the funeral service. Besides Ray Bolger and Iris Adrian, both of whom spoke at the service, she called Jack Haley (the 'Tin Man' in \"The Wizard of Oz\"). Haley's wife Flo answered the phone, and when told of the date of the funeral, asked Janice if she could re-schedule it for the following day because she had a beauty parlor appointment that day! Janice was momentarily stunned at Flo's insensitivity, then had a few words with her. I won't repeat what she told me, but the Haleys did not attend Muriel's service.\n\nMae West\n\nAnother of my earliest autographed photos was Mae West. I'd seen her in a couple of movies on tv. I remember one had W.C. Fields as her co-star, in \"My Little Chickadee\" (1940), and the other was \"She Done Him Wrong\" (1933).\n\nEven at the young age of 12, I could appreciate Mae West's double entendres (phrases with double meanings). Maybe I was \"reading\" more into what she was saying, being on the verge of adolescence, but whatever, I enjoyed seeing her.\n\nI don't remember for certain how I obtained her address, but I think it was in a reference book I found at my public library, \"The Celebrity Register\". It gave her home address, 570 N. Rossmore Avenue, in Los Angeles, which was actually an apartment building, The Ravenswood, she owned. I wrote her a letter, requesting a photo, and she sent me this post-card size picture. Note her writing of the word \"sincerely\", as \"Sin-cerely\", keeping true to form.\n\nMany years later, I read a news item which mentioned she had a listed phone number. I had a paper phone directory for Los Angeles, looked up her name, and sure enough, she was listed! I worked up the nerve to call her, but the number was actually for the management office. I asked if I could speak for a minute with Miss West, and was politely told she did not take calls from fans, but sometimes she'd make an exception if they called on her birthday. As her birthday was several months away, I forgot all about it, and never did call again.\n\nI missed my chance to hear her say to me (quoting a line from one of her movies): \"Why don't you come sometime and see me?\"\n\nLucy and Desi\n\nOn weekday mornings, in the early 1960s, while waiting to leave for school, among the tv shows my sister and I would watch, was \"I Love Lucy\". The show was in syndication by then, and the episodes were repeated time after time, and it got to the point where we'd eventually know much of the dialog.\n\nIn 1982, I wrote to both Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. Both had been long-divorced, and remarried to others.\n\nMs. Ball signed this photo I sent her with a very simple inscription. I'd like to believe she really signed it and that it's not a secretarial. I'd heard she was responsive to fans' requests for autographs, and I believe it to be true, because it took about three months for this to be returned.\n\nMr. Arnaz sent me a letter, advertising the newly-released record album of music from the \"I Love Lucy\" tv show. He also signed the photo I sent to him.\n\nI did see Lucille Ball in person, in 1963. It was in the days when movie stars made personal appearances in cinemas around the country, in conjunction with their current feature movie. Bob Hope was with Ms. Ball when they appeared on-stage at my local RKO Proctor's cinema, interrupting the showing of their movie \"Critic's Choice\". Gary Morton, Ms. Ball's husband, also came onto the stage and was introduced, then quickly left. Their total time on stage was less than 10 minutes. They did some comedy banter, then answered a few questions from the audience. Finally, they asked everybody to look under their seats, and if a large white card was found, that person received a copy of the book the movie was based on. I recall six people walked up to the stage and were handed their prize by the stars. I did take a few pictures, but they didn't come out because the flash was not bright enough for photography from about 100 feet away.\n\nBela Lugosi --- My Very First Autograph Request\n\nMy very first request for an autographed photo was from Bela Lugosi, star of \"Dracula\" (1931) and several other Universal Pictures 'horror' and 'suspense' movies. In early 1963, when I was a few months away from 11 years of age, I'd seen \"Dracula\" on television, and was enthralled by it. I especially liked Lugosi's portrayal, with his sinister facial expressions and heavily accented tone of voice.\n\nI'd heard about movie stars sending autographed pictures to their fans, and after asking a few adults how to get such pictures, I wrote a letter to Mr. Lugosi, told him how much I liked \"Dracula\", and asked for an autographed photo. I addressed the envelope to \"Bela Lugosi, Hollywood, California\" (ZIP Codes were not required at that time, and as for sending the letter to Hollywood, I'd been told \"that's where all the movie stars live\").\n\nA week or so later, the envelope was returned to me, with the rubber-stamped postal markings \"Unknown at Hollywood Station\" and \"Insufficient Address\". I was confused about this, and showed it to my Mother. She told me Bela Lugosi had been dead for many years. I remember being shocked upon hearing it! If only I'd told her a few weeks earlier that I was writing a letter to him, she could have told me the \"bad news\" and stopped me from wasting a 5-cents postage stamp! She felt sorry for me, though, and bought the photo below, from a magazine ad.\n\nI was a regular reader of the 'Famous Monsters of Filmland' magazine, and Movie Star News, a NYC photo dealer, advertised monthly. Here is one of their ads, from the April 1963 issue. Note the price for a glossy 8x10 photo - 50 cents! Plus only 25 cents for postage! (Movie Star News is still in business, and they have an internet site too, but their prices are somewhat higher).\n\nMany years later, in 1995, I had the opportunity to meet Lugosi's son, Bela Jr., at a Three Stooges Fan Club Convention in Pennsylvania. He was attending to scope out the event, as he was an attorney/associate of Comedy III Productions, which maintained licensing rights to The Three Stooges.\n\nI brought along a couple of movie stills of his father, and after explaining to him the aforementioned disappointment of my youth, asked him to sign the photos. Here's one of his dad in a standard pose as \"Dracula\" , and here's a scene from \"Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\".\n\nRoy Thinnes - Fighting \"The Invaders\"\n\nOne of the best science-fiction tv shows of the 1960s was \"The Invaders\". It was on for only two seasons, premiering in early 1967. The show starred Roy Thinnes as an architect, David Vincent.\n\nEach show opened with a few minutes prologue scenes of that week's episode, and then this dialog was heard over the opening titles:\n\n“The Invaders. Alien beings from a dying planet. Their destination: the earth. Their purpose: to make it THEIR world.\n\n“David Vincent has seen them. For him, it began one lost night on a lonely country road, looking for a shortcut. It began with a closed, deserted diner, and a man too long without sleep to continue his journey. It began with the landing of a craft from another galaxy.\n\n“Now, David Vincent knows that the Invaders are here, that they have taken human form. Somehow he must convince a disbelieving world that the nightmare has already begun . . . .”\n\nThe show had plenty of suspense, and many very good story lines which I was eager to see every week. I haven't seen it since it went off the air in 1968, but recently acquired a set of dvds of the entire run. Upon watching the show again, I am very pleased with how well it's held up over all these years.\n\nOne of the features of the show was the special effects. Besides the occasional flying saucers, one effect was used at least once each episode, sometimes several times. Whenever an alien was killed, he or she would begin to glow bright red, flare up, and disappear, leaving no trace. Here is a photo showing a dying alien:\n\nI was curious about how this effect was achieved, so I wrote a letter to the production company, Quinn Martin Productions. I received this reply from Howard Alston, the production manager.\n\nI then wrote to Mr. Thinnes in care of his agent, and requested a signed photo. He obliged with this.\n\nI've recently read that the first season of \"The Invaders\" will be officially released on dvd in May, and I'm looking forward to it.\n\nFor an excellent history of the show, with photos, and a complete episode guide, go here.\n\nSide note: David Vincent is still pursuing the alien invaders, wherever they may be. He's been seen most recently traveling through Asia, dispatching aliens one at a time."
