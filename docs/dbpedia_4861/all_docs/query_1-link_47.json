        "text": "Alumna\n\n\"My experience dancing with In Motion, which allowed me to dance in some of the most beautiful and prestigious venues in America, taught me critical lessons about stage presence and hard work that helped shape me into a calm public speaker and confident leader within my college community. It also provided me with lifelong best friends who, four years after I left In Motion for college, continue to support and inspire me every day. I am currently living in southern Thailand for a year teaching English as a Fulbright Fellow before I return to America to pursue a medical degree.\"\n\n— Eleanor Brakewood\n\nParent\n\n\"Our daughter truly loves attending dance each week. When not in the studio she is dancing around the house and eager for the next class. Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication to keep the classes safe and fun!\"\n\n— The Ash Family\n\nParent\n\n\"In Motion Dance has been a place of fun and discipline from age 4 all the way to age 17 for my daughter. A creative, challenging, yet comfortable environment. I highly recommend to anyone of any skill level.\"\n\n— Kristin Anderson\n\nParent\n\n\"My daughter loves attending classes at In Motion Dance. It is a great atmosphere for her to learn and experience dance.\"\n\n— Jennifer Klein\n\nParent\n\n\"Both of my daughters have been attending dance classes at In Motion since age 2 ½ (they are now 5 and 7 year old). It is a family run studio which has been in existence for over 30 years. The owner, Kathie, is one of the instructors herself - - all dance instructors are nothing short of extraordinary. In Motion can be described as a loving, fun, and creative studio. The girls have mastered their dance skills in a setting that is akin to a family. The performances at the end of the year are spectacular. Kathie has taken so many steps to provide a SAFE and socially distanced setting for the girls. There are only 4-5 students in the classes right now, all socially distanced (the floors are actually taped so they are literally all more than 6 feet apart at all times) with masks, ventilation system, windows to the outside, and mask breaks. Out of all extracurriculars at this time, I feel most comfortable with my girls participating in dance classes at In Motion. Kathie also offers Zoom classes, which we did from March through June. Even on Zoom, the girls had a blast - the instructors are so engaging and it was the perfect outlet for them to feel connected to the community during this time. This is hands down the best studio in the area!\"\n\n— Alexis N. Laufer, Esq.\n\nParent\n\n\"During this challenging year, Kathie made sure the students had some consistency by offering zoom classes and then eventually in person classes that follows the appropriate COVID protocols. Not skipping a beat with dance has been very important for my daughter because it provided comfort and normalcy in this time of uncertainty. Kathie’s unwavering support and commitment to the students’ dance experience is truly admirable and appreciated.\"\n\n— Tanja Weber\n\nParent\n\n\"We moved to Chester a few weeks after my daughter turned 1. She was already dancing, bopping her head and bouncing her legs anytime she heard music. At a neighborhood gathering shortly after we moved in, I mentioned that I was going to need to find a dance studio. Without hesitation, several of my neighbors said, 'You have to go to Dorothy's. It's the best around.' From that day, I could not wait until Megan was old enough to enroll in the Dorothy Del Guercio School of Dance, the legacy studio for In Motion Dance. The smile on her four-year-old face as she walked into the studio has not left her in the last decade. Now a member of In Motion Dance Company, she has had the opportunity to perform at amazing venues like Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center - all of this without the atmosphere of competition. At In Motion Dance, Megan has developed poise through technique in modern and ballet and strength through her hip-hop classes. She loves them all. I am proud to be a dance mom at this studio, as it is a community of artists who support each other to develop young dancers.\"\n\n— Kristen Turner\n\nAlumna\n\n\"In Motion Dance helped me develop and nourish a love of dance that guided me from preschool to high school graduation, and eventually led me to a career in the performing arts. From my first job as a studio receptionist to performance opportunities as a founding member of In Motion Dance Company, my experiences at the dance studio were invaluable. I will be forever grateful to the teachers and staff who created a non-competitive environment that allowed me to grow, learn, and thrive at the dance studio.\"\n\n— Ashley K. Baer\n\nCompany Manager, American Ballet Theatre\n\nStudent\n\n\"This is the start of my 6th year with Ms. Kathie’s school. I look forward to classes every week because the teachers are really good and encouraging and I have learned so much.\"\n\n— Addison Weber\n\nParent\n\n\"We have been with the Dorothy Del Guercio School of Dance for several years. We have loved it from the beginning, but it is so important to note the level of professionalism conveyed by Kathie Kececi during the pandemic. She, her family and staff made a recital possible during a time of uncertainty. I recognize the enormous amount of time and effort it took to execute a well organized event. This dance studio has been a sacred place to my daughter and to my family and we are forever grateful to the legacy of Mrs. Dorothy Del Guercio.\"\n\n— Angie Constantino\n\nAlumna\n\n\"My fiance and I were at the swing dance class we go to every Tuesday. A big part of swing is improvisation, as was practiced in the past in places like the Savoy Ballroom, NYC. Through the instruction and training in creating spontaneous movement I had at In-Motion (both as a young child and when I was in the company), I felt completely free to experiment and expand on the original steps — something that I credit to In Motion.\"\n\n— Alexandra Turrini\n\nAlumna\n\n\"Dorothy Del Guercio’s School of Dance and the In Motion Dance Company gave me a family, lifelong friends, and skills that I utilize everyday as a college student. I am now a sophomore at the University of South Carolina studying psychology, criminal justice, and business and of course still keep in touch with the friends I made through dance! Thank you!\"\n\n— Julia Chase:)\n\nAlumna\n\n\"Dancing with In Motion provided me an opportunity not only to exercise my body, but even more importantly, an outlet to relax my mind, breathe, and step away from my day-to-day tasks and thoughts. Throughout my time in high school, I was able to grow in self-confidence through a supportive community of mentors and friends, many of them I still think about often today.\"\n\n— Dana Wade Pavarini\n\nAdmissions Counselor, Columbia University\n\nAlumna\n\n\"My dance experience with In Motion and other technique classes at the studio have been vital in shaping the student, dancer, friend, and young woman I am today. The discipline, persistence, and sisterhood I gained as a result have allowed me to survive my first term at Dartmouth academically and socially. The studio has served as a hub for some of my best friendships and experiences, which I carry with me every day on my journey to become a doctor.\"\n\n— Stephanie Do\n\nParent\n\n\"My daughter chose to dance here when she was 6 because she somehow knew how special Dorothy Del Guercio was. It has been about 4 years later and we are still in love with dance and this studio. The staff has fostered a supportive space where the kids learn and grow through dance and beyond. I can only give praise to the empowering world that Kathleen Kececi and crew have fostered for my girl and all the other kids that step through the doors at this studio.\"\n\n— Melissa Wojcik\n\nAlumna\n\n\"My name is Noel Appleby, and I am currently a nursing student at Monmouth University. Dancing multiple styles (modern/ballet/hip-hop/etc) for 15 years has taught me how to grow as an individual and express who I am. It has socially taught me how to listen and accept other people’s opinions as well as collaborating my own ideas into theirs. I have learned to express my own thoughts and opinions as well as not being afraid to push my own limits and exceed my personal goals. I have also learned my personal strengths and weaknesses to work on through dedication and determination. Dance has overall shaped me as a person and contributes towards my growth as an individual.\"\n\nAlumna\n\n\"There are so many ways the environment she created influenced me, but the greatest one just being a place where I was able to be 100% myself, to be vulnerable and learn who I was, and through that gain so much confidence and resilience. That propelled me so far in my life. While I've had such a fulfilling life since leaving Chester, when I think about the times I've been the happiest, I think of my time at the studio – not only dancing, but all the moments in between where I learned about teamwork, business, rest, laughter, and teaching. I miss her greatly and I hope she knew the impact she had on so many of our lives.\"\n\n— Nikki Rappaport\n\nAlumna\n\n\"Dancing with In Motion taught me the importance of enjoying yourself while engaging with others for a higher purpose -- I learned so much engaging with other girls. Team work and persistence, but also flexibility, have been values I still see relevance in today. In Motion also created an opportunity for me to fully immerse myself in an incredible art form. \"\n\n\"A little life update: Currently in my last year of undergrad at Wake Forest University, pursuing a degree in Mathematical Business and Chinese. Next year, I'll be working full time in Charlotte, NC for Ernst & Young in their Financial Services Advisory practice. I also applied to be a Fulbright Scholar in Taiwan, but I won't hear back on whether I was accepted until April 2020!\"\n\n— Skylar Liang\n\nParent\n\n\"My daughter has been dancing at the studio since she was 4. She absolutely loves it. Miss Kathie goes above and beyond to keep dancers of all ages, engaged and excited about dance. There is NEVER a day Stella says I don't want to go.\"\n\n— Karen Prignano\n\nAlumna\n\n\"I am currently a junior at the University of Pittsburgh where I'm studying Industrial Engineering. I am an active member of the Pitt Dance Ensemble. Put simply, dance is my life. It is the one thing that has always been there for me and is constant. In Motion gave me incredible performance opportunities, as well as the ability to grow in what I love most: dance. It gave me confidence in myself as well as my abilities. Being an engineer, it's not common to find someone in my classes who is also a dancer. I believe that it has given me a creative edge. Actually, this coming spring I will be working at Disney as an Industrial Engineering intern- and I completely believe that my creativity and passion in dance set me apart from other applicants and helped me get hired. Not only that, but dance will always be my outlet and can distract me from the most stressful of times. Again, something I learned from In Motion. I can't imagine my life without dance, and I never plan on stopping!\"\n\n— Emily Moyer"
