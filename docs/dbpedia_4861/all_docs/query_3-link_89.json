        "text": "Learn about First Church 150-year History in San Diego!\n\nThe 150th Anniversary History book by Krista Ames-Cook.\n\nDrawing on photographs and research from First Church and local community archives, Krista's book chronicles how Methodists have worshiped in several locations throughout San Diego, California, since February 1869.\n\nAs the city grew, so did the church. The first locations were near the waterfront and in the neighborhood that is known today as the Gaslamp Quarter. From 1870 to 1906, the church was in the heart of what is now downtown near Horton Plaza.\n\nAfter a move few blocks northeast, the congregation worshiped from 1907 to 1964 in a Gothic Revival-style sanctuary designed by Irving J. Gill. Even with additions, First Church outgrew this space, and so it moved again in 1964 to a Spanish-contemporary-style church in Mission Valley. Over the years, the churchâ€™s reach has expanded to multiple sites and many congregations.\n\nThis book is a must-have with lots of photographs and stories of joy and hope. Available for purchase in the church office (619-297-4366). Cost $25.\n\nSPONSORS"
