        "text": "Memorial Day weekend was a busy one for many! Some folks needed to go to work on Tuesday to “rest up”.\n\nThere were plants to plant in yards and at the cemetery, lawns to mow, hay to cut, lake properties to open for the season, garage tools reorganized from winter to summer, windows to be washed and the list goes on.\n\nFingers were crossed that rain would not deter the Memorial Day Ceremony on the Village Green. It worked! No rain, but later in the early afternoon it poured.\n\nLast year during the Memorial observance, Commander Arnold was chastised by an on looker that was dismayed about the wreath cast in the river for those who died at sea. The wreath was not biodegradable she said!\n\nThis year the Commander was prepared with a grapevine wreath. A grapevine wreath?? A plain ole grapevine wreath? True, it is biodegradable but the ladies of the American Legion Auxiliary were not going to allow a plain ole brown wreath.\n\nWhat could those ladies do in a short period of time to make that wreath more appealing and worthy? The ladies were on the Village Green and the ceremony was going to begin in a few minutes!\n\n“Necessity is the Mother of Invention” so with boots on the ground the ladies took courage and improvised. Lynn Zelsnack and Hope Cross saw the beautiful iris blossoms around the gazebo. Bert Zurbruegg ran to her car and pulled out garden snippers and cut them. Robin Quail started taking photos. Someone looked up the street to see the big rhododendron blossoms, so they were snipped and added. Lynn had some string in her car and by the time David Quail got back from looking for something to use to attach the blossoms, it was all put together! Yes indeed, those patriots created something worthy to be cast in memory of those who perished at sea. David took their photo. We are proud to publish it. (l-r) Hope Cross, Lynn Zelsnack, Robin Quail and Bert Zurbruegg.\n\nThe Marathon High School Marching Band played the National Anthem and taps with an echo as wreaths were placed on the Village Green, cast into the water of the Tioughnioga and at the flagpole in the Marathon Cemetery. It is so nice to have the band a part of the ceremony and to lead the parade. Walkers followed the band. David Lusk, a 90 year old Veteran was driven in a golf cart up to the Cemetery, Justin Lilley at the wheel.\n\nVeteran Kevin Moore carried the American Flag all the way to the Cemetery. Along the way some band members had to step to the side and let the parade go by, due to being over heated. The traditional walk to the Cemetery is a hike, we are proud of those who did it! Local photographer, Yvonne Moore captured the laying of the wreath at the Cemetery’s flagpole, with Veterans Bill Perfitt and John Walburn doing the honors. At the end of the ceremony, Veterans (l-r) John Walburn, Jim Robinson, Kevin Moore and Bill Perfitt rolled up the flags.\n\nWorking together Marathon had a very nice Memorial Day Ceremony. Thank you Mayor Chamberlin and the Village Electric Department for improving the sound system at the gazebo.\n\nDid you know that our Mayor walks in the Village every day? It is very easy to “grab his ear”as he passes by. He is proud of the many volunteers who make Marathon a great place to live.\n\nNow the wild flox are showing their beauty and no doubt are the reason the Indians gave our river it’s name- Tioughnioga- “flowers along the banks”.\n\nVillage folks are asking drivers, especially on Galatia Street, headed to the McGraw-Marathon Road to slow down, there is no need to speed on those narrow streets.\n\nVillage folks are also complaining of unleashed dogs who wander and use lawns as their “sand box”. That really isn’t fair! Dog owners have a responsibility to know where their dog is, preferably on their own property.\n\nAnother disturbing happening along Highland Road occurred sometime on Memorial Day. For too many years to count, Veteran David Lusk has proudly displayed on his lawn, on Memorial Day, a number of flags: the Bennington Flag, Betsy Ross Flag, the 50 star American Flag and the Confederate Flag. When Dave came home following the Memorial Day Ceremony the Confederate Flag was missing. Just that one. Dave will have a 90th Birthday Party on Sunday, and he has had that flag since he was a little boy. Wouldn’t it be sweet if it could be returned by the person who took it?\n\nJune is Dairy Month. Next Tuesday the Marathon High School Band will participate in a Parade in the City of Cortland.\n\nLove gardening, especially flowers? Want to join with others who feel the same way? Be on Lovell Field’s parking lot June 7 (next Friday) to car pool to Grisamore Garden Nursery in Locke, New York at 9:30 a.m. Bring a bag lunch to enjoy at Fillmore Glen State Park, located in Moravia.\n\nSympathy of the community is extended to the family of Sandra Rae Johnson Davids, MCS Class of 1960, daughter of the late Russell and Joyce Johnson, who passed away November 10, 2023 in Media, Pennsylvania at age 81. Sandra grew up on the family farm in Freetown with siblings Kathryn, Robert and David. She was active in 4-H mastering, cooking, sewing, gardening and animal husbandry. Sandra was also active in school, at one time held the shot-put record, she also taught Sunday School at the nearby Freetown Methodist Church. She and her first husband Charles Frisbee brought a son and daughter into the world. Sandra had a 30 year career with IBM. Her cremains were brought home to Freetown where they were interred in the Freetown Cemetery, with a private ceremony held on Saturday, May 25 in the cemetery. Her late husband James Davids (32 years) who passed away 8/18/22, and their two pet’s cremains were also interred there.\n\nBrother Tom Boice officiated at the beautiful ceremony with music, poems and fine tributes to the lives of Sandra and James.\n\nDid you get your reservation made for the 133rd Marathon Alumni Banquet on June 22nd? Payment is to be made ahead of time, no payment at the door. This year the buffet dinner is $25.\n\nThe Alumni Committee is asking graduates to get involved and consider participating in the organization, which is dedicated to carrying on the tradition of hosting a banquet which gives an opportunity for former graduates to come together again with their classmates. Go to olympianalumni@yahoo.com with questions and to make arrangements to attend.\n\nThe Christian Academy’s Pre-School will celebrate Grandparents Day on Thursday June 6th at 10 a.m. This is always a special occasion and anyone who appreciates the accomplishments of little people will be so happy to be in the audience for their performance.\n\nThe Annual Strawberry Shortcake Sale for Peck Memorial Library’s Children’s Program is Thursday June 6 starting at 3 p.m. in front of the Methodist Church. It is a good idea to pre-order by calling 849-6135. Just $5.\n\nThe families of MCS Class of 2024 graduates are busy planning family celebrations. We wish each member of the Class of 2024 good luck with finals and happy days during their last days of school, as they wrap their heads around the fact that life as they have known it is about to change.\n\nWe wish a speedy healing to Bill Tei who has broken a hip and expects to be in rehab at Cortland Memorial Medical Center (Guthrie).\n\nWe wish a speedy recovery from recent eye surgery to Pat Willis.\n\nWe wish a “get home soon” to Cheryl Pfeifer who is recovering from heart surgery.\n\nWe ask you to be a good neighbor and to check on your neighbor. Celebrate June with lots of ice cream. In fact, get out the ice cream maker and make it. Until next time, milk with cookies is a nice combo too!\n\nThere is a mad scramble going on out there! It is on lawns, gardens, cemeteries, hay fields, and all the outdoors! Folks are mowing lawns, edging, trimming and planting. Folks with swimming pools have the Marathon Firemen filling them up. Farmers are chopping the first hay crop! It is a busy time of year!\n\nEveryone knows the Lily of the Valley!\n\nThe wild flowers are are blooming too. Sure everyone knows the Buttercups, and the wild strawberry plants but do you know the name of the pink ones? They are dotting the countryside too!\n\nThe Annual Marathon Lions Club’s plant sale, was very successful this year. We know what folks will be doing on Memorial weekend. They will be finding just the right spot to plant these beauties. Rhea Robinson (l) helps Brianne Shippey (r) fill the order that Little Leaguer Parker Shippey sold.\n\nOn Tuesday, 344 Marathon Central School Taxpayers, went to the polls. Twenty-one voters voted by Absentee Ballots.\n\nKimberly Moore and Justin Lilley filed petitions and were on the ballot. A write-in campaign, by Floyd Parker, former member of the Marathon School Board, was successful, edging out Miss Moore. Final results were Justin Lilley-281, Floyd Parker 242, Kimberly Moore 91.\n\nSuperintendent Buchsbaum was very happy that all propositions passed. Budget passed 270 to 64, Buses passed 272 to 63 and Technology Reserve 268 to 61. Mr. Buchsbaum smiled saying “I guess it was a good idea that the new buses will be diesel, not electric.”\n\nTake a look at this!\n\nDave Roe, of R & M Farm & Pro Hardware, is the proud owner of The Perfection Cooler & Aerator! What? Got you stumped? Wonder what it was used for and how it works?\n\nDave has been in the “milk” business all of his life, in one way or another, but this piece of equipment is way before his time.\n\nA busy man for sure, but Dave realized this is a piece of dairy farmer history and was in the right place at the right time to save it. Now he will tackle the skill of removing rust. Dave has done extensive research, knows who invented it and even found that the inventor lived in Marathon at one time. Lynn R. Lewis was a man of many traits and talents. He was even elected Mayor in the City of Cortland on the Prohibition Party line!\n\nDave wants to give this piece of dairy farming history to a place where people can see it and appreciate the time in which it was invented. The Marathon Area Historical Society has guaranteed Dave that it will be on display at the 1890 Union Fair and at the FFA Fair on the Village Green. The Society believes that The Perfection Cooler & Aerator may have been key for local dairy farmers who shipped milk to NYC! “George and Jerome Hulbert made their living from buying milk, cheese, eggs from local farmers, then shipping to NYC to a third brother who sold it there. Both men, are mentioned in The Gripp’s History of Marathon” said Village Historian Connie White.\n\nThe Class of 1972 held their monthly “reunion” get together at Reilly’s Café on Friday, May 17th. “We meet about once a month, in a variety of places, but Reilly’s Café is our home turf” said Mary Gordon Glezen. “We will meet the third Friday in June, but in July it will be the second Friday because Allan Knoezer will be here from Florida and Pat McCracken will be here from Georgia. We have so much fun, no clicks, we are all the same. At our 50th Reunion, 35 out of 49 attended. We even had a fun water fight at that reunion.” (l-r) Going around the table -Bruce ?, Sue Reagan, Hazel McCalister, Steve Col, Dale Smith, Ed Barry, Diane Sturdevant, Terry Schumacher, Mary Gordon and Aimee Peppin.\n\nEagle Scout candidate, Alexander Votra began his Eagle project last weekend. His project will benefit the Marathon Lions Club’s Little League Program. He has coordinated and managed everything, from getting quotes to enlisting volunteers, to replace the roof on the Little League’s Snack Shack and bathrooms on Lovell Field. Alexander is keeping detailed information about every aspect of the project. That information will be presented to a review board to determine if the project is worthy of the prestigious “Eagle Scout” badge.\n\nDonna Hughes and Barb Elwyn are committed to making Peck Memorial Library’s back yard neat and tidy. The two ladies worked all day there on Sunday. Sure does look nice with the new fence.\n\nMeet Dorothy Duff a lady who knows how to get things done! She walks with a walker to the Post Office daily. We asked if we could help her with a large package she just received in the Post Office. But Dorothy proudly pulled out her bungy cords and said she was prepared! “When you live alone, you figure out ways to get things done” she said. Sure enough, we next caught up with her on the Village Green, proudly taking her package home.

He was happy to see everyone getting ready for Memorial Day.\n\nNow the Japanese Iris, the rhododendrons, and soon the peonies will be taking the spotlight.

Buy a poppy from the Ladies Auxiliary, walk in the parade to the cemetery, get your family, friends and neighborhood to join in. We ask you to be a good neighbor and to check on your neighbor.

Until next time, honor all Veterans!\n\n“I’ll be with you in apple blossom time\n\nI’ll be with you to change your name to mine”\n\nBoy, they sure don’t write songs like that anymore, can you finish the next two lines of that old song?\n\nYes it is apple blossom time and it is time for so much more. Little white strawberry blossoms dot lawns and fields, they are mixed with dandelions, along with blue and white violets too. Rhubarb lovers are harvesting rhubarb, and in a few weeks the strawberries will be added to the pie for the famous strawberry/rhubarb pie.\n\nMoms were celebrated on Sunday in a variety of family occasions.

Floyd Parker has thrown his hat in the ring.\n\nFloyd told us that he has been asked to run. The reason he did not file petitions was because he thought that Derek Hartman was running again with Justin. “I didn’t find out that Derek wasn’t running until after it was too late to file” he said.\n\n……………………………….\n\nMaple Festival goers and the Maple Festival Committee have seen Bill Green, from Montour Falls, for many years at the Maple Festivals, but probably did not know his name.

No apples in the fall make for a sad season without them.\n\nOn Saturday, Town Supervisor Tim Elliott welcomed everyone to a special event to honor folks who have served the Town of Marathon. Due to covid some fine tributes were pushed aside, when these folks retired, but on Saturday the Town took care of the unfinished business.\n\nLegislator George Wagner, Councilman Jim Dann, Highway Superintendent Randy Ensign (absent but represented his wife Joann) and Town Supervisor Tom Adams.\n\nSpecial guest, Chairman of the Cortland County Legislature, Kevin Fitch of Scott attended the gathering and reminisced his working relationship with Legislator George.\n\nTom Adams with his family, Brian, Megan and wife Doris.

Each day something special was done to observe the Appreciation week, at our school. Monday was breakfast for teachers. Tuesday there were ice cream sundaes after school. Wednesday a special note. Thursday a gift and Friday the Board of Education is providing a catered lunch by Reilly’s Café. Congratulations to our teachers!\n\nMany in the community, especially the parents of 2nd Graders, have been disturbed by a note the Second Grade parents received about Mother’s Day. We must write about this.\n\nIt sure looks like we have Second Grade Teachers who are “Woke Warriors” concerned with “society”. A note signed “kindly”, by The 2nd Grade Team, read this way-\n\n“As we approach Mother’s Day, we have been thinking of a way that we could include diverse families that exist in our “society” today.”\n\nThe note went on to say for an alternative to the regular Mother’s Day card and craft that youngsters usually make, this time it would celebrate the “The Grown-ups Who Love us Day!”\n\nHmmm? Let that sink in! Sorry Mothers and Grandmothers, no cards for you. Now, if you do get a card it is because you are a grown-up, not a Mother or Grandmother.\n\nDid Elementary Principal Hillis know about this note to parents? Did all Second Grade Teachers agree to send that note home? Perhaps these answers will be part of Monday’s meeting.\n\nOn Monday, at 6:30 p.m. in the High School Auditorium, there will be the Annual Hearing for the MCS School Budget and a “Meet the Candidate for the School Board”.\n\nFollowing this, there will be a regular Board of Education meeting in the High School Library, at approximately 7 p.m. when there is a time for community comments.\n\nIt has been kind of quiet in the High School as the Senior Class trip to Florida is this week. We wish each one and the chaperones too, much fun and safe traveling.\n\n…………………………………………\n\nMeet the Great, Great Grandchildren Dr. Walter Dresel, Braeden and Eliana Richards of North Carolina who stopped by the 1861 Building on Thursday to see the Dresel paintings. The brother and sister duo are both interested in outdoor careers and will be camp counselors, this summer, in Texas at a huge Boy Scout Camping facility. We wish them successful travels and a wonderful experience this summer.\n\nLaurie Tebbe returned home last Friday from a trip to Cedar Rapids Iowa, where she delivered the 1970’s Marathon Independent newspapers. Accompanying Laurie, were her brother Steve, his wife Jeannette and daughter Amy Tillotson. On the way they stayed a few days with Jeannette’s brother Larry Gaylord and his family, in Elgin, Illinois. In Galena, Illinois they visited President Grant’s home and had lunch at the DeSoto House Hotel, which was name for the discoverer of the Mississippi River. The DeSoto House Hotel was opened in April of 1855 and was billed as the “Largest Hotel in the West”. Crossing the Mississippi River into Dubuque, Iowa they spent the night in Cedar Rapids where they met and had dinner with Ryan Tillotson, former Marathon graduate and a cousin. The next day they deposited the Marathon Independents to be digitized and drove to Hannibal, Missouri to the Mark Twain’s home and visitor center. Next spending the night in St. Louis, Missouri they visited the arch at Gateway Arch National Park. Then on to Nashville, Tennessee, taking in a show at the Grand ole Opry and staying two nights at the Gaylord Opryland Hotel. While there they enjoyed a trolley ride around Nashville, visiting the Johnny Cash Museum, Antique Archeology Shop, Marathon Motor Museum and more. Then they traveled to Bowling Green, Kentucky where they entered Mammoth Caves, taking a 2 hour historical tour. They drove home after spending the night in Jeffersonville, Ohio. In short, when ever a person is with Laurie Tebbe, out in the big world, she packs in lots of historical adventures.\n\nAnother fellow on an adventure of a lifetime is Nelson Couch who is now sending photos from Africa. He writes “we are in Botswana at Thoma Telele near Maun. Horseback ride this morning. Certainly, in the outback, all dirt roads.”\n\nLegion News\n\nCommander Arnold is planning the Annual Memorial Day Ceremony and has announced that the Sheriff’s Department will escort the parade to and from the Cemetery. Everyone who can walk in the parade should make plans to do it this year. Make it a family tradition.\n\nThe Friday night menu, May 10th is scalloped potatoes and ham dinner, just $12.\n\n…………………………\n\nThe handsome Tarbell Block has been sold to Mason and Lebron Properties, LLC of Ithaca. They are a young couple who want to renovate & restore the building. Marathon folks fondly remember the improvements that Howard and Kathy Dennison made to that building. It is one of Marathon’s last grand buildings in the center of the business district.\n\nThe Maple Festival Committee met on Thursday this week. It was motioned and agreed that all officers remain in their office. Co-Chairs-Paige Parker & Josh Ensign, Secretary-Michelle Steven McGrath and Treasurer- Michelle Bleck Caughey. In other Festival news the 2025 Festival will be held on April 5 & 6. Pancakes made outside worked quite well and will be moved closer to the cafeteria door next year. The Treasurer’s report was not accepted at this time. The committee agreed to host “An Evening on the Green” with Peck Memorial Library this summer. The next meeting will be on September 12.\n\nSympathy of the community is extended to the family and friends of Tony Merihew who passed away on Sunday, May 5, 2024 at the Guthrie Cortland Nursing & Rehabilitation Center at the age of 93. Most folks didn’t know that his real name – his given name was Glenn. A farm boy, born in the Town of Freetown to Benton and Ruby Goddard Merihew, he was raised with siblings Marion, Pete, Carl, Louise, Norma and Paul.\n\nWe cannot remember Marathon without Tony and Joan Merihew, who have been married 74 years. Folks always said “Tony and Joan” or “Jaon and Tony” as they were always together, especially in their older years. Certainly a life time resident of the area, he was a businessman, a leader, a volunteer, and faithful to his family and friends.\n\nPeople liked to see him coming. Active in the Marathon Fire Department, he is a former Chief. He and Joan built a handsome log cabin on Albro Hill, but after some time they moved from the Main Road, for more privacy. Tony enjoyed having a number of animals that he loved to watch over and care for.\n\nThe Father of three daughters, Barbara, Connie and Susan, Tony is survived by them and his wife Joan; brother Pete and sister Marion Barrows; 11 grandchildren; 18 great grandchildren and 8 great-great-grandchildren; as well as nieces, nephews and cousins.\n\nServices will be held, this Saturday at Marathon Memorial Chapel (May 11, 2024) with Brother Tom Boice officiating. Tony’s family will receive friends from 11 a.m. until the 1 p.m. service. In honor of Tony’s memory, expressions of sympathy may be directed to the Marathon Fire Department, P.O. Box 488 or to MAVAC, P. O. Box 132, Marathon, NY 13803.\n\nAs Mother’s Day approaches, we think about that family day in our house on Academy Street, so many years ago. Perhaps it was first a bouquet of violets picked by little hands, a hug, a kiss, a homemade card, maybe a goofy poem that made her laugh. Yes, like the old TV show says “I Remember Mama” and in fact we all do.\n\nWe ask you to be a good neighbor and to check on your neighbor. We hope you “Remember MaMa” always, and of course Mother’s Day is a perfect reminder. Until next time, count your blessings!\n\nTra-la it is spring !\n\nThe first one to report seeing a trillium was Mayor Scott Chamberlin who goes for a walk around town every day. He ventured down Burroughs Road last week and there in the woods he spied a white trillium. Don’t know what they look like? Well here is one found by this reporter, who ventured in the woods on West Hill.\n\nSo while most folks are enjoying the tulips and daffodils along walkways and landscaped areas, we want you to know there is blooming going on where the wild things grow.\n\nOn Monday the Historical Society was pleased to learn the history of Killawog Cemetery, Parker Street Cemetery and the Marathon Cemetery. Donna Barrows of the Killawog Cemetery wrote a fine report which was read in her absence, due to her previous commitment to MAVAC. Karen Knapp, (R) the Secretary/Treasuer of the Marathon Cemetery Association and Roland Robinson (L) President of the Parker Street Cemetery shared the history and their association with each cemetery.\n\nOn Wednesday, May 1st Peck Memorial Library was decked out for May Day. Patrons and guests enjoyed springtime cookies and lemonade. The Open House debuted the summer reading program “Adventures Begin At The Library” is the theme. Library Director Mary Frank (L) and Donna Hughes (right) are always ready to accommodate all who enter our wonderful Library. Trustee Dan McConnell was ready to read a story and this young lady is taking the books she chose home for reading.\n\nOn Thursday the Terry Hammond’s Christian Academy Pre-Schoolers were on a mission to mail a letter and explore the Post Office. Each child had at least one letter and money to buy a stamp. Our wonderful Post Office Ladies (Amy and Karen) were ready to accommodate the little patrons. Amy brought out a stole so they could reach the counter and do business. There were plenty of pleases and thank you’s said. The letters were stamped and put in the box. Then the jolly little group walked back to school to enjoy a pizza party.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon Sam and Genevieve Geer and their business “Le Puppet Regime” located in the Marathon railroad depot received visitors who brought them special recognition as Cortland County’s Small Business of the Year for National Small Business Week.\n\nTheir business began in Philadelphia and moved to Marathon about two years ago. Together they create glass and metal products capturing the imagination of art enthusiasts.\n\nIn speaking at the reception, Genevieve shared that New York State has helped the company develop a better business plan. She credited the Onondaga Watertown Small Business Development Center ( part of Cortland County’s MAP Grant application process). The company is in the process of developing plans to be open on site, especially during the Maple Festival. “We would like to show how we create our products.” Photos are Genevieve presenting the company’s story; Genevieve and Sam with SBCD Bob Griffin and a new kiln in their shop.\n\nHistorian Laurie Tebbe has been on a trip to Iowa this week. She and her family took the Marathon Independent books to Cedar Rapids where they will be digitized. Of course, on the way, Laurie took in many historical sites.\n\nLegion News\n\nFriday Night Supper at the Legion is chicken & biscuit with mashed potatoes, a veggie and dessert for $14.\n\nThis Sunday is the last pancake breakfast until September.\n\nCommander Arnold is making the arrangements for the Memorial Day Ceremony.\n\nTo help defray the expenses for the American Flags placed on the graves of Veterans, please contact Jim Robinson.\n\nAmnesty Day\n\nDon’t forget about Amnesty Day in the Town of Marathon, May 4th, 8 a.m. to noon at the Town Highway Garage off Mill Street. Accepted items include construction and demolition wastes, white goods, Freon-free items, and scrap metal. Tires are no longer accepted.\n\nAlumni News\n\nA recent communication from Class of 1955, Gordon Brown, reminds us that it is time to make plans for the very special weekend in Marathon, the Annual Alumni Banquet, the 5K Run and Graduation.\n\nThe Alumni organizers are meeting and they want every graduate to have an invitation. Technology, for some, makes it very easy to make a reservation, however not all graduates are into “technology”, therefore plans are made to mail invitations to graduates from 1944 to 1970. Facebook will be helping and also the invitation will be on the Marathon Central School website, beginning May 17th. If you would like to receive an email invitation, go to\n\nOlympianalumni@yahoo.com\n\nLeave your name, email address and Class year. Those reading this, who would like a hard copy, just contact -Shelley Warnow at 607-849-6071.\n\nOlympian Lane is a new name!\n\nThey did it!! Appleby Teacher, Christine Brandstadt’s 5th Grade students did something that is historic! They named the circle drive to Appleby Elementary School! Here is how that happened. For a number of years, Mrs. Brandstadt has arranged for her students to tour the Village of Marathon, exploring its history. This year her students were especially curious and fascinated by their hometown. One day in class, Khloe McAllister asked if the circle drive to the elementary school was named? When she found out that it was not, she thought that since the drive around the High School has been named Park Street, the drive to her school should be named too. That began a series of exciting events. Brainstorming names for the driveway, then asking the elementary school students to vote, presenting to the Board of Education and finally the decision of Olympian Lane was made. Here are the presenters to the Board of Education on April 15th. (l to r) Khloe McAllister, Daniel Byron, Mrs. Brandstadt, Colton Fiske, Bailey Quail and Tanner Coleman.\n\nWondering who the raffle winners are at the Presbyterian Church during Maple Festival time? Here they are: Quilt – Travis Hall, TV – Jane Muserill, Eltimar Design – John Curay, Pampered Chef – Melissa Truman, Homemade Jams – Katie Angeline, Jewelry from Maria – Sibelius Thrush, Hilltop Scentsation – Shannon Adams, Heather Creations – Katie Zngeline.\n\n……………………………………..\n\nSympathy of the community is extended to Joe Caughey and his family upon the death of his Father, Stephen Caughey of Cortland. Mr. Caughey passed away, April 18, he was 72. A family man, fun and witty, he enjoyed fishing and hunting. His obituary reads “in lieu of flowers, go throw a ball with a kid, take someone fishing or go for a walk in the woods.”\n\nThere are few folks in Marathon who will remember a Dr. Frail and his office on Brink Street. No doubt folks have heard his name. He had two daughters who started school here in Marathon. The family moved to Cortland in 1940. The sisters kept their fond childhood memories of growing up on Brink Street and often visited Marathon. Catherine and Alice in their older years lived together on Greenbush Street in Cortland. Notice of Alice’s death was posted this week, she was 86. She married, had three daughters, a 35 year marriage, became a widow in 1997. Holding 2 Masters (Education & French) she had a distinguish teaching career. We remember her enthusiasm during the taping of the Historical Society’s “The Brink Street Gang”.\n\nSympathy of the community is extended to the family and friends of Frederick “Fred” R. Niggli, age 89, the youngest child born to the late Ralph and Alice Niggli. His siblings were Bob, Warren, Betty and Dick, who have all passed away. Fred grew up in the house now owned and occupied by Terry and David Light. That house is rather well known in the community for its stone front. It was Fred’s father Ralph, a stone mason, who designed and laid the stone front. Now years later, David Light will attest that not one stone has fallen out or become corrupted. Fred and his brother Dick became masons like their Father. A Niggli in the Town of Marathon has a good reputation for knowing how to do things and doing them right.\n\nA Korean War Veteran, following Air Force duty, Fred was a self employed mason. In later years, he retired from Marathon Schools. He and his late wife Jane were married 61 years. Fred is survived by his son Fred and his daughters Laurie, Lisa and Carolee; 7 grandchildren;1 great grandchild; nieces and nephews.\n\nThere will be a memorial service on Saturday, May 4th, noontime at Point Bible Church in Whitney Point.\n\n……………………………………..\n\nThis Saturday, the Town of Marathon will honor some fine citizens who have given their time, talents and energy and have kept our Town strong and proud. Covid caused the delay in honoring them, so this Saturday is the day.\n\nYou are invited to the Town Hall on West Main Street for good fellowship, special recognition, punch and goodies. All are welcome. We ask you to be a good neighbor and to check on your neighbor. Lots of spring time things to do, we know, but make sure you rejoice in it. Until next time, count your blessings."
