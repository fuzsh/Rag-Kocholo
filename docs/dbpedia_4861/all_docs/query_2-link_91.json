        "text": "Weber argues that religions evolved along two paths, “rational cognition and mastery of nature, on the one hand, and … ‘mystic’ experiences, on the other” ([1946]1964, 282). Asceticism is grounded in rationalized thinking motivated by a belief that living out God’s command will bring the benefits of God’s grace in the future. Mysticism, alternately, is grounded in emotional processes that are motivated by efforts to enjoy immediate direct contact with the divine. Through the lens of Weber’s typology of action, we could say that asceticism is driven by value-rational motivations and that mysticism is driven by affective motivations. This is to say, the first is motivated by beliefs, behaviors, and ethics, and the second is motivated by feelings, experiences, and emotions (Weber [1922]1978, p. 25).\n\nWeber breaks these two different orientations, asceticism and mysticism, into two more categories: inner-worldly and other-worldly ([1922]1978, p. 544). Inner-worldly involvements include engagement in mundane and face-to-face activities (Weber [1963]1997, p. 166). Other-worldly involvements includes various forms of private contemplation ([1946]1964, p. 542). In other words, inner-worldly refers to engaging the immediate social world, and other-worldly refers to withdrawing from the social world by isolating oneself from face-to-face interaction with other people.Footnote 3\n\nWeber combines the two approaches to religion, and in doing so produces a typology of four religious orientations ([1922]1978, pp. 541–556), which can be laid out in a two-by-two table (see Table 1). Out of the four religious categories, Weber develops IWA, the subject of The Protestant Ethic ([1905]1930), most fully. In theorizing the dynamics of IWA, Weber argues that the protestant work ethic helped to shape American capitalism. Ideological commitment to vocation, hard work, and frugality led to an accumulation of capital. A surplus of capital fed back into the goals of vocation, hard work, and frugality and resulted in the continued accumulation of capital. Eventually other actors, who did not necessarily share the initial theological mandates, had to take up the capital accumulation habits and attitudes in order to compete in the market place with IWA. Thus living out religious ideological commitments created a self-reinforcing loop between culture and material conditions that became the basis for future constraining patterns—the formation of capitalism. The Protestant Ethic thus details the relationship between ideas and the formation of constraining structures (Weber [1905]2002).\n\nAlthough Weber refers to all four types throughout his discussions of religious orientations, Weber treats inner-worldly mysticism, in particular, as an aside ([1922]1978, pp. 541–556).Footnote 4 From the start, Weber does not even allow for the possibility that mystics could engage in social activity that could lead to social change. By collapsing the practice of contemplation with the mystics’ goal of communion with the divine, Weber treats all mysticism as other-worldly. Indeed, throughout his discussion, Weber discusses the “inner-worldly mystics” as “inner-worldly contemplative mystics” ([1963]1993, pp. 173, 175, emphasis added)Footnote 5 who minimize action in the world and look for opportunities for contemplation in order to experience mystical illumination (1964[1946], pp. 174,176, 325–326). Weber describes the contemplative mystic: “He is constantly striving to escape from activity in the world back to the quietness and inwardness to his god. Conversely, the ascetic, whenever he acts in conformity with his type, is certain to become god’s instrument” (1922[1978]), p. 549).Footnote 6 However, Weber does state in one section of his description of IWM in Economy and Society that “genuine mysticism” does not typically lead to “social activity” but can nevertheless give rise to “communal action,” especially “the mystical feeling of love” and thereby “the creation of communities” ([1922]1978, p. 550). However, Weber does not pursue this line of thinking throughout the rest of his description of IWM, and he actually later contradicts it by suggesting that no mystics are interested in the world and that they have no impact on the world (1946[1964], pp. 174,176, 325–326, 549).\n\nWeber’s analysis of IWM contains gaps and inconsistencies because he does not develop his theory about IWM from strong examples.Footnote 7 For example, Weber uses Quakers and Monks as examples of IWM, but he also uses both groups as examples of OWM ([1946]1964, pp. 538, 542, 549). Without strong examples, Weber’s two methods, ideal types and verstehen, fail. The ideal type approach fails because he does not develop a synthetic picture from examining the extremes of actual empirical cases of IWM ([1946]1964, p. 7). The goal of verstehen—an empathic understanding of subjective meaning in social action ([1946]1964, p. 388)—fails for essentially the same reason: without concrete examples there were no subjective meanings to unearth.\n\nBy using empirical cases to detail the social foundations and consequences of IWM, this article augments Weber’s development of his typology of religious orientations. Throughout this article, we illustrate our theoretical treatment of IWM with examples from two prolific writers—Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa. Both worked in the Catholic Social Thought traditionFootnote 8—a tradition with a theology that is particularly conducive to IWM. Both also gave rich depictions of an inner-worldly mystical orientation. By using writing from Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa to flesh out a picture of inner-worldly mysticism orientations, we illustrate how a mystical orientation can indeed be grounded in the world.\n\nThis article proceeds in the following way: First, we present our case for using Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa as examples for examining an IWM orientation. Second, we reject Weber’s notion that an IWM orientation is based on personality-based charisma. Rather, IWM is grounded in the emotional dynamics of face-to-face interaction, in particular, interaction in small religious communities. In the third section, we reject Weber’s assertion that one can only orient oneself to the divine either as an instrument or a vessel. Instead, we suggest that the IWM orientation towards the divine is better thought of as a channel. In the final section, we augment Weber’s insight that living out IWA ideological commitments can lead to the creation of social structures ([1905]1930), and argue that living out IWM ideological commitments can lead to the disruption of social structure. Specifically, the IWM sense of channeling the divine can lead to interactions that counter the prevailing interaction-level flow of material and emotional resources. The practices that create these changes can diffuse through networks to generate multiple pockets where face-to-face interaction disrupted and redirected. In other words, IWM practices can spread in a grassroots style, a crucial form of change that is missing from Weber’s typology.\n\nThis article uses the writings of Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa to illustrate how actors develop and sustain an IWM orientation by acting as a channel between the divine and the world. This article uses these two cases to problematize some of Weber’s notions of inner-worldly mysticism, and to refine Weber’s theory by offering some solutions to this long-standing under-development (cf. Snow and Trom 2002, p. 161). By comparing the two women’s efforts to live out Catholic Social Teaching, our goal is to build toward an ideal type and prevent a consuming focus on biography. Beyond Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa’s public writing, both have also had personal papers published—a diary in the case of Dorothy Day and personal letters in the case of Mother Teresa. These personal papers provide an opportunity to see how these women’s public presentations of their work fit with their depictions of their private experience of doing the work.\n\nCase selection\n\nWe selected Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa primarily because both explicitly stated in their writings that they sought to find the divine in the world.\n\nFor example, Mother Teresa explains:\n\n“[W]hen I walk through the slums or enter the dark holes—there Our Lord is lways really present” (2007, p. 50).\n\nDorothy Day expresses similar sentiments:\n\nI do not have to retire to our room to pray. It is enough to get out and walk in the wilderness of the streets (2011, p. 40).\n\nBeyond their evident IWM bent, we also selected Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa because both wrote prolifically, richly, and compellingly about inner-worldly religious life, including IWM.\n\nIt is important to note that just like Weber’s Protestant Ethic, we are not situating the dynamics of the typology of IWM in personalities; instead we focus on practices and skills and how they affect micro structures. Thus, rather than focusing on the two women as inner-worldly mystics, we focus on how both women routinely practiced inner-worldly mysticism. This is to say, their experiences of inner-worldly mysticism were a product of what they did within particular social and religious contexts, not necessarily who they were.\n\nAs a caveat, we must note that the brief biographies that follow reveal that both women were extreme in their religious devotion and practice. Indeed, both Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa are currently going through the process of canonization, the official process to become a saint in the Catholic Church. There are dangers in using such extreme examples. For example, one could mistakenly assume that all experiences of inner-worldly mysticism are as religiously intense as Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day’s experiences of IWM. In actuality, there is no reason to assume that IWM is more exclusively the purview of potential saints than any of the other religious orientations in Weber’s typology. In spite of such dangers, the choice to use extreme examples is similar to Weber’s decision to use Puritans to illustrate the dynamics of inner-worldly asceticism. Weber developed his theory by using extreme cases to work up general typologies of social action, acknowledging that most cases would fall somewhere along a continuum between his basic typologies (Weber [1946]1964, pp. 59–60; Weber [1963]1997, p. 12).\n\nBrief biographiesFootnote 9\n\nMother Teresa began her religious life very differently from the way she ended it. She started as a nun in the order of Loreto, a religious order out of Ireland. She was sent to Calcutta as a teacher, where she taught the children of the wealthy for fifteen years. While she was in Calcutta, she was exposed to the depth of poverty. However, it was not until, as she reports, that she was personally called by Jesus into the slums to care for the poorest of the poor, that she shifted her focus to the slums of Calcutta. She petitioned the Vatican to be released from her involvement with the Sisters of Loreto in order to go into the slums with a vow of poverty and no resources or protection. She began by teaching the children, and then she sought nursing training, allowing her to care for the sick and dying. Soon others joined her in her efforts, living in voluntary poverty and serving the poorest of the poor. She taught those who served with her that each person who came to them in need was “Jesus in his most disturbing form.” Thus to serve was to have direct contact with the divine. Eventually her work developed into its own religious order committed to this initial path of voluntary poverty and serving the poorest of the poor. Mother Teresa’s religious order, The Sisters of Charity, spread throughout the world. Each new outpost began as she began—committed individuals took vows of poverty and initiated communities without material resources. No matter how large the order became during her lifetime, Mother Teresa never ceased her commitment to voluntary poverty, her belief that she served Jesus directly through the poor, or her direct personal service to the poor (Teresa 1997; Guntzelman 1999).\n\nIn the early 1930s, Peter Maurin and Dorothy Day first began the Catholic Worker newspaper and then shortly after started living according to what they advocated in print. The paper advocated organizing one’s life around living out the Corporal Works of Mercy (feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, welcoming the stranger, clothing the naked, visiting the sick, visiting the prisoner, and burying the dead). The paper stressed the importance of personal responsibility for the poor, arguing that people should live in community in poor neighborhoods, give hospitality to the otherwise homeless in their community house, share all that they have, and protest any institution that negatively affects the poor. They also advocated love for the poor, emphasizing that anyone who came to them for help should be treated as the potential second coming of Christ. Both because of this belief that they could be serving Christ and their belief that God has a special affinity for the poor, the Catholic Workers believed that engaging the world by serving the poor created an opportunity to live both emotionally and spiritually closer to God. Maurin and Day believed that a movement of people committed to living in this way could fundamentally transform society. The end point of the Catholic Workers’ moral vision was a utopian return to the earth (Day [1963]1997; Summers-Effler 2010, pp. 27–28). Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin’s vision survived both of their deaths, with Catholic Worker houses throughout the United States and around the world.\n\nSimilarities in cases\n\nAs their quotes suggest, there are many similarities between the two women, similarities beyond what the short biographies above can reflect. Both struggled within the confines of the Catholic Church; they walked a fine line between pursuing their radical visions while remaining completely devout and deferential to the Church’s religious authority. They both worked with the most down and out without a safety net—they were the last stop and only place for many they served. Most importantly, for our purposes here, neither stopped serving the poor face-to-face when they began to gain notoriety for their work. Since loving and serving the poor were mystical ends unto themselves, service remained central in both women’s religious practice.\n\nAlso, it is difficult to separate out completely the relationship between inner worldly and other worldly mysticism in both of these women’s lives, suggesting that there is not likely as clean a dichotomous relationship between the inner and other worldly as Weber suggests (Bynum 1991). Both women cultivated and experienced moments of IWM, but both also talked about the role of sacraments in sustaining them, went to mass daily, and took much comfort and inspiration from studying and meditating on the lives of saints. This is to say that both women cultivated OWM and IWM. However, in both women’s writings, there is a clear distinction between the social support that fosters opportunities for IWM and the individual practice that fosters opportunities for OWM, such as prayer and partaking in the sacraments. This is to say that in spite of the apparent intermingling of OWM and IWM, we are suggesting that there is something specifically social that is required to generate moments of IWM. We are also suggesting that this capacity to generate IWM not only offers deeply satisfying and energizing peak religious experiences, this capacity protects against compassion fatigue and burnout associated with self-transcending activity. Also, as we are focusing on Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa’s capacity for IWM, rather than labeling them as inner-worldly mystic, intermittent involvement in OWM does not undermine our claims about the ways in which IWM works.\n\nDifferences in cases\n\nBoth Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day wrote that they experienced Jesus directly in serving the poor,Footnote 10 but their accounts and apparent experiences differed substantially. Mother Teresa was more graphic in describing these experiences than Dorothy Day. Indeed, Mother Teresa describes an emotional intensity so intimate that she described her relationship with Jesus as a spouse (Teresa and Kolodiejchuk 2007, pp. 44, 258). Mother Teresa also talked about Jesus and God separately. As she reported her direct experience and interaction with Jesus in the poor, she simultaneously reported feeling bereft from God during private moments. According to her personal letters, she had a close but one way relationship with God that was punctuated with a few experiences of profound and intense mystical connection.\n\nAlternately, Dorothy Day did not report any ecstatic visions, although she briefly reveals a sense of separation or distance from God during private retreats. The two women also cited different sources of inspiration for their work: Mother Teresa reports to have been inspired directly by a vision from God, and Dorothy Day writes that she was inspired by Peter Maurin—her co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement, whom she believed to be a saint.\n\nThere were other important differences between Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa. Dorothy Day saw revolution as part of the process of her work, while Mother Teresa did not talk about revolution in the same way. In accordance with this difference, Dorothy Day writes of providing justice as well as service, and Mother Teresa focuses primarily on providing loving service. They also began different types of movements; Mother Teresa initiated a religious order, while Dorothy Day initiated a lay movement. Dorothy Day’s theology of love appears to have been more hard-bitten than Mother Teresa. Day was not given to poetic language when describing the brutal reality of poverty. In spite of these differences, Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day shared the same sense that serving the poor was literally serving their savior. Theirs was a sacramental service, which they believe brought them into direct contact with the divine.\n\nCaveats\n\nIn spite of the richness of the cases of Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa, we are constrained by our choice to use the experiences of two women who attempted to live out Catholic Social Teachings through face-to-face interactions with the poor. Both women also chose to live in conditions below the class into which they were born. We cannot know if we would have come to the same conclusions if we had used more examples, examples from other religions, other genders, other types of religious or mundane activity, or other class positions. We also have no negative cases. In part this is because this state of inner-worldly mysticism is an active conscious achievement, so it is difficult to compare experiences of IWM with other types of experience that grow out of similar conditions, both emotional and physical, but that result in different ends.\n\nIn this section, we illustrate how emotion is an important resource in its own right, and that shifts in emotions constitute meaningful social change. Specifically, living out commitments to practice IWM can undermine prevailing micro social structures that usually contribute to the reproduction of the macro social order.\n\nWeber’s treatment of the potential for social change\n\nSince Weber depicts mystics as passive and world-affirming, he argues that mysticism, in any form, represents little potential for creating change in the world. He states, “The typical mystic is never a man of conspicuous social activity, nor is he at all prone to accomplish any rational transformation of the mundane order of the basis of a methodical patterns of life directed toward external success” ([1922]1978, p. 550).Footnote 12 We would argue that it is indeed likely true that patterns of action associated with IWM would only indirectly influence macro patterns, such as policy or macro economic activity. However, IWM-inspired actions can have direct effect on patterns of face-to-face interaction that constitute the order of lived day-to-day social life (cf Goffman 1982; Rawls 1987).\n\nTheorizing mysticism in interaction\n\nWeber’s analysis of IWM remains incomplete because he focuses on rationality and processes of rationalization. He turns less attention toward the role of emotion in generating IWM and the emotional consequences of IWM. We turn to Collins’s theory of interaction rituals (2004) in order to flesh out the emotional dynamics that are left underdeveloped in Weber’s account of IWM.\n\nInteraction ritual theory\n\nBuilding on the insights of Durkheim and Goffman, Collins argues that the social world is composed of rituals, in particular the micro rituals of face-to-face interaction. These micro rituals give shape to our social world by directing the flow of emotional energy [EE]. Actors experience EE as a level. When interactions go well, participants increase their levels of EE. When interactions go poorly, actors lose EE; they also lose EE when positioned as an order-taker or as the less powerful person in a power-based interaction. High EE feels like confidence, enthusiasm, and a willingness to initiate interaction. Low EE feels like shame, embarrassment, lack of enthusiasm, and a lack of willingness to initiate interaction (1981, 2004, 2008a, b).\n\nCollins specifies the ingredients required for successful face-to-face rituals. There must be: two or more actors physically present; share a common focus of attention, and share a common mood (2004). EE is attached to symbols associated with successful interactions. Actors can return to these symbols as a source of EE between EE-generating rituals. Similarly, threats to EE are attached to symbols associated with negative interactions. Actor will then experience threats to EE when they cannot avoid the symbols associated with negative experiences.\n\nOver time, every individual develops a chain of interaction rituals made up of a history of encounters. The chain of meaningful symbols associated with the history constitutes the cultural content of those histories of encounters. Thus our history of interactions creates both a store of symbolic meanings and a level of EE, positive for those who have enjoyed solidarity or power and negative for those who have suffered exclusion or domination. We draw on significant symbols and our store of EE to pursue or avoid interactions so as to maximize EE over time. If we observe the flows of EE over time, they provide a map of social relations. This is to say that the structurally advantaged and emotionally rich get richer and the structurally disadvantaged and emotionally poor stay poor or become poorer. Aggregated over time, these face-to-face emotional dynamics mirror and reproduce more macro patterns of inequality (Collins 2004).\n\nBuilding on his theory of interaction rituals [IR], Collins, contrary to Weber’s focus on the role of isolated contemplation in mysticism, suggests that it is actually far more likely that people would enjoy the emotional intensity associated with mystical experiences in interaction rather than isolation (Collins 2010, pp. 8–9).Footnote 13 He states that “religious interaction rituals involve especially strong, even extreme, emotional experiences; these announce themselves as of the highest significance, transcending all other experiences, and give pervasive meaning to life” (2010, p. 4). Unlike the mystical path of isolated contemplation, where union is achieved through removing oneself from the mundanity of the world, mystical interactions are achieved by transforming the mundanity of the world into a place where even the minutiae of life are sacred. Mystical interactions can create a sense of “lifting the veil” that is obscuring the mystified world. When such a veil lifts, mystics perceive all that surrounds them as sanctified (Collins 2010, p. 8). The examples above suggest that IWM follows from theological commitments to find divine union in the world by priming mystical interactions.\n\nWe have been careful to delineate the difference between asserting that these women are inner-worldly mystics and that they have the capacity or propensity for inner-worldly mystical action. We suggest that IR theory does a precise job of detailing the social dynamics that may manifest as personal religious charisma. An IR approach provides explanations for the particular interaction conditions that give rise to these actions. IR theory also helps us to understand how biography can come to be entwined with interaction conditions to generate what we would tend to interpret as a charismatic personality. Successful IRs can build one upon another over time. As they build over time, they hone actors’ skills for generating similar successful interactions. A string of successful IRs can generate a biography where this sort of action is central to identity. This is to say that from an IR perspective, charismatic personalities are the outcome, not the cause, of patterns of IWM.\n\nUsing interaction ritual theory to identify the potential for reversing the interaction order\n\nLooking to IR theory, we can postulate the conditions under which EE could be generated and shared by all of those involved in the interaction. Successful rituals generate feelings of collective effervescence. The focus of attention during a successful ritual—both formal and informal rituals—becomes not only grounds for meaningful action, but a sacred symbol of the success of the ritual (Durkheim 1912[1995]; Goffman 1964a, b; Collins 2004). Symbols have this power because they are imbued with the effervescence of the ritual, and as such symbols can call up fainter experiences of the initial rituals that generated the collective effervescence. Those who invoke the sacred symbols, people interacting with those who have status as sacred symbols, also receive a charge of EE that is reminiscent of the emotion generated in the initial successful IR. The focus of an interaction ritual can even be more micro than particular participants in the interaction—the focus, and thus ultimately the symbols of the IR, can be the interaction itself. In this case, types of interaction, rather than particular people, become the sacred symbol imbued with collective effervescence.\n\nIn the case of IWM, EE can grow beyond the other actors involved in the interaction to reflect a sense of communion with the divine. Ironically, it is the most challenging interactions, even interactions that have failed, where we can most clearly observe the sense of connection to the divine. In IWM interactions, the person being served can become the shared focus of attention for the interaction, thus elevating the one who is served to the status of a sacred symbol imbued with the EE associated with the successful, and in some cases divine, IRs. This process of interaction, emotion, expansion, and the formation of sacred symbols transforms the mundane, defined as those things that are not sacred, into not only the sacred, but also direct contact with the divine. Thus, not only are the conditions for IWM social, but the foundation for sustaining opportunities for and commitments to IWM are also social. Although individual actors may draw on contemplation, prayer, or the sacraments to help sustain their work in the world, we can see that the source of IWM experience is community, not charismatic personalities.\n\nChanneling can create the potential to reorder the interaction order\n\nThe capacity to change the interaction order is grounded in the power of IWM-motivated interactions to generate EE for all involved. How can we use this understanding of IRs and their dynamics to explain how all involved in a moment of IWM experience EE? To claim that all involved in the interaction gained EE, we must argue that the IWM-inspired interaction are not power interactions but solidarity interactions. Indeed, one could imagine that many, if not most, charity-style helping interactions could be power-based interactions. To support the claim that helping interactions can be solidarity interactions, we must make the case that, in spite of differences in status, these interactions offer the potential for meeting the criteria for a successful solidarity interaction: bodily co-presence, a shared focus of attention, and a shared mood (Collins 2004, p. 48).\n\nBelow, we argue how IWM-based interaction supports opportunities to meet each requirement, but here we succinctly state: 1) bodily co-presence was a cornerstone of IWM for both women; 2) service interactions supported a shared focus of attention; 3) both women stressed the importance of focusing on those needing help as presenting opportunities to actively love the divine; and 4) the emotional intensity of both service interactions and the challenges of living in voluntary poverty generated shared mood, or at least a mutual identification, across normally rigid social lines. More generally, successful IRs create opportunities for connection to support the flow of resources when there were once firm boundaries.Footnote 14\n\nBodily co-presence\n\nAs we noted above, Dorothy Day and Sister Teresa’s approaches to serving the poor personally meant that their services were rendered in face-to-face interactions, a requirement for a successful IR.\n\nMother Teresa writes,\n\nTo get to love the person, we must come in close contact with Him. If we wait till we get the numbers, then we will be lost in the numbers, and we will never be able to show that love and respect for the person (Mother Teresa 2010, p. 190).\n\nSo too Dorothy Day explains,\n\n[T]o be present, to be available to men, to see Jesus in the poor, to welcome, to be hospitable, to love! This is my need (Day 2011,p. 291).\n\nTo provide the direct service their theology called for, both women, and the communities that grew up around them, placed a premium on bodily co-presence and face-to-face interaction. Both took these bodily interactions much further than providing gifts of food or money to the poor from a distance. Rather, these inner-worldly mystics emphasized prolonged contact with the poor; and sometimes quite intimate bodily care ranging from attending to seeping wounds to washing homeless persons’ damaged feet. This bodily interaction was so central to their endeavors that both Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa continued to spend their days in direct service to others, even as their movements grew and they gained worldwide attention and acclaim.\n\nShared focus of attention\n\nOne might think that their lack of stable resources and the enormity of the problems Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day faced would overwhelm them and lead to exhausted retreat; this, however, was not the case. Instead both Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa managed the gap between what was needed and what they could actually do by focusing intensely on “small” things. Both frequently spoke of following Saint Therese—The Little Flower’s—example of doing small mundane things in the present moment with great loving attention. It is reasonable to surmise that those seeking help would be consumed with their need. We can also see that those serving out of IWM motivation focusing on the “little way” would also focus deeply on the needs of the people right in front of them. This mutual focus on the needs of those who come to them for help promotes a shared focus of attention for the duration of the interaction.\n\nMother Teresa explained:\n\nI believe in person to person. Every person is Christ for me, and since there is only one Jesus, there is only one person in the world for me at that moment (Mother Teresa 2010, p. 190).\n\nDorothy Day expressed similar sentiments:\n\nThere is always the complaint—‘but we are only feeding them!’ from some members of the groups in different parts of the country. It is right never to be satisfied with the little we can do, but we must remember the “little way” of Saint Therese—we must remember the importance of giving even a drink of cold water in the name of Christ (Dorothy Day 2003, p. 31).\n\nThis practice of attention and compassion lays the foundation for the reversal of the typical flow of emotional resources. This is to say, rather than EE flowing towards those already rich with EE, EE grows for both the server and the served.\n\nShared mood\n\nWe can see from the quotes below that those who help are more likely to be struggling with disgust and revulsion, whereas we can imagine that those who come for help are struggling with desperation. In spite of these potentially fundamentally different perspectives and moods, we can point out that in the cases of Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa, IWM offered skills that helped them manage their capacity for shared mood with those they served, including: 1) tuning into mutual intensity to generate solidarity across the divide between helper and helped, and 2) communicating shared material conditions.\n\nIntensity in interaction\n\nWhen attempting to remain open to serve as a channel for divine interventions, servers are vulnerable to sharing the intensity of desperation of those in need. If the inner-worldly mystics can meet those they serve at a primal level of desperation, they can achieve shared mood. They have the emotional skills to transform intense distancing reactions, like revulsion, into reverence and solidarity (Summers Effler 2010, pp. 115–118). This is the skill to join those in need where they are emotionally without being sucked into an immobilizing emotional black hole.\n\nShared mood might be the intensity of the interaction for both parties, not the particular transitory emotions felt along with that intensity, such as revulsion and desperation.\n\nMother Teresa writes:\n\nI never forget the man I picked up from an open drain—except for his face … worms were crawling on his body. There were holes in his body everywhere—he was eaten up alive. He must have fainted and fallen into an open drain and people must have passed and passed, but the dirt had covered him up and I saw something moving and I saw it was a human being. I took him out, took him to our house, and he was still—I had not yet begun cleaning him—but the only words he said: “I have lived like an animal in the street, but I am going to die like an angel, loved and cared for.” Two hours after, by the time we finished cleaning him, he died. But there was such a radiating look on his face, I’ve never seen that kind of joy—real—the joy that Jesus came to give us. That complete content, complete surrender” (pp. 186–187).\n\nWe can think of intensity (a feeling that a moment matters) as creating the potential for shared mood and intimacy (shifting from vulnerability to solidarity). Such intensity of desperation can pull compassion out of a person poised to help. There is no pride that usually mediates interactions (Scheff 1990). Vulnerability is in the open. Particular elements of Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day’s commitments supported deep compassion rather than surface sympathy—compassion joins the suffering of the served, sympathy keeps distance between the server and the served. Empathy with the poor is a two-step process: choosing a compassionate orientation that then facilitates joining a person in the intensity of their despair. The server’s willingness to join in such desperation (which ultimately pays off because it leads to EE and a heightened experience of direct contact with God), that supports the shared mood required for a successful interaction ritual.\n\nVoluntary poverty\n\nMother Teresa and Dorothy Day’s commitment to living in poverty ensured some similarities between their life conditions and material struggles and those they served. Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day’s voluntary poverty created a structural opportunity for resonance and solidarity between the helper and the helped. Although experiences and attitudes of those living in voluntary versus involuntary poverty undoubtedly differed, the shared material struggles and circumstances helped to create, if not a shared mood, a sense of “we’re all in the same boat.”Footnote 15\n\nMother Teresa explains:\n\nOnce there came to Shishu Bhavan a man who was once rich but had become poor, so poor that he had to come to take the kitcheree. He was so bitter and so angry when he spoke to me, because he had to eat that kitcheree. And then … I could look him straight in the eyes and I could tell him: “Every day I eat the same food—kitcheree.” As soon as he heard that, he seemed to feel a great consolation, and he went away at peace. I thank God that at least one person was saved from despair because I share the food of the poor (Mother Teresa 2010, p. 189).\n\nDorothy Day similarly points to the importance of those they serve seeing the Catholic Workers’ poverty.\n\n“[T]he men see our poverty. They know we eat the same breakfast they do” (Dorothy Day 2003, p. 28).\n\nAlthough shared material conditions cannot ensure a shared mood with those they serve, shared circumstance helped to orient those serving in a similar way as those being served. This offered the potential for a shared perspective across normally strict social lines. Living in poverty also supported a sense of solidarity rather than pity for the poor, which created the potential for a sense of shared focus of attention, shared emotional tone, and shared perspective—all of which also facilitate emotionally successful interactions. All of this is to say that voluntary poverty increases the potential for experiences of solidarity between the giver and the receiver.Footnote 16\n\nThe preferential option for the poor and communion with the divine\n\nWhen skills for turning negative intensity into positive intensity and using shared poverty to generate solidarity fail, the interactions become vulnerable to a sense of disharmony and even disrespect between the helper and the helped. The people being helped may not be interested in participating to generate a successful interaction ritual. Indeed, both Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day talk about difficult and challenging guests.\n\nMother Teresa explains how seeing Jesus in the people they serve can bring those serving closer to the divine:\n\nI said, ‘You saw during Holy Mass with what tenderness, with what love, father was touching the Body of Christ. Make sure it is the same body in the poor that you will be touching. Give that same love, that same tenderness.’ They went. After three hours they returned, and one of them came up to my room and said, ‘Mother I’ve been touching the body of Christ for three hours.’ Her face was shining with joy. I said, ‘What did you do, sister?’ ‘Well, just as I arrived, they brought a man covered with maggots. He had been picked up from a drain. And for three hours, I have been touching the body of Christ. I knew it was He (2010, p. 167).’\n\nSimilarly, Dorothy Day writes:\n\nI remember one family on the west side, a longshoreman who got only a day or so on the docks every few weeks. He drank, his wife drank, and their children were growing up disorderly and dishonest. No one would help them. They sold the clothes they were given for liquor. The relief people said the man had work and didn’t report it to them. Consequently often the family went hungry. We spent all one winter giving food and clothing to this family. It was indeed hard to see Christ in these poor. Yet for no other reason could we help them. Without the religious motive, it was a waste of time. With this motive, not one crumb of our help was wasted. Provided we did it with love. And of course if you help people, you soon begin to love them (pp. 50–51).\n\nThese situations illustrate how Mother Teresa and Dorothy Day suggest that IWM endows the helper with the capacity to turn interactions into a form of prayer by focusing attention on “God within” the person, which generates feelings of compassion and love regardless of how those who are being helped behaved or felt. According to the Catholic Workers’ and Mother Teresa’s theology of the poor, both manifestations of Catholic Social Thought, those whom they served lived closer to God. Thus both women believed that they moved closer to God serving those with this privileged status. When people were angry, ungrateful, or disrespectful, the act of service could be transformed into a living prayer as the focus shifted to God.Footnote 17\n\nIn situations where there is no successful IR between the helper and the helped, yet the helper experiences the helping action as a sort of prayer, there is no immediate reversal of the interaction order. However, increasing EE for the helper increases the likelihood of continuing such interactions, creating opportunities for the reversal of the flow of EE at some future point where there must be reciprocation in order to preserve the balance between actors and ultimately the relationship. Detailing the dynamics of IWM suggests how it is possible for the giver to perceive reciprocation while the receiver does not. Even though Dorothy Day and Mother Teresa believed the poor to have a special relationship with God, the poor might not have shared the same perspective. In which case the servers would benefit emotionally and the served physically without achieving solidarity. This can create an unexamined dynamic where the givers feel balance that enables them to continue, while the receivers may feel imbalance that would lead to negative self-feelings if they remained in a reciprocating position for too long. This work here breaks down Mauss’s (1925) distinction between the giver and the receiver, which Mauss treats as relatively clear. This is to say that exchange theory does not account sufficiently for the role of perception that shapes emotion in the social dynamics of giving and receiving.Footnote 18"
