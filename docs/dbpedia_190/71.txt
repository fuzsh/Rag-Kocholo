Treatment of phylogenetic clades

Capnodiales Woron. Ann. Mycol. 23: 177. 1925.

Data obtained from multi-gene phylogenies prompted Schoch et al. (2006) to merge Mycosphaerellales with Capnodiales. Although the present study included numerous additional isolates, the orders remain problematic. Although there is support for the Mycosphaerellales as an order, additional families such as the Schizothyriaceae and Dissoconiaceae (see below) would have to also be elevated to order level, which would result in orders containing a single family, while Teratosphaeriaceae appears to comprise unresolved lineages. For this reason it was decided to retain these families within Capnodiales, but noting that as more families are added and better circumscribed, it is quite possible that the Mycosphaerellales would again be resurrected.

Mycosphaerellaceae Lindau, In: Engler & Prantl, Nat. Pflanzenfamilien 1(1): 421. 1897.

Type species: Mycosphaerella punctiformis (Pers.: Fr.) Starbäck, Bih. Kongl. Svenska Vetensk.-Akad. Handl. 15(3, 2): 9. 1889.

Notes: The Mycosphaerellaceae contains numerous genera, 20 of which are listed by Crous (2009), with many names under consideration (Crous et al. 2009b, c). From these data it is clear that genera such as Passalora, Pseudocercospora, Pseudocercosporella, Septoria, Zasmidium and Ramichloridium are paraphyletic (Hunter et al. in prep.). Well-resolved genera include Cercospora, Cercosporella, Ramularia, Ramulispora, Sonderhenia and Polythrincium. One particularly problematic clade contains Periconiella, Ramichloridium, Verrucisporota and Zasmidium, along with “Mycosphaerella” and Rasutoria teleomorphs. Barr (1987) erected Rasutoria for species with brown ascospores occurring on Gymnospermae. Rasutoria clusters in a clade adjacent to “Mycosphaerella” species with hyaline ascospores, such as M. aleuritidis and Mycosphaerella daviesiicola (Verrucisporota daviesiae) (Beilharz & Pascoe 2002).

The genus Phaeophleospora (1916) clusters with Lecanosticta acicola. The genus Lecanosticta (1922) has typical Phaeophleospora-like conidia, except that its conidiomata are acervular, and not pycnidial. If the type of Lecanosticta, L. pini also clusters in this clade, the generic concept Phaeophleospora may have to be widened to include Lecanosticta, as was done with Kirramyces to include Colletogloeopsis (Cortinas et al. 2006a, b).

Considerable controversy has surrounded the coelomycetes that Crous et al. (1997) placed in Phaeophleospora. Based on DNA phylogenetic data, it has now been shown that Kirramyces anamorphs (Walker et al. 1992), including those accommodated in Colletogloeopsis (Crous & Wingfield 1996, Crous et al. 2004c, 2006c, Cortinas et al. 2006a, b), are linked to Teratosphaeria (Andjic et al. 2007, Crous et al. 2009b, c). Crous et al. (2007a) showed Phaeophleospora to reside in the Mycosphaerellaceae and Kirramyces in the Teratosphaeriaceae, respectively. However, most taxa investigated to date were collected from Eucalyptus. As shown in the present study, Phaeophleospora atkinsonii, a pathogen of Hebes spp. (Wu et al. 1996, Pennycook & McKenzie 2002), clusters distant from Phaeophleospora s. str., while the same is true for Phaeophleospora concentrica, which is a pathogen of Protea spp. (Taylor et al. 2001a), and Phaeophleospora stonei, a pathogen of Eucalyptus (Crous et al. 2007c, 2009c). These taxa thus clearly represent yet another two genera in the Phaeophleospora complex. An older name that would potentially be available is Scoleciasis. However, when B. Sutton examined exsiccati of the type species, S. aquatica, only ascomata of a Leptosphaeria species were found (Crous et al. 1997). The association of S. aquatica with the Leptosphaeria was also noted in the original description, and this may indicate that Scoleciasis is allied to taxa in the Phaeosphaeriopsis/Phaeoseptoria complex (Arzanlou & Crous 2006). Both P. atkinsonii and P. concentrica have a typical Kirramyces morphology, namely brown, percurrently proliferating conidiogenous cells, and brown, obclavate, verruculose, transversely euseptate conidia. Further species thus need to be included in analyses before these generic concepts can be clarified.

During the course of this study several fresh collections of Leptosphaeria protearum were obtained. Leptosphaeria protearum is a major leaf spot and blight pathogen of Protea spp. (Knox-Davies et al. 1987), and causes severe losses in plantations of South African Protea spp. in Hawaii, and has been recorded in many countries where South African proteas are cultivated (Taylor & Crous 1998, Taylor et al. 2001b, Crous et al. 2004a). Cultures of this pathogen were found to cluster in the Mycosphaerellaceae, where they represent an undescribed genus, characterised by having bitunicate asci without pseudoparaphyses, brown, 3-septate ascospores, and a Coniothyrium-like anamorph. Its close phylogenetic relationship to Phaeophloeospora concentrica ( ) suggests that they could be congeneric, and that in future more Phaeophloeospora-like anamorphs may be found to cluster in this clade. We propose a new genus to accommodate Leptosphaeria protearum below.

Brunneosphaerella Crous, gen. nov. MycoBank MB514694.

Etymology: Brunneus + Sphaerella = is after its brown ascospores and Sphaerella-like morphology.

Mycosphaerellae similis, sed ascosporis brunneis, 3-septatis.

Ascomata amphigenous, immersed to semi-immersed, black, single, gregarious, substomatal, pyriform or globose with a papillate, periphysate ostiole. Peridium consisting of three strata of slightly compressed textura angularis, an outer stratum of dark brown, thick-walled cells, becoming paler in the central stratum, and hyaline, thin-walled in the inner stratum. Asci clavate to cylindro-clavate, often curved, tapering to a pedicel, narrowing slightly to a rounded apex with an indistinct ocular chamber, 8-spored, bitunicate with fissitunicate dehiscense. Pseudoparaphyses absent. Ascospores biseriate, fusiform, broader at the apical end, initially hyaline and 1-septate, becoming yellow-brown and 3-septate at maturity, slightly constricted at median to supra-median septum.

Type species: Brunneosphaerella protearum (Syd. & P. Syd.) Crous, comb. nov.

Brunneosphaerella jonkershoekensis (Marinc., M.J. Wingf. & Crous) Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB514695. .

Basionym: Leptosphaeria jonkershoekensis Marinc., M.J. Wingf. & Crous, In: Marincowitz et al., Microfungi occurring on Proteaceae in the fynbos: 62. 2008.

Ascomata pseudothecial, subepidermal, immersed, obpyriform, papillate, 180–205 × 160–235 μm. Peridium 20–30 μm thick, composed of relatively large cells, 11–15 × 2.5–5.5 μm; cells arranged in three strata; outer stratum consisting of 3–5 layers of dark brown, very thick-walled cells; middle stratum transient, consisting of a few layers of pale brown, thick-walled, compressed cells; inner stratum consisting of 1–2 layers of thin-walled, very compressed cells. Pseudoparaphyses absent. Asci bitunicate, inflated cylindrical to clavate, 81–95 × 13–15 μm, ocular chamber dome-shaped, indistinct. Ascospores pale brown, fusoid to ellipsoidal, tapering towards the base, (25–)29–34(–36) × (5–)6–7(–9) μm (av. 31.4 × 6.7 μm), apical cell the shortest, upper hemispore slightly larger than lower, at times slightly curved, 3-septate, smooth, guttulate (adapted from Marincowitz et al. 2008).

Host range and geographic distribution: Protea repens (South Africa, Western Cape) (Marincowitz et al. 2008).

Specimen examined: south Africa, Western Cape Province, Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, leaf litter of Protea repens, 6 Jun. 2000, S. Marincowitz, PREM 59447 holotype.

Notes: Although no culture is presently available for this species, it clearly represents a species of Brunneosphaerella, characterised by its bitunicate asci, and brown, 3-septate ascospores, as well as the absence of pseudoparaphyses. Brunneosphaerella jonkershoekensis can easily be distinguished from B. protearum based on its much larger ascospores (Crous et al. 2004a).

Notes: Although Taylor & Crous (1998) reported a Coniothyrium-like anamorph to develop in culture, none of the cultures examined in the present study on MEA, PDA or OA could be induced to sporulate, though spermatogonia and ascomatal initials were commonly observed.

The fact that cultures of Leptosphaeria protearum, which represents a well-known and serious pathogen of Proteaceae, clustered in the Mycosphaerellaceae, was totally unexpected. A further surprise was the fact that this species appears to represent a complex of several cryptic taxa. Whether these taxa can be correlated with differences in host range and geographic distribution can only be resolved once more collections have been obtained for study. Although the genus Sphaerulina, which represents Mycosphaerella-like taxa with 3-septate, hyaline ascospores, is part of the Mycosphaerellaceae (Crous et al., unpubl data), the type species, S. myriadea, clusters in the Septoria clade, and is thus unavailable for the species occurring on Proteaceae. Morphologically Brunneosphaerella is also distinct in that ascospores are always brown at maturity, and anamorphs have brown, percurrently proliferating conidiogenous cells, appearing Phaeophleospora-like. The recognition of Brunneosphaerella as a distinct genus in the Mycosphaerellaceae also raises the intriguing possibility that many phytopathogenic species of the Leptosphaeria-complex with brown, 3-septate ascospores, but lacking paraphyses, actually belong to Brunneosphaerella.

Passalora ageratinae Crous & A.R. Wood, sp. nov. MycoBank MB514697. .

Etymology: Named after the host on which it occurs, Ageratina adenophora.

Passalorae assamensis similis, sed coloniis amphigenis, sine mycelio externo, conidiophoris brevioribus, 15–40 × 3–4.5 μm.

Leaf spots amphigenous, angular to irregular, 2–8 mm diam, medium brown, frequently with pale to grey-brown central part, and raised, dark brown border; pale to medium brown in reverse, with raised, dark brown border. Mycelium internal, consisting of smooth, branched, pale brown, 2–3 μm wide hyphae. Caespituli fasciculate, amphigenous, medium brown, arising from a brown, erumpent stroma, up to 80 μm wide, 40 μm high. Conidiophores subcylindrical, straight to geniculous-sinuous, unbranched, medium brown, finely verruculose, 1–3-septate, 15–40 × 3–4.5 μm. Conidiogenous cells terminal, pale to medium brown, finely verruculose with terminal, sympodial conidiogenous loci that are 1–2 μm diam, slightly thickened, darkened and refractive, 10–20 × 3–4 μm. Conidia in unbranched chains, pale brown, smooth, finely to prominently guttulate, subcylindrical to narrowly obclavate, apex obtuse, base long obconically subtruncate, (0–)1–3(–5)-septate, (20–)30–60(–80) × (3–)4(–4.5) μm; hila 1–1.5 μm wide, somewhat thickened, darkened and refractive.

Culture characteristics: On MEA erumpent, with uneven, folded surface, lobate margin, and moderate aerial mycelium; centre pale mouse-grey with patches of cinnamon, outer margin olivaceous-grey; reverse olivaceous-grey with patches of cinnamon; reaching 15 mm diam; on PDA spreading, with cinnamon to cream patches in centre, becoming umber towards smooth margins, with diffuse red pigment in agar; reverse olivaceous-grey, with patches of red, reaching 15 mm diam; on OA flat, spreading, up to 30 mm diam, iron-grey, with white, solitary mycelia strands, though aerial mycelium generally absent, reaching 30 mm diam.

Host range and geographic distribution: Ageratina adenophora, Australia, South Africa.

Specimen examined: south Africa, KwaZulu-Natal Province, Hilton, on leaves of Ageratina adenophora, 28 May 2008, A.R. Wood, CBS H-20336 holotype, cultures ex-type CPC 15365 = CBS 125419, CPC 15366, 15367.

Notes: Ageratina adenophora (crofton weed; Asteraceae), which is indigenous to Mexico, has invaded many countries as a rapidly growing weed, forming dense thickets (Morris 1989, Parsons & Cuthbertson 1992, Wagner et al. 1999, Zhu et al. 2007, Muniappan et al. 2009). It is considered a serious weed in agriculture and forestry (Bess & Haramoto 1958, Sharma & Chhetri 1977, Kluge 1991), often replacing more-desired vegetation or native species.

A leaf spot pathogen, originally misidentified as Cercospora eupatorii (this species is currently known as Pseudocercospora eupatorii), was found to infect plants in Australia where a stem galling fly (Procecidochares utilis; Tephritidae) was introduced from Hawaii as a biological control agent (Dodd 1961). Presumably the fungus was introduced together with the flies originally from Mexico to Hawaii and then to Australia. Subsequently this same fungus was obtained from Australia and released in South Africa after host specificity testing indicated it was restricted to A. adenophora (Morris 1989). The fungus causes partial defoliation of mature plants (Dodd 1961, Auld 1969), though the impact depends on environmental conditions (Dodd 1961). Seedlings are however killed rapidly (Wang et al. 1997).

This fungus, which has hitherto been known simply as “Phaeoramularia” sp., still lacks a name and proper description. The genus Phaeoramularia is treated as a synonym of Passalora (Crous & Braun 2003), and hence the species is named in the latter genus as P. ageratinae. Interestingly, this species appears to be closely related to Passalora fulva, which is a serious pathogen of tomato (Solanaceae) (Thomma et al. 2005).

Passalora armatae Crous & A.R. Wood, sp. nov. MycoBank MB514698. .

Etymology: Named after the host on which it occurs, Dalbergia armata.

Passaloraea dalbergiicolae similis, sed conidiophoris in synnematibus densis, conidiis ad basim obconice truncatis, apice rostrato.

Leaf spots amphigenous, on upper surface visible as red-brown, irregular to subcircular spots with indistinct margins, 0.5–2 mm diam; in reverse indistinct, chlorotic to medium or red-brown. Mycelium internal, consisting of smooth, branched, pale brown, 2–3 μm wide hyphae. Caespituli hypophyllous, fasciculate to synnematous, up to 200 μm high and 250 μm wide, situated on a prominently erumpent, pale brown stroma, up to 100 μm high and wide. Conidiophores subcylindrical, unbranched, flexuous, guttulate, pale to medium brown, smooth, 120–180 × 4–6 μm, 2–6-septate. Conidiogenous cells terminal, subcylindrical, guttulate, pale to medium brown, finely verruculose, becoming somewhat swollen, appearing slightly clavate, 25–70 × 6–8 μm; conidiogenous loci 4–20 per conidiogenous cell, sympodial, round, darkened, thickened, refractive, prominent, 2–3 μm wide, up to 1 μm high. Conidia (27–)30–40(–45) × 9–10(–12) μm, pale to medium brown, smooth to finely verruculose, granular to guttulate, thin-walled, ellipsoidal to obovoid, transversely 2–4-euseptate, widest in middle of basal cell, or middle of conidium, tapering to an obconically truncate base; hilum thickened, darkened and refractive; apical cell conical, elongating to an apical beak up to 20 μm long. When cultivated conidia remain attached to conidiogenous cells, giving conidiophores the appearance of small tufts which is very characteristic, and not commonly observed in Passalora.

Culture characteristics: On MEA slow growing, erumpent, with dense white aerial mycelium, which becomes mouse-grey, reaching 5 mm diam after 1 wk; on PDA mouse-grey (surface), iron-grey (reverse), with diffuse red pigment in agar; on OA similar to PDA, also with diffuse red pigment in agar.

Host range and geographic distribution: Dalbergia armata, South Africa.

Specimen examined: south Africa, KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Coast, Mpenjati Nature Reserve, between Ramsgate and Port Edward, on leaves of Dalbergia armata, 28 May 2008, A.R. Wood, CBS H-20337 holotype, cultures ex-type CPC 15419 = CBS 125420, CPC 15420, 15421.

Notes: Passalora dalbergiae, which occurs on Dalbergia sissoo (Fabaceae) in India, is distinct from P. armatae in having superficial mycelium and solitary conidiophores (Hernández-Gutiérrez & Dianese 2009). The previously described Passalora dalbergiicola is similar to P. armatae in conidial dimensions (3-septate, 25–45 × 7–10 μm; Ellis 1976), but distinct in that conidiophores are not in dense synnemata, conidiogenous cells can have single apical loci, and conidia have a less prominent basal taper, and lack the apical beaks typical of P. armatae (in vivo and in vitro).

Schizothyriaceae Höhn. ex Trotter, Sacc., D. Sacc. & Traverso, In: Saccardo, Syll. Fung. 24(2): 1254. 1928.

Type species: Schizothyrium acerinum Desm., Ann. Sci. Nat. Bot. 11: 360. 1849.

Notes: Members of the Schizothyriaceae are associated with flyspeck symptoms on apples and pear fruit. The fungi grow superficially on the epicuticular wax, thereby reducing the marketability of the fruit, but do not penetrate the cuticle (Belding et al. 2000). Batzer et al. (2005, 2007) reported a range of diverse fungi to be associated with flyspeck symptoms on apples, the most prominent being species of Schizothyrium.

Ascomata pseudothecial, immersed, globose, unilocular, papillate, ostiolate, canal periphysate; wall consisting of 3–4 layers of brown textura angularis; inner layer of flattened, hyaline cells. Pseudoparaphyses absent. Asci fasciculate, 8-spored, bitunicate. Ascospores ellipsoid-fusoid, 1-septate, hyaline, with or without mucoid sheath. Mycelium internal and external, consisting of branched, septate, smooth, hyaline to pale brown hyphae. Conidiophores separate, arising from hyphae, subcylindrical, subulate or lageniform to cylindrical, tapering to a bluntly rounded or truncate apex, straight to once geniculate, smooth, medium brown, 0–multi-septate; loci terminal and lateral, visible as slightly thickened, darkened scars on a rachis.

Secondary conidia present or absent; developing adjacent to primary conidia, pale olivaceous to subhyaline, aseptate, pyriform; conidium discharge active or passive.

Type species: Dissoconium aciculare de Hoog, Oorschot & Hijwegen, Proc. K. Ned. Akad. Wet., Ser. C, Biol. Med. Sci. 86(2): 198. 1983.

Notes: Species of Dissoconium have Mycosphaerella-like teleomorphs (Crous et al. 2004c). The genus is characterised by forming conidia in pairs that are forcefully discharged, which is quite unique in the Capnodiales (de Hoog et al. 1983). Although D. aciculare, the type species of Dissoconium, was originally assumed to be hyperparasitic on powdery mildew (de Hoog et al. 1983), Jackson et al. (2004) revealed that another species, D. dekkeri, could act as a foliar pathogen of Eucalyptus. Dissoconium dekkeri is, however, most commonly found in leaf spots in association with other species of Teratosphaeria and Mycosphaerella. Species of Dissoconium remain commensalists, and frequently occur asexually on lesions associated with pathogenic species of Capnodiales (Crous unpubl. data). They are ecologically and morphologically quite distinct from other members of the Capnodiales, and hence a separate family, the Dissoconiaceae, is herewith introduced to accommodate them. Ramichloridium forms brown, solitary conidiophores with a rachis and apical loci similar to that observed on Dissoconium, and primary conidia that are pale brown, 0–1-septate, with slightly thickened hila, but lacks secondary conidia (Arzanlou et al. 2008b). Both Dissoconium and Ramichloridium have in the past been reported as hyperparasitic on powdery mildews on various hosts (Hijwegen & Buchenauer 1984), which suggests that they share a similar ecology.

Teratosphaeriaceae Crous & U. Braun, Stud. Mycol. 58: 8. 2007.

Type species: Teratosphaeria fibrillosa Syd. & P. Syd., Ann. Mycol. 10: 40. 1912.

Notes: Since the family was established by Crous et al. (2007a) it has been shown to be too widely defined, incorporating many diverse genera (Crous et al. 2009b, c), and even families such as the Piedraiaceae ( ). The node as such is not well supported, suggesting that as more taxa are added, further families remain to be separated from the Teratosphaeriaceae. Presently it incorporates diverse elements, and even lichens such as Cystocoleus ebeneus and Anisomeridium consobrinum. The identity of the latter strain (CBS 101364) needs to be confirmed, as its position in the tree appears doubtful.

The genus Catenulostroma, which is associated with numerous diverse substrates and habitats (Crous et al. 2007a), is typified by C. protearum, for which an epitype is designated in the present study. Several strains isolated from rock surfaces (Guiedan et al. 2008, Ruibal et al. 2008, 2009, this volume) cluster with Catenulostroma ( ), and appear to represent undescribed species of the latter. Of interest is the fact that the type species of Aulographina, A. pinorum (CBS 302.71, CBS 174.90), which has hysterothecia, clusters in a clade with Catenulostroma microsporum, which has a Teratosphaeria-like teleomorph with pseudothecia (Taylor & Crous 2000, Crous et al. 2004a, 2007a). Isolates of A. pinorum were found to produce a Catenulostroma anamorph in culture. This raises two possibilities, namely that either the incorrect fungus was originally isolated from pine needles (namely Catenulostroma abietis), or that this is a species complex, in which A. pinorum resides. If these strains are indeed confirmed to represent A. pinorum, then it reveals the genus Aulographina to be heterogeneous, as A. eucalypti, which is a major leaf spot pathogen of Eucalyptus (Crous et al. 1989, Park et al. 2000, Carnegie & Keane 2003), clusters distant from A. pinorum. The taxonomy of these taxa is currently being addressed, and will be reported on elsewhere (Cheewangkoon et al., in prep.). During the course of this study some new members of the Teratosphaeriaceae were collected, which are described below: Catenulostroma protearum (Crous & M.E. Palm) Crous & U. Braun, Stud. Mycol. 58: 17. 2007. .

Basionym: Trimmatostroma protearum Crous & M.E. Palm, Mycol. Res. 103: 1303. 1999.

Culture characteristics: On MEA spreading, erumpent, with folded surface, and unevenly lobed, smooth margins; aerial mycelium sparse; surface iron-grey to greenish black, reverse greenish black; reaching 15 mm diam after 2 wk; similar on PDA and OA.

Host range and geographic distribution: Protea, Leucadendron and Hakea spp., South Africa.

Specimens examined: south Africa, on leaves of Protea grandiceps, L. Schroeder, 15 Sept. 1986, holotype BPI 1107849; south Africa, Western Cape Province, Stellenbosch, Assegaibos, on leaves of Leucadendron tinctum, F. Roets, 16 Apr. 2008, epitype designated here CBS H-20338, culture ex-epitype, CPC 15369, 15370 = CBS 125421; ditto, on leaves of Hakea sericea, CBS H-20339, single ascospore culture CPC 15368.

Notes: Catenulostroma protearum was originally described from dead leaves of Protea grandiceps collected in South Africa (Crous & Palm 1999). Unfortunately the cultures died before they could be deposited, and hence the phylogenetic position of Catenulostroma remained uncertain. This proved to be problematic, as the genus was later shown to be heterogeneous (Crous et al. 2007a). The designation of the epitype in the present study clarifies the phylogenetic position of the genus, and reveals Catenulostroma s. str. to represent species that occur in extreme environments, on rocks, or on hard, leathery leaves such as Proteaceae and Gymnospermae.

Devriesia hilliana Crous & U. Braun, sp. nov. MycoBank MB514700. .

Etymology: Named in fond memory of Dr C.F. Hill. “Frank” collected numerous fungi over the years, and sent them to the various international colleagues he knew to be working on these groups. The present species was one of a batch of novel taxa that Frank collected and sent to us for treatment shortly before he had a relapse. Frank's friendship and mycological expertise will be sorely missed.

Devriesiae strelitziae similis, sed conidiis minoribus, (5–)7–10(–12) × (2–)2.5(–3) μm.

Specimen examined: New Zealand, Auckland, Auckland University Campus, Princes Street, on Macrozamia communis, C.F. Hill, 20 Apr. 2008, CBS H-20340 holotype, culture ex-type CPC 15382 = CBS 123187.

Devriesia lagerstroemiae Crous & M.J. Wingf., sp. nov. MycoBank MB514701. .

Etymology: Named after the host on which it occurs, Lagerstroemia.

Devriesiae strelitziae similis, sed conidiis latioribus, (5–)7–10(–12) × (2–)2.5(–3) μm.

Colonies sporulating on OA. Mycelium consisting of smooth, branched, septate, 2–3 μm wide hyphae. Conidiophores rarely micronematous, predominantly macronematous, erect on creeping hyphae, brown, cylindrical with swollen basal cell, thick-walled, smooth, flexuous, 20–90 × 3–4 μm, 5–20-septate. Conidiogenous cells terminal, cylindrical to clavate, polyblastic, pale to medium brown, 5–10 × 2–3(–4) μm; scars somewhat thickened and darkened, not refractive. Ramoconidia medium brown, smooth, subcylindrical, 9–15 × 3–5 μm, (0–)1(–2)-septate, but with clavate apex and several flattened loci that are somewhat darkened and thickened, 1 μm diam. Conidia in branched chains of up to 10, pale brown, smooth, narrowly ellipsoid, 0–1-septate, (5–)8–12(–15) × 2–3(–4) μm; apical conidium with rounded apex, the rest with flattened loci that are somewhat darkened and thickened, not refractive, 0.5–1 μm diam.

Culture characteristics: On MEA erumpent, spreading, with sparse aerial mycelium and irregular margin; surface olivaceous-grey, with patches of iron-grey; reverse iron-grey, reaching 10 mm diam; on PDA similar, but on OA iron-grey, reaching 15 mm diam.

Host range and geographic distribution: Lagerstroemia indica, U.S.A., Louisiana.

Specimen examined: U.S.A., Louisiana, Baton Rouge, Cod & Cook Centre, N30°24'50.3” W91°10'6.6”, on Lagerstroemia indica, P.W. Crous & M.J. Wingfield, holotype CBS H-20341, culture ex-type CPC 14403 = CBS 125422.

Notes: Devriesia lagerstroemiae clusters close to D. hilliana. As far as we know, neither species is heat-resistant, nor forms chlamydospores, and hence the placement in Devriesia is more due to phylogenetic similarity than their ecology.

Devriesia strelitziicola Arzanlou & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB514702. .

Etymology: Named after its host plant, Strelitzia.

Devriesiae strelitziae similis, sed conidiis majoribus, (7–)25–45(–100) × (2–)2.5(–3) μm.

Colonies sporulating on OA. Mycelium consisting of medium brown, smooth, septate, branched, 2–3 μm wide hyphae; chlamydospores not observed. Conidiophores dimorphic. Microconidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells on hyphae, erect, cylindrical, medium brown, smooth with truncate ends, proliferating sympodially, 4–7 × 2–3 μm. Macroconidiophores erect, cylindrical, straight to geniculate-sinuous, medium brown, smooth, unbranched or branched above, 30–100 × 2.5–3 μm, 3–10-septate. Conidiogenous cells terminal or lateral on branched conidiophores, medium brown, smooth, cylindrical, proliferating sympodially, 7–15 × 2.5–3 μm; loci truncate, inconspicuous, 1–1.5 μm wide. Conidia medium brown, smooth, guttulate, subcylindrical to narrowly obclavate, apex obtuse to truncate, base truncate, occurring in branched chains, widest at the basal septum, (7–)25–45(–100) × (2–)2.5(–3) μm, (0–)3–6(–13)-septate; hila inconspicuous to somewhat darkened and thickened, not refractive, 1–1.5 μm wide.

Culture characteristics: On MEA erumpent, slow growing, with moderate aerial mycelium and smooth margins; surface mouse-grey, reverse iron-grey, reaching 8 mm diam after 2 wk; similar on PDA and OA.

Host range and geographic distribution: Strelitzia sp., South Africa.

Specimen examined: south Africa, KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, Botanical Garden near Reunion, on leaves of Strelitzia sp., 5 Feb. 2005, W. Gams & H. Glen, CBS H-20342, holotype, culture ex-type X1045 = CBS 122480.

Notes: Devriesia strelitziicola is the second Devriesia species to be described from this host (Arzanlou et al. 2008a). The genus Devriesia was originally established to accommodate a group of heat-resistant, Cladosporium-like fungi (Seifert et al. 2004), and it appears that a different generic name will have to be introduced to accommodate those taxa occurring on plants. Further collections are required, however, to clarify the generic boundaries of Devriesia (Crous et al. 2007b).

Hortaea thailandica Crous & K.D. Hyde, sp. nov. MycoBank MB514703. .

Etymology: Named after the country where it was collected, Thailand.

Hortaeae werneckii similis, sed conidiis brunneis, verruculosis, majoribus, (9–)10–13(–15) × (4–)5–6(–7) μm.

Colonies sporulating on MEA. Mycelium consisting of pale brown, smooth, septate, branched, 3–4 μm wide hyphae that become darker and thick-walled in the conidiogenous region. Conidiogenous cells integrated, intercalary on hyphae, reduced to short cylindrical loci, 2–2.5 μm wide, 1–4 μm tall; collarettes inconspicuous to minute; proliferating 1–2 times percurrently at apex. Conidia ellipsoid, aseptate, pale to medium brown, (4–)5–7(–9) × (2.5–)3 μm, verruculose, apex obtuse, base subtruncate with minute collarette; becoming swollen and elongate at maturity, with 1–4 transverse and 1–2 oblique septa; (9–)10–13(–15) × (4–) 5–6(–9) μm; hila inconspicuous, up to 2 μm wide, frequently with visible marginal frill; microcyclic conidiation commonly observed on OA, MEA and PDA.

Culture characteristics: On MEA erumpent, spreading; surface irregular, folded, greenish black, with sparse olivaceous-grey aerial mycelium and smooth, lobed, margins; reverse greenish black; reaching 12 mm diam after 2 wk; similar on OA and PDA.

Host range and geographic distribution: Syzygium siamense, Thailand.

Specimen examined: Thailand, Khao Yai National Park, N14°14'42.6” E101°22'15.7”, on leaves of Syzygium siamense, in lesions with a cercosporoid fungus, 27 Mar. 2009, P.W. Crous & K.D. Hyde, holotype in BBH, isotype CBS H-20343, culture ex-type CPC 16652, 16651 = CBS 125423, also in BCC.

Notes: Similar to Hortaea werneckii, which is also frequently isolated from lesions in association with plant pathogenic fungi, H. thailandica occurred in leaf spots in association with a cercosporoid fungus. It is distinct from H. werneckii by forming larger conidia that turn medium brown and verruculose with age. Several other taxa are newly placed in the Teratosphaeriaceae in the present study that require further evaluation. Xenomeris juniperi, a bitunicate ascomycete on Jupinerus with pseudothecia associated with a stroma, and pigmented, 1-septate ascospores, clusters close to Teratosphaeria species occurring on Protea and Eucalyptus, where the ascomata are also associated with stromatic tissue (Taylor & Crous 2000, Crous et al. 2006c). Fresh collections of this fungus would be required, however, to resolve its status. The occurrence of Sporidesmium species in the Teratosphaeriaceae should be interpreted with care, as the genus is polyphyletic, and further studies are required to resolve its status (Shenoy et al. 2006, Crous et al. 2008a, Yang et al., in prep.).

Davidiellaceae C.L. Schoch, Spatafora, Crous & Shoemaker, Mycologia 98: 1048. 2006.

Type species: Davidiella tassiana (De Not.) Crous & U. Braun, Mycol. Progr. 3: 8. 2003.

Notes: The Davidiellaceae was introduced for the genus Davidiella, which has Cladosporium anamorphs. As shown in the present analysis, however, allied genera such as Toxicocladosporium, Verrucocladosporium, Rachicladosporium and Graphiopsis also belong in this family. Of interest is the position of Melanodothis caricis in Cladosporium s. str. This fungus, which infects florets of Carex and Kobresia, forms a stroma that gives rise to several immersed ascomata with bitunicate, oblong asci that are aparaphysate, and 0–(2)-septate, hyaline, 9–14.5 × 2–4 μm ascospores. In culture, a hyaline, Ramularia-like anamorph developed, with sympodial proliferation, catenulate conidia, with thickened, darkened loci (Arnold 1971). Although these characteristics are atypical of the Davidiella/Cladosporium species in this clade, the position of Melanodothis caricis in this family cannot simply be disregarded. However, the ex-type culture of this fungus (CBS 860.72) proved to be sterile.

A further unconfirmed sequence (CBS 354.29, culture sterile, but fast growing, grey-brown, Cladosporium-like), is that submitted as Sphaerulina polyspora. The culture was accessioned in 1929, deposited by A.E. Jenkins, and there is reason to believe that it was derived from BPI 623724!, which is authentic for the species, and collected by F.A. Wolf in May 1924. Wolf (1925) described this fungus from twigs of Oxydendron arboretum with die-back disease symptoms, collected in Raleigh, North Carolina. Sphaerulina polyspora (623723 = Type!) has pseudothecia with aparaphysate, bitunicate asci, and ascospores that are hyaline, 3–5-septate, 20–24 × 6–7 μm. On the host it was linked to a Phoma-like anamorph, which also grew similar in culture (yeast-like budding), and has hyaline conidia which are ellipsoidal, 7–8 × 3.8–4 μm.

Colonies were reported as slow-growing, grey, appressed, with germinating ascospores forming yeast-like budding cells, and rarely having hyphae that extended from the margin of the colonies. The link between Sphaerulina-like species, with Selenophoma and Aureobasidium synanamorphs was recently illustrated by Cheewangkoon et al. (2009). Although members of the Dothideomycetes, these taxa do not cluster in the Davidiellaceae, and hence it seems a fair assumption that CBS 354.29 is not representative of Sphaerulina polyspora.
