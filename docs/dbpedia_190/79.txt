INTRODUCTION

Fungi belonging to the genus Cercospora (Mycosphaerellaceae, Capnodiales) are common etiological agents of leaf spots, but some also cause necrotic lesions on flowers, fruits, bracts, seeds and pedicels of many woody and herbaceous plants in a range of climates worldwide (Ellis 1976, Crous & Braun 2003, Agrios 2005, Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a).

Cercospora is a species-rich genus of cercosporoid fungi that was established by Fresenius (1863) for passalora-like species with pluriseptate conidia. During the course of the next 100 years, the concept of Cercospora had been continuously widened (Saccardo 1880, Solheim 1930) and all kinds of superficially similar species, with or without conspicuous conidiogenous loci, with hyaline or pigmented conidia, formed singly or in chains, were assigned to this genus (Braun et al. 2013). In 1954, the genus was monographed by Chupp (1954), who treated 1419 Cercospora species while applying this broad generic concept. He also stated that species of Cercospora were generally host-specific and used this argument as the basis of formulating the concept that each plant host genus or family would have its own Cercospora species. The number of Cercospora species increased rapidly to more than 3000, which led Pollack (1987) to publish her annotated list of Cercospora names. Since the introduction of the genus, several attempts to split Cercospora s. lat. into smaller generic units have been made by applying a combination of characters such as conidiomatal structure, mycelium, conidiophores, conidiogenous cells, and conidia (e.g. Deighton 1973, 1979, 1983, Ellis 1971, 1976, Braun 1995, 1998). Crous & Braun (2003) published an annotated list of the names published in Cercospora and Passalora and used the structure of conidiogenous loci and hila as well as the absence or presence of pigmentation in conidiophores and conidia in their revision. They recognised 659 names in Cercospora, with a further 281 species names reduced to synonymy with C. apii s. lat., since they were morphologically not or barely distinguishable from C. apii s. str. Braun et al. (2013, 2014, 2015a, b, 2016) published a series of papers in a stepwise approach at plant family level in order to update the monograph of Cercospora and allied genera.

Scientific advances in DNA sequencing and supplementary software to store, share and compare the emerging molecular data have revolutionised the procedures underpinning the discovery and identification of fungal taxa, including the cercosporoid fungi (Crous & Groenewald 2005, Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a, Nguanhom et al. 2015, Guatimosim et al. 2017). Numerous molecular studies of Cercospora species have been conducted based on ITS nrDNA data as well as multi-gene approaches (Stewart et al. 1999, Crous et al. 2000, 2004b, 2009a, b, Goodwin et al. 2001, Tessmann et al. 2001, Pretorius et al. 2003, Groenewald et al. 2005, 2006, 2013, Montenegro-Calderón et al. 2011, Bakhshi et al. 2012b, 2015a, Nguanhom et al. 2015, Soares et al. 2015, Albu et al. 2016, Guatimosim et al. 2017, Guillin et al. 2017). A comprehensive and detailed molecular examination of Cercospora s. str. based on a multi-locus DNA sequence dataset of five genomic loci including the ITS (ITS1, 5.8S nrRNA gene and ITS2), together with parts of four protein coding genes, viz. translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1), actin (actA), calmodulin (cmdA) and histone H3 (his3) was conducted by Groenewald et al. (2013). The main conclusion of this study was that C<i>.</i> apii s. lat. could not be confirmed as a plurivorous monophyletic species, and that several lineages originally referred to C. apii s. lat., or considered close to this complex based on morphology (Crous & Braun 2003), were separated as distinct phylogenetic species. Hence, speciation within Cercospora s. str. is more complicated than formerly assumed, and far from being resolved. To date, multi-locus DNA sequence analyses combined with ecology, morphology and cultural characteristics, referred to as the Consolidated Species Concept (Quaedvlieg et al. 2014), proved the most effective method for the delimitation of Cercospora species (Groenewald et al. 2010, 2013).

At a higher taxonomic level, among the genera of cercosporoid fungi, the monophyly of Cercospora s. str. has until recently been tested based on phylogenetic association of taxa with the type species of Cercospora, C. apii (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a, Braun & Crous 2016). Bakhshi et al. (2015b) recovered some cercospora-like isolates from Ammi majus, and in their subsequent multi-gene phylogenetic study (28S nrDNA, ITS, actA, tef1 and his3), elucidated these isolates to represent a new genus, Neocercospora, clustering in a clade in Mycosphaerellaceae apart from Cercospora s. str., suggesting that cercospora-like morphologies are not necessarily part of a single monophyletic genus. This finding led to the conclusion that identification and descriptions of new cercospora-like taxa should be avoided without support of molecular sequence data, not only at species but also at generic level.

Species of Cercospora are known to be widely distributed, occurring on a broad range of plant hosts in many climate zones of Iran (Bakhshi et al. 2012, Hesami et al. 2012, Pirnia et al. 2012), where the biodiversity of the genus has recently received much attention (Bakhshi et al. 2015a, b). The most inclusive study was that of Bakhshi et al. (2015a), who compared 161 Cercospora isolates, recovered from 74 host species from Iran based on DNA sequence data of five genomic loci (ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA and his3), host, cultural, and morphological data, revealing a rich species diversity. However, the problem concerning species delimitation in Cercospora due to the high level of conservation among DNA sequences of commonly used loci, (i.e. ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, and his3), could not be resolved. Furthermore, cryptic clades in several species complexes remained unresolved in the five-gene phylogenetic tree, for example C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. cf. flagellaris, and Cercospora sp. G (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to assess three additional potential candidate gene regions including the partial β-tubulin (tub2) gene, part of the second largest subunit of RNA-polymerase II (rpb2) gene, and part of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) gene, in order to firstly generate an eight-gene DNA dataset to resolve cryptic taxa within these species complexes, and secondly to identify the best barcoding gene(s) for species resolution in Cercospora.

TAXONOMY

Species delimitation in the genus Cercospora in this study follows the Consolidated Species Concept accepted in recent revisions of the taxonomy of cercosporoid fungi (e.g. Groenewald et al. 2013, Crous et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a, Videira et al. 2017). Twenty-eight lineages of Cercospora were resolved based on the clustering and support in the Bayesian tree obtained from the combined ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2, and gapdh alignment ( , ). Of these, 15 species including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. iranica, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. T, C. violae, C. zebrina, and C. cf. zinnia, were the same as those also accepted before in the five-gene phylogenetic tree (ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, and his3) (Bakhshi et al. 2015a). However, the eight-gene phylogenetic tree separated strains previously recognised as C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, C. cf. flagellaris, and Cercospora sp. G, based on five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) into at least three, two, two, four and two well-supported clades respectively ( ). Some of these clades are supported by the host range or morphological characters of the isolates and are therefore described as new below.

Cercospora apii complex

The 16 isolates previously recognised as C. apii based on five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) are assigned here to three lineages based on the eight-gene phylogenetic tree, host association, and morphology, including C. apii s. str., C. uwebrauniana sp. nov., and C. plantaginis ( , part 2). The results of allele group designation for the isolates in this complex detected one, four, two, two, four, three, four and two allele groups for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2, and gapdh sequences, respectively ( ).

Constantinescu (CBS 252.67 – epitype designated here, MBT 383093, preserved as a metabolically inactive culture).

Description: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular to subcircular, 1–4 mm diam, white to grey with distinct raised brown borders. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in loose fascicles, arising from a moderately developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, dark brown stroma, to 30 μm diam; conidiophores brown at the base, becoming paler towards the apex, 2–10-septate, straight to geniculate-sinuous due to sympodial proliferation, simple, uniform in width, somewhat constricted at the proliferating point, (45−)60–85 × 4–5 μm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or lateral, pale brown to brown, proliferating sympodially, 8–25 × 3.5–5 μm, multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened and somewhat refractive, apical or formed on shoulders caused by sympodial proliferation, 2–3 μm diam. Conidia solitary, subcylindrical, filiform to acicular, straight to mildly curved, hyaline, (40−)60–70(−105) × 2–3.5 μm, (4−)8–13(−17)-septate, with subobtuse to subacute apices and truncate bases; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–2.5 μm diam.

Notes: Based on the results of the eight-gene phylogenetic tree, all isolates obtained from P. lanceolata from five different provinces in Iran together with a European isolate from this host plant, previously recognised as C. apii based on a five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a), cluster separately from the other isolates in this clade ( , part 2). Three species of Cercospora, including C. apii, C. pantoleuca and C. plantaginis, have been reported from Plantago (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). This species is morphologically close to C. plantaginis described from Italy on P. lanceolata (Chupp 1954). Since one European isolate from P. lanceolata in Romania (CBS 252.67 = CPC 5084) also resides in this clade, we designate an epitype here for this species, and fix the application of the name C. plantaginis to this clade.

Cercospora uwebrauniana M. Bakhshi & Crous, sp. nov.

MycoBank MB827521

( )

Etymology: Named in honour of Uwe Braun, who has published extensively on the genus Cercospora, and also provided a modern treatment for allied genera of Mycosphaerellaceae.

Diagnosis: Differs from C. taurica in the cylindrical conidia with truncate or subtruncate bases and somewhat shorter and wider conidia, (23−)38–48(−70) × 4.5–8 μm vs 40–110 × (2.5−)4–6(−7) μm in C. taurica.

Type: Iran: Ardabil Province: Moghan, on Heliotropium europaeum (Boraginaceae), Oct. 2012, M. Bakhshi (IRAN 16864F – holotype; CCTU 1200 = CBS 138581 – ex-type culture).

Description: Leaf spots distinct, circular to irregular, 3–10 mm, grey-brown to dark brown, surrounded by brown margin. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores in moderately dense fascicles, arising from the upper cells of a moderately developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma, to 40 μm wide; conidiophores straight to slightly geniculate, pale brown to brown, unbranched, regular in width, (60−)115–145(−230) × 3.5–5.5 μm, 2–9-septate. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, brown, proliferating sympodially, 15–35 × 3.5–5.5 μm, mostly mono-local, sometimes multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, apical or formed on the shoulders caused by geniculation, 2–3.5 μm. Conidia solitary, hyaline, subcylindrical to cylindrical, straight or slightly curved, truncate to subtruncate at the base, obtuse to rounded at the apex, (23−)38–48(−70) × 4.5–8 μm, (0−)3–4(−9)-septate; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–3 μm diam.

Notes: Two isolates, obtained from H. europaeum in different provinces in Iran, clustered in a small clade within C. apii s. str. ( , part 2). This independent clade is supported by tef1, his3 and tub2 from C. apii s. str. Morphologically, these two strains are completely distinct from their most closely related species in the phylogenetic tree, namely C. apii (conidia acicular, subacute or subobtusely rounded at the apex, (30−)65–80(−115) × 3–5 μm), C. beticola (conidia subacute to acute apex, (40−)90–140(−300) × 2–5 μm), C. gamsiana (conidia subobtuse at the apex, (27−)49–62(−100) × 2–4 μm) and C. plantaginis (conidia subobtuse to subacute apices, (40−)60–70(−105) × 2–3.5 μm), by the obtuse to rounded apex, wider and shorter conidia ((23−)38–48(−70) × 4.5–8 μm), and are regarded as a separate species, appearing to be confined to H. europaeum.

Presently, three species of Cercospora have been described from Heliotropium, C. apii, C. heliotropiicola, and C. taurica (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). Cercospora uwebrauniana differs from C. taurica in the cylindrical conidia with truncate or subtruncate bases and somewhat shorter and wider conidia, (23−)38–48(−70) × 4.5–8 μm vs 40–110 × (2.5−)4–6(−7) μm in C. taurica (Braun 2002). In addition, C. taurica has obclavate-cylindrical conidia with obconically truncate bases and rather wider conidiophores, 4–9 μm diam (Braun 2002). Cercospora heliotropiicola is morphologically quite distinct from C. uwebrauniana in having acicular or subulate, much thinner (2–3 μm wide) and longer (to 300 μm long) conidia with subobtuse or acute apex (Pons & Sutton 1996).

Additional specimen examined: Iran: Guilan Province: Astara, on H. europaeum, Jun. 2012, M. Bakhshi (IRAN 17096F, CCTU 1134).

Cercospora armoraciae complex

The 10 isolates previously recognised as C. armoraciae based on a five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) are assigned to two lineages here, based on the eight-gene phylogenetic tree, including C. armoraciae s. str. and C. bizzozeriana ( , part 1). The results of allele group designation for the isolates in this complex revealed one, three, one, two, seven, three, three and two allele groups for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh sequences, respectively ( ).

Type: Italy: Padova, on Lepidium latifolium (Brassicaceae), (Berlese, Malpighia 1: tab. XIV, fig. 23, 1887 – lectotype, designated here, MBT 383343); Romania: Fundulea, on Cardaria draba, isol. by O. Constantinescu [deposited in the CBS culture collection in 1967] (CBS 258.67 – epitype designated here, MBT 383154, preserved as a metabolically inactive culture).

Notes: Type material of C. bizzozeriana is not preserved in Saccardo's herbarium (see Gola 1930). Therefore, the original illustration published by Saccardo & Berlese (in Berlese 1888) is designated as lectotype (according to Art. 9.3 and 9.4). Berlese's article “Fungi veneti novi vel critici” was split into several parts published in Malpighia 1 (1887) and 2 (1888). The description of C. bizzozeriana was published in vol 2, but with reference to tab. XIV, fig. 23 already issued in vol. 1.

Description: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular, 1–5 mm, white to white-grey with grey to black dots (stroma with conidiophores) and definite brown border. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in dense fascicles, arising from a well-developed, brown stroma, to 75 μm diam; conidiophores brown, 1–5-septate, straight to geniculate-sinuous due to sympodial proliferation, simple, sometimes branched, uniform in width, sometimes constricted at the proliferating point, (30−)50–60(−80) × 4–7 μm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or lateral, pale brown to brown, proliferating sympodially, 10–25 × 3–6 μm, multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened and somewhat refractive, apical, lateral or formed on shoulders caused by geniculation, 1.5–3 μm diam. Conidia solitary, obclavate-cylindrical, straight to slightly curved, hyaline, (20−)60–80(−125) × 3–6 μm, 2–10-septate, with obtuse apices and subtruncate or obconically truncate bases; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–3 μm diam.

Notes: Isolates obtained from different host species including Tanacetum balsamita, Capparis spinosa and Cardaria draba clustered in a clade distinct from the ex-type isolate of C. armoraciae, and are regarded as a separate taxon. In addition, five isolates obtained from Car. draba (three from Iran and two from Romania) all cluster in this clade. Until now, three species of Cercospora are known from these host species, including C. bizzozeriana, C. chrysanthemi and C. capparis (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). Cercospora chrysanthemi is in the C. apii s. lat. complex (Crous & Braun 2003). Cercospora capparis differs from this species by the narrower (4–5.5 μm diam) conidiophores and 3–5 μm diam conidia (Chupp 1954). The species is morphologically close to C. bizzozeriana which was described from Italy on Car. draba (Chupp 1954). Since two European isolates from Car. draba in Romania also reside in this clade, we designate an epitype here (ex-epitype culture CBS 258.67 = CPC 5061) for this species, and fix the application of C. bizzozeriana to this clade.

Cercospora beticola complex

The 16 isolates previously recognised as C<i>.</i> beticola based on a five-gene phylogenetic analysis (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a), are assigned to two lineages based on the eight-gene phylogenetic analysis ( , part 2).

Type: Italy: Vittorio (Treviso), on Beta vulgaris (Chenopodiaceae), Sep. 1897, P.A. Saccardo, Fungi ital. no. 197 (PAD – neotype designated by Groenewald et al. 2005); Ravenna, on B. vulgaris, 10 Jul. 2003, V. Rossi (CBS 116456 = CPC 11557 – epitype designated by Groenewald et al. 2005).

Description: Leaf spots amphigenous, distinct, circular to subcircular, 1–7 mm diam, white-grey, with grey dots (stroma with conidiophores), surrounded by distinct brown border. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in loose to dense fascicles, emerging through stomatal openings or erumpent through the cuticle, arising from the upper cells of a moderately to well-developed brown stroma, to 110 μm diam; conidiophores brown, becoming paler towards apex, 2–8-septate, thick-walled, straight to geniculate-sinuous, unbranched, uniform in width, (30−)80–110(−185) × 4–5(−6) μm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or lateral, unbranched, brown, smooth, proliferating sympodially, 10–30 × 3.5–5.5 μm, mostly multi-local, sometimes mono-local; loci apical or formed on shoulders caused by geniculation, thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–2 μm diam. Conidia solitary, subcylindrical, filiform to acicular, straight to variously curved, hyaline, 3–15(−29)-septate, apex subacute to acute, base truncate to subtruncate, (40−)90–140(−300) × 2–5 μm; hila thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–2.5 μm diam.

Note: This clade includes the ex-epitype culture of C. beticola (CBS 116456 = CPC 11557), therefore we fixed the application of the name C. beticola s. str. to this clade.

( )

Etymology: Dedicated to the recently deceased Walter Gams to honour his contribution to mycology.

Diagnosis: Morphologically distinct from species of the C. apii complex in the irregularly constricted, often conical and attenuated at the apex conidiophores, and conidia with long obconically truncate bases; sporulation is restricted to the terminal part of conidiophores.

Type: Iran: Ardabil Province: Moghan, on leaves of Malva neglecta (Malvaceae), Oct. 2011, M. Bakhshi (IRAN 17011F – holotype; CBS 144962 = CCTU 1074 = CPC 24909– ex-type culture).

Description: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular to irregular, 3–8 mm diam, grey to brown. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in moderately dense fascicles, arising from a well-developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma, to 45 μm diam; conidiophores pale brown, 1–5-septate, geniculate-sinuous, irregularly constricted, unbranched, moderately thin-walled, irregular in width, often conical and attenuated at the apex, sporulation is restricted at the terminal part of conidiophores, 45–60(−110) × 4–5 μm. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, pale brown to olivaceous-brown, proliferating sympodially, 10–25 × 3.5–5 μm, uni- or multi-local; loci distinctly thickened, darkened and somewhat refractive, apical, circumspersed, 1.5–2 μm diam. Conidia solitary, subcylindrical to obclavate or somewhat narrowed towards the tip, straight to slightly curved, hyaline, thin-walled, (27−)49–62(−100) × 2–4 μm, distinctly 3–10-septate, subobtuse at the apex and long obconically truncate at the base; hila distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, 1.5–2.5 μm diam.

Notes: Until now, 14 species names in Cercospora have been introduced from these host species, including C. apii, C. althaeina, C. beticola, C. hyalospora (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. malvarum (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. malvicola, C. sigesbeckiae, C. peckiana (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. rumicis, C. sonchi (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. sonchicola (C. apii s. lat. complex), C. sonchifolia, C. sesami (C. apii s. lat. complex), and C. sesamigena (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). Cercospora gamsiana is phylogenetically clearly distinguishable from C. apii, C. althaeina, C. beticola, C. sigesbeckiae and C. rumicis (Bakhshi et al. 2015a) ( , part 2). It is morphologically well distinguished from species of the C. apii complex and other species of Cercospora by its irregularly constricted, thin-walled, often conical and attenuated at the apex conidiophores and, conidia with long obconically truncate bases; sporulation is restricted at the terminal part of conidiophores.

Cercospora cf. flagellaris complex

The 61 isolates previously recognised as C. cf. flagellaris based on a five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) cluster into at least four distinct phylogenetic clades based on the eight-gene phylogenetic tree including C. cf. gossypii, C. cf. flagellaris clades 1, 2 and 3 ( , part 3). Three, four, six, seven, seven, seven, two and nine allele groups were distinguished for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh sequences, respectively ( ).

Cercospora cf. gossypiiLall et al., Indian Phytopath. 14: 116 (1962) [“1961”].( )

Description: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular to subcircular, 1–4 mm diam, with grey-brown centre and purple-brown margins. Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in dense fascicles, arising from the upper cells of a well-developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma, to 65 μm diam; conidiophores pale brown to brown, simple, rarely branched, 1–4-septate, straight or flexuous caused by sympodial proliferation, almost uniform in width, often constricted at proliferating point, (35−)60–75(−110) × 4–5 μm. Conidiogenous cells terminal or integrated, pale brown, smooth, proliferating sympodially, 10–45 × 3.5–5 μm, multi-local; loci thickened, darkened, refractive, apical, lateral, circumspersed, 1.5–2.5 μm diam. Conidia solitary, smooth, subcylindrical to obclavate, straight or mildly curved, successively tapering towards the apex, hyaline, 1–7-septate, apex subacute to subobtuse, base truncate to short obconically truncate, (30−)65–90(−160) × 2–4 μm; hila distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, 1–2 μm diam.

Notes: This clade includes two isolates obtained from G. herbaceum and Hib. trionum, both in the Malvaceae ( , part 3). Cercospora althaeina, C. fagopyri, C. malayensis (C. apii s. lat.), C. gossypii, C. gossypiicola, C. gossypina and C. lhuillieri (C. apii s. lat.) are six Cercospora species which have been reported until now on Gossypium and Hibiscus host genera (Crous & Braun 2003, https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/). This species is phylogenetically distinct from C. althaeina ( ) and C. fagopyri (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a). Cercospora gossypina is distinguished from this species in that it induces wider leaf spots (0.5–10 mm), and has unbranched, longer and wider conidiophores (75–250 × 4–6.5 μm) (Hsieh & Goh 1990). Cercospora malayensis is distinguished from C. cf. gossypii in that it has elliptical, yellow to tan leaf spots; unbranched, 1–8-septate conidiophores and mostly terminal conidiogenous cells and somewhat longer conidia (50–270 × 2.5–4 μm) (Little 1987). Cercospora gossypiicola (Narayan et al. 2001) and C. lhuillieri (Montegut 1967) resemble C. apii (with acicular conidia), but are different. They do not have stromata, and form less conidiophores per fascicle. The description of C. gossypii (Lall et al. 1961) is rather close to this taxon. The type of C. gossypii is from India. Thus, fresh material is needed from India to resolve the application of the name C. gossypii.

Specimens examined: Iran: Ardabil Province: Moghan, on Gossypium herbaceum (Malvaceae), Oct. 2011, M. Bakhshi (IRAN 17073F, CCTU 1070 = CBS 136137); Moghan, on Hibiscus trionum (Malvaceae), Oct. 2011, M. Bakhshi (IRAN 17074F, CCTU 1055 = IRAN 2650C).

Clade 1; Clade 2; Clade 3

In view of the overlap between the morphological characters of these three clades, we provide a single over-arching description here.

Description: Mycelium internal. Caespituli amphigenous, brown. Conidiophores aggregated in loose to dense fascicles, arising from a weakly to well-developed, intraepidermal and substomatal, brown stroma; conidiophores pale brown to brown, 2–18-septate, straight, sinuous to distinctly geniculate, flexuous, simple, unbranched or rarely branched, uniform or irregular in width, sometimes constricted at septa and proliferating point, (75–)130–165(–300) × 4–5.5 μm in clade 1; (30–)80–120(–210) × 3.5–5.5 μm in clade 2; (25–)60–95(–230) × 3.5–5.5 μm in clade 3. Conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, proliferating sympodially, mono- or multi-local; loci thickened, darkened, apical, lateral or circumspersed, 1.5–2.5 μm diam. Conidia solitary, hyaline, subcylindrical, filiform to obclavate, straight to slightly curved, with truncate to obconically truncate base and subacute to subobtuse apices, (60–)125–170(–300) × 3–5 μm, 5–20-septate in clade 1; (25–)60–95(–260) × 2.5–4.5 μm, (2–)8–11(–25)-septate in clade 2; (30–)100–155(–320) × 2–5 μm, (2–)10–14(–28)-septate in clade 3; hila distinctly thickened, darkened, refractive, 1–2 μm diam.

Notes: Screening the remaining isolates of C. cf. flagellaris, with three more genomic loci in this study (tub2, rpb2 and gapdh), clusters them into at least three distinct clades in the eight-gene phylogenetic tree ( , part 3); clade 1 is sister to C. cf. gossypii; clade 3 is sister to C. convolvulicola and clade 2 is sister to the clade including C. cf. flagellaris clade 3 and C. convolvulicola. However, there is a high level of variation in morphological characteristics between different isolates of these three clades. In addition, several isolates originating from diverse hosts and families reside in these three clades and there is also overlap between host ranges among them. Different names can therefore be applied to these clades, and therefore we prefer to simply regard them as distinct phylogenetic species for now. To resolve their taxonomy, fresh collections authentic for the names (based on host and country) need to be recollected and included in future studies.

Cercospora sp. G complex

The 16 isolates previously recognised as Cercospora sp. G based on a five-gene phylogenetic tree (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a) cluster into two distinct phylogenetic clades based on the eight-gene phylogenetic tree ( , part 1). One, four, one, two, two, two, three and two allele groups were detected for the ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh sequences, respectively ( ).

Notes: Isolates of Cercospora sp. G clustered in two distinct clades with high posterior probability in the eight-gene phylogenetic tree ( , part 1). However, several isolates from diverse host families cluster in these two clades, to which different names can be applied. Moreover, there is also overlap between host ranges of the two clades. On the other hand, there is no morphological basis to divide them into two distinct species. Based on the gene loci screened in the present study, we were unable to resolve the taxonomy of these isolates and for now prefer to treat them as unresolved phylogenetic species. As with C. cf. flagellaris, in order to resolve their taxonomy, fresh collections from the same host and country as the original material need to be recollected and included in future studies.

Identification of the best-performing DNA barcode

Kimura-2-parameter values

The Kimura-2-parameter distribution graphs ( ) visualise the inter- and intraspecific distances per locus corresponding to the barcoding gap (Hebert et al. 2003, Schoch et al. 2012). A useful barcoding locus should have no overlap between the inter- and intraspecific K2P distances and generally should have an average interspecific distance that is at least ten times as high as the average intraspecific distance of that locus (Quaedvlieg et al. 2012, Verkley et al. 2013, Stielow et al. 2015).

The eight tested loci showed varying degrees of overlap in their K2P distribution between inter- and intraspecific variation graphs ( ). In this dataset, the average interspecific variation in ITS dataset was very low (0.002) compared to its intraspecific variation (0.0005), leading to a very low inter- to intraspecific variation ratios of 4:1 for this locus ( , ). This low ratio is far below the recommended 10:1 ratio, indicating a general lack of natural variation within the ITS locus, making it ill-suited for effective identification of the individual species of Cercospora. Due to the presence of introns in the seven protein coding loci, these genes provide much higher interspecific variation than the more conserved ITS locus. These protein coding genes had K2P inter- to intraspecific variation ratios of 127:1 for tef1, 76:1 for cmdA, 74:1 for rpb2, 71:1 for tub2, 44:1 for gapdh, 15:1 for actA and 13:1 for his3 ( ), making them all suitable for reliable species resolution of Cercospora spp. As the tef1, cmdA, rpb2, tub2 and gapdh have the largest barcoding gap, these loci should give the highest species resolution. However, all of these genes do have overlap between the inter- and intraspecific K2P distances (as is evident in the graphs of ), suggesting that no one of them can serve as a single ideal barcoding locus for Cercospora spp.

Molecular phylogenetic resolution (clade recovery)

Based on the results of the individual gene tree assessments, no single gene region was found which could reliably distinguish all species, and occurrences of the same sequence(s) shared between multiple species were observed in each locus.

The ITS phylogeny had low resolution and was only able to distinguish C. chenopodii, C. solani and C. sorghicola from the other included species. The remaining loci had different levels of resolution. The gapdh region was more effective and could resolve 61 % of 28 lineages, whereas his3, tub2, actA, tef1, cmdA and rpb2 had respectively 48, 43, 43, 39, 32 and 32 % clade recovery. Based on the gapdh region, we were able to distinguish 17 of the 28 species clades, including C. althaeina, C. armoraciae, C. bizzozeriana, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cf. flagellaris clade 1, C. cf. flagellaris clade 2, C. cf. gossypii, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. G clade 1, Cercospora sp. G clade 2, C. violae and C. cf. zinnia; whereas, 13 species clades including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. uwebrauniana, C. violae, C. zebrina and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the his3 phylogeny; 12 species clades including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. iranica, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. T, C. uwebrauniana and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the tub2 phylogeny; 12 species clades including C. althaeina, C. chenopodii, C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. violae, C. zebrina and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the actA phylogeny; 11 species clades including C. bizzozeriana, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. uwebrauniana, C. violae and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the tef1 phylogeny; nine species clades including C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. iranica, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, Cercospora sp. T, C. violae and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the cmdA phylogeny; and nine species clades including C. bizzozeriana, C. chenopodii, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. pseudochenopodii, C. cf. richardiicola, C. solani, C. sorghicola, C. zebrina and C. cf. zinniae were distinguished in the rpb2 phylogeny.

Therefore, the gapdh phylogeny displayed a high resolution and had the highest clade recovery and was responsible for resolving most of the cryptic taxa within C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, Cercospora sp. G, and C. cf. flagellaris.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we re-assessed species of the genus Cercospora using a combined approach based on the evaluation of an eight-gene molecular DNA sequence dataset, host, and morphological data (in those cases where morphological variation was present). In recent years, the rapid advance of molecular techniques has brought about the possibility of a more precise species delimitation and a better consideration of the evolution of fungi. It is well-known that many fungal taxa based on morphology or on sequence data of the commonly used fungal barcode ITS region of the nrDNA operon (Schoch et al. 2012) hide cryptic species complexes when molecular data from multiple gene regions are considered (Lombard et al. 2010, Cabral et al. 2012, Crous et al. 2013, Groenewald et al. 2013, Quaedvlieg et al. 2013, Woudenberg et al. 2013). This is most likely an underestimation for many fungal taxa. For instance, the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, once considered to be a single species, has been shown to include at least 31 cryptic taxa (Damm et al. 2012). In the present study, phylogenetic inference also revealed cryptic species complexes that could not be distinguished based on geography, host association, morphology, or ITS sequence data alone.

Before this study, Groenewald et al. (2013) and Bakhshi et al. (2015a) inferred phylogenies of Cercospora based on sequence data of five genomic loci (ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA and his3). Their results showed the importance of all five loci in a combined analysis for Cercospora taxonomy (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a). Despite this, the sequences of these five loci were too conserved in Cercospora, and it was not possible to identify a single gene as the best DNA barcoding locus. In addition, several species complexes remained unresolved (Groenewald et al. 2013, Bakhshi et al. 2015a). To overcome these deficiencies, three more potential candidate gene regions, tub2, rpb2, and gapdh, were amplified and sequenced for Cercospora isolates previously investigated by Bakhshi et al. (2015a) and some related reference isolates investigated by Groenewald et al. (2013). Phylogenetic performance of the eight loci (ITS, tef1, actA, cmdA, his3, tub2, rpb2 and gapdh) were assessed based on the inter-/intraspecific distance ratio and clade recovery. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes we analysed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire genus. However, gapdh emerged as a strong candidate for improved species delimitation in Cercospora and provides better insight, especially into species complexes. Groenewald et al. (2013) evaluated this gene in the Cercospora sp. Q species complex and their results also showed high variation in this gene. The performance of gapdh in species delimitation has been also reported in other fungal groups, including Alternaria (Woudenberg et al. 2013) and the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). Additionally, when using the gapdh gene, cmdA sequences are crucial to distinguish some species of Cercospora. We therefore recommend gapdh as the gene for species delimitation in Cercospora. However, it needs to be combined with cmdA, tef1 and tub2 to obtain a robust species identification. In addition, data from the ITS, actA, rpb2, and his3, have been useful, and were at times necessary, to provide clear evidence of multi-gene phylogenetic concordance to separate cryptic species.

The amplification of gapdh with the available primers was not, however, easy, and we need to design new primer sets for gapdh in Cercospora derived from the sequences generated. On the other hand, lack of ex-type or reliable sequences in public databases is a serious problem in the accurate molecular identification of Cercospora species, and it is essential to also amplify at least the gapdh and tub2 genes for all of the reference isolates used by Groenewald et al. (2013) in the future.

One of the main goals of this project was to generate an eight-gene DNA dataset for species of the genus Cercospora. In this regard, one of the achievements of this research was that the sequencing of additional loci revealed new clades within some taxa which were found to actually represented a species complex (in the eight-gene phylogenetic tree) rather than a single species, while the five-gene phylogenetic tree (Bakhshi et al. 2015a) was unable to resolve them. The phylogenetic tree based on the combined eight-gene dataset resolved at least four, three, two, two and two well-supported clades respectively within the species complexes C. cf. flagellaris, C. apii, C. beticola, C. armoraciae, and Cercospora sp. G.

Some of the species revealed by the eight-gene phylogeny in this study can be distinguished based on their morphology or host range. For example, as explained in the notes for C. uwebrauniana, characteristics of the conidia in this species, which clustered in the C. apii complex based on the five-gene phylogenetic tree (see Bakhshi et al. 2015a), are clearly distinguishable from those of C. apii. However, some species cannot be separated using morphological characters. For instance, the C. cf. flagellaris species complex included at least three distinct clades and there is considerable overlap between morphological features and host ranges of the clades 1, 2, and 3. In addition, pursuant to high levels of intraspecific variation in these three clades, the distinction between these clades is only possible based on molecular data. It is conceivable that some members of these three clades represent new species, yet to be described. This is also true for the Cercospora sp. G species complex.

Another problem arises because many morphological features change according to the host plant and different weather conditions. Such differences in morphological characters under different conditions have also been seen in other groups of fungi, such as Colletotrichum species (Weir et al. 2012). Because we do not yet have access to sequence data of most species of the Cercospora, we have chosen to consider these clades as different clades of C. cf. flagellaris and Cercospora sp. G rather than introduce new species names. Recent molecular studies on the Cercospora species associated with Cercospora leaf blight and purple seed stain on soybean, have revealed several Cercospora species, including C. cf. flagellaris as one of the most important agents (Bakhshi et al. 2015a, Soares et al. 2015, Albu et al. 2016). In this regard, Guillin et al. (2017) studied the genetic entanglement between Cercospora species infecting soybean and provided evidence that revealed interspecific gene flow played a significant role in the evolutionary dynamics of Cercospora species. Taking into consideration the shared host range that exists between different clades of C. cf. flagellaris, our data also provide more support for this hypothesis.

Furthermore, we found that all of the isolates of C. apii obtained from Plantago lanceolata from different localities clustered in clade 2 of this species in the eight-gene phylogenetic tree. Additionally, isolates of C. beticola and C. apii which intermix with P. lanceolata, had a common allele in gapdh. Thus, it seems that the gapdh gene might play a role in pathogenicity or host range, and has the potential to reflect this phylogenetically; however, that remains to be tested.

This study emphasises the complex nature of the evolutionary pathways that have been traversed within the genus Cercospora. Speciation has taken place much more prolifically than had previously been suspected in this genus, and it seems likely that the C. apii sensu Crous & Braun (2003) species complex is still rapidly evolving. The emergence of new species is doubtlessly encouraged by the opportunities for mixing gene pools that are provided by modern global agricultural practices, and indiscriminate use of fungicides combined with imperfect phytosanitary regulation.

The present study provides the first eight-gene phylogenetic overview of Cercospora species. We hope that this dataset will provide a stable platform to accommodate the numerous undescribed species that still await description, and the recollection and epitypification of already named species. Moreover, it seems that Cercospora should still be subjected to a more detailed analysis based on yet additional gene loci to provide a more vigorous phylogenetic basis for species delimitation.
