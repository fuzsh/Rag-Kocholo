INTRODUCTION

Fungi in the genus Cercospora (Mycosphaerellaceae, Capnodiales) are known as serious plant pathogens, causing major losses on a wide range of crop plants worldwide including sugar beet (Weiland & Koch 2004; Bakhshi et al. 2011; Vaghefi et al. 2018), beans (Chand et al. 2015; Duangsong et al. 2016), faba beans (Kimber & Paull 2011), corn (Crous et al. 2006), carrots (Kushalappa et al. 1989), sesame (Bakhshi & Zare 2020) and soybean (Soares et al. 2015; Bakhshi & Zare 2020) as well as many vegetable and ornamental species. Several taxa are also considered potential biocontrol agents of weeds (Tessmann et al. 2001; Praveena & Naseema 2004).

Correct identification of Cercospora species has a crucial role in order to understand the epidemiology of the diseases caused by these taxa and to develop effective control measures. Due to the lack of useful morphological characters and high levels of intraspecific variation, morphology does not provide sufficient and informative characters for an accurate identification of Cercospora species (Groenewald et al. 2013; Bakhshi et al. 2012b, 2015a, 2015b). Therefore, traditional identification systems in Cercospora relied heavily on host plant association (Crous & Braun 2003). Molecular studies of Cercospora spp. in recent years revealed that many taxa have broader host ranges (Groenewald et al. 2013; Bakhshi et al. 2015a, 2018), consequently reliance on host data in Cercospora taxonomy has proven problematic.

Phylogenetic analyses based on DNA sequences have led to momentous progress in the systematics of the genus. In this regard, phylogenetic performance of sequence data of eight genomic loci including ITS, actA, cmdA, gapdh, his3, rpb2, tef1 and tub2, were assessed for Cercospora species based on the inter-/intraspecific distance ratio and clade recovery (Groenewald et al. 2013; Bakhshi et al.2015a, 2018; Bakhshi 2019). According to these results, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire genus. However, Bakhshi et al. (2018) showed that, gapdh is a strong candidate for improved species delimitation in Cercospora and this gene provided better insight, especially into species complexes. The amplification of gapdh with available primers (Berbee et al. 1999; Myllys et al. 2002) was, however, not easy and indicated the need of new primer designation for gapdh in Cercospora.

Therefor our primary aim was to designate an additional primer set for amplification of gapdh in Cercospora. In addition, our secondary aim was to characterize Cercospora species gained from the infected leaves of several plant species collected from different provinces of Iran, based on morphology, cultural characteristics and phylogenetic analyses of the DNA sequence data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Samples and morphology

Plant samples with Cercospora leaf spot symptoms were collected from seven provinces of Iran including Ardabil, Golestan, Guilan, Hormozgan, Khuzestan, Mazandaran and North Khorasan during the growing seasons 2017–2019, taken to the laboratory, and examined under a Nikon SMZ 445 stereo-microscope to observe sporulation. Fungal strains were isolated in pure culture by direct transfer of spores from a single leaf spot onto plates containing 2% malt extract agar (MEA; Fluka, Hamburg, Germany) with a sterile fine pointed needle as explained in Bakhshi et al. (2011). Representative samples of diseased specimens were dried in a plant press and deposited in the Fungal Herbarium of the Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection (IRAN F). Representative isolates of the fungi were deposited in the Culture Collection of the Iranian Research Institute of Plant Protection (IRAN C), Tehran, Iran.

Morphological descriptions are based on structures from dried material. Diseased leaf tissues were examined under a Nikon SMZ 445 stereo-microscope and taxonomically informative morphological structures (stromata, conidiophores and conidia) were picked up from lesions with a sterile dissecting needle and mounted on glass slides in clear lactic acid. Structures were examined under an Olympus-BX51 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) light microscope, and photographed using a mounted Olympus DP 25 high definition color camera. Thirty measurements were made at ×1000 for each microscopic structure, and 95% confidence intervals were derived for the measurements with extreme values given in brackets.

DNA isolation, PCR amplification and sequencing

Mycelium from actively growing fungal cultures was scraped from the surface of MEA using a sterile scalpel blade and DNA was isolated using the protocol of Möller et al. (1992). The DNA samples were subsequently diluted 50–100 times in preparation for further DNA amplification reactions. The primers V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) were used to amplify part of the nuclear rRNA operon (ITS) spanning the 3’ end of 18S rRNA gene, the first internal transcribed spacer, the 5.8S rRNA gene, the second ITS region and the 5’ end of the 28S rRNA gene. Part of the actin gene (actA) was amplified using the primer set ACT-512F (Carbone & Kohn 1999) and ACT2Rd (Groenewald et al. 2013), whereas the primer set EF1-728F (Carbone & Kohn 1999) and EF-2 was used to amplify part of the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (tef1) gene. Primers employed for the amplification of calmodulin gene (cmdA) included CAL-228F and CAL-737R (Carbone & Kohn 1999) or CAL-2Rd (Groenewald et al. 2013), while the primer set CylH3F and CylH3R (Crous et al. 2004) was used to amplify part of the histone H3 gene (his3). The PCR amplifications were performed in a total volume of 25 µL on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). The protocols, and conditions for standard PCR amplification of the loci followed Bakhshi & Arzanlou (2017) and subsequent sequencing was performed in both directions using the PCR primers by Microsynth company (Balgach, Switzerland).

To amplify part of the gapdh, new primer set was designated here. For this purpose, the available sequences of gapdh for Cercospora spp. were retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank sequence database and were aligned with the MEGA v.7 (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) software (Kumar et al. 2016). The forward and reverse primers were designed in regions showing similarity between different sequences using the OligoCalc (Oligonucleotide Properties Calculator) online software (http://biotools.nubic.northwestern.edu/OligoCalc.html) (Kibbe 2007). Synthesis of primers was carried out by Microsynth company. The different PCR mixtures and conditions were tested using the new primers to set the best condition and PCR mixture for amplification of part of the gapdh. Finally, the resulting fragments were sequenced in both directions using the PCR primers.

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference

The raw trace files were inspected and edited with MEGA v.7 software (Kumar et al. 2016), and consensus sequences were manually generated from the forward and reverse sequences. The newly generated sequences were blasted against the NCBI’s GenBank sequence database using MegaBLAST to identify related taxa. The obtained sequences from GenBank together with the novel sequences generated during this study were initially aligned with the MAFFT v.7 online interface using default settings (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) (Katoh & Standley 2013) for each gene and, whenever necessary, manually improved in MEGA v.7.

For phylogenetic comparison, Bayesian inference (BI) analyses on individual gapdh gene and concatenated ITS, actA, cmdA, gapdh, his3 and tef1 loci were performed with MrBayes 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012). The best evolutionary model for each data partition was obtained using the software MrModelTest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004). The heating parameter was set at 0.15 and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis of four chains was started in parallel from a random tree topology and lasted until the average standard deviation of split frequencies came below 0.01. Trees were saved each 1 000 generations and the first 25% of saved trees were discarded as the ‘burn-in’ phase and posterior probabilities (PP) determined from the remaining trees. The resulting phylogenetic tree was printed with Geneious v. 5.6.7 (Drummond et al.2012). Sequences derived from this study were lodged at NCBI’s GenBank nucleotide database (http://www. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov; Table 1).

G & T in the world, and some species were recorded for the first time in some provinces of Iran. The species are treated as follows.
