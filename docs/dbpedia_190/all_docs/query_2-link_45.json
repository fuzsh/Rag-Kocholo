        "meta_description": "In this paper the taxonomy of some previously reported taxa as Cercospora apii s.lat. in Iran, is discussed and some new records are listed. Cercospora species on Abelia grandiflora (C. deutziae), Erythrina crista-galli (C. erythrinicola), Euphorbia heterophylla (C. pulcherrimae) and Zanthedeschia aethiopica (C. richardiicola) are new for mycobiota of Iran. Cercospora iridis which was previously reported from Iran probably belongs to the genus Passalora, but more specimens should be examined for final conclusion.",

Cercospora pulcherrimae on Euphorbia heterophylla. (A) Conidiophores, (B) Conidia, scale bar = 50 µm.\n\nCercospora peckiana Chupp, A monograph of the fungus genus Cercospora: 449 (1954)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Golestan Province, Gorgan (Jahan Abad village), on Rumex sanguineus, 13 May 2011. M. Pirnia (IRAN 15493 F); Golestan Province, Gorgan, on Rumex crispus, 10 May 2010. M. Pirnia (IRAN 15495 F); Golestan Province, Gorgan, Tuskestan Forest, 9 Nov. 2010. M. Pirnia & R. Zare (IRAN 15494 F).\n\nNote: The species is morphologically similar to Cercospora apii, but differs by moderately short conidiophores and conidia as well as obclavate-cylindrical conidia and was listed by Pirnia et al. (2012a) for the first time from Iran.\n\nCercospora althaeina Sacc., Michelia 1: 296. (1878)\n\nSpecimen examined: Iran, Golestan Province, Gorgan, on Gossypium hirsutum, Date unknown, Mirsalavatian (IRAN 4650 F).\n\nNote: Ramularia areola was previously reported from the same specimen in Iran (Ershad 2009). Careful examination of the specimen showed that some leaves were infected by Cercospora althaeina, which was previously reported on Althaea rosea Cav. in Iran.\n\nCercospora avicennae Chupp, A monograph of the fungus genus Cercospora: 369 (1954)\n\nSpecimen examined: Iran, Golestan Province, Shastkola forest, on Abutilon theophrasti, 8 Nov. 2010, M. Pirnia & R. Zare (IRAN 15016 F).\n\nNote: This specimen was previously reported as C. apii by Pirnia et al. (2010). Morphological characteristics of the specimen examined agree well with description of C. avicennae in Chupp (1954).\n\nCercospora beticolaSacc., Nuovo Giorn. Bot. Ital. 8: 189. (1876)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Golestan Province, Gorgan, on Beta vulgaris, 13 May 2011, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15487 F); Mazandaran Province, Gharakhil Station, 15 Nov. 1967, Rahmani (IRAN 432 F); Ardabil Province, Khoy, May 1967, Asadi (IRAN 434 F); Khuzestan Province, Dezful, Safi-Abad, date unknown, Eslami (IRAN 435 F); Farah-Abad, 7 Apr. 1949. (IRAN 436 F); Guilan Province, Lahijan, 15 Aug. 1950. (IRAN 437 F); West-Azarbaijan Province, Urmia, (Rezaieh), 16 Aug. 1996, Djawanmoghadam (IRAN 438 F); Mazandaran Province, Khorram-Abad, Shahsavar, 18 June 1955, Gh. Scharif (IRAN 439 F); Fars Province, Kazerun, 13 May 1969, Ahmadinejad (IRAN 440 F); North-Khorasan Province, Bojnurd, 16 Nov. 1969., Ahmadinejad (IRAN 441 F); Khuzestan Province, Ahvaz, date unknown, E. Esfandiari (IRAN 442 F); Golestan Province, Gorgan, 20 Apr. 1947, Mirsalavatian (IRAN 443 F); Guilan Province, Rasht, 3 Aug. 1947, E. Esfandiari (IRAN 444 F); Khuzestan Province, Ahvaz, on Beta maritime L., 9 Feb. 1971, Ebrahimi (IRAN 433 F).\n\nNote: According to Chupp (1954), C. beticola is characterized by moderately short conidiophores. Crous & Braun (2003) synonymized C. beticola under C. apii s. lat., but Groenewald et al. (2006) showed that both C. apii and C. beticola had wider host ranges and represented distinct species. Iranian specimens are classified under C. beticola, but it is probable that some specimens in Iran are infected by C. apii s. lat.\n\nCercospora brunkii Ellis & Galoway, J. Mycol. 6: 33. (1890)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Guilan Province, Sume'e Sara, on Pelargonium zonale,25 June 2010, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15020 F); Mazandaran Province, Mahmoudabad, 16 Aug. 2012, B. Bicharanlou (IRAN 16201 F).\n\nNote: Specimens from Guilan and Mazandaran provinces were previously reported as C. apii by Pirnia et al. (2010) and Bicharanlou et al. (2013b).C. brunkii is a common name on Pelargonium and Geranium (Geraniaceae). The species is characterized by having moderately shorter conidiophores and short acicular to obclavate conidia.\n\nCercospora canescens Fresen., Beitr. Mycol. 3: 91 (1863)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Guilan Province, Rasht, on Vigna sinensis, 25 July 2010, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15486 F); Guilan Province, Astaneh-Ashrafieh, 24 June 2010, M. Pirnia (IRAN 14808 F); Guilan Province, Sume'e Sara, 25 June 2010, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15021 F); Mazandaran Province, Babol, 12 Sept. 2010, M.A. Aghajani (IRAN 15022 F), Guilan Province, Rasht, 28 Aug. 1974, Gh. Scharif (IRAN 454 F).\n\nNote: Specimens on above mentioned host from Guilan Province were previously reported as C. apii by Pirnia et al. (2010). There are three Cercospora species on Vigna spp., which are morphologically distinguishable from each other, including C. canescens (Pale brown conidiophores and long acicular conidia), C. kikuchii T. Matsumoto & Tomoy. (Darker colored conidiophores in dense fascicles and shorter conidia) and C. longispora Peck. (Pale olivaceous brown conidiophores and colored conidia).\n\nCercospora gerberae Chupp & Viegas, Bol. Soc. Brasil. Agron. 8: 27. (1945)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Mazandaran Province, Mahmoudabad, on Gerbera jamesonii,29 Sept. 2012, B. Bicharanlou (IRAN 16198 F); Mazandaran Province, close to Motel Ghou, 3 Oct. 1965. (IRAN 468 F).\n\nNote: The specimen from Mahmoudabad was previously reported as C. apii by Bicharanlou et al. (2013b), but moderately shorter conidiophores and conidia separate C. gerberae from C. apii s. lat. Morphology of the specimen examined fit well with description of C. gerberae in Chupp (1954).\n\nCercospora hydrangeae Ellis & Everh., J. Elisha Mitchell Sci. Soc. 8: 52. (1892)\n\nSpecimen examined: Iran, Mazandaran Province, Nowshahr, on Hydrangea macrophylla,14 July 2012. B. Bicharanlou (IRAN 16200 F).\n\nNote: This specimen was previously reported as C. apii by Bicharanlou et al. (2013b). Morphology of the specimen examined is identical with description of C. hydrangeae in Chupp (1954). Two species of Cercospora, including C. hydrangea and C. yakushimensis Togashi & Katsuki are reported on Hydrangea. The latter species is distinguishable by having shorter conidiophores and conidia.\n\nCercospora iridis Chupp, A monograph of the fungus genus Cercospora: 260 (1954)\n\nSpecimen examined: Iran,Guilan Province, Bandar Anzali, on Iris sp., 25 June 2010, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15025 F)\n\nNote: Studying a specimen on Iris sp., Pirnia et al. 2010 introduced Cercospora iridis with short cylindro-obclavate conidia and small conidiophores. Careful microscopic examination showed that fungal structures and conidiogenous loci were very close to the genus Passalora. Unfortunately, the amount of the specimen was not sufficient for the exact identification, and more specimens need to be investigated.\n\nCercospora lactucae-sativaeSawada, Rep. Gov. Agric. Res. Inst. Taiwan 35: 111 (1928)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Mazandaran Province, Sari, on Lactuca serriola,12 May 2011, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15491 F); Northern-Khorasan Province, Shirvan, 3 July 2011, B. Bicharanlou (IRAN 15492 F).\n\nNote: Cercospora lactucae-sativae was previously reported on Lactuca sativa L. (Pirnia et al. 2010). Old collections from Iran are published as Cercospora longissima Cugini ex Sacc., but Crous & Braun (2003) replaced C. longissima by C. lactucae-sativae as its synonym.\n\nCercospora medicaginis Ellis & Everh., Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Philadelphia 43: 91. (1891)\n\nSpecimen examined: Iran, Ahoudasht, on Medicago sp. 10 Mar. 1948, E Esfandiari (IRAN 469 F).\n\nNote: Conidiophores were pale olivaceous brown, paler and narrower towards the tip. Average range of conidiophores and conidial size was more than C. zebrina on Medicago in this research.\n\nCercospora physalidis Ellis Amer. Naturalist 16: 810 (1882)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Guilan Province, Astaneh-Ashrafieh, on Lycopersicon esculentum,24 June 2010, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15019 F); Guilan Province, on Petunia hybrida, 23 Aug. 1973, Akhavizadegan (IRAN 475 F).\n\nNote: Specimen on Lycopersicon esculentum was previously reported as C. apii by Pirnia et al. (2010). C. physalidis is a common species on various genera of Solanaceae (Crous & Braun 2003). Morphological characteristics of the two examined specimens agree with description of C. physalidis represented by Chupp (1954).\n\nCercospora sonchi Chupp, A monograph of the fungus genus Cercospora: 159 (1954)\n\nSpecimen examined: Iran, Mazandaran Province, Sari, on Sonchus arvensis, 19 Nov. 2012, B. Bicharanlou (IRAN 16202 F).\n\nNote: This specimen was previously reported as C. apii by Bicharanlou et al. (2013b). C. sonchi was previously reported by Hesami et al. (2012) on Taraxacum officinalis in Iran, but this is the first report of the species on Sonchus arvensis.\n\nCercospora zebrina Pass., Hedwigia 16: 124. (1877)\n\nSpecimen examined: Iran, Lorestan Province, Khorram-Abad, on Medicago sp., 14 April 2010, Naemifar (IRAN 15496 F).\n\nNote: C. zebrina is a common species on Trifolium spp., but has been also found on Medicago spp. The species is characterized by having short pale to medium dark olivaceous brown conidiophores which are uniform in color and moderately short acicular conidia.\n\nCercospora zonata G. Winter, Hedwigia 23: 191 (1884)\n\nSpecimens examined: Iran, Golestan Province, Gorgan, on Vicia faba L., 13 May 2011, M. Pirnia (IRAN 15497 F); Khuzestan Province, Ahvaz, Hamidieh, 24 Mar. 1948, E. Esfandiari (IRAN 466 F); Mazandaran Province, Babol, Hamzeh-Cola, 12 Feb. 1983, Torabi (IRAN 467 F)."
