        "text": "Fungi have been often neglected, despite the fact that they provided penicillin, lovastatin and many other important medicines. They are an understudied, but essential, fascinating and biotechnologically useful group of organisms. The study of fungi in northern Thailand has been carried out by us since 2005. These studies have been diverse, ranging from ecological aspects, phylogenetics with the incorportation of molecular dating, taxonomy (including morphology and chemotaxonomy) among a myriad of microfungi, to growing novel mushrooms, and DNA-based identification of plant pathogens. In this paper, advances in understanding the biodiversity of fungi in the region are discussed and compared with those further afield. Many new species have been inventoried for the region, but many unknown species remain to be described and/or catalogued. For example, in the edible genus Agaricus, over 35 new species have been introduced from northern Thailand, and numerous other taxa await description. In this relatively well known genus, 93% of species novelty is apparent. In the microfungi, which are relatively poorly studied, the percentage of novel species is, surprisingly, generally not as high (55-96%). As well as Thai fungi, fungi on several hosts from Europe have been also investigated. Even with the well studied European microfungi an astounding percentage of new taxa (32-76%) have been discovered. The work is just a beginning and it will be a daunting task to document this astonishingly high apparent novelty among fungi.\n\nFerns are one of the most significant plant groupings that comprise a substantial proportion of the plant flora due to the fact of their great diversity, especially in tropical areas. The biodiversity of fungi associated with ferns and fern-like hosts has also received little attention in studies. Plant samples were collected from diseased and dead plants of ten fern or fern-like species from Chiang Rai in northern Thailand. Forty-one isolates were selected from the obtained isolates for molecular and morphological analysis, with a focus on pathogenic fungal genera and consideration of the diversity in host and geographical location. Twenty-six species belonging to seven genera (Colletotrichum, Curvularia, Diaporthe, Fusarium, Lasiodiplodia, Neopestalotiopsis, and Pestalotiopsis) in six families were identified. Thirty new hosts, eight new geographical hosts, and one new species, Colletotrichum polypodialium, are described. Nepestalotiopsis phangngaensis, N. pandancola, Diaporthe te...\n\nEntomopathogenic fungi are ubiquitous in tropical rainforests and feature a high level of diversity. This group of fungi not only has important ecological value but also medicinal value. Nevertheless, they are often ignored, and many unknown species have yet to be discovered and described. The present study aims to contribute to the taxonomical and phylogenetic understanding of the genus Paraisaria by describing three new species collected from Guizhou and Yunnan Provinces in China and Krabi Province in Thailand. The three novel species named Paraisaria alba, P. arcta, and P. rosea share similar morphologies as those in the genus Paraisaria, containing solitary, simple, fleshy stroma, completely immersed perithecia and cylindrical asci with thickened caps and filiform ascospores that often disarticulate at maturity. Phylogenetic analyses of combined LSU, SSU, TEF1-α, RPB1, RPB2, and ITS sequence data confirm their placement in the genus Paraisaria. In this study, the three entomopat...\n\nKD 2013 – Monograph of Cercosporoid fungi from Thailand. Plant Pathology & Quarantine 3(2), 67–138, doi 10.5943/ppq/3/2/2 The diversity of cercosporoid fungi in northern Thailand is very high. Eighty-five cercosporoid species were found in northern Thailand including (i) 84 species of true cercosporoid fungi: Cercospora (34), Passalora (7), Pseudocercospora (42), Zasmidium (1); (ii) One morphological similar fungus. Three new species were established, namely Pseudocercospora christellae, P. cratevae and P. radermachericola, while 23 cercosporoid species represent new records for Thailand. In this study, 50 species are described in full descriptions and illustrations, and another 35 species are only listed additionally because they have been described in ―Monograph of Cercosporid from Laos‖ or have previously been recorded from Thailand. The data show that the diversity of cercosporoid fungi in northern Thailand is very high; Meeboon (2009) recorded 166 cercosporoid species from this...\n\nKingdom Fungi, which has been estimated at around 1.5 million species, with about 5% of these having been formally classified. Species identification based on conventional phenotypic methods is often timeconsuming and laborious and is hindered by the unstable and subjective nature of phenotypic characteristics, which are readily influenced by culture conditions. Such phenotypic approaches has a clear limitation on fungi that do not grow in culture. Molecular systematics involving the use of genes to gain taxonomic status of organisms and their evolutionary relationships have influenced inducting significant changes in the traditional concepts of systematics. Techniques such as RFLP, RAPD, rDNA analysis, SSR and ISSR are are now gaining importance in fungal systematics and related studies. These techniques are much faster, more specific and more accurate. These developments have provided new information that has caused the biological-species concept to come under criticism in favor o..."
