        "meta_description": "The present paper continues a series of comprehensive taxonomic treatments of cercosporoid fungi (formerly Cercospora s. lat.), belonging to the Mycosphaerellaceae (Ascomycota). The fourth contribution of this series initiates treatments of cercosporoid fungi on dicots and comprises species occurring on hosts belonging the the families Acanthaceae, Actinidiaceae, Adoxaceae, Aizoaceae, Altingiaceae, and Amaranthaceae. The species are described and illustrated in alphabetical order under the particular cercosporoid genera, supplemented by keys to the species concerned. A detailed introduction, a survey of currently recognised cercosporoid genera, a key to the genera concerned, and a discussion of taxonomically relevant characters were published in the first part of this series. The following taxonomic novelties are introduced: Cercospora blepharidicola nom. nov., C. celosiigena sp. nov., C. justiciae-adhatodae sp. nov., C. justiciigena nom. nov., C. sambucicola nom. nov., C. thunbergiigena nom. nov., Cercosporella pseudachyranthis comb. nov., Pseudocercospora cyathulae comb. nov., P. depazeoides comb. nov., P. varia var. viburni-sargentii var. nov., P. viburnicola sp. nov., P. viburni-erosi sp. nov., and P. viburni-nudi sp. nov.",

Exs. 2273. D. Sacc., Mycoth. Ital. 191, 1580.\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular, subcircular to angular-irregular, 1–12 mm diam, sometimes confluent and larger, sometimes zonate, at first pale greenish, later yellowish to ochraceous, brown, finally greyish brown to greyish white, usually with a narrow darker border, occasionally somewhat raised. Caespituli amphigenous, punctiform, dark brown, later greyish white by abundant conidiation, scattered. Mycelium internal. Stromata well-developed, 10–70 µm diam, substomatal to immersed, large stromata often rupturing the stomata, somewhat erumpent, pale, subhyaline to yellowish brown, later dark brown, composed of swollen hyphal cells, 2.5–10 µm diam, circular to somewhat irregular in shape. Conidiophores in small to large fascicles, dense, arising from stromata, through stomata or erumpent, erect, straight to curved or somewhat geniculate-sinuous, unbranched, 10–40(− 60) × 3–7 µm, 0–2-septate, subhyaline, yellowish to pale olivaceous, paler towards the tip, somewhat darker in mass, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or conidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells, 10–30 µm long, mostly with a single or two, occasionally several conspicuous conidiogenous loci, 1.5–2.5 µm diam. Conidia solitary, acicular, smaller conidia narrowly obclavate-cylindrical, straight to curved, 20–130 × 2–5 µm, rarely longer, shorter conidia 1–5-septate, longer ones indistinctly pluriseptate, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, apex pointed, base truncate to short obconically truncate, (1.5−)2–2.5(− 3) µm wide, hila thickened and darkened.\n\nLectotype (designated here, MycoBank, MBT202779): Italy: Parma, Botanical Garden, on Acanthus spinosus, Jul. 1875, G. Passerini [Rabenh., Fungi Eur. Exs. 2273] (HAL).

Exs. 2273), with a brief description on the label. The secondary description in “Hedwigia 16: 123 (1877)”, usually cited as the original description, is younger; this is a consequence of Saccardo not accepting publication in exsiccate labels as acceptable. This species is a true Cercospora readily distinguishable from the C. apii s. lat. complex by its short, aseptate or sparingly septate, pale conidiophores and acicular to obclavate conidia. Records of this species on Peristrophe bicalyculata from Myanmar (Thaung 1984) are very doubtful and excluded.\n\nCercospora adhatodae S. Chowdhury, Lloydia 18: 84 “1955” (1956).

Caespituli amphigenous, fine, dark. Mycelium internal. Stromata lacking or small, substomatal, brown. Conidiophores in small, divergent fascicles, arising from internal hyphae or stromatic hyphal aggregations, through stomata or erumpent, erect, straight, subcylindrical to geniculate in the upper half, 40–190 × 4–6 µm, 0–7-septate, brown to dark brown, paler towards the tip, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, about 2–3 µm wide, thickened and darkened. Conidia solitary, acicular, straight to curved, 35–250 × 2.5–5.5 µm, 2–22-septate, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, apex pointed, base truncate, about 2–3 µm wide, hila thickened and darkened.\n\nHolotype: India: Asom (Assam): Kokilamukh, on Justicia adhatoda, 12 Feb. 1951, S. Chowdhury (HCIO).\n\nHost range and distribution: On Justicia adhatoda [Adhatoda vasica], Acanthaceae, Asia (India, Asom, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal).\n\nNotes: This is a species of the Cercospora apii s. lat. complex. Several Indian collections from Karnataka, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh have been examined (K(M) IMI 135861, 293593 and 330436).\n\nCercospora andrographidicola S.Q. Chen & P.K. Chi, J. S.

Conidiophores in loose fascicles, 4–15, arising from stromata, erect, straight, subcylindrical, non-geniculate, unbranched, 150–233 × 3.3–6.7 µm, 2–10-septate, olivaceous; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, usually with a single terminal conidiogenous locus, thickened and darkened. Conidia solitary, acicular, straight to somewhat curved, 200–240 × 3.3–5 µm, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, apex pointed, base truncate, hila thickened and darkened.\n\nHolotype: China: Guangdong: Gaoyao, on Andrographis paniculata, Oct. 1986, S. G. Chen 123 (Hb. S. China Agric. Univ., Guangzhou).\n\nHost range and distribution: On Andrographis paniculata, Acanthaceae, Asia (China).\n\nNotes: Belonging to the Cercospora apii s. lat. complex, but type material was not available for a re-examination. To-anun et al. (2011) described and illustrated “C. andrographidicola” on Andrographis paniculata from Thailand. This material is, however, morphologically dinstinct by lacking or small stromata, up to 30 µm diam, shorter, geniculate conidiophores, and much shorter, acicular to obclavate conidia, and rather belongs to C. andrographidis.\n\nCercospora andrographidis Thirum. & Govindu, Sydowia 7: 310 (1953).

Caespituli amphigenous, mainly epiphyllous, not very conspicuous. Mycelium internal. Stromata lacking or inconspicuous and small, only a few swollen hyphal cells, 5–20 µm diam, usually intraepidermal, if present to 30 µm diam, brown, cells 3–8 µm diam, wall slightly thickened. Conidiophores solitary or in small divergent fascicles, arising from internal hyphae or aggregations of swollen hyphal cells, erumpent, erect, straight to geniculate, unbranched, 15–165 × 3–6.5 µm, 1–9-septate, light to medium dark brown, wall thin to slightly thickened, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, occasionally intercalary, 15–30 µm long, sympodial, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, thickened and darkened, 2–3 µm diam.

Thirumalachar (not traced).\n\nHost range and distribution: On Andrographis (paniculata, Andrographis sp.), Acanthaceae, Asia (India, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal; Thailand).\n\nNote: The conidia of this species were described to be “acicular” with obconically truncate base, i.e. they are, at least partly, obclavate as depicted in Thirumalachar & Govindu (1953: plate VI, fig. 6). This could be confirmed on the base of an examined collection from India (West Bengal, Midnapur, Daspur, 20 Mar. 1967, M. Mandal, BPI 432654). To-anun et al. (2011) described and illustrated “C. andrographidicola” on Andrographis paniculata from Thailand. This material, characterised by lacking or small stromata and acicular to obclavate conidia, is quite distinct from true C. andrographidicola and rather belongs to C. andrographidis. An additional sample from India (Daspur, BPI 432654) has been examined.\n\nCercospora asystasiana J.M. Yen, Rev. Mycol. 32: 180 (1967).

Caespituli hypophyllous, rather inconspicuous. Mycelium internal. Stromata lacking or almost so. Conidiophores solitary or in small divergent fascicles, 2–5, arising from internal hyphae or small substomatal hyphal aggregations, through stomata, erect, straight to somewhat curved, subcylindrical to distinctly geniculate-sinuous, unbranched, 30–120(− 135) × 3–6 µm, 0–5-septate, brown to dark brown, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or intercalary, about 15–30 µm long, conidiogenous loci thickened and darkened, about 2–2.5 µm diam. Conidia solitary, acicular to somewhat obclavate, straight to curved or somewhat sigmoid, 45–185 × 2.5–5 µm, 4–20-septate, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, apex subacute, base truncate or slightly obconically truncate, 2–3 µm wide, hila thickened and darkened.\n\nHolotype: Singapore: Botanical Garden, on Asystasia chelonoides, 5 Jan. 1966, J. M. Yen 769 (PC).\n\nHost range and distribution: On Asystasia (chelonoides, nemorum), Acanthaceae, known from the type collection [records of Cercospora justiciicola on Asystasia gangetica and C. cf. malloti on A. salicifolia might belong to this species — see notes].\n\nNotes: This species is part of the Cercospora apii s. lat. complex. Records of Cercospora justiciicola on Asystasia gangetica [coromandeliana] (see Cous & Braun 2003: 234) are unclear but might belong to C. asystasiana.\n\nNguanhom et al. (2015) examined Cercospora species from northern Thailand using molecular methods. Sequences derived from several collections on various unrelated host species, including Asystasia salicifiolia, clustered in a clade tentatively denominated as C. cf. malloti in Groenewald et al. (2013: 157). Taxa belonging to this clade represented the most common Cercospora encounted in this study. Cercospora cf. malloti is morphologically part of the C. apii complex. The true C. malloti was based on North American Cercospora material infecting Mallotus japonicus. The tentative allocation of this clade comprising plurivorous C. apii-like races to C. malloti is neither settled nor finally proven since cultures and sequences based on North American collections retrieved from Mallotus are not yet available. Due to the wide but hitherto little known host range of this taxon, it is not yet possible to exclude that several other host species and older species names of Cercospora might be involved. Therefore, it is currently impossible to resolve the clade concerned.\n\nCercospora balaghatensis S.M. Singh, Indian Phytopathol. 29: 17 “1976” (1977).

Type material (collected in Sep. 1884) is not preserved at NY. There are numerous topotypes from 1886, e.g. B; BPI 435404, 435692, 435700, 435701; NY 270701. However, the type material collected in Sep. 1884 was traced in CUP and FH. The CUP material is designated as lectotype. Records of C. diantherae on Jacobinia spp. are doubtful.

The conidia are colourless or almost so, the conidiogenous loci are conspicuous, but minute, ca. 1 µm wide, and somewhat paracercospora-like.

MycoBank MB814556 (Fig. 12a,b)\n\nDiagnosis: Differs from Cercospora adhatodae and all other Cercospora species on hosts of the Acanthaceae in forming small catenate conidia, (8−)12–35(− 40) × 2–3 µm, (0−)1–3(− 4)-septate.\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, circular, subcircular to slightly angular-irregular, 0.5–4 mm diam, at first brown, but soon turning greyish white to white, margin narrow, somewhat raised, dark, brown, dark violet to almost blackish. Caespituli amphigenous, punctiform, scattered to dense, brown to dark brown. Mycelium internal. Stromata lacking or almost so to well-developed, 10–30 µm diam, substomatal to intraepidermal, brown, cells 2–5 µm diam, wall at first thin, later slightly thickened. Conidiophores in small, loose to moderately large and dense fascicles, arising from substomatal or intraepidermal hyphae or stromata, emerging through stomata or erumpent, erect, straight to curved, subcylindrical or somewhat attenuated towards the tip to moderately geniculate-sinuous, unbranched, 10–50 × 2–5 µm, 0–3-septate, pale olivaceous to olivaceous-brown, paler towards the tip, thin-walled, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or conidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells, 10–25 µm long, proliferation sympodial, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, 1–2 µm wide, somewhat thickened and darkened. Conidia solitary and catenate, in simple or occasionally branched chains, narrowly cylindrical-fusiform, short obclavate, (8−)12–35(− 40) × 2–3 µm, (0−)1–3(− 4)-septate, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, apex subacute, subobtuse or short conically truncate, base subtruncate to short obconically truncate, 1–1.5 − m wide, hila slightly thickened and darkened.\n\nHolotype: India: Karnataka: Chikkaballapur District, Nandi Hills, on Justicia adhatoda [Adhatoda vasica], Acanthaceae, 10 Jan. 1969, V. S. Seshadri & K. A. Lucy Channnamma (BPI 1103659).\n\nHost range and distribution: Only known from the type collection.\n\nNotes: Type material of this species was originally deposited as Cercospora adhatodae, but it is quite distinct from the latter species, which belongs to the C. apii complex, by much shorter, narrower, usually 1–3-septate conidia formed in chains. These characteristics distinguish the new species from all other Cercospora species described on hosts belonging to the Acanthaceae. Previously one were inclined to put this species in Passalora s. lat. (including Phaeoramularia), but catenate, colourless conidia are rather in favour of Cercospora s. str., which has recently been shown in the course of phylogenetic studies of cercosporoid hyphomycetes (see Braun et al. 2013). Therefore, the present new species is, at least for the interim, placed in Cercospora although cultures and molecular data are not yet available.\n\nCercospora justiciigena U. Braun, nom. nov.

Owing to the description and illustration of conspicuous, dark conidiogenous loci and hila as well as colourless conidia formed singly, C. acanthacearum var. macrospora is undoubtedly a true Cercospora (s. str.) species. The generic affinity of C. acanthacearum is unclear, but this species might rather be a member of Pseudocercospora.\n\nCercospora justiciicola F.L. Tai, Lloydia 11: 47 (1948); as “justiciaecola”.

Isotype: K(M) IMI 299176.\n\nHost range and distribution: On Rungia (pectinata [parviflora], repens), Acanthaceae, Asia (India, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand; Nepal).\n\nNote: The identity of Cercospora rungiae and Pseudocercospora rungiae has been proven by Kamal (2010). A record of C. rungiae from Andhra Pradesh (Braun et al. 1992: 363) refers to a true Cercospora (see C. justiciicola) and not to this species. Verma & Kamal (1991) cited a collection on “Ruellia prostrata” (on the original label as Justicia sp.) as paratype material (Nepal: Kathmandu Valley, Jan. 1986, R. K. Verma (GPU, KK 221, K(M) IMI 303480). This collection, characterised by forming superficial hyphae with solitary conidiophores is excluded from P. rungiae. The identification of the host is uncertain, and the identity of this fungus is not quite clear, but it probably belongs to Pseudocercospora justiciicola.\n\nPseudocercospora thunbergiae (Boedijn) U.
