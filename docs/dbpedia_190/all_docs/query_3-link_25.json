        "text": "Introduction\n\nMore than 3000 species have been named in the genus Cercospora (Pollack, 1987), which is currently regarded as one of the largest genera of hyphomycetes. Following the recent revision by Crous & Braun (2003), this number was significantly reduced to 659 species, with a further 281 species that are treated as morphologically indistinguishable from C. apii sensu lato. Cercospora beticola belongs to the C. apii complex (Crous & Braun, 2003) and is the main causal agent of cercospora leaf spot of sugar beet (Saccardo, 1876; Groenewald et al., 2005, 2006a). Some confusion existed in the past about whether C. beticola and C. apii, the main leaf spot causing agent of Apium species, are synonymous. Groenewald et al. (2005) conducted a detailed study of the cultural characteristics, cardinal temperature requirements for growth and molecular analyses to demonstrate that these two Cercospora species are indeed distinct.\n\nCercospora beticola is considered to be one of the most destructive foliar pathogens of sugar beet, causing yield losses of up to 40% (Shane & Teng, 1992; Holtschulte, 2000). For most Cercospora species, including C. beticola, no sexual stage is known from nature and in vitro pairing studies have not been successful in producing a teleomorph for C. beticola (unpublished data). The genus Cercospora is a well-established anamorph of Mycosphaerella (Crous & Braun, 2003), and phylogenetic analyses on a variety of Cercospora species have placed them as a well-defined clade within Mycosphaerella (Crous et al., 2001, 2006a, 2006b; Goodwin et al., 2001). Therefore, if a sexual stage does exist for C. beticola, it would be a species of Mycosphaerella.\n\nA wide array of phenotypic diversity has been described for C. beticola that includes variation in spore morphology and production, cultural characteristics, pathogenicity and fungicide resistance (Rossi, 1995; Moretti et al., 2004). In fungi, gene diversity is not necessarily affected by the mating structure (McDonald, 1997), but sexually reproducing fungi usually have high levels of genotypic diversity and alleles among loci should be randomly associated (Milgroom, 1996). Even though phenotypic markers indicate high levels of variation, little is known about the genetic structure of C. beticola populations.\n\nRecently a few studies attempted to determine the population genetic structure of C. beticola and a substantial amount of genetic variation was found within Cercospora strains isolated from sugar beet fields in Italy (Moretti et al., 2006), and genetic variation was also observed in C. beticola isolates from lesions of the same plant (Moretti et al., 2004). This is in contrast to the data available for other Cercospora species which have low levels of genetic diversity, e.g. C. sorghii (Okori et al., 2004). This species also shows low genetic differentiation between populations from Uganda, suggesting a close genetic relatedness among populations (Okori et al., 2004). Similarly, genetic variation among isolates of C. zeae-maydis from Africa (Okori et al., 2003) and the United States (Wang et al., 1998; Crous et al., 2006a) was also found to be low, with little genetic differentiation either within or between populations.\n\nMating type genes are often under frequency-dependent selection in randomly mating populations (Milgroom, 1996; May et al., 1999). Mating type genes (MAT1-1-1 and MAT1-2) of C. beticola were isolated and characterized to show that the fungus has a bipolar mating system (Groenewald et al., 2006b). However, the putative intron splicing sites, gene predictions and functionality of these genes in C. beticola have not yet been confirmed and additional studies are necessary to show whether these genes are functional. Ascomycetes that are heterothallic have a single locus, two allele mating system which requires two nuclei of opposite mating types to fuse in order for sexual reproduction to occur (Kronstad & Staben, 1997). Cercospora mating type-specific primers were developed for use in a multiplex PCR to determine the frequencies of these idiomorphs in field populations (Groenewald et al., 2006b). They found that mating types occurred in similar frequencies in C. beticola field populations, a phenomenon that is commonly accepted as indicative of random mating, such as in Mycosphaerella graminicola (Waalwijk et al., 2002; Zhan et al., 2002). Groenewald et al. (2006b) therefore suggested that some Cercospora species cannot be strictly asexual and that another method of reproduction has to occur to account for the frequency-dependent selection of the mating type genes observed within field populations.\n\nAlthough previous studies showed that high levels of genotypic variation could be found in populations of C. beticola (Moretti et al., 2004, 2006), these studies were all based on small sample sizes (N ≤ 13 per population). Knowledge of the distribution of the mating types, together with the amount of genotypic variation observed within a specific fungal population, can provide a strong indication whether or not sexual reproduction is likely to occur. The main objectives of this study were therefore to (i) determine the genetic structure of C. beticola populations with AFLPs, including genotypic diversity and gametic disequilibrium, and (ii) to determine whether there is frequency-dependent selection on mating types. This knowledge will provide indirect evidence for the possible presence of a sexual cycle occurring in this fungus. In order to achieve these objectives populations from Western Europe, Iran and New Zealand were analysed.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis study is the first to report on the genetic structure and mating type distribution of C. beticola populations from different geographic localities. The results obtained from population differentiation, gene flow and genetic distance analyses suggest that the populations from Europe and Iran are genetically similar, whereas the New Zealand population is significantly different. High levels of genetic variation were found among the C. beticola isolates tested. This variation, illustrated by the high number of distinct haplotypes obtained with the AFLP analyses, compares well with earlier studies that also reported high levels of genetic variation among isolates obtained from the same lesion on a sugar beet plant in Italy (Moretti et al., 2004), and between isolates from Italy (Moretti et al., 2006). Most of the isolates that were obtained from one plant during the present study also had a distinct multilocus AFLP haplotype (data not shown). The sampling allowed partitioning of genetic variation and showed that most variation could be found within populations (75%), whereas only 4% of the variation was due to differences among populations within a region (European populations) and 21% to differences among geographic regions.\n\nTo date no teleomorph has been found for C. beticola (Groenewald et al., 2006b) and the reproductive structure of this pathogen has been considered clonal. However, this study found high levels of genotypic diversity in all six populations analysed. It is known that populations that regularly undergo sexual reproduction should have many genotypes that result in higher levels of genotypic diversity compared to those that reproduce only asexually (Milgroom, 1996). This type of genetic structure is seen in most populations of M. graminicola (Linde et al., 2002; Zhan et al., 2003; Zhan & McDonald, 2004). Thus, the genotypic diversity observed for C. beticola is exceptionally high for a presumed asexually reproducing organism.\n\nMilgroom (1996) and Zhan et al. (2002) found that a combination of high levels of genetic diversity and the equal distribution of mating types in a given population indicates that sexual recombination occurs. This study therefore screened for the presence and frequency of the mating type idiomorphs in the populations. The equal distribution of mating types in most populations (except Italy) suggests frequency-dependent selection and thus random mating. Both mating types could also be found on the same plant (data not shown), providing opportunity for genetic exchange. Thus, the high levels of genotypic diversity together with equal mating type ratios indicate that this fungus reproduces sexually. If C. beticola was strictly asexual, one would expect that, over time, there would be a skewed distribution of the mating types, or that only one mating type would be present, as was found for other Cercospora species such as C. apii and C. apiicola (Groenewald et al., 2006b). Cercospora beticola has been observed to form spermatogonia on leaf tissues collected during this study, which is also indicative of a possible sexual cycle, although any sexual stage that may exist is, so far, not readily observed in nature nor induced under laboratory conditions.\n\nTests for multilocus associations (IA and r̄d) showed that all six populations were in gametic disequilibrium. This suggests that asexual production is predominant and that random mating occurs only rarely, if at all. However, although significant, the values of IA and r̄d were low for populations from Italy, France and the Netherlands. Furthermore, r̄d was similar or even lower in C. beticola (0·004–0·037) than that estimated for Pyrenophora teres f.sp. teres (0·037–0·039), which is known to undergo regular sexual recombination (Rau et al., 2003). Furthermore, only one primer combination was in significant gametic disequilibrium in the population from Italy and the Netherlands. This contradicts results on frequency-dependent selection and levels of genotypic diversity which suggest populations undergo regular sexual recombination. There are two possible explanations for gametic disequilibrium in these populations. First, frequent population expansions during epidemics can result in populations dominated by closely related individuals (Maynard-Smith et al., 2000). During epidemics, even though populations are recombining, genotypes may arise that are strongly favoured by selection. These genotypes will increase in frequency, generating disequilibrium until recombination has had time to randomize the genetic background (Maynard-Smith et al., 2000), presumably at the end of the growing season when sexual reproduction is known to occur as a survival mechanism for many plant pathogens. Unless mating type idiomorphs are linked to pathogenicity factors or fungicide resistance, their frequency should by chance follow a 1:1 ratio during the epidemic. However, the AFLP loci used in this study were selectively neutral.\n\nA second explanation for the observed gametic disequilibrium lies with the type of marker used. AFLPs often represent hypervariable regions that include dispersed repetitive elements (reviewed in Wong et al., 2001), resulting in a co-dominant marker. Thus, conventional population genetic approaches to analyse AFLP data will underestimate the variability at each locus and overestimate the number of loci analysed, since each allele will be taken as an independent locus (Wong et al., 2001). In a comparison between RFLP and hypervariable AFLP markers, Yan et al. (1999) showed that heterozygosity was underestimated in the yellow fever mosquito by AFLP markers, resulting in Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium. The present results suggest that at least one AFLP primer pair (A/CT) amplified hypervariable regions since it was the only primer combination that showed significant gametic disequilibrium in all C. beticola populations analysed. Furthermore, in populations from Italy and the Netherlands, this was the only primer combination that resulted in loci (20 out of 78) in gametic disequilibrium. It is therefore suggested that at least the C. beticola populations from Italy and the Netherlands are in gametic equilibrium.\n\nThe high level of genotypic variation in C. beticola can also be explained by other factors. First, it is possible that C. beticola reproduced sexually prior to modern agricultural practices (e.g. burying of plant material during soil cultivation) which prevents sexual reproduction at the end of the growing season. Secondly, Weiland & Koch (2004) showed that the genome of C. beticola can undergo chromosome changes after repetitive subculturing. These changes were observed after chromosome separation by gel electrophoreses. Although the authors studied only two isolates and did not mention the number of times the sub-culturing was repeated before these rearrangements were observed, the possibility that such rearrangements can influence results obtained using marker systems, such as AFLPs, has to be taken into account. In order to limit these chromosomal rearrangements in isolates, sub-culturing during this study was kept to a minimum and the DNA was extracted from the cultures directly after the original isolation. It is therefore concluded that the genetic variation observed in the populations screened during this study occurred during the life cycle of the fungus in its natural field environment.\n\nGenetic diversity within a species can also be caused by asexual events that include hyphal anastomosis (Molnar et al., 1990), selfing (Anderson & Kohn, 1995), normal mutations (Koenig et al., 1997; Bentley et al., 1998; O'Donnell et al., 1999) and events occurring during parasexual cycles (Kuhn et al., 1995; Taylor et al., 1999). There is no evidence for parasexual recombination as an important generator of genetic diversity in vivo for any fungal system. The high levels of genetic diversity observed in C. beticola cannot be explained by mutation only, thus it is proposed that, apart from asexual recombination, a sexual cycle must be present for this pathogen.\n\nNo geographic boundaries could be enforced on the European populations based on the country of isolation because of the low population subdivision and low genetic distances between them, and because of shared haplotypes. Also, the Iranian population was not differentiated from the European populations. Sharing of haplotypes among geographic populations could be explained by man-mediated dispersal, as import and export of host material between countries in the European Union readily occurs because of the open borders. The high gene flow and low genetic distance and differentiation values observed between European populations and Iran indicate that genotype transfer also readily takes place between these countries. Based on genetic distance analysis, the Iranian genotypes are intermingled with European isolates, but this was not found for the New Zealand isolates. Therefore, it can be concluded that the European populations and the population from Iran are panmictic.\n\nPennycook (1989) recorded C. beticola on sugar beet in New Zealand, and during the last few years it has been isolated from different localities in New Zealand (New Zealand Fungi Database, 2002). The population from New Zealand is readily distinguished from other populations because of its low gene diversity, high genetic distances and population subdivision. This genetic differentiation could either be due to a founder event, or the New Zealand populations might represent a different species of Cercospora. Groenewald et al. (2006a) included New Zealand isolates in a multi-gene phylogeny and could not distinguish them from the other C. beticola isolates. Also, the C. beticola-specific primers (Groenewald et al., 2005) amplified a product of the correct size for the New Zealand isolates. Only two private AFLP alleles and two null alleles were found to be specific to the New Zealand populations during this study. From these data it is concluded that the Cercospora isolates obtained from sugar beet in New Zealand are indeed C. beticola. Small population sizes and genetic drift during founder events could have resulted in genetic subdivision, as has been found for other Mycosphaerella populations (Boileau et al., 1992; Hayden et al., 2003). However, the specific origin of C. beticola in New Zealand is unknown. The first strain that was designated a type of C. beticola was described from Beta cicla in Italy in 1875 (Saccardo, 1876) and it is most likely that earlier sugar beet trade introduced C. beticola to New Zealand from Europe.\n\nSeveral studies have reported high levels of variation during the onset and progression of cercospora leaf spot on sugar beet (Wolf & Verreet, 2002, 2005), and that C. beticola has become resistant or has developed an increased tolerance to fungicides (Karaoglanidis et al., 2000; Weiland & Koch, 2004). Variation in fungicide resistance and variability in disease symptoms on resistant sugar beet plants make effective disease management difficult. It is likely that the high levels of genetic variation that exists within C. beticola plays a role in the variation in pathogenicity that has been reported.\n\nPrevious studies showed that some genetic variation exists within C. beticola, but it was not known whether this variation was due to sexual recombination. The results here indicate that the genetic variation observed in the isolates studied was most likely caused by recombination events. It is suggested that C. beticola has both an asexual and sexual reproduction system and that it is unlikely that only asexual reproduction occurs in C. beticola. The high levels of genotypic variation and the equal distribution of the mating types within populations suggest that sexual recombination events most likely play an important role in the reproductive cycle of this species."
