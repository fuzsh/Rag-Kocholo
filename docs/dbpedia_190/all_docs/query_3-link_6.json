        "text": "Helianthus verticillatus (whorled sunflower: Asteraceae) is a rare and endangered species growing naturally only in a few locations in the southeastern United States. This sunflower grows to a height between 2 and 4 m and produces spectacular sprays of yellow flower heads in late August through October. The species has potential as a landscape plant because of its showy characteristics and ease of cultivation, and because it attracts native pollinators and other insect visitors. Dark spots, caused by Alternaria alternata (Edwards et al. 2017), occur commonly on senescing lower leaves beginning in late June. In July and August 2019, plants grown in the nursery compound at the University of Tennessee and field locations developed <4 mm diameter circular leaf spots with small, white, papery centers surrounded by a thin band of purple, almost black, host tissue. There were no signs of a potential pathogen. Symptomatic leaves from the nursery were collected in mid-July and washed in water for 10 min, surface disinfested with 1.25% NaClO for 8 min, and rinsed with sterile water. Excised lesions and healthy tissues were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) supplemented with 10 mg of rifampicin/liter and incubated at room temperature. White cottony mycelium grew from lesions and after 10 days became gray/black and appressed to the medium. Conidia were not present, but a red pigment in the medium was evident. Cultures of two isolates were air-dried and pigments extracted with 100% ethyl acetate. The UV-visible spectrum of the pigment was very similar to a cercosporin standard. Genomic DNA from mycelium of two isolates was amplified using ITS1 and ITS4 primers (White et al. 1990) and sequenced. The sequence from one isolate was identical to Cercospora apii s. lat. from Lobelia cardinalis (GenBank KY940304: Trigiano et al. 2018), and another isolate differed at one base. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (MN587826, MN587827). The USDA fungal database (Farr and Rossman 2019) reported C. helianthi and C. helianthicola on several sunflower species in the world, and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence of C. helianthicola (Yuliarni et al. 2013: KC776156.1) was identical except at two positions to C. apii s. lat. (Trigiano et al. 2018) and isolates in this report. Isolates of Cercospora from sunflower were not included in a recent treatment of the genus, but members of the former C. apii s. lat. complex were placed into three clades (Bakhshi et al. 2018). Six healthy leaves were surface disinfested, dissected bilaterally, and placed on 1.5% water agar in Petri dishes. The upper surfaces of four half-leaves were inoculated with ∼5-mm-diameter plugs of Cercospora sp. mycelia grown on PDA for 7 days. Two fungal isolates were tested (four half-leaves/isolate). The remaining four half-leaves were treated with sterile PDA agar plugs as controls. All cultures were incubated at ∼22°C for 10 days. Within 5 to 7 days, half-leaves paired with the fungus had water-soaked, necrotic lesions with slight reddening of surrounding tissue; white papery centers were absent, ostensibly because of the high moisture within the Petri dishes. Half-leaves treated with sterile plugs remained green and healthy. Cercospora sp. was reisolated from lesions, and we concluded from the completion of Koch’s postulates, the production of cercosporin, and ITS sequences that the disease was caused by a Cercospora sp. This fungus does not kill plants but causes cosmetic damage on ornamental plantings of H. verticillatus during late stage of growth and after flowering.\n\nThe author(s) declare no conflict of interest."
