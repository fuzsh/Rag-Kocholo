        "text": "Cercospora (Mycosphaerellaceae) is a large genus of fungi comprising many important plant pathogens. In recent years DNA-based studies have revealed multiple genera of cercosporoid fungi being poly- and paraphyletic. Among these genera, the genus Cercospora has always been perceived as monophyletic. In the present study, phylogenetic inferences based on partial gene sequences of the LSU, ITS, ACT, TEF1-Î± and HIS loci, elucidated a cercospora-like taxon from Ammi majus to cluster in a clade apart from Cercospora s. str. In spite of numerous Cercospora spp. presently known from their DNA sequence data, this collection represents the first concrete evidence to the fact that the morphological characters previously attributed to Cercospora s. str. evolved more than once in the Mycosphaerellaceae. The genus Neocercospora is subsequently introduced to accommodate the Iranian taxon occurring on A. majus. Further collections on other hosts and from different continents are now required to es...\n\nThe genus Cercospora was erected by Frensious (1863). Etymologically the generic name means a fungus has obclavate (Tail shaped) spores. The species concept and taxonomy of Cercospora are based upon morphological criteria, primarily the dimensions and characteristics of the conidia (length, width, base, and tip) and conidiophores (length, diameter, geniculation, and fasciculation) (Chupp, 1954). In his monograph on the genus Cercospora, Chupp (1954) discussed the reliability of the various characteristics used to distinguish and identify the species. Among the characteristics of conidia, spore width is considered to be the most reliable feature. Indeed, this characteristic is a major criterion used to distinguish C. canescens from leaves of mungbean, and other legumes. In general, other conidial features are less reliable, because they are either influenced to a large extent by environmental conditions (e.g., length) or represented by too few distinctive forms (e.g., features of the...\n\nThe Mycosphaerellaceae represent thousands of fungal species that are associated with diseases on a wide range of plant hosts. Understanding and stabilising the taxonomy of genera and species of Mycosphaerellaceae is therefore of the utmost importance given their impact on agriculture, horticulture and forestry. Based on previous molecular studies, several phylogenetic and morphologically distinct genera within the Mycosphaerellaceae have been delimited. In this study a multigene phylogenetic analysis (LSU, ITS and rpb2) was performed based on 415 isolates representing 297 taxa and incorporating ex-type strains where available. The main aim of this study was to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among the genera currently recognised within the family, and to clarify the position of the cercosporoid fungi among them. Based on these results many well-known genera are shown to be paraphyletic, with several synapomorphic characters that have evolved more than once within the family...."
