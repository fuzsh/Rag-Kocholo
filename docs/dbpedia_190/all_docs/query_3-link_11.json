        "text": "This paper is the fourth contribution in the Genera of Phytopathogenic Fungi (GOPHY) series. The series provides morphological descriptions and information about the pathology, distribution, hosts and disease symptoms, as well as DNA barcodes for the taxa covered. Moreover, 12 whole-genome sequences for the type or new species in the treated genera are provided. The fourth paper in the GOPHY series covers 19 genera of phytopathogenic fungi and their relatives, including Ascochyta , Cadophora , Celoporthe , Cercospora , Coleophoma , Cytospora , Dendrostoma , Didymella , Endothia , Heterophaeomoniella , Leptosphaerulina , Melampsora , Nigrospora , Pezicula , Phaeomoniella , Pseudocercospora , Pteridopassalora , Zymoseptoria , and one genus of oomycetes, Phytophthora . This study includes two new genera, 30 new species, five new combinations, and 43 typifications of older names.\n\nThe genus Cercospora includes many important plant pathogenic fungi associated with leaf spot diseases on a wide range of hosts. The mainland of Iran covers various climatic regions with a great biodiversity of vascular plants, and a correspondingly high diversity of cercosporoid fungi. However, most of the cercosporoid species found to date have been identified on the basis of morphological characteristics and there are no cultures that support these identifications. In this study the Consolidated Species Concept was applied to differentiate Cercospora species collected from Iran. A total of 161 Cercospora isolates recovered from 74 host species in northern Iran were studied by molecular phylogenetic analysis. Our results revealed a rich diversity of Cercospora species in northern Iran. Twenty species were identified based on sequence data of five genomic loci (ITS, TEF1-α, actin, calmodulin and histone H3), host, cultural and morphological data. Six novel species, viz. C. convolvulicola, C. conyzae-canadensis, C. cylindracea, C. iranica, C. pseudochenopodii and C. sorghicola, are introduced. The most common taxon was Cercospora cf. flagellaris, which remains an unresolved species complex with a wide host range. New hosts were recorded for previously known Cercospora species, including C. apii, C. armoraciae, C. beticola, C. cf. richardiicola, C. rumicis, Cercospora sp. G and C. zebrina.\n\nCassava brown leaf spot surveys were conducted in the main cassava plantation areas of China between 2007 and 2012 in order to understand the distribution of the disease. Cassava plants were damaged by the disease to different degrees in most of the survey sites. Samples were collected and seven strains were isolated from lesions. The mycelium-breaking plus black light induction method was applied for sporulation. Microconidia were formed by means of fragmentation on artificial medium plates. When the leaf was stabbed and inoculated with conidia solution, similar symptoms were formed 14 days later. Morphological characteristics of the specimens and conidia were similar to descriptions of Passalora henningsii infection. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA were obtained with primer pair ITS1/ITS4 and deposited in GenBank, which differed by three base pairs from that of the P. henningsii isolate (AF284389). The ITS sequences of related species were downloaded from the NCBI database, and phylogenetic analysis showed that the sequences originating from our strains clustered in the same clade as the AF284389 isolate. Biological characteristics were evaluated in two strains from different sites, which indicated that the optimum conditions for mycelia growth were a temperature of 26° to 28°C, carrot agar medium, pH 6, and continuous dark; cassava leaf juice added to malt extract and cassava leaf juice added to potato dextrose agar were the best media for conidia production. The optimal and lethal temperatures for macroconidia germination were 26° to 28°C, and 60°C for 10 min, respectively.\n\nPurple nutsedge (Cyperus rotundus L.) is considered to be the worst weed in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Although the plant is a low grower it has very strong competitive abilities. The influence of initial tuber size and cold treatment on tuber sprouting, accumulation of plant biomass and new tubers formation was studied. Tubers sprouted continuously over 30-50 days with significantly lower sprouting ability of small tubers (0.1-0.2 g). Short cold treatment (4 C for 4 days) significantly stimulated sprouting process. The early sprouting of cold treated tubers led to increased number of shoots and inflorescences and therefore more intensive biomass accumulation, as well as more intensive formation of new tubers. The increase in total biomass accumulation raises the reproductive and spreading potential of the weed.\n\nLeaf blight and purple seed, caused by the fungal pathogen Cercospora kikuchii (Matsumoto & Tomoyasu) M. W. Gardner are very important diseases of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) in Argentina. The aims of this work were: (a) to confirm and to assess the genetic variability among C. kikuchii isolates collected from different soybean growing areas in Santa Fe province using inter simple sequence repeats (ISSR) markers and sequence information from the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of rDNA and (b) to analyze the cercosporin production of the regional C. kikuchi isolates in order to assess whether there was any relationship between the molecular profiles and the toxin production. Isolates from different regions in Santa Fe province were studied. The sequence of the ITS regions showed high similarity (99-100%) to the GenBank sequences of C. kikuchii BRCK179 (accession number AY633838). The ISSR markers clustered all the isolates into many groups and cercosporin content was highly variable among isolates. No relationship was observed between ITS region, ISSR groups and origin or cercosporin content. The high degree of genetic variability and cercosporin production among isolates compared in this study characterizes a diverse population of C. kikuchii in the region.\n\nThe aims of the present study were to analyze the genetic variability of Cercospora kikuchii isolates and the in vitro cercosporin production, of these isolates obtained from soybean at the central-northern region of Santa Fe province (Argentina). Also the relationship between RAPD profiles and toxin production was also assessed. The strain C. kikuchii NBRC 6711 and 13 soybean isolates with symptoms of leaf blight were tested. Cercosporin production was analyzed by growing the fungus on Potato Dextrose Agar, extracting the toxin in alkaline medium and determining its concentration by spectrophotometry. The population of C. kikuchii studied showed variability, both genotypically, nine different groups were encountered, and have the ability to produce cercosporin. No relationship was found between toxin production and the RAPD profiles.\n\nCercospora kikuchii, involved with the defoliation of soybean (Glycine max) plants, is normally associated with Septoria glycines in late season. Seventy-two isolates from different regions in Brazil, obtained mainly from purple stained seeds, showed phenotypic variation. Cercosporin content and rate of colony growth was higly variable among isolates. A strong correlation between cercosporin content and virulence was identified. Genetic variation among and within populations was evaluated based on 86 RAPD loci. The RAPD analysis clustered all isolates into seven groups. No relationship was observed between RAPD groups and geographic origin or cercosporin content. The sequence of the internal spacer regions (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) from 13 isolates chosen according to the previous RAPD and clustering analysis showed high similarity (97%-100%) to the GenBank sequences of C. kikuchii (AY266160, AY266161, AY152577 and AF291708). It is clear from this work that Brazilian isolates of C. kikuchii from different geographic regions, are variable in relation to virulence, RAPD profiles and cercosporin content. Cercosporin content could be a good parameter for choosing an adequate isolate for screening resistant or tolerant cultivars. Considering that this pathogen is easily seed-borne, findings are expected to show the same haplotypes in different regions. Migration could be favoured by infected seeds as demonstrated by RAPD analysis."
