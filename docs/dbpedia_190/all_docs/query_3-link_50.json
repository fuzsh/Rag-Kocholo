        "text": "Molecular Fungal Detection Assays\n\nConventional PCR\n\nPCR has numerous positive characteristics, including rapidity, specificity, sensitivity and easy interpretation, which make it suitable for detection of seedborne pathogens (Walcott, 2003; Ward et al., 2004).\n\nAs a result of this great potential, over the past 20 years, many PCR-based assays have been reported for the identification of seedborne pathogens; e.g. Ascochyta lentis from lentil seeds, Alternaria radicina from carrot seeds, Alternaria brassicae in cruciferous seeds, Leptosphaeria maculans from canola seeds, and Phoma valerianella from lamb's lettuce seeds (Hussain et al., 2000; Pryor & Gilbertson, 2001; Guillemette et al., 2004; Landa et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2010; Pellegrino et al., 2010). PCR-based methods also provide rapid and unequivocal identification of F. oxysporum f. sp. basilici from basil seeds, unlike the conventional detection methods that cannot distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic F. oxysporum isolates (Baayen, 2000; Chiocchetti et al., 2001).\n\nOne of the most important advantages that molecular-based detection techniques have over conventional diagnostic methods is the ability, in principle, to distinguish between closely related organisms. However, the presence of compounds within the seeds that can inhibit DNA amplification, resulting in false negatives, can be a problem. To overcome these limitations, several modifications have been developed, starting from DNA extraction, to the amplification of the DNA.\n\nThe DNA recovered from seeds after phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation often contains PCR inhibitors that cannot be removed by repeated washing with 70% ethanol or by repeated DNA precipitation. Dilution of DNA extracts has been shown to eliminate the effects of PCR inhibitors, but it also reduces the PCR sensitivity (Demeke & Jenkins, 2010). To overcome this problem, the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method can be applied with the addition of particular chemical and enzymatic treatments (Terry et al., 2002). To remove polysaccharides and proteins, treatments with enzymes such as pectinase, cellulase, hemicellulose, α-amylase, proteinase K and glycoside hydrolases can be used (Rether et al., 1993; Demeke & Jenkins, 2010). Alternatively, the high levels of polysaccharides in soybean and chickpea seeds during DNA extraction can be precipitated using high concentrations of NaCl and Sarcosyl (Sharma et al., 2002). There are several other methods for reducing the effect of PCR inhibitors. A silica matrix purification can be used instead of ethanol precipitation to recover the DNA. The DNA recovered from lettuce seeds using a silica matrix does not contain the brown pigments that are responsible for inhibition of DNA amplification, and the DNA of the target fungus, F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae, can be consistently amplified without the requirement for further dilution (Demeke & Jenkins, 2010; Mbofung & Pryor, 2010). Commercial DNA extraction kits can also efficiently remove most PCR inhibitors (Ma & Michailides, 2007); this has allowed the detection of several fungal pathogens from seeds, such as Ascochyta rabiei from chickpea seeds (Phan et al., 2002), L. maculans from canola seeds (Chen et al., 2010), and Botrytis spp. from onion seeds (Chilvers et al., 2007). However, their cost is higher than that of CTAB methods.\n\nReagents can be added to PCR mixture buffers, to allow consistent amplification of the target DNA fragment from undiluted DNA extracts from seeds. To detect A. radicina on carrot seeds efficiently, Pryor & Gilbertson (2001) reported that the addition of 0.2% skimmed milk in the PCR mixture allowed consistent amplification of the target fungal DNA from the undiluted DNA obtained from infected seeds. Bovine serum albumin improves the sensitivity for the detection of F. oxysporum f. sp. basilici from basil seeds (Pasquali et al., 2006) and Alternaria alternata and A. radicina from infected carrot seeds (Konstantinova et al., 2002). The use of 8% glycerol has been reported to improve the amplification efficiency and specificity of the detection of Diaporthe phaseolorum and Phomopsis longicolla in soybean seeds (Zhang et al., 1999). The addition of bovine lacto transfer technique optimizer (BLOTTO) in PCR reaction buffers, which comprises skimmed milk powder, phosphate-buffered saline and sodium azide, can also attenuate inhibitory effects of polyphenolic and other compounds derived from plant tissues (De Boer et al., 1995), although to date this has not been tested in amplification reactions with DNA extracted from seeds. However, while these reagents have proven to be effective for the elimination of the effects of PCR inhibitors, their usefulness and their optimal concentrations have to be tested in each case, as some of these reagents might themselves inhibit PCR amplifications when they are used at concentrations that are too high (Wilson, 1997; Koonjul et al., 1999).\n\nPCR has numerous advantages, but the presence of low levels of the target fungus on the seeds can be a problem and may result in a false negative. The major disadvantage of this technique is that it does not provide accurate information concerning the percentage of contaminated seeds, which is an important parameter for seed growers and seed trading companies.\n\nBIO-PCR\n\nSeeds are often infested with fungi at very low levels, and consequently the DNA of the pathogen is not sufficient for the subsequent reactions (De Boer et al., 1995). To overcome this problem, Schaad et al. (1995) developed a highly sensitive PCR technique, named BIO-PCR. This consists of a pre-assay incubation step to increase the biomass of the fungal pathogen on the seeds, which is then followed by DNA extraction and amplification by PCR. Initially, this technique was applied mainly for phytopathogenic bacteria, as these are easily and rapidly cultured over 2–3 days in a growth medium (Weller et al., 2000); later, this was also shown to be effective for fungi (Munkvold, 2009).\n\nSeveral incubation methods have been tested to facilitate rapid and consistent fungal growth, one of which includes the incubation of seeds in liquid fungal growth medium (Phan et al., 2002). However, the fungal growth may be limited or suppressed by the presence of bacteria and the addition of antibiotics to the substrate might not always suppress bacterial growth, which thus decreases the reliability of the PCR assay (Pryor & Gilbertson, 2001; Mbofung & Pryor, 2010). The use of specific media can avoid this problem, increasing the biomass of fungal pathogens, as seen for L. maculans and A. rabiei from rapeseeds (Taylor, 1993) and chickpea seeds (Phan et al., 2002), respectively.\n\nOther pre-assay methods include an incubation on moistened filter paper, or just on the surface of a plastic Petri dish under conditions of high humidity, such as used to increase the low levels of target F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae on lettuce seeds (Mbofung & Pryor, 2010) and A. radicina on carrot seeds (Pryor & Gilbertson, 2001). The absence of nutrients allows the development of fungal growth on the seed surface, with little or no bacterial growth (Pryor & Gilbertson, 2001). Also, it is important to determine the incubation period precisely (Schaad & Frederick, 2002), in order to identify a compromise between growth of the target microorganism and limitation of other saprophytic fungi (Phan et al., 2002).\n\nBIO-PCR has several advantages over traditional PCR: increased sensitivity, elimination of PCR inhibitors, and detection of viable cells only, thus avoiding false positives due to detection of DNA from dead cells (Marcinkowska, 2002). The negative aspects of BIO-PCR are that it is more expensive than conventional PCR, especially if selective media are used (Schena et al., 2004), and that it usually requires from 5 to 7 days for the fungal growth, which significantly increases the time required for completion of the assays (Walcott, 2003).\n\nNested PCR\n\nAnother way to obviate the low levels of the target fungus on seeds is the use of nested PCR. This procedure can improve the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, thus allowing detection of a target DNA at several-fold lower levels than for conventional PCR (Chiocchetti et al., 2001). Indeed, nested PCR has been used to detect DNA levels of 10 fg for Colletotrichum lindemuthianum in bean seeds (Chen et al., 2007), and of 1 fg for F. oxysporum f. sp. lactucae in lettuce seeds (Mbofung & Pryor, 2010). However, this molecular assay is more labour intensive, more costly, and more prone to contamination than conventional PCR (McCartney et al., 2003; Atkins & Clark, 2004; Tomlinson et al., 2005).\n\nReal-time PCR\n\nAlthough conventional PCR is relatively sensitive and specific as well as being rapid, the main disadvantage is that it only gives qualitative data. Real-time PCR is able to generate a specific fluorescent signal detected by an integrated fluorometer to provide real-time analysis of reaction kinetics and so allows quantification of specific DNA targets (Atkins & Clark, 2004; Schena et al., 2004; Ward et al., 2004).\n\nWith limited sample manipulation, real-time PCR significantly reduces the risk of false positives due to cross-contamination of the reaction mixtures (Cullen et al., 2001; Gachon et al., 2004; Tomlinson et al., 2005). This technique is less time-consuming than other assays (Guillemette et al., 2004; Chilvers et al., 2007), and is characterized by a high sensitivity in the order of magnitude of a few femtograms of DNA (Chen et al., 2013).\n\nWhen applied to infected seeds, quantitative real-time PCR assays, with the use of SYBR Green dye and TaqMan-labelled probes, have shown high sensitivity for the detection and quantification of seedborne pathogens. For example, quantitative real-time PCR has been used to detect and quantify Verticillium dahliae on spinach seeds (Duressa et al., 2012), A. brassicae on cruciferous seeds (Guillemette et al., 2004), Botrytis spp. on onion seeds (Chilvers et al., 2007), and C. lindemuthianum on dry bean seeds (Chen et al., 2013). Multiplex real-time PCR uses multiple primers (together with probes in the TaqMan assay) in the same reaction, to reduce costs and labour. To ensure adequate specificity and sensitivity, and comparable amplification efficiency of different pathogens in real-time PCR assays, it is critical to choose the appropriate target DNA fragments for the design of the primers and probes.\n\nMagnetic-capture hybridization PCR\n\nMagnetic-capture hybridization (MCH)-PCR combines initial DNA extraction with a purification step that includes hybridization with a single-stranded DNA probe on magnetic beads, with the subsequent PCR amplification of the relevant DNA region. This technology can capture specific target DNA, thus facilitating detection of specific DNA sequences by PCR (Jacobsen, 1995; Reeves, 1998). MCH-PCR has been successfully used to detect pathogenic microorganisms in materials that contain PCR inhibitory compounds, e.g. Botrytis aclada in onion seeds (Walcott et al., 2004). Also, a MCH multiplex real-time PCR assay has been developed to detect two different pathogens, Didymella bryoniae and Acidovorax avenae subsp. citrulli, from watermelon and melon seeds (Ha et al., 2009). However, the adoption of MCH-PCR is still limited, although, in addition to the above-mentioned advantages of this application, its improved detection of pathogens will facilitate future research.\n\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification\n\nLoop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA is a recent technology that was developed by Notomi et al. (2000) as a simple, cost-effective and rapid method for specific detection of genomic DNA. LAMP uses a set of four or six primers and a thermophilic DNA polymerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus that has strand displacement activity to amplify DNA with high specificity and in less than 1 h (Mumford et al., 2006). This technology has several positive features: all of the reactions can be carried out under isothermal conditions; it does not require expensive equipment; and there are fewer preparation steps compared to conventional PCR and real-time PCR assays. Furthermore, as well as being highly specific, the amplification efficiency of LAMP is extremely high, which provides improved sensitivity, and robustness to the inhibitors that usually adversely affect PCR methods (Fu et al., 2011). LAMP products can be visualized by gel electrophoresis, by the use of magnesium pyrophosphate, which promotes precipitation of amplified DNA (Fukuta et al., 2003; Nie, 2005), with a real-time turbidity reader (Fukuta et al., 2004; Mori et al., 2004; Thai et al., 2004), or with the addition of an intercalating dye, such as SYBR Green I, which produces a colour change if the LAMP reaction is positive (Iwamoto et al., 2003; Mumford et al., 2006).\n\nTo date, the LAMP method has been applied in various assays for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections of humans and animals and the detection of plant pathogenic bacteria and viruses in host tissues and in insect vectors (Fukuta et al., 2003, 2004; Nie, 2005; Okuda et al., 2005). The first applications of LAMP for fungi were reported only recently. LAMP was very effective for the detection of Fusarium graminearum in total genomic DNA isolated from ground wheat grains (Niessen & Vogel, 2010) and from contaminated and germinated wheat seeds (Abd-Elsalam et al., 2011), thus demonstrating its use for early detection of toxigenic Fusarium species in cereals. Over the last 10 years, the LAMP technique has been widely applied in nucleic acid analysis. Therefore, given the numerous advantages provided by LAMP, its application can be extended to a larger number of types of plant tissues, including seeds.\n\nNext-generation sequencing (NGS)\n\nAfter a first application in basic biological research, NGS technologies have been extended to other fields of application, which have included plant disease diagnosis. Methods based on NGS technologies have been reported for the identification and characterization, in particular, of viruses that affect plants, and less so for pathogenic bacteria and fungi, where a powerful and generic front-line screen has been described (Adams et al., 2009, 2013; Kreuze et al., 2009; Rwahnih et al., 2009; Cantu et al., 2011). The application of Life Sciences 454 sequencing allowed analysis of RNAs from a grapevine showing Syrah decline symptoms, which revealed a multiple virus infection, including a novel virus (Rwahnih et al., 2009). As NGS has been a valuable technique for rapid identification of disease-causing agents from infected plants, it can also be applied to the detection of fungal pathogens in seeds. This technique has been applied to study the mycobiome of wheat seed, using 454 pyrosequencing, allowing the identification of several fungal genera (Nicolaisen et al., 2014). In view of this technology's great potential, the major sequencing platforms used for genome and other sequencing applications, 454 sequencing, AB SOLiD technology and Illumina/Solexa sequencing, are described below.\n\nThe first NGS technology that was proposed by Roche for the market was 454 sequencing, which bypasses cloning steps by taking advantage of PCR emulsion, a highly efficient in vitro DNA amplification method. It is based on colony sequencing and pyrosequencing. The pyrosequencing approach is a sequencing-by-synthesis technique that measures the release of pyrophosphate by producing light, due to the cleavage of oxyluciferin by luciferase. Currently, the 454 platform can produce 80–120 Mb of sequence in 200- to 300-bp reads in a 4 h run (Morozova & Marra, 2008; Barba et al., 2014).\n\nAB/SOLiD technology is sequencing by oligonucleotide ligation and detection (SOLiD). It depends on ligation-based chemistry with di-base labelled probes and uses minimal starting material. Sequences are obtained by measuring serial ligation of an oligonucleotide to the sequencing primer by a DNA ligase enzyme. Each SOLiD run requires 5 days and generates 3–4 Gb of sequence data with an average read length of 25–35 bp (Mardis, 2008; Morozova & Marra, 2008).\n\nIllumina/Solexa sequencing is similar to the Sanger-based methods, because it uses terminator nucleotides incorporated by a DNA polymerase. However, Solexa terminators are reversible, allowing continuation of polymerization after fluorophore detection and deactivation. Sheared DNA fragments are immobilized on a solid surface (flow-cell channel), and solid-phase amplification is performed. At the end of the sequencing run (4 days), the sequence of each cluster is computed and subjected to quality filtering to eliminate low quality reads. A typical run yields about 40–50 Mb (typical read length of 50–300 bp; Varshney et al., 2009; El-Metwally et al., 2014).\n\nThe availability of these NGS assays means that they should now be used to examine the presence of pathogens on or in seeds, especially 454 sequencing that has already been proven to identify fungi on seeds; they may prove useful in future for routine seed diagnosis.\n\nOther newly developed diagnostic techniques\n\nA recently applied tool that can reveal the presence of pathogenic fungi on seeds is known as the ‘biospeckle’ laser technique. This technique is based on the optical phenomenon of interference that is generated by a laser light that interacts with the seed coat. Examination of seeds under laser light allows the identification of areas with different activities (Braga et al., 2005; Rabelo et al., 2011). As fungi present on the seeds have biological activity, this method can detect their presence on seeds.\n\nAnother tool that can distinguish infected seeds from healthy seeds is a multispectral vision system, e.g. VideometerLab instrument, useful to determine the colour, texture and chemical composition of seed surfaces. The combinations of the features from images captured by visible light wavelengths and near-infrared wavelengths were valuable in the separation of healthy spinach seeds from seeds infected by Stemphylium botryosum, Cladosporium spp., Fusarium spp., Verticillium spp. or A. alternata (Olesen et al., 2011). A similar approach has already been used in a study on malting barley, to detect Fusarium spp. (S. Bodevin, Carlsberg Research Centre, Copenhagen, Denmark, personal communication).\n\nLuminex has developed novel technology that, since 2008, has been applied in plant pathogen diagnosis (Ishii et al., 2008). The Luminex PCR system is based on the hybridization between a biotin-labelled PCR product and an oligonucleotide probe coupled to distinct beads that specifically recognize differences in nucleotide sequences. As laborious and time-consuming procedures are not required, the potential of this technique is high and its application may be useful in the context of seed diagnosis. The Luminex xMAP system represents an alternative to ELISA; this technology is based on the use of antibody-coated paramagnetic microspheres (immunobeads) that are stained internally with fluorochromes. These beads act as microscopic ELISA wells. Initially, these techniques were applied in the clinical setting (De Boer & López, 2012), and they are now used for plant pathology applications; e.g. for multiplex detection of seedborne viruses and bacteria (Peters et al., 2007; Bergervoet et al., 2008). This Luminex xMAP technology has been applied for seed detection of several viral pathogens, including Lettuce mosaic virus and Pepino mosaic virus (Van der Burg, 2009). To date, this technology has not been tested on fungal pathogens in seeds, but in view of its enormous multiplexing capacity, whereby up to 100 pathogens can be analysed simultaneously in a single run, and its rapid analysis, it is an attractive technology for laboratory-based testing of samples (De Boer & López, 2012).\n\nReferences\n\nAbd-Elsalam K, Bahkali A, Moslem M, Amin OE, Niessen L, 2011.
