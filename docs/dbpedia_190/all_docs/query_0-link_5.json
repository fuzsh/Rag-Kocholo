        "meta_description": "The present paper is a continuation of a series of comprehensive taxonomic treatments of cercosporoid fungi (formerly Cercospora s. lat.), belonging to Mycosphaerellaceae (Ascomycota). This fifth contribution of this series proceeds with treatments of cercosporoid fungi on dicots and comprises species occurring on hosts belonging to the families Anacardiaceae and Annonaceae, which are described and illustrated in alphabetical order under the particular cercosporoid genera, supplemented by keys to the species concerned. A detailed introduction, a survey of currently recognised cercosporoid genera, a key to the genera concerned, and a discussion of taxonomically relevant characters were published in the first part of this series. The following taxonomic novelties are introduced: Passalora cotini sp. nov, P. guoana nom. nov, P. rhois-aromaticae sp. nov, and Pseudocercospora rhoicola.",

( Anacardiaceae to Annonaceae )\n\nAnacardiaceae\n\nCercospora\n\nCercospora species on Anacardiaceae\n\nCercospora mangiferae-indicae Munjal, Lall & Chona, Indian Phytopathol. 14: 185 (1962) [“1961”].\n\n(Fig. 1)\n\nLiterature: Crous & Braun (2003: 266), Kakoti et al. (1998), Kamal (2010: 62), Todawat Nawalsing & Papdiwal (2011).\n\nIllustration: Munjal et al. (1962: 187, fig. 6).\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, subcircular to irregular, 1–25 mm diam, scattered to gregarious, pale to medium dark brown, later with greyish brown to dingy greyish white centre and brown border on the upper leaf surface, brown with darker border below. Caespituli amphigenous, but mainly epiphyllous, scattered, delicately punctiform, dark brown. Mycelium internal. Stromata lacking or small, 10–30 µm diam, substomatal or immersed, intraepidermal, only composed of a few swollen hyphal cells, 3–10 µm diam, brown, wall somewhat thickened. Conidiophores in small to moderately large fascicles, mostly 2–20, erect, straight, subcylindrical or attenuated towards the tip, unbranched, not to moderately geniculate, 15–250 × 3–8 µm, pluriseptate, pale to medium brown or olivaceous brown throughout or paler towards the tip, wall slighty thickened, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, sometimes intercalary, 15–40 µm long, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, thickened and darkened, 2–4 µm diam. Conidia solitary, acicular, straight to curved, 20–200 × 3–6 µm, 1-to pluriseptate, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, apex subacute, base truncate, 3–4.5 µm wide, hila thickened and darkened.\n\nHolotype: India: New Delhi, India Agricultural Research Institute, on Mangifera indica, 11 Dec. 1959, V. Prakash (HCIO 26847).\n\nHost range and distribution: On Mangifera indica, Anacardiaceae, Asia (India, Asom, Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu), West Indies (Dominican Republic).\n\nNotes: This is a true Cercospora s. str., morphologically belonging to C. apii s. lat., but with relatively broad conidia, 3–6 µm. Records from the Dominican Republic refer to collections deposited as BPI 438068A,B. Conidiophores and conidia are morphologically barely distinguishable from those of C. verniciferae. The phylogenetic affiliation of this species is unknown.\n\nCercospora verniciferae Chupp & Viégas, Bol. Soc. Brasil. Agron. 8: 56 (1945).\n\n(Fig. 2)\n\nLiterature: Chupp (1954: 44), Crous & Braun (2003: 420), Guo et al. (2005: 32–33), Phengsintham et al. (2012: 50–51; 2013: 98).\n\nIllustration: Guo et al.

(2012: 52, fig. 1a, 53, fig. 1b; 2013: 99, figs 44–45).\n\nDescription: Leaf spots amphigenous, subcircular to angularirregular, 1.5–10 mm diam, later confluent and larger, yellowish brown to blackish brown. Caespituli hypophyllous. Mycelium internal. Stromata absent or small, substomatal, composed of a few dark brown cells. Conidiophores in small to moderately large fascicles, 2–20, arising from internal hyphae or stromatic hyphal aggregations, through stomata, divergent, erect, straight, subcylindrical to somewhat geniculate, unbranched, 25–345 × 3–5.5 µm, pluriseptate, medium to dark brown throughout or paler towards the tip, wall thin to somewhat thickened, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal and intercalary, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, 1.5–3 µm diam. Conidia solitary, acicular, straight to curved or sinuous, 30–175 × 2–5 µm, 3- to pluriseptate, hyaline, thin-walled, smooth, apex subacute, base truncate, 1.5–3 µm wide, thickened and darkened.\n\nLectotype (designated here, MycoBank, MBT204884): Brazil: São Paulo: Campinas, Santa Elisa Farm, Instituto Agronomico, on Toxicodendron verniciferum [Rhus vernicifera], Anacardiaceae, 28 Apr. 1936, A. S. Costa 1518 (CUP 41508). Isolectotype: IACM 1518.\n\nHost range and distribution: On Rhus (chinensis var. roxbourgii, succedanea), Spondias (dulcis, pinnata), Toxicodendron verniciferum, Anacardiaceae, Asia (Thailand), Oceania (Samoa), South America (Brazil).\n\nNotes: This species belongs to the Cercospora apii s. lat. complex. The identity of morphologically barely distinguishable collections on Spondias species from Asia and Oceania, referred to as C. verniciferae, is unclear and need molecular conirmation. The phylogenetic afiliation of C. verniciferae and its relation to C. mangiferae-indicae are unknown.\n\nDoubtful, excluded and insufficiently known species\n\nCercospora anacardii-occidentale Rangasw. et al., Scheme for Collection & Identification of Fungi of South India, Final Report: 12 (1969); nom. inval.

Type material could not be traced, and the taxonomic status of this species is unclear.\n\nCercospora megaspermae L.N. Bhardwaj & R.C. Sharma, Indian Forester 120: 545 (1994).\n\nLiterature: Kamal (2010: 64).\n\nIllustration: Bharadwaj & Sharma (1994: 546, fig. 1a).\n\nDescription: Leaf spots small, irregular, 1–5 mm diam.

Type material of C. toxicodendri, collected in Newfield before or in 1882, is not preserved at NY and could also not be traced in any other herbaria, but topotype material collected in 1885 is preserved in many herbaria. This material, designated by Braun (1998) as neotype, contains two fungi, one with colourless conidiophores and conidia and a second with pigmented structures, conspeciic with Cercospora bartholomei. Ellis (1882) described colourless conidia agreeing with the colourless Cercosporella present in the neotype material. Therefore, Braun (1998) restricted the name C. toxicodendri to the Cercosporella element and neotypiied this species accordingly. The correct name for Cercospora toxocodendri sensu Chupp (1954) is Passalora bartholomei.\n\nPassalora (s. lat.)\n\nKey to Passalora species on Anacardiaceae\n\nTabular key to Passalora species on Anacardiaceae according to host genera\n\nPassalora species on Anacardiaceae\n\nPassalora bartholomei (Ellis & Kellerm.)

Caespituli amphigenous, punctiform, dark brown to blackish, scattered to gregarious. Mycelium internal.

Conidiophores in small divergent fascicles (2–8), arising from internal hyphae or small substomatal hyphal aggregations, through stomata, and in small to large fascicles (to about 20), arising from larger stromata (ascomatal initials), loose to dense, erect, straight to curved, subcylindrical, slightly attenuated towards the tip or often subclavate (width somewhat enlaged from base to top), not to slightly geniculate-sinuous, unbranched, 20–80 × 3–8 µm, aseptate or with 1–3 thin, not very conspicuous septa, medium to medium dark brown throughout or paler towards the tip, wall somewhat thickened, above all in the lower half, to 1 µm wide, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, 10–40 µm long, or conidiophores aseptate, i.e. reduced to conidiogenous cells, with a single to mostly several, sometimes numerous conidiogenous loci, conspicuous, thickened and darkened, 1–2 µm diam.

Other cercosporoid collections on Cotinus coggygria belong to Pseudocercospora cotini. The new species on Cotinus belongs to Passalora s. lat., based on the broad morphological concept of that genus outlined in Crous & Braun (2003) and Braun et al. (2013). It is a species with Passlora s. str./Cercosporidium-like morphology, i.e. with consistently internal mycelium in vivo and conidia consistently formed singly. However, Passalora s. lat. is polyphyletic. A phylogenetic revision of this complex is under preparation. Since phylogenetically circumscribed genera and traditionally applied morphological concepts within Passalora s. lat. are not in accordance with each other, phylogenetically correct reallocations of particular species are in future only possible on the base of molecular data. Hence, the new species on Cotinus can currently (tentatively) only be assigned to Passalora s. lat.\n\nPassalora guoana U.

Owing to colourless conidia, this species could even be allied to Cercospora s. str. However, Passalora is polyphyletic, and as long as the true generic afinity of this fungus remains unknown, we prefer to retain this species in Passalora s. lat. Mycovellosiella rhois Y.L. Guo as well as Passalora rhois (Y.L. Guo) Y.L. Guo are illegitimate names. Therefore, a new legitimate name is required for this species. The epithet “rhoidis” is undoudedly the wrongly formed genitive of Rhus that must correctly be “rhois”, and cannot be interpreted as an arbitrarily formed name. Furthermore, “rhoidis” and “rhois” (the wrong and correct genitive of Rhus) would be confusable names according to Art. 53.3 that have to be treated as homonyms.\n\nPassalora marmorata (Tranzschel ex Sacc.)

Aptroot (2006: 19, fig. 762; 175) examined isotype material of Venturia rhois, described much smaller ascospores (11–13 × 2.5–3 µm), and stressed that this species, pertaining to Mycosphaerella sect. Caterva, is morphologically indistinguishable from M. subradians.\n\nPassalora rhois (E. Castell.) U.

The type material of the new species was originally identified and deposited as “Cercospora rhoina”. However, the true generic affinity of the new species on Rhus aromatica is unclear and can in future only be clarified on the base of molecular analyses. Following the traditional morphological concept of cercosporoid genera, the fungus on Rhus aromatica can currently only be placed in Passalora s. lat. owing to a combination of conspicuous conidiogenous loci and pigmented conidia. Based on consistently internal mycelium, fasciculate conidiophores emerging through stomata, and conidia formed singly, this species belongs to a morphological complex of cercosporoid fungi around Passalora s. str. and Cercosporopidium. Passalora s. lat. (sensu Crous & Braun 2003) is polyphyletic. Morphological traits traditionally used for the discrimination of genera and morphological groups within this complex are not clearly connected with phylogenetic groupings, i.e. morphology is almost meaningless and reliable allocations to genus depend in future on phylogenetic analyses.\n\nPseudocercospora\n\nKey to species of Pseudocercospora, Scolecostigmina and Stigmina on Anacardiaceae\n\nPseudocercospora species on Anacardiaceae\n\nPseudocercospora anacardii E.

Caespituli amphigenous, subeffuse below, punctiform above, brown to blackish brown. Mycelium internal and external; superficial hyphae on the lower leaf surface, emerging through stomata, arising from stromata or the base of conidiophore fascicles, sparingly branched, septate, 1.5–3(−5) µm wide, subhyaline to pale olivaceous, thin-walled, smooth. Stromata absent, above all on the lower leaf surface, to developed, above all on the upper leaf surface, 10–50 µm diam, medium to dark olivaceous brown, composed of swollen hyphal cells, circular to somewhat irregular in outline, 2–6 µm diam. Conidiophores on the lower leaf surface in small, loose fascicles, about 2–5, emerging through stomata, and solitary, arising from supericial hyphae, lateral, occasionally terminal, on the upper leaf surface in small to moderately large fascicles, arising from stromata, through stomata or erumpent, erect to decumbent, straight, subcylindrical or somewhat narrowed towards the tip, barely to distinctly geniculate-sinuous, simple, rarely branched, 5–65 × 3–6(−7) µm, 0–3(−7)-septate, pale to medium olivaceous or olivaceous brown, wall thin, smooth; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal, sometimes conidiophores reduced to conidiogenous cells, 5–25 µm long, proliferation sympodial, conidiogenous loci unthickened, not darkened, often truncate, sometimes subdenticulate.

Above all, the name Cercospora toxicodendri has been used for different cercosporoid fungi (Braun 1998). The North American P. infuscans is morphologically comparable to and possibly confusable with the present new Asian species, but differs in having shorter and wider conidia, 30–70 × 3–9 µm, and lacking stromata. The conidiophores are often subclavate and may proliferate percurrently. Additional Japanese material has been examined: Yamagata, Kamabuchi, on R. javanica, 15 Oct. 1950, T.

This widespread species has a broad host range amongst species of Rhus and allied genera and is morphologically rather variable. Collections on Toxicoxdendron orientale [Rhus ambigua] in Japan are, for instance, characterized by having relatively narrow conidia at the lower limit of the variation. It is doubtful that all collections from Africa and Asia are conspecific with North Americal collections. Sarbajna & Chattopadhyay (1991) described and illustrated P. rhoina from India (West Bengal) on Rhus sp. The collection concerned was misidentified and belongs to P. rhoicola. Kamal (2010) listed Rhus aromatica as additional Indian host of P. rhoina. Source and identity of the latter record are unclear and unproven. North American records of P. rhoina on Cotinus coggygria are based on confusions with P. cotini (see notes under P. cotini).\n\nPseudocercospora rhois Y.L. Guo & X.J. Liu, Acta Mycol.

However, Phaeoisariopsis pulgaonvensis is a saprobic, non-cercosporoid hyphomycete growing on dead stems of Mangifera indica, at first glance resembling the saprobic, synnematous genus Podosporium, but the genuine generic afinity of P. pulgaonvensis requires a re-examination of type material, which was not available.\n\nStigmina curvispora Crous & U.

Based on its type species, Scolecostigmina turned out to be a phylogenetically separate genus clustering apart of Pseudocercospora (Crous et al. 2013), but other species previously assigned to Scolecostigmina belong in Pseudocercospora. Therefore, the veriication of the proper generic afinity of S. curvispora needs phylogenetic data. Thus, we prefer to keep this species tentatively in Stigmina.\n\nStigmina knoxdaviesii Crous & U.

Isolectotypes: CUP 39256, S-F23405.\n\nHost range and distribution: On Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra [caffra], Anacardiaceae, South Africa (Transvaal).\n\nNotes: This species is tentatively maintained in Stigmina s. lat. The latter genus has been reduced to synonymy with Pseudocercospora since the type species of Stigmina, S. platani (Fuckel) Sacc. (conidia distoseptate), clusters within the big Pseudocercospora clade (Crous et al. 2006), and Pseudocercospora has been conserved against the older name Stigmina (Braun & Crous 2006). However, the genuine generic afinity of S. knoxdaviesii is still unknown and not yet proven by means of sequence analyses. The shape and structure of the conidiophores, conidiogenous cells as well as euseptate conidia are reminiscent of Scolecostigmina, a genus segregated from Stigmina due to pluriseptate, scolecosporous conidia. The type species of the latter genus clusters distantly from the Pseudocercospora clade, but other species previously assigned to Scolecostigmina belong to Pseudocercospora (Crous et al. 2013). Therefore, a final conclusion about the generic affinity of S. knoxdaviesii requires phylogenetic data. The material deposited at PREM, which is in better condition than the meagre type collection in S, is designated as lectotype.\n\nStigmina pulviniformis (Syd.) S. Hughes, Mycol.

Caespituli hypophyllous, punctiform, in small groups, later conluent, forming continuous dark brown patches, pulvinate. Mycelium internal. Stromata large, immersed to somewhat erumpent, to 200 µm diam, brown.

Conidia solitary, ellipsoid-ovoid to oblong, short subcylindrical, straight, rarely slightly curved, 18–35 × 8–11.5 µm, with 1–4 transverse septa and occasionally a single longitudinal or oblique septum, brown, wall somewhat thickened, smooth, apex rounded, base short obconically truncate, hila not thicker and not darker than the lateral wall.\n\nLectotype (designated here, MycoBank, MBT204895): South Africa: Cape Province: Cape Town, St James, on Rhus tomentosa, 22 Dec. 1912, G.

However, the phylogenetic afinity of S. pulviniformis is still unknown and this species is morphologically not scolecostigmina-like. On the other hand, it resembles the type species of Stigmina which proved to cluster within the Pseudocercospora clade. Stigmina pulviniformis needs to be sequenced and reassessed. Therefore, we prefer to maintain this species in Stigmina, at least tentatively until its phylogenetic afinity is clariied.\n\nStigmina rhois Crous & U.

(1999) introduced the genus Scolectostigmina with Cercospora mangiferae as type species. This genus is morphologically close to Pseudocercospora, above all to species with percurrently proliferating conidiogenous cells, previously assigned to Cercostigmina, which is now a synonym of Pseudocercospora, but distinguished by having conidiogenous cells with coarse annellations, usually verruculose, and thick-walled conidia. The morphological differentiation from Pseudocercospora spp. is not sharp and rather gradual, but molecular analyses recently carried out by Crous et al. (2013) unequivocally conirmed Scolectostigmina as a genus of its own. Type material could not be traced. Suitable material for a neotypiication from Java was also not available. Therefore, the typiication of this species has been postponed and should be done in connection with fresh collections, cultures and sequence analyses.\n\nZasmidium s. lat.

Mycelium internal and external; superficial hyphae emerging through stomata, branched, mostly at right angles, straight to somewhat lexuous, sinuous, 1–3 µm wide, subhyaline, pale olivaceous to olivaceous brown, pale, thin-walled, verruculose, hyphae around conidiophores often somewhat darker, wider, to 4.5 µm, with slightly thickened walls. Stromata lacking. Conidiophores solitary, arising from supericial hyphae, on top of mother cells, erect, straight, cylindrical to iliform-setiform, rarely branched, only fertile upper part geniculate-sinuous or slightly nodulose, 100–300 × 3–5 µm, pluriseptate throughout, pale to medium dark brown throughout or somewhat paler towards the tip, wall slightly thickened, smooth to somewhat rough; conidiogenous cells integrated, terminal or intercalary, 10–25 µm long, conidiogenous loci conspicuous, somewhat thickened and darkened, 1.5–2 µm diam.

The combination of this species into Stenella by Singh & Kamal (1979) was based on Indian material on Cassia fistula, which is, however, not conspecific and belongs to Stenella cassiae Abbasi & D.N. Shukla. Cercospora chandleri does not cause any lesions, but forms mixed infections with Asterina sp., but the two species are not associated, i.e., C. chandleri is not fungicolous. The mycelium of this species is only associated with green leaf tissue, so that C. chandleri has to be considered a plant parasite. However, a proper reassessment of the generic afinity of this species is not possible and must be based on cultures and sequence data. The zasmidium-like morphology is not suficient and unreliable for a reallocation since zasmidioid asexual morphs are associated with cercosporoid species belonging to various mainly phylogenetically circumscribed genera (see introduction). Therefore, we prefer to keep this species in Cercospora, at least tentatively until corresponding sequence analyses are available.\n\nAnnonaceae\n\nCercospora\n\nA single species.\n\nCercospora apii s. lat.

The identity of the collections concerned is unclear. C. apii s. lat. is a complicated complex of plurivorous and specialised taxa (Groenewald et al. 2013). Reliable identifications of such collections have to be based on cultures and molecular sequence alayses.\n\nPassalora species on Annonaceae\n\nPassalora annonacearum A.N.
