        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe sporulation of fungi is a complex process, which is influenced by a number of endogenous and environmental factors (Dahlberg and Etten Citation1982). While some fungi sporulate readily on artificial culture media others only do so when particular conditions are met. Cercosporoid fungi are a large group of ascomycetes containing many pathogenic species that are capable of causing disease to a wide range of both wild and cultivated plant species (Chupp Citation1953; To-Anun et al. Citation2011; Groenewald et al. Citation2013; Nguanhom et al. Citation2015). Two of the characteristics shared by the members of this group are their slow growth rate and scarce production of conidia when grown on most artificial culture media (Cooperman and Jenkins Citation1986; Mello et al. Citation2004; Leiva-Mora et al. Citation2008; Djebali et al. Citation2010; Chand et al. Citation2013). Many times, sporulation occurs only when mycelial growth is limited (Su et al. Citation2012) and this is why some of the nutrient-rich media routinely used to isolate and grow fungi in the laboratory, such as potato dextrose agar, do not normally induce sporulation. Since the production of great numbers of spores is usually necessary for the performance of many studies in the field of plant pathology, such as the artificial inoculation of plants to investigate the pathogenicity of these fungi, the development of protocols that will ensure such a production is a mandatory first step in these investigations.\n\nAraujia hortorum E. Fourn. (Apocynaceae) is a vine native to Argentina that has become an invasive weed in other parts of the world, including New Zealand, where it is generally known as moth plant. In its native range plants often exhibit symptoms of foliar diseases (Waipara et al. Citation2006) among which the rust Puccinia araujiae Lév. has been the most studied and recently approved for introduction in New Zealand as a biological control agent of moth plant in this country (Anderson et al. Citation2016). Lesions caused by Pseudocercospora fumosa (Speg.) U. Braun are quite common and easily recognised. Those caused by Cercospora sp. do not follow such a regular pattern and may be overlooked as the disease has not yet been fully characterised. Any experimental study to be conducted on these cercosporoid pathogens and the diseases they cause depends on the availability of inoculum. The aim of this work is to present the protocol that proved successful in promoting sporulation of both cercosporoid fungi, developed to enable the above mentioned experimental studies.\n\nDiscussion\n\nPrevious studies on Cercospora species found that inoculation of plates with a suspension of conidia rendered better results than the transference of sterile mycelium (Ekpo and Esuruoso Citation1978; Vathakos and Walters Citation1979; Cooperman and Jenkins Citation1986). This technique was successfully used for Cercospora sp. but unfeasible for P. fumosa due to its low conidial production in the qualitative test.\n\nFor both of the cercosporoid fungi isolated from A. hortorum the greatest number of conidia was obtained on ALA, the medium prepared with the incorporation of a decoction of leaves of the host. In contrast, sporulation was poor when whole autoclaved leaves of the host were laid on the surface of the medium. The use of vegetable and/or host tissues to induce the sporulation of cercosporoid species has long been used. Duggar (Citation1897) was successful in getting conidia of Cercospora apii when he grew the fungus on celery petioles and bean stems. Other classical examples are those of Nagel (Citation1934) who induced the sporulation of C. beticola by growing it on beet-leaf agar and Kilpatrick and Johnson (Citation1956) who tested the promotion of sporulation of several Cercospora species by growing them on media prepared with steamed leaves of carrot, magnolia, tulip and soybean, finding the best results with carrot leaves. However, there does not seem to be a universal rule since, as Nagel (Citation1934) pointed out, a medium suited to a particular species for optimal conidial production may not prove suitable for others. Several authors obtained good results when host tissues were employed to prepare the culture media. For example, Diachun and Valleau (Citation1941) for C. nicotianae on tobacco leaf agar, Vathakos and Walters (Citation1979) for C. kikuchii with the addition to the agar of a decoction of senescent soybean plants; and Beckman and Payne (Citation1983) for C. zeae-maydis with the addition of a decoction of leaves of maize. However, others did not find any stimulation whatsoever. For example, Ekpo and Esuruoso (Citation1978) for C. cruenta; Djebali et al. (Citation2010) for C. medicaginis; Hanada et al. (Citation2002) for Pseudocercospora fijiensis (as Paracercospora fijiensis); and, Cating (Citation2010) did not encounter any stimulation on the sporulation of P. dendrobii using a medium formulated with a decoction of leaves of its host, on which ALA is based. In other cases some sporulation was obtained using host tissues but it was sparse, as shown for C. asparagi (Cooperman and Jenkins Citation1986) and C. beticola (Verma and Agnihotri Citation1972), the latter authors being unable to reproduce the results reported earlier by Nagel (Citation1934).\n\nWe also found that both V8 and V8Ca induced the sporulation of Cercospora sp. and P. fumosa, albeit to a lesser degree than ALA. Other authors had previously found that V8 enhanced the sporulation of C. asparagi (Cooperman and Jenkins Citation1986), C. kikuchii (Chen et al. Citation1979; El-Gholl et al. Citation1982) and C. zeae-maydis (Beckman and Payne Citation1983). This culture medium was also effective in stimulating the sporulation of P. fijiensis (Leiva-Mora et al. Citation2008). Hanada et al. (Citation2002) were also successful in promoting the sporulation of the latter species with the addition of CaCO3 to V8. Calcium carbonate was one of the ingredients used to prepare ALA, as it is known to induce sporulation in diverse organisms, like bacteria (Mah et al. Citation2008) and fungi (Dhingra and Sinclair Citation1985). Its effect is well known on Alternaria species (Masangkay et al. Citation2000). Whether this effect is due to an increase in pH and/or to calcium supplementation is not known (Rodrigues et al. Citation2010).\n\nCercosporoid fungi are known to be mesophiles with their optimum growth and sporulation at around 25°C (Ekpo and Esuruoso Citation1978; Cooperman and Jenkins Citation1986). This is in accordance with our observations for Cercospora sp.\n\nMechanisms underlying the stimulation of sporulation by light are still unknown (Su et al. Citation2012). Different light regimes have been proven to induce conidiogenesis in Cercospora species. With a few exceptions, continuous darkness has been shown to inhibit or disfavour sporulation (Hanada et al. Citation2002) while incubation under light usually stimulates the production of conidia (Ekpo and Esuruoso Citation1978; Cooperman and Jenkins Citation1986). However, the most favourable regimes are those of alternating light and dark periods (Vathakos and Walters Citation1979; Beckman and Payne Citation1983; Paul and Munkvold Citation2005) such as the one used in the present study.\n\nAn incubation period of eight days on ALA was shown to be ideal for the production of inoculum for Cercospora sp. as a longer period did not lead to an increase in the number of conidia. For P. fumosa the best sporulation was measured after five days, the shortest incubation period tested. It is possible that the peak sporulation may have occurred before the five day sample, as counts after this time were lower in subsequent measurements. It should be noted that the colour of the fertile colonies of Cercospora sp. differs from that of the sterile ones, a difference that is obvious to the naked eye. Sterile colonies tend to have a whitish tinge due to the abundance of aerial vegetative mycelia while fertile colonies are dark brown to black owing to the presence of multiple conidiophores and conidia.\n\nThe success in the promotion of sporulation of both pathogens has allowed the development of further studies on the diseases they cause, which are currently underway to assess their potential application for biological control of moth plant. Our findings suggest that the medium formulated with leaves of moth plant may also be useful for other cercosporoid pathogens, at least for those affecting related hosts in the Apocynaceae."
