Mycelium is well-developed, branched, septate, slender, intercellular and brown coloured.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n2. Branched haustoria are present in C. personata. In C. arachidicola the haustoria are absent.\n\nConidiophores and Conidia:\n\n1. Only asexual reproductive bodies, i.e., conidia are present. Sexual reproduction is absent.\n\n2. Conidiophores are septate (Fig. 115), dark-coloured structures coming out in tufts from stomata.\n\n3. Conidia develop on geniculate structures.\n\n4. On liberation from conidiophore, each conidium leaves a small scar at the place of its attachment.\n\n5. Conidiophores are 22-41 µ long and 3-5µ broad.\n\nADVERTISEMENTS:\n\n6. Conidia are hyaline or pale yellow, obclavate, 38- 108µ long and 3-6µ broad. They are 4 to 12-septate (Fig. 116)."
