        "text": "A form genus of anamorphic obligate plant necrotrophs which cause pale brown, grey or whitish leaf-spots on living leaves. Under a hand lens, clusters of dark conidiophores can be seen emerging through the stomata, usually on the lower leaf surface. Under the microscope, the hyaline, cylindric conidia have numerous septa.\n\nCercospora anamorphs are found on a wide range of mostly herbaceous plants. A host-specific species concept has traditionally been followed resulting in a large number of species. This ignores a considerable body of work which demonstrates that many species have wide host ranges, even across multiple plant families."
