        "text": "SAN JOSE, CA - Dialogic Corporation, a pioneer in enabling interactive mobile video services and applications, and Veraz Networks, a leading provider of bandwidth optimization and next generation switching products, today announced the completion of the merger of the two companies.\n\nAt Veraz's special meeting of shareholders held on September 30, 2010, shareholders voted to approve three proposals: a merger with Dialogic Corporation; changing the name of the company to Dialogic Inc.; and a 5 for 1 reverse stock split of Veraz's issued and outstanding common shares resulting in approximately 31 million shares outstanding as of today.\n\nThe merged company, headquartered in San Jose, CA, is now named Dialogic and is publicly traded on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol (NASDAQ: DLGC). Nick Jensen leads the company as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer (formerly Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Dialogic), and Doug Sabella is the President and Chief Operating Officer (formerly Veraz President and Chief Executive Officer). The new DialogicÂ® product portfolio enables service providers, enterprises and developers to unleash the profit of video, voice and data for advanced networks.\n\n\"While the capability of mobile networks around the world has been steadily expanding, the future will bring even greater demands on these networks due to the unprecedented growth in global mobile data and video traffic,\" said Jensen. \"By combining Dialogic's proven expertise in enabling applications for voice and video with Veraz's leadership in voice and data session control, security and transport, we've created a company that gives our customers the technologies to maximize the multimedia capabilities of 3G/4G networks. In fact, over 2 billion mobile subscribers today communicate on the networks of service providers who have built their solutions on Dialogic products.\"\n\nThe merger of Dialogic and Veraz enhances the company's worldwide service and support offerings and creates an extensive global customer base that includes some of the largest customers in the service provider communications market, along with greater financial resources to pursue opportunities in markets throughout the world.\n\n\"As a customer of both Dialogic and Veraz, we believe that the merger of the two companies will continue to enable iBasis to meet the ever changing demands of the networks so we can connect voice, data and video calls to and from all types of fixed and wireless networks,\" said Ajay Joseph, CTO at iBasis, one of the largest carriers of international voice calls in the world and a division of Royal KPN N.V. \"We look forward to continuing our relationship with Dialogic and are pleased that their expanded product offering will help us further enhance our role as a global leader in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP).\"\n\n\"The combined Dialogic and Veraz is positioned to provide service providers with not only stand-alone media, including video, signaling and security solutions, but also integrated media, signaling and security which will make them competitive in the marketplace,\" said Diane Myers, Directing Analyst, Service Provider VoIP and IP Multimedia Subsytem (IMS) at Infonetics Research, a premier international market research and consulting firm specializing in data networking and telecom.. \"Session Border Controllers (SBCs) and media servers will be the main growth engines for the carrier VoIP market in 2010. For example, the SBC market is accelerating, with worldwide 2Q10 revenue up 27 percent sequentially and up 70 percent over 2Q09, a signal that IP-to-IP connectivity is continuing to overtake IP-to-TDM connectivity.\"\n\n\"With the merger of Veraz and Dialogic now complete, we are excited to start as a new company with a tremendous product portfolio, and we envision many opportunities for service providers, including their ability to offer enterprise solutions through initiatives such as cloud computing,\" said Sabella. \"Dialogic will have an unparalleled ability to deliver and manage voice, video and data services on an end to end basis and to offer our customers a broader range of solutions.\"\n\nFor specific information about VRAZ shares, DLGC shares, CUSIP numbers and other stock information, investors can access a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) about these topics at http://investor.dialogic.com/.\n\nAbout Dialogic\n\nFor over 25 years, Dialogic (NASDAQ: DLGC) has been providing communications platforms and technology to enterprise and service provider markets.
