        "text": "There are several different types of leadership theory and styles. Learning how they unfold and being able to identify those styles can help leaders develop their leadership aptitudes. More importantly, unveiling some stigmas can be detrimental for the leadership style someone may choose. In this article, there will be discussions pertinent to charismatic leaders and how their leadership style can impact inclusion and diversity. There will be some personality mentioned. However, the objective is not to criticize any of their leadership approaches, instead, they are just referred as a way of elucidating the Charismatic Leaders, and how important they are for inclusion and diversity.\n\nAn instinctive in-grouping and out-grouping of people by our psyche is a form of an adaptive ‘fixation’ that can lead to immense suffering for those excluded. Exposure to diversity is a foundational step to break free from this fixation, which has been supported by social movements pioneered by iconic leaders and is now vastly regulated through legislation, moral inclinations, as well as an acute recognition of the benefits of diversity to groups and organizations. Therefore, the role of leadership in enhancing diversity is proven and profound. However, the needs have now shifted to enhancing inclusion. While a concise definition of ‘inclusive leadership’ is under debate and overlaps yet differentiates itself from other forms of leadership, it is embedded in ensuring justice and equity, enabling people to belong to a group while helping them preserve their uniqueness, becoming conscious of one’s own privileges, as well as finding the voice to express our concerns and opinions skilfully when out-grouped. Inclusive leadership emanates at all levels in an organization, from top management to managerial levels, as well as at an employee level—from those belonging to privileged groups to those being out-grouped/marginalized. Collective leadership initiatives from all levels can allow for enhanced inclusivity.\n\nThis report, commissioned by the NHS Leadership Academy, sets out the evidence base for Building Leadership For Inclusion (BLFI) – an ambitious new programme of work that aims to (1) raise the level of ambition, (2) quicken the pace of change, and (3) ensure that NHS leadership is equipped to achieve and leave an ever-increasing and sustainable legacy in relation to equality, diversity and inclusion. The report has been written by a research team based at the University of the West of England and is informed by an extensive review of relevant literature, interviews with academic experts and preliminary action research with the BLFI team and partners.\n\nAbstract: Preparing administrators with the capacity to improve instruction for all learners is critical for recruiting and retaining special education teachers. However, recent research points out the need to improve skills of current and future administrators for this role. To address these concerns the special education and administrator preparation programs at a western university designed and conducted research to determine how well preservice principals were being prepared to improve instruction for all learners. To determine ...\n\nThis article proposes an inclusive model for educational reform leadership. As one of the combinations of forms of leadership and social inclusion is at the core of inclusive leadership. It offers a fresh perspective by which the people who care about equality may perceive and confront discrimination in their communities and schools. The layout of the article is as follows: initially, the terms \"leadership\" and \"formal education system\" are defined. Furthermore, the study addresses the difficulties that school staff members experience while adopting inclusive education in their schools. Taking a universal design approach to education, inclusive education necessitates significant adjustments to the educational system as a whole. This research is based on different analysis that will conclude about the leaderships on different levels in the education system of Palestine through different survey. The results show that schools have to access the provisions to limit the implementation and design towards leadership. Scoring the policies towards leadership needs to be reserved. There should be consistency among the teacher, staff principles, and administration staff to have the leadership to make the school team a better team."
