        "text": "Previous studies (especially in the US nonprofit sector) have found that organizations' overall use of social media platforms are focused on one-way communication strategies. Although more people are connecting everyday through social media, it seems companies are using social media for informational purposes rather than engaging stakeholders in conversations. However, is the same scenario of social media information currently presented on Spanish speaking regions like Puerto Rico? The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the top 400 locally owned Puerto Rican companies of 2013 are using social media platforms not only for information but for communication and mobilization as well. Mobilization means that companies are empowering customers and fans to do something (e.g. buy a product, share information or attend an event). However, is this way of empowerment to do something could be also seen as a symbol of control by corporations? A quantitative content analysis was performed to all the content posted by Puerto Rican companies on their official profiles on Facebook during a one month period. Every post sent during this period was coded using Lovejoy & Saxton's framework (information, community, and action), among other variables. A total of 122 companies were found with Facebook active profiles, representing an increase of 454% from previous years. As consistent with literature, companies are using social media for informational purposes (promotion of products and services mostly) and this pattern is presented in Puerto Rican companies as well. However, findings reveal a good percentage of companies using Facebook for mobilization rather than promoting dialogues.\n\nDOWNLOAD FULL DOCUMENT: https://www.quadriga-university.com/sites/default/files/document/2019-09/Quadriga-Reader_Corporate%20Activism_Ana%20Adi.pdf In recent years, corporate activism has intrigued, puzzled and challenged communicators. While in the past, activism and corporate communications were often presented as incompatible if not totally opposed (for that, all you need to do is leaf through any book of PR history published before 2000), a shift into what corporations can and should acknowledge seems to have haven taken place around 2010. Whether this is related to changes in technology (and more specifically, the rise of social media) or the increased visibility and success of social movements, or a combination of both, is still up for debate. It is also questionable whether critical PR scholarship calling for an integration of activism and communication (see my recent edited collection on Protest Public Relations, for example) has finally reached practitioners and corporations. This reader aims to tease out answers from practitioners, members and alumni of Quadriga University of Applied Sciences’ network. Conceived as a collection of research updates, opinion pieces, case studies and practical insight geared at communication practitioners and communication students, this reader has been designed as a conversation starter as well as classroom material. It is therefore structured in three parts: research updates, case studies, and tools and solutions from practitioners. To cover the background and evolution of corporate activism, there are two introductory articles: Anthony Gooch’s exploration of radical uncertainty and its influence on corporate activism, and Hemant Gaule’s article about corporate activism in India, focusing in particular on the drivers, risks and repercussions with some fantastic examples. The Research section is dedicated to some of the studies often referred to by contributors to this series: Weber Shandwick and KRC’s research into employee and CEO activism covered by Stephen Duncan and Johanna Hille; BRC’s research into creating a culture of purpose covered by Phil Riggins; and Kerstin Lohse-Friedrich’s study of China’s public diplomacy and its reactions to activism by western corporations. They all provide rich insight into perceptions and expectations of corporate activism as well as new perspectives. The Case Studies section is designed as classroom material. Joyce Costello reviews the evolution of Nike’s corporate activism over the past 30 years and some of Nike’s actions that conflicting with its declared values. Sebastian Biedermann and Sergiy Smetana’s case takes us into the future, discussing alternative sources of protein. They provides a detailed background on the issue and raise questions from a German’s association perspective. Finally, the Tools and Solutions section puts forward a variety of solutions from practitioners, for practitioners. Here, Jo Detavernier reviews his five questions around embracing corporate activism; Mike Klein focuses on internal audiences and their reactions to corporate involvement with corporate activism; and Virginie Coulloudon proposes a new, all-inclusive approach. Finally, the closing of the section and the reader is made by Thomas Stoeckle, who focuses on ethics and the seven traits of ethical leaders"
