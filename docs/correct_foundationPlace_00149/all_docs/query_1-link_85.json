        "text": "“Based on strong interest from the developer community in the Dallas, TX area, we felt it important to add a stop on the workshop tour,” said Alan Percy, Senior Director of Product Marketing at Dialogic. “As previous sessions have sold-out, I recommend that those interested register ASAP.”\n\nThe Dallas, TX workshop session will be held on November 3, 2016 at:\n\nGeniusDen\n\n3106 Commerce Street\n\nDallas, TX 75226\n\nDoors open at 8am (CDT) and adjournment is at 4pm (CDT). The workshop provides complimentary coffee/tea, snacks, and lunch. Participants should already be comfortable with basic programming principles and will need to bring their own laptop with a current Google Chrome browser. Every developer who attends the workshop will have an opportunity to participate in a closing micro hack to share their ideas and a chance to win prizes.\n\nAttendees to the workshops will be given instruction on how to develop cloud communications applications with voice, video, SMS, and WebRTC features using drag-and-drop development environment, a popular high-level mark-up language, and communications APIs. Building on this, the workshops also will provide instruction on mobile clients and mobile SDKs that support both Apple iOS and Android. Coursework materials include a number of supplied sample applications and plenty of lab time with instructor support, giving attendees an opportunity to turn their own ideas into actual applications.\n\nAdditional workshops are scheduled at a number of cities throughout fall of 2016:\n\nChicago, IL - Oct 4, 2016\n\nDallas, TX – Nov 3, 2016\n\nParis, France – Nov 10, 2016\n\nLisbon, Portugal - Nov 17, 2016\n\nFor more information, a current schedule, and to reserve your seat, please go to the WebRTC and Cloud Communications Developer Workshop Series website.\n\nAbout TeleStax\n\nTelestax is the company behind Restcomm™, the most widely adopted open source platform for developing and deploying real time communications applications.
