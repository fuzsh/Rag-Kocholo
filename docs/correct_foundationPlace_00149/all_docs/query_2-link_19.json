While the company has evolved in their offerings, the industry still perceives Dialogic as a provider of these legacy solutions. To help Dialogic re-invent themselves, we studied the current landscape for service providers; their primary needs are to get to market fast and cost-effectively. With this insight, we created a new brand position for the company, revamped their brand identity, and developed a go-to-market strategy."
