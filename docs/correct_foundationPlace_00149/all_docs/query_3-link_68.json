        "text": "Parsippany, NJ (PRWEB) June 08, 2015 -- Dialogic, a global networking software and infrastructure solution provider, announces it will be a sponsor for the upcoming TADHack Global, June 13-14th. TADHack is a grass roots initiative focused on building a software-centric telecom application developer ecosystem. The TADHack Global Hackathon has nearly 1,000 registered participants and will run concurrently across multiple locations all around the world, including Dialogic hosting the London site. “TADHack is a grassroots event, created by the people working at the bleeding-edge of telecoms innovation. We thank Dialogic for hosting the London site.” said Alan Quayle, TADHack founder and organizer.\n\nThe Dialogic® PowerMedia™ XMS platform allows for traditional telecom and web developers to go beyond the typical peer-to-peer call flow by providing a rich-media processing development platform and media server to create exciting SIP, WebRTC, HD voice and video applications and value added services. “We were blown away by the hacks submitted as part of the April TADHack-Mini and we’re looking to build on that” said Vince Puglia, Developer Advocate at Dialogic.\n\nIn addition, Dialogic is excited to announce the extension of an existing relationship with Telestax for providing media server functionality to the popular open source RestComm platform. Restcomm is a next generation Cloud Communications Platform to rapidly build voice, text messaging, and now video applications, using mainstream web and mobile development skills. “We are so excited that developers can now create rich multi-party video experiences in mobile and web apps that includes WebRTC, thanks to the power of PowerMedia XMS integrated to RestComm” said Jean Deruelle, Co-Founder at TeleStax, Inc. “This opens up a whole new world for a breed of applications ranging from customer care, gaming, healthcare, and insurance. The sky is the limit”.\n\nAbout Dialogic:\n\nDialogic, the Network Fuel® company, inspires the world’s leading service providers and application developers to elevate the performance of media-rich communications across the most advanced networks.
