After this workshop, you will feel empowered and you will be equipped with the tools necessary to make a difference in your own community.\n\nMaricruz Carrillo, PhD., es tu amiga in Sustainability. She founded the consulting side of Menos Waste on 4 pillars: Environmental, Social, Financial and Cultural. Sustainability is not just about being \"Eco-friendly\" which is why she wanted to make sure all other aspects were holistically taken into consideration in all projects. She focuses on small businesses and non-profits as she believes community engagement and localization of economies are key in building a sustainable future. Her passion to help small businesses and non-profits (who are traditionally not represented in this space) break into the sustainability market leads her to provide affordable workshops, resources and services. No client will be turned away for lack of resources and group based learning is also available (and super fun). Overall, Maricruz hopes to make the sustainability space more equitable, accessible y divertido!\n\nThis workshop is featured in the Equity-focused Dialogic Skills series of workshops organized in collaboration with CIRES. Dr. Carrillo will be joining us virtually.\n\nWORKSHOP\n\nBuilding Skills to Successfully Navigate Equity-Focused Dialogues (Session 1)\n\nTuesday, March 5, 2:30 - 3:45 p.m.\n\nTwo options to attend, in-person or online:\n\nIn person at Center for Teaching and Learning Office (Room E390), CASE Building on CU Campus\n\nOnline: Zoom link\n\nIn this highly interactive workshop, participants will explore ideas and themes from the two seminars that address how power dynamics affect equity-focused dialogues.
