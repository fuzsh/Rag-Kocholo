The global team of professional services experts at Dialogic is ready to help the customers with unparalleled support and consulting so that they can get the most out of their network investment.\n\nDialogic’s ‘Beneficence’\n\nDialogic provides real time communications software, infrastructure, communications applications, enabling technology for their partners who are Service Providers, Enterprises, Telco Manufacturers, and Application Developers. Dialogic continues to innovate as they are also integrating AI, IoT, and RTC from silos into solution sets.\n\nDialogic’s pioneering technology, coupled with the power of its open systems approach to product development, has made it a catalyst for its customers and partners to innovate as they deploy networks and develop revolutionary communications applications. Here are some of the ‘beneficence’ for clients:\n\nApplication Development and Delivery\n\nClients can build their next communications application with Dialogic. It delivers both custom and pre-packaged applications, and offer solutions and services to securely and cost-effectively deploy clients next application.\n\nRich Multimedia Applications\n\nDialogic is number one in the industry when it comes to software-based media processing solutions. The voice and video solutions offered by them can bring agility and flexibility to clients’ network.\n\nSeamless Connectivity\n\nWith Dialogic service provider infrastructure solutions for IMS/VoLTE and NGN networks, increase connectivity between mobile, fixed, next gen, and Over-the-Top players in an ecosystem that was not possible with legacy TDM and GRX networks.\n\nProfessional Services and Support\n\nDialogic Pro Services provides turnkey planning, deployment, optimization, and management of your network with a 24×7 global team of technical and operational experts.\n\nDriving Power of Dialogic\n\nBill Crank, President and CEO of Dialogic, has been with it since late 2012. Bill has a wide range of experience from running global sales in large companies to running smaller start-up companies. He understands both the enterprise and service provider customer base very well.\n\nBill has also held executive management roles as President of Wireless Systems Consulting (acquired by BCI), Executive Vice President of CI Wireless (acquired by EMS Wireless), Vice President Sales & Marketing of Ortel – Wireless Systems Division (acquired by Lucent), and senior leadership roles of increasing responsibility at Allen Telecom Group and Motorola where he started his career. Bill has a BBA in Marketing from Western Connecticut State University and an Engineering background from Motorola’s Fast Leadership Track Program.\n\nAn evolution that Reformed a Revolution\n\nDialogic has evolved quite a bit in its 35 years. It started as a company enabling application developers to build innovative applications for enterprises and service providers by providing network interface, signaling, and media processing technology. Some of these applications were IVRs, auto attendant, color ring back tones, prepay top off, and location based services. As the industry evolved,\n\nDialogic recently entered the applications business, specifically the Unified Communications area. One of the reasons it did this was, customers asked them to offer full solutions beyond voice and video media processing. With their long legacy of delivering mission critical real time communications, they know the UC space, so it was natural to offer a UC solution that can be easily customized to service provider requirements. These decisions are paying off as this is Dialogic’s fastest growing business in both 2016 and 2017.\n\n“At Dialogic we were trying to break the mold by delivering solutions that partners could customize and deliver new and innovative solutions to customers faster and more economically,” says Bill.\n\nMotivated by the Clients for the Clients\n\nFor Dialogic, customers are the top most priority. That is why Dialogic always listen to the customers to see where they are going and what they need, so the company can meet customer needs for many more years. Bill adds, “From the perspective of applications, our customers have been asking us for a full applications solution, and so we delivered.”\n\nBeing a global organization, Dialogic takes its team as its best asset. “Being a global organization allows us to gain valuable insight into where the market is going, and this has enabled us to be the first to offer innovative solutions such as one of the first visual IVRs on the market, video texting before anyone heard of Twitter, and the first media server to support WebRTC. The people, of course, first spot the need for these innovative solutions, and then make them happen to drive value for Dialogic,” asserts Bill.\n\nEvolution of UC Will be followed by Evolution of More Services by Dialogic\n\nUC is a term that means a lot of things. Unified Communications at its most basic level is voice, email, and presence/IM capability in an application. But UC can also mean voice conferencing, video conferencing, text messaging, collaboration/document sharing, and fax.\n\nIn the near future, UC will evolve and become more customizable and specialized to the needs of the customer. Presently, Dialogic is seeing video enter the realm of UC beyond simply video conferencing. The company sees the future of UC as it will also need to integrate with IoT and AI. In the future, Dialogic will be very active in the communications applications and UC arena. As it is a growing global business for them.\n\nSource :- The 10 Fastest Growing Unified Communication Solution Providers 2017"
