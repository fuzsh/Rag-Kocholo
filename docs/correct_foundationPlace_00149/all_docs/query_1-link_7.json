        "text": "PARSIPPANY, N.J., July 23, 2019 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Dialogic, a cloud-optimized applications and infrastructure solutions provider for global service providers, enterprises, and developers, announced today that UNIFI Communications, a leading US-based international telecommunications carrier, has chosen the Dialogic® ControlSwitch™ System as the foundation for virtualizing and revamping of its UNIFI/WIS Global Network.\n\nUNIFI/WIS prides itself on providing high quality and scalable solutions to mobile operators and global carriers; and to maintain this high standard while increasing functionality, UNIFI/WIS made the decision to replace its aging NGN platform. Of high importance was a solution that could provide management of TDM and SIP traffic and central management of global SIP routing for its UNIFI/WIS Global Network. Also key was the ability to integrate a long list of functions, such as high availability and geo redundancy, quality monitoring, call barring, performance monitoring, and fraud management, which were currently being accomplished using disparate systems from a variety of vendors. And lastly, there was the need to execute these feature demands in a single, cost-effective, scalable solution.\n\n\"As we looked to upgrade and virtualize our NGN platform, it was important that we maintain our goal for UNIFI/WIS to be the most flexible and efficient value enabler for our customers,\" stated Adrian Shatku, UNIFI's founder and CEO. \"After reviewing all the other vendors' options, we felt the Dialogic ControlSwitch System met our long list of demands and will be able to replace multiple systems from multiple vendors. We look forward to implementing the ControlSwitch into our UNIFI/WIS Global Network as we grandfather the existing systems, including our Huawei TDM infrastructure.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to have been selected by UNIFI/WIS to provide the virtual core functionality for the UNIFI/WIS Global Network,\" added Bill Crank, President & CEO of Dialogic. \"We also look forward to expanding our relationship with UNIFI/WIS as they not only explore offering Platform as a Service (PaaS) capabilities, but also look to deploy the Dialogic BUZZ™ Unified Communications platform, which combines Dialogic's real-time communications leadership, and application development with AI/IoT proficiency, into a single business communications solution.\"\n\nFor more information visit the Dialogic ControlSwitch System, visit the Dialogic website at https://www.dialogic.com/controlswitch-system, and for more information on Dialogic BUZZ, visit https://www.dialogic.com/buzz.\n\nAbout Dialogic\n\nDialogic is a leading cloud-optimized solutions provider for real-time communications media, applications, and infrastructure to service providers, enterprises, and developers around the globe.
