Read the blog Intersecting Real-Time Communications with IBM Watson Artificial Intelligence for more details.\n\nFor more information on IBM Voice Gateway, read the white paper IBM Voice Gateway: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence Engagement Effectively for Business and Operational Gain\n\nIBM Websphere Liberty\n\nIBM debuted their WebRTC capabilities with Websphere Liberty at IBM Interconnect 2016. WebSphere Liberty is a fast and easy-to-use application server, based on a mix of IBM and open-source software. When used with Dialogic’s PowerMedia XMS, WebSphere Liberty creates the foundation for multi-media enterprise WebRTC applications.\n\nRead the blog from the show for more info.\n\nListen to the podcast from IBM Senior Technical Staff Member, Brian Pulito, to learn how Watson can be integrated into telephony applications.\n\nIBM Cognitive Customer Experience Application based on PowerMedia XMS\n\nDialogic was featured in IBM’s Cognitive Agent demonstrations titled “So You Want to Talk To Watson? Just Give It A Call” at IBM World of Watson 2016. The demonstration showed how financial service companies can leverage IBM Watson's real-time voice interface to replace aging interactive voice response (IVR) systems with self-service cognitive agents, or provide live agents with real-time voice analytics to better service their customers. Dialogic PowerMedia XMS enables the demonstration by facilitating a live-agent WebRTC session, providing an interface between the WebRTC session and IBM’s Watson Speech-to-Text engine, performing conversion of voice codecs in real-time (also known as transcoding). Read the press release for more detail.\n\nIBM Watson\n\nThis video shows the ease in integrating IBM Watson’s Speech-to-text services in building a WebRTC gateway using PowerMedia XMS.\n\nHow to build a WebRTC Gateway and integrate IBM Watson Speech-to-Text services Video"
