        "text": "Inter-organizational learning: a theoretical framework\n\n“IOL refers to networks of relationships forged by entities that operate to accomplish a shared objective” (Sienkiewicz-Małyjurek et al., 2019, p. 274). In IOL, common knowledge generation relies on knowledge integration from different organizations and the heritage base of a given organization (Sienkiewicz-Małyjurek et al., 2019). IOL creates opportunities and outcomes that individual organizations cannot leverage and achieve by themselves (Bruneel et al., 2010; Peronard and Brix, 2019). That is, IOL may lead to new, unexpected solutions through the combination of diversified competencies and knowledge. However, IOL underlines critical challenges for organizations, including changing the way things are usually done, developing an overall organizational culture, where employees and groups are made aware of the connections between familiar and new, and encouraging open and constant discussion (Lucas, 2010).\n\nThus, IOL is a multilevel contextual process. It starts with individual practitioners sharing experiences, information, successes and failures, subsequently leading to team learning and ending in organizational learning (Rupčić, 2021). The process could also work in reverse. Specifically, inter-organizational knowledge exchange first stimulates individual and team learning, providing an opportunity for IOL if knowledge is later successfully transferred into organizational routines and practices (Rupčić, 2021). Consequently, IOL could be slower than organizational learning or IOL because it requires both content and process adjustments, involves various kinds of entities (with different strategic orientations and aims) and entails a conscious re-thinking and validation of organizational behaviors, competencies, norms and values (Liu et al., 2021; Lucas, 2010; Sienkiewicz-Małyjurek et al., 2019). In addition, not all parties involved in this process may share the same interest and motivation, contributing to making it even slower and weaker (Rupčić, 2021). In other words, the learning process (including transfer and reuse) in inter-organizational projects should not be taken for granted because the involvement of multiple organizations may imply the effort to deal with different kinds of issues: incongruent goals, overlapping areas of responsibility, forms of tacit knowledge, unequal expertise levels and different organizational cultures shaping professionals’ behavior and work representations (Ajmal and Helo, 2010; Jones and Lichtenstein, 2008; Liu et al., 2021). Therefore, the key challenge for IOL is to establish a coordinated, shared and safe space, where organizations and professionals could build a common ground to maintain commitment and a high degree of absorptive capacity (Zahra and George, 2002), transparency (the degree to which an organization is cooperative and discloses knowledge) and overall trust (Eiriz et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2020; Peronard and Brix, 2019; Rupčić, 2021). Inter-organizational sharing and creation of knowledge require the joint management of several aspects (Eiriz et al., 2017) that can be clustered as follows: formal and informal balanced contacts, fluid communication and information exchange, sharing of resources, joint development and participation in managerial processes and decisions and alignment between organizational cultures. According to Anand et al. (2020), these elements represent strategic dimensions that need to be considered to initiate and manage IOL processes.\n\nFor all these reasons, DE can represent a valid methodological approach to support IOL processes.\n\nParticularities of dialogic evaluation\n\nThe evaluation may be defined as the systematic collection of information to understand the efficiency, effectiveness and impact of various actions, including multi-stakeholders interventions in the field of health, education, psychology or organizational development (Engelhardt, 2019). The evaluation process generally entails some key methodological steps (Dallago et al., 2004):\n\nthe planning of the evaluation design (definition of the evaluation objectives, indicators and tools);\n\nthe implementation of evaluation design; and\n\nthe usage of the evaluation results for program improvement.\n\nThe implementation of such steps varies according to the diverse evaluation paradigms guiding the researchers. In some cases, researchers adopt a realistic paradigm. Within this orientation, evaluation is seen as a tool to measure the objective variations of specific benchmarks through the experimental design (Dallago et al., 2004).\n\nIn other cases, the researcher can adopt a constructivist approach. Within this paradigm, the concept of “objectivity” lies in the context and is relevant to the evaluation design. This second orientation defines evaluation as a tool to explore the results of a program based on the agreement between diverse stakeholders (Green, 1997, 2001). This implies sustaining intersubjectivity in the construction of the evaluation data. Constructionism is based on the assumption that the meanings related to an object are not only individually internalized – and thus a result of a subjective internal process – but also the product of social exchange. Objects, ideas and representations are, thus, always intersubjectively determined. Applying the constructivist paradigm in research implies involving research participants in the research process by capturing their individual signification around a research object and activating a communal creation of the meaning (Gergen, 1994). Inter-subjectivity also puts the researchers in the position of creating the texture and fabric of the shared meaning; they are not neutral as wanted by the realist paradigm, but they are involved in meaning structuring (Gergen, 1994).\n\nDialogic evaluation (DE) falls into this second approach and promotes actions of planning, implementation and interpretation of the evaluation design in close dialogue with the actors of the evaluation context. Because DE implies a co-construction of the research/evaluation design in dialogue with the context (Cousins and Chouinard, 2012; Diaz-Puente et al., 2008; Spaaij et al., 2018), DE may also be categorized as a specific form of participatory evaluation.\n\nDespite several commonalities with “participatory approaches,” DE comprises nuanced differences. The main one is that DE stresses the relevance of dialogue as a source of knowledge building at a methodological and epistemological level. While in participatory evaluation (Cousins and Chouinard, 2012), the relational dimensions related to the creation of a balance between the researcher and the stakeholder in the evaluation process are strongly emphasized, DE finds dialogue the key tool for promoting a participatory approach to evaluation (Green, 1997, 2001). Dialogue is conceived as the main resource to construct new meanings with others.\n\nDialogue indeed permeates all the phases of the evaluation process, from the planning of evaluation objectives and indicators to the discussion and interpretation of results.\n\nIn conclusion, the peculiarity of the methodology lies in the usage of dialogue within the evaluation process as an activator of sense-making, intersubjectivity and socialization (Greene, 2001, 2003).\n\nDE is generally in charge of an evaluation staff of researchers who apply the methodology in synergy with diverse actors implied in the program/action under evaluation (founders, beneficiaries and workers). However, it may also be implemented independently by organizational managers who want to apply a participatory methodology for internal evaluation. Within this paper, we will focus on DE as a specific form of participatory evaluation that researchers can apply within diverse contexts, and we will show how it sustains certain outcomes of IOL.\n\nSeveral studies have reported various advantages related to participatory approaches, including DE, such as strengthened validity of evaluation findings and conclusions (Alpert and Bechar, 2007) better usage of the evaluation findings on behalf of stakeholders (King, 1988) and social justice and social betterment effects at a community level (Cousins and Chouinard, 2012).\n\nThe implications of participatory methodologies, such as DE, in evaluation also affect participants and organizations during the evaluation process. Cousins and Chouinard (2012) defined these effects as “process use.” Process use is reflected in changes at the individual (actions or behavior, attitude or affect) and organizational levels, including organizational learning (Amo and Cousins, 2007).\n\nThis leads to the assumption that participatory methodology may sustain IOL processes. Participation, reflexivity and power shifts (Spaaij et al., 2018) are consistent elements characterizing this approach. These components may reasonably improve task commitment, re-definition of organizational roles and boundaries and formation of new relational dynamics and networks, as well as knowledge and competencies sharing (Liu et al., 2021; Figure 1)\n\nComparative case studies\n\nA case study is an intensive investigation of a single case to shed light on a larger class of cases (George and Bennet, 2005). It is generally used to observe a phenomenon in its natural setting, especially when the borders between the context and the phenomenon remain undefined (Hodge and Sharp, 2016). Specifically, the researchers aimed to explore the relationship between IOL and DE and the possible connection between these two processes, as studies in this field remain limited. For this study, we decided to compare two cases in SDP in terms of IOL. Case 1 was implemented from 2016 to 2017 in a suburban district of Milan and a town of the Milan Province. It involved three entities: our university, a grassroots sports society and a social cooperative. Case 2 was implemented in two cities in the province of Milan and a suburban district of Milan. It lasted from 2014 to 2016, and its partnership involved: our university, three grassroots sports societies of Milan and province, a social cooperative and a private foundation. These cases were selected based on the “crucial cases” criteria (George and Bennet, 2005). A crucial case is defined as a particular case that fits the theoretical assumptions the researcher is interested in exploring (in this work, DE sustaining IOL).\n\nOn the contrary, the researcher picked up deviant cases because they refute a certain theoretical hypothesis. Several peculiarities make these cases crucial (George and Bennet, 2005) for studying IOL in the context of DE. First, both cases were based on positive youth development through sport principles (Holt et al., 2017) and aimed to develop a positive motivational climate within the micro-sport environment, leading to the promotion of individuals’ sense of acceptance and perception of inclusion, promote positive communication within the micro-sport environment, strengthening participants’ self-efficacy in sport, provide youths with individual psychological counseling for overcoming individual challenges during sports training and develop capacity building within the partnership, serving youth inclusion. Specifically, this final goal focused on developing skills and new learnings for the partnership involved was interesting in terms of IOL development. Second, in both cases, our university was involved in evaluating and monitoring the projects’ effects through DE. Consequently, we had the opportunity to reflect on how this methodology could create the conditions for IOL promotion. Moreover, a three-phase DE procedure (Table 1) was applied in both cases.\n\nThis condition facilitated the comparison of the cases and made it possible to highlight similarities and differences in terms of IOL outcomes promoted by the DE design. Therefore, it explored the connections between the phases of DE and the crucial preconditions for IOL to occur. Finally, both the initiatives were inter-sectorial actions implemented through partnerships between several organizations, particularly sport and non-profit social organizations. Intersectoral actions may be described as formal partnerships of diverse organizations or people with different backgrounds that cooperate to reach a common target (Corbin et al., 2016). In these cases, achieving the partnership goal required the presence of an intermediate workgroup composed of multiple professionals (sports coaches, educators and psychologists) belonging to different sectors and disciplines (Lindsey and Bitugu, 2019).\n\nData analysis\n\nThe present case study was based on the integrative explorative approach, which requires a constant dialogue between the reference theory of IOL (Brix, 2021; Eiriz et al., 2017; Klein et al., 2020), the collected material and the researcher’s interpretation (Maaløe, 2004).\n\nResearchers’ diaries and evaluation reports that have been structured at the time of both cases study implementation formed the basis of our data (2016–2017 for Case study 1; 2014–2016 for case study 2). These materials were a crucial source of information that made it possible to retrospectively reflect on how DE guided IOL. Indeed, these data sources captured the key events and relational dynamics that occurred during and following our evaluation. Table 2 shows the material analyzed for the two cases.\n\nChiara Corvino and Chiara D’Angelo were involved in data collection for the case studies, while Diletta Gazzaroli supported helped analyze the material for the current study. Materials were examined separately based on two key elements. On the one hand, we evaluated the DE process implemented within the two cases and identified which aspect of the DE process could reflect certain conditions for IOL achievements. We specifically focused on Eiriz and colleagues’ (2017) contribution concerning the centrality of sharing common actions across organizations to promote IOL (see the previous section). We specifically considered whether and how DE could create a fruitful context to promote sharing among diverse organizations and, consequently, lead to IOL.\n\nFurthermore, for each case, we analyzed the specific IOL promoted by the DE process in terms of common knowledge developed, new innovative solutions created and transfer and use of useful lessons (Brix, 2021; Klein et al., 2020). The two cases were then triangulated to highlight similarities and differences in terms of IOL development.\n\nDialogic evaluation Phase 1 – development of shared meanings and representations of the partnership scope\n\nFor both cases, the DE first phase, characterized by an exchange of points of view regarding the shared goals of the partnership, was crucial in bringing out the different organizational peculiarities. This action made it possible to highlight the different positions of the organizations involved in addressing the inter-organizational macro-objective; specifically, the development of social inclusion through sport and the specific modalities through which to reach the partnership’s goal. From a procedural perspective, the researchers’ role was to conduct a series of meetings to guide partners in discussing three key questions: What does sport mean? What does it mean to promote social inclusion? What does it mean to promote social inclusion through sport?\n\nResearchers’ diaries and evaluation reports reported that these questions allowed deep organizational diversity to emerge and accelerate negotiation and alignment between organizational cultures to guarantee shared values and beliefs.\n\nIn Case 1, researchers’ diaries described two levels of diversity that emerged. On the one hand, diverse meanings of social inclusion through sport were reported. The sports staff involved reported that inclusion involved mainly the sports team, whereas social workers described that inclusion should necessarily result in a broader inclusive process within the community. Phase 1 made it possible to discuss these representations. Eventually, within a supportive dialogic process, both sport and social workers converged into a more complex and richer definition of inclusion through sport that incorporated both their perspectives. Specifically, the group concluded that youth needs to first have a good experience on the sports team to be included in the larger community. The sports team was reported as a preparatory environment where youth learn, experiment and acquire social skills that need to be transferred to the larger community. Within this new perspective, social inclusion through sport was described as a ladder where the micro sports environment represents the first step, and the community and the society constituted the last step. This allowed broadening the representational horizons of the actors involved in promoting social inclusion through sport.\n\nThen, the second level of diversity emerged regarding the stakeholders’ implicit expectations for the projects and their understanding of the general aims of the project. In particular, the sports society board wanted to use the project as a lever to strengthen its presence in the territory and increase the number of its members. Specifically, the president of the sports society aimed to recruit new members through the project. This initial instrumental component caused friction within the partnership. Therefore, the cooperative’s professionals were reluctant to discuss any instrumental components related to the project and struggled to accept this sports society’s positioning. Despite this struggle, the DE process allowed mutual (and divergent) expectations to emerge before the start of the project and consequently to create the conditions needed to make them unambiguous (engaging partners in a common project aim).\n\nIn Case 2, the initial evaluation report described diverse representations of social inclusion attainment. Specifically, two contrasting representations emerged from the funding foundation and the social cooperative involved. The foundation followed a standardized, fast and technocratic approach (that could be more easily accounted for), whereas the social cooperative reported the need to build customized and progressive work processes based on youth-specific needs and strong synergy with the wider community.\n\nEventually, the foundation and the social cooperative converged into structured monitoring forms. This tool, which the foundation strongly desired, was structured to monitor the specific progress of each participant from an individualized perspective, as sustained by the social cooperative.\n\nIn terms of IOL, DE guided professionals to co-create a new and innovative approach for monitoring social inclusion through sport (e.g. monitoring sheet).\n\nIn conclusion, the two cases illustrate how the promotion of dialogue in the initial evaluation design phase led to building a common knowledge about the partnership’s scope and meanings, which is one of the main aims in terms of IOL outcomes. In Case 2, the reciprocal understanding and knowledge of partners’ organizational cultures promoted the creation of new tools for monitoring social inclusion through sport.\n\nDialogic evaluation Phase 2 – new boundaries, tasks and strategies negotiation\n\nConsistent with the principles of DE (Greene, 2001), partners’ meetings were held monthly to monitor progress, strengths and weaknesses of project implementation. In both cases, only sports coaches from the sports society, educators and psychologists from the social cooperative attended the meetings. Therefore, to support cross-participatory project management, it was necessary to create a delegation of professionals. Monthly meetings allowed constant formal contact between the professionals from different organization, which gradually led to the creation of an informal climate. Consequently, all the involved organizations shared their human resources to progress in the monitoring and evolution of the project.\n\nIn both cases, the diaries of Case 1 and intermediate report of Case 2 reported coaches’ dilemma about sport and inclusion. At the very start of both projects’ implementation, it is described that the youth involved were not prepared to face coaches’ initial structured training proposal; they weren’t physically equipped to perform the training. This made coaches feel frustrated with the project because they originally expected the training approach to be the same as that of their grassroots sport’s society. Coaches were thus forced to adapt the sports activity to fit the specific youths’ sports skills. This required modifying the activities and structuring sessions to focus more on games and fun rather than sport. The educators and the psychologist spontaneously supported this process during the meetings by inviting sports coaches to define new possible ways to manage the training. In both cases, the dialogue with educators and the psychologist encouraged coaches to reflect on their expectations and redefine their behaviors and activities on the field. Consequently, they rebuilt and maintained their commitment. In both cases, monthly meetings constituted an opportunity to reconstruct sports coaches’ engagement and find new training strategies centered more on games than on sports skills development.\n\nMoreover, the monitoring meetings made it possible to retrospectively reflect on the new co-created strategies to face certain challenges with the youth. For instance, in Case 1, diaries reported that the group realized the importance of using “the circle” to calm youth after a conflict. The cases show that dialogue and reflection (promoted within monitoring meetings) supported coaches’ re-engagement in the partnership task and, therefore, allowed coaches and educators to find new solutions to promote inclusion through sport (e.g. game-based training), which was one of the main aims in terms of IOL outcomes.\n\nDialogic evaluation phase 3 – awareness of new knowledge acquisition\n\nIn both cases, the evaluation design aimed to explore whether and how the workers involved in the project acquired new competencies to promote social inclusion through sport.\n\nIn Case 1, the evaluation report highlighted that the inter-organizational group developed several new competencies, such as the capacity to create a positive climate among the youth in a very short period, develop leadership skills, manage negative emotions, collaborate in a multi-professional team, share reflections and insights on youth within a multi-professional team, develop self-awareness, and manage complex and conflictual situations involving the youth.\n\nIn Case 2, the final evaluation report highlighted how the coaches, through the continuous exchange with social workers, developed a diverse perspective on the youth and began to interpret their behaviors from a psycho-pedagogical perspective. During the project, the coaches’ language also gradually changed. Indeed, they gradually internalized the terminology and idioms that are more typical in the educational and psychological sphere. The data evaluation further revealed the change in decision-making. At the project’s beginning, sports coaches were strongly hesitant to manage educational decisions regarding the youth, delegating such responsibility to educators. At the end of the project, they showed a greater propensity to dialogue with the youth.\n\nDE Phase 3 offered a great opportunity to discuss such competencies and strengthen the value of the lessons learned through the process. Indeed, Phase 3 included meetings to share data collected by the evaluation staff with the partners to promote dialogue, reflection and data co-interpretation.\n\nProposing a dialogue on data evaluation, including competencies built during the project, made it possible to foster awareness of the common knowledge developed by all professionals, which represents a crucial premise underlying knowledge acquisition transfer."
