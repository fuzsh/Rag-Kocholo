        "text": "Essential Partners has equipped faculty at more than 350 colleges and universities, across humanities, social sciences, and STEM fields, with our Dialogic Classroom pedagogy, helping those educators lead more open, inclusive, civil discussions about controversial topics such as stem cell research, the role of race in American society, Israel-Palestine, and gender identity.\n\nWe call our model the dialogic classroom.\n\nIn first-year lecture classes and Ph.D. seminars, at public universities and private colleges, the benefits have been broad and deep. Research has found that the dialogic classroom:\n\nImproves student learning outcomes\n\nFosters curiosity about the course content\n\nOpens students up to different or conflicting ideas\n\nHelps students refine their own views and values\n\nEncourages more students to participate in class\n\nThe dialogic classroom leads students toward that crucial balance between intellectual humility and personal conviction, open discussion and resilient belonging, which are keys both to academic rigor and the health of a free democratic society.\n\nThe building blocks of a dialogic classroom can be adapted to your course and teaching style, whether you’re teaching in a big lecture hall or a small seminar. These elements are:\n\nConnecting First\n\nBuilding Communication Agreements\n\nPutting Dialogue in the Syllabus\n\nArranging the Space\n\nDesigning Effective Questions\n\nDeploying Reflective Practices\n\nConnecting Dialogue to Content\n\nEvaluation\n\nDepending on the course, you might add an online component to your dialogic classroom, or have your students lead their own dialogue on campus or in the larger community. On this website, you'll find more detailed descriptions of each key building block as well as supporting resources such as videos, exercises, lesson plans, sample syllabi, and handouts.\n\nGet Started: Free Expert Consultation\n\nEvery campus and classroom has its unique challenges. For that reason, we have designed our Dialogic Classroom framework with an emphasis on flexibility and adaptability.\n\nOur program team has collaborated with educators across the country and around the globe, helping them identify the right tools and interventions, sharing resources, and building relationships.\n\nClick here to schedule a free consultation with a member of the EP program team today.\n\nAttend a Training\n\nWant to use dialogue in your classroom? The first step is to bring an Essential Partners training to your campus or attend an EP training.\n\nFaculty who have participated in a dialogic classroom training receive:\n\nHands-on training, customized to meet their unique needs\n\nOngoing support from our expert practitioners and staff\n\nMembership in our online community of practice\n\nOpportunities for continued skill-building, online and in person\n\nFaculty who haven’t participated in an EP training yet can still browse selected exercises, sample syllabi, videos, and other resources from our library. The resources in this section will help you understand the how, when, and why of dialogue in your classroom."
