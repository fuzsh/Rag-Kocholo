The appointment comes on the heels of Dialogic divesting its Converged Communication Division (CCD) hardware business in January to become a software product company.\n\nDialogic has been one the industry's true innovators in delivering mission-critical, real-time communications solutions for over 30 years to service providers, enterprises, and application developers. The divestiture of the CCD hardware business begins the next phase for Dialogic as a software company, allowing it to reap financial advantages from a margins perspective while being poised for growth by leveraging its rich history of successful delivery and innovation.\n\n\"It has been a big part of my vision and strategy since I arrived at Dialogic to take its extensive intellectual property and make it a software company. I am very proud to say that Dialogic has achieved that milestone,\" said Bill Crank, President and CEO of Dialogic. \"I am also very pleased to bring Mike into Dialogic at this time to continue to grow our business. Dialogic's excellent products and services, combined with Mike's extensive track record of significantly growing revenue, make both the timing and match perfect.\"\n\nDialogic has software solutions for real-time communications that encompass applications, application integration middleware, application enablement, media processing, SBCs, signaling, and switching. Dialogic's product offerings are now software, virtualized, and can be cloud-based (public or private).\n\n\"I am genuinely excited to be joining Dialogic at this time. The company has great products with a demonstrated history of success. Now that Dialogic is a software company, the opportunities for growth and upside are tremendous,\" said Mike Ward, EVP Global Field Operations of Dialogic. \"The strategy and vision that Bill has driven, the team that has been assembled globally, and the support from an established and industry-experienced Board of Directors are all compelling reasons why this is the perfect time for me to join Dialogic. I am very excited to help drive the future success of the Company.\"\n\nMike Ward is a global sales executive who has consistently achieved growth at well-known industry companies, such as Vice President Sales at Ascend Communications (acquired by Lucent), SVP Global Sales at Paradyne (acquired by Zhone), SVP Worldwide Sales at Metaswitch, and SVP Worldwide Sales at Edgewater Networks.
