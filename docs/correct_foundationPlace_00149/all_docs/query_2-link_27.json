        "text": "Dialogic telephony cards was a line of PC expansion cards developed in the 1990s by Dialogic Inc., at the time Media & Signaling Division of Intel Corporation, for computer telephony applications. The cards are currently produced today by Sangoma Technologies Corporation.[1]\n\nThe cards were available in ISA, VME, PCI and PCIe bus versions, and were used in PC-based proprietary software solutions for automated telephone systems running on the Wintel platform, including Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP, NT Server/Server 2000/Server 2003, as well as Solaris and Linux.\n\nThe cards were produced in analog phone (2 to 24-port RJ-11) and digital ISDN (T1 up to 96 channels, or E1 up to 120 channels, 1 to 4 port RJ-48C or BNC) line configurations depending on usage.\n\nThe cards contain up to 18 Motorola 56002, Motorola 56321, or Freescale 56303 DSPs and an Intel 960, Intel 486 or ARMv7 host processor. The cards can handle multiple phone calls simultaneously and route them to the intended point of service. There were several versions that could handle from 24 to 192 voice/conferencing channels on digital ISDN interfaces and from two to 32 analog ports (phone lines).[2]\n\nThe Dialogic cards are capable of making and answering calls, identifying caller ID, playing back sounds to the caller and recording sounds from the line, and detecting Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals (touch tones) dialed by the caller. They can also tear down a call and detect when the caller has hung up.[3]\n\nMultiple cards can be connected together for increased processing capabilities using proprietary CTBus connector.\n\nCisco Systems uses these cards in its Unity product line.[4]\n\nDialogic System Release 6, proprietary software developed by Dialogic Inc., provided predictive dialing, conferencing and interactive voice response (IVR) services which take calls from clients or customers and route the callers to the appropriate individual or data system. The software was used for automated answering services in AT&T, PG&E, Bank of America and other large corporations. Although often complicated and difficult to navigate, these systems allowed corporations to streamline their telephone service and provide information to customers without the need for human interaction.\n\n2 and 4-port analog, ISA\n\nProline/2V\n\nD/21D\n\nDialog/4\n\nD/41D\n\nD/41H\n\n16 and 24-port analog, ISA\n\nD/160SC\n\nMSI/240SC\n\nDigital T1/E1, ISA\n\nD/240SC-T1\n\nD/480SC-2T1\n\n4, 8, 12 and 16-port analog, PCI/PCIe\n\nD/4PCI\n\nD/4PCI\n\nD/41E-PCI\n\nD/41JCT\n\nD/42JCT\n\nD/82JCT\n\nD/120JCT\n\nMSI/80PCI\n\nMSI/160PCI\n\n4-port analog fax, PCI\n\nVFX/41JCT\n\nVFX/PCI\n\nVFX/40ESC\n\n12, 24 and 32-port analog, PCI/PCIe\n\nDI/SI24\n\nDI/SI24\n\nDI/SI32\n\nDigital T1/E1, PCI/PCIe\n\nD/240JCT-T1\n\nD/300PCI-E1\n\nD/480JCT-2T1\n\nDM/V480A-2T1\n\nDM/V480-4T1\n\nD/600JCT-2E1\n\nDM/V600-4E1\n\nDM/V960-4T1\n\nDM/V600BTE\n\nDM/V1200-4E1\n\nDM/V1200BTE\n\nDigital T1 and IP/H.323, PCI\n\nDM/IP481-2T1"
