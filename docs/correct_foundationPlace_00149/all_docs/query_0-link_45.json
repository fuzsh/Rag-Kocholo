        "text": "Mark Brinkman studied graphic design at California State University, Long Beach. Prior to opening MBA Design in 2002, he worked for seven years at internationally recognized Sibley Petite Design.\n\nMark has specialized in brand identity encompassing logos, packaging, environmental graphics, e-media, books, and advertising for corporations, small businesses, and nonprofits in almost every vertical market. He has created and managed brands and sub-brands for Coca-Cola, Nike, The United Nations, ESPN, IBM, Boys and Girls Club, Texas School for the Deaf, and Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. His award-winning work has appeared in all major industry books and publications, including Graphis, Communications Arts, How, Print, Step-By-Step, and I.D. Magazine.\n\nAs his company's model changed to more senior-level associates, the absence of young designers in the studio made him realize that mentorship was just as important a part of his life as design. He now shares his time between teaching, MBA Design, and fly fishing in high-altitude streams for wild trout.\n\nAndréa Caillouet is an artist and graphic designer interested in discovering and fostering creativity wherever possible and in whatever shape or form it may take. As an artist, her work has employed an endless variety of media while continually exploring notions of the self, relationships with others, and the concept of home. As a freelance graphic designer she has had the pleasure of working with many clients who share common interests in the worlds of art and socially oriented non-profits. She has designed work for print, the web, and the built environment. She earned BFA degrees in both Graphic Design and Painting & Drawing from Louisiana State University and holds an MFA in Painting from the University of Texas. To learn more about her work, visit her website at www.andreacaillouet.com\n\nA graduate of Southwest Texas State University, Chris has spent the past 30 years teaching Visual Art at high school-level for San Marcos CISD. She served as a Texas State University Cooperating Teacher for most of those years, mentoring student teachers, block interns, and teachers new to education on her campus.\n\nAs part of an Apple Education Grant-winning team comprised of San Marcos High School teachers, Texas State University professors, and a local community arts activist, Chris connected high school students with art + technology for the first time at San Marcos High School, teaching Graphic Design for 20 years. Other educational opportunities she provided Visual Art students include awarding credit-in-escrow for Austin Community College in Graphic Design, and preparing students for College Board Advanced Placement credits in Art History and Studio Art & Design.\n\nIn addition to supervising student teachers, Chris is active in Texas Art Education Association, having served on the Executive Board, and currently serving as State Director of High School VASE, a competition structure for high school artists that attracts over 35,000 artwork entries across Texas. She continues to serve as a volunteer Visual Arts advocate and exhibition facilitator for SMCISD.\n\nJeffrey Davis (AKA \"Jefe\") is an award-winning designer and design educator, teaching Communication Design in the School of Art and Design at Texas State University-San Marcos since 2000. Prior to joining the faculty Texas State, he worked as the creative director at Judson Design Associates and Senior Designer at Hill Branding in Houston, Texas.\n\nJeff’s focus in teaching and professional practice is in human centered design, design at enterprise scale, and design centered innovation. He has a quarter-century of design experience in international and national corporate marketing and branding for a broad array of Furtune 500 and Fortune 100 clients across four continents including: Ritz-Carlton Residences, JCB Bank—Japan, Cushman Wakefield, Continental Airlines, Pepsi/Frito-Lay, Houston Rockets, Chevron, Exxon, HP, Mitchell Energy, ConocoPhillips, Cooper Industries, Howard Hughes, The Woodlands Development Company, Texas Medical Center and Hines.\n\nThroughout his 25-year career Jeff has continually donated his time and talent for cause-based organizations. He has received international peer recognition for his designs, which have raised international awareness for education, global conflict, environmental issues, cancer, human rights, universal healthcare, and marine preservation.\n\nJeff has been recognized for excellence by leading communication design organizations, publications, and journals, which include: The New York Art Directors Club, Type Directors Club, Communication Arts, Print, How, Good50X70, Logo Lounge, and Graphis Press. He has also served as a board member for AIGA.\n\nHis passion for design and design education is both tempered and fueled by a deep love of the outdoors—mainly surfing and fly fishing. He shares these outdoor adventures with his family — daughters Jess and Elli and three rescue dogs, always under the watchful eye of Shannon, his amazing wife of 15 years.\n\nErina Duganne teaches courses on contemporary art, photography, and visual culture. She is also a contributor to the participatory arts and education project Borderland Collective, with whom she organized the traveling exhibition Northern Triangle. Her research and writing address three interrelated areas: artist activism and solidarity practices; documentary photography and its histories; and race and its representation. She is a co-author of Global Photography: A Critical History and author of The Self in Black and White: Race and Subjectivity in Postwar American Photography. Her editorial work includes the forthcoming anthology Cold War Camera; a special issue of the journal photographies; and the exhibition catalogues Art for the Future: Artists Call and Central American Solidarities and Beautiful Suffering: Photography and the Traffic in Pain. Her writings have also appeared in the journals Latin American and Latinx Visual Culture, The Art Bulletin, Photography & Culture, and English Language Notes. Her co-curated exhibition on Artists Call Against U.S. Intervention in Central America opened at the Tufts University Art Galleries in January 2022 and, in February 2022, she co-chaired the Feminist Art Project’s Day of Panels at the College Art Association’s annual conference on the theme of “Feminist Solidarities and Kinships.” Her current book project, Visual Solidarities: Art, Activism, and Central America, is supported by The Andy Warhol Foundation Arts Writers Grant.\n\nJoey Fauerso is an artist and Associate professor at Texas State University. Her work resides at the intersection between painting, drawing, and performance. Over the last ten years she has been working on a series of paintings, drawings and video that rely on gesture and improvisation to explore themes of nature, gender, family, and humor. The inspiration for the work is rooted in her experiences growing up in a Transcendental Meditation community in Iowa, an ongoing interest in the ways gender is expressed and defined in Western art, and most recently her experiences as a parent and observer of the cognitive and creative processes of children. Recently her work has been included in exhibitions at the Drawing Center in New York, The David Shelton Gallery in Houston, and Antenna Gallery in New Orleans. She lives with her family in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nFor over 20 years Tommy Fitzpatrick has been creating a large and diverse body of work. Beginning with painting architecture as a geometric representation and then beginning to push towards abstraction, his work allows viewers to see the world through his perspective. By continuing to creatively push himself he now creates his subject matter by piecing it together from found materials and painting from these sculptures he created.\n\nBorn in Dallas in 1969, Tommy Fitzpatrick received a B.A. in Fine Art from the University of Texas in Austin in 1991, followed by an M.F.A. from Yale University School of Art in 1993. His work has been included in over 20 solo and numerous group exhibitions in Dallas, Houston, New York, Madrid, London, Berlin and Seoul. He recently finished a commission for the federal reserve bank of Dallas and his work is in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Menil Collection as well as the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth. Fitzpatrick is currently an Associate Professor of painting at Texas State University in San Marcos, Texas. He resides in Austin.\n\nSarah Fox’s multi-media narratives and characters are created from embodied female experience. Stories of life, loss, sex and love are told through archetypical hybrid creatures. The resulting drawings, cyanotypes, and video works suggest a fairytale with an undercurrent of dark symbolism.\n\nHer work has been shown throughout Texas, as well as in the Kinsey Institute (Bloomington, Indiana), Field Projects Gallery (New York, New York), Espacio Dörffi (Lanzarote, Canary Islands), Casa Lu (Mexico City), and Darmstädter Sezession, (Darmstadt, Germany). She has participated in artist residencies throughout the US including The Vermont Studio Center, The Women’s Studio Workshop, Wassiac Projects, and residencies abroad at Casa Lu in Mexico City, Residencia Nautilus in the Canary Islands, Atelierhaus Hilmsen in Hilmsen, Germany and Künstlerhaus Bethanien in Berlin. She received an Individual Artist Grant from the City of San Antonio in 2021.\n\nFox lives and works in San Antonio, Texas. She received a BA in Studio Art from Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas and an MFA from the University of Texas at San Antonio. In addition to teaching at Texas State University, she runs an art and ecology summer camp for young artists in conjunction with the San Antonio River Foundation.\n\nMateo Gutiérrez is a multidisciplinary artist who brings into question the underlying ethos of violence endemic to American history, culture and daily life. In his most recent work Mateo constructs large scale hand-embroidered paintings that tell a story of the traumatic conditions of modern American society through the lens of immigration and mass shootings. He sources his images exclusively from online news sources.\n\nMateo was born in Geneva, Switzerland and raised in Tokyo, Japan before moving to the U.S. at the age of sixteen. In Tokyo, he experienced firsthand a culture struggling between a traditional way of life and the contemporary influences of American globalism. After moving to the United States in his late teens, he struggled with his own conflicted relationship to the US.\n\nHis work is both a sociopolitical and a deeply personal reflection on what it means to be American. Mateo presents a powerful critique of the traumatic effects of the so-called \"American way of life\" and also what it means to be an outsider as both foreign born and Latino. He cites his complex experience with the United States as central to his understanding of American cultural practices that are defined by racial and socioeconomic hierarchies engendering violence. Mateo sources his images online from news stories that he feels best depict a contemporary view of the traumatic effects of the underlying cultural code of violence in American society, stories that themselves make headlines for a short period of time and then are discarded from the cultural discussion, much like the people in the images themselves.\n\nIn his work, Mateo seeks to bring these all too often forgotten tragedies that litter the American landscape back to life, to make us look at them in excruciating detail by meticulously hand-embroidering them in artworks that, contradictory to the minute-by-minute social media news cycle attention span, take many months to make.\n\nMateo has exhibited nationally in galleries in Los Angeles and New York, and multiple museum exhibitions, including the Austin Museum of Art, MexicArte Museum and a solo exhibition at the Brownsville Museum of Fine Art in 2023. Mateo has been featured in New American Painters, Hyperallergic, the Austin American Statesman, The Hartford Courant, Glasstire and other notable journals. Mateo was shortlisted for the NXTHVN residency in New Haven CT and the Field Projects residency in NYC, and was a resident in the Bronx Art Space Governors Island Residency on Governors Island New York City in 2021. Mateo has a BA in philosophy from the University of California at Berkeley and his MFA in studio painting from the University of Texas at Austin. He lives and works in Austin Texas.\n\nDr. Kevin Jenkins is an Assistant Professor of Art Education. He earned his Ph.D. in 2018 at the University of North Texas. His dissertation, titled Dis/appearance, In/visibility and the Transitioning Body on Social Media: A Post-Qualitative & Multimodal Inquiry, earned the 2019 university-wide Toulouse Dissertation Award, in the social sciences division and was nominated for the National Art Education Association 2020 Elliot Eisner Doctoral Research Award in Art Education.\n\nHe is an artivist, vlogger, and educator of trans experience. His research specializations are transgender theory and trans masculinities, contemporary art and visual culture art education, post-qualitative inquiry, teacher preparation, online curriculum design, and emergent technologies. His work has been presented and published nationally and internationally, including in the journals Visual Arts Research, Visual Culture & Gender, the Journal of Social Theory in Art Education, and the International Journal of Education through Art as well as chapters in edited books Pedagogies in the Flesh: Case Studies on the Embodiment of Sociocultural Differences in Education and Women's Caucus Lobby Activism: Feminism(s) + Art.\n\nHe has extensive experience teaching art to underserved populations including 15 years at community colleges in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. In the community college setting, he taught art appreciation, studio art, and art history survey courses and utilized art museums and gallery spaces as \"immersive textbooks\" in his courses. This allowed him to create openings for adult students with diverse backgrounds and limited prior exposure to art find connections and build relationships with the artworks, art-making techniques, artists, and art institutions in their communities and beyond. Prior to joining Texas State, Dr. Jenkins taught undergraduate and graduate courses as a doctoral fellow of art education and from 2019-2021 as a postdoctoral scholar of art education at Penn State University.\n\nDr. Jenkins served as Co-President (2020-2022) of the National Art Education Association Coalition for Feminisms in Art Education (formerly Women's Caucus).\n\nSelect Journal Articles and Book Chapters\n\nJenkins, K.
