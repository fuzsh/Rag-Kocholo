        "text": "1. What is Dialogic and why is it collaboration 2.0?\n\nDialogic is about collaborating with the client, the public and each other to co-create a story. It’s not just about collaborating with creative talent within a virtual agency set-up.\n\nDialogic communications’ philosophy is based on co-creating authentic and integrated stories across multiple media, with audience participation, interaction and collaboration at its core. This is about a more equal status dialogue that requires brands to open up and co-create with the public and not try to control the narrative but to let it develop organically.\n\nUsing a dialogic approach to communications enables collaboration between people and brands. People become part of telling the story and they become invested in it, establishing mutual loyalty and respect on a level playing field.\n\n2. What makes dialogic different to conventional communications?\n\nEvery day, millions of gigabytes of content is created across the world by individuals that is then shared across multiple channels. Potentially anyone with a smartphone now can start a business, brand or a worldwide movement generating more interest, traction and impact than a traditional multi-million-pound advertising campaign.\n\nPeople are now the story-makers, the photographers-in-chief, the service deliverers, the fundraisers, curators and producers of news.\n\nIn a world where people can become brands in their own right, where affinity and trusts in established brands have weakened, traditional methods of communications are losing their impact, reach and effectiveness.\n\nEstablished brands need to ‘PR’ and ‘market’ themselves differently, through creating more dialogue with people and broadcasting at them less.\n\n3. Why would I want to co-create a campaign with Brægen?\n\nWe work with our clients to create a relevant campaign. We can take on every role the client needs from an agency or utilise the in-house teams strengths and skills to involve everyone in the process and really get behind the project.\n\nWe are people who are good at breaking down dense (and potentially boring) subject matter and bring it to life with an innovative campaign. Our campaigns spark conversation, get a bit of a buzz going, get people interested and inspire them to act.\n\nWe co-create concepts that don’t just look good on paper. We work hard to transfer ideas into fully formed concepts that can live online and resonate in the real world. We aim to visibly invent and innovate in a way that makes the message, concept or idea stand out and capture the public’s imagination.\n\nWe enjoy the process of seeing an idea evolve and we share that process with our clients in a way that suits their needs, workload etc.\n\n4. Does Brægen only work with conventional organisations looking to reform their communications approach?\n\nNo – we can work with start-ups, corporate organisations, charities, NGOs, public sector organisations and consumer brands in any sector. The world is changing at a faster pace, bringing with it complexity and unpredictability. The new generation of shared-economy business models – the likes of Uber and Airbnb – is disrupting the old order. Successful organisations are now powered by technology and people, and don’t necessarily need to have a fixed place of business.\n\n6. How does Brægen embrace dialogic within its own business?\n\nWe are a team of co-creators with a proven track record, working together to generate and develop ideas with our clients – and for ourselves. We believe in our ideas and we invest our time in developing our own ideas then pitch them for Crowd-funded investment.\n\nThe crucial test for us is how each idea or piece of campaign communication will truly engage people in order to be effective or impactful. It is no longer sufficient to talk about column inches and media exposure.\n\nWe apply the same rigorous scrutiny to our own ideas, client briefs and business concepts – always asking: so what?\n\nWe don't have job titles, hierarchies, individual specialisms – but we share one thing in common, our love of the industry and creating amazing campaigns to activate and engage people.\n\nWe are open-minded, question everything and challenge assumptions."
