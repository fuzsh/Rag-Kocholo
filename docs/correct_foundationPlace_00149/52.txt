Founded in 1984, EICON was a privately owned designer, developer, and manufacturer of communication products with headquarters in Montreal, Canada.

In October 2006, EICON purchased the Media & Signaling Division of Intel, known as Dialogic, before its merger by Intel in 1999, which produces telephony boards for PC servers. The combined Eicon/Dialogic company changed its name to Dialogic Corporation at the time of the purchase. Today, it is now known as Dialogic Inc.
