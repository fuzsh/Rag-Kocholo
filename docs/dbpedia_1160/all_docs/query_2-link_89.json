        "text": "Script to Screen is delighted to announce the projects and teams selected to take part in Series Bootcamp 2023, a programme created to nurture emerging to mid-career writers and producers as they develop their series concepts.\n\nThe response was outstanding for this year’s Bootcamp, with 79 applications received. Three external selectors went through a rigorous process, ultimately selecting six teams and their projects.\n\nThe six teams will workshop their series concepts with New Zealand, Australian and US advisors who give feedback on the quality, originality and viability of their concept and pilot script. The process runs over two months starting with an intensive two-day workshop with advisor sessions and guest speakers. Teams then have three weeks to work on their projects before re-submitting for an online session with a US script developer. The final step is the opportunity to pitch their projects to industry professionals including commissioners who can take their project into production.\n\nWe thank all the filmmakers who applied.\n\nCongratulations to the teams whose series concepts will be developed at Series Bootcamp 2023:\n\n(pictured left to right)\n\nDing Dong! The Witch Is Dead (Drama/Comedy)\n\nWriter: Jaya Beach-Robertson\n\nWriter & Producer: Roo Reihana-Wilson\n\nProducer: Jazz dos Santos\n\nNan’s Guide to Retirement (Drama/Comedy/Horror)\n\nWriter: Teresa Bass\n\nHello, Stranger (Crime/Drama)\n\nWriter: Ryan Carter\n\nProducer: Olivia Shanks\n\nJamboree (Comedy/Sci Fi)\n\nCreator & Writer: Rosie Howells\n\nWriter & Director: Matasila Freshwater\n\nKarma Samoa (Drama/Comedy)\n\nWriter, Director & Producer: Danny Aumua\n\nProducer: Liz Laupepa\n\nWidow’s Peak (Animated Comedy)\n\nWriter: Alison McLachlan\n\nWriter: René Le Bas\n\nSeries Bootcamp is made possible thanks to funding from NZ on Air.\n\nSeries Bootcamp returns in 2023.\n\nThis development programme has been created to nurture and support emerging to mid-career filmmakers developing a series concept. We’re looking for teams who can present a unique and interesting story, and convince us that their idea is viable for production. Six teams (writers and producers) with outstanding concepts and evidence of talent will be selected for Series Bootcamp 2023.\n\nThe development process will run over two months, during which time the participants will be guided to hone their pitch document and the pilot episode, culminating in a pitching day in June.\n\nSTAGE ONE (4-5 May): Teams attend an intensive two-day story workshop with advisor sessions and guest speakers. Teams then have three weeks to further develop their projects.\n\nSTAGE TWO (26 May): Pitch deck and scripts are re-submitted by the teams in advance of an online session with a script developer who will give feedback on the quality, originality and viability of their developed concept and pilot episode. Teams use the feedback to work on their concept and pilot episode leading up to the pitching day.\n\nSTAGE THREE (26 June): Teams attend pitching day to hear from guest speakers and pitch to industry professionals.\n\nTeams attending Series Bootcamp will come away with a refined series concept, a pilot episode and experience pitching their idea. Participants will have a deepened understanding of how to develop, write and pitch a series.\n\nParticipants who live outside of Auckland will have their travel and accommodation paid for.\n\nWe encourage undiscovered voices to apply.\n\nAPPLICATIONS OPEN NOW: 23 January\n\nAPPLICATIONS CLOSE: 11:59pm, 27 February*\n\nDEVELOPMENT WORKSHOP: 4 – 5 May\n\nRESUBMISSION DATE AHEAD OF ONLINE DEVELOPMENT SESSIONS: 26 May\n\nONLINE SESSIONS: Between 8 – 20 June\n\nPITCH DAY: 26 June\n\n*Those affected by extreme weather events who are unable to meet the deadline, can request an extension. Fill out the form below or call us on 09 3605400.\n\nSeries Bootcamp is made possible thanks to funding from NZ on Air.\n\nCan I submit a Series Concept in any genre?\n\nYes, you can submit a comedy/thriller/crime/horror/sci-fi etc series concept as long as it is scripted.\n\nDo I have to have a producer attached to my project to apply?\n\nNo, but it is important that the series is being developed to pitch to broadcasters, platforms or co-producers experienced at getting series funded and produced. So if one of the writers is also going to pitch the series after Bootcamp, then a producer does not need to be in the team.\n\nCan I be both the writer and the producer?\n\nYes, you can be a producer and writer of your TV series concept as long as you are capable of performing both roles.\n\nDo all team members have to attend in person?\n\nAll key team members must be able to attend the two-day development lab in person in Auckland 4 & 5 May, the online session mid June and the pitch day 26 June.\n\nIf there is a highly experienced producer guiding a new producer (or writer-producer), only the new producer needs to attend the development lab.\n\nHow do I know if my experience level meet eligibility?\n\nWe expect applicants to be on a learning pathway. For this programme, if you think you are emerging or mid-career and that you can learn from Series Bootcamp advisors, then you are eligible. You may choose to address how this programme would develop your career in your biography e.g. you are an experienced writer/director who is stepping into producing; or you are an experienced producer in film/doco/reality TV but not Scripted TV.\n\nCan I apply more than once?\n\nYes, but keep in mind the selectors would have to eliminate one project from the short list should one team member be attached to two projects that are in the shortlist.\n\nScript to Screen is delighted to announce the projects and teams selected to take part in Series Bootcamp 2020, a programme created to nurture emerging and mid-career writers and producers as they develop their series concepts.\n\nThe teams will workshop their series concepts over two stages. At stage one, each team will have an online session with an advisor from the U.S. The two advisors, Laurence Andries (VP of Programming at the Writer’s Guild Foundation, How to Get Away with Murder, Blue Bloods, Six Feet Under) and Jill Goldsmith (Boston Legal, Law & Order, Rizzoli & Isles), will give feedback on how to further develop the concept to appeal to an international audience. The teams will bring that feedback to stage two and attend a two-day intensive workshop to continue to develop their concepts with exceptional local story and producer advisors. Some participants are experienced in other formats so the workshop will also cover the nuances of writing and producing series for the screen.\n\nFor this first Series Bootcamp, Script to Screen received 61 applications. Three external selectors went through a robust process compiling a shortlist of 15 and ultimately selected seven projects to be developed. They said “there was so much evident talent – freshness, originality & skill. We wished there were more places to offer. To have made the shortlist was a real mark of quality, and the selection was passionately argued. Our congratulations to all the chosen teams – the future is bright!”\n\nScript to Screen thanks all the filmmakers who applied.\n\nCongratulations to the teams whose series concepts will be developed at Series Bootcamp 2020:\n\nA Secret History of Violence\n\nWriter: Malinna Liang\n\nProducer: Michelle Ang\n\nPlease Don’t Break Anything\n\nWriters: Donald Mayo, Max Griffin\n\nProducer: Karen Mackenzie\n\nFat Hot Mess\n\nWriter/Producer: Max Currie\n\nFox\n\nWriters: Becs Arahanga, Matasila Freshwater\n\nProducers: Jane Robertson, Desray Armstrong\n\nMother Tongues\n\nWriters/Producers: Julie Zhu, Shreya Gejji\n\nKnow Tomorrow\n\nWriters: Shoshana McCallum, Dan Musgrove, Mikey McCallum\n\nProducer/Director: Peter Salmon\n\nSerenade\n\nCreator/Writer: Ahi Karunaharan\n\nCreator/Producer: Maile Daugherty\n\nSeries Bootcamp is made possible thanks to generous support from the New Zealand Film Commission, US Embassy and the US Arts Envoy.\n\nScript to Screen is proud to present Series Bootcamp, a development lab created to nurture emerging and mid-career writers and producers.\n\nSix writer/producer teams with an outstanding series concept and evidence of talent and ability will be selected to go through a two-stage development process.\n\nAt stage one each team has an online session with a US screenwriter who will give feedback on the quality, originality and viability of the concept.
