Additionally, Mac laptops may be eligible for an extended battery-only repair period for up to 10 years from when the product was last distributed for sale, subject to parts availability.\n\nApple discontinues hardware service for certain technologically-obsolete products. Your product is supported by ongoing OS updates and backed by a network of more than 5,000 Apple-certified repair locations that you can count on if something unexpected happens.\n\n* In some countries and regions, certain service parts may not be available due to local laws or material restrictions.\n\nApple and the environment\n\nApple products are designed to be long-lasting. They are made of durable materials that are heavily-tested in our Reliability Testing Lab. The longer you use your product, the better it is for the planet.
