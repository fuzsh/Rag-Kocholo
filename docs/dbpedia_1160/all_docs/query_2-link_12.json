        "text": "Aired: NBC, 1990-2010\n\nThe son of an advertising executive, Dick Wolf went into the ad business himself before moving into film and television. He wrote on Hill Street Blues and Miami Vice before, well, creating \"the brand.\" The show's success, certainly, has something to do with the simplicity of it structure (cue our narrator), coupled with its New York sensibility and storylines mirroring recent news-making issues and events. Cast members came and went, spinoffs were spun off, but behind all this was an idea, and a style of execution, that seemed ineffable. As TV changed around it, Law & Order remained what it was a mostly straightforward dramatization of a crime, the detectives investigating that crime, and the people in the D.A.'s office who would ultimately prosecute the accused and try to get something like justice in the end."
