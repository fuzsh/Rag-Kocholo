        "text": "The murder of a woman working for the FBI as an informant in an investigation of online pedophiles takes Detective Stabler all the way to the Czech Republic to find a kidnapped girl.\n\n#\n\n81\n\nA bestselling mystery writer is wounded and her accountant gunned down in the street, and the investigation uncovers a possible connection between the crime and a love triangle involving an FBI agent (Tom Berenger) and his wife.\n\n#\n\n218\n\nThe graphic description on the Internet of a pretty coed's murder leads the detectives to the victim's roommate, whose attempted suicide unlocks the secrets of a deadly past.\n\n#\n\n117\n\nWhen Det. Benson's mentor, police sergeant Karen Smythe, is raped while responding to a crime in progress, Benson and Stabler discover that her ex-husband's gambling debts might have had something to do with it.\n\n#\n\n36\n\nA corpse discovered buried in a courtyard with a collar and leash is identified as that of a Romanian immigrant, who came to America as a mail-order bride, and who has a twin sister she may have been impersonating.\n\n#\n\n41\n\nA reporter and his fiancee are gunned down, and Goren and Eames launch an investigation that links the murders to organized crime and uncovers corruption at the highest level of state politics.\n\n#\n\n8\n\nThe attractive editor of an up-and-coming writer is found murdered in the latter's apartment, and the evidence seems to point to the writer's scorned girlfriend.\n\n#\n\n155\n\nThe murder of a \"has-been\" cover girl lead Dets. Briscoe and Curtis to delve into the victim's past -- a past that includes drug addicts, illegitimate children and a lawyer that specializes in blackmail.\n\n#\n\n156\n\nThe carjacking of a vehicle containing vials of a deadly virus lead the detectives on a search for the first person infected with it, \"Patient Zero\". The investigation leads them to a biochemist whose motivations were driven by passion.\n\n#\n\n304\n\nA murder victim who turns out to be an illegal alien with a $100,000 secret bank account leads Briscoe and Green to a hate-mongering website and an ex-Special Forces soldier who has turned vigilante.\n\n#\n\n277\n\nWhen a woman is found bludgeoned into a coma, the prime suspect is a state employee who was the boyfriend of the victim's missing sister.
