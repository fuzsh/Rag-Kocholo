        "text": "Barbara Goldsmith, a founding editor of New York magazine and the author of “Little Gloria … Happy at Last,” a best-selling account of the bitter 1934 custody battle over Gloria Vanderbilt, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.\n\nThe cause was heart failure, family members said.\n\nIn 1974, Ms. Goldsmith was doing research at a law library for a novel about the art world, “The Straw Man,” when she chanced upon four fat volumes labeled “In the Matter of Vanderbilt.” They contained 8,000 pages of court transcripts from the custody case that pitted Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Gloria’s aunt, against the child’s mother, Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt, with a $2.5 million trust fund the glittering prize.\n\nIt was one of the great headline-hogging trials of the age, and Ms. Goldsmith threw herself into the subject with abandon. For the next five years, she pored over the court records and conducted more than 300 interviews in seven countries. The result was a 650-page whopper, published in 1980, full to bursting with scandal, betrayal, extravagance and wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.\n\nThe book, which Newsday called “moth-to-flame reading,” was turned into an NBC mini-series in 1982, with Angela Lansbury, Christopher Plummer and Maureen Stapleton.\n\nMs. Goldsmith went on to write several more well-received books, notably “Other Powers: The Age of Suffrage, Spiritualism and the Scandalous Victoria Woodhull” (1998), about the women’s rights advocate who in 1872 became the first woman to run for president of the United States, and “Obsessive Genius: The Inner World of Marie Curie” (2005).\n\nMs. Goldsmith was born Barbara Joan Lubin on May 18, 1931, in Manhattan and grew up in New Rochelle, N.Y. Her father, Joseph, was a founder of the nationwide accounting firm Eisner & Lubin and a real estate investor. Her mother, the former Evelyn Cronson, was a schoolteacher and, with her husband, a philanthropist.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
