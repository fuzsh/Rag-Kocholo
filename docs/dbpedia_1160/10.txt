24 Episodes 2002 - 2003

Season Thirteen of NBC's blockbuster procedural drama "Law and Order" resumes its chronicles of the NYPD detectives in charge of investigating homicides, and the DA's office that prosecutes those crimes. This season brings back Senior Detective Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach), detective supervisor Anita Van Buren (S. Epatha Merkerson), Detective Ed Green (Jesse L. Martin), Executive ADA Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston), and ADA Serena Southerlyn (Elisabeth RÃ¶hm), while Arthur Branch (Fred Dalton Thompson) replaces Nora Lewin as DA. Cases this season include: a Muslim citizen suspected of a double homicide following an argument with a professor; Briscoe and Green's investigation of a hitman-style killing that leads them to an incredibly unlikely suspect; a pro baseball player suspected of murdering his chauffeur; the demise of a Russian model that may or may not be tied to medical malfeasance; and much more.
