The phenomenological hallmark of such a strong spin-lattice coupling is the manifestation of a large anomaly in the crystal structure at the magnetic transition temperature. Here we report that the magnetic NÃ©el temperature of the multiferroic compound BiFeO(3) is suppressed to around room temperature by heteroepitaxial misfit strain. Remarkably, the ferroelectric state undergoes a first-order transition to another ferroelectric state simultaneously with the magnetic transition temperature. Our findings provide a unique example of a concurrent magnetic and ferroelectric transition at the same temperature among proper ferroelectrics, taking a step toward room temperature magnetoelectric applications.\n\nFerroelectric InMnO{sub 3}: Growth of single crystals, structure and high-temperature phase transitions\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBekheet, Maged F., E-mail: maged.bekheet@ceramics.tu-berlin.de [Fachbereich Materialâ und Geowissenschaften, Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt, Alarich-Weiss-StraÃe 2, 64287 Darmstadt (Germany); Fachgebiet Keramische Werkstoffe / Chair of Advanced Ceramic Materials, Institut fÃ¼r Werkstoffwissenschaften und -technologien, Technische UniversitÃ¤t Berlin, HardenbergstraÃe 40, 10623 Berlin (Germany); Svoboda, Ingrid; Liu, Na [Fachbereich Materialâ und Geowissenschaften, Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt, Alarich-Weiss-StraÃe 2, 64287 Darmstadt (Germany); Bayarjargal, Lkhamsuren [Institut fÃ¼r Geowissenschaften, Goethe-UniversitÃ¤t, AltenhÃ¶ferallee 1, d-60438 Frankfurt a.M.

The smallest demonstrated ferroelectric crystals had a diameter of {approx}200 A and the thinnest ferroelectric films were {approx}200 A thick, macroscopic sizes on an atomic scale. Langmuir-Blodgett deposition of films one monolayer at a time has produced high quality ferroelectric films as thin as 10 A, made from polyvinylidene fluoride and its copolymers. These ultrathin films permitted the ultimate investigation of finite-size effects on the atomic thickness scale. Langmuir-Blodgett films also revealed the fundamental two-dimensional character of ferroelectricity in these materials by demonstrating that there is no so-called critical thickness; films as thin as two monolayers (1 nm) are ferroelectric, with a transition temperature near that of the bulk material. The films exhibit all the main properties of ferroelectricity with a first-order ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition: polarization hysteresis (switching); the jump in spontaneous polarization at the phase transition temperature; thermal hysteresis in the polarization; the increase in the transition temperature with applied field; double hysteresis above the phase transition temperature; and the existence of the ferroelectric critical point. The films also exhibit a new phase transition associated with the two-dimensional layers.

G.; Rowley, S. E.; Scott, J. F.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe emergence of complex and fascinating states of quantum matter in the neighborhood of zero temperature phase transitions suggests that such quantum phenomena should be studied in a variety of settings. Advanced technologies of the future may be fabricated from materials where the cooperative behavior of charge, spin and current can be manipulated at cryogenic temperatures. The progagating lattice dynamics of displacive ferroelectrics make them appealing for the study of quantum critical phenomena that is characterized by both space- and time-dependent quantities. In this key issues article we aim to provide a self-contained overview of ferroelectrics near quantum phase transitions. Unlike most magnetic cases, the ferroelectric quantum critical point can be tuned experimentally to reside at, above or below its upper critical dimension; this feature allows for detailed interplay between experiment and theory using both scaling and self-consistent field models. Empirically the sensitivity of the ferroelectric T câs to external and to chemical pressure gives practical access to a broad range of temperature behavior over several hundreds of Kelvin. Additional degrees of freedom like charge and spin can be added and characterized systematically. Satellite memories, electrocaloric cooling and low-loss phased-array radar are among possible applications of low-temperature ferroelectrics. We end with open questions for future research that include textured polarization states and unusual forms of superconductivity that remain to be understood theoretically.\n\nSpin-driven pyroelectricity in Ni{sub 3}TeO{sub 6} without ferroelectric signatures of the transition at Neel temperature\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nZhao, L.; Komarek, A.C.

The relative permittivity values (23â30 x 103 of Te4+ doped ceramics is more than thrice that of un-doped ceramics (8 x 103 at 1 kHz. A decreasing trend in relative permittivity with increasing temperature (50â300 K is observed for all the samples. Barrettâs formula, as a signature of incipient ferroelectricity, is invoked to rationalize the relative permittivity variation as a function of temperature. A systematic investigation supported by temperature dependent Raman studies reveal a possible ferroelectric transition in Te4+ doped ceramic samples below 120 K. The possible ferroelectric transition is attributed to the interactions between quasi-local vibrations associated with the micro-clusters comprising TiO6 and TeO6 structural units and indirect dipole-dipole interactions of off-center Bâcations (Ti4+ and Te4+ in double perovskite lattice.\n\nModification of phase transitions in swift heavy ion irradiated and MMA-grafted ferroelectric fluoro-polymers\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPetersohn, E.; Betz, N.; Le Moel, A.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nFerroelectric polyvinylidene fluoride (Î²) and copolymers of vinylidene fluoride trifluoroethylene (P(VDF/TrFE)) films were irradiated with swift heavy ions and post irradiation grafted with methyl methacrylate (MMA). We have studied the influence of irradiation parameters such as the ion fluence, the type of ion and the electronic stopping power, on the melting and crystallization temperatures and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions, by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dielectric measurements. The relation between the shift in the transition temperatures and the ion fluence is described by a single term equation. Ion track grafting with MMA affects the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions in P(VDF/TrFE) and leads to a strong amorphization of the polymer films. The grafting in Î² PVDF occurs mainly on the surface of the samples and no change in the transition temperatures is observed.

A quantum thermodynamic treatment gives analytic expressions for the internal energy, the entropy, the specific heat, and the static susceptibility. The calculated thermodynamic characteristics are studied as a function of temperature and energy barrier, where it is shown that at the proper choice of the theory parameters, particularly the energy barrier, the model system exhibits characteristic features of either second-order tricritical or first-order phase transitions. Our results indicate that the barrier energy seems to be an important criterion for the character of the structural phase transition. The influence of quantum fluctuations manifested on zero-point energy on the phase transition and thermodynamic properties is analyzed and discussed. This leads to several quantum effects, including the existence of a saturation regime at low temperatures, where the order parameter saturates giving thermodynamic saturation of the calculated thermodynamic quantities. It is found that both quantum effects and energy barrier magnitude have an important influence on the thermodynamic properties of the ferroelectric materials and on driving the phase transition at low temperatures. Also, the analytical parameters' effect on the transition temperature is discussed, which seems to give a general insight into the structural phase transition and its nature.\n\nAbsence of low temperature phase transitions and enhancement of ferroelectric transition temperature in highly strained BaTiO{sub 3} epitaxial films grown on MgO Substrates\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKumar, Satish; Kumar, Dhirendra; Sathe, V. G., E-mail: vasant@csr.res.in [UGC-DAE Consortium for Scientific Research, University Campus, Khandwa Road, Indore 452001 (India); Kumar, Ravi; Sharma, T. K. [Semiconductor Physics and Devices Lab, Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology, Indore 452013 (India)\n\n2015-04-07\n\nRecently, a large enhancement in the ferroelectric transition temperature of several oxides is reported by growing the respective thin films on appropriate substrates. This phenomenon is correlated with high residual strain in thin films often leading to large increase in the tetragonality of their crystal structure. However, such an enhancement of transition temperature is usually limited to very thin films of â¼10ânm thickness. Here, we report growth of fully strained epitaxial thin films of BaTiO{sub 3} of 400ânm thickness, which are coherently grown on MgO substrates by pulsed laser deposition technique. Conventional high resolution x-ray diffraction and also the reciprocal space map measurements confirm that the film is fully strained with in-plane tensile strain of 5.5% that dramatically increases the tetragonality to 1.05. Raman measurements reveal that the tetragonal to cubic structural phase transition is observed at 583âK, which results in an enhancement of â¼200âK. Furthermore, temperature dependent Raman studies on these films corroborate absence of all the low temperature phase transitions. Numerical calculations based on thermodynamical model predict a value of the transition temperature that is greater than 1500âÂ°C. Our experimental results are therefore in clear deviation from the existing strain dependent phase diagrams.\n\nENDOR-investigations in the environment of the ferroelectric phase transition temperature of Î³-irradiated TSCC\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nWelter, M.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe structure of the CH 3 NHCH 2 COOH radical in the paraelectric phase and during the transition into the ferroelectric phase has been determined by means of ENDOR measurements. The carboxyl group of the radical is a sensitive probe for the study of crystal field changes. Structural differences of the radical between the paraelectric and the ferroelectric phase were attributed to structural changes within the nearest environment\n\nModeling the influence of the seeding layer on the transition behavior of a ferroelectric thin film\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOubelkacem, A.; Essaoudi, I.; Ainane, A.; Saber, M.; Dujardin, F.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe transition properties of a ferroelectric thin film with seeding layers were studied using the effective field theory with a probability distribution technique that accounts for the self-spin correlation functions. The effect of interaction parameters for the seeding layer on the phase diagram was also examined. We calculated the critical temperature and the polarization of the ferroelectric thin film for different seeding layer structures. We found that the seeding layer can greatly increase the Curie temperature and the polarization.\n\nRole of oxygen disorder in the ferroelectric phase transitions for various materials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPasciak, Marek; Goossens, Darren J.; Welberry, Richard T.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nFull text: The nature of ferroelectric phase transitions in many materials have been questioned for many years. Whereas some methods provide definitive evidence of mode softening, other methods, such as local structure probes, indicate the existence of disorder in the paraelectric phase [1]. It is now widely accepted, that the ferroelectric phase transition usually has two components - soft-mode displacive and order-disorder. The latter leads inevitably to some form of pretransitional clusters in the paraelectric phase [2]. In relaxor ferroelectrics, in which disorder drives the transformation, such polar clusters can exist over a wide range of temperatures. Diffuse scattering is a powerful tool for studying such disorder and also for studying short-range order correlations in atomic displacements [3]. In this work we concentrate on the role of oxygens in various materials. By different means of molecular simulations we build models in which the oxygens constitute a framework for short range order correlations. This leads to a discussion of the differences between x-ray and neutron diffuse scattering patterns that may arise due to the disorder of oxygens.\n\nLight refraction in PbMgsub(1/3)Nbsub(2/3)Osub(3) ferroelectric with a diffuse phase transition\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKorshunov, O.Yu.; Markovin, P.A.; Pisarev, R.V.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nIn PbMgsub(1/2)Nbsub(2/3)Osub(3) ferroelectric with a diffuse phase transition refractive indeX variations with temperature are studied for two wavelengths of 0.63 and 0.44 Î¼m in the 140-600 K temperature range, and refractive index dispersion is measured at room temperature. A broad smooth peak of rate of light refraction temperation changes in the 300-310 K range that coincides with the previously observed by other authors on the temperatUre dependence of microwave dielectric permittivity. A refractive properties anomaly is also observed at 156 K that is related with another phase transition at this temperature. Mechanisms of refractive index thermal variations are analyzed and a ferroelectric contribution into light refraction that equals approximately 4x10 -2 at 140 K is found. The contribution remains up to 600 K due to polarization fluctuations. It is shown that within the frames of dispersion theory the effect of ferroelectric ordering on light refraction can be explained by changes of both frequency and effective oscillator force\n\nNeutron and x-ray scattering studies of ferroelectric phase transitions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDolling, G.\n\n1982-08-01\n\nThe subject of ferroelectric type phase transitions is introduced by means of examples of two main classes (a) displacive transitions, e.g. KNbO 3 , and (b) order-disorder transitions, e.g. NaNO 2 . The significance of crystal structure and crystal dynamics (i.e. the phonon dispersion relations) for ferroelectric behaviour is emphasized. The chief methods for structure determination are x-ray and neutron diffraction, while the most powerful of all techniques for studying phonon properties is that of coherent inelastic neutron scattering. The most useful type of neutron spectrometer for phase transition studies, the triple axis crystal spectrometer, is discussed in detail. The history of the soft mode theory of displacive phase transitions, and its application to the antiferroelectric and 'almost ferroelectric' transitions in SrTiO 3 , provides an introduction to more recent developments in this area, including over-damped soft modes, central peaks and critical scattering, incommensurate phase transitions (e.g. K 2 SeO 4 ), amplitudons, phasons and finally solitions. The treatment throughout is descriptive and introductory, designed for graduate students\n\nDisplacement-type ferroelectric transition with magnetic Mn ions in perovskite Sr1-xBaxMnO3\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSakai, Hideaki; Fujioka, Jun; Fukuda, Tatsuo; Okuyama, Daisuke; Hashizume, Daisuke; Kagawa, Fumitaka; Nakao, Hironori; Murakami, Youich; Arima, Takahisa; Baron, Alfred Q. R.; Taguchi, Yasujiro; Tokura, Yoshinori\n\n2012-02-01\n\nAlmost all the proper ferroelectrics with a perovskite structure discovered so far have no d-electrons in the off-center transition metal site, as exemplified by BaTiO3 and Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. This empirical d^0 rule is incompatible with the emergence of magnetism and has significantly restricted the variety of multiferroic materials. In this work, we have discovered a displacement-type ferroelectric transition originating from off-center Mn^4+ ions in antiferromagnetic Mott insulators Sr1-xBaxMnO3. As Ba concentration increases, the perovskite lattice shows the typical soft mode dynamics, and the ferroelectricity shows up for x .45. In addition to the large polarization and high transition temperature comparable to BaTiO3, we demonstrate that the magnetic order suppresses the ferroelectric lattice dilation by Ë70% and increases the soft-phonon energy by Ë50%, indicating gigantic magnetoelectric effects [1].

This necessitated preparing a sample enriched in 114Cd. A subtle, but significant, anisotropy in the thermal expansion of the lattice parameters for CdTi O3 associated with the transition to the polar structure was observed. First-principles calculations are presented to understand energies, phonon dispersion, and structures of possible phases with different symmetries.\n\nRaman scattering study of the ferroelectric phase transition in BaT i2O5\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTsukada, Shinya; Fujii, Yasuhiro; Yoneda, Yasuhiro; Moriwake, Hiroki; Konishi, Ayako; Akishige, Yukikuni\n\n2018-02-01\n\nUniaxial ferroelectric BaT i2O5 with a Curie temperature TC of 743 K was investigated to clarify its paraelectric-ferroelectric phase-transition behavior. The mechanism is discussed on the basis of the structure from short to long ranges determined by synchrotron x-ray diffraction and the lattice dynamics probed by Raman spectroscopy. BaT i2O5 is regarded as a homogeneous system, and the lattice dynamics can be interpreted by the selection rules and tensor properties of the homogeneous structure. Angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy clearly shows that an A -mode-type overdamped phonon plays the key role in the phase transition. Using a combination of experimental results and first-principles calculations, we explain the phase transition as follows: In one of three Ti O6 octahedral units, Ti vibrates along the b axis opposite an oxygen octahedral unit with large damping in the paraelectric phase, whereas this vibration is frozen in the ferroelectric phase, leading to a change in the space group from nonpolar C 2 /m to polar C 2 .\n\nIsothermal phase transition and the transition temperature limitation in the lead-free (1-x)Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-xBaTiO3 system\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZhang, Dawei; Yao, Yonggang; Fang, Minxia; Luo, Zhengdong; Zhang, Lixue; Li, Linglong; Cui, Jian; Zhou, Zhijian; Bian, Jihong; Ren, Xiaobing; Yang, Yaodong\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMost ferroelectric transitions occur ultrafast and are time independent. However, here in (1-x) (Bi 0.5 Na 0.5 )TiO 3 -xBaTiO 3 , we have found a ferroelectric phase transition induced solely by increasing waiting time at certain temperatures (isothermal phase transition). Through cooling, a unique metastable state between a relaxor ferroelectric and a ferroelectric is unveiled, which in essence is initially a short-range ordered glassy state and then can evolve into a long-range ordered ferroelectric state through the isothermal process. It is also found that these isothermal ferroelectric transitions only occur within a specific temperature region with different waiting time needed. These features of isothermal phase transition can be understood by Landau theory analysis with the consideration of random defects as a competition between the thermodynamically favored long-range ordered state and the kinetically frustrated short-range ordered glassy state from random defects. This study offers a precise experimental as well as a phenomenological interpretation on the isothermal ferroelectric transition, which may help to further clarify the intricate structure-property relationship in this important lead-free piezoelectric material and other related systems.\n\nVisualization of dielectric constant-electric field-temperature phase maps for imprinted relaxor ferroelectric thin films\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nFrederick, J.

B.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe dielectric phase transition behavior of imprinted lead magnesium niobateâlead titanate relaxor ferroelectric thin films was mapped as a function of temperature and dc bias. To compensate for the presence of internal fields, an external electric bias was applied while measuring dielectric responses. The constructed three-dimensional dielectric maps provide insight into the dielectric behaviors of relaxor ferroelectric films as well as the temperature stability of the imprint. The transition temperature and diffuseness of the dielectric response correlate with crystallographic disorder resulting from strain and defects in the films grown on strontium titanate and silicon substrates; the latter was shown to induce a greater degree of disorder in the film as well as a dielectric response lower in magnitude and more diffuse in nature over the same temperature region. Strong and stable imprint was exhibited in both films and can be utilized to enhance the operational stability of piezoelectric devices through domain self-poling.\n\nTemperature dependence of electronic transport property in ferroelectric polymer films\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nZhao, X.L.; Wang, J.L., E-mail: jlwang@mail.sitp.ac.cn; Tian, B.B.; Liu, B.L.; Zou, Y.H.; Wang, X.D.; Sun, S.; Sun, J.L., E-mail: jlsun@mail.sitp.ac.cn; Meng, X.J.; Chu, J.H.\n\n2014-10-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ The ferroelectric polymer was fabricated by LangmuirâBlodgett method. â¢ The electrons as the dominant injected carrier were conformed in the ferroelectric polymer films. â¢ The leakage current conduction mechanisms in ferroelectric polymer were investigated. - Abstract: The leakage current mechanism of ferroelectric copolymer of polyvinylidene fluoride with trifluoroethylene prepared by LangmuirâBlodgett was investigated in the temperature range from 100 K to 350 K. The electron as the dominant injected carrier was observed in the ferroelectric copolymer films. The transport mechanisms in copolymer strongly depend on the temperature and applied voltage. From 100 K to 200 K, Schottky emission dominates the conduction. With temperature increasing, the FrenkelâPoole emission instead of the Schottky emission to conduct the carrier transport. When the temperature gets to 260 K, the leakage current becomes independent of temperature, and the space charge limited current conduction was observed.\n\nFerroelectric Phase Diagram of PVDF:PMMA\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLi, Mengyuan; Stingelin, Natalie; Michels, Jasper J.; Spijkman, Mark-Jan; Asadi, Kamal; Feldman, Kirill; Blom, Paul W.

The crystal symmetries pertaining to both the non-polar paraelectric (PE) and polar ferroelectric (FE) states have been studied by the technique of convergent-beam electron diffraction. A new phase transition has been discovered in the temperature range for which the FE and PE states coexist. The new phase transition is interpreted as the creation of a modulated antiferroelectric state, and this is viewed as marking a departure from relaxor behaviour towards more 'normal' ferroelectric behaviour.

The films were grown by rf magnetron sputtering on Pt/SiO 2 surface using different host substrates: strontium titanate, sapphire, silicon, and vycor glass. These substrates provide a systematic change in the thermal strain while maintaining the same film microstructure. From the temperature dependence of the ferroelectric A 1 soft phonon intensity, the ferroelectric phase transition temperature, T C , was determined. We found that T C decreases with increasing tensile stress in the films. This dependence is different from the theoretical predictions for epitaxial ferroelectric films. The reduction of the ferroelectric transition temperature with increasing biaxial tensile strain is attributed to the suppression of in-plane polarization due to the small lateral grain size in the films\n\nEffect of smectic A temperature width on the soft mode in ferroelectric liquid crystals\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChoudhary, A.; Kaur, S.; Prakash, J.; Sreenivas, K.; Bawa, S.

M.\n\n2008-08-01\n\nThe behavior of soft mode range with respect to the temperature width of smectic A (Sm A) phase has been studied in four different ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) materials in the frequency range 10Hz-10MHz. The studies have been carried out in a planarly well aligned cells at different temperatures and different bias fields in Sm C* and Sm A phases. Dielectric studies of these FLCs near Sm C*-Sm A phase transition show that the temperature range of soft mode relaxation frequency phenomenon varies with the temperature width of Sm A phase. The dependence of tilt angle on temperature shows the nature of the order of transition at Sm C*-Sm A phase. The coupling between order parameters of Sm C* and Sm A phase influences the soft mode and phase transition in Sm C* and Sm A phases.\n\nSynchrotron X-ray topographic studies of para-ferroelectric transition in ammonium sulphate crystal\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBhat, H.L.; Roberts, K.J.\n\n1993-01-01\n\nAmmonium sulphate undergoes a para-ferroelectric transition at 223 K. The transition is presumably first order in nature. White radiation topographic studies of this transition are presented here. The existence of pre-transition effects due to lattice deformation leading to severe strain is noticed. This sometimes resulted in dislocation generation. The well defined phase boundary observed in this crystal confirms the first order nature of this transition. The zigzag nature of the phase boundary with preferably oriented segments has been attributed to the specific properties of the strain tensors of the transition. Ferroelectric domains have also been detected by faint dynamical x-ray contrast of their images.

[Fakultaet fuer Physik und Geowissenschaften, Universitaet Leipzig, Linnestr. 5, 04103 Leipzig (Germany)\n\n2004-02-01\n\nThe dielectric behaviour of ferroelectric hydrogen bonded deuterated betaine phosphate{sub 0.03} betaine phosphite{sub 0.97} (DBP{sub 0.03}DBPI{sub 0.97})is investigated in the region of the ferroelectric phase transition. Dielectric dispersion is investigated in the frequency range up to 12 GHz. The dielectric dynamics shows a critical slowing down. The frequency of the relaxational soft mode in the paraelectric phase varies according to the quasi-one-dimensional Ising model and decreases up to 0.31 GHz at the phase transition temperature (T{sub C}=272 K). The obtained activation energy for the deuteron flipping motion {delta}U=2.3kT{sub C}=0.054 eV shows the order-disorder character of the ferroelectric phase transition. The spontaneous polarisation, obtained from pyroelectric measurements, is also well explained using the quasi-one-dimensional Ising model. At low temperatures, the freezing phenomena in DBP{sub 0.03}DBPI{sub 0.97} revealed the complex dielectric permittivity behaviour characteristic for the transition into the dipolar glass state. The activation energy of this low temperature process was found to be E{sub b}=1297 K (0.041 eV) and the glass temperature was estimated to 73 K. (copyright 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH and Co.

With decreasing temperature, a disorder-order transition of NH4 (+) cations causes a change in dielectric properties. It is thought that [NH4 ][Mg(HCOO)3 ] exhibits a higher transition temperature than [NH4 ][Zn(HCOO)3 ] due to stronger hydrogen-bonding interactions between NH4 (+) ions and framework oxygen atoms. (25) Mg and (67) Zn NMR parameters are very sensitive to temperature-induced changes in structure, dynamics, and dielectric behavior; stark spectral differences across the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition are intimately related to subtle changes in the local environment of the metal center. Although (25) Mg and (67) Zn are challenging nuclei for SSNMR experiments, the highly spherically symmetric metal-atom environments in [NH4 ][M(HCOO)3 ] give rise to relatively narrow spectra that can be acquired in 30-60â min at a low magnetic field of 9.4â T. Complementary (14) N and (13) C SSNMR experiments were performed to probe the role of NH4 (+) -framework hydrogen bonding in the paraelectric-ferroelectric phase transition. This multinuclear SSNMR approach yields new physical insights into the [NH4 ][M(HCOO)3 ] system and shows great potential for molecular-level studies on electric phenomena in a wide variety of MOFs.

Considering an external electric load applied on a cracked ferroelectric solid, a non-uniform electric field would be induced at the crack tip, and thus, incompatible strain field and local stress concentration would be generated around it. Furthermore, the enormous strain energy and the electrostatic energy would affect the polarization switching of the ferroelectric solid, important for the electrocaloric response. In this paper, the large negative and positive ECEs in a ferroelectric sheet with a conducting crack are investigated by the phase field method with the consideration of time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. The numerical calculations indicated that the polarization field generates a sharp rise during the domain transition from polydomain to monodomain under a certain electric load. Large negative ECEs, about -10.21 K and -7.55 K, are obtained at 135 Â°C and 85 Â°C, respectively. The domain transition temperature is much lower than the Curie temperature, which enlarges the existence scope of the large ECE in ferroelectrics. The results also imply that the domain transition from a multi-domain state to a single domain takes place with the minimization of total free energy, which involves the courses of the electric field, stress field, temperature, and polarization interaction. Therefore, the non-uniform distributions of the stress-electric fields induced by the crack play an important role in ECE.\n\nCharacterization Of Graphene-Ferroelectric Superlattice Hybrid Devices\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nYusuf, Mohammed; Du, Xu; Dawber, Matthew\n\n2013-03-01\n\nFerroelectric materials possess a spontaneous electrical polarization, which can be controlled by an electric field. A good interface between ferroelectric surface and graphene sheets can introduce a new generation of multifunctional devices, in which the ferroelectric material can be used to control the properties of graphene. In our approach, problems encountered in previous efforts to combine ferroelectric/carbon systems are overcome by the use of artificially layered superlattice materials grown in the form of epitaxial thin films. In these materials the phase transition temperature and dielectric response of the material can be tailored, allowing us to avoid polarization screening by surface absorbates, whilst maintaining an atomically smooth surface and optimal charge doping properties. Using ferroelectric PbTiO3/SrTiO3 superlattices, we have shown ultra-low-voltage operation of graphene field effect devices within +/- 1 V at room temperature. The switching of the graphene field effect transistors is characterized by pronounced resistance hysteresis, suitable for ultra-fast non-volatile electronics. Low temperature characterization confirmed that the coercive field required for the ferroelectric domain switching increases significantly with decreasing temperatures.

Comparative studies of temperature dependence in the EPR spectra show that as in KH 2 PO 4 -type crystals, the ferroelectric phase transition in NaTh 2 (PO 4 ) 3 crystals also seems to be related to the motion of the PO 4 units. The results help to clarify some earlier observed anomalies on the effects of Î³-irradiation on dielectric properties of KH 2 PO 4 and in particular, show that the extent of the damage can be controlled by changing the impurity content of the unirradiated samples.

The manifestation of this competition is shown to be polarization rotation, which is driven by temperature and/or size variations, thus providing a qualitative indication of intrinsic finite size effect on ferroelectrics. The concept is demonstrated in a simple case of PbTiO3 nanowires having their axis parallel to [111]C direction, where the...\n\nHigh temperature phases in PZT ferroelectric films\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nDeineka, Alexander; Suchaneck, G.; JastrabÃ­k, LubomÃ­r; Gerlach, G.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nRoÄ. 293, - (2003), s. 111-118 ISSN 0015-0193 R&D Projects: GA ÄR GP202/02/D078; GA MÅ k LN00A015 Institutional research plan: CEZ:AV0Z1010914 Keywords : ferroelectric film * phase transition * film profile Subject RIV: BM - Solid Matter Physics ; Magnetism Impact factor: 0.406, year: 2003\n\nEffects of temperature and electric field on order parameters in ferroelectric hexagonal manganites\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhang, C.

B.; Liu, J.-M.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn Landau-Devonshire phase transition theory, the order parameter represents a unique property for a disorder-order transition at the critical temperature. Nevertheless, for a phase transition with more than one order parameter, such behaviors can be quite different and system-dependent in many cases. In this work, we investigate the temperature (T) and electric field (E) dependence of the two order parameters in improper ferroelectric hexagonal manganites, addressing the phase transition from the high-symmetry P63/mmc structure to the polar P63cm structure. It is revealed that the trimerization as the primary order parameter with two components: the trimerization amplitude Q and phase Î¦, and the spontaneous polarization P emerging as the secondary order parameter exhibit quite different stability behaviors against various T and E. The critical exponents for the two parameters Q and P are 1/2 and 3/2, respectively. As temperature increases, the window for the electric field E enduring the trimerization state will shrink. An electric field will break the Z2 part of the Z2ÃZ3 symmetry. The present work may shed light on the complexity of the vortex-antivortex domain structure evolution near the phase transition temperature.\n\nIntegration and High-Temperature Characterization of Ferroelectric Vanadium-Doped Bismuth Titanate Thin Films on Silicon Carbide\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nEkstrÃ¶m, Mattias; Khartsev, Sergiy; Ãstling, Mikael; Zetterling, Carl-Mikael\n\n2017-07-01\n\n4H-SiC electronics can operate at high temperature (HT), e.g., 300Â°C to 500Â°C, for extended times. Systems using sensors and amplifiers that operate at HT would benefit from microcontrollers which can also operate at HT. Microcontrollers require nonvolatile memory (NVM) for computer programs. In this work, we demonstrate the possibility of integrating ferroelectric vanadium-doped bismuth titanate (BiTV) thin films on 4H-SiC for HT memory applications, with BiTV ferroelectric capacitors providing memory functionality. Film deposition was achieved by laser ablation on Pt (111)/TiO2/4H-SiC substrates, with magnetron-sputtered Pt used as bottom electrode and thermally evaporated Au as upper contacts. Film characterization by x-ray diffraction analysis revealed predominately (117) orientation. P- E hysteresis loops measured at room temperature showed maximum 2 P r of 48 Î¼C/cm2, large enough for wide read margins. P- E loops were measurable up to 450Â°C, with losses limiting measurements above 450Â°C. The phase-transition temperature was determined to be about 660Â°C from the discontinuity in dielectric permittivity, close to what is achieved for ceramics. These BiTV ferroelectric capacitors demonstrate potential for use in HT NVM applications for SiC digital electronics.\n\nCuInPâSâ Room Temperature Layered Ferroelectric.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBelianinov, A; He, Q; Dziaugys, A; Maksymovych, P; Eliseev, E; Borisevich, A; Morozovska, A; Banys, J; Vysochanskii, Y; Kalinin, S V\n\n2015-06-10\n\nWe explore ferroelectric properties of cleaved 2-D flakes of copper indium thiophosphate, CuInP2S6 (CITP), and probe size effects along with limits of ferroelectric phase stability, by ambient and ultra high vacuum scanning probe microscopy. CITP belongs to the only material family known to display ferroelectric polarization in a van der Waals, layered crystal at room temperature and above. Our measurements directly reveal stable, ferroelectric polarization as evidenced by domain structures, switchable polarization, and hysteresis loops. We found that at room temperature the domain structure of flakes thicker than 100 nm is similar to the cleaved bulk surfaces, whereas below 50 nm polarization disappears. We ascribe this behavior to a well-known instability of polarization due to depolarization field. Furthermore, polarization switching at high bias is also associated with ionic mobility, as evidenced both by macroscopic measurements and by formation of surface damage under the tip at a bias of 4 V-likely due to copper reduction. Mobile Cu ions may therefore also contribute to internal screening mechanisms. The existence of stable polarization in a van-der-Waals crystal naturally points toward new strategies for ultimate scaling of polar materials, quasi-2D, and single-layer materials with advanced and nonlinear dielectric properties that are presently not found in any members of the growing \"graphene family\".\n\nPhonon localization transition in relaxor ferroelectric PZN-5%PT\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nManley, Michael E.; Christianson, Andrew D.; Abernathy, Douglas L.; Sahul, Raffi\n\n2017-01-01\n\nRelaxor ferroelectric behavior occurs in many disordered ferroelectric materials but is not well understood at the atomic level. Recent experiments and theoretical arguments indicate that Anderson localization of phonons instigates relaxor behavior by driving the formation of polar nanoregions (PNRs). Here, we use inelastic neutron scattering to observe phonon localization in relaxor ferroelectric PZN-5%PT (0.95[Pb(Zn 1/3 Nb 2/3 )O 3 ]â0.05PbTiO 3 ) and detect additional features of the localization process. In the lead, up to phonon localization on cooling, the local resonant modes that drive phonon localization increase in number. The increase in resonant scattering centers is attributed to a known increase in the number of locally off centered Pb atoms on cooling. The transition to phonon localization occurs when these random scattering centers increase to a concentration where the Ioffe-Regel criterion is satisfied for localizing the phonon. Finally, we also model the effects of damped mode coupling on the observed phonons and phonon localization structure.\n\nRoom temperature ferroelectricity in continuous croconic acid thin films\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJiang, Xuanyuan; Lu, Haidong; Yin, Yuewei; Ahmadi, Zahra; Costa, Paulo S.

The discovery of ferroelectricity at the nanoscale provides not only new and exciting possibilities for device miniaturization, but also a way to study the fundamental physics of nanoscale phenomena in these materials. Ferroelectric nanowires show a rich variety of physical characteristics which are advantageous to the design of nanoscale ferroelectric devices such as exotic dipole patterns, a strong dependence of the polarization and phonon frequencies on the electrical and mechanical boundary conditions, as well as a dependence of the transition temperatures on the diameter of the nanowire. Antiferroelectricity also exists at the nanoscale and, due to the proximity in energy of the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric phases, a phase transition from the ferroelectric to the antiferroelectric phase can be facilitated through the application of the appropriate mechanical and electrical boundary conditions. While much progress has been made over the past several decades to understand the nature of ferroelectricity/antiferroelectricity in nanowires, many questions remain unanswered. In particular, little is known about how the truncated dimensions affect the soft mode frequency dynamics or how various electrical and mechanical boundary conditions might change the nature of the phase transitions in these ferroelectric nanowires. Could nanowires offer a distinct advantage for solid state cooling applications? Few studies have been done to elucidate the fundamental physics of antiferroelectric nanowires. How the polarization in ferroelectric nanowires responds to a THz electric field remains relatively underexplored as well.

A small amount of Bi 2 O 3 was added to low sintering temperature. Consequently, the dense composite ceramics were obtained at relative low sintering temperatures, which were lower than 940 deg. C. The X-ray diffractometer (XRD) identifications showed that the sintered ceramics retained the presence of distinct ferroelectric and ferrite phases. The sintering studies and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations revealed that the co-existed two phases affect the sintering behavior and grain growth of components. The electromagnetic properties, such as dielectric constant and initial permeability, change continuously between those of two components. Thus, the low-temperature sintered ferroelectric-ferrite composite ceramics with tunable electromagnetic properties were prepared by adjusting the relative content of two components.

Here we demonstrate that chains of these amphoteric molecules can often be bistable in electric polarity and electrically switchable, even in the crystalline state, through proton tautomerization. Polarization-electric field (P-E) hysteresis experiments reveal a high electric polarization ranging from 5 to 10âÎ¼Câcm-2 at room temperature. Of these molecules, 2-methylbenzimidazole allows ferroelectric switching in two dimensions due to its pseudo-tetragonal crystal symmetry.

Here we report the discovery of 2D ferromagnetic ferroelectricity in layered transition-metal halide systems. On the basis of first-principles calculations, we reveal that a charged CrBr3 monolayer exhibits in-plane multiferroicity, which is ensured by the combination of orbital and charge ordering as realized by the asymmetric Jahn-Teller distortions of octahedral Cr - Br6 units. As an example, we further show that (CrBr3)2Li is a ferromagnetic ferroelectric multiferroic.

Importantly, a magnetic transition from ferrimagnetic (FM) ordering to paramagnetic (PM) state is observed, with Curie temperature T C â¼ 330 K, being explained in terms of the suppression of cycloid spin configuration by the structural distortion.\n\nMonte Carlo simulations for describing the ferroelectric-relaxor crossover in BaTiO3-based solid solutions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPadurariu, Leontin; Enachescu, Cristian; Mitoseriu, Liliana\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe properties induced by the M 4+ addition (M = Zr, Sn, Hf) in BaM x Ti 1-x O 3 solid solutions have been described on the basis of a 2D Ising-like network and Monte Carlo calculations, in which BaMO 3 randomly distributed unit cells were considered as being non-ferroelectric. The polarization versus temperature dependences when increasing the M 4+ concentration (x) showed a continuous reduction of the remanent polarization and of the critical temperature corresponding to the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition and a modification from a first-order to a second-order phase transition with a broad temperature range for which the transition takes place, as commonly reported for relaxors. The model also describes the system's tendency to reduce the polar clusters' average size while increasing their stability in time at higher temperatures above the Curie range, when a ferroelectric-relaxor crossover is induced by increasing the substitution (x). The equilibrium micropolar states during the polarization reversal process while describing the P(E) loops were comparatively monitored for the ferroelectric (x = 0) and relaxor (x = 0.3) states. Polarization reversal in relaxor compositions proceeds by the growth of several nucleated domains (the 'labyrinthine domain pattern') instead of the large scale domain formation typical for the ferroelectric state. The spatial and temporal evolution of the polar clusters in BaM x Ti 1-x O 3 solid solutions at various x has also been described by the correlation length and correlation time. As expected for the ferroelectric-relaxor crossover characterized by a progressive increasing degree of disorder, local fluctuations cause a reducing correlation time when the substitution degree increases, at a given temperature. The correlation time around the Curie temperature increases, reflecting the increasing stability in time of some polar nanoregions in relaxors in comparison with ferroelectrics, which was experimentally proved in\n\nSynthesis and ferroelectric properties of rare earth compounds with tungsten bronze-type structure\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nBouziane, M., E-mail: bouzianemeryem@yahoo.fr [Laboratoire de Chimie du Solide Appliquee, Faculte des Sciences, Avenue Ibn Batouta, BP 1014, Rabat (Morocco); Taibi, M.

X-ray diffraction study, at room temperature, revealed that they crystallize in the tungsten bronze-type structure. Dielectric properties were performed, in the temperature range 25-500 deg. C, at three different frequencies 10, 100 and 1000 kHz. The ferroelectric transition is pronounced by a large thermal hysteresis during the heating and cooling cycles. The determined Curie temperature values T{sub c} were discussed as a function of rare earth size.

The band gap at several special points of the Brillouin zone and some characteristic parameters of the band are considered. During the phase transition, the most significant changes are observed with the valence band top at points Q, C, R, H, E and with the conduction band bottom at points H, T and E of the Brillouin zone. At the ferroelectric phase transition, the valence and conduction bands change due to displacement of Sb and S atoms with respect to I and with respect to each other as a result of order-disorder and displacement-type transition. The obtained band gap values agree quite well with the experiment. This is apparently due to application of neutral rather than ionic atomic functions and inclusion of sufficiently many plane waves in the basis set for calculation\n\nImpact of nanoconfinement on the diisopropylammonium chloride (C6H16ClN) organic ferroelectric\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBaryshnikov, S.

V.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe dielectric studies of diisopropylammonium chloride (DIPAC) nanoparticles embedded into opal and MCM-41 silica matrices are presented. It is shown that the ferroelectric phase transition shifts to low temperatures and broadens for DIPAC within the opal pores compared to bulk. The thermal hysteresis of the transition increases under opal nanoconfinement. No anomalies of the permittivity relevant to the ferroelectric transition are observed for DIPAC within the MCM-41 molecular sieves likely due to formation of the amorphous phase.\n\nMean-field theory for a ferroelectric transition\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDobry, A.; Greco, A.; Stachiotti, M.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nFor the treatment of anharmonic models of solids presenting structural transitions, a commonly used approximation is that of self-consistent phonons. Rather than the usual site decoupling, this mean-field theory is based on decoupling of modes in reciprocal space. A self-consistent phonon approximation for the non-linear polarizability model is developed in this work. The model describes the dynamical properties of ferroelectric materials. Phase diagrams as a function of relevant model parameters are presented. An analysis is made of critical behaviour and it is shown that the approximation leads to the same anomalies found in other models.

This study examined the ferroelectric transition of two magnetic perovskite materials, MnSnO3 and MnTiO3, in Pnma phase. Phase transitions to the Pnma phase at elevated pressures were observed. MnSnO3, which has a lower (larger) tolerance factor (B-site cation radius), showed a higher ferroelectric mode amplitude than MnTiO3. The distribution of the bond length of Mn-O and the mean quadratic elongation (QE) of octahedra (SnO6 or TiO6) were investigated for structural analysis. However, MnTiO3 showed a larger spontaneous polarization than MnSnO3 due to high Born effective charges of titanium. This study is useful because it provides a valuable pathway to the design of promising multiferroic materials.\n\nMicroscopic observation of ferroelectric domains in SrTiO3 using birefringence imaging techniques under high electric fields\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nManaka, Hirotaka; Nozaki, Hirofumi; Miura, Yoko\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPhase transitions in SrTiO 3 between quantum paraelectric, coherent paraelectric, and electric-field-induced ferroelectric states are governed by tetragonal domains with quantum fluctuations. However, their characteristics are still unclear. To observe the electric-field-induced ferroelectric state using birefringence imaging techniques, we developed a suitable sample holder to apply high electric fields of up to E â 5 kV/cm and temperatures down to T = 20 K. From birefringence imaging measurements of the ferroelectric LiNbO 3 with varying electric field, distributions of the electric field in the sample stage were found to be negligible. In SrTiO 3 , a huge-retardance area corresponding to the ferroelectric domains appears at E > 2 kV/cm and T â¤ 60 K even though the paraelectric domains partially remain. Furthermore, the fast-axis direction rotates by 90Â° at the ferroelectric phase transition because of an electrostrictive effect in ferroelectrics. The phase diagram of the critical electric field and temperature agrees with previous reports obtained from dielectric and neutron scattering measurements.

The highest T c 's in either field are observed in oxides: 1770 K in the ferroelectric La 2 TiO 7 and 125 K in the superconductor Tl 2 Ca 2 Cu 3 O 10 . Therefore, the question can be asked whether the observed high T c 's in oxide FE and S are a pure coincidence or whether there may be an underlying reason for it. This question is addressed first by recalling recent advances concerning anharmonic FE-properties and then by reviewing S-findings in the new compounds related to these properties\n\nPhase-Field Simulations of Topological Structures and Topological Phase Transitions in Ferroelectric Oxide Heterostructures\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZijian Hong\n\nof insulating STO is further revealed, which shows that a rich phase diagram can be formed by simply tuning the thickness of this layer. Wave-like polar spiral phase is simulated by substituting part of the PTO with BiFeO3 (BFO) in the PTO/STO superlattice (i.e., in a (PTO) 4/(BFO)4/(PTO)4/(STO)12 tricolor system) which has demonstrate ordered polar vortex lattice. This spiral phase is made up of semi-vortex cores that are floating up-down in the ferroelectric PTO layers, giving rise to a net in-plane polarization. An increase of Curie temperature and topological to regular domain transition temperature (over 200 K) is observed, due to the higher Curie temperature and larger spontaneous polarization in BFO layers. This unidirectional spiral state can be reversibly switched by experimentally feasible in-plane field, which evolves into a metastable vortex structure in-between two spiral phases with opposite in-plane directions.

The dielectric spectra were measured in the frequency range 10-1-105 Hz and temperature interval from 223 to 393 K. The dielectical properties confirm the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition at 290 K, which is reported by Abdallah Ben Rhaiem et al. (2013). The equivalent circuit based on the Z-View-software was proposed and the conduction mechanisms were determined. The obtained results have been discussed in terms of the correlated barrier hopping model (CBH) in phase I and non-overlapping small polaron tunneling model (NSPT) in phases II and III. Raman spectra as function temperature have been used to characterize the phase transitions and their nature, which indicates a change of the some peak near the transitions phase.\n\nCritical properties of a ferroelectric superlattice described by a transverse spin-1/2 Ising model\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTabyaoui, A; Saber, M; Baerner, K; Ainane, A\n\n2007-01-01\n\nThe phase transition properties of a ferroelectric superlattice with two alternating layers A and B described by a transverse spin-1/2 Ising model have been investigated using the effective field theory within a probability distribution technique that accounts for the self spin correlation functions.

The effects of the transverse field and the ferroelectric and antiferroelectric interfacial coupling strength between two ferroelectric materials are discussed. They relate to the physical properties of antiferroelectric/ferroelectric superlattices\n\nStable Ferroelectric Behavior of Nb-Modified Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3 Lead-Free Relaxor Ferroelectric Ceramics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZaman, Arif; Malik, Rizwan Ahmed; Maqbool, Adnan; Hussain, Ali; Ahmed, Tanveer; Song, Tae Kwon; Kim, Won-Jeong; Kim, Myong-Ho\n\n2018-03-01\n\nCrystal structure, dielectric, ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and electric field-induced strain properties of lead-free Nb-modified 0.96Bi0.5K0.5TiO3-0.04Bi(Mg0.5Ti0.5)O3 (BKT-BMT) piezoelectric ceramics were investigated. Crystal structure analysis showed a gradual phase transition from tetragonal to pseudocubic phase with increasing Nb content. The optimal piezoelectric property of small-signal d 33 was enhanced up to Ë 68 pC/N with a lower coercive field ( E c) of Ë 22 kV/cm and an improved remnant polarization ( P r) of Ë 13 Î¼C/cm2 for x = 0.020. A relaxor-like behavior with a frequency-dependent Curie temperature T m was observed, and a high T m around 320Â°C was obtained in the investigated system. This study suggests that the ferroelectric properties of BKT-BMT was significantly improved by means of Nb substitution. The possible shift of depolarization temperature T d toward high temperature T m may have triggered the spontaneous relaxor to ferroelectric phase transition with long-range ferroelectric order without any traces of a nonergodic relaxor state in contradiction with Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based systems. The possible enhancement in ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties near the critical composition x = 0.020 may be attributed to the increased anharmonicity of lattice vibrations which may facilitate the observed phase transition from a low-symmetry tetragonal to a high-symmetry cubic phase with a decrease in the lattice anisotropy of an undoped sample. This highly flexible (at a unit cell level) narrow compositional range triggers the enhancement of d 33 and P r values.\n\nAn investigation on phase transition behaviors in MgO-doped Pb{sub 0.99}(Zr{sub 0.95}Ti{sub 0.05}){sub 0.98}Nb{sub 0.02}O{sub 3} ferroelectric ceramics by Raman and dielectric measurements\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nWang, Junxia, E-mail: wjunxia2002@163.com [Key Laboratory of Inorganic Functional Materials and Devices, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050 (China); State Key Laboratory Cultivation Base for Nonmetal Composites and Functional Materials, Southwest University of Science and Technology, Mianyang 621010 (China); Wang, Genshui; Chen, Xuefeng [Key Laboratory of Inorganic Functional Materials and Devices, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050 (China); Hu, Zhigao [Key Laboratory of Polar Materials and Devices, Ministry of Education, Department of Electronic Engineering, East China Normal University, Shanghai 200241 (China); Nie, Hengchang; Cao, Fei [Key Laboratory of Inorganic Functional Materials and Devices, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050 (China); Dong, Xianlin, E-mail: xldong@mail.sic.ac.cn [Key Laboratory of Inorganic Functional Materials and Devices, Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200050 (China)\n\n2015-03-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ The phase transition behaviors were strongly dependent on MgO concentration. â¢ The F{sub R(LT)}âF{sub R(HT)} phase transition temperature obviously shifted toward a lower temperature with increasing MgO addition. â¢ The F{sub R(HT)}âcubic paraelectric (P{sub C}) phase transition changed to a higher temperature with increasing MgO addition. â¢ The distortion of BO{sub 6} oxygen octahedron caused by B-site replacement of Mg{sup 2+} ions is proposed to explain the observed behaviors. â¢ Superior room-temperature pyroelectric properties were obtained in 0.1 wt% MgO-modified PZTN 95/5 ceramics during F{sub R(LT)}âF{sub R(HT)} phase transition. - Abstract: The phase transition behaviors of Pb{sub 0.99}(Zr{sub 0.95}Ti{sub 0.05}){sub 0.98}Nb{sub 0.02}O{sub 3} ferroelectric ceramics doped with different MgO concentrations (0â0.2 wt%) were systematically investigated by Raman and dielectric measurements. Raman results showed that the phase transitions were strongly dependent on MgO concentration. It was found that the low temperature rhombohedral (F{sub R(LT)})âhigh temperature rhombohedral (F{sub R(HT)}) ferroelectric phase transition shifted toward a lower temperature with increasing MgO concentration up to 0.1 wt%, while the F{sub R(HT)}âcubic paraelectric (P{sub C}) phase transition changed to a higher temperature. The Raman results were in good agreement with phase transition determined by dielectric measurements. Moreover, it was indicated that the changes of Raman active modes were related to distortion of BO{sub 6} octahedra during the phase transitions. Then, the distortion of BO{sub 6} octahedron caused by B-site replacement of Mg{sup 2+} ions was proposed to explain the observed behaviors.

The jumping behavior of magnetization has been observed under the zero-field-cooling mode, but disappeared under the field-cooled cooling mode. The spin moment of iron ions reorients below 50 K leading to the magnetic structure changes. Magnetic parameters, saturation magnetization (Ms) and coercivity field (Hc), show opposite tendency with temperature throughout the measuring range, which is mainly ascribed to the Fe{sup 3+} ions situated at 4f{sub 2} and 2b sites. The curves of electrical polarization P vs temperature T under different external magnetic field indicate the existence of ferroelectricity and magnetoelectric coupling effect at low temperature, and the transition temperature T{sub P} is about 120 K.

W.\n\n2015-03-03\n\nAs semiconductor devices reach ever smaller dimensions, the challenge of power dissipation and quantum effect place a serious limit on the future device scaling. Recently, a multiferroic tunnel junction (MFTJ) with a ferroelectric barrier sandwiched between two ferromagnetic electrodes has drawn enormous interest due to its potential applications not only in multi-level data storage but also in electric field controlled spintronics and nanoferronics. Here, we present our investigations on four-level resistance states, giant tunneling electroresistance (TER) due to interfacial magnetoelectric coupling, and ferroelectric control of spin polarized tunneling in MFTJs. Coexistence of large tunneling magnetoresistance and TER has been observed in manganite/(Ba, Sr)TiO3/manganite MFTJs at low temperatures and room temperature four-resistance state devices were also obtained. To enhance the TER for potential logic operation with a magnetic memory, La0.7Sr0.3MnO3/BaTiO3/La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 /La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 MFTJs were designed by utilizing a bilayer tunneling barrier in which BaTiO3 is ferroelectric and La0.5Ca0.5MnO3 is close to ferromagnetic metal to antiferromagnetic insulator phase transition. The phase transition occurs when the ferroelectric polarization is reversed, resulting in an increase of TER by two orders of magnitude. Tunneling magnetoresistance can also be controlled by the ferroelectric polarization reversal, indicating strong magnetoelectric coupling at the interface.\n\nImproved ferroelectric and pyroelectric properties of Pb-doped SrBi4Ti4O15 ceramics for high temperature applications\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVenkata Ramana, E.; GraÃ§a, M.P.F.; Valente, M.A.; Bhima Sankaram, T.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ Sr 1âx Pb x Bi 4 Ti 4 O 15 (SPBT, x = 0 â 0.4) ceramics were synthesized by soft chemical method. â¢ X-ray diffraction analysis confirmed the formation of bismuth layered structure. â¢ SEM images showed plate like grain morphology with random orientation of plate faces. â¢ Pb-doping resulted in improved ferroelectricity of SrBi 4 Ti 4 O 15 ceramics. â¢ Pb-doped SrBi 4 Ti 4 O 15 exhibited improved pyroelectric properties with high T C . -- Abstract: Ferroelectric properties of Pb-modified strontium bismuth titanate ceramics with chemical formula Sr 1âx Pb x Bi 4 Ti 4 O 15 (x = 0â0.4) were investigated. Polycrystalline ceramics were synthesized by soft chemical method to study the effect of Pb-doping on its physical properties. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed a bismuth layered structure for all the compounds. The doping resulted in an increased tetragonal strain and improved ferroelectric properties. Scanning electron microscope images showed plate like grain morphology with random orientation of platelets. The ferroelectric transition temperature of the ceramics increased systematically from 525 Â°C to 560 Â°C with the increase of doping concentration. The piezoelectric coefficient (d 33 ) of the ceramics was enhanced significantly with Pb doping, exhibiting a maximum value of 21.8 pC/N for 40 mol.% Pb-doped SBT. Pyroelectric studies carried out using the ByerâRoundy method indicated that the modified SBT ceramics are promising candidates for high temperature pyroelectric applications\n\nUniversal ferroelectric switching dynamics of vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene copolymer films\n\nKAUST Repository\n\nHu, Weijin\n\n2014-04-24\n\nIn this work, switching dynamics of poly(vinylidene fluoride- trifluoroethylene) [P(VDF-TrFE)] copolymer films are investigated over unprecedentedly wide ranges of temperature and electric field.

M.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity have been studied for the layered crystals CuInP2S6, CuInP2Se6 from 30 K to 350 K, showing a relevant thermal anisotropy. Heat is much more efficiently transferred within the layers than perpendicular to them. The ferrielectric transition in CuInP2S6 is proven to be clearly first order while the ferroelectric one in CuInP2Se6 has a weak first order character. The behavior of the thermal conductivity as a function of temperature in the ferroelectric phases shows that heat conduction is phonon driven. Disorder in the paraelectric phases due to hopping motions of Cu ions significantly reduces the thermal conductivity to extremely low values.\n\nSelf-consistent nonlinearly polarizable shell-model dynamics for ferroelectric materials\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMkam Tchouobiap, S.E.; Kofane, T.C.; Ngabireng, C.M.\n\n2002-11-01\n\nWe investigate the dynamical properties of the polarizable shellmodel with a symmetric double Morse-type electron-ion interaction in one ionic species. A variational calculation based on the Self-Consistent Einstein Model (SCEM) shows that a theoretical ferroelectric (FE) transition temperature can be derive which demonstrates the presence of a first-order phase transition for the potassium selenate (K 2 SeO 4 ) crystal around Tc 91.5 K. Comparison of the model calculation with the experimental critical temperature yields satisfactory agreement.

The obtained data are supplemented by the measurements of thermally stimulated depolarization (TSD) in electric fields of different magnitudes and polarities. All the experimental results serve as the basis for constructing the temperature dependence of the spontaneous polarization ÎPs(T,U) and the pyroelectric coefficient Î³(U,T) for fixed external stimuli. It is found that the value of ÎPs in the sample of sodium nitrite is negligible at low temperatures, up to 40 K. This indicates (for known experimental values of the linear expansion coefficients) a minor contribution of the sample piezoelectricity to the spontaneous polarization in this temperature range. Starting from T = 75 K, an exponential increase in the contribution to the total charge of the TSD is found only in the defect subsystem of the crystal. Based on the data of physical studies, a crystal-physics model is proposed, which differs from the model presented by Lines and Glass. Due to the splitting of ion positions in all three sublattices upon the transition to the paraelectric phase, NaNO2 crystals can be assigned to the three-dimensional type of ferroelectrics, according to the classification by Abrahams and Keve. This agrees with the estimate of the spontaneous polarization Ps Ë 0.01 C/m2 given in the paper. This value is significantly different from the data obtained by repolarization of nonstoichiometric samples in strong electric fields up to the phase transition temperature.\n\nPreisach modeling of temperature-dependent ferroelectric response of piezoceramics at sub-switching regime\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nOchoa, Diego Alejandro; GarcÃ­a, Jose Eduardo\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe Preisach model is a classical method for describing nonlinear behavior in hysteretic systems. According to this model, a hysteretic system contains a collection of simple bistable units which are characterized by an internal field and a coercive field. This set of bistable units exhibits a statistical distribution that depends on these fields as parameters. Thus, nonlinear response depends on the specific distribution function associated with the material. This model is satisfactorily used in this work to describe the temperature-dependent ferroelectric response in PZT- and KNN-based piezoceramics. A distribution function expanded in Maclaurin series considering only the first terms in the internal field and the coercive field is proposed. Changes in coefficient relations of a single distribution function allow us to explain the complex temperature dependence of hard piezoceramic behavior. A similar analysis based on the same form of the distribution function shows that the KNL-NTS properties soften around its orthorhombic to tetragonal phase transition.\n\nControl of magnetic relaxation by electric-field-induced ferroelectric phase transition and inhomogeneous domain switching\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNan, Tianxiang; Emori, Satoru; Wang, Xinjun; Hu, Zhongqiang; Xie, Li; Gao, Yuan; Lin, Hwaider; Sun, Nian, E-mail: n.sun@neu.edu [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115 (United States); Peng, Bin; Liu, Ming, E-mail: mingliu@mail.xjtu.edu.cn [Electronic Materials Research Laboratory, Xi' an Jiaotong University, Xi' an 710049 (China); Jiao, Jie; Luo, Haosu [Shanghai Institute of Ceramics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 201800 (China); Budil, David [Department of Chemistry, Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts 02115 (United States); Jones, John G.; Howe, Brandon M.; Brown, Gail J.

However, it is not well understood how electric-field-induced strain influences magnetic relaxation, an important physical process for device applications. Here, we investigate resonant magnetization dynamics in ferromagnet/ferroelectric multiferroic heterostructures, FeGaB/PMN-PT and NiFe/PMN-PT, in two distinct strain states provided by electric-field-induced ferroelectric phase transition. The strain not only modifies magnetic anisotropy but also magnetic relaxation. In FeGaB/PMN-PT, we observe a nearly two-fold change in intrinsic Gilbert damping by electric field, which is attributed to strain-induced tuning of spin-orbit coupling. By contrast, a small but measurable change in extrinsic linewidth broadening is attributed to inhomogeneous ferroelastic domain switching during the phase transition of the PMN-PT substrate.\n\nHigh temperature dielectric and ferroelectric properties of La-modified PbTiO3 nanoceramics\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShukla, Archana; Shukla, Namrata; Choudhary, R.N.P.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFerroelectric materials with high Curie temperature (higher than 300 Â°C) are highly desirable to construct transducers for high-temperature piezoelectric applications. Among the ferroelectric materials, PbTiO 3 (PT) is considered to be one of the most promising materials. However, the fabrication of high density pure PT ceramics is very difficult because of the highly anisotropy, which limited the use in piezoelectric transducers. Usually, substitutions towards A or B-site of PT may reduce the high anisotropy. The present work reports the experimental investigations on the effect of lanthanum (La 3+ ) substitution on the structural, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of lead titanate (PT) ceramic at high-temperature (RT â¼ 600Â°C)\n\nChemical approach to neutral-ionic valence instability, quantum phase transition, and relaxor ferroelectricity in organic charge-transfer complexes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHoriuchi, Sachio; Kumai, Reiji; Okimoto, Yoichi; Tokura, Yoshinori\n\n2006-01-01\n\nNeutral-ionic (NI) phase transition is a reversible switching of organic charge-transfer complexes between distinct valence states by external stimuli. This phase transformation in the low-dimensional system is demonstrated to provide a variety of novel dielectric, structural, and electronic properties. Importantly, ionization of the electron donor-acceptor pairs is usually accompanied by a ferroelectric or antiferroelectric order of the molecular lattice, leading to huge dielectric response near the transition point. Although these characteristics are potentially useful for future electronic and optical applications, the thermally accessible NI transition (TINIT) is still an extremely rare case. The TINIT compounds including some new materials are overviewed in order to provide convenient guides to their design and experimental identifications. The phase transition and dielectric properties can be closely controlled in various ways depending on chemical and physical modifications of the crystals. Among them, a quantum phase transition and relaxor ferroelectricity, both of which are currently attracting subjects from both scientific and practical perspectives, are highlighted as the first achievements in organic charge-transfer complexes\n\nFerroelectrics: A pathway to switchable surface chemistry and catalysis\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKakekhani, Arvin; Ismail-Beigi, Sohrab; Altman, Eric I.\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIt has been known for more than six decades that ferroelectricity can affect a material's surface physics and chemistry thereby potentially enhancing its catalytic properties. Ferroelectrics are a class of materials with a switchable electrical polarization that can affect surface stoichiometry and electronic structure and thus adsorption energies and modes; e.g., molecular versus dissociative. Therefore, ferroelectrics may be utilized to achieve switchable surface chemistry whereby surface properties are not fixed but can be dynamically controlled by, for example, applying an external electric field or modulating the temperature. Several important examples of applications of ferroelectric and polar materials in photocatalysis and heterogeneous catalysis are discussed. In photocatalysis, the polarization direction can control band bending at water/ferroelectric and ferroelectric/semiconductor interfaces, thereby facilitating charge separation and transfer to the electrolyte and enhancing photocatalytic activity. For gas-surface interactions, available results suggest that using ferroelectrics to support catalytically active transition metals and oxides is another way to enhance catalytic activity. Finally, the possibility of inco"
