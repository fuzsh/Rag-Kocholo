        "text": "Cesar said:\n\nBowing is much more SINCERE than a hand shake, why cant you do that?? Why cant you be sincere?\n\nI have done this in the past. I have no major objections to bowing\n\nto other people, but the question still remains. If you pass on a\n\ntrait to another culture will it still have the same significance in the\n\nforgien culture. Bowing may be more important in japanese\n\nsociety, but if americans see it as an empty gesture is it worth\n\ndoing. Is it really more sincere than a handshake if the exponents\n\ndo not perform it sincerely.\n\nCesar said:\n\nin the martial arts, its NEVER about idolizing.\n\nTheoretically maybe, but I have seen more then enough people\n\npretent to be more asian as though it would make them a\n\nbetter practitioner or more inline with asian ideals. They\n\ncontradict the very ideal they sometimes try to emulate.\n\nThe go for 'the flower instead of the fruit'.\n\nJust to clarify a few things....\n\nThe islamic faith is known for their amazing geometric patterns.\n\nHave you ever seen the close detail of a mosque?? The reason\n\nfor this is the need for decoration because the faith does not\n\nbelieve in rendering the image of god....I have seen different\n\ncultures interpret certain parts of the koran differently...\n\n(like the status of women and music and such), but the act\n\nof bowing to am image...let alone one not of god I think would\n\nbe taken seriously. Do any muslims have a comment on this??\n\nDo any more well read in christian theology have problem with\n\nbowing to a picture or shrine?? What is the official vatican stance\n\non such a thing?\n\nFred Stakem\n\nPersonaly, I am rather fond of the quote by Don Angier\n\n\"Ki is Crap.\"\n\nSimple and definitive. I wouldn't mind listiening to all the diatribes about it so much, if those being so verbose could do anything substantive other than just talk about it.\n\nIt isn't a force, it doesn't work and the parlor tricks supposedly performed with it can be stopped rather easily if you understand the mechanics of the human body. The nonsense put forth as \"Ki power\" is nothing more than an understanding of the bio-mechanics of the human form. If it were valid on its own, it work without people on the receiving end.\n\nAnd Please spare me the exploits of others!\n\nI can pin with a finger, I can drop you and then pin your leg so steadfastly to the ground that you cannot move it, from there I can immobilize your hip joints-till I climb you and choke you out. As an alternative to that I can articulate your leg in a very deceptive, hard to discern way- that freezes your hip muscles. People who have felt it say I am controlling their ki. Baloney- it is a deep study of the muscular / skeletal system. Whats more there a dozens of people who practice these techniques. It has nothing to do with any otherwordly power. Further, there are definitive relaxed training methods that forestall the opponenets use of a relaxed fighting system against you (your ki nonsense). This creates a \"stop you in your tracks\" approach to Ki bunnies.\n\nFunny that most of the truly competant fighters I have known will show you exact and specific ways to manipulate the responses, and structures of attackers bodies.......\n\nMost Aiki bunnies just blather on about this cosmic hooey and go one to more or less \"suck\" against a man who has the where-with-all to see them undone. I have had the great fun of seeing them undone by reasonably competant players. I guess the \"force wasn't with them on those occasions.....seems like it never is when they have to face someone who can truly fight.\n\nYou want to acomplish something subsantial? Learn anatomy.You can amaze many people with how easy you can de-construct postures-add to that lots of fighting tactics and you have an art that can man handle people.......oops , sorry you can move them easily with your Ki.\n\nAs far as any of this nonsense interfering with your faith I would say this. You would have to believe in the anamist (sp) view point to begin with-otherwise there is no probem is there?\n\nI don't have to worry about my faith in God being affected by Shinto shrines, trees energy, or wood sprites.....Because I don't believe in that. If a teacher believes in all of that and is offended by a student not bowing to it- theres a problem.\n\nQuestion is \"Who is the one who has the problem with tolerence?\"\n\nHey.....you said you wanted opinions.\n\nIt's a big bad world out there.\n\nDan\n\n\"The only thing of value Ueshiba ever taught us was how to relax\"\n\nAikido journal interview with Tohei\n\nWell, now that I have taken the time to read them Chris......you are exactly right.......oh well\n\nBTW\n\nMeik was the one who coined the \"Aiki bunnies\" phrase...not to slam the whole art, nor all the players, just the many crunchy granola people drawn to it. And most have no porblem differentiating the two.\n\nCan't see the \"bunny\" comment being applied to Judo, jujutsu, good Karate or Daito ryu people though- they don't draw that type of crowd-in fact they seem to run the other way. Over the years I have read the writtings of too many Aikido teachers who more or less agree with that, and wish those type of people found another pursuit...In fact last month I spent some time with an Iwama Style teacher who -looking out over some of his students- said just that. \" I Can't showing them anything challanging or they whine.\"\n\nDan\n\nWell, a fight and self defense are two seperate things. any one in law enforcement or military know this. facing each other and taking a stance is much different from someone grabbing you and stabbing you with a knife. So a big man might be able to knock out a smaller one in the ring, but it might not be the case in reality. Most situations dont give you one person that will get in a stance and say lets fight. Most of them are when a group of buddies get together to beat the crap out of one person, so how can you fight that?? i think in that situation a person with aikido training will have the advantage compared to the other arts.\n\nAs for the idea of ki, i think b/c most of us do not have much actual experience with it it is hard to idealize. When you look at o-sensei and tohei sensei's feats they accomplished in their lives, who strongly believe in ki, ours do not compare. Both were in huge scenes of battle, something that is probably much more realistic than a fight! So where's the big man and his understanding of anatomy when bullets are flying through the air?? probably crying out of fear of dying.The use of energy and spirit, and extending spritual energy, is what saved them from dying in the wars, not martial technique. That is probably most realistic for those who want the most reality possible in their training. Not technique, but how to extend energy in the battle field.....who knows...\n\nCesar\n\nI have been approached by the conservative Christians in some of the circles that I am in and they ask if I think that it is OK for a Christian to practice Martial Arts.\n\nI say yes it is OK. I'm a minister - I have seen dojos that I would not want to study with or dojos that I would not to study at - because it would compromise my witness as a Christian. They practice obvious other religious overtones through various aspects of their art.\n\nI think that there is a serious misinterpretation going on when we hear \"Thou shall no boww before other gods,\" (little g) neither O-sensi nor anyone else is a god. It's just a Japanese \"handshake.\" But the minute that I place someone or something above my relation ship with Jesus Christ - there is the god, and I have violated a serious law.\n\nI am a pretty conservative person myself. But I disagree with such interpretations that Dr. Rebecca Brown says in her book \"He came to set the captives free.\"\n\nI think that there is a serious misinterpretation going on when we hear \"Thou shall no boww before other gods,\" (little g) neither O-sensi nor anyone else is a god. It's just a Japanese \"handshake.\"\n\nO-sensei might not be a god, but some would say bowing to\n\nhis picture would be treating him like a god. I am not so\n\nsure it is entirely a religious question though. Most western\n\npeople I know see bowing as sort of strange or subserviant.\n\nWhen I was younger I might have thought these people need\n\nto be a bit more open. I am not so sure now.\n\nMost of my friends are not the type to\n\npractice martial arts and look at some of the rituals as strange.\n\nThe older I get I am just wondering if we should emulate things\n\nthat are foreign to us....maybe it is respect, but to a lot of people\n\nI met it is just another blank ritual. I just wonder how many\n\npeople there are out there that are just attracted to ma because\n\nof it's foreignness or because these rituals make it exotic. When\n\nyou go out to play sports you don't see people who would\n\nrather talk about why modern soccer shin pads are better than\n\nolder ones. You see people who just want to play. Why then\n\nin ma are there so few people who actually want to practice??\n\nFred Stakem\n\nAlthough I am a devout athiest, my wonderful wife is a devoted Catholic. She doesn't have any problem with me bowing to other people or shrines. I believe she understands that it is considered both a greeting and a method of showing respect. Maybe that's because she's been to Japan and has had many Asian friends over the years. Also, our Dojo Cho is Catholic, and we have had and will continue to have Buddhist ceremonies in our dojo in memory of our late Sensei. I don't think anyone in our dojo perceives any conflict.\n\nOh, and I do believe in ki. I think it is one of the wonders of this world. I use it every day and every night. I gather it into my hand and extend it and I can do things like open and close doors. I can even use it to start the engine of my car. I can use it to make music too!\n\n\"I've got the ki, the ki to the highway...\" - Eric Clapton\n\n\"You have no ki! Ha ha ha ha...\" - Akira Tohei Sensei after seeing one of his students drop his ki on the sidewalk"
