These steps underscore the belief that the rising costs and risks associated with new potentially high-payoff technologies, and the growing global dispersal of technical expertise, require national R&D programs to support new and existing high-technology firms within their borders. They also reflect the belief that shared facilities, coupled with geographical proximity, can facilitate the transition of ideas from universities and laboratories to private markets. What is the impact of these initiatives for the competitive position of the United States? In a recent report, the National Academies warned that “this nation must prepare with great urgency to preserve its strategic and economic security,” adding that “the United States must compete by optimizing its knowledge-based resources, particularly in science and technology, and by sustaining the most fertile environment for new and revitalized industries and the well-paying jobs they bring.” Understanding the change in nature of these new institutions is a first step in understanding that the nature and terms of economic competition are shifting.

These policies are designed to build research capacities and to acquire knowledge, and then to transition that knowledge directly to companies and support their development. Some nations have developed well-financed and integrated national programs that are designed to enhance their economic growth, technical competency, and competitive position. Other national programs, while more modest in scale, provide essentially market-based incentives to encourage the transition of new technologies to the market. Yet, even these can have a significant impact on the terms of competition. While institutions and the scale of funding vary across the globe, a comparative perspective can help us understand what policies are succeeding and why, what we may learn from the experience of others, what existing U.S. programs might be enhanced, and what new initiatives might be launched. What is clear is that the terms of competition are shifting. Other nations are devoting very substantial resources to attract, develop, and nurture the industries of today and tomorrow. U.S. policy needs to be formulated with this understanding. PROJECT OVERVIEW Recognizing the importance of targeted government promotional policies relative to innovation, the Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) is studying selected foreign innovation programs and comparing them with major U.S. programs. This analysis of Comparative Innovation Policy, carried out under the direction of an ad hoc Committee, includes a review of the goals, concept, structure, operation, funding levels, and evaluation of foreign programs designed to advance the innovation capacity of national economies and enhance their international competitiveness.\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nThe Context of this Report Since 1991 the STEP Board has undertaken a program of activities to improve policymakers’ understanding of the interconnections among science, technology, and economic policy and their importance to the American economy and its international competitive position. The Board’s interest in comparative innovation policies derives directly from its mandate. This mandate has previously been reflected in STEP’s widely cited volume, U.S. Industry in 2000, which assesses the determinants of competitive performance in a wide range of manufacturing and service industries, including\n\nCentury: The Past and Future of American Economic Competitiveness, Washington, DC: Woodrow Wilson Center Press, 2005, Chapter 14.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\nxv\n\npreface\n\nBox A Innovation and Competitiveness\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nInnovation can be defined as the transformation of an idea into a marketable product or service, a new or improved manufacturing or distribution process, or even a new method of providing a social service. This transformation involves an adaptive network of institutions that encompass a variety of informal and formal rules, norms, and procedures—a national innovation ecosystem—that shape how individuals and corporate entities create knowledge and collaborate to bring new products and services to market. If competitiveness is defined as the ability to gain market share by adding value better than others in the globalized economic environment, then the ability of entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and scientists and engineers and others to collaborate successfully within a given innovation ecosystem gains significance. Recognizing this, policymakers around the world are supporting a variety of initiatives to improve cooperation within their national innovation ecosystems as a way of improving their national competitiveness. Science and technology parks are widely perceived as an effective mechanism to promote such partnerships\n\nthose relating to information technology. The Board also undertook a major study, chaired by Gordon Moore of Intel, on how government-industry partnerships can support the growth and commercialization of productivity enhancing technologies. Reflecting a growing recognition of the importance of the surge in productivity since 1995, the Board also launched a multifaceted assessment, exploring the sources of growth, measurement challenges, and the policy framework required to sustain the New Economy. The current study on Comparative Innovation Policy builds on STEP’s experience to develop an international comparative analysis focused on U.S. and foreign innovation programs. To open this analysis, the Committee held a symposium on April 15, 2005, which drew together leading academics, policy analysts, and senior ­policymakers National Research Council, U.S. Industry in 2000: Studies in Competitive Performance, David C. Mowery, ed., Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 1999. This summary of a multivolume study provides the Moore Committee’s analysis of best practices among key U.S. public-private partnerships.

Follow up symposia in Taipei and Tokyo in January 2006 focused on the evolution of the Taiwanese and Japanese innovation systems over the past decade. The Committee also convened a major conference in Washington in June 2006 that identified current trends in the Indian innovation system and highlighted the new U.S.-India innovation partnership. This was soon followed by a symposium on “Synergies in Regional and National Innovation Policies in the Global Economy” held in Flanders, Belgium. This event reviewed European Union, national and regional innovation policies in Flanders, a region of Belgium, with a major university and research center with a strong commercialization record. Flanders is also home to IMEC, one of the leading microelectronics research facilities in the world and the flagship of Flemish technology policy. A Joint Effort This report captures the presentations and discussions of a March 2008 conference on best practices among science and technology research parks around the world. The conference was organized jointly with the Association of University Research Parks (AURP). By drawing on the AURP’s expertise and contacts, the conference brought together leading figures from government, universities, and science and technology parks, both from the United States and around the world. The goal of the conference was to increase policymakers’ understanding of the role of research parks as sources of innovation and regional growth, while also reviewing their contributions to government missions and to the commercialization of university research.\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nParks Are a Diverse Phenomenon An important characteristic of research parks is their diversity. Accordingly, the conference examined a broad range of research parks, including both university- and laboratory-based parks as well as the large-scale industrial models often undertaken in Asia and Europe. While recognizing the diversity of objectives and the differences in scope and scale of activity, the conference sought to identify common challenges faced by research parks both in the United States and abroad, including evaluation and the need for appropriate metrics. Of course, no one-day conference can capture all aspects of this complex For a summary of this conference, see National Research Council, Innovation Policies for the 21st Century, Charles W. Wessner, ed., Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2007.

While there may be strategies and programs that do not work effectively, even within successful parks, this conference was focused on the practices of successful parks around the world.\n\nCopyright © 2009.

To meet the need for a better understanding of the scope and scale of programs overseas to support the growth and development of research parks and to improve our understanding of the scale and contributions of parks in the U.S. context, the National Academies convened an international conference on global best practices in research parks. This report of that conference captures the rich discussion of the diverse roles university- and laboratorybased research parks play in national innovation systems. The presentations of the conference participants demonstrate the range of objectives and the substantial differences in scope and scale of activity characterizing research parks around the world, while also identifying common challenges. The conference included participants from countries as diverse as China, Singapore, India, the United Kingdom, France, Mexico, and Hungary. They described national efforts to develop research parks of significant scale and scientific and innovative potential. They noted that in many cases, these research parks are expected to generate benefits that go beyond regional development and job creation. As these participants observed, effective research parks have the potential to contribute to regional growth by facilitating innovation and forms\n\n*Caveat: It is important to note that this summary does not represent the statements and conclusions of the NRC Committee on Comparative Innovation Policy, but simply summarizes key points raised by participants of the conference.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al.

Alternatively referred to as research parks, science parks, technology parks, technopoles, science centers, business innovation centers, and centers for advanced technology, there appears to be no singular characterization of a research park. The International Association of Science Parks defines a Science Park as “an organisation managed by specialised professionals, whose main aim is to increase the wealth of its community by promoting the culture of innovation and the competitiveness of its associated businesses and knowledge-based institutions. To enable these goals to be met, a Science Park stimulates and manages the flow of knowledge and technology amongst universities, R&D institutions, companies and markets; it facilitates the creation and growth of innovation-based companies through incubation and spin-off processes; and provides other value-added services together with high quality space and facilities.”a\n\nCopyright © 2009.

Research parks are seen increasingly around the world as a means to create dynamic clusters that accelerate economic growth and international competitiveness. Specifically, research parks, of various sizes and types, are widely seen as an effective policy tool to realize larger and more visible returns on a nation’s investments in research and development. Most research parks seek to encourage greater collaboration among universities, research laboratories, and large and small companies, in order to facilitate the conversion of new ideas into the innovative technologies for the market. They are widely considered to be a proven tool to encourage the formation of innovative high-technology companies. They are also seen as an effective means to generate employment and to make existing companies more competitive through cooperative R&D, shared facilities, and the benefits derived from co-location. S&T Parks are a rapidly growing phenomenon and an increasingly common tool of national and regional economic development. They are designed to: See, for example, the presentation by Dr. M. S.

Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\nSUMMARY\n\n— Facilitate the cooperation that generates higher returns on existing investments in R&D and large-scale research facilities; — Meet the special needs of high-tech industries for infrastructure and associated services; and — Achieve critical mass in terms of co-located research facilities and staff. In the United States, innovative clusters and parks have developed as a result of government action and private initiatives, and in some cases around a government-funded laboratory. Research Triangle Park was built on national investments in major research universities in the Research Triangle area and has benefitted from patient state support and funding. The Sandia Science and Technology Park, located near Sandia National Laboratories in New Mexico and the NASA Research Park, located at the NASA Ames facility in California are two examples of successful research parks that advance the missions of federal laboratories and research facilities while contributing to regional economic growth and missionrelated innovation. As a result of this success, innovation clusters, such as North Carolina’s Research Triangle (and less directly Silicon Valley), are now being emulated around the world, often on a significantly larger scale. The United States has led the way in park creation and the generation of high-tech clusters. Yet on a global basis, the United States is not making comparable efforts, nor are federal programs supporting regional and state ­ efforts to the same degree.10 Investments by the world’s leading nations in research parks reflect an appreciation of their capacity to spur knowledge-based growth and a national commitment to enhance technological competitiveness through innovation.11 While research parks such as those at NASA Ames and Sandia have recorded significant progress, and new federal initiatives such as that of the National Cancer Institute are underway, the potential of research parks ­appears\n\nCopyright © 2009.

In the United States, support for research parks is principally undertaken by state and local governments with limited support by the federal government. 12 While research parks are highly varied, the conference nonetheless captured some common elements characteristic of successful research parks. These “best practices” include the presence of: • Champions: Committed champions who match sustained, high-level attention with significant support for the growth and development of a research park.13 • Leadership: Effective leadership and professional management to facilitate networking among the entrepreneurs, researchers, investors, and others within and around the research park’s innovation ecosystem.14 • Funding: Designated and sustained public funding and active private participation, combined with effective public policies to support companies that seek to convert ideas into innovations and innovations into products for the market. 15 • Bridging institutions: Such as the North Carolina Board on Science and Technology, that preserve the vision of the research park over the long period it takes for parks to mature and become successful.16 • Soft infrastructure: This term captures the positive human capital built over many years of public investments in education and skills training, public policies that encourage an entrepreneurial culture, and the presence of networks among professionals.17 • Metrics: Effective metrics to help management set clear goals and, over time, gauge the effectiveness of the research park.18 12 See\n\nthe remarks by Prof. Phillip Phan in the Proceedings section of this report. Richard Stulen drew attention to the role that effective high-level champions like Senator Bingaman have played in the growth of New Mexico’s Sandia Science and Technology Park. 14 Clear goals, capable management, and sustained support are essential for the effective development of research parks, as documented in recent reviews by the National Research Council of the research parks affiliated with the NASA Ames Research Center and Sandia National Laboratories.

A concept that is now 60 years old, research parks are widely believed to encourage greater collaboration among universities, research laboratories, and large and small companies, providing a means to help convert new ideas into the innovative technologies for the market. In this way, research parks are recognized to be a “proven tool to create successful new companies, sustain them, attract new ones—especially in the science, technology, and innovation sector— and make existing companies more successful through the use of R&D.” Today, countries as diverse as China, Singapore, India, and France are among those undertaking substantial national efforts to develop research parks of significant scale and scientific and innovative potential. In many cases, these research parks are expected to generate benefits that go beyond regional development and job creation. Indeed, to the extent that research parks are effective, they have the potential to shift the terms of global competition, not least in leading technological sectors. For example, as Senator Bingaman noted in his keynote remarks at The first research park was established in Menlo Park, California, in 1948. Early successful parks, established in the 1950s and early 1960s, include the Stanford Industrial Park (est. 1953) in California, Research Triangle Park (est. 1958) in North Carolina, and Waltham Industrial Center (est. 1954) in Massachusetts.

We have not given it nearly the emphasis of other countries. I would like to see the government provide more assistance to states to make research parks a priority.” Senator Jeff Bingaman, Keynote remarks at the 2008 National Academies conference on S&T Research Parks\n\nCopyright © 2009.

Yet, while investments by the world’s leading nations in research parks reflects an appreciation of their capacity to spur knowledge-based growth and enhance technological competitiveness through innovation, this potential of research parks appears to be less well understood by policymakers and the public in the United States. To better understand the role that research parks can play as sources of innovation, regional growth, and national competitiveness for the United States and to document recent developments in the growth of research parks around the world, the National Academies’ Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy (STEP) partnered with the Association of University Research Parks (AURP) to bring together leading figures from governments, universities, and research parks from the United States and around the world. In the early 1990s, the Indian government established a network of national software technology parks that provided broadband connectivity based on satellite and fiber technology, single-window clearance system to software exporters, and incubation services. These research parks have helped India generate a substantial return on national investments on research and training in science and engineering. Today, the software industry is dominated by globally competitive champions from India, including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, and Wipro Technologies, each of which has generated revenues in excess of US$1 billion a year in recent times. See Tilman Altenburg, Hubert Schmitz, and Andreas Stamm, “Breakthrough: China’s and India’s Transition from Production to Innovation,” World Development 36(2):325-344, February 2008. Senator Bingaman’s keynote address is summarized in the Proceedings section of this report. The conference, which was organized in cooperation with AURP, took place on March 13, 2008, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington, DC, AURP is an association of planned and operating research parks around the world. Its mission is “to promote the development and operations of research parks that foster innovation, commercialization and economic competitiveness in a global economy through collaboration among universities, industry and government.”\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe conference was timely, reflecting the growth of research parks around the word in terms of numbers, scale of operations, and the participation of many leading global corporations. The conference was also timely with respect to recent legislation introduced by Senators Bingaman, Bunning, and Pryor to provide federal assistance to states that are seeking to develop research parks. This report of that conference captures the rich discussion of the diverse roles that university- and laboratory-based research parks play in national innovation systems. It also captures the central role of government support in the growth of research parks in countries as varied as China, Singapore, India, Hungary, France, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and the United States. The conference presentations demonstrated the range of objectives and the substantial differences in scope and scale of activity characterizing research parks around the world, while also identifying common challenges. Addressing the 21st Century Innovation Challenge The global proliferation of research parks reflects the recognition by national and regional governments that future economic growth and competitiveness lies in developing a robust knowledge economy. The proliferation of research parks highlights the need for a better understanding by U.S. policymakers of the ambitious objectives and sheer scale of these programs in terms of their structure, operation, and funding levels. Indeed, these partnership programs and supporting policy measures are of great relevance to the United States and other countries both for their potential impact on national competitiveness and for the policy lessons they offer.\n\nCopyright © 2009.

As the National Academies noted in its recent report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, “this nation must prepare with great urgency to preserve its strategic and economic In 2004, through Senator Bingaman’s introduction of S. 2737, “The Science Park Administration Act of 2004,” and again in 2007 through Senator Pryor’s introduction of S. 1373, “The Building a Stronger America Act,” the U.S. Congress considered, but did not pass, a bill to provide grants and loans to states and local authorities for the development and construction of university parks. Implicit in these bills is the assumption that R-S-T parks are an important element in the U.S. national innovation system and as such should be fostered because of both the knowledge-based and employmentbased spillovers that will result. The Science Park Administration Act of 2004 was reintroduced in S. 1581 as the Science Park Administration Act of 2005. Albert Link, in his overview of the academic literature (in this volume) on research S&T parks, notes that “in the United States, public investment at state universities is used to underwrite the formation and development of R-S-T parks,” which is, by definition, a limited source of investment.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n10\n\nUNDERSTANDING RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\nsecurity. Because other nations have, and probably will continue to have the competitive advantage of low-wage structure, the United States must compete by optimizing its knowledge-based resources, particularly in science and technology, and by sustaining the most fertile environment for new and revitalized industries and the well-paying jobs they bring.” If the United States is to respond to this challenge, its policymakers must understand what is happening at the cutting edge of policies to advance science, technology, and innovation around the world. In his remarks, James Turner, the Chief Counsel of the House Committee on Science at the time, affirmed that U.S. policies must address these new realities if the nation is to compete successfully in the 21st century. To contribute to policymakers’ understanding of global developments in innovation, the National Academies’ STEP Board has undertaken a comparative review of policies and programs around the world designed to stimulate ­knowledge-based growth. The study highlights the growth around the world of investments in research and development as well as new public-private partnerships to foster the collaboration needed to translate ideas born in the laboratory into competitive new products for the marketplace. The Role of Public-Private Partnerships Public-private partnerships are widely seen as a tool required to address today’s innovation imperative. By stimulating cooperative research and development among industry, government, and universities, partnerships can play an instrumental role in introducing new technologies to the market. A recent review by the National Academies of best practices among U.S. innovation partnerships shows that cooperative research and development among industry, universities,\n\nCopyright © 2009.

Wessner, ed., Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2008. Not all policy observers accept the view that partnerships can play an important, even determinant, role in bringing technologies to market. Some would argue that most innovations come from the private sector acting alone and that government’s role in supporting innovation is limited. They believe that the vitality of the U.S. economy rests almost exclusively on the dynamism of the private sector. These perspectives ignore the real-world gaps and irregularities in information that often preclude successful collaboration within the private sector. The Nobel Committee in awarding the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics to George A. Akerlof, A. Michael Spence, and Joseph E. Stiglitz recognized their pathbreaking analysis of these information asymmetries.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al.

Partnerships help by bringing innovations to the point where private actors can introduce them to the market. Accelerated progress in obtaining the benefits of new products, new processes, and new knowledge into the market has positive consequences for economic growth and human welfare.”a Government-Industry Partnerships for the Development of New Technologies A Report of the National Academies aNational Research Council, Government-Industry Partnerships for the Development of New Technologies, Charles W.

The growing importance of collaboration in bringing research to the market and the positive role of federal support for innovative small companies is documented in a recent independent study of the changes in the United States innovation landscape over the past four decades.10 Research parks are a type of public-private partnership that “fosters knowledge flows—often between park firms and universities and among park firms—and\n\nA National Research Council Committee led by Gordon Moore concluded that “Public-private partnerships, involving cooperative research and development activities among industry, government laboratories, and universities, can play an instrumental role in accelerating the development of new technologies from idea to market.” See National Research Council, Government-Industry Partnerships for the Development of New Technologies: Summary Report, Charles W. Wessner, ed., Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2003, p. 23. 10 See Fred Block and Matthew Keller, “Where Do Innovations Come From? Transformations in the U.S. National Innovation System, 1970-2006,” The Information Technology and Innovation Forum, July 2008. Accessed at . The authors analyze a sample of innovations recognized by R&D Magazine as being among the top 100 innovations of the year over the past four decades. They find that while in the 1970s almost all winners came from corporations acting on their own, more recently over two-thirds of the winners have come from partnerships involving business and government, including federal labs and federally funded university research. Moreover, in 2006 77 of the 88 U.S. entities that produced award-winning innovations were beneficiaries of federal funding.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n12\n\nUNDERSTANDING RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\ncontributes to regional economic growth and development.”11 These partnerships enhance, both formally and informally, the efficiency of innovation within park firms, universities, and national laboratories. As Professor Albert Link of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro and others have noted, scientific research is often characterized by high “spillovers” of knowledge.12 In such cases, private investors may not be able to capture the benefits of research at sufficient levels to justify investment in that research. Public investments in facilities such as research parks can reduce the costs faced by individual firms and thus increase the willingness of universities and private firms to perform research. The result of this research spills over to other firms in the park and in the local and national economy.13 Many countries around the world as well as some states here in the United States have adopted measures to lower costs for firms by providing commercial facilities that enhance the research process, lower its cost, and where appropriate speed its dissemination.\n\nBox C Parks as a Nexus of Innovation “Research Parks appear to be an excellent place to cross the Valley of Death between invention and the marketplace.” Dr. Lawrence Schuette, Office of Naval Research\n\nCopyright © 2009.

Link, “Research, Science, and Technology Parks: An Overview of the Academic Literature,” in this volume. As Link notes these definitional characteristics are emphasized by President Mote of the University of Maryland and President Barker of Clemson University in their conference presentations. 12 Albert N.

For a survey of the literature, see Hans Löfsten and Peter Lindelöf, “Science Parks and the Growth of New Technology-based Firms—Academic-industry Links, Innovation and Markets,” Research Policy 31(6):859-876, August 2002.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al.

To enable these goals to be met, a Science Park stimulates and manages the flow of knowledge and technology amongst universities, R&D institutions, companies, and markets; it facilitates the creation and growth of innovation-based companies through incubation and spinoff processes; and provides other valueadded services together with high quality space and facilities.” 15 While this definition is comprehensive, the fact is that research parks around the world vary considerably in terms of their mission and scale. Their physical location can range from an exclusively urban settings—such as Singapore’s emerging Biopolis or the IIT-Madras Research Park in Chennai, India—to more spread out facilities—such as the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina—or even to very large sites like the Zhongguancun and Zhangjiang Science Parks in China. In practice, the terms “science park” and “technopole” are used most commonly in Europe, the term “technology park” is more prevalent in Asia, while the term “research park” is preferred in the United States and Canada.16 We use the term “research park” in this paper.\n\nBox D Understanding the Diversity of Research Parks “If you’ve seen one research park . . . you’ve seen one research park.”\n\nCopyright © 2009.

With support from the Economic Development Administration of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Professors Luger and Goldstein have recently updated their study. See M. Luger and H. A. Goldstein, Research Parks Redux: The Changing Landscape of the Garden, Washington, DC: U.S. Economic Development Administration, 2006. This update reflects the evolution of the perceived role of research parks over the past two decades. Reflecting the evolution of the role of research parks, the 1991 study focused on the distribution of park benefits among different groups in the population, while the 2006 study focuses on the capacity of research parks to stimulate innovation and regional development. 16 E.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n14\n\nUNDERSTANDING RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\nBox E Research Parks and the Nonlinearity of Innovation The term, “basic research” refers to the advancement of fundamental knowledge and the theoretical understanding of the relations among variables. A researcher’s curiosity, interest, and intuition often drive its exploratory nature. By contrast, the term “applied research” describes the use of accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific purpose. Thus separated, basic research logically precedes applied research, which in turn precedes the development of an idea into a practical application. This linear model of innovation (see Figure E-1) creates the misimpression that increasing public and private investments in research will automatically result in greater commercialization, strengthening, in turn, a nation’s competitiveness in global markets.a As Dr. Robert McMahan of the North Carolina Board of Science and Technology noted at the conference, academic R&D creates innovation capacity, but does not by itself raise economic output or create the fast-growing “gazelle” firms that spur new growth. In practice, distinctions between basic and applied research are often obscure, with the different stages of research intermixing frequently. (Figure E-2 shows a more complex “feedback model” of innovation.) This is particularly true for research and development in biotechnology and electronics, where fundamental research can be undertaken alongside work intended to develop new products. This can also be the case in areas where public- and private-sector partners collaborate in order to develop greater insight into areas of interest. In this regard, a key advantage of research parks is that they offer scientists, Basic Research\n\nApplied Research\n\nDevelopment\n\nCommercialization\n\nFIGURE E-1 A linear model of innovation.\n\nCopyright © 2009.

Westhead, “R&D ‘Inputs’ and ‘Outputs’ of Technology-based Firms Located In and Off ­Science Parks,” R&D Management 27(1):45-62, 1997. In addition to infrastructure investments in buildings and equipment and the employment of researchers and engineers, research parks often house incubation programs to provide resources that enhance the founding of new technology-based firms, although the effectiveness of these incubation programs vary. See K. F. Chan and T. Lau, “Assessing Technology Incubator Programs in the Science Park: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,” Technovation 25(10):1215-1228, October 2005. The authors find that the benefits required by technology founders at different stages of development are varied, and therefore, the general merits that are claimed by incubators as useful to technology start-ups are debatable.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al.

Inkpen and Wang Pien, “An Examination of Collaboration and Knowledge Transfer: China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park,” Journal of Management Studies 43(4):779-811, 2006.\n\nThe conference examined two important types of research parks—University Research Parks and Laboratory Research Parks—with both types seen as versatile and adaptable to differing missions and environments. University Research Parks Professors Albert Link and John Scott define a university research park as a “cluster of technology-based organizations that locate on or near a university campus in order to benefit from the university’s knowledge base and ongoing research. The university not only transfers knowledge but expects to develop knowledge more effectively given the association with the tenants in the research\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n16\n\nUNDERSTANDING RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\npark.”19 Highlighting their role in fostering regional development, AURP refers to university research parks as property-based ventures that promote a university’s research and development activities as well as local economic development.20 AURP believes that effective parks can aid in the transfer of technology and business skills between university and industry teams, encourage the creation of startups, and promote technology-led economic development for the community or region.21 Adding to a University’s Prestige Speaking at the conference, Professor Albert Link of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro noted that while parks gain knowledge and prestige from their university partners, the universities gain as well. Association with a successful park can bring multiple benefits to a university such as: • • • •\n\nHigher publication rates; More successful patenting activities; A greater ability to hire eminent scientists; and An ability to garner larger extramural grants.\n\nCopyright © 2009.

This also helps graduate students in science and engineering find employment following their degrees. As a result, the university as a whole becomes more interested in innovation. Faculty who mentor students are more attuned to the needs of industry. The change in the structure of the curriculum is reflected by improved student placements.22 19 Albert\n\nN. Link and John T.

Research universities are a key source of the fundamental scientific ­research that drives innovation, and this includes research in finance and economics and the dissemination of business methods. Most patent applications coming from industry research laboratories cite fundamental, exploratory research done at research universities. Research universities also produce the cadre of scientists and engineers who conduct research and development. They educate the workforce that brings innovation to fruition in commercial markets.

Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n17\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBox F Research Parks and the Missions of the 21st Century University The wealth and competitiveness of nations increasingly depends on their ability to convert new knowledge into products for the market. Universities have traditionally been devoted to the production of new knowledge and its dissemination through their mission to educate students. Universities have, in fact, always been active in both research and in its application. With the acceleration of knowledge-based competition by both established and emerging economies around the world, institutions of higher education increasingly find that they have no choice as to whether to be entrepreneurial or not. Indeed, the issue today for many of today’s university leaders more squarely concerns how the university can assist in accelerating the commercialization of new knowledge and the development of local economies.a One consequence of the conference was to highlight the growing role of research parks in helping universities balance their 21st century missions in education, research, and commercialization. aRobert E. Litan and Lesa Mitchell, “Should Universities be Agents of Economic Development?” Astra Briefs, Vol. 7, Nos. 7-8, Summer 2008.\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nExpanding the University’s Reach Dr. C. D. Mote, President of the University of Maryland, noted that a university research park is an “essential tool for institutions with an entrepreneurial and innovative culture that hoped to benefit from complicated partnerships on a global scale.” One need is the physical space and facilities afforded by a park that are not available on a university campus. Another is the need to be able to do proprietary or classified research, which is not easily done in an academic environment. 23 A third is the ability to accommodate a large off-campus work force to achieve the clustering, resonance, and mutual energy of people working and thinking together. Finally, a research park can uniquely bring in the many nonuniversity\n\nnization 21:1323-1356, November 2003. 23 This is a particularly important consideration for the University of Maryland, which is located near several federal agencies including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of Homeland Security, the National Security Administration, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, NASA, the Small Business Administration, and the National Archives. Some of these agencies conduct classified research, and many research universities have policies prohibiting classified research on campus, but not at affiliated research parks.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n18\n\nUNDERSTANDING RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\ninterests required by complex partnerships, including private industry services, security for confidential business activities, and government facilities. Such considerations, he noted, underlay the creation of M Square, the research park of the University of Maryland. M Square, he said, seeks to attract people who would benefit from being close to the university and who would bring benefits to the university as well. Asked about public policies needed to launch research parks like M Square successfully, Dr. Mote replied that timely investment in the startup phase is essential. Even though M Square had benefitted from research agreements with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the federal government’s Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity, he noted that prompt financial support from the state and federal government would have reduced startup difficulties and accelerated M Square’s progress. Promoting Research Collaboration In his conference keynote, President James Barker of Clemson University emphasized the role that research parks can play in promoting collaboration. There will always be “eureka moments” in the labs where scientists work, he said, but we are now discovering that collaboration can be a tremendous competitive advantage. He said that Clemson has worked hard to make collaboration a part of campus culture, including the establishment of the Clemson University—International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR) on a 250-acre campus. Four years ago CU-ICAR was 250 acres of undeveloped land along the I-85 corridor between Charlotte and Atlanta, with no master plan, no business plan, no curriculum, and no funding, he noted. Today CU-ICAR includes a 90,000-squarefoot graduate engineering center that has attracted world-class faculty who hold well-funded endowed chairs.\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press.

For example, as Dr. Phillip Phan noted in his remarks at the conference, university scientists have not traditionally viewed the commercialization of research as their priority, although this attitude has changed substantially in the past 20 years. 24 Incentives facing the tenants of a University Park and the research and commercialization missions of the university can also be misaligned. However, as in other collective human endeavors, these university-industry interactions can be improved through 24 The\n\npropensity of U.S. university faculty to work directly with industry on research activities that lead to patents is changing as incentive structures facing faculty change.

Rosenbaum, “Entrepreneurship and Human Capital: Evidence of Patenting Activity from the Academic Sector,” Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice 31(6):937-951, 2007.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n19\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBox G Aligning Incentives in a University Research Park: The IIT-Madras Credit System Addressing the issue of how to align the actions of the tenants of the research park with the objectives of the university, Dr. M. S. Ananth, Director of the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras (IIT-M), emphasized the importance of incentives that promote university-industry interaction. “Traditionally,” he said, “we have found that one of the problems in situating parks near campuses is that they focus only on the real estate and they don’t interact with the university. We are working hard to change that.” To address this challenge, Dr. Ananth has instituted a system of credits that tenants have to earn to remain in the IIT-M research park. Each company must earn a minimum number of credits by interacting with the university. The credit system, he noted, is designed to promote entrepreneurial activity, intersector interaction, and partnerships. Companies are given credits for participating in research and development projects with IIT-M, serving as consultants to IIT faculty, earning royalties, sponsoring doctoral and masters students, serving as adjunct faculty in order to teach and mentor graduate and undergraduate students, and providing part-time employment to students.\n\ndeveloping new rules of collaboration. Illustrating this point at the conference, Dr. M. S. Ananth, Director of the Indian Institute of Technology-Madras discussed how he has sought to align the incentives of research park tenants with IIT’s mission. (See Box G.)\n\nCopyright © 2009.

The United States government has made and continues to make substantial investments in the nation’s laboratories, which have developed a significant store of technology and talent; these laboratories have much to offer to the private sector. Moreover, the laboratories themselves recognize that they cannot fulfill their mission in isolation, especially given today’s rapid pace of innovation. To remain effective, laboratories such as Sandia, NASA Ames, and the National Cancer Institute understand that they must stay abreast of the rapid technological change taking place in the commercial arena. This means building and maintaining ties to the private sector. As leaders of these three laboratories noted in their conference presentations, one means of encouraging this mutually beneficial exchange has been through the development of research parks.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n20\n\nUNDERSTANDING RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\nStimulating Joint Research at Sandia Park New Mexico’s Sandia Science and Technology Park was founded in 1998 to attract industry in support of the mission of the Sandia National Laboratories. Drawing on the proximity to the exceptional expertise and infrastructure at Sandia, the goal of the park was to stimulate joint research and development opportunities, commercialize technologies, bring in new business, strengthen ­supplier-based “collaboratories,” and foster regional economic development. 25 According to Dr. Richard Stulen, Chief Technology Officer of Sandia Laboratories, the park is now home to 27 companies, 2,113 employees, 18 buildings, 897,000 square feet of occupied space, and 67 developed acres. Funds-in and in-kind services flowing from tenants to Sandia, such as Cooperative Research and Development Agreements (CRADAs) and licensing agreements, have totaled $17.6 million, and Department of Energy/Sandia in-kind services to tenants (CRADAs) have totaled $2.7 million.26 In the other direction, contracts from Sandia procurement to tenants amount to $244.5 million. “The funding goes both ways,” said Dr. Stulen. “This demonstrates what partnerships can do.”\n\nBox H The Importance of Champions “Parks don’t just happen. They require energy, devotion, passion from leaders— not only of the institution but also of the region.”\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nDr. Richard Stulen, Chief Technology Officer of Sandia National Laboratories\n\nSpeaking at the conference, Dr. Stulen emphasized that expertise and infrastructure are not sufficient to ensure the success of a research park. Successful laboratory-based parks also require one or more high-level champions, people who care and have the ability to direct resources continuously to the park. He praised Senators Domenici and Bingaman of New Mexico for that leadership as well as other political leaders at the state and local levels. Success for Sandia Park, he noted, is rooted in a variety of active public-private partnerships involving agencies at the federal, state, and county levels, as well as the leadership of the Sandia Park. 25 National\n\nResearch Council, Industry-Laboratory Partnerships: A Review of the Sandia Science and Technology Park Initiative, Charles W.

National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nSince 1998, NASA has sought to develop the NASA Research Park (NRP) with the goal of creating a world-class, shared-use science and technology campus for government, academia, nonprofits, and industry. Located in the heart of California’s Silicon Valley, NRP helps NASA achieve its mission by providing economical access to technological capabilities external to NASA. Some of the nation’s leading technology companies are neighbors to NRP, including Google, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, and Intel. The park’s goal is to draw in tacit knowledge from the exceptional technological and entrepreneurial community around Ames, while serving both as a source of trained personnel and as a conduit for laboratory innovations.27 According to the NASA Ames Center Director, Dr. Pete Worden, the park’s mission is also to generate revenue for the Ames Center, using an enhanced use leasing program to convert underutilized lands. Finally, the park is seen as a tool to raise political and public support for NASA by providing benefits to the local economy, public education, and the U.S. scientific base. “We want to boost NASA’s prominence before Congress and the public, strengthen community ties and investments, and broaden NASA’s relationships with industry.” Given the progress in achieving these goals, Dr. Worden sees the NRP as a successful initiative, one that continues to progress. The scale is significant. As Dr. Worden observes, “We already have more than 40 industry and 14 university partners onsite. We have several million square feet of old Navy facilities, including the dirigible hangers. We have many successful R&D collaborations and spinoffs, support from our congressional delegation and the U.S. government, a NASA-approved business plan, and an approved environmental plan.” The initial concept of the NASA Ames Park was reviewed by the National Academies’ STEP Board in 1999.28 The park has made great progress since then, exceeding expectations and enacting NASA’s plans with remarkable effectiveness. Accelerating Cancer Research at NCI-Frederick In his conference presentation, Director John Niederhuber of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) noted that the word “cancer” really refers to hundreds of diseases—including, for example, many types of breast cancers and many types of colon cancers—all genetically different. Understanding this complexity will 27 The National Research Council’s Board on Science, Technology, and Economic Policy, under the aegis of the Gordon Moore Committee, worked closely with the NASA leadership in providing a comprehensive review of the plans for the NRP and the challenges to be addressed. See National Research Council, A Review of the New Initiatives at the NASA Ames Research Center, Charles W. Wessner, ed., Washington, DC: National Academy Press, 2001. 28 National Research Council, Industry-Laboratory Partnerships: A Review of the Sandia Science and Technology Park Initiative, op. cit.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n22\n\nUNDERSTANDING RESEARCH, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PARKS\n\nrequire more knowledge about genetic changes and differences than about the organ site. To cope with the growing research intensity of modern cancer studies, he said, NCI is developing a research park close to its NCI-Frederick campus in Maryland to bring together researchers and practitioners, thus creating a wider knowledge base and greater opportunities for industry partners to develop marketable applications of research.29 Dr. Niederhuber listed the specific advantages of a research park for NCI. First, he noted that some 82 percent of the NCI budget is spent extramurally to support research at research universities. The Institute has realized that it could make this spending even more effective by creating a science and technology research park close to the Frederick campus. Second, the proximity of the campus would allow NCI to improve productivity and reduce the costs of drug development and diagnostics. Third, a park might enable execution of larger and more complex experiments and provide a better environment for training the next generation of people to work in cancer-related technology development. Finally, he noted, a research park can offer incubator and think-tank space to integrate the work of multiple companies and research teams with significant R&D programs in engineering, software, and imaging. To bring this plan into reality, NCI is negotiating with developers to create a park of about 230,000 square feet. According to the plan, NCI will be the anchor of the park, but it will support the broader mission of technology development for biological research. Research Parks and Economic Growth\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nIn addition to their role in advancing the research and commercialization missions of universities and national laboratories, research parks are widely seen as catalysts for the development of innovative clusters that support rapid economic growth.30 Developing Clusters of Innovation The observation that firms tend to group together to profit from shared expertise and services and the development of mutual trust has encouraged interest in fostering industry clusters to enhance regional development. Examining industrial clusters from the perspective of business strategy, Professor Michael Porter has pointed out that “the enduring competitive advantages in a global economy lie 29 Established in 1971 by President Nixon, NCI-Frederick was established as a rapid response site to develop new technologies to support the “War on Cancer.” It was given FFRDC status in 1975, which allows NCI to establish contractual relationships in streamlined fashion. Of the 38 FFRDCs, NCI-Fredrick is the only one devoted to biological research. 30 E. J. Malecki, Technology and Economic Development, op. cit.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n23\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nincreasingly in local things—knowledge, relationships, motivation—that distant rivals cannot match.”31 Moreover, as Professor AnnaLee Saxenian has explained, greater geographic proximity encourages repeated interaction that helps build the mutual trust needed to sustain cooperation and speed the continual recombination of knowledge and skill. The importance of trust emerging through repeated faceto-face interactions has led Professor Saxenian to observe that “paradoxically, regions offer an important source of competitive advantage even as production and markets become increasingly global.”32 In the United States, such clusters have often developed around a ­governmentfunded nucleus; one example is the high-technology industries that emerged and grew around the government laboratories and major universities in the Boston area. In other cases (e.g., Silicon Valley) multiple private industries interacting with a major university, and irrigated with substantial and sustained federal funding, created powerful developmental synergies.33 In contrast to the relatively spontaneous emergence of these innovation clusters, a third approach to the development of innovation clusters is through the deliberate creation of research parks.34 The co-location of creative activity within the concentrated geographical area of a research park can help create a “community of innovation” needed to transfer new ideas from universities and national laboratories to the marketplace.35 Today, successfully created innovation clusters, such as North Carolina’s Research Triangle, are being emulated around the world, often on a larger scale.\n\nCopyright © 2009.

Research parks are often adopted as one tool to restore a region’s vitality. One example is the Manchester Science Park (MSP) in the United Kingdom, which was created explicitly with the goal of stimulating the regional economy and creating jobs. Manchester was badly weakened by the downturn in manufacturing of the 1980s, suffering job losses and economic distress. In her conference presentation, Ms. Jane Davies of MSP noted that representatives of Manchester government, the university, and the commercial sector, drew specifically on the model of Research Triangle Park in proposing a new science park for their city, raising an initial capital investment of 210,000 Pounds. Indeed, North Carolina’s Research Triangle Park is seen widely as a successful example of how a research park can reverse the fortunes of a region faced with economic decline and a shrinking job base due to decreasing manufacturing concentrations.36 Describing the long-term economic impact of the Research Triangle Park on the regional economy, Mr. Rick Weddle, president of the Research Triangle Foundation, noted that the per capita income growth in Raleigh-Cary and Durham were far below the state average and national averages before the park was formed. In contrast, he noted, the per capita income of the region today significantly exceeds the U.S. average and far exceeds the North Carolina average. “In the 1960s it was one of the poorest regions in the southeastern United States, and today is among the wealthiest regions in the southeast.” Employment growth began at Research Triangle Park in the mid-1960s, a time when less than 12 percent of the employment in the region was in hightech industries. After climbing slowly to around 10,000 jobs in the 1970s, the employee population grew rapidly during the 1980s and has continued to grow since then. Mr. Weddle projected continued growth to about 45,000 science and technology jobs in the park by 2016, spread among some 160 high-technology firms. This Research Triangle Park example of regional initiative, backed by a sustained commitment of resources and interest, buttressed by effective leadership, and—above all—coordinated through effective public-private partnering, is a model for the efforts of many countries to generate the dynamic new firms that will provide the growth and jobs of the future. Support for Parks around the World Science parks, in their many different forms, now exist in most parts of the world and are seen as a proven policy tool to spur economic growth and enhance technological competitiveness. To this end, as Senator Bingaman noted in his 36 For\n\na comprehensive history of RTP, see Albert N. Link, A Generosity of Spirit: The Early History of the Research Triangle Park, op. cit.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al. Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks : Global Best Practices: Report of a\n\n25\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nkeynote address, they benefit from significant financial and policy support from national and state governments. The United States remains an exception in this regard, where support for research parks is principally undertaken by state and local governments with only limited participation by the federal government. While many state governments are experimenting with technology zones to support research parks and technology incubators, and to increase technology-led economic development clusters, some advocates believe that the U.S. government should pursue a more comprehensive strategy to capture the potential benefits of research parks for economic growth and national competitiveness.37 Reflecting this growing interest, the conference reviewed the scale and mechanisms of support for a variety of research parks from around the world. China’s Support for Parks\n\nCopyright © 2009. National Academies Press. All rights reserved.\n\nChina is frequently seen as one of the foremost practitioners of the research parks strategy for economic and regional development. China’s large science and technology industrial parks symbolize that nation’s strong determination to grow and become internationally competitive through significant national and ­ regional investments in science-based economic development.38 A central theme of ­ China’s recent Five Year Plans has economic development driven by technological progress, and large-scale research parks are a widely used mechanism to carry out this goal.39 (See Figure 1.) Both the absolute number and scale of Chinese research parks are remarkable. China’s 54 state-level science and technology industrial parks are designed to help develop the industrial base for rising industries in electronics and information technology, new materials, and biomedicine. Aggressive intervention by national and local governments to create and grow large-scale research parks are a hallmark of Chinese policy. The state’s role\n\n37 See Association of University Research Parks, “The Power of Place: A National Strategy for Building America’s Communities of Innovation,” Tucson, AZ: Association of University Research Parks, 2008.

Walcott distinguishes three types of research parks in China. Perhaps the most well known are the multinational development zones such Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Suzhou, which emphasize the role of transnational corporations as growth engines. Another type is the multinational learning zones of which Shanghai is considered a leading example. Lastly, local innovation learning zones rely more on domestically generated technology with some interactions with foreign companies. Examples include Xian, which draws heavily on local university resources and China’s defense production industry. 39 Kazuyuki Motohashi and Xiao Yun, “China’s Innovation System Reform and Growing Industry and Science Linkages,” Research Policy 36:1251-1260, 2007.\n\nNational, Research Council, et al.
