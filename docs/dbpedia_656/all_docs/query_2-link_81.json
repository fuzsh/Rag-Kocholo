        "text": "A woman in Dallas County, Texas, has died after being diagnosed with West Nile virus.\n\nThe patient, whose name and age were not released, contracted a severe neuroinvasive form of the disease, according to a Tuesday press release from the Dallas County Health and Human Services (DCHHS).\n\nThe female patient had \"underlying health issues,\" officials stated.\n\nLISTERIA INFECTION LINKED TO DELI MEATS KILLS 2, INFECTS 28 ACROSS US, CDC WARNS\n\nThis was the county’s first West Nile death in 2024.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by this loss,\" said Dr. Philip Huang, director of DCHHS, in the release.\n\n\"This heartbreaking tragedy underscores the critical importance of safeguarding against mosquito bites, which can transmit several diseases, including West Nile virus.\"\n\nWhat to know about West Nile\n\nSince the West Nile virus first entered the U.S. in 1999, it has become the leading cause of mosquito-borne disease in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nIn most cases, the West Nile virus — a flavivirus in the same family as yellow fever, dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis and the Zika virus — is spread when Culex mosquitoes bite infected birds and then bite people and other animals, per the CDC’s website.\n\nIN A POTENTIAL OUTBREAK, IS BIRD FLU TESTING AVAILABLE FOR HUMANS? WHAT TO KNOW\n\nThe virus is not transmitted through eating or handling infected animals or birds — nor is it spread through physical contact, coughing or sneezing.\n\nA vast majority — around 80% — of the people who contract the virus will not experience any symptoms, the CDC states on its website.\n\n\"It causes a rash and other symptoms, including swollen lymph nodes, which other viruses in its class do not exhibit,\" Dr. Marc Siegel, senior medical analyst for Fox News and clinical professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"It only affects the nervous system 1% of the time and is rarely fatal.\"\n\nIN COLORADO, PLAGUE CASE CONFIRMED IN HUMAN, HEALTH OFFICIALS SAY: ‘MUST BE TREATED PROMPTLY’\n\nAround one in five people will develop febrile illness, which is marked by a fever along with body aches, headache, joint pain, diarrhea, rash and/or vomiting.\n\nThese symptoms usually go away on their own, but some people may have lingering weakness and fatigue months after infection.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn rare cases — about one in every 150 infected people — the virus can lead to serious conditions affecting the nervous system, such as encephalitis (inflammation of the brain) or meningitis (inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord), the CDC states on its website.\n\nThose who develop serious illness may experience headache, stiff neck, high fever, disorientation, vision loss, muscle weakness, convulsions, tremors, coma or paralysis, which occur when there is viral infection of the central nervous system.\n\nAmong people who have this invasive form of the illness, around 10% will die.\n\n\"It affects the nervous system 1% of the time and is rarely fatal.\"\n\nWhile anyone can potentially develop severe illness, the highest-risk groups include those over 60 years of age, people who have had organ transplants and those with diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure, kidney disease, immune disorders and other certain medical conditions.\n\n\"The virus’ effects can be quite serious in the elderly,\" Siegel noted.\n\nDiagnosis and treatment\n\nThose who think they might have been infected with WNV should be assessed by a health care provider, the CDC states.\n\nDiagnosis of the infection can be made based on evaluation of symptoms, recent exposure to mosquitoes and testing of blood or spinal fluid.\n\nOUTBREAK OF KLEBSIELLA PNEUMONIAE BACTERIA INFECTS 31 PATIENTS AT SEATTLE HOSPITAL\n\nHealth care providers will typically recommend treating symptoms with over-the-counter pain medications and getting plenty of rest and fluids.\n\nThose who experience severe illness may need to be hospitalized for supportive care.\n\nAs of Aug. 6, there were 103 West Nile virus cases in the U.S. across 26 states, per the CDC.\n\nSixty-eight of those cases were neuroinvasive (severe).\n\nPreventing the virus\n\nThere is currently no vaccine for West Nile virus.\n\n\"The virus can be contained through public health measures including more insect repellent with DEET, longer sleeves and less stagnant water in our backyards,\" Siegel said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\nTrying to kill adult mosquitoes by spreading too much insecticide can be problematic, the doctor warned.\n\n\"Animals, people with asthma and insects that would otherwise kill the mosquitoes are affected.\"\n\nDallas County health officials are urging local residents to take steps to protect themselves amid high mosquito activity, emphasizing the importance of the \"four Ds\" outlined below.\n\nDEET: When spending time outdoors, people should apply insect repellent containing DEET or other EPA-approved ingredients.\n\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews/health\n\nDress: Minimize exposed skin by wearing long, loose clothing, officials recommend.\n\nDrain: Eliminating any standing water can help prevent mosquitoes from breeding."
