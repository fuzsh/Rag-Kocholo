A written directive may be in the following form:\n\nDIRECTIVE TO PHYSICIANS AND FAMILY OR SURROGATES\n\nInstructions for completing this document:\n\nThis is an important legal document known as an Advance Directive. It is designed to help you communicate your wishes about medical treatment at some time in the future when you are unable to make your wishes known because of illness or injury. These wishes are usually based on personal values. In particular, you may want to consider what burdens or hardships of treatment you would be willing to accept for a particular amount of benefit obtained if you were seriously ill.\n\nYou are encouraged to discuss your values and wishes with your family or chosen spokesperson, as well as your physician. Your physician, other health care provider, or medical institution may provide you with various resources to assist you in completing your advance directive. Brief definitions are listed below and may aid you in your discussions and advance planning. Initial the treatment choices that best reflect your personal preferences. Provide a copy of your directive to your physician, usual hospital, and family or spokesperson. Consider a periodic review of this document. By periodic review, you can best assure that the directive reflects your preferences.\n\nIn addition to this advance directive, Texas law provides for two other types of directives that can be important during a serious illness. These are the Medical Power of Attorney and the Out-of-Hospital Do-Not-Resuscitate Order. You may wish to discuss these with your physician, family, hospital representative, or other advisers. You may also wish to complete a directive related to the donation of organs and tissues.\n\nDIRECTIVE\n\nI, __________, recognize that the best health care is based upon a partnership of trust and communication with my physician. My physician and I will make health care or treatment decisions together as long as I am of sound mind and able to make my wishes known. If there comes a time that I am unable to make medical decisions about myself because of illness or injury, I direct that the following treatment preferences be honored:\n\nIf, in the judgment of my physician, I am suffering with a terminal condition from which I am expected to die within six months, even with available life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of medical care:\n\n__________I request that all treatments other than those needed to keep me comfortable be discontinued or withheld and my physician allow me to die as gently as possible; OR__________I request that I be kept alive in this terminal condition using available life-sustaining treatment. (THIS SELECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO HOSPICE CARE.)\n\nIf, in the judgment of my physician, I am suffering with an irreversible condition so that I cannot care for myself or make decisions for myself and am expected to die without life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of care:\n\n__________I request that all treatments other than those needed to keep me comfortable be discontinued or withheld and my physician allow me to die as gently as possible; OR__________I request that I be kept alive in this irreversible condition using available life-sustaining treatment. (THIS SELECTION DOES NOT APPLY TO HOSPICE CARE.)\n\nAdditional requests: (After discussion with your physician, you may wish to consider listing particular treatments in this space that you do or do not want in specific circumstances, such as artificially administered nutrition and hydration, intravenous antibiotics, etc. Be sure to state whether you do or do not want the particular treatment.)\n\nAfter signing this directive, if my representative or I elect hospice care, I understand and agree that only those treatments needed to keep me comfortable would be provided and I would not be given available life-sustaining treatments.\n\nIf I do not have a Medical Power of Attorney, and I am unable to make my wishes known, I designate the following person(s) to make health care or treatment decisions with my physician compatible with my personal values:\n\n1. __________\n\n2. __________\n\n(If a Medical Power of Attorney has been executed, then an agent already has been named and you should not list additional names in this document.)\n\nIf the above persons are not available, or if I have not designated a spokesperson, I understand that a spokesperson will be chosen for me following standards specified in the laws of Texas. If, in the judgment of my physician, my death is imminent within minutes to hours, even with the use of all available medical treatment provided within the prevailing standard of care, I acknowledge that all treatments may be withheld or removed except those needed to maintain my comfort. I understand that under Texas law this directive has no effect if I have been diagnosed as pregnant. This directive will remain in effect until I revoke it. No other person may do so.\n\nSigned__________ Date__________ City, County, State of Residence __________\n\nTwo competent adult witnesses must sign below, acknowledging the signature of the declarant. The witness designated as Witness 1 may not be a person designated to make a health care or treatment decision for the patient and may not be related to the patient by blood or marriage. This witness may not be entitled to any part of the estate and may not have a claim against the estate of the patient. This witness may not be the attending physician or an employee of the attending physician. If this witness is an employee of a health care facility in which the patient is being cared for, this witness may not be involved in providing direct patient care to the patient. This witness may not be an officer, director, partner, or business office employee of a health care facility in which the patient is being cared for or of any parent organization of the health care facility.\n\nWitness 1 __________ Witness 2 __________\n\nDefinitions:\n\n\"Artificially administered nutrition and hydration\" means the provision of nutrients or fluids by a tube inserted in a vein, under the skin in the subcutaneous tissues, or in the gastrointestinal tract.\n\n\"Irreversible condition\" means a condition, injury, or illness:\n\n(1) that may be treated, but is never cured or eliminated;\n\n(2) that leaves a person unable to care for or make decisions for the person's own self; and\n\n(3) that, without life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with the prevailing standard of medical care, is fatal.\n\nExplanation: Many serious illnesses such as cancer, failure of major organs (kidney, heart, liver, or lung), and serious brain disease such as Alzheimer's dementia may be considered irreversible early on. There is no cure, but the patient may be kept alive for prolonged periods of time if the patient receives life-sustaining treatments. Late in the course of the same illness, the disease may be considered terminal when, even with treatment, the patient is expected to die. You may wish to consider which burdens of treatment you would be willing to accept in an effort to achieve a particular outcome. This is a very personal decision that you may wish to discuss with your physician, family, or other important persons in your life.\n\n\"Life-sustaining treatment\" means treatment that, based on reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient and without which the patient will die. The term includes both life-sustaining medications and artificial life support such as mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and artificially administered nutrition and hydration. The term does not include the administration of pain management medication, the performance of a medical procedure necessary to provide comfort care, or any other medical care provided to alleviate a patient's pain.\n\n\"Terminal condition\" means an incurable condition caused by injury, disease, or illness that according to reasonable medical judgment will produce death within six months, even with available life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with the prevailing standard of medical care.\n\nExplanation: Many serious illnesses may be considered irreversible early in the course of the illness, but they may not be considered terminal until the disease is fairly advanced. In thinking about terminal illness and its treatment, you again may wish to consider the relative benefits and burdens of treatment and discuss your wishes with your physician, family, or other important persons in your life.\n\nActs 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 678, Sec. 1, eff. Sept. 1, 1989. Amended by Acts 1991, 72nd Leg., ch. 14, Sec. 209, eff. Sept. 1, 1991; Acts 1997, 75th Leg., ch. 291, Sec. 2, eff. Jan. 1, 1998.

The attending physician may not be a member of that committee during the review.

For purposes of this section, a decision by the committee based on any of the considerations described by Subdivisions (1) through (5) is not a judgment on the patient's quality of life. If the review requires the committee to determine whether life-sustaining treatment requested in the patient's advance directive or by the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions is medically inappropriate, the committee shall consider whether provision of the life-sustaining treatment:\n\n(1) will prolong the natural process of dying or hasten the patient's death;\n\n(2) will result in substantial, irremediable, and objectively measurable physical pain that is not outweighed by the benefit of providing the treatment;\n\n(3) is medically contraindicated such that the provision of the treatment seriously exacerbates life-threatening medical problems not outweighed by the benefit of providing the treatment;\n\n(4) is consistent with the prevailing standard of care; or\n\n(5) is contrary to the patient's clearly documented desires.\n\n(b) The person responsible for the patient's health care decisions:\n\n(1) shall be informed in writing not less than seven calendar days before the meeting called to discuss the patient's directive, unless the period is waived by written mutual agreement, of:\n\n(A) the ethics or medical committee review process and any other related policies and procedures adopted by the health care facility, including any policy described by Subsection (b-1);\n\n(B) the rights described in Subdivisions (3)(A)-(D);\n\n(C) the date, time, and location of the meeting;\n\n(D) the work contact information of the facility's personnel who, in the event of a disagreement, will be responsible for overseeing the reasonable effort to transfer the patient to another physician or facility willing to comply with the directive;\n\n(E) the factors the committee is required to consider under Subsection (a-2); and\n\n(F) the language in Section 166.0465;\n\n(2) at the time of being informed under Subdivision (1), shall be provided:\n\n(A) a copy of the appropriate statement set forth in Section 166.052; and\n\n(B) a copy of the registry list of health care providers and referral groups that have volunteered their readiness to consider accepting transfer or to assist in locating a provider willing to accept transfer that is posted on the website maintained by the department under Section 166.053;

and\n\n(ii) have an opportunity during the open portion of the meeting to either directly or through another individual attending the meeting:\n\n(a) explain the justification for the health care or treatment request made by or on behalf of the patient;\n\n(b) respond to information relating to the patient that is submitted or presented during the open portion of the meeting; and\n\n(c) state any concerns of the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions regarding compliance with this section or Section 166.0465, including stating an opinion that one or more of the patient's disabilities are not relevant to the committee's determination of whether the medical or surgical intervention is medically appropriate;\n\n(D) receive a written notice of:\n\n(i) the decision reached during the review process accompanied by an explanation of the decision, including, if applicable, the committee's reasoning for affirming that requested life-sustaining treatment is medically inappropriate;\n\n(ii) the patient's major medical conditions as identified by the committee, including any disability of the patient considered by the committee in reaching the decision, except the notice is not required to specify whether any medical condition qualifies as a disability;\n\n(iii) a statement that the committee has complied with Subsection (a-2) and Section 166.0465; and\n\n(iv) the health care facilities contacted before the meeting as part of the transfer efforts under Subsection (d) and, for each listed facility that denied the request to transfer the patient and provided a reason for the denial, the provided reason;\n\n(E) receive a copy of or electronic access to the portion of the patient's medical record related to the treatment received by the patient in the facility for the period of the patient's current admission to the facility; and\n\n(F) receive a copy of or electronic access to all of the patient's reasonably available diagnostic results and reports related to the medical record provided under Paragraph (E).\n\n(b-1) A health care facility may adopt and implement a written policy for meetings held under this section that is reasonable and necessary to:\n\n(1) facilitate information sharing and discussion of the patient's medical status and treatment requirements, including provisions related to attendance, confidentiality, and timing regarding any agenda item;

or\n\n(2) the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions or any person attending the meeting under Subsection (b)(3)(C)(i).\n\n(b-3) If the health care facility or person responsible for the patient's health care decisions intends to have legal counsel attend the meeting of the ethics or medical committee, the facility or person, as applicable, shall make a good faith effort to provide written notice of that intention not less than 48 hours before the meeting begins.\n\n(c) The written notice required by Subsection (b)(3)(D)(i) must be included in the patient's medical record.\n\n(d) After written notice is provided under Subsection (b)(1), the patient's attending physician shall make a reasonable effort to transfer the patient to a physician who is willing to comply with the directive. The health care facility's personnel shall assist the physician in arranging the patient's transfer to:\n\n(1) another physician;\n\n(2) an alternative care setting within that facility; or\n\n(3) another facility.\n\n(d-1) If another health care facility denies the patient's transfer request, the personnel of the health care facility assisting with the patient's transfer efforts under Subsection (d) shall make a good faith effort to inquire whether the facility that denied the patient's transfer request would be more likely to approve the transfer request if a medical procedure, as that term is defined in this section, is performed on the patient.\n\n(d-2) If the patient's advance directive or the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions is requesting life-sustaining treatment that the attending physician has decided and the ethics or medical committee has affirmed is medically inappropriate:\n\n(1) the attending physician or another physician responsible for the care of the patient shall perform on the patient each medical procedure that satisfies all of the following conditions:\n\n(A) in the attending physician's judgment, the medical procedure is reasonable and necessary to help effect the patient's transfer under Subsection (d);\n\n(B) an authorized representative for another health care facility with the ability to comply with the patient's advance directive or the health care or treatment decision made by or on behalf of the patient has expressed to the personnel described by Subsection (b)(1)(D) or the attending physician that the facility is more likely to accept the patient's transfer to the other facility if the medical procedure is performed on the patient;\n\n(C) in the medical judgment of the physician who would perform the medical procedure, performing the medical procedure is:\n\n(i) within the prevailing standard of medical care; and\n\n(ii) not medically contraindicated or medically inappropriate under the circumstances;\n\n(D) in the medical judgment of the physician who would perform the medical procedure, the physician has the training and experience to perform the medical procedure;\n\n(E) the physician who would perform the medical procedure has medical privileges at the facility where the patient is receiving care authorizing the physician to perform the medical procedure at the facility;\n\n(F) the facility where the patient is receiving care has determined the facility has the resources for the performance of the medical procedure at the facility; and\n\n(G) the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions provides consent on behalf of the patient for the medical procedure; and\n\n(2) the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions is entitled to receive:\n\n(A) a delay notice:\n\n(i) if, at the time the written decision is provided as required by Subsection (b)(3)(D)(i), a medical procedure satisfies all of the conditions described by Subdivision (1); or\n\n(ii) if:\n\n(a) at the time the written decision is provided as required by Subsection (b)(3)(D)(i), a medical procedure satisfies all of the conditions described by Subdivision (1) except Subdivision (1)(G); and\n\n(b) the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions provides to the attending physician or another physician or health care professional providing direct care to the patient consent on behalf of the patient for the medical procedure within 24 hours of the request for consent;\n\n(B) a start notice:\n\n(i) if, at the time the written decision is provided as required by Subsection (b)(3)(D)(i), no medical procedure satisfies all of the conditions described by Subdivisions (1)(A) through (F); or\n\n(ii) if:\n\n(a) at the time the written decision is provided as required by Subsection (b)(3)(D)(i), a medical procedure satisfies all of the conditions described by Subdivision (1) except Subdivision (1)(G); and\n\n(b) the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions does not provide to the attending physician or another physician or health care professional providing direct care to the patient consent on behalf of the patient for the medical procedure within 24 hours of the request for consent; and\n\n(C) a start notice accompanied by a statement that one or more of the conditions described by Subdivisions (1)(A) through (G) are no longer satisfied if, after a delay notice is provided in accordance with Subdivision (2)(A) and before the medical procedure on which the delay notice is based is performed on the patient, one or more of those conditions are no longer satisfied.\n\n(d-3) After the 25-day period described by Subsection (e) begins, the period may not be suspended or stopped for any reason. This subsection does not limit or affect a court's ability to order an extension of the period in accordance with Subsection (g). Subsection (d-2) does not require a medical procedure to be performed on the patient after the expiration of the 25-day period.\n\n(e) If the patient's advance directive or the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions is requesting life-sustaining treatment that the attending physician has decided and the ethics or medical committee has affirmed is medically inappropriate treatment, the patient shall be given available life-sustaining treatment pending transfer under Subsection (d). This subsection does not authorize withholding or withdrawing pain management medication, medical interventions necessary to provide comfort, or any other health care provided to alleviate a patient's pain. The patient is responsible for any costs incurred in transferring the patient to another health care facility. The attending physician, any other physician responsible for the care of the patient, and the health care facility are not obligated to provide life-sustaining treatment after the 25th calendar day after a start notice is provided in accordance with Subsection (d-2)(2)(B) or (C) to the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions or a medical procedure for which a delay notice was provided in accordance with Subsection (d-2)(2)(A) is performed, whichever occurs first, unless ordered to extend the 25-day period under Subsection (g), except that artificially administered nutrition and hydration must be provided unless, based on reasonable medical judgment, providing artificially administered nutrition and hydration would:\n\n(1) hasten the patient's death;\n\n(2) be medically contraindicated such that the provision of the treatment seriously exacerbates life-threatening medical problems not outweighed by the benefit of providing the treatment;\n\n(3) result in substantial, irremediable, and objectively measurable physical pain not outweighed by the benefit of providing the treatment;\n\n(4) be medically ineffective in prolonging life; or\n\n(5) be contrary to the patient's or surrogate's clearly documented desire not to receive artificially administered nutrition or hydration.\n\n(e-1) If during a previous admission to a facility a patient's attending physician and the review process under Subsection (b) have determined that life-sustaining treatment is inappropriate, and the patient is readmitted to the same facility within six months from the date of the decision reached during the review process conducted upon the previous admission, Subsections (b) through (e) need not be followed if the patient's attending physician and a consulting physician who is a member of the ethics or medical committee of the facility document on the patient's readmission that the patient's condition either has not improved or has deteriorated since the review process was conducted.\n\n(f) Life-sustaining treatment under this section may not be entered in the patient's medical record as medically unnecessary treatment until the time period provided under Subsection (e) has expired.\n\n(g) At the request of the person responsible for the patient's health care decisions, the appropriate district or county court shall extend the period provided under Subsection (e) only if the court finds, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a reasonable expectation that a physician or health care facility that will honor the patient's directive will be found if the time extension is granted.\n\n(h) This section may not be construed to impose an obligation on a facility or a home and community support services agency licensed under Chapter 142 or similar organization that is beyond the scope of the services or resources of the facility or agency.

(a) In cases in which the attending physician refuses to honor an advance directive or health care or treatment decision requesting the provision of life-sustaining treatment for a patient who is determined to be incompetent or is otherwise mentally or physically incapable of communication, the statement required by Section 166.046(b)(2)(A) shall be in substantially the following form:\n\nWhen There Is A Disagreement About Medical Treatment: The Physician Recommends Against Certain Life-Sustaining Treatment That You Wish To Continue\n\nYou have been given this information because the patient has requested through an advance directive or you have requested on behalf of the patient that life-sustaining treatment* be provided to the patient, which the attending physician believes is not medically appropriate. This information is being provided to help you understand state law, your rights, and the resources available to you in such circumstances. It outlines the process for resolving disagreements about treatment among patients, families, and physicians. It is based upon Section 166.046 of the Texas Advance Directives Act, codified in Chapter 166, Texas Health and Safety Code.\n\nWhen an attending physician refuses to comply with an advance directive or other request for life-sustaining treatment for a patient who is determined to be incompetent or is otherwise mentally or physically incapable of communication because of the physician's judgment that the treatment would be medically inappropriate, the case will be reviewed by an ethics or medical committee. Life-sustaining treatment will be provided through the review.\n\nYou will receive notification of this review at least seven calendar days before a meeting of the committee related to your case. You are entitled to attend the meeting. With your agreement, the meeting may be held sooner than seven calendar days, if possible.\n\nYou are entitled to receive a written explanation of the decision reached during the review process.\n\nIf after this review process both the attending physician and the ethics or medical committee conclude that life-sustaining treatment is medically inappropriate and yet you continue to request such treatment, then the following procedure will occur:\n\n1. The physician, with the help of the health care facility, will assist you in trying to find a physician and facility willing to provide the requested treatment.\n\n2. You are being given a list of health care providers, licensed physicians, health care facilities, and referral groups that have volunteered their readiness to consider accepting transfer, or to assist in locating a provider willing to accept transfer, maintained by the Department of State Health Services. You may wish to contact providers, facilities, or referral groups on the list or others of your choice to get help in arranging a transfer.\n\n3. The patient will continue to be given life-sustaining treatment until the patient can be transferred to a willing provider for up to 25 calendar days from the time you were given a written notice of the first day of the 25-day period or a medical procedure is performed that delayed the 25-day period and for which you received notice, whichever occurs first. The patient will continue to be given after the 25-day period treatment to enhance pain management and reduce suffering, including artificially administered nutrition and hydration, unless, based on reasonable medical judgment, providing artificially administered nutrition and hydration would hasten the patient's death, be medically contraindicated such that the provision of the treatment seriously exacerbates life-threatening medical problems not outweighed by the benefit of the provision of the treatment, result in substantial irremediable physical pain not outweighed by the benefit of the provision of the treatment, be medically ineffective in prolonging life, or be contrary to the patient's or surrogate's clearly documented desires.\n\n4. If a transfer can be arranged, the patient will be responsible for the costs of the transfer.\n\n5. If a provider cannot be found willing to give the requested treatment within 25 calendar days, life-sustaining treatment may be withdrawn unless a court of law has granted an extension.\n\n6. You may ask the appropriate district or county court to extend the 25-day period if the court finds that there is a reasonable expectation that you may find a physician or health care facility willing to provide life-sustaining treatment if the extension is granted. Patient medical records will be provided to the patient or surrogate in accordance with Section 241.154, Texas Health and Safety Code.\n\n*\"Life-sustaining treatment\" means treatment that, based on reasonable medical judgment, sustains the life of a patient and without which the patient will die. The term includes both life-sustaining medications and artificial life support, such as mechanical breathing machines, kidney dialysis treatment, and artificially administered nutrition and hydration. The term does not include the administration of pain management medication or the performance of a medical procedure considered to be necessary to provide comfort care, or any other medical care provided to alleviate a patient's pain.\n\n(b) In cases in which the attending physician refuses to comply with an advance directive or a health care or treatment decision requesting the withholding or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment for a patient who is determined to be incompetent or is otherwise mentally or physically incapable of communication, the statement required by Section 166.046(b)(2)(A) shall be in substantially the following form:\n\nWhen There Is A Disagreement About Medical Treatment: The Physician Recommends Life-Sustaining Treatment That You Wish To Stop\n\nYou have been given this information because the patient has requested through an advance directive or you have requested on behalf of the patient that life-sustaining treatment* be withdrawn or withheld from the patient, and the attending physician disagrees with and refuses to comply with that request. The information is being provided to help you understand state law, your rights, and the resources available to you in such circumstances. It outlines the process for resolving disagreements about treatment among patients, families, and physicians. It is based upon Section 166.046 of the Texas Advance Directives Act, codified in Chapter 166, Texas Health and Safety Code.\n\nWhen an attending physician refuses to comply with an advance directive or other request for withdrawal or withholding of life-sustaining treatment for any reason, the case will be reviewed by an ethics or medical committee. Life-sustaining treatment will be provided through the review.\n\nYou will receive notification of this review at least seven calendar days before a meeting of the committee related to your case. You are entitled to attend the meeting. With your agreement, the meeting may be held sooner than seven calendar days, if possible.\n\nYou are entitled to receive a written explanation of the decision reached during the review process.\n\nIf you or the attending physician do not agree with the decision reached during the review process, and the attending physician still refuses to comply with your request to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment, then the following procedure will occur:\n\n1. The physician, with the help of the health care facility, will assist you in trying to find a physician and facility willing to withdraw or withhold the life-sustaining treatment.\n\n2. You are being given a list of health care providers, licensed physicians, health care facilities, and referral groups that have volunteered their readiness to consider accepting transfer, or to assist in locating a provider willing to accept transfer, maintained by the Department of State Health Services.
