        "text": "Edward Baker:\n\nI have had a number of mentors in my life, but Edward Baker was also a long time friend, teacher, and exemplified a human being. I say this as best I can reflecting on the Native American reference to themselves as human beings, part of a tribe, struggling, looking at the comings and goings of events perhaps perplexed at the craziness around them. He was a human being, his life experience could have produced bitterness and much decay. He may have faltered occasionally, but he always gave sincerely and generously. Ed might have been a cynic, but knew bitter and what was outside it; he got over it. He would rise every morning before dawn and meditate, or walk as he would describe it. He was plodding and deliberate. He was provocative, and annoying at times. He was a patriot, but cynical about the workings of government. He served his country, rode conventional submarines for seven years, and taught at Orlando Navel Training Center as a Torpedo Instructor.\n\nHe once said to me, \"Ralph, I have scars on my soul that I couldn't scrub away with a wire brush, but, he intimated the Navy is very forgiving of some things. He also lamented that he earned every grade twice, except for Chief.\" He was awarded the coveted Sailor of The Year Award just after Zumwalt initiated the program in 1973. Knowing him outside the Navy, one would not think he could be so strack.\n\nHe would disassemble ideas like he did his art. His process was unique, it had a garish finality and truth when complete. It was primitive, sometimes awkward, but completely expressive and entirely sincere.\n\nOver the years I saw him go back to school, learn philosophy and art. It was a remarkable process. He created with a sincere cynicism that would alert many knowing the artifice of human creativity. He Bakerised everything chewing on morsels as they never loose flavor.\n\nHe was navy, he understood navy, he treated me like a gedunk, but also with a respect and camaraderie that I sometimes had difficulty understanding. He often said he considered me an officer. I suppose this was because I went to college, perhaps more, but it was irrelevant. If there was shit on my plate, he let me know. Top shirts can evaporate the demarcations between enlisted and commissioned in a blink of the eye. I listened intensively to his every word and perhaps was occasionally irritating, I knew I could be this way. But, he could smell out shit from a mile, and when I was full of it he let me know. He taught me the same skill, bullshit has the tendency to permeate a persons very soul. Yet, he was very compassionate and tactful when appropriate.\n\nFor years, I encouraged Ed to acquire a computer, and communicate. In general he acted toward this suggestion like I wanted him to roll in poison ivy. I think I recall the excuse \"too *#!?&# much work!\" He never did get a computer, but he did connect via web TV. Once he got on, he had an immediate audience. His friends, family and students circled around him with issues and interpretation, jokes and pleasantries. He called himself grey tengu, perhaps a malapropism, but also an ironic use of terms which depicts a mythical Japanese gremlin given to idiosyncratic and mischievous behavior. Tengu are sly and machinating with an agenda only they knew, because it had little to do with normal or conventional reality. However, within Ed there was no ideation toward evil, despite his occasional regrets associated with his past. The name could not have been more appropriate. The true irony lies in that this was typical of Ed's form of thinking.\n\nEd died some time between November 11-13, 2001. A mutual friend Pete Easton Sensei called me. At first it could not be believed. How, could he do something like this. I went from denial to idiocy. He was somewhat of a recluse, he lived alone with an ancient cat named Mr. B that adopted him in the mid eighties. Ed's wife Marion had passed several years before, and he always seemed to miss her. Marion and Ed met through Aikido. Sensei Benzo Sakashuro introduced them to one another. Isn't life a kick. I remember Ed saying that after Marion died, he thought he went a little crazy for awhile, one could understand, but no one could alleviate his pain, but he pretty much kept his burdens inside. Perhaps, he was becoming a tengu. He always said he wanted to become a Yamabushi and his modest trailer was his cave. We in the west think that there is never enough life and we cling to living without thought as to what is nurtured during the passage of time, there is another slant, when the work is done one can leave.\n\nHis students had not heard from him for several days, he had mentioned to me and others that he was down with the flue and very sick, no one thought it might end like this. This was about a week before he died, he said that he was leaving the windows open just in case something happened. I didn't think much of it, Ed always rebounded back from everything. I know that other students and friends talked to him after this, so I do not know if the condition continued to get worse. Maybe I should have called again and checked on him. I recall Ed telling me about his brother Labbi, a step brother. I had met him once, one could tell they came from different gene pools.\n\nLabbi came to live with Ed in Orlando, and one day Ed found him seemingly sleeping peacefully under a tree with the lawn mower close by. Ed said Labbi had a smile on his face, and looked at peace, he was just resting. This is how he discovered his brother's body. He always said Labby had a rich life and that was the way he would like to go, kind of a surprise and with a sublime smile. I wonder if Ed had a smile on his face. I don't think he ever thought he was going to die, no one else did either. In actuality for a while I contrived that it was just an insidious joke he was playing on us. I, as his student, was not ready to go it alone, and as his friend have his voice disappear from my ear. Every day he crosses my mind, and as I transcribe these words more than usual. Those of you that knew him will understand. I like so many others was made part of his family. But, Baker was no different than many other bona fide Aiki teachers. Their lives may be quite humble but their work is great. He was buried in his gi. Ordinarily I have excellent visual recall, but I cannot remember seeing him in the coffin, I must have blocked it, I might have gone a little crazy. Still, every day, as every thing is training, I try to live by his example as best I can.\n\nWhile my training in Aikido always came before most everything else, including making a living, there were also other wonderful opportunities lying around. I was feeling restless and unfulfilled so in 1975 there was in interlude where I returned to the Midwest and lived at the Himalayan Institute of Yogic Science and Philosophy while it was in Glenview, Illinois. This was an organization presided over by a very unusual man, Sri Swami Rama. An author named Doug Boyd wrote a book about him called Swami, and in actuality he is widely published and published about. Swamigi was a celebrity, like Swami Satchedenanda, Pir Vilat Khan, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and others. He came to the US from India having held the position of Gadhid of Shankaracharya of Karvirpitham. In 1950 Shankaracharya Swami Vidya Shankar Bharati (Dr. Kurtkoti) initiated one Bhole Baba into the Dandi order of Swamis, a high initiation in the tradition of Adi. Bhole Baba after was called Dandi Swami Sadashiva Bharati. He later was to become Rama, a name after the legendary first enlightened one. Rama's teacher was Bengali Baba, a great sage and acolyte of the Mahavatar Baba, \"Babaji.\" In Living with the Himalayan Masters Swami Rama explains \"Our tradition is Bharati. Bha means 'knowledge'; rati means 'lover'. Bharati means 'he who is the lover of knowledge.' The tradition of Himalayan masters associated with caves is touted to be at least 5000 years old. Bharati as an order was established by Shankaracharya some 1200 years ago as one of the ten orders within the sect.\n\nI remember when he whispered my mantram in my ear and said \"what do you think, it has all nine rays.\" I had no idea at all as to what I had gotten myself into. Rama was the youngest Gadhid, and the only ever to run away run away because it interfered with his meditation. The appointment schedule and politics ran him ragged. He said he hated it, so he gave his luxurious Shankaracharya robes to a beggar, put on his, got on a train, and ran away. The position is equal to that of the Pope or the Dalai Lama, with literally millions of followers, and usually held until death. He ran away eventually to the United States and taught us. He always called me his little boy, what could I say, maybe he treated everyone this way. He was a person that one watched and marveled at, but he was also human and could be uproariously funny, cookie monster. He could make you shut up with a glance. It did not pay to squirm. He departed his body November 13, 1996 leaving a legacy and I am grateful to have been even a small part of it. And, yes, I do love knowledge.\n\nEven his sojourn to the US was rare, but you can read books like Swami and Living with the Himalayan Masters for further edification. In the US he demonstrated unique physiological control by simulating stopping his heart while monitored at the Menenger Institute at Topeka, Kansas. He always said that he did not actually stop his heart, but that by controlling the smooth cardiac muscle he was able to increase the rate of contraction to tachycardia simulating pre-atrial fibrillation, the valves would flutter almost open simulating flat line. Quite a trick. Even though he explained this in my presence in the seventies, I never appreciated the implications until I became a physician. In fact he had control over many autonomic functions ordinarily not subject to voluntary control. His control over his internal states was in many ways singular and his example and demonstrations were at the center of the mind body movement of the period. The postures, asana, associated with the physical part of Yoga are only a scratch on a boulder on a mountain on a range of mountains representing the mass of yogic truth. My stay at the Ashram was short, but during this time I was changed. When Swamiji stepped into your life it was strange, phenomenal and sometimes paranormal. He could insinuate himself such that he would orchestrate your life. Many considered this a gift, and I am certain is was, but it is very hard to commit oneself to such a powerful personality, despite spiritual qualities or inclinations.\n\nWhen one considers the variety of spiritual missionaries that came from east to west to share the richness of millennia of evolution, Swami Rama was remarkable, even within their ranks. He was much like Yoginanda. He was for real. There are many paths that accommodate all stages of evolution. I have friends that are extraordinary psychics, and have studied many avenues of mind and spirit development. I have heard many remarkable stories about fakirs, yogis and other adepts that replicate such phenomena, but in the Ashram, in proximity to Swamiji the unusual became usual. I encountered a man from a tradition that opened my eyes to spiritual unfolding that were merely conjectures before. Not only did one rub close to this dharma, but Swamiji was also an intellect with profound insight and articulation. It was almost like one was transported in time and space to an alien civilization of much greater evolution, where the science appeared like magic, and any former knowledge base became irrelevant.\n\nSuch experience places one's western culture, experience and knowledge base to scrutiny. One begins to understand what it is to be small no matter how big or great you think you are. This is important to recognize, just because a system does not use or exploit technologies such as we presently have, it does not mean it is not evolved. Restraint or limitation tends to build intellectual constructs that appear alien but are in fact adroit investigations into reality based on other more subtle human instrumentality. In the west, particularly America, we are too much into our things and not into our most long lived assets conjoined with spirit. We claim to have faith, but faith that is just another device to provide security in this life or even in the next is merely another thing, temporal and illusory, and consisting of elements of fear. In order for a person to act in accord with divine movement the correct desire or aspiration must be present constantly and fear must dematerialize within fiery expectation. There is trepidation, certainty and abandon in the act itself. It is as though one gives themselves to the act, it is sacrificial. While organization and planning is good it does not supersede innocence in mind and conduct.\n\nThe life at the Ashram was very organized, the yogies that lived there were discipline and worked hard. There was a boy's house and a women's residence. Separation of the sexes, separation from sex, supposed to keep your mind on track, right. The work was quite compartmentalized with respect to roles. There was asana, meditation, work, food preparation, all the domestic rituals, and there was a print shop. There were health care services under the auspices of Dr. Rudy Ballentine. There were procedures for everything; food was lacto-vegetarian, the milk was boiled, despite pasteurization, one avoided consuming beverages when eating solids, everything was permeated with cumin, coriander and turmeric in proper proportion, bowel habits were regulated. There was a library and bookstore, one could read until their eyeballs fell out. It was a very functional community although austere from a western standpoint. It had an economy based on the promulgation of the teaching. Maybe it was like a kibbutz, but for yogies. For all you martial artists, if you want discipline, try this. In some ways the hierarchical matrix was very rigid, something that grates against conditioning associated with access and freedom of movement and choice, and sex, but often this is more about excess than freedom. In many ways, freedom is indeed a state of mind. Perhaps the downside is the benevolent dictatorship aspect of the system. The system is very much a training arena to promote spiritual awareness where distractions are diminished so the goal can be attained. The nature of the world is many distractions.\n\nNow this all is a long time ago, but I will never forget the essence of the ashram, Sri Swami Rama's presence and how it reflected on my personal inner turmoil and liabilities. If there is one regret in terms of choices in my life, I may have made it here, I chose to leave. The world sucked me back. Swamigi never abandoned me on occasions where there was great stress in my life like when my mother was grievously ill with cancer. He is no longer here either, but he is in my mind and heart, kind of in my shin and to. It is infrequent when a working class boy from Milwaukee encounters this sort of greatness, perhaps I was not ready. But I will always remember the waking in darkness, chanting in the asana of meditation, and encounters with his eminence. It is though it was a life I could have had, or did have, who is to say."
