If you have updates to share, send an email to editors@berkeleyside.org.\n\nEditors’ note: An initial version of the Emilia Flowers story was published Monday before Berkeleyside learned of Maryam Bloori’s death. The story has been fully updated.\n\nIn the spotlight North Shattuck\n\nMaryam Bloori’s family moved Emilia Flowers’ location while grieving her loss\n\nEmilia Flowers on Shattuck Avenue remains open after the sudden death of owner Maryam Bloori, who ran the shop for nearly 30 years.\n\nBloori died on April 28 after suffering a massive stroke at age 67.\n\nHer death was confirmed by her nephew, Arian Nowrouzi, who helps run the shop, and is a co-owner along with other family members. Bloori was not married and had no children.\n\n“She was kind of like my mom,” said Nowrouzi, whose own mother — Bloori’s sister — also recently died. “She was the biggest support in my life.”\n\nShe died as the shop was in the midst of moving locations, from a kiosk next to Cheese Board where it had been since 2000, to a brick-and-mortar shop across the street. The new shop, which opened in June in a space recently vacated by Siamese Dream, is in the same location where Bloori first opened Emilia Flowers in 1995.\n\nThe shop is thriving in its new space, according to Nowrouzi, though Bloori’s presence is sorely missed.\n\n“It’s a nice place,” said Nowrouzi. “The flowers are loving it. It’s good, but without her, it’s not as fun.”\n\nBloori was a native of Shiraz, Iran, a city known for its ancient gardens. She had a background in fine art painting. She credited this pairing for giving her a “discerning eye” for floral design, according to the company’s website.\n\nEmilia Flowers creates flower arrangements for a variety of events, including birthday parties, baby showers, funerals, and anniversaries.\n\nEmilia Flowers, 1527 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley.

The store, known for its cooler-than-thou staff as much as its clothing, was a mainstay for students and locals seeking a curated selection of vintage jeans, jackets, shirts and dresses, and was a hot spot for Halloween costumes.\n\nThe shop was part of Retro City Fashions, Inc., which also runs vintage shops in San Francisco including Held Over on Haight Street, and once ran the now-closed Mission Thrift and Clothes Contact in San Francisco’s Mission District.\n\nRetro City Fashions did not specify why Mars is closing when asked for comment.\n\nWhen the news broke on Instagram, comment sections were filled with both shock and sadness from former shoppers.\n\n“Nooooooo!” was a common refrain. Some said it was the “end of an era” and talked about the purchases they made there. “I bought my prom dress here,” one person wrote. “All of my coolest clothes over 20 plus years of my life” came from the shop, wrote another.\n\nLocal Telegraph Avenue businesses also chimed in. The Moe’s Books account commented that the closing was “so super sad” and 510 Skate Shop merely shared a quartet of teardrop emojis.\n\nFor its final week, Mars Mercantile, which billed itself as “Invaders of Closet Space,” reduced prices to $5 per item. The last vintage garment was sold on July 27, when the shop shuttered for good.\n\nMars Mercantile, 2398 Telegraph Ave., Berkeley.

A year after incorporation, the cooperative — commonly known as ACCI — found a gallery space on Shattuck Avenue, and has been there ever since.\n\nAt the outset, there were tensions between those who identified as artists and those who identified as craftsmen.\n\n“There used to be a separation, the craft in the front and the art in the back,” said Kirk McCarthy, ACCI’s board president. “Crafts were actually paying most of the mortgage. We ended up mixing it up to increase the income and in so doing, that separation of 2D artists versus the crafts disappeared, which was unexpected.”\n\n“Lots of people have come into the gallery from Berkeley saying, ‘When I was a kid, 20 years ago, 30 years ago, I would take art classes in the back,’” said Susan Friedewald, ACCI’s executive director. “People say, ‘I met my wife taking a ceramics class here in the gallery.’”\n\nOne Berkeley resident whose life changed dramatically after taking a class at ACCI was Michael Sosin.\n\n“He was a dentist here in Berkeley for 30 years,” said Friedewald. “He took a class in glass making and then shifted his whole career to being a glass artist showing in exhibitions and galleries around the country.”\n\nFormer Berkeley mayor Gus Newport used to drop by the gallery from time to time.\n\n“One day he came in and he brought in another couple,” recalled McCarthy. “He and I were gossiping with each other and the couple were busy going around the store looking for something. And after 15 minutes or so, he said, ‘Do you know who that is? That’s Vincent Harding. He was one of Martin Luther King’s speechwriters.’ He was looking for a wedding ring for his bride to be. Gus wanted to bring him into our gallery because of our connections with the food co-op and the values of what a cooperative is.”\n\nMore than 3,000 members have been a part of the gallery since its founding. And some 30 of those members from past and present will be showing work at a special event called RECOLLECTION: 65th Anniversary Exhibition, which will open on Aug. 24 with a kickoff reception featuring cheese, wine, and crudité, and will close on Sept. 29. There will be a special closing festival on Sept. 28 featuring ice cream, cake, music, and a raffle.\n\nThe exhibition will be installed in chronological order, according to Carolyn Tillie, who’s heading the anniversary celebration committee.\n\n“Concurrently running above the art will be a timeline,” said Tillie. “Newspaper articles or media from that era, about what was happening in Berkeley and the world at that time. So many of the artists were making things in reaction to issues in the world.”\n\nThe gallery will also hold DIY art making classes each Saturday during the exhibition’s run, including a cyanotype workshop taught by Mary Shisler on Aug. 31, Mirto Golino teaching crocheted “scrumbling” on Sept. 7, a polymer clay class from Arbel Shemesh on Sept. 14, and a potato printing class taught by Tillie on Sept. 21. Member artists, including Judy Rosenfield, Steve Bernstein, The Bowman Studio, Bill Burch, Mayomi Fugio, and Karen Mason will also be hosting intimate, two-hour studio visits as part of the anniversary festivities.\n\nThe Berkeley Co-op grocery store chain folded in 1988, after a 49-year run. ACCI has outlived the cooperative that helped inspire its creation. McCarthy believes the organization’s staying power is due to it staying timely throughout its 65 years.\n\n“We’re continuously reinventing ourselves,” he said, “and coming up with new stories that fit today’s world.”\n\nACCI Gallery, 1652 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley. Phone: 510-843-2527. Hours: Monday-Saturday, 11 a.m.-6 p.m.; Sunday, 12-5 p.m. Connect via Facebook and Instagram.\n\nOpen Fourth Street\n\nJo Malone London makes Fourth Street a little more fragrant\n\nJo Malone London, the British cosmetics and luxury lifestyle brand known for its colognes, candles and other bath and body goods, has opened a store on Fourth Street at the Hearst Avenue corner in a location previously housed by M.A.C. Cosmetics.\n\nThe Berkeley location, which opened on May 25, is one of more than 30 freestanding Jo Malone London stores in the United States. The brand can be found in hundreds of stores across the country including Nordstrom, Sephora, and Blue Mercury, and in 82 countries across the globe.\n\n“In the freestanding stores, you get a really elevated service experience,” said Stefano Baraibar, manager of the brand’s Union Square location in San Francisco, who is filling in at the Berkeley location. He noted that freestanding stores offer exclusive products, plus free personalization of gifts like cologne bottles or candle lids using an on-site engraving machine.\n\nThe brand was started in 1990 by British perfumer Jo Malone, and was purchased in 1999 by Estée Lauder.\n\nThe Berkeley store will be holding a grand opening event from Aug. 23-25, which will include several activations including a bottle painter who will decorate purchases.\n\nJo Malone London, 1850 Fourth St., Berkeley. Phone: 341-219-9968. Hours: Monday-Friday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; Saturday, 10 a.m.-7 p.m.; Sunday 11 a.m.-6 p.m. Connect via Instagram and Facebook.\n\nIn Brief\n\nBerkeley Little School, one of three Little School preschools operated by Holly Gold, is getting ready to “graduate” their first class into kindergarten. The school, which opened in September 2021 in the former site of Gay Austin School on Hopkins Street, also started a toddler program earlier this year for 18- to 24-month-olds. “We call them Bunnies,” said Gold of the toddlers and is clearly charmed to have them at her school. “They’re just like these little cutenesses,” she said.\n\nOn July 20, Laurel Burch Studios on Eighth Street held a special event called “50 Years of Laurel Burch,” celebrating the artist who began selling handmade jewelry at Haight Ashbury street fairs in the 1960s and went on to international artworld acclaim. The event featured a ribbon-cutting ceremony, an exhibit of Burch’s original art, and sales of “bright, bold apparel, accessories, jewelry, gifts, and more,” according to the company’s website."
