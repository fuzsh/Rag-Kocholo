        "text": "6. Certification of cause of death\n\nWhen a death occurs, the attending doctor completes a Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD) (Annex A (PDF, 224KB)). This is normally taken to the local registrar of births and deaths in the district in which the death occurred. Since April 1997, information may be provided to a registrar in a different district. This is known as the registration of deaths by declaration and is used mostly for the deaths of infants. Further details about deaths by declaration are available in Section 7: Registration of deaths by declaration.\n\nUsually, the certifying doctor must have seen the deceased during the last two weeks of life to complete a MCCD. This is normally delivered to the registrar by the informant (often a relative of the deceased), within five days of the date of death, as required by law. The majority of deaths are registered in this way. A specimen of the draft death entry completed by the registrar at the time of registration is reproduced at Annex B (old, PDF, 153KB) and Annex I (new, PDF, 276KB).\n\nIn an emergency period, such as the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, any doctor can complete the MCCD, when it is impractical for the attending doctor to do so. This may, for example, be when the attending doctor is self-isolating, unwell, or has pressure to attend to patients. In these circumstances, it may be practical to allow a medical examiner or recently retired doctor returning to work to complete the MCCD. Further details about death certification during emergency periods are available in the Guidance for doctors completing Medical Certificates of Cause of Death in England and Wales (PDF, 383KB).\n\nThere are circumstances when a MCCD cannot be issued immediately, such as those deaths reported to a coroner, and the registration is consequently delayed. Some examples of these situations are given in the following subsections.\n\nReferral to the coroner\n\nFor some deaths, the doctor may certify the cause and report the case to the coroner or the registrar may report it. Deaths that should be referred to a coroner include those where:\n\nthe cause is unknown\n\nthe deceased was not seen by the certifying doctor either after death or within the 14 days before death\n\nthe death was violent, unnatural or suspicious\n\nthe death may have been due to an accident (whenever it occurred)\n\nthe death may have been due to self-neglect or neglect by others\n\nthe death may have been due to an industrial disease or related to the deceased's employment\n\nthe death occurred during an operation or before recovery from the effects of an anaesthetic\n\nthe death may have been a suicide\n\nthe death occurred during or shortly after detention in police or prison custody\n\nthere was no doctor available who was legally qualified to certify the death\n\nFollowing a significant increase in applications for Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) between 2013 and 2015, and a consequent increase in coroner investigations and inquests into deaths where a DoLS was in place, it was recommended that these deaths were removed from the \"in state detention\" category (PDF, 77KB). Since changes to the Policing and Crime Act 2017, deaths under DoLS that occurred on or before 3 April 2017 should be treated outside the context of state detention and should only be reported to the coroner where one or more other conditions are met. As a result, we saw the number of inquests on natural deaths decrease from 2009 onwards (a reversal of the earlier trend).\n\nCoroners have several possible courses of action once a death has been referred. If they are satisfied that the death was due to natural causes and the cause has been correctly certified by a medical practitioner, the local registrar is notified (Form 100A - Annex D (PDF, 88KB)) and they can then register the death using the cause given on the MCCD. In rare cases where no medical certificate is available, the death will be registered as uncertified and the cause taken from Form 100A (Annex D (PDF, 88KB)).\n\nAlternatively, the coroner may order a post-mortem examination. This may happen if the death was sudden and the cause unknown, if there was no doctor in attendance, or if the death has been referred directly to the coroner by the police. If the post-mortem shows unequivocally that the death was due to natural causes, the coroner notifies the registrar that they do not intend to hold an inquest (Form 100B - Annex E (PDF, 133KB)). In such cases, the cause of death given by the coroner on Form 100B is based on the information from the post-mortem held by the pathologist.\n\nCoroners' inquests\n\nIf an inquest is necessary, the death can usually be registered only after the inquest has taken place. In a small number of cases, the coroner holds an inquest without a post-mortem. In most cases, the inquest concludes the investigation and the death is then certified by the coroner (Form 99(REV) - Annex C (PDF, 171KB)). This provides the registrar with details of the deceased and the inquest findings as to cause of death.\n\nIf someone is to be charged with an offence in relation to the death, the coroner must adjourn the inquest until those legal proceedings are completed. Since 1978 (see Section 9: Cause of death coding; subsection: Accelerated registrations), it has been possible to register these deaths at the time of adjournment, when the coroner issues Form 120 (Annex F (PDF, 160KB)). This form includes details of injuries that led to the death but no conclusion. In the case of motor vehicle incidents, there is enough information to code the cause of death. Other deaths, such as possible homicides, are given a temporary code for underlying cause of death (U50.9) until final information becomes available. This is supplied by the coroner to the registrar on Form 121 (Annex G (PDF, 172KB)).\n\nLegally uncertified deaths\n\nA very small percentage of deaths remain legally uncertified (An analysis of legally uncertified deaths in England and Wales, 1979 to 2002). In recent years, this figure has remained around 0.5% of all deaths registered in England and Wales, but in 2021, this figure dropped to 0.2%. In 2022, 1.4% of deaths were legally uncertified.\n\nWe receive copies of at least one certificate of cause of death for these cases, which are registered and coded as normal. This group includes deaths for which the doctor, who completed the medical certificate, did not fulfil all the legal requirements for doing so. For example, where the doctor was not in attendance with the deceased during the last illness (please note that this was not a requirement during the coronavirus pandemic (PDF, 383KB)), or did not see the body, and the coroner did not order a post-mortem but issued Form 100A (Annex D (PDF, 88KB)). It also includes deaths of foreign military personnel in England and Wales where the certifying doctor was not a registered medical practitioner for the purpose of issuing medical certificates.\n\nTable 4 gives relevant numbers of deaths by type of certification for 2017 to 2022.\n\nDownload this table Table 4: Deaths by method of certification and registration, England and Wales, 2017 to 2022\n\n.xls .csv\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n9. Cause of death coding\n\nCoding the underlying cause of death\n\nAutomated cause coding\n\nSince 1993, the majority (approximately 80%) of Office for National Statistics (ONS) mortality data have been coded by automatic cause coding software. Specific text terms from the death certificate are converted to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes, and then selection and modification rules (see later in this section) are used to assign the underlying cause of death. Using computer algorithms to apply rules increases the consistency and improves the international and temporal comparability of mortality statistics. The cause coding of deaths certified after inquest is done manually by experienced coders, as the software could not code the free text format used by coroners.\n\nInternational Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) was introduced in England and Wales in January 2001. Since then, various amendments have been authorised by the World Health Organization (WHO). Amendments may, for example, correct errors in the software supporting automatic coding, accommodate new codes in response to new conditions, such as coronavirus (COVID-19) or incorporate advances in medical knowledge of the relationship between conditions.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2010, the ONS used the Mortality Medical Data System (MMDS) ICD-10 version 2001.2 software provided by the United States National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) to code cause of death. In January 2011, this was updated to version 2010, which incorporated most of the WHO amendments authorised up to 2009.\n\nThe main changes in ICD-10 version 2010 were amendments to the modification tables and selection rules. Overall, the impact of these changes is small, although some cause groups are affected more than others. For further information, see the results of the bridge coding study. There is also another study looking at the impact on stillbirths and neonatal deaths.\n\nOn 1 January 2014, we changed the software used to code cause of death to a package called IRIS (version 2013). The development of IRIS was supported by Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU and is now managed by the IRIS Institute hosted by the German Institute of Medical Documentation and Information in Cologne.\n\nIRIS software version 2013 incorporated all official updates to ICD-10 approved by WHO, which were timetabled for implementation before 2014. These updates included changes to the use of codes within the neoplasms (cancer) chapter (ICD-10 codes C00 to D48). In addition, a small number of changes were made to the coding of specific conditions, to bring previous coding practice in line with international coding rules and changes were made to the coding of neonatal deaths and stillbirths.\n\nOn 1 January 2022, we again updated the IRIS software to the Multicausal and Unicausal Selection Engine (MUSE) (IRIS version 5.8). The MUSE operates based on internationally agreed decision tables that reflect the most recent version of ICD-10. This system also increases the automation of coding compared with the previous software.\n\nFurther information on the impacts of changes to cause of death coding software is available:\n\nImpact of the Implementation of IRIS Software for ICD-10 Cause of Death Coding on Mortality Statistics\n\nImpact of the implementation of IRIS software for ICD-10 cause of death coding on stillbirth and neonatal death statistics\n\nCause of death coding in mortality statistics, software changes: January 2020\n\nCause of death coding in mortality statistics, software changes: January 2022\n\nThe death certificate (Annex A (PDF, 224KB)) used in England and Wales is compatible with that recommended by WHO. It is set out in two parts. Part I gives the condition or sequence of conditions leading directly to death, while Part II gives details of any associated conditions that contributed to the death but are not part of the causal sequence.\n\nThe selection of the underlying cause of death is based on ICD rules and is made from the condition or conditions reported by the certifier, as recorded on the certificate. The underlying cause of death is defined by WHO as the disease or injury that initiated the train of events directly leading to death or the circumstances of the accident or violence that produced the fatal injury.\n\nDeaths attributed to accidents, poisonings and violence are examined, firstly according to the underlying cause of death (external cause) and secondly by the nature of injury or main injury. External cause of injury codes are taken from Chapter XX of the ICD (prefixes U50.9 and V01 to Y89, where U50.9 is a temporary code and not included in Chapter XX) and nature of injury codes are from Chapter XIX (prefixes S00 to T98) or from a smaller number of other post-procedural codes not within Chapter XIX.\n\nSelection and modification rules\n\nThe selection of the underlying cause of death is generally made from the condition or conditions entered in the lowest completed line of Part I of the Medical Certificate of Cause of Death (MCCD). If the death certificate has not been completed correctly - for example, if there is more than one cause on a single line with no indication of sequence or the conditions entered are not an acceptable causal sequence - it becomes necessary to apply one or more of the selection rules in the ICD-10.\n\nEven where the certificate has been completed properly, there are particular conditions, combinations or circumstances when modification rules have to be applied to select the correct underlying cause of death. On some death certificates, for example, when two or more causes are listed and then linked together, these may point to another cause (not mentioned directly on the certificate) as underlying (an inferred underlying cause). This happens in a minority of cases and these are most commonly related to diseases of the circulatory system and late effects of cerebrovascular disease. In other cases, the underlying cause of death can be selected from Part II of the MCCD.\n\nIn summary, the purpose behind the selection and modification rules is to derive the most useful information from the death certificate and to do it uniformly so that data will be comparable between places and times and each death certificate produces one, and only one, underlying cause of death.\n\nUnderlying cause of death versus contributory causes\n\nCoding rules ensure that each recorded item on the certificate is coded independently of all others on the same certificate. All mentioned causes (the underlying cause of death and any other causes that were mentioned on the death certificate as contributing to the death) have been coded routinely since 1993.\n\nMost of the regular ONS mortality tables analyse the underlying cause of death, often referred to as deaths \"due to\" a particular cause. In some publications we also refer to deaths \"involving\" a particular cause. This is a broader category that includes all deaths that had the cause mentioned on the death certificate, whether as the underlying cause or a contributory cause.\n\nICD-10 implementation\n\nICD-10 was implemented in England and Wales in 2001. The main differences between ICD-9 and ICD-10 are outlined in Results of the ICD-10 bridge coding study, England and Wales, 1999.\n\nThe vast majority of deaths in ICD-9 remained in comparable chapters in ICD-10. However, there were some discontinuities in the data because of the application of new rules for assigning underlying cause in ICD-10, most notably for deaths due to pneumonia. Section 16: Background and history of mortality data (subsection: Historical changes in mortality data) provides further details about sources of information on the changes to ICD-10.\n\nHistorically, the rule that changed cause of death statistics most was the introduction of Rule 3 (see Section 16: Background and history of mortality data (subsection: Legislation) for further details). In ICD-10, the list of conditions affected by Rule 3 is more clearly defined than in ICD-9 and is also broader in scope.\n\nDeaths from 1979 to 2000, which appear in tables containing historical data, are coded to ICD-9 and have been grouped to reflect ICD-10 categories. To achieve this broad comparability, the ranges of ICD-9 codes used for some of the groupings differ from those published in annual volumes prior to 2001. Particular causes affected include leukaemia, diseases of the liver and land transport accidents.\n\nNote on coding of acute rheumatic fever (ICD-9 390 to 392, ICD-10 I00 to I02)\n\nIn 1999, we found that, in some circumstances, deaths from rheumatic and valvular heart diseases were wrongly coded to acute rheumatic fever by the automated cause coding system introduced in 1993. All deaths in 1998 and 1999 with any mention of acute rheumatic fever were checked and recoded manually, if necessary. From 2000, routine checks were set in place to correct any deaths miscoded to acute rheumatic fever. Therefore, published data on deaths between 1993 and 1997 assigned to acute rheumatic fever should be regarded as highly unreliable.\n\nNote on coding influenza due to identified avian or swine influenza virus (ICD-10 J09)\n\nFollowing guidance from WHO, the ICD-10 code J09 \"Influenza due to identified avian influenza virus\" has been used to record H1N1 swine influenza. For ease of use, J09 has been renamed to \"Influenza due to identified avian or swine influenza virus\" in the mortality tables since 2009.\n\nThe number of deaths with an underlying cause of \"Influenza due to identified avian or swine influenza virus\" (J09) differ from figures reported by Public Health England (PHE).\n\nNote on coding of the coronavirus (COVID-19)\n\nFollowing guidance from WHO, the ICD-10 codes U07.1 (COVID-19, virus identified) and U07.2 (COVID-19, virus not identified) have been used to record deaths from COVID-19 since 2020. In February 2021, two further codes were implemented following additional guidance from WHO: U09.9 (Post-COVID condition, unspecified) and U10.9 (Multisystem inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, unspecified).\n\nTwo codes for certain conditions\n\nThe \"dagger and asterisk\" system\n\nICD-10 has continued the system introduced in ICD-9 whereby there are two codes for diagnostic descriptions that contain information about both an underlying generalised disease (given a dagger (†) code) and a local manifestation in a particular organ or site that is a clinical problem in its own right (given an asterisk (*) code). This system was introduced because previously the underlying disease alone did not allow for analysis of the manifestation of a disease that was the reason for receiving medical care.\n\nConditions with dagger codes are used in assigning underlying causes, whereas asterisk codes are not used in this way so will not appear in tables including underlying cause of death only. Asterisk codes appear as categories for the same conditions occurring when a particular disease is not specified as the underlying cause. For example, codes G20 and G21 (not asterisk codes) are for forms of Parkinsonism that are not manifestations of other diseases assigned elsewhere, while category G22* is for \"Parkinsonism in diseases classified elsewhere\". Corresponding dagger codes are given for conditions mentioned in asterisk categories; for example, for syphilitic Parkinsonism in G22*, the dagger code is A52.1† (symptomatic neurosyphilis).\n\nFor further information on the dagger and asterisk system, see Section 3.1.3 of the ICD-10 instruction manual (PDF, 2.1MB).\n\nSecondary causes\n\nDeaths where the underlying cause is assigned to an external cause (ICD-10 Chapter XX, U50.9 to Y89) are also assigned at least one nature of injury code (Chapter XIX, S00 to T98) or a post-procedural code not within Chapter XIX. This means it is possible to have more than one nature of injury code for a single death.\n\nFor example, a car occupant injured in a transport accident (V40 to V49) may have suffered a fracture to the skull (S02) and femur (S72) as well as injuries of the spleen (S36). However, it is necessary to select which one of the nature of injury codes is to be identified as the one causing death. This one cause code is referred to by the ONS as the secondary cause. To do this, WHO provides guidelines or \"rules\" to ensure that the most useful information is derived from the death certificate and that it is done uniformly.\n\nThe move from ICD-9 to ICD-10 had an impact on the allocation of secondary causes. The ONS published an assessment of this impact. In ICD-10, when more than one body region is involved, coding is made to the relevant category of injuries involving multiple body regions (T00 to T07). Therefore, in the previous example of an occupant injured in a transport accident, under ICD-10 the secondary cause would be classified as \"other specified injuries involving multiple body regions\" (T06.8), whereas under ICD-9 the secondary cause would be more specifically classified as a fracture of the skull (ICD-9 800).\n\nAn update by WHO was implemented for 2014 data whereby if more than one serious injury is reported on the relevant part of the certificate, the main injury must be selected from the Priority Ranking of ICD-10 Nature-of-Injury Codes (PDF, 1.0MB) list. The update indicates that when more than one of the serious injuries reported in the relevant part of the certificate have the same and highest rank, select the first mentioned of these injuries; however, we prefer a specific injury over an injury from the block T00 to T07 (injuries involving multiple body regions) with the same priority rank.\n\nInformation on injuries is derived from the coroners' forms that are supplied to the ONS, in particular the coroner's certificate of cause of death after inquest (Form 99 (Rev) A - Annex C (PDF, 171KB)). This form was revised in May 1993 to bring it into line with the MCCD and with WHO recommendations. Because the revised form no longer includes specific questions about type of injury and parts of body injured, some coroners now often provide less detail than before. The result is that some deaths are assigned to residual codes for nature of injury. For example, in ICD-10 the statement \"head injury\" is coded to \"unspecified injury of head\" (S09.9), whereas with more detail it might be assigned to \"fracture of skull and facial bones\" (S02.n).\n\nFinal cause of death\n\nThe conditions mentioned on the death certificate are used to derive an underlying cause of death. In some cases, more information on cause of death may become available at a later stage after the death has been registered such that the underlying cause may be subsequently amended. Around 0.05% of deaths have their underlying cause amended (Table 6). This amended or final cause is used in mortality statistics. Sometimes, the later information becomes available only after publication. Users with access to individual records of deaths as shown in the public record (which is never amended) may consequently find some differences with published statistics.\n\nDownload this table Table 6: Number of deaths where original cause was amended for final cause, England and Wales, 2022\n\n.xls .csv\n\nIn summary, further details on the causes of death can be obtained in one or other of the following ways.\n\nDeaths certified by doctors may have their cause amended as a result of a post-mortem or of tests initiated before death. The certifier sends this additional information directly to the cause coding team at the ONS, where it is only used for statistical purposes and does not appear in the public record. Less than 1% of deaths certified by a doctor have a post-mortem and in the majority of cases, the certified cause remains unchanged. In addition, the ONS cause coders may contact the certifier for more information if the certificate is unclear or they cannot code the underlying cause; this is very rare.\n\nWhen a death has been certified by a coroner after post-mortem (with no inquest), further information may be available once they have results of bacteriology or histopathology. This is also very rare. Following an inquest, coroners may submit to the ONS details of how a fatal accident occurred. This is rare, as coroners normally only certify the cause of death after their investigations are complete, so the first and only information the ONS receives about these deaths is the final underlying cause. Coroners may also provide a final underlying cause of death and conclusion much later for an accelerated registration following an adjourned inquest (see next subsection).\n\nAccelerated registrations\n\nOn 1 January 1978, certain provisions of the Criminal Law Act 1977, the Coroners (Amendment) Rules 1977 and the Registration of Births, Deaths and Marriages (Amendment) Regulations 1977 came into force. These meant that in cases where an inquest was adjourned, the death could be registered as an accelerated registration, without the need to await the outcome of criminal proceedings.\n\nAccelerated registrations that are not transport incidents are assigned to code U50.9 (event awaiting determination of event); prior to 2007, they were assigned to code Y33.9 (other specified events, undetermined intent). Most of these are eventually reassigned to assault (X85 to Y09), but the delays before this happens can affect the published figures in the under-estimation of deaths from assault (Death certification and the epidemiologist). For this reason, ONS statistics on deaths from assault usually include ICD-10 code U50.9 (see next section).\n\nAccelerated registrations related to deaths involving motor vehicle incidents are assigned to a code in the range V01 to V89 (land transport accidents) if sufficient information is available on the coroner's certificate of adjournment.\n\nAssault and intentional self-harm\n\nNumbers of deaths from assault (homicide in ICD-9)\n\nIt is possible to make alternative assessments about the number of deaths that may be attributed to assault. There are two estimates presented in standard tables. The first is the number coded to X85 to Y09; this is the basic ICD classification to which all assaults should eventually be assigned. The second is the number coded to X85 to Y09 plus those coded to U50.9 (event awaiting determination of intent); this takes account of accelerated registrations, most of which are eventually coded to an assault code.\n\nNumbers of deaths from intentional self-harm (suicide in ICD-9)\n\nAs with assault, it is possible to make two separate estimates of the number of deaths annually from intentional self-harm. The first is the number coded to X60 to X84; this is the basic ICD classification to which all definite intentional self-harm conclusions are assigned. The second is the National Statistics definition of suicide, which includes the number coded to X60 to X84 plus those coded to Y10 to Y34 (event of undetermined intent); this takes account of most deaths, excluding 10- to 14-year-olds, where an open inquest conclusion was returned, but it excludes all deaths that are pending investigation.\n\nThe National Statistics definition of suicide was revised in January 2016 to include deaths from intentional self-harm in children aged 10 to 14 years. Previously, we did not include suicides in young children because of the very small numbers involved. However, after discussions with Public Health England and the constituent countries of the UK, it was decided that it was appropriate to include them.\n\nDeaths from an event of undetermined intent in 10- to 14-year-olds are not included in these suicide statistics, because although for older teenagers and adults we assume that in these deaths the harm was self-inflicted, for younger children it is not clear whether this assumption is appropriate. This new definition has been applied to the full back series from 1981 to the latest year of death registrations. For more information on the suicides definition, please see our Suicides in the UK statistical bulletin.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n15. Death rates, ratios and standardisation\n\nDeath rates are derived from total deaths registered in England and Wales in the specific calendar year and corresponding mid-year population estimates.\n\nIt is the Office for National Statistics (ONS) practice not to calculate rates where there are small numbers of deaths in a cell, as rates based on such low numbers are susceptible to inaccurate interpretation. Age-standardised rates are not calculated where there are fewer than 10 deaths in a cell and crude rates are not calculated when there are fewer than 3 deaths in a cell; both of these are noted by (x). Rates that are based on fewer than 20 deaths are displayed in tables but are denoted by (u) as a warning to the user that the measure may be unreliable because of the small number of events.\n\nPrior to July 2014, age-standardised rates were not calculated where there were fewer than three deaths in a cell. Rates in tables calculated from between 3 and 19 deaths were distinguished by italic type.\n\nAnnualisation of rates\n\nFor all types of rates outlined in this section, the basic unit would be \"deaths per N population per X days\" where N might commonly be 1,000 or 100,000, and X is the number of days within the period being considered (for example, seven days if weekly). To allow for easier comparison of rate values between periods of different length, unless otherwise stated in individual publications, rates are adjusted to be a consistent unit of \"deaths per N population per year\", using the following equation:\n\nWhere:\n\nrate is the unadjusted rate, based on deaths and population figures for the specified time period (per week, month or quarter).\n\nY is the number of days in the year that the period falls within (365 or 366 for non-leap years and leap years, respectively)\n\nd is the number of days covered by the unadjusted period (for example, 7 if one week, 31 if May)\n\nCrude death rate\n\nCrude death rate is defined as total deaths per 1,000 population, or:\n\nAge-specific death rates\n\nAge-specific death rates may be calculated for each age group. These are defined as the number of deaths in the age group per 1,000 population in the same age group or:\n\nWhere:\n\nMₖ = age-specific death rate for age group k\n\ndₖ = deaths in age group k\n\npₖ = population in age group k (mid-year population estimates with the exception for the rate for those aged under 1 year where the number of live births are used instead)\n\nₖ = age\n\nAge-specific rates may be calculated separately for males and females or for both sexes combined.\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs)\n\nAge-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) allow for differences in the age structure of populations and therefore allow valid comparisons to be made between geographic areas, over time and between sexes. Using the direct method, the age-standardised rate for a particular condition is that which would have occurred if the observed age-specific rates for the condition had applied in a given standard population.\n\nThus:\n\nWhere:\n\nPₖ = standard population in sex or age group k\n\nmₖ = observed mortality rate (deaths per million persons) in sex or age group k (mid-year population estimates are used to calculate all age-specific rates prior to standardisation)\n\nₖ = age or sex group 0, 1 to 4, 5 to 9, ..., 85 to 89, 90 years and over\n\n(From the 2015 data year, ASMRs are calculated using population estimates for all age groups. Prior to the 2015 data year, the number of live births were used for the population at age under 1 year old. This change has had no significant impact on the rates.)\n\nThe age-standardised rate for “all causes” includes deaths at all ages, while the same rates for specific causes exclude neonatal deaths (infants aged under 28 days). Classification by underlying cause is not possible for neonatal deaths (see Section 11: Childhood mortality; subsection: Neonatal deaths).\n\nThe standard population used is the European Standard Population (ESP); it is the same for both males and females. The ESP is a hypothetical population used to weight ASMRs.\n\nThe ESP was originally published in 1976 and was updated by Eurostat in 2013. The 2013 ESP structure allocates a greater weight to older ages to better reflect the ageing population. This change has had a significant impact; consequently, ASMRs based on the 1976 ESP are not comparable with those based on the 2013 ESP. Further information about the change in methods is available.\n\nDownload this table Table 7: Distribution of the European Standard Population (ESP) for 1976 and 2013\n\n.xls .csv\n\nFor National Statistics publication of mortality and cancer incidence, the ONS is currently using an abridged ESP with a 90 years and over upper age band. National Statistics population estimates are only currently available for upper age limit of 90 years and over.\n\nPerinatal mortality rate\n\nPerinatal mortality rate is the number of deaths at ages under seven days (early neonatal deaths) plus stillbirths per 1,000 live births and stillbirths in the same period.\n\nInfant mortality rate\n\nInfant mortality rate is the number of deaths at ages under 1 year per 1,000 live births.\n\nYears of life lost\n\nAnalyses of the effects of premature death assume that everyone may live to a defined age and that death at a younger age means that some future years of life have been lost. Calculations of Years of Life Lost (YLL) are made for deaths from selected causes with the aim of illustrating the relative effects from different diseases. The \"cut-off\" ages used are 65, 75 and 85 years. These exclude deaths at high ages where the cause may be uncertain.\n\nThis approach, but with a \"cut-off\" age of 65 years, is also used to calculate Years of Working Life Lost (YWLL) due to premature death. From the 2012 data year onwards, the period of working life covers ages 16 to 64 years. Prior to the 2012 data year, the period of working life covered ages 15 to 64 years. This change has a negligible impact on the comparability of statistics over time:\n\nWhere:\n\ndᵢ , dⱼ , dₖ = number of deaths in age group i, j or k\n\naᵢ , aⱼ , aₖ = age i, j or k + 0.5\n\nA = 65 years or 75 years or 85 years\n\nᵢ = 0 to 64 years or 0 to 74 years or 0 to 84 years\n\nⱼ = 16 to 64 years\n\nₖ = 0 to 15 years\n\nSince there is no information on underlying cause of death when the deceased was aged under 28 days, the only category including both neonatal and non-neonatal deaths is that for \"all causes\".\n\nThe mean age at death may be included as a further indicator of the relative effects of premature death. It is based on the sum of ages at death for each person.\n\nWhere:\n\naᵢ = age + 0.5\n\ndᵢ = number of deaths at age i\n\nᵢ = single years of age 0 to 119, 120 and over\n\nd = total number of deaths\n\nCrude rate of years of life lost\n\nCrude rate of years of life lost is defined as the number of Years of Life Lost for the specified age \"cut-off\" for the whole population. It is given per 100,000 population:\n\nWhere:\n\nYLLᵢ = number of years for a given age \"cut off\"i\n\nP = total population of England and Wales\n\nPotential years of life lost\n\nPotential years of life lost (PYLL) is a measure of the potential number of years lost when a person dies prematurely from any cause. The basic concept of PYLL is that deaths at younger ages are weighted more heavily than those at older ages. The advantage in doing this is that deaths at younger ages may be seen as less important if cause-specific death rates were just used on their own in highlighting the burden of disease and injury, since conditions such as cancer and heart disease usually occur at older ages and have relatively high mortality rates.\n\nTo enable comparisons between areas and over time, age-standardised PYLL rates, also known as SYLL rates, are calculated. These rates represent the PYLL if the population of England and Wales had the same population structure as the 2013 European Standard Population (ESP). SYLL rates are presented as years of life lost per 100,000 population.\n\nPYLL is calculated as the sum of the mortality rate in each age group weighted by the potential number of years of life lost as indicated by remaining life expectancy for each age group. To calculate SYLL, this is then standardised to the 2013 ESP as shown in the equation:\n\nWhere:\n\nᵢ = age group (less than 1 year, 1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, ..., 85 to 89 years, and 90 years and over)\n\ndᵢ = number of deaths in age group ᵢ\n\naᵢ = weight or average age-specific period life expectancy in age group ᵢ for a given year\n\nnᵢ = population in age group ᵢ\n\nwᵢ = number of individuals in the standard population in age group ᵢ\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n16. Background and history of mortality data\n\nRedevelopment of mortality statistics\n\nIn the early 1990s, there was an extensive redevelopment of collection and processing systems for population, health and registration data - in particular, for births and deaths. For deaths, this included: the progressive computerisation of registration in local offices, the move to a large deaths database to hold all deaths data from 1993 and the introduction of automated coding of cause of death.\n\nFurther information about these changes follows, with more details in the annual volume in the DH2 series for 1993 and 1994. Changes to the rules for selecting and coding cause of death brought England and Wales into line with international practice in 1993.\n\nThe deaths databases\n\nIn the deaths processing system that has been used within the Office for National Statistics (ONS) since the early 1990s, there are two deaths databases, one for register information and the other for statistical data.\n\nThe registration database contains mainly textual information that appears on the death certificate. This corresponds to most of the details supplied by informants to a registrar, available to applicants requesting a copy of the death certificate.\n\nThe deaths statistical database contains only coded details of each death. When outputs are required, the statistical database can supply information on individual deaths or provide datasets for tabulation. The statistical database is continually updated and amended as further information becomes available.\n\nIn 1999, we developed a database to facilitate research into deaths related to drug poisoning and to aid the identification of specific substances involved in these deaths. The database currently contains data on all deaths on the annual data files for England and Wales between 1993 and the latest available year, where the underlying cause of death is regarded as resulting from drug-related poisoning, according to the current National Statistics definition. The database covers accidents and suicides involving drug poisoning as well as poisonings due to drug abuse and drug dependence but not other adverse effects of drugs.\n\nLegislation\n\nThe existing provisions for the registration of deaths and the processing, reporting and analysis of mortality data appear in different legislation that reflects the distinct and separate roles of the Registrar General for England and Wales and the UK Statistics Authority.\n\nThe Registrar General is guided by the following:\n\nPopulation (Statistics) Act 1938: deals with the statistical information collected at registration\n\nBirths and Deaths Registration Act 1953: covers all aspects of the registration of births, stillbirths and deaths\n\nPopulation (Statistics) Act 1960: makes further provision for collecting statistical detail at registration\n\nRegistration of Births and Deaths Regulations 1987: cover further aspects of the registration of births and deaths\n\nCoroners Act 1988: sets out the procedures to be followed by coroners in handling deaths\n\nStill-Birth (Definition) Act 1992: altered the definition of a stillbirth to 24 or more weeks completed gestation, instead of the previous definition of 28 or more weeks\n\nThe Deregulation (Still-Birth and Death Registration) Order 1996: allows for the registration of deaths by declaration\n\nNational Health Service Act 2006 (amended 2013) and National Health Service (Wales) Act 2006: consolidated legislation relating to the health service and separate provision of the health service in Wales from that in England; the Acts require notification of a birth or death to the local authority and the clinical commissioning group (local health board in Wales) where the birth or death occurred - both Acts include provision for the supply of information on individual deaths to the NHS by the Registrar General\n\nPresumption of Death Act 2013: application can be made to the High Court for a declaration that a missing person is presumed to be dead where the person who is missing is thought to have died or has not been known to be alive for a period of at least seven years\n\nCoronavirus Act 2020: temporary modifications related to registration of deaths and stillbirths, and so on, and reviews to legislation relating to death certification and cremations in the UK during the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\n\nThe UK Statistics Authority is guided by the following:\n\nRegistration Service Act 1953: in Section 19, this required the Registrar General to produce annual abstracts of the number of live births, stillbirths and deaths\n\nStatistics and Registration Service Act 2007: transferred some of the statistical functions of the Registrar General, including the production of an annual abstract, to the Statistics Board, also known as the UK Statistics Authority, and the ONS, which became the executive office of the UK Statistics Authority; the 2007 Act also provides the Registrar General with a power to disclose any information about a birth, death or a stillbirth to the UK Statistics Authority for statistical purposes; it also enables the UK Statistics Authority to produce and publish statistics relating to any matter; the Act also includes a provision for the UK Statistics Authority to supply individual birth and death records to the Secretary of State for Health and certain NHS bodies\n\nWhen the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007 came into force on 1 April 2008, the arrangement where the National Statistician was also the Registrar General for England and Wales ended. At the same time, the General Register Office (GRO) also stopped being part of the ONS and was moved to the Identity and Passport Service. The NHS Central Register (NHSCR), formerly part of the ONS, also transferred to the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), which is now known as NHS Digital.\n\nThe responsibility for the production of mortality statistics is now a function of the UK Statistics Authority, which is required to produce an annual abstract of mortality statistics in order that the Minister for the Cabinet Office can lay it before Parliament.\n\nHistorical changes in mortality data\n\nUsers should note certain changes to the collection and coding of deaths data over the years may affect their interpretation of trends in mortality. These changes include the following.\n\n1979\n\nIntroduction of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), ninth edition. This replaced the eighth edition, used from 1968 to 1978. A 25% sample of death certificates for 1978 was selected and coded to both the eighth and ninth editions to give a guide to the effect of these changes on specific categories.\n\n1981 to 1982\n\nIndustrial action taken by registration officers affected the quality of information about deaths from injury and poisoning. Details normally supplied by coroners were not available; the statistics were significantly affected. Figures on injury and poisoning for 1981, with the exception of suicides, should be treated with caution. Categories such as \"transport accidents\" and \"homicide\" were significantly understated, whereas \"non-specific accidents\" and \"undetermined injuries\" were overstated. Statistics relating to nature of injury were less affected by the absence of the coroners' information. Although industrial action extended into 1982, the coroners' information was collected retrospectively for that year, enabling more accurate figures to be produced. However, complete details to help code the cause of death were still unavailable in 1982. This resulted in more deaths than usual being assigned to \"unspecified\" categories.\n\n1984\n\nOur interpretation of World Health Organization (WHO) Rule 3 was amended in the assignment of underlying cause of death. Series DR for 2006 has more detail. It resulted in a decrease in the numbers of deaths coded to pneumonia and a few other causes and an increase in deaths from many other conditions - most of the latter being small increases. The background to this change is given in the annual volume DH2 number 11 for 1984, which includes a table assessing the numerical effects of changes, by underlying cause. Deaths from injury and poisoning were excluded from this exercise.\n\n1986\n\nSince January 1986, registrars have recorded the following information on the draft entry form:\n\nthe date when the certifying doctor last saw the deceased alive\n\nwhether the deceased was seen after death by a medical practitioner\n\nwhether the death was reported to a coroner and by whom\n\nwhether the certifying practitioner indicated that death might have been linked to the deceased's employment\n\nThe first three items had been recorded on the medical certificate for many years for legal and administrative purposes. The fourth resulted from legislation passed in 1985.\n\n1986\n\nNew stillbirth and neonatal death certificates were introduced in January 1986. The new neonatal certificate included both maternal and fetal conditions. This means that it is not possible to assign an underlying cause for deaths under 28 days. From 1986, therefore, tables of deaths by cause and age do not include neonates, although the all-cause total for neonates is often given. Details of neonatal deaths by cause can be found in our Child and infant mortality statistics bulletin.\n\n1993\n\nWe reverted to the internationally accepted interpretation of Rule 3 operating in England and Wales before 1984 (see Section 16: Background and history of mortality data; subsection: The deaths databases).\n\n1993\n\nRedevelopment of our collection and processing systems, which took effect on published mortality data from January 1993. Changes included:\n\nthe computerisation of registration, with registrars in most local offices entering details on computers and supplying data to the ONS on floppy disk\n\nthe automation of cause of death coding, so that procedures for assigning codes to underlying cause are now automatic for about 80% of all deaths but not used for deaths certified after inquest\n\nthe use of a dynamic database to hold all deaths data, for easy retrieval of up-to-date information; these and other changes are described in Death certification and the epidemiologist\n\n1993\n\nA revised coroner's certificate of cause of death after inquest was introduced in May 1993, which resulted in less detail for many deaths from injury and poisoning (ICD-9 E800 to E999) - both for the description of injury sustained and for the classification of some suicides.\n\nFollowing the introduction of the revised certificate, problems were identified relating to the processing of deaths certified after inquest because of the non-receipt of some data that contained additional detail about some accidental deaths. This resulted in more deaths being assigned to residual categories such as \"other and unspecified causes\" (ICD-9 E928.9). For this reason, the number of deaths coded to suicide and self-inflicted poisoning by motor vehicle gas exhaust (ICD-9 E952.0) declined substantially, while those from suicide and self-inflicted poisoning by other carbon monoxide (ICD-9 E952.1) rose.\n\nTo resolve this problem, we amended our systems and manually coded all deaths that resulted in a coroner's inquest or adjourned inquest. Data were re-coded where necessary for 1993 and 1994. Changes were concentrated in the external causes of the ICD, while the effect on other causes was limited.\n\n1993\n\nEnding of medical enquiries to obtain more precise information on the underlying cause of death.\n\n1997\n\nProvision for registration of a death by declaration was introduced in April 1997, whereby details of a death could be supplied to a registrar in a district other than that where the death took place. Analysis shows that this provision is most likely to be used for deaths of infants and for neonatal deaths in particular.\n\n2001\n\nIntroduction of the ICD-10 for coding cause of death on 1 January 2001. This replaced the ICD-9 used from 1979 to 2000. There are some significant differences between the ICD versions. The main differences are:\n\na change in format of the code and an expansion in the number of codes used\n\na movement of some diseases and conditions between broad groups called ICD chapters\n\nchanges to the rules governing the selection and coding of the underlying cause of death, especially Rule 3, which has had a large effect\n\nWe coded the 1999 registration dataset to both the ICD-9 and ICD-10 to give a guide to the effect of changes on specific categories of cause of death. Results of the ICD-10 bridge coding study, England and Wales, 1999 were published in 2002. Research specifically examining the effect on injury and poisoning was published in The effect of the introduction of ICD-10 on trends in mortality from injury and poisoning in England and Wales.\n\nFurther information about Understanding the changes to mortality statistics following the move to coding cause of death to ICD-10 is also available.\n\n2002\n\nIntroduction of the GRO Network (GRONET) to register offices began, allowing for births and deaths registration details to be sent directly to the ONS via email.\n\n2006\n\nIntroduction of Registration Online (RON) pilot areas enabling registrars to record births, stillbirths, deaths and civil partnerships online instead of using Registration Service Software (RSS).\n\n2007\n\nRON was implemented and, because of significant performance problems, suspended. This resulted in around half the registrars reverting back to using the previous electronic system, RSS.\n\n2009\n\nRON was fully implemented on 1 July 2009. Of all registrations in 2009, there were 83% recorded on RON.\n\n2010\n\nAll deaths recorded using RON.\n\n2011\n\nIn January 2011, the software used for cause of death coding was updated from the ICD-10 version 2001.2 to version 2010. The main changes in ICD-10 version 2010 are amendments to the modification tables and selection rules. Modification tables and selection rules are used to ascertain a causal sequence and consistently assign underlying cause of death from the conditions recorded on the death certificate. Overall, the impact of these changes is small although some cause groups are affected more than others. For further information, see the results of the bridge coding study. There is also another study looking at the impact on stillbirths and neonatal deaths.\n\n2014\n\nOn 1 January 2014, the software used to code cause of death was changed. The new IRIS software version 2013 incorporates official updates to ICD-10 that are approved by WHO. Further information on IRIS can be found in Section 9: Cause of death coding; subsection: Coding the underlying cause of death. A dual coding study looked at the impact on mortality statistics; a further study looked into the impact of the coding changes on stillbirths and neonatal deaths.\n\n2014\n\nOn 1 October 2014, the Presumption of Death Act 2013 came into force in England and Wales. This means that an application can be made to the High Court for a declaration that a missing person is presumed to be dead where the person who is missing is thought to have died or has not been known to be alive for a period of at least seven years.\n\n2017\n\nChanges to the Policing and Crime Act 2017 removed the requirement for a coroner's inquest for every death where Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) were in place. Deaths under DoLS that occurred on or before 3 April 2017 should be treated outside the context of state detention and should only be reported to the coroner where one or more other conditions are met. This should result in a decrease in the number of inquests for natural deaths.\n\n2020\n\nThe Coronavirus Act 2020 included temporary changes to death registration legislation during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n2022\n\nOn 1 January 2022, the software used to code cause of death was changed to the successor of IRIS, which is known as the Multicausal and Unicausal Selection Engine (MUSE) (IRIS version 5.8). The MUSE operates based on internationally agreed decision tables that reflect the most recent version of ICD-10. Further information can be found in our Cause of death coding in mortality statistics, software changes: January 2022 article.\n\nThe Coronavirus Act 2020 ended in March 2022.\n\nBack to table of contents\n\n17.
