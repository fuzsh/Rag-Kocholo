        "text": "Also available is the\n\n80-Year List of Severe Weather Fatalities\n\nPreliminary Hazardous Weather Statistics for 2023 Now Online\n\nThe U.S. Natural Hazard Statistics provide statistical information on fatalities, injuries, and damages caused by weather related hazards. These statistics are compiled from information contained in Storm Data, a database comprising information from NWS forecast offices in the 50 states, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. Public data access, with event-specific information, is made available by the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information using the Storm Events Database.\n\nThe fatalities, injuries, and damage estimates found under “Hurricane/Tropical Cyclone” events are attributed only to the wind. Other fatalities, injuries, and damage associated with other tropical cyclone hazards such as storm surge inundation, rainfall-induced flooding, and tornadoes are listed within their separate event types (e.g., Flood, Tornado). For a complete assessment of the fatalities, injuries, and damage attributed to a specific tropical cyclone, please see the Tropical Cyclone Reports issued by the National Weather Service at www.hurricanes.gov/data/tcr/ index.php."
