        "text": "David Leonhardt\n\nI’m a senior writer at The New York Times who runs The Morning, our flagship daily newsletter.\n\nWhat I Cover\n\nI became a journalist because I am fascinated by the world and enjoy learning about it. I’m lucky that my current job allows me to cover just about everything — politics, economics, global affairs, education, health, climate, culture, sports and more. The Morning newsletter is available to everyone, even if you don’t have a Times subscription, and it’s intended to be a digital version of the print newspaper, albeit with many fewer words: A place where we tell you what you need to know each morning.\n\nMy Background\n\nI have worked at The Times since 1999, first as a business reporter, covering management and the workplace. I’ve also been an economics columnist, the Washington bureau chief, the founding editor of the Upshot section, a staff writer for the Magazine, an Opinion columnist, the co-host of “The Argument” podcast and the head of a team that advised management on The Times’s digital strategy. Before joining The Times, I worked at Business Week magazine and The Washington Post. I majored in applied math at Yale (and I enjoy using data in my reporting). I grew up in and around New York City in a family that read The Times over breakfast every day. My dad was a high school teacher, and my mom worked as a copy editor. I recently published my first book, “Ours Was the Shining Future: The Story of the American Dream,” which The Atlantic and the Financial Times called one of the best books of 2023.\n\nJournalistic Ethics\n\nIf you haven’t read the essay on journalistic independence that our publisher, A.G. Sulzberger, wrote in 2023, I recommend it. It describes the values I aspire to uphold, and I reflected on that essay — and my own coverage of Covid — in a Morning newsletter. Years ago, I also wrote a short article about common forms of media bias and my efforts to avoid them. I periodically write articles that look back on mistakes that I believe I’ve made in my journalism. All Times journalists commit themselves to upholding the standards of integrity outlined in our Ethical Journalism Handbook.\n\nPlease reach me by emailing the team that produces The Morning."
