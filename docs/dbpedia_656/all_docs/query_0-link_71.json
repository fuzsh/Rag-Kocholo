( 1 ) In your February issue, he says I used the wrong I-chm Ching in my book (edited), Shaolin Temple Boxing. Wjll he eat his tongue when he learns tihat tiiis is the style most used in Tai- wan and Hong Kong? Ergo, if I am wrong so are most the many box- ers I know. Perhaps we are all out of step except Hu? (2) He says I mixed up the first three illustrations. He em. The publisher made the miscue and if Hu wants to seardi for truth, let him check with Tuttle Publishing Co. (3) Finally, Hu stated that I said Bodhidharma invented the I-chin Ching \"without giving any proof ex- cept to reiterate popular hearsay.\" For a man professing to know seven languages, Hu should break out his English texts. First of all, I merely \" edited the book written by a Chinese master. Hu said Bodhidharma cre- ated various exercises. I said (foot- note p. 16) \". most authorities as- cribe to Ta Mo authorship of die I- chkl Chin^ and ( frontispiece «nder a picture of Ta Mo) 'traditional father of Shaolin boxing.\" I did not say I though Ta Mo invented any- thing. For really, I doubt that Ta Mo knew any boxing at all. R.W. Smith Bethesda, Md. Confticius once noted that \"it is he who points out your errors who is your friend.\" In keeping with this ax- iom, I pointed out only one of the errors committed by Mr. Robert Smith, while avoiding other of his discrepencies which did not relate to the study of the I-CHIN CHING. I note with intere.it tenets 4 and 6, un- der the section titled \"The Ten Com- mandments\" (pp. 42-43) in Mr. Smith's EDITED work, that \"A stu- dent must be forever kind, honest. and friendly to all his colleagues,\" and \"A boxer must never be belli- cose.\" Wm. Hu Ithaca, N.Y. Sour Grapes? Your editorial in the April issue should have been entitled 'The Sour Taste of Grapes.\" The second half missed the most important point of martial arts; it placed too much em- phasis on team or club c-ompetition. Any competition at a regional, na- tional or world level should be an individual concern, not a team or club concern. An association could be set up, under general rules and sanc- tioned by the AAU, to qualify indi- viduals wishing to compete at these levels. To gear all martial art schools or clubs to the \"assembly line\" mak- ing of champions is to reduce all mar- tial arts to a purely physical sport from competition's sake and would be a step backward. The martial art schools and clubs should remain separate and distinct from amateur competition and should be concerned primarily with self-de- fense, self-discipline, self-confidence, the building of character, and the building of physical and mental well being. The martial arts have never held that beating another man, team or nation in competition was its total and end desire. To construe such in your editorial is a misrepresentation of the true spirit of the martial arts. G. K.Godfirey Torrance, CsM. Your concern for the arts being an individual effort is a valid one. But apparenfhj ijott mi.is the entire point of the editorial. Our argument is not with individual effort. We object to the restricting of competition for the benefit of a few men or a few groups. We want to see more competition open to everyone. But the tourna- ment in question was restricted to just several organizations. Karate players from some other organiza- tions who asked to participate were turned down cold. And some top ka- rate officials of undeniable merit were snubbed. A proven way to raise the individ- ual level of play would he by better tournaments with more players. And this would mean true national tourn- aments open to all players not just ■letups for individual karate organi- zations, which lioi too often been a rule wUh many organixations in the United States. If a system, and its in- struction,is good it should be tested in open competiHon. We have long felt that the competitive spur is one of the best ways to improve karate. We stm feel this way. And so, ap- parently, do other martial sports. In judo, for instance, .some of the very best play comes in tournaments, when the indMdual is trying hardest in the heat of competition. Karate is no different. That's one reason why Gogen Yamaguchi of the Gojuryu school inogurafrd karate tournaments some 30 years, ed. Out of This Universe In my research into karate I have discovered several excellent treatises, not the least of which are Oyama's What is Karate? and Nishiyama's Karate: The Art of \"Empty Hand' Fi^iting. Even George Mattson's book on uechir>'u, while differing in approach, has the basics in common witb every other book I have studied. Recently, however, I came across several books in \"popular\" edition by a man named Bruce Tegner. On the back cover of one the author is de- scribed as being 'spectacularly quali- fied\" and holding the rank of fifth dan, elevated by the \"Japanese soci- ety, the Shukoh-kai.\" After reading the books I am convinced that Mr. Tegner has learned a vastly different form of karate than any I can dis- cover.

Letters (Continued from page 5) He seems to have learned it in a different universe, too, because on every page of each book I am able to discover gross distortions of stan- ces, methods of delivering blows, etc. In one paragraph he describes the various stances of conventional karate as being \"pigeon-toed\" and unbal- anced,\" and avers that his \"T-posi- tion\" is the best of all. To me his 'T\" position looks like a badly formed kokutsu-dachi. In my dojo, (Masami Tsuruoka's) v^'e get a sharp crack with a shinai if we have such form. John A. Smith Toronto, Canada Karate Comes To Birmingham After a three-year struggle and great personal sacrifice, my husband, Hank Parks, has established an active club at the Downtown YMCA in Bir- mingham, Ala. I know how hard Hank has worked and I have shared his plans, hopes, and disappoint- ments. We also have a dojo in our home and Hank often works his more prom- ising students here on his own time. Recently, Hank seriously injured his right hand in an accident with a power saw, leaving him with two stiff fingers. He was hight back teach- ing before the cast was off. This han- dicap has not cooled his enthusiasm one bit. Martha Parks Birmingham, Ala. Can't Win Tliem All I have been reading your maga- zine for some time now and I have enjoyed it too. There have been many interesting articles in it. Lately though . . . there seems to be very few arti- cles of interest anymore and there seems to be not as many pictures, the ones that are put in the maga- zine are not as interesting as they used to be. The cover of your maga- : 'ne is just paintings now and ap>- pears .1 ,y c!rab, where you used to have very colon til pictures for the cover. Last of all the articles seem to constantly say the same old thing. Could you write articles for people who have a knowledge of judo, ka- rate etc., instead as if we all had no knowledge at all of the arts of self- defense. I still enjoy your magazine, but I'm sure these changes would be appreciated by many people. John R. Daniels Solon, Ohio One We Did Win ... I enjoy reading your magazine from cover to cover for the informa- tion it give on the martial arts. I read it over and over again. Doug Wong Roseville, Michigan Local Society Polices Arts An item published in the Blao Belt Times (Feb. '66) concerning our Buffalo Black Belt Society has resulted in an influx of mail request- ing more information. Will you be good enough to find space for the following information? Your help in furthering the martial arts and main- taining high standards in the same is always appreciated. The Buffalo Black Belt Society was formed because there is a need for a local group to police against phony instructors. Such unqualified persons will often defraud the public and have a high number of injuries among their students. They bring a bad name to our arts that is very dif- ficult to erase. The Judo Yudanshaka's and Karate organizations are ill-equipped to do this on a local level. I urge all quali- fied Yudansha to form a Black Belt society in your area before there is a need for one.

P.O. Box 8176 Los Angeles. Calif. 90008 EDITORIAL Rotate the Troublemakers! It is with troubled minds that we begin this editorial, the third and last in a series covering the present troubles of American karate. We have saved for last the most thorny of the issues - the subject of the poor competitive behavior of some of the instructors coming from Japan to teach karate in this country. Though many of these men make the best sensei, teaching the highest caliber of karate, we feel compelled to point out that, in some instances, their high-handed tactics in recruiting for their systems - and for their own enrichment - has gone beyond the bounds of de- cency. These men, by such actions, are driving a deeper wedge in the American karate movement and making cooperation all the more difficult with other more ethical karate men, both American and Japanese. The tactics of the few we speak of are well known to men in the top echelons of American karate, but little has been said publicly for fear of being misunderstood. But it is time the curtain was drawn aside on matters which have re- mained hushed up too long. Take, for instance, the case of one of the big names in karate in this country. This man likes to strut before the public as a karateka whose actions are far above sordid commercialism, in the true sense of the arts. Yet if the truth be known, this pious hypocrite is guilty of some of the most flagrant abuses of commercialism. Having callously usurped the job of the person he was sent here to assist, this man is bent on a ruthless campaign to expand his organization. In one instance, he tried to browbeat a small competitor into joining his chain. If the independent operator'didn't join, the man in question threatened to open another dojo next door and drive him out of the business. The small operator refused to be coerced, and sure enough, found himself in competition with a dojo next door a short time later. Of course, such criticism is not meant to indict the majority of fine Japanese karate men giving us the bene- fit of their teaching in this country. We could mention such names as Ohshima in Los Angeles, Yamaguchi in San Francisco and Mori in Honolulu as being among the first-rate karate men we are blessed with. But it is the actions of the few that are causing trouble and bitter- ness way out of proportion to their numbers. Then there is another aspect to the problem. There are numerous instances where individual instructors are brought over from Japan under the sponsorship of a man who runs a dojo. Often the instructor, and sometimes his wife and family, are brought in at considerable expense to the man who runs the dojo. But then, the greed sets in. We have received a number of letters from dojo operators complaining about instructors biting the hand that feeds them. After getting as much money as he can, the in- structor will sometimes set up a dojo in competition with the former employer, pirating away as many stu- dents as he can. Now needless to say, this sort of thing is not the rule either. But there are enough instances that when dojo operators get together, they talk. And enough of these sort of experiences, and the owner may hesitate to bring over a Japanese instructor next time. Yet that is exactly the situation that we can't afford to see happen. We need these men from Japan precisely because they teach the very best brands of karate. But what we don't need is the aggravation that some bring. Especially we don't need the ones that give the impres- sion that they are over here just to scoop off as much gravy as they can before they head back home. A little more good manners, for which Japan is justly famous, would help a lot in some cases. Also, considera- tion might be given to adopting a system similar to that of aikido in sending instructors abroad. Under this sys- tem, instructors are rotated frequently, sometimes every year, from one country to another. This way, the in- structors don't start to dreaming about carving out rich empires for themselves in the countries which host them. COMING SOON! The Story of The Code of Bushido! Three centuries ago the samurai had fallen on hard times. Poverty-ridden and considered a parasite by his neighbors, the warrior class was threatened with extinction. But at that point a man arose who was to become the greatest ronin of his age. He was Soko Yamada, a man little known outside Japan, who was to reshape the role of the samurai. Fated never to fight on a battlefield, Yamada was destined to fight the most important battle of the samurai - the battle of the mind to create a new place for the samurai in society. His instrument was the code of bushido which he formulated. For his story, and his successes and setbacks, see next month's issue of Black Belt magazine. ©1966 by BLACK BELT, INC.

In just a few short ^ ^ years, the Philippines has become a power in the karate world. The swift rise in Philippines karate is all the more note- worthy considering that the art got off to a late start in this island nation. The Philippines was one of the last Far Eastern countries to accept karate. Memories of the harsh occupation of the Philippines by Japanese soldiers during World War II had blocked acceptance of anything associated with Japan for the first decade following the liberation of the islands. As a result, while karate was spreading to other coun- tries thousands of miles distant, the Philippines islands, which are only 700 miles south of the tip of the Japanese islands, were being leapfrogged. But by the mid-fifties Filipino aversion to things Japanese had begun to dissi- pate. Trade broke the way first and soon commodities marked \"Made in Japan\" were beginning to flow into the Philippines marketplace. From the Judo Ranks And with trade came the first of the Japanese fighting sports, judo. Judo had an easier time because its predeces- sor, jiu-jitsu, had been practiced by a devoted band of Filipinos even before the war. In fact, the Filipino term \"ditso\" (derived from \"jitsu\") means a kind of disbalanc- ing throw. It wasn't until almost five years later — in 1958 — that karate first was introduced to the country. And it was from the ranks of the judomen that most of the pioneers in Philippines karate were to come. Once having gained a foothold, karate caught the imagination of the Filipino and spread like a brushfire through the islands. Today there are — by conservative estimate — more than 500 karate clubs in the Philippines, a figure that ranks the Philippines with any other country outside Japan. It's interesting to note that though wartime bitterness is fading, most of the karate adherents still are youths who have little direct knowledge of World War II conditions. c. 13 But it's not only quantity that counts with the FiHpino brand of karate. It's the quality of its players as well. And they play very well indeed. Last year, a Filipino team finished runnerup to Japan in the Asian Karate Cham- pionships, besting such fine karate lands as Korea and Okinawa, the home of the art. In recognition of the grow- ing importance of the Philippines in the art, this year's Asian championships are being held in Manila, the Philip- pines capital city. Ryusuke Ohtake of the Japan Wado-Ryu School perfomis pinan 4. Long History of Fighting Arts The ease with which the Filipino picked up karate is not surprising in view of his country's geography and long history of association with fighting arts of many Asian countries. The Philippines occupies a strategic cross- roads in Asia, with Japan and Korea to the north, Indo- nesia and Malaya to the south, and China, Thailand and Burma to the west. For 800 years and more the Philip- pines has been influenced by the fighting arts of these countries. And for a number of those centuries, foot-fighting techniques have been extremely popular. Viewed in this light, karate is just the last in a long line of fighting styles to be adopted by a nation of people who have shown themselves to be very adept in combat arts. The earliest fighting influences stemmed from the Indo- Malaysian culture which started to penetrate the islands in the 12th century. In addition, the islands also felt the impact of cultural influences from Thailand and Cam- bodia at this time. 14 SECOND IN ALL ASIA — Gen. RIgoberto Atienza (In uniform), chief of staff of the armed forces, holds trophy awarded to the team for winning second place in last year's Asian Karate Championships. Spanish Try to Suppress Art By the 14th century, a native Filipino art called Amis de Mano had sprung up. Amis is a type of sabre play in which a pair of short wooden or rattan canes is used. It is believed that before the Spanish colonization of the Philippines in the 15th century, the ancient Filipinos were already skillful in the art of dagger and broad-sword play. With the Spanish conquest, the Filipinos yielded their arms and fighting weapons to the conquerors and training in the martial arts was suppressed. However, the Spaniards were unable to stamp out the training of Amis altogether. Masters and students estab- lished training sites in the mountains and forests and continued to train and develop the art. It was only a century later, after a more widespread Hispanization of the Archipelago was achieved, that Amis de Mano was allowed to exist in the open as a sport and for exhibition purposes. The techniques of Amis have been preserved to this day and there is a revival of interest in the art among Filipino youth. Real Daggers Another native martial art that closely follows the rudiments of Amis is Silai. But Silat makes use of true sabres and daggers instead of rattan and wodden canes. Silat flourished as a secret form of combat exclusive to the royal families of the southernmost and predominantly Muslim section of the country. The art is said to have originated from a merging of the pre-Spanish Amis and a type of swordplay from an exclusively Muslim-Arabic source. But the two Filipino fighting styles that are very similar to Karate in that they use basically fist and foot techniques are Sikaran and Kuntaw. Kuntaw's sly cat-like move- ments are reminiscent of Chinese Karate. Like the ex- clusive Silat, it is also said to be an old secret combat art of Muslim-Arabic origin. But Kuntaw is fast becom- ing extinct. Its masters are aging, while only a few stu- dents continue to train and develop in this still secret art. Ci i iterial Sikaran is an old combat art typical of Chinese foot- fighting, which became popular in the provinces surround- ing Manila (Black Belt, April 1966). Sikaran was played by two individuals, or two teams, within the f)erimeter of a rice paddy during the dry sea- son. Sikaran developed a body of highly disabling foot- work techniques called Panghilo or knock-out blows. One of the fatal techniques, the biakid, is a kick delivered exactly the opposite of the Karate roundhouse kick: the force is concentrated on the back thrust of the heel. The back of the opponent's head is the vital target point A jumping front kick called Padamba, with the heart as the vital target, is executed almost exactly like the mae tobi geri. Latino Gonzales, left, Philippines karate pioneer, and his chief instructor, Seichi lha. Three Styles of Karate Moves are underway to try to preserve the best of these old fighting arts and to merge them with modem techniques to develop a truly Filipino type of Karate. At present, there are three main currents of karate in Philippines — the Shorinjo school of Okinawa; the Korean Soo Bahk Do style of karate; and the shotokan school as represented by the Japanese Karate Association (JKA). The man who first brought karate to the Philippines is Latino Gonzales, who heads the country's largest karate dojo, the Commando Karate Self-Defense School in Ma- nila. Latino's dojo is one of the most spacious karate dojos in Asia and has an enrollment of more than 400 students. Gonzales is also the president of the Philip- pine Amateur Karate Association, which has 10 affiliated clubs in Manila and various provinces. Judo Black Belter Bom in Jaro, IloiloCity, Southern Philippines, in 1911, Gonzales has been an enthusiast of various sports. He is an Arnis expert, boxer, weightlifter, and physical cul- turist. In 1938 he first learned Judo from a Japanese sailor who stayed for a time in Iloilo City. But it was much later, in 1956, that he officially joined the Philip- pine Amateur Judo Association and became a first Dan. However, in 1958, he made a crucial shift to Karate which was then virtually an unknown martial art to Fili- pinos. He had become interested in the art by reading books and by corresponding with internationally known Karate masters. In the same year, 1958, Gonzales established the first Karate school in the Philippines at Echague in downtown Manila. Starting with less than 20 students, the school was soon to grow in enrollment as well as in prestige. Out of the variety of Karate styles from the various masters that early influenced Gonzales, he gradually laid emphasis on Okinawan karate. And his school became a legally registered and recognized member of the Miya- hira and Okinawa Shorinjo Kyokai last year. Seichi lha, an Okinawan fifth Dan from the Miyahira Shorinjo Karate, is presently in Manila working with Gon- zales as instructor at the Commando Karate Self-Defense School. With the assistance of Seichi lha, Gonzales has just finished writing a book on the Shorinjo style entitled THE TECHNIQUES OF KARATE, the first Karate book written by a Filipino author. Captain Meliton Geronimo is president of the Karate Brotherhood of the Philippines (KBP), the largest karate federation in the country. Like Gonzales, Geronimo has been an avid sports enthusiast. In 1952 while still a lieutenant in the Philippine Air Force, Geronimo started to train in Jiu-jitsu under Pedro Garcia and Dionisio Aquino. When the Philippine Amateur Judo Association was established in 1953 he continued his training in Judo under Francisco Solomon and Lieutenant Burgher of the U. S. Army. Again like Gonzales, he shifted to Karate in 1958 and trained under a Japanese Engineer, Koichi Kondo, and Philippine Air Force Captain Domingo Polotan, both of the All-Japan Karate Association. That same year Geron- imo established the Blue Diamond Karate club at Nichols Air Base, with 200 members. This club became, a year later, a nucleus for the Karate Brotherhood of the Philip- pines. In 1964, Geronimo headed a Philippine Karate team which competed at the First Asian Karate Tournament in Tokyo and Utsonomiya City, where in a field tourna- ment he was promoted to 3rd dan by Fusakichi Ko- bayashi, president of the All-Japan Karate Association (AJKA). The Philippine team in the middleweight cate- gory received a letter of citation for the \"best technique and best fighting ability\" from the AJKA. KARATE WITH A DASH OF THE PHILIPPINES - Capt. Geronimo demonstrates the biakid, a reverse roundhouse kick developed In the Philip- pines by Sikaran (foot fighting) experts. Bernardo Belleza, winner of the heavyweight division in last year's Asian championships, breaks tiles with his head. Switches to Korean Style In 1965, Geronimo again headed the Philippine dele- gation to the Second Asian Karate Tournament sponsored by the Korean Soo Bahk Doo Association. The Philippine team took second place in the general standing. In in- dividual standings, Bernardo Belleza copped the heavy- weight championship, Emilio Galisinao the middleweight championship, and Eduardo Miraflor the lightweight run- ner-up. Though he started out with the AJKA, Geronimo in recent years has favored the Korean brand of karate. Last year, after an examination conducted by Dr. Kwai Byong Yun and Mr. Hwang Kee, president and vice- president respectively of the Korean Soo Bahk Doo Asso- ciation, Geronimo was promoted to 4th Dan in the or- ganization. 17 c iterial still highballing along Geronimo's KBP was begun with only a half dozen member clubs, but has grown into a federation of over 40 affiliated clubs representing eight provinces of the country. The KBP will play host to the Third Asian Ka- rate Tournament to be held this summer. Youngest of the Leaders The first Filipino to train and receive a black belt de- gree directly from the Japan Karate Association (JKA) is Ceferino Vasquez, Jr., the youngest up-and-coming Ka- rate instructor in the country. The 24-year-old Vasquez was among the students of the Spanish Filipino combat master, the late Narciso Yabos who trained in Karate in the early 1930's under Japanese instructors. Vasquez first studied Arnis, then Judo, and later Karate from Yabos. Vasquez then went to Japan and trained with the JKA for five months, re- ceiving his 1st dan in 1965. Upon returning to the Philippines, he established the All-Philippines Karate Federation by merging all the Ka- rate clubs in his home town of Bacolod City in Southern Philippines and some from the Greater Manila area. The APKF, \\yhose president in Dionisio Vasquez, an uncle of Vasquez, has a total of 12 affiliated clubs. Through the efforts of such men as these, karate has experienced, if not a stable growth, at least a spectacular one in the Philippines. But karate also has its share of problems in the Philippines as in all other countries. The development of different styles of karate has been a divisive element. But a movement is underway, spear- headed by Captain Geronimo, to consolidate all karate federations into one organization to gain the recognition of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation, a govern- THEY START THEM YOUNG - The author demonstrates to a group of young students a dynamic tension exercise for strengthening the forearm block. 18 c> iterial The Negros Karate group, winners of a goodwill regional tournament ment agency that supports and guides all nationally es- tablished sports in the country. And there is no doubt that at least some of the current crop of karate students have been attracted to icarate be- cause of a kind of social prestige to be gained by taking up the latest international sportscraze. But as with all fads, there is always the chance that it will not be able to hold the interest of its members and will see them drop out. Such a development now seems to be taking place in the United States. But for the moment, karate seems to be highballing along in this former U. S. possession. An added boost to the art is coming from the holding of the Third Asian Karate Championships here this summer. An elaborate program is planned for the tournament. The holding of such tournaments is an attempt to try to promote and to elevate the art of karate throughout Asia. The two major organizations concerned with the toumey are the Japan Karate Association and the Ko- rean Soo Bahk Doo Association. There have been pro- posals put forth that the nations involved should form an Asia Karate Association, but no steps have been taken in this direction. However, .the groups involved with the Asian championship tournaments have reached a mutual understanding on general rules for training and tournament play. By its spreading out to cooperate with other Asian countries, the Philippines thus seems to assure that its The intermixture of styles bears watching Style of play will continue to improve. The adoption of some native movements and techniques into standard ka- rate also may serve to improve the already formidable fighting elements of this art. This is a development that bears some watching by other countries for the future. 19 c- The FrincGss Caused a Scandal by Her Fascination for Wrestlers by William C.C. Hu & Kim Pyung Soo ' 1 % oreans this month will celebrate one of their ^^f\\ gear's most joyous festival days. The occasion V is Tan-O day, held to commemorate the end of Spring plowing and planting. On this day, Koreans in both city and coutry leave their homes for a romp in the outdoors. Gatherings are held for swinging and dancing to tunes by country musicians, who wear paper hats in the shape of flowers. Mothers dress their children in new brightly- colored clothes and touch each cheek with a dab of pink powder. Girls wash their hair in iris water mixed with sweet-flags and then do up their tresses with flowers and lotus blossoms. Big Day for Sumo On this day, swings are hung for the girls from large oak and alder trees. Even in times of old when it was the custom for girls to remain secluded they were allowed on this day the diversion of swinging under the great, green trees. In an ancient Korean epic, the hero remarked that the girls in their gaily colored dresses look alternately like falling flowers on the downswing and like twittering magpies soaring off into the blue on the upswing. But besides these colorful activities, Tan-O day in Korea has another special significance. It marks the of- ficial opening of the summer Sumo season. And to Ko- reans, this is serious business indeed. For in this small country. Sumo, while not as important as it once was, is still the national sport. For many Koreans Tan-O day is the equivalent of, say, the opening day of the baseball season in the United States or the first running of the bulls in Spain. On Tan-O day, sumo contests are held up and down the land in conjunction with the day's festivities. To Korean men, the matches are the high point of the day's activities. While the girls are occupied with their swing- ing, the men gather on a grassy hillside or around a sandy stretch of ground to watch the sumo wrestlers. These matches are eagerly attended by Korean males of all ages, for Sumo, ssirem as it is officially called, is not only a sport for participants but also a great spectator sport. 20 Copyrighted material The art of wrestling is thousands of years old. But every year in Korea around this time it's the same old story as excitement begins to rise with the onset of the sumo season. To the Victor goes the Ox At many of the smaller gatherings in the countryside, the local stalwarts compete to test their strength and ability or just for the sheer joy of mixing it up with a friendly opponent. But at the larger festival sites, big prizes arc often awarded the victors. The first prize is usually an ox, which is highly valued by the fanners of this largely agricultural country. Usually the people from the village that produced the champion form a big parade in which the champion rides proudly home atop his newly won prize. Wrestling is an ancient sport and during its long his- tory ssirem contests have been associated with national holidays. Other festival days on which ssirem events are held are chusuk, or the moon festival in August, and hamik, or new year's day. Sumo is a typical East Asian sport and is popular also in Japan, China and Mongolia. According to written rec- ords, ssirem was known by various names — kakjo, kakhi, samgbak, and chunkyunhi. In China, wrestling was known as kakhio or koryohi, meaning a Korean sport. The word ssirem is believed to have originated with the Mongolian word sselnem, which means wrestling. The Japanese can trace their sumo origins back several thousand years. But no one is quite sure just when ssirem came to the land of the koryohi. However, Koeryu (Ko- rean) murals on the wall of an ancient stone chamber in Kakjo Mountain in T'unjkou, Chian Prefecture in Man- churia, depict scenes of wrestling. Presumably these mu- rals date back to the fourth century, so it is safe to assume that the people of Koeuryo already enjoyed the sport. Toughens Up the Troops Writings throughout history are studded with references of wrestling, and many of the ancients — both men and women — were enthusiasts of the sport. The oldest Chin- ese book mentioning wrestling is the Li-chiyueh-ling, in which it is recorded that the Emperor ordered his gen- erals to hold wrestling contests in midwinter to help toughen up the troops. Emperor Wu-ti of Han had wrestling listed among the 100 sports of the time. Later, wrestling came to be promoted in such north Asian king- doms as Liao, Chin and Yuan. In the 14th century, there was something akin to a court scandal in Korea because the wife of the ruling emperor Chunghye was such an ardent enthusiast of the sport. Some of the more strait laced members of the court believed it unladylike of the empress, a Mongolian princess, to be a promoter of such a rough sport. Great wrestlers have been showered with acclaim and honors throughout the centuries. Ancient rulers con- sidered the promotion of wrestling as vital to elevate the physical aptitude of their warriors. There are many in- stances of future generals first having been discovered through their prowess in wrestling. For example, General Kimeuk-ryung who lived in the 1 6th century and rendered distinguished service to his country during the Japanese invasion was the greatest wrestler of his day. 22 The great ones have been acclaimed for centuries. Essential to warrior spirit Not as formalized as Japanese sumo Outweighed by Japanese Troubled Times Sumo is still highly popular in Korea. But it has slipped lately from the prominence it once hejd. One big reason is the tremendous influx of foreign sports into the country since the end of World War II. And since Korea is a poor country, Sumo has not prospered of late. An indication of sorts may be gained by comparing the overalls and rough clothing that Korean sumo wrestlers wear in comparison to the richly decorated and expensive paraphernalia worn by Japanese sumo wrestlers. And in Korea, there are no lavish sumo halls where the wrestlers are cared for and waited upon according to traditions dat- ing back centuries. Korean sumo is also not quite so stylized as its Japan- ese counterpart and it takes on something more of the roughhouse aspect of a people's sport. While still strong in the rural areas, it is in the cities especially that sumo has fallen on harder times. But there are plans afoot to restore the national sport to its former glory. As part of this, a national ssirem contest is held annually in the capital of Seoul and tournaments are being staged with wrestlers from other countries. There are other differences between Japanese and Ko- rean sumo. There's the matter of weight, for instance. The top Korean heavyweights weigh usually more than 200 pounds, which is heavy for a Korean. But they are usually almost pygmy-like in comparison to beefy profes- sional Japanese sumo wrestlers who sometimes get up to 400 pounds. Kneel At The Start The Korean method of beginning the match is also unique. Before starting the match, the two contestants kneel down and lean against each other. Both players have the salba, a thick strand of cloth, wound around their waists and thighs and another piece of cloth wrapped around the wrists. These pieces of cloth are for gripping and hence keep the hand from slipping. While in the kneeling position, the players run their left arms up the elbow and through the soft sash worn by contestants on their right side. With their right hand they grasp the cloth on the adversary's wrist. Upon the referee's signal, the two wrestlers stand up very cautiously. The left hand is ordinarily used to pull or push the op- ponent while the right hand is free to carry out different techniques. In general, there are three broad groups of tactics used in the sport of Korean ssirem. The first is duryochiki which is concerned with lifting techniques. Second, there are the hand tactics son ki-sul used to slap an opponent's knee or leg to tumble him. The third general tactic are those for the leg bal ki-sul. These involve the tangling of an opponent's leg in order to trip him. Bae-ji-ki, or lifting technique CONTINUED ON NEXT PAGE 23 Nothing Subtle Here Ssirem is not a little man's game. It's one sport where weight is a big advantage. In the first place, a large man is not easy to move. Ssirem wrestlers try to move around flat-footed to keep themselves from being unbalanced. At the same time, the more powerful a wrestler, the easier, it is to unbalance an opponent and to use the specialized sunio techniques which rely on strength. As might be expected from all this, ssirem is definitely not a subtle type of wrestling. It is quite different from, say, judo, which has hundreds of different techniques. In judo, many of the types of throws are exciting to watch as one opponent spins another through the air. And there is a whole different set of judo techniques to apply while lying on the mat. But in sumo, the first man to hit the mat is the loser. The whole basic strategy of sumo is to get the man to fall or be tripped to the mat. Even if a hand hits the floor the match is over. The techniques are basically simple ones. Essentially, it's a push and pull type of thing with the definite advantage going to the bigger and more power- ful man. However, given these narrow limits, many sumo men become highly proficient and quite skillful in their use of techniques. In all, there are several dozen different techniques used by the ssirem wrestlers. Baejkige is a lifting technique in which both arms are used to try to raise an opponent or throw him. Right baejkige is used to throw a man over the right shoulder, and left baejkige is for throwing over the left shoulder. The left baejkige is usually harder to parry for a right-handed person. Inside and Outside Another lifting technique is samsami. In this case, the attacker lifts his opponent with both arms, and then quickly slips his hands between the opponent's legs. In this case, the left hand must be freed very quickly after standing up. The lucky man at left standing among other tourney winners has won a bull for taking first place in a tournament 24 A push-and-pull sort of sport Geoli is a good example of tripping techniques. In this technique, one contestant will lock his leg or foot behind an opponent's and push against him forcefully. There are two types of geoli — angeoli, which means locking inside the legs, and baggeoli, which means locking outside. The hand tactics are highly developed in ssirem. In one technique, abnurum, the contestant strikes hard and swift- ly at the opponent's kneecap, causing the leg to buckle and the opponent to 'sink. A real master of this particular type of trick is said to be capable of dropping even a bull in this fashion. Another type of technique is the kogdujabi. In this instance, the right palm grips the back of the opponent's head and the attacker then steps backward, causing the opponent to tumble. Another technique has no name but is simple to understand. This is to grab either of the op- ponent's legs with a hand and yank the opponent quickly to try to drop him. There are other techniques, but they are derived essentially from the basic forms given. Korean champ Kim Hak Yong The Champ Likes Bae-ji-ki The reigning champion of Korean ssirem is a squat, chunky graduate of Taegu University. He's 30-year-old Kim Hak Yong, who weighs 225 pounds and stands only five feet, eight inches high. Kim won the championship while still a college student and has successfully defended his title ever since. He uses all three types of tactics ef- fectively, as might be expected of a champion. But he generally limits himself to one favorite technique from each general tactic. For instance, his favorite lifting technique is bae-ji-ki. He will pull his opponent's abdomen to his waist and then arch his back to lift the man and try to toss him. In hand tactics, he uses an inside and outside slap to the opponent's knee. For leg tactics, Kim likes to try to ensnare the upper part of his opponent's thigh with his leg, and then deliver a sharp kick to the ankle to upend his man.

Contrary to what you might believe, simple self-defense is not always a legal defense. by Irvin Boyd Green hat if you are attacked in the streets and forced to defend yourself? What are the legal conse- quences if you have to employ your judo or karate or any of the other martial arts in resisting the attack? The question is a natural one that many in the arts are curious about. But the answer may be a lot more complicated than you thought. Everyone \"knows,\" of course, that acting in self-defense is perfectly legal. But is it always? Anyone who places his sole faith in that simple solution is unaware of the pitfalls and technicalities of the law. Depending upon the circum- stances, there is the question as to the justification for self- defense and, equally important, the extent of self-defense necessary. In attempting to explain the general aspects of the law, each student of the arts should recognize that the punish- ment of a crime may be treated differently in different states and cities. In addition, there is also the question of the attitude of the arresting officer, the judge, and the jury. Since the Oriental fighting arts are still rather new in this country, the question of the attitude can be an im- portant one. If all this sounds a little complicated, you're right. In dealing with such situations, I always recall the advice of a sensei I once heard advising his students on this ques- tion: \"Stay out of trouble at all costs because, as a practi- cal matter, when the police come both you and your as- sailant are wrongdoers in the eyes of the law.\" That may not always be the case, but it's a practical rule of thumb to go on. From an attorney's point of view, he would prefer that his client had a virtually unassailable legal case. Ideally, the client would have been stopped by a brick wall with no way to escape, attacked by an assailant with a deadly weapon in his hand, and been aware of the attacker's known reputation as a violent and brutal person. Even then, it would be preferable if the attack had taken place in your own home! Anything less than this might open the case up to legal technicalities. Of course, we lawyers can't always have things the way we want them. Listed below are a series of incidents ex- plaining the legal responsibilities in different circum- stances. To capsulize the law of self-defense, it can be stated that generally you may defend yourself against un- lawful attack, even though the attack was not intended to produce previous bodily harm or death. Greer v. State, 120 Texas Cr. R 21, Stinnett v Commonwealth of Virginia (CCA Va. 1932 ) 55 F (2nd) 644. But don't forget that word generally. Keeping this in mind, let us take a series of specific cases. You have just finished a good workout in the dojo and leave with a feeling of contentment and exhilaration. Un- der your arm you have your gi securely bundled together with your belt around it. As you approach the comer going toward the lot where you parked, you pass two men. One calls you the vilest of names, and in addition, in- cludes the female members of your family. Looking over your shoulder, you tell him you are going on your way and don't want any trouble. You keep walking toward your car parked a few blocks away. If you had stopped and creamed the hurler of the epi- thets, self-defense coiild not be pleaded. Profane remarks, words and conduct, unaccompanied by an overt hostile act, do not justify an assult. Lehman v. Lambert, 329 Missouri, 1147, 49 S.W 2d 65 Hageman v Arnold. 79 Montana 91, 254 P. 1070 Now, you are still walking, and hearing footsteps be- hind, you turn your head and you see the two of them running in your direction. Why not stop and face them? The answer is that you have not been attacked. ABOUT THE AUTHOR Irving Boyd Grean is the legal advisor to the New York Yudanshalcai (JBBF) and also legal advisor to the Northeast Division of the American Judo and Jiu Jitsu Federation. In addition, he is an active black belt instructor and director of the Nisei Judo and Jiu Jitsu Club in the Bronx, New York. Exercising good judgment, you start jogging into the parking lot, reach your car, fumble for the key, and just get it into the lock. You try to open the door when you find a foot shoved against the door. You hear the same voice behind that foot, shouting those infuriating insults. 28 Copyrighted material 1 You instinctively know that you could wrap your hand and foreaim around that foot, grab the toes of his shoe and press down with your other hand, at the same time gripping your wrist. You know that all you have to do to break his ankle is to lift your forearm and lean bade. Hien again you simply could have turned around, ram- med your finger in his throat, shoving him backward into his friend behind. But would you not have been an aggres- sor at this stage of your self-defense? However, you remember the words of your sensei, \"Stay out of trouble,\" and you contain yourself, with dignity. Thus far, neither of Aese two men have put a hand on you. The two men back up, but suddenly the trouble- maker turns, walks toward you, extending the open palm of his left hand as if to slap you and rough you up a bit. Now is the time you must decide whether to accept the slap, or exert only that degree of force necessary to re- sist this mild attack. Instinctively, you summon yoar kei and with the knife edge of your right forearm, you easily block his arm. You would be justified in resisting an assult with such force as is reasonably necessary under aO die circunistanoes present to prevent the continuance of harm. Cain V SkiUin. 219 Alabama 228, 121 So. 521 SmUh o. Drew, 175 Washinf^on 11, 26 p (2d) 1040 But here is an important point to keep in mind. If you have blocked hard enough to break his arm, blocked and locked, thereby separating his shoulder, or grabbed his arm with one hand, and at the same time, wrapping his neck hard in the crook of the elbow of your other arm, throwing him to the ground, your force would have been excessive. And while \"aggression of the adversary may be proven to establish justification for the use of necessary force,\" {Tankersley v. Fortner, 170 Arkansas 1014, 282 S.W. 354), it wiU not hdp you if you go gung ho. Now let us carry this scenario a step further. Assume Aat as the thug went to slap you, you noticed that, taped between his second and third closed fingers, is a razor blade coming at you at eye-level— your eye! You are now engaged in mortal combat. Assume you sidestep his open-hand blow, grab his arm and execute an over-the-shoulder throw. Assume further that his head strikes the hard pavement and he dies from such injuries. He is now the victim of murder by your hand. In court you fight for your life. The district attorney has established that no weapon was found at the scene. (The razor must have become disengaged from the tape on deceased's fingers.) His friend, who ran away during the fi{^t, testifies that he and his friend were going to their car and stopped to ask you for a match, or they saw^ your gi and waiited to inquire abojjt a school of self- defense. 30 Your lawyer tries to show the deceased was a violent and brutal man, but It is necessary for him to establish that you knew of the deceased's reputatbm in Ae com- munity, prior to the act. You can almost hear the verdict of \"Guilty.\" You try to think back. Then you remember that for the past few years you heard students in the dojo talk about fights in tfie neighborhood. You remember witnessing a fight out- side a nearby tavern and discussing the incident with others who knew the attacker. From these discussions, you learned about his reputation in the community as a violent and brutal man. In People v. Gaimari, ll6 N.Y. 84, 95, 68 N.E. 112, it was held that when the accused pleads that he acted in self-defense, it is c(Hnpetent to show the general reputa- tion of the deceased for violence. You are finally acquitted, and your trial is over. Once again you are at your dofo. This time, after a session, you leave with a friend, and should someone else be attacked, have your friend prevent the commission of a crime, and you be the witness. You have learned from your court ex- perience. For the honorable student, it is suggested that you practice your self-defense in a dojo rather than employ it on the street and have to assert it as a plea in a oour of law. Get away from the source of the trouble. Good legal talent comes high. For those who have heard that the hands and feet are never considered weapons, it mi^t be instructive to note the following cases. Anything used in such a way that may produce death or grievous bodily harm could very well be considered a dangerous or deadly weapon. It has been held that a shoe or boot was such a weapon when used to kick the head of a victim lying on the ground. Gross o. State, 61 Georgia App. 521, 7 S.E. 2d 87. Should the brute, skilled in the use of his feet, have a courteous exterior and remove his shoe before kicking the helpless victim in the head, would not the foot be considered a dangerous weapon? And if the foot, why not the hand? It should be borne in mind that the student of the mar- tial arts, whether his skill be Judo, Jiu-jitsu, Aikido, Ka- rate, Kenpo, Gung Fu, Tan Soo Do, or whether he poses- ses combined skills, the law was not made with kbn par- ticularly in mind. There doe? come a time in the training of a student when he might like to determine for himself the efficacy and the practicality of his training. That is why there should be instilled in the student the courage and pride enabUng him to walk with confidence, even to walk away frtxn the problem with confidence. >^ Copyrighted material Black Belt's Anniversary Special Discount Certificate A 20% discount certificate will be mailed to you to purchase any merchandise advertised by Martial Arts Supplies Co.

Cl 31 iterial The Power and The Stance Riding the into the Opponent's Center Once the world's greatest judo player, Taka- hiko Ishikawa now is considered by many to be the finest judo instructor in the United States. he highest ranking judo man in the United States is a mild mannered former world cham- M pion who preaches anything but a mild man- ^^-^ nered style of judo. Takahiko Ishikawa, who came to this country eight years ago to teach judo to the U.S. Air Force, is not a man who believes that the \"gentle way\" of judo should be taken too literally — at least not when competing on the tatami. Ishikawa, who is an 8th dan, is an advocate instead of what might be called power judo. By this is not meant that he stresses strength alone. Ishikawa is too brilliant a tech- nician for this. But he is also in that camp that holds that little men do not make world champions. Hence, he holds that a proper blend of strength and mastery of techniques is needed to turn out the well- rounded judo fighter. This does not mean that a man has to be a hulking bruiser to win the world championship. Ishikawa, for instance, weighed only 185 pounds when in 1949 and again in 1950 he won the all-Japan judo cham- pionships, which in those days was the same as the world championship. More Dynamic Approach What Ishikawa does mean, however, is that a man of, say, average size can build up his strength and his weight to the point where he will be a formidable contender. And what is true for the heavier weights also holds for those judo players in the lighter categories. They can improve themselves and their game by building up their strength. Just hpw a judo player goes about building up strength is what distinguishes Ishikawa from many judo teachers. No slave to the past, Ishikawa urges that a \"more dynamic and imaginative approach to the methodology of judo training be instituted.\" Ishikawa has spelled out his approach in a book he co- authored with Donn Draeger, \"Judo Training Methods.\" In essence, what he argues for is the merging of weight training techniques with traditional judo training methods. Working out with weights and lifting weights is one of the best methods for a judo player to build a powerful body, he holds. This so-called power type of judo has had its critics. Some contend that the reliance on strength detracts from techniques and the essence of the art of judo. Others have said that this represents a radical departure from traditional judo trainmg. 32 iterial Strength of King Kong But Ishikawa has replied that \"no system is as good as it could be.\" And he does not believe in blind adherence to the past just to venerate the past. \"In judo, veneration for the past and conservatism,\" he says, has inhibited the progress of judo \"by sole adherence to traditional training methods.\" If current \"old-fashioned\" methods are held to, he continues, \"there is little chance for advancement in knowledge or ability.\" Ishikawa argues in his book that Jigoro Kano, founder of judo, was not opposed to strength in judo, but to the \"un- necessary expenditure of strength.\" Hence, he says, the \"myth\" has been spread that strength is unnecessary. In an amusing passage, Ishikawa cites the case of British experts, who are advocates of strength in judo, explaining the use of the \"gentle way\" in the techniques of kuzushi (unbalancing an opponent) : \"You grasp the jacket lightly, gently, ever .so .softly with three fingers of each hand, and then . . . YOU PULL WITH THE STRENGTH OF KING KONG.\" While he still speaks fervently on the subject, it might be said that Ishikawa has already won his argument to a Ishikawa, right rear, attends Detroit meeting of JBBF official considerable extent. Many of the world's top judo players are advocates of training with weights. Former world cham- pion Anton Geesink was a weight lifting champion in his native Holland. Current world champ Isao Inokuma is a strong advocate of training with the weights. So are Ameri- can stars such as Ron Campbell and James Bregman. Loses Post Ishikawa began his judo training at the age of twelve. His father was an instructor in chiropractic at the High School Judo Institute and was proficient in a number of sports. By the time he was ready for college, the young Ishikawa was already a formidable judo player. He enrolled to study at the Judo college and stayed on after graduation as an assistant professor. When war came, he was sent to Manchuria and spent four years on the Russian-Manchurian border. When the war was over, Ishikawa came home to find he was out of a job. The Judo College had been closed by the Allied armies as being militaristic. He landed a job instead as a judo in- structor for the Metropolitan Police Department in Tokyo. Ishikawa had arrived home from the war weak and sick. Yet in four short years he built himself up to the point where he was able to win the all-Japan champion- BELT LIBRARY You ma) purchasi back is for 600 i A savings of 4( history of '^^^t.rate N^-^^-y^\"^^^'\"''\"\"' I ■ covers former karate cm™ \"\"\"\"tti.a ground 01 J«»\" \"SJw CTicago, Go . fai e«plain» the uo- r\\,o 'eA-* highlights an Vol. 2 *3 CMay-June ^> « 3^ and a actual f.ght '^^^^ .Vur s such as the a-^; - rru.

He credits the victory not only to his particular training methods, but also to mental discipline, the second great pillar in the Ishikawa's technique. Ishikawa believes that mental training in its way is just as important as physical training. He believes that you have to tell yourself, over and over again, that you're going to win in competition. This is repeated until you get to believe it. This training of mind and spirit is, of course, a familiar refrain from the old code of bushido. Strange Byways But there are practical applications of it. When Ishikawa was still active in competition, he put his mind to work before going out to meet an opponent. He always planned his strategy and his moves carefully before ever stepping on the tatami. He is a great believer in studying as many techniques as possible to learn to be able to handle any situa- tion that may arise on a tatami. But in competition, he advises that a contestant promptly forgets about most of these techniques and stick to one or two that he knows thoroughly. The time to ad lib, he believes, is not when you're out on the tatami in competition. When you're out there, he feels, you'd better know exactly what you're doing, and have your moves plotted out. Ishikawa's fascination by mental training and the power of the mind has, at times, approached almost the mystical. In his search to discover more about the hidden secrets of the mind, Ishikawa's travels have taken him down some strange byways. He has always been very curious about philosophical systems and religious cults that have empha- sized the power of the mind. One light-hearted incident in this connection is told by an American who trained under Ishikawa in Tokyo. Ishikawa had heard about a man who claimed to be a Kami Sama (a god, or a man who has contact with the gods). Ishikawa asked the American and another judo player to escort him to the home of the Kami Sama to see if there was anything to it. At the Kami Sama's residence, they joined a group of people sitting around the floor cross-legged in the Buddhist meditative position. The Kami Sama told them that they were to concentrate and to try to receive some sort of experience. After a few minutes, the American opened his eyes and peeped at Ishikawa, who was concentrating furiously. When they left a short while later, the three friends asked each other if any had received an experience. Sheepishly, they all admitted they hadn't and raced down the alley laughing loudly. To this day, when the American meets Ishikawa, he asks him, \"Sensei, have you received any experience?\" Ishikawa still hasn't, but it hasn't dimmed his enthusism for the power of the mind. The Generals Wanted Him Ishikawa first came to the United States in 1957 with the backing of Air Force chief of staff Gen. Curtis LeMay and Gen. Thomas Power, at that time head of the Strategic Air Command. Gen. Power is a 4th degree black belt. And the cigar-chomping LeMay, who later was replaced by Power, holds the special judo rank of yudansha taigu, which U.S. Air Force Photo. General Lemay . . . is given to top world leaders who have made great contri- butions to the sport. Ishikawa was invited to this country to give judo dem- onstrations to the Air Force and to train Air Force per- sonnel to be instructors in the sport. It was because of the efforts of Gens. Power and LeMay, and such top instructors as Ishikawa, that the Air Force today has such a widely developed judo program, one which is far in advance of any of the other armed services. Ishikawa today teaches at his own dojo at 207 North Broad St. in downtown Philadelphia. Ishikawa has the entire fifth floor of the building, where he currently in- structs about 200 students. He also spends a good deal of time travelling around refereeing judo bouts, and is con- sidered one of the top referees in the country. Puckered \"O\" Ishikawa is 50 years old now, and his weight has gone up to 210 pounds. But he still hasn't lost any of his en- thusiasm for judo. He is a delight to judo fans who attend the bouts he referees, because his face is filled with anima- tion and interest with what is happening on the tatami. His mouth seems constantly puckered in a round \"O\" of amaze- ment whenever a throw is made or a good move accom- plished. Off the tatami, Ishikawa is a pleasant-mannered and soft spoken gentleman of the old school of Japan. He doesn't speak much, and when he does it's usually about judo. But even then, he does not speak as if he were an oracle dis- pensing wisdom, but is often rather humble in expressing an opinion. He never says, for instance, this is the way, but rather, \"this is my opinion.\" And he is still willing to learn judo wherever and when- ever he can. After a tournament once, he surprised a 38 Ci U.S. Air Force Photo. . . . and Power wanted him young West Coast judo contestant, who is a 3rd dan, by asking the young man to teach him a technique he had demonstrated in competition. \"/ really felt a little strange 'teaching' the great Sensei,\" the 3rd dan said later. But they went over and over the technique until Ishikawa was satis- fied that he had learned it. It's still something of a puzzle to many why Ishikawa continues to live in the United States, when back in Japan he's recognized as a great judo man and honored for it in a country where judo is a leading sport. But in the United States, he is little known except in judo circles. Repetitions Are the Key One reason appears to be that Ishikawa wants his three children to be educated in the West. Another is that he has dedicated his life to judo, and he believes that he can do a great deal in the United States. Certainly, he has proven so in Philadelphia. There are many who insist that the best trained judo men in America come out of Ishikawa's fifth floor dojo. He is a demanding instructor. Repetition is part of the fundamental method of learning judo, according to Ishi- kawa, and he drills it into his students that they have to practice, practice, and practice if they want to improve. Ishikawa officiates along with prominent judoists Nagano (center) and Murakami (right). Ishikawa shows how it's done in executing a lota garuma. And it's Ishikawa's contention that a man has to spend at least equal time off the mat as on, practicing forms and \"working softly\" — working on foot techniques, timing, uchi komi, etc. And his students are unmistakable among American judo players. They are beautifully coached and well grounded in the fundamentals of the sport. Ishikawa has taught many top young men in this country. Among those are heavyweight Richard Walters, considered the top- seeded judo man in the United States. But Ishikawa is his own best advertisement for his particular brand of judo. He has a colorful fighting style, with all the strength and power that his system calls for, yet he is graceful and effortless in performing his tech- niques. Like a topnotch professional, he makes it look easy. And other judo men say that when he's working with a student he's almost gentle and a person can't feel his strength, although he knows it's there. Boxer's Stance Several things are immediately apparent concerning his style. One thing is his speed; another is his remarkable sense of timing. His foot actions, for instance, are excep- tional. A good example is his execution of tsubami gaeshi (swallow foot counter sweep). This counter demands split 40 In another ceremonial function, Ishikawa and judo bigwigs (left to right) Dr. E. Koiwai (Shufu Pres.). Charles Lambur (Chairman of AAU judo section) and S. Nakabayashi (JBBF advisor) present Tenzo Uyeno Sportsmanship Trophy to Edwin Takemori. timing and speed. The sweep is begun just an instant before an opponent is to make contact with a foot sweep of his own. Ishikawa will pull back just before his opponent completes the sweep, and with a blinding circular movement^ catch the opponent's foot and dump him. Ishikawa is also strong on the mat. But one of his most outstanding attributes is his excellent balance. And this goes to the very heart of Ishikawa's fighting style, because it's from his great stance that he swings into his counters and techniques. Ishikawa's stance is more like that of a boxer than of many a judo player. He stands in something of a crouch. He's not standing straight, but he's not bent way over either. He's just slightly bent, with his arms and elbows in close to the side. \"Put your mind in your elbows,\" he will tell his students. He points his elbows and the line of his arms at the center of his opponent's belt, and then leans in toward the center. In this fashion, he says, you don't have the problem of the hands pushing or pulling too much. Riding the Rails This pointing of the arms becomes the student's line of, force. It has been described as riding a set of rails toward the opponent. In this way, Ishikawa says, you can feel the force of the opponent's body easily, and the way he's going to move or attempt to throw. As a result, from this stance, it's easy to go with the opponent's move and counter it quickly. Many people feel this is an unorthodox stance and that a person trying it is off his balance. But those who have studied under him deny this. They feel that this \"riding the center\" gives them greater balance and at the same time better freedom of movement in countering. And it is precisely the opportunity to counter that Ishi- kawa is looking for. With his great speed, he is considered one of the most dangerous counter fighters in the game. And it is the stance that gives him the edge in getting off quickly. He seems to explode out of it and into a counter the instant he feels his opponent begin to make his move. For ordinary tatami work, Ishikawa stresses funda- mentals. But for tournament play, his techniques are slanted with a power drive. Take, for instance, the case of a one-arm shoulder throw. The classical approach would be to pull your opponent's right arm with your left hand; then as you turn, you would look and grab his right arm and throw him straight over your back. His Life is Plain But Ishikawa would use a different approach. He would lock the opponent's right elbow tightly inward with his left arm. Then with his right shoulder and upper arm he would smash in against his opponent's shoulder in a 45-degree angle from the rear. Then, just hooking, and not grabbing, he would roll his opponent over his right hip in a tight driving action. The whole approach makes it very difficult for an op- ponent to pull out because he is locked in. And he has a big problem trying to stop such a move because he's being unbalanced, and yet Ishikawa hasn't turned into him, where he could be stopped. Instead of the over-the-back throw, Ishikawa would use a strong hip flirow like an ogoshi or tsurikomi ogoshi (left and pull hip throw). Of course, such power drives require good conditioning. Ishikawa watches his diet carefully and does not smoke or drink. He runs several miles each day to develop stamina. He is a bear on the subject of stamina and the need to develop it through repetitions. Usually, he does his exercises in ten sets with 50 repetitions for each set. Outside of the dojo, Ishikawa's life in Philadelphia is a plain one. He has dedicated himself to judo, and very little else seems to interest him. Besides his three children, the one thing he likes is Go, a kind of Oriental chess. Ishikawa is active in a Go club and holds a 5th degree in the sport. One big pleasure he derives is converting his chess-playing friends to Go fans. It seems a small enough sort of con- solation for a man who teaches what many consider to be the finest judo in America, ^ik^ 41 A Gift: From the Genie Looking for a different kind of hobby? For a way out one, try collecting ancient manuscripts on the martial arts. For the budoka who has everything, a collection of these is hard to beat. by William C. C. Hu >.*^^\\.y ot any old Oriental manuscripts on the martial U^^^J^Siv arts around the house that you're wondering ^T\\cjS>f about their authenticity? Or thinking of buying 2^ some. Checking their originality can be tricky. And risky if you're thinking about laying out good money to buy some. But many enthusiasts of the arts — in fact a surprising number — do own some sort of manuscript or treatise that they've picked up in their journeys. What with increasing ease of travel, many persons have greater opportunities to visit the Orient. Many in the Western countries travel to Asia to study various of the martial arts. And, of course, servicemen have a good chance of ending up on a tour of duty in the Far East. Many such people have found that it is fun to collect old works on the martial arts. It might even turn out prof- itably if you can unearth a valuable old manuscript in some small shop or bookstore in Asia. And even if you can't get there yourself, people coming back might offer to sell you some \"guaranteed original\" work that they picked up as a \"steal\" from some unsuspecting bookseller in Asia. A word of caution about such bargain basement \"steals.\" If you've ever met an Oriental shopkeeper, you'll know he's not the pushover you might imagine. The horsetrading art is an old one in Asia, and the area boasts some of the shrewdest businessmen anywhere in the world. When you're through haggling with one, you'll wonder just who is \"stealing\" from whom. And yet, there's always that tantalizing question. What if it really is a bargain? What if it really is an authentic old piece that you can start your collection with or add to an already existing one? These are exactly the types of ques- tions that keep the old book lover and those interested in the early history of the arts ransacking through bookshops and old collections throughout Asia, and as the works show up in increasing numbers, here in the West. Forgery An Old Tradition Perhaps a few general hints on what to look for will save you a lot of time and money if you're at all interested in this sort of thing. (Some of these pointers might help you if you're not particularly sold on the ancient history of the arts but just on old books in general.) But first a word of introduction on the subject. It must be recognized that forging works is an old, if not so honor- able, custom in the long history of Chinese letters. Some of these forgeries are so inventive it makes one wonder what their makers could have accomplished if they had tried to produce something original. Forgeries generally fall into two classes: ( 1 ) those made to try to turn a fast dollar, and (2) those put together by unscrupulous scholars to try to lend authenticity to their views. In the latter case, you sometimes have to respect the inventiveness of the forger. Not content with just attrib- uting the forgeries to ancient authorities, they sometimes claim the works came from the gods themselves. For in- stance, a genie might be claimed to have given a book to some poor person for a kind act rendered. In other cases, the forgers would content themselves with merely attribut- ing works to Confucius, or Lao-tzu, or Bodhidharma, long though to be the \"father of the martial arts.\" The \"works of the out and out forger can often be rather crude affairs to the trained eye. But the forgeries of the scholars can prove more difficult. More familiar with the areas they deal with, and perhaps more inventive, it some- times takes scholarly study of the contents of the forged document to be able to pin the label of hoax on these latter works with any degree of conviction. 42 Cc Forgery Spotting There are some dues that might be helpful in spotting the signs of the forger. Perhaps the best way to approach the subject for the beginner would be to take a specific example. Recently, I was asked to examine a stack of old books and manuscripts accumulated over many years by a col- lector who had lived in the Far East. He was purported to have a fine collection of old books and manuscripts about Asia, the subjects covered being as varied as his interests. Although I was mildly curious, I started out halfheartedly. I have found that many broad collections of this nature hold little of value. However, since I was asked by a close ac- quaintance to do him a personal favor, I agreed to look over the materials. When I had arrived at the collector's home, I was greeted with much courtesy and spent an hour in pleasant conver- sation before being shown the collection. The material was well preserved, but most of it was run-of-the-mill stuff. I tried not to show my disappointment, but my host had sensed my restlessness. He interrupted my digging in the piles of old printed matter and informed me that he had some old written manuscripts in another room, which he proceeded to bring out for my inspection. Tai Chi Chuan Work I found that most of the manuscripts were fragments oi larger works whidi were parts of some studtent's copying exercises. None of the manuscripts was copied by any great calligrapher or written in any noted style. However, I dis- covered one which appeared to be very old and worn. It was worm-eaten and had been repaired with great care md bore the title, T'ai-chi ch'uan shih yao. This particular title is a fairly common one on Tai-chi ch'iian. However, this copy was different from others I have seen. The authorship was attributed to Chang San-feng (the purported inventor of T'ai-chi ch'uan) instead of to Yang Ch'eng-p'u, the usual author. Examining the text, I discovered that the contents were considerably different from the usual version. The pages were filled with worm holes and stain. How- ever, the manuscript had been expertly repaired with a backing sheet which was pasted onto the original leaves. The original leaves measured 13.S by 26 centimeters. The entire manuscript consisted of five double-folded leaves with the title occupying one entire double leaf. Three other double leaves had text on boA sides; the fourth leaf had text on one side and the other side was left blank, acting as the back cover. Cheap Paper ITsed Each page consisted of six columns, with each column having fourteen Chinese characters or words on them. Aside from the title and subtitle, which combined together, contained seventeini characters, the entire text consisted of 572 characters or words. The hand writing of this manu- script was in the formal style of the 'K'ai-shu', a style of writing smilar to the bold Roman face characters ci the Western print. The first task was to date the manuscript, and the second was to discover whether it was genuine or a fake. The final effort was to determine the value of this find to scholars and enthusiasts of the Oriental martial arts, and what monetary value was to be placed on such an item. On one of the leaves, I discovered that there was no paste or adhesive to gjue it firmly to the backing sheet. I immediately examined the type of paper used. The paper was of the type called 'Huang-chih' , or brown paper — rather common type manufactured in China during the late nineteenth century. Hence, the work was less than a century old if my assumption was correct. This particular type of 'Huang-chih' primarily was used for writmg <A accounts or busmess ledgers. Commonly, tiiis type of paper is called 'Chang-pu chih', or ledger paper. Cop^i^iled material I The measurements that I had taken confirmed my sus- picion. The matrix of the lines of grilles was made from presses which were placed as weights over the pulp to make a sheet of paper that matched the samples I keep of various types of paper manufactured during the time. The paper had some wood and plant pulp in it, w^ich gave a brown color to the paper, although there were some fabric or rag content in the composition. Worm Holes Don'l Match Next I examined the ink. The ink was too black to be very old. I examined each area very carefully and found that the ink did not wear down with the paper. In other words, where the paper was rubbed, the ink did not match. Next, I took each page to a li^t and found that the worm holes did not match. This proved that this manuscript was not originally bound as a book. As 1 examined the worm holes further, I found that they could not be matched in any manner. I speculated someone had taken various sheets of old and woim-eaten paper and wrote a text on it to try to sell to antique, collectors. To verify my claim, I studied the posi- tioning on the paper of each written character. Although the number of columns and number of char- acters in each column were closely regulated, nevertheless the size of the characters and the positioning of each char- acter on the paper were not. The size varied considerably, some quite lar^ and othe"
