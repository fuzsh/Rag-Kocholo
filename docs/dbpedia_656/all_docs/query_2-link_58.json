Drug and drug category involvement are identified by specific multiple cause-of-death codes (heroin: T40.1, prescription opioids: T40.2 and T40.3, synthetic opioids excluding methadone (primarily fentanyl): T40.4, cocaine: T40.5, and psychostimulants with abuse potential (primarily methamphetamine): T43.6.
