Based on recent mortality data, suicide in some populations is on the rise.\n\nDefinitions\n\nSuicide is defined as death caused by self-directed injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior.\n\nA suicide attempt is a non-fatal, self-directed, potentially injurious behavior with intent to die as a result of the behavior. A suicide attempt might not result in injury.\n\nSuicidal ideation refers to thinking about, considering, or planning suicide.\n\nAdditional information about suicide can be found on the NIMH health topics page on Suicide Prevention.\n\nSuicide is a Leading Cause of Death in the United States\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) WISQARS Leading Causes of Death Reports , in 2021:\n\nSuicide was the eleventh leading cause of death overall in the United States, claiming the lives of over 48,100 people.\n\nSuicide was the second leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 10-14 and 25-34 , the third leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 15-24, and the fifth leading cause of death among individuals between the ages of 35 and 44.\n\nThere were nearly two times as many suicides (48,183) in the United States as there were homicides (26,031).\n\nTable 1 shows the twelve leading causes of death in the United States, and the number of deaths attributed to each cause. Data are shown for all ages and select age groups where suicide was one of the leading twelve causes of death in 2021. The data are based on death certificate information compiled by the CDC.\n\nTable 1\n\nDownload PNG image\n\nDownload PDF document\n\nLeading Cause of Death in the United States for Select Age Groups (2021)\n\nData Courtesy of CDCRank5-910-1415-2425-3435-4445-5455-64All Ages1Unintentional\n\nInjury\n\n827Unintentional\n\nInjury\n\n915Unintentional\n\nInjury\n\n15,792Unintentional\n\nInjury\n\n34,452Unintentional\n\nInjury\n\n36,444COVID-19\n\n36,881Malignant\n\nNeoplasms\n\n108,023Heart\n\nDisease\n\n695,547 2Malignant\n\nNeoplasms\n\n347Suicide\n\n598Homicide\n\n6,635Suicide\n\n8,862COVID-19\n\n16,006Heart\n\nDisease\n\n34,535Heart\n\nDisease\n\n89,342Malignant\n\nNeoplasms\n\n605,2133Homicide\n\n188Malignant\n\nNeoplasms\n\n449Suicide\n\n6,528Homicide\n\n7,571Heart Disease\n\n12,754Malignant Neoplasms\n\n33,567COVID-19\n\n73,725COVID-19\n\n416,8934Congenital Anomalies\n\n171Homicide\n\n298COVID-19\n\n1,401COVID-19\n\n6,133Malignant Neoplasms\n\n11,194Unintentional Injury\n\n31,407Unintentional\n\nInjury\n\n33,471Unintentional\n\nInjury\n\n224,9355Heart Disease\n\n66Congenital\n\nAnomalies\n\n179Malignant\n\nNeoplasms\n\n1,323Heart\n\nDisease\n\n4,155Suicide\n\n7,862Liver Disease\n\n10,501Diabetes\n\nMellitus\n\n18,603Cerebro-\n\nvascular\n\n162,8906COVID-19\n\n63Heart\n\nDisease\n\n132Heart\n\nDisease\n\n944Malignant\n\nNeoplasms\n\n3,615Liver\n\nDisease\n\n5,833Diabetes\n\nMellitus\n\n7,597Liver\n\nDisease\n\n17,664CLRD\n\n142,3427CLRD\n\n54COVID-19\n\n79Congenital\n\nAnomalies\n\n419Liver\n\nDisease\n\n1,833Homicide\n\n4,863Suicide\n\n7,401\n\nCLRD\n\n17,620Alzheimer's\n\nDisease\n\n119,3998Cerebro-vascular\n\n35Cerebro-vascular\n\n53Diabetes\n\nMellitus\n\n345Diabetes\n\nMellitus\n\n1,285Diabetes\n\nMellitus\n\n2,961Cerebro-\n\nvascular\n\n5,755Cerebro-\n\nvascular\n\n14,634Diabetes\n\nMellitus\n\n103,2949Septicemia\n\n28CLRD\n\n45Complicated\n\nPregnancy\n\n214Complicated\n\nPregnancy\n\n797Cerebro-\n\nvascular\n\n2,189CLRD\n\n3,174Suicide\n\n7,267Liver\n\nDisease\n\n56,58510Influenza & Pneumonia\n\n27Diabetes\n\nMellitus\n\n39Cerebro-\n\nvascular\n\n190Cerebro-\n\nvascular\n\n624Septicemia\n\n1,108Homicide\n\n2,768Septicemia\n\n6,477Nephritis\n\n54,35811Benign\n\nNeoplasms\n\n24Benign\n\nNeoplasms\n\n30CLRD\n\n158HIV\n\n510Nephritis\n\n972Nephritis\n\n2,516Nephritis\n\n6,374Suicide\n\n48,18312Perinatal\n\nPeriod\n\n21Influenza & Pneumonia\n\n22Influenza & Pneumonia\n\n128Congenital\n\nAnomalies\n\n459Influenza & Pneumonia\n\n842Septicemia\n\n2,426Hypertension\n\n5,187Hypertension\n\n42,816\n\nCLRD: Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease\n\nCOVID-19: Coronavirus disease 2019 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2\n\nNote: Suicide is not among the twelve leading causes of death among children in the 0-4 year age group nor in adults in the age group 65 years and older (data not shown).\n\nSuicide Rates\n\nTrends over Time\n\nSuicide rates are based on the number of people who have died by suicide per 100,000 population. The use of ‘age-adjusted’ rates allows for comparison of differences in population age distributions and changes in population size over time, including from one year to another year.\n\nFigure 1 shows age-adjusted suicide rates in the United States for each year from 2000 through 2021 for the total population, and for males and females separately.\n\nThe total age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States increased 35.2% from 10.4 per 100,000 in 2000 to 14.2 per 100,000 in 2018, before declining to 13.9 per 100,000 in 2019 and declining again to 13.5 per 100,000 in 2020. The total age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States in 2021 increased to 14.0 per 100,000.\n\nIn 2021 , the suicide rate among males was 4 times higher (22.8 per 100,000) than among females (5.7 per 100,000).\n\nFigure 1\n\nSuicide Rates in the United States (2000-2020)YearTotal PopulationFemaleMale200010.44.017.7200110.74.118.2200211.04.218.5200310.84.218.1200411.04.518.1200510.94.418.1200611.04.518.1200711.34.718.5200811.64.819.0200911.84.919.2201012.15.019.8201112.35.220.0201212.55.420.3201312.65.520.2201413.05.820.7201513.36.021.0201613.46.021.3201714.06.122.4201814.26.222.8201913.96.022.4202013.55.521.9202114.05.722.8\n\nDemographics\n\nCrude suicide rate calculations take population size within subgroups in any given year or timeframe into account. They can be a useful tool for understanding the relative proportion of people affected within different demographic groups.\n\nFigure 2 shows the crude rates of suicide within sex and age categories in 2021.\n\nAmong females, the suicide rate was highest for those aged 45-64 (8.2 per 100,000).\n\nAmong males, the suicide rate was highest for those aged 75 and older (42.2 per 100,000).\n\nFigure 2\n\nSuicide Rates by Age (2020)Age GroupFemaleMale10–142.33.315–246.123.825–447.430.045–648.227.165–745.626.175+4.442.2\n\nFigure 3 shows the age-adjusted rates of suicide for race and ethnicity groups in 2021 based on data from the CDC’s WISQARS Fatal Injury Data Visualization Tool .\n\nThe rates of suicide were highest for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Non-Hispanic males (43.4 per 100,000) and, followed by White, Non-Hispanic males (30.0 per 100,000). Among females the rates of suicide were highest for American Indian/Alaskan Native, Non-Hispanic females (13.5 per 100,000) and White, Non-Hispanic females (7.5 per 100,000).\n\nFigure 3\n\nSuicide Rates by Race and Ethnicity (2021)Race and EthnicityFemaleMaleAI/AN13.543.4Asian/PI4.110.5Black3.314.8White7.530,0Hispanic*3.012.5\n\n*Persons of Hispanic origin may be of any race; all other racial/ethnic groups are non-Hispanic\n\nAI/AN = American Indian/Alaskan Native, PI = Pacific Islander\n\nSuicide Rates by State\n\nJust as state population numbers and age distributions vary, suicide rates can vary widely from state to state.

Gender identity information was not collected in the survey.\n\nInterview Response and Completion:\n\nIn 2022, 52.0% of the selected NSDUH sample of people 18 or older did not complete the interview. This rate of non-response is higher than in years before 2020. Please see the Background on the 2022 NSDUH and the COVID-19 Pandemic section below for more information.\n\nReasons for non-response to interviewing include the following: refusal to participate (29.3%); respondent unavailable, never at home, or did not respond to the web survey (18.2%); and other reasons such as partially completed but unusable interviews, physical/mental incompetence or language barriers (4.5%).\n\nPeople with suicidal behavior may disproportionately fall into these non-response categories. While NSDUH weighting includes non-response adjustments to reduce bias, these adjustments may not fully account for differential non-response by suicide behavior status. Prior to the 2020 NSDUH, this bias was deemed small and inconsequential due to low rates of item nonresponse and low prevalence estimates for outcomes imputed using the zero-fill method. With the increase in break-offs among adults in 2020 who completed the questionnaire via the web, the potential bias of this approach for handling missing data became of greater concern. Therefore, missing values in the variables associated with multiple outcomes, including for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, were statistically imputed beginning in 2021.\n\nData Suppression:\n\nFor some groups, data are not reported due to low precision. Data may be suppressed in the above charts if the data do not meet acceptable ranges for prevalence estimates, standard error estimates, and sample size.\n\nBackground on the 2022 NSDUH and the COVID-19 Pandemic:\n\nData collection methods for the 2022 NSDUH changed in several ways because of the COVID-19 pandemic: the 2022 NSDUH continued the use of multimode data collection procedures (both in-person and virtual data collection) that were first implemented in the fourth quarter of the 2020 NSDUH. Overall, 40.7% of interviews were completed via the web, and 59.3% were completed in person. For comparison, more than half of interviews in 2021 (54.6%) were completed via the web. In 2022, the weighted response rates for household screening and for interviewing were 25.5% and 47.4%, respectively, for an overall response rate of 12.1% for people aged 12 or older. Given the use of multimode data collection procedures through the entirety of the collection year and the rate of non-response, comparison of estimates from the 2022 NSDUH with those from prior years must be made with caution.\n\nPlease see the 2022 National Survey on Drug Use and Health Methodological Summary and Definitions report for further information on how these data were collected and calculated.\n\nLast Updated: February 2024\n\nIf You are in Crisis\n\nIf you are in crisis, call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988, available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
