        "text": "These three bibliographies represent the research synthesis which underlies all of my monographs, audio files, video files, and lectures. They are arranged according to Author, Date, and Subject in three separate PDF documents. Each document is fully searchable. There are 4,089 entries in the database. What is a Research Synthesis? A standard research synthesis follows a simple algorithm: 1) collect the relevant research studies; 2) filter these studies according to specified rejection criteria (e.g., no studies that are not placebo-controlled and double-blinded); 3) collate the data; 4) write the research synthesis. (Cooper 1984 and Cooper and Hedges 1994). A 'syncretic' research synthesis, however, modifies the second step by having no pre-determined filters and allowing all research to be included in the final paper. This follows the 17th century alchemists' advice on how to discover the truth and avoid deception: \"Therefore all those who desire to attain the blessing of this art (Alchemy) should apply themselves to study, should gather the truth from the books and not from invented fables and untruthful works. There is no way by which this art can truly be found (although men meet with many deceptions), except by completing their studies and understanding the words of the philosophers...\" (Theatrum Chemicum, p. 444, quoted in Jung 1968, p. 258). \"He should collect the books of different authors, because otherwise it is impossible to understand them and he should not throw aside a book which he has read once, twice, or even three times, although he has not understood it, but should read it again ten, twenty, fifty times or even more. At last he will see wherein the authors are mainly agreed: there the truth lies hidden...\" (Theatrum Chemicum, p. 213, quoted in Jung 1968 p. 258). Bibliography: 1. Cooper, Harris M. (1984).
