He has also practiced with many of Morihei Ueshiba Osensei’s first generation teachers, including Francis Takahashi, Morihiro Saito, Akira Tohei, Kazuo Chiba, Hiroshi Ikeda, Terry Dobson, Mitsugi Saotome, and Mitsunari Kanai Sensei. An ordained Rinzai lineage Zen Master/Priest and lineage dharma teacher, Roshi Fudo Myoo Teja Bell is the 84th ancestor of this Zen tradition.\n\nLaurin Herr, 6th dan, began his Aikido training in 1971 as a student at Cornell University. Inspired by his first experience on the mat, he studied Japanese intensively, moved to Tokyo and entered Aikido Hombu Dojo as an unranked white belt, earning his shodan there in 1976. He subsequently spent formative years affiliated with the Kumano Juku Dojo in Japan, training under Michio Hikitsuchi, Motomichi Anno, Motokazu Yanase and Yasushi Tojima. Returning from Japan, he continued his practice with Terry Dobson at the Bond Street Dojo. He met Robert Nadeau in 1998 and has been training with him ever since. Herr is a senior instructor at Aikido of Mountain View.\n\nRichard Moon, 6th dan, began his study of martial arts in 1969, training in Shotokan Karate, Kenpo, and Kung Fu under various teachers. In 1971, he began his practice of Aikido under Robert Nadeau, a relationship continuing to this day. Also a yoga instructor for more than 40 years and a personal student of Bira Almedia, Mestre Accordion of Brazilian Capoeira, Moon is the founder and chief instructor at Aikido of Marin. He was also a co-founder and senior instructor at City Aikido of San Francisco for many years.\n\nBob Noha, 6th dan, began practicing Aikido in 1966 in Mountain View, California, and shortly thereafter began training with Robert Nadeau, the start of a life-long friendship. He started the first Aikido school in the Washington, D.C., area in 1970 and, in 1975, founded the first Aikido school in Buffalo, New York. He founded Aikido of Petaluma in 1983 and continues to serve as its chief instructor. In addition, Noha is also a devoted student and teacher of T’ai Chi and has a background in several other martial arts.\n\nSusan Spence, 3rd dan, has studied with Robert Nadeau since 1984 and has been an instructor at his schools in Mountain View and San Francisco. She currently works as a physical therapist and biofeedback specialist treating children and adults."
