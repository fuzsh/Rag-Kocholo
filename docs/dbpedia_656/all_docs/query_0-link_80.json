Dr. Zoughari’s visionary work connects old ways with the new, breathing life and new meaning into an often controversial subject in a way that benefits all who will read these pages. In all honesty, I was unsure what to offer in prelude that affords justice to the significance of this work. This book will prove to be a beacon, allowing us to pass into a new territory of times long past. It will lead the reader into a deeper understanding and serve as a bridge to a new perspective on the ancient art of ninjutsu. Perhaps it’s simplest to say that ninjutsu is a timeless and elusive art that is infinitely valuable to all who come to know its form.\n\nChristopher Davy December 2009\n\nShihan Christopher Davy holds a tenth degree black belt under Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi Soke of Noda City, Japan. He has traveled to Japan many times to train and research the Bujinkan arts. He has been training in martial arts for over thirty-three years and is Shidoshi at the Bujinkan Yume Dojo in Lost River, West Virginia.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 6\n\n12/22/09 6:42:47 PM\n\nIntroduction For as long as I can remember, the image of the ninja from movies and books fascinated me by the way they could disappear, use improvised weapons, and execute incredible techniques. I didn’t understand that this image was rooted in a very profound and logical way of using the body for the art of survival. After many years of research and encounters with many masters, I realized that ninjutsu goes beyond the form and the fixed methods of sport or other classical martial arts. Ninjutsu is something that is alive and ever changing. This is why ninjutsu is different; it’s always evolving and adapting to the environment. The knowledge and wisdom of using the body is complex and subtle at the same time. It is complex because each technique that makes up the art is born from the blood of many warriors. It’s subtle and very deep because the defense of life is based on time, wisdom, and knowledge. The art of the using the body in ninjutsu must be unpredictable and is, thus, difficult to see and to grasp. The only thing I can say is that to master this way of using the body asks us not to be ambitious but to be patient. In other words, to understand the value of what it really means to be patient is to understand the value of the moment. To control ego and master the subtleties of body mechanics without extensive forethought or great physical strength demands time and a singular state of mind. The heart of this, again, is patience. I didn’t initially set out to write a book on ninjutsu, even though I had already written many articles on ninjutsu, bujutsu, and koryū in general. However, thanks to the “miracle of various meetings” with English-speaking partners requesting training, I decided to develop an English book on ninjutu. Through my international travel to conferences and seminars, I became aware that the majority of ninjutsu practitioners, other marital arts practitioners, and members of academia were confused about the true nature of the art. They only knew bits and pieces of information—generally, what they’d gleaned from the Internet. This book is a new level of research into the art of ninjutsu. This new approach is not lightly undertaken. It was not quickly translated or compiled from various current works on the subject. It is not about delving into a study of various esoteric works based entirely in the classical Japanese language, called kanbun. Rather, this book is the fruit of more than 10 years of study, practice and research on different bujutsu, koryū and, more particularly, ninjutsu. This approach was developed during my studies at the National Institute of the Eastern Languages and Civilizations in Paris (INALCO). Thus, because of my academic experience and training, particularly in Japanese studies, I undertook a serious and precise research study, far from any “parochialism.” If my studies and choice of material drew me closer to Master Hatsumi Masaaki, it is because his knowledge of the subject matter is so highly regarded, and also because I initially avoided following the pack of so-called experts in the field. Master Hatsumi Masaaki remains one of the only masters to have had an authentic contact with the one of the last true ninja, Takamatsu Toshitsuga. This unique relationship was one-to-one, a master with a disciple, which continues still today through Sōke Hatsumi. Thus, this isn’t an attempt to extol the glory of Master Hatsumi, or of the Bujinkan, but rather it is a study of ninjutsu seen through the eyes of a practitioner, and the practitioner is Master Takamatsu Toshitsuga. I don’t seek to enter into a critical debate with the other organizations created by alumni of Master Hatsumi Masaaki nor with the keen defenders of koryū and other budō. Although I can prove the\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 7\n\n12/18/09 8:50:42 AM\n\nFree ebooks ==> www.Ebook777.com 8\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nconclusions of my research to anyone who wants to see it, the goal remains to provide an alternative, honest, and serious reading of historical ninjutsu and its practice. I have divided this book in several parts. Each chapter deals with a different aspect of ninjustsu, including relevant studies of the history, philosophy, and wisdom. In each of these aspects, I have presented different authors, historians, chronicles, and scrolls in order to impart a wider and deeper understanding. I didn’t focus on translating the quoted passages word for word, but rather I tried to impart a clear sense of the writer’s main concept, which (as you’ll see) was always based upon how to survive, how to hide, how to move subtly, how to be more effective, and so forth. I worked to preserve the original essence of all the translations. In order to do this, I had to include the historical explanation of classical Kobujutsu schools for completeness. I’ve also included appendices that deal with other aspects of ninjutsu (ninja names, chronologies, and the like) in order to give adequate background information for those of you who wish to take your research of ninjutsu beyond this book. I took care to add the kanji for each term, title, scroll, and so forth, in order to be as precise as possible. I hope this book will enlighten you and build your interest in the various aspects of ninjutsu and how it relates to the history of Japan. If this work can help you to practice and study more deeply (no matter the art) and allow you to view the world with a broader perspective and one without preconception, then I have achieved my goal in writing this book. The love of training requires a particular gift: the gift of one’s devotion. This dedication is based on single-minded focus. All the major martial art practices have in common requiring ongoing dedication. This gift allows one to transcend and to overcome the prejudices and other insignificant aspects of our ego, detriments that keep our eyes closed at a time when they should be open. But the wise know that the eyes alone are not sufficient.\n\nKacem Zoughari December 2009\n\nwww.Ebook777.com The Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 8\n\n12/18/09 8:50:42 AM\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nWhat Is Ninjutsu? When one inquires about ninjutsu or the ninja to a Japanese martial arts instructor, student, or enthusiast, their response is often surprising. Many who claim to have knowledge of Japanese techniques of combat describe a ninja as a kind of scientist who blends most of the known budō (jūdō, karate-dō, aikidō, kendō, jō-dō, and so forth) with wilderness survival skills and other ascetic disciplines. For the Japanese, ninja are warriors, or rather “ghosts” capable of superhuman prowess, devoting themselves to occult and esoteric practices. It is tempting to believe that these fantastic tales are true, but that simply isn’t the case. Actually, ninjutsu does not enter into any of the known sporting and martial art categories, because its evolution has always remained in the shadows of greatest secrecy, at the fringes of a constantly evolving society. Because it is difficult to fully comprehend ninjutsu without having a firm knowledge of the historical foundations of combat techniques, I’ll define the combat practices of Japan first. With a brief defintion of these combat practices, one can better understand ninjas’ operating mode, the reason for their existence, and their use, which arose from the continual upheaval throughout Japanese history. These practices later gave rise to the sports-based martial arts in the twentieth century. One must avoid making a false connection between contemporary sport martial arts and ninjutsu. For one thing, ninjutsu has historically never been respected as a legitimate practice, and this left room for a great deal of confusion to grow within the minds of many martial artists and martial arts researchers. In Japan, when one refers to the techniques of combat, commonly called martial arts, the terms bujutsu, bugei, and budō are generally used. These terms convey the history of the Japanese warrior class.\n\nBujutsu, Bugei, and Budō\n\nThe Tsuki no shō, densho written in 1642 by Yagyū Jūbei.

Private collection.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 9\n\nAccording to the book entitled Suikoden (水滸伝: At the Edge of Water), composed at the beginning of the Ming dynasty (the second half of the fifteenth century) in China, the term bugei (arts “gei” 芸 of war “bu” 武) meant the use of weapons, such as the bow, sword, spear, halberd, axe, and so forth; and bujutsu (techniques “jutsu” 術; of war “bu” 武) meant “all of the techniques necessary to fight.” This includes physical skills such as swimming and horsemanship. After the rise of the samurai class to power in Japan during the Kamakura period (1192–1333), martial arts and martial styles started to be classified. Indeed, the practice of martial arts as a true combat practice included a whole range of martial art subject areas called bugei jūhappan (武芸十八 般: eighteen warrior disciplines).1 This vast martial arts repertoire included the use of the sword, hand-to-hand combat, horsemanship, lance wielding, and so on. Categorizing these skills is the foundation of bujutsu, which made it possible for the samurai families to be able to protect themselves from\n\n12/18/09 8:50:42 AM\n\n10\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\none another. Each samurai family developed these formal alternatives and technical innovations and, starting from these experiments on the battlefield, the schools of combat (ryū-h) were born.2 Practical bujutsu was a solitary art, and the transmission of the wisdom and knowledge that made up the ryū-ha was restricted to only the elite members of the warrior class. The schools were few in number and did not have formal classes, a dōjō, or any public venue. The main reason that the particular techniques of any given style were not normally spread nor shared with the general public, but rather given Inside the Tsuki no shō section concerning the art of using the only to the elite classes, was to preserve one’s adbody and mind, written by Yagyū Jūbei. Private collection. vantage during conflict with another warrior. The special knowledge behind any particular school, or ryū, remained exclusively in the hands of the current master or founder of the style. We see that the spreading of particular styles of bujutsu ryū-ha throughout the country began when masters started traveling across Japan to test themselves against others. It was a form of evaluation and verification wherein the practitioner applied his knowledge against others to see the validity of the style and to prove his understanding through physical expression. Bujutsu has always required a deep and sincere devotion to one’s practice. During this period, passing down the knowledge of survival was a very serious responsibility because it opened up the possibility that the master would be betrayed and killed by his student. Choosing the correct, sincere disciple in order to pass on the major principles of the school (ogi 奥義, gokui 極意) was the main intent of the practice of the art. Ogi represents the core principles and top-level techniques as well as the secret and subtle way of using the body and weapons. Gokui represents the philosophical essence of the school. Bujutsu includes the use and mastery of various weapons and techniques. These techniques were developed in response to the volatile nature in the historical period in Japan, where there was constant war and personal combat. Indeed, bujutsu comprises various martial techniques that address confrontations with or without armor, known as gekitō (撃刀), kumitachi (組太刀), tachi uchi (太刀打ち), or yoroi kumiuchi (鎧組討ち). Gekitō, kumitachi, and tachi uchi are the arts of using various types of Japanese swords at both close and long ranges. In these three arts, one can have armor, light armor, or even no armor, but the practice is not exclusive to sword usage and can be used to mean the application of all weapons. Yoroi Kumi uchi is combat with armor that includes combat with and without weapons.

It was necessary that the disciple develop a particular acuity in order to mimic the master’s technique, watching the movement, action, and techniques until the learner could imitate what was observed to perfection. It was a widespread practice in Japan, where bujutsu disciples attempted to reproduce the techniques of combat, which came from the experimentation of their particular master. These techniques were relatively simple yet powerful because most combat was done while wearing armor. The bujutsu masters of the time, all members of the warrior class, undertook personal research on the most effective techniques, based on experience gained through combat. The passing of the knowledge and wisdom of the bujutsu school culminated with the transfer of three documents to the disciple. They were kiri-gami (切紙: a letter attesting to the student’s achievement of mastery over the first practical level of bujutsu instruction), inka3 (印可: a certificate of complete license for the school), mokuroku (目録: an index containing the names Picture taken in Yokohama at the beginning of the Meiji period, showing a warrior sitting in and the description of the techniques of the school) or ehis garden. Private collection. mokuroku (technical sketches 絵目録). The contents of these documents, written by the master, presented the philosophy of the school since its creation and the directives to be followed, as well as the technical lexicon. Bujutsu was a logical evolution of the primitive practice to which the warriors prior to the Kamakura period devoted themselves. The techniques of combat used before, during, and after the Héian (782–1190) period were the direct expression of a destructive impulse—the art of war.\n\nFamous picture taken in the Meiji era showing two partisans of the Bōshin’s war or Bōshin sensō (1868).

This research provided the focus that allowed practitioners to find the ultimate technical level of their art. Most of the schools were created after a dream or vision wherein the founder received technical and spiritual initiation. It can be concluded that bujutsu is a collection of the all-encompassing techniques of combat, which included a great number of gruesome skills focused primarily on the art of war, and where spirituality holds a unique place. The amount of spirituality varied according to the degree of skill and belief of the practitioner. As one delved deeper into the study of martial arts, there was an increasing need to understand the intentions of potential adversaries, who could only be assumed to be studying with the same zeal. It is not surprising that living on this “razor’s edge” with death opened one up to the importance of the spiritual realm. That this was prevalent in many bujutsu schools cannot be discounted.

The term is a relatively recent one, having been first used at the beginning of the Meiji period (1868–1912) in a climate dominated by the need to defend the threatened Japanese state. Budō, in the Meiji period, draws from concepts of the warrior practice of bujutsu from the Edo period (1603–1863). Indeed, during the Edo period, the shōgun of the Tokugawa family established and stabilized control over all of Japan. They imposed a strong central government on the country, ensuring a long period of peace lasting until the reopening of the country to foreign powers in the nineteenth century. During this long period of peace, warriors gradually had to acKondo isami nosuke, famous master of custom themselves to the times and seek other avenues to hone the Tenren rishin-ryū school and captain and perfect their combat techniques.

Indeed, the practice, which until that time was transmitted only to an elite class, gave way to the teaching of the masses. This opening of martial arts instruction to all social classes was done through the establishment of formal schools, public demonstrations, and the formation of groups of followers and disciples. One parallel to note is that with the proliferation of new schools, the drafting of transmission documents (scrolls and densho, which were the official documents of the school itself ), became increasingly sophisticated, and research shows that this helped move schools towards specialization. It is through the practice of dō, the way, that the concept of “dō” came, little by little, to be associated with a deep sense of duty towards each warrior’s lord. The warrior, who accepted this concept of “dō,” then had to seek a way to advance in bujutsu without really killing the opponent, contrary with the ideology of bujutsu, which consists of methods of killing. The martial techniques became increasingly sophisticated and coexisted with spirituality. These budō arts gradually became less and less deadly, eventually reaching a point where some were not deadly at all. Increasingly subtle, budō techniques were developed to take advantage of the freedom of movement that the dress of the period offered; Portrait of Ittō Ittōsai, the founder of Ittō-ryū.

Thus, little by little, certain disciplines of bujutsu (kenjutsu, bōjutsu, jōjutsu, and the like) reached a high degree of refinement, but without the danger of mortal consequences. The practice of these disciplines through the concept of budō aims to train the follower physically and psychologically, two inseparable aspects of the practice. It was during this period, in the middle of the eighteenth century, that certain schools of kenjutsu began to use the shinai (swords made with plates of bamboo) as well as protective armor. The shinai was actually created a few centuries before and was called a fukuro shinai5 by Kami Izumi Nobutsuna (1508–1577), the founder of Shinkage-ryū (新影流).6 The use of both the shinai and armor spread through the end of the eighteenth century. At present, modern kendō (剣道) owes almost all of its evolution to a genius named Chiba Shūsaku (1794–1855), master of the sword and founder of the current Hokushin Ittō-ryū (北辰一刀流), which descended from the famous school, Ittō-ryū (一刀流).7\n\nThe Kashima shinkage-ryū mokuroku, scroll written in 1865.

After the Second World War, thanks to the assistance of modern-day masters like Nakayama Hakudōi (1872–1959) and Takano Saburō (1870–1960), a reform effort returned most of kendō to these roots. The practice of modern kendō, even at the most senior levels, has lost much authenticity that one finds in the practice of traditional kenjutsu. Indeed, in the art of the kenjutsu, traditionally all the weapons\n\nScroll of Hokushin Ittō-ryū founded by Chiba Chūsaku.

With the introduction of armor came a lack of flexibility, and so the principle inherent to the practice of the sword as relating to body movement was discarded. The positions (kamae) of the traditional sword were shortened, which implies that the mobility of the body as a whole was restricted. This severely reduced overall body movement and seriously impacted natural timing. The lack of flexibility of kendō is indicated in their practice. One can add that, contrary to traditional kenjutsu, kendō remains very limited. And, it is in this limitation of movement that leads some kendō-ka to search for a form of freedom, a “formlessness of pure movement.” This principle continues to be found in the budō that emerged during the Meiji period (1868–1912). Jūdō and Karatedō are striking examples of the search for “formlessness of pure movement” through disciplines limited to the field of the war, espionage, guerrilla warfare, real combat, and the like.\n\n15\n\nPhotograph taken at the beginning of Meiji showing the last member of the Hattori family.

The arrival of the Americans with Admiral Perry upset many of the warrior practices, much as had happened a few centuries before with the introduction of firearms by the Portuguese in 1540. The transitioning cultural environment became a place where all the knowledge and warrior traditions from Japanese history were abandoned in order to take advantage of new and innovative Western industrial techniques. It was in this period that Kanō Jigorō (1860–1930) worked out a new model of training, drawing from the concept of dō which was derived from the warrior traditions of ancient Japan. This new training approach judiciously combined the knowledge of Western thought and the model of action of the bushi (warrior). It was the birth of Jūdō (柔道: the way of flexibility). After having studied the jūjutsu (柔術)8 of two traditional schools, Tenshin shinyō-ryū (天神真楊流)9 and Kitō-ryū (起倒流),10 and comparing it with various Western methods of physical conditioning, Kanō concluded that jūjutsu was the most effective and balanced. Concentrating mainly on the educational and gymnastic aspects within jūjutsu, Kanō skillfully eliminated the parts that he considered dangerous. He founded his private school, Kōdōkan11 (講道館: residence where the way is taught) in 1882 and developed jūdō, a discipline based on the physical practice and morality of a modern world. Jūdō quickly became a great success. However, Kanō always publicly tried to promote Kōdōkan Jūdō as a physical method formed by the “modernization” of jūjutsu, so that no one would mistake jūdō for a technique of combat or a form of warrior arts, as in bujutsu. After his death, and the rise of Japanese militarism, jūdō was incorporated, little by little, into formal military training and gradually came to be falsely identified as true bujutsu. In addition to the adoption of jūdō by the military, the publication of the novel Sugata Sanshirō by Tomita Tsuneo in 1942, very popular at the time in Japan, surely contributed to the confusion which many today regard jūdō as a true combat art.12 Modern jūdō is very different from Kanō’s original jūdō. Today it is based mainly on the use of physical\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 15\n\n12/18/09 8:50:45 AM\n\n16\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nA version of the Gorin no sho written in 1655 by Terao Umanosuke, disciple and successor of Miyamoto Musashi. Private collection.\n\nforce driven only towards sport competition. The true essence and freedom of movement is completely forgotten. Indeed, one of the concepts dear to Kanō, “the soft one exceeds the hard”13 seems lost to many modern jūdō-ka. The study of martial practices, including blows, strikes, the use of weapons, and dangerous techniques are not approached anymore or even studied in the practice of “modern jūdō,” whereas they were practiced in the Kōdōkan jūdō of Kanō. One only needs to note that Kanō himself continued to research traditional bujutsu. Master Kyozō Mifune, who in addition to being a virtuoso of jūdō, was a noted and assiduous practitioner of jūjutsu. Of course, there are always some practitioners who are very attached to the concepts of Kanō and who claim to have and teach “true jūdō.” But how could these claims be true in the absence of a master who received instruction directly from Kanō?\n\nKarate In the 1920s, karate was imported from Okinawa to Japan by Funakoshi Gishin (1868–1957), under the name of Okinawa Tōte (沖縄唐手: Chinese technique of Okinawa).14 This “new” technique of combat did not have any common point with the ancient practice of bujutsu and even less with the concept of dō of budō. This martial art was later called karate-dō during the 1930s. The name was changed because of the rise of Japanese nationalism and a rejection of all that was not purely Japanese. Karate-dō only consisted in repeating kata (preestablished sequences of movement) without any clear application in situational combat. This was not the case in the techniques of bujutsu. With budō and kendō, for example, there is a re-creation of combat through attacking and defending that is still practiced. All of the techniques of bujutsu aim at direct applications in real combat situations. Any tradition of combat application in karate from Okinawa was not transmitted to Japan via Funakoshi. This explains the efforts of certain notable Japanese marital artists, like Konishi, Otsuka and others, who tried to raise the quality of karate by integrating budō’s concept of dō. For these Japanese martial artists, deeply experienced in the tradition of kenjutsu and other disciplines of traditional bujutsu, the content and design of a martial art is inseparable from the practice of combat. Indeed, for a great number of masters of the time, karate-dō represented a “folk dance” coming from their “country cousins in the sea,” and it was not of the same pedigree as the bujutsu of the “Japanese bushi.” It must be remembered that in Okinawa, karate-dō was practiced in fields and hidden places, in the greatest secrecy. There is no proof that karate-dō grew from combat techniques born in the battlefields like bujutsu. However, one only need remember that the archipelago of Okinawa knew the same political upheaval and had many wars, just as in Japan. Okinawa formed “a bridge” for the relations between Japan and the remainder of Asia, for example,\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 16\n\n12/18/09 8:50:45 AM\n\nWHAT IS NINJUTSU?\n\n17\n\nThe Ichinin ikkoku inka written in 1565 by Kamiizumi Hidetsuna for Yagyū Muneyoshi.\n\nTaiwan, China of the south, Malaysia, and so forth.15 It was essential that Okinawa display a certain level of political neutrality and, thus, avoid war with their more powerful neighbors. By the time karate-dō was imported to Japan, it had undergone its first transformation, passing from basic techniques of martial self-defense to an exercise routine intended for the education of schoolboys.16 In Japan, karate-dō was developed primarily for the academic world. Thereafter, eminent colleagues of Funakoshi came from Okinawa to Japan to make known and to develop their unique practice and style of karate-dō. These were Kenwa Mabuni (1889–1952), founder of Shitō-ryū; Chojun Miyagi (1888–1953), founder of Gojū-ryū; Kanbun Uechi (1888–1937), founder of Uechi-ryū; and Choki Motobu (1871–1944), founder of Motobu-ryū, who brought a level of realism to karate-dō through his personality and dedicated personal practice. Two pupils of Funakoshi established their own schools of karate-dō. Otsuka Hironori (1893–1982) was the founder of Wadō-ryū, and Oyama Masutatsu (1923–1994), who was the founder of Kyokushin-kai karate.\n\nAikidō The last pillar in the development of budō was Ueshiba Morihei (1883–1969), founder of aikidō. Aikidō started from his experimentation in several traditional bujutsu schools, and it influenced by his mystical and esoteric religious beliefs. Ueshiba remains truly remarkable, and, compared to Funakoshu and Kanō, was the only one who had direct contact with traditional bujutsu, combined with a sincere and deep religious conviction. This deep tie to spirituality and close association with religious practices often went hand in hand with the practice of bujutsu with the majority of the warriors of feudal Japan. The foundation of certain schools, such as Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū (天真正伝香取神道流)17 and Kashima Shin-ryū (鹿島 神流)18 are examples where the practice of combat and spirituality coexisted for the warrior class since the Kamakura period. Ueshiba studied the sword and spear techniques, and jūjutsu of many schools, including Yagyū Shingan-ryū (柳生心眼流),19 before meeting Master Takeda Sokaku (1860–1969).20 Master Takeda, founder of Daitō-ryū (大東流),21 deeply affected Ueshiba in his martial practice and in the future development of aikidō (合気道). Ueshiba also became the disciple of Onisaburō Deguchi (1871–1947)22 principal pillar of Omoto-kyō (大本教). Aikidō, created in 1942, is a synthesis between Ueshiba’s martial experiments and the precepts of Deguchi’s Omoto-kyō. To promote aikidō, then called Ueshiba-ryū, Ueshiba approached the political powers of the time and acquired many disciples who were highly ranked Japanese naval officers. Ueshiba’s incredible control of combat techniques brought him many supporters from the military. He took on many challenges\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 17\n\n12/18/09 8:50:46 AM\n\nFree ebooks ==> www.Ebook777.com 18\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nand attracted numerous pupils, among whom one finds an envoy of Kanō!23 But do we really understand Ueshiba? To know him would be to know his style and practice, particularly since he “lived aikidō.” Nowadays, aikidō is very different from what was created by Ueshiba. Indeed, his late son, Kisshomaru, instituted a technical reorganization of aikidō. This reorganization came about because, even though his father was a martial teacher beyond compare, Ueshiba belonged to the old generation of masters who demonstrated their techniques rather than explaining them. As in traditional bujutsu, the aikidō disciples had to The founder of the Asayama ichiden-ryū taijutsu, develop the mental discipline to grasp the essence of the Asayama Ichiden-sai. Painting from the Bukei haykunin-shū. Private collection. techniques based on their impressions during the moment of technical exchange with the master. However, as aikidō attracted more and more followers and as Ueshiba began to dissociate from Daitō-ryū, it became apparent that a formal technical progression program, something suitable for aikidō, was needed in order to be able to form and develop the art. At present, the Aiki-kai24 of Tōkyō, set up by the late Kisshomaru, remains the only organization where a great number of high-level instructors had some direct contact with the founder. However, the nature of this contact varied according to the individual in question. Some remained with Ueshiba for only a short amount of time, others trained with him longer. Some of Ueshiba’s students, such as Tomiki, Mochizuki, and Shioda, studied during a time when the founder was still under the technical influence of Daitō-ryū, and others, such as Saito Morihiro, witnessed the transformation and the technical foundation of aikidō. Many charismatic figures teach and pass on the message of Ueshiba. But in regard to the essence of that art and style created by the founder himself, it seems that only a meticulous study of several bujutsu, combined with a deep, intrinsic introspection would produce an epiphany similar to Ueshiba’s. Presently, the practice of aikidō tends to alter the reality of combat, as there is a tacit agreement between the partners during the confrontation. The famous “aiki” (合気: union of energies, meetings of energies, merging into one energy),25 is directed towards synchronization and mutual timing to the detriment of interference, which is the foundation of combat in general. In the meantime, a certain number of old schools of sword and combat technique continue to pass down their techniques in traditional form, but only with an extremely limited number of followers. The founder of the Tagaki yōshin-ryū school of jūjutsu, Today, in Japan, the meaning of the word budō Takagi Umanosuke. Painting from the Bukei haykunin-shū.

The followers of modern budō justify themselves with the assertion that the differences between “sport combat” and physical education were blurred because all martial arts practice was confined by General Douglas MacArthur and the Supreme Command of Allied Power (SCAP), during the occupation of Japan, to only those activities not deemed “militaristic” or “martial.”\n\nwww.Ebook777.com The Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 18\n\n12/18/09 8:50:46 AM\n\nWHAT IS NINJUTSU?\n\n19\n\nInterestingly, in Japan, as in the rest of the world, there are martial art philosophies that seem to have the form of budō. Many of these post-Meiji efforts claim the authenticity of a budō tradition, but they appear incomplete as they try to compensate for their lack of the bujutsu spirit that budō draws from. One can find schools that insist on an austere, violent, and even bloody attitude. The effort, even the physical suffering, are evident in their practice. In fact, they often take pride on the amount of pain and suffering practitioners have to bear. Other schools claim a spiritual, or even mystical, approach to combat, with an attitude of going beyond aggressiveness, and they are critical of the more austere schools, which they see as primitive and unworthy of the tradition of budō. Among these modern expressions of budō are the vacillating philosophies that blend in “sport” speeches, colored with various “enlightYamada Nobuo, famous enments,” preaching well-being and health. Some of these schools taught master of kusarigama jutsu, an approach to competition that focused only on tournament presentation, from the Bukei haykuninshū. Private collection. style, and “flash”, while in others, research of the effectiveness of their style is paramount, and they preach “the budō spirit” or “the spirit of the samurai” combined with a Spartan and dangerous physical regime as they struggle to understand the unspoken, undocumented intent of their founders. In the final analysis, what benefit comes from these approaches? All that remains is a painravaged student with a body broken by the effects of a practice regime too austere, who doesn’t gain a form of spiritual enlightenment as his body is forever damaged. Then there is the compulsion to pursue medals and honors from a variety of tournaments and sport competitions. All of this comes from a martial practice and history where the very essence demands that one persevere in humble practice. Perhaps our Western mindset, so prevalent in martial arts today, has simply discarded the importance of pleasure and individual Izasa Choisai, founder of the Tenshin Shōden Katori well-being.

The representation of this discipline outside of Japan has seldom been edifying. This is not to say that some presentations of ninjutsu haven’t been accurate, but the “myth” of the ninja seems to be the point of reference for the world. So, as we explore the “myth” and the art of ninjutsu, you will gain a better overall comprehension of a martial art that is as important as it is mysterious.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 19\n\n12/18/09 8:50:47 AM\n\n20\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nYamada Yoshinaru, famous master of bujutsu.

Private collection.\n\nThe origins of ninjutsu are surrounded by mysteries and legends, seemingly developed to scramble its tracks. One cannot speak about ninjutsu without evoking the image of the terrifying devotee, who devoted body and heart to it: the ninja, the “superspy”, who left fear and death on his wake. The ninja was, and remains, in the fullest sense of the word, a specialist, a veritable combat expert, fluent in the handling of a variety of weapons, a remarkable scout, tracker, acrobat, and illusionist. However, what most know of the ninja and ninjutsu is only a pale reflection of reality. For instance, the commonly held image of the ninja clad all in black is itself a recent invention. Indeed, it appeared at the same time as all the legends and myths, during the Genroku era (1688–1704), when the first paintings representing the ninja were created, starting with the military chronicles (軍記物: gunki-mono).27 From there, a whole class of fantasy literature developed, making the ninja out to be a superman, giving him awesome and terrifying magical capabilities. Cultural influences resulting from the “floating world” (浮世絵: ukiyo-e) in 1780, also seized on this image, which, at the same time created both fear and fascination. The image of the warrior clad in black, a color which gave him a demonic and mysterious visage, developed at the same time as all the legends regarding ninjutsu and the supposed skills obtained through its practice. Certain paintings showed the ninja as an honest warrior, being introduced furtively into a castle or using his psychic abilities to detect danger. Others, on the contrary, showed violence and the perceived threat that characterized it. Another collection of paintings, shunga (春画), shows the ninja in scenes of eroticism taken to the extreme. These representations show a black clad ninja, with disproportionately enhanced sexual anatomy, subjecting his partner to a whole series of erotic flexibility exercises that would make any yoga master blush! Ehon Futami-gata (1803),28 a book of illustrations attributed to Illustration of Edo hokapiki, or Edo’s law enforcement’s, man Hokusai (or possibly to Utamaro) shows a ninja in action.

This painting is one of the first s to show st sh how w the ninja as a man dressed in black. uki, wh w ere Most of these paintings draw inspiration from certain parts of kabuki, where Famous painting 29 ly written the ninja played a role. The part Meiboku Sendai Hagi was originally from Hokusai showing a ninja es of th he for jōrori (theater of the puppets) and offers us one of the best examples the climbing. nin nninja portrayed as a magician. The character of Nikki Danjō, a follower of ninjutsu, is transformed into a rat, using incantations and a form of ritual magic. This character became the most famous theatrical ninja. In the play Kikutsuki Irafune Banashi,30 there appears a ninja by the name of Tenjiku Tokubei, who is transformed into a giant frog, using a magic ritual that he executes with his fingers. There are many parts where warriors are presented like ninja and, under cover of the intimidating, dark clothing, they carry out their misdeeds. The famous history of the 47 Rōnin, which became one of the most popular works of Japanese literature, also promotes the myth als of the ninja. The night attack launched by the faithful avenging vassals he seagainst Kira Yoshimoto implied the complicity of the darkness and the he scene crecy that the night offers.

And the list goes on. However, these popular caricatures give only vague information on ninjutsu. This image of the ninja appears in almost all the epic and fantasy novels of Japan. It is this image that the Japanese have in mind when they think of ninja and ninjutsu. Westerners are no different. Most see ninjutsu as arcane, combining occult practices with extremely effective combat techniques. Is this really true? Ninjutsu is not a bujutsu, nor is it a sporting practice resulting from budō. It cannot even be classified as being like budō. It did not follow the way traced by budō as it cut a path during the Meiji period. Rather ninjutsu practitioners observed the changes in martial arts from deep in the shadows and watched the evolution of budō from bujutsu. To observe, to spy, to predict, and to stop danger, this, in a few words, is how ninjutsu is summarized. Ninjutsu, or ninpō, is a kakutō-jutsu (格闘術), that is a true science of survival and combat born of necessity to predict and protect one from danger. Although, technically, the difference is obvious when compared with bujutsu, the contrast lies mainly in one’s frame of mind. Ninjutsu shows how to be a ghost to one’s enemy and to “disappear” in front of him. Samurai disguised as a ninja in Defined in the English language often by the phrase “the art of observation. From the Ehon Taira remaining unseen” or “the invisible art,” even these definitions of ningunki by Kunisada Tadachūji, in jutsu do not fully illustrate that invisibility, anonymity, and secrecy are 1852.

Deception is the foundation of all warrior strategies, and ninjutsu is no exception. However, it should be noted that in the use of tricks or stratagems, ninjutsu exceeds all others disciplines by far. This is why the lords of feudal Japan surrounded themselves with practitioners of ninjutsu. One can also define ninjutsu as “the use of tricks” and the manner of putting them into practice. All the weapons and techniques of the ninja were created with the aim of misleading, of deceivIse Saburō, famous ninja warrior and friend of Minamoto ing the enemy and, thus, overcoming him. By using no Yoshitsune. Painting from the Bukei haykunin-shū. Private collection. deception, the ninja could survive. It is the prerogative of spies, and ninja are no exception. Each warrior culture had its own rules and precepts. For example, an old Arab work of the end of the thirteenth century was titled The Book of Tricks. The anecdotes and councils reported in this work show a remarkable similarity to the principles of ninjutsu. Put more trust in your tricks than in your bravery, and give more importance to your circumspection than to your courage in combat, because war is a continual effort to mislead the enemy. It is truly a struggle for those who rush blindly into an operation but only a momentary cloud for those who remain wary.33 Although Japan and Arabia are societies with different warrior cultures, the science of using deception in combat does not differ. The advice in this Arabic work shows a certain resemblance to the principles of ninjutsu that consists of using deception and tricks continuously against the enemy. From a deeper perspective, it also shows the cautious, careful, and attentive character of the ninja, who did not dive blindly into the mouth of the wolf. It is very interesting to note a similarity with the attitudes and techniques of combat that one finds among the tribes of Native Americans. As a practice intended to predict and defeat danger, ninjutsu demonstrated a control of time and information, which are essential for survival and success during a confrontation. Ninja did not engage in protracted battles but were deployed sparingly when it would impact the outcome successfully. Also, rather than face the enemy head on, ninja would use all the fraud, deceit, and trickery that were necessary to successfully carry out the battle or the mission. An example drawn from the same work illustrates this well:\n\nTsukahara Bokuden, famous warriors who founded the Kashima shintō-ryū. Painting from the Bukei haykunin-shū.

A ninja’s role as a spy was to sow disorder and confusion in the enemy troops after having carried out his mission of information gathering.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 22\n\n12/18/09 8:50:57 AM\n\nWHAT IS NINJUTSU?\n\n23\n\nNinja Attributes To illustrate the methods of subterfuge used in ninjutsu, outside entities (particularly Chinese martial artists) would often draw comparison to the behavior of savage animals. Animal behavior gives some insight into how the ninja behaved in combat. The ninja, however, would not be dominated by animal instincts, as these did not take into account an intelligent sense of timing. All animals, especially the wildest and most dangerous, are captured or killed by more intelligent adversaries. A key to understanding ninjutsu is knowing that the birthplace of this art was in the provinces of Iga and Kōga, which were mostly uninhabited wild areas. The observation of nature, of the practices and habits of people as well as the climatic phenomena, plays a considerable role in practice of ninjutsu. One can easily understand that the first ninja, practicing in the wild mountains of these areas, developed very keen skills in observation and adaptation. To know how to observe is an essential capacity for a ninja, because all his strategies started with careful observation. To be crafty is not enough. It is also necessary to have physical and psychological conditioning, a potent combination that makes it possible to be most effective. Especially necessary for the follower of ninjutsu, one must develop clarified determination, which makes it possible to adapt to Ittō Ittōsai, the founder of Ittō-ryū, and his successor, any situation and to effectively and judiciously use Migami Tenzen Tadaaki.

Private collection. believe, a great number of ninja who had all skills necessary to disappear at the first inkling of danger. Only from the purity of his deepest convictions could one in a thousand ever arrive at this level. It is for this reason that the skills and deepest essence of ninjutsu have always been passed only to the person who gathers the deepest of human qualities. With this in mind, consider the following: What one calls ninjutsu was, in the beginning, a discipline of the kobujutsu (traditional techniques of combat). Having changed its form, part of this art remains in Japan. Ninjutsu does not consist in attacking men or taking life without reason, as many would like to believe. The character nin (忍) of ninjutsu, is read shinobu or shinobi. To apply one’s thoughts and ego to the edge of the sword; to be constantly vigilant of one’s self and one’s surroundings and to have courage with endurance . . . such is the intention of the word, shinobu (忍ぶ). If one exerts his will in an unreasonable way, the blade stops us at once, and cuts us; and, thus, to act under the constraint of a blade prevents us from being driven by the winds of change. To act by controlling one’s ego, such is true essence of the character nin in ninpō (忍法).35 By understanding the various intepretations of the character nin, we begin to get a clearer picture of the follower of ninjutsu and can see that it is far from that reported by novels and films. Although there is no technical information given in this example, it shows the state of mind necessary for the practice of ninjutsu.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 23\n\n12/18/09 8:50:58 AM\n\n24\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nNinjutsu is more than a simple set of techniques for guerrilla warfare. The heart of the techniques in ninjutsu lies in the practice of vigilance, by finding and exploiting an opening from all directions, by retaining flexibility and strength forged by endurance. For practitioners of ninjutsu, it all came down to survival in order to help and to protect their families during a period of history where the slightest dissent could mean death. Just as the great religions appeared during very disturbed periods in history, so did ninjutsu. Ninja were trained to endure and to avoid danger by seeing it, accepting it, and adapting to it. The following is another impression, different from the first but also indicative of the practice: The spirit of the ninja is based on the ability to endure shame without exerting resentment. It is not a question of dangerous actions, in wounding people by putting a sharp blade to the heart but rather like the flower, flexible, to be full of love and peace. In short, to naturally evade the sword of the enemy, to be invisible, and for the people and the nation to overcome the enemy by using the five phases of Nature, such are the principles of the ninja.36 In this passage, one realizes that the level of endurance goes well beyond any ordinary example. It is a question of enduring and of overcoming the seemingly insurmountable without “exerting resentment,” which for an ordinary person would be rather difficult. Only one with a disciplined body and who lives in perfect spiritual harmony would be able to maintain this level of endurance.\n\nDisciplines of the Ninja To be able to disappear, to “be erased” in the mind and eye of the enemy, and use nature judiciously, requires more than one simple technique; rather, it requires a very focused state of mind. It requires a vision of a very precise way of living that appears when one’s life and lifestyle are threatened. It is honed by developing a pragmatic approach to combat. This brings us back to the issue of the ninja’s many specializations and to the spirit and tactics used. In understanding the dispassionate yet focused manner in which a ninja can accomplish the mission at hand, one might be led to suspect that there would be a certain number of mentally or emotionally disturbed practitioners. But how can one claim to have a unity of body and spirit, and in a certain manner to truly be spiritual, if one is flawed in mind and body? The philosophy and teaching of ninpō is a useless jumble of great words and ideals if one does not have a certain physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual balance—to be, quite simply, human. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a level of psychological health through physical discipline, combining flexibility and adaptation.

It is the control of the union between the body and the spirit that makes it possible to reach this level. Ninjutsu is composed of eight fundamental disciplines, whose generic title is ninja no hachimon (忍 者之八門: eight disciplines of the ninja) or ninja no hakkei (忍者之八景).

In addition to their secret techniques, the ninja used the long sword (daitō) and short sword (kodachi).

This shows that the ninja’s reputation for warriorship was not overrated. Nevertheless, it’s hard to imagine how the ninja could master all these arts and so many various techniques of combat. Obviously the ninja had to set aside a considerable amount of time for training. The essence of training in these various disciplines lies in ninpō-tai-jutsu (忍法体術): technique for using the body according to rules of endurance, perseverance and survival. This is a natural and unified approach to combat, where the harmony of the body and the spirit allows one’s actions to flow with natural movement and enables one to hide and suppress one’s injuries, adapting to all situations. The study of ninjutsu included various fields, such as strategy, combat in all its forms, medicine, psychology, and so on. Ninjutsu showed how to use nature or the enviroment and the body to “disappear” and to attain this the practitioner needed to lose himself (lose his ego) and study deeply. It is about a deep knowledge of the union of opposites that one acquires through a discipline dedicated to survival in the face of the threat of obliteration. Knowing the nature of danger makes it possible to circumvent it, just as knowing weapons and their use allows one to stop them or to use them with accuracy. Of course, this is not simple and it is not for everyone. As the old saying goes, “Many are called, but few are chosen.” It is one of the reasons that ninjutsu was (and continues to be) taught to select individuals.\n\nDefining Ninjutsu As mentioned, in the first character of the word ninjutsu, one can perceive the state of mind of one devoted to the art. The character nin (忍) covers several significant levels; therefore, the follower of ninjutsu, the ninja, cannot be restricted to only one definition. Indeed, when it is pronounced shinobu, it has the meaning “to endure,” “to support,” and “to be tenacious,” and when it is pronounced shinobaseru, it has the meanings “to hold hidden,” “to hide,” “to be furtive,” “to be secretive.” In looking at the meaning of the character nin, one begins to understand that the practitioner of ninjutsu is a person who acts in secrecy and that ninjutsu is the practice that makes it possible to act in secrecy through the use of deception. By breaking up the character nin, one finds two other characters: heart (心) and blade (刃).\n\nThe tengu-shō section of the Shinkage-ryū heihō mokuroku no koto.

The first interpretation depicts the state of mind of one who suffers, supports misfortune, and must moreover hide— for instance, to conceal and suppress pain and weakness, as described earlier. The second interpretation refers to a way of practice in which one’s willpower becomes as sharp as a spinning blade. The body, terribly effective, is the tool of expression for this will. This evokes, consequently, the control of the spirit upon the body. The concept of the “way of practice” with ninjutsu is different from that identified with the concept of budō. Contrary to the latter, one did not commit oneself to find personal enlightenment or intrinsic realization but rather to survive in combat and protect oneself by forming alliances. Therefore, one can say that the follower of ninjutsu, a ninja, is a person (者) who endures and perseveres despite all adversity, and embodies the experience rising from survival. A ninja understands the forces that temper the heart of an enduring person.

The following is a more general definition of ninjutsu or ninpō: Ninjutsu, or ninpō, is a collection of adaptable survival techniques that allows one to face the uncertainties of life and to respond to dangerous situations, through physical and psychological discipline, where one uses orthodox weapons in unorthodox ways.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 27\n\n12/18/09 8:51:00 AM\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThe Public Record of Ninjutsu The purpose of this chapter is to describe, as precisely as possible, the details of historical events concerning ninja and the practice of ninjutsu, based on the most serious and accurate testimonies. A historical account does not have to be exciting or astounding; all that we ask is that it be accurate. To understand the true history of ninjutsu, it is necessary for one to give up a great number of legends and myths. Then one is left with details of a technical nature, the combat techniques.\n\nThe Koyō Gunkan, a text about the Takeda family’s tactics and strategies. Private collection.\n\nOne also needs to discard the image of the black-clad man, a popular image that first appeared in illustrated books between 1770 and 1780.1 Added to this is a whole mixture of heroic legends, esoteric religious practices, of magic and invisibility, and so forth, which brings to mind the charismatic image of the “superspy ninja.” To discover the history of an art such as ninjutsu, and thus of the ninja, one must research the history of the military class, the bushi and their superior martial skills. In almost all the wars that Japan experienced, warring sides used the ninja for information gathering, guerilla tactics, assassinations, and the like. The history of the ninja simply represents a vital part of the history of the Japanese warriors—something often forgotten. Because ninjutsu is a practice of the shadows, the ninja did not belong to any social class. In short, they are the men who acted in the shadows to maintain law and order. Although it is difficult, even impossible to define by whom, where, and when ninjutsu was created, leading Japanese historians Yamaguchi Masayuki,2 Koyama Ryōtarō,3 Tobe Shinjūrō,4 and Sugiyama Hiroshi,5 have fixed five dates where ninjutsu played a major part in the history of Japan. These dates extend over the Muromachi, Sengoku, and Edo periods. These were major turning points in the history of Japan. During these periods, major developments formed the basis for unification of the country.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 28\n\n12/18/09 8:51:00 AM\n\nTHE PUBLIC RECORD OF NINJUTSU\n\n29\n\nWe begin our study of the role of the ninja with a look at all of the unconventional aspects of the historical Japanese battles ranging between the Muromachi, Sengoku, and Edo periods. In particular, we will examine accounts of activities ranging from espionage to assassination, of guerilla warfare to night raids, and missions of any unorthodox military operations from which the ninja could not be dissociated. That implies a study of the historical facts of certain chronicles of battles (gunkimono or gunki-monogatari). These epic stories, similar to Homer’s Iliad, tell the exploits and combat of great warriors during the continual wars of eleventh through sixteenth centuries. Although these battle chronicles are often unconfirmed or dubious, they bring many insights on the value and combat techniques of the warriors of the time. The ubiquitous military treatise on strategy and espionage, written by Sun Zi, is a point that one should not neglect in the search for unorthodox operations at the time of these battles. The final chapter of that treatise places great importance on the use of expert spies for misinformation, espionage, guerilla warfare, assassination, and the like. For Tobe Shinjūrō6 and Koyama Ryōtarō,7 the work of Sun Zi seems to have been a traditional necessity for the training of any Japanese military strategist. To accurately determine the history of the ninja and of ninjutsu, we must give up looking for these specific terms, as both are recent names. These terms were used for the Edo period in a work entitled Buyō Benryaku8 written in 1684. The most widespread term in the historical chronicles of wars is that of shinobi no mono or simply shinobi. However, one also finds a whole list of names and expressions relating to the acts of the ninja. The Hōjō Godai-ki (北条五代記)9, among other things, uses the terms rappa and seppa, and the Kōyō Gunkan (甲陽軍鑑: chronicle of the Takeda family) uses the term, kagimono-kiki (嗅物聴).10 In order understand the Muromachi period (1333–1467) to any degree, one must first gain an understanding of the preliminary historical background concerning the Heian and Kamakura periods, as well as have a familiarity with the “War between the Court of the North and the Court of the South” (Nambokuchō sensō). Indeed, if we start directly with the first date when the term ninja first appears, we omit a rich history of events that helped develop ninjutsu. So that one can clearly see the lineages, we will start with the origins of ninjutsu, in particular, by looking at all their interactions, influences, and exchanges. These, according to the historians quoted above, are at the epicenter of ninjutsu.\n\nTheories Related to the Historical Origins of Ninjutsu When a historian who specializes in the history of feudal Japan discovers the character of the ninja or shinobi no mono through readings and research, he or she becomes intrigued. A mysterious figure, with seemingly incredible capabilities and accomplishments, a true chameleon of combat and spy without peer, the ninja is hidden in the shadows of all the wars, often acting to turn the tide and snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. Who are the ninja? What is the source of the practice of ninjutsu? There are many theories advanced regarding the beginnings of ninjutsu, with a seemingly wide variety of proposed origins. These theories are reinforced by the obvious diversity of techniques employed in the martial art. It is difficult to see clearly through this clouded historical lens. One saying goes: 忍 者 の 世 界 は 迚 も 奥 が 深 い 所 で す 11 The world of the ninja is deep and complex. 忍 び の 歴 史 は 長 く 古 い 12 The history of the ninja is long and old.\n\nThese sentences, which one finds in the majority of the Japanese works “specializing” in ninjutsu and\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 29\n\n12/18/09 8:51:01 AM\n\n30\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nView of the Hakuho castle of Iga’s Ueno city. Private collection.\n\nthe ninja, show how difficult it is to seize upon the true origins of ninjutsu. Although it is nearly impossible to determine the exact time, place, and origin of ninjutsu, there are some reasonable inferences that can be made. The military treatise on strategy, Sonbu no heihō (孫武之兵法) contains the teachings of the famous Chinese strategist Sun Zi, who lived in the sixth century BCE It also contains a body of oral doctrines supplemented by Se Ma during the same period, then further by Zi from the third century BCE This combined body of work was introduced in Japan as early as the sixth century CE. A chapter concerning espionage at the end of the treatise, according to historians Yamaguchi and Tobe, contains the fundamental principles that are at the heart of the practice that will later be called ninjutsu. Ninjutsu would be a practice of combat, or a martial art, that would make it possible to realize the theories of invisibility and deceit, preached by Sun Zi. 彼を知り己を知れば百戦致て危うからず If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the results of a hundred battles.13\n\nThis famous maxim attributed to Sun Zi, on which generations of soldiers meditated, represents the essence of ninjutsu, that is, a deep and fundamental knowledge of the psychological and physical aspects of adapting to extreme situations and turning obstacles into advantages. However, that doesn’t exactly pinpoint the precise origin of ninjutsu, because, if it is undeniable that the ninja was a spy-warrior without equal, it is also necessary to include and understand the reasons for which this system of combat was invented. What later became shinobu ho (忍ぶ法: the old reading of the term ninjutsu), a highly systematized and scientific method of combat, espionage, and defense, sprang from various sources in reaction against the forces of the current dominating political, economic, and social traditions of the Japanese classes. As early as the seventh century, many immigrants arrived from the mainland, in particular from China and Korea, and among these immigrants were monks, wise Taoists, military officers, potters, merchants, and craftsmen, all having fled their country of origin for various reasons. It is likely that genjutsu (玄術: techniques of illusion, conjuring), and kenpō (剣法, 拳法: Chinese combat techniques with bare hands and with weapons) arrived in Japan and developed jointly thereafter with the local combat techniques.14\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 30\n\n12/18/09 8:51:01 AM\n\nTHE PUBLIC RECORD OF NINJUTSU\n\n31\n\nTemple in the Yagyū village in Mie prefecture. Private collection.\n\nAt the same time, new religious branches of esoteric Buddhism, such as mikkyō (密教), were imported into Japan, In addition to ascetic and shamanistic practices developed in the mountains, there also arose the practice of onmyōdō (陰陽道: way of yin and yang) also known as inyō gogyō setsu (陰陽五行説: theory of the five phases yin and yang).15 Between the 8th and 11th century, a great number of immigrants, as well as defeated and displaced Japanese bushi started to form autonomous groups, withdrawn in the mountains in order to hide far from the major urban centers. These homeless and lord-less warriors often escaped into the wilderness after the armies to which they belonged were routed and defeated in battle. The provinces of Iga (伊賀) and Kōga (甲賀), due to their remote locations and inhospitable venue, represented the ideal place for these cultural groups. The separation from mainstream Japanese society allowed these expatriates to freely research combat techniques that would be the origin of ninjutsu and also many other Japanese martial schools. Despite the many legends attributing the development of ninjutsu to ancient mythical gods, the art probably developed between 10th and the 14th century. Indeed, it is the fruit of the interaction of religious sources and soldiers who produced a uniquely Japanese approach regarding the use of nature, cosmic laws (meteorology, astronomy, divination, etc.), of psychology and physiology of man in order to permanently affect history in order to obtain the means of physical and spiritual survival. This complete knowledge, after all, was regarded as a means of facing the various challenges in life, and achieving the necessary goals in all these situations. However, it is erroneous to believe that all of this developed in a vacuum, without other influences. There is a theory that Japanese pirates could also have contributed to the origin of ninjutsu. It is a historical fact, since antiquity up until the Edo period (1603–1867), that the Japanese seas were infested with pirates known under the name of kaizoku (海賊).16 Kumano, an area located south of Iga, is an ancient stronghold of the shintō religion. Pirates, depending on sanctuary from the shintō priests of Kumano, practiced combat techniques that contained a great deal of religious influence. It was under similar circumstances that the creation of the famous schools of kenjutsu, Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū and Kashima Shin-ryū, were both founded under the inspiration of warriors who lived in the sanctuaries Katori and Kashima.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 31\n\n12/18/09 8:51:01 AM\n\n32\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nPriests, who offered and managed the sanctuaries of Katoria and Kashima in the area of Kantō, influenced a great number of combat technique schools. One finds the name of the temple at Kurama (鞍馬 寺)17 in Kyōto prominent in the genealogies of many of traditional bujutsu schools, particularly Nen-ryū (念流). One of the principal instructors of Kurama-ryū, Tozawa Hakuunsai, is reputed to have been a ninji, and his name appears in various genealogies of old schools of ninjutsu. All the warriors of the time sought out the celebrated warrior Minamoto Yoshitsune, initiated into the martial arts by Kiichi Hōgan, head of the Kurama-ryū kenjutsu school that possessed a military study of strategy and combat called the Rikutō Sanryaku (六韜三略). Yoshitsune later founded his own school, Yoshitsune-ryū ninjutsu.18 One can easily conclude that a great number of temples had secret circles where there were taught a whole series of special combat styles, which can be called a form of ninjutsu; all obviously practiced in private, away from prying eyes. The Kuki (九鬼氏) family, who were reputed pirates, was distinguished in two ways. They were recognized socially and accepted in the warrior caste. They enjoyed great influence in the sea of Kumano and the Ise area. They were also well known for their school of combat, which still exists today under the name of Kukishinden-ryū (九鬼神伝流). One of the scrolls (makimono) of this school shows the techniques and tools used that found their way into other arts. When boarding enemy ships, the pirates of this school used a hook, like many others. However, this hook, called a kagi-nawa, formed an integral part of the arsenal used by the ninja during their various missions. The use of this hook with a fine cord, generally made from braided woman’s hair, gave rise to many combat techniques included in the practice of ancient ninjutsu. These disciplines are: ✦ ✦ ✦ ✦\n\nkaginawa-jutsu (the technique of using the hook and cord) kusarigama-jutsu (the technique of using the chain and sickle) torinawa-jutsu (the technique of using the cord to bind the adversary in combat) kusari-jutsu (the technique of using the chain)\n\nIt is a solid assumption that the techniques used by Japanese pirates influenced ninjutsu, as well as many other combat styles. This influence was part of the range that affected ninjutsu, helping it to become an evolutionary combat style used for evasion and self-defense.\n\nBirth of Primitive Ninjutsu Practice during the Heian Period (782–1190) In 782, the capital in Nara was transferred to the town of Heian-kyō, present-day Kyōto. It was a period of great change that enriched nobility and established many great houses. It is during this period that the Tendai doctrines of China are brought back by Saichō monks and Shingon doctrines, another Chinese esoteric Buddhist system, is brought back by Kūkai.19 Shugendō (修験道), Buddhist ascetics founded by In no Gyōja between the seventh and the eighth century, developed and had considerable influence into the twelfth century in the Kumano area, south of the peninsula of Kii. Many temples and sanctuaries related to this practice were found here. Onmyōdō (陰陽道: the way of yin and yang), a science of predicting the future based, among other things, on the astronomy of ancient China combined with the theory of the five male and female phases (五行説: gogyō setsu), was introduced in Japan at the same period. The practices of shugendō and onmyōdō, which some at the time found amusing, influenced the practice of ninjutsu, which was, according to Koyama,20 still in its infancy. These two doctrines were largely\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 32\n\n12/18/09 8:51:01 AM\n\nFree ebooks ==> www.Ebook777.com THE PUBLIC RECORD OF NINJUTSU\n\n33\n\nwidespread among the ascetics, yamabushi (hermits of the mountains), shaman, and warriors of the time. One must note that these beliefs, while scoffed at by some, were not restricted to the hermits, monks, and warriors. In the case of onmyōdō, many well-read men of the time were believers and practitioners. Indeed, these scholars were the source of the introduction and the development of these doctrines in Japan. Their interests in these beliefs were different from those of the warriors and hermits, because knowledge of the sciences from China gave one great prestige and status. This knowledge was of capital importance in order to pass the examinations needed for promotion among the senior government officials of the period.21 Powerful, warrior families, such as the Minamoto and the Taira clans, maintained Illustration showing the Prince close relations with various yamabushi, hermits, and shamans.

Private collection. population. This was a considerable asset when the yamabushi moved from one area to another, collecting vital information. Many researchers and historians saw in the yamabushi, ascetics, hermits, and warrior monks, the characteristics and personalities that formed the precursors of the ninja. Ninjutsu evolved as a martial art without a preestablished code. Since it developed in locations where hermits, ascetics, dissidents, and deposed warriors came to seek refuge and live peace, it is understandable that this “melting pot” of various religious practices influenced the development of the art over time. Relationships with the great warrior families of the time started to emerge. This later made it possible for ninjutsu to be incorporated into the disciplines of combat that these families used while following imperial orders, which consisted of removing Ainu and other rebels representing a possible threat. At the principle temples of the time, it was common to find a number of monks who were able to handle the staff, the bow, and sword. They put these skills to use defending the goods and interests of the temples. The great establishments, Enryakuji and Onjoji, which formed the two branches of Tendai, Kōfukuji and Todaiji of Nara, had the most troops and often entered in conflict against each other and sometimes in support of the local provincial governor.22 These warrior monks, often called akusō (悪僧: bad monks) or sōhei (僧兵: monk soldiers), became a major element of the Japanese warrior structure starting in the eleventh century and remained a dominant element until the end of the sixteenth century. In the light of these facts, one can conclude that a great majority of the temples provided training in combat techniques via the warrior-monks, and as a result of sharing the same geographical locations, primarily in the mountains, it is not unthinkable that relationships developed with dissidents, hermits, ascetics, and future ninja. Many of these so-called “outcasts” belonged to a class that was part of the hierarchy set up during the Heian period. However, as mentioned previously, they returned to live in the mountains, living like nomads, obeying no lord. Mainstream government classified them as “outcasts” at the time, because they were not included in the local government’s tax rolls. This “separateness” allowed them a great freedom of movement. It is easy to presume that the large temples and ambitious warrior families maintained close relations with these “outcasts,” which enabled the mainstream participants in society to act in the shadows without dirtying their hands directly.\n\nwww.Ebook777.com The Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 33\n\n12/18/09 8:51:01 AM\n\n34\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nQualified personnel were required to manage these great tracts of property and fields owned by the temples and the warrior families. These worker castes, the saka-hinin (坂非 人: people of the banks, outcasts practicing all the trades in connection with butchery and tanning, and the like), included a small group of specialists who were entrusted to collect information and conduct espionage. This group was bound by religious conviction and profit, as well as any alliances that allowed for the survival of their particular clan. One can suggest that the precursors of the ninja, as well as the ninja themselves, find their origin among outcasts called the shōmonji (声聞師: reciting), a kind of traveling acrobat or magician. One can attribute the lack of consistent, clear historical evidence of the relationships of ninja to outcasts in this period of history to the simple fact that the ninja could change appearance and thus their level of social condition in order to carry out the entrusted mission. It is difficult to be categorical about the existence of the ninja during this period. However, there were many factors that make it possible to assert that various minority groups in the fringes of society were devoted to practices that would quickly evolve into ninjutsu. It wasn’t until the twelfth century, with the emergence of great warrior families of Momochi, Hattori, and Fujibayashi in the Iga and Kōga provinces, that ninjutsu became an independent and recognized technique of combat. A turning point for Japan and the development of ninjutsu came at the end of the Heian period. A combination of the weakening of the central government, the intrigues and plots in the imperial palace and the competitions between This illustration shows the famous warrior Benkei, the warrior families, like those of the Minamoto and Taira friend of Minamoto Yoshintsune. Private collection. clans, supported the development of ninjutsu as a method of combat and espionage. Little by little, ninjutsu became an essential pursuit for the warrior families of this period. The precursors of ninjutsu, alive in the provinces of Iga and Kōga that were located near the towns of Kyōto and Nara, the great metropolitan centers of the time, all offered their various services and made alliances with the future government leaders, the temples, and new warrior classes starting to emerge.\n\nThe Emergence of the Warrior Class The Kamakura period (1192–1333) marked a great turning point in the history of Japan. Indeed, following a period of great conflict and at the end of ten years of social and political crisis, Minamoto no Yoritomo, leader of victorious the Minamoto clan came to power. Minamoto no Yoritomo defeated the Taira clan (in the battle known as Gempei), set up his new regime in Kamakura, away from the provinces of Kinai (the area located around the imperial capital, Kyōto). This new regime constituted a governmental framework, making it possible for the warrior classes to ensure their political domination of the\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 34\n\n12/18/09 8:51:01 AM\n\nTHE PUBLIC RECORD OF NINJUTSU\n\n35\n\ncountry for more than seven centuries. With the Yoritomo ascension to power, the emperor and court no longer controlled Japan, but rather the country was led by a succession of shōgun dynasties or powerful families, exerting their influence on the emperor. This period was punctuated by bloody conflicts with the head of the regime, where assassination played a dominant part in order to destabilize and divide opponents.

Because of (or thanks to) all these scheming and political disturbances, there was no shortage of work for the skilled spy and assassin. Wanting to remain anonymous, the powerful families, such as the Hōjō clan, selected skilled adepts who were accustomed to hiding the relationships that allowed the clan to achieve their surreptitious goals without rousing the suspicions of the government. Each new war gave the bushi an opportunity to test and refine their combat skills, and to acquire fame. However, for the groups of spies, it was a time when they worked behind the scenes, doing all the basic work (espionage, assassinations, and guerilla warfare) vital to the victory. Koyama explains why the operatives, thereafter called ninja, were like the immersed part of an iceberg in any battle. They were the bedrock of every battle in which they participated, and they used unorthodox methods in which the Kamakura era warrior class had not been trained. Unlike the samurai of the time, the ninja did not directly face their adversaries. Operating in the shadows as advisors, they were not in a position to open hostilities. In contrast to the bushi with their ideal of loyalty towards their lord, the ninja represented, in Japanese warrior history, an example of a mercenary paid for a specific job, and did not attach any particular honor to being the first thrown into battle. Towards the end of the Kamakura period, in 1336 (the first year of the Engen era or the third year of the Kenmu era) Japan was divided between two warring states, each of which asserted its legitimacy to control A sōhei, monk warrior using a tetsubō, iron staff as a the whole country. shield.

The origin of this crisis was the attempt at restoring the imperial rule by Emperor Godaigo (1319–1338), who tried to throw off the shōgunate set up by Yoritomo. Small bands of mountain warriors assisted Godaigo, as well as a great number of dissatisfied akutō (悪党: gangsters, bad people), who were not in the service of the bakufu (shōgun). All of these disaffected people joined under the banner of Godaigo and were led by a famous military genius named Kusunoki Masashige (1294–1336). He led the resistance with great effectiveness. According to Tobe Shinjūrō,25 the fact that the Kusunoki family originated in the province of Iga, proves that Kusunoki Masashige was a ninja. In fact, Sugiyama26 insisted that Kunosoki Masashige was a specialist in unconventional warfare, which was a method of the ninja and that, among the warriors who were at his Picture taken during Meiji period showing a side, there were certainly experts in guerilla warfare and unSōhei, a warrior monk. Private collection. orthodox techniques of combat. Completely ordinary mountain warriors carried out the majority of the extraordinary techniques and raids, such as the night raid on the Mount Kasagi. These simple warriors were motivated by a strong desire to survive, and demonstrated remarkable ingenuity in the field. Masashige later committed seppuku, a ritual specific to the bushi, which would not have been done by a ninja. Indeed, ninja, being warriors who could turn against their current employer, held no particular loyalty towards any lord. Kusunoki Masashige symbolized the bushidō code, established later, during the Edo period, namely, honesty to all, regardless of rank.27 The accounts of the military campaigns, like all the stratagems used by Kusunoki Masashige, are contained in one of the most famous gunkimono, a blend of historical fact and romantic fiction, called Taiheiki (太平記), compiled between 1360 and 1380. Like the Heike Monogatari (平家物語), as a historical source, certain facts in the Taiheiki are of doubtful validity, but from another point of view, it admirably depicts the values that the bushi held in this period, as well as the battles and unorthodox techniques at the beginning of the fourteenth century. One finds there many references to traditional Chinese military and philosophical thought, including, of course, the treatise of Sun Zi. In contrast to the Heike Monogatari, the Taiheiki abounds with anecdotes that we can infer are practices of ninjutsu, because of the many examples of strategies and topography. However, there is no proof of the use of a group of ninja as a special or unique unit in any of the anecdotes described by the Taiheiki.\n\nFirst Mention of the Ninja During the Muromachi Period (1333–1467) The Muromachi period (1333–1467) starts with the beginnings of the reign of the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshimitsu (1368–1394), and concludes at the end of the war of Önin (1467–1477) with the coup d’etat perpetrated in Kyōto in 1493 by Hosokawa Masamoto, a major lord and minister. It was a transitional period marked by instability and insurrection in all the sectors of society.28 In these troubled times, a new type of warrior appears who left his mark on Japanese military history.\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 36\n\n12/18/09 8:51:02 AM\n\nTHE PUBLIC RECORD OF NINJUTSU\n\n37\n\nThe entrance of Mochizuki’s ninja museum in Iga’s Ueno city, Mie prefecture, private collection.\n\nThe events of the war of Nambokuchō, (1336–1392), took place in a geographical location not far from the provinces of Iga and Kōga, two areas which are forever bound as the cradle of ninja and ninjutsu. The province of Iga, today part of the prefecture of Mie, is located east of Yamato (less than one hundred kilometers from Kyōto). It is a kind of basin surrounded by a nearly perfect chain of mountains whose peaks culminate at an altitude of 1,640 to 1,970 feet (five to six hundred meters) in the north and the west, and around 3,280 feet (one thousand meters) in the south. To the north of Iga and contiguous to the latter, the district of Kōga (340 miles or 548 kilometers from Kyōto, today part of the prefecture of Shiga), is characterized by a landscape of hills that sharply run into cliffs towards the lake Biwa. Towards the south, the mountaintops rise to an altitude of 2,625 feet (eight hundred meters). The two provinces share a similar geography. They represented the ideal hiding-place for all the escaping warriors, fugitives, gangsters, and those dissatisfied with the battles between the two courts. They were a place of refuge for those who wished for seclusion and peace, far from the large cities of the time. The annals of the Muromachi Bakufu, Nochi Kagami (後鑑), provide the first written reference that mentions and associates the ninja with the provinces of Iga and Kōga. In a particular article quoted by Sugiyama Hiroshi, one finds the following: With regard to the ninja, it is known that they were native to the provinces of Iga and Kōga, and could easily slip secretly into enemy castles. They observed the hidden things, and were able to pass as allies to the eyes of their enemies. In the countries of the West (in China), one called them saisaku (細作). The strategists called them kagimono-kiki (嗅物聴).29 This description concerning their activities, including secret intrusion into enemy castles, coincides with what will be discussed later in the numerous reports of\n\nThe Ninja_Chap1-7.indd 37\n\nAshikaga Yoshihisa’s grave situated in Magari district in Ōmi prefecture.

The article also mentions the specific actions to which people of Iga (伊賀之者: Iga no Mono) took part. In this same article, the word shinobi is used rather than ninja: In the camp of the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshihisa in Magari, there were shinobi whose names were known by all in the area. When Yoshihisa attacked Rokkaku Takayori, the family of Kawai Aki no Kami of the area of Iga, in the service of Yoshihisa in Magari, obtained considerable recognition as shinobi in the forefront of the large army of the shōgun. Since then, successive generations of warriors from Iga were admired. This is the origin of the warriors of Iga.30\n\nThe ninth shogun, Ashikaga Yoshihisa (1465–1489).

This was in 1487 in the village of Magari in the province of Kōga. This episode took place at the end of an event of great importance in the history of the Japanese warriors, the Önin War (1467–1477).\n\nNinja sneaking into a castle.

Yoshihisa, mentioned above, was still a child when put among these applicants to the shōgunate. Rather than one major battle or a clash of armies in the field, the Önin War was primarily made up of street battles during which the capital and the prestige of the bakufu were devestated.31 This war lasted ten years, and Yoshihisa, who gained the right to the title of shōgun at nine years of age by his father, Yoshimasa, sought to restore the military prestige of his family as soon as he was of age. His chance came in September 1487 (or 1488). In this year, 46 landowners of the province of Ömi, among those who appeared to be owners of the province of Kōga, sought the assistance of the shōgun against the excesses made by a shugo of Ömi, named Rokkaku Takeyori. Rokkaku planned to seize the lands of each. This type of action was not unusual for the This illustration shows how an intruder time.

These shugo, called daimyō, instead had built autonomous principalities and were the cause of the many wars that took place between 1490 and 1600. The young and proud, Yoshihisa would not tolerate the rebelling shugo and personally undertook the business of reestablishing the dominance of his shōgunate. With his army, Yoshihisa besieged Rokkaku Takeyori in his castle with Kannonji-in, in the province of Ömi. The siege camp was based close to the village of Magari, where several sympathizers of the cause of the shōgunate joined them. In spite of the good progress made by his army, Yoshi"
