        "text": "Underlying Cause of Death 1999-2020\n\nSummary:\n\nThe Underlying Cause of Death data available on WONDER are county-level national mortality and population data spanning the years 1999-2020. Data are based on death certificates for U.S. residents. Each death certificate identifies a single underlying cause of death and demographic data. The number of deaths, crude death rates or age-adjusted death rates, and 95% confidence intervals and standard errors for death rates can be obtained by place of residence (total U.S., region, state and county), age group (single-year-of age, 5-year age groups, 10-year age groups and infant age groups), race, Hispanic ethnicity, gender, year, cause-of-death (4-digit ICD-10 code or group of codes), injury intent and injury mechanism, drug/alcohol induced causes and urbanization categories. Data are also available for place of death, month and week day of death, and whether an autopsy was performed.\n\nPrivacy policy: Statistics representing fewer than ten (one to nine) deaths or births are suppressed. Population figures are also suppressed when the population represents fewer than ten persons. Additional privacy constraints apply to infant mortality statistics for infant age groups and live births denominator population figures. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nMortality data:\n\nThe mortality data are based on information from all death certificates filed in the fifty states and the District of Columbia. Deaths of nonresidents (e.g. nonresident aliens, nationals living abroad, residents of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and other territories of the U.S.) and fetal deaths are excluded. Mortality data from the death certificates are coded by the states and provided to NCHS through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program or coded by NCHS from copies of the original death certificates provided to NCHS by the State registration offices. For more information, see Technical Appendix from Vital Statistics of United States: 1999 Mortality.\n\nAbout suppressed data and unreliable rates:\n\nStatistics representing fewer than ten persons (0-9) are suppressed. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nRates are marked as \"unreliable\" when the death count is less than 20.\n\nAbout cause of death classification:\n\nThe underlying cause-of-death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.\" Underlying cause-of-death is selected from the conditions entered by the physician on the cause of death section of the death certificate. When more than one cause or condition is entered by the physician, the underlying cause is determined by the sequence of conditions on the certificate, provisions of the ICD, and associated selection rules and modifications.\n\nCauses of death are classified in accordance with the International Classification of Disease. Deaths for 1979-98 are classified using the Ninth Revision (ICD-9). Deaths for 1999 and beyond are classified using the Tenth Revision (ICD-10).\n\nBeginning with data for 2006, the valid ICD-10 codes used to classify causes of death changed. Effective with the 2006 data year, 18 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 4 codes were discontinued. Effective with the 2007 data year, 4 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 2 codes were discontinued. See ICD-10 Changes for more information.\n\nBeginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories *U01-*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that they are not part of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Description of the specific 4-digit codes can be found at NCHS Classifications of Diseases, and Functioning & Disability: Appendix I. Deaths classified to the terrorism categories are included in the categories for Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm (suicide) in the 113 cause-of-death list. Additional information on these new categories can be found at NCHS Classifications of Diseases, and Functioning & Disability: Classification of Death and Injury Resulting from Terrorism.\n\nAbout race and ethnicity reporting:\n\nRace and Hispanic origin are reported separately on the death certificate in accordance with standards set forth by the Office of Management and Budget. The American Indian or Alaska Native race category includes: North, Central, and South American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts. The Asian or Pacific Islander race category includes Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian, Japanese, and Other Asian or Pacific Islanders.\n\nHispanic origin was not reported on the death certificate for some deaths. On the mortality file, missing Hispanic origin information is coded as \"not stated\". There is no corresponding population figure for this group. Therefore, deaths with Hispanic origin not stated are excluded when death rates are calculated by Hispanic origin.\n\nInformation included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. Studies have shown that persons self-reported as American Indian, Asian, or Hispanic on census and survey records may sometimes be reported as white or non-Hispanic on the death certificate, resulting in an underestimation of deaths and death rates for the American Indian, Asian, and Hispanic groups. Bias also results from undercounts of some population groups in the census, particularly young black males, young white males, and elderly persons, resulting in an overestimation of death rates. In \" Quality of death rates by race and Hispanic origin: A summary of current research, 1999,\" the authors estimate that the misclassification and under-coverage result in overstated death rates for the white and black populations (1% and 5%, respectively) and understated death rates for other population groups (American Indians, 21%; Asian or Pacific Islanders, 11%; and Hispanics, 2%). See also The validity of race and Hispanic Origin reporting on death certificates in the United States.\n\nFor 1979-2002, all 50 States and the District of Columbia collected race data on the death certificates using four single-race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and White) in accordance with the 1977 OMB standards, allowing only a single race to be reported. Beginning with the 2003 data year, some States began collecting race data in accordance with the 1997 OMB standards, allowing one or more of five race categories to be reported. In order to provide uniformity and comparability of mortality data during the transition from the single-race format to the multiple-race format, NCHS is \"bridging\" the race responses of those for whom more than one race is reported (multiple race) to one of the single-race categories. The bridging procedure is similar to the procedure used to bridge multiple-race population estimates. Multiple-race decedents are imputed to a single race (White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, or Asian or Pacific Islander) according to their combination of races, Hispanic origin, sex, and age indicated on the death certificate. The imputation procedure is described in detail at NCHS Procedures for Multiple-Race and Hispanic Origin Data.\n\nFor more discussion of race and ethnicity data, see Race and Ethnicity Questions.\n\nAbout \"Not Stated\" age or ethnicity:\n\nDeaths of persons with Age \"Not Stated\" are included in \"All\" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups, so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates.\n\nData for the \"Not Stated\" age category or the \"Not Stated\" Hispanic Origin category cannot be combined with any other specified age group or Hispanic Origin categories.\n\nDeath rates are not calculated specifically for the \"Not Stated\" groups because there are no corresponding population denominator data for these groups.\n\nPopulation data:\n\nThe population estimates are U.S. Census Bureau estimates of U.S. national, state, and county resident populations. The year 1999 population estimates are bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, based on the year 1990 and the year 2000 census counts. The year 2000 and year 2010 population estimates are April 1 modified census counts, with bridged-race categories. The 2001 - 2009 population estimates are bridged-race revised intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, based on the year 2000 and the year 2010 census counts (released by NCHS on 10/26/2012). The 2001 - 2009 archive population estimates are bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population. The 2011 - 2020 population estimates are bridged-race postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population. For more information, see Population Data Sources.\n\nNCHS live-birth data are included for \"Infant Age Groups\" so that infant mortality rates can be calculated. The number of live births and the population estimate for the \"under one year of age\" group differ slightly, thus death rates may differ slightly when compared. For more information, see Mortality for Infants.\n\nSource:\n\nThe Underlying Cause of Death data are produced by the Mortality Statistics Branch, Division of Vital Statistics, National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS).

For example, you could select to group (summarize, stratify, index) your data by State and by County.\n\nHow? See \"How do I organize my data?\" for more information.\n\nHints:\n\nAbout age-adjusted rates:\n\nWhen age-adjusted rates are calculated, you cannot group the data by Age Group.\n\nAbout charts:\n\nYou cannot make charts when your data has more than two By-Variables.\n\nAbout maps:\n\nTo make a map, you must request data with a geographic location variable, such as State or County, as a \"By-Variable.\" Then click the Map tab.\n\nDeath Counts\n\nThe death counts in the data represent deaths that occurred in the 50 United States and the district of Columbia, for the legal place of residence of the decedent. See Mortality data for more information.\n\nNotes: Death counts are suppressed for statistics representing zero to nine (0-9) deaths. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nCrude Rates\n\nCrude Rates are expressed as the number of deaths reported each calendar year per the factor you select. The default factor is per 100,000 population, reporting the death rate per 100,000 persons.\n\nCrude Rate = Count / Population * 100,000\n\nSee Frequently Asked Questions about Death Rates .\n\nHints:\n\nRates calculated with population estimates are per 100,000 persons by default. However, infant mortality rates are calculated per 1,000 live births by default. See Additional Rate Options to select the factor for rate calculations.\n\nSelect the precision for rate calculations in the Other Options section. When the rate calculated for a small numerator (incidence count) is zero, you may increase the precision to reveal the rate by showing more numbers to the right of the decimal point.\n\nNotes:\n\nRates for small populations should be interpreted with caution.\n\nRates are suppressed for statistics representing zero to nine (0-9) deaths. Corresponding denominator population figures are also suppressed when the population represents fewer than 10 persons. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nRates are marked as \"unreliable\" when the death count is less than 20.\n\nRates are marked as \"not applicable\" when the population denominator figure is unavailable, such as persons of \"not stated\" or unknown age or Hispanic origin. Rates and populations are also not available for specific categories for month and weekday of death, place of death, whether an autopsy was performed, or any subset of ages 85 and over.\n\nCrude rates are helpful in determining the need for services for a given population, relative to another population, regardless of size. Crude rates are influenced by the underlying age distribution of the state's population. Even if two states have the same age-adjusted rates, the state with the relatively older population (as demonstrated by having a higher median age) will have higher crude rates because incidence or death rates for most cancers increase with increasing age.\n\nThe population estimates for the denominators of incidence rates are race-specific and sex-specific population estimates. The population estimates are aggregated from the most detailed level selected. For example, if you have requested data for the nation grouped by state and by county, then the populations are the county-level population estimates aggregated to the state and national summaries. See Population Denominator Data Sources below for more information.\n\nThe population for \"Infant age groups\" is the number of live births in the given time period. See Infant Mortality for more information.\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates\n\nAge-adjusted death rates are weighted averages of the age-specific death rates, where the weights represent a fixed population by age. They are used to compare relative mortality risk among groups and over time. An age-adjusted rate represents the rate that would have existed had the age-specific rates of the particular year prevailed in a population whose age distribution was the same as that of the fixed population. Age-adjusted rates should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as direct or actual measures of mortality risk.\n\nThe year \"2000 U.S. standard\" is the default population selection for the calculation of age-adjusted rates. However, you can select other standard populations, or select specific population criteria to determine the age distribution ratios. See Frequently Asked Questions about Death Rates for more information.\n\nThe rates of almost all causes of death vary by age. Age adjustment is a technique for \"removing\" the effects of age from crude rates, so as to allow meaningful comparisons across populations with different underlying age structures. For example, comparing the crude rate of heart disease in Florida to that of California is misleading, because the relatively older population in Florida will lead to a higher crude death rate, even if the age-specific rates of heart disease in Florida and California are the same. For such a comparison, age-adjusted rates are preferable. Age-adjusted rates should be viewed as relative indexes rather than as direct or actual measures of mortality risk.\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) age-adjusts death rates using the direct method. That is, by applying age-specific death rates (Ri) to the U.S. standard population age distribution.\n\nR' = S i ( Psi / Ps ) R i\n\nwhere Psi is the standard population for age group i and Ps is the total U.S. standard population (all ages combined).\n\nIn the direct method, a standard age distribution is chosen and the age-specific death rates are weighted according to the standard. A reasonable choice for the standard is the U.S. total population (all races, both genders) for the year under study. To permit comparison of death rates from year to year, a standard population is used. Beginning with the 1999 data year, NCHS adopted the year 2000 projected population of the United States as the standard population. This new standard replaces the 1940 standard population that was used by NCHS for over 50 years. The new population standard affects the level of mortality and to some extent trends and group comparisons. Of particular note are the effects on race comparison of mortality. For detailed discussion, see:\n\nAnderson RN, Rosenberg HM. Age standardization of death rates: Implementation of the year 2000 standard. National Vital Statistics Reports; vol 47 no 3. Hyattsville, Maryland. National Center for Health Statistics. 1998.\n\nBeginning with publications of the year 2003 data, the traditional standard million population along with corresponding standard weights to six decimal places were replaced by the projected year 2000 population age distribution (see 2000 Standard Population below). The effect of the change is negligible and does not significantly affect comparability with age-adjusted rates calculated using the previous method.\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates Hints:\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates are optional; see Measures in Step 1 and Additional Rate Options .\n\nRates are calculated per 100,000 population by default. See Additional Rate Options to select the factor for rate calculations.\n\nSelect the precision for rate calculations in the Other Options section. You can also change precision in the Results tab, using Table Options. When the rate calculated for a small numerator (incidence count) is zero, you may increase the precision to reveal the rate by showing more numbers to the right of the decimal point.\n\nAge-adjusted rates cannot be calculated when the data are grouped by Age Group.\n\nAge-adjusted rates are not calculated when only one age group is selected (the effect is a ratio of one).\n\nAge-adjusted rates are not available for \"Infant age groups\" because the populations for these age groups are the number of live births in the given time period, the same population denominator for each infant age group.\n\nStandard age-adjusted rates (calculated with standard populations) are only available for Ten-Year Age Groups.\n\nNotes:\n\nRates are suppressed for statistics representing zero to nine (0-9) deaths in years 1999 and later. Corresponding denominator population figures are also suppressed when the population represents fewer than 10 persons. See Assurance of Confidentiality for more information.\n\nRates are marked as \"unreliable\" when the death count is less than 20.\n\nRates are marked as \"not applicable\" when the denominator population figure is unavailable, such as \"not stated\" or unknown age or ethnicity.\n\nDeaths of persons with \"not stated\" or unknown age are not included in the calculation of age-adjusted rates.\n\nAge-specific death rates are rounded to 1 decimal place, before the weights are applied for the age distributions in the standard population. This approach matches NCHS publications, yet may be more noticeable in the precision of rates calculated for small numbers of deaths.\n\nIf a \"non-standard\" population is selected for age-adjusted rates, then the actual population estimates for the specified year are used to determine the specific age-distribution ratios (or weights) used in the calculation.\n\nThe following standard populations (see tables below) are options for computing age-adjusted rates:\n\nyear 2000 Standard Population\n\nyear 2000 U.S. Standard Million Population\n\nyear 1970 U.S. Standard Million Population\n\nyear 1940 U.S. Standard Million Population\n\nWorld Standard Million (WHO 2000-2025)\n\nWorld Standard Million (Segi 1960)\n\nThe 2000 Standard Population is a projected population, developed before the April 1, 2000 enumerated Census occurred.

The method for confidence intervals calculated for 100 or more deaths differs slightly from the method for confidence intervals calculated for 99 or fewer deaths.\n\nHow? Click the check box to indicate the desired measure.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe method for confidence intervals calculated for 100 or more deaths:\n\nThe lower 95% confidence interval is the crude death rate minus (1.96 times the standard error of the rate). The upper 95% confidence interval is the crude death rate plus (1.96 times the standard error of the rate). LCI = R - 1.96 * S (R)\n\nUCI = R + 1.96 * S (R)\n\nThe method for confidence intervals calculated for 99 or fewer deaths:\n\nThe lower 95% confidence interval is the crude death multiplied by the lower 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths. The upper 95% confidence interval is the crude death rate multiplied by the upper 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths. See Vital Statistics of the United States: Mortality, 1999: Technical Appendix Table S. LCI = R * L (0.95, D)\n\nUCI = R * U (0.95, D)\n\nWhere:\n\nLCI = lower 95% confidence interval\n\nUCI = upper 95% confidence interval\n\nR = crude death rate R = (deaths / population) * 100,000\n\nD = the total number of deaths upon which the rate is based.\n\nRSE(R) = relative standard error of rate RSE(R) = 100 * square root of (1/D)\n\nS(R) = standard error of rate S(R) = R * (RSE(R) / 100)\n\nL = the lower 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths. See Vital Statistics of the United States: Mortality, 1999 Technical Appendix Table S.\n\nU = the upper 95% confidence limit factor for a death rate based on a Poisson variable of the number of deaths.

Click the check box to indicate the desired measure.\n\nNotes:\n\nS(R) = standard error of rate S(R) = R * (RSE(R)/100)\n\nWhere:\n\nR = crude death rate R = (deaths / population) * 100,000\n\nD = the total number of deaths upon which the rate is based.\n\nRSE(R) = relative standard error of rate RSE(R) = 100 * square root of (1/D)\n\nFor more information, refer to\n\nAge-adjusted Death Rates: Trend Data Based on the Year 2000 Standard Population\n\nVital Statistics of the United States: Mortality, 1999 Technical Appendix, see the \"Random Variation and Sampling Errors\" section for methods.\n\nAdditional Rate Options:\n\nClick the \"+\" to open this section. The options shown here vary, depending on the Measures you checked in section 1. Organize table layout on the Data Request tab. For example, to pick populations for weighting age-adjusted rates here, you must first check the box for age-adjusted rates in the Measures section.\n\nCalculate Rates Per: Select the factor (multiplier) for your rates. By default, all ages rates are calculated per 100,000 persons, and rates limited to infant age groups are calculated per 1,000 persons.\n\nHow? See How do I select items from the list box?\n\nArchive Rates: Check the box if you wish to reproduce archive rates and population figures from the preceding release of these data. See Comparison with Other Releases for more information.\n\nHow? See \"How do I use a checkbox?\"\n\nInclude age-adjusted rates? Crude rates are reported by default. Indicate that you wish to calculate age-adjusted rates by clicking the checkbox under Measures in section 1. Organize table layout on the Data Request tab. Then choose the standard population to use for the ratios in the calculation. For more information, see:\n\nAge-Adjusted Rates and\n\nFrequently Asked Questions about Death Rates.\n\nHow? See How do I use a radio button?\n\nNotes on Age-Adjusted Rates:\n\nGroup your data by any variable, except for Age Groups. You are prevented from grouping the data by age groups when requesting age-adjusted rates for mortality data, because any single age group alone yields a corresponding weight of 1.\n\nLikewise, you must select more than 1 age group when requesting age-adjusted rates for mortality data.\n\nDeaths coded to the \"unknown\" age groups do not yield a proportional weight, as there is no corresponding population value.\n\nSelect the combined age group for all persons less than 1 year of age. Age-adjusted rates are not available for deaths codes to the specific Infant Age Groups, because the representative population value for each infant age group is the (same) number of live births in selected time period.\n\nPopulations for Age-Adjusted Rates: If you picked standard age-adjusted rates, then the list of possible standard populations used to calculate these age-adjusted rates is shown. See Age-Adjusted Rates for more information.\n\nHow? See How do I select items from the list box?\n\nNote: The standard populations do not include representations of all age groups included in the mortality data. Your request criteria must combine data for the following ranges of ages: \"5 - 14 years\" combined and \"15 - 24 years\" combined.\n\nNon-standard Age-Adjusted Rates: If you picked non-standard age-adjusted rates, then options for selecting possible actual population criteria are shown. The actual population values for the specified year, race and location selections provide the age-specific proportional weights that calculate these age-adjusted rates. See Frequently Asked Questions about Death Rates for more information.\n\nHow?\n\nSee How do I select items from the list box?\n\nType the desired Location code value into the box, one code per line. Or leave the box empty for the entire US (national population). Any region, division, state or county code shown in the Finder at Step 2 is valid.\n\nNote: If the same population is picked for your query criteria and your non-standard age-adjusted rate calculations, then the crude rates and age-adjusted rates are identical for those data rows that represent the non-standard population denominator.\n\nStep 2.

This standard set of codes provides names and codes for counties and county equivalents of the 50 States of the United States and the District of Columbia. Counties are considered to be the \"first order subdivisions\" of each State, regardless of their local designation (county, parish, borough, census area). Washington, D.C.; the consolidated government of Columbus City, Georgia; the independent cities of the States of Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, and Virginia; and the census areas and boroughs of Alaska are identified as county equivalents. The system is standard throughout the Federal Government. The State codes are ascending, two-digit numbers; the county codes are ascending three-digit numbers. For both the State and county codes, space has been left for new States or counties. Some changes in the FIPS codes have occurred since 1968. See Location Updates for information on how these changes affect the data.\n\nAbout County Changes: Comparable total deaths and death rates may be misleading for counties with changing boundaries. See Location Updates for information on how these changes affect the data. Due to boundary changes, data are available for some counties for a limited period of time. The following county-level constraints apply to the Underlying Cause of Death data:\n\nAlaska:\n\nDenali, Alaska (FIPS code 02068) only has data for year 2003 and later. Counts and rates shown in multi-year requests show only two years of data for this entity.\n\nYukon-Koyukuk, Alaska (FIPS code 02290) - changes in deaths and population counts between 2002 - 2003. Beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for a former part of Yukon-Koyukuk are reported for Denali Borough and are no longer included with data for Yukon-Koyukuk.\n\nColorado:\n\nAdams, Colorado (FIPS code 08001) - changes in deaths and population counts between 2002 - 2003. Beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for a former part of Adams county are reported for Broomfield county, and are no longer included with data for Adams county.\n\nBoulder, Colorado (FIPS code 08003) - changes in deaths and population counts between 2002 - 2003. Beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for a former part of Boulder county are reported for Broomfield county, and are no longer included with data for Boulder county.\n\nBroomfield, Colorado (FIPS code 08014) only has data for year 2003 and later. Counts and rates shown in multi-year requests show only two years of data for this entity.\n\nJefferson, Colorado (FIPS code 08059) - changes in deaths and population counts between 2002 - 2003. Beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for a former part of Jefferson county are reported for Broomfield county, and are no longer included with data for Jefferson county.\n\nWeld, Colorado (FIPS code 080123) - changes in deaths and population counts between 2002 - 2003. Beginning in 2003, deaths and population counts for a former part of Weld county are reported for Broomfield county, and are no longer included with data for Weld county.\n\nVirginia:\n\nAlleghany, Virginia (FIPS code 51005) - changes in deaths and population counts between 2000 - 2001. Beginning in 2001, deaths and population counts for death counts and population estimates for Clifton Forge city, Virginia have been combined with Alleghany county.\n\nClifton Forge city, Virginia (FIPS code 51560) has data for years 1999 - 2000 only. Counts and rates shown in multi-year requests show only two years of data for this entity.\n\nUrbanization\n\nUse the radio buttons to select either the 2006 or the 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Scheme for Counties. Select All Categories or any combination of values: Large Central Metro, Large Fringe Metro, Medium Metro, Small Metro, Micropolitan (non-metro), NonCore (non-metro). Each county is classified as one of six categories. Each death is associated with a category based on the county of the person's legal residence.\n\nHow?\n\nClick the Radio Button above the box, to pick your preferred list.\n\nSee \"How do I select items from the list box?,\" to limit your data to selected categories in the list.\n\nNotes:\n\nThese categories are from the 2006 or 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties.\n\nSee the NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties web page for more information about the Urbanization categories.\n\nThe large central metro category contains counties in metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) of one million or more population that have been identified by NCHS classification rules as central because they contain all or part of a principal city of the area. The large fringe metro category contains the remaining counties (similar to suburbs) in MSAs of one million or more. Counties in MSAs of 250,000 to 999,999 population are assigned to the medium metro category and counties in MSAs with populations under 250,000 are assigned to the small metro category. Nonmetropolitan counties that are designated by the Office of Management and Budget as belonging to a micropolitan statistical area are assigned to the micropolitan category and the remaining nonmetropolitan counties are assigned to the noncore category. The large central metro category is the most \"urban\" category and the noncore category is the most \"rural\" category.\n\nTo understand how the classification schemes were developed, see:\n\nNCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties\n\n2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties\n\nMost counties are in the same urbanization category for both the 2013 and 2006 schemes. However, for those counties whose category differs in the two schemes, some moved from a less urban to a more urban category, while others moved from a more urban category to a less urban category. For more information, see \"Changes in county urbanization category: 2013 scheme versus 2006 scheme\" in the report, 2013 NCHS Urban-Rural Classification Scheme for Counties.\n\nIt is recommended that the micropolitan category not be aggregated with metropolitan categories.\n\nThe Urbanization categories are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nStep 3. Select demographics:\n\nLimit your data for any of the following data elements:\n\nAge Groups - 10 year age groups, 5 year age groups, single-year ages, infant age groups\n\nGender - All, Female, Male\n\nRace - All, Black / African American, Other Races Combined, White\n\nHispanic Origin - All, Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino, Not stated\n\nAge Groups: 10-Year Age Groups, 5-Year Age Groups, Single-Year Ages, Infant Age Groups\n\nFirst click the round radio button to show the preferred list of age groups. Then select All Ages or any combination of the individual age groups in the list box.\n\nHow?\n\nSee \"How do I use a radio button?.\"\n\nSee \"How do I select items from the list box?\"\n\nNotes:\n\nNote that the population for the infant age groups is the number of live births in the given time period. Thus each infant age group population shows the total number of live births in that period of years. For more information about infant age groups, see Mortality for Infants .\n\nThe population for the other age groups is the population estimate for each age group in the given time period. The population estimates for each year are summed together. For example, if data are requested for the age group \"15 - 19 years\" in the years 2000-2001, then the population estimate for this age group in the year 2000 is added to the population estimate for this age group in the year 2001. The combined population estimates for the time period are the denominator for the death rates.\n\nDeaths of persons with \"Unknown\" or \"Not Stated\" age are included in \"All\" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups, so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. See About \"Not Stated\" age or ethnicity for more information.\n\nRefer to Age-Adjusted Rates for a discussion on the use of age-groups in calculating age-adjusted rates. Note that some of the age groups available in the data are not available in the standard population tables used to calculate age-adjusted rates. Deaths of persons of \"Not stated\" age are not included in age-adjusted rate calculations. Also, age-adjusted rates are not available for infant age groups.\n\nRates and Populations are reported as \"Not Applicable\" for any subset of ages 85 and over, because population estimates are not available for those ages.\n\nErratum: Between July 21, 2014 and August 8, 2014, the number of deaths by Single Year of Age reported in CDC WONDER in the year 2011 were inaccurate for the following categories: \"< 1 year\" and \"Not Stated.\" We regret this error and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nThe age groups are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nThe following age groups are available:\n\nGender\n\nSelect All Genders or any combination of other values: female, male.\n\nRace\n\nSelect All Races or select any combination of other values: American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian / Pacific Islander, Black or African American, White.\n\nHow?

Select weekday, autopsy and place of death:\n\nLimit your data for any of the following data elements:\n\nWeekday of death: - Sunday through Saturday, Unknown\n\nAutopsy performed: - No, Yes, Unknown\n\nPlace of Death: - Medical Facility - Inpatient, Medical Facility - Outpatient or ER, Medical Facility - Dead on Arrival, Medical Facility - Status unknown (years 1999-2002 only) Decedent's home, Hospice Facility (years 2003 and later only), Nursing home/long term care, Other, Place of death unknown\n\nNote that rates and populations are shown as \"Not Applicable\" for Weekday, Autopsy and Place of Death.\n\nStep 6. Select underlying cause of death:\n\nSelect categories that represent the underlying cause of death from the death certificate. Only one underlying cause of death is indicated for each death. Deaths are coded to the International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes. The ICD system is organized by chapters, sub-chapters and codes. Selected causes are also grouped into categories for mortality analysis. Any number of causes can be specified here. However, you can only limit data to one of the lists for any single query. Be sure the Radio Button is set to your choice. Pick between:\n\nICD-10 Codes listed as chapters, sub-chapters and individual codes\n\nICD-10 113 Groups for selected causes of death\n\nICD-10 130 Groups for selected causes of infant mortality\n\nDrug/Alcohol Induced Causes\n\nInjury Intent and Mechanism\n\nHints:\n\nOnly those ICD codes and causes that are used to classify underlying causes of death in the mortality data are available in the Finder for this section. Symptoms are not classified as underlying causes of death.\n\nDeaths in the years 1999 and later are coded to the tenth revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). There are 113 selected causes of death groups for the ICD-10 codes.\n\nWhen you select a code, remember that some deaths are coded to the 3 length code, and not the more detailed designation. Thus some deaths may be excluded from your data selection if your criteria are limited to only 4 length codes. For example, the ICD-10 code A09 is the correct specification; A09.0 will not pick up deaths coded A09.\n\nThe causes of death are identified by two columns, labels and codes, in data extracts.\n\nNotes:\n\nAbout the International Classification of Diseases:\n\nThe mortality data are compiled in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) regulations, which specify that member nations classify and code causes of death in accordance with the current revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD). The International Classification of Diseases is developed collaboratively between the World Health Organization (WHO) and 10 international centers, for purposes of ensuring that medical terms reported on death certificates are internationally comparable and lend themselves to statistical analysis. The ICD has been revised approximately every 10 years since 1900 in order to reflect changes in understanding of disease mechanisms and in disease terminology.\n\nSee also ICD 10th revision notes.\n\nICD-10 Codes\n\nLimit the data to any number of causes of death, for selected chapters, sub-chapters or codes. The default selection is \"all causes\" of death.\n\nHow?\n\nClick the Radio Button to the left of the box, to pick your preferred list.\n\nSelect one or more items from the list to limit your data. The default value for any list is all causes of death.\n\nHints:\n\nSee How do use a Finder? to learn more about search options, expanding or collapsing selected items, and displaying details for selected items in the Finder.\n\nThe \"plus\" symbol, \"+\" indicates that you can open the item, to see more items below it.\n\nThe results to a search are shown in blue, and indicated by \">\".\n\nThe Advanced mode let you easily pick several items from different parts of the list. Items are not selected until you click the \"Move\" button in Advanced mode.\n\nYou may also enter values by hand, one code per line, in the Advanced mode. Use the Finder to see the correct code format. For example, \"I20-I25\" is the ICD-10 code for ischemic heart diseases.\n\nSee Finder Tool help for more hints.\n\nNotes:\n\nThe International Classification of Disease (ICD) 10th revision is used to represent the causes of death for the years 1999 and later. The ICD system is organized by chapters, sub-chapters and codes.\n\nICD-10 uses a 4-length alphanumeric coding scheme. Each of the 21 chapters in ICD-10 is classified to a letter or letters of the alphabet. Infectious disease codes in Chapter 1, for example, begin with an \"A\" or \"B\". Thus, Acute poliomyelitis is associated with the codes A80.0-A80.9 and Viral hepatitis is classified as B15.0-B19.9. The ICD 10 system begins codes with a letter from the alphabet, followed by two numerals, then a decimal point to indicate subordinate position, and then more numerals. Some causes of death are represented by 3 length codes, although most causes of death are represented by 4 length codes (format A12.3). Greater detail than 4 length codes are not included in the data.\n\nAbout Underlying Cause of Death:\n\nThe underlying cause-of-death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.\" Underlying cause-of-death is selected from the conditions entered by the physician on the cause of death section of the death certificate. When more than one cause or condition is entered by the physician, the underlying cause is determined by the sequence of conditions on the certificate, provisions of the ICD, and associated selection rules and modifications.\n\nEach death certificate contains a single underlying cause of death.\n\nOnly those ICD codes that are used to classify underlying causes of death in the mortality data are available in the Finder for selecting underlying causes of death. Symptoms are not classified as underlying causes of death.\n\nAbout changes in ICD-10 codes:\n\nThe valid ICD-10 codes used to classify cause of death change over time, refer to table below for details. Effective with the 2020 data year, 1 code was introduced as a valid cause of death. Effective with the 2019 data year, 1 code was introduced as a valid cause of death. Effective with the 2011 data year, 33 codes were introduced as valid causes of death. Effective with the 2009 data year, 5 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 11 codes were discontinued. Effective with the 2007 data year, 4 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 2 codes were discontinued. Effective with the 2006 data year, 18 codes were introduced as valid causes of death, and 4 codes were discontinued. The World Health Organization (WHO) added code I27.2 in 2003. Prior to 2003, if the certifier listed \"secondary pulmonary hypertension\" the condition would be coded I27.0 because there was no code for secondary pulmonary hypertension. After code I27.2 was added in 2003, the number of deaths coded to I27.0 dropped significantly.\n\nNew causes of death in 2020 ICD-10 Code Title U07.1 COVID-19 New causes of death in 2019 ICD-10 Code Title U07.0 Vaping related disorder New causes of death in 2011 ICD-10 Code Title B17.9 Acute viral hepatitis, unspecified D68.5 Primary thrombophilia D68.6 Other thrombophilia D89.3 Immune reconstitution syndrome E88.3 Tumor lysis syndrome G14 Postpolio syndrome G21.4 Vascular parkinsonism H54.9 Unspecified visual impairment (binocular) I72.5 Aneurysm and dissection of other precerebral arteries J12.3 Human metapneumovirus pneumonia J21.1 Acute bronchiolitis due to human metapneumovirus K12.3 Oral mucositis (ulcerative) K35.2 Acute appendicitis with generalized peritonitis K35.3 Acute appendicitis with localized peritonitis K35.8 Acute appendicitis, other and unspecified L89.0 Stage I decubitus ulcer and pressure area L89.1 Stage II decubitus ulcer L89.2 Stage III decubitus ulcer L89.3 Stage IV decubitus ulcer L89.9 Decubitus ulcer and pressure area, unspecified N18.1 Chronic kidney disease, stage 1 N18.2 Chronic kidney disease, stage 2 N18.3 Chronic kidney disease, stage 3 N18.4 Chronic kidney disease, stage 4 N18.5 Chronic kidney disease, stage 5 N42.3 Dysplasia of prostate O14.2 HELLP syndrome O43.2 Morbidly adherent placenta O96.0 Death from direct obstetric cause occurring more than 42 days but less than one year after delivery O96.1 Death from indirect obstetric cause occurring more than 42 days but less than one year after delivery O96.9 Death from unspecified obstetric cause occurring more than 42 days but less than one year after delivery O97.0 Death from sequelae of direct obstetric cause O97.1 Death from sequelae of indirect obstetric cause O97.9 Death from sequelae of obstetric cause, unspecified O98.7 Human immunodeficiency [HIV] disease complicating pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium X34.0 Victim of cataclysmic earth movements caused by earthquake X34.1 Victim of tsunami X34.8 Victim of other specified effects of earthquake X34.9 Victim of unspecified effect of earthquake New causes of death in 2009 ICD-10 Code Title A09.0 Other and unspecified gastroenteritis and colitis of infectious origin A09.9 Gastroenteritis and colitis of unspecified origin K52.3 Indeterminate colitis R26.3 Immobility R63.6 Insufficient intake of food and water due to self neglect New causes of death in 2007 ICD-10 Code Title J09 Influenza due to identified avian influenza virus U04.9 Severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS], unspecified X59.0 Exposure to unspecified factor causing fracture X59.9 Exposure to unspecified factor causing other and unspecified injury New causes of death in 2006 ICD-10 Code Title B33.4 Hantavirus (cardio)-pulmonary syndrome [HPS][HCPS] G90.4 Autonomic dysreflexia I15.0 Renovascular hypertension I15.9 Secondary hypertension, unspecified K22.7 Barrett's esophagus K85.0 Idiopathic acute pancreatitis K85.1 Biliary acute pancreatitis K85.2 Alcohol-induced acute pancreatitis K85.3 Drug-induced acute pancreatitis K85.8 Other acute pancreatitis K85.9 Acute pancreatitis, unspecified M31.7 Microscopic polyangiitis M79.7 Fibromyalgia P91.6 Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy of newborn R29.6 Tendency to fall, not elsewhere classified R50.2 Drug-induced fever R50.8 Other specified fever W46 Contact with hypodermic needle New causes of death in 2003 ICD-10 Code Title I27.2 Other secondary pulmonary hypertension\n\nDiscontinued causes of death in 2009 ICD-10 Code Title A09 Diarrhea and gastroenteritis of infectious origin F11.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of opioids, acute intoxication F12.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of cannabinoids, acute intoxication F13.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of sedatives or hypnotics, acute intoxication F14.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of cocaine, acute intoxication F15.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of other stimulants, including caffeine, acute intoxication F16.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of hallucinogens, acute intoxication F17.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of tobacco, acute intoxication F18.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of volatile solvents, acute intoxication F19.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple drug use and use of other psychoactive substances, acute intoxication K51.1 Ulcerative (chronic) ileocolitis\n\nDiscontinued causes of death in 2007 ICD-10 Code Title F10.0 Mental and behavioral disorders due to use of alcohol, acute intoxication X59 Exposure to unspecified factor\n\nDiscontinued causes of death in 2006 ICD-10 Code Title I25.2 Old myocardial infarction K85 Acute pancreatitis R50.0 Fever with chills R50.1 Persistent fever\n\nAbout ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99:\n\nBetween 2003 and 2017, states were incrementally implementing a pregnancy status checkbox which affected the comparability of data between states. In addition, evaluation of data quality indicated errors following adoption of the checkbox. Beginning with 2018 data, after all states had implemented a checkbox, NCHS restricted use of the checkbox to decedents aged 10-44 years to mitigate probable errors. For more information, please refer to Maternal Mortality Statistics for 2018 at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/.\n\nAbout deaths due to acts of terrorism:\n\nBeginning with data for 2001, NCHS introduced categories *U01-*U03 for classifying and coding deaths due to acts of terrorism. The asterisks before the category codes indicate that they are not part of the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Description of the specific 4-digit codes can be found at NCHS Classifications of Diseases, Functioning and Disability: Appendix I. Deaths classified to the terrorism categories are included in the categories for Assault (homicide) and Intentional self-harm (suicide) in the 113 cause-of-death list. Additional information on these new categories can be found at NCHS Classifications of Diseases, Functioning and Disability: Classification of Death and Injury Resulting from Terrorism. Terrorism related deaths in this data do not represent a final count of deaths resulting from the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, as this figure had not been determined. As of October 24, 2002, death certificates were issued for 2,957 of the estimated 3,028 individuals believed to have died as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Of these, four were issued for terrorists and are classified as suicides. The criteria for issuing a death certificate for those believed to have died in the attacks differed by state, reflecting differences in state laws regarding death certification. Pennsylvania issued a death certificate for every individual, including the terrorists. Death certificates were not issued for any of the terrorists in Virginia or New York City. Virginia issued a death certificate only for those victims whose remains were identified. New York City issued a death certificate for those whose remains were identified or, if remains were not recovered, for those whose families applied for a death certificate. For more detailed information regarding New York City's processing of these deaths, see Deaths in World Trade Center Terrorist Attacks---New York City, 2001.\n\nICD-10 113 Cause List - 113 Selected Causes of Death\n\nLimit the data to any number of groups of selected causes of death.\n\nHow?\n\nClick the Radio Button to pick your preferred list.\n\nSelect one or more items from the list to limit your data.

See \"How do I select items from the list box?\"\n\nData Source Information\n\nMortality Data Sources: The Underlying Cause of Death data are produced by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Mortality information is collected by state registries and provided to the National Vital Statistics System. Underlying cause of death and demographic descriptors are indicated on the death certificates. Each death certificate contains a single underlying cause of death, up to twenty additional multiple causes, and demographic data. The underlying cause-of-death is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"the disease or injury which initiated the train of events leading directly to death, or the circumstances of the accident or violence which produced the fatal injury.\" Underlying cause-of-death is selected from the conditions entered by the physician on the cause of death section of the death certificate. When more than one cause or condition is entered by the physician, the underlying cause is determined by the sequence of conditions on the certificate, provisions of the International Classification of Diseases, and associated selection rules and modifications.\n\nTo learn more about the methods and source of these data please reference:\n\nNational Center for Health Statistics: (NCHS) Multiple Cause of Death data web site\n\nNational Vital Statistics System: Mortality web site\n\nSee also Data Source Citations\n\nPopulation Denominator Data Sources: The population estimates are bridged-race estimates based on Bureau of the Census estimates of total U.S., State, and county resident populations. The 1999 population estimates are intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, based on the year 1999 and year 2000 census counts. The year 2000 and year 2010 populations are April 1 modified census counts. The 2001 through 2009 population estimates are revised intercensal estimates of the July 1 resident population, based on the year 2000 and year 2010 census counts (released by NCHS on 10/26/2012). The archive population estimates for years 2001 - 2009 are postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population. The 2011 - 2020 population estimates are postcensal estimates of the July 1 resident population. Note that these estimates are based on bridged-race categories. The population estimates are by geographic unit (total United States, State, and county), year, race (white, black, other races), sex, and age group (13 age groups).

Caution should be used in interpreting these data. For more information, see Deaths: Final Data for 2008.\n\nAbout New Jersey reporting anomalies in 2009: Circumstances in New Jersey for the year 2009 have resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, \"Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\" and therefore unusually low death counts in other ICD-10 codes, most notably R95, \"Sudden Infant Death Syndrome\" and X40-X49, \"Unintentional poisoning.\" Caution should be used in interpreting these data. For more information, see Deaths: Final Data for 2009.\n\nAbout Allen Parish, Louisiana reporting anomalies in 2006-2008: Deaths for Allen Parish, Louisiana (FIPS code 22003] in years 2006 through 2008 are under reported due to problems with registering the deaths with the Louisiana Vital Statistics Office.\n\nAbout California reporting anomalies in 2000 - 2001: Circumstances in California resulted in unusually high death counts for the ICD-10 cause of death code R99, \"Other ill-defined and unspecified causes of mortality\" for deaths occurring in years 2000 and 2001. Caution should be used in interpreting these data.\n\nAbout cause of death classification changes:\n\nChanges to cause of death classification affect reporting trends. For more information, see Changes in ICD-10 codes.\n\nSee also About ICD-10 codes O00-O99 for reporting issues affecting maternal mortality statistics.\n\nDemographic reporting:\n\nDeaths of persons with Age \"Not Stated\" are included in \"All\" counts and rates, but are not distributed among age groups, so are not included in age-specific counts, age-specific rates or in any age-adjusted rates. For more information, see Not Stated Age or Ethnicity.\n\nInformation included on the death certificate about the race and Hispanic ethnicity of the decedent is reported by the funeral director as provided by an informant, often the surviving next of kin, or, in the absence of an informant, on the basis of observation. Race and ethnicity information from the census is by self-report. To the extent that race and Hispanic origin are inconsistent between these two data sources, death rates will be biased. For more information, see Race and Ethnicity Reporting.\n\nRevisions and errata:\n\nAbout revised 2019 deaths: On March 11, 2021, the 2019 mortality data on CDC WONDER was updated with the 2019 mortality data updated by NCHS on March 4, 2021 to include corrected information for residents of Texas affecting 5 records previously coded to cause code *U01.4, Terrorism involving firearms (homicide). The underlying and multiple cause of death codes for 5 records were corrected in the 2019 data. Underlying and multiple cause of death codes for those 5 records were recoded to Assault (homicide) by other and unspecified firearm discharge, ICD-10 code X95. The corrected final death records replaces the data released on December 22, 2020.\n\nAbout revised 2014 deaths: A revised data file for 2014 was released on April 3, 2017 to include corrections affecting 125 deaths previously coded to \"Accidental discharge of firearms\" (ICD-10 codes W32-W34). This corrected file replaced the file released on December 9, 2015. The underlying cause of death changed for 125 deaths in 2014 that occurred in Tennessee (80%) and Massachusetts (20%). (Note: Data by state of residence are also impacted in Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, North Carolina and Virginia for records where the death occurred in Tennessee or Massachusetts but the decedent was a resident of another state.) Prior to the revision, the underlying cause of death for all 125 deaths were classified as \"Accidental discharge of firearms\" (ICD-10 codes W32-W34). After the revision, 50% of the changed records are now classified as \"Assault (homicide) by discharge of firearms\" (ICD-10 codes *U01.4, X93-X95); 42% are now classified as \"Intentional self-harm (suicide) by discharge of firearms (ICD-10 codes X72-X74); 4% of the revised death records are now classified as \"Discharge of firearms, undetermined intent\" (ICD-10 codes Y22-Y24); and the remaining 4% to various other causes. For more information, please refer to Deaths: Final Data for 2014.\n\nAbout Clostridium difficile (A04.7) deaths: Between October 22, 2013 and April 10, 2020, the number of deaths with the underlying cause of death classified as ICD-10 code A04.7 for \"Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile\" reported in CDC WONDER was inaccurately doubled, when the query did not group results by the 113 Cause List and both of the following categories were specifically selected in 113 Cause List: \"Certain other intestinal infections (A04,A07-A09)\" and \"#Enterocolitis due to Clostridium difficile (A04.7).\" We regret this error and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nSingle Year of Age: Between July 21, 2014 and August 8, 2014, the number of deaths by Single Year of Age reported in CDC WONDER in the year 2011 were inaccurate for the following categories: \"< 1 year\" and \"Not Stated.\" We regret this error and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nWeekday of Death: Between December 15, 2011 and March 13, 2012, the number of deaths by Weekday of Death reported in CDC WONDER for the year 2003 were inaccurate for the following states: California, Idaho, Montana and New York. We regret this error and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nPlace of Death: Between December 15, 2011 and February 22, 2012, the number of deaths by Place of Death reported in CDC WONDER in the years 1999-2002 were inaccurate for the following categories: Decedent's home, Hospice Facility, and Nursing home/long term care. We regret this error and apologize for any inconvenience.\n\nTwo counties in Connecticut in year 2000: County of residence is misidentified in 316 deaths that occurred in the year 2000, for Hartford County, CT (FIPS code 09003) and New London County, CT (FIPS code 09011). Data for the aggregate state of Connecticut for deaths occurring in year 2000 are correct, as well as data for the aggregate of the 2 counties combined. This discrepancy affects the Detailed Mortality (Underlying cause of Death) and the Multiple Cause of Death online databases in CDC WONDER, as well as the all-county Multiple Cause of Death data set for year 2000. However, the Compressed Mortality data set correctly identifies the county of residence for the 316 deaths in year 2000 in Connecticut.\n\nPopulation Estimates\n\nReference the following topics to learn more about population denominators for rate calculation:\n\nPopulation Information\n\n1999 Population Estimates\n\n2000 Population\n\n2001 - 2009 Population Estimates\n\n2010 Population\n\n2011 Population\n\n2012 Population\n\n2013 Population\n\n2014 Population\n\n2015 Population\n\n2016 Population\n\n2017 Population\n\n2018 Population\n\n2019 Population\n\n2020 Population\n\nArchive 2001 - 2009 Population Estimates\n\nPopulation migration due to hurricanes in 2005\n\nComparison with other releases\n\nPopulation Information\n\nThe population data are bridged-race estimates derived from U.S. Census Bureau files. The population estimates for the year 1999 are intercensal estimates of the July 1, resident population, estimates based on both the year 1990 and year 2000 census counts. The population estimates for the Census years 2000 and 2010 are April 1, modified census counts. The population estimates for the years 2001 through 2009 are revised intercensal estimates of the July 1, resident population, estimates based on both the year 2000 and year 2010 census counts (released by NCHS on 10/26/12). The population estimates for the years 2011 - 2014 are postcensal estimates of the July 1, resident population.\n\nNote: The archive population estimates for the non-Census years 2001 through 2009 are postcensal estimates of the July 1, resident population.\n\nThe following modifications of the Census population estimates were made by NCHS:\n\nTo permit the calculation of infant mortality rates, NCHS live-birth data are included for \"Infant age Groups.\" The race code for these records is derived from \"race of mother\".\n\nWhen the age group 1-4 years did not appear on the Census file, the age group 0-4 years was multiplied by 0.8 to obtain an estimate of the population 1-4 years.\n\nSpecific Details\n\n1999 Population Estimates\n\nThe population estimates for 1999 are county-level U.S. Census Bureau bridged-race intercensal estimates of the July 1, resident population, based on the 1990 census and the bridged-race 2000 census. Derivation of the race-specific intercensal population estimates for the 1990s was complicated by the incomparability of the race data on the 1990 and 2000 censuses. Before the intercensal estimates for the 1990s could be derived, the race groups on the 2000 census had to be made consistent with (\"bridged to\") the race groups on the 1990 census. Race data on the 2000 Census were collected in accordance with the 1997 Office of Management and Budget's standards on race and ethnicity. The 1997 standards specify 5 single-race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, and White) and permit the reporting of more than one race. As a result, there were 31 race groups on the 2000 census (5 single-race groups and 26 multiple-race groups). NCHS, in collaboration with the Census Bureau, developed methodology for bridging the multiple-race groups to single-race categories (American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, and White). The 1990 census race groups are White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander.\n\n2000 Population Estimates\n\nNational, state, and county population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau April 1, bridged modified race 2000 Census counts. The original census counts were modified by the U.S. Census Bureau to assign persons who reported their race as \"other \" to one of the 31 single or multiple-race groups specified in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 1997 Standards on Race and Ethnicity. The resulting counts were then bridged to (made consistent with) the four single-race categories on the 1990 Census (White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander).\n\n2001 - 2009 Population Estimates\n\nThe current population estimates for years 2001 through 2009 are July 1 resident population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's bridged-race revised intercensal series (released by NCHS on 10/26/12). The bridged-race population files have estimates for the four single-race categories (White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander). The revised intercensal July 1st population estimates for years 2001-2009 takes into account both the year 2000 and the year 2010 April 1st Census counts.\n\nThe national, region, division, and state estimates were obtained by summing the county estimates, so the region, division, state and county estimates are consistent with each other within a given year. The population estimates correspond to the revised intercensal series (released by NCHS on 10/26/12) that was used to produce the trends tables, when NCHS published the \"Final Report\" for deaths in year 2010.\n\n2010 Population Estimates\n\nNational, state, and county population estimates are from the U.S. Census Bureau April 1, bridged modified race 2010 Census counts. The original census counts were modified by the U.S. Census Bureau to assign persons who reported their race as \"other \" to one of the 31 single or multiple-race groups specified in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) 1997 Standards on Race and Ethnicity. The resulting counts were then bridged to (made consistent with) the four single-race categories on the 1990 Census (White, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, and Asian or Pacific Islander).\n\n2011 Population Estimates\n\nNational, state, and county population estimates are July 1 resident population estimates from the Vintage 2011 bridged-race postcensal series (released by NCHS on 7/18/2012).
