        "text": "BACKGROUND\n\nIn 2019, 486 Americans died from unintentional firearm injuries — about 1.2% of total gun deaths.9\n\nUnintentional is the description used in public health for an injury or death that was not caused purposely (in contrast with suicide and homicide, in which there is an intent to cause harm). Unintentional shootings can be self-inflicted or inflicted by someone else. About half of all unintentional gun deaths are caused by another person pulling the trigger.10 Each year, nearly 500 people die from unintentional firearm injuries — more than one person every single day.9\n\nMuch like other forms of gun violence, unintentional gun deaths are more likely to occur in the United States than in other high-income countries. Americans are four times more likely to die from an unintentional gun injury than those in comparable countries.11\n\nThe CDC Plays a Vital Role in Providing Public Health Data to Researchers\n\nResearchers need robust and reliable data on unintentional gun injuries and fatalities to study and develop solutions to address the epidemic of gun violence in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the federal agency responsible for protecting the health of Americans by ensuring that data is properly collected to develop solutions to our nation’s public health crises, including gun violence. The CDC’s National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) plays an instrumental role to gun violence prevention advocates and researchers. The NVDRS uses death certificates, police reports, and hospital records to report information about the victim, the cause of death, and the circumstances surrounding their death.12 The CDC makes this data publicly available and easily accessible through their Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS).\n\nMisclassification of Unintentional Gun Injuries and Deaths\n\nAlthough the CDC releases data on firearm injuries and deaths in the U.S., the data, especially related to firearm injuries, is not reliable. As a result of a lack of a robust and reliable data source, there are often misclassifications for firearm injuries and deaths. Due to these misclassifications and underreporting of gun injuries and deaths, we do not know the true burden of unintentional firearm injuries and deaths in the U.S.\n\nAccording to a 2017 study, over half (50.2%) of all nonfatal gun injuries are assaults and over one-third (36.7%) are unintentional injuries. However, the unintentional category may be overreported because those with gun injuries may not admit that they were assaulted to either avoid law enforcement scrutiny or out of fear of retaliation.13\n\nData problems exist for fatal injuries, too. A 2011 study found that “As much as 38% of true cases of unintentional firearm deaths were missed, as were 42% of cases reported as false-positives.”14 The study authors write, “In answer to the question, ‘Are there too many or too few unintentional firearm deaths in official mortality data?’ the best answer is, ‘Both.’ Many true accidents are missed, while many suicides and homicides are mistakenly reported as accidents.”\n\nThere is a critical need for accurate data on the burden of gun violence in the United States.\n\nCircumstances in which unintentional shootings can happen\n\nOne study found that, across all ages, the most common circumstances in which an unintentional gun death occurs are:15\n\nPlaying with a gun (28.3%),\n\nBelieving that the gun was not loaded (17.2%), and\n\nHunting (13.8%).\n\nThis study also found that nearly a quarter of those who died from an unintentional firearm injury — and nearly half of all 20-29-year-olds who died from unintentional shootings — had consumed alcohol.16\n\nPreventing Unintentional Shootings\n\nSafer Storage of Firearms\n\nEvidence shows that parents of adolescents — the most at-risk group in terms of unintentional firearm deaths — were more likely than parents of younger children to keep guns in the home stored unsafely (unlocked, loaded, or both).25\n\nIf a person chooses to store their firearm in the home, it is important to always practice safe firearm storage. For at-home firearm storage, it is widely recommended to store firearms locked and unloaded, store and lock ammunition separately from firearms, and ensure the key or lock combination is inaccessible to children or others who may be at risk for injury.\n\nSafely storing and reducing access to firearms for the gun owner and other individuals, especially children, in the home is an unintentional injury prevention strategy supported by researchers, healthcare professionals, and gun owners alike. While there is no safer storage law at the federal level, various safer storage laws exist at the state level.26\n\nHealthcare providers can also play a role in preventing unintentional firearm injuries by improving their patients’ safer storage practices through lethal means safety counseling. Studies show that healthcare providers influencing patients’ gun storage practices can substantially lower the risk of firearm-related injury.27 For example, researchers found that for every five gun-owning parents whose child’s pediatrician gave them lethal means safety counseling and free cable locks, two parents reported using the cable locks six months later.28 In addition to parents, lethal means safety counseling should be given to individuals who have risk factors for unintentional firearm injury, including people with risky alcohol or substance use and individuals with dementia or conditions impairing cognition and judgment.\n\nTo learn more, visit our page on lethal means safety counseling.\n\nAlcohol and Unintentional Shootings\n\nGuns should never be handled after consuming alcohol and other substances. Alcohol use is a risk factor for all forms of gun violence, including unintentional injuries and deaths.29 Alcohol can impair judgment and lead to violent behavior. Adding firearms to this already dangerous situation can be deadly.\n\nIndeed, evidence shows that alcohol use is common in unintentional firearm deaths. A 2019 study found that nearly a quarter of those who died from an unintentional firearm injury — and nearly half of all 20-29-year-olds who died from unintentional shootings — had consumed alcohol.30 For the oldest age group in the study (adults aged 60 or older), alcohol was involved in 11.3% of unintentional gun deaths.\n\nDementia and Unintentional Shootings\n\nOlder adults living with dementia or conditions impairing cognition and judgment may be at an increased risk of firearm injury and death.31 One-third of adults 65 and older own guns, and another 12% live in a household with a gun.32 It is estimated that 60% of people living with dementia live in a household with a gun.33\n\nPeople living with dementia who have a firearm in the home may pose a risk to themselves and others. Dementia may make a person unable to safely handle a firearm, and also may result in misperceptions of actual threats.34 Further, dementia, and other diseases, could impair logical thinking and emotional control.35\n\nJust as family members may consult with older relatives’ physicians about concerns about their ability to drive or live alone, family members may also express concerns about their relatives’ ability to use a firearm.36 The Alzheimer’s Association recommends removing firearms from the home of someone living with dementia to prevent unintentional shootings, recognizing that storing or locking up a firearm may not be enough.37 Extreme risk laws may be an appropriate mechanism for removing firearms from an individual living with dementia. This tool has the potential to prevent all forms of gun violence, including unintentional shootings.\n\nTo learn more, visit our page on extreme risk laws."
