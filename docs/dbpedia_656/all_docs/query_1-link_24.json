        "text": "Mitsugi Saotome Presiding Shihan\n\nMitsugi Saotome Shihan is the Founder and supervisory instructor for more than 100 affiliated Dojos of the international Aikido Schools of Ueshiba association.\n\nMaster Saotome has devoted his entire adult life to the study and teaching of Aikido. He began as a special apprentice with the Founder of Aikido, Ueshiba Morihei (O Sensei) in 1955 and continued for 15 years until the Founder’s death in April of 1969.\n\nFrom 1960 until 1975 Master Saotome taught at the World Aikido Headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. During this period, he was accorded many positions, honors and achievements. He appeared publicly at many events in Japan and abroad for the purpose of spreading the understanding and knowledge of Aikido.\n\nIn 1975 Master Saotome decided to leave his highly respected position as a senior instructor at World Aikido Headquarters in Tokyo to come to the United States.\n\nIn addition to regularly scheduled national and international seminars, Master Saotome has taught many special seminars including a U.S. Military Special Forces seminar, special training of the U.S. Security Forces in Washington, D.C. and has demonstrated before the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nMaster Saotome has published a number of highly respected books on Aikido including A Light on Transmission, Aikido and the Harmony of Nature, The Principles of Aikido, and Aikido: Living by Design. He has also authored several training videotapes.\n\nA detailed biography of Saotome Sensei has been recently written, and is available here: Living By Design, A Biography of Mitsugi Saotome Shihan.\n\nMary Heiny Sensei (7th Dan)\n\nFor fifty years, Mary Heiny Sensei has followed a path of physical and spiritual inspiration as a student and teacher of Aikido. She started this journey in 1965 after watching O’Sensei teach a class at Hombu Dojo in Tokyo, Japan. After studying at Hombu Dojo from 1968 to 1973 with O’Sensei’s direct students, Heiny Sensei returned to the United States and began teaching at the University of California in Santa Cruz. In 1976, she went to Seattle and opened Seattle School of Aikido. Sensei was invited to the Ottawa Aikikai in Canada in 1987 where she worked for three years developing the club into a full time dojo. She has taught seminars and workshops in Canada, the US, and Europe.\n\n“I worked to develop an atmosphere in which students would, with me, approach Aikido as a living process to be engaged in rather than merely a series of rigidly unvarying forms to memorize. I emphasized that the techniques of Aikido are intended as tools for us to use in examining the nature of power, to engage in uncompromising self-scrutiny, and to realize our potential as powerful, compassionate, creative, self-aware human beings.”\n\nHeiny brings to every class, workshop, and seminar she teaches not only her years of aikido training and teaching, but also her extensive experience and study of Japanese culture, language, Shinto and Buddhist philosophies, and Non-Violent Communication. She strives always to communicate the beauty and challenge of O’sensei’s desire that we use Aikido to become empowered as creative, compassionate beings and learn to appreciate each other as members of one human family.\n\nMike Page Sensei (6th Dan)\n\nMike Page began his aikido journey 38 years ago after watching an aikido practice in a gym at Florida State University. Struck by the inherent beauty of the logic and consequence of its movements and techniques, Mike began training when he was 30 years old. The first two years of his training began under Yoshimitsu Yamada Shihan. It was in 1987, when attending a seminar in Sarasota, FL, that Mike had his first encounter with Mitsugi Saotome Shihan that changed the course of his aikido journey. When asked about switching to ASU from USAF Mike said “I couldn’t really explain the reason for my change in direction, except to say that what I was looking at was a level of skill that I wanted to strive for in my practice”. And he added, “yes, I’m still striving to achieve that level of skill, even today!”\n\nMore recently, Mike has left the dojo he helped to establish in Tallahassee some 34 years ago to pursue his understanding of Aiki and to train in other martial arts as a journey of musha-shugyo. Mike has been focusing his training on internal technique and its application in aikido and other martial arts and is known for simplifying technical approaches that offer a variety of options for the resolution of martial encounters.\n\nGary Small Sensei (6th Dan)\n\nGary Small was promoted to Rokudan (6th dan) as part of the Kagami Biraki celebration in 2017. He began his martial arts and Aikido training in 1974. In 1988, he joined Shobu Aikido of Boston under the direction of William Gleason sensei. He travels to many Aikido seminars and camps to continue his training as a teacher and student of Aikido. Prior to his move to Maine, he ran a sporting goods sales and marketing company covering the six New England states. This work helped facilitate the family move to Maine and establishment of Aikido of Maine in 2000.\n\n“Having a dojo is an incredible privilege, it is a constant learning experience and a true pleasure to spend my time thinking about our practice and how we can make our dojo a better place. I am very captivated by the power of aikido in people’s lives and from a training perspective I am most interested in the connection aspect of practice and how we can put O’sensei’s teachings of creating harmony and improving the world into physical form.”\n\n”I am always excited with the many ways aikido can help people who are in need of transition and am humbled by the power of the practice to help people improve their lives”.\n\nMarsha Turner Sensei (6th Dan)\n\nMarsha Turner Sensei has anchored the Chicago Aikikai as its chief instructor and dojo-cho since 2012. A long-time aficionado of aikido, she is known in particular for her strong weapons work. Turner Sensei began her study of aikido in 1986 under Kevin Choate Sensei, and Shihan Mitsugi Saotome and Shihan Hiroshi Ikeda have been very influential in her aikido development. Her extensive background in ballet, gymnastics, and traditional fencing (foil) allows her to bring elements to her current training that make her aikido unique among her peers. “Aikido caught my attention and pulled me away from fencing. I loved the rigor of fencing, but the physicality and the opportunity to throw around people bigger than me sealed the deal for aikido.” Turner Sensei received her rokudan in aikido from Shihan Mitsugi Saotome in 2017."
