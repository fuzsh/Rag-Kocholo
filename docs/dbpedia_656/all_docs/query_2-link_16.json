        "text": "MORTALITY TABLES\n\nThe Connecticut Department of Public Health publishes two sets of mortality statistics for deaths occurring to Connecticut residents. AAMR and YPLL statistics are provided for selected causes of death and, when applicable, statistical comparisons to previous years are also provided. Please visit our technical notes page for definitions of mortality terms and for detailed information about mortality statistics. Periodically, special reports or tabulations related to Connecticut resident deaths are prepared by DPH. The reports for 2010 and later can be found at the bottom of this page.\n\nThis series of mortality tables for Connecticut has been revised to incorporate several changes to the tabulation of the AAMR and YPLL statistics. Ten cause-of-death (COD) groups have been added to the tables and existing CODs have been updated for changes in ICD-10 coding. Also, the town- and health district-level mortality tables have been revised to use alternatives to the American Community Survey (ACS) population estimates for town denominators due to limitations with the ACS estimates for many of Connecticut's smaller towns.\n\nThe changes described above may make it difficult to compare mortality statistics from the 2010 tables to the previously published 1999-2009 tables. To address this, any series of mortality tables that includes 2010 deaths will also provide revised tabulations for previous years. To avoid confusion, please use the suggested citation provided in the mortality tables to properly cite which mortality figures were used.\n\nAge Adjusted Mortality Rates (AAMR):\n\nAAMR tables list the cause of death (COD), number of deaths for that cause, crude mortality rate (CMR), and age-adjusted mortality rate (AAMR). Information about the importance of adjusting for multiple comparisons in statistical assessments is available here.\n\nNOTE: All tables are XLSX. Use the Print Layout view in Excel to display page headers and footers that do not appear in Normal view.\n\nStatewide - All CT Residents:\n\nAAMR_State_1yr_2005-2021p_PROVISIONAL (It includes 2020p/2021p statistics, updated 10/07/2022.)\n\nAAMR_State_1yr_2005-2019\n\nAAMR_State_1yr_2000-2014\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2017-2019\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2016-2018\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2015-2017\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2014-2016\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2013-2015\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2012-2014\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2011-2013\n\nAAMR_State_3yr_2010-2012\n\nAAMR_State_5yr_2015-2019\n\nAAMR_State_5yr_2014-2018\n\nAAMR_State_5yr_2013-2017\n\nAAMR_State_5yr_2012-2016\n\nAAMR_State_5yr_2011-2015\n\nAAMR_State_5yr_2010-2014\n\nStatewide by Race/Ethnicity:\n\nRace/Ethnicity tables for 2010+ do not provide statistical comparisons between races/ethnicities.

Unintentional injury was the only leading cause of death for which Connecticut’s rate was higher than the U.S. rate for more than five years as of data year 2020.\n\nCOVID-19 Mortality by Demographics, March 1, 2020-February 28, 2021: Connecticut’s COVID-19-related mortality by age, sex, and race and ethnicity during the first twelve months of the pandemic in the state (March 1, 2020–February 28, 2021). Counts, rates, and disparity ratios were calculated for deaths with COVID-19 as a primary or contributing cause of death on the death certificate. Analysis and interpretation of COVID-19 mortality patterns supplement regular reporting of COVID-19 statistics by the Connecticut Department of Public Health (DPH) at https://portal.ct.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-data-tracker and furthers the agency’s commitment to identifying and eliminating or reducing health inequities among state residents whether due to social or biological causes.\n\nLeading Causes of Death by Sex, Race, and Hispanic Ethnicity, 2006-2010"
