        "text": "There was a change in the top 5 leading causes of death in 2022 with COVID-19 becoming the third leading cause of death. Ischaemic heart diseases remained the leading cause followed by Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, with Cerebrovascular diseases and Lung cancer rounding out the top 5. Chronic lower respiratory diseases became the sixth ranked cause in 2022. Notably:\n\nThis is the first time since 2006 that there has been a change in the top 5 leading causes. In 2006, Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease, entered the top 5, overtaking bowel cancer.\n\nThis is the first time in over 50 years that an infectious disease has been in the top 5 leading causes of death in Australia. In 1968 and 1970, influenza and pneumonia was the fifth leading cause of death.\n\nThe rate of death from COVID-19 has increased by 23.7 deaths per 100,000 since 2021 and 24.5 since 2020. In these years it was the 33rd and 38th leading cause of death.\n\nThe table below shows the top 5 leading causes of death for selected years historically. 1968 is the first year of data for which the ABS holds comprehensive leading cause data. Detailed data associated with this table is presented in the leading cause of death article on this topic page.\n\nCOVID-19 mortality\n\nMost COVID-19 related deaths registered in 2022 occurred during one of the multiple Omicron waves of the pandemic. The Omicron variant was first detected in Australia in November 2021. Detailed information relating to COVID-19 mortality in Australia across all waves and including 2023 data, can be found at COVID-19 Mortality in Australia: Deaths registered until 31 July 2023.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThere were 9,859 deaths due to COVID-19 registered in Australia (27.1 deaths per 100,000 people).\n\nAt the national level, COVID-19 was the third leading cause of death.\n\nCOVID-19 was one of the top 10 leading causes of death in every state and territory.\n\nThere were a further 2,782 people who died of other causes (e.g., cancer), with COVID-19 mentioned as a contributory cause of death on their death certificate.\n\nFor those who died from COVID-19:\n\nTheir median age at death was 85.8 years. This is higher than the median age at death for all-cause mortality which was 82.2 years.\n\nOver half were male (5,484 male deaths and 4,375 female deaths). In all presented age groupings below, there were more male deaths in each age group.\n\nPneumonia was the most common acute disease outcome and was present in 41.7% of COVID-19 deaths in 2022.\n\nCardiac conditions were the most commonly reported pre-existing conditions and were present in 33.0% of COVID-19 deaths in 2022.\n\nNew South Wales (3,608 deaths) and Victoria (2,956 deaths) had the highest number of deaths.\n\nFor those who died with COVID-19 as a contributory condition:\n\nThe most common underlying cause of death was Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (489 deaths).\n\nThe median age at death was 83.8 years.\n\nRespiratory disease mortality\n\nRespiratory diseases (J00-J99) include acute manifestations such as influenza and pneumonia as well as chronic diseases such as emphysema, asthma and interstitial lung disease.\n\nTracking respiratory diseases through the COVID-19 pandemic has provided valuable insights into the success of public health measures. Many acute respiratory diseases (such as influenza and some types of pneumonia) are transmitted via droplets, so measures put in place to prevent the spread of COVID-19 can also reduce the spread of other communicable diseases. This was reflected in the low number of deaths due to influenza occurring in 2020 and 2021.\n\nIn addition, people with chronic lung diseases can be particularly vulnerable to poor outcomes from contracting infectious diseases such as influenza and COVID-19. Historically, respiratory disease mortality rates have reflected the severity of the annual influenza season, with higher rates observed during years with severe flu seasons such as 2017 and 2019.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThe mortality rate from respiratory diseases was 42.5 per 100,000 people. This was an increase of 8.4% from 2021, but remained lower than rates before 2020.\n\nThe increase in 2022 was driven by deaths due to chronic respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nCOPD (J44) represented 3.6% of all deaths.\n\nAcute respiratory diseases:\n\nThere were 305 people who died from influenza in 2022. This contrasts with 2 people in 2021, which was the lowest number of annual flu deaths on record.\n\nThe mortality rate for influenza and pneumonia as a combined group remained low at 7.5 per 100,000 people.\n\nThe number of deaths due to influenza and pneumonia increased by 32.3%, and returned to the top 20 leading causes of death after dropping out for the first time in 2021.\n\nPneumonia is a common terminal cause of death, especially for older people who have long-term chronic conditions. There was an increase of 33.5% in the rate of influenza and pneumonia as an associated cause of death in 2022 (42.6 per 100,000 people). This increase was driven by more deaths due to COVID-19, which was the underlying cause of death for over a quarter of these deaths (27.0%).\n\nThe next most common underlying causes were chronic lower respiratory diseases (10.8%) and dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (10.8%).\n\nAll-cause mortality by age\n\nDeaths data is presented in the table below as age-specific death rates (ASDRs) for selected age groups. In 2021, age-specific death rates increased for all age groups except those aged 25-44 years. In 2022, age-specific death rates continued to increase except for those aged 0-24 years.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nOver half (56%) of all deaths were of people aged 80 years and older.\n\nThe death rates for those aged 45-64 years and 85 years and over were the highest in the 10-year time series.\n\nThe death rate for males aged 0-24 years was the lowest in the 10-year time series.\n\nAfter decreasing in 2021, the rate for males and females aged 25-44 increased by 8.0% and 5.1%, respectively.\n\nThe largest proportional rate increase was for females aged 85 years and over (10.3%). This age group had the largest proportional rate decrease in 2020.\n\nThe median age at death was 82.2 years (79.7 for males, 85.0 for females).\n\nPotentially avoidable mortality\n\nPotentially avoidable mortality refers to deaths of persons under 75 years of age that arise from conditions that may be avoided through individualised care, or treated through primary care or hospitalisation (METeOR, 2021). Conditions causing potentially avoidable deaths include natural diseases (e.g., specific types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and infectious diseases) and external causes of death (e.g., accidents, suicides, and assaults). To enable comparisons over time, all rates presented in this section are age-standardised, which takes into account changes in the structure and size of the population over time.\n\nOn average, 40.2% of potentially avoidable deaths are referred to a coroner (compared with 12-14% of all deaths). Data for 2020, 2021 and 2022 is not yet final - numbers of potentially avoidable deaths should be interpreted with caution, as they will increase when the ABS revisions process is applied.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThere were 28,509 potentially avoidable deaths (18,080 males and 10,429 females). This compares to 27,225 deaths in 2021 (17,291 males and 9,934 females).\n\nThe mortality rate for potentially avoidable deaths increased by 3.5% from 2021 but remained lower than rates prior to 2020 in the 10-year time series.\n\nWhile the mortality rate has increased for both males and females when compared to 2021, the sex ratio has remained relatively constant at 1.8 (male to female).\n\nSuicides\n\nData for 2020, 2021 and 2022 is not yet final – suicide numbers should be interpreted with caution, as they will increase when the ABS revisions process is applied. Revised data for deaths due to suicide registered in 2020, 2021 and 2022 will be published in early 2024.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThere were 3,249 deaths due to suicide (2,455 males and 794 females). This compares to 3,166 suicides in 2021 (2,375 males and 791 females).\n\nThe age-standardised suicide rate was 12.3 deaths per 100,000 people, which was a slight increase from 2021 (12.1).\n\nThe age-standardised suicide rate increased by 2.7% for males from 2021, while the rate for females decreased by 3.3%.\n\nThe median age at death for people who died by suicide was 45.6 (46.0 for males and 44.1 for females).\n\nSuicide remained the 15th leading cause of death.\n\nAlmost 85.8% of people who died by suicide had risk factors identified. The most commonly recorded suicide risk factors included mood affective disorders (F30-F39), suicide ideation (R458), problems with spousal relationships (Z630, Z635) and personal history of self-harm (Z915). For more information see Intentional self-harm deaths (Suicide) in Australia.\n\nMotor vehicle accidents\n\nThere were 1,267 deaths from motor vehicle accidents in 2022 (961 males and 306 females). This compares to 1,226 deaths from motor vehicle accidents in 2021 (934 males and 292 females).\n\nThe age-standardised death rate from motor vehicle accidents increased by 2.2% from 2021 but was lower than rates recorded prior to 2020 in the 10-year time series.\n\nThe death rate increased by 4.8% for females from 2021, while the rate did not change for males in the same period.\n\nFor males, those aged 65-84 years had the largest numerical increase with 32 more deaths due to motor vehicle accidents than in 2021. The largest decrease was seen in males aged under 24 years, with 17 fewer deaths in this group than in 2021.\n\nFor females, the rate increase was driven by those aged under 44 years, with 21 more deaths in this group than in 2021.\n\nAssaults\n\nData for 2020, 2021 and 2022 is not yet final - numbers of deaths due to assault should be interpreted with caution, as they are expected to increase when the ABS revisions process is applied. Revised data for deaths due to assault registered in 2020, 2021 and 2022 will be published in early 2024.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThere were 228 deaths due to assault (158 males and 70 females). This compares to 215 deaths due to assault in 2021 (154 males and 61 females).\n\nThe age-standardised death rate for assault increased from 0.8 per 100,000 people in 2021 to 0.9 per 100,000 people in 2022.\n\nThe largest numerical increase in assault deaths was in females aged between 45 and 64 years, with 11 more deaths for this group than in 2021.\n\nThe largest numerical decrease was for males aged between 45 and 54 years (6 fewer deaths than in 2021).\n\nDrug-induced deaths\n\nDrug-induced deaths are those which are directly attributable to drug use. They include deaths due to acute drug toxicity (e.g., overdose) and chronic drug use (e.g., drug-induced cardiac conditions).\n\nOn average, 97% of drug-induced deaths are certified by a coroner. Multiple complex factors must be considered when a death is certified as drug induced. These factors include:\n\nThe timing between the death and toxicology testing which can influence the levels and types of drugs detected, making it difficult to determine the true level of a drug at the time of death.\n\nIndividual tolerance levels may vary considerably depending on factors such as sex, body mass and previous drug exposure.\n\nContextual factors such as preexisting natural disease and reports from informants (e.g., friends and families) regarding the circumstances of the death.\n\nFor these reasons, it can take a significant amount of time to certify a death as drug-induced, making these deaths particularly sensitive to the revisions process.\n\nData for 2020, 2021 and 2022 is not yet final - numbers of drug-induced deaths should be interpreted with caution, as they are expected to increase when the ABS revisions process is applied. Revised data for drug-induced deaths registered in 2020, 2021 and 2022 will be published in early 2024.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThere were 1,693 drug-induced deaths (1,082 males and 611 females). This compares to 1,788 deaths in 2021 (1,120 males and 668 females).\n\nDrug-induced deaths registered in New South Wales had the greatest rate decrease from 2021 (24.2%) compared to other states and territories. It is expected that there is some administrative affect to this decrease: when the revisions process is applied, the number and rate of drug-induced deaths is likely to increase.\n\nThe sex ratio for drug-induced deaths was 1.9 (male to female).\n\nThe median age at death was 47.4 years. For males the median age at death was 45.4 years and for females 50.0 years.\n\nOpioids were the most common drug class identified in toxicology for drug-induced deaths.\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths\n\nAlcohol-induced deaths are those where the underlying cause can be directly attributed to alcohol use, including acute conditions such as alcohol poisoning or chronic conditions such as alcoholic liver cirrhosis.\n\nOn average, 70.1% of alcohol-induced deaths are certified by a doctor. These deaths are primarily caused by chronic alcohol-induced conditions. As a result, alcohol-induced deaths data are less likely to be impacted by ABS revisions than causes with a higher proportion of coroner referral such as drug-induced deaths and suicides.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThere were 1,742 alcohol-induced deaths (1,245 males and 497 females).\n\nThere was a 9.1% increase in the alcohol-induced death rate, with 164 additional deaths since 2021.\n\nThe age-standardised rate for alcohol-induced deaths was 8.7 for males and 3.4 for females, representing the highest rates per 100,000 people in the 10-year time series.\n\nThe rate increase is largely due to complications associated with chronic alcohol use including liver cirrhosis and liver failure.\n\nThe largest numerical increase in alcohol-induced deaths from 2021 was in females aged 45-64 years (55 more deaths) and males aged 65-84 years (47 more deaths).\n\nIn 2022 there were 190,939 deaths, with an age-standardised death rate of 547.6 deaths per 100,000 people.\n\nCOVID-19 was the third leading cause of death in Australia. An infectious disease has not appeared in the top 5 leading causes of death in Australia since Influenza and pneumonia was ranked 5th in 1970.\n\nIschaemic heart disease was the leading cause of death, accounting for 9.8% of all deaths, the first time Ischaemic heart disease has accounted for less than 10.0% of all deaths since official cause of death statistics began collection in 1968.\n\nLeading causes of death\n\nThere were 190,939 deaths registered in Australia in 2022, an increase of close to 20,000 deaths from 2021. The age-standardised mortality rate increased to 547.6 deaths per 100,000 people, up from 507.2 the previous year.\n\nFor people whose death was registered in 2022:\n\n52.3% were male (99,924) and 47.7% were female (91,015).\n\nTheir median age at death was 82.2 years (79.7 for males, 85.0 for females).\n\nThe top 5 leading causes accounted for approximately one-third of all registered deaths.\n\nIdentifying and comparing leading causes of death in populations is useful for tracking changes in patterns of mortality and identifying emerging trends. For more information related to the tabulation of leading causes, see the Methodology section of this publication.\n\nLeading causes of death in 2022:\n\nIschaemic heart disease remained the leading cause of death, followed by Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease at second.\n\nCOVID-19 was the third leading cause of death. This represents the first change to the top 5 leading causes of death since 2006 when Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease first appeared, overtaking bowel cancer.\n\nAustralia has not had an infectious disease in the top 5 leading causes of death since 1970, when deaths due to influenza and pneumonia were the fifth leading cause. The median age at death for influenza and pneumonia was 74.3 compared to COVID which was 86.0 in 2022. While deaths due to influenza and pneumonia are often categorised as respiratory diseases, influenza is a viral infection of the respiratory tract and pneumonia is a lung infection which can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi.\n\nCerebrovascular disease and Lung cancer rounded out the top 5 leading causes.\n\nChronic lower respiratory disease dropped to the 6th leading cause of death due to the introduction of COVID-19 in the top 5 cause rankings.\n\nPeople who died from Dementia, including Alzheimer's had the highest median age at death for causes in the top 20 at 89.0 years.\n\nSuicide was the 15th leading cause of death. People who died by suicide had a median age at death of 45.6.\n\nLeading causes of death over the last decade (since 2013):\n\nDeaths due to Ischaemic heart disease and Cerebrovascular disease decreased by 6.1% and 7.0% respectively.\n\nDeaths due to Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease increased by 56.0%, resulting in a narrowing with deaths due to Ischaemic heart disease.\n\nDiabetes deaths increased by almost 40.0%, but remained the 7th leading cause over the period.\n\nDeaths from Accidental falls more than doubled over the period, and has had the largest increase in leading cause ranking. Accidental falls are the 11th leading cause of death, compared to the 18th a decade ago. They are the highest ranked external cause of death.\n\nAge-standardised death rates\n\nAge-standardised death rates enable the comparison of death rates over time as they account for changes in the size and age structure of the population. Refer to Mortality tabulations and methodologies, Age-standardised death rates (SDRs) in the Methodology section of this publication for more information.\n\nFor age-standardised death rates between 2013 to 2022:\n\nIschaemic heart disease decreased by 25.7% over the decade. The SDR increased from 2020 in both 2021 and 2022, after annual decreases in each of the 8 years prior.\n\nThe gap between Ischaemic heart disease and Dementia has narrowed over time; however the rate difference has slowed since the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile the number of Dementia deaths has increased over the 10 year period, the age-standardised death rate for Dementia has been more stable.\n\nCerebrovascular disease decreased by 27.0%.\n\nMalignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung (Lung cancer) decreased by 15.3%.\n\nThe rate of death from COVID-19 was 27.1 per 100,000 people, approximately 8 times higher than the rate in 2021 and over 10 times higher than the rate in 2020.\n\nYears of potential life lost\n\nYears of potential life lost (YPLL) is a measure of premature mortality which weights age at death to gain an estimate of how many years a person would have lived had they not died prematurely. Causes of death with a median age less than the life expectancy will have a higher number of YPLL. When considered in terms of premature mortality, the leading causes of death have a notably different profile. Refer to Mortality tabulations and methodologies - Years of potential life lost (YPLL) in the Methodology section of this publication for more information.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nSuicide is a leading cause of premature death accounting for the highest number of potential years of life lost (108,762). People who died by suicide had a median age at death of 45.6.\n\nIschaemic heart disease had the highest number of deaths occurring in those aged under 78 but the second highest number of YPLL at 76,865 years. People who died from Ischaemic heart disease had a median age at death of 83.8.\n\nPeople who died from Lung cancer, Transport accidents and Accidental poisoning had the 3rd, 4th and 5th highest YPLL, with median ages at 75.2, 46.4 and 46.1, respectively.\n\nLeading causes of death by sex - Males\n\nFor the 99,924 males who died in 2022:\n\nCOVID-19 was the third leading cause of death (5,484 deaths), up from 33rd in 2021 (660 deaths). The rate of death from COVID-19 was 34.8 deaths per 100,000 people.\n\nIschaemic heart disease was the leading cause of death (11,303 deaths) and remains considerably higher than the second ranked cause (Dementia at 6,130 deaths).\n\nProstate cancer was the seventh leading cause of death and second leading cause of cancer death.\n\nSuicide was the 11th leading cause. Three-quarters (75.6%) of people who died by suicide were male. Deaths due to suicide were the highest ranked external cause of death in males.\n\nFor males from 2013 to 2022:\n\nThe death rate for Ischaemic heart disease decreased by 23.5%.\n\nThe death rate for Dementia, including Alzheimer's disease increased by 19.6%.\n\nThe death rate for Lung cancer decreased by 22.0%.\n\nLeading causes of death by state of usual residence\n\nThe leading cause of death profile for Australia is not the same across all jurisdictions. The table below shows the top 10 leading causes of death for each state and territory in 2022, providing insights into how the COVID-19 pandemic differed across jurisdictions in this time.\n\nLeading causes of death for states and territories in 2022:\n\nCOVID-19 appeared in the top 10 leading causes for all jurisdictions. The ranking differed across the states and territories ranging from being the 3rd leading cause (in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Australian Capital Territory) to the 9th in Northern Territory.\n\nCOVID-19 was the 6th leading cause in the remaining jurisdictions (Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania).\n\nThe top 10 leading cause profile for New South Wales is the same as the leading causes for Australia overall. Deaths in New South Wales account for approximately one-third of all deaths.\n\nIschaemic heart disease is the top leading cause in each jurisdiction, except for South Australia and Australian Capital Territory, where Dementia, including Alzheimer's is the leading cause of death.\n\nDeaths from external causes contribute to a greater proportion of mortality in Northern Territory when compared with other jurisdictions. Transport accidents and Intentional self-harm were the 6th and 7th ranked leading causes.\n\nLeading causes of death- historical trends\n\nThe table below presents a time series of leading causes of death for selected years from 1968 to 2022.\n\nOver the last 55 years:\n\nThe top 5 leading causes of death remained the same between 2006 and 2021, with some variance in rankings. With the introduction COVID-19 as the third leading cause in 2022, Chronic lower respiratory disease no longer features in the top 5.\n\nWhile deaths due to Ischaemic heart disease have been the leading cause of death over the 55 year period, they have decreased by 44.2%. Between 1968 and 1978 Ischaemic heart disease accounted for approximately 30% of all deaths. This compares to less than 10% in 2022.\n\nIn 1968 Dementia, including Alzheimer's contributed to 0.2% of all deaths, compared to 9.0% in 2022. Dementia, including Alzheimer's first appeared in the top 5 leading causes of death in 2006 when it overtook bowel cancer (currently the 8th leading cause).\n\nCerebrovascular disease was ranked 2nd from 1968 until 2013, when Dementia, including Alzheimer's became the 2nd leading cause. Between 1968 and 2022, deaths due to Cerebrovascular disease have decreased by 36.0%.\n\nInfluenza and pneumonia was the fifth leading cause of death in 1968 and most recently appeared in the top 5 causes of death in 1970. This is the last time an infectious disease appeared in the top 5 leading causes of death. While the number of deaths has remained relatively stable across years, their relative contribution to all deaths has decreased due to our growing population.\n\nSince the 1970's deaths due to lung cancer have consistently caused 4-6% of deaths each year.\n\nIn 2022 there were 4,587 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who died across the 5 jurisdictions (NSW, Qld, WA, SA and NT).\n\nTheir median age was 62.9 years. The median age at death has increased by nearly ten years over the last two decades (53.2 years in 2003) and is the highest recorded for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.\n\nIschaemic heart disease was the leading cause of death for both males and females.\n\nCOVID-19 was the 9th leading cause of death. For males it was the 11th leading cause of death and for females it was the 7th leading cause.\n\nSuicide was the 2nd leading cause of death for males.\n\nTop 5 leading causes of death of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males and females who died in 2022:\n\nFour of the 5 leading causes of death for males were the same compared to females. They were Ischaemic heart disease, Diabetes, Lung cancer and Chronic lower respiratory diseases.\n\nSuicide was the second leading cause of death for males in 2022, compared to 10th for females.\n\nDementia, including Alzheimer's disease was the fifth leading cause of death for females and the 12th leading cause for males.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who died between 2013 and 2022:\n\nThe 5 leading causes of death (Ischaemic heart diseases, Diabetes, Chronic lower respiratory diseases, Lung cancer and Suicide) accounted for over one-third of all deaths.\n\nThe 5 leading causes of death have remained the same between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022.\n\nOverall, the age-standardised rate increased by 8.6% between these two 5-year periods.\n\nThe rate decreased for Diabetes by 4.7%, the second leading cause of death, between the two 5-year periods. It was the only cause in the top 5 leading causes to decrease.\n\nSuicide remains the fifth leading cause of death in 2022. The rate increased by 17.9% from 2013-2017 to 2018-2022.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males and females between 2013-2017 and 2018-2022:\n\nFor females, there were two causes in the top 5 leading causes where the age-standardised death rate decreased over the period. They were Diabetes (8.2% decrease) and Ischaemic heart disease (0.7% decrease).\n\nFor females, the largest increase in the top 5 leading causes was for Dementia, including Alzheimer's (37.6% increase).\n\nFor males, all top 5 leading causes of death had a rate increase over the period. The largest increases were for Suicide (16.9% increase) and Lung cancer (14.8%).\n\nAmong the top 20 leading causes of death in 2022:\n\nAge-standardised death rates are higher in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for all 20 leading causes of death.\n\nThe top four leading causes of death also had the four largest rate differences.\n\nThe largest rate ratio is for deaths due to Diabetes, where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a rate over 5 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people.\n\nThe second highest rate ratio is for deaths due to Accidental drug-induced deaths, where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have a rate 4 times higher than that of non-Indigenous people.\n\nFor deaths due to COVID-19, the mortality rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 41.2 per 100,000 people and for non-Indigenous people it was 26.8.\n\nThe closest ratios were for Dementia, including Alzheimer's and Blood and lymph cancers (both 1.2), and next closest was Accidental falls (1.4).\n\nCOVID-19 by Indigenous status by 5 jurisdictions: NSW, Qld, WA, SA, NT\n\nThe median age of deaths due to COVID-19 for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 71.3 years and 86.0 years for non-Indigenous people. For both populations, the median age at death from COVID-19 was higher than the median age for all-cause mortality in 2022 (62.9 and 82.4).\n\nIt was the 9th leading cause of death for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared to 4th for non-Indigenous people in these 5 jurisdictions.\n\nCompared to non-Indigenous people, a higher proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people died with COVID-19 as a contributing factor to their death (ie. when COVID-19 was certified on the death certificate but it was not the underlying cause of death).\n\nFor deaths due to COVID-19:\n\nThere were 135 deaths due to COVID-19 of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared to 6,433 deaths of non-Indigenous people.\n\nInfluenza and pneumonia was the most common cause grouping reported with COVID-19 for both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous people. Pneumonia is a common complication of COVID-19.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people these deaths were more likely to be reported with diabetes and urinary diseases as contributing co-morbidities than non-Indigenous people (11.0% and 10.1% respectively).\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, these deaths were less likely to be reported with dementia than non-Indigenous people (7.9% less deaths with dementia).\n\nSuicide by sex\n\nIn order to measure changes over time, age-standardised suicide rates for males, females and all persons are presented in the graph below. Upper and lower bounds (confidence intervals) are included to show the potential variability of the annual suicide rates and can be used in measuring statistical significance of the annual rate change.\n\nFor males in 2022:\n\nThere were 2,455 deaths due to suicide.\n\nSuicide was the 11th leading cause of death.\n\nThe median age at death for those who died by suicide was 46.0 years.\n\nOver three-quarters (75.6%) of people who died by suicide were male.\n\nThe suicide rate for males increased by 2.6% from 2021.\n\nFor females in 2022:\n\nThere were 794 deaths due to suicide.\n\nSuicide was the 26th leading cause of death.\n\nThe median age at death for those who died by suicide was 44.1 years.\n\nThe suicide rate for females decreased by 2.3% from 2021.\n\nSuicide by age\n\nUnderstanding how suicide manifests across key demographics is important in helping to target policies and prevention activities. The graph below shows the age distribution for those who died by suicide and the proportion of those deaths that occurred within each age cohort.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nYoung and middle-aged people were more likely to die by suicide than those in older age cohorts.\n\n81.7 percent of people who died by suicide were aged under 65 years.\n\nPeople who died by suicide had a median age of 45.6 years compared to 82.2 years for all deaths.\n\nThe proportional distribution of those aged under 25 who died by suicide differed for males and females:\n\nFor females, 15.5% of suicides occurred in those aged under 25 years.\n\nFor males 10.5% of suicides occurred in those aged under 25.\n\nSuicide of females: age-specific death rates\n\nAge-specific death rates show how suicide manifests across age cohorts by relating the number of deaths to the size and structure of the underlying population.\n\nIn 2022, females aged over 85 years:\n\nHad the highest age-specific suicide rate for the first time since the beginning of the ABS mortality data time series (starts in 1968) with a rate of 10.6 deaths per 100,000 females.\n\nAccounted for 4.4% of suicides of females.\n\nIn 2022, females aged under 50 years:\n\nThose aged between 45-49 years had the highest age-specific suicide rate of females aged under 85 years (8.8 deaths per 100,000).\n\nThe highest proportion of suicide occurred in those aged between 25-29 years (9.4%).\n\nBetween 2021 and 2022:\n\nFemales aged between 70-74 years had the largest increase in their age-specific suicide rate (up 1.7 deaths per 100,000).\n\nFemales aged between 40-44 years had the largest decrease in their age-specific suicide rate (down 1.6 deaths per 100,000).\n\nSuicide accounted for the highest number of years of potential life lost among leading cause groups of conditions for both males and females. This is due to the high proportion of suicides that occur within younger age groups. Conditions such as coronary heart disease account for more premature deaths than suicide, but less years of potential life lost.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nSuicide was the leading cause of death for those aged between 15-44 years.\n\nSuicide was the leading cause of premature mortality with 108,762 years of life lost.\n\nA person who died by suicide lost on average 35.6 years of life.\n\nFor males who died in 2022:\n\nSuicide was the leading cause of premature mortality with 80,958 years of life lost.\n\nThose who died by suicide lost on average 34.9 years of life.\n\nFor females who died in 2022:\n\nSuicide was the leading cause of premature mortality with 27,893 years of life lost.\n\nThose who died by suicide lost on average 37.7 years of life.\n\nSuicide of children\n\nDeaths of children by suicide is an extremely sensitive issue. The number of deaths of children attributed to suicide can be influenced by coronial reporting practices. Reporting practices may lead to differences in counts across jurisdictions and this should be considered when interpreting tabulations and analysis of suicide deaths in children presented below. For more information on issues associated with the compilation and interpretation of suicide data, see Deaths due to intentional self-harm (suicide) section of the methodology in this publication. For the purposes of the following analysis, children are defined as those aged between 5 and 17 years of age. The ABS are not aware of any recorded suicides of children under the age of 5 years. The tabulation below shows the number and age-specific death rate for children who died by suicide over the last 5 years.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThere were 77 children who died by suicide. This is the lowest number of suicides of children in the 5 year time series presented.\n\nSuicide accounted for 15.5% of child deaths.\n\nSuicide was the second leading cause of child death in Australia, after land transport accidents. This is a reduction from previous years- Suicide has been the leading cause of death in children since 2013.\n\nMales had a suicide rate of 2.2 per 100,000 children (47 deaths).\n\nFemales had a suicide rate of 1.5 per 100,000 children (30 deaths).\n\nOver 80% of children who died by suicide were aged 15-17 years (64 deaths).\n\nThe suicide rate in Queensland decreased by 54.3% in 2022. Queensland and was the largest contributor to the overall decrease in suicides of children between 2021 and 2022.\n\nSuicide by country of birth\n\nPeople from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds (CaLD) may have unique experiences in relation to mental health and suicide, including cultural and family views and how health services are accessed. Death registrations do not directly collect information on whether a person was part of a CaLD community. Data items from the death registration which can provide some indication of cultural and linguistic diversity are country of birth and years of residence in Australia. While these two variables do not provide complete information on suicide for people of CaLD backgrounds, they do provide some additional insights into suicide in Australia.\n\nFour new data tables containing suicide data by country of birth have been added to this publication. These tables have been included in Data Cube 11 (Tables 11.22-11.25).\n\nSuicide by region of birth\n\nFor the 5-year period 2018 to 2022:\n\nThose who were born in Australia had a suicide rate of 14.7 deaths per 100,000 people, which was the highest suicide rate by region of birth and 79.3% higher than the suicide rate for those born overseas (8.2 per 100,000).\n\nFor those born overseas:\n\nThose with a country of birth in the Oceania and Antarctic region (excluding Australia) had the highest suicide rate, at 14.2 per 100,000 people.\n\nThose with a country of birth in Southern and Central Asia had the lowest suicide rate, at 4.2 per 100,000 people. Those born in this region also had the lowest median age at death at 34.5 years.\n\nSouth-East Asia and Southern and Central Asia were the only two country of birth regions with a lower median age at death due to suicide than those born in Australia.\n\nCircumstances relating to a suicide are complex and multifaceted. Often, it is the combination of multiple factors rather than a single reason that contribute to a person dying by suicide. Risk factors should not be considered in isolation.\n\nThe ABS codes causes of death from information contained on the National Coronial Information System (NCIS), including police, pathology, toxicology and coroners reports. These reports provide a breadth of information relating to these deaths, much of which is highly important from a public health perspective. As part of the investigative process for a suicide, risk factors are often mentioned in these reports. For suicide, a risk factor could be one of many factors including mental health conditions, lifestyle factors, or chronic diseases that can interact and increase the \"risk\" of suicide. While a risk factor may have been present in the life of a person who died by suicide it may not have been a direct cause. Risk factors provide important insights that can help guide prevention and intervention activities.\n\nThe risk factors mentioned in the reports on the NCIS are captured as part of the ABS coding process and assigned codes within the framework of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision. The capture of information on associated causes of death is reliant on the documentation available for any given death. This in turn can be affected by the length of the coronial process, the type of information available across different jurisdictions and administrative processes affecting report availability. As such, the information presented in this section reflects information contained within reports available on NCIS at the time of coding and does not necessarily reflect all causes associated with all suicides that have occurred. Risk factors are included and made available as part of the associated causes in the national mortality dataset.\n\nIn 2022:\n\n85.8% of people who died by suicide had at least one risk factor reported at the time of preliminary coding. This proportion is likely to increase as coronial investigations are finalised.\n\nPsychosocial risk factors were the most commonly reported risk factor, present in 68.3% of deaths of people who died by suicide.\n\nPeople who died by suicide had an average of 3 to 4 risk factors mentioned.\n\nSuicide risk factors by age\n\nThe types of risk factors experienced by a person can vary across their life. Risk factors more commonly seen in persons in older age groups, such as pain and limitation of activities due to chronic health conditions, are not as common in younger age groups. Similarly, problems related to employment and unemployment are most common in those included in the working age population (defined as 15-64 years).\n\nIn 2022:\n\nMood disorders (including depression) were the most common risk factor to be mentioned in all age groups except those aged 85 years and over.\n\nLimitation of activities due to illness and disability continues to be the most common risk factor for those aged 85 years and over.\n\nSuicide ideation was mentioned as a risk factor in at least one fifth of suicide deaths across all age groups. Suicide ideation can include thoughts or contemplation of suicide, and both direct and indirect discussions or comments surrounding a person’s intention or wish to end their life.\n\nThose aged under 45 years were most likely to have issues with psychoactive substance use (both acute use and intoxication, as well as chronic use) mentioned as a risk factor.\n\nThose aged 65 years and over were most likely to have chronic health conditions and pain mentioned as a risk factor.\n\nFactors relating to employment and unemployment were most commonly mentioned as a risk factor in those aged 45-64 years.\n\nAcute alcohol use was recorded as a factor in 16.1% of suicides, and directly contributed to death in a further 2.0% (i.e., deaths due to intentional alcohol toxicity or mixed drug and alcohol toxicity (X60-X65)). Acute alcohol use can affect a death due to suicide in a number of ways including causing respiratory depression (especially when used in combination with other drugs) or affecting judgement and decision-making processes.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThose aged between 25-44 years were the most likely age group to have acute alcohol use and intoxication mentioned as a risk factor (present in 19.6% of suicides in this age group).\n\nThose aged between 45-64 years were the most likely age group to have chronic alcohol abuse disorders mentioned as a risk factor (present in 15.4% of suicides in this age group).\n\nPsychoactive substance use was recorded as a factor in 14.2% of suicides, and directly contributed to death in a further 12.3% (i.e., deaths due to intentional drug toxicity or mixed drug and alcohol toxicity (X60-X65)). Similar to alcohol, acute use of psychoactive substances can affect a death due to suicide in a number of ways, including by impairing cognition, perception or moods, or by causing toxicity.\n\nIn 2022:\n\nThose aged between 25-44 years were the most likely age group to have issues with psychoactive substance use (both acute use and intoxication as well as chronic use) mentioned as a risk factor (present in 19.2% and 19.5% of suicides in this age group, respectively).\n\nFor those aged under 25 years, acute and chronic psychoactive substance use were both more common risk factors than acute or chronic alcohol use.\n\nSuicide risk factors for males\n\nIn 2022 for males who died by suicide:\n\nMood disorders (including depression) were the most common risk factor to be mentioned overall, as well as for those aged 5-24, 45-64 and 65-84 years.\n\nThe top risk factor for males aged 25-44 years was problems in spousal relationships circumstances, present in over one-third of suicides. Problems in spousal relationships overtook mood disorders as the top risk factor in this age group for the first time and can include separation and divorce as well as arguments and domestic violence situations.\n\nThere was overall a higher proportion of acute substance abuse disorders than chronic substance abuse disorders identified.\n\nMales aged 25-44 years were the most likely age group to have substance abuse mentioned as a risk factor, including:\n\nAcute psychoactive substance use and intoxication (20.6%)\n\nChronic psychoactive substance abuse disorders (20.0%)\n\nAcute alcohol use and intoxication (19.5%)\n\nChronic alcohol abuse disorders (14.8%).\n\nSuicide risk factors for females\n\nIn 2022 for females who died by suicide:\n\nMood disorders (including depression) were the most common risk factor, being captured as a risk factor in over 40% of all female suicides, and over 50% of suicides of females aged 45-64 years.\n\nPersonal history of self-harm was the most common risk factor for those aged under 25 years.\n\nSuicide ideation was mentioned as a risk factor in over one quarter of suicides in every age group.\n\nOverall, substance abuse was less commonly mentioned as a suicide risk factor for females than for males.\n\nAcute psychoactive substance use was the most common form of substance abuse for those aged 5-24 years.\n\nFor all other age groups, the most common form of substance abuse was either acute or chronic alcohol use.\n\nSuicide risk factor by year\n\nPsychosocial risk factors have been coded by the ABS since 2017. The addition of psychosocial factors to the national mortality dataset added to information on risk factors that were already captured such as mental health disorders and chronic diseases. As many coronial investigations in 2017, 2018 and 2019 are now closed, data for those years are considered \"final\" (see Revisions process in the methodology for more information). Information on risk factors across the past 5 years is presented below.\n\nFor suicides across 2018-2022:\n\nMood disorders were the most common risk factor for each year.\n\nSuicide ideation has been the second most common risk factor since 2020.\n\nAcute alcohol use and intoxication was more common than acute psychoactive substance use in 2021 and 2022.\n\nChronic psychoactive substance abuse disorders continue to be more common than chronic alcohol abuse disorders.\n\nProblems in spousal relationships and personal history of self-harm are the two most common psychosocial risk factors recorded across these years.\n\nProblems in relationships with family and friends (excluding spousal relationships) has returned to the top 10 risk factors in 2022.\n\nCOVID-19 as a risk factor for suicide\n\nThose who died by suicide with issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic as a risk factor:\n\nRepresented 2.6% of all suicides in 2022.\n\nHad an average of 6.5 risk factors mentioned.\n\nHad an average of 3.5 psychosocial risk factors mentioned.\n\nThe table below shows the most common co-occurring risk factors for suicides with the COVID-19 pandemic identified as a risk factor. Risk factors are not mutually exclusive, and an individual may appear in multiple categories.\n\nIn 2022, for the 84 people who died by suicide with the COVID-19 pandemic identified as a risk factor:\n\nThe most common co-occurring risk factor was problems related to employment and unemployment.\n\nThe number and proportion of people with co-occurring substance abuse disorders was greater than in previous years:\n\n25.0% of people had co-occurring alcohol abuse disorders.\n\n21.4% of people had co-occurring psychoactive substance abuse disorders.\n\nThere were 17 people who had co-occurring problems related to the social environment including social isolation.\n\nSuicide of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people by state and territory of usual residence\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who died by suicide between 2013 and 2022:\n\nThe suicide rate increased from 23.4 per 100,000 people in 2013-2017 to 27.6 per 100,000 in 2018-2022.\n\nPeople with a usual residence in New South Wales had a lower suicide rate than those living elsewhere across both 5-year periods, but had the largest rate increase between the two periods.\n\n2022 saw the largest rate increase in New South Wales since 2015. This increase is entirely accounted for by changes made in 2022 to the derivation of Indigenous status for deaths registered in NSW (see Technical Note: The impact of using two sources for deriving the Indigenous status of deaths in NSW in 2022).\n\nThose with a usual residence in Western Australia recorded the highest suicide rate in both 5-year periods.\n\nOne third of people who died by suicide during 2018-2022 had a usual residence in Queensland.\n\nSouth Australia was the only jurisdiction to record a decrease in rate across the two periods.\n\nSuicide of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children\n\nDeaths of children by suicide is an extremely sensitive issue. The number of deaths of children attributed to suicide can be influenced by coronial reporting practices. Reporting practices may lead to differences in counts across jurisdictions and this should be considered when interpreting analysis of suicide deaths in children. For more information on issues associated with the compilation and interpretation of suicide data, see Deaths due to intentional self-harm (suicide) and Deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the methodology in this publication. For the purposes of the following analysis, children are defined as those aged between 5 and 17 years of age. The ABS is not aware of any recorded suicides of children under the age of 5 years.\n\nDuring the period 2018-2022:\n\nSuicide was the leading cause of death for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children.\n\n27.2% of deaths of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were due to suicide.\n\nOver three-quarters (75.3%) of Aboriginal and Torres strait islander children who died by suicide were aged between 15 and 17 years.\n\nOver half (57.1%) of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children who died by suicide were female.\n\nFor more information on suicide of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children see Table 11.12 in Data Cube 11 in this publication.\n\nSuicide by Indigenous status\n\nMortality data can provide important insights into population health concerns relevant to different groups within the Australian population. Patterns of death among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people differ considerably to those of non-Indigenous people, as is the case with suicide.\n\nFor Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who died by suicide between 2013 and 2022:\n\nThe suicide rate was more than double that of non-Indigenous people in the 5-year period 2018-2022.\n\nThe difference between the suicide rate for Aboriginal and Torres-Strait Islander people and non-Indigenous people has increased for both males and females across the two 5-year periods.\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males had the largest rate increase across the two 5-year periods.\n\nIn 2022, for the 5 jurisdictions included in analysis (not including Victoria, Tasmania and Australian Capital Territory):\n\nSuicide was the 5th leading cause of death for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared to 17th for non-Indigenous people.\n\nThe median age for suicides was 33.4 years for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared to 46.9 years for non-Indigenous people."
