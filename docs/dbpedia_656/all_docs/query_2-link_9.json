        "text": "The following types of deaths are excluded from these indicators:\n\nDeaths related to chronic use of drugs (e.g., damage to organs from long-term drug use)\n\nDeaths due to alcohol and tobacco\n\nDeaths from adverse effects of drugs\n\nDeaths that occur under the influence of drugs, but do not involve acute poisoning (e.g., a car crash that occurred because the driver was drowsy from taking a prescription drug).\n\nThe percentage of fatal drug overdoses lacking information on the death certificate about the specific drug(s) causing the death varies substantially over time and by state and local jurisdiction (e.g., some states have almost no missing data while others lack specific information on over 50% of their drug overdose deaths). State epidemiologists should understand the completeness of reporting of the specific drug(s) involved in their jurisdiction in order to understand the quality and limitations of the indicators for reporting and interpretation purposes.\n\nDeath investigators may require weeks or months to complete their investigation (e.g., complete toxicology testing) and classify a death as a drug overdose. While the investigation is being conducted, deaths may be assigned a pending status on the death certificate. That status should be updated when the investigation is complete. State epidemiologists should have an understanding of the death investigation process in their jurisdiction in order to determine the quality of the indicators for reporting and interpretation purposes.\n\nBecause many drug overdose deaths involve more than one drug, the same death may be counted in more than one indicator. For example, rates for the individual indicator “Drug Overdose Deaths Involving Natural and Semi-Synthetic Opioids” (Indicator 5) and “Drug Overdose Deaths Involving Methadone” (Indicator 7) will not sum to the rate for “Drug Overdose Deaths Involving Prescription Opioid Pain Relievers: Natural and Semi-Synthetic Opioids and Methadone” (Indicator 4) because some deaths could involve both methadone and a natural or semi-synthetic opioid.\n\nIt is anticipated that complete drug overdose death data files will be available within nine (9) months after the end of a calendar year.\n\nRate Calculations: Overdose deaths are presented as a rate per 100,000 population.\n\nSuppression: Suppression is applied to death counts of 1 to 4 and rates with numerators of 1 to 4 to maintain confidentiality and accurate rate calculations. Suppressed statistics are indicated with an asterisk (*).\n\nData is produced and processed from sources believed to be reliable and accurate at that point of time. No warranty expressed or implied is made regarding accuracy, adequacy, completeness, legality, reliability or usefulness of any information. Additionally, not all data elements are reported at the source. Please see Virginia Code §32.1 for information on data mandated to be conveyed by the patient and/or facility. This disclaimer applies to both isolated and aggregate uses of the data.\n\nWhile VDH strives to report data both accurately and timely, delays can occur in awaiting finalized data for both Out-of-State Records and/or National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) edits.\n\nDeaths attributed to ICD-10 Code R99 “Other ill-defined and unspecified cause of mortality” could potentially be cases of opioid-related deaths. Deaths classified as R99 are reviewed and updated monthly by VDH to ascertain potential opioid-related deaths.\n\nAggregate statewide and locality counts for the Commonwealth of Virginia may differ from the reported counts from the VDH Office of the Chief Medical Examiner (OCME). Some possible causes of these potential discrepancies are:\n\nVirginia Department of Health's Vital Event Statistics Program reports deaths based on the decedent's residence, whereas OCME reports deaths based on where the event (i.e., opioid overdose) occurred. OCME investigates deaths that occur in Virginia, whereas Vital Event Statistics Program data presented here only reports deaths of Virginia residents\n\nVital Event Statistics Program utilizes ICD-10 medical coding to report underlying and contributing cause(s) of death. OCME utilizes a unique coding scheme that also incorporates toxicology and cause of death statements for overdose coding\n\nThere is no unique ICD-10 code for fentanyl; fentanyl deaths are currently captured within the ICD-10 code of T40.4 (synthetic opioids, other than methadone) in the Vital Statistics data. OCME is able to code for fentanyl due to toxicology reporting and investigation."
