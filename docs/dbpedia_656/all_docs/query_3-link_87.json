        "text": "INDUSTRIALIZED NATION CASE STUDIES\n\nGermany\n\nGermany is proving that even a high-wage nation can compete globally in manufacturing. Exports of everything from kitchen equipment and industrial machinery to high-speed trains and wind turbines by small and large firms alike296 surged by 18.5 percent in 2010 to €951.9 billion ($1.3 trillion),297 leading the country out of recession. German net exports of goods contributed 1.4 percentage points to its 3.6 GDP growth in 2010, or 40 percent of the total increase.298 German exports to China soared by 44 percent, which could become Germany’s biggest export destination overall by 2015.299 Unemployment in Germany fell to an 18-year low in January 2011.300\n\nInnovation and a system for efficiently converting new technologies into marketable products and large-scale production are keys to this success.\n\nGermany’s innovation system is characterized by heavy corporate and government investment in research, innovative small- and medium-sized enterprises, extensive workforce training, and strong institutions such as Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft that collaborate with Germany industry. The government also works to assure that the nation is a “lead market” for important, emerging technologies through methods such as consumer incentives, government procurement, and standards. 301\n\nSuch policies have enabled Germany to become the world’s leading exporter of research-intensive products, according to the German Institute for Industrial Research (DIW Berlin). 302 More than 12 percent of Germany’s exports are research-intensive, double the level of the U.S.303 Programs promoting wide dissemination of environmental technologies have enabled German companies to capture 16 percent of world trade in that sector, which employs 1.5 million in Germany. Germany is a world leader in optics, a €2 billion industry that also has received significant public support. German machine tool makers are the world market leaders with a share of 19 percent. The nation has some 500 biotechnology companies, and the nanotechnology sector boasts 740 companies and 50,000 industrial jobs.304 Germany also ranks No. 4 in the world in patents granted.305\n\nOver the past decade, the German government has implemented an ambitious agenda designed to maintain the strength of Germany’s global competitiveness. Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has increased investments in R&D, which rose by one-third to €12 billion ($17.1 billion) from 2005 through 2008.306 Germany spent €80 billion in economic stimulus during the financial crisis, followed by a further €11 billion in stimulus that went to education and science and technology. Coming at a time when other nations were cutting back such spending in the face of recession, the major commitment to innovation represented “a paradigm shift of some importance” for Germany, explained Rainer Jäkel, director general for technology and innovation policy at the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (BMWi).307\n\nThe government also has been implementing a wide range of policies and programs to improve its innovation system. They include initiatives to—\n\nupgrade basic science,\n\nboost private R&D spending,\n\nstrengthen collaboration between universities and business,\n\nimprove the environment for high-tech start-ups, and\n\nnurture regional innovation clusters.\n\nThe government also has unveiled what it describes as Germany’s first comprehensive national innovation framework, High-Tech Strategy 2020, which seeks to consolidate public programs around well-defined missions.308\n\nSome of these efforts appear to be bearing fruit. Corporate investment in R&D surged from €2.3 billion in 2005 to an estimated €9.4 billion in 2008.309 Total R&D spending in Germany reached 2.82 percent of GDP in 2009, the highest level since reunification with Eastern Germany. [See ] The number of people employed in the German R&D sector rose by 15 percent, to 162,000, over that period, with further growth expected.310 A 2009 study by the German Association of Chambers of Industry and Commerce found that around 30 percent of all companies attribute their innovations to improved federal policy.311 The World Economic Forum ranks Germany No. 6 among 142 nations in global competitiveness, including No. 7 in innovation and No. 4 in business sophistication.312 In rankings by the Innovation Union, Germany places a close fourth behind Sweden, Denmark, and Finland, among the European Union’s 27 members, and No. 1 in terms of “innovators.”313\n\nFIGURE 5.10\n\nGermany’s R&D expenditures reached 2.82 percent of GDP in 2009. SOURCE: Eurostat, date of extraction was 10/29/2011.\n\nGerman innovation still faces a number of serious challenges, however. They include a scarcity of venture capital and bank loans for innovative companies, declining momentum in sectors such as electronics and aircraft, and weak performance in eastern Germany and Berlin, which consume a large share of federal research spending but produce relatively little innovation. 314 Germany ranks below most other industrialized nations in researchers as a percentage of total employment [See ], measures of international collaboration in research, and venture capital as a percentage of GDP.315 There also are fears of a looming skills shortage due declining university enrollment as the population ages and disinterest in science and technology fields grows among German youth.316 The Expert Commission on Research and Innovation, known by its German acronym EFI, reports an “urgent need to expand education, research and innovation” and warns that Germany’s global competitiveness is under threat. The EFI also contends that Germany’s tax system must become more innovation-friendly.317\n\nFIGURE 5.11\n\nGermany ranks below most other industrialized nations in researchers per 1,000 total employment. SOURCE: UNESCO, UNESCO Institute for Statistics, Science and Technology, Table 19. NOTE: Data are 2009 or most recent year.\n\nFor these reasons and others, a study by DIW Berlin rated Germany lower than did the WEF and Innovation Union—at only No. 9 among 17 leading industrialized nations in innovation capacity. While giving Germany strong marks in high technology and in research institutions, the study cited financing of innovative projects in particular as a “major barrier to innovation.” Aversion to risk is another constraint. The study noted that 42 percent of Germans think one should set up a business if there is a chance of failure, compared to nearly 70 percent of Koreans and Irish and 74 percent of Americans. The study rated Germany No. 11 in innovation policy, primarily for spending just 4.5 percent of GDP on education in 2005 compared to 6 percent in countries like Finland and Sweden. 318 And while R&D-intensive products are important in Germany’s foreign trade, “Germany has a marked weakness in foreign trade in the area of cutting-edge technologies.”319 German R&D-intensive products overall make a positive contribution to Germany’s foreign trade, but not in the most R&D-intensive areas. [See ]\n\nTABLE 5.2\n\nNet Contribution of R&D-Intensive Products to Germany’s Foreign Trade.\n\nThe government’s new national innovation strategy aims to address these shortcomings.\n\nThe German System\n\nGermany’s innovation system differs from that of the U.S. is several fundamental ways. While the U.S. has an “entrepreneurial economy,” explained Engelbert Beyer of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research’s Directorate for Innovation Strategies, Germany’s model is more oriented toward “solid, high-quality progress.”320 While labor and skilled talent easily move to other jobs in the U.S., mobility is more limited in Germany. In terms of federal science and technology policy, programs are dispersed across many agencies in the U.S. In Germany, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung), better known as the BMBF, has a broad portfolio that includes most federal R&D activities and programs to promote commercialization. The Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology, known by its German acronym BMWi, also has a range of technology and innovation programs.\n\nThe “innovation rhetoric” differs in Germany and the United States, too, Mr. Beyer said. In the U.S., it is generally believed that government should play a limited role in industry and commerce. In Germany, “it is quite common to refer to government as a problem solver,” Mr. Beyer said. Dr. Jäkel of BMWi pointed out that the German government has no qualms about providing “cradle to grave” financial assistance for R&D and commercialization efforts by small-and medium-sized enterprises in the case of “market failure” by private lenders. “The government has the right to intervene,” he said. “It is well known that the banks are not so supportive.”321\n\nThe German system also distributes its R&D investments very differently than the United States. While the U.S. innovation system seeks breakthroughs in a broad spectrum of sciences and technologies, most German R&D spending is on industries in which the country already is established, such as automobiles and machinery. The U.S. is great at “disruptive technologies and radical inventions,” explained German State Secretary for Education and Research Georg Schütte. “Germany is strong in gradual change.” The chief beneficiaries of Germany’s high focus on applied research are the Mittelstand, the small and medium-sized export manufacturers that are the nation’s “hidden champions” and that pursue market leadership in niches, he said. State Secretary Schütte noted that there is wide discussion in Germany whether this model is sustainable in light of growing shortages of skilled workers as the population ages and intensifying competition in manufacturing industries from East Asia. “Some people think we are sitting in the dining car,” he said.322\n\nThe emphasis on manufacturing and exports, however, has served Germany well over the past few years of global turbulence. The government’s response to the 2008–2009 global financial crisis and recession highlighted the importance that Germany places on preserving its manufacturing sector, which was hit hard. In the U.S., manufacturers laid off workers, who then sought public unemployment benefits. Germany, by contrast, subsidized manufacturing salaries so that staff could stay on payrolls while working part time. As a result, consumer spending and service industries remained robust through the recession, according to Klaus F. Zimmerman, former president of DIW Berlin. When recovery came, German exporters were able to quickly increase production and gain market share. 323\n\nThere are strong linkages between government-funded research and public-private commercialization activities. Nearly half of federal R&D funds go to national research institutes. They include the Max Planck Society, which conducts basic research, and the Helmholz-Gemeinschaft, which has a network of 17 major research centers on long-term scientific challenges such as health, energy, the environment, and transportation. The Leibniz Association, an umbrella organization of 87 independent state-controlled institutes, performs research on scientific issues of strategic importance, such as life sciences, natural sciences, and social sciences. Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft acts as a “technology bridge” to industry, in the words of Executive Director Roland Schindler.324\n\nFunding of research organizations is shared between the federal government and the states. This reflects changes to Germany’s constitution in 1946, when it was under Allied control. The constitution was designed to prevent the central government from having sole control over education. Overall, the German research system “is a system that works well, with a clear division of labor, varying degrees of autonomy and state control, and distinct research organizations whose activities partly overlap and partly are different,” explained Leibnitz Association President Karl Ulrich Mayer. One challenge, Mr. Mayer noted, is that many German state governments have weak tax bases, making it difficult for them to carry the educational funding load.325\n\nOne downside of Germany’s large science and technology bureaucracy is that it also is considered unwieldy. The two agencies that dominate policy, the BMBF and BMWi, collaborate in many realms but have tended to compete and duplicate each other’s work, as Stefan Kuhlmann of Fraunhofer ISI observed. He added that the BMBF’s immense array of technology and innovation programs so broad that they are difficult to track.326 The same is true of BMWi whose extensive portfolio sometimes overlaps with BMBF programs. Coordination among German’s big research institutions also has traditionally been spotty. In addition, the Länder—Germany’s 16 states--have their own research and technology programs.327\n\nForging a Common Strategy\n\nTo address these challenges, German leaders have been seeking to better coordinate the efforts of government, research organizations, and industry to improve innovation and the translation of technology into marketable products. In October 2003, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder summoned representatives of public agencies, policy circles, major companies, small business associations, major research organizations, and other stakeholders to debate challenges to German innovation. The forum led to formation of the Partnership for Innovation initiative, which aimed to define a national innovation framework.\n\nIn 2010, the German government unveiled High-Tech Strategy 2020, which it described as the country’s “first broad national concept in which the key stakeholders involved in innovation share a joint vision.” The primary goals are to build lead markets, bridge industry and science, and improve framework conditions such as access to early-stage finance, intellectual property protection, public procurement, and the ability of universities and research institutions to commercialize research. The plan aims to “stimulate Germany’s enormous scientific and economic potential in a targeted way and find solutions to global and national challenges”.328\n\nThe strategy is to coordinate government-funded research and innovation activities across all departments around five broad themes: climate and energy, health and nutrition, mobility, security, and communication. The government defines “forward-looking projects” in science, technology, and social development and detailed roadmaps to achieve each of the overarching missions over 10 to 15 years. These “projects” include developing technologies and services to make model regions “carbon-dioxide neutral,” development of smart grids and large power-storage systems, technologies that help people live well into old age, deploying electric vehicles on Germany roads by 2020, and developing new work organization models that allow people to remain productive longer. 329\n\nThe national strategy incorporates a number of national innovation programs and initiatives to achieve these goals. They include programs to develop specific technologies, promote regional innovation clusters, upgrade higher education and scientific research, forge “innovation alliances” among corporations and universities, support small enterprises, and launch technology startups. German activities in energy and the environment, information and communications technology, and transportation illustrate how high-minded policy goals are integrated with strategies to develop globally competitive export industries.\n\nEnergy Efficiency: By 2020, the federal government proposes to reduce Germany’s greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent below 1990 levels and to double energy productivity. It also has set a target of having renewable energy meet 18 percent of gross energy consumption and provide for 35 percent of electricity by 2020. By 2050, greenhouse gasses are to be 80 percent below 1990 levels, while renewable sources will account for 60 percent of total consumption and 80 percent of electricity generation.330\n\nTo achieve those goals, there are detailed “fields of action.” They include investing aggressively in renewable sources such as offshore wind power and bioenergy; expanding nuclear energy and promoting clean coal-fired plants; upgrading the national power grid; research and incentive programs to promote energy efficiency in industry, buildings, and households; aggressively promoting green transportation; and expanding R&D in innovative new energy technologies. Recognizing that the global market for energy-efficiency and environmental products is projected to reach €2.2 trillion by 2020, the BMBF,331 BMWi, Fraunhofer, and other organizations also have ambitious programs to commercialize technology through regional innovation clusters, public-private research alliances,332 and small-business assistance.\n\nGovernment measures to establish Germany as a “lead market” for new energy technologies also help German industry attain scale in emerging industries. High feed-in tariffs for all renewable energy were instrumental in making Germany a leader in photovoltaic manufacturing, for example.333 Even though Germany only receives about as much sunlight as Alaska, its photovoltaic manufacturing industry outperforms that of the U.S. by a factor of six, noted John Lushetsky, director of the Solar Energy Program of the U.S. Department of Energy. As a result of the scale of investment, solar modules in Germany cost around half of what they do in the United States.334 The BMBF predicts that the renewable-energies sector could employ up to 500,000 people by 2020, and that exports of renewable-energy products will rise from €500 million in 2007 to €9 billion by 2020.335\n\nPartnerships for Transportation Technology: Germany is a global leader in automobiles, high-speed train systems, and other transportation equipment. By setting a target of having 1 million electric vehicles by 2020, the government wants to make Germany a lead market in electric mobility and associated information systems. As the center of Europe’s automotive industry, Germany in a good position to provide momentum for new technologies, the marketability of innovative vehicles, light-weight construction methods for aircraft, and development of global standards.\n\nTo this end, German public-private partnerships are investing in a wide range of transportation-related technologies. There is a national plan to develop lithium-ion technologies for electric-car batteries and for hydrogen fuel cells, for example.336 Concerted research and product-development programs are underway in new drive systems, fuels, satellite navigation systems, traffic-control networks, mobile electronic services, and logistic concepts, among other fields.337\n\nInformation and communication technologies: The Federal Government’s new ICT five-year plan sets out a broad agenda to “better harness the large potential of ICT for growth and employment in Germany.” 338 Broad goals include wiring the country with high-performance broadband networks of at least 50 megabits per second that will reach three-quarters of the population by the end of 2014 and the entire country as soon as possible. They also include deploying state-of-the-art, smart IT networks and services across industries and enabling paper-free government by 2012.\n\nThe ICT Strategy for 2015 calls for accelerating development of flagship projects, such as a super high-speed Internet service, digital data protection technologies, and intelligent networks for education, energy, mobility, public administration, and tourism. Public-private research projects, “innovation alliances,” and research contracts are devoted to virtual reality, cloud computing, intelligent autonomous devices, connected household appliances, smart national identity cards. Various Germany government agencies also support programs to support ICT startups, provide expert help for small-and medium-sized businesses, vocational training, and export promotion for ICT-enabled services. The government envisions that such services can add 30,000 jobs.339\n\nImproving Germany’s Innovation System\n\nBeyond the broad technology goals and industrial-development targets, Germany is pursuing a range of initiatives aimed at improving the nation’s ability to innovate and disseminate new technologies more quickly and efficiently. The intent is to strengthen the linkage between the creation of knowledge and creation of products, explained Bernhard Milow, director of the German Aerospace Center’s energy program. “Our view is that if we continue with the innovation process we have today, we cannot achieve our goals because it is too slow.”340 These initiatives include upgrading the quality of university research and commercialization, regional innovation clusters, public-private research alliances, promotion of small and midsized business, and improving the environment for enterprises.\n\nUnleashing Universities and Research Institutes: The federal government and Länder—which control funding for higher education--have taken a number of steps over the past decade to upgrade the quality of university research, break down barriers between academia and industry, and commercialize university R&D. “A high-wage country needs to invest in education, universities, and research to foster innovation,” explained former DIW president Zimmerman. “This is what you have to do to maintain competitiveness.” 341\n\nA turning point was the Knowledge Creates Markets initiative in 2001 to create a “broad-based patenting and exploitation infrastructure.” 342 Among other things, universities were given ownership of intellectual property created by academics, along the lines of the U.S. Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. The reform made it easier for universities to create larger portfolios of technologies and compete with top U.S. universities.343 To help universities commercialize research and negotiate contracts, Patent Marketing Agencies were set up in each state, with the federal and Länder governments splitting the costs. These agencies also pooled resources into a national network called TechnologieAllianz e. V., which provides services to 200 scientific institutions with more than 100,000 scientists.344\n\nMajor research institutes such as Max Planck, meanwhile, have been given greater leeway to commercialize their research. The Freedom of Science Act gives these institutions more latitude to manage their own financial resources. Also, compensation for researchers no longer is restricted by government civil-service rules.345 However, these institutes are expected to orient more of their research around missions defined by the national High-Tech Strategy.\n\nResearch universities have received substantial funding increases under several major programs. The Initiative for Excellence, for example, is a €1.9 billion, five-year federal program run by the German Research Foundation that allocates funding on a competitive basis to promote cutting-edge research, collaboration among institutions and disciplines, and international research alliances. One goal is to create a set of elite Germany universities.346 So far, the initiative has granted funds to 44 graduate schools to expand research by young scientists, “clusters of excellence” based at universities, and eight “universities of excellence” that have developed “future concepts” for high-level research. 347 The initiative is expected to create 4,000 new positions. As a result of the program, “universities have moved to the center of the German science system,” according to a BMBF report. The federal government and Länder have approved another €2.7 billion in funding through 2017.348\n\nAnother goal is to sharply increase enrollment in higher education. Under the Higher Education Pact 2020, the federal government and Länder will provide €26,000 per place until 2015 to help create new positions for up to 275,000 first-semester students in tertiary institutions.349\n\nRegional Innovation Clusters: Research programs in Germany have tended to be dispersed across the country, making it difficult to develop regional innovation clusters that commercialize new technologies.350 Several public-private initiatives have sought to form regional innovation clusters in emerging industries. The Fraunhofer institutes are leading a government effort to help consolidate research activities into 16 innovation clusters. An emerging bioenergy cluster based in North Rhine-Westphalia district, for example, has 17 regional partners from industry and academia. Other innovation clusters that the Fraunhofer institutes are helping to organize include one in optical technologies based in Jena, electronics for sustainable energy based in Nuremberg, turbine-production technologies based in Aachen, and digital production based in Stuttgart.351\n\nThe BMBF also has a program to support regional innovation clusters. In 2007, the ministry launched the Top Cluster competition in which industry-led strategic partnerships around Germany vied for €200 million in BMBF funds. The first five winners were an aviation cluster forming in the Hamburg region, Solar Valley in Mitteldeutschland (Middle Germany), energy-efficiency innovations in Saxony, and electronics and cell-and molecular-based medicine in the Rhine-Neckar metropolitan region.352\n\nInnovation Alliances: New forms of German public-private partnerships are being encouraged to advance new technologies. One initiative is called “innovation alliances.” Under the program, corporations must decide at the board level to co-invest with government. The German government is investing €500 million and private industry €2.6 billion in nine such alliances. Government funds are typically leveraged five-fold through private investment. An initiative for a cluster in molecular imaging for medical engineering, for example, includes Bayer Schering Pharma, Goehringer Ingelheim Pharma, and Siemens. The alliance, which has a €900 million research budget, seeks to create new diagnostic products and imaging procedures for clinics at the molecular and cell level. Other such alliances focus on automotive electronics, energy-efficient lighting using organic light-emitting diodes, organic photovoltaic cells, and lithium-ion batteries for energy storage.353\n\nBioIndustry 2021 is another such initiative. Launched by the BMBF in 2008, the program allocates funds to strategic partnerships between scientific organizations and industry aimed at speeding up the translation of ideas and research findings into marketable products. The federal government, industry, and Länder contribute funds. Five clusters have been selected. One is Hamburg-based Biocatlaysis2021, devoted to manufacturing chemicals, cosmetics, foods, and detergents. It includes 19 small-and medium-sized companies, 22 academic research groups, and seven agencies. 354\n\nReinvigorating Small Business: More than one-quarter of innovation expenditure in German manufacturing and nearly half in knowledge-intensive businesses are by Mittelstand businesses. Small and medium-sized manufacturers are regarded as the backbone of Germany’s advanced industrial sector. Many have been run by the same families for three or four generations, frequently reinventing themselves to keep up with the times, and tend to be “be long-term minded when it comes to research and developed,” noted BWMi official Jäkel.355 Middelstand companies also tend to be anchored in their regions and maintain close ties with local universities and research institutes, and therefore “won’t easily relocate from one country to another.” Small and medium-sized enterprises are especially important in Germany’s biotechnology, optical, nanotechnology, and information technology sectors. Still, the vast majority of SMEs spend little on regular R&D, according to Germany’s Center for European Economic Research.356 Mr. Jäkel cited difficulty raising funds for R&D from banks as a major reason.\n\nThe government is seeking to increase R&D by smaller companies by connecting them to federal research programs and through expanded financial subsidies. In 2008, several SME-related activities within the BMWi were consolidated into the Central Innovation Programme SME, known by its German acronym ZIM.357 One of those BMWi programs, Pro Inno, was established in 1999 and had distributed research grants to thousands of firms and more than 240 research organizations. An evaluation by Fraunhofer praised Pro Inno’s high transparency, easy access, and relative lack of bureaucracy and found that some three-fourths of participating firms would not have conducted the R&D had it not been for the program.358\n\nZIM has an annual budget of around €300 million, and it received an additional €900 million through Germany’s economic stimulus program in 2009 and 2010. It also expanded its services to include larger companies with up to 1,000 employees. ZIM’s stated goals are to encourage SMEs to dedicate more efforts to innovation, reduce the risks of technology-based projects, and rapidly commercialize research.359 ZIM has different programs to support cooperative research projects between enterprises and research organizations, R&D commercialization projects by individual SMEs, and innovative networks involving at least six companies. ZIM offers grants of up to €350,000 covering 35 percent to 50 percent of R&D costs, depending on the company’s size and location. The program is not limited to technologies or sectors. Research institutions that cooperate with these firms can receive grants covering their entire costs up to €175,000.360 As of late 2010, ZIM had allocated €1.4 billion in grants that were matched by €1.5 billion in SME contributions. 361 The program receives around 6,000 applications a year.\n\nThe BMBF has its own SME innovation program, KMU-Innovativ. It focuses on biotechnology, information and communications, nanotechnology, optics, energy, and production research. KMU-Innovativ also offers research grants and helps SMEs get better access to federal research funding. One objective of the program is to lower the technological and financial track record requirements that had prevented many smaller enterprises from competing for research funds.362\n\nEarly-Stage Capital\n\nThe BMBF declares that “Germany needs to go back to being a country of start-ups.”363 The paucity of venture capital in Germany is a “major bottleneck” to achieving this goal, explained Dietmar Harhoff, chairman of the Commission of Experts for Research and Innovation, whose annual reports have detailed shortcomings in Germany’s entrepreneurship environment. In the U.S., Dr. Harhoff noted, young inventors seeking to start a company often go to angel investors. In Germany, they often go to the government—or abroad.364\n\nTo address this goal, the government has taken several moves to help make more capital available to start-ups. In 2005, the BMBF formed a €272 million public-private capital partnership called the High-Tech Start-ups Fund. Participants include BMWi, KfW Bank Group, BASF, Deutsche Telekom, Siemens, Robert Bosch, and Daimler. The fund invests up to €500,000 in new, promising companies. The goal is to support young companies for up to two years from the R&D stage through development of proof of concept and even market entry, by which time it is hoped that private financing will be available. In its first five years, the fund has pledged to take holdings in 177 technology companies.365\n\nThe BWMi has its own program to aid start-ups, called EXIST. The program helps universities build infrastructure to assist technology-and knowledge-based ventures. EXIST also provides stipends of up to €2,500 a year for equipment, materials, coaching, and childcare to scientists and students who wish to develop business ideas. EXIST’s Transfer of Research program provides grants for up to 18 months for technology startups.366 BMWi official Jäkel said this public-private model has proved very successful and that private ventures “have really gone on board.” Now BWMi is setting up a second fund that will have contributions from at least 10 German companies.367\n\nInternational Cooperation\n\nRecognizing that Germany cannot attain its broad technology goals on its own, the government’s innovation policies devote considerable attention to international cooperation. There are more than 50 bilateral agreements between German and U.S. institutions.368 In February 2010, Germany and the U.S. signed their first umbrella science-and-technology agreement and signed memorandums of understanding in the fields of energy and cancer research.369 The German government also recently opened the German Center for Research and Innovation in New York and broke ground on the Max Planck Florida Institute in Florida. German and American scientists collaborate on numerous programs, such as the German Electronic Synchrotron, the Large Hadron Collider at the European Organization for Nuclear Research, and on what is described as the world’s most powerful spallation neutron source SNS under construction at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The German government is seeking to expand such partnerships.370 German Minister of State Werner Hoyer noted that Germany and the U.S. face several immense common technological challenges, such as the need to develop renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and safeguard their nations from terrorism and other asymmetrical threats. “We are more likely to succeed if we combine our resources and technology,” Minster Hoyer said.371\n\nRemaining Challenges\n\nDespite the abundance of innovation initiatives and programs, there are concerns that Germany isn’t moving fast enough in some areas. DIW Berlin projects that the nation will have a shortfall of 270,000 skilled workers by 2020,372 for example. A recent study by the Cologne Institute for Economic Research estimated that Germany’s skills shortage costs the economy up to €20 billion a year, or one percentage point of GDP.373 In addition to spending more on education, the authors assert Germany should be more open to immigration. Non-EU residents wishing to work in Germany must have a yearly income of €80,000, for example. The study estimates Germany’s GDP could increase by up to €100 billion by 2020 if it relaxed immigration rules for skilled workers.\n\nThe Experts Commission on Research and Innovation calls for dispensing with income thresholds and instead linking admission to immigrants’ qualifications. The commission also notes that many German scientists leave the country after they graduate, while not many foreign scientists move to Germany. It calls for the government to find ways to retain and recruit top talent. The commission also says the government must do more to encourage more German youth to study mathematics, engineering, and science, where college enrollment is declining.374\n\nGermany’s tax policies also are cited as a disincentive to investment. Germany cut its corporate tax rate from 38.65 percent to 29.83 percent in 2007, placing it near the median point of European economies. But the Experts Commission notes that Germany is one of few industrial nations that do not offer a tax credit for R&D. The commission blames tax policies for falling R&D investment by small-and medium-sized enterprises and the scarcity of private risk capital. The commission asserts that shortages of angel funding and venture capital could worsen unless Germany adopts an “internationally competitive, growth-promoting tax framework.”375\n\nAlthough technology transfer from universities and research institutes has improved in recent decades, there still is room for improvement. The Expert Commission calls for strengthening the autonomy of universities and research institutes, freeing scientists from public-service regulations, and allowing professors to use their time more flexibly, such as by making teaching requirements less rigid.376 The commission also suggests that universities create performance-related incentives for scientists and transfer of team members and to ease constraints on university and research institution participation in spinoffs companies.\n\nFlanders\n\nOpenness and an emphasis on public-private partnership pervade the innovation system of Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium. This approach has made Flanders, with its population of only about six million, an influential voice in technology policy in Europe.\n\nFlanders’ official strategy is to become “a region where businesses establish their research centers and where high-tech companies can develop.”377 To accomplish this, Flanders has adopted a cohesive strategy that combines strong public funding for science and technology, high-level guidance, and strong bottom-up input from industry. Its assets include a well-educated and multi-lingual workforce, strong higher education system, first-rate transportation and logistical infrastructure, and central location in Europe.378\n\nThe government is investing heavily in its universities and a range of new organizations to develop human resources and spur commercialization of knowledge. The government also provides early-stage financing for small and midsized enterprises and spreads the innovation message relentlessly through schools and the media.\n\nBox 5.4The German Fraunhofer Institutes\n\nFraunhofer-Gesellschaft has been a major factor behind Germany’s continued export success in advanced industries despite high labor costs. Established in 1949 as part of the effort to rebuild of Germany’s research infrastructure,379 the non-profit organization is one of the world’s largest and most successful applied technology agencies. Fraunhofer’s 80 research institutes and centers in Germany and around the world employ some 17,000 people—4,000 of them with Ph. Ds and master’s students—and has a $2.3 billion (€1.62 billion) annual budget.380\n\nThe mission, in the words of Executive Director Roland Schindler, is to act as a “technology bridge” to German industry.381 Although Fraunhofer researchers publish scientific papers and secure patents—they filed 685 applications in 2009—their primary mission is to disseminate and commercialize technology. Most of the organization’s remarkable range of applied-research programs, which span microsystems, life sciences, communications, energy, new materials, and security, focus on clearly identified market opportunities and collaboration with German manufacturers.\n\nFraunhofer institutes offer a broad portfolio of services to its 5,000 corporate clients. Fraunhofer engineers develop intellectual property on a contract basis, hone product prototypes and industrial processes, and work with manufacturers on the factory floor to help implement new production methods. The institutes also can conduct market research and offer consulting services. Some Mittelstand manufacturers—the small and medium-sized enterprises that are the backbone of Germany’s high-value export sector—have been Fraunhofer clients for generations. Nearly one-third of clients have 250 or fewer employees.382\n\nA major source of Fraunhofer’s strength and durability has been its diverse funding base, which enables its institute to perform their own in-house cutting-edge research, remain engaged in strategic national innovation programs, and collaborate with industry. Federal government and state funding, which covers one-third of its budget, has been stable and has steadily increasing, enabling Fraunhofer to plan for the long term, Dr. Schindler explained. Another third of Fraunhofer’s revenue comes from manufacturing clients. Fraunhofer’s 59 Institutes of Applied Research in Germany collaborate closely with manufacturers in 16 different clusters. The federal government generally matches funds raised from industry. Half of the industry contracts are with small and medium-sized enterprises. When contracted to perform research, institutes agree to meet deadlines, milestones, and deliverables. Customers own the intellectual property.\n\nThe remaining third comes from publicly funded research projects that it wins on a competitive basis from the German government and the European Union. These keep Fraunhofer at the forefront of developing technologies meeting national and European Union priorities. Fraunhofer institutes own the intellectual property resulting from German government-funded research.\n\nThe diversity also enables Fraunhofer to use different approaches to commercialize technology. One way is by helping develop specific technologies for companies. Schott Solar, for instance, contracted with Fraunhofer to develop technology for absorber tubes used in solar receivers that now are being exported out of Schott’s factory in Albuquerque, N. M. Fraunhofer earned Industrial research revenue of $654 million in 2009.383\n\nFraunhofer commercializes technology developed through in-house research or through its numerous R&D collaborations in Germany and abroad. Recent Fraunhofer lab inventions for industry include touch-controlled organic light-emitting diode (OLED) lighting, artificial animal tissue for drug testing, lightweight bicycle seat posts, new steel-cutting techniques for car manufacturers, micro-helicopters, and ultra-efficient gem-cutting tools.384 One of the most lucrative Fraunhofer success labs is an algorithm co-developed with AT&T Bell Labs and other collaborators to reduce the size of audio files used in MP3 players. The institute earned several hundred millions from licensing the digital-compression technology.385 In 1999, the organization set up Fraunhofer Ventures, a consulting service for start-ups credited with assisting 150 spinoffs.386\n\nThe technological diversity of Fraunhofer institutes also enables them to pursue promising niches in hybrid industries, such as the integration of multimedia technologies with medical devices. The Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute, which specializes in information and communications technology, has been developing 3-dimensional imaging, sensor, and communication network technologies with many possible medical applications. Engineers have developed immersive displays that can allow a surgeon to view a 3-D image of a heart without wearing special glasses, for example, and to manipulate the images by moving his or her fingers. The institute also is developing a handheld devise using Terahertz waves to probe for cancer cells inside the body.387\n\nAnother element of Fraunhofer’s success is its ability to strike a balance between coordination of its German institutes with management autonomy. The Fraunhofer Group for Microelectronics, which has a $285 million annual budget, coordinates 12 Fraunhofer institutes working on topics such as automation and smart-system integration. The Information and Communication Technology group has 14 member institutes, including digital media, e-business software, and traffic and mobility. A production group coordinates R&D activities of seven institutes. Other institutes collaborate on the emerging field of flexible electronics, another Fraunhofer strength. The Institute for Photonic Microsystems and Institute for Electron Beam and Plasma Technology, for example, have demonstrated what it is billed as the first successful roll-to-roll manufacturing system that deposits OLED materials on sheets of aluminum, a process with wide potential applications for solar cells, memory systems, sensors, lighting, and other devices.388\n\nAt the same time, Fraunhofer’s headquarters tries to give its institutes the latitude needed set their own direction in developing technologies and responding to opportunities. “Headquarters does not tell institutes what to do. We try to give them as much autonomy as possible,” explained Anke Hellwig, liaison office for Fraunhofer USA’s seven U.S. centers. “We try to keep a very delicate balance between the institutes having their own culture and with a Fraunhofer culture and branding.”389\n\nHeadquarters appoints institute directors and imposes guidelines. For example, each institute director must also serve as the department chair at a local university in order to maintain strong links with academia. Headquarters allocates funding to each institute based on performance, using a formula that is heavy weighted toward their ability to raise funds from industry and research work. “We support the institutes that are successful in the market and want them to grow further,” Ms. Hellwig explained. Revenue from industry must range from between 25 percent to 70 percent. If the institute operates below that number for several years or run steady deficits, headquarters could dissolve an institute or transfer operations to another organization.390\n\nRetaining talent also is a challenge because the pay scales of scientists and engineers are dictated by German civil service rules. On the one hand, a certain level of staff turnover is good for Fraunhofer as well as German industry. For engineering graduates, the opportunity for landing jobs at top German technology collaborating with Fraunhofer is a major assure of joining the organization. Fraunhofer alumni at German companies also help provide the institutes with relationships for new business. German industry, meanwhile, gets a pipeline of talent in emerging technologies. The abundance of Fraunhofer engineers with experience in solar cell and module manufacturing helped Germany establish itself in that industry. “Part of the secret of the photovoltaic industry is that the workforce was present when this industry developed,” Dr. Schindler explained.391\n\nOn the other hand, Fraunhofer also needs experienced engineers and executives.\n\nInstitute directors coming from private industry general take steep pay cuts, but they can earn outside income as consultants. The institutes also offer some flexibility for researchers who want to try their hand at becoming entrepreneurs but are wary of completely abandoning the security of their Fraunhofer positions. Researchers can take leaves of absence to join a company. If they decide to return within two years, they can have their jobs back.392\n\nOne of Fraunhofer’s new strategic thrusts is to extend its brand overseas. Fraunhofer has opened a number of centers in the U.S. specializing in different fields. In Plymouth, Mich., Fraunhofer USA has a state-of-the-art center to develop laser technologies, components, and systems. It also has joined with Michigan State University to open a center for advanced coatings and laser technology applications. The Fraunhofer Center for Sustainable Energy Systems (CSE), based in Cambridge, Mass., is a non-profit applied research and development lab dedicated to commercializing clean energy technologies. Another center in Brookline, Mass., focuses on manufacturing innovation. A Fraunhofer center in Delaware focuses on molecular biotechnology. A center at the University of Maryland develops software.393 In these centers, Fraunhofer engineers work with nearby manufacturers to develop prototypes. It also evaluates company research projects and provides some funding. 394 Fraunhofer also recently opened a testing center for solar panels in Albuquerque, N. M., that it says will speed entry of North American manufacturers in the world market.395\n\nFraunhofer also is rolling out a program in the U.S. to help energy startups. Called TechBridge, the program aims to bridge the gap between laboratory research to wide-scale production without having to sacrifice intellectual property rights.396 It offers design and modeling expertise, equipment, and access to Fraunhofer facilities in Germany. Fraunhofer’s U.S. institutes earned $25 million in revenue in 2010 and expect to bring in $30 million in 2011.397 “I see a huge market for this kind of research in the United States,” Ms. Hellwig said.\n\n379\n\nFor a history of the organization, see, 60 Years of Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, Munich: Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, 2009.

Some 10 percent of R&D expenditures as of 2005 in Flanders involved industry partnerships with academia, compared to 6.9 percent in the EU and 6.3 percent in the U.S.398 Flanders has initiated a variety of new public-private partnership programs in recent years to promote collaboration further.399 They include regional innovation “cooperation networks,” centers for collective research that serve traditional industries, and “competency poles” that often are located near universities. Finland also has strategic research centers for microelectronics, biotechnology, energy and environment, and broadband technology.400 Each center has a mandate to work with the private sector, and is allowed to collaborate with foreign companies as long as they contribute to the Flemish economy. Chambers of commerce and labor unions also are involved in regional efforts.\n\nRe-orienting higher education to add commercialization to its traditional functions of teaching and research has been another key thrust of Flemish policy. The region has seven universities, 22 non-university institutions of higher education, and five university-based institutes of higher education designed specifically to diffuse knowledge. The new emphasis on commercialization represents “a very big sea change” to centuries-old institutions, noted Free University of Brussels professor Bruno de Vuyst.401 A study by Van Looy and Koenraad Debackere found that technology-transfer activities do not detract from the amount or quality of basic scientific research. In fact, technology transfer tends to support publication of more research papers. Groups that collaborate reinforce their scientific research because industrial partners present academics with real problems. 402\n\nTo incentivize universities, the government provides block grants to institutions that strive to meet performance metrics such as increased numbers of spin-offs, patent applications, and contracts. “Performance-based funding is the key,” explained Fientje Moerman, former Minister for Economy, Enterprise, Science, Innovation, and Foreign Trade.403 To speed up the process, the Flemish Innovation Agency was set up in 1991. The agency acts as a “one-stop shop for innovation,” offering direct financing for technology-related R&D and coordinating other innovation efforts of the Flemish government. It also provides services for new business.\n\nIn 2003, the government drew up an Innovation Pact between academia and industry. The pact urged all parties to boost R&D investment to meet the EU target of 3 percent of GDP.404 After a study by the Flemish Science Policy Council two years later found that old barriers between academia and business remained, the government introduced two new innovative mechanisms. In 2004, it established an €11 million Industrial Research Fund to encourage universities to hire post-doctoral staff to conduct further research on findings deemed to have high potential for near-term market application. Each university creates its own portfolio of industry-oriented projects. The government also instructed each university to set up a technology-transfer office. The Flemish government introduced a program to place young academic researchers into industry and to support Ph. D. students wishing to launch their own companies.405\n\nThe Katholieke University Leuven, or K. U. Leuven, has an especially interesting system to encourage industry collaboration. The university’s 50 research divisions, which include faculty from different departments, can reinvest proceeds from industrial involvement into equipment, infrastructure, and stipends of post-doctoral students. The university also has 40 staff offering management, information-technology, and advisory help to start-ups. Leuven Inc., as it is called, has spun off more than 100 companies.406\n\nTo strengthen the flow of knowledge from universities to business, the Flanders government in 2006 launched a large €232 million program for strategic basic research of benefit to industry, the non-profit sector, and government policy objectives. The biggest investments in this program go to four high-level research institutes: Interuniversity Micro-Electronics Centers (IMEC), the Flemish Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), and the Research Center for Broadband Technology (IBBT).\n\nIMEC is the most globally prominent of these Flemish research organizations. Established in Leuven in 1984, IMEC is one of the largest semiconductor research partnerships in the world and strives to be a “worldwide center of excellence,” according to IMEC Chairman Anton de Proft.407 About half of IMEC’s revenue, which reached €275 million in 2009, comes from contracts with international industry. The Flemish government and the European Commission also are big contributors.408 IMEC has more than 1,750 staff and more than 550 resident and guest researchers from around the world.409\n\nThe center emphasizes pre-competitive R&D by bringing together researchers from industry and academia related to areas such as chip design, processing, packaging, microsystems, and nanotechnology that may not meet industry needs for three to 10 years.410 [See ] As a result, IMEC enables its partners, who include Texas Instruments, ST Microelectronics, Infineon, Micron, Samsung, Panasonic, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, Intel, and a number of equipment makers to undertake risky research they may not do on their own. Given the high cost and long time horizons of chip research, partnerships like the one with IMEC are essential to sustaining the semiconductor industry, according to Allen Bowling of Texas Instruments.411 In August 2010, Intel announced it was investing in a new ExaScience Lab in Leuven with IMEC, the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology, and five Flemish universities that aim to achieve breakthroughs in power-reduction software to run on future computers delivering 1,000 times the performance of today’s machines.412\n\nTABLE 5.3\n\nIMEC—Major Areas of Research.\n\nFlanders’ biotech facility, the Interuniversity Institute for Biotechnology (VIB), has an equally ambitious mandate to translate research into innovative industry. Until VIB was founded, “we had a lot of activity, but no translation from the universities to the economic growth of Flanders,” explained Lieve Ongena, VIB’s senior science advisor. “VIB was given a compound mission designed to overcome that problem.”413 The €62 million institute, formed in 1995, invests in basic research, training of researchers, commercialization of discoveries, and explanation of science to the public.\n\nVIB now has 60 research groups in nine departments, and 50/50 cost- and profit-sharing partnerships with its four universities. It focuses on work of “strategic importance,” such as cancer, cardiovascular biology, neurodegenerative disorders, inflammatory diseases, growth and development, proteomics, and bioinformatics. The VIB supports 850 scientists and technicians, of whom 300 are Ph. D candidates. It has helped launch companies that have developed microscopic worms for drug discovery, a drug-targeting tool using camel antibodies and another using a bacterium as a living drug-delivery tool. Start-ups had raised more than €220 million in venture capital as of 2006.\n\nAnother organization that partners with industry is the Flemish Institute for Technology Research, Belgium’s premier research center for energy, the environment, and materials.414 The Research Centre for Broadband Technology, established in 2004 as a “virtual” center to help Flanders become a leader in information and communications technology. Its mission is to develop multidisciplinary talent and perform demand-driven research for industry and government, with an emphasis on health care. Business partners include Philips, Siemens, and Alcatel. The center hopes to recoup its investment through licensing and spinoffs, in which IBBT typically retains a 5 percent interest. The institute’s goal is “to stimulate economic activity,” according to General Manager Wim de Waele.415\n\nThe government has a raft of programs in addition to these institutes to spur innovation and commercialization. One subsidizes industry-initiated cooperative ventures that aim to commercialize or add value to corporate research. Another supports economic networks that encourage innovation. The Flemish Innovation Cooperative Ventures program supports collective research, technological services, and projects that foster innovation for particular issues or in sub-regions.\n\nFlanders also has programs aimed at addressing an aversion to entrepreneurial risk on the part of the domestic financial sector and business community, which is regarded as a serious obstacle to innovation.416 The government created a program in 2001 called Arkimedes, which provides government guarantees and tax credits for investments in certain small-denomination bonds. Money raised in the bond offerings goes into a “pool of pools” that is invested in several R&D funds. As with a venture capital fund, the risk is spread among a number of companies. The program is too young to draw conclusions about its effectiveness.417\n\nOne question about Flanders’ approach is whether its open attitude toward R&D generates enough domestic industrial activity. Although IMEC plays an important role in international semiconductor research, for example, there is debate over whether it is establishing a semiconductor cluster in Belgium, which was the center’s original mission in 1984. There have been at least 20 spinoffs from IMEC through 2002, noted Kenneth S. Flamm of the University of Texas at Austin, only a few related to devices, materials, or equipment manufacturing. None were major players in their sectors, Dr. Flamm said.418\n\nIMEC Chairman de Proft noted while the economic impact so far is hard to measure directly, it is several times the level of government funding. He also said that the institute’s concentration of 300 top researchers and 200 Ph.D. students from around the world are likely to make an impact as they develop networks and rise through their organizations.419 Another indication of success, he noted, is that other nations have mimicked the public-private model of IMEC and other Flemish research institutions.\n\nFinland\n\nDespite its population of just 5.4 million, Finland has emerged as a global leader in innovation, consistently ranking the near top of the World Economic Forum’s annual Global Competitiveness Index.420 Finland has been rated as Europe’s most innovative business environment.421 This has enabled the nation to restructure an economy that depended on pulp and paper for two-thirds of its exports in the 1960s to one dominated by electronics, most notably telecommunications equipment. Finland’s economy also has grown faster than the OECD average both before and after the 2008 recession.422\n\nMuch of the credit goes to far-sighted government technology policies initiated in the 1980s that focus both on scientific research and on disseminating new technologies to industry. As a result, a close “Triple Helix” relationship has developed among Finnish universities, private industry, and government funding agencies.423 In 1981, R&D accounted for around 1.2 percent of Finland’s GDP. R&D intensity increased significantly in the mid-1990s and by 2009 had risen to 4 percent of GDP, one of the highest levels in the world, before falling slightly to 3.9 percent in 2010.424 [See ] Private companies accounted for 70 percent of Finnish R&D spending in 2009, or €4.85billion.425 Between 1992 and 2008, Finland’s annual exports of high-tech products leapt more than five-fold, to €11.4 billion.426 But high-technology exports fell sharply in 2009 and 2010 as electronics and telecommunications products fell dramatically, primarily mobile phone sales. [See ] In addition to electronics and telecom equipment, Finland achieved dramatic export growth in energy technologies and chemicals.427\n\nFIGURE 5.12\n\nFinland’s R&D intensity reached 4 percent in 2009 before declining slightly to 3.9 percent in 2010.

(more...)\n\nFIGURE 5.13\n\nFinnish exports of high-technology products fell sharply in 2009 and 2010. SOURCE: National Board of Customs, Finland, (Tullihallitus, Tilastoyksikkö), March 21, 2011.\n\nFinland’s innovation system is guided by the Science and Technology Council, which issues broad technology investment recommendations every three years that other ministries and agencies use as guidelines for setting funding priorities. The council is chaired by Finland’s prime minister and includes five cabinet ministers and representatives from industry, unions, and academia. There is a high degree of coordination between the Academy of Finland, which funds basic research, and Tekes, a Ministry of Trade and Industry agency that funds applied-research collaborations between the public and private sectors.\n\nFinland’s high competitiveness rankings are attributable to the close link between national research programs and industry, according to Tekes Deputy Director General Heikki Kotilainen. Even though the government accounts for only 10 percent of total R&D spending, it has been essential to stimulating R&D investment by companies. “You cannot jump from pure science to innovation immediately,” Dr. Kotilainen said.428\n\nTekes estimates that government investments in research have yielded a return of around 20 times for the Finnish economy. In 2009, Tekes estimated its R&D investments contributed to more than 900 new products and services, the introduction of 328 production processes, 709 patent applications, and 775 academic theses.429 According to Tekes customer surveys, more than half of small and mid-sized companies and 60 percent of large companies said research projects completed in 2006 led to commercial success.430 Outcomes of collaborations with industry include Finnish companies that have developed lactose-free milk products, high-end computer monitors, recyclable bio composites that are used in everything from furniture to musical instruments, equipment for recovering oil from offshore spills, and bio-carbon derived from wood and agro biomass that is said to be equal to high-quality coal as a fuel source.431\n\nTekes’ approach to R&D funding illustrates the Triple Helix method. Rather than act as a regulator and coordinator of Finnish innovation, the agency views itself as a partner, networker, and investor, Dr. Kotilainen explained. Of the €579 million Tekes invested in 2009, €343 million went directly to enterprises. Small and midsized companies received 61 percent of those funds, and 87 percent of those companies have fewer than 500 enterprises. Funding applications by Finnish companies leapt by 40 percent in 2009.432 Other funds go to universities, national research universities, and early-stage financing for start-ups.\n\nWhether the applicant is a university or private company, Tekes favors projects that involve cooperation between the two sectors. Private companies are required to provide matching funds when participating in university research. Companies receive credit if they invite universities to join their own research projects. Sometimes companies and universities pool their R&D personnel. Tekes tends to divide its funds between established R&D projects that can involve multiple companies and universities and unsolicited project proposals. The agency also promotes international collaborations.\n\nIntegration of basic and applied research is an important feature of Finland’s innovation system. Tekes and the Academy of Finland, for example, fund university and corporate-led programs simultaneously to help insure that basic research leads to technology development. Tekes also consults Finnish companies on their immediate and long-term needs. The goal is to make sure Tekes’ limited resources are invested in technology that companies can absorb and that is relevant to the economy. Current focus areas include information and communication technology, renewable energy, new materials, and health and wellbeing.\n\nSeveral studies have found that Finland’s investments in R&D have had a significant impact. According to a 2006 study by the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (ETLA), public subsidies by Tekes have improved productivity in small and medium-sized companies and in “companies near the frontier in productivity.”433 A study by Finland’s National Audit Office found that Tekes funding allowed companies to implement R&D projects more quickly and broadly. It is also found that 57 percent of projects in the study would not have been undertaken without support from Tekes.434\n\nCanada\n\nAmong industrialized nations, Canada ranks very high in education and in living standards, boasting the second-highest per-capita income among G7 nations. Yet Canada is not among the leaders in most benchmarks of innovation, ranking 12th in the World Economic Forum’s latest Global Competitiveness Index.435 In part, this is due to low R&D spending by business, which has declined in inflation-adjusted terms since 2001.436 Canada’s BERD intensity is among the lowest of industrialized economies. [See ] Some analysts attribute this paradox to Canada’s abundant natural resources437 and close integration with the United States, which keep its industries at the technological forefront even though domestic companies spend relatively little on research and development. “In many, many sectors, there is one economy,” explained Peter J. Nicholson, president of the Council of Canadian Academies. “A great deal of technical sophistication in the Canadian economy is embodied in imported capital.”438\n\nFIGURE 5.14\n\nCanadian business R&D intensity is among the lowest of the industrialized countries.

NOTE: Data refer to 2009 or most recent year available.\n\nThe Canadian government has promoted domestic innovation much more actively in the past decade. One reason is that resolution of serious government fiscal problems in the mid-1990s freed up public resources. Another was realization that innovation would have to propel a greater share of future growth. “If we wanted to have something that was home-grown and that could give us a degree of independence, we had to build our innovation capacity from the ground up,” Dr. Nicholson explained.439 Another source of motivation was alarm over slowing productivity growth, which lagged that of the U.S. After Canadian productivity reached 91.4 percent of the U.S. level in 1984, it fell steadily. By 2006, Canadian productivity was at 73.7 percent of the U.S. level, the lowest level since the 1950s.440 The International Institute for Management Development ranks Canada 24 among 33 advanced economies in productivity growth.441 A report by the Council of Canadian Academies concluded that “Canada has a serious productivity growth problem.”442 As a result, “economists are increasingly focusing on a lack of innovation in Canada as a contributor to poor productivity performance,” reported the Science and Technology and Innovation Council in its report State of the Nation 2010.443\n\nThe nation’s education system gives Canada a strong base to build upon. Forty-six percent of Canadians aged 25 to 64 are post-secondary graduates, the highest rate among OECD nations.444 Canada spent 63 percent of GDP on higher education R&D as of 2007, by far the highest level among G7 nations.445 It also had the most citizens aged 25 to 64 with a tertiary education--49 percent.446 Canada has an extensive network of 24 national research institutes under the National Research Council, which employ 4,500 and hosts 1,200 guest researchers.\n\nThe government’s approach to science and technology shifted significantly in the 1990s. Public funding for basic research rose sharply. R&D spending by Canadian universities and research hospitals nearly tripled between 1998 and 2004, to around $2.3 billion.447 There also was a healthy increase in “intramural” funding. Direct subsidies for industry were curtailed, and a model of sharing risk between the public and private sectors was adopted. 448 The government also established a number of programs to build world-class research institutions, encourage companies to invest more in R&D, and disseminate technology more widely through the economy. Canadian policies were in part influenced by studies of the experiences of such nations as Sweden and the United Kingdom and by the innovation system of the European Union.449\n\nCanada introduced several institutions in the late 1990s to lead an innovation drive. The Canada Foundation for Innovation was established and given the mission of transforming research and technology development, fostering strategic research planning at universities, attracting and retaining world-class researchers, and promoting collaborative and cross-disciplinary research. The Department of Finance and the Department of Industry began to formulate an innovation framework for the country in 1998. The government also launched an initiative in the mid-1990s to establish a network of “centers of excellence” to create research partnerships in advanced technologies, engineering and manufacturing, life sciences, environmental technologies, and natural resources.\n\nThe national innovation strategy, presented in a 2001 report called Achieving Excellence, set ambitious benchmarks. The document called for Canada to rank among the world leaders in share of private-sector sales attributable to innovations, match the U.S. is per-capita venture-capital investment, improve recruitment of foreign talent, and increase graduate student admissions by 5 percent each year. To make the business environment more globally competitive, the strategy called for regulatory reform, lower taxes, and high-speed broadband that is widely accessible to Canadian communities. The document set a target of developing at least 10 internationally recognized technology clusters.450 Minister of Finance Paul Martin, who later became Prime Minister, announced a goal that Canada would move from No. 15 in the world in government R&D spending as a percentage of GDP to No. 5 by 2010. That would require research investment to triple.\n\nCanada has made especially strong progress in strengthening its infrastructure for basic research. Canada ranks No. 6 among OCED nations in scientific publications per capita and fifth in quality of publications.451 Much of the credit goes to measures launched in the mid-1990s. The Foundation for Innovation and the Canada Research Chairs program have had an especially broad impact. In 2007, the government unveiled a new science and technology strategy. It stated that Canada “must be connected to the global supply of ideas, talent, and technologies.” Among other things, the plan called for focusing on research relating to the environment, natural resources and energy, health, and information and communication technologies. It included an initiative called Knowledge Advantage to build on Canada’s research strengths to generate innovation and another called People Advantage aimed at developing and recruiting knowledge workers.452\n\nThe Foundation for Innovation, established in 1997, awards grants covering up to 40 percent of the cost of university R&D projects. The competitive application process led to a sharp improvement in the quality of research projects, according to Dr. Nicholson. The foundation also allocates funds to upgrade research facilities, spur international collaborations, and help first-time researchers. The foundation’s board includes some government appointees but operates independently.\n\nAs of September 2009, the foundation had committed nearly $5.2 billion to 6,300 projects at 130 research institutions across Canada. The program had attracted 8,050 new faculty members to Canadian universities, with nearly 3,200 from other nations. Forty-four percent of the 1,806 new researchers were recruited internationally, and nearly 80 percent of project leaders said the availability of foundation-funded infrastructure was important to their decision to join the institution. More than 21,000 post-doctoral fellows and graduate students used the infrastructure for their research, and the foundation had supported more than 1,600 collaborative research agreements. The foundation also was credited with creating nearly 4,700 jobs and at least 54 new companies. 453 A $61 million round of investments in 245 projects announced in January 2011 offers a flavor of the research that is supported. The projects include design of innovative molecules to treat breast cancer at the University of Guelph, a project to improve understanding of the brain and spinal cord at Dalhousie University in Halifax, and monitoring of ecosystems in the Canadian Arctic at the Université du Québec à Rimouski.454\n\nCanada Research Chairs complements the foundation by funding development of world-class research capacity at universities and a cadre of researchers. The program has a $300 million annual budget to recruit and retain top-flight academics. Since it began operation a decade ago, the program has established 2,000 chairs at degree-granting institutions. Thirty percent of the 1,845 chairs filled so far are occupied by academics recruited from outside Canada.455\n\nEach degree-granting school receives allocations of chairs based on research grants they win in national competitions, with special consideration for small institutions. Universities nominate academics whose work complements their strategic research plans. Academics recognized by their peers as “world leaders” in their fields are paid $200,000 annually for seven years with indefinite renewal. “Exceptional emerging scholars” receive $100,000 for five years with one renewal. Together, the foundation and chairs program have “powerfully boosted Canada’s research capacity at the front end,” Dr. Nicholson said.456\n\nTo spur innovation among small businesses, Canada operates the Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP). The program, managed by the National Research Council, has a $281 million budget and employs 240 industrial technology advisors in 147 sites across the country. These advisors work with nearly 8,000 companies, dividing their time between consulting small businesses and supporting projects such as feasibility studies, pre-competitive R&D, hiring, and international sourcing. Seventy-five percent of advisors have masters or Ph. D. degrees, 45 percent had run their own R&D facilities, and 35 percent have been entrepreneurs.\n\nIRAP advisors improve business proposals and help connect small and midsized enterprises to national and global innovation networks. Help from the agency often gives small companies credibility in the financial community, making it easier to raise capital.457 IRAP also provides financial support to help small and midsized Canadian enterprises develop technologies for competitive advantage. The program provides up to $1 million a year to some 1,400 firms, 80 percent of which have fewer than 50 employees, with the average receiving around $100,000. Companies receiving funds typically contribute half of a project’s cost. Small contributions can be approved in as little as two weeks.\n\nIn most cases, IRAP agrees to work with companies over time, rather than only provide one-time help for specific projects. IRAP charges companies for advisory services, but doesn’t break even. The help contributed to the Canadian economy, however, Dr. Nicholson explained. A 2007 evaluation of IRAP suggested that the approach of supporting development of firms is one reason behind its success. Sales of IRAP client firms averaged 28 percent growth in revenues and 30 percent growth in employment over the previous five years. For each 1 percent increase in IRAP contribution and advisory services, firms exhibited an 11 percent increase in sales, a 12 percent jump in productivity, a 13 percent rise in R&D spending, and a 14 percent increase in employment. The analysis found that the program contributed between $2.3 billion and $6.5 billion to the Canadian economy between 2002 and 2007, meaning that benefits equaled four to 12 times IRAP’s costs.458\n\nLow business investment in R&D has received growing emphasis in recent years. The 2007 federal science and technology plan included a program called Entrepreneurial Advantage to translate knowledge into practical applications. The plan called for improving investment incentives and allowances for capital costs, establishing centers of excellence in commercialization and research, and expanding support for small and midsize companies.459\n\nThe Networks of Centers of Excellence program, meanwhile, has been broadened. In 2007, the government committed $46 million to fund large collaborative networks that support private-sector innovation headed by business consortia. Seventeen new Centers of Excellence for Commercialization and Research have opened since 2008 to promote stronger partnerships between researchers and industry.460 They include the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics at the University of Waterloo, the Brain Research Centre at the University of British Columbia, and the National Optics Institute in Quebec City. To date, the Centers of Excellence program is credited with creating more than 100 spin-off companies and training 36,000 personnel. Each year, it generates more than 100 patents and leverages $71 million in added investment.461\n\nCanada also has made generous use of tax credits to entice corporations to build R&D centers and advanced manufacturing facilities in Canada. Under the Scientific Research and Experimental Development incentive scheme, companies can get 30 percent rebates from the government on their R&D spending. The credits are awarded regardless of a company’s size, industry sector, or technology area. Companies can deduct the full cost of R&D machinery and equipment. Large Canadian and foreign corporations can claim 20 percent credits that can be used to offset federal taxes due within the next 20 years. An estimated $3.5 billion in benefits were awarded in 2009.462\n\nDespite all of these programs, striking the right balance with public support of private companies has proved challenging in Canada. In 1996, a program called Technology Partnerships Canada, which had focused on the defense industry, began covering 25 to 30 percent of companies’ cost of industrial research, prototype development, and testing in other industries. Investments targeted “enabling” technologies such as biotech, materials, and information and communications technology. Companies were to repay the funds when they became profitable. As of 2006, only about 3 percent of funds invested by the Technology Partners had been repaid by companies. The program also was criticized for taking too long to approve projects.463 Technology Partnerships was discontinued in 2006 and absorbed into the Industrial Technologies Office, which no longer offers such subsidies.464\n\nChallenges faced by the Technology Partners program offered some lessons regarding public investments. One is that it is difficult to design repayment terms that properly reflect risk and reward of a specific research project, Dr. Nicholson acknowledged. Technology Partners was criticized for taking too long to approve projects. The program’s broad objectives also made it difficult for Technology Partners to maintain a consistent approach. “That tends to invite a lot of objections from people who were disappointed,” Dr. Nicholson said. “Someone can always find a precedent and say, ‘but you approved that one, so what’s wrong with me?’” It also was sometimes hard to demonstrate a direct impact to the Canadian economy from public investments: Recipients of Technology Partners funds included companies like IBM and Pratt & Whitney that operate in a world of global supply chains.465\n\nBusiness spending on R&D also continues to lag in Canada, falling in 2010 for the third year in a row, to $14.8 billion.466 Although business funding of university research has risen sharply since 2001,467 corporations still account for only about 50 percent of total R&D spending in Canada, one of the lowest among major economies. A 2009 survey of 6,233 Canadian enterprises in 67 industries found that only 18.8 percent said their strategic focus is to regularly introduce new or significantly improved goods and services.468 The Science, Technology, and Innovation Council said in a 2008 report that R&D spending by Canadian firms is “falling behind our major competitors and the gap is growing.”469 Business R&D spending equaled around 1 percent of GDP in 2009, compared to a 1.6 percent average for OECD nations.470 [See ] Milway, executive director of the Institute for Competitiveness and Prosperity, recently remarked that this performance “is another bit of evidence that our businesses are not competing on the basis of innovation, value-added and sophistication.”471 Total R&D intensity in Canada has thus been trending downward for the past decade, to 1.81 percent of GDP in 2010. [See ]\n\nFIGURE 5.15\n\nCanadian R&D intensity has been trending downward in the past decade. SOURCE: Statistics Canada, CANSIM, tables 358-0001 and 380-0017 and Catalogue nos. 88-001-XIE and 88F0006XIE. NOTE: Data for 2009 and 2010 are preliminary.\n\nThere also are concerns that Canada is falling short of its goal of building a sufficient base of knowledge workers. A report by the Canadian Council on Learning in August 2010 said Canada lags in early childhood education. While science, math, and reading test scores still are relatively high in secondary school, other nations are advancing faster. 472 Canada ranks 20th among OECD nations in terms of natural science and engineering degrees as share of total degrees and 17th in the number of people in science and technology occupations.\n\nSuch challenges have not slowed Canada’s commitment to investing in the science and technology foundations of an innovation-led economy. It is early to pass judgment on Canada’s efforts to stimulate private investment in R&D, since many of the new programs were implemented just prior to the 2008-2009 recession, which forced companies to cut back. To address challenges in R&D investment and with the skilled workforce, the Canadian government also remains committed to expanding research collaborations with foreign companies and universities, to improving incentives to attract direct foreign investment, and to recruiting top talent.\n\nJapan\n\nJapan has taken a number of actions since the mid-90s to improve its innovation system, many of them inspired by the United States.473 Japan has strengthened protection of intellectual property, overhauled science and technology policy institutions, enacted its own version of the Bayh-Dole Act to make it easier for universities and research laboratories to commercialize technology, and bolstered industry and academic science partnerships.474 Japan also undertook a number of initiatives to increase entrepreneurialism, including a small-business loan program similar to America’s Small Business Innovation Research program.\n\nTo spur corporate R&D spending, Japan grants generous tax credits. Largely as a result, Japanese spending on research and development surged from 2.77 percent of GDP in 1994 to 3.8 percent in 2008 before declining slightly to 3.62 percent in 2009.475 [See ] Japanese companies account for three-quarters of that spending, the highest ratio among OECD nations.476\n\nFIGURE 5.16\n\nJapanese R&D intensity peaked at 3.8 percent of GDP in FY2008 before declining slightly in FY2009. SOURCE: Japan Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications, Statistics Bureau, Accessed at <http://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/kagaku/index.htm> (more...)\n\nDriving this change was the realization that innovation would be central to restoring growth to the Japan’s stagnating economy in the wake of the financial crash of 1990. Even though Japanese R&D investment and output of patents remained quite strong on world standards throughout the 1990s, Japanese companies stumbled as they tried to make the transition from products derived from well-developed technologies to the creation of more fundamental breakthroughs.477 Japan’s competitiveness in industries such as semiconductors and consumer electronics waned with the rise of new rivals in South Korea and Taiwan. Japan had largely missed out on the U.S.-led booms in biotechnology and software.478 Japan’s commercial scene, dominated by large conglomerates, was not producing many dynamic start-ups. The rapid pace of change ushered in by the information technology revolution and globalization did not play to the strengths of Japan’s large industrial conglomerates.\n\nJapan’s policy shift began in earnest with passage of the Basic Law on Science and Technology in 1995.479 Under that plan, the government spent ¥17 trillion ($206 billion in current U.S. dollars) from 1996 through 2000 on science and technology programs. During the subsequent five-year basic plans, another ¥49 trillion were invested. These funding increases helped Japanese universities and national laboratories upgrade laboratories that had become outdated.480\n\nJapan also strengthened national coordination of its innovation strategy. The Council for Science and Technology Policy, established in 2001, became part of the Prime Minister’s Cabinet. The council drafts comprehensive science and technology policies to respond to national and social needs, advises on how to allocate resources, and evaluates major projects. Funding focused on life sciences, nanotechnologies and new materials, information and communication, and environmental technologies.481\n\nThe government did not, however, assume greater central control over research. To the contrary, in 2004 it gave national universities and research institutes more autonomy to allocate resources, collaborate with industry, and set their own research priorities by separating them from the civil-service system. These institutions were transformed into non-profit corporations. Because they account for the bulk of scientific and technological research, the independence given universities and national labs is expected to allow resources to be used more flexibly and efficiently. In another crucial institutional reform, government agencies have begun to allocate much greater shares of R&D funds on the basis of peer-reviewed competition.482\n\nThe greater focus on innovation has led to dramatic increases in scientific research in strategic areas.483 In 1992, the government set a goal of tripling investment in life sciences over the next decade. By 2001, the number of biotech companies had risen from a few dozen to 250; the goal was to have 1,000 biotech companies by 2010. In nanotech, Japan was spending almost as much on research as the United States--$940 million—as of 2004. Fuel cells, an important technology not only for portable electronic devices but also for future electrified vehicles, also received heavy emphasis.\n\nRobotics is another top Japanese research priority. The government is especially interested in developing technologies used in core components that can be applied across the industry, such as power sources, control systems, mechanics, software, and structures. Two of Japan’s biggest investments in science were the $1 billion Spring-8, one of the world’s largest synchrotron radiation facilities, and the Earth Simulator, a $450 million scientific computer billed as the world’s fastest when it opened in 2003.\n\nJapan also has resuscitated R&D consortia, a key element of industrial policy until the 1980s. The government cut funds for consortia in areas like semiconductors following trade friction with the U.S., but began to renew such programs after Sematech started to benefit U.S. producers and Japanese chipmakers’ fortunes declined.484\n\nStrengthening University-Industry Partnerships\n\nJapan has moved to strengthen universities’ collaboration with industry. In 1999, Japan enacted a law that gave universities and research institutes the ability to patent investments derived from publicly funded research, similar to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. Since then, these institutions have established technology-transfer organizations. The government also helped universities set up Collaborative Research Centers that compete for government grants for joint university-industry research, small-business incubators, and a network of 45 Venturing Business Laboratories, which help young researchers commercialize their work. In addition, the government relaxed rules that had barred university faculty from serving on the boards of private companies.\n\nThese efforts led to significant results. University-industry research collaborations surged from around 1,500 in 1995 to more than 6,000 in 2003. Companies spun out of universities increased to around 150 a year as of 2003, nearly half of them in life sciences and information and communication technologies.485\n\nWhile it is too early to assess the full impact of Japan’s reforms, there have been noticeable improvements. The World Economic Forum ranks Japan 9th overall in its most recent Global Competitiveness Index and 4th in innovation.486 Patent applications by universities and technology-licensing offices increased from 641 in 2001 to 8,527 in 2005, a comparable level to the United States. University-industry joint research projects jumped from less than 1,500 annually in 1995 to more than 10,000 in 2005. Spinoffs from Japanese universities also rose sharply.487 And overall, Japanese patent applications have been increasing in recent years. [See ]\n\nFIGURE 5.17\n\nJapanese patent applications have been increasing in recent years. SOURCE: WIPO, “International Patent Filings Recover in 2010,” February 2, 2011, PR/2011/678. NOTE: 2010 data are estimated.\n\nSuch data suggest that university-industry partnerships have become “important for science-based innovation in Japan,” said Masayuki Kondo of Japan’s National Institute of Science and Technology. “They narrow the gap between Japanese high science and technology potential and low industrial performance to help strengthen the innovation capability of Japanese industry.” However, Mr. Kondo said, Japanese universities bring in only a fraction of the licensing revenues of American universities. Only a handful of Japanese spinoffs so far have gone public.488\n\nStronger protection of intellectual property rights has improved Japan’s innovation system since the early 1990s. Initially, the Japanese government responded to pressure from the U.S. to strengthen enforcement of violations. The World Trade Organization’s Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement in 1995 also had a major impact. The government enacted a series of other reforms since then, including the Basic Law on Intellectual Property in 2003 and establishment of the Intellectual Property High Court in 2005, which is modeled after the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit. Criminal sanctions have been raised, and the scope of invention that is patentable has been greatly broadened.489\n\nIPR protection in Japan is now widely recognized to be very high. According to Business Software Alliance, Japan has the third-best record of enforcement following the U.S. and New Zealand. Patent-infringement claims have increased sharply. The overall impact on Japanese innovation is more difficult to assess because there are concerns that the IPR system’s complexity and overburdened judiciary may hinder the ability of companies to commercialize technologies efficiently and raise transaction costs.490\n\nRediscovering Small Companies\n\nSmall business played a big role during Japan’s post-war economic takeoff. But starting in the 1970s, new company formation began to fall to the point where entrepreneurship was perceived as stagnant, explained Takehiko Yasuda of Japan’s Research Institute of Economy, Trade, and Industry. One reason was that Japanese policy tended to protect small enterprises from large firms, rather than see them as sources of innovation and job creation.491 Policymakers also viewed large corporations as bigger contributors of wage and labor productivity. By the 1990s, however, the government recognized that startups were providing major stimulus to the economies of the U.S. and England.492\n\nThe government began introducing policies to encourage more startups in 1999. It enacted the Small and Medium Enterprise Basic Law to promote their growth. Two years later, the government launched the Start-up Doubling Plan, which set a goal of increasing the number of start-ups from 180,000 in 2001 to 360,000 in five years. Japan removed minimum capital requirements for new limited-liability companies, established the National Startup and Venture Forum to educate entrepreneurs, reformed the bankruptcy code, and launched a start-up loan program through the government-owned National Life Finance Corporation. The loans required no collateral, guarantors, or personal guarantees. In 2008, this unit was folded into the Japan Finance Corporation, whose small- and medium-sized business unit provided ¥20 trillion in support in 2009.493\n\nJapan also established its own Small Business Innovation Research program, modeled after the one run by the U.S. Department of Commerce. The program aims to enhance the ability of small and midsized enterprises to develop technology and innovative products. As with the U.S. SBIR program, Japanese agencies that make research grants set aside a certain portion of their funds for small and midsized enterprises.\n\nRemoving the minimum capital requirement of ¥10 million for joint-stock companies in 2004 had an immediate impact. Between Feb. 1, 2004, and Jan. 21, 2006, there were 24,639 confirmed applications with 20,211 notification completions. Based on the success of this policy, the Japanese government enacted the Corporate Law in 2005 to remove the minimum capital requirement for establishing firms in general, which is consistent with the U.S. joint-stock corporation policy.\n\nRemaining Challenges for Start-Ups\n\nOne of Japan’s most pressing challenges is to create new companies. A 1997 survey by Japan’s Ministry of Public Management, Home Affairs, Post and Telecommunications found that only one in 50 employed people aspired to become entrepreneurs, a very low level on world standards, and that only half of them were actually preparing to become self-employed.494 The environment has not improved dramatically since then. Of 59 nations studied by the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, Japan ranks second to the bottom, behind only Italy, in entrepreneurial activity.495\n\nA lack of capital is a major reason. A survey of start-ups found that 49 percent of Japanese entrepreneurs reported that “procuring funds for entry” is a major problem, well ahead of finding customers and hiring high-quality employees.496 To remedy this problem, the National Life Finance Corporation set up a new program to lend up to ¥10 million to start-ups without requiring collateral, guarantors, or personal guarantees. Between 2002 and 2006, the number of recipients rose from 2,975 to 7,942.497\n\nSome Early Progress\n\nJapan’s new innovation system has begun to change the dynamics of the national economy. Patenting and technology transfer from Japan’s top public research institutes have increased sharply. That system is still evolving, however, and inefficiencies remain. America’s National Institutes of Health, for example, coordinates all government-funded biomedical research. In Japan, similar activity is dispersed among many funding agencies that do not share information on researchers, according to a 2006 analysis by Yosuke Oka, Kenta Nakamura, and Akira Tohei.498 Nor are there guiding principles of peer review across agencies. “This could explain why a small number of star scientists receive a large share of research funds from multiple funding agencies,” the authors noted. Government research funding also tends to flow to a handful of top schools. The top 10 universities garner half of research grants in Japan.499\n\nEven though patent filings increased, technology transfer from Japanese research universities was not impressive when measured licensing revenue, according to Dr. Oka, Dr. Nakamura, and Dr. Tohei. Among other things, they attributed the poor performance to rudimentary technology-transfer contract practices and overly restrictive rules on using research funds. University researchers prefer “informal collaborations” to get around red tape. What’s more, despite relaxed rules allowing academics to work in the private sector, most university researchers remain at their jobs rather than circulate through industry. Sadao Nagaoka and Kenneth Flamm suggest that Japan still may lack the complementary institutions needed to make U.S.-style industry-university partnerships more effective, such as infrastructure for supporting high-tech startups, availability of risk capital, and professional services.500\n\nA number of reforms have been proposed in Japan to address many of these shortcomings. While it is too early to measure progress, the changes implemented over the past decade in Japan’s innovation ecosystem have provided a much stronger institutional framework for success in the 21st century global knowledge economy."
