The single exception is that of the Americanized actor, Sessue Hayakawa. Titles of Japanese films are given in English with the Japanese title and the production date at the head of the main entry. I have tried to render them faithfully. My translation does not always correspond to those given by other sources particularly in the case of films unreleased in English-speaking countries. Whenever films have one or more English release titles, these are given in a footnote to the main entry. Thus, a well-known film may often be found in the index under three or more titles. Unless otherwise indicated all translations from French are mine. This book could never have been written without the help of many friends in Japan and elsewhere. First of all, I must thank Shibata Hayao, Kawakita Kasuko and the entire staff of the Shibata Organization for having made possible my first trip to Japan and for having done so much to facilitate what is inevitably a difficult acclimatization. On my second trip, it was my dear friends Kuraoka Akiko and Philippe Ferrand who helped to make bearable the gruelling rhythm of Tokyo life. Special thanks are due to Ohba Masatoshi of the Tokyo Museum of Modern Art Film Centre whose devoted assistance made it possible for me to make shot-by-shot transcriptions of dozens of films and to examine scores of others. I am also greatly indebted to Kawakita Kashiko and Shimizu Akira of the Japan Film Library Council, who arranged for me to study many films from their collection and who helped me in so many other ways. Credit in particular is due to the Council for all the separate film stills illustrating this volume, as well as the sequence from A Tale of Late Chrysanthemums. And I especially wish to thank Ema Michio of the Kyoto Film Library for entrusting me with\n\nPage [unnumbered] FOREWORD AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS some twenty 16mm prints and a projector. I was thus able to screen those rare films in my hotel room when I unwittingly arrived in Kyoto on the eve of a holiday. Matsuda Shunji graciously made available to me even rarer films from his collection, while Hiroko Govaers gave me invaluable practical and linguistic help in both Tokyo and Paris. My talks with Donald Richie and Yoshida Tieo were extremely helpful in clearing up certain points of filmhistory. The critics Kawarabata Nei and especially Sato Tadao gave me much valuable guidance. I also wish to thank Iwamoto Kenji for his stimulating theoretical insights and James Leahy, Dr Barry Salt, Jorge Dana and P. Adams Sitney for their suggestions and criticisms. However, my greatest debt is to Annette Michelson. As the title page suggests, without her severe editing and criticism, as well as her helpful suggestions, this book, my first in my native language, could never have been made readable or, indeed, comprehensible. N.B.\n\nPage [unnumbered] FOR MARTINE The point is not to seek truth or salvation in the pre-scientific or the philosophically pre-conscious, nor to transfer whole segments of mythology into our philosophy; in dealing with these variants of mankind who are so different from us, our aim should be to gain further insight into the theoretical and practical problems which confront our own institutions, to gain new awareness of the plane of existence in which they originated and which the long record of their achievements has made us forget. The 'puerility' of the East has something to teach us, if only the narrowness of our adult ideas. Maurice Merleau-Ponty: Signes, p. 175\n\nPage [unnumbered]\n\nPage 11 Preface Let it be clear from the outset that this book lays no claim to being yet another 'history of the Japanese cinema'. In the native language there already exists Tanaka Junichiro's four-volume factual compendium;' in English, it is hoped that the reader will be familiar with the several writings of Donald Richie and in particular The Japanese Film, written in collaboration with Joseph Anderson and drawing much data from Tanaka; in French, a forthcoming volume by Max Tessier will display, I understand, similarly comprehensive ambitions. Mine are at once more modest and, considering the limited tools at my command and the material at my disposal, considerably more ambitious, not to say presumptuous. My approach is, of course, historical in every sense. In fact Japanese cinema from the period 1917-45, to which the bulk of this essay is devoted, is likely to seem quite remote to both Western and Japanese readers. My reading of the films is conducted, moreover, with constant reference to the history of 'Japanese culture' as a whole. For it is beyond doubt that Japan's singular history, informed by a unique combination of forces and circumstances, has produced a cinema which is in essence unlike that of any other nation. This essential difference between the dominant modes of Western and Japanese cinema is the main concern of this study. It is intended, furthermore, as a step in the direction of a critical analysis of the ideologically and culturally determined system of representation from which the film industries of Hollywood and elsewhere derive their power and profit. It consequently may be understood as part of a much broader movement, that of the modern search for a Marxist approach to art, initiated by Brecht and Eisenstein, and which involves a detour through the East. Paradoxically, it is in France that the scrutiny of le texte de l'Orient has been most productive. Paradoxically, because oriental scholarship per se in post-war France I. Nihon eiga hotatsu, Chuo Koran-sha, Tokyo, I957.\n\nPage 12 PREFACE has been scant and on the whole mediocre. The writers associated with the review Tel Quel,2 who have been at the centre of this new concern with the East, have had to rely almost exclusively on the pioneer work of Marcel Granet, La Pensee chinoise (1934), or on more recent writings in English (in particular those of Joseph Needham and his team). Understandably, the writings of Philippe Sollers, Julia Kristeva and their colleagues have tended, in so far as they have touched on the Orient, to stress the implications for contemporary developments in the theory of dialectical materialism of the thoughtsystems of ancient China. They have emphasized, in particular, the importance of non-phonetic writing in the development of modes of thought and social practice antithetical to those characteristic of the West within the structure of capitalism and its Aristotelian and Christian heritage. Comparatively little attention has been paid to Japan by these authors, partly no doubt because modern Japanese history would seem to indicate, on the contrary, remarkable compatibility between 'Japanese thought patterns' and the ideological superstructures of capitalism. Japanese artistic and social practice have, moreover, produced almost no theoretical practice comparable to the logic and linguistics of ancient India or the cosmology and science of China. The fate of Buddhist logic, subsequent to its importation into Japan as part of the body of Buddhist teachings, typifies the Japanese disdain of theoretical practice. This highly refined discipline of Indian origin rapidly became a form of ritualized debate which continues to be held at Mt Koya, even to this day. In this ritual, the answerers (rissha), the questioners (monja), the judge (tandai), the stenographer (chuki), and the manager (gyoji) sit in pious attitude around the statue of the Buddha according to fixed rule. Buddhist hymns are sung and sutras are read. Thus, in Japan, logical debate was reduced to a mere Buddhist meeting, a decorum of the most pious form. Further, the form of the ritual was extended without change to the poetic debate or utaawase.3 The specific traits of Japanese 'theory' must be sought, not in any body of theoretical writings, ancient or modern, of Japanese origin, but in the practice of her arts and letters. It is significant in this respect that the only rudimentary attempts at aesthetic theory, indeed theory of any sort, are to be found in the incidental writings of such figures as Tsurayaki, the Heian poet and anthologist, Zeami, actor/ author and codifier of the no play, Chikamatsu, the eighteenth-century dramatist, etc.4 The larger theoretical implications of Japanese practices are to be derived 2.

One of the principal assumptions of this study is that the critical framework developed in France over the past decade (partly through an investigation of Eastern thought) provides elements towards an understanding of the far-reaching theoretical implications of le texte japonais. For, just as it is possible to read a written text as complex system, both self-contained and historically determined, so too with a culture - and Japanese culture perhaps more relevantly than any other. I like to think that it was this clarifying vocation of French thinking in general which a Japanese scholar, Toki Zemmaro, had in view when he remarked to the French Japanologist Ren6 Sieffert that 'French was the only language precise enough to render with precision the full imprecision of the no play'.5 Of course, this 'imprecision' of the language and 'thoughtpatterns' of Japan is another cliche, belaboured by Western-centred scholars but also by many Japanese, impressed by the marvellous compatibility which they observe between the highly 'rational' linguistic and theoretical practices of the West and the technological tasks involved in the construction of a 'modern' (i.e. industrial) society. This cliche is one of many to be disposed of in this study. Still, this statement does point to the possibility of an immensely productive relationship which could and should be developed between contemporary European theory and Japanese practice. And Marxism has always regarded such mutually informative relationships between theory and practice as essential to its growth. One French author loosely associated with the Tel Quel group, Roland Barthes, has in fact turned his attention to Japan, and the essay which he produced following a brief stay in that country, though a minor, circumstantial piece in the context of his writings as a whole, is nonetheless a pioneer text.6 It is the first attempt by any Western writer to read the Japanese 'text' in the light of contemporary semiotics, a reading informed by a rejection of ethnocentrism - and indeed of all the 'centrisms' which have anchored ideology in the West since the industrial revolution and the rise of capitalism. I shall have occasion to refer again to this essay, which has stimulated my own thought and research. The following, concluding passage of Barthes' book, which contains the key to its title, points to the common ground of our concerns: Empire of Signs? Indeed, if we imply that the signs are empty and the ritual is a godless one. Just look at the study of signs PREFACE 4. See Ueda Makoto, Literary and Art Theories in Japan. 5.

I3\n\nPage 14 PREFACE (Mallarm6's dwelling place), in other words, out there, any view, be it urban, domestic or rural. And so that we may see how it is put together, let it be illustrated by the Shikidai corridor: papered with openings, framed by empty space and framing nothing, decorated, it is true, but in such a way that the figuration (flowers, trees, birds, animals) is swept away, sublimated, shifted far from the forefront of vision... in this corridor, as in the ideal Japanese house, devoid or nearly so, of furniture, there is no place which in any way designates property; no seat, no bed, no table provides a point from which the body may constitute itself as subject (or master) of a space. The very concept of centre is rejected (a burning frustration for Western Man, everywhere provided with his arm-chair and his bed, the owner of a domestic position). Non-centred, this space is also reversible: you can turn the Shikidai corridor upside down and nothing will happen other than an inconsequential inversion of high and low, right and left. Content has been irrevocably dismissed: whether we pass through, or sit on the floor (or ceiling, if you turn the picture around) there is nothing to grasp.7 All of the themes suggested in this dense text have their place in my examination of Japanese film-making: the essentially 'irreligious' character of the Japanese, their rejection of anthropocentrism and of all the 'centrisms' that derive from it in the West (the role which, in this respect, their architecture has played in their films is absolutely crucial, as Barthes indirectly suggests) and, of course, the all-important 'irrevocable dismissal of content', i.e. of the form-content hierarchies which are ours. I have called my undertaking presumptuous, and some explanations are in order. I do not read Japanese, and my knowledge of the spoken language is elementary to say the least. I was forced to rely upon interpreters in viewing the vast majority of the films referred to here. I was, however, able to study most of them at my leisure on an editing table. As the reader will quickly perceive, my main concern is with the modes of representation common to, and distinctive of, most Japanese films within given periods, and with the highly refined styles generated by these modes in the work of a handful of auteurs (a concept here applicable only with major reservations, as we shall see). The language handicap is therefore not as serious as it might have been to my 'content-oriented' predecessors in this field. More constricting certainly are the objective conditions under which the corpus of Japanese cinema is accessible to the scholar today, and particularly, of course, to the visiting scholar. I have spent altogether five months in Japan. I have had free access to the four main collections of Japanese films: the National Film Centre of the Tokyo Museum of Modern 7. Barthes, op. cit., pp. I48-50. I4\n\nPage 15 Art, the Japan Film Council Library, the Kyoto Film Lib- PREFACE rary and the private library of Matsuda Shunji. However, it must be understood that less than three hundred complete films made between I897 and I945 are preserved and readily accessible in one of the above-mentioned archives. Several hundred fragments collected by Matsuda Shunji are also available for study; but that is all. This does not mean, I hasten to add, that all of the remaining tens of thousands of films produced by the Japanese industry (from the outset, one of the world's most prolific) are irremediably 'lost', despite the fact that there was certainly a greater readiness in Japan to destroy commercially obsolete films than in the West.8 Since 1970, for example, several early Ozu films, including the remarkable Inn in Tokyo, all of which had been considered 'lost', were unearthed in the warehouses of one of the major production companies. To date, only about half of the forty-one or forty-two films (see Appendix 2) directed by Ozu between I927 and 1945 are known to be preserved. I am confident, however, that more will be found as the number of Japanese scholars and professional or amateur collectors gradually increases.9 At present, their number is pitifully small, considering the immensity of the task. It is, moreover, no accident that the films brought to light in recent years have been the work of acknowledged masters (such as Ozu and Mizoguchi); in Japan as elsewhere, the rule of film conservation dictates that discovery is determined by demand. Ishida Tamizo, whose film Fallen Blossoms is analysed here in some detail, is known to have directed scores of films; at the time of my last visit to Japan, only two were known to be preserved. The unanimous opinion of the small community of Japanese film scholars at that time was that, apart from those two films, Ishida produced only 'pot-boilers'. This had clearly deterred attempts to ferret out any other films of his that might have survived and continued to confirm, as well, his reputation as the maker of a single 'good' film. Or rather more accurately gave him no reputation at all, since even Fallen Blossoms, in my view one of the masterpieces of Japanese cinema, is known only to a few specialists - precisely because Ishida's name is not attached to a body of work. These cases are not exceptional; every pre-war director constitutes a 'case', the most tragic being that of Mizoguchi, whose mature work (1934-47) survives in only about half of 8.

I5\n\nPage 16 PREFACE as many directors as possible from that golden age of the Japanese cinema, the 1930S, I have had to follow, in large part, a hit-or-miss approach. It is true that my more or less random soundings did tend to confirm the existence of a number of permanent traits which define a specifically 'Japanese approach', recognizable at every level of cultural ambition. They also reinforced my view that Japan has had only a few authentic 'masters'. Their work stands out in a decisive way from the bulk of the national production, either through the 'de-construction' of the Western codes which, at certain periods in history, have tended to gain prevalence there, or else through a supreme refinement and systematization of those traits which are most specifically Japanese.\"' Of course, the random approach is always in danger of neglecting a master or two; I might conceivably have overlooked Ishida or, had I seen the wrong film first, Shimizu Hiroshi. This arbitrariness should be underscored here, if only because previous authors, whose work was similarly conditioned, have failed to do so. It is not, however, incompatible with the purpose of a study which is, as I have suggested, not a history of the Japanese cinema, but rather a reading of a body of Japanese film in the light of Japanese history. If I wish to imagine a fictional people, I can make up a name for them, treat them declaratively like an entity in a novel, found a second Garabagne\" to avoid compromising any real country in my fantasy (but then it is the fantasy that will be compromised by the signs of literature). I can also, without claiming to represent or analyse any reality whatsoever (such being the major endeavours of Western discourse) gather, somewhere in the world (out there), a number of features (in both the pictorial and linguistic sense) and with these features deliberately form a system. It is this system which I shall call Japan.'2 Although the specialized nature of my present project precludes this radically theoretical stance, I do share the basic premises of this opening statement of L'Empire des signes. The reader may be struck by my reference to the 1930s and early 1940s as the 'golden age' of Japanese cinema, whereas most Japanese and Western specialists (the former explicitly, the latter implicitly) situate it in the immediately post-war period, the period of 'democratization'. The reasons for this reversal will be analysed in their proper place. This period of Japanese cinema is terra incognita, not only to virtually all Western film-students but to most Japanese under fifty. It is my contention that the emphasis placed, in Europe, in America and, to a large extent, in Japan, on, for example, the later films of Ozu and Mizoguchi, is due to the relative compatibility of those films with Io. Kinugasa in the I920s, Kurosawa in the I950S are outstanding examples of the first approach, while Ozu and Mizoguchi in the 193os and early I940s perfectly embody the second. I.

The physical inaccessibility of earlier but mature work by these directors can be seen, at least in part, as a correlative of a fundamental incompatibility. For if the films of that earlier period are unknown in the West - Mizoguchi's Tale of Late Chrysanthemums and Tale of Loyal Retainers in the Genroku Era are significant examples - it is largely because Western distribution, criticism and cultural policy, as well as Japan's own scruples over cultural commerce with the West, express the intuition that such films are profoundly antithetical to canons of Western cinema. Needless to say, it is my hope, offered without undue optimism, that the present study will stimulate interest in the authentic golden age of Japanese cinema so that hitherto unavailable films by masters, whether unknown, like Ishida and Shimizu, or, like Ozu and Mizoguchi, celebrated within the Western cultural establishment as assimilable to its own self-perpetuating values, can be seen at last by viewers who no longer accept those values. As Bertolt Brecht trenchantly put it: 'The only people who can profitably study a piece of technique like Chinese acting's A [lienation]-effect are those who need such a technique for quite definite social purposes.'3 The people who most need to study this cinema in its most 'radically Japanese' form are those committed to constructing a thorough-going critique of the dominant modes of Western cinema. This critique, inscribed within seventy-five years of film practice in Japan, remains unread. It is this reading which I hope to initiate here. PREFACE I3. Willett, John (trans.), Brecht on Theatre, p. 93. 17\n\nPage 18 SomeTerminological Indications The spatio-temporal audio-visual continuum which we call a motion picture (or a video presentation or a slide-show...) may be regarded as a flux/field of signs. In the view of Ferdinand Saussure - which has served to constitute a semiology of the dominant cinema (that body of films subordinated essentially to the interests of the dominant class and hence informed at every level by its ideology) - the sign has two aspects, signifier and signified (Saussure compared them with the two sides of a sheet of paper, indissociable yet in binomial opposition). The signifier is the sign in its materiality: it may be a pictorial element or set of elements, or writing per se, a sound or set of sounds, or speechper se. While this enumeration covers the substance of expression peculiar to the 'audio-visual media', it by no means accounts for all such substances. Setting aside the codes of taste, touch and smell, rudimentary in our cultures, we may say that all substances of expression are ultimately visual or auditory, they may be transposed to film in either pictorial or auditory representation (i.e. codes of clothing) or in terms of 'form' - the codes of social distance translated into shot sizes. This possibility of transposition provides one foundation for the 'illusion of reality'. The signified is the concept (and only the concept) which, denotatively or connotatively, is... signified. The signified is not the referent. Even a word as 'abstract' as philosophy, while it may signify a concept answerable to some such definition as 'search for the underlying causes and principles of reality',1 also refers to an aspect of human history, to an actual body of texts and practices. A referent is 'that which refers a linguistic sign to extra-linguistic reality as it has been articulated by a human group... We speak of a referential function when the message is centred on the context.'2 It is this concept of referential function which points to a provisionally useful, though incomplete definition of the diegesis, helpful above all because it designates it as one dimension of film among others, not as its very substance. The diegesis may be said to be the imagi I. Webster's Third New International Dictionary. 2. Dictionnaire de Linguistique Larousse, pp. 414-15.\n\nPage 19 nary referent or sum of referents. The density of the diegesis, its presence, its powers of absorption, depend upon the status of the referential function. Most simply, the diegesis is for instance the 'world of Balzac' which his readers 'enter', those imagined drawing-rooms and cobbled streets, those imagined people, their 'characters', their souls. (It should be clear that diegesis and narrative are in no sense equivalent, since there is much more to diegesis than narrative; the process of narration, which is part of the narrative, is extra-diegetic.) In the cinema, of course, the sign/referent relationship is clearly very different from what it is in a written text, since we are dealing with an audio-visual facsimile of the referent. Hence,.in film, the referential function is always more heavily emphasized than in literature. The diegesis must not, however, be treated as a fixed, simple object. It must be studied under two complementary and dynamic aspects. For the constitution of the diegesis is a process, and a more proper term would indeed be diegetic process. It combines a mental process (the development of the spectator's 'absorption'), and a process of 'writing': the implementation on the screen of the 'codes' which catalyse that absorption. Both processes are, to varying degrees, implicated moreover in an ideological process. The resultant is a diegetic effect, whereby spectators experience the diegetic world as environment. Closely related and indeed constituent effects have been designated in theatre as identification (Brecht) and in painting as illusionism. However, it is also essential to consider the place of the audio-visual diegesis in the historical process. The stages of formation and the on-going elaboration of the basic mode of representation in the cinema of the West point to an all but universal tendency within the dominant cinema (as well as theatre and literature) to maximize and generalize the diegetic effect. And this tendency, in turn, must be understood as entering into a dialectical relationship with cultural and ideological conditioning. This maximization of the diegetic effect implies the effacing of the sign and of the process of signification as consciously perceived, and is only incidentally related to ideological categories such as 'realism' or 'naturalism'. The diegetic effect is truly as 'strong', as unadulterated in Hellzapoppin, The Five Thousand Fingers of Doctor T or late Fellini as it is in Ladri di Biciclette. Conversely, it is still intermittently operative for many spectators of Michael Snow's Wavelength or Jean-Luc Godard's Deux ou trois choses que je sais d'elle. Here, it is true, the status of the diegesis changes, qualitatively and quantitatively, from one moment to the next. These films designate the diegetic SOME TERMINOLOGICAL INDICATIONS I9\n\nPage 20 SOME TERMINOLOGICAL INDICATIONS 3. ibid, p. 92. 4. When these 'diegetic' codes depend solely upon visual representation of socially pre-existent systems, they are called iconographic codes. effect as such, making it difficult or impossible for the reader-spectator to enter 'permanently' into the imaginary space-time constituted through the diegetic process. Films of this sort function as critical texts. As indicated in Chapter 5 the development of the 'language' of the dominant cinema was principally determined by the need to improve the effectiveness of diegetic production, to intensify the presence of characters and 'their' world. The so-called Griffith codes of editing, and concomitantly of framing, constitute one of the three main supports of that production. To it were added the norms of 'three-dimensional' lighting/composition, developed chiefly during the 1920s, and, of course, lip-synch sound. To what extent are we justified in calling these basic systems, which obviously correspond to such different orders of semiosis, codes? A code may be defined as 'a system of signals - or signs or symbols, which by pre-established convention, is intended to represent or to transmit information between the origin or transmitter of the signals and the destination or receiver.'3 The notion of pre-established convention has been so generally extended by the science of semiotics to cultural and ideological determinations of an 'unconscious' nature (e.g. the codes of clothing) that it is reasonable to postulate the existence of codes of expectation with regard to the established procedures of editing, for example. True, the information transmitted by the dominant 'codes' of editing is elementary and most often negative (e.g. 'no time has elapsed between this shot and the last'). It is also true, however, that their structural functioning is in accordance with the considerably more complex codes of, say, any given genre, which will combine certain specialized and sophisticated codifications of the 'ground-rules' (for example, shot-size codes) with signifying patterns of a 'purely diegetic' character (dialogue, set design, etc.).4 The 'editing codes' are in fact part of the foundation supporting the more complex codes of the dominant system. When this is understood, the semantically elementary principles of dominant editing (together with the norms of frame-composition and lighting, and the technology of synch-sound) are seen to constitute a mode of representation which is primary with respect to the codes of genre, among others. Western film has known, prior to around I912, a period dominated by a different mode of representation, the 'primitive mode', which has had a significant counterpart in Japan ever since the introduction of the Western invention. This claim, essential to our investigation, will be substantiated by comparative analysis. The concept of matching is crucial to the dominant system of editing/camera placement. Practice has come to 20\n\nPage 21 define the match as any element which guarantees, from one shot to the next, the illusion of diegetic, spatiotemporal continuity - an 'illusion' distinct from the diegetic effect per se, though constitutive of it. Thus, the fact that a character is holding the same high-ball glass filled with what appears to be the same amount of liquor from one shot to the next constitutes a correct match. If, on the contrary, the character appears, in the second shot, to have lost the glass with an abruptness defying verisimilitude or to be nursing noticeably more or less whisky than before, without having drunk or been served - or been hidden from view long enough for one or the other to have occurred - we are dealing with a mismatch, a bad or incorrect match. More fundamental, however, is the set of orientation match-cuts whose development between 900o and 1930 may be said to provide the framework of the history of the dominant cinema during the silent and early sound eras. This development appears, in part at least, to have been the material consequence of the growing awareness among film-makers that perceptual left-right screen-orientation had to be given priority over actual orientations to profilmic space, the space of the 'studio'. Two characters looking at each other in pro-filmic space may or may not appear to the average Western spectator to be looking at each other in two shots appearing successively on the screen, accordingly as the respective placings of the camera did or did not comply with certain conditions. As was generally agreed, although only after some twenty years of filmhistory, what matters is that the eyelines, the orientation of gaze with respect to lens/screen-centre, must appear to 'meet', to cross in an imaginary space formed by the placing side by side (and not 'face to face') of the two successive shots. Similarly, a character walking in a straight line along a road through pro-filmic space who exits screen-left in one shot and re-enters screen-left in the following shot (because he has, for example, been filmed from the opposite side of the road) may well appear, in contradiction with all other data supplied, to have abruptly retraced his steps. This anomaly is termed an incorrect (screen-) direction match. Similarly, reversals of the respective positions of people or objects on the screen can, under certain conditions, be equally disruptive of diegetic verisimilitude. As evidenced in the example of the apparent reversal of walking, the I80o match (not to be confused with the reverse-field) often brings about reversals of all three types, which are in fact merely different manifestations of the self-same phenomenon. The eyeline match and to some extent the direction match ensure temporal continuity and spatial communica SOME TERMINOLOGICAL INDICATIONS 21\n\nPage 22 SOME TERMINOLOGICAL INDICATIONS 5. The procedure is sometimes called 'shot-counter-shot' in excessive fidelity to the very common French term champ-contre-champ. However, the word 'reverse' does figure in a number of related expressions employed among British and American professionals. 6. The cutaway may also operate on the contiguous mode, which may in fact be shown to have derived historically from that of alterity. 7. See my Theory of Film Practice, ch. i. 8. The term concertina seems no longer in current usage in the British film industry where it originated. However, I find it the most satisfactory equivalent for the common French term raccord dans l'axe provided by actual practice in English. tion between shots designated as contiguous in diegetic space. The most common device used to establish and to exploit an impression of contiguity/continuity is a series of eyeline exchanges which I have chosen to call reverse-field set-up or succession of reverse-angle shots.5 A reverse-field series may occasionally involve 180~ reversals; usually, however, these will produce 'bad' matches. A contiguity cut is one which implies spatial contiguity and temporal continuity. The reverse field is only one, albeit the most important form of the contiguity cut.6 In terms of spatial (as opposed to temporal) relationship, there are two other basic modes of shot-change: the direct cut or direct match, in which two successive shots contain common visual elements, present two successive aspects of a single fragment of diegetic space; and the alterity cut, a shot-change which involves neither spatial nor temporal continuity at all in the ordinary sense, but may present a considerable range of temporal or other semantic variations on the alterity mode. Historically, it was the first type of shot-change, the purely disjunctive equivalent of the curtain between scenes on the theatrical stage, which derived spatio-temporal signification only from the appropriate indications in the text of the play (or the programme). The alterity cut was also the first shot-change to be clearly and massively encoded: as ellipsis ('time has elapsed between the end of the last shot and the beginning of this one'), and as (unsituated) cutaway ('this shot is taking place \"elsewhere\" with respect to the previous one').7 The dialectical development of these two functions produced the simultaneous mode of cross-cutting ('the separate actions shown in these alternating shots are taking place at the same time'). The era-to-era cross-cutting at the end of Intolerance, the rhetorical associations of Strike, October, The Man with a Movie Camera, etc. are advanced developments of the alterity cut. They create far more complex problems of definition, which the classical distinction between parallel montage and alternate montage is quite inadequate to resolve. The earliest form of direct cut (c. 1905) was the concertina, i.e. a 'cut-in' or 'cut-back' to or from a given subject which remains the centre of each successive shot composition.8 This was to be one of the chief centering strategies of the cinema after Griffith. The 9go match and, ultimately, the I8o0 reversal were introduced gradually over the next decade and a half, and the development of the contiguity match and reverse field, initiated somewhat later, took a comparable period of time (I910-25). Matching on movement developed somewhat more slowly (1905-25), in reaction to the disconcerting discovery that the direct cut was 22\n\nPage 23 not necessarily the least disruptive of the three modes once SOME TERMINOLOGICAL the other two had been properly mastered. The direct cut INDICATIONS proved in fact to be more of a 'jolt' than the other forms unless the kinetic effect of the cut were absorbed by a shot-to-shot chain of perceptually continuous diegetic movement. Finally, though I refer often to these 'rules' and practices, and to the principles that subtend them, as 'editing codes', they are of course, strictly speaking, the codes of decoupage (i.e. of the editing/camera set-up relationship). The success of orientational matching is ultimately contingent upon the 'correct' placing of the camera, while the very possibility of matching on movement depends upon the placing of camera and actor(s). 23\n\nPage 24 Prt Grounds, PremIse\n\nPage 25 1. A System of Contradictions A great deal has been written about 'Japanese culture' since the opening of the country to foreign exchange, much of it uninformed nonsense from the pens of well-meaning globe-trotters, sensitive indeed to the otherness of the East but able to comprehend it only as the last refuge of 'universal human values' - those of middle-class idealism. One feels, therefore, reluctant to enter into general discussion of Japanese modes of representation, of Japanese aesthetics, of the 'Japanese mind', reluctant to add, perhaps, to that century-old slag-heap. It is nevertheless impossible to deal with Japanese film, indeed with any aspect of Japanese society, without constant reference to almost every one of its other aspects. That this should be especially true of Japanese society is an assertion which in itself requires some historical substantiation. The pertinent traits of Japanese aesthetics were defined almost entirely between the ninth and twelfth centuries, known as the Heian period. It was, however, under the rule of the Tokugawa Shdguns (i633-i867), the first of whom, ]eyasu, is celebrated as the consolidator of national unity and the initiator of three hundred years of peace, that Japan became the most integrated large-scale society in the world, East or West. Although the Shogunate thought to preserve its power by maintaining carefully drawn class distinctions, and although the end of the Tokugawa period was a time of social ferment, the long isolation of the country created a uniformity of habits, beliefs, and tastes among all classes. The farmer, the townsman, and the samurai moved in different hierarchical spheres but they shared a mundane world in which their differences were not of kind but of degree. The diet of all, except in times of famine, was essentially the same, consisting principally of rice with a few vegetables and a little fish, prepared according to a very few standard recipes.... The house of a townsman was more elegant than that of the peasant, but the architectural arrangement, the household articles, the system of heating, the furniture - all had the same basic 25\n\nPage 26 GROUNDS, PREMISES I. Earle, The Kabuki Theatre, pp. 67-8. 2. The inverted commas here call attention to a dubious but for the moment unavoidable reference to the occidental concept of the unique, irreplaceable work, a concept irrelevant in the traditional Japanese context. form, size, shape and function. The wealthy townsman could warm his hands in winter over a charcoal brazier made of bronze while the peasant had to be content with one of clay and with somewhat less charcoal... Wealth could provide greater abundance of food and better quality materials; it could purchase nothing essentially different in form or function. The code of morality and social behavior, based largely upon the Japanese interpretations of the commentaries of Chu Hsi on the works of the Chinese sages, at last permeated into all social groups, so that finally the Edo fireman shared an ethical climate not immediately distinguishable from that of the samurai. Similarly, tastes in art were built up out of commonly shared artistic experiences.... Identical tastes in music and in the graphic arts were so widespread that, until modern times, the body of artistic canon did not differ significantly according to social stratification. A maid serving tea moved in a style similar to that used at court ceremonies; shop clerks were taught to sit, move, and stand in patterns used in the No and were intensively drilled to speak in a manner closely resembling that of the Kabuki actor.' Even the Japan of the r970s, after a hundred years of capitalism and a thirty-year inoculation of American individualist ideology, still bears the unmistakable stamp of three centuries of standardization (e.g. the ken or module upon which tatami matting, and all other household furnishings, as well as all traditional dwellings, are patterned). And in the first forty years of this century, the period during which Japan's principal modes of filmic representation developed, the above description of Tokugawa society was still remarkably relevant. Small wonder, then, that so many of the specific traits of Japanese society are explicable and comprehensible, not as 'borrowings' from the older arts but rather as specific manifestations of that vast circulation of modules - of 'empty' signs, as Barthes might say - which is the very substance of Japanese society. Before attempting to define some of the principles governing this circulation, it may be useful to respond to one question which arises at the inception of any historicallyoriented investigation of Japanese cinema: how is it that while several of the non-Western nations - China, of course, but even more prolifically, Egypt and India - have long produced motion pictures, only Japan has developed modes of filmic representation that are wholly and specifically her own, only Japan has produced a body of 'masterpieces'.2 Indeed, an observation made by Jay Leyda about the transition from silence to sound, in his very informative history of the Chinese cinema, seems to characterize the entire history of cinema as it unfolded, not only in China 26\n\nPage 27 but in India and Egypt as well: 'The limitations of the American sound film were taken over wholesale by Chinese producers when they finally achieved sound productions of their own, and it cannot be said that Chinese films have yet escaped from their entangling admiration of the efficient American film.'3 Leyda shows how the entire Chinese industry depended throughout its formative years (basically, up to I930) on American and English capital and, most important, perhaps, on American and English cameramen. Yet China was not even a 'full-fledged' colony (though much actual production does seem to have been concentrated in Shanghai and Hong Kong, both dominated by European interests). To what lengths, one wonders, was the reliance on 'Western know-how' carried in 'protectorates' or colonies of such long-standing as Egypt and India during the formative period? In the absence of any comparably authoritative histories of the Egyptian or Indian cinemas in French or English, I am reduced to conjecture. Both nations remained under British rule until after the Second World War. Since the British cinema has from its very inception been totally enthralled by what were to become the 'Hollywood modes and codes', it is not difficult to understand why the modes of spatio-temporal representation found in the films of those countries appear to be so utterly divorced from the representational systems at work in their traditional arts. Even a cursory examination of Asian history immediately provides the answer we are looking for: in two thousand years of recorded history, no part of Japanese territory had ever been occupied until the 1945 defeat. Japan was never subjected to the semi-colonial status which was China's for over a century, or to complete enslavement as were Egypt or India. She is the only major non-Western country to have escaped the colonial yoke. Her cinema, of course, is but a minor consequence of this crucial fact, which in turn is one of a series of historical features by which Japan may be identified as belonging simultaneously to several apparently incompatible types and stages of historical development. The definition of these primary traits, essential for the understanding of the secondary traits as evinced by Japanese films, is our next task. The fact that Japan was able to avoid colonial rule in the nineteenth century (by 'accepting Western influence', i.e. using Western technology to build a bulwark against Western imperialism) contributed directly to the originality of the Japanese film, since it made possible the technical and economic autonomy of her film industry. From a very early date, Japan trained her own technicians, developed and A SYSTEM OF CONTRADICTIONS 3. Leyda, Jay, Dianying, p. 64. 27\n\nPage 28 GROUNDS, PREMISES 4. This was in keeping with the general policy of early Japanese capitalism: 'Foreign instructors, advisers and engineers were brought in to run a number of the new factories and train the technicians who were to run them in the future, as many as 130 being employed by the Department of Public Works alone by I879. Official policy, however, was to replace them as soon as possible by Japanese whose salaries were smaller, an attitude which led one British resident to observe that \"the Japanese only look upon foreigners as school-masters. As long as they cannot help themselves they make use of them; and then they send them about their business.\" It was precisely this, of course, that eventually made Japan's industrial technology self-sustaining, in contrast to that of other Asian countries, which remained for the most part dependent on foreign help'. (Beasley, W. G., The Modern History of Japan, p. 144. The interpolated quote is from 0. R. Black's Young Japan, I880-I; the italics are mine). 5. Wittfogel, Karl A., Oriental Despotism. 6. Marx, Karl, Capital, p. 718. printed her films in laboratories owned and operated by Japanese; she even manufactured her own raw film-stock.4 And, of course, this self-sufficiency of the infrastructure was a sine qua non for a 'free' interaction between the cinematograph and the cultural milieu. Historically speaking, Japan's avoidance of the 'colonial stage', the corollary of the construction of a modern capitalist state, carried out at twice the pace of advanced Western nations, was determined in part by a prior condition, another unique feature of Japanese history. Although Japan's 'Asiatic-ness' is undeniable (geographical situation; agrarian, rice-dominated economy), she is also the only major Asian nation never to have known what Marx defined as the Asiatic Mode of Production, characterized from earliest times in China, India, Persia, Egypt, etc., by vast hydraulic enterprises entailing the mobilization of thousands of labourers and consequently the early establishment of a powerful central government with a large civil service in its employ, and a drastic curtailment of city autonomy. This form of government, analysed by K. A. Wittfogel in his classic study of the hydraulic society,5 has been termed 'oriental despotism'. Marx had observed, however, that 'Japan, with its purely feudal organization of landed property and its developed petite culture, gives a much truer picture of the European middle ages than all our history books, dictated as these are by bourgeois prejudices.'6 Wittfogel sheds further light on this anomaly: Why did Japan's rice economy not depend on large and government-directed waterworks? Any competent economic geographer can answer this question. The peculiarities of the country's water supply neither necessitated nor favored substantial government-directed works. Innumerable mountain ranges compartmentalized the great Far Eastern islands; and their broken relief encouraged a fragmented (hydroagricultural) rather than a coordinated (hydraulic) pattern of irrigation farming and flood control... The rulers of the dominant political center effected a loose political unification at a rather early date, but they were not faced with hydraulic tasks that required the coordinated operation of large corvee teams. Nor were they conquered by the forces of an orientally despotic state. They therefore failed to establish a comprehensive managerial and acquisitive bureaucracy capable of controlling the non-governmental forces of society as did the men of the apparatus on the Chinese mainland... Many elements of Chinese culture notwithstanding, the decentralized and property-based society of the Japanese Middle Ages resembled much more closely the feudal order of the remote European world than the hydraulic patterns of nearby China. 28\n\nPage 29 However, Wittfogel goes on to add significantly: We must be careful not to oversimplify the picture. The Oriental quality of many Japanese institutions and ideas is beyond doubt. On the lower and local level, Japanese irrigation agriculture required quasi-hydraulic coordination and subordination; and feudal lords' insistence upon absolute obedience may, at least in part, reflect such quasi-hydraulic relations. Rudiments of a postal system seem to have existed prior to the Tokugawa period;... The members of the ruling group, although strongly imbued with a military spirit, continued to think in terms of somewhat adjusted Confucianism; and although they invented simplified phonetic symbols, they employed with genuine pride the Chinese script, which, like Confucius' conception of the gentleman-bureaucrat, was better suited to a civil and learned officialdom than to a war-minded knighthood.7 (We shall explore later and at some length the crucial matter of the Japanese writing system, an essential emblem of the multiform bivalence implicit in this description.) Japan was related 'in a submarginal way' as Wittfogel puts it, 'to the institutional patterns of the Asiatic world' and this undeniably made the islands a privileged terrain for the extra-mural development of important aspects of Chinese culture. Nevertheless, the remarkable parallels between Japanese and European feudalism undoubtedly made possible the rapid conversion during the Meiji period (I867-I912) to a unique variety of state capitalism, involving an immediate priority to heavy industry, a conversion paradoxically contingent upon the perpetuation of feudal social structures.8 For Japan is also the only major capitalist nation in the world today which has never known a true bourgeois revolution in any guise whatsoever.9 The Meiji Restoration of 1867 in no sense constituted a sudden shift of power from the feudal classes to the bourgeoisie. Insofar as this shift took place at all, it did so over a period of almost a century and hence so gradually that the two classes in many ways may be said to have interpenetrated (as to some extent they already had under the Tokugawas); which of course goes a long way towards explaining the longevity of ancient customs and modes of thinking. This fact is essential to any attempt to understand twentieth-century 'bourgeois ideology' in Japan, where the term is perhaps not even adequate. As for the events of 1867, the Meiji Restoration was simply the linchpin of Japan's uniquely concatenated transition to capitalism. As Sir George Sansom points out: The driving force at the Restoration and in political life for the best part of a generation thereafter was provided by leaders who A SYSTEM OF CONTRADICTIONS 7. Wittfogel, Karl A., Oriental Despotism, pp. I97-200. 8. See Norman, E. Herbert, Japan's Emergence as a Modern State. 9. Bismarck's construction of German industrial capitalism 'from the top down' bears some relation to the similar stage in Japan, and it is no accident that those who drafted the Meiji constitution (I889) took as their model the constitution of Germany. However, fundamental differences subsist between the histories of the two countries, as witness in particular the fact that while Nazism was the solution to the crisis of capitalism adopted by a German middle-class which, after the failure of the proletarian revolution, indisputably held the reality of power, the Japanese middle class was still an opposition, 'liberal' force during the period of exacerbated militarism which preceded the Second World War and which constituted the neo-feudal aristocracy's final attempt to perpetuate its absolutist rule. 29\n\nPage 30 GROUNDS, PREMISES had been brought up in a feudal, or at any rate feudalistic, atmosphere. They were for the most part dissatisfied and ambitious samurai, and their outlook was coloured by their antecedents. It was these men, and not the bourgeoisie, who laid the foundations of a capitalist structure and at the same time developed a political system that bore little resemblance to those which came into force in the advanced industrial countries of Western Europe under the influence of a powerful moneyed class.\"' As for the agrarian aspects of the Restoration, Takahashi Kohachiro sums up thus the conclusions of Japanese Marxist scholars: The agrarian reform of the Meiji Restoration made the jinushis the actual owners of the land, but they had nothing in common with the English landlords who let their land to farmers who, in keeping with the capitalist mode of production, were in turn agricultural entrepreneurs employing wage-earners. Nor do the jinushi have anything in common with the squireens of Eastern Europe who farmed their own land directly with serf-labour... The jinushi divided his land into small lots and had it worked by small farmers (kosakus) who paid as rent nearly half of their harvest, like the poverty-stricken metayers under the old r6gime in France... Thus historical comparison and perspective provide proof that the Meiji Restoration was not, properly speaking, a bourgeois revolution of the 'classical' type.1' A prosperous non-European nation which was never colonized, an Asian nation with only a 'submarginal' experience of the Asiatic Mode of Production, a nation which moved from feudalism to full-fledged capitalism without the hiatus of revolution: there are anomalies here and it is interesting to consider what role they have played in determining the constitution of a specifically and uniquely Japanese 'outlook', and what their bearing is on that 'Empire of (empty) signs' described by Roland Barthes. A comprehensive answer to such a far-reaching question is not only beyond the scope of this book but beyond the capacities of the avowedly amateur Japanologist that I am. I can only point to the direction in which I feel the answer(s) may lie, and occasionally, with more special reference to 'film history', contribute observations which I feel relevant to the problem. Now it is at this point in our undertaking that we unavoidably encounter another pair of 'contradictory' traits, exhausted by specialists of 'things Japanese'. They are described, depending upon the writer's inclinations, either as 'faculty for assimilation' and 'sense of tradition' or, alternatively, as 'lack of originality' and 'stagnant conservatism'. In either case, they are seen as sure symptoms of Io. Sansom, George B., The Western World and Japan, p. 327. W. G. Beasley (op. cit., pp. 224-5) demonstrates that the domination by the oligarchy issued from this class remained complete until the end of the Pacific War. The organs of expression of the new middle class as such - the Parties and Diet - had no more real power than the Tiers Etat under Louis XVI. I I.

We must of course move beyond these stereotypes, but we cannot bypass them: an analysis of the ideologies which they conceal is crucial to the present undertaking. Nothing has better served detractors of 'Japanese culture', nor more keenly embarrassed the bulk of its Western admirers, than the ease, indeed the eagerness, with which the Japanese, at certain periods in their history, have adopted techniques and concepts of foreign origin - among which the cinema and the modes of representation attached to it in the Western context are not the least insignificant. In drawing the inevitable comparisons between Japan and China, those who recently saw China as an ally in the struggle against fascism, those who see her today as the vanguard of socialism, were/are quick to compare the 'originality' of China's 'age-old wisdom' with Japan's 'habit of copying'. Were not Japan's writing and much of her vocabulary, broad sectors of her arts and her most 'sophisticated' religion 'lifted' wholesale from China? The ease with which she has adopted Western techniques in modern times is merely additional proof that her only 'aptitude' is a mimetic one. The champions of Japanese culture - whose number has multiplied rapidly, especially in the United States, since Japan has become 'a bulwark against Communism' - are quick to counter, but they too invoke the value of originality: the Japanese do not copy, they adapt; whatever has been borrowed has been profoundly and creatively transformed, and besides, many aspects of Japanese culture are entirely indigenous (and the list adduced in evidence is a long one, from kabuki theatre to a dish like sushi and from the Tale of Genji to origami paper-folding. Of course, there is a good deal more 'truth' in the second type of statement than in the first; what interests us here, however, is that both arguments have an ideological base since both call upon the virtues of originality. And this is where Japan has the greatest power to perturb, for in Japan, as I will abundantly illustrate, and notably in her cinema, originality has never been a dominant value. In particular, the specifically bourgeois notion that the artist is the creator and proprietor of his work is utterly meaningless within the framework of the traditional arts of Japan, and of the East in general. Plagiarism seems to have been a meaningless concept until the opening of the country. Here, then, is a fundamental point of conflict with the modern West, where the notion of the artist as demiurge, creator of works which are his inalienable property, has been an essential article of faith since the end of the eighteenth century.12 The Japanese social system denies the very concept of originality, acknowledges and A SYSTEM OF CONTRADICTIONS I2. That this notion is intimately linked with the growth of capitalism is amply demonstrated by the acknowledged intertextual practices that continued right up to the French Revolution (Chaucer's and Shakespeare's extensive borrowing of forms and material are celebrated; Michel Corrette's choral adaptation of a Vivaldi concerto is an exemplary illustration). 31\n\nPage 32 GROUNDS, PREMISES indeed deliberately emphasizes the material reality of the circulation of signs. This system erodes the very foundations of our ideology of the Creator as the Supremely Free Human Being, of the Artist-God, of the Book and the Word. The Japanese attitude here described is bound up with modes of thinking that go back to very ancient times (we shall see some of its earliest manifestations in Heian literary practice), and this preservation is the other term of our hackneyed dichotomy, traditionalism. It is true, of course, that the Japanese as a nation have always tended to 'keep things': once it's in the house, once it's proved its usefulness, you never throw it away. Trivial as this formulation is, I believe it adequately describes a phenomenon epitomized by the Imperial House with its 'two thousand years' of unbroken continuity, and perhaps even more vividly by the Shosoin at Nara, 'a warehouse of all the useful objects of the court given by the Emperor Shomu in AD 756 and almost completely preserved to the present day in its original log storage building'.13 The survival of such massive fragments of 'tradition' is largely explained by the abovementioned lack of any revolutionary disruption in Japanese history, by the gradualness of the elimination of feudal institutions, and by Japan's long period of isolation. This 'sense of tradition' is most remarkable in the permanence of its forms. Once these achieve stability, they tend to remain 'as is' for centuries. Of this complex and strange phenomenon, even the casual visitor to Japan is immediately aware. In the Meiji period, Japanese with modern tastes built into their homes a Western Room, furnished in the late nineteenth-century style of interior decoration, and such rooms, although they have largely ceased to exist in the West except in museums, remain a necessary adjunct of the well-appointed Japanese home. Some of these rooms are today decorated in a style that can be described loosely as Swedish Modern, but the majority repeat the doily, the antimacassar, the fringed table cover, the elaborate gilt picture frame, the floral carpeting and the busy design of chair and table which characterized the Victorian parlor.14 13. Lee, Sherman E., A History of Far Eastern Art, p. 272. 14. Ernst, Earle, op. cit., p. 272. 15. See Pyle, Kenneth B., The New Generation in Meiji Japan. However, this thesis is entirely my own. Many Western ideas have also been poured into a similarly permanent mould: by and large, contemporary 'liberal' and even 'socialist' thinking in Japan bears a remarkable resemblance to the ideas gleaned from the writings of Spencer, Mill and Rousseau as they were propagated in the i88os by Tokutomi Soho, the intellectual leader of the reformist opposition to the Meiji government.'5 Why is Japanese society the most 'conservative' in the 32\n\nPage 33 modern industrial world? It is true, of course, that for three hundred years the Tokugawa Shogunate went to extremes to preserve the status quo, encouraging infanticide in order to maintain the population level, allowing bridges and roads to fall into disrepair so as to discourage trade, etc.; conservatism and its 'fixative effect' can, however, be traced back another thousand years, to Japan's earliest history. It is no doubt related to the extremely difficult natural conditions under which the Japanese nation was built, in a tiny archipelago of which only I6 per cent of the land is arable, ravaged by typhoons, torrential rains, landslides, earthquakes, tidal waves and volcanic eruptions. In such precarious circumstances - and protection against the elements remained problematic until well into the twentieth century - a predominantly agrarian population will quickly seize upon any new tool which may seem useful, at the same time refusing to discard the old, as it is associated with so many tragic struggles, and may well serve again if the new tool fails. Whatever its origins - and they are certainly more complex than I can suggest here - the 'fixative effect' has played an absolutely vital role in the history of Japanese culture and particularly in the development of the arts including, as we shall see, the cinema. Its historical patterns are aptly described by the critic, Kato Shfichi:.. different types of art, generated in different periods, did not supplant each other, but co-existed and remained more or less creative from the time of their first appearance up to our time. Buddhist statues, a major genre of artistic expression in the period from the sixth to the ninth century, continued to evolve in style during the following eras, even when the picture scroll opened new possibilities for the visual representation of the world in the Heian period. Brush works with india ink flourished during the Muromachi period [I336-1573], but one school of artists remained faithful to the techniques and style of the picture scroll. Under the Tokugawa regime, a new style of painting and decorative art was established by Sotatsu and Korin; the technique of the woodcut print was elaborated to perfection. Yet artists never ceased to carve Buddhist statues or engage with great passion in brush-work painting. Practically no style ever died. In other words, the history of Japanese art is not one of succession but one of superposition.'6 The contrast, we might add, with Western art, is absolute. We encounter once again the question of originality, for the birth and death of forms and styles in the West have long been regulated by the law of supersession (and of selfconsciously neo-classical revivals) and this can be observed as easily on the walls of a museum as in the pages of a history of fashion. Conversely, the principle of superposition A SYSTEM OF CONTRADICTIONS 16. Kato Shuichi, Form, Style and Tradition, p. 4. 33\n\nPage 34 GROUNDS, PREMISES described by Kato may be readily observed in the streets of any Japanese city today, where Western-style business suits and blue jeans co-exist unostentatiously with clothes that have not changed in any significant detail for over three hundred years, which still occupy an entire floor of any popular department store. And, as we shall see, the cinema of Japan has borne at almost every stage the stamp of this superposition, even up to the present day. 34\n\nPage 35 2. ASystem of Signs It is in the period of the Fujiwara Regents' that there were formed among upper-class men and women in privileged situations certain standards of personal behaviour and certain canons of aesthetic judgement which are the source, or it might be better to say the foundation of Japanese social life as it developed in later centuries.2 It follows from this judgement by the West's most eminent historian of Japan that a detour through the social and literary practices of the Heian court is indispensable if we are to bring to light the theoretical implications of Japanese aesthetic practice as a whole. And our first task will be a cursory consideration of the writing system which made Heian literature materially possible and which in itself contained some of the seeds from which the forms and styles of that period, its writing in the strongest sense, may be seen to grow. We know that it was long before the Heian period, probably in AD 552, that Chinese writing was first introduced to Japan by way of Korea, in several volumes of Buddhist scriptures, which were also to initiate the spread of the great continental religion to the island empire. Almost from the outset it seems that while the learned clergy strove to master the Chinese language as a written (and occasionally spoken) whole, efforts were also made to adapt the Chinese characters to the forms of spoken Japanese, a polysyllabic, inflected language, quite in contrast on these two fundamental counts to Chinese. The methods used were several and complex, but in summary we may say that a partial phoneticization of the essentially non-phonetic Chinese writing was undertaken: the sounds of spoken Japanese were assigned to characters whose pronunciation in Chinese was thought to approximate those sounds, while at the same time these same characters - and many more whose original sound may have been irrelevant to the native language - were also used to represent 'ideographically' Japanese words of equivalent meaning.3 I. The reign of the Fujiwara family as the power behind the throne is associated with the first of several periods during which the imperial capital, Heian-Kyo (later Kyoto), was the seat of actual political power (794-I119). 2.

The Korean writing system has, for three hundred years, been similarly dual. 1 do not know if this is related to the Japanese invasion of Korea at the end of the fifteenth century. 5. In the sense that Chinese writing itself can be said to be non-phonetic. Actually Chinese characters contain quasi-phonetic 'operators', but the Chinese language contains no purely phonetic characters, as any text written in Japanese invariably does (there are no kanji for such particles as no, wa, to, for Western loan words or verb inflexions). This method of writing (kana majiri, i.e. mixed phonetic writing) made possible the first written poetry, recorded in the early chronicles and in the first of the great imperial anthologies, the Manyoshu (759). However, this phonetic use of the Chinese characters was cumbersome at best: the ambiguities involved in the double function of certain signs made reading an arduous task, while the inflexions of Japanese verbs and adjectives often required as many as five or six complex characters to express phonetically what in pure Chinese would have been a single sign/concept. Gradually, however, during the course of the Heian period, by a process of stylization and codification, a specifically Japanese syllabary (hiragana) was developed, partly in relation to a general reaction to the overwhelming ChinesL influence of the previous three centuries, partly in response to the growing needs of both the administration and coui society. Not only did the new script 'liberate' the Chinese characters (kanji) from the burden of phonetic expression but it promoted the emergence of one of the world's great literatures. For a long time, kana majiri in its many forms continued to be assiduously practised by statesmen aind clergy in their non-literary writing, while the great novels and poetry of the Heian period were written in a script largely dominated by the phonetic system. The ultimate result of this co-existence of two fundamentally different types of writing, the one phonetic and the other primarily non-phonetic, was the creation of a unique system which incorporates both.4 The walls of a Tokyo subway station today bear signs on which the name of the station can be read in three different scripts: kanji, since every Japanese proper name possesses a Chinese character or set of characters which has become attached to the phonetic signifier through a process of historical selection; hiragana, since of course the syllabary may at least theoretically be used to transcribe any word used in the Japanese language, even if it is not normally so written (or to render, in terms of Japanese pronunciation, any words of foreign origin that need to be incorporated into the language); and finally romaji or Roman characters. This last adjunct, needless to say, is intended for foreign visitors or residents, just as hiragana assists out-of-towners or anyone else who may know the name of the station they want, but do not necessarily know how it is written in kanji, a fact which often causes arduous problems in the use of the telephone directory, for example. The individual Japanese maintains throughout his or her lifetime a continually growing relationship with the written language, one which moves constantly towards a greater mastery of the nonphonetics but which can never entirely abandon the phone 36\n\nPage 37 tic, which involves indeed continually turning back to the phonetic, whenever it is necessary to distinguish between the several possible meanings (and pronunciations) of a given kanji. Japanese school-children learn successively four different scripts: hiragana, romaji, katakana (equivalent to our block printing and derived from the Chinese characters of kana majiri by a process of subtraction and geometricalization as opposed to the cursive stylization which produced hiragana) and kanji. Of course, very few Japanese ever learn all of the thousands of Chinese characters which constitute the supposed baggage of a highly educated Japanese. The minimum number of characters required of the high-school graduate is 1,850, but every Japanese, to some extent, goes on learning new characters all his life (and needless to say, the literary sophistication of an individual is judged by his or her repertoire of kanji, of a text by the ratio of kanji to kana or phonetic signs). This rather long historical r6sum6 was necessary to demonstrate one basic point of great theoretical importance: the Japanese are the only people in the world who, for over a thousand years, have practised simultaneously and in close symbiosis a phonetic and a non-phonetic writing without taking either as the privileged centre of language.6 This is in marked contrast with the experience of the Vietnamese, for example, upon whom a phonetic alphabet was bestowed by French priests early in their colonial history and who soon lost touch completely with the Chinese script which they too had adopted from their northern neighbours. (This effect of European colonialism is of considerable significance, as we shall see.) What is the relevance to our investigation of this unparalleled cohabitation? The answer to this question is facilitated by a consideration of one of the basic premises of the work of the French philosopher Jacques Derrida.7 Derrida's fundamental critique may be said to proceed from this simple observation: throughout the modern history of the Western world, writing has been regarded as the passive member of the family of language, a mere transcription of speech, of the logos, regarded as the repository of ultimate truth, whilst writing was merely the contingent temporal 'form' given to the essential and ultimately divine content. As it has been more or less implicitly defined, the essence of the phone is regarded as immediately next to that which in 'thought' is related as logos to 'meaning', producing, receiving, articulating and resembling meaning. If Aristotle, for example, holds that 'the sounds uttered by the voice... are the symbols of the moods of the soul... and written words the symbols of the words uttered by A SYSTEM OF SIGNS 6. The earliest Chinese translations of Buddhist scriptures from sanskrit involved a phonetic use of Chinese characters in the transcription of both untranslatable Indian names and semantically meaningless incantations (see Sansom, An Historical Grammar). The fact that this practice never developed into a full-fledged syllabary but died out rapidly points to a fundamental distinction between Chinese and Japanese 'cultures'. 7. I am fully aware of the schematic and incomplete character of the following account, but it is impossible to explore this subtle body of thought in depth here. Readers already familiar with Derrida's writings will, I hope, grant me their indulgence, while others who find special interest in these problems will refer to the original text (Derrida, Jacques, De la Grammatologie). 37\n\nPage 38 GROUNDS, PREMISES the voice' (On Interpretation, i, i6 3) it is because the voice, as producer of the primary symbols, is in a relationship of essential and immediate proximity to the soul. As producer of the primary signifier, the voice is not just one signifier among many. It signifies the 'mood of the soul' which in turn reflects back, or is a reflection of, things in terms of resemblance. Between Being and Soul, between things and affections, there is assumed to be a relationship of natural translation or signification; between the Soul and the Logos, a conventionally symbolic relation. And the prime convention, regarded as immediately related to the order of natural and universal signification, is presumably produced as spoken language. The written language in this view merely fixes conventions linking other conventions.8 This Aristotelian doctrine has been refined and developed by nine centuries of Christianity and two centuries of bourgeois rule. It has, however, never ceased to determine that Western attitude towards language which Derrida terms logocentrism, demonstrating its decisive complicity with metaphysics and philosophical idealism - often through the metaphorical conceit by which the Word significantly becomes Book, Scripture. This outlook Derrida illustrates by a quotation from Rousseau: 'It was as if Nature spread out before our eyes all Her Magnificence as text for our conversations... And so I closed all books, for there is one that is open for all eyes, the Book of Nature. And it is through that great and sublime Book that I learn to serve and worship its author' (Emile, Profession de foi). Thus good writing has always been that which is precisely meant to be understood: within a Nature or a Natural Law, created or not, but originally conceived as an eternal presence. Understood and contained, then, within a totality and wrapped in a tome. The idea of a book is that of a totalization, finite or infinite, of the signifier; that constituted totality of signifiers is pre-existent to the book, watches over its inscription and its signs, ideally it is independent from it. It is the encyclopaedic protection of theology and logocentrism against the disruption of writing...9 (We shall begin to see the importance of this opposition closed book/open text in relation to Heian poetry.) At the same time, phonetic writing - which Derrida takes care to distinguish, as we shall see, from the 'generalized' notion of writing (the sense of writing) - has been intimately linked with the growth of science which empowered Western capitalism to exercise an undisputed world hegemony, for 'the very notion of science was born at a certain stage of writing... it was conceived and formulated as task, idea, project in a language implying a certain type of specific 8. ibid., pp. 21-2. This theme is also dealt with at length in Derrida's Speech and Phenomena. 9. ibid, pp. 30-1. 38\n\nPage 39 relationships - structural and axiological - between speech and writing'.10 Another quotation from Rousseau, placed as epigraph to the first part of Derrida's essay, points to the essentially ethnocentric character of logocentrism: 'These three manners of writing correspond fairly accurately to the three various states under which we may say that men come together as a Nation. Depicting objects is suited to savages; signs and words and propositions to barbarians; and the alphabet to civilised peoples' (Essai sur l'origine des langues). The Japanese, of course, unbeknownst to Rousseau, were already a 'civilized people' and it is not perhaps entirely absurd to think that there is some real correlation between the instrumental requirements of a feudal warrior class whose objective ambition for some nine hundred years was national unity organized in a strictly policed hierarchy around a strong central government, and the social 'practicality' of a phonetic script. Many war-lords of the pre-Tokugawa era who contributed to Japan's unification could write only kana; it is more than probable that the time-consuming mastery of the Chinese characters would have been incompatible with their political and military activities. And it may even be argued that the secular practice of phonetic writing contributed substantially to the preparation that enabled the Japanese to cope with Western science and technology far sooner and better than peoples whose writing has remained entirely non-phonetic to the present day. However, we must avoid the all too familiar temptation of placing Japan 'on our side'. For the purposes of this study, the most important single consequence of this unique double practice is that the Japanese, during most of their 'civilized' history, had a continual, day-to-day experience of an absolutely critical linguistic difference which the peoples of Europe and China could grasp only 'theoretically' through the study of foreign systems. This difference is inscribed within their language, where it may not be too far-fetched to see it as a 'functioning emblem' of that difference which Derrida, developing an idea of Saussure's, has taught us to be the intangible principle of language: If the conceptual part of value is constituted solely by relationships and with regard to the other terms of the language, the same may be said of its material part; what counts in a word is not the sound itself but the phonic differences which enable us to distinguish this word from all others, for it is they that convey meaning... A fragment of language could never be founded on anything but its non-coincidence with the rest. Derrida argues from this passage in Saussure's Cours de linguistique generale (p. 163) that A SYSTEM OF SIGNS io. ibid, p. 42. 39\n\nPage 40 GROUNDS, PREMISES before being or not being 'noted', 'represented', 'figured'... the linguistic sign implies originating writing. Whence the generalization in his work of the notion of writing in order to demonstrate that logocentrism and a hypothetical 'grapho-centrism' are equal and opposite ideologies; both speech and writing derive from 'difference as the source of all linguistic value.' l Whatever the metaphysical perils of this originating postulate, Derrida's analysis does point up the fact that the Japanese writing system occupies a privileged middle ground, nearer perhaps than either the Chinese or the Indo-European systems to a dialectically constituted level of reference of languages. It may thereby afford access to both a linear mode of linguistic representation, such as that of the West, and to an 'oriental' mode which it is legitimate to regard, in a theoretical perspective, as a 'practical' critique of linearity. The linearization of writing and the linear conception of speech are rooted in the Western sense of time based on movement in space. Saussure's whole theory of 'the linearity of the signifier' can, according to Derrida, be interpreted from this point of view.12 That Chinese writing (and hieroglyphic writing in general) is distinguishable from phonetic writing by its (semantic) non-linearity is a truism. That this difference should correspond to that between ancient Chinese thought and the main-stream of the Greco-Christian tradition is not quite so obvious. A glimpse of this fundamental hiatus is offered by Joseph Needham: i. ibid., p. 77. 12. Derrida adduces in support of this statement the following quotation from Saussure: 'The acoustical signifiers have only the line of time at their disposal; their elements appear one after another; they form a chain. This characteristic is apparent as soon as they are represented in writing... The signifier, as it is auditory by nature, unfolds only in time and possesses the characteristics which it borrows from time (a) it represents an extension and (b) that extension is measurable in only one dimension: it is a line.' (Cours de linguistique generale, p. 103.) 13. Needham, Joseph, Science and Civilization in China, Vol. 2, pp. 288-9. The implication was that the universe itself is a vast organism, with now one now another component taking the lead - spontaneous and uncreated it is, with all the parts co-operating in a mutual service which is perfect freedom, the larger and the smaller playing their parts according to their degree 'neither afore nor after.'... The conviction that the universe and each of the wholes composing it have a cyclical nature, undergoing alternations, so dominated [Chinese] thought that the idea of succession was always subordinated to that of interdependence. Thus retrospective explanations were not felt to involve any difficulty. 'Such and such a lord, in his lifetime, was not able to obtain the hegemony because, after his death, human victims were sacrificed to him.' Both facts were simply part of one timeless pattern.'3 Our examination of certain aspects of Japanese literary practice will demonstrate that Japan has always resembled China in this 'indifference' to linear causality: 'Chinese cosmology when it became known to the Japanese undoubtedly impressed them by its range and its coherence. It had great influence upon their minds, an influence which still 40\n\nPage 41 endures. Far Eastern people are apt to hark back to this ancient theory and think in terms of its catalogue for the guidance of their lives.\"' In conclusion, I would further claim that in those areas in which the Japanese mind has been most productive (not in philosophy or science, but in the arts and letters), this double experience of linear and non-linear writing modes may have helped them to radicalize Chinese thought in their aesthetic practice. A SYSTEM OF SIGNS 14. Sansom, George,A History ofJapan to I334, p. 73. 41\n\nPage 42 3. A Boundless Text The earliest examples of Japanese writing convey the prime social importance which this activity was to assume, even at its most literary, throughout the formative years of her history. The Kojiki (712) and the Nihon Shoki (720) were both chronicles designed to legitimize the reign and power of the imperial house by instituting, through writing, Japanese mytho-history and in particular, the divine ancestry of the imperial house. Not only did writing remain for centuries the privileged instrument of the dominant political class - a characteristic of the early stages of all societies - but within that class writing was to occupy a place in the social order such that it may practically be said to have been the social equal of speech. However, it was not until after the seat of imperial rule had moved from Nara to Heian-Kyo in 794 that textual practice became in fact a way of life for court and clergy (i.e. virtually all of literate Japan). It is indicative of the social concern with language in general that characterizes this age (and which can certainly be traced to China) that the very name of Heian-Kyo should be polysemous. Read as such, the words mean the City of Peace and Tranquillity, but 'apart from having an auspicious ring (the latter part of the eighth century had witnessed a great deal of political strife and bloodshed), the name combined the first and last syllables of Heijo, Japan's earliest real city, and Ch'ang an, the great T'ang metropolis on which Heian, like the former capitals, was modelled.\"' As we shall see, this polysemy will be an essential feature of Heian literature. I have already pointed out that Japanese literature began to flourish about the time of the codification of the native syllabary, which soon became so dominant in the novels and poetry of the next few centuries, while the Chinese script continued to hold sway with comparable exclusiveness in documents of state, commerce, etc. This division of labour, so to speak, was related to the radical discrimination between the sexes in the upper classes, I. Morris, Ivan, The World of the Shining Prince, p. i8. This remarkable portrait of Heian society was the source of much of the material set forth here. 42\n\nPage 43 who considered it unseemly for women to read or write kanji. China and her language were still regarded as the repositories of all true learning (much as were Greece, Rome and their languages in the West), and of course too much learning was 'not good' for women. It was among the idle and often, in fact, highly educated women of the court that there arose the world's earliest corpus of novels, as we understand the term today. Foremost among these was Murasaki Shikibu's monumental Tale of Genji (Genji Monogatari). Despite this sexual segregation, male courtiers also employed the syllabary in the writing of poems, partly because many were in fact epistles addressed to women who, in theory at least, could not read kanji. Another reason was the fact that this poetry presumably derived from specifically oral tradition and was, as we shall see, associated with specifically oral practices. Still another reason was that, considering the amount of versification required by even the most trifling social occasion, the syllabary was much more convenient. The composition, exchange, and quotation of poems was central to the daily life of the Heian aristocracy, and it is doubtful whether any other society in the world has ever attached such importance to the poetic versatility of its members.... Upperclass Heian life was punctuated with poetry from beginning to end, and no important event was complete without it. Birth was attended by an avalanche of congratulatory verse; poetry exchanges were a central part of the formal courting ceremonies; and, when death approached, the Heian gentleman would round out his existence with a parting poem.2 And, of course, poetry-writing was essential to the countless love-affairs which were among the chief occupations of that society: upon first glimpsing (or even simply hearing about) a prospective partner, a man would send her a poem, and she would reply with another. This preliminary exchange might continue for days or even weeks; if the gentleman's suit were ultimately successful, a meeting would be arranged at which the moment of consummation was preceded by graceful allusions to the themes and phraseology of the poetry that had led up to it, including perhaps oral improvisations of new poems. Next came the obligatory 'morning after poems,' and then for days, weeks or months messengers were kept busy scurrying back and forth between the two lovers, often at intervals of only a few hours, until at length the inevitable poems of parting were exchanged. And the beauty of the writing itself was as important as the text: it was quite customary for a man or a woman to fall in love with a person of A BOUNDLESS TEXT 2. ibid., pp. 190-92. 43\n\nPage 44 GROUNDS, PREMISES 3.

Tanka, like renga and haikai, continue to be practised to this day by millions of Japanese. 5. The relatively rare (to the tanka) form of this poem is called choka in this early period, nagauta when it became, in the seventeenth century, the foundation of the kabuki text. whom he or she had glimpsed only a sample of his or her calligraphy. 'Handwriting, it was the general belief, revealed (or rather expressed) character, breeding, distinction, and other qualities more clearly than speech, and it ranked high among the fine arts.'3 For it must be pointed out that this 'reading' of calligraphy had nothing in common with Western handwriting analysis; it was the purely aesthetic quality of the writing, its plastic rather than its personal or 'psychological' qualities which were being weighed thus, as signs of personal virtues: for good and evil in this society were equated with beauty and ugliness. One significant feature of Heian poetry is that an overwhelming share of it was written in a single, strictly codified and remarkably brief form, the tanka: five periods consisting of five, seven, five, seven and seven syllables respectively. It is remarkable - and this is but one instance of that 'boundless' textuality with which we are concerned - that this alternation of five- and sevensyllable periods, already present in pre-Heian poetry, continued to determine the morphology of nearly all Japanese verse (in both its literary and theatrical forms), even after tanka had 'given way'4 to renga, renga to haikai and haikai to the late Tokugawa lampoons called senru. And the same will be found to be true of the decisive characteristics of Heian literature as a whole, namely polysemy and intertextuality. One of the earliest masterpieces of Japanese poetry, and which pre-dates the installation of the imperial capital at Heian-Kyo by nearly a century, already constitutes one of the most staggeringly sophisticated uses of polysemy to be found in the literature of any language. It is 'On Seeing the Body of a Man Lying Among the Stones on the Island of Samine in Sanuku Province' by the greatest master of the period, Kakinomoto Hitomaro (c. 68o-700).5 44\n\nPage 45 Tamamo yoshi Sanuki no kuni wa Kunikara ka Miredo mo akanu Kamakura ka Kokoda totoki Ametsuchi Hitsuki to tomo ni Tariyuka Kami no miomi to Tsugite kuru Naka no minato yu Fune ukete Wa ga kogikureba Toki tsu kaze Kumoi ni fuku ni Oki mireba Toinami tachi He mireba Shiranami sawaku Isanatori Umi o kashikomi Yuku fune no Kaji hikiorite Ochikochi no Shima wa okedo Nakuwashi Samine no shima no Arisomo ni Torite mireba Nami no to no Shigeki hamabe o Shikitae no Makura ni nashite Aradoko ni Korofusu kimi ga Ie shiraba Yukite no tsugen Tsuma shiraba Ki mo towamashi o Tamahoko no Michi dani shirazu Oboboshiku Machi ka kou ran Hashiki tsumara wa.

T1he most remarkable thing about this syntax is the way in which it plays upon certain inflectional endings of verbs and adjectives in aln ambiguous fashion. In eleven instances there are c(nstructions that may be taken as finite and so co-)nclusive, but at the same time as attributives to what follows. In short. what Hitomaro has really done is to present us with a poem that consists of a single sentence in which every successive syntactic element is governed by what precedes, all the way back to the beginning of the poem. More than this, the last word and the particle tsLuLara vwa (topic: 'as for [your] wife', with the suggestion in the endearment plural rfc of fi-mily, homeland, and all associated with her), are not only governed by everything that precedes but also are the beginning of the 'main' sentence of the poem, a sentence that stops with no more than this topic. Such syntax is unimaginable in English, but something of its effect can be gained by beginning with the last word of the Japanese and working back in translation, without a break, to the initial line of the poem.... Primarily what interests [tlitornaro] is not so much the actors as the actions, not st much the issue of responsibility as the integrated nature of the process of a complex experience. Consequently, there are verbs in abundance and noun images to create the scene vividly. And the syntax is so organized that in spite of the numerous semi-stops, the stops are transformed into attributives for the noun-clauses that follow. The skill involved is prodigious, as one can see fron the transition between the first and second section. The first section ends with the verbs tstugite kurru forming an idiom something like 'transmitted'. The effect is to say that it has been transmitted that the land of Sanuki is divine. But kuru is also used separately, apart from the idiom and attributively, for the next clause. Here kuru achieves more of its usual sense as an active verb in a clause someithing like 'coming to the harbor of Naka', as if one could take in E-nglish the '-mit' from 'transmit' and use it inll its root Latin sense of 'send' as part (If the relative clause.
