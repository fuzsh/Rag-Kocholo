We found that they showed distinct patterns of expression in the intervertebral discs of late stage fish larvae and adult zebrafish. A segmented pattern of GFP expression was detected in the intervertebral disc of twhh:gfp transgenic fish. In contrast, little GFP expression was found in the intervertebral disc of shh:gfp transgenic fish. Treating twhh:gfp transgenic zebrafish larvae with exogenous retinoic acid (RA), a teratogenic factor on normal development, resulted in disruption of notochord segmentation and formation of oversized vertebrae. Histological analysis revealed that the oversized vertebrae are likely due to vertebral fusion. These studies demonstrate that the twhh:gfp transgenic zebrafish is a useful model for studying vertebral segmentation and disc formation, and moreover, that RA signaling may play a role in this process.\n\nEstablishment of oct4:gfp transgenic zebrafish line for monitoring cellular multipotency by GFP fluorescence.\n\nPubMed\n\nKato, Hiroyuki; Abe, Kota; Yokota, Shinpei; Matsuno, Rinta; Mikekado, Tsuyoshi; Yokoi, Hayato; Suzuki, Tohru\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe establishment of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell technology in fish could facilitate the establishment of novel cryopreservation techniques for storing selected aquaculture strains as frozen cells. In order to apply iPS cell technology to fish, we established a transgenic zebrafish line, Tg(Tru.oct4:EGFP), using green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under the control of the oct4 gene promoter as a marker to evaluate multipotency in iPS cell preparations. We used the oct4 promoter from fugu (Takifugu rubripes) due to the compact nature of the fugu genome and to facilitate future applications of this technology in marine fishes. During embryogenesis, maternal GFP fluorescence was observed at the cleavage stage and zygotic GFP expression was observed from the start of the shield stage until approximately 24Â h after fertilization. gfp messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed by whole embryonic cells at the shield stage, and then restricted to the caudal neural tube in the latter stages of embryogenesis. These observations showed that GFP fluorescence and the regulation of gfp mRNA expression by the exogenous fugu oct4 promoter are well suited for monitoring endogenous oct4 mRNA expression in embryos. Bisulfite sequencing revealed that the rate of CpG methylation in the transgenic oct4 promoter was high in adult cells (98%) and low in embryonic cells (37%). These findings suggest that, as with the endogenous oct4 promoter, demethylation and methylation both take place normally in the transgenic oct4 promoter during embryogenesis. The embryonic cells harvested at the shield stage formed embryonic body-like cellular aggregates and maintained GFP fluorescence for 6Â d when cultured on Transwell-COL Permeable Supports or a feeder layer of adult fin cells. Loss of GFP fluorescence by cultured cells was correlated with cellular differentiation. We consider that the Tg(Tru.oct4:EGFP) zebrafish line established here is well suited for monitoring multipotency in\n\nDevelopment of a transgenic zebrafish model expressing GFP in the notochord, somite and liver directed by the hfe2 gene promoter.\n\nPubMed\n\nBian, Yue-Hong; Xu, Cheng; Li, Junling; Xu, Jin; Zhang, Hongwei; Du, Shao Jun\n\n2011-08-01\n\nHemojuvelin, also known as RGMc, is encoded by hfe2 gene that plays an important role in iron homeostasis. hfe2 is specifically expressed in the notochord, developing somite and skeletal muscles during development. The molecular regulation of hfe2 expression is, however, not clear. We reported here the characterization of hfe2 gene expression and the regulation of its tissue-specific expression in zebrafish embryos. We demonstrated that the 6Â kb 5'-flanking sequence upstream of the ATG start codon in the zebrafish hfe2 gene could direct GFP specific expression in the notochord, somites, and skeletal muscle of zebrafish embryos, recapitulating the expression pattern of the endogenous gene. However, the Tg(hfe2:gfp) transgene is also expressed in the liver of fish embryos, which did not mimic the expression of the endogenous hfe2 at the early stage. Nevertheless, the Tg(hfe2:gfp) transgenic zebrafish provides a useful model to study liver development. Treating Tg(hfe2:gfp) transgenic zebrafish embryos with valproic acid, a liver development inhibitor, significantly inhibited GFP expression in zebrafish. Together, these data indicate that the tissue specific expression of hfe2 in the notochord, somites and muscles is regulated by regulatory elements within the 6Â kb 5'-flanking sequence of the hfe2 gene. Moreover, the Tg(hfe2:gfp) transgenic zebrafish line provides a useful model system for analyzing liver development in zebrafish.\n\nQuantitative GFP fluorescence as an indicator of arsenite developmental toxicity in mosaic heat shock protein 70 transgenic zebrafish\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nSeok, Seung-Hyeok; Baek, Min-Won; Lee, Hui-Young\n\n2007-12-01\n\nIn transgenic zebrafish (Danio rerio), green fluorescent protein (GFP) is a promising marker for environmental pollutants. In using GFP, one of the obstacles which we faced was how to compare toxicity among different toxicants or among a specific toxicant in different model species with the intensity of GFP expression. Using a fluorescence detection method, we first validated our method for estimating the amount of GFP fluorescence present in transgenic fish, which we used as an indicator of developmental toxicity caused by the well-known toxicant, arsenite. To this end, we developed mosaic transgenic zebrafish with the human heat shock response elementmoreÂ Â» (HSE) fused to the enhanced GFP (EGFP) reporter gene to indicate exposure to arsenite. We confirmed that EGFP expression sites correlate with gross morphological disruption caused by arsenite exposure. Arsenite (300.0 {mu}M) caused stronger EGFP fluorescence intensity and quantity than 50.0 {mu}M and 10.0 {mu}M arsenite in our transgenic zebrafish. Furthermore, arsenite-induced apoptosis was demonstrated by TUNEL assay. Apoptosis was inhibited by the antioxidant, N-acetyl-cystein (NAC) in this transgenic zebrafish. The distribution of TUNEL-positive cells in embryonic tissues was correlated with the sites of arsenite toxicity and EGFP expression. The EGFP values quantified using the standard curve equation from the known GFP quantity were consistent with the arsenite-induced EGFP expression pattern and arsenite concentration, indicating that this technique can be a reliable and applicable measurement. In conclusion, we propose that fluorescence-based EGFP quantification in transgenic fish containing the hsp70 promoter-EGFP reporter-gene construct is a useful indicator of development toxicity caused by arsenite.Â«Â less\n\nA functional Bucky ball-GFP transgene visualizes germ plasm in living zebrafish.\n\nPubMed\n\nRiemer, Stephan; Bontems, Franck; Krishnakumar, Pritesh; GÃ¶mann, Jasmin; Dosch, Roland\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn many animals, the germline is specified by maternal RNA-granules termed germ plasm. The correct localization of germ plasm during embryogenesis is therefore crucial for the specification of germ cells. In zebrafish, we previously identified Bucky ball (Buc) as a key regulator of germ plasm formation. Here, we used a Buc antibody to describe its continuous germ plasm localization. Moreover, we generated a transgenic Buc-GFP line for live imaging, which visualizes germ plasm from its assembly during oogenesis up to the larval stages. Live imaging of Buc-GFP generated stunning movies, as they highlighted the dynamic details of germ plasm movements. Moreover, we discovered that Buc was still detected in primordial germ cells 2 days after fertilization. Interestingly, the transgene rescued buc mutants demonstrating genetically that the Buc-GFP fusion protein is functional. These results show that Buc-GFP exerts all biochemical interactions essential for germline development and highlight the potential of this line to analyze the molecular regulation of germ plasm formation.

However, when imaging GFP-labeled cells using confocal microscopy, it is often essential to simultaneously visualize all of the cells in the embryo using dual-channel fluorescence to provide an embryological context for the cells expressing GFP. Although various counterstains are available, part of their fluorescence overlaps with the GFP emission spectra, making it difficult to clearly identify the cells expressing GFP. In this study, we report that a new fluorophore, BODIPY TR methyl ester dye, serves as a versatile vital counterstain for visualizing the cellular dynamics of morphogenesis within living GFP transgenic zebrafish embryos. The fluorescence of this photostable synthetic dye is spectrally separate from GFP fluorescence, allowing dual-channel, three-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) confocal image data sets of living specimens to be easily acquired. These image data sets can be rendered subsequently into uniquely informative 3D and 4D visualizations using computer-assisted visualization software. We discuss a variety of immediate and potential applications of BODIPY TR methyl ester dye as a vital visualization counterstain for GFP in transgenic zebrafish embryos.

To create an animal model that allows observation of exocrine cell differentiation, proliferation, and morphogenesis in living animals, we used the zebrafish elastaseA (elaA) regulatory sequence to develop transgenic zebrafish that display highly specific exocrine pancreas expression of GFP in both larvae and adult. By following GFP expression, we found that the pancreas in early development was a relatively compact organ and later extended posterior along the intestine. By transferring the elaA:gfp transgene into slow muscle omitted mutant that is deficientmoreÂ Â» in receiving Hedgehog signals, we further showed that Hedgehog signaling is required for exocrine morphogenesis but not for cell differentiation. We also applied the morpholino knockdown and toxin-mediated cell ablation approaches to this transgenic line. We showed that the development of exocrine pancreas is Islet-1 dependent. Injection of the diphtheria toxin A (DTA) construct under the elastaseA promoter resulted in selective ablation of exocrine cells while the endocrine cells and other endodermal derivatives (liver and intestine) were not affected. Thus, our works demonstrated the new transgenic line provided a useful experimental tool in analyzing exocrine pancreas development.Â«Â less\n\nDynamic and differential expression of the gonadal aromatase during the process of sexual differentiation in a novel transgenic cyp19a1a-eGFP zebrafish line.\n\nPubMed\n\nHinfray, Nathalie; Sohm, FrÃ©dÃ©ric; Caulier, Morgane; Chadili, Edith; Piccini, Benjamin; Torchy, Camille; Porcher, Jean-Marc; Guiguen, Yann; Brion, FranÃ§ois\n\n2018-05-15\n\nIn zebrafish, there exists a clear need for new tools to study sex differentiation dynamic and its perturbation by endocrine disrupting chemicals. In this context, we developed and characterized a novel transgenic zebrafish line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the zebrafish cyp19a1a (gonadal aromatase) promoter. In most gonochoristic fish species including zebrafish, cyp19a1a, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of estrogens, has been shown to play a critical role in the processes of reproduction and sexual differentiation. This novel cyp19a1a-eGFP transgenic line allowed a deeper characterization of expression and localization of cyp19a1a gene in zebrafish gonads both at the adult stage and during development. At the adult stage, GFP expression was higher in ovaries than in testis. We showed a perfect co-expression of GFP and endogenous Cyp19a1a protein in gonads that was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of peri-follicular cells in the ovary and of Leydig and germ cells in the testis. During development, GFP was expressed in all immature gonads of 20 dpf-old zebrafish. Then, GFP expression increased in early differentiated female at 30 and 35dpf to reach a high GFP intensity in well-differentiated ovaries at 40dpf. On the contrary, males consistently displayed low GFP expression as compared to female whatever their stage of development, resulting in a clear dimorphic expression between both sexes. Interestingly, fish that undergoes ovary-to-testis transition (35 and 40dpf) presented GFP levels similar to males or intermediate between females and males. In this transgenic line our results confirm that cyp19a1a is expressed early during development, before the histological differentiation of the gonads, and that the down-regulation of cyp19a1a expression is likely responsible for the testicular differentiation. Moreover, we show that although cyp19a1a expression exhibits a clear dimorphic expression pattern in gonads during\n\nGeneration of Tg(cyp1a:gfp) Transgenic Zebrafish for Development of a Convenient and Sensitive In Vivo Assay for Aryl Hydrocarbon Receptor Activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Hongyan; Li, Caixia; Li, Yan; Ng, Grace Hwee Boon; Liu, Chunsheng; Zhang, Xiaoyan; Gong, Zhiyuan\n\n2015-12-01\n\nBoth dioxins/dioxin-like compounds and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent organic pollutants and cause multiple adverse health effects on human and wildlife. Cyp1a is the most commonly used biomarker induced by these pollutants through activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway. Here we generated Tg(cyp1a:gfp) transgenic zebrafish for establishing a convenient in vivo assay for analysing these xenobiotic compounds. The Tg(cyp1a:gfp) larvae at 4 day post-fertilization were tested with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), and GFP induction was observed mainly in the kidney, liver and gut. Similar GFP expression was also induced strongly by two dioxin-like chemicals, co-planar polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB126) and polychlorinated dibenzo-p-furan (PeCDF) and relatively weakly by two PAHs, 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC) and benzo[a]pyrene (BAP). The lowest observed effective concentration (LOEC) of TCDD was estimated to be â¼1 pM and the EC50 (effective concentration to induce GFP in 50 % of Tg(cyp1a:gfp) larvae) was â¼10 pM. PCB126 and PeCDF had â¼10Ã lower potencies in GFP induction than TCDD, while the potencies for 3-MC and BAP were at least 1000Ã lower. The sensitivity of Tg(cyp1a:gfp) larvae to respond TCDD was also favourable compared to that of ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay in both zebrafish larvae and adult livers. As GFP-based assay in transgenic zebrafish can be easily accommodated in multi-well dishes, the Tg(cyp1a:gfp) zebrafish should provide not only a valuable biomonitoring tool for aquatic contaminants but also a potential high-throughput chemical screening platform for identification of new AhR agonists.\n\nA transgenic zebrafish model for monitoring xbp1 splicing and endoplasmic reticulum stress in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Junling; Chen, Zhiliang; Gao, Lian-Yong; Colorni, Angelo; Ucko, Michal; Fang, Shengyun; Du, Shao Jun\n\n2015-08-01\n\nAccumulation of misfolded or unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) triggers ER stress that initiates unfolded protein response (UPR). XBP1 is a transcription factor that mediates one of the key signaling pathways of UPR to cope with ER stress through regulating gene expression. Activation of XBP1 involves an unconventional mRNA splicing catalyzed by IRE1 endonuclease that removes an internal 26 nucleotides from xbp1 mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm. Researchers have taken advantage of this unique activation mechanism to monitor XBP1 activation, thereby UPR, in cell culture and transgenic models. Here we report a Tg(ef1Î±:xbp1Î´-gfp) transgenic zebrafish line to monitor XBP1 activation using GFP as a reporter especially in zebrafish oocytes and developing embryos. The Tg(ef1Î±:xbp1Î´-gfp) transgene was constructed using part of the zebrafish xbp1 cDNA containing the splicing element. ER stress induced splicing results in the cDNA encoding a GFP-tagged partial XBP1 without the transactivation activation domain (XBP1Î-GFP). The results showed that xbp1 transcripts mainly exist as the spliced active isoform in unfertilized oocytes and zebrafish embryos prior to zygotic gene activation at 3 hours post fertilization. A strong GFP expression was observed in unfertilized oocytes, eyes, brain and skeletal muscle in addition to a weak expression in the hatching gland. Incubation of transgenic zebrafish embryos with (dithiothreitol) DTT significantly induced XBP1Î-GFP expression. Collectively, these studies unveil the presence of maternal xbp1 splicing in zebrafish oocytes, fertilized eggs and early stage embryos. The Tg(ef1Î±:xbp1Î´-gfp) transgenic zebrafish provides a useful model for in vivo monitoring xbp1 splicing during development and under ER stress conditions. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This gene has two major characteristics: (i) it is only expressed in radial glial progenitors in the brain of fish and (ii) it is exquisitely sensitive to estrogens. Based on these properties, we demonstrate that natural or synthetic hormones (alone or in binary mixture), including androgens or progestagens, and industrial chemicals induce a concentration-dependent GFP expression in radial glial progenitors. As GFP expression can be quantified by in vivo imaging, this model presents a very powerful tool to screen and characterize compounds potentially acting as estrogen mimics either directly or after metabolization by the zebrafish embryo. This study also shows that radial glial cells that act as stem cells are direct targets for a large panel of endocrine disruptors, calling for more attention regarding the impact of environmental estrogens and/or certain pharmaceuticals on brain development. Altogether these data identify this in vivo bioassay as an interesting alternative to detect estrogen mimics in hazard and risk assessment perspective. PMID:22586461\n\nThe effect of excess expression of GFP in a novel heart-specific green fluorescence zebrafish regulated by nppa enhancer at early embryonic development.\n\nPubMed\n\nHuang, Wen; Deng, Yun; Dong, Wei; Yuan, Wuzhou; Wan, Yongqi; Mo, Xiaoyan; Li, Yongqing; Wang, Zequn; Wang, Yuequn; Ocorr, Karen; Zhang, Bo; Lin, Shuo; Wu, Xiushan\n\n2011-02-01\n\nIn order to study the impalpable effect of GFP in homozygous heart-specific GFP-positive zebrafish during the early stage, the researchers analyzed the heart function of morphology and physiology at the first 3 days after fertilization. This zebrafish line was produced by a large-scale Tol2 transposon mediated enhancer trap screen that generated a transgenic zebrafish with a heart-specific expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged under control of the nppa enhancer. In situ hybridization experiments showed that the nppa:GFP line faithfully recapitulated both the spatial and temporal expressions of the endogenous nppa. Green fluorescence was intensively and specifically expressed in the myocardial cells located both in the heart chambers and in the atrioventricular canal. The embryonic heart of nppa:GFP line developed normally compared with those in the wild type. There was no difference between the nappa:GFP and wild type lines with respect to heart rate, overall size, ejection volume, and fractional shortening. Thus the excess expression of GFP in this transgenic line seemed to exert no detrimental effects on zebrafish hearts during the early stages.\n\nLive imaging of collagen deposition during skin development and repair in a collagen I - GFP fusion transgenic zebrafish line.\n\nPubMed\n\nMorris, Josephine L; Cross, Stephen J; Lu, Yinhui; Kadler, Karl E; Lu, Yongbo; Dallas, Sarah L; Martin, Paul\n\n2018-06-06\n\nFibrillar collagen is a major component of many tissues but has been difficult to image in vivo using transgenic approaches because of problems associated with establishing cells and organisms that generate GFP-fusion collagens that can polymerise into functional fibrils. Here we have developed and characterised GFP and mCherry collagen-I fusion zebrafish lines with basal epidermal-specific expression. We use these lines to reveal the dynamic nature of collagen-I fibril deposition beneath the developing embryonic epidermis, as well as the repair of this collagen meshwork following wounding. Transmission electron microscope studies show that these transgenic lines faithfully reproduce the collagen ultrastructure present in wild type larval skin. During skin development we show that collagen I is deposited by basal epidermal cells initially in fine filaments that are largely randomly orientated but are subsequently aligned into a cross-hatch, orthogonal sub-epithelial network by embryonic day 4. Following skin wounding, we see that sub-epidermal collagen is re-established in the denuded domain, initially as randomly orientated wisps that subsequently become bonded to the undamaged collagen and aligned in a way that recapitulates developmental deposition of sub-epidermal collagen. Crossing our GFP-collagen line against one with tdTomato marking basal epidermal cell membranes reveals how much more rapidly wound re-epithelialisation occurs compared to the re-deposition of collagen beneath the healed epidermis. By use of other tissue specific drivers it will be possible to establish zebrafish lines to enable live imaging of collagen deposition and its remodelling in various other organs in health and disease.

Our previous studies have found that grouper tshÎ² (gtshÎ²) is also expressed in kidney, however, the distribution significance is still unknown. To understand the gtshÎ² role and kidney tubule morphogenesis, here, we have generated a transgenic zebrafish line Tg(gtshÎ²:GFP) with green fluorescent protein driven by the gtshÎ² promoter. Similar to the endogenous tshÎ² in zebrafish or in grouper, the gtshÎ² promoter-driven GFP is expressed in pituitary and kidney, and the developing details of proximal kidney tubule are marked in the transgenic zebrafish line. The gfp initially transcribes at 16 hours post fertilization (hpf) above the dorsal mesentery, and partially co-localizes with pronephric tubular markers slc20a1a and cdh17. Significantly, the GFP specifically localizes in proximal pronephric segments during embryogenesis and resides at kidney duct epithelium in adult fish. To test whether the gtshÎ² promoter-driven GFP may serve as a readout signal of the tubular development, we have treated the embryos with retinoic acid signaing (RA) reagents, in which exogenous RA addition results in a distal extension of the proximal segments, while RA inhibition induces a weakness and shortness of the proximal segments. Therefore, this transgenic line provides a useful tool for genetic or chemical analysis of kidney tubule.

Here, we have initiated an effort to study the mechanisms underlying tissue-specific expression of this gene. DNA constructs were prepared in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is driven by regulatory regions of the zfAANAT-2 gene. In vivo transient expression analysis in zebrafish embryos indicated that in addition to the 5'-flanking region, a regulatory sequence in the 3'-flanking region is required for pineal-specific expression. This finding led to an effort to produce transgenic lines expressing GFP under the control of the 5' and 3' regulatory regions of the zfAANAT-2 gene. Embryos transiently expressing GFP were raised to maturity and tested for germ cell transmission of the transgene. Three transgenic lines were produced in which GFP fluorescence in the pineal was detected starting 1 to 2 days after fertilization. One line was crossed with mindbomb and floating head mutants that cause abnormal development of the pineal and an elevation or reduction of zfAANAT-2 mRNA levels, respectively. Homozygous mutant transgenic embryos exhibited similar effects on GFP expression in the pineal gland. These observations indicate that the transgenic lines described here will be useful in studying the development of the pineal gland and the mechanisms that determine pineal-specific gene expression in the zebrafish.

Previous studies using a zebrafish transgenic reporter demonstrated that the EEDs bisphenol A and genistein preferentially activate estrogen receptors (ERs) in the larval heart compared with the liver. However, it was not known whether the transgenic zebrafish reporter was sensitive enough to detect estrogens from environmental samples, whether environmental estrogens would exhibit tissue-specific effects similar to those of BPA and genistein, or why some compounds preferentially target receptors in the heart. Methods: We tested surface water samples using a transgenic zebrafish reporter with tandem estrogen response elements driving green fluorescent protein expression (5xERE:GFP). Reporter activation was colocalized with tissue-specific expression of ER genes by RNA in situ hybridization. Results: We observed selective patterns of ER activation in transgenic fish exposed to river water samples from the Mid-Atlantic United States, with several samples preferentially activating receptors in embryonic and larval heart valves. We discovered that tissue specificity in ER activation was due to differences in the expression of ER subtypes. ERÎ± was expressed in developing heart valves but not in the liver, whereas ERÎ²2 had the opposite profile. Accordingly, subtype-specific ER agonists activated the reporter in either the heart valves or the liver. Conclusion: The use of 5xERE:GFP transgenic zebrafish revealed an unexpected tissue-specific difference in the response to environmentally relevant estrogenic compounds. Exposure to estrogenic EEDs in utero was associated with adverse health effects, with the potentially unanticipated consequence of targeting developing heart valves.

Genetic lineage analysis reveals that enteric ptf1a:GFP(+) cells are derived from the neural crest and that most ptf1a:GFP(+) neurons express the neurotransmitter 5HT, demonstrating that they are serotonergic. This transgenic line, Tg(ptf1a:GFP), provides a novel neuronal marker for a subpopulation of neurons within the enteric nervous system, and highlights the possibility that Ptf1a may act as an important transcription factor for enteric neuron development.

Transgenic mouse lines in which GFP expression is under the control of tissue-and stage specific promoters have provided powerful experimental tools for identification and isolation of cells at specific stages of differentiation along a lineage. Our previous studies showed utilization of pOBCol3.6GFP and pOBCol2.3GFP animals for identification of odontoblasts at early and late stages of polarization respectively. In the present study we used the DMP1-GFP transgenic animal as an experimental model to examine its expression during the differentiation of odontoblasts from progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. Our observations showed that DMP1-GFP transgene is first activated in secretory/functional odontoblasts engaged in secretion of predentin and then transiently expressed at high levels in newly differentiated odontoblasts. Expression of DMP1-GFP was down-regulated in highly differentiated odontoblasts. The temporal and spatial pattern of expression of DMP1-GFP transgene closely mimics the expression of endogenous DMP1. This transgenic animal will facilitate studies of gene expression and biological functions in secretory/functional odontoblasts.

However, this issue is still unclear in fish. This study aimed at evaluating the differential sensitivities to DLCs in fish larvae. Here, larvae of Tg(cyp1a:gfp) medaka and Tg(cyp1a:gfp) zebrafish were tested with 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin (TCDD), polychlorinated biphenyl 126 (PCB 126) and 2,3,4,7,8,-Pentachlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF). Comparative analyses were performed on induction of GFP fluorescence, expression of endogenous cyp1a mRNAs and EROD activity between the two species after exposure to these chemicals. We found that PCB 126 and PeCDF exposure at high concentrations induced strong GFP expression in multiple organs (liver, head kidney and gut) in both medaka and zebrafish larvae. Moreover, the expression of endogenous cyp1a mRNA was significantly elevated in the zebrafish larvae exposed to TCDD, PCB 126 and PeCDF at different concentrations. Likewise, almost all the exposure conditions could cause prominent elevation of EROD activity in the zebrafish larvae, while the EROD activities were just slightly elevated in the medaka larvae exposed to 1Â nM and 0.5Â nM of TCDD as well as to 1.5Â nM and 15Â nM of PeCDF, but not in the medaka larvae exposed to PCB 126. Taken together, zebrafish was proved to be more sensitive than medaka to PCB 126 and to PeCDF in this study. The findings suggested species-specific sensitivity to DLCs in fish and will facilitate choosing a sensitive and reliable fish model or tool to evaluate the risk of dioxins and DLCs exposure.

A screening-amenable alternative in vivo model such as zebrafish would, therefore, find immediate application in the early prediction of unacceptable organ toxicity. To identify highly upregulated genes as biomarkers of toxic responses in the zebrafish model, a set of well-characterized reference drugs that cause drug-induced liver injury (DILI) in the clinic were applied to zebrafish larvae and adults. Transcriptome microarray analysis was performed on whole larvae or dissected adult livers. Integration of data sets from different drug treatments at different stages identified common upregulated detoxification pathways. Within these were candidate biomarkers which recurred in multiple treatments. We prioritized 4 highly upregulated genes encoding enzymes acting in distinct phases of the drug metabolism pathway. Through promoter isolation and fosmid recombineering, eGFP reporter transgenic zebrafish lines were generated and evaluated for their response to DILI drugs. Three of the 4 generated reporter lines showed a dose and time-dependent induction in endodermal organs to reference drugs and an expanded drug set. In conclusion, through integrated transcriptomics and transgenic approaches, we have developed parallel independent zebrafish in vivo screening platforms able to predict organ toxicities of preclinical drugs.

Methods: The embryos of wild type and TG (flk1:GFP) transgenic zebrafish were exposed to DHA. Developmental phenotypes of the embryos were observed. Development of blood vessels was directly observed in living embryos of TG (flk1:GFP) transgenic zebrafish under fluorescence microscope. The expression of angiogenesis marker genes vegfa, flk1, and flt1 in the embryos was detected using real-time PCR and RNA in situ hybridization assays. Results: Exposure to DHA (1â10 mg/L) dose-dependently caused abnormal zebrafish embryonic phenotypes in the early developmental stage. Furthermore, exposure to DHA (10 mg/L) resulted in more pronounced embryonic angiogenesis in TG (flk1:GFP) zebrafish line. Exposure to DHA (10 mg/L) significantly increased the mRNA expression of vegfa, flk1, and flt1 in the embryos. Knockdown of the flk1 protein partially blocked the effects of DHA on embryogenesis. Conclusion: DHA causes abnormal embryonic phenotypes and promotes angiogenesis in zebrafish early embryonic development, demonstrating the potential embryotoxicity of DHA.

Mutations in human lamin A cause a spectrum of genetic diseases that affect cardiac muscle and skeletal muscle as well as other tissues. A few laminopathies have been modeled using the mouse. As zebrafish is a well established model for the study of cardiac development and disease, we have investigated the effects of heart-specific lamin A mutations in transgenic zebrafish. We have developed transgenic lines of zebrafish expressing conserved lamin A mutations that cause cardiac dysfunction in humans. Expression of zlamin A mutations Q291P and M368K in the heart was driven by the zebrafish cardiac troponin T2 promoter. Homozygous mutant embryos displayed nuclear abnormalities in cardiomyocyte nuclei. Expression analysis showed the upregulation of genes involved in heart regeneration in transgenic mutant embryos and a cell proliferation marker was increased in adult heart tissue. At the physiological level, there was deviation of up to 20% from normal heart rate in transgenic embryos expressing mutant lamins. Adult homozygous zebrafish were fertile and did not show signs of early mortality. Our results suggest that transgenic zebrafish models of heart-specific laminopathies show cardiac regeneration and moderate deviations in heart rate during embryonic development.

Leonardo; Mina, Mina\n\n2010-01-01\n\nTransgenic mouse lines in which GFP expression is under the control of tissue-and stage specific promoters have provided powerful experimental tools for identification and isolation of cells at specific stage of differentiation along a lineage. In the present study we used primary cell cultures derived from the dental pulp from pOBCol3.6GFP and pOBCol2.3GFP transgenic mice as a model to develop markers for early stages of odontoblast differentiation from progenitor cells. We analyzed the temporal and spatial expression of 2.3-GFP and 3.6-GFP during in vitro mineralization. Using FACS to separate cells based on GFP expression, we obtained relatively homogenous sub-populations of cells and analyzed their dentinogenic potentials and their progression into odontoblasts. Our observations showed that these transgenes were activated before the onset of matrix deposition and in cells at different stages of polarization. The 3.6-GFP transgene was activated in cells in early stages of polarization whereas the 2.3-GFP transgene was activated at a later stage of polarization just before or at the time of formation of secretory odontoblast.

In this study, we performed neural induction using ASCs from GFP transgenic mice and were able to induce these ASCs into neuronal and glial cell lineages. Most of the neurally induced cells showed bipolar or multipolar appearance morphologically and expressed neuronal markers. Electron microscopy revealed their neuronal morphology. Some cells also showed glial phenotypes, as shown immunocytochemically. The present study clearly shows that ASCs derived from GFP transgenic mice differentiate intomoreÂ Â» neural lineages in vitro, suggesting that these cells might provide an ideal source for further neural stem cell research with possible therapeutic application for neurological disorders.Â«Â less\n\nDifferential GFP expression patterns induced by different heavy metals in Tg(hsp70:gfp) transgenic medaka (Oryzias latipes).\n\nPubMed\n\nNg, Grace Hwee Boon; Xu, Hongyan; Pi, Na; Kelly, Barry C; Gong, Zhiyuan\n\n2015-06-01\n\nHeat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is one of the most widely used biomarker for monitoring environment perturbations in biological systems. To facilitate the analysis of hsp70 expression as a biomarker, we generated a Tg(hsp70:gfp) transgenic medaka line in which green fluorescence protein (GFP) reporter gene was driven by the medaka hsp70 promoter. Here, we characterized Tg(hsp70:gfp) medaka for inducible GFP expression by seven environment-relevant heavy metals, including mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, copper, chromium, and zinc. We found that four of them (mercury, arsenic, lead, and cadmium) induced GFP expression in multiple and different organs. In general, the liver, kidney, gut, and skin are among the most frequent organs to show induced GFP expression. In contrast, no detectable GFP induction was observed to copper, chromium, or zinc, indicating that the transgenic line was not responsive to all heavy metals. RT-qPCR determination of hsp70 mRNA showed similar induction and non-induction by these metals, which also correlated with the levels of metal uptake in medaka exposed to these metals. Our observations suggested that these heavy metals have different mechanisms of toxicity and/or differential bioaccumulation in various organs; different patterns of GFP expression induced by different metals may be used to determine or exclude metals in water samples tested. Furthermore, we also tested several non-metal toxicants such as bisphenol A, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, 4-introphenol, and lindane; none of them induced significant GFP expression in Tg(hsp70:gfp) medaka, further suggesting that the inducibility of Tg(hsp70:gfp) for GFP expression is specific to a subset of heavy metals.\n\nExpression Analysis of CB2-GFP BAC Transgenic Mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchmÃ¶le, Anne-Caroline; Lundt, Ramona; Gennequin, Benjamin; Schrage, Hanna; Beins, Eva; KrÃ¤mer, Alexandra; Zimmer, Till; Limmer, Andreas; Zimmer, Andreas; Otte, David-Marian\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a retrograde messenger system, consisting of lipid signaling molecules that bind to at least two G-protein-coupled receptors, Cannabinoid receptor 1 and 2 (CB1 and 2). As CB2 is primarily expressed on immune cells such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and microglia, it is of great interest how CB2 contributes to immune cell development and function in health and disease. Here, understanding the mechanisms of CB2 involvement in immune-cell function as well as the trafficking and regulation of CB2 expressing cells are crucial issues. Up to now, CB2 antibodies produce unclear results, especially those targeting the murine protein. Therefore, we have generated BAC transgenic GFP reporter mice (CB2-GFPTg) to trace CB2 expression in vitro and in situ. Those mice express GFP under the CB2 promoter and display GFP expression paralleling CB2 expression on the transcript level in spleen, thymus and brain tissue. Furthermore, by using fluorescence techniques we show that the major sources for GFP-CB2 expression are B cells in spleen and blood and microglia in the brain. This novel CB2-GFP transgenic reporter mouse line represents a powerful resource to study CB2 expression in different cell types. Furthermore, it could be used for analyzing CB2-mediated mobilization and trafficking of immune cells as well as studying the fate of recruited immune cells in models of acute and chronic inflammation.\n\nIn vivo imaging and quantitative analysis of changes in axon length using transgenic zebrafish embryos.\n\nPubMed\n\nKanungo, Jyotshnabala; Lantz, Susan; Paule, Merle G\n\n2011-01-01\n\nWe describe an imaging procedure to measure axon length in zebrafish embryos in vivo. Automated fluorescent image acquisition was performed with the ImageXpress Micro high content screening reader and further analysis of axon lengths was performed on archived images using AcuityXpress software. We utilized the Neurite Outgrowth Application module with a customized protocol (journal) to measure the axons. Since higher doses of ethanol (2-2.5%, v/v) have been shown to deform motor neurons and axons during development, here we used ethanol to treat transgenic [hb9:GFP (green fluorescent protein)] zebrafish embryos at 28 hpf (hours post-fertilization). These embryos express GFP in the motor neurons and their axons. Embryos after ethanol treatment were arrayed in 384-well plates for automated fluorescent image acquisition in vivo. Average axon lengths of high dose ethanol-treated embryos were significantly lower than the control. Another experiment showed that there was no significant difference in the axon lengths between the embryos grown for 24h at 22Â°C and 28.5Â°C. These test experiments demonstrate that using axon development as an end-point, compound screening can be performed in a time-efficient manner.

However, little is known about their population dynamics in plant tissues and bulk soil, especially in transgenic crops. This study investigated the colonization of transgenic maize harboring the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cry1Ah gene by Bacillus subtilis strain B916-gfp present in plant tissues and soil. Bt and nontransgenic maize were inoculated with B916-gfp by seed soaking, or root irrigation under both laboratory greenhouse and field conditions. During the growing season, B916-gfp colonized transgenic as well as nontransgenic plants by both inoculation methods. No differences were observed in B916-gfp population size between transgenic and nontransgenic plants, except at one or two time points in the roots and stems that did not persist over the examination period. Furthermore, planting transgenic maize did not affect the number of B916-gfp in bulk soil in either laboratory or field trials. These results indicate that transgenic modification of maize with the cry1Ah gene has no influence on colonization by the endophytic bacteria B916-gfp present in the plant and in bulk soil.

In this study, we provide the first evidence that Cre recombinase can mediate effective site-specific deletion of transgenes in zebrafish. We found that the efficiency of target site utilization could approach 100%, independent of whether the target site was provided transiently by injection or stably within an integrated transgene. Microinjection of Cre mRNA appeared to be slightly more effective for this purpose than microinjection of Cre-expressing plasmid DNA. Our work has not yet progressed to the point where SB-mediated mobilization of our transgene constructs would be observed. However, a recent report has demonstrated that SB can enhance transgenesis rates sixfold over conventional methods by efficiently mediating multiple single-copy insertion of transgenes into the zebrafish genome (Davidson et al., 2003). Therefore, it seems likely that a combined system should eventually allow both SB-mediated transgene mobilization and Cre-mediated transgene modification. Our goal is to validate methods for the precise reengineering of the zebrafish genome by using a combination of Cre-loxP and SB transposon systems. These methods can be used to delete, replace, or mobilize large pieces of DNA or to modify the genome only when and where required by the investigator. For example, it should be possible to deliver particular RNAi genes to well-expressed chromosomal loci and then exchange them easily with alternative RNAi genes for the specific suppression of alternative targets. As a nonviral vector for gene therapy, the transposon component allows for the possibility of highly efficient integration, whereas the Cre-loxP component can target the integration and/or exchange of foreign DNA into specific sites within the genome. The\n\nCell-autonomous-like silencing of GFP-partitioned transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana.\n\nPubMed\n\nSohn, Seong-Han; Frost, Jennifer; Kim, Yoon-Hee; Choi, Seung-Kook; Lee, Yi; Seo, Mi-Suk; Lim, Sun-Hyung; Choi, Yeonhee; Kim, Kook-Hyung; Lomonossoff, George\n\n2014-08-01\n\nWe previously reported the novel partitioning of regional GFP-silencing on leaves of 35S-GFP transgenic plants, coining the term \"partitioned silencing\". We set out to delineate the mechanism of partitioned silencing. Here, we report that the partitioned plants were hemizygous for the transgene, possessing two direct-repeat copies of 35S-GFP. The detection of both siRNA expression (21 and 24 nt) and DNA methylation enrichment specifically at silenced regions indicated that both post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) were involved in the silencing mechanism. Using in vivo agroinfiltration of 35S-GFP/GUS and inoculation of TMV-GFP RNA, we demonstrate that PTGS, not TGS, plays a dominant role in the partitioned silencing, concluding that the underlying mechanism of partitioned silencing is analogous to RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). The initial pattern of partitioned silencing was tightly maintained in a cell-autonomous manner, although partitioned-silenced regions possess a potential for systemic spread. Surprisingly, transcriptome profiling through next-generation sequencing demonstrated that expression levels of most genes involved in the silencing pathway were similar in both GFP-expressing and silenced regions although a diverse set of region-specific transcripts were detected.This suggests that partitioned silencing can be triggered and regulated by genes other than the genes involved in the silencing pathway.

Data are presented showing the correlation between genetically linked green fluorescent protein (GFP) with BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS (Bt) CRY1AC gene expression in hybrids formed between transgenic B. NAPUS \"Westar\" and a wild Chinese accession of wild mustard (B. JUNCEA) and hybridization between transgenic B. NAPUS and a conspecific Chinese landrace oilseed rape. Hybrids were obtained either by spontaneous hybridization in the field or by hand-crossing in a greenhouse. In all cases, transgenic hybrids were selected by GFP fluorescence among seedlings originating from seeds harvested from B. JUNCEA and the Chinese oilseed rape plants. Transgenicity was confirmed by PCR detection of transgenes. GFP fluorescence was easily and rapidly detected in the hybrids under greenhouse and field conditions. Results showed that both GFP fluorescence and Bt protein synthesis decreased as either plant or leaf aged, and GFP fluorescence intensity was closely correlated with Bt protein concentration during the entire vegetative lifetime in hybrids. These findings allow the use of GFP fluorescence as an accurate tool to detect gene-flow in time in the field and to conveniently estimate BT CRY1AC expression in hybrids on-the-plant.\n\nZebrafish: an exciting model for investigating the spatio-temporal pattern of enteric nervous system development.\n\nPubMed\n\nDoodnath, Reshma; Dervan, Adrian; Wride, Michael A; Puri, Prem\n\n2010-12-01\n\nRecently, the zebrafish (Danio rerio) has been shown to be an excellent model for human paediatric research. Advantages over other models include its small size, externally visually accessible development and ease of experimental manipulation. The enteric nervous system (ENS) consists of neurons and enteric glia. Glial cells permit cell bodies and processes of neurons to be arranged and maintained in a proper spatial arrangement, and are essential in the maintenance of basic physiological functions of neurons. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed in astrocytes, but also expressed outside of the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatio-temporal pattern of GFAP expression in developing zebrafish ENS from 24 h post-fertilization (hpf), using transgenic fish that express green fluorescent protein (GFP). Zebrafish embryos were collected from transgenic GFP Tg(GFAP:GFP)(mi2001) adult zebrafish from 24 to 120 hpf, fixed and processed for whole mount immunohistochemistry. Antibodies to Phox2b were used to identify enteric neurons. Specimens were mounted on slides and imaging was performed using a fluorescent laser confocal microscope. GFAP:GFP labelling outside the spinal cord was identified in embryos from 48 hpf. The patterning was intracellular and consisted of elongated profiles that appeared to migrate away from the spinal cord into the periphery. At 72 and 96 hpf, GFAP:GFP was expressed dorsally and ventrally to the intestinal tract. At 120 hpf, GFAP:GFP was expressed throughout the intestinal wall, and clusters of enteric neurons were identified using Phox2b immunofluorescence along the pathway of GFAP:GFP positive processes, indicative of a migratory pathway of ENS precursors from the spinal cord into the intestine. The pattern of migration of GFAP:GFP expressing cells outside the spinal cord suggests an organized, early developing migratory pathway to the ENS. This shows for the first time that Tg(GFAP:GFP)(mi2001\n\nLive-cell imaging of Salmonella Typhimurium interaction with zebrafish larvae after injection and immersion delivery methods.\n\nPubMed\n\nVaras, Macarena; FariÃ±a, Alonso; DÃ­az-Pascual, Francisco; OrtÃ­z-SeverÃ­n, Javiera; Marcoleta, AndrÃ©s E; Allende, Miguel L; Santiviago, Carlos A; ChÃ¡vez, Francisco P\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe zebrafish model has been used to determine the role of vertebrate innate immunity during bacterial infections.

In this study, we demonstrated the potential of huORFZ, a novel transgenic zebrafish line that harbors a human upstream open reading frame of the chop gene fused with GFP reporter, as an animal model for monitoring environmental pollutants and stress-related cellular processes. When huORFZ embryos were kept under normal condition, no leaked GFP signal could be detected. When treated with hazardous chemicals, including heavy metals and endocrine-disrupting chemicals near their sublethal concentrations (LC50), huORFZ embryos exhibited different tissue-specific GFP expression patterns. For further analysis, copper (Cu2+), cadmium (Cd2+) and Chlorpyrifos were applied. Cu2+ triggered GFP responses in skin and muscle, whereas Cd2+ treatment triggered GFP responses in skin, olfactory epithelium and pronephric ducts. Moreover, fluorescence intensity, as exhibited by huORFZ embryos, was dose-dependent. After surviving treated embryos were returned to normal condition, survival rates, as well as TUNEL signals, returned to pretreatment levels with no significant morphological defects observed. Such results indicated the reversibility of treatment conditions used in this study, as long as embryos survived such conditions. Notably, GFP signals decreased along with recovery, suggesting that GFP signaling of huORFZ embryos likely reflected the overall physiological condition of the individual. To examine the performance of the huORFZ line under real-world conditions, we placed huORFZ embryos in different river water samples. We found that the huORFZ embryos correctly detected the presence of various kinds of pollutants. Based on these findings, we concluded that such uORFchop-based system can be integrated into a first-line water alarm system monitoring the discharge of hazardous pollutants.

A primary target of these metals is known to be the olfactory system, and fish exposed to a number of different waterborne metals display deficiencies in olfaction. Importantly, exposure over embryonic/larval development periods can cause deficits in chemosensory function in juvenile fish, but the specific cell types affected are unknown. We have previously characterized a transgenic zebrafish strain expressing the green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene linked to the hsp70 gene promoter, and shown it to be a useful tool for examining cell-specific toxicity in living embryos and larvae. Here we show that the hsp70/eGFP transgene is strongly and specifically upregulated within the olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) of transgenic zebrafish larvae following a brief 3-h exposure to water-borne cadmium. This molecular response was closely correlated to an endpoint for tissue damage within the olfactory placode, namely cell death. Furthermore, cadmium-induced olfactory cytotoxicity in zebrafish larvae gives rise to more permanent effects. Juvenile zebrafish briefly exposed to cadmium during early larval development display deficits in olfactory-dependent predator avoidance behaviors 4-6 weeks after a return to clean water. Lateral line neuromasts of exposed zebrafish larvae also activate both the endogenous hsp70 gene and the hsp70/eGFP transgene. The data reveal that even a very brief exposure period that gives rise to cell death within the developing olfactory placode results in long-term deficits in olfaction, and that hsp70/eGFP may serve as an effective indicator of sublethal cadmium exposure in sensory cells.\n\nBrief embryonic cadmium exposure induces a stress response and cell death in the developing olfactory system followed by long-term olfactory deficits in juvenile zebrafish\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nBlechinger, Scott R.; Toxicology Group, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan; Kusch, Robin C.\n\n2007-10-01\n\nThe toxic effects of cadmium and other metals have been well established.

Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated locus-specific integration of a reporter, which contains the Mbait sequence targeted using Mbait-gRNA, the hsp70 promoter and the eGFP gene, has allowed the visualization of the target gene expression. However, it has not been ascertained whether the reporter integrations at both targeted alleles cause loss-of-function phenotypes in zebrafish. In this study, we have inserted the Mbait-hs-eGFP reporter into the pax2a gene because the disruption of pax2a causes the loss of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary (MHB) in zebrafish. In the heterozygous Tg[pax2a-hs:eGFP] embryos, MHB formed normally and the eGFP expression recapitulated the endogenous pax2a expression, including the MHB. We observed the loss of the MHB in homozygous Tg[pax2a-hs:eGFP] embryos. Furthermore, we succeeded in integrating the Mbait-hs-eGFP reporter into an uncharacterized gene epdr1. The eGFP expression in heterozygous Tg[epdr1-hs:eGFP] embryos overlapped the epdr1 expression, whereas the distribution of eGFP-positive cells was disorganized in the MHB of homozygous Tg[epdr1-hs:eGFP] embryos. We propose that the locus-specific integration of the Mbait-hs-eGFP reporter is a powerful method to investigate both gene expression profiles and loss-of-function phenotypes.\n\nFunctional visualization and disruption of targeted genes using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated eGFP reporter integration in zebrafish\n\nPubMed Central\n\nOta, Satoshi; Taimatsu, Kiyohito; Yanagi, Kanoko; Namiki, Tomohiro; Ohga, Rie; Higashijima, Shin-ichi; Kawahara, Atsuo\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe CRISPR/Cas9 complex, which is composed of a guide RNA (gRNA) and the Cas9 nuclease, is useful for carrying out genome modifications in various organisms. Recently, the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated locus-specific integration of a reporter, which contains the Mbait sequence targeted using Mbait-gRNA, the hsp70 promoter and the eGFP gene, has allowed the visualization of the target gene expression. However, it has not been ascertained whether the reporter integrations at both targeted alleles cause loss-of-function phenotypes in zebrafish.

To address these problems, investigators developed transgenic mice that express enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) directed by the promoter for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the acetylcholine synthetic enzyme. Although, it was reported that these mice express GFP in all cholinergic neurons and non-neuronal cholinergic cells, we could not detect GFP in cardiac cholinergic nerves in preliminary experiments. Our goals for this study were to confirm our initial observation and perform a qualitative screen of other representative autonomic structures for the presences of GFP in cholinergic innervation of effector tissues. We evaluated GFP fluorescence of intact, unfixed tissues and the cellular localization of GFP and vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT), a specific cholinergic marker, in tissue sections and intestinal whole mounts. Our experiments identified two major tissues where cholinergic neurons and/or nerve fibers lacked GFP: 1) most cholinergic neurons of the intrinsic cardiac ganglia and all cholinergic nerve fibers in the heart and 2) most cholinergic nerve fibers innervating airway smooth muscle. Most cholinergic neurons in airway ganglia stained for GFP. Cholinergic systems in the bladder and intestines were fully delineated by GFP staining. GFP labeling of input to ganglia with long preganglionic projections (vagal) was sparse or weak, while that to ganglia with short preganglionic projections (spinal) was strong. Total absence of GFP might be due to splicing out of the GFP gene. Lack of GFP in nerve projections from GFP-positive cell bodies might reflect a transport deficiency. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Inv mutant mice show consistently reversed internal organs (situs inversus), multiple renal cysts and neonatal lethality. The Inv::GFP-rescue mice, which introduced the Inv::GFP fusion gene, can rescue inv mutant mice phenotypes. This indicates that the Inv::GFP gene is functional in vivo. To analyze the physiological functions of the Inv gene, and to demonstrate the availability of transgenic RNAi mice, we introduced a short hairpin RNA expression vector against GFP mRNA into Inv::GFP-rescue mice and analyzed the gene silencing effects and Inv functions by examining phenotypes. Transgenic RNAi mice with the Inv::GFP-rescue gene (Inv-KD mice) down-regulated Inv::GFP fusion protein and showed hypomorphic phenotypes of inv mutant mice, such as renal cyst development, but not situs abnormalities or postnatal lethality. This indicates that shRNAi-mediated gene silencing systems that target the tag sequence of the fusion gene work properly in vivo, and suggests that a relatively high level of Inv protein is required for kidney development in contrast to left/right axis determination. Inv::GFP protein was significantly down-regulated in the germ cells of Inv-KD mice testis compared with somatic cells, suggesting the existence of a testicular germ cell-specific enhanced RNAi system that regulates germ cell development. The Inv-KD mouse is useful for studying Inv gene functions in adult tissue that are unable to be analyzed in inv mutant mice showing postnatal lethality. In addition, the shRNA-based gene silencing system against the tag sequence of the fusion gene can be utilized as a new technique to regulate gene expression in either in vitro or in vivo experiments.

To study monocyte trafficking and macrophage differentiation in vivo, we have generated a novel transgenic reporter mouse expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the human CD68 promoter. CD68-GFP mice express high levels of GFP in both monocyte and embryo-derived tissue resident macrophages in adult animals. The human CD68 promoter drives GFP expression in all CD115+ monocytes of adult blood, spleen, and bone marrow; we took advantage of this to directly compare the trafficking of bone marrowâderived CD68-GFP monocytes to that of CX3CR1GFP monocytes in vivo using a sterile zymosan peritonitis model. Unlike CX3CR1GFP monocytes, which downregulate GFP expression on differentiation into macrophages in this model, CD68-GFP monocytes retain high-level GFP expression for 72 hours after differentiation into macrophages, allowing continued cell tracking during resolution of inflammation. In summary, this novel CD68-GFP transgenic reporter mouse line represents a powerful resource for analyzing monocyte mobilization and monocyte trafficking as well as studying the fate of recruited monocytes in models of acute and chronic inflammation.

This chapter will describe the procedures required to successfully conduct live imaging of zebrafish transgenics that has specifically been adapted for skeletal muscle.\n\nIn vitro antagonistic activity and the protective effect of probiotic Bacillus licheniformis Dahb1 in zebrafish challenged with GFP tagged Vibrio parahaemolyticus Dahv2.\n\nPubMed\n\nGirija, Vairavan; Malaikozhundan, Balasubramanian; Vaseeharan, Baskaralingam; Vijayakumar, Sekar; Gobi, Narayanan; Del Valle Herrera, Marian; Chen, Jiann-Chu; Santhanam, Perumal\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn vitro antagonistic activity and the protective effect of probiotic Bacillus licheniformis Dahb1 in zebrafish (Danio rerio) challenged with GFP tagged Vibrio parahaemolyticus Dahv2 was studied. The cell free extract of probiotic B. licheniformis Dahb1 at 100Â Î¼gÂ mL -1 showed growth inhibition of V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 in vitro. B. licheniformis Dahb1 also inhibited the biofilm growth of GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 at 100Â Î¼gÂ mL -1 in vitro. The growth and survival of zebrafish was tested using probiotic B. licheniformis Dahb1. Weight (1.28Â g) of zebrafish that received the cell free extract was much higher than in control (1.04Â g). The mortality of zebrafish infected with GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 at 10 7 Cfu mL -1 (Group IV) was 100%, whereas a complete survival of zebrafish that received the cell free extract of B. licheniformis Dahb1 at 10 7 Cfu mL -1 (Group VII) was observed after 30 days. The number of GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 colonies in the intestine and gills significantly reduced after treatment with the cell free extract of B. licheniformis Dahb1. Furthermore, a significant decrease in the fluorescent colonies of GFP tagged V. parahaemolyticus Dahv2 was observed after treatment with the cell free extract of B. licheniformis Dahb1 under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In conclusion, the cell free extract of B. licheniformis Dahb1 could prevent Vibrio infection by enhancing the growth and survival of zebrafish. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In our current study, we identified and characterized the promoter region of zebrafish gsuÎ± and generated a stable gsuÎ±:EGFP transgenic line, which recapitulated the endogenous gsuÎ± expression in the early developing pituitary gland. A relatively conserved regulatory element set is presented in the promoter regions of zebrafish and three other known mammalian gsuÎ± promoters. Our results also demonstrated that the expression patterns of the gsuÎ±:EGFP transgene were allmoreÂ Â» identical to those expression patterns of the endogenous gsuÎ± expression in the pituitary tissue when our transgenic fish were treated with various endocrine chemicals, including forskolin (FSK), SP600125, trichostatin A (TSA), KClO{sub 4}, dexamethasone (Dex), Î²-estradiol and progesterone. Thus, this gsuÎ±:EGFP transgenic fish reporter line provides another valuable tool for investigating the lineage development of gsuÎ±-expressing gonadotrophins and the coordinated regulation of various glycoprotein hormone subunit genes. These reporter fish can serve as a novel platform to perform screenings of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) in vivo as well. - Highlights: â¢ Identification of the promoter of zebrafish glycoprotein subunit Î± (gsuÎ±) gene â¢ Generation of stable transmission gsuÎ±:EGFP transgenic zebrafish reporter â¢ Demonstration of the recapitulation of the gsuÎ±:EGFP and endogenous gsuÎ± expression â¢ Suggestion of the gsuÎ±:EGFP transgenic zebrafish as a novel platform for EDC study.Â«Â less\n\nUse of TSHÎ²:EGFP transgenic zebrafish as a rapid in vivo model for assessing thyroid-disrupting chemicals\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nJi, Cheng; Graduate University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing; Jin, Xia\n\nAccumulating evidence indicates that a wide range of chemicals have the ability to interfere with the hypothalamicâpituitaryâthyroid (HPT) axis. Novel endpoints should be evaluated in addition to existing methods in order to effectively assess the effects of these chemicals on the HPT axis. Thyroid-stimulating hormone subunit Î² (TSHÎ²) plays central regulatory roles in the HPT system. We identified the regulatory region that determines the expression level of zebrafish TSHÎ² in the anterior pituitary. In the transgenic zebrafish with EGFP driven by the TSHÎ² promoter, the similar responsive patterns between the expression levels of TSHÎ²:EGFP and endogenous TSHÎ² mRNA in themoreÂ Â» pituitary are observed following treatments with goitrogen chemicals and exogenous thyroid hormones (THs). These results suggest that the TSHÎ²:EGFP transgenic reporter zebrafish may be a useful alternative in vivo model for the assessment of chemicals interfering with the HPT system. Highlights: âº The promoter of zebrafish TSHÎ² gene has been identified. âº The stable TSHÎ²:EGFP transgenic zebrafish reporter germline has been generated. âº The EGFP in the transgenic fish recapitulated the pattern of pituitary TSHÎ² mRNA. âº The transgenic zebrafish may be an in vivo model for EDC assessment.Â«Â less\n\nInhibiting effects of rhynchophylline on zebrafish methamphetamine dependence are associated with amelioration of neurotransmitters content and down-regulation of TH and NR2B expression.\n\nPubMed\n\nJiang, Mingjin; Chen, Yifei; Li, Chan; Peng, Qiuxian; Fang, Miao; Liu, Wei; Kang, Qunzhao; Lin, Yingbo; Yung, Ken Kin Lam; Mo, Zhixian\n\n2016-07-04\n\nOthers and we have reported that rhynchophylline reverses amphetamine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) effect which may be partly mediated by amelioration of central neurotransmitters and N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 2B (NR2B) levels in the rat brains. The current study investigated the inhibiting effects of rhynchophylline on methamphetamine-induced (METH-induced) CPP in adult zebrafish and METH-induced locomotor activity in tyrosine hydroxylase-green fluorescent protein (TH-GFP) transgenic zebrafish larvae and attempted to confirm the hypothesis that these effects were mediated via regulation of neurotransmitters and dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. After baseline preference test (on days 1-3), zebrafish were injected intraperitoneally METH (on days 4, 6 and 8) or the same volume of fish physiological saline (on days 5 and 7) and were immediately conditioned. Rhynchophylline was administered at 12h after injection of METH. On day 9, zebrafish were tested for METH-induced CPP. Results revealed that rhynchophylline (100mg/kg) significantly inhibited the acquisition of METH-induced CPP, reduced the content of dopamine and glutamate and down-regulated the expression of TH and NR2B in the CPP zebrafish brains. Furthermore, the influence of rhynchophylline on METH-induced locomotor activity was also observed in TH-GFP transgenic zebrafish larvae. Results showed that rhynchophylline (50mg/L) treatment led to a significant reduction on the locomotor activity and TH expression in TH-GFP transgenic zebrafish larvae. Taken together, these data indicate that the inhibition of the formation of METH dependence by rhynchophylline in zebrafish is associated with amelioration of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate content and down-regulation of TH and NR2B expression.

However, the time required to clone and characterize any protein of interest is a significant bottleneck, especially for electron microscopy (EM). We present a modular system for enzyme-based protein tagging that allows for improved speed and sampling for analysis of subcellular protein distributions using existing clone libraries to EM-resolution. We demonstrate that we can target a modified soybean ascorbate peroxidase (APEX) to any GFP-tagged protein of interest by engineering a GFP-binding peptide (GBP) directly to the APEX-tag. We demonstrate that APEX-GBP (1) significantly reduces the time required to characterize subcellular protein distributions of whole libraries to less than 3 days, (2) provides remarkable high-resolution localization of proteins to organelle subdomains, and (3) allows EM localization of GFP-tagged proteins, including proteins expressed at endogenous levels, in vivo by crossing existing GFP-tagged transgenic zebrafish lines with APEX-GBP transgenic lines.

To achieve this, GFP was expressed constitutively in podocytes of PGFP transgenic mice which were bred to OVE mice to produce diabetic OVE-GFP mice. Viewing GFP fluorescence, foot processes of OVE-GFP podocytes were visually and measurably effaced, which did not occur with less severe STZ diabetes. Over 300,000 podocytes were purified from each PGFP mouse but only 49,000 podocytes per diabetic OVE-GFP mouse. The low yield from OVE-GFP mice appeared to be due to more fragile state of most OVE-GFP diabetic podocytes which did not survive the isolation process. Diabetic podocytes that were isolated had high levels of the lipid peroxidation product 4-HNE and they were more sensitive to death due to oxidative stress. Gene array analysis of OVE-GFP podocytes showed strong diabetes induction of genes involved in inflammation. Four CXC chemokines were induced at least 3-fold and the chemokine CXCL1 was shown for the first time to be specifically induced in podocytes by OVE, dbdb and STZ diabetes.\n\nImproved and high throughput quantitative measurements of weak GFP expression in transgenic plant materials.\n\nPubMed\n\nWu, Jing-Jing; Liu, Yu-Wen; Sun, Meng-Xiang\n\n2011-07-01\n\nGreen fluorescent proteins (GFPs) are widely used in tracing transgene expression and have been known as convenient and efficient markers for plant transformation. However, sometimes researchers are still puzzled by the weak fluorescence since it makes the observation of GFP signals and confirmation of transgenic plants difficult. In this investigation, we explored the possibility of enhancing the weak signals by changing the pH environment of detection and took microplate reader as a more effective instrument compared to traditional fluorescent microscope to detect the weak signals. It was found that the fluorescence intensity of enhanced GFP (EGFP) in transgenic plants can be increased 2-6 folds by altering the environmental pH, and the concentration of EGFP at a large scale (ranged from 20Â ng/ml to 20Â Î¼g/ml) can be detected and quantified. It can exclude the influence of degradation fragment and hence facilitate later analysis; these advantages were further verified by comparing with western blotting and confocal microscopy. It was reliable and effective for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of transgenic plants and was more suitable for the detection of very weak fluorescent signals.\n\nLabelling and targeted ablation of specific bipolar cell types in the zebrafish retina\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2009-01-01\n\nBackground Development of a functional retina depends on regulated differentiation of several types of neurons and generation of a highly complex network between the different types of neurons. In addition, each type of retinal neuron includes several distinct morphological types. Very little is known about the mechanisms responsible for generating this diversity of retinal neurons, which may also display specific patterns of regional distribution. Results In a screen in zebrafish, using a trapping vector carrying an engineered yeast Gal4 transcription activator and a UAS:eGFP reporter cassette, we have identified two transgenic lines of zebrafish co-expressing eGFP and Gal4 in specific subsets of retinal bipolar cells. The eGFP-labelling facilitated analysis of axon terminals within the inner plexiform layer of the adult retina and showed that the fluorescent bipolar cells correspond to previously defined morphological types. Strong regional restriction of eGFP-positive bipolar cells to the central part of the retina surrounding the optic nerve was observed in adult zebrafish. Furthermore, we achieved specific ablation of the labelled bipolar cells in 5 days old larvae, using a bacterial nitroreductase gene under Gal4-UAS control in combination with the prodrug metronidazole. Following prodrug treatment, nitroreductase expressing bipolar cells were efficiently ablated without affecting surrounding retina architecture, and recovery occurred within a few days due to increased generation of new bipolar cells. Conclusion This report shows that enhancer trapping can be applied to label distinct morphological types of bipolar cells in the zebrafish retina. The genetic labelling of these cells yielded co-expression of a modified Gal4 transcription activator and the fluorescent marker eGFP. Our work also demonstrates the potential utility of the Gal4-UAS system for induction of other transgenes, including a bacterial nitroreductase fusion gene, which can facilitate\n\nTransgenic expression of omega-3 PUFA synthesis genes improves zebrafish survival during Vibrio vulnificus infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nCheng, Chih-Lun; Huang, Shin-Jie; Wu, Chih-Lu; Gong, Hong-Yi; Ken, Chuian-Fu; Hu, Shao-Yang; Wu, Jen-Leih\n\n2015-11-17\n\nHighly desaturated n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are synthesized by desaturases and elongase. They exert hepatoprotective effects to prevent alcoholic fatty liver syndrome or cholestatic liver injury. However, it is unclear how n-3 PUFAs improve immune function in liver. Vibrio vulnificus, a gram-negative bacterial pathogen, causes high mortality of aquaculture fishes upon infection. Humans can become infected with V. vulnificus through open wounds or by eating raw seafood, and such infections may result in systemic septicemia. Moreover, patients with liver diseases are vulnerable to infection, and are more likely than healthy persons to present with liver inflammation following infection. This study quantified n-3 PUFAs and their anti-bacterial effects in Fadsd6 and Elvol5a transgenic zebrafish. Two transgenic zebrafish strains with strong liver specific expression of Fadsd6 and Elvol5a (driven by the zebrafish Fabp10 promoter) were established using the Tol2 system. Synthesis of n-3 PUFAs in these strains were increased by 2.5-fold as compared to wild type (Wt) fish. The survival rate in 24 h following challenge with V. vulnificus was 20 % in Wt, but 70 % in the transgenic strains. In addition, the bacteria counts in transgenic fish strains were significantly decreased. The expression levels of pro-inflammatory genes, such as TNF-Î±, IL-1Î², and NF-ÎºB, were suppressed between 9 and 12 h after challenge. This study confirms the anti-bacterial function of n-3 PUFAs in a transgenic zebrafish model. Fadsd6 and Elvol5a transgenic zebrafish are more resistant to V. vulnificus infection, and enhance survival by diminishing the attendant inflammatory response.\n\nHuman FGF1 promoter is active in ependymal cells and dopaminergic neurons in the brains of F1B-GFP transgenic mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Mei-Shu; Lin, Hua-Kuo; Chiu, Hsun; Lee, Don-Ching; Chung, Yu-Fen; Chiu, Ing-Ming\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFGF1 is involved in multiple biological functions and exhibits the importance in neuroprotective effects. Our previous studies indicated that, in human brain and retina, the FGF1B promoter controlled the expression of FGF1. However, the exact function and regulation of FGF1 in brain is still unclear. Here, we generated F1B-GFP transgenic mice that expressed the GFP reporter gene under the control of human FGF1B promoter (-540 to +31). Using the fresh brain sections of F1B-GFP transgenic mice, we found that the F1B-GFP cells expressed strong fluorescent signals in the ventricular system throughout the brain. The results of immunohistochemistry further showed that two distinct populations of F1B-GFP(+) cells existed in the brains of F1B-GFP transgenic mice. We demonstrated that one population of F1B-GFP(+) cells was ependymal cells, which distributed along the entire ventricles, and the second population of F1B-GFP(+) cells was neuronal cells that projected their long processes into multiple directions in specific areas of the brain. The double labeling of F1B-GFP(+) cells and tyrosine hydroxylase indicated that a subpopulation of F1B-GFP(+) -neuronal cells was dopaminergic neurons. Importantly, these F1B-GFP(+) /TH(+) cells were distributed in the main dopaminergic neuronal groups including hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and raphe nuclei. These results suggested that human FGF1B promoter was active in ependymal cells, neurons, and a portion of dopaminergic neurons. Thus, the F1B-GFP transgenic mice provide an animal model not only for studying FGF1 gene expression in vivo but also for understanding the role of FGF1 contribution in neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.

The development of fluorescent proteins as molecular tags has allowed investigators to track cell migration and engraftment levels after transplantation. Here we describe the development of two transgenic pig models via SCNT expressing a fusion protein composed of eGFP and porcine Histone 2B (pH2B). This fusion protein is targeted to the nucleosomes resulting a nuclear/chromatin eGFP signal. The first model (I) was generated via random insertion of pH2B-eGFP driven by the CAG promoter (chicken beta actin promoter and rabbit Globin poly A; pCAG-pH2B-eGFP) and protected by human interferon-Î² matrix attachment regions (MARs). Despite the consistent, high, and ubiquitous expression of the fusion protein pH2B-eGFP in all tissues analyzed, two independently generated Model I transgenic lines developed neurodegenerative symptoms including Wallerian degeneration between 3â5 months of age, requiring euthanasia. A second transgenic model (II) was developed via CRISPR-Cas9 mediated homology-directed repair (HDR) of IRES-pH2B-eGFP into the endogenous Î²-actin (ACTB) locus. Model II transgenic animals showed ubiquitous expression of pH2B-eGFP on all tissues analyzed. Unlike the pCAG-pH2B-eGFP/MAR line, all Model II animals were healthy and multiple pregnancies have been established with progeny showing the expected Mendelian ratio for the transmission of the pH2B-eGFP. Expression of pH2B-eGFP was used to examine the timing of the maternal to zygotic transition after IVF, and to examine chromosome segregation of SCNT embryos. To our knowledge this is the first viable transgenic pig model with chromatin-associated eGFP allowing both cell tracking and the study of chromatin dynamics in a large animal model.
