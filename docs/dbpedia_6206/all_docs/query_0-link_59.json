        "text": "Biking\n\nSeveral off-road trails make it easy to get around the park and to connect to trails in the area.\n\nDeer Run Bike Trail 3.7 km (50 minutes) easy\n\nThis trail provides cyclists with a safe way to travel through the interior of the park.\n\nOld Shore Road Trail 6 km easy (linear)\n\nThis trail follows the Lake Huron shoreline and offers excellent views of the shore and beach areas. In pioneer days it was part of the route that provided land transportation between Goderich and Southampton. This trail was formerly a roadway and has a firm base for cycling. It serves as an excellent link to various areas in the park.\n\nTower Trail 3.5 km return\n\nThe Tower Trail takes you around a wetland providing great opportunities for waterfowl and wildlife viewing. A tower provides a panoramic view of the wetland and a bird hide offers excellent viewing opportunities at water level. The trail surface is compacted gravel and boardwalk. Cyclists are asked to walk their bikes on the boardwalk sections.\n\nKempfs Trail 0.8 km (20 min) easy (linear)\n\nKempfs Trail offers a connecting route between the main park road and the Old Shore Road Trail. It is named after one of the former landowners in this part of the park.\n\nCycling along trails is recommended over cycling on park roads which can get very busy.\n\nBirding\n\nMore than 200 species of birds have been sighted here, including the Black-crowned Night Heron and the Great Egret which find the wetlands in the park to be ideal feeding grounds. The shoreline is a recognized spring and fall migration route. MacGregor Point is either the northern or southern nesting limit for a number of northern and southern species.\n\nEach spring, naturalists’ celebrate the return of songbirds during the Huron Fringe Birding Festival. This festival has been developed to coincide with the arrival and the setting up of territories by these migrating birds. The focus is on birding, however, other areas of natural history are included, such as butterflies, wildflowers, astronomy, nature art, poetry and photography. The festival is held annually for ten days from the Friday following the Victoria Day weekend.\n\nAnd in winter, don’t forget to make time to wander near the Visitor Centre which is an excellent spot to see and hand-feed chickadees and nuthatches.\n\nCamping - Winter (including Roofed)\n\nIf you haven’t explored a snow-covered MacGregor Point Provincial Park, you don’t know what you’re missing. Good roads and a scenic drive get you to the park, nestled against the shores of Lake Huron in Port Elgin.\n\nThe ice-skating trail is the premier winter attraction (and best-kept secret!), but MacGregor Point also offers skiing, snowshoeing, camping and other winter fun.\n\nCross-country Skiing\n\nThe Deer Run Trail (11 km) suits both novice and experienced cross-country skiers. This track-set trail combination gently winds through upland hardwood forest and wetland areas.\n\nAdditionally, there are several kilometres of unplowed park roads that are not groomed but would be suitable for cross-country skiing.\n\nSnowshoeing\n\nSnowshoe trails are located in Nipissing Campground, as well as on all unplowed roads and non-track set trails. Snowshoeing through the (typically) giant snow drifts along Old Shore Road Trail is worthy of a bucket list. (Note: for safety reasons please stay off ice, ice formations and snow drifts on Lake Huron and all ponds within the park.)\n\nSkating\n\nGlide through the woods on MacGregor’s ice-skating trail. The 400-metre skating trail provides an unforgettable outdoor experience. The park turns on the trail lights for skating under the stars until 10:00 pm every day of the week, and that’s when things get truly magical.\n\nThere is also a large ice pad for outdoor hockey enthusiasts.\n\nSnowmobiling\n\nSnowmobiling is permitted on park roads only.\n\nCanoeing\n\nCaution should be used by anyone canoeing or kayaking along the shore of Lake Huron because water conditions can change quickly. The nearby Saugeen River provides excellent canoeing and kayaking opportunities.\n\nDiscovery Program\n\nFacilities include: a Campfire Circle, hiking trails and a Visitor Centre. Various resource related evening programs happen up to six days a week during July and August, including children’s programs, curriculum based programs for schools, guided hikes, Huron Fringe Birding Festival, Nature Study Series and campfire programs. The park also offers Project Nature Watch (an independent learning program for children).\n\nFishing\n\nFishing along the shore is limited. The nearby Saugeen River is good for bass, perch, Lake Trout, pickerel, pike and salmon.\n\nHiking\n\nHuron Fringe Trail 1.2 km (35 minutes) easy\n\nThe Huron Fringe trail circles the Visitor Centre. Its boardwalk surface makes it compatible for the physically challenged. Interpretive signs along the way teach about the various habitats you are visiting. Several resting spots provide viewing areas for turtles and shore birds. Bicycles are not allowed on this trail.\n\nOld Shore Road Trail 6 km (4 hours) easy\n\nThis trail follows the Lake Huron shoreline. In pioneer days it was part of the route that provided land transportation between Goderich and Southampton. This trail offers excellent views of the shore and beach areas. Viewing platforms are located in several places. This trail can also be used for cycling and cross-country skiing. Wheelchairs find most of this trail easy to use.\n\nLake Ridge Trail 4 km (2.5 hours) moderate\n\nThis trail offers a longer circle route in the interior of the park. The terrain here is rough and is suitable only for hikers wearing sturdy shoes. The trail is named after the shoreline ridge of glacial Lake Nipissing which existed here some 5,500 years ago. A short side trail takes you to a boardwalk overlooking a former beaver pond and abandoned lodge. Storyboards tell about an old corduroy logging road, early settlement, and the forest. Bicycles are not permitted on this trail.\n\nTower Trail 3.5 km return (1.5 hours) easy\n\nThis trail takes the visitor around a wetland providing great opportunities for waterfowl and wildlife viewing. An observation tower offers a panoramic view of the wetland and a bird hide offers excellent viewing opportunities at water level. Storyboards are located along the trail to help you understand the wetland environment. Cyclists also use this trail. Wheelchairs can use the section of this trail between the parking lot and the observation tower.\n\nKempfs Trail 0.8 km (20 min) easy\n\nKempfs Trail offers a connecting route between the main park road and the Old Shore Road Trail. It is named after one of the former landowners in this part of the park.\n\nSwimming\n\nThe gradually sloping beach is 50 m in length and sandy with boulders. There are change facilities in the day use area. There is no buoyed area and no lifeguards are posted."
