        "text": "I spent last summer camping with an 18-foot trailer and a 90-pound German Shepherd Dog named Milo. Looking out at the mounds of snow in my backyard, I‚Äôm longing for some summer camping. And since you can reserve campsites in Ontario Provincial Parks five months in advance, it is time to start booking sites. I want to return to the best Ontario provincial parks for camping that I visited last summer.\n\nAs I was scrolling through last summer‚Äôs blog posts, I realized that I was happy in every single place, even the ones that were less than perfect. I‚Äôm mostly just happy to be camping. But some places were nicer than others and so here are my reviews of the Ontario provincial park campgrounds that I stayed in last summer:\n\nAaron Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nBalsam Lake Provincial Park: A good place for human contact (no ghosts)\n\nLots of sites (not all of them but lots of them) at Balsam Lake are just parking places in a big field. If you want to stay here, book early and look closely at the pictures of your potential campsite to make sure it is a place you really want to be.\n\nCaliper Lake Provincial Park: Needs hobbits\n\nCaliper Lake Provincial Park: Quick notes on the campground\n\nGrundy Lake Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nI was leery when I arrived because my site was in a campground called ‚ÄúTrailer,‚Äù but it was gorgeous, so don‚Äôt be put off by the name.\n\nSwan Lake Trail (at Grundy)\n\nKakabeka Falls Provincial Park: Great for people, stinky for dogs\n\nKillbear Provincial Park\n\nLookout Point Trail at Killbear Provincial Park\n\nThe off-leash dog beach is fabulous at Killbear\n\nMacGregor Point Provincial Park: Beautiful sunsets over Lake Huron\n\nMacGregor Point Provincial Park: Yurts and how to say ‚ÄúHi‚Äù to Milo\n\nMississagi Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada: Here be dragons\n\nWhen I was at Mississagi, it was wild and empty. üòÄ\n\nThe Beach at Pancake Bay Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nPancake Bay has a super dog beach.\n\nRainbow Falls Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada\n\nWhite Lake Provincial Park, Ontario: Home away from home\n\nHappy Camping Friends!\n\nThis park was stinky. Literally. I pulled into a campsite generously decorated with dog poop. While I was cleaning up it occurred to me that I had a neighbour who either lets their, evidently large, dog run loose, or is the sort of person who watches their dog poop in someone else‚Äôs campsite and thinks, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just gonna leave that sitting right there.‚Äù I was looking forward to meeting this person, and their dog. It was going to be great. I knew it.\n\nSure enough, on Milo and my first walk two retriever-ish looking dogs galloped toward us while their owners yelled from their camp chairs, you guessed it, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre friendly.‚Äù\n\nI yelled back, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not.‚Äù It just popped out, no mincing of words at all. And at that moment, it was true. ‚ÄúThose dogs need to be on leashes.‚Äù\n\nThe indignant response was, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why you‚Äôre upset. We haven‚Äôt had any problems.‚Äù\n\nI saw this as invitation to describe the poop, and, you know, the law, which didn‚Äôt go over so well. Who would‚Äôve thought? The best part was when they explained to me, and my fabulous gigantic German Shepherd Milo, that if I didn‚Äôt like dogs, I probably shouldn‚Äôt go camping. Oh boy, time to walk away. That time was actually long past, but as they say, better late than never. Some people.\n\nIn case you are wondering, here are some relevant bits of law:\n\nDomestic and other animals\n\n6. (1) No person in control of a domestic animal shall permit the animal to be,\n\n(a) in a provincial park unless the animal is secured on a leash that does not exceed two metres in length; ‚Ä¶\n\n(4) No person shall permit a domestic animal, while in a provincial park, to\n\n(a) make excessive noise;\n\n(b) disturb other persons;\n\n(c) damage Crown property or vegetation;\n\n(d) chase or harass wild animals or birds;\n\n(e) injure, or attempt to injure, a person or other domestic animal. O. Reg. 347/07, s. 6 (4).\n\n(5) The person in control of a domestic animal shall immediately dispose of excrement from the animal in such manner and at such location that it will not cause a health hazard or public inconvenience. O. Reg. 347/07, s. 6 (5). ‚Ä¶\n\nI am sure these people are not a permanent fixture at Aaron Provincial Park, but I let them colour my experience of the place more than I should‚Äôve. Thank heavens I discovered the group campground, a grassy field with picnic tables, empty. Milo and I spent a lot of time there romping, playing tug, training, and reading magazines (Milo didn‚Äôt read magazines as much as sat there and chewed a toy).\n\nAaron Provincial Park is conveniently located on the Trans Canada highway just East of Dryden, Ontario. It lacks a sanctioned off leash pet exercise area."
