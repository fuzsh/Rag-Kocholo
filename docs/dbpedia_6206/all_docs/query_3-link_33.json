        "text": "Create a scan\n\nGo to the top of this page and search for the park you want to camp at. Then choose your preferred campground, arrival date, number of nights, and how youâd like to pay. Once you have, your first campsite scan will start running. ð\n\nWait for an alert\n\nNowâs the tough partâ¦Â waiting. You never know when someone will cancel their campsite reservation. However, the longer you scan for, the better your odds. Not getting the results you want? Check out some of these tips for improving your chances.\n\nWHAT IS A CAMPSITE ALERT?\n\nA campsite alert is a text message that lets you know that a spot at a sold-out campsite is available.\n\nHOW DOES CAMPNAB WORK?\n\nYou set your criteria (park, campground, arrival, duration). We send you a text message if a suitable campsite becomes available.\n\nDOES CAMPNAB BOOK A CAMPSITE FOR ME?\n\nNo. We only provide notifications of openings at campsites. You still need to book through the respective parkâs website.\n\nHOW MUCH DOES CAMPNAB COST?\n\nPay-per-use scans range from $10 âÂ $20 each. Memberships start at $10/month, and afford frequent campers more options.\n\nDO YOU GUARANTEE SUCCESS?\n\nNope. We donât know who will cancel their reservation or when. Our fees are to monitor campgrounds.\n\nWHAT REGIONS DO YOU MONITOR?\n\nCampnab scans parks throughout Canada and the United States. Visit our Parks page for a list of parks we monitor.\n\nCAN I CANCEL MY CAMPNAB MEMBERSHIP?\n\nYesâyou can cancel/change your plan at any time by visiting the Plan screen. To cancel, click âCancel your planâ.\n\nI RECEIVED AN ALERT BUT THE SPOT IS GONE. WHAT GIVES?\n\nOdds are that someone already rebooked it. At popular parks, spots get rebooked in minutes (sometimes seconds).\n\nHOW DO I IMPROVE MY ODDS OF GETTING A CAMPSITE?\n\nRun shorter scans, mid-week, with plenty of lead time. Here are some more tips for getting a campsite reservation.\n\nI NEED HELP! WHO DO I TALK TO?\n\nStart a chat session with one of the Erics. (If weâre online, weâll respond immediately. If not, leave your email when prompted to ensure you receive our replies.)\n\nâ â â â â â â â â â\n\n11 Reviews\n\nKillbear Provincial Park\n\nKillbear Provincial Park is a provincial park located on Georgian Bay in the Parry Sound District of Ontario, near the town of Nobel.
