        "text": "Allontario ads\n\nPARKS CANADA, also known as the Parks Canada Agency, is a Government of Canada agency that is mandated to protect and present nationally significant examples of Canada’s natural and cultural heritage and foster public understanding, appreciation and enjoyment in ways that ensure their ecological and commemorative integrity for present and future generations. Parks Canada manages 42 National Parks (including seven National Park Reserves), 3 National Marine Conservation Areas, 1 National Landmark, and 166 National Historic Sites.\n\nParks Canada was established in 1911 as the Dominion Parks Branch under the Department of the Interior, becoming the world’s first national park service. Since then it has been formerly known as the National Parks Branch, and the Canadian Parks Service. Parks Canada activities are regulated under the provisions of the Canada National Parks Act, which was enacted in 1930, and amended in 2000.\n\nSince its establishment as a separate service agency in 1998, Parks Canada now falls under the responsibility of Environment Canada.\n\nParks Canada is currently headed by Mr. Alan Latourelle. Parks Canada has more than 4,000 employees from coast to coast. They work at national parks, national historic sites, national marine conservation areas, national historic canals, administrative offices and service centres. The annual budget for Parks Canada is approximately $500 million.\n\nNATIONAL PARKS located in Ontario\n\nParks, located in Ontario, administered by Parks Canada:\n\nBruce Peninsula National Park\n\nFathom Five National Marine Park\n\nGeorgian Bay Islands National Park\n\nPoint Pelee National Park\n\nPukaskwa National Park\n\nSt. Lawrence Islands National Park\n\nPROVINCIAL PARKS\n\nONTARIO PARKS administers over 330 parks, covering 9 million hectares that attract over 10 million visits each year, there is a lot to discover!\n\nOntario has reached a significant milestone: the province’s new Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act came into effect September 4, 2007. The Act is a key initiative in support of Ontario’s Biodiversity Strategy and also complements the province’s Natural Spaces program and the Greenbelt Act.\n\nOntario is now positioned as a Canadian leader in protected areas legislation. Our world-renowned system of provincial parks, conservation reserves and wilderness areas support natural heritage protection, and provide significant recreational and tourism benefits.\n\nThe Provincial Parks and Conservation Reserves Act will guide how these special areas are planned and managed – ensuring that future generations will benefit from a cleaner, healthier and more diverse natural environment.\n\nParks administered by Ontario Parks, arranged by region:\n\nCentral Ontario\n\nAlexander Stewart Provincial Park (Nature Reserve, 0.31km2/77acres)\n\nAlgonquin Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 7,653.45km2/1,891,210 acres)\n\nArrowhead Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 12.37km2/3,060 acres)\n\nAubrey Falls Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 48.60km2/12,010 acres)\n\nBatchawana Bay Provincial Park (Recreation, 1.69km2/420 acres)\n\nBell Bay Provincial Park (Natural Environment)\n\nBig East River Provincial Park (Waterway, 10.50km2/2,590 acres)\n\nBigwind Lake Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 19.67km2/4,860 acres)\n\nBon Echo Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 66.43km2/16,420 acres)\n\nBonnechere Provincial Park (Recreation, 1.62km2/400 acres)\n\nBonnechere River Provincial Park (Waterway, 11.98km2/2,960 acres)\n\nCarson Lake Provincial Park (Recreation)\n\nCentennial Lake Provincial Park (Nature Reserve, 5.30 km2/1,310 acres)\n\nChutes Provincial Park (Recreation, 1.08km2/270 acres)\n\nDalton Digby Wildlands Provincial Park (former name of Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park) (Natural Environment, 355.05km2/87,730 acres)\n\nDividing Lake Provincial Park (Nature Reserve, 3.50km2/860 acres)\n\nDriftwood Provincial Park (Recreation, 4.22km2/1,040 acres)\n\nEgan Chutes Provincial Park (Nature Reserve, 3.22km2/800 acres)\n\nFairbank Provincial Park (Recreation, 1.05km2/260 acres)\n\nFinlayson Point Provincial Park (Recreation, 0.37km2/91 acres)\n\nFoy Provincial Park (Recreation)\n\nFrench River Provincial Park (Waterway, 517.40 km2/127,850 acres)\n\nGibson River Provincial Park (Nature Reserve, 1.68 km2/420 acres)\n\nGrundy Lake Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 25.54 km2/6,310 acres)\n\nHalfway Lake Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 47.30 km2/11,690 acres)\n\nHardy Lake Provincial Park (Natural Environment, 7.65 km2/1,890 acres)\n\nJ.
