        "meta_description": "The City of Dryden operates&nbsp;Aaron&nbsp;Park&nbsp;under agreement with the Province of Ontario. All of Ontario Parks policies and regulations still apply, and revenues remain in the Park to offset operating costs and some infrastructure upgrades. Since the Park's reopening in 1997, visitation has been steadily increasing. Top quality customer service and a dedication by all involved have resulted in a clean, peaceful, family campground. There is lots to do at Aaron&nbsp;Park. You can take a hike on one of two hiking trails. Both are \"easy\" one hour trails. The Aspen Trail is 1.9 km and the Eastern White Cedar Trail is 1.2 km. You can also go fishing. Cast your line all season for walleye, northern pike and smallmouth bass. Lake trout fishing in the Spring is great. You can also go canoeing. Aaron Park is used as a starting point for several major canoe routes. If you have a motor boat, you can launch your boat at the north end of the park. Thunder Lake is great for power boating and sailing. You can go swimming at two sandy beaches that slope into clear, shallow water, perfect for family swimming. Please contact the Park staff at 807-938-6534 for details!\nPicnic areas in the City of Dryden:&nbsp;\nThere are picnic sites where Highway 17 enters both sides of the City and at the Dryden District Chamber of Commerce (by Max the Moose).
