        "text": "Dubbed by locals as Alberta's playground, Jasper National Park is a crown jewel of Canada's natural landscapes with its reputation drawing visits from royalty, Hollywood elite and nature lovers from far and wide.\n\nHot, dry conditions across western Canada sparked hundreds of fires across western Canada in July, and on the evening of July 22, Alberta authorities issued an emergency alert for the park as well as the municipality of Jasper, warning of the threat from a wildfire south of the town.\n\nOver 20,000 residents and tourists fled the village — many detailing a journey along smoke-choked mountain roads as ash and soot rained down over them.\n\nREAD MORE: Fire continues raging in town of Jasper, but key infrastructure OK, officials say\n\nThe following morning, the extent of damage the collosal wildfire caused became clear.\n\n\"Like all residents, I feel devastated, shattered and absolutely helpless in the face of nature,\" said Jasper Mayor Richard Ireland the morning after a massive wall of fire roared through the mountain village.\n\nJames Eastham, a Parks Canada wildfire information officer, said firefighters were faced with a wall of flame over Monday night that proved impossible to contain.\n\nIt wasn't until Friday, July 26 that the village was deemed safe enough for officials and media crews to enter and view the extent of damage caused by the blaze .\n\nCornerstones of Jasper's community before and after wildfire\n\nParks Canada has estimated 30 per cent of Jasper township’s structures were damaged, and a map of the town indicating which properties suffered damage was released on Saturday afternoon.\n\nAfter officials toured the town, it became evident that both the mayor and the Jasper fire chief's homes were among the casualties of the blaze.\n\n“We grew up here … a family of five kids and our parents, and just about always at least one grandparent was living with us,” the 69-year-old said to the media.\n\nBelow, we have gathered photos of cornerstones of the Jasper community before and after the wildfire roared through the town.\n\nJasper Maligne Lodge\n\nKaryn Decore, whose family has owned Maligne Lodge for over 60 years, is mourning the loss of their hotel establishment and is heartbroken for her staff — many of whom come from countries around the world. The lodge was among the buildings burned Wednesday night.\n\nSt. Mary & St. George Anglican Church\n\nThe St. Mary & St. George Anglican Church, a community fixture since 1923, was destroyed in the recent wildfires. In 2005, during their visit to Alberta and Saskatchewan, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip attended a Sunday congregation at the Jasper church.\n\nL&W Family Restaurant\n\nA long-operating Greek restaurant in the townsite has been destroyed by fire. On its website, L&W family-owned restaurant says it began in the 1970s as a single-room kitchen in the back of a gas station. Its building had a distinctive glass front in the dining area.\n\nHomes along Cabin Creek Drive\n\nWhen officials toured Jasper in the wake of the wildfire, the group was driven to Cabin Creek Drive, where a swath of homes had been annihilated. Disfigured pieces of grey and black metal scraps were scattered everywhere.\n\nConnaught Dr. Petro Canada\n\nThe Petro Canada located on Connaught Drive was a popular hotspot for tourists to tank up and load up on snacks before hitting the mountain roads.\n\nAnimal habitat\n\nAs officials and media performed their first walkthroughs of Jasper on Friday, details are emerging over how wildlife in the area fared amid the fire."
