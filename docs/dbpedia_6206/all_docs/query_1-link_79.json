        "text": "SUTTON, Mass. - Ron Tetreau has owned Founding Fathers Tactical and Shooting Supplies for about a year and a half. But after Gov. Maura Healey signed an act modernizing firearms laws, he's not sure what the future of his business is. The law prohibits possession, transfer, or sale of âassault-styleâ firearms or large-capacity feeding devices.\n\n\"More than 60 to 70% of the firearms we sell today, retail in the state of Massachusetts, have a detachable magazine,\" Tetreau said. \"They are capable of taking a high-capacity magazine. So, we're hesitant to purchase new inventory because we don't actually know what we can and cannot sell.\"\n\nTetreau, a former police officer, says he's reached out to leadership on Beacon Hill in hopes of having those questions answered, but is yet to have any luck.\n\nWhat You Need To Know\n\nLocal gun shop owners like Rob Tetreau are concerned after Gov. Maura Healey signed an act modernizing firearms laws, saying he's not sure what the future of his business is\n\nThe law prohibits possession, transfer, or sale of âassault-styleâ firearms or large-capacity feeding devices\n\nThe Healey administration is calling it the stateâs most significant gun safety legislation in a decade\n\nTetreau says the bill also makes changes for instructors including necessary suicide prevention discussions and de-escalation techniques on a state-approved range\n\nSpeaking after the bill's signing, the governor said the legislation will offer further protections in the state by addressing the issue of 3D-printed guns, ghost guns, and strengthening red flag laws.\n\n\"We want our communities to be safe and healthy,\" Healey said at a press conference. \"We have a duty, an obligation to prevent these harms. And we know strong, smart gun laws save lives.\"\n\nThe Healey administration is calling it the stateâs most significant gun safety legislation in a decade.\n\nTetreau says the bill also makes changes for instructors, which he is, including necessary suicide prevention discussions and de-escalation techniques on a state-approved range.\n\n\"Recently spoke with my insurance company,\" Tetreau said. \"They want to see the actual law, they want to see the actual curriculum that the state's going to put together, and then they're going to determine whether they're going to insure me or not. Because now, there's an extra level of liability that's been placed on the instructors that are out there.\"\n\nWhile speaking to Spectrum News 1 recently, the Gun Owners Action League says they're taking steps in hopes of repealing the bill.\n\n\"We're going to file a petition process, a referendum, and we're in that process now for the November election to repeal the law,\" said GOAL executive director Jim Wallace. \"Because people have no idea what their legislators just did.\"\n\nTetreau couldn't offer specifics, but says he too is considering legal action, claiming this new bill is infringing upon his rights.\n\n\"And hopefully, the people will have their right and their choice to vote on this bill and this law,\" Tetreau said. \"It really was just kind of rammed down our throats, and hopefully in November, the people make a choice.\""
