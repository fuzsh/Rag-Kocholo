        "text": "Overview\n\nA daily vehicle permit is a great way to explore a provincial park for the day. Bike, hike, swim, picnic and make some magical outdoor memories.\n\nIncludes entry at any operating provincial park for one vehicle and its passengers.\n\nMost permits are valid from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm, but can vary by park.\n\nEnjoy a park in every season. Daily vehicle permits are available year round â€“ each park has its own operating dates so check ahead to plan your adventure.\n\nParks can get busy!\n\nParks can get busy, and we only have room for a limited number of visitors each day.\n\nPlanning a day trip? Daily vehicle permits are available in advance of arrival at participating parks. Buying your permit for one of these parks in advance guarantees access and reduces time spent during arrival at a park.\n\nSeasonal permit holder? A seasonal permit on its own does not guarantee entry. We strongly recommend obtaining your day use spot in advance at no extra charge using your seasonal permit's serial number.\n\nAt all other parks daily vehicle permits are available on a first come first served basis upon arrival."
