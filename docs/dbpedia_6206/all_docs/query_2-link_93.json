        "text": "THUNDER BAY â€” As part of a province-wide plan to make camping more accessible to more people, three-week-long stays at campsites in some provincial parks in Northwestern Ontario will be unavailable most of the summer.\n\nDuring the peak season from July 1 to Labour Day weekend, the Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks will reduce the maximum length of stay from 23 nights to either 14 or seven nights at the more popular parks across Ontario.\n\nIn the Northwest, the change affects Sleeping Giant, Rainbow Falls, Neys, Quetico and Rushing River Provincial Parks.\n\nThe maximum permitted stays in these parks will be 14 nights.\n\n\"We've heard from countless visitors how frustrating it can be to miss out on a summer camping reservation,\" the ministry stated. \"With reservations in high demand, it can be difficult to get a campsite at some of our campgrounds.\"\n\nAccording to the ministry, camping in provincial parks has grown steadily from 4.3 million reserved campsite nights in 2014 to over 6.6 million in 2021.\n\nAt about a dozen other parks in Northwestern Ontario, the limit will remain 23 nights.\n\nThese locations include Kakabeka Falls, Arrow Lake, Silver Falls, MacLeod, White Lake, Sandbar Lake, Aaron, Pakwash, Ojibway, Caliper Lake and Sioux Narrows.\n\nMore information about booking and staying at provincial park campsites is available online."
