Aaron Provincial Park ( National Parks )

Aaron Provincial Park is the perfect stopping point for cross-country explorers. Aaron is ideal for water-based activities such as swimming, boating, and fishing. The park's Thunder Lake is a remnant of the ancient glaciers that covered Ontario thousands of years ago.

The campsites are well-maintained and the washrooms and showers. They have nice beaches, two short hiking trails (<2km) and potting water. Due to the proximity of a highway, it might be uncomfortable for someone with sensitive hearing to sleep at night. Other than that it is a wonderful place to stay.
