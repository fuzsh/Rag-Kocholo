National Benzole joined the Shell-Mex and BP Ltd family in 1957 but continued to trade separately.

In 1959, responding to the growing importance of benzole as a specialist chemical, it was decided to concentrate on this market by means of a new company named Benzole Producers Limited.[1] At the same time the motor fuel marketing business was now fully merged with Shell-Mex and BP Ltd.[1] Benzole (no longer part of the mixture) was dropped from the fuel's name and Mr Mercuryâ€™s black and chrome gave way to sparkling new yellow, blue and white. Following the de-merger of Shell-Mex and British Petroleum (BP) in 1976, the National brand continued to be distinctively marketed by BP for over a decade.
