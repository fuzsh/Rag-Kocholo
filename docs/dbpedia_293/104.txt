The National Benzole Company was a prominent British petroleum company that operated from 1919 to the mid-1950s. Its history is closely intertwined with the development of the British oil industry and the rise of motor vehicles during the early 20th century. Here's an overview of its history:

1. Formation and Early Years: The National Benzole Company was formed in 1919 as a joint venture between the Distillers Company Limited (DCL) and the British Petroleum Company (BP). The primary objective of the company was to produce and market benzole, a byproduct of coal distillation, which could be blended with petrol (gasoline) to improve its performance.

2. Petrol Blending and National Benzole Mixture: During the 1920s and 1930s, National Benzole became well-known for its innovative approach to petrol blending. It produced a branded fuel known as "National Benzole Mixture," which was a blend of benzole and petrol, designed to increase octane levels and improve engine performance. This made National Benzole Mixture a popular choice among motorists.

3. Expansion and Acquisitions: Over time, the company expanded its operations and acquired several oil storage and distribution facilities. National Benzole's presence grew across the United Kingdom, and it became a significant player in the fuel retail sector.

4. Post-World War II Era: After World War II, there were significant changes in the British oil industry. The British government nationalized several key industries, including the coal and petroleum sectors. In 1948, the government formed the National Benzole (Marketing) Act, which led to the nationalization of the benzole blending and marketing operations. The National Benzole Company, along with other private companies in the sector, became part of the state-owned National Benzole (Marketing) Corporation (NBMC).

5. Demise and Legacy: As the demand for benzole declined, and with the advent of new refining processes and synthetic additives, the significance of National Benzole's operations waned. In the mid-1950s, the National Benzole (Marketing) Corporation was dissolved, and its assets and operations were integrated into other entities within the British oil industry.

Today, the name "National Benzole" is mostly associated with vintage petrol advertising and memorabilia, as the brand and its logo have nostalgic value among collectors and automotive enthusiasts.

About The National Benzole Mercury Head Logo

The National Benzole Mercury Head logo is one of the most iconic and recognizable logos associated with the National Benzole brand. It is distinctively characterized by a depiction of the Roman god Mercury, also known as Hermes in Greek mythology, with wings on his helmet. Here's a brief overview of the logo's history and significance:

1. Design and Origins: The Mercury Head logo was introduced in the late 1920's and quickly became the primary emblem for the National Benzole brand. It featured a profile illustration of the god Mercury with a winged helmet, symbolizing speed and movement. Mercury, the messenger of the gods in Roman mythology, was often associated with attributes such as swiftness and agility, making him a fitting symbol for a fuel company aiming to promote the performance benefits of its products.

2. National Benzole Mixture Connection: The Mercury Head logo was closely associated with National Benzole's flagship product, the "National Benzole Mixture," a fuel blend that combined benzole with petrol to enhance engine performance. The Mercury Head logo often appeared on fuel pumps, station signage, advertising materials, and promotional items related to the National Benzole Mixture.
