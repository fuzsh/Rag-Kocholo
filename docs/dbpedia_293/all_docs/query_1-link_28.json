Paul.\n\ntankerjack:\n\nThank you for your reply , i have the aerial view of Dunball terminal , is the building on bottom left the new garages being built ? , can you remember why the Albion was being towed ? , and in one of the photos with a view of the vehicle wash there is a Guy 8 wheeler next to the Scammell trunker of BP Oil , was the Guy 8 wheeler in the BP livery ? , Shell - BP had Guy 8 Wheelers , there is a photo of that vehicle in a century of petroleum , its a very good book and i would recommend it if your interest is british lorries. Did you have any hairy moments whilst in your employment as a tanker driver or funny experiences , or can you recall your fellow drivers having a bad day at the office !!. All the best Paul.\n\ntankerjack:\n\nHi Bryan , i hope that boat was empty and not loaded with product , that would have been a tricky situation to deal with if it was loaded , the depot at Heysham was supplied by the refinery at Heysham , it was only a small operation , it was built in wartime 1941-2 to supply the RAF with avaition fuel and other petroleum products , many of the finished product tanks were buried into the landscape to avoid detection , but they the German pilots must have been able to see the lansdcape shape from above , the Heysham depot was shared by both Shell oil and BP oil , it was a delight to see the same lorries with diffrent liveries , i got a few photos when i was younger , BP moved to Partington , Gt Manchester and eventually due to the age of the depot and as you know many depots closed due to cost cutting , vehicles were new and technically advanced bigger and faster and could cover longer distances quicker ! and most of all Gas had become a major fuel that was cleaner and fuel oil was not King anymore , the depot closed in 1983 along with many others in the UK ,Shell moved to Haydock even Partington has closed and become a wood yard , Heysham was totally relandscaped all the tankfarms were dug out and it has new businesses park , the only reminder is the maintenance garage the company that bought the land , refabricated the outer shell and blended it to match the rest of the buidings , i always look for it every time i go down to collect my trailer at Heysham dock. i have another view of the depot this time from the river side showing the ship delivering fuel to the terminal."
