        "text": "With the rapid development of Britain during the early-twentieth century, along with two world wars, oil and petroleum products were needed in abundance to fuel both growth and the war efforts and the railways played an important part in its transport. 14 Ton Tank Wagons like this example would carry Class A and Class B products, both in block trains and in mixed formations. This Graham Farish model features metal wire hawsers, fine mouldings for the tank filler and valve, and separately fitted brake gear and hand brakes.\n\nMODEL FEATURES:"
