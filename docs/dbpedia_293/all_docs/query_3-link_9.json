        "text": "Choose from the extensive historic photographic archive of the British Motor Industry Heritage Trust (BMIHT), a priceless resource spanning over a 100 years of the motor industry and motor sport including racing, rallying, advertising, manufacturing and social history.\n\nHow are the photos printed?\n\nProduced using professional photographic C-type printers, on 250 gsm Professional Fuji Crystal Archive Matt paper with a lifespan of 80+ years. Each image is checked before processing to ensure the maximum print quality.\n\nDo you crop the photos?\n\nMost images have been sized to fit our standard prints sizes and are printed full size bleed to the edge of the paper. Some photos may require minor cropping and therefore could slightly differ to what you see on the site, however if we feel cropping would compromise the photo we will reduce the image size to fit within the standard print size.\n\nPrint sizes and costs\n\n12x8\", 305x203mm,\n\nInitial = £13.95\n\nCopies = £12.95\n\n16x11\", 406x280mm,\n\nInitial = £18.95\n\nCopies = £17.98\n\n22x15\", 558x381mm,\n\nInitial = £24.95\n\nCopies = £23.75\n\n30x20\", 762x508mm,\n\nInitial = £36.95\n\nCopies = £35.45\n\nPlease note all sizes are within 2mm. All prices include VAT\n\nHow are the Canvases Printed?\n\nUsing the latest printing technology featuring a 12 colour printing process producing exceptional, vibrant results, our canvases are printed using pigment inks on a high quality UK manufactured 360 gsm poly-cotton canvas.\n\nWe use a very smooth surface canvas in order to maintain as much image detail as possible. To ensure the ultimate protection and long life of the canvases all canvases are sealed using our Heatseal Lamination process. This provides protection against fading from UV light together with a scratch proof, water resistant surface, without losing the canvas look.\n\nHow are they Framed?\n\nAfter sealing which ensure the edges of the canvas will not crack when stretched around the stretcher bar. They are hand finished by stretching the canvas over a 32 mm stretcher bar under high tension.\n\nThe edges/sides of the canvas between the image and the back of the frame, is white. White edge canvases are standard, while full bleed canvases are subject to a 10% charge depending on the size of the order. Contact us offline for more details and pricing.\n\nHow long will a canvas take to complete?\n\nOrders will be despatched within 6 working days.\n\nPrint sizes and costs\n\n15x10\", 381x254mm\n\n= £54.95\n\n24x16\", 610x406mm\n\n= £94.95\n\n36x24\", 915x610mm\n\n= £135.95\n\n42x28\", 1067x711mm\n\n= £155.95\n\nPlease note all sizes are within 4mm.
