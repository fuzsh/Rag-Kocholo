There was only one major international oil company in 1900 – the US-based Standard Oil – but by 1914 there were several. Most were American, but two which have lasted to the present day were European. One was the Royal Dutch/Shell group, part Dutch and part British, and one the wholly British Anglo-Persian Oil Company, later to become BP. So Britain, which then had practically no known oil, fostered two companies which are still world leaders in the industry. This book is about why and how that happened and how Britain and the British government have interacted with oil and oil companies over the twentieth century. Britain’s troubled relationship with the Middle East is part of the story. The role oil played in wars is another. The power of oil companies vis-à-vis governments and markets a third. And the changes brought about by the oil crises of the 1970s a fourth. The discovery and exploitation of oil and gas in the North Sea is covered, and the book also looks at the social history of oil and its products during the century – their uses, their marketing and their impact. The conclusion ends with a brief look at the future. There are plentiful secondary sources and the book is mainly based on these, but I have consulted primary sources where there are gaps. Books of particular value include the ofﬁcial histories of Royal Dutch/Shell and BP, referred to in notes as RDS and BP. Full references are given in the bibliography. Both histories are, so far as I can tell, admirably objective – certainly neither hesitates to criticize their company. I owe a particular debt to the BP history. Unfortunately the fourth volume of this, from 1975, has not yet been published. Two other books which were very valuable were Geoffrey Jones, The State and the Emergence of the British Oil Industry, on the British industry’s early years, and Daniel Yergin’s The Prize, a history of the international oil industry. Statistics, if not otherwise attributed,\n\nviii\n\nP R E FAC E\n\nare likely to come from the extremely useful BP Statistical Review of World Energy, accessible on the company’s website. North Sea oil lacks a comprehensive history and Professor Alexander Kemp’s book in the UK government’s Ofﬁcial History series will be of great value when it is published. I should also mention the oral history archive ‘Lives in the Oil Industry’. I only listened extensively to three interviews out of nearly two hundred, but the archive is clearly important not just for the history of North Sea oil and gas but also for British – especially Scottish – social history. A few words are needed about terminology. ‘Oil’ encompasses vegetable and mineral oil, but most people will take it to mean the latter, and it has been used in that sense in the book. Mineral oil is also known as petroleum. Before petroleum is reﬁned it is commonly known as crude oil, or crude. ‘Upstream’ refers to exploration for and production of crude, and ‘downstream’ to its reﬁning and marketing. I have used the British ‘petrol’ rather than the American ‘gasoline’ for one of oil’s main products. However, I have preferred ‘kerosene’ to the traditional British ‘parafﬁn’. As people become less familiar with parafﬁn stoves and lighting, kerosene – now mainly used for jet fuel – is becoming the accepted usage. The familiar measure of oil, a barrel, never actually used for physical storage today, contains about 35 Imperial gallons (42 US gallons). There are about seven to eight barrels per ton depending on the speciﬁc gravity of the oil. ‘bpd’ means ‘barrels per day’ – a standard measure of output; ‘oe’ in that context means ‘oil equivalent’ and includes gas. I have speciﬁed metric tons (tonnes) where I know that to be the measurement but have not been exact about ‘tons and ‘metric tons’ – the former is actually 1.016 of the latter. Finally, I should apologize to Dutch readers for sometimes abbreviating references to Royal Dutch Shell so that it may appear as if it was wholly British, when it is and was both Dutch and British. I would like to acknowledge the assistance of the BP Archive. I would also like to acknowledge help from the following: Professor Bernard Alford; Joanne Burman; Michael Greenwood; Valerie Johnson; Tony Morris, who thought of the book in the ﬁrst place; Suzanne Richards; Professor Hew Strachan; and, most of all, my wife Hilary.\n\n1\n\nComing of Age: Oil 1900–18\n\nCAPITALISTS AND CONCESSIONS In 1884 word began to spread in Rockhampton, a port in Queensland, Australia, of a big gold discovery in the hills inland. The land beneath which the discovery lay was owned by the Morgan family and the gold mine became Mount Morgan. Like so many Australian mines, however, Mount Morgan after a brief ﬂurry seemed to be ‘a jeweller’s shop on top and a blacksmith’s shop below’. The mine still yielded gold, but not much, and the Morgans were glad to sell their holding to various local speculators, the largest proportion being acquired by William Knox D’Arcy, who already had an interest in the mine. D’Arcy’s father, a solicitor, had emigrated from England and William had followed the paternal profession in Australia. He ﬁtted well into the family’s new home. He was keen on sport, particularly horse-racing, and speculation. He was also lucky. By 1886, Mount Morgan had turned out to be a jeweller’s shop all the way down. It was one of the richest gold mines ever and D’Arcy’s fortune was made. In its best year the company paid over one million pounds in dividends – and D’Arcy had over one-third of the capital. In 1889 D’Arcy returned to England where he lived the plutocratic lifestyle typical of the wealthy in late Victorian and Edwardian England.1 By 1900 Mount Morgan’s falling yield was not enough to ﬁnance D’Arcy’s colossal spending, and he needed another bonanza. An ex-ambassador to Persia, Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, introduced him to the possibilities of another type of gold – black gold. It would come in the form of Persian oil. Persia, the modernday Iran, had long been seen as a potential oil producer, but the uncertainties of the country’s politics frightened off investors. The country’s nominally autocratic ruler, the Shah, was in reality weak. Local leaders or khans held much of the\n\n2\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nreal power while the Shah was buffeted by Russian pressure from the north and British from the south. However, the Shah needed money and was anxious for a deal. D’Arcy, used to speculating deeply and still with plenty of capital in the form of Mount Morgan shares, was willing to take the risk. The concession, to search for and exploit oil over a large proportion of the country, was granted for 60 years in return for a lump sum payment and 16 per cent of the annual proﬁts. ‘Proﬁts’ being a moveable feast, the vagueness of this was to prove a hostage to fortune. But although the rate seemed low by later standards, the risks to D’Arcy were extreme: not only Persia’s political vagaries but the fact that, as yet, no oil besides surface seepages had been found. Drummond Wolff ’s description of D’Arcy as a ‘capitalist of the highest order’ seems fair comment.2 The concession was signed in 1901, and its eventual importance to Britain’s oil industry makes this as good a date as any to start its history. But there are a number of alternatives. The ﬁrst internal combustion-engined car in Britain was Daimler’s of 1897. In the same year, an existing ﬂeet of oil tankers was incorporated as the “Shell” Transport and Trading Company. A decade earlier, the dawn of British oil multinationals had been heralded by the Burmah Oil Company, incorporated in 1886, only 27 years after the founding of the modern industry by Colonel Drake, who in 1859 struck oil at Titusville in Pennsylvania. Furthermore some aspects of the industry before 1900 were well developed. There were already oil tankers and pipelines, and the industry already tended towards oligopoly, that is the dominance of a few large companies, manifested in this period by the pre-eminence of Rockefeller’s Standard Oil. But in spite of some modern characteristics the industry in 1900 was still tiny and specialized. Numerous products can be extracted from crude oil, and in 1900 the only one consumed in quantity in Britain was kerosene, better known in this country as parafﬁn. (Technically parafﬁn is a waxy solid, distinct from parafﬁn oil, but British English usually refers to the latter simply as ‘parafﬁn’.) Nowadays kerosene is mainly used as a fuel for jet engines, although it is also used for heating. But in 1900 its main use was for lighting, for the millions of homes which had progressed beyond candles but for whose owners or tenants gas lighting was too expensive or unavailable – electric lighting still being very rare. In other words, most oil consumed in Britain was used for a purpose which is now practically defunct. For practically every other use with which we now associate oil or natural gas, Britain like most countries used coal. Heating was mainly by coal – traditionally in Britain burnt on inefﬁcient open ﬁres – and likewise cooking in ranges was usually coal ﬁred. The main alternative for these was gas, produced from coal. Railways were powered by steam which was raised by burning coal, as was most sea transport apart from the few remaining sailing\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n3\n\nships. Most industry was also powered by steam engines. Where electricity was making inroads it, too, was mainly generated by coal-ﬁred steam engines. To produce this heat and power, Britain in 1900 mined 225 million tons of coal each year, 44 million tons of which were exported.3 And where steam engines were impracticable due to their weight in relation to power produced, as in road transport, the horse still reigned supreme. One other event makes the beginning of the century an apt time to start. In 1901 the Admiralty started serious trials of oil to raise steam in warship boilers. Its relatively rapid adoption was not predestined. Oil had obvious beneﬁts – higher thermal efﬁciency per ton of fuel, reduced labour costs and much easier fuelling. But Britain had plentiful supplies of Welsh steam coal which was considerably cheaper than oil. Nevertheless the Royal Navy, as well as being the largest navy in the world, had by 1905 also become the leader in the use of oil as a fuel, although the quantities used were still small.4 The development was to prove of great importance to D’Arcy’s Persian speculation. The D’Arcy Concession’s ﬁrst exploration wells were drilled in the west of the country, where there were surface seepages of oil. Later this was to become an important oil producing area, but at the time drilling technology and geological understanding were limited. The Concession used old-fashioned pole drilling which hammered the drill bit into the ground. Attempts to shift to cable drilling – more efﬁcient although it still relied on percussion, by raising and lowering a chisel-shaped bit – were stymied by the need to avoid offending the Russian drillers who were used to the pole method.5 There were other difﬁculties. Hauling drilling materials in the virtually roadless landscape meant that some sort of infrastructure had to be created, and the necessary labour force housed and fed. But the local workers were quite unused to modern, or even pre-modern, methods. Progress became easier only when they were introduced to wheelbarrows. With limited central government control, local leaders ‘seemed very keen on receiving a substantial present from us, especially in the shape of some shares of our Company’. By 1903 D’Arcy was running short of money. He had discussions with potential investors, including the Paris Rothschilds, but they were fruitless. An oil strike in 1904 was encouraging but the ﬂow soon reduced to a trickle. He was saved by Burmah Oil (henceforth Burmah; the company produced oil in Burma but always spelt its name with an ‘h’), a relatively wealthy company. Burmah’s share in the Concession was ﬁnalized in 1905 and at the same time drilling moved to the south-west of Persia. There were more years of heat, difﬁculty and frustration to come. But on 20 May 1908, oil was struck at Masjid-I-Suleiman, about 120 miles from the Persian Gulf.6 A happy myth, promulgated in early accounts of the discovery, has Burmah\n\n4\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nsending a letter to George Reynolds, the stalwart supervisor of operations, instructing him to stop work, but this not being received until after oil was discovered. The reality is that there was a letter, but it instructed him to stop work after two more wells had been drilled to 1,600 feet, and oil was in fact struck by the ﬁrst at a depth of 1,180 feet.7 In the words of Burmah Oil’s historian, ‘Reynolds’s drillers had just uncovered the most extensive oilﬁeld thus far known to man . . . and had taken the ﬁrst step towards transforming the economies of the near and middle east’.8 They had also saved D’Arcy’s and Burmah’s ﬁnancial bacon, established the basis for what was to become one of the world’s great oil companies, and ensured that, 30 years later, Britain would be able to fuel her armed forces in the Middle East and India in the Second World War. How far was this an imperial adventure and how far a commercial speculation? Ernest Pretyman, an Admiralty minister, had introduced Burmah to D’Arcy. Bolstering British investment in Persia as an antidote to Russia was also a factor in the British government’s attitude. But a later statement by Burmah’s chairman made it clear that, although he believed that Imperial interests were served by investing in Persia, Burmah had primarily been interested in the commercial prospects.9 The key to the Concession’s success was a vast oilﬁeld, although it was years before its full extent was realized. Aeons ago marine algae and bacteria in longgone seas died and sunk to the bottom. Their remains were buried under later rock formations and were transmuted by pressure and the earth’s heat into oil and gas, which migrated upwards through porous rock until trapped. Therefore oil is likely to be found where non-porous rocks overlie porous ones – sandstone or some limestones. One would like to imagine Styx-like rivers ﬂowing into sunless underground seas of oil, but in fact the oil, mixed with varying amounts of gas, is contained under pressure in the interstices of the rock itself. This simple description encompasses huge variations in the extent and nature of each ﬁeld. Compared to any earlier discovery, the Masjid-I-Suleiman ﬁeld was remarkable in its extent and its uniformity, since the ﬁeld comprised one huge underlying dome of limestone through which the oil could ﬂow freely, if slowly. The next step, in 1909, was to ﬂoat a company, which enabled D’Arcy to realize his investment and further cash to be raised to ﬁnance a pipeline and reﬁnery. The new company was called the Anglo-Persian Oil Company – APOC – and so it remained until 1935. It was only in 1954 that it took the name British Petroleum, usually known as BP. APOC’s reﬁnery was established at Abadan, an area of swampland on the Persian Gulf. Reﬁning at that time was by the long established method of distillation: as the product ﬂowed through a series of increasingly hotter retorts ‘fractions’ of the oil were drawn off, the most volatile ﬁrst. The\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n5\n\nresidue was fuel oil. Persian crude posed problems: it was a sulphurous product which was difﬁcult to reﬁne. In addition the company had no distribution network save in a limited area around the Persian Gulf. By 1912 they were again in ﬁnancial difﬁculties and had to conclude an agreement for Shell to take some of their crude oil and kerosene. This necessary arrangement was a very sore point to the APOC directors. Shell was widely unpopular, an attitude which owed itself partly to envy and, in APOC’s case, a reasonable desire to stand on their own two feet. Furthermore, the APOC directors were imperially-minded – a fact which they used shamelessly in their subsequent negotiations with the British government but also reﬂected genuine beliefs. So they did not want to be seen simply as a subcontractor for another company.10 The obvious solution to their problems was the sale of the fuel oil which was largely going to waste. There were two sizeable potential markets, Indian railways and the Royal Navy. For merchant vessels, coal was still the predominant fuel since it could be shipped cheaply to ports around the world; on railways, where cheap coal was not always available, steam locomotives frequently burnt fuel oil. However, sales to the Indian railways were not forthcoming. This left the Navy. After 1905 there had been a brief period of retrogression to coal-ﬁring, for economy reasons, but from 1909 they renewed their commitment to fuel oil and incorporated it in increasing amounts of new construction. This process had been given further impetus by Winston Churchill, who as an up-and-coming member of the Liberal government became First Lord of the Admiralty, that is its political head, in 1911.11 The acceleration posed its own major problem – supply. Hitherto the Admiralty had met its oil needs from short-term contracts and one small longer term one with Burmah. But in 1913, under the pressure of demand, fuel oil prices began to rise. In addition there were already fears – premature as it turned out – that the USA, the world’s largest producer, would in future have a declining surplus to sell overseas.12 At the same time, APOC was still having difﬁculties reﬁning its oil and was in desperate ﬁnancial straits. A bargain was struck. The government in 1914 subscribed for a large new issue of APOC shares, becoming the owner of two-thirds of the company. In return, APOC entered into a long-term supply contract for fuel oil. The bargain seemed unprecedented. This was a government formed from the party once committed to free trade and hostile to government interference. In reality, the Liberals had changed and the world had changed, and these changes are dealt with later in the chapter.\n\n6\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nENTREPRENEURS IN OIL APOC and Burmah were not the only large British-owned oil companies in the 1900s. At the turn of the century, and indeed for the century to come, the largest was Shell. The origins of Shell lay in a London-based trading company owned by the Samuel family, whose merchandise included exotic sea-shells, popular for ornamentation in mid-Victorian Britain. Its diverse trading interests led to the ﬁrm developing strong Far Eastern connections. The commercial coup which established the family as a major player in the oil world came in 1892, when their ﬁrst oil tanker – larger and safer than any previous one – was launched. The tanker was part of a complex plan which had had its foundations in Far Eastern sales of kerosene originating in Russia. This was shipped via a railway, ﬁnanced by the Paris branch of the Rothschild banking family, from Baku on the Caspian to the Black Sea. The Baku oil producing region had already made Russia the second oil producer after the USA, and the Rothschilds had spotted the potential to export kerosene to the Far East.13 But on its long passage from the Black Sea to the East it was inefﬁciently transported in wooden ‘cases’, each of which held two ﬁve-gallon cans. It was the Samuel brothers, Marcus and Sam, who devised the scheme for bulk export, developed a distribution network and took the risk of ordering a number of tankers, all the time keeping the plan under wraps to head off counter-action from Standard Oil. An important part was also played by a less well-known ﬁgure, Fred Lane, a shipbroker who had chartered the ﬁrst bulk oil tanker to arrive in Britain in 1885. The ﬁrst tanker was rapidly followed by others and in 1897 the syndicate, headed by the Samuels, which owned the tankers formed a limited company, The “Shell” Transport and Trading Company. The capital of £1.8 million should be multiplied by at least 50 to arrive at some approximation to present-day values.14 (The apostrophes around Shell were in the original title. For many years the company, and later the group which it joined, were familiarly referred to as ‘the Shell’, but I will use the now standard ‘Shell’ or ‘the Shell group’.) Shell’s conception and, for a few early years its execution, were brilliantly successful. But Marcus Samuel, the prime mover, was carried away by his early triumphs. Shell expanded its tanker ﬂeet too fast while Standard Oil effectively stymied its efforts to put together an adequate distribution network. By 1907 Shell was running out of money. It was forced into a shotgun marriage with a producing and marketing company, Royal Dutch. Royal Dutch and Shell had been associated almost since Shell’s foundations. Royal Dutch had suffered vicissitudes but, by the mid-1900s, it had become a very prosperous concern with producing interests in Sumatra and Romania.\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n7\n\nThe 1907 agreement preserved the two companies but merged their assets. Royal Dutch took 60 per cent of the proﬁts, Shell 40 per cent, and in addition Royal Dutch bought a signiﬁcant proportion of Shell’s shares. So Shell was very much a minority partner and the ownership of the group was at ﬁrst predominantly Dutch. But Henri Deterding, the moving force behind Royal Dutch, believed that Shell provided an invaluable entrée to the vast potential resources, and market, of the British Empire. Therefore the group was run as a genuine multinational in that its management was split between London and The Hague, whilst of course its operations were worldwide. Not immediately but in time the main holding companies underneath the two parent companies all had ‘Shell’ in their names and Shell became the name by which most knew the group.15 The union in 1907 also marked the beginning of a new phase of growth. The petrol market was now expanding rapidly. Shell had found it difﬁcult to break into the British market due to Standard Oil’s dominance but an agreement with British Petroleum gave it outlets in Britain. In spite of its name, British Petroleum at that time was predominantly German owned and had no connection with APOC, which was eventually to take it over. Also in 1907 Shell was allowed to bring tankerloads of petrol through the Suez Canal, which had hitherto refused their passage as petrol was more inﬂammable than kerosene. (Reﬁning at that time was largely carried out near the source of production, so far more product was transported than crude oil.) The group expanded in Russia, purchasing the Rothschild interest there, while discovering new oilﬁelds in Borneo and Egypt.16 In 1911 it became the world’s largest oil company when American anti-trust actions dissolved Standard Oil. The latter had been so large that its offshoots still constituted three of the world’s seven largest oil companies with the largest, Standard Oil of New Jersey (now Exxon), vying with Shell for supremacy. But the old Standard Oil’s ability to stymie others’ growth was now diminished. Indeed the Shell group itself also expanded into the USA, buying wells in Oklahoma and California. Deterding’s policy was to undercut the American companies, largely dependent on American production, in other parts of the world by applying the ‘principle that each market must be supplied with products emanating from the ﬁelds which are most favourably situated geographically’. By the eve of the First World War, while Burmah remained a localized producer and APOC struggled with its production and marketing problems, the British arm of Royal Dutch/ Shell seemed to bestride the British oil world.17 It had, however, one major rival whose connection with oil is now largely forgotten except by historians: Weetman Pearson. Pearson’s name lives on in the media giant which owns the Financial Times and Penguin books. But the family started as civil engineering contractors, building drainage systems, docks and\n\n8\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nrailways all over the world. Their success in this owed much to Pearson’s character, which combined a willingness to take risks and ability to perceive the big picture with attention to detail. He had a more winning personality than many powerful people, possessing the ability to command without its frequent accompaniment, arrogance. His interest in social justice made him politically a Liberal, supporting old age pensions and other relatively advanced social programmes.18 In some ways Pearson’s friendship with the Mexican leader Porﬁrio Diaz is paradoxical, given that Diaz ruled through a mixture of force and corruption. But Pearson may have been attracted by Diaz’s genuine concern with the economic development of Mexico, which he had achieved with considerable success, although only limited beneﬁts trickled down to the rural masses. Pearson had gained his ﬁrst practical experience of civil engineering when only 21, on the main drainage of Southport. Diaz set him a bigger problem – the main drainage of Mexico City. Pearson solved it and seems to have gained Diaz’s respect by his honest dealing. Then throughout the 1900s he rebuilt the ramshackle railway across the Tehuantepec isthmus. Soon after starting work on this, in 1901, he was travelling from Mexico to New York on business and stopped overnight in Laredo, in Texas. There everyone was talking about Spindletop, a huge nearby oil discovery. Before the discovery surface oil pools had been observed and – the story goes – Pearson remembered seeing similar ones near the Tehuantepec railway. He telegraphed to J. C. Body, his trusted assistant, ‘to secure options . . . on . . . all land for miles around . . . move sharply’.19 Pearson’s involvement with oil had begun. During the 1900s Pearson acquired vast acreages of oil concessions elsewhere in Mexico. Subsoil rights in Mexico were not the property of the state so no royalties were payable to the government – a source of irritation to later nationalists. When Pearson did obtain state lands for oil exploration, as in Vera Cruz, the royalty was low. But Diaz’s argument was that foreign capital was needed and therefore it should be encouraged, not hindered. In this he was supported by most ‘advanced’ Mexican opinion.20 Letting civil engineering contracts or oil concessions to Pearson was to a large part a studied policy of not becoming too dependent on American capital. (Diaz is supposed to have once remarked: ‘Poor Mexico, so far from God and so close to the United States’).21 Because of this and because Pearson represented real competition in the oil market, American oil interests accused him of corruption. As noted, Pearson seems to have initially recommended himself to Diaz because of his honesty. The ﬁrm certainly greased the wheels once they were rolling, giving valuable objets d’art to members of Diaz’s government and subsidising favourable press coverage.22 But there was probably little chance of any progress in such a regime without some grease.\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n9\n\nFor many years, in fact, Pearson poured money into Mexican oil rather than sucking it out of the country. The Tehuantepec ﬁeld and other concessions were disappointing. By 1910 Pearson had a large share of Mexican sales and a sales organization in Britain, but was importing US oil to supply them. He had spent £5 million, a colossal sum. But in that year he ﬁnally struck lucky at Potrero de Llano, where the No. 4 well gushed at 100,000 barrels a day.23 By December 1918 it had yielded 100 million barrels of oil. Pearson perceived the importance of local involvement and was already reorganizing his subsidiary interests. Eventually his group included Mexican Eagle (El Aguila), in which Mexican interests were represented, and which controlled Mexican production and distribution; Eagle Tankers; and Anglo-Mexican which controlled the distribution of products outside Central America. Pearson’s qualities as a manager were evident in Anglo-Mexican which ‘was a model of a well-run oil company, and was markedly different in this respect from many of its British contemporaries’.24 It was a long way from Southport’s main sewer. Pearson’s problems were not over, however. In 1911 revolution broke out in Mexico and a period of chaos and civil war ensued, with Mexican Eagle’s oilﬁelds in the middle. Pearson’s earlier competition with American interests came back to haunt him. The American company was owned by Henry Clay Pierce, who instigated newspaper attacks on Pearson repeating the corruption allegations. When Woodrow Wilson took up the ofﬁce of President in February 1913, he immediately launched the USA into one of its periodic campaigns to export democracy – the intended target not being the Middle East, as 90 years later, but Central America and particularly the new Mexican dictator, Victoriano Huerta. Given his reputation in America, Pearson was inevitably a subsidiary target. His rascality in American eyes was exacerbated by the British government’s recognition of Huerta. This convinced Wilson that it, and Pearson, were in each other’s pockets, were propping up Huerta at the expense of other contenders for power, and were thus conspiring to thwart the Monroe Doctrine that European states should not intervene politically in the Americas. Wilson’s perception was fantasy. Far from supporting Pearson, the British government initially did nothing about attacks on Mexican Eagle’s properties precisely because it feared that a hostile US reaction might prevent the successful conclusion of negotiations over access to the Panama canal. El Aguila itself, like the American oil companies, was in reality taking sides as little as possible but trying to make the best of a bad job.25 The companies sometimes had to pay levies to armed groups who controlled the areas in which they worked, which fuelled suspicions that they were attempting to inﬂuence the outcome of the revolution. But as Alan Knight points out, ‘the companies did not ﬁnance revolutionary outbreaks; rather\n\n10\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nsuccessful revolutionaries won the right to extract cash from the companies’.26 Not surprisingly, by 1914 Pearson, now ennobled as Lord Cowdray, was thinking of selling his interest in Mexican Eagle and was starting to prospect for oil elsewhere. Joseph Schumpeter, an early twentieth-century economist whose writings on economic growth are still classics, attached great importance to the role of the entrepreneur. Schumpeter saw entrepreneurs not as the suppliers of money but as those with the energy and foresight to promote new technology, open up hitherto untouched or neglected natural resources, or exploit other economic discontinuities. They thus made it possible to reap proﬁts above the normal rate. This, in turn, promoted economic growth by attracting new capital to an industry. How far were the leading protagonists of the early British oil industry entrepreneurs in the Schumpeterian sense?27 D’Arcy was clearly a capitalist, as Drummond Wolff described him, in that he possessed wealth and took risks with it, rather than investing it cautiously as a mere rentier would do. His active role beyond that was very limited, however, and he hardly ﬁts the entrepreneurial model. Marcus Samuel was very different. He too started with wealth, but not nearly as much; and devising and implementing the tanker scheme required all the qualities of an entrepreneur – although he was assisted by others such as his brother Sam, who provided organizational input, and Fred Lane.28 Marcus Samuel’s failures which led Shell to the verge of bankruptcy are sometimes put down to his neglect of basic management. They can also be attributed to an excess of entrepreneurial zeal leading to overchartering of tankers, and other errors. Deterding, not British but playing a large part in the history of British oil, was above all an effective manager although the high stakes of the early oil world meant that no one could survive who could not also take risks, which Deterding did. Charles Greenway, managing director of APOC, was primarily a shrewd and unscrupulous negotiator – useful characteristics in the early oil industry, but hardly entrepreneurial. By far the greatest entrepreneur of all was Pearson. He had capital on D’Arcy’s scale but also entrepreneurial ability of a high calibre. He added to this greater managerial ability than Marcus Samuel as well as the famous Pearson luck – luck which he made, by his attention to detail and by never, even at the height of his spending, overreaching himself ﬁnancially. Pearson also exempliﬁed another of the traits Schumpeter discerned in entrepreneurs – that they were not primarily motivated by money. In the draft of a valedictory speech – he died before he could make it – Pearson wrote, ‘Success is sweet . . . but the joy is in the doing’.29 How far the early British oil industry was uniquely dependent on the entrepreneurial abilities of a few individuals is a question left until the end.\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n11\n\nGOVERNMENTS AND OIL It is easy to think of the British Empire at its peak as monolithic, and government attitudes to it as only shifting with political changes. In fact the Empire was diverse, ranging from the quasi-independent ‘White Dominions’ such as Canada and Australia, to tiny almost forgotten West Indian islands. After Joseph Chamberlain’s expansive imperialism came to grief in the Boer War, British governments reverted to the view that this diverse Empire, while of considerable economic and moral value, was also expensive and the potential source of unwanted foreign policy entanglements. Chamberlain’s campaign for tariff reform in the 1900s, whilst imperial, was also instrumental in keeping the Conservative party out of ofﬁce, thus reducing his inﬂuence still further. So after 1900 departmental views, always important, came once more to the forefront. The Colonial Ofﬁce, the India Ofﬁce, the Admiralty and the Foreign Ofﬁce, four departments which were all concerned with imperial policy or imperial defence, had different perspectives and the responsible ministers usually followed the departmental line unless political pressures were particularly strong. So far as there was a common view, it was that oil companies were commercial concerns and like other commercial concerns were out to make as much money as possible. Since governments took the capitalist order for granted, this was regarded as perfectly reasonable. But it did not mean that governments had a bias in favour of oil companies. Thus departmental and local attitudes became paramount, and these were more likely to be concerned with saving money or with beneﬁcial economic development than with oil companies’ welfare. Indeed oil companies, being regarded as proﬁt-maximizing concerns, were seen as fair game for bargaining over price or concessions. Some of these attitudes are illustrated by the history of Burmah Oil. Production rose gratifyingly after it had been set up in 1886 to develop deposits long known about and exploited in a small way by the Burmese. Parts of Burma were already British ruled and the rest had been appropriated by Britain after King Thibaw had been overthrown in 1885 (the appropriation had little or nothing to do with oil, and was more connected with fears of encroaching French inﬂuence).30 Burma came under the Government of India, which had considerable autonomy although it was ultimately responsible to the India Ofﬁce. Burmah Oil’s royalties were set relatively low and a small tariff on kerosene imported into India from elsewhere was established, in order to encourage oil development. But the company was not otherwise favoured. Its frequent requests for a higher tariff and the extension of its concession area were turned down as the Government of India wanted to encourage competition and keep down kerosene prices. However,\n\n12\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nanother department’s concerns were to provide an opening for Burmah. By 1904 the Admiralty’s growing interest in fuel oil led to concern about its supply, which at that time came from diverse sources including Anglo-American, Standard Oil’s British marketing ﬁrm. One of the Admiralty’s advisers, Boverton Redwood, argued strongly that it should buy oil from Burmah. Redwood was one of the leading ﬁgures of the early British oil industry, his consulting ﬁrm serving most of the oil companies at one time or another, as well as advising government departments. Described as ‘immaculately attired, with an orchid in his buttonhole, speaking in a slightly affected but impressive manner with a provincial accent’, he seems an unlikely oilman but in fact possessed genuine technical expertise and wrote a standard textbook on the industry.31 He also shared the standard assumptions of upper-middle-class Englishmen (and Scotsmen) about the desirability of imperial defence and therefore recommended that the Admiralty should establish an imperial source for some of its oil supply. The Admiralty accordingly supported Burmah in various ways in its less-than-harmonious relationship with the Government of India. The support, however, had only limited effect. Burmah secured an agreement that non-British oil companies should be excluded from Burmese oil concessions, but did not secure additional concessions itself. The Admiralty also supported Burmah in establishing a market-sharing agreement with Asiatic Petroleum, a joint Far Eastern marketing arm established by – then separate – Royal Dutch and Shell companies. The Government of India disliked this agreement as tending to raise prices but at that time, long before Ofﬁces of Fair Trading and the like, there was nothing it could do to prevent it, and so the Admiralty’s support for the agreement was really irrelevant. In return for the dubious value of Admiralty support, Burmah constructed reﬁnery and storage capacity for a substantial tonnage of fuel oil, which the Admiralty did not actually have to purchase. So although Burmah got its market-sharing agreement, it would have got this anyway and otherwise both the Admiralty and the Government of India emerged with more gains than losses.32 The reactions to APOC’s negotiations over selling fuel oil to the Admiralty were similar in their diversity but very different in their result. By 1912 the Admiralty’s future requirements for oil were set to increase sharply. And the question of another long-term supply contract was on the agenda. In the tortuous negotiations which followed Charles Greenway, APOC’s managing director, was one major player. Greenway’s apparently stuffy conservatism led to him becoming ‘Old Spats and Monocle’ in Upton Sinclair’s OIL!. But he proved wily and determined. The other key ﬁgure was Winston Churchill, and it was Churchill’s elevation to the Admiralty in 1911 which was the catalyst for the eventual agreement.33\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n13\n\nPersian oil was familiar to the British government. During the negotiations over the D’Arcy concession the Foreign Ofﬁce (FO) had given D’Arcy low-key support. The FO saw moderate British inﬂuence, in what was then a fragile and poor country surrounded by colonial powers, as the best policy. Excessive and overt attempts to wield inﬂuence would arouse the ire of Russia, Persia’s northern neighbour. This was anathema to the post-Boer War mindset which wished to avoid in Persia ‘any addition to our political or territorial responsibilities’.34 In 1912 the FO’s general principle was the same but the results were rather different. Relations with Russia were now friendlier, while APOC had become an established presence in Persia. It was changes to the existing state of affairs which might now involve instability. Changes would be even more deleterious, in the FO’s view, if they involved a foreign company gaining control of APOC’s oil. The ‘foreign company’ which seemed to present such a threat was the Shell group, which was of course more Dutch than British. And the reason the FO feared it was not just because of Dutch inﬂuence, but because Greenway had spent a great deal of time telling the British government of the threat which Shell posed.35 After the 1907 Royal Dutch/Shell merger, Shell had quickly become a European equivalent to Standard Oil in the demonology of those hostile to powerful oil companies. These comprised a surprisingly large grouping. There was a widespread belief – not entirely unjustiﬁed – that British companies in a range of industries were forming ‘trusts’ (the word in this context was imported from the USA) – that is making agreements or combining with the intention of raising prices. There were newspapers and car enthusiasts who were concerned about the price of petrol. They were a vociferous group even though only a small minority of the population owned cars. And there was a predictable sub-current of Edwardian anti-Semitism, allied with jingoism, which found Marcus Samuel an easy target. Unfortunately Samuel himself did not help. He frequently protested his patriotism and there is no doubt that this was entirely genuine. But he also became increasingly self-important, pompous and verbose, qualities which rubbed politicians and civil servants up the wrong way.36 Basil Henriques’ biography of Samuel was partly devoted to exposing the fancied injustices to Samuel, and Shell, stemming from the hostility to him (Henriques was married to Samuel’s granddaughter). In reality, Shell suffered much less from governmental slights than Henriques made out. Greenway’s campaign to persuade the government that the alternative to its ﬁnancial support for APOC would be Shell’s hegemony inﬂuenced the Foreign Ofﬁce but did not convince everyone. The India Ofﬁce was extremely cynical. It had experience of Shell’s ‘foreignness’ being raised before, also by Greenway when he represented Burmah Oil over their concession, at a time when Shell and Royal Dutch were\n\n14\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\njointly involved in Asiatic Petroleum. Burmah had then gone on to establish its own market-sharing agreement with Asiatic. So the Government of India was not inclined to help APOC out of its ﬁnancial plight, and gave the company no support in its attempts to sell fuel oil for use on Indian railways.37 Fortunately for APOC, it had support not just from the Foreign Ofﬁce – which was not actually in the market for oil – but also from the department which was, the Admiralty. This was not because the Admiralty had any particular animus against Shell. It bought some of its fuel oil, and by 1914 Churchill’s relations with Deterding were good. But in 1913, as the oil price rose and supplies became tight, the fruits of Churchill’s policy of pushing ahead strongly with oil-ﬁring were about to ripen in the form of ﬁve fast oil-ﬁred battleships. A long-term contract for oil, which Shell refused to offer, seemed essential, as Burmah’s capacity was too small and too remote to meet future needs.38 Churchill provided, again, the ﬁnal impetus to the British government shareholding in APOC. Churchill had earlier played an important role, as President of the Board of Trade, in some of the interventionist measures of the Liberal government, for instance in establishing labour exchanges and trade boards – bodies which set minimum wages in various industries which lacked strong trade unions. But although giving some precedent for intervention these and other Liberal measures were very different from taking a majority share in a private company, albeit at the company’s request. Almost certainly here Churchill’s own immense self-conviction, and his ability to convince others – even the aloof Asquith was fascinated by him – played an important part. More concretely, Churchill was able to argue that to support APOC was to support laissez-faire, since it would prevent a Shell/Standard of New Jersey duopoly in the British market.39 Thus in his ﬁnal speech to Parliament justifying the Act necessary to make the investment in APOC, Churchill once again used the ‘Shell menace’ as a major argument for the government shareholding. In reality, the Admiralty was relaxed about Shell and Churchill liked Deterding. But the ‘oil trust’ argument was too popular with MPs and the public for Churchill to miss.40\n\nOIL WORLDWIDE In 1915 Hermann More and Andrew Mearns, partners in an insurance broking ﬁrm, brought 200 shares in the Ural Caspian Oil Corporation. Hermann More, my grandfather, personiﬁes the cosmopolitan nature of British capitalism in the era before the First World War. He had emigrated from Germany in the late nineteenth century and set up an insurance brokerage in London. Subsequently\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n15\n\nhe became a British citizen and in 1909 changed his original surname. His and Mearns’ purchase of Ural Caspian shares illustrates this cosmopolitanism. British capital played a substantial part, not only in imperial oil development, but also in the development of oil in other far-ﬂung parts of the world. Its role was not surprising. By 1914 the value of British capital overseas, whether in the Empire or elsewhere, was around four billion pounds; equivalent, very roughly, to around 200 billion pounds, or 400 billion dollars, today.41 China’s much vaunted foreign reserves were around $1,700 billion in March 2008. But Britain’s population in the 1900s was around 40 million; China’s today is 1.3 billion. Some of Britain’s extraordinary wealth, the product of a hundred years of world leadership in trade and in key industries, was likely to ﬂow into oil. There is no precise ﬁgure for how much, since the nominal capital of oil companies quoted on stock markets was not always called up, while some of their investment was in tankers or distribution in Britain. One estimate is that, on the eve of the First World War, around 40 million pounds’ worth of British overseas investment was in oil. Of this perhaps one-third was in Russia.42 The history of this investment is not in itself remarkable. British ﬁrms did not pioneer the largescale extraction of Russian oil – this was done by the Nobels and the Rothschilds. The ﬁrms were not particularly well-directed, the smaller British oil companies indeed being notorious for their inefﬁciency. And by around 1912 much of the region’s production – including a holding in the Ural Caspian Corporation – was controlled by the Shell group. On the other hand, British companies opened up new and therefore riskier oil regions: Ural Caspian, for example, worked the remote Emba ﬁeld to the north of the Caspian Sea. Now its share certiﬁcate, worthless except for its collector’s value (not much as it is in poor condition) languishes in my desk.43 British companies also produced oil in other South American countries besides Mexico, the continent having long been a destination for British capital. The main operator was set up by a British trading house, Balfour Williamson. Such trading houses played a large part in the early oil industry, for instance acting as managing agents for APOC and Burmah. The Samuel brothers had themselves started as a trading house while another oil company in Burma, the Indo-Burma Petroleum Company, was run and owned by Steel Brothers, another trader. Balfour Williamson’s company, in Peru, had the delightful name of Lobitos. In the inter-war years it also established a small Ecuadorian oilﬁeld. Lobitos built a British reﬁnery and was, it seems, an efﬁcient little company. Fittingly, it was eventually taken over by Burmah, in 1962. Outside Peru and Ecuador, however, British exploration in South America came up against US hostility and political pressure. The target, predictably, was Pearson whose attempts to explore in\n\n16\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nColombia were stymied. Nearer to home, Royal Dutch/Shell had substantial interests in Romania, established by Royal Dutch before the merger.44 As in Mexico, the British government kept out of British companies’ adventures and misadventures in other South American countries and in Russia, even though US diplomacy had no hesitation in opposing British expansion in South America. Indirectly, the government did get involved in the affairs of companies which tried to exploit oil in the Empire. As in Burma, this involvement did not take the form of uncritically supporting the companies, but rather involved balancing various considerations, such as economic development in colonial territories and the Admiralty’s periodic obsession with British-controlled sources of supply. Thus when the development of Trinidad’s oil was under consideration in 1904, the Colonial Ofﬁce and the Admiralty established a joint committee. The government was also well aware of issues which would later exercise other governments dealing with oil companies, such as ensuring that companies actually worked their concessions. As was almost inevitable in imperial oil development at this time, the major players in Trinidad when interest hotted up in 1910 included Burmah, APOC and Shell. Burmah and APOC’s hypocrisy over Shell’s ‘foreignness’ and alleged monopolistic tendencies was exposed by the fact that all three had a share in the company most interested in Trinidad’s oil. Schooled by Burmah and APOC’s own propaganda, the Colonial Ofﬁce and Admiralty were at ﬁrst hostile to Shell involvement. But since it seemed that Trinidad’s oil industry would not be developed without Shell’s ﬁnancial backing, the Colonial Ofﬁce came to accept Shell on the basis that development was better than no development. Similarly the Admiralty, however much it wanted a British owned source of oil in Burma and Persia, would rather have some oil from Trinidad than none at all and also came round to accepting Shell. Pragmatism prevailed.45 It prevailed too in the prolonged negotiations over oil concessions in Mesopotamia – modern-day Iraq – then part of the Ottoman Empire whose core was Turkey. D’Arcy had become interested in the possibilities of Mesopotamian oil early on, but the negotiations were fruitless. In 1912 the pace became more rapid. A new consortium, the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) was established, linking Shell, the British-owned National Bank of Turkey and the Deutsche Bank. For no very good reason APOC saw this as a threat to its position in Persia, and Greenway predictably used it as part of his drum-beating about the ‘Shell menace’. As with Persia, the Foreign Ofﬁce seems to have been more inﬂuenced by this than were other government departments. But again, pragmatism and a desire to avoid rocking the diplomatic boat prevailed. The Foreign Ofﬁce accepted German involvement, thus reducing economic rivalry in the area. The National Bank of Turkey dropped out and a new division of the TPC was agreed\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n17\n\nin March 1914 giving APOC a 47.5 per cent share, with the rest divided between Shell, Deutsche Bank, and a ﬁxer and go-between, Calouste Gulbenkian, who became the legendary ‘Mr Five Percent’ – his share. As elsewhere, the British government put wider diplomatic consideration before support for ‘national champions’ while APOC came to terms with Shell when it suited it to do so.46 Since war broke out and oil was not yet discovered, the carefully contrived arrangements about Iraq soon broke down. As new claimants emerged, the tortuous search for agreement over the oil of that unhappy country was to resume even before the war was over.\n\nOIL IN THE FIRST WORLD WAR In February 1918 a small force of British troops toiled up a hill in north-western Persia. They were pushing their Model T Fords, for the road was too steep to drive. It was part of a route which was many centuries old: ‘the road from Persia to Babylon, the road trodden by the Medes and the Persians’. And at the top of the cliff which it was ascending, ‘on the rocky bare hillside of the Persian mountains, sat a youngster from the kindly Hampshire downs’.47 He was a soldier of the Hampshire regiment, and the route he was guarding was being taken by one of those exotic expeditions the First World War could surprisingly produce, associated as it is with mud, blood and trench-warfare. It was led by General Dunsterville, a boyhood friend of Rudyard Kipling and the ‘Stalky’ of Kipling’s stories, and it is Dunsterville himself who describes the scene in his book The Adventures of Dunsterforce. Dunsterforce had been formed to thwart the threat posed by the Turks and the Germans to the Caucasus, as the Russian armies melted away after the Bolshevik revolution. It had set off from Mesopotamia, modernday Iraq, and was aiming for the Caspian Sea via northern Persia. In the minds of the British there were many possible repercussions of the Germano-Turkish threat. Northern Persia would be disturbed and rebellious tribes might attack Tehran and overthrow the Persian government, with obvious implications for APOC’s oilﬁeld to the south. Further north, Turkey and Germany might occupy the ‘enormously valuable’ oilﬁelds of Baku and obtain the other foodstuffs and raw materials of the area.48 This did indeed occur, although not until September 1918, much too late in the war for them to be of any use. In the meantime Dunsterville had brought a brigade of troops into Baku via the Caspian Sea, and tried to organize a defence there before being forced to retreat. In the course of his travels he had bartered some of his Model T’s for petrol with the Bolsheviks, and allied himself with the Social Revolutionaries who held Baku.49\n\n18\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nThe east had lured the Germans since the beginning of the war. As with the Western Allies, they liked the idea of shortcuts which avoided the Western Front, while success in the east had the added advantage that it might undermine Russia. Depriving the Allies of oil or getting it themselves was a possible bonus, although not the main attraction. The British had reacted early on to the threat, sending an Indian division to Bahrain in October before Turkey entered the war.50 Subsequently the Turks attacked in the Caucasus, but were unsuccessful. And in early 1915, with the help of German military advisers, they mounted raids from Mesopotamia, then part of the Ottoman Empire, on the pipeline to Abadan. By now the British had pushed their forces up to Basra and Abadan itself and the raids, although they did some damage, were of no long-term signiﬁcance. Later in 1915 German intrigues in Persia were stymied by Russian military pressure from the north, while the British gradually, and after setbacks, occupied Mesopotamia.51 It was not until the Russian collapse that the threats in the east reasserted themselves. The early failure of these Germano-Turkish initiatives in Persia, and the later adventures of Dunsterforce, seem to illustrate Lord Curzon’s oft-quoted remark, in a speech to the Inter-Allied Petroleum Council just after the war had ended: the Allies had ‘ﬂoated to victory upon a wave of oil’.52 In this analysis it was the Allies’ access to oil supplies, and the Germans’ isolation from the centres of oil production, which turned the balance. The Allies undoubtedly had a vast superiority in oil supplies. The British naval blockade prevented Germany and Austria obtaining oil from the Americas, while after their failures in 1914–15 Middle Eastern and Russian oil was also inaccessible to the Central Powers, who were therefore cut off from 95 per cent of world production.53 But most countries used very little oil in 1914. Trains, barges and ships, all fuelled by coal, were the means of transport for bulk and long distance goods. In Europe, heating, industrial power, gas production and electricity generation were usually dependent on coal, of which Germany was the second largest European producer. Shortage of oil therefore posed no immediate threat to German civilian life and industrial production. But oil had become vital for the lubrication of machinery and for a few specialized military purposes, those for which the internal combustion engine was the only appropriate prime mover: aircraft, submarines, lorries and later in the war tanks. While Germany did not have much oil, it had access to a certain amount. Galicia in Poland, then ruled by Austria, produced substantial quantities. It was overrun by Russia early on, but regained in 1915. A more important producer was Romania. Romania was neutral until 1916 which meant that, at least in theory, it forbade the export of petrol and fuel oil to the Central Powers as these\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n19\n\nmight be used for military purposes, whilst allowing kerosene and gas oil exports. Certainly there were sharp cutbacks in production and the Central Powers could not depend on Romanian oil. In 1916 Romania entered the war on the Allied side, an ill-advised move since the Germans quickly occupied most of the country, capturing large stocks of oil. Most of the oil installations, however, were destroyed by the Allies. By the end of the war the Germans had restored about 75 per cent of production in Wallachia, the main oil-producing area. Once they had got production going again, therefore, the Central Powers had access to steadily increasing quantities of oil.54 Limited although German civilian use of oil was, shortages did affect it. In winter rural districts, lit by kerosene, had to stay in darkness while poor quality lubricants caused locomotives to freeze up.55 However, the Central Powers’ military operations do not seem to have been seriously affected. In the air, the Allies gradually got the upper hand but this seems more to do with overall industrial superiority and a technical lead in aircraft design. Nevertheless the German air force managed to virtually double its size – and its petrol allocation – between mid-1917 and early 1918. It had enough petrol to mount bombing raids on Britain, and subsequently on allied supply depots in France, in 1918.56 Tanks were a quite unimportant factor in military operations. A mass tank attack by the British – only the second in the war – marked the start of the Battle of Amiens in August 1918. The next day two-thirds of these tanks had broken down or become casualties. German slowness in the adoption of tanks seems to have been due not to problems in obtaining fuel but to a certain conservatism in the high command – a belief, often justiﬁed, that technological ﬁxes did not win battles. In the case of road transport, the German military had seen opportunities even before the war and had subsidized the civilian purchase of lorries. By 1913, 3,700 were available, half of which were usually occupied as beer delivery trucks.57 Not surprisingly most of them broke down when pressed into military service. The Allies subsequently took the lead in the use of road transport, although German usage seems to have been held back as much by shortages of rubber as of oil. And again, military conservatism played a part; even in the Second World War German generals remained wedded to horse transport except for armoured formations. Anyway, for most of the First World War motorized road transport was still peripheral to both sides. Once the front lines were ﬁxed, from late 1914, rail resumed its dominance in supply, with the regular railways supplemented on both sides by extensive light railways running almost up to the trenches. The ﬁnal important military use of oil was for diesel engines in submarines. Again, shortage of oil does not seem to have affected the German submarine offensive – which was, of course, ultimately unsuccessful. Indeed, its contribution\n\n20\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nto bringing America into the war suggests that Germany might have been better off without submarines. Naval warfare brings us to oil-ﬁring for steam powered vessels, the cause of Britain’s concern over oil supplies in the pre-war years. Its continuing supply was certainly vital to the wartime Royal Navy, which because of oil’s advantages was rapidly converting its vessels to burn it. But although oil conferred beneﬁts it was not critical to ﬁghting efﬁciency in the short distances involved in North Sea naval warfare. The German High Seas Fleet stayed in port for most of the war not because it was coal-ﬁred but because it dare not risk suffering a major defeat at the hands of Britain’s numerically superior Grand Fleet. One other military use for oil was in the production of toluene, the basis of trinitrotoluene (TNT), the main explosive in World War One. Toluene could be produced from oil and much has been made of Shell’s secret dismantling of its Dutch toluene plant and its re-erection in Britain – Holland, being neutral, would not sell arms or explosives to either side. Shell’s plant seems to have produced a large proportion of British toluene. But oil was not the only source for the stuff. The Germans produced it from coal and seem to have experienced no signiﬁcant problems in supply. Both sides mixed TNT with ammonium nitrate but German shells actually contained a higher proportion of TNT than the British, which may have made them more effective.58 The oil crisis for Germany came right at the end of the war, and it came from an unexpected direction. From 1915 the Allies had been engaged in what seemed for a long time a hopeless sideshow, an attack on Bulgaria – an ally of the Central Powers – via Greece. This rapidly became bogged down. But in the late summer of 1918, as the Germans withdrew troops from Bulgaria to shore up the Western Front, active warfare restarted and Bulgaria quickly collapsed. The Allies now had a route to Romania. The German high command estimated that, if Romanian oil was denied them, they would have to cease air and mechanized land warfare within two months.59 It seems likely that this was one factor in scaring the high command into its demands for an armistice. But there were many others. Germany had already experienced food and other material shortages, while it was being steadily forced back on the battleﬁelds. Historians still differ as to whether it was the shortages and the consequent problems on the home front, or military defeat, which should be given primacy in accounting for the German collapse. But all agree that the German army was in severe straits by the autumn of 1918. Oil was only a small factor in its immediate problems. Impending shortages of oil no doubt seriously worried the Germans, but by that time they had many other worries. Ultimately, indeed, the worries about Romanian oil had been caused by the Central Powers’ own military weakness, which caused them to lose Bulgaria and doubt their ability to defend Wallachia.60\n\nCOMING OF AGE: OIL 1900–18\n\n21\n\nOil was not yet critical to most aspects of warfare given the ruling technologies. And it is doubtful even if the war accelerated its subsequent peacetime use in Britain to any great extent. The development of motorized road transport was possibly advanced a little by the availability of cheap army lorries after the war, but it is hard to see this as of long-term signiﬁcance. Lorry engines still used petrol, with consequent penalties in fuel consumption. The most important development, diesels light enough to be used in lorries, did not come about until the 1930s. The war did, however, have an effect on the shape of the British oil industry. Shell remained pre-eminent among British, or partly British, companies. This was in spite of a determined and unscrupulous attempt by Greenway of APOC to undermine it. Depicting Shell as ‘unBritish’, Greenway’s favourite tactic, had particular resonance in wartime. His most egregious action was an attempt to break APOC’s marketing agreement with Shell, now thought to be unnecessary, by getting APOC’s production companies – legally separate entities – to sell their oil to a new company. APOC itself would therefore apparently be deprived of its crude and unable to sell it on to Shell.61 This piece of crookery was too blatant to gain government approval. But Shell was at ﬁrst vulnerable to attack over its part Dutch ownership and over the actions of various subsidiary companies, such as its Romanian subsidiary which was constrained to sell oil products to Germany. Eyre Crowe, a senior civil servant in the Foreign Ofﬁce, described Robert Waley Cohen, one of Shell’s top men, as a ‘slippery and dangerous person’, and this was typical of much comment in the privacy of internal government memoranda.62 In the end, however, Shell became perceived by the government and the public in a more favourable light. Marcus Samuel was super-patriotic while Henri Deterding was also strongly pro-Allied. His main residence had been in England since 1902 when Asiatic Petroleum, the ﬁrst joint venture between Royal Dutch and Shell, was established. It was actions, however, rather than Samuel’s words or Deterding’s place of residence which did most to change attitudes. Shell’s well-developed facilities made it essential in supplying the armed services’ oil requirements and it became the main supplier to both the British Expeditionary Force and the Royal Flying Corps, the antecedent of the RAF. Shell was not slow to use these facts in its advertisements, although their self-promotion was mitigated by the plaintive phrase, perhaps produced by Marcus Samuel, that ‘Quality tells more than calumny’.63 Pro-British it may have been, but the Shell group also made huge proﬁts during the war – so much so that, conscious of public opinion, it tried to hide their extent by accounting strategies such as accelerating depreciation. In fairness, however, the money was not made so much\n\n22\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nfrom directly supplying the Allied governments as from the high oil prices caused by the war, the proﬁts mainly being made in the group’s American and Far East operations.64 In spite of the failure of some of Greenway’s machinations, APOC gained even more from the war than Shell. In 1914 APOC was still loss-making; by 1918 it was making substantial proﬁts. Ironically, this was achieved even though most of its fuel oil and other products were not used for ships serving in British waters, as it was more economical in tanker tonnage to use American oil. But there was plenty of military and naval demand nearer to Persia, in particular because of the transport needs of the British Expeditionary Force in Mesopotamia. Equally important for the future, APOC had acquired its own marketing company and tanker ﬂeet, through the purchase of the British Petroleum Company (BP) and various associates. Before the war, BP had actually been owned by a German company, the Europaische Petroleum Union of Bremen. It distributed Shell products and had the largest share of the British market after Anglo-American, Standard Oil’s British subsidiary. After the outbreak of war the Public Trustee took control of German assets and APOC then lobbied to buy BP. In this case its argument that other outcomes – for instance a takeover by Standard Oil or Shell – would further reduce competition in the British market was obviously reasonable. It acquired BP in 1917, and Shell then set up its own marketing operation.65 The BP takeover had been preceded by a plethora of other schemes, mostly inspired by Greenway, to create a large British oil company involving APOC. Mexican Eagle, for instance, was one fancied participant in such a merger. Burmah was another, especially as that company was itself now leaning towards Shell.66 The schemes foundered on various rocks and by the end of the war the government, having come to view Shell in a more friendly light, was less inclined to listen to APOC’s propaganda. However, the issue of ‘national’ control of Britain’s oil supplies remained on the agenda. One reason for this was a nasty scare over oil in 1917. The direct cause was the German submarine campaign and the resulting increase in tanker sinkings, but indirectly it was related to the inadequate controls on consumption and the lack of coordination in supply matters. The problems were gradually sorted out but they ensured, as Curzon’s phrase shows, that oil remained prominent in the post-war government’s thinking.\n\n2\n\nThe World of Oil 1918–39\n\nGOVERNMENTS AND OIL COMPANIES: UNFINISHED BUSINESS In 1922 a tragic death brought to an end a political dynasty. The death was of Lewis (nicknamed Loulou), Viscount Harcourt, the son of William Harcourt who had been one of the contenders for the Liberal leadership after Gladstone’s resignation in the 1890s. The tragedy lay in its circumstances. There were suggestions that Harcourt committed suicide as his alleged habit of exposing himself to children threatened to become public. His death was also symbolic in the world of oil. He had been chairman of the grandly named Petroleum Imperial Policy Committee, known as the Harcourt Committee, set up towards the end of the war to establish what the government’s oil policy actually was. But by 1922 the fruits of the committee’s labours had failed to ripen and instead withered away. There were various reasons for this. Notwithstanding Curzon’s pronouncements about oil’s wartime importance, British government policy towards it remained a shifting sand. As before the war, there were different departmental views whilst politicians were inﬂuenced by the general climate of opinion, which was itself subject to change.1 Nevertheless for a time after the war, which had seen a huge increase in government intervention in many areas of life, there was still a widespread belief in the potential beneﬁts of such intervention. For instance, various programmes were started to ﬁnd alternatives to petroleum, one possibility being alcohol produced from vegetable matter – a forerunner of today’s biofuels. To that end two acres of Jerusalem artichokes were planted in Dorset. A more important initiative was a prolonged effort to achieve a ‘national’ oil company such as Greenway of APOC had mooted during the war. However, with the wartime rapprochement between\n\n24\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nthe government and Shell, it was the latter company which was now at the centre of the government’s thoughts. The main agency was the Harcourt Committee, and in January 1919 Harcourt and Deterding initialled an agreement by which British interests would acquire majority control over Royal Dutch/Shell, while the group’s operating companies would become predominantly British registered and have government nominees on their boards. Shell would therefore become a ‘national’ company and would be the centrepiece of the government’s policy.2 However, the Harcourt-Deterding agreement was never ratiﬁed and ﬁnally faded away. Shell had had its own motives for the agreement. With oil apparently now as much a matter of geopolitics as a commercial affair, it had hoped to enlist the British government’s support in various theatres of operation, particularly Romania, Russia and the Middle East. But the government’s contradictory policy towards the third region, discussed later, eventually deterred it. The scheme for greater government inﬂuence was then replaced by another – for less. In this, there would be a gigantic three-way merger between Shell, Burmah and APOC. It would still produce a national company, because British interests would predominate, but the government would sell its interest in APOC.3 The rapid change in the government’s attitude, both towards its involvement in general and towards APOC in particular, came about for two reasons. Firstly because APOC, once the star, was now seen as badly managed and in urgent need of a shake-up. Secondly because of a wider disenchantment with government intervention. The majority of MPs in the Coalition government which ruled from 1918–22 were Conservative, and after a while the government’s muniﬁcence with public money began to gall on them. This chimed in with the inclinations of the Treasury. In spite of economies, the government’s ﬁnancial commitments were far greater than before the war, while the Treasury was beginning to reassert its traditional role as keeper of the nation’s purse-strings. APOC’s continued expansion was a concern because it might lead the company to call for further state subventions. So getting rid of the state’s shareholding via the merger proposal was seen as a blessing. At the same time, the dream of a national company would still be realized. The issue sputtered on until the Labour government of 1924 when the amalgamation proposals were ﬁnally put to rest. The government therefore remained the majority shareholder in APOC. This conclusion has been seen as an early assertion of Labour’s belief in nationalization but Geoffrey Jones argues that it was not. The government directors had rarely interfered with APOC’s running and continued to refrain from so doing. The decision to drop the merger was essentially a reassertion of the status quo and came about through pressure from the Admiralty. Even though they had drawn little oil from Persia during the war, in peacetime conditions they\n\nT H E WO R L D O F O I L 1 9 1 8 – 3 9\n\n25\n\ncould do so and the contract with APOC seemed very good value for money. In the absence of a strong push from anyone else, their desire to keep APOC independent overrode other factors. Within the government, departmental politics had once more become the arena in which issues were decided, and any notion of a uniﬁed oil policy went by the board.4 Marcus Samuel had retired and to the hard-headed realists who now dominated Shell the idea of a ‘national’ oil company had always been subservient to the beneﬁts of reducing costs and increasing proﬁt margins. Initially the ‘national’ company had seemed good for Shell but they had come to believe that other forms of cooperation could replace a formal merger. The British ones among them were not unpatriotic, and Deterding was pro-British, but the idea that a national oil company would actually beneﬁt Britain in any tangible way had never been their way of thinking about it. A national company could not guarantee the supply of oil so long as that was imported. The only guarantee in those circumstances was seapower. Robert Waley Cohen’s comment of 1923 sums up Shell’s attitude. ‘The whole question of control was very largely nonsense. It is a matter of sentiment, but if by transferring control to the Hottentots we could increase our security and our dividends I don’t believe any of us would hesitate for long.’5 The government also had to take decisions about its course of action in the international world of oil. Before the war it had already come up against the American belief that European powers should not interfere in Latin America (see Chapter 1, ‘Entrepreneurs in oil’). But the Foreign Ofﬁce had constantly downplayed diplomatic resistance to the United States. Ultimately wider diplomatic considerations – basically keeping on good terms with the USA – were more important than the affairs of oil companies. After the war the perceived importance of oil initially led the government to concern itself much more with British oil interests overseas and Britain in this period has been credited with ‘recognising the need to evolve a coherent oil policy and attempting to operate one’.6 It is true that, for a time during and after the war, the government showed some consistency in following Harcourt’s precept of 1918 that ‘it is absolutely vital to the British Empire to get a ﬁrm hold of all possible sources of petroleum supply . . .’.7 Purchasing the APOC shareholding in 1914 could be seen as the ﬁrst step towards this end, and the negotiations with Shell as part of it. But, as Geoffrey Jones has argued, the fact is that even in those few years policy was hardly coherent.8 And as the 1920s wore on and the perceived need to mollify the United States became paramount, Harcourt’s stated aim bore less and less resemblance the one that was actually followed. American interest in foreign oil was underpinned by a number of factors. The\n\n26\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nlong-standing belief that Latin America was in the US sphere of inﬂuence was one. But more important was a fear – short-lived but intense while it lasted – in the United States that its oil was running out. Looking around the world, it saw a large proportion of potential oil supplies under the surface of the British Empire. And the Empire limited foreign companies’ access in various ways, for instance by ‘British control’ clauses applicable to leases on Crown lands. On the other hand, the US itself allowed foreign-owned companies – notably Shell – to exploit its own oil, although it had powers to deny access to government lands if it felt that reciprocity was not forthcoming.9 It was not surprising, therefore, that American oilmen and diplomats started to look further aﬁeld than the Americas for oil supplies. American initiatives reached their peak soon after the war when they negotiated their way into the Turkish Petroleum Company; but even after the US had recovered from its fear of imminent oil depletion, and indeed was suffering from over-production, they put strong pressure on Britain to allow American ﬁrms into the British controlled areas of the Middle East. These initiatives are discussed in the next section. The British took the view that, morally, the Americans did not have much of a claim to the rest of the world’s oil given that they were far and away the largest producers. But good relations with the US ultimately took priority and Britain consistently gave way.10\n\nGOVERNMENTS AND OIL COMPANIES: THE MIDDLE EAST Today the term ‘Middle East’ is almost inseparable from oil. The juxtaposition is apt, for while the region is one of the cradles of civilization, the commonly used name for it dates back only to 1902 and was little used until the First World War. It was popularized in Britain in 1916 when Lloyd George, always on the look out for some escape route from the stalemate on the Western Front, turned his attention to renewing attempts to knock the Ottoman Empire out of the war. The ‘Middle East’, almost coterminous with the Ottoman Empire with the exception of Turkey itself, became a term which could embody ‘a revived nationalised landscape between East and West, that was to be free of Oriental despotism and [which] would achieve redemption under Allied protection’. But, as a radical turned imperialist, Lloyd George was not just concerned with nationalism but perceived the area as vital for another Empire – the British. These different aims were, of course, impossible to bring into harmony and attempts to realize them were to bedevil the region in the future as well as complicating oil policy at the time.11 At the end of the war, however, hardly any oil had been discovered in the Middle East or was even suspected, and therefore in most parts of the region there\n\nT H E WO R L D O F O I L 1 9 1 8 – 3 9\n\n27\n\nwas no reason to consider it at all. In Persia, of course, oil had been discovered, but Persia was not then a signiﬁcant political actor in the region. Within Persia itself, nationalism was stirring but in the years immediately after the war APOC and British inﬂuence seemed well established. And in Mesopotamia, shortly to become Iraq, the existence of oil was suspected and will be discussed below. But elsewhere, and to a large extent in Iraq too, what inﬂuenced government thinking was a whole nexus of factors. Safeguarding the Suez Canal, the main route to India, was a major concern as it had been for many years. Trying to honour some of the numerous and incompatible promises and agreements Britain had made to and with Arabs, Jews and the French during the war was another. More altruistically, honouring the fact that Iraq was a League of Nations mandate and not a site for the exercise of British privilege was a third.12 Mesopotamia had been part of the Ottoman Empire and therefore had been in the concession area of the pre-war Turkish Petroleum Company (TPC) mentioned in Chapter 1. Greenway, who had muscled APOC into the TPC consortium before the war, predictably tried to use the ‘Shell menace’ to take it over during the conﬂict but, as with his other wartime attacks on Shell, overreached himself and was rebuffed by the government.13 After the war, all concession arrangements were thrown into the melting pot. The TPC (as its name remained until 1929) focused on renegotiating a concession with Iraq, which had been separated from Turkey after the war and made a League of Nations mandate. The mandated power, in this case Britain, had only limited rights and was expected to develop the country to a position where it could become independent. It was also expected to maintain an ‘Open Door’ policy – in other words not to favour its own nationals or companies. Negotiations involving the TPC had a number of threads. First, there was Shell’s role. If the Harcourt-Deterding agreement was brought to fruition, Shell would obtain dominance of the TPC and government support in restarting the concession negotiations. From the government’s point of view, in the immediate ﬂush of victory it considered that it could make arrangements about the concession more or less as it pleased. The only non-British interest it initially considered was the French. The Sykes-Picot agreement of 1916, one of the contradictory agreements which bedevilled the post-war Middle East, had assigned post-war spheres of inﬂuence to Britain and France. France’s included Mosul, in the north of Mesopotamia and the area thought most likely to yield oil. So after the war, promises were made to cut the French in on the TPC, the French in return waiving their political claims in the area. However, the habit of assuming that the victors could simply divide the spoils was the subject of a warning by Balfour, the Foreign Secretary, to his colleagues in September 1919. Balfour accepted that\n\n28\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nthe Open Door policy had to be taken seriously. The warning only had limited effect but shows that the internationalism of the League of Nations was beginning to have some impact.14 Policies were further confused because Lloyd George tended to negotiate independently of the Foreign Ofﬁce, leading in 1919–20 to a saga of Franco-British agreements, cancellations and renegotiations. These were further complicated by Lloyd George’s decision in early 1920 to give the British state the rights to Iraqi oil, if it existed. This occurred at a time when there had been a brief recrudescence of anti-oil trust sentiment in Britain. Lloyd George was therefore favouring domestic radicalism – hostility to trusts – over the internationalism of the League of Nations – the Open Door. However, this was the high-water mark of the post-war Coalition government’s desire to intervene in almost everything. Anglo-French accord was ﬁnally reached in the San Remo agreement of April 1920, which gave British and French interests primacy in the planned exploitation of oil in Iraq and put the issue of state or private control to one side. While this shows that a colonial mentality, rather than a full acceptance of the spirit of the mandate, was still at work, there was provision in the agreement for an Iraqi shareholding in the TPC.15 So far, therefore, some threads had proved to be permanent and others had unravelled. Involvement by the British state was soon forgotten, and the TPC remained a multinational consortium, with Shell, APOC and French interests represented. There was, however, some acceptance of the mandated power’s duty to its mandate. From Shell’s point of view, the British government’s constant reversals of policy had helped to wean it off the idea of becoming a ‘national’ company in which the government participated, and had therefore helped to end the Harcourt-Deterding agreement. Now another thread was inserted. As noted in the previous section, the Americans had become interested in oil outside the Americas, and this led to American demands to be included in the TPC. They could, of course, use the Open Door principle to underpin their demand. Effectively this was agreed by the consortium in 1923, although it was only in 1928 that a split of 23.75 per cent to each of the four main participants (the French, several American companies in a mini-consortium of their own, APOC and Shell) and the remaining 5 per cent to Calouste Gulbenkian was ﬁnally settled.16 The Iraqi government, of course, lost out because it agreed a concession with the TPC, in 1925, without getting a shareholding. But although this suggests a degree of international ruthlessness at odds with the mandate principle, the Iraqis had effectively had autonomy in the negotiations and little British government pressure was put on them. To Colonial Ofﬁce demands for pressure, the Foreign\n\nT H E WO R L D O F O I L 1 9 1 8 – 3 9\n\n29\n\nOfﬁce countered that, ‘if the Irak [sic] Government refuses to fall in with our views, I do not see how we can force them to grant a concession to the TPC’. The Iraqis probably foresaw some political advantages from settling when they did and to that extent Britain’s ultimate control of Iraq was a factor. But, apart from the shareholding issue, the agreement otherwise was quite favourable to the host country by the standards of the time.17 Oil had still not been found at the time the concession was granted. On October 15th 1927 the Baba Gurgur No 1 well near Kirkuk, in the north, was discovered. In productive oilﬁelds the oil is often under pressure, and this was the case here. The well was a ‘gusher’, shooting oil 50 feet into the air and producing almost 100,000 barrels a day which drenched the surrounding countryside before the well was capped. The ﬁeld was then developed and linked to the Mediterranean by two pipelines, one running across Syria and Lebanon and the other across Jordan (then Transjordan) and Palestine. All were mandates carved out of the Ottoman Empire, the ﬁrst two French, the second two British. The national interests at work are obvious. Iraq became a signiﬁcant producer, with an output of ﬁve million tons in 1938, compared to Persia’s ten million.18 The process of expanding Persian production to this level had not been without hiccups. From 1906 the Shah was head of a nominally constitutional government, but the central authorities remained weak and local leaders strong. It was only by keeping on good terms with the latter that APOC had been able to carry out its earlier explorations. Furthermore the payment of royalties calculated on a share of the proﬁts was fraught with difﬁculties. Did these, for example, include proﬁts made by the company outside Persia? An agreement which was intended to clarify such issues was made in 1920 but was repudiated by the Persian government in 1928.19 Before that happened Persia had been set on an entirely new course. Riza Khan, a colonel, emerged as the effective ruler in 1921, although it was only in 1925 that the old dynasty was overthrown and he became Shah, founding the Pahlavi dynasty. With his accession to the throne, the country became known as Iran. Riza Shah, as he became, was energetic and autocratic, and determined to strengthen the central government’s powers and develop the country. To do this he needed money and the oil royalties were an obvious potential source. After the repudiation of the 1920 agreement with APOC a series of negotiations over revising the terms of the concession took place. Settlement was constantly delayed by Iranian second thoughts, and meanwhile crude oil prices fell as the world depression took hold from 1929. In the 1920s falling prices had been compensated for by rising sales. But from 1929 sales were also falling and the result was dramatically reduced proﬁts, and royalties, when the Shah expected\n\n30\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\nincreases. In November 1932 his patience snapped. Calling for the ﬁle on oil negotiations, he had it ﬂung on a stove and cancelled the D’Arcy concession.20 After years of delays, settlement was surprisingly swift. The British government was determined to be ﬁrm, and immediately appealed to the League of Nations on the grounds that the cancellation was illegal, the concession having been for 60 years. Edward Benes, the Czechoslovakian Foreign Secretary, was bought in by the League to mediate. He made the sensible suggestion that proceedings before the League would be suspended until May and in the meantime negotiations should be resumed. This concentrated minds and by April 1933 a new agreement had been reached. At the critical meeting, the Shah himself presided. He ‘gave a little homily to his ministers, who, he said, were down on the ground and could not see very far beyond their noses, whilst he was placed on a pinnacle and could see the great world around him . . .’. Since the Shah appeared from his role in these negotiations to be quite favourably inclined towards APOC, it is possible that the earlier failure to settle occurred because his ministers were too scared to bring before him a settlement which they wrongly thought he would not accept. On the other hand, he might have been frightened by the British government’s ﬁrm stance.21 The new agreement was based on a per ton royalty rate, as was common elsewhere, and an Iranian share of APOC’s dividends. For a time the new arrangements combined with economic recovery and rising production to boost royalties. But in 1938, with depression temporarily returning, royalties fell and further friction threatened. The Shah was molliﬁed by the promise of export credits from Britain, but the Iranian expectation of ever-increasing revenue was clearly still a potential problem for the company. In 1935 one further change, of great symbolic importance to Iran, occurred. APOC renamed itself the AngloIranian Oil Corporation (AIOC). When the negotiations over the ﬁnal allocation of shares in the TPC were being concluded in 1928, the story goes, Gulbenkian sat down with a map of the Middle East and drew a red line around the old boundaries of the Ottoman Empire. The line encircled most of the Middle East as we know it today, with a few exceptions such as Persia and Kuwait; the latter had long been independent although a British protectorate. Within this area the members of the TPC would not compete against each other in concession negotiations. This was the famous Red Line Agreement. Sadly Gulbenkian’s story is romanticized, and the details were prosaically decided between the British and French governments.22 At about the same time oil companies began to be interested in other Middle Eastern countries. Interest was fostered by an itinerant New Zealand born mining engineer, Frank Holmes, who had been touting the possibilities of oil in\n\nT H E WO R L D O F O I L 1 9 1 8 – 3 9\n\n31\n\nthe region since the early 1920s. Holmes was a ‘rover in the world of oil’ in one sceptical British ofﬁcial’s opinion.23 As with the early days of the oil industry in America, there were a number of such characters in the inter-war Middle East. Since companies outside the TPC – including a number of American ones – were not included in the Red Line Agreement, the TPC still faced competition to exploit these possibilities. Standard Oil of California (Socal), one such non-TPC company, secured concessions in Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia had emerged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire as an independent kingdom. Bahrain, never in the Empire, was a British protectorate. The TPC, which became the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) in 1929, was not actually very interested in either of the two countries. Its view was formed by APOC’s chief geologist who, in one of the bigger misjudgements in history, had written off Arabia as an oil region. Nonetheless the British government hoped to retain exploitation in British hands and at ﬁrst resisted Socal’s bid in Bahrain. It quickly gave way, contenting itself with the ﬁgleaf of Socal registering its interest through a Canadian subsidiary.24 Even when oil was struck in Bahrain in 1932 the IPC remained sceptical about Saudi Arabia, but like a dog in a manger was prepared to enter the bidding for a concession there in order to discourage others. The Saudi King, Ibn Saud, was desperate for cash, because the depression had cut the number of pilgrims to Mecca, at that time the country’s main source of foreign currency. A deal with Socal was brokered by another rover in the world of oil, Harry St John Philby. Philby, known as Jack and best remembered as the father of the Soviet agent, Kim, had been in the Indian Civil Service (ICS) where he learnt Arabic, since the Government of India took responsibility for British affairs in the Persian Gulf. He developed a strong afﬁnity for the Arab world and Arab life, as did other middleclass Englishmen in that period such as T. E. Lawrence. Disliking British policy in the Middle East, Philby resigned from the ICS in 1925 and set up a trading company in Saudi Arabia, where he converted to Islam. He enjoyed twisting his compatriots’ tails, so helping to set up Socal’s concession and do down the IPC was a satisfying exercise. As in Bahrain, oil was struck before the Second World War but production at ﬁrst remained limited. This was partly because Socal lacked distribution arrangements in the eastern hemisphere until a tie-up with Texas Oil in 1936 produced a new consortium, Caltex.25 APOC took some interest in Kuwait, also under British protection, which was outside the Red Line area. Holmes had also been interested in oil here and persuaded Gulf Oil, another American company (named after the Gulf of Mexico not the Persian Gulf) to bid for a concession. But as with Bahrain the British government wanted to enforce a British nationality clause in Kuwait, and this\n\n32\n\nBLACK GOLD\n\ntime its defence was more vigorous. Gulf seemed to be excluded. Meanwhile APOC decided there was no oil there and, as a result of the government’s attitude, was conﬁdent that no one was going to be able to exploit the country even if oil was found. In 1932 it was about to drop its interest when Britain bowed to US government pressure and dropped the nationality requirement. APOC, true to its policy of spoiling the party for everyone else if possible, renewed its interest. With two competitors, the Shaikh of Kuwait prepared to bid up the price. Gulf and APOC therefore merged their interests in another consortium and secured the concession. APOC was spectacularly wrong again. Oil was struck in Kuwait in 1938 although development was suspended during the war.26 The IPC consortium model had therefore become common in the Middle East. The IPC itself in the 1930s negotiated concessions in other small coastal states on the Gulf. In 1939 they discovered oil in Qatar, although again development was suspended during the war. In spite of the steady increase in oil exploration in the Middle East, the British government remained broadly neutral in its attitude towards British oil companies and their concessions, and concession-hunting, in the area. Certain key interests were asserted, but in a low-key way. In Iraq, Lloyd George’s initial enthusiasm was cooled by time, diplomacy and the growing constraints on his government’s initial activism. From the early 1920s Britain became anxious not to be seen to interfere in the concession negotiations, although in the 1930s it did secure one branch of the Iraq-Mediterranean pipeline for British-controlled territory. And in 1932 complete independence was granted to Iraq, albeit with a treaty giving the British military bases in the country. By contrast Egypt, which in many ways had a better claim to independence, remained ﬁrmly under British suzerainty. The Suez Canal was far more important to Britain than retaining control of an oilﬁeld. In Iran Britain did hold ﬁrm over contract renegotiations – but within the context of the League of Nations, not by exercising gunboat diplomacy. In other instances it left British or partly-British ﬁrms and consortia to fend for themselves, giving minimal support in Bahrain and Kuwait before retreating in the face of American pressure.27\n\nMAGNATES AND CAUDILLOS The ﬁrst page of Eric Ambler’s marvellous 1937 thriller, Uncommon Danger, introduces the reader to an oil magnate. The magnate is Joseph Balterghen, the chairman of Pan-Eurasian Petroleum, and over the next few pages he is shown planning to suborn Romanian politicians in order to obtain the revision of an oil\n\nT H E WO R L D O F O I L 1 9 1 8 – 3 9\n\n33\n\nconcession in Pan-Eurasian’s favour. As the book unfolds, it becomes clear that Balterghen is prepared to employ agents who will use any methods, including murder. Their efforts are thwarted, however, by the alliance of a journalist, Kenton, and two Russian agents, Andreas Zaleshoff and his beautiful sister Tamara.28 Ambler’s novel was a classic representation of the Popular Front view of international capitalism, itself derived from pre-1914 radicalism seasoned with a strong dash of pro-Sovietism. As Kenton reﬂects: It was the power of Business, not the deliberations of statesmen, that shaped the destinies of nations. The Foreign Ministries of the great powers might make the actual declarations of their Government’s policies; but it was the Big Business men, the bankers and their dependents, the arms manufacturers, the oil companies, the big industrialists, who determined what those policies should be.29\n\nBalterghen himself seems to contain elements of both Gulbenkian and Deterding. He is Armenian by birth, like Gulbenkian. His sexual appetites are not detailed but, if they had replicated Gulbenkian’s, they might have been unsuitable for a 1930s novel; Gulbenkian always had several mistresses on the go, one of whom had to be under 18 ‘on medical advice’. Like Deterding, however, Balterghen is a professional manager not just a Gulbenkian-like ﬁxer and like Shell, PanEurasian has interests in Venezuela, Mexico and the Middle East as well as Romania. Balterghen’s politics, it can be inferred, would also have been close to Deterding’s. Deterding had been strongly pro-British in the First World War but subsequently he became increasingly right-wing.
