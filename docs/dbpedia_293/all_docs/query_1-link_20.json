        "text": "This introduction performs three functions. It provides a historiography within which to site company magazines in Britain and United States between 1880-1940, it briefly examines the history and functions of these journals and it summarizes the articles found in this special edition. In relation to historiography, it argues that while research on the subject is sparse, the study of company magazines should be located in a much wider field of historical literature, which encompasses business history, media history, the history of industrial welfare and more recent writing on corporate identity and the history of organizational public relations. In relation to the history and roles of company journals, one can point to the period 1880-1914 where the company magazine was employee originated, aimed at only a section of the workforce and amateurish in character, and to 1914-1918 where journals became widespread, corporate and more professional. The roles of magazines are divided into the operational and the strategic. The former consisted of education, dissemination of information and entertainment.The strategic roles of the company journal were associated with corporate identity, corporate culture and organizational power. Themes outlined in this introduction in terms of the historiography, history and roles and functions of company magazines are dealt with in more detail in the articles of this special edition.\n\nThis article analyzes the emergence of public relations among corporations in interwar Britain. It adopts a discursive approach and applies the philosophy of Michel Foucault. It argues that public relations was a result of state propaganda during World War I, the emergence of a mass-media society, and criticism from a range of groups toward corporations during the period. It acted as an emergent institutional text, which taught corporations how to create corporate identities so as to garner public good will and institutional legitimacy. This was achieved by a range of strategies, including social programs and the creation of corporate narratives.\n\nIn the 1930s, the General Post Office (GPO) in Britain became one of the nation’s most innovative pioneers of marketing communication. Following criticism of the organisation in the 1920s for its conservative use of publicity, the GPO embarked upon a series of creative publicity campaigns that applied, amongst other methods, advertising, public relations, promotions, cinema, events and artistic posters. Through an overview of its publicity, and through a narrative of three case-studies, this article argues that one of the most important innovations of the GPO was its integration of marketing communication, both in terms of techniques used and in relation to its emphasis on promoting the organisations and the services it provided.\n\nPurpose This paper aims to examine the development of an iconic corporate brand by the General Post Office (GPO) in Britain in the 1930s by adapting the work of Douglas Holt (2004). Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a historical approach by developing a historical case study. It combines this historical approach with Holt’s theory and writing on iconic branding and the current literature on corporate identity, corporate branding and corporate communication. Findings The study argues that the GPO was able to construct an iconic brand in the interwar period (1918-1939) by responding to anxieties in British society generated by social tension and fears of decline. This was facilitated by the establishment of a public relations department, which created “myths” of national identity and imperial unity through telecommunications, and national strength through technology. These myths assuaged social anxieties and enabled the GPO to construct an iconic corporate brand. Originality/value This paper provides an important insight into iconic branding. It examines corporate rather than product branding, where research has predominantly focused. It also combines cultural branding theory with historical analysis and provides an adapted approach to Holt’s myth market model (1994, p. 58).\n\nWork and the living conditions and everyday lives of workers have been central themes for documentary film in Europe and the United States since the 1930s. The founding father of the British documentary movement, John Grierson, inspired a documentary form with a focus on improving the position of the working class in Britain. Historically, this project was connected with the nation-state and the move toward a welfare society with more equality and democracy. But in the post-1945 period, and especially with the increased globalization of nation-states and society in general, we see a new tendency in European and US documentaries addressing the various global challenges. The nation-state dimension is not disappearing as such, but a number of European documentaries take on a more global outlook in their approach to documenting work. These documentaries represent a broader global horizon and mentality in the modern European documentary movement. This chapter deals with European documentaries representing different stages in the treatment of work and workers before the advent of the welfare society, through an increasingly critical look at the modern welfare state and toward a globally oriented contextualization of this social project. The chapter illustrates how a global agenda is reflected in Western European documentaries made in a few countries, but representing a wider trend in other countries."
