        "text": "English chemist George Fownes who died Today in 1849 was famous for, amongst other things, the discovery of Benzoline in 1845 later used as a motor spirit, a petroleum spirit, marketed under various trade names such as National Benzole Mixture and Regent Benzole Mixture. (1)\n\nBenzol(e) in the UK was crude Benzene derived from coal tar products mainly from Benzene and Toluene and was said to increase motor performance.\n\nFownes worked in his father’s glove business up to 1837 before studying science with Thomas Everitt and lecturing in chemistry at Middlesex Hospital.\n\nDying young from consumption (TB) he was to do his major work between 1842-6 when he isolated two new organic bases in 1845 by preparing Furfural by the action of Sulfuric Acid on Bran, and isolating Benzoline (hydro-benzamide from oil of bitter almonds.(2)\n\nNational Benzole was founded in February 1919 in a room next to the boiler house of the Gas, Light and Coke Company Ltd in Horseferry Road, London.\n\nIt was found to be useful in propelling shells in WWI and post war there was a ‘Benzole Lake’ which Samuel Henshaw, Chairman of Staffordshire Chemical Company saw there was money to be made from the surplus.\n\nHowever by the 1950s Benzole was determined a health hazard and its ‘anti-knocking’ properties were superseded by lead petrol additives (another health hazard) and from the 1960s, the now re-branded National Company only sold petrol after being bought by BP, only to become defunct in early 1990s.\n\nNOTES:\n\nBenzoline also known as Petroleum Ether was a Petroleum Fraction consisted of Aliphatic (non-aromatic) Hydro-Carbon with a Boiling Point netween 35-60 (c) is now used as a laboratory solvent. It is not classed as an Ether but described thus owing to its lightness and volatility.\n\nConfusingly in many countries Benzoline has many alternative names.\n\n(1) He became Thomas Graham’s assistant at London University and also discovered Farfurine.\n\n(2) In 1839 he accurately determined the equivalent weight of carbon by means of combustion of Naphthaline. In 1844 he discovered the presence of Phosphate in igneous rocks, the original source of Phosphates in clay and soil.\n\nReferences/Pics.\n\nMotor Sport Magazine Pics.\n\nencyclopedia.com/science.\n\namazon.co.uk.\n\neducalingo.com.\n\nGraces Guide.\n\nAlamy Stock Photos.\n\nPicClick.uk.1950s.\n\n‘If winter comes can spring be far behind’?: Ode to West Wind, Shelley.\n\nIn 1947 ‘Starve with Strachey’ and ‘Shiver with Shinwell’, was a Tory slogan of the time regarding the big freeze for Today in 1947 when the temperature in London fell to the coldest for half a century, a situation made worse by power cuts. (1)\n\nA few days before a Daily Telegraph headline reported: ‘Snow Falls in London’, which was the first glimpse of Britain’s worst winter of the 20th century when snow was to fall every day until 16th March and when the sea froze at Margate and in London temperatures went down to 16°(f), -9o (c).\n\nThe war-dilapidated railways had frozen points and hampered by 20-foot drifts, couldn’t move the coal, power stations began to run out of fuel, resulting in ‘load sheading’. Prime Minister Clement Attlee went on the radio to announce, ‘an emergency of the utmost gravity’ and appealed to everyone to economise.\n\nFactories closed down, people went to bed for warmth and with Britain exhausted after the war coal supplies were low, shop-shelves empty and government coffers likewise. The pits, now in public ownership, along with the railways, road haulage and public utilities were perilously close to collapse.\n\nSo much snow fell that by the end of January hundreds of villages were cut-off by 20ft snowdrifts and a 12 hour blizzard off the south coast brought shipping to a halt. The rail network collapsed as engines couldn’t move. By February coal boats were stranded in the north, roads were impassable, power stations, factories and homes were without coal.\n\nOn February 7th Emanuel Shinwell, the Minister of Fuel and Power was forced to announce drastic measures. Power to industries was cut off; houses had to switch off all electricity between 9am and midday and again from 2.0pm and 4.0pm. The incipient television service was suspended; streets were plunged into darkness; newspapers shrunk to a war-time four pages.\n\nSo dark were the skies that Kew recorded no sunshine at all between the 2nd and the 22nd of February. Birds froze in the trees. One eyewitness said it was if the earth had shifted its axis. By early February there was no power in the South and Midlands and two million were thrown on the dole. At the pits the coal was frozen solid, whilst 75,000 coal wagons couldn’t be moved.\n\nBy mid February industrial electric supply was completely cut-off. Electric fires were banned at certain times as well as greyhound racing, the Third Programme and TV were cut off; German POWs who were still here, were ordered to clear the railways.\n\nThere was 20 inches of snow in Huddersfield. The Great-North Road the main North-South artery was blocked for 22 miles with 20-foot drifts. The country almost ground to a halt with 14-foot icebergs off the Norfolk coast.\n\nBuckingham Palace, The Law Courts and Government Ministries were candle-lit though by the end of February the cold appeared to be easing, but not before February suffered the coldest weather since 1659, when ice-floes appeared off the east coast.\n\nBy mid-March 300 roads were impassable, Scotland was cut off by 30ft drifts and it wasn’t until later in the month that the weather improved: then came the floods!\n\n(1) Two key Ministers at the time in Attlee’s Government.\n\nRefs:\n\nPinterest.\n\ngoogleimages.\n\nEarly banks were small and locally based so failure would have dire affects on the immediate and wider areas in its knock-on effects.\n\nA typical example was Medley and Son which had branches at Uxbridge, Watford and Aylesbury as well as two in Ireland and it was Today that the Windsor and Eton Express in 1837 reported that ‘the Bank of Messrs Medley and Son and Company of this town had stopped payments’, which was to cause a run upon another old established bank of Ramsbottom and Company. (1)\n\nMedley’s troubles, as a bank of deposit, was not of an ‘extensive character’, but declared that the ‘greatest loss was for holders of Medley notes, ‘as like other small banks then printed their own currency.\n\nHowever larger banks could also suffer as was the case with Gurneys which had earlier become established in Norfolk and Suffolk. By 1800 Richardson Overend & Company was established by Thomas Richardson and John Overend Chief Clerk of bankers Smith Payne to become Overend and Gurney.(2)\n\nOn ‘Black Friday’ in May 1866 the ‘Bankers Bank’ as it was known, collapsed owing £11m (£981m in 2008 terms), causing a financial panic in the country. Gurneys survived the crash but were was taken over by Barclays in 1896. (3)\n\nTo meet the needs of economic growth many banks had been founded in the 18th century, with over seventy banks in London along with 400 private country banks. The early 19th century saw legislation to regulate banking with The Bank Charter Act of 1826 permitting formation of joint stock banks more than 65 miles from London which helped to spread risk.\n\nThe number of country banks totalled 554, but were small and restricted by law from competition with the Bank of England, leaving them vulnerable during financial crises to failure as in the 1816 crash. In 1828 Fry’s Bank collapsed and in 1857 over 130 banks collapsed. Lloyds averted a serious banking crisis with the take over of Cox & Company, the Army bankers.\n\nIn October 1878 the City of Glasgow Bank foundered which saw the last run on a bank before that of Northern Rock in 2007.\n\nThe Bank, not for the first or last time, had hidden the true state of its affairs so that the day before collapsing, £100 shares were trading at £236, and as the shareholders were unlimited in their losses most of the holders of stock were committed to all the Bank’s losses not just their personal holdings, making a case for limited liability which was eventually to become law.\n\n(1) The collapse of Ramsbottom and Newman & Co of Lombard Street, London in March 1816, was one of many in the 19thc. The collapse coincided with John Newman’s conversion experience, leading to his Roman Catholicism. After the collapse Newman senior went to Alton to manage a brewery!\n\n(2) Smith Payne & Company of Nottingham was absorbed by National Provincial in 1902.\n\n(3) The family de Gourneys ( Gurneys) had come over with William the Conqueror.\n\nToday in Tuesday’s Daily Telegraph it reported Churchill’s reply to critics of his administration in a 95 minute speech when he surveyed the war situation and future direction of the Allied operations. Two day’s later on Thursday after he had called for a vote of confidence, he won by 464 votes to one. The lone ‘No’ was socialist James Maxton (1)\n\nChurchill said, ‘he was not going to pick out scapegoats for things which have gone wrong and it is because things have gone badly and worse is to come that I demand a vote of confidence… more American forces will be added to those arriving yesterday and numerous fighter and bomber squadrons would take part in the defence of Britain and to attack Germany’.\n\nBy March the News Chronicle Gallup Poll found that 50% of the people were dissatisfied with the conduct of the war with Beaverbrook’s Daily Express using Tom Driberg’s critical pamphlets. Churchill resisted demands for a Second Front from critics such as Bevan, but agreed to launch a new bomber offensive.\n\nHowever on March 28th when Lubeck was destroyed; the Germans responded with the Baedeker raids adding to the general growing discontent. George Orwell, considered: ‘Churchill’s position is very shaky and thought after the fall of Singapore his popularity has slumped’.\n\nOn June 25th a censure motion was placed on the Commons Order Paper: ‘that this house, while paying tribute to the heroism and endurance of the armed forces….has no confidence in the central direction of the war’.\n\nThe first name on the motion was that of Sir John Wardlaw-Milne, one of the most powerful of backbenchers. Allied with him was Admiral of the Fleet Sir Roger Keyes, whose intervention in the Norway debate helped the demise of Chamberlain; a third signatory was Hore-Belisha.\n\nWardlaw-Milne sensing the hostility suggested the motion be deferred until the battle of Tobruk was over.(2) But the Cabinet wouldn’t have this and with a red flower in his button-hole and looking as a reporter said ‘like a Punch cartoon of a statesman’ started well but then stuttered out: ‘It would be a very desirable move-if His Majesty the King and His Royal Highness would agree-if His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester were to be appointed Commander-in Chief of the British Army.\n\nThis was followed by a gasp followed by a cacophony, half-groan, half-guffaw. Churchill in understatement said his gaffe had, ‘proved injurious to his case by proposing to involve the Royal family in controversy’.\n\n‘What impertinence’, the Duke later wrote to his wife, ‘without asking anybody and me in particular.’\n\nHowever Churchill survived the vote on 2nd July 1942 by 475 to 25, giving the ‘V for Victory’ sign as he left the chamber and called to an end of ‘naggers and snarlers’. Sir John never recovered, losing his seat in 1945, though Sir Roger couldn’t hide his respect for Churchill who he said was interfering too little in the detailed conduct of the war. The debate had lasted until 3 am, the longest sitting of the war.(3)\n\n(1) The Commons resolved that this House has confidence in His Majesty’s Government and will aid it to the utmost in the vigorous prosecution of war.\n\n(2) Tobruk fell on 21st June 1942.\n\n(3) Stafford Cripps later resigned from the War Cabinet In November 1942, but he remained as a Minister when his demand for a war-planning directorate was vetoed and Aneurin Bevan attacked army commanders’ failure for lack of co-ordination with the RAF.\n\nRef: H of C Debate 29 Jan 1942 Vol 377 cc927-1019.\n\nRef: David Reynolds.

(1)\n\nSo it was Today that Repton (1775-1860), son of the famous landscape designer Humphrey, gave a lecture to the Society on the Mayoral ornamental door-posts at Norwich as it appears this was the custom to so place outside the Chief Magistrate’s door.\n\nThe practice was alluded to by playwrights of the time when Thomas Petts, Mayor of London in 1592 was spoken of by a contemporary dramatist: Cornrnunis-crave my counsel : tell me what manner of man is he? Can he entertain a man in his house… know he how to become a scarlet gown? Hath he a pair of fresh posts at his door? (2)\n\nThen in Beaument and Fletcher’s play, The Widow. ‘I have your door the better while I know it. Widow: A pair of such brothers were fitter for posts without door indeed to make a show at a new-chosen magistrate’s gate than to be used in a woman’s chamber’.\n\nSimilar posts were erected at the sheriff’s gate and used for dispaying proclamations: in Rowley’s play, ‘A woman never vexed (1632). ‘If e’er I live to see thee Sheriff of London, I’ll gild thy posts’.\n\nThe practice of having posts, lamp-posts, still continued outside the house of ex-Provosts of Edinburgh as recorded in 2007 when the ex official was complaining that a faulty bulb hadn’t been replaced.\n\nAlso in Rochdale, Lancs., the tradition was renewed in recent times as revealed in the biography of Cyril Smith, late Liberal politician, who recalled having a pair outside his terraced house when he was mayor.\n\n(1) Printed London in 1839.\n\n(2) ‘In Lingua or a Combat of one Tongue and Five Senses for Superiority’: a Pleasant Comedie 1607.\n\nReferences/Pics.\n\nwikipedia.org.\n\nChambers Book of Days. 1869.\n\nScotsman.com 26.9.2007.\n\ninvestinrochdale.co.uk. 1.12. 2016.\n\nThe British prime minister before we had fixed Quinquennial Parliaments used to legitimise his position by deciding when to go to the electorate. But if he ended up not commanding the largest party he could hold out and meet parliament without resigning, until a vote has taken place on the monarch’s speech. Thus Baldwin did hold on to office until Today in 1924 when he was defeated after a vote of no-confidence.\n\nUntil 1868 the prime minister always met parliament after an election even if they had clearly lost and take defeat on a confidence vote or its equivalent before resigning. Thereafter administrations normally resigned before a new parliament assembled.\n\nDisraeli’s decision in that year to resign immediately after the election result was clear, rather than meet parliament and be voted out by Gladstone. He thus created a precedent of an unambiguous election result showing that the government has clearly lost, it resigns immediately.\n\nHowever where no party has a clear majority, either course seems to be valid constitutionally:to resign forthwith as not commanding confidence of the House or to face parliament.\n\nThis is where we come to the precedent set by Baldwin in 1923 when he was unlikely to be able to command a majority, after the Liberal Asquith said he would support Labour in a hung parliament, nonetheless decided to meet parliament.\n\nIt was only after being voted down in King’s Speech, about six week’s after the election, did he resign.\n\nBaldwin was thus to revert to the pre-1868 practice in January 1924 after losing in December 1923 when he lost his majority and couldn’t form a coalition. He held on to office until he was defeated on a vote of no confidence over tariffs on January 24th 1924 in the King’s Speech allowing Labour and Liberals to pass the vote 328 to 251.\n\nAfter Baldwin resigned the King asked Ramsay MacDonald to form a minority government and so Labour came to power for the first time.\n\nRef: Lord Adonis. 14.10.2010.

This secured for him the patronage oF leading printers in England and on the Continent, after being inspired by the Dutch Baroque style once the most commonly used in England.\n\nBorn in Cradley in the Black Country in 1692/3. he trained as an engraver in Birminham and in 1716 started in London as an engraver of gunlocks and barrels. Becoming a bookbinders’ tool cutter which due to his contact with printers induced him to fit up a type foundry after being encouraged by William Bowyer. (1)\n\nHis name soon became identified with an enduring style of Latin alphabet and later known as Caslon’s first type called ‘Exotics’. His first design was Arabic made at ‘English size’ and commissioned by the Society for Propagation of Christian Knowledge (pre 1725), followed by Hebrew created for Bowyer in 1726 and Coptic for Wilkins in 1731.\n\nHis designs was later to influence John Baskerville typefaces and was progenitor to Transitional and Didone type classifications. Caslon’s first print version was used in the US Declaration of Independence and the motto was: ‘When in doubt use a Caslon’. However after his death his style fell from favour but revived in 1840s with several revivals still used today.\n\nCaslon was buried at St. Luke’s, Old Street, London where his table tomb is still preserved.\n\n(1) Two year dates common before calendar reorganisation of 1752.\n\nReferences/Pics.\n\nwikipedia.org.\n\nnpg.org.uk.\n\nSimon Garfield.

Shady Characters, 2013.\n\nBy 21st December in 1665 Pepys recorded, ‘that I have never lived so merrily as I have done this plague-time’. By Today on 22nd January 1666 he was able to return to Seething Lane from Greenwich, London, where he had escaped the ravages of the outbreak as many other rich people had done.\n\nHowever on return to his own parish St. Olave’s near the Tower he was rattled : ‘It frighted (sic) me indeed to go through the church more than I thought it could have done, to see so many graves lie so high in the churchyards where people have been buried of the plague. I was much troubled at it, and do not think to go through it again a good while’. (1)\n\nIn 1665 at the climax of the plague the Court was forced to retire to Salisbury when in London about 7,000 died in a single week (probably 100,000 in total). . More than two-thirds of the population had died by the outbreak had ended in October 1666.\n\nOne of the best accounts of the plague was the work of physician Nathaniel Hodges (1629-88), ‘who rose early every morning, took a dose of a Pestilential Electuary (sweetener) as big as a nutmeg and on entering a house took a lozenge and afterwards drank sack and dish of roast meat and pickles.\n\nElected a Fellow of the College of Physicians in 1672, Hodges fell on hard times and imprisoned at Ludgate Debtors Prison. After dying he was buried at St. Stephen’s Walbrook which was destroyed in the Great Fire of 1666. (2)\n\nThe Great Fire of London in 1666 destroyed the overcrowded, insanitary conditions which had been favourable for the plague outbreak, as 300 years later Hitler’s bombs were to reduce the slums to rubble.\n\n(1) Despite all the calamities of Samuel’s life, the Pepys family later prospered, a descendant being Lord Chancellor in the Governments of the Lords Melbourne and Russell.\n\n(2) Leimologia sive pestis nuperae apud populum Londinensem grassantis narratio historica 1672.\n\nHistorical account of contagion which spread among the London populace.\n\nReferences/Pics.\n\npepysdiaries.com.\n\nwikipedia.org.\n\nRaising Bank Rate keeps down inflation and encourages saving, deters people from borrowing resulting in lower demand. Lowering Rates stimulates demand, pushes up prices leaving people with more disposable income after items such as mortgage payments are factored in.\n\nLeaks or allegations on matters political or financial, have a long history, and it was Today that Lord Chief Justice Parker’s Tribunal reported in 1958 on improper disclosure of the increase of the Bank Rate.\n\nThe background was the financial crisis of 1957 when rising inflation caused a Bank Rate increase from 5% to 7% on the 19th September which had been improperly disclosed.\n\nThen as now the cost of the Inquiry was enormous as it examined 132 witnesses and 236 written statements and concluded that it had unhesitatingly reached a unanimous conclusion that there is no justification for allegations about the raising of the Bank Rate was improperly disclosed.\n\nIn the 19th century the Bank of England and Bank Rate, was virtually independent of government control so much that Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool in the Lords in 1822 bemoaned as extraordinary and injurious the refusal of the Bank to discount at a lower rate than 5% when the market rate was 4%.\n\nFinding it impossible to induce the Bank to lower the rate of interest on their discounts conformably with expectations in 1817, his majority government borrowed £4 million on Exchequer Bills from the Bank with a view to applying that sum for the relief of the country.\n\nThe collapse in 1866 of Overend and Gurney, the ’Bankers’ Bank and the largest Discount House in the world was calamitous for the mid 19th century economy and the problem was exacerbated in that Bank Rate was 10% for the longest period in British history, in an attempt to cap inflation and demand and deter borrowing. (1)\n\nBy 1921 Bank Rate was reduced from 7 to 6 ½% on 28th April which rates were to become the norm or thereabouts until the 21st century. However this ignores the turbulence of the 1970s and 1980s. In 1980, Thatcher’s second year, inflation reached 25% and Bank Rates wandered from 8.1% to 16%: Compare this with the early 1960s which saw a rise from 4% to 5%, to the crisis of autumn 1979 when it reached 17%: good for savers, bad for borrowers.\n\nThatcher’s hostility to ERM and preference for the pound was justified two years later, in the time of her successor, John Major, with the fiasco of Black Wednesday September 16th 1992. when Bank Rate rose from 10% to 12% and then to 15%.(2)\n\nThe measures failed to stem the flight from the pound and caused us to quit the ERM. Thus Major’s governmen now lost any chances of winning the next election and indeed took the Tory’s renown as a party for economic soundness. What the debacle showed was the dependence of political decision on the markets in this case Bank Rate: ignore the markets at your political peril.\n\nIn 1997 the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) took over from the Chancellor the control of bank rate, so taking political advantage out of the reckoning.\n\nIn the 2008 credit crisis Bank Rate was cut by 1.5% to 3 % the largest cut since 1981 and the lowest rate and in March 0.5% and this is where it has obstinately stopped to Nov 2013: bad for investors, good for borrowers.\n\n(1) This was the height of ‘railway mania’ speculation.\n\n(2) The Author remembers this day as holding large cash reserves his interest rates rose very nicely when one could get 10% on money.\n\nRef: guardian.com/Interest Rates in the Uk since 1694.\n\nRef: Bank of England 1950s to 1979.

This bible was eventually banned in favour of the State Authorised Version by 1644, as its glosses (comments) were thought seditious.\n\nToday Bible translator Myles Coverdale died in1569 in London. Bishop of Exeter until he was deposed in 1553 by Mary I (Bloody Mary’), Coverdale was an assistant of Tyndale, whose Bible made extensive use of the 1526 New Testament and original Greek sources. Written in English the translation helped to standardise the English tongue in the southern dialect.(1)\n\nThe Coverdale Bible was commanded by Henry VIII in 1538 to be set up in every church for public reading, after Tyndale’s Bible had been suppressed as ‘pestilent glosses’. Coverdale was followed by Matthew’s 1537 and Taverner’s Bibles to culminate in the Great Bible of 1539, the result of Cranmer’s efforts to produce an authorised text with Coverdale as editor-in-chief.\n\nIn 1536 the Protestant Thomas Cromwell ordered the Paternoster and Commandments to be taught in English instead of Latin, resulting in the northern unrest of the Catholic Pilgrimage of Grace, as their traditional services were removed.\n\nThis exhortatory age now ordered in 1538 that every church was to have the Bishops’ Bible, but in 1543 Parliament panicked, and made it illegal to be read or expounded as likely to be too broadly interpreted among the lower orders and liable to make the apprentices unruly and so was to be now restricted to the less dangerous literate clergy and the upper orders.\n\nHowever it was never fully enforced; only one third of the population could read and in a visual age most acquired any Biblical knowledge by rote, church windows, wall paintings and the itinerant Mystery Plays.\n\nMatthew’s Great Bible 1539 was similarly suppressed by Mary I and so called owing to its large size. Other names ascribed to this Bible were Cromwell’s Bible as he had directed publication; Whitchurch’s as he printed it; the Chained Bible as it was chained in Churches for all to read and Cranmer’s as he wrote a preface in the 2nd edition.\n\nEngland was one of the last in Europe to produce a vernacular Bible and Middle English translations include John Wycliffe’s first complete translation, the Wycliffe Bible of the persecuted Lollards from Richard II to the Reformation, and early modern versions regarded as heresies with marginal notes by Tyndall, and the Geneva Bibles.\n\nIt wasn’t until a thousand years after the Latin Vulgate, that there was felt a need to translate the Bible for the people, but even as late as Queen Elizabeth there was no universal accepted text. Puritans used the 1560 Geneva Bible, drawing on Protestant translations for which Tyndale had been executed.\n\nHowever this Calvinist Bible was thought too Republican; translating for instance Hebrew words for ‘king’ as ‘tyrant’ and had anti-royalist marginal notes. Archbishop Wareham noted: ‘in the Genevan translation some notes are partial, untrue, seditious and savouring of traitorous conceits’.\n\n(1) Coverdale was buried at St Bartholemews by the Exchange which was demolished in 1840 to make way for the new Royal Exchange, and then moved to St Magnus.\n\nRef: bbc.co.uk/news/mag.
