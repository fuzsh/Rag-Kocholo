        "text": "THE OBSERVER, SEPTEMBER 26, 1965 up BP steps on the gas they've perfected dishwashers III III tons a year. But last July current plans for new refinery capacity added up to a formidable .235 million ton9 almost all of which should be on stream by 1968. B.P.'s contribution- to this vast total will be no less than 10 per cent, adding more than a-third to current product sales, and thus to the group's essential discount-free diet of its own crude. The paradox is that with this sort of expansion programme under way. the all-British oil giant has no control over marketing of its products in Britain .\n\nEver since 1931, when economies of distribution were what mattered most, British sales have been handled jointly with Shell through Shell- clever, efficient Kim THE British Petroleum giant has stepped on the North Sea gas at just the right moment A discovery which could be historic helped to deaden the pain of the first-half drop in net profits from 39 million to 35 million which the group revealed, to much less acclaim, two days later. Not that new-found wealth Is round the corner. It's only a whiff, we wish it was more,\" says B.P. chairman the Hon. Sir Maurice Bridgeman, with aristocratic charm .\n\nBut the whiff was enough to cheer up B.P.'s North Sea rivals too. After three dry holes they were feeling mildly glum about. their 80 million gamble, in which the odds on finding anything at all are one in 10 and on finding lomething worthwhile one in 50. But B.P.'s Sea Gem on block 486 has been drilling in what the geologists divined as the most likely spot for success. Geologists have been wrong before they kept drilling in up-country Nigeria for 10 years before moving to a delta flush with oil .\n\nAs Sea Gem's drill bites through the 10,000 ft mark this weekend, the hope is that the first whiff will become something commercially more substantial. Even if it does, the slow, laborious process of moving the rig and drilling many more wells to prove the field must follow. In the great Dutch gas field of Groningen proving alone took three long years. Awash with oil' Leading the field in this particular race is nevertheless some consolation for a group that, in a world awash with oil, is \"without a cosy layer of American fat to keep us warm that rich market is insulated by import quotas from cold world forces. Only Shell Oil, with a 21 per cent rise in all-American profits, made possible the 3.6 per cent gain in first-half earnings for the parent Royal Dutch-Shell group, which makes up in the West for what is lacks in crude oil in the East .\n\nheartfelt wish for a comfortable foothold in the Western Hemisphere somehow never gets granted. The Government's 51 per cent stake in B.P.'s equity excludes It from Venezuela, which doesn't welcome State-owned foreign prospectors. Sir Maurice admits that it was to open this particular door that B.P. (in league with Shell) abortively bid 90 million for Bur-mah Oil, the company which shares B.P.'s Finsbury Circus home and which owns another quarter of B.P.'s shares. Success in that bid Would have meant a jump in B.P.'s share capital and a whittled down Government stake .\n\nGoing West through Canadian operations has proved only marginally less abortive. Phenomenally successful at finding oil in the Eastern Hemisphere, B.P. draws no more than a flea-bite from its Canadian wells, and looks green-eyed at the booming production of Imperial Oil, the Canadian arm of Standard Oil of New Jersey. But if Sir Maurice can't really get into America, some of the Americans have been only too successful at moving out, supplementing their high-cost production at home by finding ample cheap Middle East and Libyan oil.

Bridgeman only a whiff. has duly found the obvious outlet in Europe, B.P.'s backyard .\n\nIt is this competition that has cut so deeply into B.P.'s profit margins. What is worse the pressure has been heaviest in B.P.'s strongest suit-heating oils. If you really want to pinpoint fall in profits, it's the sale of heating oils in Central Europe,\" says Sir Maurice, who is absolutely not- prepared to gueaa when the pain will cease. What he has no doubt about at all is that at present price levels the industry is not generating the full amount of cash necessary for the production dictated by the annual rise in world consumption.\" Corporation has only served to widen the. gap between the cash flow and the capital programme .\n\nCutting back on capital expenditure is 'not easy in the oil game, which is wrnrnonly played in partnership. It's considered a bad thing to hold a partner back.\" Tax grab The tax sums don't look too dreadful Although repeating last year's dividend of 37 million will cost B.P. an extra 26 million, in tax, transitional relief amounting to around 23 million will reduce the burden for the first three years. But under the new tax system,\" says Sir. Maurice, \"something has got to be curtailed and exploration must inevitably head the list.\" The reason is crystal clear .\n\nB.P. is already sitting on nearly a fifth of world oil reserves, with nearest rivals Jersey Standard and Gulf Oil lagging appreciably behind.\" Today, however, it's far better to be a seller of oil products than of crude. Heavy discounts must now be offered to sell the crude at all, but Middle East Governments make very certain that royalties are still paid on the basis of -undis-counted posted prices. And the Governments' take is moving inexorably upwards. In the first half of this year'BJVs overseas tax bill' was a staggering 67 million on profits of 100 million .\n\nB.P. has a hard fight ahead merely to maintain its third' place after Shell and Esso in the European sales league. Even without a bonanza in the North Sea (which would have its embarrassing side in glut conditions) the game is getting harder. At present the refineries outside North America and the Communist countries are turning out around 800 million County.

One is never' entirely hippy with anything, but it's a faot of life.\" Lucky strike Last year, petrol sales under the second-string National Benzole brand from the same Shell-Mex stable were already getting mighty close to B.P.'s gallonage. Some oilmen wouldn't be surprised if National Benzole's getaway image has now taken it ahead. It is a problem which B.P .\n\nis going to face up to one day and which, like the group's other worries, will not be dissipated overnight in a cloud of profitable North Sea gas.

All the same, stepping on the gas, in one sense or another, is exactly what BJ. has to do. OVER the next few weeks the stock market will be paying more attention than usual to beer, for the main brewery dividend season is upon us .\n\nSomething like two-thirds of Britain's brewers will close their trading year this Thursday, and they waste very little time in getting their' figures out. By early November we will have had a fair sampling of results. This has not been a happy year for the trade, what with generally flat sales and cc-sts rising on i broad front Nor have large wine and ipirits offshoots been much 'omfort, tince sales here have also been' sluggish. Consequently, there could be disappointments. Certainly dividend increases look very unlikely .\n\nThe fall in brewery shares this year the section is 12 per cent below its high does, of course, allow for a good deal. All the same. I feel that we shall see many shares go lower yet, especially the medium-sized and imaller breweries. I would consider those yielding under 4 per cent to be most vulnerable. Into this category fall Hull Brewery (priced at 21s .\n\n9d. to return 4.3 per cent with a priceearnings ratio of 20), E. Lacon (I4s. to yield 4.2 per cent with a PE ratio of 15), James Hole (36s. 96 .\n\nto return 3.4 per cent with a PE ratio of 23) and Davenports C.B. (20s. 6d. to yield 3.7 per cent with a PE ratio of 12i). True, there is always the possibility of being snapped up by Big Brother .\n\nSignificantly, however, there has lately been a growing reluctance among big brewers to expand through direct take- rather weakens the argument that I.C.T. will one day come again for English Electric's computer division with a new If-anything English Electric, which after all is so much bigger all round, is the more likely to end up with all the home-grown computer interests under its roof. As things stand there is not a lot to choose, although clearly English Electric (the shares are 51s. 6d. to return 4.6 per cent) is the runner with more stamina and more appeal for those who like to sleep soundly .\n\nI.C.T. Ordinary shares, now to yield 61 per cent, have the more interesting possibilities but strictly speculative ones. Harper fuss THE controversy which seems to be blowing up over the merger terms for. Harper Engineering and Electronics one \"shareholder will be circulating his \"views this week, another is contemplating doing the same seems to me somewhat misguided. The real point is that, left to its own devices, Harper is unlikely to be paying a dividend this year or next .\n\nWith a bid, shareholders are back on their feed straight away. Secondly, although Harper 'is stuffed full of assets, it still has a big financial headache, a 1.2 million overdraft. Thirdly, it is getting 5 per cent of the new group's equity in return for an effective contribution to the new group's net earnings of only slightly more 7 per cent on this year's figures and 6 per cent on next year's. On ration overs. Instead, they are becoming much keener on direct trading links, along the lines announced by Allied Breweries with Whitbread last week and Charrington United a week ago .\n\nI.C.T. upheaval LAST WEEK'S news of major new computer births at English Electric pnd International Computers and Tabulators (where the chairman-, ship has also abruptly changed hands) adds further intrigue to an old stock-market puzzle which company is the best bet for the computer explosion of the next decade Until recently, I.C.T. looked to have left both Elliott-Automation and English Electric behind on development with its new 1900 family. Moreover, talks had been held with English Electric on taking over the latter's computer division, then not so strong a challenger. But the breakdown of those talks, the subsequent slump in I.C.T.'s profits and share price, and now the management upheaval have created new doubts .\n\nEnglish Electric's decision to raise its computer stake sharply (the new range will involve around 5 million of expenditure) introduces a further element of confusion. The move witnessed a sharp jump in the depreciation figure, reflecting heavy capital spending, the benefits of which are only now being felt. Overall the new plant installed increased Fox's capacity by some 20 per csnt. Yet although the company is now working on various shifts from 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 p.m .\n\nit is still having to ration supplies. Moreover, the ordinary shares at 14s 9d. combine a low price-earnings ratio \"(54) with a well-covered yield of 5.9 per cent. Dressing down IT STRIKES me that Mr Norman Kunick, the young son of Mr Philip Kunick, chairman of the family dress firm of Philip Kunick, is an enterprising chap. Rather than join the family business, he has set up his own 1,000 dressmaking firm.\" There are, it vas announced last week, no financial connections with Philip Kunick.\" However, there is a powerful link of another kind .\n\nKunick is working as a sub-contractor for his father's firm. Whatever the reasoning behind this, it is a development of which shareholders should strongly disapprove. Philip Kunick' is a public company, and should not behave on the assumption that financial connections are the only ones that count. Over-squeezed THE shake-out in construction machinery shares on credit squeeze grounds has, in my- view, been overdone in the case of Walker Brothers, which makes the Benford concrete mixers. The ordinary shares, no.w 10s .\n\nhave come nearly off their year's high. Admittedly, life is no longer a bed of roses. In fact, Walker Brothers' half-yearly results, out very recently, showed the early scars of the credit squeeze profits were 8 per cent down'. All the I consider that a dividend' of 40 per cent is very likely Ohis year, in which event the yield is 7.4 per cent. Walker also has remark, able powers of recuperation, and can be expected to be in the forefront when better times return .\n\nLoo Ik 0 on sti a mi Life ssytrairDce from NO medical examination NO long questionnaire NO delays Top good to be true Indeed no as more than' 10,000 life Assurance.Upinen have now proved.

But this still remains a thoroughly admirable method of investing regular savings. Most such schemes follow a similar pattern. The bulk of each contribution is invested in units, the remainder going to provide life cover for the term of the policy. Since the normal life assurance tax reliefs are available, most investors will in effect be purchasing units at a useful discount .\n\nWith the-M. and G. Trust Assurance plan, for example, a standard rate taxpayer who Is under 38, putting.100 a year into a 15-year policy, will receive 94 worth of units and (subject to the usual tax conditions) pay out i ly 83 10s. The M. G .\n\nscheme, one of the best of its type, can be linked with any of- the group's trusts, including the M. G. General Trust. This is an immensely diversified 20 million fund with a good record of growth over the years. Since being launched in 1951, capital value per unit has multiplied over 2i times, while income has more than trebled .\n\nAt 14s. 31d. the units yield 5.5 per cent With investment trust share prices still showing an average discount from underlying asset value of about 20 per cent, this sector has special long-term attractions. These naturally rub off on any unit trust, like Natbifs, (which has a substantial proportion of investment trust holdings in its portfolio. So Natbifs' latest block offer is especially timely .\n\nA further advantage for Natbifs of this emphasis on trusts is that it adds greatly to the diversification of what at first sight looks a rather specialised fund. Investment trusts and financial and property companies in fact contribute three-quarters of the portfolio, the remainder divided between banks and insurance companies. Since the fund was started in 1956, the capital value per unit has more than doubled. At 7s. the units yield \"4.4 per cent .\n\nN. McG.M. came from several leaders.

But with Wednes- day's cease-fire in the Indian-Pakistan war and a renewed burst of strength in sterling, they soon regained their previous poise, and finished on a strong note. Overall the Financial Times Industrial index closed 5 points to the good at 335.1,- a performance which is noteworthy since the market, had to digest some unsavoury news from several well-known companies .\n\nDisappointing profit statements HOW THE SCHEME WORKS Your premiums can be anything from 24 to 300 a year provided that their total, over the whole terra, does not come to more than 3,000. You can get tax relief, up to 16.10.0d per 100 premium. Your money is invested in a first-class Unit Trust. The box opposite gives details of the General Trust Fund, run by the senior unit trust group and quoted on the Stock Exchange. All income is reinvested for your benefit You receive on maturity units accumulated over the term of the policyor their value in cash if you prefer .\n\nYour heirs would receive (if you died during the term) units so far accumulated plus a sum, in cash equal to the premiums for the (complete) \"unexpired\" years. You can surrender your policy without penalty at any time and take out units so far accumulated. LET US TAKE AN EXAMPLE You are 35, in good health, and eligible for full income tax relief. You decide to take out a twenty-year policy with a yearly premium of 100. We receive this sum each year; and from it we take the cost of insuring your life, and of management charges .\n\nAll the rest 93 in your case is inves ted in units of the General Trust Fund. (The table opposite gives you examples of the annual \"sum invested\" for other ages and terms). Now, you get 16.10.0d tax relief on your 100 premium, so that it.only costs you 83.10.0d. Thus you have 93 investedat a net cost of only 83.10.0d. PLUS your life cover .\n\nIf you died after paying (say) the first nine yearly premiums, your heirs would get units built-up out of nine premiums of 93 (and incorporating all the reinvested income), plus. 1,100 in cash. Otherwise, at maturity, you will get a fund of units built up over the 20-year term. How. much will they be worth? As this is essentially an investment in shares the prices of which go up and down it is just not possible to say .\n\nBut on the average experience of the whole period jfrom 1919 to 1962 the benefit would have been over 3300. Capital gains realised by life assurance funds are now subject to tax, and policy benefits are liable to be affected thereby. This new tax does not, however, detract from the competitive merits of Trust Assurance, pleasant news.
