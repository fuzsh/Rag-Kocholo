In the United Kingdom, benzole or benzol is a coal-tar product consisting mainly of benzene and toluene not to be confused with the word &quot;benzol&quot; (or benzole) which in some languages means benzene and can be confused  can mean petrol, or gasoline.\n\t\n\tIn the early part of the 20th century Benzole was produced in a small scale and was used during the 1st World War for propelling mortar shells massively increasing production. With the onset of peace there was huge surplus of benzole which happily coincided with the increase in popularity of the Motor Car.\n\t\n\tA group of men, including Samuel Henshaw, then the chairman of the Staffordshire Chemical Company, reckoned there was money to be made from these surplus-to-requirements stocks, setting up National Benzole in February 1919 in a room next to the boiler house of the Gas Light and Coke Company in London's Horseferry Road. Although the idea of using benzole to power automobiles was not new, cars fueled on neat benzole needed altered carburetor settings which was inconvenient for owners who had previously used petrol and the effectiveness of neat benzole as a paint stripper raised concern about the possible effect on carburettor floats made of varnished cork – a common feature in US imported vehicles. Also the quality of the new fuel was proving inconsistent. Henshaw and his team set about ironing out these problems which in 1919 was boosted by the award of the RAC Dewar Trophy to a Rolls-Royce 40/50 hp that successfully completed a 10,000-mile reliability trial fuelled exclusively by National Benzole. However in the same year there was a Coal Strike which restricted benzole availability, and increased demand in the ensuing years led to frequent shortages of coal shale from which the benzole was made. Neat Benzole was also proving to strong for the average engine. National Benzoles answer came in 1922 by replacing neat benzole with a fifty fifty mix of benzole and petroleum. While neat Benzole continued to be marketed as an effective anti-knocking performance enhancing additive.\n\t\n\t Because garages were initially sparse, the Automobile Association ((AA) itself set up twelve strategically located filling stations, supplying fuel only to its own members and making no profit from the transactions initially supplying only National Benzole which was seen a particularly patriotic fuel choice because the coal shale which was the principal ingredient of benzole was domestically produced. The AA dismantled its garage network in 1927 due to motor fuel becoming more readily available but by now National Benzole had become a nationally established fuel brand in the UK. The company however had no oil refining facility of its own, and had to contract to buyer tanker loads already refined fuel. Which led to a long term contract with  the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which foreshadowed still closer links with the future British Petroleum company: Effectively promoted and distributed into the second half of the twentieth century, National Benzole continued to be very popular with British motorists and the National Benzole brand remained a common sight at the roadside. However the proportion of benzole in the mixture was reduced progressively after World War II as a number of  specialist applications for the chemical grew with the development of the UK's chemical industry. During the late 1950s Benzole was determined to be hazardous to health: its anti-knocking properties as a fuel ingredient were no longer so important for the smooth running of engines, since various additives including, ironically, tetraethyllead were now routinely included in refined petroleum. Therefore, from the early 1960s onwards National sold only petrol.  National Benzole joined the Shell-Mex &amp; BP family in 1957 but continued to trade separately by 1959 the motor fuel marketing business was now fully merged with Shell-Mex &amp; BP Benzole (no longer part of the mixture) was dropped from the fuel's name. Following the de-merger of Shell-Mex &amp; BP in 1976, the National brand continued to be distinctively marketed by BP for over a decade. \n\t\n\tMR. MERCURY\n\tIn 1928 with its 50-50 mix firmly established the company created Mr. Mercury as a marketing symbol. At first he appeared startlingly naked in a National newspaper advertising campaign. Mr. Mercury, in National Benzole's black and chrome gold corporate colours, became one of the most powerful marketing images of this age.
