        "text": "Click picture for video\n\nThe first commercial shown on TV in Britain\n\nwas forGibbs S R Toothpaste and was transmitted at 8.12 pm on Sept 22 1955 during a variety show hosted by Jack Jackson.\n\nViewers saw a tube of toothpaste embedded in a block of ice and a woman called Meg Smith brushing her teeth in the approved manner, \"up and down and round the gums\". The immaculate tones of Alex Macintosh delivered the newly-minted slogan: \"It's tingling fresh. It's fresh as ice. It's Gibbs SR toothpaste.\"\n\nThe commercial owed its prime placing to chance. The Gibbs advertisement had come first in a lottery drawn with 23 other advertisements, including those for Guinness, Surf, National Benzole, Brown & Polson Custard and Summer County Margarine.\n\nClick picture for video Murray Mints, Murray Mints, the too-good-to-hurry mints. Why make haste? When you can taste the hint of mint in Murray Mints (1955). Jingle was recorded by The Stargazers. Cliff Adams and the Stargazers appeared on Sunday Night at the London Palladium about three months after the start of commercial television. They took a chance and ended their act on what they called their 'latest recording'. They came on in bearskins and re-enacted the commercial on the stage. Then they pulled off the bearskins and inside them they had packets of Murray Mints which they threw to the audience. It caused a sensation, and showed the power that commercials had, even within three months.\n\nClick picture for video Rice Krispies - Snap, Crackle and Pop (1955)\n\nClick picture for video Don't forget the Fruit Gums Mum! (1956)\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe authorities later forced Rowntrees to change the slogan because of unfair pressure on mums. They cleverly came up with \"don't forget the fruit gums, chum\" instead. (The actor was Denis Gilmore )\n\nClick picture for video You're never alone with a Strand (1959). This jingle was again written by Cliff Adams. The actor was Terence Brooks who looked like Frank Sinatra, standing on a street in London, wearing a trench coat, with a hat on the back of his head, stopping to light a cigarette. This was followed by the theme tune. As soon as the commercial went on the air, enquiries started coming in, people ringing up and asking if there was a record of the music available. So Cliff Adams quickly went to a studio and recorded \"The Lonely Man Theme\". The released record contained no vocals and nothing was mentioned about cigarettes, just the musical theme. It is known that another version was recorded including some vocals but this was never released.\n\nCover and sleeve of a promotional cardboard record disc supplied to shopkeepers.\n\nThe other side has Jimmy Lloyd singing \"You're Never Alone with a Strand\"\n\nClick picture for video Rael-Brook Shirts - Written by Johnny Johnston, the theme was devised when he met Harry Raelbrook who was just starting up his shirt business. 'I want to advertise on television and I want a jingle. I make shirts.' he said. Johnny said 'What's so special about your shirts?'. He said 'You don't have to iron them.'\n\nSo Johnny sat at his piano and played and sang these seven words - 'Rael-Brook Toplin, the shirt you don't iron'.... repeated three times and then again in a changed key. Harry was delighted and said 'That's what I want, don't change anything', and they never did!\n\nAltogether now!\n\n\"Coates comes up from Somerset, where the cider apples grow.....!\"\n\nClick picture for video Butlins - still going strong today!\n\nClick picture for video Brooke Bond PG Tips starred the Brooke Bond chimps (1956). The first of these adverts was set in an elegant country house and showed an immaculately dressed 'boy' and 'girl' sitting at a Regency table and drinking tea from a silver service in dainty china cups. The voiceover came from Peter Sellers.\n\nClick picture for video \"Never go without a Capstan\"\n\nClick picture for video Joe, the tongue-tied Esso Blue paraffin salesman who called himself the 'Esso Blee Dooler'. Joe was created in 1958 when paraffin was a relatively common household fuel, but its use steadily declined over the years, as did Joe. Cadum for Madam, toilet soap introduced into the UK by Colgate-Palmolive in 1955 from France where it had been an established brand since 1907. \"Go to Work on an Egg!\" When the British Egg Marketing Board launched the Go to Work on an Egg' ads, no-one could have anticipated just how famous they would become. Watch the ads and find out for yourself.\n\nThe 1950s ads starred Tony Hancock, the legendary comedian, and the Go to work on an egg slogan is attributed to Fay Weldon, although she claims she was just the manager of the team who created the famous line.\n\nTony Hancock is probably most famous for Hancock's Half Hour which kicked off in November 1954, becoming a British institution for almost two decades.\n\nYou can now see Hancock in action, along with Patricia Hayes and Pat Coombs - eight of the ads from the original Go to Work on an Egg campaign are available to watch. Click on the link above!\n\nclick picture for video This OXO advert pre-dates the Katie and Philip series which was to follow on in the late 1950s (see below)\n\nclick picture for video OXO - Katie was launched as a TV advertising feature in October 1958, with the actress Mary Holland (at first on Sunday evening, in three sequential episodes). In 1960 a stouter husband replaced the willowy orginal.\n\nClick picture for video Animated commercial with the ever memorable theme:\n\nOh the Esso sign means happy motoring, The Esso sign means happy motoring, The Esso sign means happy motoring,\n\nCall at the Esso sign, For Esso Extra! Click picture for video All the family love Carnation\n\n'Cos its double rich,\n\nAll the family love Carnation!\n\nBecause Carnation makes even the simplest dishes taste wonderful, like this rice pudding made with one part double-rich Carnation to three parts water. Its extra creamy, and to pamper the palate, pour Carnation over the pudding too. Its delicious!\n\nDouble rich, Carnation!\n\nClick picture for video Mothers Pride is over 70 years old, first appearing in the north in 1936 and a national brand by 1956. Originally sold wrapped in wax paper, it progressed with technology to introduce the now-familiar plastic bread bag - although Mothers Pride Scottish Plain can still be bought in wax-wrapped bags.\n\nClick picture for video Ribena was advertised as the blackcurrant health drink. An animated cartoon. which would be very un-PC now.\n\nClick picture for video Get that Lovely, Lively, Lyril feeling!\n\nNo action here, just a series of still images. It was the catchy line above which was memorable.\n\nClick picture for video Dairy Box was a Rowntree brand. This Dairy Box ad features a dancing character called Judy.\n\nClick picture for video The Daz White Knights travelled around the country offering £5 and £10 prizes to those housewives who had stocked up with Daz washing powder.\n\nClick picture for video The British Insurance Association commercials featured Fred and his family. \"Get the full strength of the insurance companies around you!\"\n\nClick picture for video \"Phensic is better for headaches than Aspirin alone\"\n\nClick picture for video Black Magic Chocolates from Rowntrees\n\nClick picture for video Horlicks (malted milk hot drink) commercial featuring John Slater\n\nClick picture for video Sarongster girdles 'At The Palladium' commercial\n\nClick picture for video It all began a long, long time ago when Rowntree opened a tea and coffee shop in York in 1725. The Rowntree confectionery line gained popularity and in 1948 they launched the Polo Mint. It was similar to the Lifesavers that could be found in America and the British Navy Sweets but Rowntree attacked this problem with gusto and an aggressive marketing strategy and have since become known for their slogan and the shape of their mints, especially in the UK.\n\nClick picture for video The roll call of commercials with straplines that have entered the common parlance is almost endless: 'Go to work on an egg'; 'Milk's gotta a lotta bottle'; and enjoy the freedom of your car - 'Go well, go Shell'."
