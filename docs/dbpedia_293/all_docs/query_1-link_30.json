Dominion Motor Spirit and Brooklands Racetrack The brand was in favour at the Brooklands race track and also at the Brooklands Flying Club where many races were won on this brand. In 1926 Dominion was taken over by the Sealand Petroleum Co Ltd which had been formed that year and who was owned by the Marland Oil Company of America. By 1934 Marland Oil had sold Sealand, along with Dominion, to Shell-Mex and B.P.

Dominion was put fully under the NBC's 1950 Dominion Motor Spirit Petrol Pump Advertisementcontrol where it remained for a short period until phasing out a year or two later. \n\t[Vintage Garage website]",
