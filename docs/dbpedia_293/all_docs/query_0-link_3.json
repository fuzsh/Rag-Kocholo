For many years, chemists have had access to books with titles like Named Reactions in Organic Chemistry. Here the busy student or researcher can discover immediately the nature of the Wurtz reaction, the Cannizzaro reaction, and such curiosities as the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction. Until the first edition of the present book appeared in 1993, no such literary assistance was available to the multitudes who labored in the chemical industry. Six years later, a second edition took into account the many novelties that had appeared in that short period. Now a third edition is expanded still further, particularly by inclusion of many biological processes that industry now uses. This book is encyclopedic in scope as well as in name, covering a vast range of industrial practice. No single industrial chemist could possibly be familiar with more than a small fraction of the processes named; when a new one suddenly appears on the horizon, help is immediately available on these pages. I very much hope that all companies involved in chemical technology will ensure it finds a place in their libraries. Although few people borrow dictionaries for leisure reading (even dictionaries as good as this one), its natural home will be the reference section, so that it is instantly available on demand. There is, however, another reason for commending this book. Many of the names given to industrial chemical processes arise from their history. Some (such as Ayers) denote the names of their inventors; others (such as Hercules-BP) display the names of firms that originated or at least operated the process; others (such as hydrocracking) drop more than a hint of the principal reagent involved; others (such as PRI-SC) are acronyms constructed from initials of words in a phrase. However, others (such as CAMERE) are made from bits of different words and yet others (such as Merseburg) could mean anything at all. It happens to be the case that the history of the chemical industry, woefully neglected for decades, is just now coming back into fashion. This welcome development can be considerably assisted by the present work, where some historical detail often is included. Naturally, historians would have liked more (they always do). But there is sufficient detail to whet the appetites of workers in chemical technology to learn something further of the fascinating stories of their predecessors. This book can be dipped into with pleasure again and again. I warmly recommend it to anyone interested in the chemical industry — past, present, or future. Colin A. Russell Emeritus Professor of History of Science and Technology, The Open University Research Scholar affiliated to the Department of the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Cambridge\n\n© 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\n\nAcknowledgments I should like to thank my wife Daphne, without whose patience during the last 18 years these three editions could never have been produced.

The chemical industry is notoriously difficult to define. In addition to its obvious role as a producer of “chemicals” such as sulfuric acid, it may be said to embrace all those industries in which chemical processes are conducted. There is no generally agreed list of such industries, but obvious ones include extractive metallurgy, plastics, paper, ceramics, sewage treatment, and now even electronics. It is this broad spectrum of “chemical technology” that is addressed in this book. It thus includes the gigantic Bessemer process for making steel and the microscopic Manasevit process for applying circuits to silicon chips. The only deliberate omission is food chemistry. The aim has been to include all those processes that are known by special names, of whatever origin. Of course, only a minority of industrial chemical processes are distinguished by the possession of special names, so this book does not include all of even the more important processes. Overviews of the industry are provided by other books, notably the Kirk-Othmer and Ullmann encyclopedias. Many named processes are included in such works, but only a fraction of the names in the present compilation are to be found in them. The names show a heterogeneous etymology, their origins including inventors, companies, institutions, places, acronyms, abbreviations, and obvious corruptions of the chemical nomenclature. Derivations of the names, where known, are indicated in square brackets [ ]. The names of chemicals used in the entries are the traditional names commonly used in industry today; systematic names have yet to replace many common names and may never do so. Criteria for selection of names for inclusion are inevitably subjective, but the intention has been to include all named processes in current commercial use anywhere in the world, and those that have been or are being piloted on a substantial scale. Obsolete processes that have been or might have been important in the past are included, too. The coverage is primarily of English names, but some foreign names are included. Process names that combine the name of a company with the name of a chemical (e.g., the Monsanto Acetic Acid process) have mostly been excluded because they are self-explanatory and can be found in the encyclopedias. Some companies (e.g., Lurgi, Texaco) are best known for one process, even though they may have developed many others; in general, only their most famous one is included here under the company name. Their other processes are included if they have special names. Process names that combine the names of two collaborating companies (e.g., Mobil/Badger) have mostly been included. Company names are usually given in the styles in use at the times of their respective inventions, as given in patent applications. Where two or more processes have the same name, they are distinguished by numbers in parentheses, such as Parex (1), Parex (2). Because the numbers are not parts of the names they are not emboldened. Names of chemical reactions have mostly been excluded, being adequately defined in standard chemical texts and in the special chemical dictionaries listed in the Bibliography. There is remarkably little overlap between reaction names and process names: discoverers of chemical reactions seldom develop them into manufacturing processes. However, some generic process names that combine two or more reactions (e.g., oxychlorination, dehydrocyclodimerization) have been included because they are not generally to be found in any dictionaries. These hybrid names are distinguished by being given lower-case initial letters.\n\n© 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\n\nThe lengths of the entries have been tailored to reflect importance and topicality. In general, important processes in current use have the longest entries, obsolete processes of minor importance have the smallest, and processes of intermediate importance receive correspondingly intermediate space. There are exceptions: some obsolete processes are given more space because of their technical interest or historical importance; some important current processes are given little space because their essential features are still secret. References have been chosen that document the origins of the processes and that review the latest developments. Sources that are reasonably accessible have been quoted wherever possible. Journal abbreviations are those used by Chemical Abstracts. Patents quoted are generally those of the countries of the original inventions, or their British or U.S. equivalents. Many processes are described in families of patents; only the first or key ones are quoted here. I apologize for the incompleteness of some of the references in this edition. Public library services in Britain no longer provide open access to long runs of journals or to the older books, so it is no longer practicable to check everything. Much of the information on current processes comes from commercial literature provided to the author by the companies offering or using them. The author acknowledges their help and solicits additional information as it becomes publicly available. Copyright and trademark laws present special problems for works such as this, protection varying from country to country and from time to time. It would not be feasible to indicate which of the many names in this dictionary are so protected. The inclusion of a protected name, in its registered or commonly used format, has no legal significance and does not indicate that the name has become a generic word. Corporate designations (e.g., Ltd., PLC, Inc., AG, SA, A/S) have been omitted, except in cases in which confusion with personal names might occur. Company names listed are generally those that were current when the developments described were made. Because many companies have changed their names (often using letters instead of words) and their owners, many of these names are not current. Dates of invention given are usually the years in which the relevant patents were filed. Asterisks (*) denote names that are defined elsewhere in this dictionary. The Appendix provides a key to the chemicals and materials whose manufacture is described by one or more of the named processes. Although the dictionary does not purport to be a comprehensive listing of processes for making particular chemicals or materials, reference to the key will identify those processes that have special names, and reference to these entries will often provide general references that will help to identify the unnamed ones, too. Since the second edition of this dictionary was published in 1999, Internet search engines have become much more powerful and they complement printed works such as this. Historical material on the chemical industry (before about 1980) is poorly covered on the Internet, although the coverage is improving. Current information on established commercial processes is well covered by the Internet, which is used as a sales tool by process developers, but it needs to be accessed by combinations of keywords. Use of this dictionary to suggest such keywords will shorten the search. Currently active development projects that are monitored by the more ephemeral technical business press are less well documented on the Internet and are most effectively accessed by using the references in this book. Information on hitherto secret processes developed by government agencies is slowly reaching the public domain, thanks partly to the Freedom of Information Acts in the United States (1966) and the UK (2000). We now know the significance of COLEX, Runcol, Silex, and several other chemical processes of former military significance. Many of the processes new to this edition reflect recent trends in the global chemical industry. There is now much less emphasis on new processes for making basic chemicals and more emphasis on pollution prevention and waste disposal. Petrochemical processes, based on petroleum and natural gas, are giving way to biochemical processes, using a variety of sources of biomass. This edition describes about 450 more processes than the previous edition. Many of these new processes will remain unused, not because they are impractical but because, under present conditions, they would not be cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness is an elusive concept that inventors are unwise to ignore.\n\n© 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\n\nAuthor Dr. Alan Comyns has had an unusually varied career in academic, government, and industrial research laboratories.

Several processes, some of which are proprietary, are used to make the several commercial\n\n© 2007 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC\n\n4\n\nAcheson (1)\n\naluminum chloride products available. In general, it is necessary to introduce an excess of aluminum metal to a chloride solution, so that the atom ratio of aluminum to chlorine is less than three. The aluminum may be introduced as either the metal or the hydrated oxide. Acheson (1) A process for making silicon carbide from sand and coke, in an electric furnace, at 2,200 to 2,400°C: SiO + 3C ⫽ SiC +2CO Invented by E.G. Acheson in Monongahela City, PA, in 1892. Acheson was heating clay and carbon by means of an electric arc, in the hope of making diamond. The hard, crystalline product was called carborundum in the mistaken belief that it was a compound of carbon and corundum (alumina). The process and product were patented in 1893 and made on a small scale in Monongahela City, using the city’s electricity supply. In 1895, The Carborundum Company was formed to exploit the process in Niagara, NY, using hydroelectric power from Niagara Falls. This same process is now operated in many countries. The name Carborundum is a registered trademark owned by the Carborundum Company, NY, and used for several of its refractory products, in addition to silicon carbide. U.S. Patent 492,767.

A process for making sodium carbonate. The basic process was invented and partially developed in the first half of the 19th century by several workers, but the key invention was made by E. Solvay in Belgium in 1861. The first plant was built at Couillet, Belgium, in 1864; thereafter, the process became accepted worldwide, displacing the *Leblanc process. The raw materials are limestone and salt; calcium chloride is a waste product. The overall reaction is: CaCO3 + 2NaCl ⫽ CaCl2 + Na2CO3 When carbon dioxide is passed into a nearly saturated solution of sodium chloride containing some ammonia, ammonium bicarbonate is formed. The heart of the process is the exploitation of the equilibrium between this bicarbonate and sodium and ammonium chlorides: NH4HCO3 + NaCl\n\nNaHCO3 + NH4Cl\n\nIn this system, the least soluble component is sodium bicarbonate, which crystallizes out. On calcination, it yields sodium carbonate, and the carbon dioxide is recycled.
