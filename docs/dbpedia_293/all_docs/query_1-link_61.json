        "text": "2 Petroleum Knowledge\n\nThe Concessionaire shall immediately send out to Persia and at his own cost one or several Experts with a view to their exploring the region in which there exist, as he believes, the said products, and … the latter shall immediately send to Persia … all the technical staff necessary … for boring and sinking wells and ascertaining the value of the property. (Article 8, D’Arcy Concession, 1901)\n\nThe Company undertakes to send, at its own expense and within a reasonable time, to the [Iranian] Ministry of Finance whenever the representative of the [Iranian] Government shall request it, accurate copies of all plans, maps, sections and any other data whether topographical, geological or of drilling relating to the territory of the Concession, which are in its possession. (Article 13, 1933 Concession)\n\nThe Company shall place at the disposal of the specialist experts nominated to this end by the [Iranian] Government, the whole of its records relative to scientific and technical data, as well as all measuring apparatus and means of measurement, and these specialist experts shall, further, have the right to ask for any information in all the offices of the Company and on all the territories in Persia. (Article 14B, 1933 Concession)\n\nThe global energy shift from coal to oil in the early twentieth century helped transform political possibilities and forms of expertise in relation to the control of this new fuel.1 With the discovery of oil reserves at Masjid Suleiman in 1908, the new oil company, AIOC, was confronted immediately with another sociotechnical problem. Unlike coal, petroleum could not be studied in situ. Geologists could only examine the water, oil, gas, and rock shards that came up the borehole.2 The high viscosity and sulfur content of the oil that came out of the ground here made refining it not only technically difficult but its yield of liquid hydrocarbons and motor gasoline inferior to many other crude oils, and thus unsuitable for civilian consumers.3 The heavy oil could be used, however, to fuel ships, making AIOC the British Navy’s single largest supplier.4\n\nThe British-controlled 1901 D’Arcy Concession made little mention of the oil itself, where to find it, and how to extract, produce, and refine it. Article 8 simply stated that the “Concessionaire” would send to Iran all necessary “technical staff” for “boring and sinking wells.” The concession terms made no suggestion that the Iranian government possessed automatic rights of access to information concerning the kinds of technical activities that would take place. Articles 13 and 14 of the 1933 oil concession, however, suddenly obliged the “Company” to provide to the Iranian government “accurate copies of all plans, maps, sections and any other data whether topographical, geological or of drilling … in its possession,” whenever requested. The terms also granted to the “specialist experts” of the Iranian government “the whole of its [the company’s] records relative to scientific and technical data, as well as all measuring apparatus and means of measurement, and … the right to ask for any information in all the offices of the Company and on all the territories in Persia.” What was novel about this fossil fuel that it necessitated the production of new forms of expertise and concession terms?\n\nMost histories suggest that the difficulties AIOC confronted in extracting, producing, and refining oil were technical in nature. BP’s company historian, R. W. Ferrier, frames the history of AIOC in Iran in terms of the success of “the practical application of scientific principles” to local oil operations that in turn created an advantage for the company’s reserves and cheaper oil supplies.5 The implication here is that scientific expertise arrived in southwest Iran from the West and was applied to the oil in a pioneering fashion, with the effect of maximizing both the amount of oil within the concession area and the company’s ability to sell it at competitive prices. But the history of petroleum expertise as constructed in southwest Iran involved many more actors and controversies than is suggested by the BP corporate history or by a petroleum engineer’s story, framed in the technical terms demanded by his discipline.6\n\nConcession terms, corporate histories, and the petroleum sciences exclude the historical and political circumstances in which such knowledge was constructed in the first place. In practice, the construction of expertise around a new source of energy in the early twentieth century required an entire scientific community of petroleum consultants, geologists, engineers, and chemists collecting information about the specificity of the oil’s physical and chemical properties and its interactions with the local environment and population with claims to where it was found. These properties were embedded in the emergence and organization of new large-scale oil corporations in the early to mid-twentieth century and the reconstruction of an energy network that would serve as the basis for new kinds of geological, engineering, and economic knowledge.7 To increase their profit margin, oil companies such as AIOC developed large research-and-development divisions to find applications for their unused petroleum byproducts, distribution and marketing divisions to promote their use, and political and public relations departments to help build societies that would consume them. They also colluded to deny expertise to others, in particular the coal industry.8\n\nThat Anglo-Iranian oil came to possess its own abstract origin myth had little to do with the organizational work involved in transforming the world into a place where oil and its byproducts would be eagerly demanded. To say that the history of Anglo-Iranian oil can be understood better as a history of the working possibilities of technical and scientific information gathering is impossible in the framework of a conventional political or social history of the period.9 These accounts do the work of silencing the activities of surveyors, geologists, and engineers and the ways other local and government actors factored into their calculations and decision making about the oil. However, some of the most important battles concerning the Iranian state’s demand for sovereignty over its oil resources emerged within specific controversies over the exact nature of Anglo-Iranian oil—that is, its physical, chemical, and geological composition, as well as its lifespan, production rates, and reserve estimates. When, in 1932, Iran decided to cancel its British-controlled oil concession, the above controversies, combined with additional demands for the replacement of foreign workers with Iranian workers and for a greater share of royalties, culminated in a renegotiation of concession terms that might favor a national government over an oil company. Much had changed socially and politically since 1901.\n\nWhereas the 1901 concession remained silent on the question of gathering and sharing scientific and technological information about the oil, Article 14 of the 1933 concession obligated AIOC to make its scientific and technical data transparent and available at the request of the Iranian government. The risk for the British side was that this would set a precedent for other oil-producing countries, such as Mexico, to follow suit and make claims in terms of national sovereignty. AIOC’s construction and representation of its science and technology in technical reports, journal articles, and international petroleum conferences greatly underplayed the role of interruptions posed by local political communities such as the Bakhtiyari khans. They also understated all the collaboration required to learn about the behavior of the oil, to establish the concessionary rule of property, and to manage the relentless emergence of oil worker strikes in the 1920s, 1940s, and early 1950s. Such exclusions by petroleum experts of the local knowledge gathering that occurred and its historical interconnections with social and political groups in the oil regions, Tehran, London, and elsewhere have been reproduced in the scholarship on the topic. The implication in the scholarship is that technical controversies about oil are a separate issue from political and economic concerns about state and society.\n\nIn his sociotechnical history of the French oilfield services company, Schlumberger, Geoffrey Bowker tracks how company engineers and geologists transformed oilfields at various sites around the world into their laboratory as a business strategy in the early twentieth century.10 This chapter sets out to do the same by exposing the company’s business strategy through the transformation of the oil regions into a kind of laboratory for producing scientific knowledge and technological know-how about nature and society. Rather than viewing technical and scientific information as a benevolent force of Western ingenuity or as an instrument of securing monopoly control, I recover the history of Anglo-Iranian oil’s petroleum knowledge as a site of political contestation to demonstrate the interconnectedness between the technical world of oil and the social world that it requires to survive. Each section traces the ways AIOC constructed, gathered, and managed information about Iran’s oil as a business strategy to exclude rivals and build boundaries between technical, scientific, and economic concerns and politics. By tracking the oil’s transformation from a subsoil material into a representable object with measurable qualities and quantities, and finally into a publishable and generalizable research finding in London, I reveal the company’s truth-making strategy, which sought to exclude the possibility of national control and a more equitable distribution of profits from entering its calculations.\n\nIn the first two sections, I map the construction and extension of the energy network for the production, circulation, and standardization of petroleum knowledge about techniques of exploration, extraction, and refining as they accumulated in southwest Iran. Only by recovering this local and organizational work can we make sense of the oil company’s strategic success in managing Anglo-Iranian oil production in relation to world oil production, protecting its international monopoly agreements, and silencing the historical and sociotechnical activities that enabled the geological representation of the oil in the first place. AIOC engineers, geologists, and chemists encountered many problems in southwest Iran as they gathered information about the oil, evaluated it with various calculating technologies, and finally manufactured a certain ignorance about its knowability, particularly in confrontation with the Iranian government. In the last section, I examine the relation between the work done in the oil regions to define the properties of oil and the representation of that work in the public arena, in presentations to petroleum experts from other oil companies and at petroleum congresses. By scrutinizing the ways techniques of representing and standardizing oil accumulated, operated, and circulated in southwest Iran, Tehran, and London, I reveal that the powers of AIOC and the Iranian state were worked out within the specific and local history of Khuzistan’s oilfields, precisely through the management of technical and scientific information about oil.\n\nPetroleum knowledge equipped AIOC officials, petroleum experts, and Iranian government officials, to varying degrees, with agency in political struggles over profits, labor, and national control.11 As with AIOC’s business history, the company’s in-house and official scientific publications about the oil portrayed petroleum knowledge as the product of ingenuity arriving from abroad, only to be confronted with a passive natural environment and technically ignorant society. Forms of information management provided AIOC’s managers, engineers, and geologists with the tools to build a world in which the company’s oil could thrive in the midst of increasing uncertainty regarding Iran’s nationalist demands for control of the oil. This entailed the production of scientific knowledge and technological expertise about Iran’s oil, first as industrial science and then as pure science, through a so-called process of invention (the birth of an idea; technological) and innovation (commercialization).12\n\nProperties of Oil and Practices of Control\n\nIn the first two decades of the concession’s existence, AIOC geologists, engineers, and managers suffered numerous unintended consequences as a result of the extractive needs of Iran’s oil. The oil at Masjid Suleiman was located in Bakhtiyari13 territory (figure 2.1) situated within the distinct rock formation of a highly porous limestone. The geologist S. J. Shand first identified the reservoir rock as Asmari limestone.14 Anglo-Iranian oil was particular in terms of the geophysical environment in which it was found but also in terms of the way it came out of the ground. Oil production in many fields, as in the United States, was sustained through pumping, but the naturally higher gas pressure of Iran’s oil eliminated the need for pumps, at least initially.15 To extract commercial quantities, the engineers needed to drill more wells at Masjid Suleiman but without jeopardizing the high-pressure zones of productive wells. In general, some oil wells will produce for extended amounts of time by flowing due to the pressure from subsurface gas or water that pushes the oil out naturally. Other wells must be pumped to extract the oil. High-pressure zones that characterized the oil regions in southwest Iran ensured that the oil came out on its own, at least in the short term. An equally significant concern was the lack of skilled drillers and engineers to read the gauges that monitored the pressure at the bottom of the wells.16\n\nThe subsoil, liquid, and mobile properties of oil marked its particularity as a new source of carbon-based energy in the twentieth century. Addressing problems associated with the high sulfur content and viscous properties of Anglo-Iranian oil required the technical expertise of trained engineers and geologists, specialized equipment, and adequate living and working conditions. To overcome the cost of exploration and development activities, AIOC’s managers aimed to extract the oil, define its particular qualities, refine it as quickly as possible, and create a market for its products.17 The first problem emerged from the assumption, among petroleum experts, that Iran’s oil would behave like the oil at Rangoon, Burma. AIOC officials faced delays in production due to Anglo-Iranian oil’s naturally high pressure and sulfur content.18 Chemists and engineers with prior experience working in Burma were unprepared, and it took many years to analyze the chemical constituents and physical properties of this new source of oil.19 The persistent fear was that gas pressures in a particular area of a field would be exhausted too rapidly, causing other production flows to fail prematurely.20 Data on the physical characteristics of the oil reservoir, as well as its behavior and its control using various methods of production and drilling, were essential if the company was to succeed in predicting where the gas pressure would fall first.\n\nThere were many other properties to consider. For example, Anglo-Iranian oil came out of the well not as a simple liquid but as a frothy substance.21 For every million gallons of oil produced, approximately 20–25 million cubic feet of gas (equivalent to 3.56–4.45 million US barrels of oil) were released mainly as methane and ethane. As the gas bubbled out of the oil, it also released light hydrocarbons such as butane and pentane, which were potentially of valuable use in gasoline. In the early years, the gas was ignored and allowed to escape freely into the air.\n\nExtracting the oil was not the only problem. In the early twentieth century, petroleum and the accompanying natural gas was extracted from the ground and distilled elsewhere, according to boiling-point temperature, into fractions such as gas, kerosene, lubricating oil, and asphalt.22 Anglo-Iranian oil could not be refined using the same methods applied to Burmese or Pennsylvania oil due to its high viscosity.23 Through the 1920s, problems created by the viscosity of Anglo-Iranian oil, particularly the fuel oil for the British Admiralty’s warships, were surpassing the “scientific knowledge of the day.”24\n\nCompany engineers and chemists learned about such properties based on their previous experience with American or Burmese oil, and they assumed that Iran’s oil could be extracted, distilled, and used in the same way and to the same extent as other oils. From an economic perspective, AIOC officials felt that to make enough capital to cover the cost of extraction, other marketable products needed to be produced using distillation techniques to replace kerosene such as benzene, motor spirit (gasoline), and fuel oil for river steamers.25 In the early years of the concession’s existence, these and other “unsuspected problems” drove AIOC’s profit-seeking oil managers to the verge of bankruptcy. This was also due to inadequate labor and equipment, as well as to the “unknown nature of the Persian crude.”26\n\nAdditional information was therefore required not just to overcome the constant loss of capital but to make sense of the properties of the oil. To achieve this goal, the company appointed John Cadman, future chairman of AIOC (1927–1941), as technical adviser of a newly formed research organization in 1917. Through the 1920s, he implemented an extensive plan to develop the company’s activities in research and development because the whole “geological problem is still obscure.”27 This was due in part, the company believed, to insufficient contact between geologists working on Anglo-Iranian oil and the staff in London. Other problems such as escaping gas from the main oilfields were preventing the extraction of the oil.\n\nFor Cadman, the economics of oil and the petroleum sciences were seamlessly intertwined. Finding a solution to the problem of gas seepages, he explained, would not only have “very important economic results” but would reveal a “good many scientific problems connected with the economical engineering side of the question.”28 Cadman was a well-informed petroleum expert, having previously served as Professor of Mining and Petroleum Technology at Birmingham University, where he established the first Department of Petroleum Technology in the British Empire.29 The department would become the destination for the majority of Iranians selected for training under AIOC sponsorship.30 Cadman also served as consulting petroleum adviser to the Colonial Office. He was a member of the Admiralty Commission to Iran (1913–1914), director of the British government’s Petroleum Executive (1917–1921), member of the Inter-Allied Petroleum Committee (1918), and president of the Institution of Mining Engineers.31 This experience gave Cadman a heightened awareness that a host of conditions, social, economic, political, organizational, and technical, were required for the Anglo-Iranian oil industry to work. The fluidity of the boundary between the technological system of oil and its environment was constantly being raised, as was the question of the extent to which “systems builders,” such as Cadman, molded their environments to facilitate the growth of their system.32\n\nAs AIOC formulated its plans for oil research and development, Iran faced heightened problems of food scarcity, high prices, separatist nationalist movements, and a weak central government.33 With hopes of increasing its share of oil profits to strengthen its power over the provinces, the government signed the Armitage-Smith Agreement of 1920, clarifying some of the ambiguities of the 1901 concession regarding the calculation of profits.34 Iranian government officials were demanding more production in order to increase their share of royalties, whereas AIOC officials sought to limit production levels in relation to world oil production and to block politics—that is, national control—from entering calculations that shaped the concessionary arrangement.\n\nCombined with a heightened post–World War I interest in developing rather than limiting Anglo-Iranian oil development (discussed in chapter 1), the appointment of Cadman as AIOC’s technical adviser marked the beginning of the construction of a large research-and-development branch within the company and the building of new connections to research centers and science and technology institutes based in London. To increase profit margins and to overcome the obstacles to extracting Iran’s oil, AIOC embarked on accumulating more data about the oil through field surveys, laboratory tests, publications, international meetings, and in-house company conferences.35 The primary impulse behind establishing the Sunbury Research Centre in Middlesex, England, in 1917 was to solve the problem of high viscosity characterizing AIOC’s fuel oil.36\n\nAfter World War I, as Iran underwent a series of social, economic, and political upheavals, resulting in the division of the country into British and Russian spheres of influence and the revived power of semiautonomous groups, Great Britain, as AIOC’s largest shareholder, moved to consolidate its control over Iran. Defining the properties of Anglo-Iranian oil meant controlling a set of connections that would ensure the oil company’s strategic success. First, control meant overcoming the failures and uncertainties that emerged around the high cost of extraction, refining, and marketing. Second, it referred to protecting the secret monopoly arrangements of the dominant international oil companies. Their goal was to control world production rates and prices in the midst of domestic turmoil in Iran and nationalist demands for more oil production. From the perspective of AIOC, maintaining the stability of these connections required accumulating more technical information about Anglo-Iranian oil through the recruitment of experts with experience in Britain, Burma, and Sumatra.\n\nInternational consulting geologists were important actors in the project to stabilize expertise about Anglo-Iranian oil.37 After World War I, AIOC commenced the hiring of large numbers of geologists, geophysicists, drillers, and petroleum engineers. They formed associations of specialists and published their findings with the permission of the company’s chairman and directors.38 This was acknowledged in a footnote in every publication. Findings were circulated within the company at annual or biannual production conferences and shareholder meetings, which Cadman initiated.\n\nIn the early years, a select few consulting firms in London were the principal advisers of these large-scale business concerns, but their specialists were not employees of the company. Boverton Redwood, for instance, was a consultant for both the Burmah Oil Company and the syndicate of British investors in Iran, the British Admiralty, as well as for other operations in Mexico and Nigeria.39 At a time when few companies employed full-time geologists, his consulting firm was used by virtually every British oil company.40 Redwood’s “major significance” was his intermediary role between AIOC, the Burmah Oil Company, and the British government (the Admiralty and the India Office), maintaining consulting connections with oil-producing companies and equally “intimate association(s)” with British government agencies.41 He was also one of the strongest advocates of the use of fuel in naval vessels, which helps explain his connections to the British government.42 Strongly supporting the development of British colonial oil industries, he had great animosity toward the rival Standard Oil and Shell groups. As a consequence, he helped block their efforts at monopoly control to protect Burmah Oil’s monopoly of the Indian market, while also ensuring that Anglo-Iranian oil development did not disrupt this market either.43 This connection also explains his interest in seeing Burmah Oil get involved as AIOC’s parent company, effectively bailing it out in 1905.\n\nThe Burmah Oil Company had “pioneered the use of geologists in the search for oil,” many of them supplied by Redwood’s consulting firm.44 In 1907 the company began to employ full-time geologists, many of whom, such as E. H. Cunningham Craig, Basil Macrorie, and Lister James, were later to use the experience they gained in Burma in the service of Anglo-Iranian. “There was a steady flow of personnel” between Burmah Oil and AIOC, especially on the technical and geological side of the business.45 This enabled AIOC to “draw upon the long experience of its adopted parent.”46 Much of the preliminary analysis of Anglo-Iranian oil after 1908 was undertaken in London at the New Oil Refining Process Ltd., a subsidiary of Burmah Oil.47 The first of what became AIOC’s regular geological staff went to Iran in 1913 and were joined by many more geologists in subsequent years.48\n\nAIOC’s desire for secrecy in all aspects of its oilfield operations was opposed by its desire to share information to build up scientific techniques. Geologists such as Duncan Garrow, a director at AIOC (1914–1924) with previous experience in Rangoon, had observed that Anglo-Iranian oil appeared to share similar conditions to those of Mexican oil.49 The fear was that the reservoir containing Anglo-Iranian oil might “turn to water” as Mexican oil had done in 1920, or it might go into decline as with Baku’s oil in 1901.50 Garrow consulted with A.F. Corwin of the Standard Oil Company for an alternative opinion. Corwin paid a visit to the oilfields of southwest Iran. He argued that while the general behavior of wells in the main producing zones resembled those of Mexico, there was still no concrete proof of a rising water unit, and yet the uncertainty remained. By the 1920s, importing trained staff and engineers from the oilfields of Rangoon and the Indian Public Works Department was no longer adequate if the company wanted to survive commercially in the world market. A geological survey department existed within AIOC at this time, but to meet the company’s expansion, Cadman established a formal Geological Survey Department with permanent staff.51 Young geologists of European origin (primarily British) were expected to handle the “difficult conditions in oil regions for surveying abroad,” and such men must be equipped with good university training in surveying, mapping, and report writing.52 Some twenty additional geologists arrived in southwest Iran, nearly all with postwar training and many with wartime military service.53 Petroleum experts also arrived there with previous oil experience in other parts of the world and with university training. The problem was that technical experience and knowledge told them little about the underground properties of Anglo-Iranian oil. Led by Cadman, who hoped to rescue the company from going into bankruptcy, these experts took steps to transform the oilfields of southwest Iran into a laboratory.\n\nBuilding a Petroleum Laboratory and Constructing Publishable Research Findings\n\nResearch institutions, techniques of mapping, and other forms of technoscientific expertise suddenly proliferated to help make Anglo-Iranian oil knowable. In the period between 1920 and 1940, there were many competing ways of discovering and then mapping oilfields.54 This period of heightened interest and expansion in exploration was triggered by the rapidly increasing demand for petroleum, an acute shortage of oil in the United States after World War I, and international competition for the control of the world’s oil reserves. AIOC geologists were stationed in each drilling area of southwest Iran, but remained principally concerned with surface exploration. Drilled wells demonstrated underground folding, a kind of bend or curve in the underground sedimentary rock layers, that coincided with surface folding.55 Geologists named these folds or arches “domes” and “anticlines,” forming the basis of the “anticlinal theory,” considered the “backbone of geology” in this period. Domes, anticlines, and faults comprised the most important structures in these oil and gas reservoirs.56 The principal objective of exploration surveys of the major Fars and Bakhtiyari anticlines, characterizing the oil regions of Khuzistan, was to map the region using a scale of an inch to a mile.57\n\nThe early 1920s marked a decisive moment for oilfield management in which geologists and engineers could observe the “performance of a large limestone reservoir under controllable conditions,” guaranteed by AIOC’s concessionary “ownership of the entire field.”58 The extensive mapping and surveying of the oilfields of Khuzistan amounted to approximately 2,500 square miles, helping to “form reliable data” about the oil reservoirs and their geophysical structure.59 But more data was needed. A company geologist informed Redwood that there was still a “lack of maps … on the geology and physical landscape of the region.”60 According to Owen, in most oil-producing countries of the time, “little effort was made to acquire accurate subsurface data before 1918.”61 There were older scientific publications from the nineteenth century on oil in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana in the United States, but most European and American petroleum geologists did little more than “complain about the unreliability of the drillers’ well logs.”62 Subsurface geology was not adapted as general oilfield practice until 1918–1921, after which it “spread rapidly.”63\n\nThe accumulation of more data would help render the oilfields testable, knowable in abstraction, and describable in publications. Bowker has observed that the domain of an oilfield was described using three kinds of maps, each of which helps to produce a new kind of space—a transport map, a map of geological structure, and a map of subsurface structure. The era of formation of the oil, the date of discovery, and the statistical year describe three time periods that, together with the maps, combine into a new kind of time.64 In southwest Iran, for example, one-inch mapping of the Bakhtiyari oil regions was contoured simultaneously with geological mapping and with the use of American plane-table methods,65 helping to transform the site into a space of measurement that increasingly operated as a laboratory.\n\nTo this end, AIOC’s new in-house geologists, H. T. Mayo and H. G. Busk, presented one of the company’s first scientific publications on Iran’s oilfields at the Institute of Petroleum in London in 1918–1919. AIOC’s chairman and honorary president of the institute, Charles Greenway, explained that until now, “little information ha[s] been given to the world on the subject of these remarkable oilfields.” But now that their “phenomenal richness and extent” had been demonstrated, the oilfields proved to be “one of the largest, if not the largest source of supply for the world’s future requirements of petroleum.”66 It was necessary, therefore, that “a little more light be shed on their geological character,” following the research findings of Busk and Mayo.67\n\nBusk and Mayo’s paper presented the current problems with Iran’s oilfields. Their findings suggested that numerous stratigraphic problems persisted and more specifically, in locating the part of the limestone structure in which the oil at Masjid Suleiman accumulated. By providing a “generalized view of the geology, and the building of the oilfield region in historical sequence,” Busk and Mayo introduced new temporalities and spatial scales to the oil regions of southwest Iran, framed in the technical terms of their discipline, geology.68 The main stratigraphic divisions of the oil regions and the epochs in their geological timescales were as follows: A. Asmari Series (Eo-Cretaceous epoch), B. Fars Series (Miocene epoch), and C. Bakhtiari Series (Pliocene epoch).69 “It is always remembered,” they commented, “that it was only through detailed and extensive survey that such a history was finally proved.”70 To help guarantee the truth of this peculiar kind of framing of an abstract history in terms of the geology of Iran’s oilfields, Busk and Mayo referenced earlier studies of the Bakhtiyari region first conducted by geologists from the Burmah Oil Company and the Geological Survey of India, such as W. K. Loftus, “Pioneer of Persian Geology,” in 1849, by G. E. Pilgrim, who established the “main stratigraphic divisions” of the oil regions, and by Lister James, who with his coauthor, Busk, constructed “the first detailed large-scale map of the Maidan-i-Naftun Field,” the largest source of commercially producible reserves in the entire concession area. This local work of experimentation, new representations, and development of a “stratigraphic nomenclature” was helping to organize the oil regions according to a different spatial-temporal scale, a kind of laboratory, while getting to the bottom of the problem of ascertaining exactly where the oil at Masjid Suleiman accumulated.\n\nIn practice, Busk and Mayo’s research findings were helping to construct a systematic body of knowledge called petroleum geology with its own history. Bruno Latour has observed that in both industrial and academic science, there is a process of destroying one’s own past.71 In a typical scientific paper, two specific historiographic processes occur: the presentation of the paper within the history of the scientist’s own discipline, geology in this instance, and the destruction of the historical context. A study of publications, company prospectuses, and other pamphlets challenges hackneyed depictions of oil exploration as lawless and random.72 However, typical reports of prospecting missions detailed not only geological findings and prospecting methods, but also the ethnic composition of territories covered and relationships between personnel of different ethnic backgrounds.73 Ethnological conventions about race relations dominated explanations of why missions encountered success or failure. Local political groups, for example, kept slipping into and interfering with Busk and Mayo’s construction of a geological history of Anglo-Iranian oil:\n\nThe Bakhtiari country, under the jurisdiction of the hereditary Bakhtiari Khans, who lead one of the most powerful political factions in the Shahdom and one friendly to ourselves, is situated on the south-west side of Persia between the provinces of Farsistan and Luristan. It … merges north-west into the Pusht-i-Kuh country … and … the Kuh Gahr country, the inhabitants of both the latter, living as they do upon the plunder of their neighbors, being extremely unfriendly to Europeans.74\n\nBusk and Mayo set out to “summarise the chief geological features of the oilfields in the Persian concession” by dividing the subject into three geographic regions, beginning with “The Bakhtiyari Country.”75 Oddly, the geographic description was mixed with information outside their domain of interest, namely, the history of power relations between a “powerful political faction,” known as “the Bakhtiari Khans,” and “ourselves,” the author-geologists, and “Europeans” more generally. Thus, conventions about race relations informed technical explanations of how geological missions in this instance proceeded and encountered success or failure.\n\nThe article ended by attributing the success of the geological missions in southwest Iran to the geologist’s pioneering spirit in an unfamiliar geographic setting filled with political and technical uncertainties:\n\nPioneers in Persia are much to be congratulated in their enterprise, in a region fraught with many political and transport difficulties, in their following up the first test well at Maidan-i-Naftun with other wells, which have now proved an area which, on account of its richness and phenomenal productivity, entitles it to be classed amongst the great oilfields of the world.76\n\nAIOC’s representation of its science and technology overlooked the role of interruptions posed by local political communities such as the Bakhtiyari khans and all the work and collaboration that the company pursued with them in order to protect oil operations. As detailed in the previous chapter, this was most obvious in the company’s decision to set up a subsidiary company in 1909, known as the Bakhtiyari Oil Company, to pay the khans for access to their land, to secure the concessionary rule of property over the subsoil, and to recruit their followers as guards to patrol the oil regions.77 For many years to come, these political forces inhabiting the oil regions threatened to disrupt the security and stability of oil operations. As one company geologist, Lister James, admitted, evidence of oil for the greater part of the concession area was still “lacking,” due in part to the “political conditions of the country, and the lack of communication” between geological staff in different areas of the concession.78\n\nThe political conditions of the country in the early twentieth century—that is, the historical circumstances in which the geological findings such as those of Busk and Mayo were obtained—were characterized by the weak central Qajar government discussed in the previous chapter. The Constitutional Revolution (1905–1911) had meant that alliances with local semiautonomous nomadic groups, inhabiting the site of oil operations, pipeline, and refinery, were essential for AIOC’s concessionary control and the geological missions discussed here to succeed. The shift to a new strategy in the 1920s sought to build an alliance with a strong central government that would in turn help suppress any further threats from Iran’s provinces, especially Khuzistan.79 By 1929, Iranian oil workers threatened to mix questions of politics with questions of geology, demanding better wages, treatment, training, and housing.80 Political conditions were indeed one of the reasons why, on the brink of a concession crisis in 1928, AIOC geologists had traversed only a minute portion of the concession area.\n\nAIOC’s information gathering was working to exclude the local historical and sociotechnical activities that enabled the birth of the science of geological representation in the first place. Identifying AIOC’s domains of knowledge production and the problems that geologists and engineers confronted in standardizing Anglo-Iranian oil has exposed the technical and scientific work AIOC required to construct its authority and objectivity. In this way, the company could distance itself from political problems with land claimants, oil workers, and national government actors. By 1920, scientific and technical research had become a key feature of modern industry. As I discuss below, it also made sense for the companies to share information in order to build up discovery and production techniques.81 When compared to the difficult process of trial and error in gathering local knowledge about Iran’s oilfields, the presentation of AIOC’s expert findings in international journals and institutes abroad produced the effect of technical ingenuity, the birth of an idea, commencing a process of innovation in which economic, social, and political concerns would come into play only at a later stage.82\n\nThe Secret Life of the Oilfield and the Politics of Unknowability\n\nIn the period between the signing of the first oil concession in 1901 and its revision in 1933, AIOC’s organizational work involved transforming the oil regions into a laboratory for managing power relations between the British oil corporation and the national Iranian state’s claims to sovereignty. These activities were an integral part of, indeed indistinguishable from, its in-house scientific work. During the 1920s and 1930s, the question of the life of the oilfield, or the amount of commercially producible oil available within a defined timeframe, was entangled with the “obscurity of the geological problem as a whole,” noted earlier by Cadman. The company’s difficulties with understanding the behavior of Anglo-Iranian oil necessitated the accumulation of information in the form of standards, measurements, and parameters about not only its geophysical structure, but also the amount and behavior of oil within the reservoir. Questions about the exact nature of the oil and its lifespan (reserve estimates and depletion rates) generated controversies involving the Iranian government; AIOC geologists, engineers, and managers; the British government; and research centers and technical institutes in London. As already noted, this set of concerns helped trigger the largest interwar dispute between a national government and a foreign oil company, when the Iranian government canceled the British-controlled oil concession in 1932.\n\nCalculating the lifespan of British-controlled oilfields was essential not only to the profit-seeking managers, but to the British Admiralty, namely Winston Churchill, who as First Lord made the decision in 1912–1913 to switch from coal to fuel oil, relying totally on the reserves of southwest Iran. In one of the earliest assessments of the life of the Iranian oilfields, the Admiralty Commission expressed the impossibility, in the absence of more conclusive evidence, of making any definite estimate as to the life of the main oilfield.83 It was therefore crucial for AIOC to ensure that the organizational work was in place in the event of “an outbreak of lawlessness amongst the tribes,” as such a situation would “present certain difficulties which should not be insurmountable.”84 Political communities in the local oil regions created constant uncertainty, threatening to disrupt the technical world of oil that AIOC and now the British government were working hard to keep separate from politics.\n\nNew representations and formulas for establishing equivalences between the oil and future calculations proliferated, indicating the usefulness, from the company’s point of view, of treating the oil regions as a space of measurement and calculation, a laboratory. AIOC’s geologists and engineers employed novel kinds of framings such as lifespan, estimating flow, oil reservoir pressure, and gas pressure to manage and control the behavior of the oil. Cadman circulated a report among AIOC’s managers in 1923 in which he discussed estimating the life of the field.85 This would require calculating when the wells would cease to flow under their own pressure and the amount of gas reserves available for the purpose of prolonging the life of the field. Other calculations included identifying when producing wells would “go to gas,” and selecting the wellsites that would continue to produce oil by pumping after gas pressure had dissipated. This organizational work of calculation and representation would help make Anglo-Iranian oil more manageable and controllable, and thus make international markets in oil secure.\n\nTechniques of classification had consequences for the economic decisions of an oil company and the political decisions of the British government and Admiralty. Cadman, as technical adviser, admitted in a confidential report that oil reserve estimates considered in conjunction with present production and estimated future production “will not fail to cause some alarm.”86 He explained that “whilst these figures can only be considered as approximate estimates, it is the best that can be done with data available, and if it does no more than direct attention to the fact that the life of the Maidan Naftun field is calculable and limited.”87 The amount of oil underground and how long it would last under current production conditions were indeed calculable, even though the company worked hard to suggest otherwise, particularly in confrontation with the Iranian government.\n\nWhile it was difficult to “disentangle what is speculative from what is positive,” Cadman was drawing attention to the “supreme importance of supplementing the present reserves by other sources of supply.”88 At the same time, the company required more local data from which deductions could be made with “greater accuracy.” Numerous unknown variables were getting in the way of acquiring an adequate knowledge of underground conditions.89 Even when all the data—the new representations and formulas for establishing equivalences between the oil and future calculations—became available, “there will always be one unknown quantity” and that was the change in structure with depth.90 The shape of the domes, the thickness of the reservoir rock, and its permeability and porosity, would have to be factored in to infer the value of the always-unknown quantity. This general “lack of data” necessitated more calculative tools such as “formulae from which further conclusions may be arrived at.”91 AIOC experts introduced a set of new representations and calculations to describe the oil. Representations would help render the oil (and limits to reserves) manageable and calculable in abstraction, according to a peculiar kind of spatial-temporal scale. The report proposed multiple new terms and formulas to be worked out.92\n\nIran’s oil was simultaneously knowable and unknowable depending on the interests involved and the recipients of the information. The standardization of Iran’s oil in terms of lifespan helped AIOC’s information flow within controlled conditions of measurement, circulation, and access. AIOC was transforming Iran’s oilfields into its laboratory. The oil was undergoing a series of transformations through the work of a set of technical devices and measurements: its origins flowing out of these transformations and not vice versa as claimed in the scientific articles. Scientific articles claimed that science arrived in the oil regions and was applied to a passive natural element, the oil, while simultaneously excluding the circumstances that enabled the effect of this process to occur from the start. Historical circumstances were the devices and measurements mobilized by author-geologists as techniques of representation to extract and purify the oil from its sociotechnical environment and politics, but masked by the rhetoric of scientific discovery. In practice, the scientific origins of the oil were formed precisely in the organizational work of getting it out, namely, in the oil’s movement from under the ground to a two-dimensional representation as a numerical reserve estimate and outline of a geophysical structure on a map. The stability of this movement and its publication in an article necessitated a collective effort and negotiation involving measurements, geologists, company managers, local political forces, concession terms, and monopoly arrangements.\n\nAdditionally, there was never a perfect fit between the figure or reserve estimate and the ground in that results were valid only insofar as they were rooted in a particular site. As Bowker has argued for the early geophysical work that Schlumberger scientists did, “the process of getting enough local measurements to do good science and enough work on the oil fields to be able to take local measurements was essentially a bootstrapping one … a technological equivalent of the hermeneutic circle.”93 Geologists who arrived in southwest Iran came with a general idea of the subsurface geology based on older geology articles and previous experiences in other parts of the world, such as the United States and Burma. They needed to be aware of what they were looking for and then to find a correlation between what they found and the classic rules of general geology. But the uncertainty always remained. The identity and properties of Anglo-Iranian oil were not given by its intrinsic properties, because these properties depended on the relations with other entities, including information.94\n\nCadman’s alarm about the calculability and limits of Iran’s oil reserves was confirmed by AIOC’s scientific work, particularly that of Hugo de Böckh in 1924.95 What was the cause of the productivity of the reservoir rock? Was it porosity, permeability, or some other property? In de Böckh’s controversial report on the “Principal Results of My Journey to Persia,” the maps, analyses, and conclusions were the subject of debate for many years as the Iranian government pressed for more information about production rates in the fields. De Böckh had set out to conduct a general investigation of the geological conditions in Iran and to establish the lines along which the search for oilfields should be carried out.96 AIOC reports were never published and often circulated among a limited number of scientists, engineers, and higher management such as Cadman. De Böckh’s observations built on previous work by his colleagues, including unpublished articles on AIOC’s geology of Iran. The controversy arose from one of the main conclusions reached in the report, where de Böckh argued that Maydan-i Naftun possessed great quantities of oil, but “they are in any case limited.”97 He warned that “a great effort must be made to discover reserve fields before the production drops, and the time for this is limited.”98\n\nAIOC’s in-house knowledge production was not simply a mundane technical activity, it was controversial because it had consequences for the monopoly arrangements of the major oil corporations and the durability of its concessionary arrangement with the Iranian government. The accumulation of scientific knowledge and technological expertise was internal to the company’s business strategy as it served as the basis for managing what parts were deemed private or public, universal or particular, certain (knowable) or uncertain (unknowable) depending on the political and economic costs.\n\nFor example, certain arguments could and could not be made about the oil, particularly in confrontation with the Iranian government but also within the company itself. To manage the ongoing controversy over the amount of oil reserves under the ground, Garrow, an AIOC director, instructed William Fraser, deputy chairman of AIOC, that figures of oil reserves and estimates should “never be circulated to the Board or shareholders.”99 Garrow justified his reasoning based on a claim to unknowability, that AIOC could not actually say what the total proved crude oil reserves of the company were because one of the giant fields, Haft Kel, was “not fully understood yet.”100 Certain calculations about oil reserves, which Cadman and de Böckh acknowledged previously as calculable and limited, could not be made public even within the company. Calculations about oil reserves were dangerous because they factored into the company’s economic interests, indicating that the oil would run out along with company profits. Access to this information risked inviting a discussion of how long the company could survive. Thus, the operation of these zones of measurement, and the distinction between what was considered an internal and what was considered an external matter, were always contestable.101 Garrow did not consider the 22- to 24.5-year lifespan of the largest oilfield, calculated from 1929, long enough because the “expansion of world’s markets may necessitate production of crude largely in excess of 231 million gallons monthly after 1937.”102 He advised that all favorable geophysical reports be proved or disproved to get a more accurate understanding of the rate of reserve depletion at Masjid Suleiman, the giant field with total reserves of around 27,805,725,000 gallons, by January 1, 1938. Garrow confessed privately to Cadman that the estimated life of the Masjid Suleiman field was about 20 years, assuming 350 hundred million gallons were there.103\n\nOn the other hand, the science of calculating reserve estimates was not so certain. Comins, a company engineer, argued that his “minimum” figures were “very conservative,” but his “probably figures” extremely speculative, particularly for “Unproved fields,” for which “they should only be regarded as basis for discussion which can be prepared from existing data.”104 The “general bases” of reserve estimates were based on assumptions or theoretical framings that excluded certain behavioral factors of oil over other local conditions.105 These assumptions concerned porosity, the oil-bearing area, and thickness of the limestone, which, Comins admitted, “are very liable to wide error.”106 With the exception of Masjid Suleiman, reserve estimates were based on pressure data and the rate of drop of oil-gas levels—that is, the ratio of the volume of gas that came out of solution, to the volume of oil when brought to the surface. These estimates were “extremely speculative and should only be accepted as a very general guide.”107 In the early stages of the development of a field, companies like AIOC kept their estimates of reserves confidential, and this tended to remain so through the lifetime of the field. As Andrew Barry explains, oil companies maintained multiple reserve estimates “for planning purposes and financial reporting requirements, both of which [were] likely to differ from the uncertain estimates made by company geologists.”108 Thus, the life cycle of an oil reserve went through a number of stages during which the degree of uncertainty and controversy concerning how much oil there was underground vacillated.\n\nOver a decade later, the question of reserves was still masked in secrecy and up for debate. What was apparent, according to the technical adviser to the Petroleum Division of the British government, was that Masjid Suleiman “has been heavily depleted,” while the other giant field, Haft Kel, “has had about 50% of its oil extracted.”109 On the other hand, the fields at Gach Saran, Agha Jari, and Lali still possessed large reserves underground. Depending on the interests at stake and the recipients of the information (e.g., company shareholders, the Iranian government), reserve estimates were calculable and limited, but their science and measurement were uncertain. As we see below, this information was not to be revealed to the Iranian government because it would invite further questions concerning production rates, royalties, and the validity of the concession, as well as opening the door to more democratic forms of control.\n\nAIOC certainly knew that if it refused to divulge certain kinds of geological and economic information to the Iranian government, it risked losing its oil concession. Fraser approved a strategy to construct systematic ignorance about the knowability of oil reserves by relying on arguments and the presentation of information that suggested their calculation was complicated and understanding their geology was an obstacle; oil quality was just good to know about for the industry but bad for estimates of reserves that could be made public. Fraser instructed that the full details of de Böckh’s analysis and conclusions not be revealed to the Iranian government and approved the alteration and omission of certain geological data from the de Böckh report to the government. As the company saw it, the revised version (“Persia. Geological Report by Dr. H. de Bockh and Others. 1925”) had a “less contentious title” than the original title (“Preliminary Report on the Principal Results of My Journey to Persia”).110 The report also omitted the introduction, the travelogue format, any geological hypotheses, and the route taken by the author-geologist. Along with a handful of other less contentious geological studies, the report was presented to the Iranian government as “the most comprehensive review in existence of the geology of the Company’s concession area.”111\n\nAs Iran’s Majlis ratified the revision of its 1901 oil concession in 1933 (discussed in chapter 3), the new director of the petroleum department, Nasrullah Jehangir, and the geologist for the Iranian government, Aghababoff, requested geological data and maps.112 These were presented during their first visit to the oilfields, but E.H. Elkington revealed privately that the company had failed to provide maps showing the underground contours of the main oil areas. Elkington reported to AIOC’s board in London that “you will be glad to learn that in spite of one inquiry respecting our oil reserves we were able to avoid a reply and any further reference to such a subject.”113\n\nIn the meantime, AIOC also made sure that no copies of the original de Böckh report left the company.114 AIOC traced all seventy-two copies of the original report, including to whom they were distributed. The plan was to revise the originals found and to keep a few originals in “strict custody in London.”115 But Jehangir remained unconvinced, insisting that the original report be published separately from the one AIOC provided him. He demanded more maps, plans, and a copy of de Böckh’s report on “Persian Geology.”116 In response, the company claimed that they had “no copy of such report.” AIOC officials instructed that all maps as well as engineering and geology reports submitted to the Iranian government should be devoid of analysis, controversial commentary, and underground contour maps.117 The details of whether oil wells were in use, mudded off, or had gone to water were also misrepresented to the Iranian government.118\n\nAIOC’s knowledge-brokering strategy was manifested in the circulation of papers, measurements, and scientific work. The strategy involved gathering maximum knowledge about reserves to make economic calculations, while simultaneously constructing systematic ignorance about it to the Iranian government and perhaps even to other oil companies. Cadman was fully aware that oil had a limit and that it was calculable. These calculations would factor into the company’s economic interests. By the late 1940s, a policy of scaling down production at the main oilfields was put forward to extend what remained of their lifespan.119 AIOC’s production department admitted that there had been “no improvement in our methods of producing limestone reservoirs,” and “very little of a fundamental nature” had been learned about mechanisms of recovery from limestone in the past fifteen years.120 AIOC’s organizational work did not exemplify the “practical application of scientific principles to local oil operations.” Rather, organizational work transformed the oilfields of Iran into a laboratory of calculation and measurement, equipping managers with the tools to build a world in which the oil would thrive inside oil operations, and the politics of national control would be kept out.\n\nPolitical decisions were internal to AIOC’s business strategy, understood here in terms of its organizational work. They involved the element of secrecy and with it the introduction of black boxes, not only to prevent geologists and engineers from taking away the information they produced, but to block the Iranian government’s access to oil information and thus the political possibility of national control and higher profits. This work of secrecy would help separate the act of measurement from the act of interpretation.121 Technical information—reserve estimate numbers and new representations of the oil—could be made available to the Iranian government, but the details of their construction and the considerations that went into them could not be made public because they would invite the government to interpret problems unfavorably. Thus, the oil company did not want its opponent, the Iranian government, to know how it obtained a particular piece of information or made a particular decision because this would put it in a better position to ask questions.122 AIOC built black boxes “as exclusion zones” into which they could “stuff information handling and organizational techniques, local knowledge, and technical innovations.”123 Local knowledge and organizational techniques in this box were masked by the rhetoric of scientific discovery that the company deployed in its research findings. Only by recovering the local and organizational work—the politics of unknowability and the manufacturing of technical ignorance that went into estimating oil reserves and publishing the geological properties of the oil—can we make sense of the oil corporation’s strategic success.\n\nAIOC in the Public Arena\n\nAIOC coordinated local forms of petroleum knowledge, gathered in the “private arena” of southwest Iran, with formal and public associations of petroleum knowledge abroad. The first World Petroleum Congress was held in London in 1933 a few months after the signing of the revised 1901 oil concession in Tehran. The Council of the Institution of Petroleum Technologists initiated the meeting to provide “a platform for the discussion of standardization” among the leading geologists, engineers, and petroleum chemists, “particularly those of European countries.”124 Representatives of “all countries specially interested in the subject of petroleum” were invited, with funding support coming from the major oil companies based in the United Kingdom.\n\nOil companies acted individually and in secret, but also coordinated through private and public associations. The congress appointed Cadman, chairman of AIOC, and J. B. August Kessler, manager of the Royal Dutch Shell Petroleum Company, as honorary vice presidents of the meeting. Along with British government representatives, five international bodies and the delegations of twenty-eight countries were represented at the congress.\n\nThe start of the 1933 congress marked the move from standardization within the oil company to the control of that standardization through the industrial research laboratory and an International Standards Association. The congress passed two resolutions on standardization. First, a committee of twenty-eight from the International Standards Association would serve as the coordinating body with respect to all activities connected with the standardization of tests of petroleum products. Second, the Congress would be held triennially with the “hope of ultimately developing a World Empire of Petroleum Technology.”125 As Bowker has observed, this movement marked “the recognition of the independent value of industrial research as standardizing the natural world in the image of the new social world.”126\n\nThe point here is that organizational work preceded the construction of industrial science and operated locally, indicating that the kind of science produced in the industrial setting of oil operations was inherently political and helped constitute the political agency of the oil corporation. AIOC’s first move toward standardization involved the partial transformation of the oil regions into a laboratory for enacting measurements and representations of the geophysical structure of the subsoil, calculating reserve estimates, and describing the qualities of the oil. This work facilitated the control of the information flow in the oilfields of southwest Iran, or what could be made public and private depending on the economic and political costs. The second move toward standardization involved the setting up of industrial research laboratories in the United Kingdom, and eventually in Abadan, Iran, in 1935, to test and assess the qualities of Anglo-Iranian oil. The last move was the recognition of the independent value of petroleum science research presented by Cadman at the first World Petroleum Congress. As Bowker says, “rather than look for ways in which science is grafted onto industry,” we must “look for ways in which science is a natural extension of industrial processes.”127 Thus, achieving the dual goal of enrolling the International Standards Association as spokesperson for coordinating standardized tests for petroleum products along with the pursuit of a “World Empire of Petroleum Technology” was a simple extension of the organizational process that first occurred in the oilfields of southwest Iran.\n\nCadman presented his article “Science in the Petroleum Industry” at the congress and located the origins of petroleum expertise in the history of the rise of industrial science. He highlighted the petroleum industry’s debts to its “founding fathers” in science, Michael Faraday and James Dewar.128 He then noted two landmarks in the history of petroleum: the last plenary meeting of the International Petroleum Commission held in Bucharest in 1912, followed by the founding of the Institute of Petroleum Technologies in 1913. Cadman’s chronological history of the oil industry continued by noting the technical achievements that came with the invention of a higher-efficiency internal combustion engine, the diesel engine, and the multitude of petroleum products leading to the growth of new industries such as in petrochemicals.\n\nThrough a series of narrative movements, Cadman transformed the history of petroleum expertise as an industrial science into the rise of pure science and scientific investigation applied to modern industry. This transformation was afforded by the development of geophysical methods to determine the nature of underground structures. Cadman recalled early difficulties in determining the exact form of underground oil structures in abstraction. But he neglected to recall the local conditions and problems with measuring and controlling Anglo-Iranian oil and all the political forces involved, which had shaped his understanding of the technical difficulties. Two historiographic processes occurred at once: the presentation of the paper within the new discipline of petroleum science, and the destruction of the historical context.\n\nIn his historical account, Cadman neglected to include the local historical and sociotechnical activities that had enabled the birth of petroleum science from the start. Such activities included managing oil worker strikes (discussed in chapter 4), protecting the terms of the oil concession, negotiating with political groups for access to the oil, and protecting the company’s involvement in international cartel arrangements to limit Middle Eastern oil production. Working through and eliminating any uncertainty attached to these controversies was indeed necessary for AIOC’s representational and organizational work to occur in the first place.\n\nThe secrecy of the company’s technical and scientific work in southwest Iran was made more evident as Cadman proceeded to demonstrate a “working sectional model of an oil field” for his audience (figures 2.1 and 2.2). The model demonstrated wells producing from the oil reservoir and ultimately going to gas and water, according to their position on the structure. Standing at the podium at the front of a lecture theater at the Royal Institution,129 Cadman made the independent authority of industrial science as pure science visible through the representational work of a model and the various ways it could be applied to resolve technical obstacles. And again, this performance simultaneously excluded the local activities in which such “technical achievements” had been worked out.\n\nCadman then shifted from a discussion of inventions or the birth of industrial-scientific ideas to one of innovation. “Unit operation”130 exemplified “applied science” at its best, enabling one organization to control the oilfield as a single unit with advantages “not confined to the purely commercial” but derived from the “avoidance of competition,” also known as the monopoly arrangement.131 Such an operation, Cadman explained, enabled the collection and correlation of data to a “high degree of accuracy” on “uniform and consistent lines,” regarding the analysis of reservoir conditions and the calculation of reserves to ensure economical methods of maximum recovery. To ensure the authority of industrial science, Cadman’s lecture excluded the identification of all the political activities of managing information and concessionary disputes, repressing oil workers, revising geological reports, and the uncertainties attached to the calculation and measurement of reserves. In practice, these entities, tools, and arguments were necessary for making the presentation of the working model of oilfield operations possible.\n\nIn his conclusion, Cadman noted that it would be “very difficult for the petroleum industry as a whole” to follow his company’s practices.132 Nevertheless this is precisely what his participation in the public arena, as AIOC’s spokesperson, demonstrated. Petroleum science was an extension of the sociotechnical processes and organizational work that occurred in the oil regions of southwest Iran, enabling the global oil industry in markets and production to be predictable and stable. Most of the presentations at the meeting consisted of articles published by AIOC’s geologists, engineers, and chemists. The various byproducts of oil—natural gas, gasoline, kerosene—each possessed its own abstract origin myth that had nothing to do with the organizational work involved in transforming the world into a place in which such products could thrive and be consumed.\n\nThe World Petroleum Congress in London served as the occasion for the extension of the laboratory first built in the oilfields of southwest Iran to the oilfield model presented to an audience of political and international petroleum experts. Cadman concluded that the congress above all demonstrated the need for “encouraging the application of scientific principles and methods to every branch of industrial activity.”133 The “old empirical methods” were giving way to “ordered thought and investigation,” and “there is today a clear[er] appreciation of benefits to be derived from the union of theory and practice than ever before.”134 On the ground, however, organizational work operated by controlling social and natural time and space and made industrial science possible.135\n\nDistinctions between AIOC and other oil companies in public/private arenas were blurry. After all, AIOC was a cartel or joint organization with interests in the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC), Royal Dutch Shell, and all the other major Anglo-American oil companies controlling global oil marketing and production. “Petroleum technologists” served either as experts from private companies or arrived from universities and state institutions. These experts emerged in professional associations at institutes, World Petroleum Congresses, and academic and in-house production conferences. This practice and expertise was internal to the system of exchanges of information of oil companies that acted individually but coordinated with each other through associations on pricing, production, and labor.136 AIOC’s domains of knowledge production constituted the machinery of the transnational oil corporation and its historical identity. Cadman’s universalist claims137 to petroleum knowledge as industrial science in the public arena (to the exclusion of the local organizational work of producing that knowledge) enabled the company to step outside of local constraints in southwest Iran, and to ensure that relations between politics and international markets in oil remained predictable.\n\nExtrascientific Origins of Petroleum Knowledge\n\nOne of the most important differences between the 1901 and 1933 concession contracts concerned the rights of access and terms of exchange of technoscientific information between the oil company and the national government. In this period, concession terms and the construction of petroleum knowledge actively concealed their extrascientific origins in the need to maintain the effectiveness of British imperial and corporate power over a new source of energy. Through an investigation of the company’s local activities of assembling petroleum knowledge, this chapter has illuminated the working out of a transnational oil corporation’s power in southwest Iran. New technologies were responses to problems caused by earlier projects, explained in geology articles and conference proceedings as unexpected complications, failed theories and uncertain assumptions, and the need for more data. But following the activities of petroleum experts has revealed their attempts to learn from the failures of oil production and refining, and to reformulate goals from the start.138 What this means is that technical expertise did not work, as the BP company history argues, by bringing science and technology from abroad to develop a natural resource in a faraway land of inhabitants deficient in technological knowledge. Rather, petroleum knowledge was formed in the organizational work of the battle that preceded and made possible the effect of Anglo-Iranian oil as standardized and separated technically from political questions of national control. Technological zones of measurement and qualification, and the staging and circulation of this knowledge in global terms, generated spaces of immense political and economic importance.\n\nFollowing the activities of AIOC’s managers, geologists, engineers, and chemists exposes the various domains of petroleum expertise through the multiplication of journals, congresses, and in-house company meetings about Anglo-Iranian oil. Each site served as an occasion for the production of technical expertise about oil as well as the erasure, silencing, and destruction of the historical circumstances in which the finding was made possible. The final result of this political project was to present industrial science as “pure science” through a so-called process of invention and innovation.\n\nAIOC’s experts devised management methods that were an integral part of the history and politics of Iran in the early twentieth century. The production of scientific knowledge and technological expertise and the ways this knowledge circulated and was monopolized are key elements for understanding the battles over which the Iranian state’s demand for sovereignty over its resources emerged. Tracking the construction of technoscience around oil is also necessary for understanding the relations between the British ruling elite of AIOC and its employees, as well as the history of Khuzistan, particularly the oil regions inhabited by political groups threatening the powers of the ruling monarch and that of the company.\n\nStandardizing and managing technical information in public-private arenas was a vital aspect of AIOC’s business strategy in the midst of a global energy shift from coal to oil. It involved dealing with the tensions between local and total knowledge, between scientific and business knowledge, and between necessary secrecy and publication. Contrary to what scientific articles and technical and business histories of oil lead us to think, the universal history of oil was not superior to and separate from the local, rather it was embedded in local activities and the particularities of producing oil. AIOC needed to take the properties of Anglo-Iranian oil seriously to make decisions about further exploration and oil policy, how long to keep its concession, how much labor it needed, how much this would all cost, and how to manage the information to control the nationalist demands of the Iranian government. Rather than seeing nature and knowledge on one side and interests, stakes, politics, and power forces on the other, divides between social and technical were the outcome of the political process examined here and not the start."
