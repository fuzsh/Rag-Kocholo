The origins of Fresca can be traced back to a grapefruit soda called Citrus Club that was developed by the Coca-Cola Company in the 1940s. Citrus Club was marketed as a sugar-free alternative to other soft drinks and was aimed at people who were watching their weight. Fresca was first introduced in the Northeastern United States in 1966. It was initially marketed as a grapefruit soda, but it was later expanded to include other citrus flavors such as lime and lemon.\n\nIn the 1970s, Fresca's popularity began to wane as other diet sodas such as Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi were introduced. However, the Coca-Cola Company continued to market Fresca, and in the 1980s, the brand underwent a major overhaul. The company changed the formula of Fresca to include a blend of artificial sweeteners, which gave the soda a sweeter taste. The new formula was also marketed as having a \"lighter, crisper\" taste, which was intended to appeal to a broader audience.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Coca-Cola Company introduced a number of new flavors of Fresca, including peach and black cherry. However, these flavors were not as successful as the original citrus flavors, and they were eventually discontinued.\n\nToday, Fresca is still sold in the United States, but its popularity has waned in recent years. In 2018, the Coca-Cola Company announced that it would be rebranding Fresca in an attempt to make it more appealing to younger consumers. The new branding included updated packaging and a new marketing campaign that emphasized Fresca's sugar-free and calorie-free attributes. Although its popularity is not what it once was, with a history that loosely dates back to the 1940's, and commercial production since the 1960's, Fresca has one of the longest, and most interesting histories of the calorie free soft drinks, and pre-dates Diet Coke. Fresca remains a popular beverage among people who are watching their weight or who prefer sugar-free and calorie-free drinks. With the recent rebranding efforts by the Coca-Cola Company, it remains to be seen whether Fresca will experience a resurgence in popularity in the coming years."
