        "text": "ON PAGES 10 AND 238 OF THE CAVENDISH HORNBY DUBLO TRAINS BOOK THERE ARE PICTURES IN WHICH A TANKER IS SHOWN WITH THE NAME 'POOL'.\n\nCAN ANYONE GIVE ANY BACKGROUND TO THIS ITEM BECAUSE IT DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE LISTED IN THE BOOK.\n\nTHERE WAS A DEFINITE ITEM AS AN 0 GAUGE PRODUCT.\n\nPlease note that writing posts in ALL CAPITALS is considered 'shouting' in forum etiquette writing speak. It also makes it a little bit more difficult to read compared to lower case type.\n\nDon't know if this helps, but something I found on a Google search:\n\nhttps://www.rmweb.co.uk/community/index.php?/topic/9484-pool-tankers-fact-or-fiction/\n\nWhilst you wait for further replies [knowledgeable ones], perhaps you would spend a few minutes reviewing the TIPs in the TIP page link below:\n\nTIP: As a newbie poster on the forum, just be aware that the 'Blue Button with the White Arrow' is not a 'Reply to this post' button. If you want to reply to any of the posts, scroll down and write your reply in the reply text box at the bottom of the page and click the Green 'Reply' button.\n\nSee also â€“ further TIPs on how to get the best user experience from this forum.\n\nhttps://www.hornby.com/uk-en/forum/tips-on-using-the-forum/\n\nThese tanks apparently related to Wartime Petrol Rationing (which continued for a few years after the war). Petrol from different fuel producers was 'pooled' into one supply which was then under government control.\n\nThe following text is from the RMWeb forum (poster = Oil-Burner / Ken\n\n\"Prior to the outbreak of the second war the principle suppliers (Anglo American, Shell Mex & BP, National Benzole and the delightfully named Trinidad Leaseholds) got together at the governments suggestion to form the Petroleum Board to work out how to distribute fuel in the event of war. In 1939 their physical assets and manpower were pooled, and all competitive marketing was stopped and the Government took control of pricing, quality and availability - in short petrol for individuals was rationed and fairly dire (67 - 80 Octane) if you could get it. The Board ceased to exist in June 1948, rationing continued till April 1950\"\n\nThe wartime Pool arrangement is as 5Dublo2 has reported. The Petroleum Board 'pooled' the wagon fleet so that one company could load the wagon belonging to another. Most tank wagons retained their owners livery but if a repaint was necessary the Pool livery was applied. At the same time the Air Ministry obtained a large fleet of 14 ton oil tank wagons to supply aviation fuel to the aerodromes which were being opened to accomodate the bombers flying from eastern England.\n\nThe concept of pooling also applied to railway company owned wagons before Nationalisation. Certain 'common user' types like vans and open merchandise wagons when received and unloaded at a station could be re-loaded on another railway to the one who owned it. Not all types were covered by this and a 'foreign' wagon which was 'non-pool' had to be returned empty to the owning railway.\n\nIn 1939 all privately owned wagons, except tank wagons, were requisitioned for the duration of the War. Wagons which were designed for special types of traffic were exempt from this and were designated 'Non-Pool' . These tended to work on special circuits between loading point and destination, and had to be returned empty once unloaded, much as happened for railway owned 'non-pool' types.\n\nWhen the railways were Nationalised after the War the requisitioned wagons were taken into BR stock and the original owners received compensation. The small number on 'Non-Pool' wagons remained in private ownership and of course the tank wagons were released by the Petroleum Board and returned to the oil companies. which became Non-Pool as well.\n\nThe former Air Ministry tanks were shared out to the Oil Companies and were absorbed into their fleets.\n\nModern private owners,those introduced after 1960, are also 'Non-pool' and the proportion of Private Owner wagons to Railway Owned has increased to such a point that they are now in the majority."
