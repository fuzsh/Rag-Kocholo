The monthly report of the public debt which we publish elsewhere, offers several features of great practical import¬ ance. First, it shows that some progress is making in fund¬ ing, inasmuch as the very large amount of $10,672,700 of long Five-twenties of 1864 have been negotiated at the rate, as we hear, of 102 and interest, the latter being payable in gold. This financial operation has greatly contributed to strengthen Mr. McCulloch’s position, and with other favoring $11,956,000 of Seven-thirties The certificates of indebtedness have also increased $1,627,000 and there is a prospect of a further increase. are regarded with great favor, and as they are scarce, a considerable amount of them might be gradu¬ ally negotiated with equal advantage to the Treasury and sat¬ isfaction to the public. These are the leading features of the report and it cannot be denied that the exhibit is on the whole satisfactory. It has been urged that the sale of so large an amount of gold-bear¬ ing bonds privately and without any notice to the country was inexpedient and may tend to depress these securities in the market now that the nature and extent of the negotiations have transpired. It is replied, however, that in the present aspect of financial affairs these bonds could not have been sold on as advantageous terms if public notice of the sale had been given, and, moreover, the bonds having been already absorbed by investors, and the demand continuing active there is no danger of a decline in these popular gold-bearing These securities securities from this cause. ^ - Without inquiring further turn out to be correct we as to which of these must call attention to no less than views may one or two points in which the statement is less favorable than could have been desired. First, the temporary loan has been increased by $3,822,099, and now amounts to 118 millions. This sum is altogether too large to be held on call without danger of embarrassment, and it is generally wished that Mr. McCul¬ loch, at an early day, may avail himself of his strong position and pay off a considerable proportion of these mis¬ chievous and useless call loans.

The compound notes are useful and indispensable agents of contrac¬ tion, and it would have been much more conducive to the strength of the Treasury if we could have reported that six millions of greenbacks instead of compound notes had been withdrawn and cancelled. CONTRACTION OF CREDIT AND CONTRACTION OF CURRENCY. from the hands of the A singular and mischievous confusion of ideas seems to public greenbacks $466,850, mak¬ prevail in the minds of many persons relative to contraction ing the aggregate of greenbacks at present $423,435,373. as a preliminary step to the restoration of the currency, and A second point of interest is the increase of the balance in the resumption of specie payments. » By some it is sup¬ the Treasury.

In April, 1864, we temporarily reduced the revulsion, no volume of our currency by about 25 or 30 millions of green¬ backs, which were suddenly withdrawn and locked up in the Treasury; and the result was a panic of the severest kind. Now, in the first-mentioned case the contraction was made skilfully, and by methods which may safely be imitated hereafter. In the second tation; but a avoid. case we find no example for imi¬ warning of danger which we shall do well to sudden and spasmodic withdrawal In other words, of currency involves danger; while the gentle, gradual and safe method of contraction by means of compound interest invited by experience to repeat. comparative safety of compound in¬ terest notes as a means of contracting the currency is not difficult to explain. Suppose 50 millions of greenbacks were during this month withdrawn from circulation and their place supplied by compound interest- notes. The active circulation of the country would not for the moment be at all affected by the change. The compound notes w'ould pass from hand to hand just as readily as greenbacks; but before long they would begin to be held for investment'as interest accumulated upon them; and they would move more and more sluggishly until soon nothing would bring them out of their hiding places, except a tight money market.

Indeed, a few of these persons have been sanguine enough to propose that one or two hun¬ dred millions of dollars in gold coin should by some un known means be piled up in the Treasury ; and that on a certain day the government should force up its currency to par by offering to redeem it in gold. By the mere trans¬ parent artifice of offering to redeem with 200 millions of coin 400 millions or more of paper, these philosophers sup¬ pose that the government could make its paper money equal to real coined money; and could still keep the gold in the Treasury, inasmuch as nobody, they say, would want it. Every one would be satisfied that he could get the gold at will, and therefore he would not trouble himself to ask for it. This currency scheme reminds one of the renowned exploit of hoisting one’s self by his own waist-band. One feat is not more impossible than the other. Whoever, indeed, has studied the financial history of Europe and of this country? or has watched the current movements of monetary affairs with only a moderate degree of attention, must see that this scheme, if it were possible to carry it into practice, would have but two results. First, while the coin was accumulating in the Treasury, it would become scarce. An artificial stim. ulus would thus be given to hoarding. Those who neededgold fbr any special purpose would rush to secure it before hand ; and the price would go up to a point far higher than that corresponding to the real depreciation of the currency.

The greenbacks which the banks want as a reserve for their circulation will only amount currency. cent on 800 millions, which is 75 millions. When the 400 millions of outstanding greenbacks shall have been sq reduced as to approximate to 100 millions it will be quite time enough to raise this objection, and to consider how it is to 25 to per be met. Here, then, we have before us two means we can adopt for reforming our currency. First we should reduce our greenback circulation by conversion into compound notes; and secondly, we should make early arrangements for the compulsory redemption of all National Bank notes in New York. And by wisely and carefully adopting these methods we may avoid that ruinous and spasmodic contraction of credit which is totally distinct from, though it has too often been accompanied and rendered disastrous by the contrac¬ tion of the currency. I ■ii ' i~P~'i THE TAX ON BANK ill mmmm DEPOSITS. explanations of the Committee who returned on Wednesday Washington the deposit dispute between Mr. Spinner and the banks has been satisfactorily adjusted. This tax will be computed hereafter on the net deposits as was the plain intention of the law, and not on the gross deposits, as Mr. Spinner seemed disposed to interpret it. Had the tax on gross deposits been enforced it would have imposed on the banks of this city an extra burden of some half a million of dollars, and what is of more importance, this tax would have been very unequally distributed, falling with crushing weight on from such institutions as have the accounts of dealers in govern¬ It must thus have curtailed much of the bank accommodation these dealers have been accustomed to ment securities. receive and could not but have checked their business. The injury inflicted on the Government finances from this source alone during the operation of funding the floating debt would have been very poorly compensated by the comparatively small augmentation of the revenue involv¬ ed ; while the irritation of the public mind by the derange¬ ment of business would, in times like the present, have been highly damaging. of the extent day. same quarters it has been imagined that the city banks would be favored more than the country banks, if it were per¬ mitted to the former to report for taxation the amount of In some From what has been said, however, it is plain that this is a gross mistake. A country bank, from the nature of its business, can post up its books at the close of business each day. The distinction between net deposits and gross deposits is important only if Clearing Houses are established, and even there it would cease to exist, wrere it possible to make the clearings and to complete the entries in the books at night before the close of bank hours. This ar¬ rangement, however, would be found impossible in our large cities, where the volume of transactions is large; and it would seriously disturb tie established methods of doing business wyth no compensating advantage. Mr. Spinner in receding so promptly and so cordially from the position he was sup¬ posed to have assumed, has only added another to the nume¬ rous existing proofs of his ability and faithfulness in office. We do not wish it to be inferred, from anything we have said, that we object to the imposition on the banks of their their net that in consequence of the We observe with satisfaction for the use of money which it really does not enjoy any control over. It makes no difference as to the principle of this affair to say that Jones and Smith’s account in the bank books on the day appointed by law for making the Government returns shew’s a balance in their favor of $1,000,000 instead of $100,000 ; because the books are not posted up, and eannot be posted up till the next morning, when the outstand¬ ing $900,000 of obligations will come in through the Clear¬ ing House. The latter sum is not in the hands of the bank as assets; it only lies there in trust for the persons to whom it is owing, and appears daily in the deposit accounts of these persons in some other of the Clearing House Banks# It is, therefore, plain that to tax the gross deposits is to charge the duty twice over; for it would compel two differ¬ ent banks to pay taxes for the same sum of money on the bank to pay use at all or deposits. * full fair share of taxation. These institutions derive great profits from the issue of circulation, and from other privi¬ leges conferred on them by law. They are, therefore, under special obligations, and are willing, we believe, to pay any equitable taxes that may be Taid upon them. The sole ob¬ jection to the tax on gross deposits, which we have been dis¬ cussing, is that it was not equitable. We have said that the obvious intention of the law is to so-called gross deposits. A few words will make this clear. The tax is made payable by banks on their “average deposits.” Now THE REVENUE COMMISSION.

On this States, and in the greatest abundance. Without going into the details of the calculation, the Commission subject they say, after giving a list of the oil farms: “ “ give it “The total number of farms on the list is 197. The total number of wells is 3,069. The number of wells not producing is 2,328, and of these at least one-fifth or 465, would yield on the average, if worked, five barrels each per day, which would be an addition of 2,425 barrels their opinion that the consumption of refined petroleum will particularly in the Southern should be abolished, the reve¬ nue from refined, at 20c. per gallon, may be expected to amount to $6,000,000 per annum. The Commission decline to recommend any change in the duty upon naptha, as at present advised, as difficulties in the collection of the tax and fraudulent evasions, might result from different duties upon that article and upon illuminating oil.” The second report to which we have referred is on “ Dis¬ as increase rapidly in the United States, States ; and that if the duty upon crude “ day to the present production. From this additional product, adopting the ratio of Mr. Summer, Mr. Frew, and other witnesses, there would be made for home consumption, paying government tax of $8 per barrel, 465 barrels per day of refined. The additional revenue on refined, to offset the loss of the revenue from crude, would be $3,720 per day, and for the year of 313 working days, $1,164,360. It is also tilled certain that if the present tax on crude were abolished, per wells would be sunk many more territory from which a small but remunerating product could be obtained. The hope of good luck ahead—which, with the desire to keep up the repute of land, as oil land, now induces many parties to keep on pumping small wells at a loss—would farther stimu¬ late development. The permanent production of the country must eventually be obtained from pumping wells yielding but a few barrels per day, and legislating these small wells out of existence, besides the wrong and injury to their owners, has a direct tendency to destroy the entire oil production of the country, one of the largest and most impor¬ tant branches of its industry. “The Commission have the reported production of each of the 197 farms. This reported production, in their opinion, is from one-quarter to one-third in excess of the actual steady production. But taking the reported production to be the actual production, tbe following statement is approximately correct. Of the 197 farms, only 61 produce daily on 20 barrels each. Of these farms, six are on Pit-Hole Creek, and the average daily production of the producing wells upon them is 140 barrels each. Upon the remaining 45 of the 51 farms, there are 571 producing veils, and the average yield for each well is sixteen and twothirds barrels per day. If it be true that a 20-barrel well worked upon a royalty entails a loss to the owner of $10 per day, it is evident that the oil-producing business, as a whole, is a losing business, and no fur¬ ther argument is needed to prove the necessity of the immediate aboli¬ tion of the tax on crude. Spirits as a Source of Public Revenue.” It has been piepared by Mr. David A. Wells, and assumes “that the future policy of the Government will impose on these arti¬ cles the maximum imposts which they can bear without too largely encouraging attempts at evasion of payment by the smuggler, the illicit, distiller, and the retailer.” How this general principle is proposed to be carried out, we shall ex¬ amine at length next week. It seems that from taxes on spirituous and fermented liquors England derives 33 per cent, of her entire public revenue; Russia, 37 per cent.; and France only 12 per cent. over “ It may be stated, howaver, as the unanimous opinion of the Com¬ mission, that of all taxes, the most just and the least obnoxious, are those laid equally upon accumulations of capital, and the most unjust and most obnoxious those which trammel and burden the processes of production, or tend to increase to the poorer classes the expenses of liv¬ ing. In both of these respects the duties on oil are objectionable, and therefore, while the Commission have proposed no immediate reduction of the tax on refined oil, they have expressed the opinion in their gen¬ eral report, that hereafter that tax should also be reduced.” On refined APPROPRIATION OF RAILROAD EARNINGS. Given, railroad earning regular dividends, yet requiring capital for construction: from what source should the new capital be derived ; from earnings or from the issue of stock or bonds ? This has always been a vexed problem in railroad management, and just now possesses considera¬ ble interest, owing to the demand of our growing commerce for increased means of transportation. The practical solu¬ tion of the question, in England and in the United States, has differed widely. The managers of British roads have generally treated the net earnings, after providing for repairs rolling stock and interest, as sacred to the purposes of divi¬ dends ; and all new outlays have been met by the issue of a additional petroleum and coal oil the internal revenue tax imposed by the law of July 1, 1862?!, and was then additional stock or the sale of bonds.

No other course was possible, a young country whose capital was all employ ed in highly remunerative industries, than to build the roads at the lowest possible cost consistent with safety. To provide at once a rude tramway upon which trains could be run was the primary purpose. To build the road substantially was an impossibility for the capital could not be provided. Hence, the average cost of British roads and equipment has been three times that of our own roads. The original condition of our roads, however was not one in which they could per¬ manently remain. A vast amount of construction work must be done subsequently, in order to place them in a sound and durable condition. But for all such outlays the original capital made no provision ; indeed, in not a few cases, the first capital proved inadequate for erecting the primary mea¬ gre framework. The first estimate of the cost of the Erie road was six millions, its cost up to the present time has not been less than seventy millions. The cost of the New York Central road was, in 1843, less than eight millions: to-day its capital account is about five times that amount. These facts illustrate the large progressive demand for capital for construction purposes, in the history of our own roads. We apprehend it will not be for a moment assumed that these immense requirements could have been met by the issue of new obligations or additional stock. With the com¬ paratively small amount of surplus capital in the country, no of with takers could have been fonnd for the enormous amount resources, the discretion of appropriating earnings otherwise than to to grave abuse by directors. Not unfrequently, new lines are leased or bought, or a new roadway is built, or large amounts of property are purchased, from the earnings, without shareholders being at all consulted. Is the exercise of such large powers longer necessary1? Ought directors to object to submit such schemes to public approval through inviting subscriptions of new stock for their accomplishment? We think not; and this is unques¬ tionably the view taken by nine-tenths of the 'shareholding public ; whose voice should at .least command respect. Wo are, however, far from favoring, as a rule, the distribution of the whole A liberal provision surplus in dividends. should constantly be made for reconstructing original frail works; for replacing trestle-works by safer and more endur¬ ing structures; for rebuilding our generally humble and in¬ commodious depots; and for placing the roads in all respects in a substantial and respectable condition. It is as much to the interest of shareholders that a portion of the earnings dividends is open should be devoted these purposes, as it is to the ad vantage of the landlord that a certain amount of hi3 rent should be used for keeping his in to property good condi¬ But, these things being done, let the shareholder tion. have the balance of the income. PRODUCTION OF GOLD AND SILVER. of Many questions of interest suggest themselves connected with the would, in that case, have been put relative production of the precious metals. Previous to the discoveries upon the market; there was, therefore but one course, for the in California, gold uniformly commanded a premium ; its influx at that shareholders to consent that for several years the earnings time quickly destroyed this, and the continued demand for silver re¬ should be sunk in improving the road, trusting to the ulti¬ sulted in its being at a slight premium.

With the influx of gold from California France, as is well known gradually The stockholders have simply rest. adopted the course of the silver exchanged her silver for a gold currency, and India absorbed in exchange for silks and other commodities. the' merchant who, instead of During withdrawing every year the cotton at high prices has been added to other articles for whichthe war silver profits realised in his business, allows them to accumulate, was sent to India. On Jan. 1, 1866, the price of silver was 62d, or 4.2 thereby increasing his capital and augmenting his ultimate per cent rise since 1848. These facts are of interest in connection with the gains. Had they demanded that the earnings should be dis following tables which we have tributed in dividends, not only would the roads have become compiled showing the total production of gold and silver since 1847. The first table gives the estimated amounts of useless through dilapidation, but the gold yielded by country would have been all the producing countries from 1848 to 1865 both years inclusive—the denied that growth of transportation facilities which has been first fifteen years by quinquennial periods and the last three years the chief agent in building, with unmatched rapidity, our separately: national commerce and power.

The above, however, is gold and silver nine-tenths fine and to reduce them to fine metal a tenth must be deducted. The quantity of fine gold produced was thus approximately 5,542 tons avoirdupois or 3074 tons a year, and the quantity of fine silver 43,969 tons or 1,832 tons a or weighs 2524 grains and the specific gravity of gold is so many times heavier than water. Hence, a gold weighs 4,878£ grains, or 0.69618 lbs. avoird. A cubic foot is 1,728 such cubic inches, and the weight of a cubic foot of gold is about 1,203 lbs. avoird. The whole of the fine gold produced in eighteen years was 5,642 tons or 11,084,000 lbs., an amount which would occupy a space equivalent to 9,213^ cubic feet. A solid shaft 92 feet high and 10 feet square would represent this amount. It would build a wall 1,842£ feet loDg, one foot thick and five feet high. If melted it would fill 68,916 wine gallons or about 1,094 hogsheads of 63 gallons.

The position is not such as to justify any immediate re* duction in the rates of discount, although it now seems pretty certain that only a few weeks will elapse prior to a movement in that direc¬ tion ; but for how long a period the rate will continue at seven per cent, is at the moment a matter of great speculation. It is possible, however, that the next “ fourth” of the month, being the 4th of March at which date a large number of commercial bills will fall due, will be light, in consequence of the great quietness in commercial affairs gene, rally during the present year. The pressure on the money market, therefore, will not be severe, and this being the case, a rate of seven or of even six per cent, may not unfairly be anticipated. No d ubt, a six per cent rate will lead to a considerable revival of trade ; but this is an event which is now greatly to be desired, for transactions in most articles of food and manufacture have been contracted to within their almost narrowest possible limits. In addition to the quietness of trade, large quantities of gold continue to arrive into the United Kingdom fiom nearly all quarters, but chiefly from *New York and Australia. From the latter quarter, £200,000 is now clue, whilst a further amount to the value of nearly £400,000—is known to be on passage at the present moment. It is expected that as the demand for gold for ex¬ port is now very limited, the greater part of these supplies will be pur¬ chased by the Bank of England.

In exolanation of these laree ship¬ ments, it may be said that the panic which raged in Bombay all through the spring and summer of last year, and the very low price to which Cotton fell (7d to Sd pei lb) kept much of the supply from reaching: Bombay before the mon¬ soon, and so an extra quantity remained in the interior during ihe rains, and was afterwards hurried into Bombay in October, November and December, to fill the enormous contracts European buyers ma leundtr the excited news going out from the home markets in September and October.

Indeed it is the general opinion in Bombay that the exports of 1866 will fall short of those of 1365. fur it is well known that there was a great decrease in the area planted. But the se ison has been a favorable one, and we would not venture to estimate the supply below Cotton i9 all ly so, that of la9t year. When we turn to the Mediterranean, however, we find a very different state things ; the supplies coming forward are extremely small both at Alexandria and the Turkish ports, and fully bear out the small estimates put fo/ward at the Cotton were supplied by those countries last .year, the importance of the fact be estimated. It seems fair to conclude that the deficiency this year from Egypt and the other countr ps bordering on the Mediterranean will equal 300.* 000 bales of the weight of Am erican Cotton. .Of this one-half will likely fall ,npon the countries in the South of Europe that import direct through Marseilles Trieste, &c. and the other half will be shown in the shipments to England, but of course the deficit in the former case will afterwards he made up by an in¬ crease 1 export from this country. “This is a most important consideration in connection with our prospective supplies of Cotton, and goes far to counterbalance the large supplies expected from America. Should the export from that country to all Europe this year rnach one million bales, a very full estimate, it would only give an excess of 500,000 bales over last year, and the bulk of it would be required to coyer the deficiency of Mediterranean Cotton.” may 7# to 8# 7#© # | 4 months’ bills 16 do do 80 days’ bills 60 do 8 months’bills probable supplies of cotton from the Mediterranean supplies generally, Messrs.

Under its stimulus most of the stills now idle would be put in operation and new ones erected.

Three weeks ago, when gold was selling at 140, Five-twenties of 1862 wTere quoted 102f, which was equal to 73.39 in gold ; to-day, with gold at 136, they have sold at 103J, or equivalent to 75.92 in gold; which, allowing for the increase of interest during the interim, shows an in¬ crease in gold value, during the period, of over 2-J.
