These keyrings have original National Super Benzole badges which we are offering remounted onto new leather keyfobs as can be seen in the photos.

National Benzole was a petroleum brand in the United Kingdom from 1919 to 1957 when it merged with Shell-Mex & BP Ltd. although the name lived on.

National Benzole’s Mr. Mercury in his winged helmet became one of the most powerful marketing images of the 20th Century.

National Benzole keyrings were distributed in colossal quantities in the 1950s and this key ring featuring the slightly later badge design is a worthy addition to any 1950s or 1960s vehicle – particularly in the case of a car for which an original specific keyring was never available.

Whilst these keyrings and badges were very common at the time – very rarely does a badge appear in the excellent condition that these badges are in.

These keyrings were made to be used – and used in anger they were along the highways & byways of Britain and much of Europe before motorways began to be built.

This badge is a talisman of motoring days long gone before motoring as it was then became the chore which it is now with ever increasing congested roads and confusing speed limits .

When both keyrings have been sold this listing will be cancelled.
