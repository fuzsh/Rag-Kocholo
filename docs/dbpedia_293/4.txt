From the January 1930 edition of Advertiisng Display a press advert for National Benzole, the British produced benzole based fuel. Despite a striking graphic, showing a pump globe with the famous Mercury head prior to its very sleek mid-century redesign, there's a lot of text packed in giving many reasons to choose Benzole fuel!

The company was a decade old when this advert was issued having been formed in 1919 to market a post-war surplus of benzole manufactured as a by-product of the coal gas industry. The neat spirit was often seen as being 'rich' and in time a 50/50 mixture of benzole and petrol was adopted that proved highly successful. The company also made great play of the patriotic "British" nature of the product and as motoring expande dint he 1920s and thirties, National Benzole became one of the countries major brands.

The company started to develop closer links with Anglo-Persian, later BP, to ensure supplies of petroleum to blend a sit had no refining capacity of its own and in 1957 the company was acquired by Shell-Mex & BP. The 'mixture' was being phased out, as benzole had started to be recognised as hazardous to health and by the 1960s it was simply a brand of petrol.
