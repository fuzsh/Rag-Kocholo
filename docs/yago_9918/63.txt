LES SAIGNANTES / THE BLOODETTES

Directed by Jean-Pierre Békolo

Cameroon, 2005 , 97 min.

Jean-Pierre Békolo is unique in African filmmaking. Like his previous films, Quartier Mozart and Aristotle’s Plot (CFAF 1999), Les Saignantes is a post-modern, non-realistic, genre-bending film that blends social satire with a longing for change. It is set in 2025, and today’s corruption, cronyism, and sexual exploitation have only gotten worse. Two young women decide to seize the power of their own sexuality to combat those in power. The film won the second-place Silver Stallion award at FESPACO in 2007.

In French with English subtitles.

This film includes graphic sexual scenes and is not appropriate for younger audiences.
