        "text": "This year, the National Cinematography Office decided to stake it all on the film “Yahan Ameena Bikti” in the “Best Foreign Language Film” category. This is a feature film of 78 minutes, directed by Indian “Kumar Raj” in partnership with the Cameroonian studio MD4 Productions of Jean Louis Moussinga. The choice of this film for the Oscars competition enraged several well-known names in the Cameroonian cinema world such as Jean Pierre Bekolo (Director of famous Quartier Mozart – 1995) who consider it an “insult”. “Unbelievable but true! The Ministry of Arts and Culture of Cameroon nominated an Indian movie for the Oscars!!!!”, he posted two days ago on his Facebook page; generating a plethora of reactions.\n\nIn his communiqué, the Director of Cinematography, Dr Georges Madiba, listed his arguments. He specified that part of the shoot for this film was done in Cameroon, precisely in the town of Buea (South-Western region) with some local actors. But movie-makers are not swallowing it. Especially since the title of the movie tell a lot and that its story is based on a true event which occurred in Hyderabad, capital of the Telangana State in India. And to top it all, “Yahan Ameena Bikti” did not secure a nomination among the films selected for the 89th Oscars edition; whose awards ceremony will take place on 26 February 2017 in Hollywood (Los Angeles)."
