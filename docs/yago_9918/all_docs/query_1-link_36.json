        "text": "At the time of writing, Jean-Pierre Bekolo’s very odd erotic thriller/political satire hybrid about lesbian prostitutes channeling ancient female energy in the year 2025 appears to be the only vaguely science fiction film made in the central African country of Cameroon. A glorious mess, it tackles huge subjects – chiefly the systemic corruption in Cameroonian politics – at great risk to all involved but is frequently hampered by the lowest imaginable budget and some incomprehensible directing decisions.\n\nMajolie (Adèle Ado) and Chouchou (Dorylia Calmel) are the endearing protagonists, prostitutes willing to not only use their bodies to allow them access to the higher echelons of power but also to call on ancient traditions to power their crusade to bring down the corrupt men who are killing their country. Les Saignantes (it translates as “the bleeding” though the two women use it to refer to themselves as either “the bloodettes” or “the bloodletters” leading some confused reviewers to refer to them as vampires – they’re not) is an unashamedly Cameroonian film, making no concession to viewers unfamiliar with Cameroonian culture. The women refer constantly to “mevoungou” without any explanation as to what it is. It turns out it’s “an important precolonial ritual of the powerful female secret society of the Beti of Cameroon” which in the film “gives women’s rites the power to heal the postcolonial state.” (Re-imagining West African Wonmen’s Sexuality : Bekolo’s Les Saignantes and the Mevoungou by Naminate Diabate in Development, Modernism and Modernity in Africa, edited by Augustine Agwuele). Mevoungou gives the two women superpowers (making them black screen superheroes thirteen years before Marvel’s Black Panther (2018)) allowing them to overthrow the corrupt ruling elite, suggesting that the only hope for Cameroon’s future lies in the ancient past and more specifically in women.\n\nSo there’s no doubting the political passion of Bekolo’s film (“How can you watch a film like this and do nothing after?” demands a caption near the climax) but sadly it’s rather let down in so many other areas. The shot on video look counts against it, making it look like the cheapest of exploitation films and the use of songs – often the same songs repeated over and over again – in their entirety whether they fit the scene or not is very peculiar and irritating. Bekolo makes some strange editing decisions, using jump cuts in the middle of scenes that don’t benefit from them at all and the important fight scene at the climax is ruined by terrible choreography – it’s all too clear that punches are being pulled by several feet and the lack of sound effects and strange martial arts techniques makes it looks rather like a dance routine that a country-saving fist fight. It’s also all too unfocused and scrappy to really work.\n\nThe science fiction elements are often hard to discern. We’re told in voice-over at the start that we’re in the year 2025 but there’s very little evidence of that beyond an AI controlled car that the women steal at one point. One suspects that it’s only set in the near future to divert some attention away from its political satire – it didn’t work as the film remains unreleased in Cameroon, the censors concerned about what it’s saying and who it’s saying it about. If we accept the Oxford Dictionary‘s definition if Afrofuturism (“A movement in literature, music, art, etc., featuring futuristic or science fiction themes which incorporate elements of black history and culture”) Les Saignantes firmly fits right in, though at the margins perhaps.\n\nBekolo made a splash at the Cannes film festival with his debut feature, Quartier Mozart (1992) and has struggled to keep making films in a difficult financial, social and political climate though Les Saignantes remains his only venture into Afrofuturism to date, marginal though it may be."
