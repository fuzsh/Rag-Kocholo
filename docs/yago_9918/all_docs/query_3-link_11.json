        "meta_description": "The boisterous and cheerful lives of the residents of Cameroon are barely dented by incursions of supernatural power in this humor-filled rendition of traditional folk tales in modern guise. In the story, a cheerfully naughty girl crosses paths with a witch who has the power to satisfy her curiosity about men by changing her into a young man. She then becomes one of the boy suitors for the amorous attentions of a policeman's daughter. Some of the men have unusual names and even odder magical gifts: one of them has the ability to make a man's genitals disappear when he shakes hands with him.",

        "text": "This mystical tale of a woman who asks a witch to show her what it is like to be a man tackles gender and power in a Cameroonian town along with a long list of other ideas. It's a film whose dialogue is sometimes oblique, which is intriguing and lyrical--some of it is quite pleasing to read/hear--but also a little frustrating as I tried to make sense of some of it.\n\nThere's a looseness to the storytelling that allows for scenes that seem to have little bearing on the main narrative to sneak in, including languid conversations about Michael Jackson and whether he stole from African musicians or random imagery of violence on a soccer field. These distractions don't help…\n\nI started off genuinely confused by this movie and was momentarily convinced I had the wrong subtitles. Paid extremely close attention to the French (the only way I can understand it) and realized nope, a heavy amount of this film is just completely nonsensical and difficult to follow.\n\nIn spite of (or maybe even because of?), this film is still kind of a treat with a goofy sensibility and a level of fourth wall breaking that would make Godard blush. Highlights include the man who can make people's dicks disappear with a handshake and the two men who turn toward the camera to ask who is the boss between them. It's kind of like Spike Lee if he were a…\n\nFrom Beacon Theater:\n\nJean-Pierre Bekolo’s first feature length film is a gender farce and coming-of-age tale that extends beyond any of the generic conventions that it dips its toes into. All taking place during a 48-hour period in the working class neighborhood of Mozart and combining urban legend with a sprinkling of witchcraft, QUARTIER MOZART follows a rebellious young girl known to her neighbors as Queen of the Hood. During a late night rant with her neighbor, a friendly middle-aged woman known to be a witch, Queen admits to wishing she could be a boy just to know what it's like. She gets her wish alright — the next thing she knows, Queen has transformed into MyGuy, a total stud…\n\nI cannot tell a lie. I couldn’t follow all the plot details of Mozart Quarter–Jean-Pierre Bekolo’s delightful comic fantasy about contemporary sex relations in a working-class neighborhood in Yaounde, Cameroon–even after I saw it a third time. Some of my confusion was probably due to the subtitler’s effort to render part of the French African dialogue in American inner-city slang–an understandable goal, but one that sometimes sacrifices lucidity for superficial familiarity and occasionally produces outright gibberish. Another problem is that certain Western cultural artifacts have meanings specific to the oral story-telling culture out of which MOZART QUARTER arises.\n\nYet this wasn’t an obstacle to my enjoyment of the film, which is playing five times this week at the Film Center;…"
