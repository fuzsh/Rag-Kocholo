        "text": "City of Angels Women’s Film Festival was launched successfully in 2019 with the goal of empowering and connecting women and those identifying as female in the film industry and showcasing extraordinary films made by women, both in Los Angeles and globally. City of Angels Women’s Film Festival is focused on honoring films that have been either directed, produced, written or include a cast driven by women or a combination of those elements. The screenplay category is open to submissions from both men and women. (Scripts written by men must feature a female protagonist.) COAWFF also honors and celebrates LGBTQ themed films and scripts. Student filmmakers are also encouraged to submit their work in competition. We will be hosting exciting panels with industry leaders and celebrity guests, networking events and a Red Carpet Gala Awards Night at Bella Blanca Event Center in North Hollywood. We will also host a virtual panel with top UK and international filmmakers prior to the official start of the festival.\n\nOur mission is to promote gender equality in the film industry and celebrate diverse women's stories by creating a platform for those stories to be shared and celebrated through the medium of film and written word. Our four-day festival brings filmmakers and writers together from around the world to connect, network and empower each other and learn more about the film industry by sharing experiences through screenings, panels and Q&A's. It is our hope that both working relationships and friendships will be sparked and emerge through participating in the festival, and both experienced and emerging filmmakers and writers will continue on this positive trend of change in film and beyond. As the festival continues to expand its mission, City of Angels Women's Film Festival is making strides to shine a light on films that create awareness for people with disabilities and environmental films that promote sustainability and conservation and encourage conversation on these important themes.\n\nLisa K.
