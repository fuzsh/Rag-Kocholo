Essemba decides to recover the premises in order to project African movies and renames the movie theater 'Heritage Cinema'. For their part, the hoodlums who have been expelled from town and deprived of movies, are getting bored. They thus decide to strip Essemba's theater and to open a makeshift cinema in the village where they took refuge. Unfortunately, their loot is only made of African movies. With an aching heart, they project them to the villagers who love them. Essemba decides to get his movies back and to settle Cinema and his gang, thus slipping in spite of himself into a real fiction in the American style. A movie which puts on a great act and deals with cinema.",
