        "text": "How is this for sustainability? #Cameroon: About 40 kilometers from the capital Yaound√©, within dense forests, filmmaker Jean-Pierre Bekolo has set up the \"Zili Jungle Studio.\" The project, which started in 2015, is designed to cultivate an African cinema that truly reflects its origins, both literally and symbolically. Earlier this week, Bekolo shared the attached 8-minute video in which he detailed the foundational ideas behind this unique studio as he drove to the site. The Zili Jungle Studio diverges from traditional urban film production models, with a distinct philosophy: creating cinema at \"one‚Äôs own center\" rather than at the margins. This approach challenges the neo-colonial frameworks that typically influence African cinema, focusing on authenticity and local resources. Key features include: - The community is involved as active participants in the filmmaking process. - The studio emphasizes sustainability by utilizing local materials and traditional practices. - Its location allows for a genuine portrayal of African, particularly rural, stories. - Bekolo views the studio as a low-cost, community-focused model that could be replicated in other sectors. - It provides practical training and experience to budding filmmakers without access to formal education in film. The studio's impact is already evident, having produced a TV series \"Our Wishes\" for TV5Monde on Cameroon's colonial past under German rule. Akoroko Premium subscribers received a dispatch on this with more insights, including considerations for the limitations of this approach.\n\nBehind the scenes of a recent project. I am fascinated by how in Jewelry, art meets precision to give life to the vision of a brand. I think we share that üì∏ The Challenge: It all started with a challenge that many Entrepreneurs, content strategists and marketing managers face: creating high-quality content on a regular basis without hiring an in-house videographer. This jewelry brand needed something special, something that captured the essence of their exquisite pieces without the overhead of a full-time AV team. üí° The Solution: By collaborating closely with the client, delving into their brand story and understanding their unique needs, we were able to create images that not only showcased their jewelry but told a story. üåü The result: the campaign came to life with images, standing out in a saturated market. This experience reinforced the power of outsourcing content creation, providing the flexibility to adapt and the expertise to execute seamlessly. üåê See more: Are you curious about how you can transform your brand story into engaging visual content?

Be an ad film director. Ditch all that you're doing. Stop writing scripts that will help people buy one more penthouse this week, or a bigger yacht this month. Because all those sleepless nights you put in will only help someone snigger to the bank, while you just might earn yourself a very reluctant monthly 5k raise after two years. All agencies merely being the hapless conveyor belt of riches to photographers and directors. So instead of all that bickering, and cussing, and smoking up on someone's terrace, it‚Äôs time to get truly high. Join a production house. Pick up the game. Slog for a couple of years. Learn to steal from great reels from around the world, pick visuals from unknown and inane films, ask your agency to send you references, browse through stock companies for great shots/lighting, etc., copy them faithfully and put them together cogently. It‚Äôs easy to get the knack. Pretty soon, you won't have to dream about red Italian cars, yellow Italian cars, or even pink Italian cars. You can own all of them. Don't say I didn't point the way. This is the best insider tip ever. #advertising #creative #copy #art #design #film #bitm #banginthemiddle\n\nDear filmmaker, here is the general ruleüëá You can trademark anything that can be used to identify your film production company and your films. I mean anything that distinguishes your brand and your products (films) from your competitor‚Äôs brand and product. Here are some examples of the things you must trademark as a filmmaker: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Your company name, logo and tagline: You should trademark these 3 things, because more than any other thing, they distinguish your brand from other brands and indicates the source of your content. For example, once you see KAP, you immediately know that you are about to watch Kunle Afolayan‚Äôs film. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Your popular film title: if you have a film that has a very popular title, that you don‚Äôt want others to copy, please trademark it. Kemi Adetiba can actually trademark the title ‚ÄòKing of Boys‚Äô because the title has garnered recognition within and outside NigeriaüíØ 3Ô∏è‚É£ Your popular film character/story element: if you have a strong and popular character in your film, you must trademark it. A character like Harry Potter is trademarked because it‚Äôs popular and a lot of licensing and merchandising opportunities have ensued from itüíµüíµ As a filmmaker, you shouldn‚Äôt wait till 3rd parties infringe on your trademark before you take action to protect itüëçüëç PS: You know within yourself that all filmmakers should see this post, so feel free to share. Remember, Sharing is loving. PSS: Trust me, my community members of about 3800 enjoy these kind of insightful tips often. So feel free to join us by following me @Omotayo Queen Inakoju #filmindustry #nollywood #filmlawyer\n\n'In terms of the brief from Era, I knew mainly she wanted a colourful and vibrant video, mainly focusing on her and her performance. She wanted to keep it very simple only having two looks but these would dictate the creative in a way in terms of where we would shoot her. As the song is about her partner taking her for granted and her realising this to better herself, she wanted to make the performance speak for this through actions & choreo. From this brief and with the budget in mind, I decided to emphasise her performance more than the narrative and wanted to choose somewhere which would allow for multiple shooting scenes. Finding a stunning location and doing a recce, I planned out each part of the track and where each scene could take place, as well as how her outfits would work with this too. Getting Adham and The Banquet on board really helped as he was able to visualise the budget and make it fit within what I required for the video. Also crewing up I decided to get DOP Michael Richard Johnson onboard, being a fan of how he works with colour which is important to me in my work. Putting together a shotlist and studying the track, I plotted out where each scene should take place and where we could fit in small pieces of narrative to work with the tracks lyrics.' #TerryPaul #Directors #Directorsroster #LondonProduction #VideoProduction‚Å† #Filmmaking #Cinematography #Filmmakers‚Å† #Creative #Photography‚Å† #Cinema #FilmProduction #FilmCrew #Documentary #FilmisLife #Lovefilm #Brands #Advertising #Content #ContentProduction #ContentMakers #CarIndustry #Creativity #Culture #EraIstrefi\n\n\"Emotions are universal but your communication should have some character, an identity that adds detail to it, makes it authentic, physically relatable for a smaller section of society but emotionally relatable and believable for everyone. This should be shot in the local language with local kids, please stay away from making it neutral.\" This is what I always insist but this time they heard. The team Adcom and Meezan had no hesitation in taking that risk and voila! Here it is - something engaging, emotional and authentic. As I observed, people in the industry (when I say people I mean people who call the shots) avoid taking even small risks, play extremely safe - we mostly try to make things we have seen before. Anything new, especially without any reference point is considered a big risk and as result we see a series of monotonous ideas and execution. In this scenario, this concept and that freedom was music to my ears. As a director it was a big challenge and risk to cast all local talent without having any experience of facing a camera, but when the client, agency and production house are open for value additions, these bold calls are worth taking. The kids were shy initially, we were alien to them. After spending a day together we were friends and on the first day of shoot they were ready for that, and on the second day they were pros. When it comes to directing non-actors, I use my own devised technique where I become the object of interaction. I am really grateful to everyone attached to this project specially these beautiful and hardworking kids who gave it their best. This was a tough, yet the most interesting shoot of this season. All the running and climbing aside, this shoot proved to me that creating something new isn't easy at all, but the challenges are all worth it.
