        "text": "Artist Pascale Marthine Tayou shares his appreciation of fellow Cameroonian filmmaker Jean-Pierre Bekolo for February’s edition of CinéSalon. With a wholly original style, Bekolo is a trailblazing filmmaker whose work questions and interrogates the very definition of African cinema. In this five-film series, experience cult-like films defying stereotypes and bringing new perspectives to African and Western audiences alike. The series begins with Bekolo’s first film that made its debut in Cannes, Quartier Mozart (1992), followed by multi-layered films that span genres, from the afro-futurist Les Saignantes (2005) and Naked Reality (2016) to the humor-filled essay on cinema, Aristotle’s Plot (1996), to his latest film, Nous les Noirs (2021).\n\nJean-Pierre Bekolo,\n\nthe most brilliant, many-colored filmmaker,\n\nthe flame of a candle that refuses to go out,\n\na light rising in an interminable dark tunnel,\n\na display of laughter through images to forget the tears.\n\n– Pascale Marthine Tayou"
