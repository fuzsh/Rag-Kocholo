        "text": "Majolie and Chouchou aren’t able to ignore the moral double-talk of the political class. That’s because they’re sex workers, frequented by the elites of a near-future unnamed African state. But when one of their clients dies in flagrante, they must do all they can to reanimate him, dragging his body as a rebuke through a dirty city with a clean surface.\n\nPlaying something like an afro-futurist version of Tangerine, or a black feminist take on Thelma & Louise (where the corpse joins the road trip), The Bloodettes is riotous, deeply cool and full of the ambivalence and complexity that can only be expressed by genre. A great introduction to modern African cinema."
