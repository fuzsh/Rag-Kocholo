*THE PRIME MINISTER AND SECRETARY OF STATE FOE FOREIGN AFFAIRS (The Marquess of SALISBURY)

My Lords, I rise to move the Second Reading of a Bill for the purpose of confirming a portion of the Agreement which was signed at Berlin on Tuesday week—that portion of it which provides for the cession of the Island of Heligoland to the German Empire, and, as the Bill is exclusively concerned with that island, I will make some remarks with reference to it; but I hope your Lordships will not consider mo out of order if I go afterwards for a few moments into the general provisions of the Agreement in regard to other places than Heligoland. Perhaps, in strict order, I ought not to do so, but in this House we are indulgent in that respect. The island of Heligoland, as your Lordships are aware, is about three-quarters of a mile in extent, in the bay formed by Germany and the peninsula which ends in Denmark. It was taken in the year 1807, at a time when we were at war with Denmark, to whom it then belonged. Denmark was then the owner of the Frisian territory of Schleswig, to which this island naturally and by population belonged. It was of value to us in that great war for a reason that would not occur at first sight. The year when it was taken was the year following the issue of the Berlin Decrees by Napoleon, of which; the aim was to ruin England by the exclusion of her manufactures and commodities from the Continental markets. It was natural that this strange and unprecedented policy should be met by efforts to break through the line which he had set up, and Napoleon's policy was, to a great extent, fought by the smuggler. Heligoland was of great use, lying within 20 miles of the nearest German coast. It was of great use as a store for goods afterwards to be in that manner intro- 1259 duced into the Continental markets in spite of Napoleon's Decrees. Towards the end of the war, but before it had concluded, and while Napoleon was still fighting gallantly in the Eastern Provinces of France, in January, 1814, a Treaty was concluded at Kiel, of which the main object was to provide that Norway, which had previously belonged to Denmark, should thenceforth belong to Sweden. In that great contest Denmark had the misfortune to take the wrong side, and Sweden had the good fortune to take the right side, and the transfer of Norway from Denmark to Sweden was the expression of that fact. Heligoland, which also had been taken from Denmark, was by the same Instrument transferred to the British Crown. I do not think there were any further stipulations with respect to it. It remained part of the territory of this country by virtue of the Treaty of Kiel. No doubt the motive for retaining it was partly the natural wish to retain territory, and partly that, as our contest was not then concluded, the value of the island was still considerable. It was held as a military post for some years. Up to the year 1821 there was a military establishment in the island; but in that year—not a year when peace theories were in vogue, but when the military spirit was very strong in this country—it was determined to withdraw the military establishment, and since that time the island has remained unoccupied by any considerable force, unfortified and practically unarmed. It has remained entirely undefended, and I believe there has been no attempt to defend it. Certainly there has been no indication of any intention on the part of Parliament or the Executive Government of the country to undertake the arming or defending of it; and I believe there is no doubt that the recommendation of the Colonial Defence Commission was expressed strongly against any such course. In truth, the value of the island is generally recognised for any strategic purposes as very small. It has no harbour. It has an open roadstead, which is untenable in a northwest wind, which is the prevailing wind. The commercial value of the island, again, as far as this country is concerned, may be expressed by very minute figures. I believe the import of British goods into the island in the course of 1260 the year amounts to £50 in value, or not quite that. The population are, as I have said, Frisian. They speak Low-German, the language of the coast opposite. I believe there are only 5 per cent, that are not of that nationality, and they have not materially altered—they have increased in numbers, not much during the intervening period. Now, the point that we have to consider on the present occasion is, Is this islands of any strategic value to this country? I have shown that commercial, value, from the want of a harbour and for want of a market, it has none. Has it any strategic value? In time of peace, of course, the question of strategic value does not come up, but it may just be mentioned that even in time of peace it is apt to be a slightly inconvenient possession, because I think it was found during the late Franco-German War that its proximity to the German coast was sufficient to invite attempted breaches of neutrality, which are very convenient to belligerents, but which we know to our cost are apt to be exceedingly onerous to neutrals. But I will not dwell upon a consideration of that kind, which is not of paramount importance; I will ask, what would be the value of the island to us strategically in case of war? There are two cases—one a great deal more probable than the other, or rather less improbable than the other. One is the case of our being at war with Germany. Well, as I have said, the island is entirely unfortified. It lies within a few hours' steam of the great arsenal of Germany. If I am to suppose what I imagine is so utterly improbable a case as a war with Germany, I presume that if this island remained in our possession, the very day of the declaration of war a sufficient force, with all necessary materials and guns, would be despatched to it, and would arrive at the island probably considerably before any relieving fleet could arrive from our side. Experts differ a good deal as to its value in the case of war with Germany. Some think it of no value at all, while others think that it might be useful as a coal depôt to a blockading fleet; but a coal depôt, when England is so near, though it may be a convenience, can hardly be called a great advantage. The case, therefore, in respect to a war with Germany would be that it would 1261 expose us to a blow which would be a considerable humiliation, and it would not confer upon us any great advantage, if any advantage, in the conduct of the war on our side. But let us take the much less improbable supposition of our being at war with somebody else. This island is undefended, and can be defended only by a sufficient Naval force. If we were at war with any other Power it would be, therefore, necessary for us to lock up a Naval force for the purpose of defending this island, unless we intended to expose ourselves to the humiliation of having it taken. My Lords, our fleet is a largo one, and I am happy to say it has recently been augmented, but it is none too large for the work it has to do, with our extensive and extending Empire, stretching into every corner of the globe, and meeting with new rivalries at every turn. I think all who have studied the subject will say that in defending our dependencies, and in defending our line of trade, our fleet, great and powerful as it is, would be taxed up to its fullest energies. I think we should labour under a distinct disadvantage if we have a position contributing in no degree to the defence of the Empire without commercial or other value, and which yet, in order to avoid a humiliating blow, would require a certain Naval force to be locked up and kept useless for every other purpose. On these grounds, my Lords, we have come to a conclusion, which I imagine is the conclusion held by many persons, and has been held for a long time, that this island, unfortified and undefended, is not an advantageous possession, but that it is one which for a proper consideration it would be well for the Empire to be divested. But the consideration has been raised by noble Lords opposite and others who deal with the question from a different point of view. It is said that the inhabitants of the island are opposed to the cession, and that their veto ought to be conclusive. My Lords, I do not think that the inhabitants of the island are opposed to the cession. There is no reason that they should be. They have not a long descended ancestral connection with the British Crown. There may be men there, living now, who were alive when the island was originally taken. They are related by the closest bonds of language, of race, of religion, with those who live almost 1262 within site of their shores. Their pecuniary interests, to come down to motives which are less noble to dwell upon, though they are often powerful in these cases—their pecuniary profit in no way is increased by the connexion of the island with this country, nor can they look with any advantage to the continuance of that connexion. On the contrary, their whole prospect of gain depends on the large number of German bathing excursionists who go there in the summer, and that source of wealth would not diminish, but would, if anything, increase, if the island formed part of the German Empire. And it is probable, though the island is worthless to us from a strategic point of view, it will not be thought to be worthless to those near whose coasts it lies, and the military expenditure which would be the result of any determination to fortify it will form a large addition to the resources of the islanders, and I have no doubt has already been discounted by them. I am informed, and your Lordships, I think, have been generally informed, that a very enterprising nationality have already purchased up most of the land in the island. But while I say this, I cannot admit the doctrine that tin; decision of a population of a position that has been occupied for military and belligerent purposes is conclusive with respect to the uses to which that position should be put or the destiny which shall attend it. You must draw a line between two sorts of possessions—those possessions which you rule for the benefit of the population that is in them, and those possessions which you hold in order to contribute to the defence of the Empire as a whole; and that latter class of positions, of which we have several, cannot complain of any injustice if it is said that Imperial considerations must occupy a place of paramount importance in the mind of the Government of this country with respect to them, just as local considerations would occupy a place of paramount importance with respect to positions of another kind. My Lords, cession is a very uncommon event, and it is not very likely to be repeated; but this doctrine, which has been rather insinuated on the present occasion, may stretch much further than cession. A hint was given that we ought to have taken the opinion of the people in 1263 some form or other, and we could only take it by way of plebiscite. Well, if people are asked to vote by pl°biscite on a question of Imperial policy like this, they may also claim to vote on the question whether their country shall not be ceded; if their opinion is to weigh so heavily on the question whether they are to be ceded, it ought to weigh equally heavily in the other direction. But there is another case—a case which might become practical and important, having nothing to do with cessions—I mean the case where it is necessary to get rid of, or to induce the inhabitants to depart when the danger of war is imminent, and the possibility of actual siege arrives. My Lords, most of you who have paid any attention to these subjects know that a problem of a very serious kind attaches to one of our most important positions in that respect, and you would be very unwise to admit that posts which are occupied, or have been occupied, for belligerent purposes, Imperial purposes—that the paramount disposition of them can be affected because the population which has grown up upon the position has interests in a different direction. My Lords, I said we have come to the conclusion that this island is one which it would be not only, no disadvantage, but an advantage to this country to transfer, if we could obtain for it a satisfactory consideration. The consideration for which we look lies on the East Coast of Africa. There we have obtained, as will have been seen from the Treaty which has been laid on the Table, an undertaking from Germany that she will not oppose our assumption of the protectorate of Zanzibar, and likewise a similar engagement with respect 4;o the Sultanate of Witu, and the long line of coast dependent on Witu to the north. The objects of these stipulations are, of course, to make our influence predominant in these countries. With Witu we have had no ancient connection, but it has become a position of considerable value in consequence of the large tract of country which has been acquired by the British East Africa Company, reaching up from the coast to the Victoria Nyanza Lake. As long as the Sultanate of Witu was in the hands of another Power, there was a possibility of annexations and expeditions to the north of us, which would have cut off British influ- 1264 ence and British dominion from the sources of the Nile, from the Lake Albert Nyanza and the valley which lies at the base of the mountains of Abyssinia. The advantage of the acquisition of Witu is that it cuts off any rivalry in this respect, and that, save for the Italian dominion over Abyssinia and its dependencies, we have no rivalry to fear from any European civilised Power until we reach the confines of Egypt. I do not, by any means, say that is an advantage of which all the results will appear immediately, for, as we know, the valley of the Nile is occupied by another Power which is not European and which just at present is not very much inclined to make room for us. But the advantage of limiting our rivalry to an Asiatic or African tribe is one which those who are engaged in these enterprises appreciate very highly. But, in addition to this, we have obtained the promise that Germany will not resist our assumption of the protectorate of Zanzibar, including the Island of Pemba. Zanzibar has 300,000 of a population which has very close commercial connection with our fellow-subjects in India, and the more closely it is brought under our influence the more that commerce is likely to flourish. It lies in the pathway from the Bed Sea to Southern Africa; it must always be a commercial place of the first importance; it maintains an enterprising population and has a fertile soil; and there is no spot in all those waters more valuable to a maritime and commercial nation than Zanzibar and Pemba. But it has also to us a very special interest—that, with the exception of what goes on in the Red Sea, I think all the living slave trade, all the slave trade which is now actually in operation, goes upon that sea and is fed by the Arab traders from Pemba and Zanzibar, and the closer our influence over the Government of the Sultan becomes, the more we may hope we shall succeed in that great effort for which this country has sacrificed so much—the effort to destroy the slave trade and gradually to extirpate domestic slavery. I believe that in that effort we shall have a thorough support from the present enlightened Sultan of Zanzibar. We have every ground to believe that he sympathises with us in this respect, and the relations in which we will now stand under the new 1265 arrangement to that ruler will very much facilitate our task. But what it is important your Lordships should observe is that the only impediment to our complete influence in Zanzibar was the counter influence of Germany. Germany had a power in the Court of Zanzibar owing to the settlements it occupied on the mainland and the rights it had acquired over the Zanzibar coast; and however friendly the relations of the two Governments have always been, it nevertheless must inevitably be the case where two nationalities are struggling for the mastery that the struggle is not entirely destitute of the elements either of irritation or of danger. It has been said that in taking back our influence at Zanzibar we have only undone what we ourselves had previously done—that we gave to Germany her power over Zanzibar and are taking it back again, and I think that in the observations of Lord Rose bery the other night there was a considerable trace of that impression. [The Earl of ROSE-BEKY: Hear, hear!] That is not the case. I think it is well that anybody, in considering the recent history of Africa, should take notice of the enormous change which has taken place in the attitude of this and other countries towards it during the last 10 years. Up to 10 years ago we remained masters of Africa practically, or the greater part of it, without being put to inconvenience by protectorates, or anything of that sort, by the simple fact that we were masters of the sea, and that we have had considerable experience in dealing with the native races. So much was that the case that we left enormous stretches of coast to the native rulers in the full confidence that they would go on under native rulers, and in the hope that they would gradually acquire their own proper civilisation without any interference on our part. Then suddenly we found out that that position, however convenient, bad no foundation whatever in international law. We had no rights over all these vast stretches of coast both on the West and East Coast of Africa. We bad no power of preventing any other nation from coming in and seizing a portion of them, and the noble Lord opposite, Lord Granville, was suddenly confronted with a demand on the part of Germany, first on one part of the African coast and then on another part of the African coast, to be allowed to occupy 1266 enormous stretches of territory which, up to that time, had been looked upon as practically under the protection of England. I do not mention this as complaining of the noble Lord for the decision he took. On the contrary, I think it was a necessary decision. It was impossible that England should have the right to lock up the whole of Africa, and say that nobody should be there except herself; and I think that the noble Lord opposite arrived at a correct solution of the difficulty, when he frankly allowed that Germany as well as England should take part in the task of developing the vast untrodden fields of Africa, making them into new outlets for colonisation by the excessive population at home, and new fields of industry and trade. But I only demur to the statement made that I did it. It was entirely settled before we came into office. I may be allowed, as the noble Earl cheered what I said just now, to read a passage bearing on this point. On May 5, 1885, Count Müns'er makes this Report on the occasion of Count Bismarck's last visit to London. I am reading from a Parliamentary Paper— The English Government, on their part only expressed a wish that we should not call in question the sovereignty of the Sultan over the coast. They further admitted that there was no intention of opposing or running counter to our claims for colonisation in the interior opposite Zanzibar. That was what happened. A large portion of the interior opposite Zanzibar was occupied during the early part of that year. Then came the question of what the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar on the coast really were. There was considerable discussion upon this point, and it was resolved to appoint an International Commission, which should report what the Continental possessions of the Sultan of Zanzibar were. They went out, they examined, and they reported. On some things they were all agreed; on others they were disagreed; and the noble Earl Lord Rose bery was asked whether he would accept the decisions upon which they were all agreed. He declined to do that, but he said that he was very well disposed towards them. Lord Iddesleigh came into office in August of the same year, and in October of the same year he signed an Agreement practically confirming the unanimous 1267 decision of those Commissioners. Of course, I am not now speaking in respect of the line of influence as between Germany and England; I am speaking of the demarcation of the territories of the Sultan of Zanzibar, and in respect to them I maintain, though I am not complaining of what was done, that we had no special responsibility. Now, my Lords, I have pointed out the advantages which I think will come from the closer bonds which, under the proposed arrangement, will bind the Sultan of Zauzibar and the Sultan of Witu to us and the coast that is depandent on them. But that is not the whole of the African question. It is not the part of it which first gave rise to these negotiations. I think our negotiations arose, in the first instance, from a number of disputed points, but really the matter which occupied the greatest attention, both in Germany and in England, was the decision as to which Power was to inherit the territory which lay inland—the territory South of Lake Tanganyika and the territory to the North of that Lake. I need not describe to you, because I have sufficiently described it in a Despatch which was laid on the Table, the decision to which we ultimately came. The German Government reposed themselves entirely on the doctrine that the interior of the country belonged to those who had the coast. We had, at all events, in regard to the country South of Lake Tanganyika, claims resting upon Livingstone's exploration, resting on the work of a large number of mission stations where our missionaries had worked devotedly for a great number of years, and resting also on the efforts and struggles of commercial companies who had done their best to develop trade and to keep the slave trade at bay in those regions. The result, as your Lordships know, is that Germany gave way to us on the South of Lake Tanganyika and we admitted her claims on the North of Lake Tanganyika. On the North of Lake Tanganyika we had nothing to advance in answer to the argument which she based on the possession of the coast. We had no settlements, no experience of missionaries, or of merchants, and, therefore, the argument advanced by Germany was not easy to be refuted, and we could not have resisted it without abandoning the Agreement altogether. I think there 1268 has been only one strong criticism adverse to that Agreement. It has arisen from a very curious idea, which has become very prevalent in this country, that there is some special advantage in having a stretch of territory extending all the way from Cape Town to the sources of the Nile. Now, this stretch of territory North of Lake Tanganyika could only have been a very narrow one. It could not have been obtained without absolutely breaking off the agreement altogether. Germany absolutely declined to be hemmed in by our territories to the sea, and insisted on communication at some point or other with the Congo State. But what possible advantage should we have derived from the possession of, or rather the claim of possession to, a narrow strip of territory stretching for a hundred miles from the North of Lake Tanganyika into the territory that is under British influence? It is said that it would have been the trade route. I cannot imagine any trade going in that direction. Trade seeks either for a navigable river or the sea; trade does not willingly go across a continent. If there was trade coming up from the Congo district, across to the north of Lake Tanganyika, it would make for the sea as rapidly as it could. But if yon look beyond the merely commercial considerations to those which are of a strategic character, I can imagine no more uncomfortable position than the possession of a narrow strip of territory in the very heart of Africa three months' distance from the coast, which should be separating the forces of a powerful Empire like Germany and the Congo State, which is, at all events, in the hands of another European Power. Without any advantages of position we should have had all the dangers inseparable from its defence. We should have had merely those advantages of situation which may be supposed to belong to the function of a buffer. The only other objection to our arrangement in the interior of Africa is rather of a similar kind. Ear away from the country of which I have been speaking, in the south-west, in the year 1885, I think it was, or 1884, Germany had taken possession of a vast territory called Namaqualand and Damaraland, of which the inner boundaries were only imperfectly determined. As far north, I think, as latitude 1269 22°, they were determined, but north of that there was no fixed line. They claimed to go as far east as longitude 24°. In these matters we can only deal with latitude and longitude as indications of frontier. We have, in the course of the negotiations, induced them to accept longitude 21° instead of 24°, hut it was accompanied by a condition to which a certain amount of exception has been taken, and that is, at the very north of this Damaraland territory they should have a strip of territory going along the Portuguese border, and giving them direct access to the River Zambesi. It was not an unnatural demand, but I never was able to understand what the objections were that have been raised on several sides. Again, we are told that it would interfere with the progress of trade; but it is the last route in the world by which trade can pass. It is at the head of the waters of all the affluents of the Chobe and the Zambesi, over an impracticable country, and leading only into the Portuguese possessions, into which, as far as I know, during the last 300 years there has been no very eager or impetuous torrent of trade. I think that the constant study of maps is apt to disturb men's reasoning powers. Certainly the enthusiasm which has been evoked for this desolate corner of Africa has surprised me more than anything else in this controversy. "We have had a fierce conflict over the possession of a lake whose name I am afraid I cannot pronounce correctly—I think it is Lake Ngami—our only difficulty being that we do not know where it is. We cannot determine its position within 100 miles, certainly not within 60 miles, and there are great doubts whether it is a lake at all, or only a bed of rushes. I am very anxious that full scope should be given to the enterprise of men who have undertaken concessions in that country from a well-affected chief named Moremi; and I think that the whole country of Moremi has been retained within the British sphere. But when I hear the language that is used, the hopes that are entertained, and the extraordinary reasoning as to the future which is based upon them, I cannot help thinking of similar language and similar dreams entertained by our ancestors some 300 years ago connected with the well-known projects for reaching the land of E1 Dorado. I 1270 hope and believe that this is only language, and that the practical sense of our countrymen will not lead them to take for absolute gospel all that has been said on the subject of these countries; for the last few months. I will not trouble your Lordships now with one or two other arrangements in other portions of that part of Africa or the delimitations of territory which have been made there. If I were to do so I believe my noble Friend opposite, Lord Aberdare, would be the only person who would understand me, and I think I may therefore venture to pass them by. But I will say that during these negotiations it occurred tome more than once that it might be wiser to break them off altogether and to allow the years to pass over us until the natural progress of emigration and civilisation and the struggle for existence should have determined in a far more effective way than can be done by Protocols and Treaties who are to be supreme, and in what part of that vast continent each nation is to rule. But, on reflection, we could not convince ourselves that that, though far the most comfortable course, would be our duty, because in the front of this advancing tide of colonisation there are-numbers of men of both nationalities—men of energy and strong will, but probably not distinguished by any great restraint over their feelings—who would be urging, in every part where rivalry existed and the two Powers touched, the claims of each nation to supremacy in each particular bit of territory, pressing them upon the natives, getting from native chiefs Treaty after Treaty, each Treaty conflicting with the other, and trying to establish by means which must constantly degenerate into violence the supremacy of that nation for which they were passionately contending. In such circumstances, whatever the friendliness of the Government at home, some friction and collisions could not be averted. The Governments of Germany and England have been on the most friendly terms, and I think have been able to impart at least a considerable portion of their own friendliness and moderation to those who served under them, but it is impossible to impart it to those not under their control, though they share-our nationality, and are keen for the object which we also desire. It is im- 1271 possible to restrain them. It is impossible to prevent the danger of collisions, which., might be murderous and bloody; and then when those collisions took place, the echo of them would be heard here, they would be recounted and magnified in newspapers in both countries, they would be pressed upon popular passion until even the Governments themselves might not be able to resist the contagion of the feeling evoked. The happy sympathy and agreement which exist between the two Governments, and which I trust may long exist, would naturally be exposed in no limited time to very serious risks if we had allowed to remain undecided the many causes of conflict and the many questions of territory and right which had arisen in various parts of the continent between the two countries, and especially in the island of Zanzibar, where we should have been brought to close quarters, and where many questions of difficulty would have arisen. I fear that if the existing state of things had gone on the harmony of the two countries might not be long maintained. My Lords, I commend this Agreement to your approval, not as pretending that we have gained or that Germany has gained any great advantage. I believe we have gained on both sides advantages, because each has obtained what suited its own purposes, and of which it could make the most valuable use. I think we have each obtained what is most advantageous to us, but I do not pretend that either country has gained any advantage over the other. What I believe is that we have come to a common agreement which will remove all danger of disunion and conflict between us, and which will cement, I hope for a long time, the good feeling of those who by sympathy, by interest, and by descent, ought always to be friends.

THE EARL OF ROSEBERY

My Lords, I am sure it is the wish of those who sit beside me on this Bench to acknowledge in the fullest and the freest manner the fair and conciliatory statement which the noble Marquess has laid before the House, and certainly it is not our wish to pick small holes in an Agreement of this Fast character. If it were, as the noble Marquess said in his concluding remarks, 1272 a one-sided Agreement, in which: one side had got all the benefit and the other was conscious only of loss, that Agreement would have no chance of being permanent, and, in my opinion, would be a greater misfortune than no Agreement at all. But perhaps it may be permitted when one looks back a few years to envy, for a moment, the powers of pungent sarcasm enjoyed by the noble Marquess, and to reflect without acrimony on what would have been said if Mr. Gladstone's Government had submitted an Agreement of this description to the House. I do not wish, however, to pursue that subject, and in all that I desire to say—and it will not be long—I only wish to put forward one or two points of not, I hope, unfriendly criticism of the Agreement, and not to carp at or cavil with an arrangement which must in any case, to whomsoever falls the advantage, conduce so largely to the present and future friendship of two great countries. Now, my Lords, I take it that the noble Marquess has put the case very clearly before us in stating that in exchange for the cession of Heligoland, which, of course, in itself is a strange and unusual incident, the main compensation we have received is in connection with Zanzibar. It is with those two points that I propose mainly to deal this evening. I do not wish in any detail to deal with this vast Agreement for mapping out and apportioning Africa, which, to many, forms the central point of interest. My feeling as regards this Agreement is this: that, as the noble Marquess said on a former occasion, we should have larger maps in order to appreciate their importance, and also that on this vast continent there is ample room for all the colonising nations of the world. But I would make two remarks with respect to these Agreements, and the first is, that whatever their merits may be, they are an entirely new feature in European diplomacy, or rather, they are a revival of that form of apportionment by which Pope Alexander VI. mapped out the new world between Spain and Portugal. Of course, such Agreements may be necessary; they may, as the noble Marquess said, be better than no Agreement at all; but, at the same time, they have their bad side too, and they cannot but produce in many quarters a certain feeling of jealousy and discontent 1273 among those nations who are not party to them. I confess I believe it would be to the advantage of all parties if Agreements as to apportionments of this kind could be submitted to some formal Conference or Congress, so that they might receive the sanction of the communities of Europe at large. The second point I would call your Lordships' attention to in connection with them is this: that these apportionments ought not to be taken for more than they are. They bind only the two Powers that are parties to them. If I am right in so thinking, they are rather in the nature of influence than in the nature of possession; they confer rather protection than dominion; and, in that respect, I think some misleading language has been used with regard to this Agreement. I think it was the right rev. Prelate who spoke the other day of the policy which had added an Empire to an Empire, but I think even the noble Marquess would disclaim such language as that; and though the great explorer to whom we are indebted for our knowledge of so much of this territory has used language of that character, I presume it is not to be taken as either diplomatic or exact or political. But I will say this, I do not wish now to deal with the large African questions involved in this Agreement. I desire rather to deal with the two points which are practically before us—the cession of Heligoland and the counter balancing advantage which we are supposed to have received in Zanzibar. With regard to Heligoland, the noble Marquess gave us a most picturesque view of our acquisition of that island, but I think that in some respects his subsequent remarks tended a little to contradict themselves. He is against, as I understand him, consulting the inhabitants of a place which we hold for belligerent purposes; and, on the other hand, he tells us there are no belligerent advantages in Heligoland. I do not quite understand how he can reconcile those two statements. But I come to the point of what the strategic value of Heligoland really is. I do not think that we on this side have any theoretical objection to the cession of territory, quâ cession of territory, if the general advantage of the Empire results there from. But I think we have a right to demand that one or two con- 1274 ditions shall be fulfilled, and one of those conditions is that in an island which, after all, is so near our shores, we should be quite sure that we are not giving away any military or naval advantage which is essential to us. Well, I confess I never meddle with the opinions of naval or military experts. Those opinions of naval and military experts must rest upon their own foundation and be judged according to their intrinsic merit. But we have never seen the opinions of the naval and military experts on this occasion. I believe they have been confided by the First Lord of the Treasury in another place to an indiscreet follower, who only gave us an appetite for more by alluding to them on a postcard to one of his constituents. At any rate, I think we may refer back to a Despatch written by Admiral Russell in 1807 when he took the island. He said that— With a small expense this island could be-made a second Gibraltar; it is a key to the Rivers Ems, Elbe, Weser, Wesel, and Meuse. I do not say this convinces me in the slightest degree, but I say that, in the absence of opinions of existing naval and military authorities it is almost all we have to depend upon. But we have other opinions, not exactly naval and military, but traditional in their character, which may help us in this connection, and, as the noble Marquess has chosen to unite the questions of the belligerent importance of Heligoland and the wishes of the inhabitants, I must say I am not aware that any of us on this side of the House would wish that a plebiscite should be taken of the wishes of the Heligolanders in regard to this cession, whether they wished to be parted from this Empire or not. But we do hold as a condition of the proper consideration of a question like this that the opinions of the inhabitants of any part of the Empire which we think it necessary for Imperial motives to dissever ourselves from should not be so absolutely disregarded as they have been, so far as we know, in the present transaction. The noble Marquess the other day, when pressed upon this point, said that he had ascertained the wishes of the inhabitants. I do not pretend to have ascertained the wishes of the inhabitants myself, but we have as yet failed to find out exactly how the 1275 noble Marquess arrived at the conclusion which, he has confided to us. All the rumours which we have heard are adverse to the notion that the wish of these people is that they should be dissevered from this Empire, under which they have enjoyed such great benefits. I know it is said that they are only a population of 2,000, and what does the feeling matter of a population of 2,000 in a transaction of this kind? I want to know what is the test of population which you are to apply to the patriotism of the various peoples of this Empire. If you say that 2,000 is a limit which is not to be considered, you have two of the Channel Islands, one of which has a smaller population than 2,000, and the other hardly reaches a quarter of that population. But I go a little further than that, and I say, whether you have 2,000 souls or one soul, you have some right to be considered in the transfer of your person and the territory in which you live from the flag under which you were born. I venture to say that the noble Marquess himself, great as is his power and his abilities, is only one person and one soul, and I do not think that he would very much care to be transferred against his will with the territory in which he lives to the dominion of a foreign Power. But I do not wish to dwell at all upon or to bandy words with the noble Marquess as to what he thinks the wishes of the Heligolanders may be in this matter. I think we have information of a character which the noble Marquess himself will admit to be authentic with regard both to the strategic value of Heligoland and the wishes of the Heligolanders. In a speech which was delivered in 1885 a distinguished Member of Her Majesty's Government said— He had listened to the speech of the hon. and learned Member (Mr. Gorst) with some surprise —the Government was apparently rather divided upon the question at that time.

THE EARL OF ROSEBERY

Quite so; but evidently the present Members of the Government, unless they have since very much changed their opinions, were very much at issue on that point— For there was a most extraordinary omission in that speech. The hon. and learned Member 1276 had spoken of the ardent desire of the German people to have possession of Heligoland, but he had quite forgotten to refer to the feelings of the Heligolanders upon this point. He was satisfied that there was no desire on the part of the people of Heligoland for the proposed annexation. They had prospered and thrived under English rule, and he was certain they did not desire to come under German rule or German Law, including conscription for military service. He was not prepared to sacrifice these people for the purpose of pleasing and conciliating the German people, however desirable it might be to do so. The hon. and learned Member had stated that from a strategical point of view Heligoland was no use to this country. He was disposed to contradict that opinion even upon the hon. and learned Member's own statement as to the position of Heligoland, but he had the honour of having served on a Royal Commission on Colonial Defences and the Protection of Trade, and although their proceedings and the Report were strictly confidential, yet it would be no breach of that confidence to say that, at all events, some persons of experience entertained contrary views to that of the hon. and learned Member. I am not prepared to go so far as that speech, but that is the speech of the present Secretary for the Colonies, under whose amiable and genial rule Heligoland is at present existing, and I hope that at some later moment of the Debate he will give us some explanation of what it is that has caused him to change his views, both as to the strategical importance of Heligoland, and as to the wishes of the Heligolanders. On the same occasion we have another Member of the present Government, Sir M. Hicks Beach, to the fore, saying— He was much astonished when he saw the notice of Motion of his hon. and learned Friend, which appeared rather as a trap for Her Majesty's Government, —if Sir Michael Hicks Beach could have foreseen the present condition of things, he would have known what Government it was a trap for— And he congratulated them that they had escaped the snare. He was very glad that the proposal had practically received no support in the House. As to the point that the island was of no use to us, it had been shown by the noble Lord and others, who had taken part in the Debate, that Heligoland was of great importance to our fisheries in the North Sea. As to the feelings of the people of Heligoland, when he was at the Colonial Office, so far from there being any desire on their part to sever themselves from the British Empire, they were exceedingly well pleased to be connected with England rather than with Germany. My Lords, I do not think I can add anything to the weight of those opinions, or 1277 to the pungency and force with which they are expressed. They are all, I venture to say, practical upon the point whether the island of Heligoland is of strategical importance, and as to whether the wishes of the Heligolanders should he in any degree consulted on the subject of their transfer. There is another condition which I think, in the opinion of the people of this country, would attach to any such cession of territory as has been made in this instance, and that is, that there should be no breach of faith on our part. Now, I cannot say whether there has been any breach of faith here or not; but it is asserted that by the 10th Article of the Capitulation of 1807 it was provided that the natives of Heligoland should be permanently exempted from any naval service in the future. Whether that pledge has been given, and whether, if given, it has been safeguarded by the noble Marquess in the present Agreement, is a point upon which we shall no doubt receive information farther on. As to that Capitulation, I may say that my interest in it is not newly sprung from the incidents of the cession. I moved for a copy of that Capitulation in this House in 1876, and I remember that my noble and lamented Friend Lord Carnarvon—whom I cannot mention on a subject like this without expressing what I am sure has been the feeling of the whole House during the past fortnight as to the loss this House has sustained through his untimely death—refused to give me that Capitulation, because he said it contained much perilous matter. In consequence, I have never been able to trace or see that document. I do not know whether the noble Marquess will be more liberal now that Heligoland is about to pass away from us. I suppose the least condition that any Parliament would be disposed to attach to a cession of this kind is that we should receive adequate and ample compensation for a sacrifice not so much of territory as of amour propre. Well, the equivalent for the cession of Heligoland is to be found, we know, in Zanzibar. The noble Marquess has devoted some attention to what I have said on the subject of Zanzibar. I insinuated something and I cheered something else the noble Marquess said; and from that the noble Marquess drew something of a most portentous kind. 1278 Let me see what I really did say. I said that "the Sultanate of Zanzibar, which the noble Marquess is now acquiring by the cession of Heligoland is not by any means the Sultanate of Zanzibar which we left behind us when we left office in 1886." I must complain a little, I confess, of the language of the noble Marquess on this subject. We were left until the day these Papers appeared with nothing but the Despatch of the noble Marquess to guide us with regard to the Agreement into which he had entered. In that Despatch to Sir E. Malet of the 14th of June, 1890, the noble Marquess says— England will further assume, with the consent of the Sultan of Zanzibar (which has been given), the exclusive protectorate over that Sultanate, including the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba. That I felt to be good news. I did not know much about the rest of the Agreement, but I ventured, in order to make assurance perfectly sure, to place a question on the Paper asking exactly what was meant by the "Sultanate of Zanzibar," but being oh that afternoon occupied with the more august duties of the London County Council, I had to ask my noble Friend Lord Kimberley to put that question for me. The question was this:— The exact meaning of the expression 'Sultanate of Zanzibar' used in Lord Salisbury's Despatch of June 14th, 1890? The noble Marquess answered that The word 'Sultanate' bears the same relation to Sultan as the word 'monarchy' does to monarch. The protectorate of Zanzibar means the protectorate over the territory which is under the government of the Sultan of Zanzibar or under his suzerainty. Well, that is a perfectly clear statement. That means Zanzibar and Pemba and some 500 or 600 miles of coast, though only of a depth, it is true, of 10 miles on the mainland, which are all under the suzerainty of the Sultan of Zanzibar. The noble Marquess made this more clear in a subsequent answer, in which he said that this sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar over these hundreds of miles of mainland was perfectly clear and undisputed, but, by a somewhat unfortunate metaphor, as I think, he added that for a part of it the Sultan of Zanzibar had in the German Empire a tenant who understood his relations to the Sultan somewhat more in the way that tenancies are 1279 understood in the Sister Island than as they are regarded in this country. Then, my Lords, we had arrived at this point. From the Despatch we knew that we were to take over the protectorate of the whole Sultanate of Zanzibar, and also from the noble Marquess we had got a definition that the word "Sultanate" implied everything over which the Sultan of Zanzibar had sovereignty or suzerainty. We had, further, this concession from him—that the whole of the coast line opposite to Zanzibar was held under that Sultan's suzerainty. Surely the conclusion was irresistible—we came naturally to the conclusion that all that line of coast which we left under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Zanzibar when we left Office in 1886 was to be transferred to the protectorate of the British Crown by this Agreement. My Lords, what is the case? We gain information only by instalments, and though we thought the information satisfactory as far as it went, our anxiety was rudely put an end to by the publication of the Treaty. Not merely does the Treaty not give us anything of the kind; not merely does the Treaty in a most emphatic way contradict the statement of the noble Marquess in his covering Despatch, but it actually makes out that so far from assuming this protectorate, we are to assist in every way the transfer of the whole of the territory of the Sultan of Zanzibar on the mainland opposite the island to Germany. What are the words of the Treaty? Article 11 of the Treaty says— Great Britain engages to use all her influence to facilitate the friendly arrangements by which the Sultan of Zanzibar shall cede absolutely to Germany his possessions on the mainland comprised in existing concessions to the German East Africa Company and their dependencies, as well as the Island of Mafia. No protectorate; but he "shall cede absolutely to Germany" his possessions on the mainland. I venture to say that, under those circumstances, the expression used by the noble Marquess in his Despatch was not one that was accurate, or that was calculated to convey a real impression of Article 11.

THE EARL OF ROSEBERY

Yes, I have marked the passage. Therefore, I think under these circumstances it 1280 is not an illegitimate conclusion to arrive at that the sultanate of Zanzibar has suffered material detriment since we left Office in 1886. But the noble Marquess resents that conclusion. He says— I do not think any diminution of the prestige or the power of the Sultan of Zanzibar can be laid to our charge. The diminution of the Sultanate of Zanzibar, as far as it is diminished on the coast at all, is, I am afraid, rightly or wrongly, entirely the work of the noble Marquess, and, therefore, I cannot understand his using the language of injured innocence with regard to that transaction. But I am not disposed to rest this matter entirely on figures or Treaties alone. We have had the advantage of the indiscretion of one of the most remarkable Members of the Government, though he has since ceased to be a Member of the Government—the noble Lord who was leader of the House of Commons at the time this course of policy was inaugurated, and who has given us a full, free, and candid, but I think a somewhat indiscreet, revelation of what has taken place in a speech delivered at Birmingham in July, 1889. Lord Randolph Churchill said— Now the price we have paid all along to the German Chancellor since we occupied Egypt for the support of the German Government in our policy there has been one concession after another to the colonial policy of Germany. Now the colonial policy of Germany is essentially an aggressive policy. I will give you one instance of the price which we paid for the support of the German Government in Egypt. It happened at a lime when I was in the Government, and in saying what I do I do not wish to blame the Government; or if the Government is to be blamed, I take as much blame on myself as being a part of it as may be necessary or proper. But this is what took place. The support of the German Government in Egypt was necessary to our policy. The German Government had designs on Zanzibar. Our position there at that very moment was one of immense value and strength. That was when we left Office in 1886. The whole of the tribes of that part of Africa were under our influence, and were looking up to us, and were determined to be guided by us. We held at Zanzibar the key to all the commercial development of the great African territory. Well, in order to gain. Prince Bismarck's support for our Egyptian police we had to give up our position of predominance at Zanzibar. We practically ruined almost, but certainly most seriously damaged ourselves with that part of Africa, the commerce of which, at that time, was valued at 1281 upwards of.£3,000,000 a year. And we know perfectly well that the state of that part of Africa at the present moment, owing to German designs and owing to German enterprise, is one of utter confusion, utter insecurity, and one where commercial relations cannot, possibly tranquilly prevail. Now that is one price we had to pay for the Egyptian policy. He goes on to make some remarks with regard to the Government policy as to Samoa which I will not read at this moment, but which are not devoid of interest to those who have followed the course of events in that island. I think I have proved, out of the month of the noble Marquess himself, from his own Treaty, and out of the mouth of his own Colleague the Leader of the House of Commons at the time of the Treaty concluded by Lord Iddesleigh in October, 1886, that there has been a considerable diminution in the prestige and influence of the Sultan of Zanzibar under the auspices of the present Government. And I think I will go a little further than that. I will lay down this position—that if, by the cession of the island of Heligoland, we are as the noble Marquess has told us, receiving as our equivalent the islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, we are only by this cession of British territory—which is, with Malta and Gibraltar, our only remaining European asset from the great war with Napoleon and France, which cost us about a thousand millions and, innumerable lives—we are only re-acquiring a small portion of what the Government of Mr. Gladstone left behind them under the full control of Great Britain. I do hot 'think that this is of itself an overwhelming position, but it certainly puts the concession in a grave light. But I will return to the phrase of the noble Marquess, to which I attach so much importance, and take this Agreement from a different point of view. He says that— England will further assume, with the consent of the Sultan of Zanzibar (which has been given) the exclusive protectorate of that Sultanate, including the islands of Zanzibar and pemba, and that this assumption will he made with the full concurrence of Germany. What I have to ask about that is—When did France disappear from the position of a Guaranteeing Power with regard to Zanzibar? We are told that Germany has given her consent and that the Sultan of Zanzibar has been pleased to give his consent, but neither the Sultan nor Germany are the guaranteeing 1282 Powers at Zanzibar. The two Guaranteeing Powers are England and Francer: and the solemn pledges that we made by the Mutual Declaration which was signed at Paris, on March 10th, 1882, to respect the independence of the Sultans of Zanzibar and Muscat appear, as far as we can gather from the Papers laid on the Table, and from the expository speech of the noble Marquess, in which the name of France was not once mentioned, to be treated as absolutely non-existent. My Lords, I consider this to be rather a grave matter. I do not know whether the noble Marquess is negotiating with France or not for her consent. I only know what I read in the papers, and it is no part of my duty to believe implicitly all that I read. But I think it would have been more graceful and more conciliatory to the dignity of a great Power, with which we have always been in the most friendly relations, if, in a transaction of this kind, transferring the protectorate of a territory with regard to which that Power and ourselves are the only Guaranteeing Powers, some mention had been made of that other Power in this transaction. So entirely was that position of France recognised in regard, to Zanzibar that the Commission of Delimitation to which the noble Marquess has referred, which was set on foot in order to ascertain the real dominions of Zanzibar, was really see on foot to enable Germany to become a third Guaranteeing Power, there being then only two. Therefore, my Lords, I must add this to my description of the exchange which has been effected of Heligoland for this protectorate of Zanzibar, that we are not only re-purchasing a portion of what we had in 1886, but that we are only re-purchasing it subject to the consent of another Power, which has not yet been given, as far as I know. But I am not sure that I have even yet done with the qualifications which I must attach to the triumphant announcement of the noble Marquess. By Article 11 he is going to facilitate the complete arrangements by which Germany is to get possession of the territory on the mainland. Germany will receive the acquisitions referred to in Article 11 of the Treaty in full and fair freehold, so to speak. Our protectorate, if I am not misinformed, will be by no means of this fair freehold description that attaches to 1283 the position of Germany. Our protectorate will be, more or less, subject to all the commercia£Treaties entered into by the Sultan of Zanzibar, and will be subject also to that extra-territorial jurisdiction of Foreign Powers which has caused us so much trouble in Egypt and elsewhere. We must, I am afraid, therefore, attach this further qualification to the description of the noble Marquess—that we are ceding Heligoland in order to obtain at Zanzibar partially now what we had altogether in 1886, subject to the consent of France, and subject to all the restrictions which have been placed by Foreign Powers, at different times, on the full and free action of that Sultan. I shall not ask your Lordships to consider this Agreement any further this evening. I have thought it right to lay before you the view I hold, that it is by no means the triumphant arrangement which it has been claimed to be by the organs of the opposite Party. There may be counterbalancing advantages for us in the "Empire that will be added to an Empire," in the 650,000 square miles which Mr. Stanley says are now open to the Anglo-Saxon race. Your Lordships understand that I am not now dealing with vast intangible regions; I am dealing now with very tangible interests. We have handed over Heligoland and its people, like chattels, to a Foreign Power, and in exchange we have received this extremely qualified and diminished concession, which I have described in detail. It may be thought that this is an Agreement to which we in this House and in the other House should offer open and persistent opposition. But I confess, for my part, I shall offer no such opposition. It would be futile, if I wished to do so, in the present condition of our Party in this House; but if there were behind me, instead of 30, 300 Peers, my attitude in this respect would be exactly the same. In the first place I believe that the Agreement might have been considerably modified for the better, but having been made, and having been accepted by Germany, it would plunge us into the worst possible relations with Germany if the arrangement were not now consented to, or if it were now to be cancelled or withdrawn. I set far more value and importance on our good understanding with a great Power than I do on points of detail, however important, that may be 1284 found in an Agreement of this kind. But I confess that, while I am one of those who have always most stoutly and persistently urged that this country should establish the closest and best relations with the united Empire of Germany, and I did so long before I was at the Foreign Office, I do not see that that precludes our paying due and friendly respect to that other great Power with which we nave always striven to be in the most friendly relations, and which, in my view, should have been consulted on this occasion. That is one other good reason for having nothing further to say in opposition to this Treaty. But there is a larger reason still to which I attach personally more importance than that; and it is this—I, for one, will never be party to dragging the foreign policy of this country into the arena of Party warfare. I attach infinitely more importance to our preserving a dignified and united attitude abroad, than to any petty advantage we can gain at home. 1, for one, will never raise my voice by the utterance of a syllable, I will never give a single vote, unless under a major force than any that exists in this instance, which might diminish by one jot or tittle the supreme influence and position of Great Britain in the world.
