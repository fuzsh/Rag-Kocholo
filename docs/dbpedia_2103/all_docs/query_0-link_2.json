        "text": "Nearly 6000 ancient coastal settlements have been identified so far. It may be accepted that all of them had some kind of boat landing or shelter. From a nautical point of view, many of these sites are not considered very good for sheltering modern yachts, but were nevertheless used in ancient times. Conversely, would you believe that a natural shelter that is considered today as ‘excellent’ from a nautical point of view would not have been used in ancient times, at least as a bad weather refuge shelter? If such a place, in addition, provided fresh water and food, it could become more than a simple refuge. If it also had some ‘hinterland’ providing trade opportunities, it could become a bigger city with sufficient resources to build specific port structures like breakwaters and quays. The aim of the present study is to list ‘Potential Ancient Harbours’ defined as natural shelters that are considered ‘excellent’ by modern sailors but not (yet) listed as ancient harbours. The result is a list of ca. 150 places that might be further considered by historians and archaeologists to find out if they were indeed ancient settlements.\n\nThis paper aims to compare ancient and modern port structures hoping that the modern can help us in a better understanding of the ancient, with special focus on breakwaters and quay walls. The oldest known port structures are briefly presented. Vertical breakwaters and quays, large concrete blocks, pilae and arched breakwaters, piling walls, cofferdams, rubble mound breakwaters and river training walls are described in the ancient and in the modern world. A few geomorphological aspects of coastal harbours are also reviewed. It is concluded that most natural shelters were used in Roman times, but some major ports have been built in places without any natural shelter, for strategic or economic reasons. Most of today’s concepts for maritime structures were already existing in Roman times and it seems that little progress was made until the 18th c. when large maritime structures started to be built again. The combination of concrete and steel enables modern engineers to build higher, deeper and larger than Roman engineers could dream of, but some modern structures may not last as long as some Roman structures, especially in salt water …\n\nOver the last 20 years, the geoarchaeology of ancient harbours has been a very active area of research around the Mediterranean basin, generating much palaeoenvironmental data from many sites, including estimations of sedimentation rates, the height of the ancient sea-level at different dates and palaeo-geographical reconstructions. Combining this information has proved a major challenge. This article proposes a new chart called the Palaeoenvironmental Age-Depth Model (PADM chart), that allows the researchers to combine all relevant indicators in order to estimate harbour potential of a given ancient port, and to generate comparable data between harbours in terms of degree of closure and water depth available against a synchronised chronology. This new approach, developed in the context of the ERC-funded RoMP Portuslimen project, takes into account estimations of water depths relating to differing Roman ship draughts at different periods. It is tested against the palaeoenvironmental evidence published over 10 years from two Roman harbours located at the mouth of the river Tiber: Ostia and Portus. This reveals that: (1) there has been an underestimate of the real sedimentation rates due to the margins of error of the radiocarbon dates; (2) there was effective control of the water column by dredging; (3) there were different periods of control of the sedimentation. We suggest that the navigability of the Ostia harbour by ships with shallower draughts was maintained until sometime between the 2nd c. BC and 1st c. AD, while at Portus it was retained until the 6th—7th c. AD.\n\nStudies concerning Greek commercial harbour areas are far from extensive. The reasons lie in the general trend of avoiding large scale harbour works, in modern settlements which lie over ancient πόλεις, in changes in sea level and in the human intervention, which changes the appearance of the coasts to comply with the needs of the tourism industry or fish farming. From this general outline it is evident that a new and updated examination of the subject is needed and the first thing to do is certainly to identify the active ports between the 8th and 4th cent. B.C. This poster aims to present part of a project directed to collect pre-hellenistic Greek ports: this collection is being organized in a database that, when completed, is expected to be publicly visible."
