The western world has been freed of the evil forces which for five years and longer have imprisoned the bodies and broken the lives of millions upon millions of free-born men. They have violated their churches, destroyed their homes, corrupted their children, and murdered their loved ones. Our Armies of Liberation have restored freedom to these suffering peoples, whose spirit and will the oppressors could never enslave.\n\nMuch remains to be done. The victory won in the West must now be won in the East. The whole world must be cleansed of the evil from which half the world has been freed. United, the peace-loving nations have demonstrated in the West that their arms are stronger by far than the might of dictators or the tyranny of military cliques that once called us soft and weak. The power of our peoples to defend themselves against all enemies will be proved in the Pacific was as it has been proved in Europe.\n\nFor the trimuph of spirit and of arms which we have won, and of its promise to peoples everywhere who join us in the love of freedom, it is fitting that we, as a nation, give thanks to Almighty God, who has strengthened us and given us the victory.\n\nNOW, THEREFORE, I, HARRY S. TRUMAN, President of the United States of America, do hereby appoint Sunday, May 13, 1945 to be a day of prayer.\n\nI call upon the people of the United States, whatever their faith, to unite in offering joyful thanks to God for the victory we have won and to pray that He will support us to the end of our present struggle and guide us into the way of peace.\n\nI also call upon my countrymen to dedicate this day of prayer to the memory of those who have given their lives to make possible our victory.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.\n\nDone at the City of Washington this eighth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-ninth.\n\n[ THE GREAT SEAL OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ]\n\nBy the President:\n\nHarry S. Truman\n\nReturn to HyperWar: Political & Diplomatic Documents of WWII\n\nReturn to HyperWar: World War II on the World Wide Web\n\nLast updated: February 12, 1999"
