        "text": "These towering monoliths, carved from cliffs by the oceans, are either carefully protected or hard to access and ascend.\n\nA spectacular sight, they represent a tempting challenge for ambitious climbers, but even the ones that are climbable offer such a mental and physical challenge few have conquered them.\n\nIain Miller, of Unique Ascent, is one of the masters — and here’s his pick of some of the toughest, best and most beautiful.\n\nLange Anna\n\nLocation: Heligoland, Germany\n\nHeight: 154 feet\n\nClimb rating: Impossible — climbing is illegal\n\nThis tall, thin stack is on its way out — so go see it before it tumbles. It was declared a national monument in 1969 and despite man-made protection from battering waves, an unstable sand layer 50 feet up could see the top knocked off at any time.\n\nTotem Pole\n\nLocation: Cape Hauy, Tasmania, Australia\n\nHeight: 213 feet\n\nClimb rating: Hard — an extremely technical climb\n\nThe daddy of Tasmania’s many coastal stacks, this dolerite pinnacle has stood over 100 years — despite having a diameter of just 13 feet. Access involves a remote wilderness hike, a long abseil to sea level, some hard technical climbing and a Tyrolean traverse through midair to reach the summit.\n\n12 Apostles\n\nLocation: Port Campbell NP, Victoria, Australia\n\nHeight: Various, ranging up to 150 feet\n\nClimb rating: Impossible — the stacks are protected\n\nThese beautifully laid out limestone stacks on Australia's Great Ocean Road are some of the world's most famous. Contrary to their name, however, there are actually only eight of the \"apostles\" left — and a 165-foot tower most recently collapsed in 2005.\n\nOld Man of Hoy\n\nLocation: Island of Hoy, Orkney Islands, Scotland\n\nHeight: 450 feet\n\nClimb rating: Medium — with multiple routes, a range of levels are available\n\nThis iconic red sandstone stack was first summited in 1966 by Chris Bonington, Rusty Baillie and Tom Patey. It is now a popular destination for climbers and is accessed via a precarious rock scramble, after which there are 10 different routes to get to the top.\n\nHaystack Rock\n\nLocation: Cannon Beach, Oregon, USA\n\nHeight: 236 feet\n\nClimb rating: Impossible — climbing is Illegal\n\nThis lava rock is a wildlife refuge home to puffins, gulls and cormorants, and climbing it is forbidden. It's accessible by foot during low tide and many visitors still try to tackle the cliffs — but literally thousands are stopped every year.\n\nBall's Pyramid\n\nLocation: Lord Howe Island, Australia\n\nHeight: 1,843 feet\n\nClimb rating: Hard — highly restricted, permit-only access\n\nThe world’s highest sea stack, this is the remains of a shield volcano 12 miles from remote Lord Howe Island in the Pacific Ocean. It was first climbed in 1965 by a team led by Bryden Allen but permit restrictions — partly to protect a rare stick insect — and huge rising swells mean few attempt it.\n\nDun Briste\n\nLocation: Downpatrick Head, Ballycastle, Co. Mayo, Ireland\n\nHeight: 164 feet\n\nClimb rating: Difficult — overhanging, loose and poorly protected\n\nThis stack, which dates back to 1393, is topped by a medieval church ruin. Few have climbed it; the most recent was Miller, who said: \"The challenges are the unpredictable tides and flaking rock — but at the top, standing where only seven people have visited in 700 years is incredible.\"\n\nKicker Rock\n\nLocation: Isla San Cristóbal, Galapagos, Ecuador\n\nHeight: 477 feet\n\nClimb rating: Impossible — climbing is illegal\n\nLocated in the beautiful volcanic Galapagos Islands, this is the remains of a lava cone and its two pinnacles are home to tropicbirds, blue-footed boobies and frigate birds. Climbing is illegal, but in any case the ocean swells make it virtually impossible to moor up to.\n\nRisin og Kellingin\n\nLocation: Eysturoy Island, Faroe Islands\n\nHeight: 232 feet and 223 feet\n\nClimb rating: Medium — made more challenging due to poor volcanic rock\n\nThis is a pair of sea stacks whose names mean The Giant and The Witch. The former was first climbed in 2008, the latter in 2013 — but with the harsh winter storms, The Witch, which sits on two legs, is tipped to fall in the next few decades.\n\nSail Rock\n\nLocation: Praskoveevka, Black Sea, Russia\n\nHeight: 82 feet\n\nClimb rating: Impossible — the rock is protected\n\nThis incredible sandstone rock — also known as Parus rock — is only 3 feet thick but is 82 feet high and 65 feet wide. It sheer vertical \"ships sail\" face sits perpendicular to the shore and has a hole in the side that, according to debated legend, was created by shots from a battleship.\n\nKo Tapu\n\nLocation: Phang Nga Bay, Thailand\n\nHeight: 65 feet\n\nClimb rating: Impossible — the rock is protected\n\nRarely visited before it appeared in the 1974 James Bond movie \"The Man With The Golden Gun,\" this top-heavy limestone tower is now part of the protected Ao Phang Nga National Park. It has a diameter of 26 feet at the top, which is around double the diameter at the bottom.\n\nReynisdrangar\n\nLocation: Vik, Iceland\n\nHeight: 216 feet\n\nClimb rating: Unclear\n\nLegend says that the stacks originated when two trolls dragged a three-masted ship to land unsuccessfully and when daylight broke they became needles of rock. Science and nature says it was erosion. Either way, they’re spectacular — and extremely remote.\n\nEast Trinity\n\nLocation: Newfoundland, Canada\n\nHeight: Various\n\nClimb rating: Difficult — remote location and loose crumbling rock\n\nIt's claimed that pirates left treasure on top of these isolated rock formations but after taking two days to find a climbable tower, Will Gadd and climbing partner Sarah Hueniken never found any treasure. Gadd said: \"It was some of the least predictable, scariest rock that I’ve ever climbed.\"\n\nNorth Gaulton Castle\n\nLocation: Orkney Islands, Scotland\n\nHeight: 180 feet\n\nClimb Rating: Tough — challenging climb out the sea and loose rock on top\n\nThis precarious-looking stack, set in an amphitheatre of cliffs, defies gravity, as it is much wider at its summit than its base. It's found on a lonely stretch of Orkney's west mainland coast and can only be accessed by boat or a 130-foot cliff abseil followed by a 130-foot swim.\n\nTormore Island\n\nLocation: Glenlough Bay, South West Donegal, Ireland\n\nHeight: 524 feet\n\nClimb Rating: Near impossible — access is perilous"
