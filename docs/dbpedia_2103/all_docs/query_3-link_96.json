The case comes before the Court, in accordance with Article 36(1) of its Statute, pursuant\n\nto an agreement between the Government of the Republic of Botswana and the Government\n\nof the Republic of Namibia of 15 February 1996 requesting the Court\n\nto determine, on the basis of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1st July 1890 and the rules and\n\nprinciples of international law, the boundary between Namibia and Botswana around\n\nKasikili/Sedudu Island and the legal status of the island.1\n\n2. The Anglo-German Treaty of 1 July 1890 provides in relevant part:\n\nIn South-West Africa the sphere in which the exercise of influence is reserved to Germany is\n\nbounded:\n\n. . .\n\n2. To the east by a line commencing at the above-named point, [the point of intersection\n\nbetween the north bank of the Orange River and the 20th degree of east longitude] and\n\nfollowing the 20th degree of east longitude to the point of its intersection by the 22nd parallel\n\nof south latitude, it runs eastward along that parallel to the point of its intersection by the 21st\n\ndegree of east longitude; thence it follows that degree northward to the point of its intersection\n\nby the 18th parallel of south latitude; it runs eastward along that parallel till it reaches the\n\nRiver Chobe; and descends the centre of the main channel of that river to its junction with the\n\nZambesi, where it terminates.2\n\n3. Kasikili Island is a small island in the Chobe River, about four square kilometres in area,\n\nsituated about 15 kilometres west of its junction with the Zambezi River. (See Fig. 5, infra,\n\nfollowing p. 16) Under the Treaty sovereignty over the Island would be determined by the\n\nlocation of the 'main channel' of that River. If the main channel is the one running to the north\n\nof the Island, the Treaty attributes Kasikili Island to Botswana; if it is the channel to the south,\n\nthe Treaty attributes the Island to Namibia. The rules and principles of international law\n\nrelating to the acquisition of territory by prescription and the principle of uti possidetis are\n\nalso relevant in determining the legal status of the Island.\n\n4. The steps by which this dispute came before the Court are as follows:\n\n5. In 1991, Botswana deployed a contingent of troops, erected two military observation posts\n\nand hoisted its national flag on Kasikili Island, which is the territory of Namibia.3 These\n\nunilateral measures by the Botswana Defence Force brought about dangerous tension in the\n\narea around Kasikili and threatened seriously to disrupt relations between the two countries.\n\n6. When diplomatic exchanges between the two countries were unsuccessful in resolving the\n\nboundary dispute, Namibia invited His Excellency Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe\n\nand Chairman of the Frontline States, to facilitate a dialogue between Namibia and Botswana.\n\nPresident Mugabe accepted Namibia's invitation. Nevertheless, tension in the border area\n\nincreased, and Namibia once again took the initiative to request the assistance of President\n\nMugabe in arranging a further summit meeting between the Presidents of Namibia and\n\nBotswana. These efforts led to a meeting of the three Presidents at Kasane, Botswana on 24May 1992 where it was decided to submit the question to a Joint Team of Technical Experts\n\n(JTTE).\n\n7. The Kasane Communiqué stated:\n\nThe three Presidents after a frank discussion, decided that the issue should be resolved\n\npeacefully. To this end they agreed that the boundary between Botswana and Namibia around\n\nSedudu/Kasikili Island should be a subject of investigation by a joint team of six (6) technical\n\nexperts, three from each country to determine where the boundary lies in terms of the Treaty.\n\nThe team should meet within three (3) to four (4) weeks. The team shall submit its findings to\n\nthe three Presidents. The Presidents agreed that the findings of [the] team of technical experts\n\nshall be final and binding on Botswana and Namibia.4\n\n8. Terms of Reference for the JTTE were agreed between the parties on 8 December 1992.\n\nBetween 28 September 1993 and 21 August 1994, the JTTE, co-chaired by Professor Ian\n\nBrownlie, CBE, QC, for Botswana, and Dr. Albert Kawana, Permanent Secretary of the\n\nMinistry of Justice, for Namibia, held six rounds of meetings in Windhoek, Gaborone, Kasane\n\nand Katima Mulilo. Oral evidence was heard at the fourth round of meetings held at Kasane\n\nand Katima Mulilo from 10 to 24 May 1994 and at the fifth round held at Katima Mulilo from\n\n26 to 31 July 1994. Both parties accepted the JTTE's invitation to present written submissions,\n\nsupplementary written submissions and other documents.\n\n9. The JTTE failed to reach an agreed conclusion on the question put to it. Its final Report,\n\nissued on 20 August 1994, stated:\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\n\n. . .\n\nwith regret, the Joint Team has to report to Your Excellencies that it was unable to make a\n\nfinding determining the boundary between Botswana and Namibia in the area of\n\nKasikili/Sedudu Island in accordance with the provisions of the Memorandum of\n\nUnderstanding.\n\n5. RECOMMENDATION\n\nAlthough the Joint team has been unable to make a finding involving the determination of the\n\nboundary between Namibia and Botswana around Kasikili/Sedudu Island, the Memorandum\n\nof Understanding empowers us to make any recommendations under Article 7(1)(i).\n\nIn this regard, the Joint Team would recommend recourse to the peaceful settlement of the\n\ndispute on the basis of the applicable rules and principles of international law.5\n\n10. On 15 February 1995, the three Presidents met again in Harare, Zimbabwe, to consider the\n\nJTTE Report. At this meeting it was decided to submit the dispute to the International Court\n\nof Justice for a final and binding determination.\n\n11. Pursuant to the decision taken at the Summit Meeting in Harare, Namibia and Botswana\n\nnegotiated the Special Agreement submitting the dispute to the Court. The Special Agreementwas signed by the parties at Gaborone on 15 February 1996 and was notified to the Court on\n\n17 May 1996.\n\n12. The present Memorial is submitted pursuant to the order of the Court of 24 June 1996,\n\nfixing 28 February 1997 as the date for the submission of the first round of written pleadings.\n\nB. Summary of Argument\n\n13. In the agreement submitting this case for decision, the parties have asked the Court 'to\n\ndetermine the boundary between Namibia and Botswana around Kasikili/Sedudu Island and\n\nthe legal status of the island.'6 In Namibia's submission, the boundary is the centre of the\n\nsouthern channel of the Chobe River, and the legal status of the Island is that it is part of the\n\nsovereign territory of Namibia.\n\n14. Namibia rests its case for these propositions on three separate grounds:\n\n1. The words of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1890, properly interpreted,\n\nattribute Kasikili Island to Namibia because 'the main channel' of the Chobe\n\nRiver in the vicinity of the Island is the southern channel and the boundary is\n\nestablished by the Treaty as the centre of the main channel.\n\n2. Moreover, by virtue of continuous and exclusive occupation and use of\n\nKasikili Island and exercise of sovereign jurisdiction over it from the\n\nbeginning of the century, with full knowledge, acceptance and acquiescence by\n\nthe governing authorities in Bechuanaland and Botswana, Namibia has\n\nprescriptive title to the Island.\n\n3. Since, during the colonial period, both Namibia and Botswana's colonial\n\nrulers accepted that the boundary ran in the southern channel and that\n\nNamibia's predecessors in interest had the exclusive occupation and use of\n\nKasikili Island, the Island belongs to Namibia by the operation of the doctrine\n\nof uti possidetis.\n\nThe factual and legal basis for these claims is discussed at length in this Memorial. The\n\nargument is summarized here by way of introduction.\n\nI.\n\n15. The basic object and purpose of the Anglo-German Treaty of 1890 was to achieve an\n\nagreed definition of the spheres of influence of the two powers in Africa.7 The Treaty was the\n\nlast lap in the nineteenth century race to dismember and divide Africa among the European\n\ncolonial powers. It recognized the imperial aspirations of Germany, the latecomer to this race,\n\nin East Africa, Central Africa and South West Africa, and at the same time it severely\n\nconstrained German colonial expansion so that it was not a threat to British ambitions and\n\nplans. In terms of boundary delimitation, therefore, the object of the Treaty was to establish\n\nfirm and stable boundaries between these spheres of influence so as to avoid conflict and\n\nfriction between the two powers and, perhaps more important, between the competing citizens\n\nand business interests of the two countries.16. The European diplomats who negotiated the Treaty were operating on a continental scale.\n\nThey were not much concerned with the detailed consequences of the boundary lines they\n\ndrew on their maps. The region of South West Africa that was dealt with in Article III of the\n\nTreaty was little known to them. None had personal acquaintance with the area. Exploration\n\nby Europeans began with David Livingstone's expeditions in the 1850s, and a few English\n\nhunters and explorers in the 1880s had written accounts of the area with which some of the\n\nEnglish participants in the negotiations might have been acquainted. The most striking aspect\n\nof the eastern reaches of the Chobe River in these accounts was the annual flood of the\n\nZambezi River which inundated the whole area to the foot of the Chobe Ridge on the south\n\nbank of the river for almost half of each year.\n\n17. The negotiators proceeded with the assistance of a map prepared by the Intelligence\n\nDivision of the British War Office (Atlas, Map II) (hereinafter the '1889 Map').8 A prominent\n\nfeature on this map is the line of the Chobe River, cutting sharply across it from south-west to\n\nnorth-east (almost due east in the vicinity of the Island). The map shows a prominent '[s]and\n\nbelt with large forest coming down to water's edge' on the south bank of the River and the\n\n'swamps' of the Zambezi floodplain to the north. (See Fig. 3, following p. 16, infra) Thus this\n\nconspicuous geographical feature divided two distinctive patterns of terrain and was an\n\nobvious marker for the boundary between the two spheres of influence as well. The British\n\ncolonial administrators in Bechuanaland, looking to expand the Protectorate northward to\n\nprotect the north-south trade routes running through Lake Ngami to Victoria Falls, had some\n\nyears earlier identified the Chobe River as a convenient northern terminus for the expansion.\n\nSuch an arrangement resulted in the creation of an area to be allocated to Germany between\n\nthe Chobe River and the Zambezi River, which, with adjacent territory to the west, became\n\nknown as the Caprivi Strip. It thus had the further advantage of satisfying the German desire\n\nfor British recognition of its access to the Zambezi, which had already been affirmed by its\n\nPortuguese neighbour in Angola to the north. From all this, it appears that a boundary along\n\nthe foot of the Chobe Ridge, marking the southern channel of the Chobe River, would be\n\nmore consistent with the object and purpose of the treaty than a boundary along the northern\n\nchannel, lying within the swampy floodplain. See Part One, Chapter III.\n\n18. As for the preparatory work, the early drafts of the Treaty, both in French and English,\n\nspecified that the boundary should follow 'the centre of the River Tschobi,'9 and only in the\n\nfinal days of the negotiation were the words 'main channel' inserted in the English text. It does\n\nnot appear from the preparatory work that the negotiators paid any particular attention to these\n\nrefinements of language. In the German text, the phrase 'centre of the main channel' was\n\ntranslated as 'Thalweg des Hauptlaufes' again without any particular notice by the negotiators.\n\nAlthough the 1889 Map was just large enough in scale to show Kasikili Island, it is clear that\n\nthe negotiators had no specific purpose with regard to it. See Part One, Chapter IV.\n\n19. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties prescribes that a treaty is\n\nto be interpreted 'in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to . . . [its] terms in\n\ntheir context, and in the light of its object and purpose.' As argued above, a boundary along\n\nthe Chobe Ridge, which generally marks the southern bank of the Chobe River (and the\n\nsouthern channel in the locality of the Island), would be more consistent with the object and\n\npurpose of the Treaty to establish a firm, stable and visible division between the two spheres\n\nof influence than a boundary along the northern channel lying within the swampy floodplain\n\nthat would be difficult to ascertain and would be completely obscured during half the year.20. The meaning of the term 'main channel' in this case is dominated by the peculiar\n\ncharacteristics of the Chobe River. In this connexion, Namibia earnestly directs the attention\n\nof the Court to the Expert Opinion (hereinafter the 'Alexander Report') prepared by Professor\n\nW.J.R. Alexander, formerly Chief of the Division of Hydrology and Manager of Scientific\n\nServices of the South African Department of Water Affairs and one of the leading experts in\n\nthe world on the rivers of southern Africa. The Report, which appears as Volume VI of the\n\nMemorial, is an integral part of the Memorial and should be read in full to appreciate the\n\nscientific and technical foundations of this case.\n\n21. The Alexander Report shows that Kasikili Island lies within the floodplain of the Zambezi\n\nRiver, which covers roughly the entire triangle bounded by lines connecting Katima Mulilo\n\non the north, Ngoma Bridge on the south and the Mambova Rapids on the east. (See Fig. 4,\n\nfollowing p. 17, infra) This whole floodplain, including Kasikili Island itself as well as the\n\ntwo channels of the Chobe River is under water for five months of every year on the average.\n\nAlthough on the 1889 Map, and indeed on the other maps to be consulted in this case, the\n\nChobe seems to be a river like any other -- flowing into the area from the west, parting at the\n\nwestern end of the Island, joining again in a single stream at the eastern end, and proceeding\n\non to its confluence with the Zambezi -- such an impression is profoundly misleading. All the\n\nmaps (as well as the aerial photographs of the area) were made in the dry season, and\n\nalthough both channels of the Chobe appear to be full there is actually no flowing water in\n\nthem at all. Only a few kilometres upstream, the Chobe at these times of year is dry, and there\n\nis no water to flow into either the northern or the southern channel. Both are substantially\n\nstagnant.\n\n22. Water flows through this sector of the Chobe River only during the season when the\n\nZambezi is in flood. Then it comes into the Chobe not from the upstream reaches to the west,\n\nbut across the whole width of the Zambezi floodplain, a front of over 60 kilometres, until it is\n\nintercepted by the Chobe Ridge, which marks the right (south) bank of the Chobe River.\n\nWhen the floodwaters reach the Ridge they turn into the bed of the Chobe River, flowing\n\nthrough it and, in the vicinity of the Island, through the southern channel to the confluence\n\nwith the Zambezi.\n\n23. Thus, the northern channel can hardly be considered a channel of the Chobe River at all.\n\nIn the dry season it is stagnant; in the flood season, it is refilled by the floodwaters of the\n\nZambezi, but no water flows through it downstream in the Chobe in either season. As\n\nProfessor Alexander says, it is, in effect, a relict channel of the Zambezi floodplain. The\n\nsouthern channel too is stagnant in the dry season. But during the floods, the only time of year\n\nwhen there is a substantial flow of water in the Chobe River, that flow is through the southern\n\nchannel. It follows that, in the ordinary meaning of the term, the southern channel is the 'main\n\nchannel' of the Chobe River.\n\n24. These conclusions are fully developed and supported in the Alexander Report on the basis\n\nof the topographical, hydrological and geomorphologic characteristics of the Chobe River and\n\nanalysis of ground, aerial and satellite photography. See Part One, Chapter V(B).\n\nII.\n\n25. The Eastern Caprivi, the triangle between the Chobe and Zambezi Rivers, is inhabited by\n\nthe Masubia people, consisting of some 10,000 individuals, who have lived there for well over\n\na century. It is a riverine area, remote and inaccessible, and even today most of the populationoutside Katima Mulilo and a few towns live in small villages by subsistence farming in river\n\nbeds and on the islands during the dry season, moving their homes and possessions to the high\n\nground during the annual floods.\n\n26. Namibia produced over 60 residents of the area as witnesses before the JTTE. Their\n\nevidence is summarized in Part Two, Chapter II, of the Memorial. The evidence shows that\n\nKasikili Island was a valued Masubia territory from before the turn of the century. Until at\n\nleast the 1950s, there was a well-established Masubia village on the Island, whose members\n\nhad homes, bore their children, ploughed the fields, died and were buried there. During the\n\nflood season, they would gather their possessions and move to the related village of Kasika,\n\non high ground nearby, where they would wait for the floods to subside so that they could\n\nreturn to their homes on Kasikili Island. The chief of the Masubia lived on the Island at times\n\nand held his court there. By the late 1950s, encroachments of wild animals from Botswana in\n\nthe area now known as the Chobe National Park across the Chobe River put an end to full-\n\ntime farming, but the Island and its environs continued to be part of the daily lives of the\n\nMasubia. During all this time, the possession and use of the Island by the Masubia was\n\nexclusive. As many of the witnesses testified, nobody from Bechuanaland south of the River,\n\neither private individuals or officials, used the Island or made any claim to it. See Part Two,\n\nChapter II(A).\n\n27. The German government first established an administrative presence in the Eastern\n\nCaprivi in 1909. In February of that year Hauptmann Kurt Streitwolf, the first German\n\nImperial Resident, founded the town of Schuckmannsburg on the Zambezi and set up his\n\nheadquarters there. Thereafter, until the outbreak of World War I, German officials exercised\n\nauthority throughout the Caprivi Strip, including Kasikili Island. Both Streitwolf and the last\n\nGerman Imperial Resident, Viktor von Frankenberg, included the Island by name on maps\n\nthey drew of the area for which they were responsible.\n\n28. As with many other African colonies of European empires, German authority was\n\nimplemented through the mode of 'indirect rule.' That is, rather than exercising direct control\n\nthrough German officials, the Imperial Resident acted through the political structure and\n\ninstitutions of the people of the area. Thus, Streitwolf's first act was to install Chikamatondo\n\nas the Masubia chief, responsible to him for the governance of the area. Kasikili Island was\n\nclearly within Chikamatondo's jurisdiction. According to von Frankenberg's map, his\n\nheadquarters was at the related village of Kasika. His induna, or senior councillor, Sulumbu,\n\nlived on the Island and was responsible for its administration. Indeed, for a time Kasikili\n\nIsland was called Sulumbu's Island. In later years, the Masubia chief himself lived on the\n\nIsland and held his court there. This method of 'indirect rule' was characteristic of British and\n\nlater German colonial administrations in Africa and was continued by the governing\n\nauthorities in the Caprivi after the departure of the Germans. See Part Two, Chapter III.\n\n29. It may be helpful to the Court to summarize here the political entities that have had\n\ngoverning responsibility in the area at various times:\n\n· At all material times, Britain was the power responsible for the administration\n\nof Bechuanaland.\n\n· Until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Germany was the power\n\nresponsible for the administration of South West Africa including the Caprivi\n\nStrip. · During the war, the Caprivi Strip was occupied and governed by British\n\nforces from Southern Rhodesia.\n\n· From 1919 until 1966, South Africa was the administering authority of the\n\nMandated Territory of South West Africa under a Mandate from the League of\n\nNations. When the Mandate was terminated by the UN General Assembly on\n\n27 October 1966, South Africa remained in de facto control of the territory\n\nuntil Namibia's independence on 21 March 1990.\n\n· From 1 January 1921 to 29 September 1929, the Caprivi Strip was\n\nadministered under the Mandate by the authorities of the Bechuanaland\n\nProtectorate, as delegate of South Africa.\n\n· From 19 May 1967 until 21 March 1990, the United Nations Council for\n\nNamibia was the authority formally responsible for the administration of\n\nNamibia and was internationally recognized as such.\n\n· Botswana became independent on 30 September 1966.\n\n· Namibia became independent on 21 March 1990.\n\n30. Throughout all these transformations, the basic arrangement for the governance of\n\nKasikili Island as part of the Caprivi Strip continued. Even during the period of British\n\nadministration in the early years of the League of Nations Mandate, a strict separation was\n\nmaintained between the affairs of the Caprivi Strip and the Bechuanaland Protectorate. The\n\nBritish authorities did not levy taxes on the inhabitants of the Strip, although they did in\n\nBechuanaland, and they reported on the activities of local chiefs, including Chikamatondo, to\n\nthe League. When South Africa resumed administrative authority under the Mandate in 1929,\n\nthere is no doubt that its writ ran on the Island. Finally, towards the end of the 1960s, when\n\nthe war for Namibian independence began in earnest, the Eastern Caprivi was treated as a war\n\nzone by both sides. The South African Defence Forces (SADF) were deployed to the area and\n\npatrolled Kasikili Island, arresting Masubia men they found there as sympathizers of the\n\nSouth West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO). South African patrol boats plied the\n\nwaters of the southern channel. See Part Two, Chapter III.\n\n31. Throughout these many changes, the British officials just across the Chobe River in\n\nBechuanaland, and after 1966 the Botswana authorities, were fully aware that Kasikili Island\n\nwas continuously and exclusively used by the Masubia people and ruled by the authorities\n\ncurrently in charge of South West Africa. Yet not once, throughout the whole period of\n\nBritish rule in Bechuanaland, did the British authorities raise a formal or explicit challenge,\n\nprotest or objection to this state of affairs. Even after Botswana's independence, almost two\n\ndecades elapsed before an exchange of fire with a South African patrol boat in the southern\n\nchannel finally led Botswana for the first time to challenge the existing status quo on the\n\nIsland. See Part Two, Chapter IV.\n\n32. This 'subsequent practice' of the parties extending over almost a century is described in\n\ndetail in Part Two of the Memorial. It fully corroborates the interpretation of the Treaty,\n\nreached on the basis of an analysis of its terms, that the boundary runs in the southern channel\n\nso that Kasikili Island is in Namibia.33. This same record also establishes an entirely independent Namibian claim of sovereignty\n\nover the Island. Continuous, open and notorious occupation and use of a defined territory over\n\na long period of time, together with exercise of sovereignty in the territory and failure of the\n\nother party, having knowledge of these facts, to object, protest or assert its rights is\n\nuniversally recognized in international law as establishing title to the territory by prescription.\n\nAmong the many apposite authorities, reference may be made to Professor Ian Brownlie, who\n\nunequivocally endorses this principle at the outset of his treatise, African Boundaries: A Legal\n\nand Diplomatic Encyclopaedia:\n\nInternational law contains principles of recognition and acquiescence by conduct. These\n\ntechnical concepts reflect principles of consistency, finality and stability which find a place at\n\nonce in statecraft, law and morals. If two neighbours for some years after independence treat\n\nthe alignment existing at independence as their common boundary there comes a stage at\n\nwhich neither can be heard to say that it is not bound to recognize the alignment as definitive.\n\nThe evidence of recognition and acquiescence by conduct may take the form of absence of\n\nprotest or any other reservation of rights, admissions of ministers and law officers, the\n\npublication of official maps, reliance for official purposes on maps showing the alignment,\n\nand administrative practice in matters of tax collection, customs enforcement and the like.10\n\n(emphasis in original)\n\nAll these forms of conduct evidencing recognition and acquiescence are to be found in this\n\ncase and are developed in Part Two of the Memorial.\n\n34. The production and use of maps by the parties involved has assumed a special importance\n\nin adjudications concerning boundary delimitation. It is a specialized form of 'subsequent\n\npractice' and is also an aspect both of the exercise of jurisdiction and the acquiescence in it\n\nthat matures into prescriptive title. The principal maps in the present case are collected in an\n\nAtlas, annexed to this Memorial. (See also Annex 102) Among the many maps included in the\n\nAtlas and discussed in the Annex, three are of dominant significance in this case, one map\n\nproduced by each of the countries responsible for rule over the Caprivi. Each of them shows\n\nKasikili Island as part of Namibia:\n\n· Seiner's map, Karte des Gebiets zwischen Okawango und Sambesi (Caprivi-\n\nZipfel) 1:500,000 Surveyed by Seiner 1905-1906 Berlin, E.S. Mittler & Sohn\n\n1909. (Atlas, Map IV) This map was made by Franz Seiner, a prominent\n\nAustrian cartographer, geographer and expert on the German colonies in\n\nAfrica. It was in general use as the best available map of the Caprivi for four\n\ndecades. It was the principal large scale map used by German officials in\n\nBerlin and the field from its publication until the end of the period of German\n\nrule of Namibia. The British authorities used it in the period from 1921 to 1929\n\nwhen they were administering the Strip as delegate of South Africa under the\n\nMandate.\n\n· Bechuanaland Protectorate Sheet 2 1:500,000 War Office GSGS 3915 1933.\n\n(Atlas, Map IX) This was the first British attempt to map the area accurately. It\n\nwas in general use in Bechuanaland until 1965. The official maps, during the\n\nlast three decades of British rule in Bechuanaland, exclude Kasikili Island from\n\nthe territory of the protectorate. · South Africa 1,250,000 Special Sheet Katima Mulilo TSO 400/558, published\n\nby South Africa in 1949. (Atlas, Map X) This is the first 'modern' map of the\n\narea, based on new air photography, accurate astronomic ground control,\n\nbarometric height control, field annotation by surveyors, and a template\n\nlaydown of photographs. In July 1945, preliminary sunprints were distributed\n\nto officials in all the interested countries, including Bechuanaland, for\n\ncriticism, corrections and additions. Although the Bechuana respondents\n\nproposed changes in several locations close to Kasikili Island, they raised no\n\nobjection to the depiction of the Island as part of Namibia.\n\n35. Seiner's map and TSO 400/558 were drawn to the attention of the contemporary British\n\nauthorities, who failed to make any objection to the boundary at Kasikili Island, although they\n\nraised questions as to other aspects of the maps. GSGS 3915 is a production of official British\n\ncartography and thus goes beyond acquiescence or acceptance of Namibian claims. It is a\n\npositive admission against interest, to which Botswana is necessarily held.\n\n36. The position is then that during the colonial period all but one of the significant maps of\n\nthe area, that depict the boundary, of whatever provenance, show it in the southern channel.\n\nThe one exception, Bechuanaland 1:500,000 DOS 1965 DOS847(Z462) Sheet 2 Edition 1 ,\n\nwas the last British map of the Protectorate. Its representation of the boundary in what seems\n\nto be the northern channel can be shown to be a cartographic error resulting from a\n\nmisreading of the aerial photographs on which it was based.\n\n37. Thereafter, in 1985, the United Nations, in its role as custodian of Namibian sovereignty\n\nin the period before independence, published a large format map pursuant to a UN General\n\nAssembly resolution.11 (Atlas, Map XV) The territory of Namibia is shown on this map by\n\nhypsometric tinting that clearly covers Kasikili Island. Botswana was a member of the UN\n\nCouncil for Namibia, under whose auspices the map was published, but made no objection.\n\nSee Part Two, Chapter V.\n\n38. The foregoing factual record, which is elaborated in Part Two of the Memorial, amply\n\nfulfils the requirements under international law for acquisition of title to territory by\n\nprescription.\n\n39. In the case of states emerging from colonial rule, the principle of uti possidetis confirms\n\nthe territorial position existing at the time of independence. Since the judgement of the\n\nChamber of the Court in the Frontier Dispute case, the principle has been recognized as a\n\ngeneral principle of international law, but, as the Chamber recognized, it is a principle with\n\n'exceptional importance for the African continent.'12 It is embodied most particularly in the\n\n1964 Cairo Declaration of the heads of state of the Organization of African Unity in which all\n\nmember states 'solemnly . . . pledge themselves to respect the frontiers existing on their\n\nachievement of national independence.'13\n\n40. The Chamber succinctly defined the content of the doctrine:\n\nBy becoming independent a new State acquires sovereignty with the territorial base and\n\nboundaries left to it by the colonial power. . . . It applies to the state as i, i.e., to the\n\n\"photograph\" of the territorial situation then existing. The principle of uti possidetis freezes\n\nthe territorial title. . . .14 (emphasis in original)41. Botswana became independent on 30 September 1966. A photograph of the territorial\n\nsituation on that date would show that Kasikili Island was occupied and used by the Masubia\n\nof the Caprivi and was being administered by South Africa as the mandatory power, as it had\n\nbeen for almost half a century, with the full knowledge and acquiescence of the British\n\nauthorities in London and Bechuanaland. It is that territorial title which is frozen by the\n\nprinciple of uti possidetis.\n\nIII.\n\n42. The remainder of the Memorial is organized in an effort to assist the Court in considering\n\nNamibia's separate titles to sovereignty over Kasikili Island -- as a matter of treaty\n\ninterpretation and as a matter of prescription and the operation of the principle of uti\n\npossidetis:\n\nPart One deals with the interpretation of the Anglo-German Agreement of\n\n1890 in the light of its object and purpose, its preparatory work and the\n\nscientific context in which the terms of the Treaty must be analyzed.\n\nPart Two presents the subsequent conduct of the parties and their successors in\n\ninterest, both on the ground in the Eastern Caprivi and as embodied in the\n\ndiplomatic, official and cartographic activities relating to the area. It also\n\nexplains the legal relevance of this conduct to the interpretation of the Treaty,\n\nthe operation of the doctrine of prescription and the principle of uti possidetis.\n\nPart One\n\nThe Interpretation of the ANGLO-GERMAN Treaty of 1890\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA. The Issue before the Court\n\n43. The first ground on which Namibia contends that Kasikili Island belongs to it rests on the\n\nterms of the 1890 Anglo-German Treaty. The relevant words of the Treaty are those\n\nappearing in Article III(2) which describe the course of the boundary in the Chobe River:\n\n[T]he . . . line . . . runs eastward along that parallel [the 18° parallel of south latitude] till it\n\nreaches the River Chobe; and descends the centre of the main channel of that river to its\n\njunction with the Zambesi, where it terminates.15\n\n44. Article III(2) also states, '[t]he course of the above boundary is traced in general\n\naccordance with a Map officially prepared for the British Government in 1889.' The map\n\nreferred to appears as Atlas, Map II and an extract is at Fig. 3, following p. 16, infra.\n\n45. Kasikili is a small island in the Chobe River about 15 kilometres (nine miles) west of its\n\nconfluence with the Zambezi. The broader area involved -- the floodplain of the Zambezi -- is\n\nshown in Fig. 4, following p. 17, infra. Its general shape and position is shown in Fig. 5,\n\nfollowing p. 18, infra.46. The principal question for the Court is whether the northern channel, running north and\n\nwest of Kasikili Island, or the southern channel, running to the south and east of the Island, is\n\nthe 'main channel' of the Chobe River. If the main channel runs south of Kasikili Island, then,\n\nin terms of the 1890 Treaty alone, that island belongs to Namibia.\n\n47. Namibia submits that the southern channel is the main channel and, therefore, that Kasikili\n\nIsland belongs to Namibia.\n\n48. The following are the principal grounds for this position:\n\n· The 1890 Treaty, properly interpreted in the light of the language, the state of\n\nknowledge to be imputed to the negotiators, the object and purpose of the\n\nagreement, and the course of the negotiations leads to the conclusion that the\n\nintention of the Parties was to select the southern channel as the main channel.\n\n· Scientific analysis of the topography, hydrology and geomorphology of the\n\nChobe River and the surrounding area demonstrates that the southern channel\n\nis the main channel.\n\nB. The Relevant Rules of Treaty Interpretation\n\n49. The starting point in the process of treaty interpretation must be Articles 31 and 32 of the\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which the Court has accepted repeatedly as an\n\nexpression of the customary international law on the subject.16\n\n50. Article 31(1) provides:\n\nA treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be\n\ngiven to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\nIn addition, Article 31(3) prescribes that:\n\nThere shall be taken into account, together with the context:\n\n(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or\n\nthe application of its provisions;\n\n(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of\n\nthe parties regarding its interpretation;\n\n(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.\n\nArticle 31(4) adds that:\n\nA special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\n\n51. In addition, Article 32 permits recourse to 'the preparatory work of the treaty and the\n\ncircumstances of its conclusion' as a supplementary means of interpretationin order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine\n\nthe meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:\n\n(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or\n\n(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n52. Namibia believes that the Court will be best assisted in performing its task in the present\n\ncase if the principal points are presented in the following order:\n\ni. The geography of the disputed section of the boundary (Chapter I);\n\nii. The background to the 1890 Treaty: contemporary knowledge of the area\n\n(Chapter II);\n\niii. The object and purpose of the 1890 Treaty (Chapter III);\n\niv. The preparatory work of the 1890 Treaty and the circumstances of its\n\nconclusion (Chapter IV);\n\nv. The words of the 1890 Treaty -- the relevant legal considerations and the\n\nscientific evidence (Chapter V).\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE GEOGRAPHY OF THE DISPUTED SECTION OF THE BOUNDARY\n\n53. The element of the boundary between Namibia and Botswana of importance in this case is\n\nthe Chobe River. For the assistance of the Court in identifying the places referred to, Namibia\n\nhas prepared the foldout map at Fig. 6, following p. 19, infra. The pertinent section of that\n\nriver lies around an island called at various times Sulumbu's Island, Kassikiri Island, Sedudu\n\nIsland and, by Namibians for most of this century, Kasikili Island. The Island lies in the\n\nChobe River which, having in that location an approximately west-east alignment, divides at\n\nthe west end of the Island into a northern and southern channel that rejoin at the eastern end.\n\n54. The Chobe is an unusual river hydrologically, not only in the sector involved in the\n\npresent case, but also over much of its length. This unusual quality has a direct bearing on the\n\nidentification of its main channel in the vicinity of Kasikili Island.\n\n55. In approaching the question before it, the Court is invited to shed any preconceptions\n\nwhich it may have about rivers in general. When picturing a river, it may have in mind rivers\n\nin Europe such as the Rhine, the Seine, the Thames, the Volga and the Danube; in the\n\nAmericas, the St. Lawrence, the Mississippi, the Amazon and the Plate; in Asia, the Indus, the\n\nYangtze and the Mekong; and in Africa, the Congo, the Niger and the Nile. All of these rivers\n\npossess the attributes commonly associated with rivers in popular understanding: they have\n\nidentifiable sources; they run continuously downstream in an established course between two\n\nreadily discernible banks; and they carry a significant volume of water all year round. They\n\nare, in the technical language of hydrology, perennial rivers.56. The Chobe is a river of an entirely different kind. Though it is identified as a geographical\n\nfeature marked on a map, it is in a sense only a quasi-river. It is not a single continuous\n\nwatercourse steadily carrying water in a downstream direction from its own watershed to its\n\nmouth or to its junction with another river. It is, instead, part of a complex river system\n\nclosely associated with the Zambezi River lying to its north. The Chobe is not a perennial\n\nriver, but rather an ephemeral one. It carries a significant flow of water only when the\n\nZambezi River is in flood, from about December to July of each year. At other times, the\n\nwater in the lower reaches of the river is stagnant and does not flow 'downstream' to the\n\nZambezi.\n\n57. What follows is a description of the river in layman's language. It is based on the\n\nextensive scientific analysis of Professor W.J.R. Alexander, formerly Chief of the Division of\n\nHydrology and Manager of Scientific Services of the South African Department of Water\n\nAffairs and more recently Professor in the Department of Civil Engineering of the University\n\nof Pretoria. He is also the author of two major books pertinent to matters involved in this case,\n\nSouthern African Flood Hydrology (1990) and Flood Risk Reduction Measures (1993), as\n\nwell as a number of articles in South African and international scientific journals. Thus he has\n\na lifelong experience of scientific work on the rivers of southern Africa. His Report, along\n\nwith its Appendix containing maps, photographs, aerial photography and satellite images, is to\n\nbe deemed an integral part of this Memorial and is annexed as Vol. VI of this Memorial under\n\nthe title Identification of the Main Channel of the Chobe River at Kasikili Island.\n\n58. The Chobe has many different names at various stages along its course. Its source is in the\n\ncentral plateau of Angola where it is called the Rio Cuando. When it crosses the frontier into\n\nthe Caprivi Strip it becomes the Kwando and then the Mashi, which flows generally in a\n\nsoutherly direction into the Linyandi Swamp. There it comes up against the Linyandi Ridge,\n\nwhich cuts across the southerly course of the river from south-west to north-east and forces\n\nthe river to make a sharp left turn into a north-easterly course. At this point it is called the\n\nLinyandi River until it flows into Liambezi Lake. At the exit from the lake, the river, which\n\nfrom this point on is called the Chobe River on modern maps, begins, first flowing south-east,\n\nas determined by the south-easterly tilt of the land, until it strikes the Chobe Ridge, a sharply\n\nmarked escarpment extending in a south-west-to-north-east direction. At those times when\n\nthere is water in this part of the river, the Ridge forces it to make a right angle turn in a north-\n\neasterly direction.\n\n59. In fact, however, most of the time when the Chobe reaches this turning point there is no\n\nmore water in it. During its long course from Angola through the swamps along the Mashi\n\nand Linyandi Rivers, the flow originating upstream of the Eastern Caprivi is progressively\n\nreduced by evaporation loss so that, in the lower reaches of the Linyandi, the river ceases to\n\nflow and dries up for long periods, leaving only isolated pools of water which are sustained by\n\nlocal rainfall. (See Alexander Report, para. 5.8) Lake Liambezi, likewise, is dry much of the\n\ntime, often for many years at a stretch. It is known to have been dry in the 1940s and again\n\nsince 1986, except for a short period in 1989. Only in periods of very high river flow in the\n\nCuando does enough water reach the lake to fill it and exit through the gap at its eastern edge\n\ninto the Chobe. Thus, the waters in the Chobe, which appears on the map to be the nominal\n\ncontinuation of the Linyandi River, are hardly ever waters of the Linyandi River at all.\n\n60. Where do the waters of the Chobe come from then, if not from the upstream portions of\n\nthe river? There are three sources, none of them connected to the Linyandi River. The first is\n\nthe flood waters of the Zambezi, one of the major rivers in Africa. During the flood season,water spills over the banks of the Zambezi onto its floodplain lying mainly to the south of the\n\nriver in the triangular area between the Zambezi and the Chobe Rivers. Most of this water\n\nruns off along the south-eastward tilting surface until its flow is blocked by the Chobe Ridge,\n\nthe escarpment on the south bank of the Chobe River extending south-west/north-east. This\n\nescarpment, which runs in parallel with the southern bank of the southern channel of the\n\nChobe in the sector around the Island, thus firmly marks the line of the Chobe in the entire\n\narea involved in this case.\n\n61. One consequence of the annual rise in the waters of the Chobe in the Zambezi floodplain\n\nis that Kasikili Island itself is inundated for some five months in each year. At such times, the\n\nwaters spread in an unbroken sheet from the visible right bank of the river, which is fixed\n\nagainst the Chobe Ridge just to the south, northward over Kasikili Island and over the\n\nnorthern channel. At such times it is impossible to discern either the north bank of the\n\nsouthern channel or either bank of the northern channel.17\n\n62. The second source of the waters in the Chobe is also the Zambezi, but by a different route.\n\nA short distance above the confluence of the Zambezi and the Chobe lie the Mambova\n\nRapids.18 The rapids operate, in effect, like a weir. In times of flood they restrict the flow of\n\nthe Zambezi River and force the water back up the Chobe.19 Thus, during the first part of the\n\nflood season, water actually moves from the Zambezi into and up the Chobe from the\n\nMambova Rapids. This occurs in the months from January to March. During that period, the\n\nmovement of the waters of the Chobe is upstream, i.e., the reverse of what would normally be\n\nexpected. As the floods begin to subside, this flow reverses, and from April to July the waters\n\nflow in the normal direction downstream to its confluence with the Zambezi.\n\n63. The third source of the waters of the Chobe River in this sector is the runoff from the\n\nChobe Ridge -- the escarpment immediately contiguous to the south bank of the river --\n\nduring the rainy season.\n\n64. Thus, the waters of the Chobe River for the most part do not come from its sources to the\n\nnorth-west, but from the Zambezi, either across the floodplain or upstream from the Mambova\n\nRapids with the remainder comprising runoff from the Chobe Ridge. In the sector below\n\nNgoma Bridge and above Kazungula, the Chobe is not a river in the standard sense of the\n\nword but rather a watercourse which for parts of each year carries the flood waters of the\n\nZambezi floodplain back to the Zambezi River just above Kazungula.\n\n65. By August, however, the levels of water in the Chobe River fall below the height of the\n\nrapids at Mambova. From August until December, the water in the two channels in the region\n\naround the Island is stagnant. Upstream from Serondella, about 13 kilometres (eight miles)\n\nwest of the Island, the river is substantially dry during this period.\n\n66. It is of cardinal importance in understanding the issues in this case for the Court to keep in\n\nmind that all of the maps and photographs depicting this Island (except for some of the\n\nsatellite images in the Alexander Report) were made during the dry season when there is no\n\nwater flowing through the river. The visual images that appear in these representations as the\n\nseemingly clearly defined northern and southern channels around the Island are no more than\n\nstagnant pools of water caught behind the Mambova Rapids after the annual flood subsides. CHAPTER II\n\nTHE BACKGROUND OF THE 1890 TREATY:\n\nCONTEMPORARY KNOWLEDGE OF THE AREA\n\n67. It may be helpful to the Court if Namibia now examines the state of contemporary\n\nknowledge of the region prevailing when the 1890 Treaty was under negotiation. As will be\n\nappreciated, in light of the difficulties of movement in such an area as well as the limitations\n\non the technology of observation in 1890, descriptions of the region were not always fully\n\naccurate or consistent with one another. In the late nineteenth century, the prevailing opinion\n\nwas that the region was unexplored by Europeans. The English explorers, Aurel Schulz and\n\nAugust Hammar, wrote in 1897 of their trip of 1884, 'We were the first Whites to traverse this\n\npartly unknown country . . .'20 However, beginning in the 1850s, several European explorers\n\nand hunters began travelling to and offering descriptions of the Chobe River, thus filling in a\n\ngeneral picture of the character of the Chobe in the area of the dispute, particularly with\n\nregard to the impact upon the river of the Zambezi's seasonal flooding and its consequential\n\neffects upon the identification of the Chobe's southern bank and of the channels forming the\n\nriver.21\n\n68. The most famous of the Victorian travellers in the region was Dr. David Livingstone, who\n\nis reputed to have been the first non-African to see the Victoria Falls. His books on his\n\nAfrican travels were widely read by Victorians. His Missionary Travels and Researches in\n\nSouth Africa was accompanied by a map showing the general length and direction of the\n\nChobe.22 Extracts from the book are provided as Annex 129 to this Memorial, but the\n\nquotation of a few sentences will serve to show that the Chobe was seen even then as an\n\nunusual river:\n\n11th of November, 1853.23 -- Left the town of Linyanti . . . to embark on the Chobe . . .We\n\ncrossed five branches of the Chobe before reaching the main stream; this ramification must be\n\nthe reason why it appeared so small to Mr. Oswell and myself in 1851. When all the departing\n\nbranches re-enter, it is a large deep river. . . .24\n\n. . .\n\nThe course of the river we found to be extremely tortuous, -- so much so, indeed, as to carry\n\nus to all points of the compass every dozen miles. Some of us walked from a bend at the\n\nvillage of Moremi to another nearly due east of that point, in six hours, while the canoes,\n\ngoing at more than double our speed, took twelve to accomplish the voyage between the same\n\ntwo places. And though the river is from thirteen to fifteen feet in depth at its lowest ebb, and\n\nbroad enough to allow a steamer to ply upon it, the suddenness of the bendings would prevent\n\nnavigation; but, should the country ever become civilised, the Chobe would be a convenient\n\nnatural canal. We spent forty-two and a half hours, paddling at the rate of five miles an hour,\n\nin coming from Linyanti to the confluence. . . .25\n\n69. A description of the Chobe is also to be found in F.C. Selous's work, A Hunter's\n\nWanderings in Africa, published in 1895:\n\nThe next day (Sunday), we continued our journey westwards along the southern bank of the\n\nChobe, which here runs nearly due east. As we had been informed, we found that a dense\n\ncontinuous jungle, interspersed with large forest trees, came down in most parts almost to thewater. This jungle-covered land rises in some places abruptly, in others in a gentle slope,\n\nleaving along the shore a margin of open ground (from ten to a hundred yards broad), covered\n\nwith short grass, and formed, no doubt, of alluvial deposit. On the other side of the river, as\n\nfar as the eye can reach, stretches a wide expanse of flat, marshy country, intersected by\n\nnumerous deep, well-defined streams, that here form a sort of network between the Chobe and\n\nthe Zambesi.26\n\n. . .\n\nWhere the main channel of the Chobe was, I did not know; as far as we could see to the north\n\nand the west, the whole country was a sheet of water, interspersed with islands, and\n\nintersected here and there by deep streams.27\n\n70. Selous was travelling in July-August 1874 along the southern bank of the river, shortly\n\nafter the high flood season. He remarked on the rise of the escarpment on that 'shore' and the\n\nwide expanse of marshy land stretching as far as the eye could see to the north and west. None\n\nof the many streams that traversed the marsh appeared to him to be the main channel.\n\n71. The most focused early description of the Chobe in the immediate vicinity of Kasikili\n\nIsland appears in a short article by Dr. Benjamin F. Bradshaw, presented at the Royal\n\nGeographical Society and published in 1881 in the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical\n\nSociety, entitled 'Notes on the Chobe River, South Central Africa.'28 Dr. Bradshaw's article\n\nwas accompanied by a map (Atlas, Map I/2 and Fig. 7, following p. 27, infra)29 that is of\n\nimportance because of the unique detail in which it shows the stretch of the Chobe relevant to\n\nthe present case. Bradshaw's map was used by German cartographers for the next 30 years\n\nand by the British for even longer. The depiction of Kasikili Island on the 1889 Map is taken\n\ndirectly from Bradshaw's map, although much reduced in scale.30\n\n72. The passages in this article to which the attention of the Court is particularly directed are\n\nthe following:\n\nThe course of the river, so far as I have shown, is as nearly as possible east and west; at the\n\nmouth, the river appears to be about 200 yards wide, and there is no perceptible current. On\n\nthe south side the bank is about 12 feet high; for a mile and a half the opposite bank is clothed\n\nthickly with reeds, and hippopotami are often to be seen in the water.\n\nThe soil is more or less sandy, and a short distance from the bank on the south side you get a\n\nlow ridge of heavy sand, as seen in the map, and coloured yellow. The grass is there very\n\ncoarse and long. The shallow pan which I have marked, varies much in extent, being often\n\nquite dry in October and November; a large sheet of water is formed by the annual inundation,\n\nabout a mile square.\n\nThe river is bounded on the southern side by a high sandy ridge, clothed with forest, more or\n\nless thick; the ridge in some parts recedes a mile or more from the edge of the water, but in\n\nother parts it comes quite up to it.31\n\n73. Having written of the island of Impalera [sic], which is about six kilometres (four miles)\n\ndownstream from Kasikili Island, Dr. Bradshaw, going upriver, continued with the following\n\ndescription of the sector of the river in the region of Kasikili Island:The country for about four miles along the river is very rocky, the sandy ridge gradually\n\napproaching the banks; it is covered with thick forest, tangled vines, scrubby bush, and long\n\ngrass, and becomes the feeding-ground of numerous hippopotami at night. Under the ridge is\n\nto be seen one portion of the river coming from the north and another from the west; which\n\nlatter evidently leaves the northern channel, forming an island as shown in the map. This\n\nisland, as well as all the northern side of the river, as far as the rapids, is under water during\n\nthe annual inundation. At that time the rivers Zambesi and Chobe are one, the whole country\n\nbeing one vast lake as far as the eye can reach, with here and there a tree or small island\n\nappearing above the waste of water; on the south side, the water at the same period comes up\n\nto the edge of the forest growing on the sandy ridge (marked yellow in the map). Opposite the\n\nmarshes is a valley which, winding very much, extends for seven or eight miles in a southerly\n\ndirection; it is covered with large kameel-thorn trees, and grass from four to eight feet in\n\nheight.32\n\n. . .\n\nThe river rises annually from 15 to 18 feet; commencing in January it is at its full height in\n\nMarch, and falls until January again; it is never turbid; it fills very gradually at first, but the\n\ndecline is rapid, and goes on more slowly during the winter months. . . .33\n\n74. The Court will note that Bradshaw's description corresponds closely to that given in\n\nChapter I, supra, and the Alexander Report. Again, the prominent features are the ridge on the\n\nsouth bank and the striking character of the annual flood when 'the rivers Zambesi and Chobe\n\nare one, the whole country being one vast lake as far as the eye can reach,' with the southern\n\nbank of the river defined by 'the sandy ridge.'34 Dr. Bradshaw specifically remarked that\n\nduring the high water season the left bank of the river and the Island are completely\n\ninundated.\n\n75. Bradshaw's map is printed in three strips on a single sheet. (Atlas, Map I/2) We are\n\nconcerned only with the top strip which shows the easternmost (downstream) end of the map.\n\n(See Fig. 7, following p. 17, infra)\n\n76. The features of the Bradshaw map which call for special notice are the following:\n\n· The map clearly shows an island in the river at the left-hand end of the top\n\nstrip. This is evidently Kasikili Island. Dr. Bradshaw describes '[t]he country\n\nfor about four miles along the river' upstream from Impalera.35 The distance\n\nas shown on his map from the western end of Impalera Island to the island at\n\nthe left hand end of the top strip that has the approximate shape and\n\ndimensions of Kasikili Island is just over 6.5 kilometres (four miles).\n\nMoreover, Dr. Bradshaw indicates the existence of a north-south valley on the\n\nsouth side of the river just opposite the end of the island. This corresponds\n\nexactly with the location on modern maps of the Sedudu Valley through which\n\na stream called the Sedudu flows into the Chobe from the south.36 (See Atlas,\n\nMap XIV or Fig. 4, following p. 17, supra)\n\n· The map distinctly shows the northern and southern channels of the Chobe to\n\nthe north and south of Kasikili Island. Indeed, Dr. Bradshaw expressly\n\nmentions that 'there is to be seen one portion of the river coming from the\n\nnorth and another from the west.'37 The one coming from the west, the southern channel, is fully drawn, but Dr. Bradshaw indicates, by the lack of\n\ncolouring in most of the northern channel and by the pecked lines by which he\n\nmarks it, that he did not traverse the length of the northern channel. He states\n\nnear the beginning of his article, 'The portions of the river not coloured I have\n\nnot visited, but I think the supposed course marked to be about the correct\n\none.'38\n\n· In the box at the bottom left-hand corner of the map, the description of the\n\nsymbols used includes symbols for reeds and bushes 'along River-Banks.' The\n\nsouthern channel is clearly marked in this way.\n\n· The area south of the river in the vicinity of Kasikili Island is covered by the\n\nlegend '[s]and Ridge covered with bush extending many miles to the South.'\n\nThis is a layman's description of the escarpment described above, against\n\nwhich the flood waters of the Zambezi strike and by which they are channelled\n\ninto the Chobe. This comment is similar to the legend which appears south of\n\nthe river on the 1889 Map (Atlas, Map II)39 -- 'Sand belt with large forest\n\ncoming down to water's edge' -- and must, therefore, particularly be deemed to\n\nhave been in the minds of the negotiators who worked from that map.\n\n· In contrast with the sandy ridge or escarpment south of the river, the map\n\nshows the areas of grassy flats, marshes and swamps lying along the northern\n\nside of the river in time of inundation, especially north of Kasikili Island. In\n\nthose times, the northern bank of the southern channel would be covered by\n\nwater as would be both banks of the northern channel. But the southern limit of\n\nthe southern channel would be visible, whilst every feature of the northern\n\nchannel would be obscured.\n\n77. German travellers and explorers did not reach the area until the first decade of the present\n\ncentury, after the Treaty had been concluded. Their reports, however, closely echoed those of\n\ntheir English predecessors. Rothe, for example, remarked on the prominence of the ridge on\n\nsouth bank, looking upstream from Kazungula:\n\n[I]mmediately beyond the rapids the rivers are swampy, and the land, especially within\n\nGerman territory, has an alluvial character and is very fertile, one could call it the Zambesi-\n\nDelta, according to its similar character to the mouth of the Nile.40\n\nOn 27 January 1909 Streitwolf travelled along the Chobe River and must have passed Kasikili\n\nIsland. Particularly interesting are his frequent references to the high southern bank of the\n\nChobe:\n\n[T]he walls of reeds lining the river seldom permitted a glance over the flat, monotonous\n\nlandscape. Only where the river flowed close to the cliff-edge of Bechuanaland was the\n\nscenery more varied. . . . it continued the next morning . . . a river, which except for the\n\noccasional small rocky spot was consistently 2 to 3 metres deep, continually broadened,\n\nwhere the German bank began to be forested, and it was idyllically beautiful to float on the\n\nwater's smooth surface, which was surrounded on both sides by high forest, out of which\n\noften a delicate palm tree thrust upward. . . . Towards nine o'clock we arrived at the rapids.\n\nHere I had to disembark while the natives brought the canoe about 500 metres through the\n\nrapids, a task which took around one hour. I . . . had time to rejoice over the magnificentlandscape. A rocky crag extends from the high cliff-edge of Bechuanaland down and into the\n\nriver, which pours through a tumble of stones and forms numerous forested islands. At two\n\nplaces the river drops around 1 metre, while the entire drop amounts to about 3 metres. On the\n\nsouthern bank, the rocks partly rise out of the water and the whole picture is framed\n\nbeautifully by the forest vegetation. . . . Below the rapids the river broadens to approximately\n\n250 metres. Both banks were covered with beautiful forest, the English bank towering over\n\nthe German.41\n\n78. Although it cannot be said that the persons who negotiated the treaty had specific\n\nknowledge of these reports and the geographical characteristics they disclose, the English\n\nrepresentatives, at least, were very familiar with African affairs and followed developments\n\nclosely. It is not unlikely that they had become aware of the general import of these explorers'\n\nreports by the time the negotiations began. For the German negotiators, however, the situation\n\nwas different. It was generally acknowledged that they had little knowledge of the area.42\n\nAlfred Zimmerman, author of various works on German colonial policy, wrote that the\n\nGerman negotiators in 1890 had not consulted geographers in connexion with the delineation\n\nof the boundary, but relied completely on imprecise and insufficient English maps.43\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nTHE OBJECT AND PURPOSE OF THE 1890 TREATY\n\n79. Namibia will begin the process of treaty interpretation by examining first the object and\n\npurpose of the 1890 Treaty, as is prescribed by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the\n\nLaw of Treaties.\n\n80. The 1890 Treaty had a wide objective -- to settle the boundaries of the British and German\n\nspheres of influence in Africa. To that end, it established limits to the claims of the parties not\n\nonly in the region involved in this case, but also in West Africa and in East Africa. In\n\naddition, Germany recognized a British protectorate over Zanzibar and territorial dispositions\n\nin East Africa largely favourable to Great Britain. The Treaty was, in short, the last act of the\n\n'scramble for Africa' among the European powers in the nineteenth century. Of principal\n\nimportance to Germany was the one major non-African element in the Treaty -- the British\n\ncession to Germany of the island of Heligoland.44\n\n81. The objective of the delimitation articles was expressly stated by Sir Percy Anderson, the\n\nBritish negotiator, in a memorandum to the British Ambassador in Berlin two days before the\n\nfinal signing of the Treaty:\n\nIn the delimitation Articles our object has been so to define the spheres [of influence] as to\n\nendeavour to avert the danger of the revival of 'hinterland' disputes. The immense area\n\nreserved to British influence in East Africa is, from its extensive coast-line with its valuable\n\nharbours to the western watershed of the Upper Nile, made conterminous with specified\n\nterritories; no gap is left in the boundaries. The German sphere is equally protected.45\n\n82. Sir Percy's comment is equally pertinent to South West Africa, where the negotiators\n\naddressed the determination of the boundary between, on the one side, western and northern\n\nBechuanaland and, on the other, German South West Africa. The object was to establish firmand stable boundaries between the spheres of influence of the two powers so as to avert\n\nfurther friction between them.\n\n83. Neither British nor German policy objectives were affected by the question of whether the\n\nboundary would follow the northern or the southern channel of the Chobe around Kasikili\n\nIsland. So broad were the macro-objectives for the two parties that they can impact on that\n\nmicro-question in only the most general respects. The negotiators were not concerned with the\n\nallocation of small areas, but with a comprehensive 'African transaction.' At the large scale on\n\nwhich they were thinking, the important objective was the identification of a recognizable\n\nboundary. This was achieved by the selection where possible of a geographical line that\n\nappeared clearly on the available relatively small-scale maps, in the present case, the line of\n\nthe Chobe.46 Their common interest was in the stability and certainty of the boundary. In\n\nprinciple, the parties must have wished to agree upon a fixed and readily identifiable\n\nboundary, rather than one that for about five months of the year would be invisible or obscure.\n\nFor this reason, the selection of the line of the northern channel rather than the line of the\n\nsouthern channel would have been inconsistent with the basic object and purpose of the\n\nTreaty.\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nTHE PREPARATORY WORK OF THE 1890 TREATY AND THE\n\nCIRCUMSTANCES OF ITS CONCLUSION\n\nA. In General\n\n84. The Treaty was not an agreement negotiated locally on the basis of a visual inspection of\n\nthe prospective boundary. After a period of discussion beginning in 1886, the Treaty was\n\ndrafted in the course of intense negotiations in Berlin and London over a relatively short time\n\nfrom the beginning of March through the end of June 1890. The draughtsmen had no first\n\nhand acquaintance with the physical features of the area, although they may have had some\n\ngeneral familiarity with the works of the explorers and travellers. They worked with the help\n\nof the 1889 Map. (Atlas, Map II)47\n\n85. The principals on each side were among the greatest of nineteenth century statesmen: Otto\n\nvon Bismarck for the Germans (although he resigned as Chancellor in March 1890 -- only\n\nmonths before the conclusion of the negotiations -- and was replaced by Baron George von\n\nCaprivi) and the Marquis of Salisbury, Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary of Great Britain.\n\nSir Edward Malet was the British Ambassador in Berlin, and Count Hatzfeldt represented\n\nGermany in London. The chief negotiator on the British side was Sir Percy Anderson, a\n\nhighly regarded associate of Salisbury's, who had been responsible for Britain's African\n\ncolonial policy as head of the African Department in the Foreign Office since its creation in\n\n1883. As such he was intimately acquainted with African affairs and developments and must\n\nhave been aware of some of the explorers' accounts then being published. It is said that he was\n\n'the man who, for the next decade, would do more than anyone else to see that Britain got her\n\nrightful share in the Scramble for Africa.'4His German counterpart was Dr. Friedrich\n\nRichard Krauel, Geheimer Legationsrath in the Foreign Office and Director of the Colonial\n\nDepartment during the main period of the negotiations. B. The Decision on the Line of the Chobe River\n\n86. In south-west Africa the problem of delimitation was much easier than in other areas, for\n\nhere the interests of the parties could be more readily accommodated, given the vast territory\n\navailable. Moreover, the existing commitments on both sides were still modest. The area in\n\ncontention was 'Ngamiland,' lying north of British Bechuanaland, a territory assigned to\n\nneither Power and extending from the 20th to the 24th degree of east longitude. (See Atlas,\n\nMaps II, III)49\n\n87. The borders of Britain's Bechuanaland Protectorate were the 22nd parallel on the north\n\nand the 20th meridian on the west. Beyond the 22nd parallel, the territory was regarded as\n\n'barren, unhealthy, and unfit for European settlement.'50 Nevertheless, as early as 1886, there\n\nwere proposals for a northward extension of the Protectorate to the Zambezi to protect the\n\nmain trade routes from South Africa to the centre of the continent from encroachment by the\n\nGermans and the Portuguese. These routes ran through Lake Ngami, some 350 kilometres\n\n(220 miles) to the south and west of Kasikili Island to Victoria Falls. German entrepreneurs\n\nand colonists were already active in the area, seeking to buy land and establish relationships\n\nwith local chiefs in the Lake Ngami area.51\n\n88. Germany, for its part, had already concluded an agreement with Portugal that the\n\nboundary between them would be along the line from Andara to Katima Mulilo on the\n\nZambezi, thus providing it with access to that river.52 Germany, therefore, had a special\n\ninterest in obtaining British recognition that the German sphere of influence in South West\n\nAfrica extended as far east as the Zambezi.\n\n89. Thus the main objectives of the two parties were well defined long in advance of the\n\nnegotiations: for the British, control of Lake Ngami53 ; for the Germans, recognition of a\n\nGerman sphere of influence extending eastward to the Zambezi. These issues had been under\n\ndiscussion between Britain and Germany since 1886, and they dominated the development of\n\nthe British position on the border between the two spheres of influence in the area of our\n\nconcern.\n\n90. The division ultimately embodied in Article III(2) of the Treaty was foreshadowed in a\n\nmemorandum of 23 May 1886 by Sir Hercules Robinson, then High Commissioner of the\n\nBechuanaland Protectorate, on '[T]he Proposed Extension of the Bechuanaland Protectorate to\n\nthe Northwards, as far as the Zambesi River.'54 After rehearsing the need to protect the trade\n\nroutes and recounting the ominous advances of the Germans in Ngamiland, Sir Hercules put\n\nforward his proposed solution:\n\nThat the Bechuanaland Protectorate be extended to the Zambesi River. The extension might\n\nbe bounded on the west by a continuation of the present western boundary (namely, the 20 of o\n\nE. long.,) until it intersects the 18of S. lat.; on the north by the 18 of S. lat. until it reaches\n\nthe Chobe River; thence down the centre of that river till it reaches the Zambesi River; thence\n\ndown the centre of that river, past the Victoria Falls. . . . 55\n\n91. It will be seen that this proposal secured the main British objective, Lake Ngami, while\n\nincidentally confirming a German sphere of influence to the north that would stretch east to\n\nthe Zambezi -- the area that came to be known as the Caprivi Strip. With the one exception\n\nthat the north-south boundary ultimately agreed upon was the 21st rather than the 20thmeridian, Sir Hercules's proposal completely embodied the formula adopted by the\n\nnegotiators in Berlin four years later.\n\n92. When the negotiations resumed in earnest in the spring of 1890, Sir Percy Anderson set\n\nout for the Foreign Secretary a list of 13 points in dispute with Germany over the entire range\n\nto be covered by the Treaty, one of which was 'Lake Ngami.'56 He described the district on\n\nthe basis of information gathered 'from what trustworthy sources are available' as being\n\nroughly bounded by the 24th degree of longitude to the east, the 20th to the west and to the\n\nsouth by the 22nd degree of south latitude. 'The large affluent of the Zambesi, the Chobe,\n\nborders on the north [of] the territory, which appears to be swampy and unhealthy.'57 This\n\nsuggests that by this time the Chobe River was firmly linked to the Lake Ngami issue, as the\n\nlikely northern border of the Ngamiland area to be allotted to Great Britain with the 'swampy\n\nand unhealthy' area to the north of it consigned to Germany. But the Chobe itself does not\n\nseem to have been of much concern to either party, except as a convenient natural feature to\n\nmark the boundary.\n\n93. Just over a month later, on 30 April 1890, Sir Percy addressed another memorandum to\n\nLord Salisbury (referring to the earlier memorandum) for the purpose evidently of recording\n\nSir Percy's understanding of the ways in which the points in dispute were to be discussed.\n\nWith regard to point ten, 'Lake Ngami,' he wrote that this would be dealt with by\n\nextending the German line roughly from the 20th to the 22nd degree of east longitude and\n\nrunning it up to the Chobe River, down which the Germans should have access to the\n\nZambesi.58\n\nLord Salisbury responded, 'Yes, this is all right.'59\n\n94. On 15 May 1890, Anderson reported:\n\nAs regards Lake Ngami, I anticipate little difficulty. He [Dr. Krauel] has assured me that he\n\npersonally is prepared to accept the line suggested by the High Commissioner, which runs\n\nalong the 20th parallel of south latitude to the 22nd degree of east longitude, which it follows\n\nto the 18th degree of south latitude, whence it runs eastward to the Choke River, which it\n\nfollows to its junction with the Zambesi.60\n\n95. At length, on 5 June 1890, the German Ambassador in London, Count Hatzfeldt,\n\npresented to the British Foreign Office a project of understanding, which, under the item\n\n'Ngami' stated'L'Allemagne y renounce en supplant la frontière propose par Sir Percy\n\nAnderson. . . .'61Anderson reported that Count Hatzfeldt having 'discussed with me to-day all\n\nthe minor African questions . . . was satisfied as regards -- 1. Lake Ngami. . . .'62\n\n96. The state of the geographic knowledge of the negotiators is illustrated by the exchange on\n\nthis point between Anderson and Krauel:\n\nHe [Dr. Krauel] considers his acceptance will be a concession for which he should receive\n\ncredit in a general bargain, as, according to most maps, it will leave Lake Ngami in the British\n\nsphere; but I have pointed out to him that, as one map places the lake on the 22nd degree of\n\nlongitude, it is uncertain whether the line does not practically give to the Germans access to\n\nits waters.63Lord Salisbury thought it might even be west of the 22nd, and at some point before 21 June,\n\nthe eastern border of the British sphere, which had been put at the 22nd meridian in\n\nAnderson's 15 May discussions, was shifted one degree west to the 21st, in response to these\n\nconcerns.64\n\n97. To eliminate any doubt, the final version of Article III(2) of the Treaty expressly\n\nstipulated that the British sphere 'includes Lake Ngami.'\n\nC. The Creation of the Caprivi Strip\n\n98. As noted above, recognition of German access to the Zambezi was implicit in the British\n\nproposal for a boundary between the two spheres of influence along the 18th parallel and the\n\nChobe. As with Lake Ngami, however, the negotiators were conscious of the uncertainty of\n\ntheir geographical knowledge of the area. The 18th parallel was thought to be considerably\n\nsouth of Andara, the western terminus of the Katima Mulilo-Andara segment of the border\n\nagreed between Germany and Portugal. But it might have been further north, reducing the\n\nGerman access to the Zambezi secured by that agreement to the vanishing point. Thus, ten\n\ndays before the end of the negotiations, the German negotiators asked for a clause specifying\n\nguaranteed access to the Zambezi for Germany through a corridor of no less than 32\n\nkilometres (20 miles) in width.65 This clause parallels the one securing British jurisdiction\n\nover Lake Ngami. It is no surprise that each side made sure its principal objective in the area\n\nwas protected no matter how the geography on the ground would turn out.66\n\n99. The quid pro quo for Lake Ngami was not the Caprivi Strip, but concessions to Germany\n\nin north-west Africa in return for assured jurisdiction over the lake.67 The truth is that the\n\nBritish had little interest in the country north of the Chobe River. As already noted, Sir\n\nHercules Robinson thought it 'barren, unhealthy and unsafe for European settlement,'68 while\n\nSir Percy Anderson said it was 'swampy and unhealthy.'69 Lord Salisbury himself, in a speech\n\nin the House of Lords explicating the Treaty, described it as\n\nat the head of the waters of all the affluents of the Chobe and the Zambesi, over an\n\nimpracticable country, and leading only into the Portuguese possessions, into which, as far as\n\nI know, during the last 300 years there has been no very eager or impetuous torrent of trade.70\n\n100. It was no doubt assumed in some German quarters that access to the Zambezi River\n\nwould in some way enable Germany to navigate by river steamer to its East African colonies\n\non the Indian Ocean.71 This is understandable given the entrepreneurial interests of the\n\ncolonists and the limitations of contemporary geographical knowledge. Some of the early\n\nEnglish explorers entertained the same idea.72 But the Germans made no particular point of\n\nthis in the negotiations. And the sophisticated officials representing the parties surely knew\n\nthat the presence of the Victoria Falls on the Zambezi, some 50 kilometres (31 miles) to the\n\neast of the confluence with the Chobe, clearly excluded the possibility of any continuous\n\nnavigation along the Chobe and the Zambezi from the west to East Africa. This was evident\n\neven by 1857 when Dr. Livingstone published his Missionary Travels and Researches in\n\nSouth Africa in which the map at the end of the volume clearly marks the location of Victoria\n\nFalls on the Zambezi. Dr. Livingstone notes the advice given to him by the Makololo in\n\nrelation to a route to the east coast:\n\n[M]y present object being a path admitting of water rather than land carriage, this route [via\n\nLake Tanganyika] did not promise so much as that by way of the Zambesi or Leeambye. TheMakololo knew all the country eastwards as far as the Chafe, from having lived in former\n\ntimes near the confluence of that river with the Zambesi, and they all advised this path in\n\npreference to that by the way of Zanzibar. The only difficulty they assured me of was that in\n\nthe falls of Victoria.73 (emphasis added)\n\nAs was to be expected, many German authors, politicians and newspapers were also dubious\n\nabout the value of the Caprivi Strip as access to the river.74\n\n101. The Caprivi Strip, then, was a natural consequence of the boundary along the 18th\n\nparallel and the Chobe River, proposed by the British and accepted without objection by\n\nGermany. It achieved at one and the same time the British objective of a northward extension\n\nof Bechuanaland, securing control of both Lake Ngami, and the desire of Germany for British\n\nrecognition of a German sphere of influence east to the Zambezi. It was an ingenious solution,\n\ncharacteristic of the sweeping territorial dispositions of African territory from the lofty\n\nperspective of Berlin.\n\nD. The Introduction of the Concept of 'the Centre of the Main Channel'\n\n102. Thus, by early June 1890, the main outlines of the settlement in south-western Africa\n\nwere agreed. The northern boundary of the British sphere of influence would be the 18th\n\nparallel until it intersected with the Chobe, and after that would be the Chobe River.75\n\n103. On 10 June 1890, a minute prepared by Count Hatzfeldt, the German Ambassador in\n\nLondon, and communicated to Lord Salisbury on that day, recorded the first attempt to define\n\nthe content of the agreement that was in due course to emerge in relation to the Chobe River:\n\nDan la conference d'aujourd'hui entre Lord Salisbury et El Commute Hatzfeldt l'Accord\n\ngeneral des deuce Governments a été officiellement constant sour less points savants:\n\n. . .\n\n2. La frontière entre El territories Allemand et El territories Anglais du sud-ouest de l'Afrique\n\nsuivra à partir du point qui a été convenu dans des arrangements antérieurs . . . allant de là\n\nau nord où de ce degré [21st degree of longitude] touche El 18° degré de latitude sud. De là,\n\nla ligne de démarcation se portera à l'est longeant El centre du fleuve Tcholi [sic] jusqu'à son\n\nembouchure dans El Zambèse.76\n\n104. On 17 June 1890 Lord Salisbury and Count Hatzfeldt initialled a document recording the\n\ngeneral agreement between the two governments on the following points. For reasons that are\n\nunexplained in the available materials, the text as agreed on that date was settled in French.77\n\nIn that language the relevant words are:\n\nDe là, la ligne de démarcation se portera à l'est longeant El centre du Fleuve Tschobi jusqu'à\n\nson embouchure dans El Zambési.78\n\n· The English translation of the text reads: 'Thence, the line of demarcation\n\nshall be carried to the east along the centre of the River Tschobi, up to the\n\npoint where it flows into the Zambesi.'79 · A translation into German prepared by Count Hatzfeldt and printed in a\n\nSpecial Edition of the 'Official Gazette' of Berlin of 17 June 1890, reads as\n\nfollows: 'nach Osten längs dem Tschobifluß bis zu dessen Mündung in den\n\nZambesi.'80\n\n· A translation of the German into English was forwarded to the Foreign Office\n\non the next day reading as follows: 'thence eastward along the River Tchobi up\n\nto its junction with the Zambesi.'81\n\n105. It is to be noted that despite the appearance in the French text of the phrase 'centre du\n\nfleuve' and its reproduction in the English translation as 'centre of the River,' the German\n\ntranslation made no reference to it, but mentioned only the 'Tschobifluß' -- the Chobe River. It\n\nappears that in Count Hatzfeldt's opinion, at least, nothing turned on the expression 'the centre\n\nof the river.'\n\n106. The original English formulation was retained as late as 21 June 1890 when Sir Percy\n\nAnderson sent to Sir Edward Malet 'a draft of the Articles of Agreement which have been\n\ndrawn up by Dr. Krauel and myself for submission to our respective Governments,' which\n\nwas immediately forwarded to Lord Salisbury.82 The wording in the relevant section was:\n\n[The boundary] runs eastward along that parallel till it reaches the River Chobe, and descends\n\nthe centre of that river to its junction with the Zambesi, where it terminates. It is understood\n\nthat, under this arrangement, Germany shall have free access from her Protectorate to the\n\nZambesi by the Chobe. 83\n\n107. On 24 June 1890, the principals on both sides remitted any remaining points of detail\n\narising with respect to the agreement of 17 June to 'be adjusted in a Convention to be drawn\n\nup [by] Sir Percy Anderson and Dr. Krauel in Berlin.'84\n\n108. Only at this point, on 25 June 1890, a week before the Treaty was signed, did the notion\n\nof the 'main channel' appear. The British Foreign Secretary instructed the British Ambassador\n\nin Berlin, inter alia, to insert in Article III(2) the words 'the main channel of' following the\n\nwords 'the River Chobe, and descends the centre of,' so that the whole phrase thus assumed its\n\nfinal form: '. . . descends the centre of . . . the main channel of [that river] . . .'85\n\n109. It is important to note that the initiative for this addition came from the British side and\n\nthat the proposal was expressed in English. Only thereafter was the German text altered from\n\nCount Hatzfeldt's earlier translation '. . . langs dem Tschobifluß . . .' to '. . . und setzt sich dann\n\nin Thalweg des Hauptlaufes dieses Flusses . . .' Although the English word 'centre' was\n\ntranslated into German as 'Thalweg,' in other respects, the German formulation follows the\n\nEnglish in referring to the 'Hauptlauf' ('main channel') 'dieses Flusses' ('of that river').\n\n110. No explanation was given for the introduction of this new element, and it has not as yet\n\nbeen possible to trace in the British Foreign Office papers any prior internal discussion of the\n\nchange. The 1889 Map used in the negotiations showed the Chobe River as dividing into\n\nseparate channels at some five locations between the point in the west at which it crossed the\n\nGerman-Portuguese border and the point in the east where it joined the Zambezi. In particular,\n\nthere was a major division of channels immediately downstream from 'Mai-inis Tn,' marked\n\non the map with the legend '[l]arge island enclosed between two main branches of the Chobe.'\n\nIt may be relevant also that the explorers remarked on the many streams of the Chobe and thedifficulty of identifying the main channel. See paras. ___, infra. Although no one could tell\n\nfrom the map which was the appropriate channel to identify as the border, to the Foreign\n\nOffice, no doubt it seemed better to refer to the 'main channel' than to disregard the problem\n\naltogether.\n\nE. The 1889 Map\n\n111. As noted above, Article III(2) states, 'The course of the above boundary is traced in\n\ngeneral accordance with a Map officially prepared for the British government in 1889.' The\n\nwords were inserted sometime between the French draft of 17 June and the final Treaty text of\n\n1 July. The map referred to is Map of Matabililand, Uncorrected Proof No. 2, 1889. (See\n\nAtlas, Map II)86 No boundary line is drawn on this map. (See Fig. 3, following p. 16, supra)\n\n112. A manuscript minute signed by Edward Hertslet87 and dated 7 July 1890, attached to a\n\nlater (1890) version of the map which is bound up with the 1890 Treaty in the British Foreign\n\nOffice archive, records that '[t]his [the 1889] map was not annexed to the Anglo-German\n\nTreaty of 1 July 1890; but Sir Percy Anderson told me today that it was the map alluded to in\n\nArt. III, para. 2, as the \"map officially prepared for the British Government in 1889.\"'88\n\nAlthough the scale of the map is small (1:1,584,000), it is just sufficient to show Kasikili\n\nIsland and the two channels of the Chobe running to the north and south of it, just to the east\n\nof the 25th meridian and north of the 18th parallel.\n\n113. In the depiction of that stretch of the river on the 1889 Map, two details are significant.\n\nOne is that the area immediately to the north of the river and a little way west of Kasikili\n\nIsland is shown as being swampy. The second is that just south of this stretch of the river\n\nthere appears the legend: '[s]and belt with large forest coming down to water's edge.' This is in\n\nfact the same prominent escarpment described in the Alexander Report and Chapter I, supra,\n\nand which was the subject of so much comment in the writings of Bradshaw and the other\n\nexplorers. It can be seen in the modern photograph of the area that appears in the Alexander\n\nReport, Appendix, Sheet 20, Photograph 2, taken from the north looking southward across\n\nKasikili Island. It clearly marks the line of the southern bank of the southern channel of the\n\nriver -- a line that no flooding or movement of the river waters could obscure. By contrast, the\n\nindication on the map of the swampy region to the north of the river shows that the line of the\n\nnorthern channel of the river could be hidden in the marshes and by the annual floods\n\ndescribed by the early travellers.\n\n114. A further element of importance is that on this map the river divides into two branches\n\njust north of the point of its intersection by the 18th parallel. Here the map bears the legend:\n\n'large island enclosed between the two main branches of the Chobe, full of swamps and\n\nlagoons.' This is notKasikili Island, but the way in which it was dealt with has some bearing\n\non the question in this case.89 Another copy of the same map (Atlas, Map III), also found in\n\nthe Public Records Office, shows the line following the branch of the Chobe south of this\n\nisland, thus assigning it to Germany rather than Britain. This choice, which gave the Island to\n\nGermany, was in all likelihood influenced by the fact that the large island was 'full of swamps\n\nand lagoons' thus rendering the river shore to its north too obscure a feature to serve as a\n\nboundary.90\n\nF. Conclusions Regarding the Preparatory Work115. The 1890 Anglo-German Treaty was directed towards the division on a grand scale of\n\nthe interests of the parties in East, West and South Africa. In relation to the area in question\n\nthe negotiations were conducted largely on the basis of a relatively small-scale map. There\n\nwas little detailed negotiation about the specific consequences of boundaries in particular\n\nareas. Certainly, there was no negotiation about the precise course of the Chobe River as such.\n\n116. It is, however, possible to derive from a perusal of the available materials a sense of the\n\ngeneral philosophy of the Treaty. It was to establish boundaries that would be as clear as\n\npossible in the particular circumstances. In choosing the Chobe River, the negotiators selected\n\nwhat they could identify as a major and prominent geographical feature. They were aware,\n\nperhaps from prior writings and certainly from the 1889 Map that the character of the terrain\n\nchanged at the river -- from the floodplain and swamps to the north of it to the sandy ridge\n\nand forest that lay to the south of it. It would have made little sense for the negotiators, having\n\nregard to this change in the terrain, to have constructed a boundary which left in the British\n\nsphere territory that was more naturally a continuation of the terrain to the north. Had they\n\nknown that Kasikili Island was annually covered for a period of five months by water spilling\n\nover from the Zambezi (and that therefore the very existence of the northern channel would be\n\nobscured to the point of invisibility, whereas the course of the southern channel could always\n\nbe identified by its contiguity with the southern bank and the adjacent sand ridge) they could\n\nhardly have reached any other conclusion than that use should be made of such a permanently\n\nvisible natural feature for the purpose of identifying the 'main' channel in which the boundary\n\nshould be drawn.\n\n117. The preparatory work is also of assistance in construing the expression in Article III(2),\n\n'the centre of the main channel' of the Chobe River. The records show that the formula\n\nevolved from the original wording -- 'the centre of the River Chobe' -- to 'the centre of the\n\nmain channel of the River Chobe.' This evolution attributes a dominant position to 'the main\n\nchannel' and a subordinate role to 'the centre' of it. The 'main channel' must be found first; the\n\n'centre' can necessarily only be found afterward. This point is equally pertinent to the German\n\ntranslation of the formula '. . . im Thalweg des Hauptlaufes. . . .' In the same way as with the\n\nEnglish text, the search must first be for the 'Hauptlauf' and for the 'Thalweg' only after the\n\n'Hauptlauf' has been found. The 'Hauptlauf' cannot be identified by first seeking to find the\n\n'Thalweg.'\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nTHE WORDS OF THE TREATY: THE MAIN CHANNEL OF THE CHOBE RIVER\n\n118. The words requiring interpretation by the Court are 'the centre of the main channel of\n\n[the Chobe] river.' In this case, unlike some others, there can be no doubt about the\n\nidentification of the Chobe River. The 1889 Map shows a clearly marked river which, in the\n\nstretch in the vicinity of the Island, bears the name 'Kuando or Chobe River.' There is no\n\nquestion that this is the river referred to as the boundary in Article III. Likewise, as is noted in\n\nparas. 158-159, infra, the location of the 'centre' of the main channel has never been in\n\ncontention between the parties. Thus the crucial term, on the meaning of which the treaty\n\nbranch of the case turns, is 'the main channel.' Namibia will now address the interpretation of\n\nthat term. A. Legal Considerations\n\n119. The 1890 Treaty contains no definition of the expression 'main channel' of the Chobe\n\nRiver. The range of possibilities covered by the expression is quite wide. As Stephen B.\n\nJones, an acknowledged authority on boundary-making has observed, it could, in theory, refer\n\nto the channel that is most used, the widest, the deepest or the one that carries the most\n\nwater.91\n\n120. Nor do the other provisions of the 1890 Treaty provide by implication the contextual\n\nguidance that might be helpful. Consideration of the other references to rivers in the definition\n\nof boundaries elsewhere in the Treaty yields, with one exception, only a reference to 'the\n\ncourse' of a river or a direction that the boundary 'ascends' or 'follows' the river. The exception\n\nrelates to the Aka River, mentioned in Article IV(1), where the boundary 'ascends the mid-\n\nchannel.' But none of this is of any help here, and the regrettable truth is that the negotiators\n\nof the Treaty followed no uniform usage in their description of river boundaries.92\n\n121. In the absence of any definition in the words of the Treaty, Namibia believes that the\n\napproach to be followed is the one Botswana expressed in its Supplementary Written\n\nSubmissions to the JTTE of 15 April 1994:\n\nThe provisions of the Anglo-German Agreement refer to \"the centre of the main channel\" of\n\nthe Chobe. There are other examples of treaty provisions referring to factual or geographical\n\ncriteria such as a crest line, or a watershed line or an escarpment line: see the Judgment in the\n\nTemple case (Merits), I.C.J. Reports, 1962, p. 6 at p. 15. In such cases the factual criterion is\n\nadopted as or converted into the legal criterion. But it does not cease to be in essence a\n\nquestion of fact.93\n\nAgain, in the Conclusions of these same Submissions of 15 April 1994, Botswana gave a\n\nposition of first prominence to such considerations:\n\nFirst: The central question is the interpretation and application of the words 'main channel' of\n\nthe River Chobe. These words involve a reference to a question of fact and, in so far as may\n\nbe necessary, a question of scientific fact, calling for expertise in hydrology, geology and\n\nhydrogeomorphology.94\n\n122. This approach is confirmed by judicial and arbitral precedent. In addition to the Temple\n\ncase referred to by Botswana in the Submissions just cited, mention may also be made of two\n\narbitral awards.\n\n123. The first is the Palena arbitration between Argentina and Chile in 1966 in which a\n\ncentral issue was the determination of the 'major' channel of a boundary river.95 The case\n\ninvolved the interpretation of an arbitral award rendered by King Edward VII in 1902.\n\nThough it was an arbitral award and not a treaty that was the subject of interpretation, the\n\nprinciples applied to the one are equally applicable to the interpretation of the other. Indeed,\n\nthe Court of Arbitration said so in terms:\n\nIn the view of the Court two principles must dominate its approach to the problem now before\n\nit. The first is the general principle that where an instrument (for example, a treaty or an\n\naward) has laid down that a boundary must follow a river, and that river divides into two ormore channels, and nothing is specified in that instrument as to which channel the boundary\n\nshall follow, the boundary must normally follow the major channel.96\n\n124. The tribunal then proceeded to the identification of the major channel by reference to\n\nboth 'historical and scientific grounds.'97\n\n125. The historical grounds included, first, 'a passage, illustrated by a map, both dated 1907'\n\npublished by the Argentine Office of International Boundaries in a volume about the\n\ndemarcation of the boundary, and, second, an extract from an official Memorandum, dated 9\n\nDecember 1913, from the Argentine Legation in Santiago to the Chilean Ministry of Foreign\n\nAffairs, both of which identified the eastern channel as the major channel.98 (The historical\n\nevidence in this case has been discussed in Chapter IV, supra; the map evidence is discussed\n\nin full in Part Two, Chapter V, infra.)\n\n126. The award then stated that 'this recognition of the Eastern Channel as the major channel .\n\n. . can be confirmed on scientific grounds.'99 The Court expressed the opinion that 'the three\n\nprincipal criteria to be applied in a problem of this kind are length, size of drainage area, and\n\ndischarge, preferably in terms of annual volume, though authorities differ as regards their\n\nrelative importance.'100 The Court reached its conclusion '[o]n the basis of the historical and\n\nscientific evidence thus reviewed.'101\n\n127. This approach to the identification of geographical features was followed in a more\n\nrecent arbitral award, also rendered between Argentina and Chile in the case of the Laguna\n\ndel Desierto of 1994. One of the principal issues there was the identification in one sector of\n\nthe boundary determined by the same 1902 award of 'the local water-parting' connecting one\n\nlocation on the boundary to another. The sector in question was not examined by and was\n\npoorly known to those who prescribed the boundary. Not until 40 years after the award was\n\nthe true location of the water-parting discovered, and even then, as it turned out, it was not a\n\n'local' but a 'continental' water-parting. A dispute developed between the parties as to the\n\ncorrect course of the boundary.\n\n128. The Arbitral Tribunal held that the boundary should follow the line of the water-parting\n\ndiscovered in 1942 as being the one best conforming to the words used in the relevant\n\nboundary instrument, the 1902 award. As the Tribunal stated:\n\nNeither can the Tribunal accept the argument of Chile according to which the application of\n\nthe Award of 1902 in the light of geographical knowledge acquired subsequently would be\n\nequivalent to its revision through the retrospective appreciation of new facts. The Award of\n\n1902 defined, in the sector which is of interest for this Arbitration, a frontier which follows a\n\nnatural feature which, as such, does not depend on the actual knowledge of the area but on its\n\ntrue layout; the knowledge of it changed but the terrain existed throughout. 102\n\nThus, like the Palena case before it, the Laguna del Desierto case demonstrates that the\n\nidentification of a disputed boundary defined by a natural feature is to be determined by the\n\nfacts as they are known to the tribunal at the time of the decision of the dispute.\n\n129. It is in reliance upon authorities such as these as well as upon the approach hitherto\n\nadopted by Botswana that Namibia now approaches the task of identifying scientifically the\n\nmain channel of the Chobe River. B. The Scientific Evidence\n\n1. In general\n\n130. It should be understood that Namibia's position does not depend on any changes in the\n\ngeneral configuration of the Island and the surrounding area since the Treaty was signed.\n\nThus, Namibia accepts that there have been no significant changes in the location of the\n\nnorthern and southern channels since 1890.
