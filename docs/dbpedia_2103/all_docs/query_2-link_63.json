Such records would be valuable; and might not some of them occupy their leisure hours in the study of Natural History?.... Interesting observations would then certainly be made, and new facts added to our stores of knowledge.\"—'Chambers's Journal,' p. 831; Dec. 23, 1876.\n\nLONDON:\n\nPRINTED BY WEST, NEWMAN & CO., 54, HATTON GARDEN.\n\n1882.\n\n-ii-\n\nLONDON:\n\nPRINTED BY WEST, NEWMAN AND CO.\n\nHATTON GARDEN, E.C.\n\n-iii-\n\nPREFACE.\n\nThe following Report contains a summary of investigations of a Committee, appointed by the British Association for the Advancement of Science, at York, in 1881, to consist of Professor Newton, Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown, Mr. John Cordeaux, Mr. Philip M. C. Kermode, Mr. J. Hardy, Mr. R. M. Barrington, and Mr. A. G. More, for the purpose of obtaining (with the consent of the Master and Elder Brethren of the Trinity House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and the Commissioners of Irish Lights) observations on the Migration of Birds at lighthouses and lightships, and of reporting upon the same at Southampton in 1882. Mr. Cordeaux to be the Secretary.\n\nAn abstract of the Report was read by Mr. Philip M. C. Kermode at the meeting of the Association, held at Southampton, in August, 1882.\n\nThe returns relating to Scotland have been arranged by Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown; for the East Coast of England, by Mr. Cordeaux; the West Coast of England, by Mr. Kermode; and those for the Coasts of Ireland, by Mr. R. M. Barrington, and Mr. A. G. More.\n\n-v-\n\nCONTENTS.\n\nPAGE East Coast of Scotland 1 East Coast of England 16 West Coast of Scotland 43 West Coast of England 58 Irish Coast 78\n\n-1-\n\nEAST COAST OF SCOTLAND.\n\nIceland and Faroe.—Schedules, &c., were, as before, forwarded to Iceland and Faroe. Returns have come from Faroe, the results of which I prefer to keep under a separate heading, as they usually come in when the rest of the Report is well advanced.\n\nOf Saxicolinæ there is one record on May 13th, when one Wheatear was seen on board the 'Arcturus,' thirty miles east of the Orkney Isles. Of Hirundinidæ, one seen at Thorshavn on May 22nd. Of Otidæ, one Long-eared Owl was seen at Vivalvig, Strómó, on June 27th. Of Ardeidæ, one Night Heron, Nycticorax griseus (Linn.), was killed at Videreijde on May 4th. In autumn several Turtle Doves, Columba Turtur, were seen, and one shot at Nólsó on Sept. 7th. Of Rallidæ, one Water Rail was killed in the hospital garden, at Thorshavn, on Oct. 31st. Of Laridæ, one Pomatorhine Skua (young), was killed near Kirkebó on Oct. 26th. Of Rallidæ, one Coot, Fulica atra, was shot at Nólsó on Nov. 8th.\n\nThe winds prevailing at the time of the above records for the most part southerly and easterly in Faroe, but on May 13th and 22nd southerly and westerly, and also S.W. on Nov. 8th.\n\nThe usual papers were sent to twenty-six stations, as before. With Iceland, Faroe and Fair Isle we have on this line thirty stations in all.\n\n-2-\n\nTwelve stations on the East Coast of Scotland returned filled-in schedules, against eight last year—1880—out of the twenty-six. Many of these returns are very light, but those from Isle of May, Bell Rock and Pentland Skerries are unusually full, showing great highways of migration, and also that from Sumburgh Head. We shall have more to say on this in our general remarks at the end of the Report.\n\nThe stations are as follows, commencing in the north. The dates upon which the various stations have sent in returns are shown in the list by the positions of the asterisks preceding the consecutive numbers. The work done compares favourably with that of 1880, but we receive as yet only twelve returns from twenty-six stations; however short, others will be acceptable, even if only negative information.\n\nThose sending no returns have not in all cases given reasons. Attention to this is earnestly requested (vide 2nd Report, p. 2).\n\nThe numbers are the same as in the 2nd Report, 1880, but another for Fair Isle has been inserted as \"7B.\"\n\n1879, '80, '81. * * 4.

I would also refer here to my \"Third Report on Scottish Ornithology,\" already referred to in 'Migration Report, 1880,' p. 4, as having been read, but not yet printed (Feb. 1882).\n\nNotes have been kept upon about 25 species of waterfowl and about 50 species of land birds by our reporters on the east coast. Spring migration I have not kept distinct in this Report. Obituary at each station, inappreciable at Scottish stations, will be noticed where necessary under General Remarks.\n\nOwing to Mr. T. Anderson having been almost entirely sailing to and fro in the Mediterranean, I regret that I can show no returns this year from Mid-Atlantic, which is to be regretted, as it would be instructive to learn what are the results of a contrary prevailing wind to that of 1880. Possibly, however, Mr. R. Gray may yet be able to give us some returns of interest culled from the Mediterranean log, which may raise other points of interest.\n\nThe following short notes on weather are compiled from the 'Times' Register for 1881, and checked by my own schedules:—A sudden change of temperature at the beginning of August, colder by about two degrees than July. Rainfall excessive over all Scotland, except northern half where it was less than average; cold and wet all August, about six degrees colder than corresponding period of 1880. Prevailing wind W., seldom veering to E., until Aug. 23rd; thereafter in Scotland prevailing E. and N.E.; on Aug. 31st N. winds prevailed, N.E., and continued till about Sept. 6th; thereafter W. and N.W. till 16th; then S. and S.E. till 21st; from 22nd to 24th E.; 24th to 30th S. to W.; -4- Oct. 1st to 10th S.; 10th to 13th strong W.; 14th gale from E., and continued E. and S.E. to end of month. S.E. to S. strong winds and gales, or light from Nov. 1st to 11th; S.W. strong and a gale 15th and 16th; frost on 17th; 22nd S. to S.W. and W., heavy gales in N. and W. Unsettled, with frequent changes of wind and weather, many W. gales till end of month, and till Dec. 8th. N. and E. on both coasts from Dec. 9th to 12th, S. on 13th, and S. and W. on 14th; S. and W. till 20th, when E.; and W.N.W. on 21st. Prevailing W. and S.W. till end of month.\n\nNotes.—Prevailing winds at the time of the rush of Falconidæ were W., veering from S.W. to N.W. in Aug.; after 23rd E.; on and after Aug. 31st till Sept. 6th N. At XIV., on Aug. 19th, a Sparrowhawk was seen sitting on the ground, and almost daily for some time after. The nearest breeding-place I know of is at Tongue, N. Sutherland; wind at the time was light S., and weather clear. No doubt it is difficult to discriminate often between local and general migrations of Hawks by our data; thus at XIV. also, on Aug. 23rd and 24th, a Sparrowhawk was seen flying south on the former date, and N.E. on the latter; on the former date the wind was light S., on the latter N.E.; this would therefore appear like a local migration.\n\nThe only addition to the list of stations is Fair Isle, No. 7 b.\n\nIn all spring records the numbers of stations begin at the most southerly, or with the higher numbers. In all autumn records the numbers of stations begin at the most northerly, or with the lower numbers. The maximum station, or station sending most returns of the species, is indicated when thought necessary.\n\nTurdidæ.—Autumn: Records at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Girdleness, Bell Rock, and Isle of May (maximum). Earliest at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd; latest at Sumburgh Head, Dec. 8th. Rushes at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd to 30th (see notes infra); also Oct. 20th. Redwings and female Blackbirds migrating between 14th and 24th. Great S.E. gale on 14th. At Pentland Skerries, Fieldfares, Thrushes, and Blackbirds, Nov. 5th and 6th, flying N.E. all day; also smaller rushes at Sumburgh Head, Dec. 1st to 8th. Time of day: Mostly daytime, but night of 13th to 14th at Bell Pock. \"Storm burst at 10.10 a.m. on 14th.\" Notes: A great rush of migrants took place at the -5- date of 22nd to 23rd Sept. at Isle of May (station 27), but no corresponding rush is recorded at Bell Rock (station 26). At Isle of May it continued all day. The weather was thick haze, approaching to fog, with a continuous downpour of rain; wind S.E. \"All the birds seen to-day appeared perfectly bewildered.\" The following species occurred on 22nd alone: Thrushes, Redstarts, one Robin, one Blue-throated Warbler (C. Wolfi), Swallows, Chaffinches, one Nightjar (the first ever captured or seen here, and sent to me along with the Blue-throated Warbler and others), one Corn Crake (seldom seen here). Golden Plovers (large flock), Ringed Plovers, Lapwings, \"rush\" of Curlews, two Snipe, Sandpipers and Waders, and Dunlins. This great migration continued more or less all the latter part of September at this locality, during which time there appeared Yellow Buntings, Bramblings, Wheatears (or Stonechats), Pipits, and Wagtails; numbers of Robins on 23rd. N.B. Later in the report under these species I will refer back to this note.\n\nSaxicolinæ.—Spring: Bell Rock, and Whalsey Skerries. Wheatears. Earliest at Bell Rock, April 14th; latest at Bell Rock, May 2nd. Rush on May 2nd, at Bell Rock. General Notes:—Accompanied by many other species not recognised; on that day also a large bird struck, rebounded, and fell into sea.—Autumn: Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, Isle of May, and Inch Keith. Wheatears. Earliest at Sumburgh Head, Aug. 14th; latest at Pentland Skerries, Sept. 30th. Rushes scarcely appreciable, Aug. 22nd and 28th, at Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, and Pentland Skerries; and Sept. 24th and 30th, at Pentland Skerries, Isle of May, and Inch Keith. Rushes at Pentland Skerries on several dates. Besides Wheatears, Redstarts. Earliest at Isle of May, Aug. 22nd; latest at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd. Whinchats (or Blue Janets), also at Isle of May, Sept. 21st. Prevailing winds E. and S.E. General Notes (see under Turdidæ).\n\nSylviinæ.—Spring: Robins at Cromarty and Montroseness; only two records. Earlier at Cromarty, March 20th, but left same date; later at Montroseness, April 14th, flying about rock.—Autumn: Tarbat Ness, Cromarty, and Isle of May. Robins. Earliest at Cromarty, Sept. 16th, and were the first seen since March 6th (see Spring); latest seen Dec. 15th. At Tarbat Ness first seen Oct. 10th. Rush Sept. 22nd and 23rd, at Isle of -6- May (see Notes under Turdidæ); also Oct. 21st, at Isle of May (\"appear to be very small specimens.\") Mr. Agnew preserved one for me in spirits on Dec. 15th, but whether one of these small specimens I cannot as yet say. N.B. Spanish examples are known to be very much smaller than British (vide Howard Saunders and H. E. Dresser).\n\nPhylloscopinæ.—Autumn: Gold Crests at Sumburgh Head, Tarbat Ness, and Isle of May. Earliest at Tarbat Ness, Sept. 10th (two seen); latest at Isle of May, Sept. 27th. Rush, a small one, Oct. 24th, 25th, and 27th, at Isle of May. General Remarks:—Mr. Agnew says, \"I expect more,\" but no more appeared in his later schedules. A general movement of this species appreciable also about Sept. 10th to 18th.\n\nParidæ.—Spring: Tit. One record at Isle of May, April 23rd. General Remark:—One alighted on lantern at 11 p.m.—Autumn: Tits at Pentland Skerries and Inch Keith. Earliest at Inch Keith, Aug. 5th (a number at night); latest at Pentland Skerries, Oct. 6th (one all day). Another struck N.W. side of lantern of Inch Keith on night of 5th to 6th. General Remarks:—Aug. 5th, at Inch Keith (as above), \"earlier than usual.\"\n\nTroglodytidæ.—Spring: Common Wren. One record from Isle of May, March 19th.—Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest at Sumburgh Head, Aug. 3rd (left); latest at Pentland Skerries, Nov. 16th. Others Oct. 6th and 8th. Rush (inappreciable) on these later dates.\n\nMotacillidæ.—Spring: Bell Rock and Isle of May (only two). Wagtails. Earliest at Isle of May, March 12th; latest at Bell Rock, April 13th. General Remarks:—The latter \"running over the rocks, but leaving at high tide, as all birds do that land upon these rocks\" (J. Agnew).—Autumn: Pentland Skerries and Isle of May (three records). Wagtails. Earliest at Pentland Skerries (three all day), when a gale from N., Aug. 27th; latest at Isle of May, Sept. 24th, \"when a few new-comers, having more white upon them than the few residents, appeared.\" Also occurred at Pentland Skerries, Sept. 10th. Pipits at Whalsey Skerries, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May (few records). Earliest at Whalsey Skerries, Aug. 28th (following Sparrowhawk), but all left next day; latest at Pentland Skerries, Oct. 25th (six struck at night). Rush (on small scale) at Isle of May, Sept. 24th, 25th, and 26th. General Notes:—Mr. Agnew speaks of -7- some being always here, but additions on Sept. 24th. Possibly Mr. Agnew alludes, however, to Rock Pipits as the residents. The Meadow Pipit is probably the species first seen as additions on Sept. 24th. N.B. The Rock Pipit is a larger bird than the Meadow Pipit; please shoot one of the \"resident birds\" and then one of the \"additions,\" and if carefully compared, I think Mr. Agnew will detect the difference.\n\nHirundinidæ.—Spring: Cromarty, Auskerry, Sumburgh Head, and Whalsey Skerries. First arrivals at Auskerry, May 1st (Martins and Swallows remained three days and then left); latest, at Whalsey Skerries, June 27th (a few flying about). Rush hardly perceptible. General Notes:—At Sumburgh Head four pairs all summer; all disappeared on night of July 20th. That night one pair slept on the staircase-window.—Autumn: Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Cromarty, and Isle of May (a number). Earliest (see remarks under Spring Migration, supra, July 20th); latest at Sumburgh Head, Oct. 1st (one seen). No great rush appreciable, but flocks of Swallows and Martins seen at Auskerry Aug. 1st and 4th, and on 1st at Isle of May (one found dead previous night after heavy gales); (see Notes under Turdidæ, supra) part of a general rush of migrants.\n\nFringillidæ.—Spring: Isle of May, Bell Rock, Sumburgh Head (considerable movement). Linnets. Earliest at Isle of May, March 4th (asleep all night on doorway): two green Linnets. Latest at Isle of May, April 14th (seen). General Notes:—Two days previous \"considerable number of Chaffinches, which are very unusual at this season; also one Bullfinch.\" From a remark of Mr. Agnew, that some of the latter breed on Isle of May, I suspect these \"Linnets\" will prove to be Twites or Mountain Linnets, Linota flavirostris ? These Linnets are also noted at Bell Rock on April 10th, and at Sumburgh Head on March 7th.—Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Isle of May, and Inch Keith (large movement). Earliest (Grey Linnets) at Isle of May, Aug. 18th (mostly young, apparently in broods, in large numbers); latest at Sumburgh Head, Jan. 14th, 1882 (three seen). Rushes (Chaffinches) at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd to 26th (see Notes under Turdidæ). Brambling also on 24th (one sent me for identification). Siskin at Inch Keith, Sept. 25th. [General Notes:—A desultory migration, kept up of Linnets and Siskins -8- (which are rare on the Isle of May), occurred Oct. 4th and 5th. A Redpole on 8th, at Sumburgh Head.] A rush between Oct. 20th and 27th at Isle of May, during which time Redpoles (20th and 24th), Chaffinches (22nd), Bramblings (21st), one Siskin (27th), and Grey Linnets or Twites (24th), at Sumburgh Head; about fifty, along with ten Larks (see Alaudidæ.). Occasional birds seen at Isle of May:—Nov. 12th, one Siskin; 28th, one hen Linnet; and on Nov. 21st, at Inch Keith, one Siskin. On Dec. 3rd, at Isle of May, one Redpole, preserved in spirits (vide infra), and one Brambling, same time and place. On the 4th, Green Linnets at Sumburgh Head, and in Jan., 1882 (latest), three Green Linnets on 14th. In Shetland prevailing winds during the winter were from S.W., \"and consequently no strange birds visited us.\" A flock of Mealy Redpoles arrived at Lerwick, and took up their abode for a time in Mr. P. T. Garrick's garden, at Prospect House. This movement doubtless belongs to the Spring Migration of 1882. In August unusually large flocks of Greenfinches were observed by Mr. Service near Dumfries; left after two weeks, and reappeared in January, 1882.\n\nEmberizidæ.—Spring: Isle of May and Bell Rock. Earliest at Bell Rock, March 17th (one \"Snowflake\" flying from N.W. to S.E.); latest (and only other spring record) at Isle of May, April 9th (three \"Mountain Sparrows\" identified as Snow Buntings).—Autumn: Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Dunnet Head, Tarbat Ness, Isle of May, and Inch Keith, Snow Buntings, numerous records, and reported as unusually plentiful at many stations. Earliest at Isle of May, Sept. 24th, where, Mr. Agnew writes, \"they are never plentiful\"; latest, Dec. 10th to Jan. 28th, at Isle of May. Rushes at Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Dunnet Head, Sept. 20th to 25th (note migration of other species at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd—see notes under Turdidæ). Rushes spasmodical, at different places, on different dates. Rush Dec. 3rd to 21st; after, stragglers (i.e., flocks of forty or fifty).—Weather: In October winds S. and N.W., at Sumburgh Head, to fresh E. and N., cloudy, clear, or showery. In November S. gale on 4th at Pentland Skerries. Calm or N. on 9th, S.S.W. or S. on 14th, and on 17th S. or N. December variable from light S.W. at Isle of May to fresh N.E. and S.E., light W. and light -9- S.W. Besides Snow Buntings, a flock of about 250 Common Buntings are reported from Sumburgh Head on Nov. 6th (\"a compact flock\"), at 10 a.m.\n\nAlaudidæ.—Spring: A spring rush is reported at Bell Rock between Feb. 5th and 25th; or possibly this may only belong to migration of 1880. Great numbers of Larks mixed with Rose Linnets, Starlings, and other species, from 2 to 5 a.m.; great numbers struck; wind on arrival light S.W., on departure fresh N.E., fog and rain. Feb. 18th, great numbers, all Larks, greatly exhausted, seen asleep, and others struck, but none found dead; wind light E.S.E., haze. On 19th, \"small birds, not recognised, flew about for an hour, and left at dawn\"; and on 25th great numbers, all Larks, much exhausted, at 1.30 a.m.; left after an hour's rest at dawn, flying N.W.—Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May (numerous). Earliest at Sumburgh Head, Sept. 15th (breeds here, but left to-day); latest at Isle of May, Dec. 1st (two seen). Rushes at Isle of May, Sept. 24th; numbers on 25th and 26th, increased up to 27th; also at Pentland Skerries (accompanying Wheatears); also fewer on Sept. 15th, 16th, and 18th. Rush at Pentland Skerries, striking all night, Oct. 26th; stragglers on 1st and 8th.—Weather: Fresh S. wind Sept. 1st to 8th, to fresh S.E. and clear on 26th. Nov. 24th, at Sumburgh Head (along with Grey Linnets), fresh S., cloudy; and Dec. 1st, at Isle of May, two seen, as above recorded.\n\nSturninæ.—Autumn: Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Dunnet Head, and Isle of May. Unusually few, but all about same time. Earliest at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, Oct. 20th and 21st; latest at Dunnet Head, Jan. 15th, 1882 (date of return of schedule). General Notes:—Resident all winter at many localities as at Auskerry (\"all winter\"). The scarcity of the Starling on migration this autumn is noteworthy (vide conditions of wind and weather as compared with other years).\n\nCorvidæ.—Spring: Bell Rock and Isle of May. Earliest at Bell Rock, March 10th (seen on balcony-rail); latest, \"five Rooks,\" at Bell Rock, flying about. May 1st. Rush (apparently, April 12th and 13th) at Bell Rock (Black Crows and a good many \"Grey Crows\" with them). On 16th, three Rooks flying N.—Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest July 15th, at Pentland Skerries (mixed with Jackdaws);-10- remained till middle of August, and then disappeared; latest Nov. 10th, two Ravens at Pentland Skerries, flying W., but no Rooks after Aug. 15th. Ravens also at Pentland Skerries, July 29th. Hooded Crows. Earliest Sept. 14th, at Pentland Skerries; latest on Nov. 5th, at Pentland Skerries. Rush on Oct. 2nd, at Isle of May (large numbers).\n\nCypselidæ.—Autumn: Only records at Sumburgh Head. Earliest Sept. 13th, five seen at 6 p.m., light N.W. airs, clear; next record Sept. 16th, one seen, light W., clear; latest Sept. 27th, one, light S.W., haze.\n\nCaprimulgidæ.—Autumn: Only one record at Isle of May, where the first was observed, Sept. 26th, along with a great Rush of other migrants (see Notes under Turdidæ, antea).\n\nStrigidæ.—Autumn: Records at Auskerry and Isle of May. Earliest Aug. 25th, when one \"Grey Owl\" seen at Isle of May, fresh E., heavy rain, and haze; latest Dec. 19th, one reddish brown Owl, at 1 p.m., S.W., clear, at same station. Other dates, Oct. 15th to 18th, two Owls stayed three days, arriving at 4 p.m. on 15th, leaving at 4 p.m. on 18th, at Auskerry, N.W. gale, showers, and haze. Also Oct. 24th, one \"light brown\" Owl at Isle of May, S.S.E., showery; also Nov. 28rd, one seen at Isle of May, 3 p.m., S.W., clear.\n\nFalconidæ.—Autumn: Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Bell Rock (all insular). Earliest July 28th, at Whalsey Skerries, one Hawk flying N.; latest Dec. 14th, at Isle of May, two \"large Hawks.\" Rush in August and September, at Bell Rock, from which I have twenty-two returns in that time; never so many seen here before. Kestrels, principally at Isle of May, till Aug. 18th; latest Sept. 25th. Sparrowhawk. A rush at Pentland Skerries between Aug. 19th and 28th, or the same birds reappearing: all seen during the daytime, along with all other Hawks. Merlin, one on Sept. 22nd, at Sumburgh Head; another on Oct. 11th, feeding, on Snow Buntings, shot; other two seen. Falcon, one seen flying S.W., at Pentland Skerries, on Oct. 10th. Buzzards one (by description) flying S. at Isle of May, Sept. 27th. \"Large Brown Hawks,\" or simply \"Hawks,\" occurring principally at Isle of May. A rush between Sept. 6th and 19th, with E. winds (see General Notes on weather). A great rush of Hawks, Eagles, &c., took place all over the country at the latter end of September. Amongst others the -11- following are recorded:—Ospreys, Harriers, Common and Honey Buzzards. Especially Fifeshire is noted (vide 'Field,' Oct. 8th, 1881, p. 514). Rough-legged Buzzards are recorded from localities in Forfar, Perth, and Stirlingshire, at similar stations as they usually appear at when their migration takes place, i. e., along almost precisely the same lines.\n\nPelicanidæ.—Autumn: Records from Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest July 1st, Gannets pass Pentland Skerries daily in flocks of twelve to forty, or singly, and continue till middle of September, which is the latest record I have. Rush past Pentland Skerries appears to have been on Aug. 19th, when 2300 were counted between daylight and dark, flying chiefly E., and very few going W. On Aug. 4th large numbers at 2 p.m., at Sumburgh Head, fresh breeze, cloudy. At this station Gannets are noted as very scarce all summer, owing, it is believed, to scarcity of herrings.\n\nArdeidæ.—Spring: Only one Heron recorded at Whalsey Skerries, on May 29th, 8 p.m., S.E. light airs, clear; fog from N.W. after 11 p.m.—Autumn: Records at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest Aug. 16th, at Sumburgh Head, flying N., chased by Gulls, light E. airs; latest Nov. 24th, at Isle of May, one seen, strong S.W., showers; Rush Sept. 3rd to 6th, at Isle of May, during which time eight were seen, all flying S., and four on the 5th, came from N., alighted and remained; wind on 3rd fresh E., and haze; on 5th fresh N.E., clear; and on 6th light W., and haze (see Note, infra). Rush also on Oct. 12th, 13th, and 14th, previous to gale of 14th, but statistics scanty. All Herons seen at Isle of May almost invariably fly S. Prevailing winds at Isle of May, W., till gale on 14th from N.N.E.\n\nAnatidæ.—Wild Geese. Spring: Records at Whalsey Skerries, Auskerry, and Isle of May. Earliest March 6th, at Whalsey Skerries, eight resting on island for several days, E. gale, and haze; latest April 21st, at Isle of May, large flock flying E., accompanied by Curlews.—Autumn: Records at Whalsey Skerries, Sumburgh Head, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Isle of May, and Inch Keith. Earliest \"Wild Geese,\" Oct. 2nd, at Isle of May, thirteen flying W. in line. Earliest \"Barnacle,\" only record, Aug. 12th, at Inch Keith, one flying due N.; latest \"Wild Geese,\" Dec. 23rd, at Isle of May. Immense flock flying -12- N.E., 11.80 a.m., S.W., haze, approaching to fog; and another flock same day, at 12.30 p.m. Besides the above, one \"Brent\" Goose (?) is noted on Nov. 25th, flying N., with S.W. gale, and showers. Swans.—Spring: Records at Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Bell Rock. Earliest Feb. 27th, at Sumburgh Head, two \"Wild Swans,\" apparently much fatigued, flying S.; latest May 6th, a flock flying N.E. Autumn: Records at Sumburgh Head. Earliest Nov. 12th, at Sumburgh Head, eight flying S.E.; latest Dec. 25th, at Sumburgh Head, two resting on a lock near the lighthouse, where they frequently rest on their way south every year. Note:—If these are the same birds each year, it is interesting as proving the undeviating lines of autumn flight of waterfowl. Eider Ducks.—Spring: Whalsey Skerries only; noted as arriving at breeding haunts on March 9th. Autumn: Records at Whalsey Skerries, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest July 5th, when Eiders left the island at Whalsey Skerries. \"The Drakes had left previously,\" light S., haze, and fog; latest Oct. 20th, at Auskerry, ten Eiders remained all day; they also remain at Auskerry all winter. Rush, largest number recorded at Pentland Skerries on Oct. 8th, when a flock of 100, mostly males, were seen swimming past the island, light S. breeze, and fog; and forty took shelter on Oct. 12th, at 9 a.m., at Whalsey Skerries, S.W. gale and rain; and all left next day. Sheldrake.—Autumn: Having remained here (Auskerry) all summer since end of June, leave in September or October. Records from Auskerry and Pentland Skerries. Earliest Aug. 27th, at Pentland Skerries, one found dead; latest Oct. 5th, at Pentland Skerries, flock flying S.E. Other dates, Aug. 31st, at Pentland Skerries, flying S.; Sept. 3rd, flying about light, not striking. Teal.—One on Sept. 21st, at Isle of May, another at Pentland Skerries, on Oct. 8th. Wild Duck at Isle of May, Sept. 24th, Oct. 4th, and Nov. 21st. Long-tailed Duck at Sumburgh Head, Nov. 12th (about twenty). On Sept. 12th Tufted Ducks were abundant on Loch Leven,—the most abundant species there,—and the young were not able to fly, \"some being not larger than a Water Rat.\" Other species seen were Scaup, Golden-eye, Pochard, Teal, and Mallard (P. D. Maloch, in lit.).\n\nRallidæ.—Corn Crake. Spring: One arrival noted at Cromarty on May 19th. Autumn: One in. Isle of May, Sept. -13- 22nd (seldom seen here; vide Notes under Turdidæ); also Oct. 22nd, at Isle of May, and one at Pentland Skerries; the two dates are both dates of rushes of other migrants. The Spotted Crake has been recorded at several land stations, and found to recur at several where it occurred before. Thus one at Aberuthven Wood this season, and one at the same place three years ago (P. D. Maloch, in lit.).\n\nCharadriadæ.—Golden Plover. Autumn: Whalsey Skerries, Auskerry, Pentland Skerries, Dunnet Head, and Isle of May. Earliest Aug. 3rd, at Pentland Skerries; latest Dec. 23rd. Rushes Sept. 21st and 22nd, at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May; also on Oct. 17th and 18th, at Sumburgh Head and Auskerry. Oystercatcher.—Spring: Arrived Feb. 24th at breeding haunts on Whalsey Skerries; two recorded at Isle of May, on April 12th. Autumn: Records mostly in August, at Whalsey Skerries; left Whalsey Skerries on Aug. 26th; scattered birds seen at Isle of May between 8th and 25th; three records. Lapwing.—Spring: Arrivals in April 1st to 15th, at Whalsey Skerries and Isle of May. Rushes about 1st and 11th, scarcely perceptible. Autumn: Pentland Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest Aug. 27th, at Isle of May; latest Nov. 22nd. Rush past Isle of May, Sept. 22nd; \"large numbers,\" by description, flying high (see Turdidæ). Ringed Plover.—Only date given is Sept. 22nd, at Isle of May, by description (see Turdidæ).\n\nScolopacidæ.—Curlew. Spring: One record at Isle of May, March 4th, four flying N.E. Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest July 20th to 30th, at Isle of May; latest Dec. 31st, also at Isle of May. Rushes Sept. 22nd, at Isle of May, numbers; and at Pentland Skerries, a few. Maximum of records at Isle of May, but in all not many. Woodcock.—Autumn: Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May. Earliest at Isle of May, Sept. 22nd; latest, beginning of December. Rush Oct. 20th, and for some days previous; also arrival same day of many Redwings (see Turdidæ). Snipe.—Autumn: Pentland Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest Aug. 31st, at Isle of May, one rose off island and flew away S.; latest Dec. 21st, at Isle of May, one seen. Rush scarcely appreciable, but appeared also on Sept. 22nd, at Isle of May. Records mostly of single birds; these two species exceedingly scarce this autumn; severe winter of 1880-81 killed many, and -14- severe spring interfered with breeding. \"Sandpipers.\"—Autumn: Pentland Skerries and Isle of May. Earliest Sept. 22nd, at Isle of May, a number (see under Turdidæ); latest Dec. 17th, also at Isle of May, large numbers. Rushes on these dates at Isle of May. Stragglers: species recognised and named: Dunlins, Redshanks (probably), Common Sandpiper.\n\nLaridæ.—Terns. Spring: Arrived at Whalsey Skerries, Pentland Skerries, and Cromarty (Lesser Tern). Earliest May 28th, at Whalsey Skerries; and at Pentland Skerries, \"arrived after hatching!\" May 12th, and remained till August; belongs to an autumn movement (?); also at Cromarty, arrived on June 15th, left Aug. 20th. Terns appear irregular in hatching and dates of leaving various stations; but most left all stations in August, and recorded at Isle of May, passing S. Sept. 12th, 22nd, and 28th. Kittiwakes arrived in spring, at Isle of May, March 12th; only other record, in autumn, Sept. 22nd, at Isle of May (see Turdidæ); remained all August there, left end of month. Other species noted—Great Black-backed Gulls, flying S., Aug. 13th; large white Gulls, wheeling round Isle of May, Aug. 25th; Skuas (well described), Sept. 15th; and Oct. 19th and 29th, at Pentland Skerries, where they are \"very rare.\" Note:—Skuas, Pomatorhine Skuas frequented the Hebrides most of the summer; I (J. A. H. B.) saw several west of Lewes, and one near Island of Rum in end of June. Iceland Gull.—A flight in December. Earliest Dec. 1st, at Sumburgh Head; latest 28th, at same place; and on 25th, same place, two, accompanying Swans. Storm Petrels.—At Whalsey Skerries two records, March 29th and June 22nd, in foggy weather, flying about lights. Autumn: Only one record of Fork-tailed Petrel at Isle of May, Aug. 15th, which struck, and was killed and sent to me, of which I now have the skin. Two pairs Common Petrel bred at Auskerry.\n\nAlcidæ.—Razorbills. Spring: Whalsey Skerries and Isle of May, along with Guillemots. First arrivals at Isle of May, Feb. 25th. \"Invariably arrive at Isle of May, remain a day or two, and leave again.\" Second visit March 16th, at Isle of May; arrived on third visit to breed, April 15th, but at Whalsey Skerries not till 30th. N.B. Dates of arrival, and of preliminary visits from all rock bird stations in Scotland, much desired by committee. Autumn: All left Sumburgh Head on Aug. 6th; all left Whalsey Skerries on Aug. 15th. Unusually large rush, -15- flying S., passed Pentland Skerries on Nov. 12th; at this station they pass almost daily, but this is date of general stampede. Hundreds swimming round Isle of May on Dec. 15th, the latest noted record here this year; and Mr. Agnew considers their numbers at this late date quite unusual. Besides the 75 identified species, or thereby, I have innumerable records of species which cannot be recognised by description; and especially numerous are the records from Isle of May, Mr. Agnew being very desirous of learning more about them. He sent me numerous birds for identification; amongst those not sent or recognised, two birds, \"never before seen,\" resemble a Cuckoo in every respect, but smaller; others, called \"Redtails\" (? Redstarts), came in a flock on June 3rd, and stayed till July 2nd. A great many entries are simply \"small birds\" from Aug. 16th and 17th, and Sept. 14th to 30th. On Oct. 25th \"a few more pretty birds, with red breasts, forked tails, and two black stripes on head.\" On Oct. 27th, one \"pure white down belly and round back, black spot a little above tail, wings on top side a dun black, head and neck same, red legs, bill like a Starling, size of a Plover.\" Again on Nov. 2nd, two, \"the general colour that of a Lark, same size, three dark or black stripes down back, and one white feather each side of tail.\" It is worthy of remark that these unknown species struck most during easterly breezes (J. A. H. B.) I trust another season to be better prepared to have some of these identified. I have only mentioned them here to draw attention to the fact that probably rare things, like the Blue-throated Warbler (C Wolfi), may turn up. I might easily offer suggestions as to what these unnamed are, but I do not think any practical use would come by doing so.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nI have embodied all remarks on both coasts at the end of the Report on the West Coast of Scotland, to which I refer my readers.\n\n[Pg 16]\n\nEAST COAST OF ENGLAND.\n\nPrinted forms of enquiry and letters of instruction were sent to thirty-four lighthouses and light-vessels on the east coast of England, and two stations on the Channel Islands, thirty-six altogether against thirty-seven in 1880, and returns have been received from twenty-five.\n\nIndependent reports have also been sent in from Heligoland, Seaton Carew and Redcar, Flamborough, Spurn, North-east Lincolnshire, and Northrepps, making a total of thirty-two reporting stations against thirty-eight in 1880.\n\nMy best thanks are due to H. Gätke, T. H. Nelson, C. Donald Thompson, Matthew Bailey, William Eagle Clarke, H. Bendelack Hewetson, M.D., J. H. Gurney, jun., Colonel Russell, and G. P. Hope, for many interesting notes sent in, and for general kind co-operation and assistance in the enquiry.\n\nSpecial thanks is also given to the various observers on the lighthouses and light-vessels whose names are given in the Report; and it is to be regretted that no less than eleven stations, from causes unknown to the writer, have failed to make returns, more especially as some of these were amongst the best returning stations in 1880. It is much to be hoped that this year the returns will be more numerous and complete.\n\nThe east coast stations are as follows, those making returns being marked with a star (*):—\n\n† For nature of light, and position and description of station, see previous Reports.\n\nLongstone L.H.† *Inner Farne L.H.

May 2nd, some seen at Inner Farne L.H., with Blackbirds and one King Ouzel, E.N.E., mist and rain. In the autumn occurred at the majority of stations from Inner Farne L.H. to Hanois L.H., off Guernsey: earliest date Nov. 2nd, at Flamborough L.H., several round lanterns during night with Larks and Starlings; latest, Nov. 30th, Heligoland, passing all day with Fieldfares. Greatest number occurred between Oct. 18th and 23rd at Inner Farne L.H.,-18- Flamborough Head L.H., and Dudgeon L.V., wind E.S.E., S. Migration extended over about two months, line of flight generally E. to W.\n\nRedwing, Tardus iliacus, Linn.—First at Cromer L.H. on August 1st, 3 a.m., five killed; last at Inner Farne, Nov. 1st, all day with Thrushes. Great rush, Oct. 18th to 22nd. Migration extending over three months.\n\nFieldfare, Turdus pilaris, Linn.—First, Cromer L.H., Sept. 14th, 1 p.m., fog and rain, two killed; last, Heligoland, Nov. 30th, great many passing; also same date at Inner Farne L.H., two flocks to W.N.W. Oct. 19th, at Teesmouth, before daybreak, several were heard \"chuckling\" high overhead by fishermen going out to sea, flying S.W. to W., wind E., strong rain. The Fieldfare has been most exceptionally scarce on the English coast during the autumn and winter.\n\nWhite's Thrush, Turdus varius, Pall.—One early in January, 1882, at Waplington Manor, near Pocklington, Yorkshire. (Zool., 1882, p. 74.)\n\nBlackbird, Turdus merula, Linn.—Spring migration observed at Cromer on Jan. 29th (1881), 4 a.m., fog, two at lantern; and also, Feb. 5th, six at midnight, three killed. At Inner Farne L.H. they were seen in some numbers at 8 a.m., on May 22nd, with Thrushes. No Blackbirds crossed Heligoland in the autumn. On English east coast they were noted at several stations from Inner Farne L.H. on Oct. 2nd to the 28th at Hanois, several striking there at 10 p.m. A great rush at several stations from Oct. 21st to 25th inclusive, wind E.S.E., strong. During the first week in November large numbers were observed in North-east Lincolnshire, direction of flight E. to W. and S.W., and E.S.E. to N.W.\n\nRing Ouzel, Turdus torquatus, Linn.—Inner Farne L.H., one, May 2nd. In the autumn, at the same station, Oct. 3rd, one; and at several stations from Oct. 23rd to 25th, when there was a rush. None are recorded after this date, except one at Inner Farne on Nov. 30th. Migrate like the rest of the Turdinæ, both by day and night, and in the same direction.\n\nCommon Wheatear, Saxicola œnanthe (Linn.).—In spring of 1881, first at Hunstanton L.H., March 25th, several all day, and four days later at Inner Farne, 9 a.m., N.N.E. (four), snow, several; many, same station, first week in May. In the autumn, -19- first at 5th Buoy, Tees L.V., on Aug. 18th, great many, and subsequently, up to end of first week in September, large numbers at several stations observed passing along east coast southward. At Spurn, on Sept. 14th, passed in thousands, and still far from scarce on 17th. From Heligoland Mr. Gätke reports, under date Sept. 3rd:—\"Numbers of small birds at the lighthouse from 3 a.m., at which hour the weather moderated with a change from N.E. to E. by S.; all day multitudes of phœnicurus, trochilus, luctuosa, E. hortulana, A. arboreus and pratensis, S. œnanthe. Night, from 3rd to 4th, great numbers of above caught at lighthouse: among forty-nine œnanthe, but three old; amongst forty-seven phœnicurus, eleven old.\"—\"Mem. Trochilus turned up after midnight; phœnicurus and œnanthe, multitudes of young males, early in the night (later also); but the few old birds appeared later after midnight.\"—Spring migration, 1882, March 19th, Spurn, several seen.\n\nWhinchat, Pratincola rubetra (Linn.).—First week in September, many, with Wheatears in the North-east Lincolnshire marshes.\n\nStonechat, Pratincola rubicola (Linn.).—Great numbers at Whitby L.H. on April 3rd. In the autumn, first on Northumberland and Durham coast, Sept. 8th and 9th, and Spurn, Sept. 15th; last, at Inner Farne on Oct. 26th, E.S.E. (three), two seen.\n\nRedstart, Ruticilla phœnicurus (Linn.).—The migration of the Redstart seems so inseparably connected with that of the Wheatear that it is difficult to disconnect the two. On May 1st one killed at Hunstanton L.H., 11 p.m., S.W., o.m. In the autumn, in August, September and October, at many stations, the main body passing south in early part of September with the Wheatears. On the 4th they were observed in great numbers along the line of sandhills, near the entrance of the Humber, generally young of the year, only four old males being seen. At Heligoland, in August and first half of September, a great many passed, and on 17th immense numbers; on 10th with M. luctuosa. At Teesmouth (Redcar) a considerable flight came in on Sept. 22nd, during night or early morning, wind E., gales and very stormy; all were young birds, males and females; last observed at Inner Farne on Oct. 23rd, E.S.E. (seven). The latest immigrations were associated with Redbreasts.\n\n-20-\n\nWhite-spotted Blue-throat, Cyanecula leucocyana (Brehm.)—On Sept. 3rd an immature bird was shot by Mr. Power at Cley, Norfolk. Another, also immature, is recorded by Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown, in the Report from the east coast of Scotland, captured at the Isle of May lighthouse on the night of Sept. 22nd.\n\nRedbreast, Erithacus rubecula (Linn.).—March 5th, daybreak, at Whitby L.H., many Redbreasts. The first occurrence in the autumn, September 5th, at the 5th Buoy, Tees L.V., when one came on board. At the Leman and Ower L.V. large numbers passed to W. with Wrens on Sept. 22nd. Same date, and to the 25th, many at the Inner Farne L.H. Whitby on 20th. Also occurring at several stations through October in considerable numbers, as far south as the Inner Dowsing L.V. Very large numbers at Spurn, from October 2nd to 8th; on the 3rd so worn out with a N.E. gale they might be caught by hand. Some crossed Heligoland on Oct. 24th. Migration extending over two months.\n\nWhitethroat, Sylvia rufa (Bodd.); Lesser Whitethroat, S. curruca (Linn.); Blackcap, S. atricapilla (Linn.); Garden Warbler, S. salicaria (Linn.).—One common Whitethroat killed, Cromer L.H., Feb. 21st, 1881, N.E. (4), o.m. Spurn, Sept. 3rd, Warblers of all kinds abounded. Greater and Lesser Whitethroats, Blackcaps, and Garden Warblers:—At Teesmouth (Redcar), Sept. 22nd, several, E. gale and rain. Spurn, one male Blackcap on Oct. 8th. Some Whitethroats passed Heligoland on Oct. 24th. On the English coast the migration of the Sylvianæ is carried on during August and September; the main body passing south with great regularity in the first week in the latter month.\n\nGoldcrested Wren, Regulus cristatus, Koch.—Spring migration on March 19th. Cromer L.H., two killed against lanterns, 3 a.m., W. (four), b.c.m.; and at Hunstanton, April 14th, 2 a.m., one, with a Flycatcher, killed. In the autumn Goldcrests first observed at Hanois L.H., Sept. 1st, midnight, o.m., along with Whitethroats; several killed. Subsequently throughout October, both by day and night, at stations from the Inner Farne L.H. to the Tongue L.V., off the Thames. A great many Goldcrests crossed Heligoland from Oct. 18th to 24th, E., clear, fine, but fresh. The arrival of Goldcrests at Spurn as early as Sept. 5th, -21- associated as usual with Woodcocks and Short-eared Owls (three widely separated species, which are, however, inseparably connected in their migrations), is remarkable, as being one month in advance of their average time. On the Suffolk coast, in great numbers from Oct. 12th to 17th.\n\nWillow Wren, Phylloscopus trochilus (Linn.).—At Spurn, last week in August, immense numbers of Willow Wrens passed on migration along sandhills.\n\nLong-tailed Titmouse, Acredula caudata (Linn.).—Heligoland, Oct. 22nd, S.E. gale, some; Parus ater, Linn., a few; Parus borealis, De Selys, Nov. 10th, one seen, but not obtained.\n\nGreat Titmouse, Parus major, Linn.—Oct. 7th to 17th, many in N.E. Lincolnshire.\n\nBlue Titmouse, Parus cæruleus, Linn.—Inner Farne L.H., Oct. 20th, E.S.E. (five), many.\n\nCommon Creeper, Certhia familiaris, Linn.—Inner Farne, Oct. 5th, squally, one shot; was running rapidly up a stone wall near lighthouse at time.\n\nCommon Wren, Troglodytes parvulus, Koch.—At Cromer, night, April 9th, one killed against lantern. First at Flamborough in the autumn; July 17th, several round lantern all night, o.m.; the next notice is Aug. 12th. Shipwash L.V., from noon to 2 p.m., large numbers with Redbreasts to W.N.W. Aug, 21st, again at Flamborough, many round lantern all night. Spurn L.H., 10 p.m., three killed, in company with other small birds. Flamborough, Sept. 7th, again during the night, many with Wheatears around lantern. At the Leman and Ower L.V., Sept. 22nd, large numbers during day, with Redbreasts, to W. Last occurrence was Inner Farne L.H., Oct. 4th, many. Migration extending over eighty days.\n\nWagtails, Motacillidæ.—March 8th, at Whitby, many Pied Wagtails, 9 a.m. Oct. 20th, Hanois L.H., 9 p.m., E.S.E. (six), o.m., many, with Thrushes, striking glass.\n\nMeadow Pipit, Anthus pratensis (Linn.).—April 15th, at the Dudgeon L.V., one, with a common Sparrow, came on board, leaving again for W.

(7), o.m., at Hunstanton L.H., large flocks came in. At Spurn, Oct. 25, 26th and 27th, small flocks, female and immature. Heligoland, Oct. 18th, some. Immense numbers congregated in the marsh district of North-east Lincolnshire, late in October and early in November; females and young of the year, old males about one in a thousand. The aggregated flocks, numbering many thousands, frequenting the stubble fields for some weeks, where they, found an inexhaustible supply of food in the corn threshed out by the great gale in harvest time, on Aug. 22nd.\n\nSparrow, Passer domesticus (Linn.).—At the Outer Dowsing L.V., fifty-three miles S.S.E. of Spurn, on April 15th, ten common Sparrows on board, travelling from S.E. to W. In the autumn occurred at several stations from the East Godwin L.V., on Sept. 9th and 10th, to Corton L.V., Dec. 19th, none occurring at stations north of the Outer Dowsing; line of flight E. to W., or S.E. to N.W.

Out of twenty-four obtained during the last week in October twenty-two were males, either old or young. Examples shot, from the same flock showed great disparity both in the length and depth of the bill, indicating probably an immigration from widely separated districts in Scandinavia. These Redpoles were feeding on seeds of Scirpus maritimus and Daucus Carota, rejecting the husks. Very large numbers crossed Heligoland in October, and again on Nov. 30th, and almost daily in December to 20th. At the Inner Farne L.H., on Oct. 6th, many were noticed.\n\nLesser Redpole, Linota rufescens (Vieill.)—Oct. 26th, three at Inner Farne L.H.; and under date of Oct. 24th, Redcar, Mr. T. H.

Oct. 25th a large flock in an adjoining field. As the range of L. rufescens is confined to the British Isles these occurrences are probably referable to a closely-allied species, the Linota exilipes of Coues, the Common European Redpole, which, so far, has not been recognised as occurring in Great Britain.\n\nTwite, Linota flavirostris (Linn.)—Spurn, Oct. 25th to 27th, numerous; examples obtained had the rump rosy pink.\n\nCommon Bunting, Emberiza miliaria, Linn.—Spurn, Oct. 25th to 27th, large arrival.\n\nYellow Bunting, Emberiza citrinella, Linn.—Whitby L.H.,-25- March 8th, many, 9 a.m. Same station, Oct. 17th, great numbers at same hour.

Enormous and unusual flocks occurred from the Farne Islands to N.E. Lincolnshire, from Nov. 14th to end of the year. In the latter district, also near Redcar, many thousands together remaining for weeks on stubble-land feeding on shaken corn. At the South Tees L.V. the great rush was on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th Nov., and again 6th and 10th of Dec, flying S.W. At Inner Farne L.H., Dec. 4th, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., immense numbers to W. and W.N.W.; very few old birds observed.

Again, at these same light-vessels, on March 6th and 7th, great numbers occurred during night. In the autumn Sky Larks occurred at all stations from the Inner Farne to Hanois. -26- Earliest, Sept. 12th, Lynn Well L.V.; latest, Galloper L.V., July 8th, 1882. Great rush Sept. 20th, and again Oct. 17th, 18th, 19th, being then continuous all day at many stations between Flamborough and Nore L.V., less each day to 25th; frequently associated with Starlings. At the most northerly stations the direction of flight was south, from Spurn to the English Channel E. to W. or S.E. to N.W. Many occurred round the lantern of the Galloper L.V. on night of July 4th and 8th (seventy caught alive on latter night); line of flight to S.W.\n\nShore Lark, Otocorys alpestris (Linn.).—Oct. 17th to 26th, great many almost daily, and Nov. 8th and 9th (see Snow Bunting). The only occurrence on the English coast is Oct. 26th, Yarmouth, two on North Denes.\n\nStarling, Sturnus vulgaris, Linn.—Spring migration in 1881 observed at Dudgeon L.V. and Cromer L.H. from Feb. 25th to April 14th. In the autumn at nearly all our mid and south-east stations from August 30th to Dec. 11th. Heligoland, great rush Oct. 18th and 19th. On the English coast, during last fortnight in month, both night and day; often associated with other migrants. Line of migration to W., S.W., N.W., W.N.W. At Teesmouth (Redcar), on Nov. 4th, an immense flock, estimated to contain a million, \"making a noise like thunder and darkening the air,\" came from E. at 7 a.m.; S.W. light, rainy to fair. Mr. John Odgers (Whitby L.H.) writes:—\"We have had immense numbers of Starlings nesting in the cliffs up to this year; none, however, nested in 1881.\"\n\nDaw, Corvus monedula, Linn.—Oct. 25th to Nov. 14th, occasionally with rooks at east-central stations.\n\nHooded Crow, Corvus cornix, Linn.—In the spring of 1881, at the Outer Dowsing on March 28th, 11 a.m., about one hundred from W.N.W. to S.E.; and at the Dudgeon L.V., on April 8th, 7 a.m., about sixty to east. Twenty were seen at Spurn on June 26th, at 3 p.m., S.S.E., clear. In the autumn are recorded at nearly all our stations from the Inner Farne to the Godwin's. First at Teesmouth, Sept. 23rd, fourteen; Sept. 30th, Suffolk coast, and for some days after. Last at South Sand Head L.V. (Godwin), Dec. 12th. The great flight crossed Heligoland on the 17th and 18th of October, E. clear, fine but fresh. Mr. Gätke remarks this migration \"differed very markedly from usual habits in passing overhead, E. to W., at least twice as high as usual; -27- further, by continuing passing on late in the afternoon, which accounts for your arrivals 'during night or early morn,' which, however, I do not think has been later than soon after nightfall. As a general rule C. cornix, coming here later than 2 p.m., do not proceed on their migration, but remain on cliffs and island all night.\" There was a great arrival also on the English coast on the nights or early morning of Oct. 18th and 19th, at north, middle and south-east stations. There was again a considerable flight across Heligoland on Nov. 8th and 9th, and again Dec. 10th and 11th.

Hunstanton L.H., flocks S.W. at ebb, and E. at flood, throughout August.\n\nRed-necked Phalarope, Phalaropus hyperboreus (Linn.).—One near Grimsby, Sept. 26th; one Spurn and one Withernsea, Oct. 9th; two on Suffolk coast, same month ('Field,' Oct. 29th, 1881).\n\n-33-\n\nGrey Phalarope, Phalaropus fulicarias, Linn.—Teesmouth (Redcar), Oct. 15th, two, in adult plumage, only a few grey feathers on back, N.N.W. gale; one seen near Redcar same day.\n\nWoodcock, Scolopax rusticula, Linn.—May 24th, Outer Dowsing L.V., one, 10.30 a.m., E.S.E. (4), passing from W. by N. to E.S.E. At numerous stations in the autumn [principally in the north and mid-east], from Inner Farne L.H. to East Godwin L.V. First at Spurn, on Sept. 4th; last at Heligoland, Nov. 30th, \"a few Woodcocks and Snipe\" (first and only occurrence there in 1881). Greatest flight on English coast night of Oct. 28th, N.E., snow and sleet. Woodcocks have dropped in very irregularly throughout the autumn, by two's and three's during October, and not in those great rushes which usually characterise their immigration. Migrate generally during the night; frequent exceptions to this rule. Casualties against the lanterns of lighthouses and light-vessels from midnight till daybreak.\n\nDouble Snipe, Gallinago major (Gmel.).—One, Sept. 15th, was shot in a clover field about fifteen miles from Redcar. One, Sept. 4th, at Spurn, killed against the telegraph-wire; another, same locality, 16th; one, Seaton Carew, Durham, 27th same month.\n\nCommon Snipe, Gallinago cælestis (Frenzel).—Some few last week in July, main body last week of October to first week in November, rapidly passing on. Nov. 23rd, Gull L.V., 10.30 a.m., about 100 to. W. Spring migration, 1882, second week in March.\n\nJack Snipe, Gallinago gallinula (Linn.).—The only occurrences recorded at Inner Farne L.H., from Sept. 23rd to Nov. 4th. Mouth of Deben, Suffolk, both this and the former are recorded from Sept. 30th to Oct. 1st, at full moon, with E. wind, in large quantities, continuing to arrive for some time; remarkable by its entire absence from its ordinary winter quarters.\n\nDunlin, Tringa alpina, Linn.—Spurn, May 25th, very large flocks, composed of birds some in summer plumage, others having no appearance of changing from ordinary winter garb. Enormous flocks were seen at some north-eastern stations in October. Great number at Teesmouth (Redcar), from Sept. 15th to Oct. 12th, all going W.N.W., towards the Tees.\n\nLittle Stint, Tringa minuta, Leisl.—In small flocks on Humber foreshores, from Sept. 2nd to as late as Oct. 8th. -34- Fresh arrivals easily recognisable by their extreme tameness. Comparatively plentiful on coasts of Holderness, Lincolnshire, and Norfolk during the same period.\n\nTemminck's Stint, Tringa Temmincki, Leisl.—One early in September, near Yarmouth; a few regularly occur at this season on the east coast, although rarely obtained, and probably also frequently overlooked.\n\nPigmy Curlew, Tringa subarquata (Güld.).—First at Spurn, July 21st, two in summer plumage. Flocks of young, thirty to fifty, numerous through September and October in the same districts as the Little Stint.\n\nKnot, Tringa canutus, Linn.—Spurn, June 7th, 6 p.m., \"Plover-Knot\" from N. to S. Some, birds of the previous year, and which do not acquire the summer dress, remain on the east coast during the summer. The first arrivals of young Knot occurred during the first week in August; great rush (young birds) first week in September, the old coming during the last week, in October. Mr. Winson, the captain of the Spurn life-boat, picked up a Knot on Nov. 7th, which was killed by flying against the telegraph-wire; this bird was in faded summer plumage, the upper parts nearly black, with edgings of buff on the margins of the feathers.\n\nRuff and Reeve, Machetes pugnax (Linn.).—On Sept. 3rd, two shot from a flock of nine on Cowpen Marsh, near Redcar, N.E., stormy. One Ruff and two Reeves were also obtained at Spurn early in September.\n\nSanderling, Calidris arenaria (Linn.).—May 25th, some at Spurn, young of previous year, and in immature plumage. Aug. 1st, flock of nine; and henceforward in large numbers during August and September, many remaining on the coast till end of the year, and into 1882. At Teesmouth (Redcar) they are reported scarcer this season than they have been for many years.\n\nCommon Sandpiper, Totanus hypoleucus (Linn.).—May 14th to 20th, North-east Lincolnshire, flocks passing along the coast northward, returning first week in September.\n\nGreen Sandpiper, Totanus ochropus (Linn.).—July 30th, returning.\n\nWood Sandpiper, Totanus glareola (Linn.).—Aug. 6th, one shot near Redcar; small flock seen.\n\n-35-\n\nCommon Redshank, Totanus calidris (Linn.).—Scarce near Teesmouth in the autumn. At Spurn, July 31st, many.\n\nSpotted Redshank, Totanus fuscus (Linn.).—Teesmouth, about Sept. 15th; one, a fully-matured bird, obtained.\n\nGreenshank, Totanus canescens (Gmel.).—Comparatively numerous in Humber district in September and October, more than have been seen for many years.\n\nBar-tailed Godwit, Limosa lapponica (Linn.).—Passed the Tees in considerable numbers first week in September. Very common in Humber district in September and October. At Redcar (Teesmouth), between July 4th and 7th, about thirty passed each morning to W. On Sept. 22nd, a slight \"rush\"; several large flocks with Knots, both in morning and afternoon, going W.; E. gale, stormy, with heavy rain.\n\nWhimbrel, Numenius phæopus (Linn.).—At Spurn, May 25th, three seen. Teesmouth (Redcar), July 4th to 7th, each day a few seen in morning, S.W., fine. Aug. 17th, continuous flocks with Curlews and Godwits from 6 to 9 a.m., and also the preceding night, W., calm; and at intervals to Sept. 23rd, all flying W. or N.W. Last occurrence Oct. 22nd. 5 Buoy Tees L.V., at 11 a.m., twenty to S.W.\n\nCurlew, Numenius arquata (Linn.).—On May 1st and 18th, at Inner Farne and Flamborough, round lanterns during night. At various localities in the autumn, from July 17th to end of September. Great rush, with Whimbrels and Godwits, on Aug. 17th.\n\nTerns, Sterninæ.—At the Farne Islands, in 1881, the Sandwich Terns returned on May 6th, the Arctic Terns on the 9th; they left again in a body, both old and young, on Aug. 21st. From Sept. 2nd to 5th, hundreds of both species revisited and settled upon their breeding grounds. After this, from Sept. 16th to the end of the month, two to three hundred Arctic Terns, both old and young, were observed daily fishing near island (Inner Farne L.H.), leaving again at night. Three Arctic Terns, two old and one young, were seen fishing off island on Oct. 27th, and on 29th a single young bird. A flock of about thirty Common Terns were to be seen in front of Redcar daily up to Oct. 14th, when the great storm evidently drove them south. Both at Redcar and Flamborough, throughout September, great numbers of Terns were noticed passing south. At Spurn, in -36- May, 1881, small parties of Black Terns were passing north, a few returning southward by the same route in August. The Lesser Terns returned to their nesting quarters at Spurn in the third week in May. At Coquet Island L.H., on the night of Aug. 22nd, fog. Terns with Curlews were all night beating about the lantern. In 1882, March 29th, Spurn, two Terns [sp. ?] seen passing north.\n\nGulls, Larinæ.—The Herring Gulls returned to their breeding stations at Whitby on Feb. 14th; they left the cliffs with their young on Aug. 26th. Lesser Black-backed Gulls were observed congregating at their nesting quarters, on the Farne Islands, on April 13th. At Flamborough, on July 4th, great numbers of Kittiwakes were passing to the south all day. Unusual numbers of Herring Gulls and Little Gulls (L. minutus, Pall.) were seen off Flamborough in September. At Spurn, on Oct. 26th, two Little Gulls were seen; and about the 22nd two immature Sabine's Gull, Xema Sabinii, procured on the Norfolk coast, some Little Gulls being seen at the same time. At Teesmouth (Redcar), on Sept. 22nd, continuous flocks of Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gulls, young birds, passed from daylight to dusk, all going N.W., strong E. gale, rain. On Oct. 23rd, and for several days previous. Great Black-backed Gulls had been passing to N.W., forty to one hundred in the course of a day, E.S.E. winds, all mature birds. It is many years since so large a number of Great Black-backs had been seen passing. At the Cockle L.V., on Nov. 11th, continuous flocks of Gulls were passing westward all day; and on Dec. 29th, at Lynn Wells L.V., flocks all day from E. to W.\n\nSkuas, Stercorariinæ.—On July 12th, a flock of one hundred (probably S. crepidatus) passed at 8.30 p.m. to N.W., high over Redcar, wind W. On Sept. 16th a great many Skuas were seen on the fishing grounds, five to six miles out, Richardson's, Pomatorhine, and Buffon's busily engaged chasing the Gulls and Terns; and again on Sept. 29th, a great many Richardson's, Pomatorhine, and a few Buffon's Skuas seen from four to twelve miles at sea by fishermen similarly employed. On Oct. 14th, during the gale from N.N.W., great numbers of Pomatorhine came down from north, passing Redcar and going off inland, mostly flying high. The same day a large mixed flock of Pomatorhine and Buffon's Skua was seen near the Breakwater, -37- crouching on the ground to get shelter from the tempest of wind and rain. Great numbers of Skuas passed Flamborough in September; on Oct. 4th, four Richardson's Skuas were seen off Yarmouth; and on Nov. 23rd, at Southsand Head L.V., great numbers (\"Bonxie's and chasers\") with Gannets.\n\nPetrels, Procellariidæ.—During the gale on Oct. 14th, several Storm Petrels seen coming past Redcar from the north; they also occurred from Aug. 10th to Nov. 20th at several stations, not unfrequently striking the lanterns of lighthouses and light-vessels on clear as well as on foggy nights. The Fork-tailed Petrel (P. leucorrhoa) occurred at various stations, both on the coast and inland, between Oct. 24th and Nov. 28th, one at Heligoland, in December, being only the second obtained during Mr. Gätke's long residence in the island. It is probable that this, being a west coast species, is driven in the autumn by heavy gales right across the island on to our east coast—that is, from N.W. to S.E.; its rarity at Heligoland in the autumn supports this view of the line taken by stragglers occurring inland, and on our east coast after heavy N. and S.W. gales. Puffinus anglorum and P. major passed Flamborough, in September, in considerable numbers.\n\nAlcidæ.—At Flamborough, on April 28th, great numbers of Guillemots arrived during the day; and on the 29th the Puffins returned for the season. At the Farne Islands a white Guillemot was seen in June and July. The Guillemots and Puffins left their breeding stations between Aug. 20th and 28th. At Whitby, on Aug. 17th and 21st, very large flocks of Guillemots were seen passing north.\n\nColymbidæ.—From Aug. 13th to Nov. 8th, at intervals, many Great Northern and Red-throated Divers seen off Redcar. At the Inner Farne L.H., from Oct. 5th to 17th, both species common; two of the former, shot Dec. 8th and 10th, off the Inner Farne Island, weighed 12 and 12½ pounds.\n\nPodicipitidæ.—At the Inner Farne L.H., in February, 1881, an unusual number of Grebes and small Divers were observed.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nThe results of the observations taken along the East Coast of England in the spring and autumn of 1881 have been satisfactory; it is true that, as already mentioned, the returns sent in -38- have been less than in the previous year, yet what has been lost in quantity has more than been made up in the quality of the work. The observers have become trained by experience, and have learnt not only how to observe, but what to observe.\n\nAs in previous years, the main line of migration has been a broad stream from E. to W. or from S.E. to N.W. this year, covering the whole of our east coast in comparatively equal proportions; the occurrences of migrants coming from northerly directions, or from points anything north of east, are few and far between, and in these cases are consequent on birds striking the coast in more northern latitudes and following it to the south. Thus, north of Flamborough, Larks pass up the coast from north to south; at Spurn and south of Spurn they come in directly from the sea. The closeness with which both migrants and immigrants follow the coast line has also been verified in a remarkable degree,—an observer taking up his position at a short distance from the coast would see or know nothing of migration, yet within half-a-mile or less there might be a constant stream of birds, hour by hour and day by day passing to the south.\n\nIn the spring birds also return on the same lines they travelled in the autumn, from W. and N.W. to E. and S.E. A reference to the spring notes in the report on each separate species observed will show this. Our spring immigrants also arrive from the sea, and are first seen on or near the coast, gradually moving inland. Migration has been earlier than in 1880, in many cases birds arriving considerably in advance of recent years; this has been notably the case with some of the Limicolæ, such as have the widest ranges and where nesting grounds are circumpolar—that is, confined to lands surrounding the North Pole. Also in the case of the Anatidæ, which arrived fully a month before their average period.\n\nIt may be said the general features of migration, having reference to lines of flight, time, height of travelling, favourable winds or otherwise, circumstances of greatest casualties at lanterns of lighthouses and light-vessels, are the same as set forth in previous reports; yet in 1881 we find several important variations from the normal phenomenon, consequent on the directions of the wind and general character of the season. From the commencement of August to the end of October the prevailing winds have been from northerly and easterly directions, blowing more or less -39- directly on to the coast, and therefore, as also shown in previous reports, unfavourable passage winds—for it may be laid down as an axiom that, with southerly or westerly winds, not amounting to gales, normal migration is the rule, but with winds in the opposite direction, the results are very opposite; such winds, more especially if strong, weary out the immigrants and compel them to drop on the first coast they make, often completely exhausted by the passage. The consequence has been that, on our east coast, with the prevailing winds, it has been a most favourable season for the observer; and generally the number of birds recorded is considerably in excess of any previous records.\n\nThe winter of 1881-82 has been remarkable for its high temperature, no such uniformly mild season having occurred for many years in England. The same has been the case over the whole of Northern Europe north of latitude 50° N. As might be expected, so exceptional a season has not been without its effect upon our immigrants. Fieldfares have crossed in very limited numbers, and have everywhere been remarkably scarce in localities along our east coast. Large numbers of birds which regularly arrive in the autumn, as the Greenfinch, Chaffinch, Tree Sparrow, Snow Bunting, and others, and which remain for a few days only and then pass on, have this winter continued for many weeks, and even months, resorting in immense flocks to the stubble-fields near the coast, where, with no severe weather to drive them away, they found an inexhaustible supply of food in the large quantity of grain dashed out in harvest-time by the great gale from S.W. to W. on August 26th. Snow Buntings have been considerably in excess of anything known for many years, the proportion of old birds not more than one in a hundred.\n\nAnother consequence of the mildness of the winter is the desultory fashion in which birds have migrated; there have been less of those great \"rushes,\" when for days together one species after another rush helter-skelter on to our coast. Migration has also been greatly prolonged, and the latest returns received show Rooks, Starlings, and Larks still crossing the North Sea in February. The last week in August and first in September Wheatears and Redstarts passed as usual up the coast from N. to S., the line of migration being confined to the chain of sandhills. Also during the first week of September, and again about the 20th, there was -40- an immense migration of the Sylviinæ in the same direction. Migration appears to have reached its climax on or about Sept. 22nd, an enormous number of various immigrants coming in from this time to the end of the month. Not the least remarkable was the influx of the larger raptorial birds crossing Heligoland on Sept. 22nd and two following days, and were about the same period seen along the entire range of our eastern coast. From this date to the end of October ten Ospreys were procured from localities contiguous to the east coast of England, between the Tyne and the Thames. Again, the third week of October there was another large immigration of birds of various species. On the night of Oct. 24th great numbers of Mealy Redpoles came in on the Holderness coast; the same flight was also traceable as far north as the Farne Islands; the Mealy Redpoles appear to have been accompanied or closely followed by a flight of Siskins. Hooded Crows came with their usual regularity, almost to a day; this autumn the great flight crossed Heligoland on the afternoon of Oct. 17th, and on the 18th. There was a corresponding arrival along the whole of our east coast on the night of 17th or early morning of 18th, and on the 19th.\n\nShort-eared Owls, Golden Crested Wrens, and Woodcocks arrive with great punctuality during the first fortnight in October, and are invariably associated in their migration—that is, coming at the same time; it is a curious fact that, in the last autumn, all three arrived in conjunction five weeks in advance of their average period; this perhaps may have been a local and coast movement from North Britain, and not across the North Sea.\n\nIn August and early in September, Knots, Grey Plovers, Sanderlings, Curlew Sandpipers, and Little Stints—all circumpolar in their nesting—had returned in large number, being unusually abundant and early in their movements up the coast.\n\nThe Anatidæ have been remarkably scarce in shore and within our river estuaries, and it has been an almost blank season for the wildfowl-shooter; yet we find, in the returns from some light-vessels, they have occurred in extraordinary numbers out at sea, the weather having never been sufficiently severe to drive them inland or near the coast.\n\nWith a dry hot summer in Northern Europe migration is -41- always earlier than in years of rain and low temperature, birds breeding sooner in the former, and the nestlings, like all other young things, with dry weather and sunshine, developing more rapidly.\n\nNothing is more remarkable in the phenomenon of migration than the punctuality with which certain species return in the autumn, one species regularly taking precedence of another; also in respect to the date of the arrival year after year. In the Limicolæ and Anatidæ the date of autumn migration varies—often considerably—from year to year. In some species, as the Wheatear, Redstart, Fieldfare, Redwing, Hooded Crow, Goldcrest and Woodcock, and others, we may almost predict to a day the time of their first appearance.\n\nThe period of the migratory flight in the autumn of any particular genus or species is most probably referable to two causes: the first one of temperature, affecting the time of nesting; the second is the period at which the young arrive at maturity, or rather that period when they throw off paternal control or are thrown off themselves. When able to act independently and procure food on their own account, they flock together and migrate in a body. We know that, with rare exceptions, the young of the year migrate some weeks in advance of the parent birds; thus we can readily conceive the whole of the large raptorial birds nesting about the same time over widely extending districts in Northern Europe; when the many young arrive at a self-dependent stage there would be a simultaneous movement, ending in a universal migratory rush. This period of self-dependence is arrived at much more quickly in some birds than in others, for species like the Knot, Grey Plover, Godwit, and Sanderling, nesting in very high latitudes, leave our shores the last in the spring of any of the migrants, and their young are amongst the first to return in autumn. The order of migration, more especially in connection with the shore birds, is the occurrence very early in autumn—July or August—of a few old birds in summer plumage, either barren or such perhaps as have been prevented nesting, then the young in large flocks, and some weeks subsequently old birds.\n\nThe season of 1881-82 will long be remembered by east coast ornithologists for the number of rare visitants which have appeared from time to time, driven to westward of their ordinary -42- migration lines by the prevailing winds from N. and N.E. to E. and S.E., generally strong and frequently increasing to a severe gale. The fact of ten Ospreys having been seen or procured has already been mentioned; there were two occurrences of Tengmalm's Owl; the Rustic Bunting at Spurn; Lapp Bunting at Tetney, on Lincolnshire coast; White-spotted Blue-throat at Cley, in Norfolk; Glossy Ibis, five occurrences; Sabine's Gull, two on Norfolk coast; Kentish Plover, Lincolnshire; Blue-winged Teal, Teesmouth; and numerous other occurrences of scarcely secondary interest. These, as well as the rarer occurrences in Heligoland, have been separately treated in the notes on each species observed.\n\n-43-\n\nWEST COAST OF SCOTLAND.\n\nSchedules, &c., were sent to thirty-eight stations, the same number as in 1880. We have received filled-in schedules from twenty-six stations, being same as last year.\n\nGenerally the returns are light, and the scarcity of birds is accounted for by the reporters, and borne out by comparison of statistics, by the prevalence of westerly gales and winds (see General Remarks). The schedules show the same careful work as in former years.\n\nThe dates upon which the various stations have sent us returns are shown in the following list of the stations by the positions of the asterisks preceding the consecutive numbers. Stations added have the dates preceding the names. As will be seen, the work done will compare favourably with the East Coast returns, and also with that of previous seasons.\n\nWest Coast of Scotland. 1879, '80, '81. * * * 81.

Spring: Only one record at Stornoway, where a pair arrived on March 3rd and stayed till 18th.—Autumn: Records at Kyleakin, Dhuheartach, Lismore, and Bahama L.V. Earliest Oct. 5th, at Lismore (a flock all night); latest on Dec. 13th, at Lismore also (mixed with Blackbirds), and a single bird on Jan. 16th at Bahama L.V. Participated to a -45- small extent in a rush of migrants generally Sept. 21st to 23rd, which appeared on both coasts of Scotland. Indications of a small rush Oct. 25th to 27th also. Other records scattered through September, October, November, and December. Blackbird. No spring records. Autumn: At Monach, Sound of Mull, Lismore, Skervuile, Turnberry, Mull of Galloway, Little Ross, Douglas Head. Earliest Sept. 21st, at Mull of Galloway (date of rush also on East Coast q.v.); latest Dec. 20th, at Turnberry (one struck). Rushes: None very apparent, but, taking dates of other species, appear to have mingled with them on September 21st to 23rd at Sound of Mull and Mull of Galloway (which is also date of general rush on the east coast). Also faint indications of rushes at Lismore on Oct. 5th, mingled with Thrushes; and on Dec. 13th to 19th at several stations, as Lismore, Skervuile, and Turnberry. A good many scattered records also at other dates and several stations. Exceptionally numerous were Song Thrushes and Missel Thrushes near Dumfries in October and November, whilst Redwings and Fieldfares were very seldom seen.\n\nSaxicolinæ.—Wheatear. Spring records only from Butt of Lewis, Rhuvaal, and Skerryvore; March 9th (a flock), April 1st (at Rhuvaal), and May 6th (at Skerryvore). Autumn: At Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, Lamlash, Turnberry, Corsewall. Earliest Aug. 14th at Skerryvore (two seen); latest Oct. 27th, when one seen along with Sparrows and Wrens in garden. Rushes on Aug. 7th at Skerryvore and Dhuheartach (150 at former and numbers at latter). Another appears also at Skerryvore on Sept. 7th during the night. Desultory migration going on between these dates and till Oct. 27th.\n\nSylviinæ.—Robin. Only one spring record, April 9th, at Skerryvore. Autumn: At Rhu Stoir,[1] Kyleakin, Isle Ornsay, Lismore, Skervuile, Lamlash, Corsewall, Portpatrick, Little Ross.
