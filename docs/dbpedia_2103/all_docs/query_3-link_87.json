        "text": "ABSTRACT THE TREATY OF HELGOLAND-ZANZIBAR: THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR THE ANGLO-GERMAN FRIENDSHIP? Author: Marshall A. Yokell, IV Degree: Master of Arts, University of Richmond, 2010 <strong>Thesis</strong> Director: Professor John D. Treadway In 1890, Germany and Great Britain concluded the Treaty of <strong>Helgoland</strong>-<strong>Zanzibar</strong>, which settled many of their numerous and complex colonial issues in Africa. The territorial exchange of British-held <strong>Helgoland</strong> and German-held <strong>Zanzibar</strong>, which was part of this agreement, had a major impact in its finalization. Indeed, without the <strong>Helgoland</strong>- <strong>Zanzibar</strong> swap, such a treaty most likely would never have occurred. Many hoped that the <strong>Helgoland</strong>-<strong>Zanzibar</strong> agreement would usher in a new era in Anglo-German friendship and, perhaps, lead to a formal alliance. Hence, during the 1880s, the seemingly unrelated questing of a North Sea island and imperialist jostling in East Africa played a significant role in Anglo-German relations. This thesis explores the reactions to the treaty before, during and after its negotiations and examines why an Anglo-Germany alliance never emerged following the treatyâ€™s conclusion and what impact the settlement had upon the events leading to the outbreak of World War I."
