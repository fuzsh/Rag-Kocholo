        "text": "‘Gardening’ Euphemism for ‘Mine Laying’\n\nAdolf’s Minenkrieg was being Waged against him by Britain’s RAF, Fleet Air Arm, & Navy with a ferocity that bodes no good for the not-too-plentiful German Shipping. Since the beginning of the War, RAF Minelayers have flown more than 3M-miles on Missions which have carried them from Norway to the Mediterranean. By laying the long, Torpedo-resembling Mines on the Surface or dropping them by Parachute, the Crews of the big Halifax’s Lancasters, Sunderlands & Stirlings are making the Seas surrounding the Axis alive with monsters more deadly than any of those which early Mariners were supposed to have dreamt of. – Here be Mines!\n\nMinelaying is dangerous & articulate work but, in spite of this, it is Monotonous to the Aircrews. The specific Spots where the Mines are to be Sown are decided upon by the Admiralty from their detailed knowledge of the Sea Routes & Shipping Practices used by the Enemy. It is the RAF‘s Job to find these Spots – in the dark & without the Landmarks which are usually available to Bomber Crews – through the most precise Navigation & Clever Flying. For the most part, the Flying is at Low Altitude and the Pilot does his best to remain in Concealment. Nazi Spotters at Sea and on the Shore remain constantly on the alert and warn their Minesweepers of danger areas; even if the RAF Planes escape the anti-Aircraft Fire or any Enemy Fighters, the Mines they took such pains in laying may be neutralised. The Mine Laying Aircrew’s Job is monotonous because there is no “Action relief” such as results from a Bombing Raid or a Strafing Sortie. When the Bomber Crews set out toward their objective, even though they often have to Battle their way in through Interceptors & anti-Aircraft Guns, there results a certain amount of Psychological satisfaction from seeing the Bombs hit the Target, seeing the Enemy’s Works going up in smoke & from watching the frantic attempts of the anti-Aircraft Guns & Fighters to confuse them & drive them away. But the Minelayer, after going through the ticklish Business of finding the exact Spot, plants his Mine & watches it disappear into the dark waters. There is no Explosion, no Damage to the Enemy – yet – and he cannot know for certain whether his Mine will serve its purpose.\n\nOne of the principal purposes of the Air Offensive against Germany & the Occupied Countries is to disrupt the already overtaxed Axis Communications. The Bombing of Rail Centres has already driven much Traffic into Coastwise Sea-lanes. When these Coast Routes are Mined constantly, much delay & dislocation of the Nazi Traffic results. Furthermore, Shipping is Forced further out to sea where it becomes vulnerable to Royal Navy Raiders & Aircraft. The great advantage in employing big RAF Heavy Bombers for this work is that these Aircraft are capable of carrying a large number of the Mines over a great distance in a short time. A Lancaster could make 5-Round Trips to the Kiel Canal area, for example, in the time that it would take the fastest Surface Layer carrying the same number of Mines to get 75% of the way there. Furthermore, a Plane can get in all sorts of places a Vessel cannot. This, then, is the story behind one of those terse Admiralty Communique’s which usually reads: “Last Night Aircraft of the Bomber Command Laid Mines in Enemy Waters.”\n\nArea 1. The Western Baltic.\n\nArea 2. The Kattegat, Kiel, the Sound & Belts.\n\nArea 3. The South Coast of Norway.\n\nArea 4. The North Sea; Danish, German & Netherlands Coasts.\n\nArea 5. The Belgian & Northern French Coasts.\n\nArea 6. The French Biscay Coast.\n\nWithin these areas, specific Locations were identified & called ‘Gardens’ & for Security reasons, each was given the name of a Garden Product such as a Flower or a Fruit. The Mines were called ‘Vegetables’. Hence the common term in Bomber Command parlance for Mine Laying Operations of ‘Gardening’.\n\nBomber Command Codenamed all the Sea-Lanes using a popular Vegetable, therefore you have “Gardening” or the Sowing or Planting of Mines. The Admiralty decided the exact locations which demanded a high degree of Navigational Skills with little Topography to assist in the Ocean expanses. Each Target was given the delegated code name of a Vegetable etc.\n\n‘Veggies‘: Pumpkin, Asparagus, Quinces etc.\n\nThey moved on to Trees – Hawthorn,\n\nFlowers: Geraniums, Daffodils etc, then to\n\nMarine Creatures as code names: Oysters, Whelks etc.\n\nGerman Seaplanes laid the 1st Magnetic Mines in November 1939 off the East Coast of England & drop one on Tidal Mud Flats in the Thames Estuary. The British defused it & discover its Secrets, an important stride in Mining Warfare.\n\nA British laid Mine explodes off the Friesian Islands & sinks a German Vessel carrying Scientists who Specialised in Counter-mining Devices.\n\nMines Laid by Bomber Command Totalled 47,307\n\nMine-Laying: – Aircrews had guidelines to follow when assigned to a “Gardening” Operation, it was not a matter of Flying directly to the intended area at any Altitude or Speed the Pilot desired then releasing your Ordnance & turning around. There were other variables to deal with also; High or Low Tide, Depth of the Water, the Direction of Approach, and then you have the Enemy Defences to deal with. Once the Target was designated there was a Flightpath selected for the Group of Bombers participating in the Nights “Gardening” Operation. There would likely be Bombing Raids taking place on the same Night and an Aircrew with a couple of Mines did not want to get mixed in with a Squadron headed to an Overland Target.\n\nAircraft(s) from the Pathfinder Squadron would assist the Group of Bombers using “Gee” leading their Flight Route then dropping a Coloured Marker at a desirable visual Pinpoint of Land. Once the Navigator informed the Pilot the intended Target was nearing the Pilot would make alterations to his Altitude & Speed, ideally, the Aircraft Speed should be 180-mph & Altitude at 1500-ft. The Aircraft would now have to make a straight 12-mile Timed Run at this Altitude & Speed any faster than 200-mph & the Parachute could be Torn off. The Mines (usually 2 from a Halifax) are released between 3 & 5-sec Intervals (depending on the Type of Aircraft), their trajectory is curved; Gravity, Aircraft Speed, the Resistance of Air, the Nose fairing & Parachute were all factors in planting a Mine that will function. The Aircraft would continue in a straight line for another few mins to confuse the Enemy as to where the Mines were Jettisoned, completing the Drop a Crew would head for home; however, no Mining Mission was ever this straight forward.\n\nThe Minefields were often located in Enemy Channels, Harbours, Ports & Inland Waterways, all along the Atlantic Coast, the North Sea, & Baltic Sea. The Field was often narrow, ranging from 1,000-ft to a mile across if the Tide was out & the Mine was dropped out of the Zone there was a chance the Enemy could retrieve it for examination. Furthermore, Planting the Mine in an area not covered by a Minesweeper would be considered a waste.\n\nAircraft Mines were in short supply, in the event, a Crew did not lay the ‘Vegetable” then it was brought back to the Base & used again. Landing with Mines was not dangerous as the Safety measures prevented Detonation, even if the Aircraft Crashed. Crews were not to drop them outside Swept Channels in Enemy Territory as it could jeopardise friendly Naval Operations on the Enemy Coast. If a Crew had to drop a Mine due to unforeseen circumstances then it was to be in Deep Water & Charted. Flying at an altitude of approximately 1500-ft the biggest fear for the Crew was the Enemy Defences; besides permanent Emplacements, a variety of Flak Cannons could be on Mobile Barges on the Water or along the Coastline. Heavy Machine Guns or Rifle Fire could also bring down a Bomber. Along with Searchlights & the Luftwaffe Night-fighters, there was another threat, the Sperrbrecher.\n\nThe Sperrbrecher & Mine Sweeping: – The Sperrbrecher (combination Minesweeper plus Flak Cannons) were a Fleet of 50-Ships (100 including converted Merchant Ships – 5000-Tonnes or more) among 200-Mine Sweeping Vessels. These Ships had 20-mm or 37-mm Cannons positioned on High Platforms at Bow & Stern, others would have 105-mm Cannons or 88mm Flak Cannons, the RAF referred to these as “Heavy Flak Ships”. Escorting Ships or U-Boats in & out of Minefields the Sperrbrecher was equipped with a VES-System – an immense Magnetic Field Generator that would Transmit a powerful Magnetic Pulse in hopes of Detonating the Mine 500-yds ahead of it or reproduce Sound Waves with a form of a Mechanical Hammer or a Tuning Fork. In some circumstances it may only actuate the Mine according to the Preset then the following Ship could Detonate it, or worse the Sperrbrecher could be the Victim. Vulnerable to Aerial Attacks many Sperrbrechers would have Barrage Balloons attached. Roughly 50% of the Sperrbrechers would be Destroyed by Mining Operations.\n\nBomber Command’s Approach: Laying of Mines in Shipping Channels, to hinder or deny the Passage of Enemy Vessels, was 1st Practiced in the American War of Independence, but it was the Luftwaffe, which Pioneered the Technique of dropping Mines by Aircraft. This presented a serious threat because it rendered impotent Allied Defences designed only to Counter Mine-laying by Surface or Submarine means. Whilst the Navy grappled with the problem, the Air Ministry initiated Plans to introduce similar Tactics.\n\nGardening by Moonlight: It was not long before Bomber Command commenced Aerial Mine-laying Operations in Enemy Inshore Shipping Lanes. From the outset the whole Operation carried the code-word ‘Gardening‘ and each designated Dropping Area was given the name of a Specific Vegetable, Tree or Plant, thus introducing a System that once notified to Squadrons, required little, if any, subsequent amendment, needing only the addition of Timing & Routing details to be passed to the Squadron(s) detailed to mount the Attack. It was also the practice of Bomber Command to Rotate Gardening Ops around their Squadrons. Minefields were “Vegetable Gardens“.\n\nThe Frisian Islands were code-named “Nectarines“. An Operation type with the peaceful & domestic sounding name of “Gardening” still came with the same Threats & Menace the Operations over the Industrial Centres of Europe brought to the Bomber Crews. Terms such as “the Vegetables were planted in a Row”, ”in the allotted Garden Patch”, “sown 1–Vegetable” can all be found in Squadron Operational Accounts which actually were describing the precarious Duty of Mining the Harbours or narrow Passages used for Enemy Shipping in the Waters around the European Coasts. The Frisian Islands, off the Dutch Coast, was a frequent Sesignation for “Gardening” Operations.\n\n4th February 1945 – Heligoland Bight – Report 153-Squadron\n\nMines were being to be Laid to the South-east of the Island, covering the Elbe Estuary and the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal (aka the Kiel Canal). On the run-up to the Drop Zone, LM 752 (P4-S) suffered a ‘hang-up’ & Ian McGregor asked his Pilot, F/O Noel Crane if they could go round again. Although this involved a complete Circle of the Island, off they went & made a satisfactory Drop on the 2nd Attempt. They were obviously Spotted & were duly Attacked by an ME 410, which Shot away their Port Tailplane & narrowly missed the Rear Gunner. With some difficulty, they made it back to Base. Although the Crew survived unscathed, LM 752(P4-S) was out of Service for a month.\n\nThe Squadrons quickly found that certain aspects remained constant. Each Gardening Operation required the Squadron to provide 5-Aircraft – never more, never less – each carrying 6-Airborne Magnetic/Acoustic Mines; each Mine was 9-ft in length with a dia of 18-ins & weighed around 1,500-lb. (including an Explosive Charge of 740-lb). Take-off was usually around Dusk & return Journey times were about 6 to 6½-hrs duration. To avoid detection by Enemy Radar, the Outward Route was Base, Scarborough & (staying below 1,000-ft) out over the North Sea. With the 1-exception of Heligoland Bight, on reaching Longitude 58°N off the Southern Tip of Norway (a leg of 384-miles that took a little over 2-hrs Flying time), Aircraft then climbed toward a point in the Skagerrak, South of the Oslo Fjord & North of the Tip of Denmark, before reaching which, they had levelled-off at their pre-determined dropping height of 1,000-ft. Having verified their position they then set Course for their designated area in the Kattegat or further into the Baltic Sea. From this point, real problems arose. In the Kattegat, there are very few Deep-water Channels suited to larger Vessels, and these were well known to both Contestants. Knowing just where the Mines had to be dropped, enabled the Germans to Vector their Night-fighters to best effect. The Islands of Laesó & Anholt Housed Air Defence Controllers & Radar Stations. Neutral Sweden, with no need to operate a Black-out, lay to the East of the Bomber’s Route; German Fighters came up, hidden by the darkened background of occupied Denmark, to seek out the Bombers which were silhouetted against the Lights of Swedish Towns. Clearly, the advantages Lay with the Defenders.\n\nWhen turning South into the Kattegat, Crews had to switch on H2S (the Airborne Radar which showed an Image of the area being Overflown) presenting them with excellent Pictures of the Coastlines of Denmark & Sweden, thus assisting them to Fly an accurate Track past Laesó & Anholt to the Drop Zone & allowing Navigators to verify the Wind speed & Direction. Unfortunately, the H2S Emissions could be picked up by the Night-fighters, who would ‘home in‘ on the Transmitting Aircraft, whose only Defence was to throw out ‘Window‘ non-stop in the hope that it would confuse the Attackers’ Homing Devices. To reach the actual Dropping Zone, it was frequently necessary 1st to accurately determine the Aircraft’s position from an established Location & then to Fly directly to the Release Point, where the Bomb Doors were opened. Then followed what many Crews have subsequently described as the longest minute of their Lives – the release of Mine No.1, followed by a succession of 10-sec intervals before dropping numbers 2, 3, 4, 5 & 6. All this at a constant Speed, Height & Direction, thereby inviting Attack from the lurking Fighters. Mercifully there was no requirement to continue whilst the customary confirming Aerial Photograph of the Target was taken – the evidence was recorded by Photographing the H2S Readings.\n\nUnlike the Saturation Raids that were flown against German Cities, where the sheer weight of numbers provided a measure of protection, Gardening Drops were conducted by Individual Attacks – albeit conforming to an overall Design – so that Crews felt cruelly exposed to any Enemy Action. The German Defences were often augmented by the addition of Naval & other Gunships, which, with the ability to Fire predicted Flak at these individual Targets, proved to be very accurate. Given their mobility, they could be encountered almost anywhere along the Bomber’s Route. From the foregoing, it will be apparent that Gardening Operations were not welcomed by Aircrew, who stoically accepted that they were more hazardous than other Operations. Many however dreaded the fact that Flights were made almost entirely over Water, and invariably in total darkness. Should the Aircraft be Shot-down or seriously crippled, the chances of Survival were so negligible as to be non-existent. To carry out a successful ‘Ditching‘ at Night would require phenomenal luck for even the most highly-skilled Pilot, and the prospect of a subsequent Launching of the Dinghy in total darkness into a Hostile sea, heavily encumbered by the Full Flying Kit, did not bear thinking about. Overland, Crews could take their chances with a Parachute Jump, over Water, even if successful, this would result in certain death from Exposure. As with Sailors on Russian Convoy Duties, the survival time in Northern Waters during the Winter months was unlikely to exceed 2-mins. The Weather, Enemy Aircraft Patrols as well as anti-Aircraft Fire from both Land-based Units & Flak Ships were all placed in the areas to deter the Laying of Mines in Waters important for Enemy Ship’s to pass through. North Sea or Bay of Biscay Weather was always a Force to be dealt with. Although it could protect the Bombers from being easily sighted by Enemy Fighters, Icing & Storms could bring an Aircraft down just as any Enemy Fire could.\n\nDetonation: Once a Target Vessel has caused the closing of Internal Contacts, a fraction of a Second later the Mine has been transformed into an Incandescent Gas Bubble, resulting in a primary Pressure Wave/Pulse which travels at the Speed of Sound in all directions. If the Seabed on which the Mine was sitting is Hard Sand or Bedrock, then the Primary Pulse will be Reflected & Strike the Target simultaneously. The Pressure from this pulse/wave is Massive & constitutes the most Destructive factor in the Explosion, upon contacting the Ship it subjects the Hull to an extensive Shock, Buckling or Ripping apart Plates & damaging Internal Structures within the Vessel, ultimately its Goal to is Sink the Ship.\n\nAircraft Mines\n\nWhen we think of a Mine the Visualisation is the familiar Steel Ball with the Trigger Horns protruding from its Shell, bobbing in the Water or Submerged just below Sea Level tethered by a Cable attached to a Weight on the Sea-floor, awaiting detonation by a passing Vessel. The Aerial Mine dropped from a Bomber was considerably different in appearance, and purposely Sank to the Ocean Floor awaiting non-contact Magnetic Detonation.\n\nThe Aircraft Mine is Cylindrical shaped, approximately 17-ins in Dia & 9-ft Long including the Wood or Metal Fairing. The weight averaged 1,500-lbs. (680-kg) of which 750-lbs. (340-kg) of Explosive (Amatol or Minol). An anti-Detonation Device prevented Explosions of other Mines in close proximity to the Exploding Mine. A small Parachute attached at the end would facilitate Vertical entry into the Water, and the Nose Fairing would prevent Deflection during its Flight through the Air and would Disintegrate upon impact with the Water. Two Devices prevented the Accidental Arming of the Mine while in Transport; a Safety Fork prevents the closing of the Arming Switch while aboard the Aircraft, manual removal of the Fork was optional just prior to Jettisoning the Mine from the Aircraft. There was also a Safety Switch fitted with a Soluble Plug & Operated Hydro-statically which kept the Mine in a safe condition both before Laying & until a predetermined Period had elapsed once Submerged below 5-fathoms/30-ft of Water. The Main Circuits of the Mine are held open & the Detonator isolated from the Battery until the Closing of the Switch."
