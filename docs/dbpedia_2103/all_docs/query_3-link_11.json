        "text": "Volume 5. Wilhelmine Germany and the First World War, 1890-1918 Anglo-German Treaty [Heligoland-Zanzibar Treaty] (July 1, 1890)\n\nThis treaty temporarily settled colonial disputes between Germany and Great Britain. It recognized Tanganyika as a German colony; in return, the Germans abstained from further encroaching into British Kenya. The agreement ceded Heligoland, an island off the coast of Schleswig-Holstein in the North Sea, to Germany. Because the treaty appeared to abandon German colonial claims to much of east Africa, it unleashed a storm of nationalist protest at home.\n\nThe undersigned:\n\nChancellor and General of the Infantry von Caprivi,\n\nLegation Councilor at the Foreign Office Dr. Krauel,\n\nHer Britannic Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinaire and Plenipotentiary Sir Edward Baldwin Malet,\n\nChief of the African Department of Her Majesty's Foreign Office Sir Henry Percy,\n\nhave, on behalf of their respective governments, reached the following agreement after deliberating on various issues pertaining to the colonial interests of Germany and Great Britain:\n\n1. To the north by the line that commences on the northern bank of the mouth of the Umba River, runs directly to Lake Jipe and, after passing along the eastern shore and around the northern shore of that lake, crosses the Lumi River and bisects the territories of Taveta and Chaga. Skirting the northern slope of the Kilimanjaro range, this line continues to the point on the eastern shore of Lake Victoria Nyanza that is intersected by the 1st degree of south latitude. It crosses the lake on this parallel and follows it to the border of the Congo Free State, where it terminates. It is understood, though, that the German sphere of interest on the western side of the aforementioned lake does not include Mount Mfumbiro. Should it turn out that this mountain lies to the south of the aforementioned parallel of latitude, the line of demarcation shall be drawn so as to exclude the mountain from the German sphere of interest; but the line shall nonetheless terminate at the previously described point.\n\n2. To the south by the line that starts on the coast of the northern border of Mozambique Province and follows the course of the Rovuma River to the point where the Messinge flows into the Rovuma. From here the line runs westward on the parallel of latitude to the shore of Lake Nyasa. Turning north, it continues along the eastern, northern, and western shores of the lake until it reaches the northern bank of the mouth of the Songwe River. It then continues up that river to its intersection point with the 33rd degree of east longitude. The line continues along the river until its closest point with the border of the geographical Congo Basin as described in Article I of the Berlin Conference and marked on the map appended to its ninth protocol. From here the line runs directly to the previously described border, follows this to the point of intersection with the 32nd degree of east longitude, turns and continues directly to the meeting point of the northern and southern branches of the Kilambo River. It follows that river until it enters Lake Tanganyika.\n\nThe course of the planned border has been specified in accordance with the map of the Nyasa Tanganyika Plateau that was officially drawn up for the British government in 1889.\n\n3. To the west by the line that coincides with the border of the Congo Free State between the mouth of the Kilambo River and the 1st degree of south latitude.\n\nIn Southwest Africa, Great Britain's sphere of influence is demarcated thus:\n\n1. To the south by the aforementioned line running from the mouth of the Umba River to the point on the border of the Congo Free State intersected by the 1st degree of south latitude. It includes Mount Mfumbiro.\n\n2. To the north by the line that, beginning on the shore of the northern bank of the Juba River, runs along this bank and traces the border of the area reserved for Italian influence in Gallaland and Abyssinia. It extends to the Egyptian borders.\n\n3. To the west by the Congo Free State and by the western watershed of the Upper Nile Basin.\n\n1. To the south by the line that commences at the mouth of the Orange River and continues up its northern bank to its intersection point with the 20th degree of east longitude.\n\n2. To the east by the line that commences at the aforementioned point and follows the 20th degree of east longitude to its intersection point with the 22nd degree of south latitude. The line then traces this degree of latitude eastward to its intersection with the 21st degree of east longitude, follows this degree of longitude northward to its intersection with the 18th degree of south latitude, runs along this degree of latitude eastward to its intersection with the Chobe River. Here it descends the thalweg of the main channel until it meets the Zambezi, where it ends.\n\nIt is understood that under this arrangement Germany shall be granted free access from its protectorate to the Zambezi by means of a strip of land not less than twenty English miles wide at any point.\n\nGreat Britain's sphere of influence is bounded to the west and northwest by the previously described line and includes Lake Ngami.\n\nThe course of the planned border has been specified in general accordance with the map officially prepared for the British government in 1889.\n\nThe fixing of the southern border of the British territory of Walvis Bay shall be subject to arbitration unless both powers reach a border agreement within two years after the signing of this treaty. Both powers agree that, as long as the border issue is unresolved, not only passage but the transport of goods through the disputed territory shall be free for subjects of both powers. They also agree that their subjects shall be treated equally in every respect in this territory. No duty shall be levied on goods in transit and the territory shall be deemed neutral until such time as this issue is resolved.\n\n1. The border between the German protectorate of Togo and Great Britain’s Gold Coast Colony begins at the border mark determined by both powers’ commissioners during negotiations on July 14 and 28, 1869. It extends northward to the parallel circle at 6° 10„ north latitude. From there it traces this degree of latitude westward to the left bank of the Aka River and ascends along the thalweg to the parallel of latitude at 6° 20’ north latitude. It follows this degree of latitude westward to the right bank of the Dchawe or Shavoe River and runs along this bank to the parallel of latitude defined by the intersection of the Deine River and the Volta. It then traces this degree of latitude westward to the Volta. Here it ascends the left bank of the Volta to the neutral zone agreed upon in the Treaty of 1888 that starts at the junction of the Dakka River and the Volta.\n\nBoth parties agree upon conclusion of this treaty to withdraw all their civil servants and employees from the territory that is assigned to the other by the borders defined above.\n\n2. After it has been satisfactorily proven to both governments that no river exists on the Gulf of Guinea corresponding to the river that is marked on maps as the Rio del Rey and mentioned in the Treaty of 1885, a provisional borderline shall be adopted between the German territory of Cameroon and the adjoining British territory. This borderline shall start at the head of the Rio del Rey Creek and run directly to the point at roughly 9° 8’ of east longitude marked as “Rapids” on the British Admiralty map.\n\nBoth powers agree to apply the provisions of the first five articles of the General Act of the 1885 Berlin Conference in all areas of their territories located within the free trade zone described in this Act and to which its first five articles are applicable on the day of the conclusion of the present treaty. According to these provisions, trade is free; shipping is free on lakes, rivers, canals and their ports for both flags; unequal treatment as regards transport or coastal trade is prohibited; goods of either origin shall not be subject to taxes other than those raised to cover trade-related outlays, unequal treatment excluded. Transit duty may not be levied, and monopolies and privileged commercial treatment may not be granted.\n\nThe subjects of both powers have the right to settle freely in either power’s territories, provided that these are located in the free trade zone.\n\nIt is understood, in particular, that, in accordance with these provisions, the transport of goods by both sides shall not be subject to any obstacles or transit duties between Lake Nyasa and the Congo Free State, between Lake Nyasa and Lake Tanganyika, on Lake Tanganyika, and between this lake and the northern border of both spheres of influence."
