        "text": "victory!\n\nWhen I first arrived at Petroglyph I was assigned to work on \"End of Nations\". I worked primarily as a mid-level effect artist. My next assignment had me working on the development and execution of \"Victory\" a new gaming format called \"MOTA\". \"MOTA\" stands for Massive Online Tactical Area. The concept was to create a game that had an RTS structure, but then make it fast paced enough to compete with an arena style game like \"League of Legend\".\n\nIn this new position, I was given the leadership role of Art Lead. Part of my initial responsibility was to develop and write up an art doc. Along with the new responsibilities of being the Art Lead, which primarily included effects, I had additional responsibilities to serve as a concept artist, video producer, cameraman, editor, writer, and UI designer. My initial responsibility was to oversee and assist the team in a kickstarter campaign.\n\nThe video below is a game pitch trailer that the studio used as the main video on kickstarter. I edited and worked closely with members of the art staff to capture game footage that would grab the attention of viewers looking at our page. I also did a number of motion graphic work to transition scenes and introduce game units."
