        "text": "Tag: Petroglyph games\n\nThe strange flexibility of boundaries: population and other limits in strategy games\n\nWith curated experiences, even ones which give players a lot of control over the disposition of their forces, as in tabletop Warhammer or WarCraft 3, the game’s designers can spend copious time crafting a variety of tools (units, gear, spells, et cetera) that can act in a variety of surprising ways. We’ve seen the success of these curated game experiences in a variety of places, among them WarCraft 3.\n\nUniverse at War Commentary: Novus vs Hierarchy\n\nA hidden gem of the RTS genre, Universe at War came out in 2007/2008, developed by Petroglyph Games. It’s got a community dedicated to bringing the game back to life. I’m so thrilled to be a part of things that I wanted to cast a couple of matches! This is the second UAW match I’ve done commentary on, and my plan is to continue doing at least one a month from here on out.\n\nHistorical RTS: Universe at War Earth Assault\n\nNews: Grey Goo Gets Expansion, Price Reduction\n\nGrey Goo non-review"
