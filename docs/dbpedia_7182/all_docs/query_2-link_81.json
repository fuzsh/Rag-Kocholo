Now the developer has taken an unexpected turn towards mobile social games, to Coin a Phrase.\n\nCoin a Phrase is a pleasant little free social game in which players take turns (turn-based!) trying to solve a phrase before their friend or randomly chosen opponent. Players can draw cards or spent coins earned through winning to uncover hints to give them a leg up on the competition as they attempt to suss out song and movie titles, popular sayings, sports teams and a number of other categories available for in-app purchase.\n\nMaking a move into social mobile gaming is a smart choice for any developer given the state of today’s market. It’s just incredibly strange seeing a name like Petroglyph attached to this sort of experience. It’s like thinking you’re eating one thing and then discovering it’s something else entirely — not something bad, just not something you were expecting."
