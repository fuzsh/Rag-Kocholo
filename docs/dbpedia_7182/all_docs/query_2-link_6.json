        "text": "While I have no problem with a low-poly art direction for a game of this genre, I am not sold on the execution of the art direction here.\n\nThe object scale, level of detail and colour range are way too different from object to object. Almost as if there are no guidelines put in place to ensure that the the art is consistent (this is important, and is evidently missing or ignored in certain areas).\n\nEspecially the cliffs and trees are over-simplified compared to the buildings and constructions. The water texture looks very out of place as well. These inconsistencies gives a cheap impression.\n\nIt is very easy to immediately assume that it is easy or less effort to go with a \"simple\" aesthetic, when in fact it is very difficult to do simple well.\n\nThese things can be worked on, and I am sure the game would look a lot better if these issues are addressed.\n\nThe game looks fun nonetheless! Looking forward to see how this game comes along.\n\nEdited March 30, 2016 by Stevie_K\n\n<Warning: Opinionated rant of a game developer to follow - proceed with caution>\n\nIn a game that has a population cap, I will always first assume that it was implemented due to engine limitations. Supreme Commander, for instance, experiences enormous slow down issues when its pop cap is approached. I read somewhere that Supreme Commander (the first one) had a conflict with the PC harware that made slow down unavoidable when a certain number of units was reached, no matter how powerful of a computer was running it. Generally, the maximum pop cap allowed never needed to be reached unless you were trying to out-spam the AI. With a higher than necessary pop cap, and an engine limitation, Supreme Commander wins a pass in my eyes.\n\nI've only played Age of Empires once or possibly twice and never played Mythology, so I cannot comment on them. I have played WarCraft III and StarCraft II, and their pop caps were stupid. The maximum was ridiculously low in the beginning and you had to constantly be trying to increase it throughout the entire game. Since the caps were so low, I am fairly certain these mechanics were not due to engine limitations, and were probably for spam control. Spam control is never a good excuse for pop caps.\n\nIf you think these RTSs did it \"properly\" because you don't mind the pop cap, have you considered you make be looking at it from the wrong direction? Did you think it was acceptable when you first started playing the games, or did you just get used to the ball and chain around your ankle over time and allow yourself to submit to your bondage and develop Stockholm syndrome for your RTS oppressors?\n\nOr, perhaps you think these RTSs did them \"properly\" because they are successful franchises. But no game is perfect, and on a list of faults these games have, can you tell me their pop caps are absent? Although C&C is infamous for being unit spammy (since the later games have virtually no spam control whatsoever), is not the lack of a pop cap one of the pluses C&C has over its rivals?\n\nPop caps for spam control are lazy (or perhaps more likely; time-pressed) developers grasping an easy out for the somewhat difficult problem of spam control. If they can make the rest of the game's mechanics great or their storyline engrossing enough, fans will overlook the issue. But if you have a game with boring mechanics and a terrible storyline... like... ahem... Tiberian Twilight... the pop cap issue is not overlooked and considered yet another component in the game's ultimate failure.\n\n8-Bit Armies hasn't had the opportunity to prove its mechanics or storyline yet, but it also hasn't had the opportunity to demonstrate how its pop cap functions. So if nobody can say yet that they didn't do their pop cap \"properly\", why is it already being shot down? Because the majority already knows pop caps are stupid, people are just willing to overlook them if the rest of the game is good enough.\n\nI have played WarCraft III and StarCraft II, and their pop caps were stupid.

Spam control is never a good excuse for pop caps.\n\nI don't see how caps in general can spark that much of anger nowadays. It's unreal. C&C and very few other RTS games were uncapped, and the main tactic in most situations was to outspam your enemy, and late game battles could often be described as cluster****s (some Submarine Titans and Kane's Wrath memories are coming back...). With caps, you're kinda forced to make the most of your army, and luckily, most games that are capped actually have diverse and useful units that justify that, instead of \"Tank\", \"Tank +1 Armour +1 Attack\", \"AA Tank\", \"Paper Plane\" and \"Paper Plane with Carpet Bombs\", spammed to the nth power.\n\nIt seems to me that the main gameplay design is what decides whether units will have depth or will just be \"Tanks & Sidekicks\". C&C went the easy way, IMO, which allowed for nigh-complete expendability of basically every unit.\n\nAlso, I think the original StarCraft actually had a technical limitation on the number of sprites that could be drawn at the same time, and if the number was reached, missile-firing units like the Terran Valkyrie (from Brood War) would have their weapons unusable until something died to free the \"slots\". StarCraft II visibly took many things from both StarCraft I and WarCraft games as part of tradition, as players were used to that kind of gameplay, and would likely be aliened out if that was changed.\n\nIf you think these RTSs did it \"properly\" because you don't mind the pop cap, have you considered you make be looking at it from the wrong direction? Did you think it was acceptable when you first started playing the games, or did you just get used to the ball and chain around your ankle over time and allow yourself to submit to your bondage and develop Stockholm syndrome for your RTS oppressors?\n\nWhen playing AoE/WC/SC games, I didn't have any problems with the caps neither 15 years ago nor now, except slightly in WarCraft III where it was easy to reach 90 (RoC)/100 (TFT) in the Castle stage. I will admit that WC3 has it a bit low, while others give enough freedom, at least comparatively.\n\nOr, perhaps you think these RTSs did them \"properly\" because they are successful franchises.\n\nI'm not one of those people who like Blizzard titles because they're hyped (in fact, I despise the current gaming culture for doing the same to whichever new game is spawned nowadays). I like them for the same reason I do C&C - because I do. I've played lots of games in the past decade and a half, many of which were RTSes, and I can detect a mediocre or bad game. I've had experience with both types of gameplay, and I'm not uncomfortable with either (except, as I mentioned, WarCraft III, but I mostly play the campaign on it).\n\nAlthough C&C is infamous for being unit spammy (since the later games have virtually no spam control whatsoever), is not the lack of a pop cap one of the pluses C&C has over its rivals?\n\nYes and no. Battles get pretty intense in C&C, and I'm not against that at all. But, C&C's design almost completely ignores everything that isn't a planet-sized tank with an occasional bomber on the sides, which appears to be both the result and cause of uncapped tank rushes. It wasn't until RA3 that units got some more flavour and variety that other RTS games (WarCraft III, Company of Heroes...) had had for quite a while.\n\nPop caps for spam control are lazy (or perhaps more likely; time-pressed) developers grasping an easy out for the somewhat difficult problem of spam control.

Tiberian Twilight... the pop cap issue is not overlooked and considered yet another component in the game's ultimate failure.\n\nAFAIK, the caps were criminally low and unchangable in Tiberian Twilight. That's what was wrong with them most of all.\n\nTime pressure doesn't seem to have been the case with Ensemble, Relic and Blizzard, IIRC.\n\n8-Bit Armies hasn't had the opportunity to prove its mechanics or storyline yet, but it also hasn't had the opportunity to demonstrate how its pop cap functions.

Because the majority already knows pop caps are stupid, people are just willing to overlook them if the rest of the game is good enough.\n\nWe need to define the term \"majority\" here. I do not consider the common Facebook/YouTube Joe to belong in core communities and fandoms, as they're very fickle, naive and, more often than not, thick (I just happen to remember Blaze the Hedgehog from the screenshot on the previous page, the guy thinks as the wind blows). Also, there's a lot of people who hate on StarCraft and similar games just because they're popular, but have never played them, or have played them, but intentionally refused to like anything about them (happened to me with Heroes of Might and Magic IV until I started seeing some good points it had).\n\nI don't know how the hell Petroglyph even exists still, but they're (understandably) quite desperate now, and will resort to anything, even listening to literally anyone who claims to be a fan, just to get those bills paid."
