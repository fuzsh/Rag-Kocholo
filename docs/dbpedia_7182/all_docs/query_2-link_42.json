        "text": "The best Star Wars games give us the chance to step into a galaxy far, far away and get swept up in a myriad of different adventures. From getting behind the cockpit of a TIE fighter, to wielding a lightsaber and using the Force, there are over 100 video games out there that are set in the beloved universe that take place across the Star Wars timeline.\n\nMany are counted among some of the very best sci-fi games, too, with a host of memorable experiences to jump into. But this list brings together a selection of the very best Star Wars games out there, we're talking about the absolute must-plays. So if you're a fan of all things Star Wars and you're looking to try out some of the highlights we've seen over the years, we're here to help. And with other upcoming Star Wars games headed our way - including Ubisoft's open-world adventure Star Wars Outlaws, which is set to arrive this year among all of the exciting new games for 2024 - now's a great time to reflect back on what's come before.\n\nRead on below to find our pick of the best Star Wars games.\n\n10. Star Wars Squadrons\n\nDeveloper: Motive Studio\n\nReleased: 2020\n\nThere were three video games vying for this spot on the list. Star Wars: Tie Fighter, legendary 1994 space-flight combat sim; Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron 2, one of the best GameCube games; and Star Wars Squadrons, which is effectively a modern love letter to the pair of them. If you've ever wondered what it would be like to be in the middle of one of Star Wars' iconic space battles, manually piloting beautiful ships through deadly dogfights, then Squadrons is the game for you. It's exhilarating, exhausting, and utterly unforgettable. You don't need a VR headset or flight stick to enjoy this experience, but the pair will help create an unbreakable sense of immersion.\n\nRELATED: Star Wars: Squadrons review: \"Turns idle daydreams into tangible experiences\"\n\n9. Star Wars: Empire at War\n\nDeveloper: Petroglyph Games\n\nReleased: 2006\n\nStar Wars: Empire at War is special. There was this little window of time where legendary film franchises were investing heavily in the real-time strategy genre, and thank the Force that they did because it gave us Empire at War. Set between Revenge of the Sith and A New Hope, you're charged with leading vast armies into massive-scale battles – sitting above the action to dictate the movements of your favorite Star Wars factions. The ground-wars were certainly fun and full of spectacle, but it was the awe-inspiring space battles which helped establish Empire at War as one of the best RTS games of its time. The genre has come a long way since 2005, but there's still plenty of fun to be had with this classic.\n\n8. Star Wars: The Old Republic\n\nDeveloper: BioWare\n\nReleased: 2011\n\nStar Wars: The Old Republic is a true achievement. BioWare may have left Knights of the Old Republic behind to turn its attention to original IPs like Dragon Age, Jade Empire, and Mass Effect, but it never walked away from Star Wars entirely. In fact, this studio has been telling Star Wars stories for over a decade now, slowly expanding its own little corner of the universe with one of the best MMORPGs that you can play today. Sure, The Old Republic will always be fighting against the ghost of Star Wars Galaxies (you know, the original version) for some players out there, but the truth is that The Old Republic is one of the finest Star Wars roleplaying opportunities out there.\n\nRELATED: BioWare reflect on the art of telling online Star Wars stories for a decade\n\n7. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order\n\nDeveloper: Respawn Entertainment\n\nReleased: 2019\n\nWhen Respawn was founded in 2010, by much of the team responsible for making Call of Duty the behemoth that it is, the studio set its sights on redefining the FPS genre. That's why we were surprised to learn that Respawn was wading into a galaxy far, far away for a third-person action game which drew inspiration from action-RPGs and metroidvanias. We were even more surprised to discover just how fantastic Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was. This confident, and capable action game introduced the world to a new Star Wars hero, gave us plenty of space to explore lush alien worlds, and delivered the sort of tight lightsaber combat we had only ever dreamed of one day experiencing.\n\nRELATED: Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order review: \"Gets what makes the series special\"\n\n6. Star Wars Jedi Knight 2 – Jedi Outcast\n\nDeveloper: Raven Software\n\nReleased: 2002\n\nLong before Respawn's Star Wars Jedi games set a new standard for third-person action games in the Star Wars universe, it was Star Wars Jedi Knight 2 – Jedi Outcast which was considered the gold standard. Raven Software brought about the return of Kyle Katarn – protagonist of the incredible '90s FPS Star Wars: Dark Forces – and gave the former Jedi the opportunity to regain his connection with the Force, and with it, us the opportunity to experience what it would be like to singlehandedly take on the Empire. With its excellent single-player campaign and surprisingly tight multiplayer arenas, Jedi Outcast remains a truly wonderful adventure through the Star Wars universe.\n\n5. Star Wars: Republic Commando\n\nDeveloper: LucasArts\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nStar Wars: Republic Commando arrived at the height of Rainbow Six's popularity and quickly proved that Tom Clancy didn't have total command over the tactical-FPS space. Republic Commando put aside the eternal battle between Jedi and the Sith, instead putting you in control of an elite group of Clone Troopers who were charged with working behind enemy lines during the Clone Wars. With its awesome setpieces, flexible order system, and weighty gunplay, Republic Commando stands alone as one of the most unique Star Wars games ever made. An enhanced port of the game was released for PS4 and Switch in 2021 which makes it easier than ever to experience one of the best original Xbox games.\n\nRELATED: Star Wars: Republic Commando retrospective: How a prequel spin-off redeemed itself by rejecting all things Jedi\n\n4. Star Wars Battlefront 2\n\nDeveloper: Pandemic Studios\n\nReleased: 2005\n\nWhile we have a lot of love around here for DICE's modern revival of the Battlefront series, there's no beating the original games for the outrageous scale and pure carnage they were able to deliver. 2005's Star Wars Battlefront 2 works as well as it did, not only because it made you feel like a small cog in the much larger war machine, as you joined with either Resistance or Empire forces on some of Star Wars' most iconic battlegrounds, but because you always had the agency to turn the tide of a battle. With its massive-scale multiplayer skirmishes, beautiful visual design, and arcadey-action, Star Wars Battlefront 2 is iconic.\n\n3. Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga\n\nDeveloper: TT Games\n\nReleased: 2022\n\nTo put it simply enough: Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga is one of the best Lego games ever made. Traveller's Tales has spent almost two decades creating Lego games, and The Skywalker Saga was an opportunity for the studio to return to the film franchise that started it all. TT Games took that opportunity to build an incredible package, one which covers all nine films that make up The Skywalker Saga. There's plenty of the heart and humor that this series has become renowned for delivering of course, and an expanded set of combat and movement mechanics which transforms this experience into something that's as deep as it is open and entertaining for kids of all ages.\n\nRELATED: Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga review: \"At last, this is the droid you are looking for\"\n\n2. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor\n\nDeveloper: Respawn Entertainment\n\nReleased: 2023\n\nRespawn put down strong foundations with Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and built something truly magnificent atop them with this sequel. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor picks up five years after Cal Kestis' ascent to Jedi Knight, tracking his attempts to deepen his understanding of the Force and circumvent the forces of the Empire. With its twisting metroidvania design, stunning art direction and environmental design, excellent lightsaber combat, and surprisingly heartfelt narrative, Jedi: Survivor is proof that video games can have just as much impact on the Star Wars timeline as the movies and TV shows that have defined the shape of the franchise. Do yourself a favor, and take your time exploring what is undoubtedly one of the best games of 2023.\n\nRELATED: Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review: \"More ambitious, confident, and heartfelt than Fallen Order\"\n\n1. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic\n\nDeveloper: BioWare\n\nReleased: 2003\n\nStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic may be 20 years old, but it's still heralded as the Best Star Wars game to this day for good reason. Developer BioWare crafted an intricate RPG here, one where you are charged with defining your own path (and alignment with the Force) thousands of years before the formation of the Galactic Empire. Boasting one of the best video game stories, fantastic character building, and an expansive series of planets to explore, KOTOR is a definitive experience that is a must play for anyone who has dreamed of one day becoming a Jedi. A remake is reportedly in development, but the original is still an absolute must-play experience."
