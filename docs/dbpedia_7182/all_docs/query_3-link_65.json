        "text": "Disney is investing $1.5 billion into Epic Games, the creator of Fortnite, which was last valued at $32 billion in a 2022 raise. The companies plan to collaborate on new games utilizing Disney IP such as Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar as the House of Mouse evolves from cinematic to entertainment universes. Disney has experimented with games in the past, most notably with Disney Infinity, but executives never seemed to be “all in,” and the experiment fizzled. This partnership is a glass slipper (another Disney property…), allowing Disney to outsource the game development process itself to a highly capable team while offering Epic invaluable brand assets to build around. Either that, or Bob Igor just really doesn’t want to get sued for anticompetitive practices… #Disney #BobIgor #StarWars #Marvel #EpicGames\n\nOver the year, #gamers spent $98.7 billion on video games. 🎮In August, the top 10 #best-selling video games in the world (retail and digital) included: 1. #Madden NFL 24 2. #ArmoredCore VI: Fires of Rubicon 3. #Remnant II 4. #CallofDuty: Modern Warfare 2 (2022) 5. #HogwartsLegacy 6. #TheLegendofZelda: Tears of the Kingdom 7. #Diablo IV 8. #MLB: The Show 23 9. #Minecraft 10. #MarioKart 8 🪄By the way, Hogwarts Legacy was named the best-selling video game of the first quarter of 2023. Warner Bros. Entertainment. reported that at the time of the game's launch, its sales were 256% of planned. Thus, two weeks after the game's release, more than 12 million copies were sold, and global sales amounted to $850 million. The NPD Group published the rating, a company providing industry expertise and analytics, to reflect the situation in retail trade. We took the rest of the data from Worldometers and INSIDER GAMING.\n\nDisney buys a $1.5B stake in Epic games and will create its own universe in Fortnite 🎢 Disney and Epic Games are partnering in what it could be a game-changer for a new \"Disney Experience\". This is not the first time both companies have collaborated as we've seen others successful IP collaborations in Fortnite With the recent success in the past months from Disney that reported a 49% increase in profits, this comes as a investment for the future. This is a clear example of how you have to adapt the new audience and gaming is the right market to promote your brands and IPs. Going to Disney World is great but not everyone can do it and much less on a daily basis. Creating this universe will allow players to do that and will open a huge number of new possibilities for Disney to engage with their current audience and the new generations. With the raise of more games going to live services, IPs and Brands have the perfect opportunity to access to new markets, engage new audiences and increase their visibility. This is just another example of what the future will look like and how the new \"window display\" is gaming! What are your thoughts about this new project? #fortnite #gamingindustry #gamingnews #licensing\n\n𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗻𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗲𝘀 𝗱𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗼𝗻 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 $𝟭.𝟮𝗕 𝗘𝗣𝗜𝗖 𝗴𝗮𝗺𝗲𝘀 𝗽𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽. Following LEGO's successful $2B collaboration with Epic Games on Lego Fortnite, Disney has now announced a partnership with Epic Games, investing $1.2 billion. The investment will be Disney’s biggest endeavor into the gaming space, showing the huge potential they see in reaching Gen-Z and Gen-Alpha through the digital world. This collaboration aims to create an all-new gaming and entertainment universe within Fortnite, allowing players to ‘play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar’. Our Gaming Intelligence team has high hopes and expectations of this endeavor and only time will tell how much of a success this will be, and most importantly how it can be applicable to your brand. #marketing #gaming #fortnite #disney\n\nDisney is taking a bold leap into the gaming world with a whopping $1.5 billion investment in Epic Games, the creators of Fortnite. This strategic partnership will bring Disney's beloved brands into the gaming universe, targeting the ever-growing Gen Z and millennial demographics. With the massive popularity of Fortnite and its record-breaking collaborations, the potential of this venture is clear. Under CEO Bob Iger's leadership, Disney's focus on innovation and growth is evident, as seen in exclusive content like Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" concert film coming to Disney Plus. This partnership promises to be a transformative journey, and we can't wait to see what's in store! 🌟🎮 Link to the article: https://lnkd.in/eZWhyF4R #Disney #EpicGames #Fortnite #GamingIndustry #Innovation\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eFhknCGc Disney and Epic Games announced a new partnership yesterday, as Disney invested $1.5bn in Epic to take a minority shareholding. Epic founder Tim Sweeney said they will work together to \"build a persistent, open and interoperable ecosystem that will bring together the Disney and Fortnite communities.\" The move appears to make a huge amount of sense to both companies, with Disney trying to secure a foothold in the gaming space (6 years after the demise of Disney Infinity) and Epic looking to boost Fortnite's appeal even further. Whether Disney can make a meaningful impact on the gaming space beyond skin gimmicks and nostalgia-mining remains to be seen, but if there's one thing they have a track record in, it is building a universe. Disney x Fortnite has the potential to be a particularly potent partnership. #CMSGaming #cmslaw #epicgames #Disney\n\nDisney and Epic Games to Create Expansive and Open Games and Entertainment Universe Connected to Fortnite Why this is significant: 🎨Disney and Epic Games are collaborating to create a new open-world game universe that will incorporate characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and more. 🪄Players will be able to create their own stories and experiences within the game universe. 🚀Disney will invest $1.5 billion in Epic Games to support the development of the new game universe. 🔥This collaboration is a significant development in the gaming industry, as it brings together two of the world's most popular entertainment companies. 🚀The new game universe has the potential to be a major success, as it will appeal to fans of both Disney and Epic Games franchises. 👉 Source: https://lnkd.in/gRX_3yjT 👉 Follow me if you're also exploring how Generative AI is changing the way we create, design and tell stories in art, design, entertainment, and beyond: https://lnkd.in/dtRMyMHW\n\nIn December 2023, Warner Bros. Entertainment teamed up 🚀 with Zynga to promote the “Wonka” film in several mobile game titles 📱 The activation tapped into Words with Friends 2 - a word game with gameplay akin to Hasbro's Scrabble 🔠. Where a Wonka avatar challenged players to chocolate-themed 🍫 Friendly Faceoff word games. Yaron Leyvand, executive VP of mobile studios at Zynga, speaking on the integration in press release: “We’re always looking for new ways to bring engaging experiences to our players, and inviting our community to interact with one of the world’s most beloved characters is a perfect golden ticket holiday surprise,” In other words, the partnership introduced Wonka IP into the in-game space 🌌. Here's what all brands and marketers should know about gaming spaces 📑. #gamingmarketing #videogames #mobilegaming #entertainmentmarketing\n\n🐭 🏰 Disney’s “Epic” Games Investment 🕹 Last week, The Walt Disney Company announced it had bought a $1.5B stake in Epic Games, and that the two companies will develop a Disney universe within Fortnite. CEO Bob Iger says it’s Disney’s “biggest entry ever into the world of games.” Considering the $1.5B investment, he is technically correct – however, the Disney game business has existed for over 30 years. It’s a significant enough stake to consider Epic married to Disney, and it’s unlikely that a single Disney Fortnite game will be the last we see of this partnership. It’s also worth considering Epic’s role in challenging Apple and Google’s platform duopoly now that the fight is silently supported by Sony and Disney, both with their own mobile ambitions. It is exciting to see the games industry continuing to evolve, and we can only begin to imagine the variety of products and content that would come out of this partnership.
