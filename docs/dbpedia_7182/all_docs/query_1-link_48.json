        "text": "Toward the end of 2018, Funcom started a countdown that led to the announcement of a new experience set within the world of Conan. As the numbers reach their end, the live-action cinematic teaser for Conan Unconquered was revealed. Now, Funcom has officially debuted the first look at gameplay for this epic real-time strategy game.\n\nConan Unconquered is the first-ever RTS set in the world of Conan the Barbarian and its behind helmed by a studio filled with strategy game veterans. Petroglyph Games, the studio behind Conan Unconquered, has crafted a large collection of real-time strategy games, from Star Wars: Empire at Wat to 8-Bit Armies. In the video below, the team breaks down Conan Unconquered and how its \"not a traditional real-time strategy game,\" but a \"survival RTS.\"\n\nIn Conan Unconquered, you're going leading an army solo or with a friend as you fight against a wave of enemies that gets progressively more dangerous. The map is different with each playthrough and you'll be exploring to grab from a large pool of resources to build up your army and base. The multiplayer aspect seems unique for an RTS, not giving both players their own armies to manage, but allowing them to collectively build up one. With this in mind, each player can focus on gathering specific resources to work through different development trees so they can build up their army quickly and efficiently.\n\n“The whole team has been working really hard on Conan Unconquered and we cannot wait to finally let the press try it out,” said Petroglyph CEO Chuck Kroegel in the press release for the gameplay reveal."
