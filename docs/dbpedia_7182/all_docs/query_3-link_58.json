        "text": "Design-Driven Approach with Stylised or Photo-Realisitic Characters\n\n“We tend to produce design-based trailers, which often incorporate both motion graphics and 3D characters,” Jumbla’s Creative Director Callan Woolcock said.\n\nOne example comes from Emissary - a futuristic and intricate trailer that keeps the audience guessing about how the game’s narrative will play out.\n\n“Emissary combines aspects of technology with abstract visuals for a sci-fi kind of vibe,” Callan said. “It also features cool transitions and interesting camera movements.\n\n“It’s really well done and a great example of what we’re capable of as far as video game trailers are concerned.”\n\nOur work for the NASCAR expansion of Forza 6 Motorsport is another prime example. By interspersing highly-detailed 3D vehicles with free-flowing cameras and quick transitions, gamers feel they have no choice than to purchase the downloadable content.\n\n“There’s a lot graphic design elements in there, like when the cars and text appear against white space,” added Callan. “But it works perfectly and we’re really proud of this cinematic.”\n\nGame Trailer FAQs\n\nWhat are in game cinematics and game trailers?\n\nIn game cinematics are animated sequences within a video game that help tell the story or enhance the gameplay experience.
