        "text": "REDWOOD SHORES, Calif. – April 26, 2010 – Trion Worlds, Inc., the premier publisher and developer of connected video games, revealed details surrounding its first three massively multiplayer online (MMO) titles, as well as the company’s new name. The first three games being developed on the Trion platform are the fantasy MMORPG Rift: Planes of Telara, the massively multiplayer real-time strategy game End of Nations, and an action MMO game produced in conjunction with Syfy. Trion Worlds, formerly known as Trion World Network, is poised to revolutionize the connected games space by combining the best elements of online, gaming, and traditional media with its proprietary server-based dynamic-technology platform.\n\n“We have spent the last three years developing our platform and initial games and we are thrilled to showcase the teams’ hard work,” said Lars Buttler, chief executive officer of Trion Worlds. “Today, we are able to share with the world the first steps in our plans for expanding the premium connected games market. By creating high-quality immersive worlds, exploring new genres, and expanding our content into media beyond games, Trion is redefining the interactive entertainment industry in the connected era.”\n\nTrion made public new details surrounding its previously announced dynamic fantasy MMORPG, now known as Rift: Planes of Telara. The graphically stunning online game is set in a world being torn apart by dimensional “rifts” that tear into the land of Telara, releasing powerful forces that threaten the very existence of the entire universe. Rifts and other dynamic events can be triggered by players, scheduled by the development team, or even occur spontaneously. Dynamic events within the game can lead to a range of changes across the world, including everything from minor events to dramatic shifts in the game’s landscape and the opening of new areas. Players will connect with hundreds of thousands of other gamers to battle creatures overrunning the world, as well as each other. Rift: Planes of Telara is scheduled to launch on the PC in 2011.\n\nTrion has also pulled back the curtain on the world’s first premium massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS) game, End of Nations, which is being developed by Petroglyph Games, the creative minds behind the original Command and Conquer. End of Nations takes warfare to an unprecedented scale, bringing the real-time strategy genre into the online world of connected gaming. In End of Nations, players can choose to engage in solo combat or battle with -- and against -- thousands of other gamers across the gigantic battlefields that make up its persistent world. Gamers develop their own Commanders, build up their headquarters, and deploy a vast array of vehicles, weapons and technologies acquired through combat experience, crafting, and research. End of Nations will be bringing a new class of strategic warfare to PC gamers next year.\n\nThe company’s third and most groundbreaking title is currently under development at its San Diego studio, in conjunction with the premier television network Syfy. This action-focused MMO is based on a new intellectual property being developed by both companies, designed to reach a mass audience in a way never before possible. The franchise will debut as both a game and a television show simultaneously, with a shared universe of characters, alien races, organizations, environments, technologies, and more. In this revolutionary connected title, players' actions will influence the course of the show, and events occurring in the show will have consequences in the game. More news and information on this innovative, collaborative project will be coming from Trion and Syfy in the future.\n\nFor more information about Trion Worlds, please visit www.trionworlds.com\n\nFor additional information about Rift: Planes of Telara, please visit www.riftgame.com\n\nMore information regarding End of Nations is available at www.endofnations.com"
