Developed by the team best known for\n\nthe award winning Star Wars: Empire At War and Universe at War\n\nreal-time strategy games, Mytheon is Petroglyph's first online\n\nmicro-transaction game. Several members of this prestigious developer\n\nalso played a key role in creating the original Command and Conquer\n\nseries while at Westwood Studios. Mytheon will launch in Fall 2009.\n\nFor more information, and to register for news updates on the game,\n\nvisit www.Mytheongame.com.\n\nMytheon is an online micro transaction game that uniquely combines the\n\nbest elements of action, strategy and RPG game-play with a heavy\n\nemphasis on collectability and combat. This visually stunning title is\n\nset within a fantasy universe steeped in unique mythologies from\n\nacross the globe. Players will first embark on a rousing journey\n\nthrough the extensive lore of ancient Greece; with ongoing expansions\n\nto follow that will delve into exotic mythologies from the far-flung\n\ncorners of history. With real-time combat and extensive customization\n\nfeatures, Mytheon will offer infinite replayability through group, PVP\n\nand solo play as well as an integrated social networking feature set.\n\n\"There really isn't a game on the market today that someone could\n\ncompare to Mytheon,\" said Jeff Lujan, Founder and Chairman of True\n\nGames Interactive. \"The game truly creates an entirely new genre\n\noffering a combination of features that gamers would normally have to\n\nplay several different games to get. There is no doubt it is an\n\nambitious project, but Petroglyph has routinely delivered AAA quality,\n\ngenre-defining games and Mytheon continues that pedigree.\"\n\nIn the game, players will collect and customize a vast assortment of\n\n\"Power Stones\" which are used to conjure devastating spells and summon\n\nfaithful minions in climactic battles against monsters and other\n\nplayers. Mytheon will offer three distinct character classes, each\n\nspecializing in a specific \"Power Stone\" type, such as summoning or\n\nhealing.\n\n\"The passion and energy behind Mytheon has been tremendous at\n\nPetroglyph. This is exciting new territory for Petroglyph to explore\"\n\nsaid Chuck Kroegel, CEO and General Manager of Petroglyph. \"We are\n\nmaking a compelling and addictive new genre that will have you fully\n\nimmersed and entertained. We couldn't have asked for a better partner\n\nthan True Games to take this journey with us and I'm certain that\n\ntogether we'll deliver a long-lasting new franchise.\"\n\nFor additional details on Mytheon and for continuous updates on the\n\ngame, please visit: https://www.Mytheongame.com"
