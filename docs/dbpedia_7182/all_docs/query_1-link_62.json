I truly enjoyed working with him.”\n\n“I absolutely enjoy working with Jeff! He is an excellent game designer and has done terrific work for Petroglyph over the years. He's knowledgeable, responsible, friendly, hard-working, appreciated by his teammates, and very passionate about his work and games. Also, Jeff is also very self-motivated to learn new skills and apply them to game development. I highly recommend him, and will always welcome the opportunity to work with him again in the future!”"
