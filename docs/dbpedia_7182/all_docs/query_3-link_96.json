Now, hey, although financial success is not everything, I do find it definitely helps with a bit of motivation. So here are a few of those hit indie games made by a single person or a couple of people. This is a continuation of my previous list, so definitely check that out as well if you haven’t. Consider following me over at Twitter or Instagram and join our community Discord in the description below. This video is sponsored by Walling, but more on that in a bit.\n\nFirst up is Kenshi, developed in the beginning by Chris Hunt and Lo-Fi Games, and released in 2013. According to their website, Kenshi is atmospherically considered a sword-punk game featuring a wide mix of RPG, city building, and sandbox elements. Notably saying, “You are not the chosen one. You are not great and powerful. You don’t have more hit points than everyone else. You are not the center of the universe, and you are not special, unless you work for it.” According to an “Ask Me Anything” post made by Chris on Reddit around 2019, he spent roughly the first six years working on Kenshi alone, with his sister writing most of the dialogue, all while he was working part-time two days a week as a security guard. Eventually, Kenshi got Alpha funded, and Hunt was able to build out a small team and ultimately found Lo-Fi Games when they later fully released Kenshi. So far, Kenshi has sold over 1 million copies, with an estimated revenue of 32 million dollars.\n\nUp next is everyone’s favorite dystopian immigration simulator, Papers, Please, developed by Lucas Pope and released in 2013. You take on the job of an immigration officer in the fictional country of Arstotzka. You must review passports and other documents as your list of rules expands and different events occur. Papers, Please, received numerous game nominations and was even named one of the top video games of 2013 by Wired and The New Yorker. There was even a short film adaptation of the game. Early on, Lucas Pope was involved in the modding community, specifically for the game Quake. He eventually also had his own studio, worked for Realtime Associates, Naughty Dog, and worked on titles like Uncharted before working on Papers, Please. So far, Papers, Please, has sold over 1.8 million copies, with an estimated revenue of almost 10 million dollars.\n\nGeometry Dash is one of the most popular mobile games, solo developed by Robert “RobTop” Topala, first released on iOS and Android in 2013. Geometry Dash is a difficult, fast-paced, music-synced platformer featuring 21 pre-built levels and a very robust level creator. Topala originally got into game development while studying civil engineering in college, which he later dropped out of to found his own studio, RobTop Games, in 2012. Topala said that in the beginning, there was no real direction for the game, as it was just a cube that could crash and jump. But also said that he was inspired by Impossible Game. It remarkably only took Topala four months to develop and release Geometry Dash on the Android and iOS app stores. Geometry Dash has an estimated revenue of over 21 million dollars, not bad for initially only four months worth of development for a fan favorite.\n\nAnd now, media stream giant, Five Nights at Freddy’s, or FNAF, was originally developed by Scott Cawthon and released in 2014. Cawthon had previously worked on several games before Five Nights at Freddy’s, with a few of them facing pretty harsh critique. Funny enough, his game, Chipper and Sons Lumber Co., was criticized for having animatronic-like characters. Cawthon decided to lean into this negative view and create Five Nights at Freddy’s, featuring animatronics. As the player, you are a nighttime security guard at Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, and at night, the animatronics come alive and hunt the player throughout the restaurant. It’s your job to monitor them and survive. Because of the original Five Nights at Freddy’s success, the game expanded to include three more main games, many spin-off games, a graphic novel series, and even a movie with a similar theme called Willy’s Wonderland, featuring Nic Cage, released in 2021, though that was not an official FNAF movie. Because of how many games and spin-offs there are, it’s difficult to really put a number on how many copies the various games have sold. But the original Five Nights at Freddy’s sold over 1 million copies just on Steam alone, with an estimated revenue of about 3.1 million dollars. But also, Scott Cawthon has an approximate net worth of 70 million dollars from the entire Five Nights at Freddy’s franchise.\n\nbuy link: https://huzaifsofi.gumroad.com/l/ptkjh\n\nUp next is the game Bright Memory, solo developed by Zhang Jian Chang and initially released on Steam in 2019. Bright Memory is a supernatural-powered FPS where you play a Shelia on a mission from the science research organization to prevent a military group from acquiring a weapon that can basically reanimate the dead. Zhang released a prior game called War Storm and eventually took a position at CSUN Entertainment as a level designer before starting work on Bright Memory in his free time with Unreal Engine. He also eventually released an expansion game called Bright Memory: Infinite in 2021. Bright Memory Episode 1, or the first game, has an estimated revenue of over 4 million dollars, and Bright Memory: Infinite has an estimated revenue of over 12 million dollars.\n\nLastly, is the high-tech Metroidvania Axiom Verge, solo developed by Thomas Happ and originally released in 2015. You play as Trace, a scientist making their way through an ancient but oddly technological land. Thomas Happ was previously an engineer at Petroglyph Games that released some bangers like one of my personal favorite games, Star Wars: Empire at War. But Axiom Verge was one of Thomas Happ’s independent projects. Tom later worked on a new edition of the game called Axiom Verge: Multiverse Edition, which was released in 2017. He now has his own game studio, rightly called Thomas Happ Games. And according to game stats, Axiom Verge has an estimated revenue of 1.7 million dollars just on Steam.\n\nSo, that has been six more indie games developed by one or two people that hit astronomical success. Now again, focusing on the numbers and money isn’t always productive but can be somewhat inspirational to give you that little push to keep going. The games and indie developers featured in this video, I actually found mostly through the comments of my previous video. So if you know of any other really popular solo indie-developed games, please comment them down below, and maybe I’ll put together another part three of this “Millionaires of Solo Indie Game Development.” And if you want to try to get into game development, this video sponsor can help, Walling. I often find it hard to visualize all of the ideas I’m thinking about and how they interact and really what to prioritize. Walling is great for that because it’s an extremely visual tool to help organize all your ideas and projects, and everything can be on a single wall, so you don"
