Renegade was ultimately a market failure. While the title I don't believe lost them alot of money (if any) it didn't live up to the Halo/Half-Life expectations EA was trying to shell out for it or get close to it.\n\nWhat this means is if Westwood Studios wasn't owned by EA and released Renegade the way it come out (since this is the only reference we have at the moment) I would imagine that Red Alert 2 would have followed definitely. After that Tiberium Twilight (CnC3). At the time period of CnC3 (2007-08) the market for RTS games would have shifted and not been as profitable. Coupled with increased competition, the emergence of more profitable mobile games/Iphone, the Great Recession and the explosion of FPS Online Multiplayer at the time period this may have forced Westwood studios to have made Renegade 2. I also believe that at this point they would have been suffering funding and eventually be bought out due to the decrease in sales for RTS games.. this might lead Westwood to have made more experimental games (I.E. this is how we get to the possibility of Renegade 2).\n\nRenegade 2 story and concepts could have and be anything honestly. I know we have some pre production stuff above.. but when Renegade 1 was released there was never going to be a Renegade 2 immediately due to failing sales along with pressure for RA2. However, Renegade 2 being made in this timeline at or around 2009-2010 would most likely have included a closer focus on multiplayer (With Campaign style games starting to fall out of favor due to the popularity arising out of Call of Duty titles at this period and such.) The story would most likely have focused on a recent title or upcoming title to help boost sales in both categories (Such as RA3 or CNC3.. having a campaign returning to Red Alert universe, then releasing a red alert game would have helped players remember or get hyped about RA3. This same tactic was used by EA with the \"Tiberium\" FPS and CNC4)\n\nAssuming Westwood studios survived the great recession and managed to fend off giant corporations like EA/Blizzard/Activision from being bought out or killed out right.. I would say that the future of Westwood Studios 2014-2020 would have followed more and more into a focus on Pay per Play or Battle Royal/Freemuim games like Fortnight. It's the only way they could have survived.\n\nUltimately, the things we know Westwood Studios for in terms of quality like Deep stories, Campaigns, RTS Bangers, would have been snuffed out come 2015 at the latest. The market has instead turned to Mobile Phone gameplay, RTS games have all but died, nearly all games only come from massive corporations, the games today are either a FPS style type battle royal game (Fortnight) or a mobile game or an open world game such as Forza Horizon/GTA.. Games that Westwood never developed or had any experience (or could Renegade ever really fit into properly). Westwood Studios primarily made RTS games. That's what they're known for best. I believe Renegade 2 at this time period (2012 - 2016?) would have been a rushed mess to make up for sinking profits. If not, I believe Westwood to ensure the game was great quality would have hired more FPS developers/specialists to create a banger. Who knows, maybe after Renegade 2 Westwood would start to focus on FPS's instead of the failing RTS market..\n\nI don't believe Westwood Studios would have survived at all today and if so they would be vastly different, compromising what they're known for in terms of quality. Their peak years of 1990-2005 (Basically their existence) were the years where Gameplay was considered a story, the environment expected quality long gameplay, and games were played on PC primarily (90's). Everything that isn't today.\n\n8 hours ago, buttnutella said:\n\nWhat you're basically saying is there would probably not have been much of a chance either way, huh?\n\nWith EA having purchased Westwood, yeah. Definitely not. I would even go as far to say Renegade was the product of EA trying out something to earn more profit. If there was a chance it would have to have been due to Westwood really trying to adapt to the market at the time frame or survive bankruptcy by adaptation. As a result the game would have been subpar unless they spent even more money in development or hiring other people. Which of course defeats the purpose of making Renegade 2.\n\nQuote\n\nThank you for breaking this down and explaining it to me in great detail. I had no idea about most of it. What a bumpy long ride that must have been for Westwood. Apparently they were through a lot more than I thought. I just assumed EA was being the profiteering devil as it usually was.\n\nAnytime! While it's always great to watch game companies past/future speculation, it's also very important to look at the economic factors surrounding the time period to help gain insight into why things occur or would have.\n\nEA at the end of the day is a corporation. They are alive now due to the actions they've taken in the past. While it's dishearting for players like us, when you can pump out shit and people will buy it in droves... it doesn't matter when you go home in your Mercedes and you're an executive. Why would you ever stop doing what makes you money in any business. This outlook directly conflicted Westwood when they were purchased by EA. Westwood took their time with games and made revolutionary fun things. Their importance and focus was \"We want to make fun games that we can't stop testing, playing and staying at work for\". EA in an attempt to gain more money cut costs and rushed out production so that they could make more money. Westwood did the best with what they could untill 2005 when most if not all quit and went to work at Petroglyph Games. To give you an idea of how much Westwood cares about their games and players.. they restored the internet to a 14 year old game so people can play multiplayer again for free.\n\nQuote\n\nI only wish Westwood was always able to stand on their own. Such a unique company with unique visions. It's basically unheard of to play an RTS game as an FPS/3PS but they made that a possibility.\n\nIt's just not profitable enough. Even if Westwood stood on their own and made it through they would have to create something other than RTS games. What we knew westwood studios for is a product of their time unfortunately in my belief. Although I saw a trailer earlier on our discord I believe of Westwood making a Renegade Clone.

Which of course defeats the purpose of making Renegade 2.\n\nFound a vid that's coincidentally right the alley of our conversation right now. You were 100% right about them rushing Ren out for profit. This vid even states earlier RTS titles were met with the same EA fate everyone came to expect from them in their pattern of similar behavior that followed suit well into their career obviously showcasing their greed.\n\nIn my own humble opinion, if Westwood was allowed to take their time on their projects like they always tried to do they would have truly turned EA some profits. I mean aren't the group of guys solely responsible for the RTS genre & it's roots? If they are able to do that then surely they are able to innovate within their own turf.\n\nIt's like EA just filled in the name & date on the test then turned it in knowing they would default to a quarter of the credits just for showing up for the test instead of finishing it to receive full credits like it's intended to really pass that class. There's no money in lingering behind the first 5 frets, yet that's where EA like's to make their living. I'm not alone in that either as so many people have regretted buying various EA games for literally the same exact reasons we are discussing right now.\n\n4 hours ago, Threve said:\n\nAnytime! While it's always great to watch game companies past/future speculation, it's also very important to look at the economic factors surrounding the time period to help gain insight into why things occur or would have.\n\nEspecially when you have some emotional/nostalgic attachment to a certain title or franchise then it's most definitely fun to learn the entire backstories on things that were missing to you growing up because I've always been one to just get in the server to have fun so I never really did any digging on things like this. Hell, I never even watched most game reveals on E3 or followed what companies were doing closely so I knew no plans of developments. Even if I did, I was still growing up then so I doubt I would have been able to wrap my mind around anything to do with economics so it's infinitely interesting to me now that I do.\n\n4 hours ago, Threve said:\n\nEA at the end of the day is a corporation.

Why would you ever stop doing what makes you money in any business.\n\nYes, that's a very fair point. I do completely understand people need to eat still but it's people not realizing or putting their foot down to it so they feel they can get away with it so they continue to like it's just business which isn't personal to them when their decisions ultimately decide on peoples fate which is very personal to them. An example being, when say; any random company gets new management so they decide funds can be used elsewhere then they close down a warehouse where hundreds of employees worked at so while it's not personal to them but hundreds of people had to go home without knowing what to do next. I know that any executives growing a conscious is nothing but a pipe dream though.\n\n4 hours ago, Threve said:\n\nThis outlook directly conflicted Westwood when they were purchased by EA.

Westwood did the best with what they could untill 2005 when most if not all quit and went to work at Petroglyph Games.\n\nOh Petroglyph, aren't they remaking a sort of a Renegade meets Borderlands with their comic book art style game? Slips my mind on what the name of it is but I saw a vid of it last night. Gotta say I personally was digging what I saw & would definitely give it a try when it's out.\n\nI completely agree on all your points too btw, even before I saw vids of the Westwood crew admitting \"how much fun they truly had & marveled at how they couldn't believe they got paid to work on the project\" is something I could tell from just playing the game & watching the cut-scenes LOL\n\nDefinitely looks like they made a blast making their games, that's for sure. 2005 sounds about right because my attention went to other games around that time but I have never completely quit Renegade since I ALWAYS came back to it if I was gaming in that point of my life. Renegade thankfully never dies. Amazing game even if it has it's flaws.\n\n4 hours ago, Threve said:\n\nTo give you an idea of how much Westwood cares about their games and players.. they restored the internet to a 14 year old game so people can play multiplayer again for free.\n\nWow that's incredible man! Definitely shows it's Westwood that cares most & I can definitely now see why everyone is so fond of Westwood after learning more of the backstory behind everything. Westwood is out there reconnecting official servers to games approaching their second decade but Nintendo Wii prematurely pulled it's servers on us Mario Kart fans LOL I can see why everyone geeks so hard about Westwood.\n\nWestwood is really the mother Teresa of gaming LOL\n\n4 hours ago, Threve said:\n\nIt's just not profitable enough.

You probably are right on it not being profitable to begin with though. I think you're right about them making more than RTS games which exactly where a Renegade or similar series could have filled it's shoes. Take something they are already good at like RTS and add FPS/3PS elements then milk that for all its worth imo. There's an entire gaping hole of a market with that single idea right there. Doesn't have to exclusively be like Renegade either. The idea itself oozes endless potential. How many games have given us a RTS/FPS/3PS elements into one game? Not very many but I'm all ears if you do know of such games.\n\nDo share that vid you saw in your discord serve though, sounds intriguing. Been looking up lots of old Renegade vids & other C&C content lately. Thanks for chatting me about all of this!\n\nEdited August 20, 2020 by buttnutella"
