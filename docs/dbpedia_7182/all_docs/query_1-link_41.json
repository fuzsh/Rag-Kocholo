        "text": "This is a brief look at the history of companies who have developed games for the Command & Conquer franchise. The years in brackets show the periods when they held the rights to the franchise.\n\nList of companies (click to scroll to a specific company):\n\nWestwood Studios & Westwood/EA Pacific\n\nIntelligent Games\n\nLooking Glass Studios\n\nEA Los Angeles\n\nBreakAway Games\n\nVictory Games\n\nEA Phenomic\n\nEAsy Studios\n\nEnvision Entertainment\n\nMythic\n\nRedwood Studios\n\nPetroglyph Games\n\nWestwood Studios & Westwood/EA Pacific (1995 – 2003)\n\nWestwood Studios was a computer and video game developer, based in Las Vegas, Nevada. It was founded by Brett Sperry and Louis Castle in 1985 as Westwood Associates. Their early years were spent on contract jobs which included porting other companies’ games for different platforms, the first being Temple of Apshai Trilogy for the Macintosh in 1985. In 1986, they struck a deal with Strategy Simulations, Inc. (SSI), who published their early original games like Roadwar 2000 (1986) and Mars Saga (1988). They became more noticed by the public with later games like the Dungeons & Dragons-themed titles DragonStrike (1990), Eye of the Beholder (1991), and Eye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (1991), as well as BattleTech: The Crescent Hawks’ Inception (1988) and BattleTech: The Crescent Hawks’ Revenge (1990).\n\nWestwood caught the eyes of several publishers, including Sierra On-Line and Virgin Games, which offered a purchase. Although Sierra allegedly offered a higher deal, Westwood chose Virgin Games due to their publishing infrastructure that was already in place. The transaction took place in 1992, and Westwood Associates was renamed to Westwood Studios. In the same year, they released Dune II: Building of a Dynasty, regarded as the first proper real-time strategy game, becoming incredibly influential in the years to come. Dune II inspired many other studios to create their own real-time strategy games, most notable being Blizzard Entertainment, who created WarCraft: Orcs and Humans out of the desire to see what they could do better and implement multiplayer to the genre.\n\nAround this time, Westwood continued creating games which they were already warmed up for – adventures like The Legend of Kyrandia series (1992 – 1994) and Young Merlin (1993), as well as role-playing games like Lands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos (1993).\n\nIn 1995, they created their own real-time strategy IP around the idea and mechanics of Dune II, and called it Command & Conquer. Vastly surpassing their sales expectations, the game became a worldwide hit with millions of copies sold, and helped in further popularizing the RTS genre. In the same year, Virgin Games was renamed to Virgin Interactive Entertainment (VIE). The game received an expansion pack, The Covert Operations, in 1996.\n\nIn 1996, Westwood also released a spin-off of Command & Conquer, called Red Alert, originally envisioned as a prequel, but ultimately led to the creation of a separate universe. At this point, the Command & Conquer brand was well-known in the gaming industry. It received two expansion packs, Counterstrike and The Aftermath, in 1997. In the same year, Command & Conquer: Sole Survivor was released, but was abandoned and forgotten shortly thereafter. 1997 also featured the releases of Blade Runner and Lands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny.\n\nBy 1998, VIE was facing financial difficulties and was forced to sell off some of its assets, Westwood included. On 17 August 1998, Electronic Arts bought Westwood Studios and VIE’s US assets for $122.5 million. Among those assets was a studio in Irvine, California called Burst, which EA rebranded as Westwood Pacific.\n\nAfter the acquisition, Westwood released C&C: Red Alert – Retaliation for the PlayStation and Dune 2000 (outsourced to Intelligent Games), which still used Virgin’s branding in earlier prints, as well as Golden Nugget 64 and Sports Car GT. In 1999, they released Lands of Lore III, Recoil (helped by Zipper Interactive, who would make MechWarrior 3 in the same engine), and the much-delayed and troubled, but commercially and critically successful Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun. Tiberian Sun would receive the Firestorm expansion in March 2000.\n\nMeanwhile, Westwood Pacific released Nox in February 2000, by which time they had already started production on Command & Conquer: Red Alert 2, the first game in the series not to be developed by the Las Vegas studio, and released it in October of the same year, with the Yuri’s Revenge expansion coming in October 2001. Both of these “delegated” C&C titles became fan favourites.\n\nWestwood’s Las Vegas studio was stretched across several projects at the same time, only some of which were released (to lukewarm response): Emperor: Battle for Dune (2001; also outsourced to Intelligent Games), Command & Conquer: Renegade (2002), Pirates: Legend of the Black Kat (2002), and Earth & Beyond (2002). The latter performed poorly, and was one of the reasons Electronic Arts closed the studio in early 2003. This led to the cancellation of several Command & Conquer games like Incursion and Continuum. A sequel to Renegade had already been cancelled after entering early production, due to possible clashing with the sales of DICE’s Battlefield 1942.\n\nWestwood’s Pacific studio was rebranded as Electronic Arts Pacific by 2002, and released Command & Conquer: Generals in February 2003, which sold well and was well-received despite numerous last-minute design changes. Electronic Arts shuffled Westwood’s assets, and merged its remains along with EA Pacific into the RTS team at EA Los Angeles in 2003, and invited Westwood’s Las Vegas staff to join the studio. Some accepted, some went to found Petroglyph Games in April 2003, and some went to different studios.\n\nWestwood received an entry to the Guinness Book of Records for selling more than 10 million copies of Command & Conquer worldwide. In 2015, Louis Castle and Brett Sperry received the Industry Icons award at the Game Awards in the name of Westwood Studios.\n\nGames developed by Westwood Associates/Studios\n\nTemple of Apshai Trilogy (1985) (ports for Amiga, Atari ST, Macintosh, for Epyx)\n\nBlackjack Academy (1987)\n\nQuestron II (1988)\n\nDonald’s Alphabet Chase (1988)\n\nBattleTech: The Crescent Hawk’s Inception (1988)\n\nMars Saga (1988)\n\nHillsfar (1989)\n\nA Nightmare on Elm Street (1989)\n\nCircuit’s Edge (1990)\n\nBattleTech: The Crescent Hawks’ Revenge (1990)\n\nGoofy’s Railway Express (1990)\n\nDragonStrike (1990)\n\nMickey’s Runaway Zoo (1991)\n\nEye of the Beholder (1991)\n\nEye of the Beholder II: The Legend of Darkmoon (1991)\n\nOrder of the Griffon (1992)\n\nDungeons & Dragons: Warriors of the Eternal Sun (1992)\n\nThe Legend of Kyrandia (1992)\n\nDragonStrike (1992)\n\nDune II: Building of a Dynasty (1992)\n\nThe Legend of Kyrandia: Hand of Fate (1993)\n\nYoung Merlin (1993)\n\nLands of Lore: The Throne of Chaos (1993)\n\nDune: The Battle for Arrakis (1994)\n\nThe Legend of Kyrandia: Malcolm’s Revenge (1994)\n\nThe Lion King (1994)\n\nCommand & Conquer (1995)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Covert Operations (1996)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert (1996)\n\nGames People Play: Hearts, Spades & Euchre (1997)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert: Counterstrike (1997) (with Intelligent Games)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert: The Aftermath (1997) (with Intelligent Games)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Special Gold Edition (1997)\n\nLands of Lore: Guardians of Destiny (1997)\n\nBlade Runner (1997)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Sole Survivor (1997)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert: Retaliation (1998)\n\nDune 2000 (1998) (with Intelligent Games)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Tiberian Sun (1999)\n\nLands of Lore III (1999)\n\nRecoil (1999) (with Zipper Interactive)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Tiberian Sun: Firestorm (2000)\n\nEmperor: Battle for Dune (2001) (with Intelligent Games)\n\nPirates: The Legend of Black Kat (2002)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Renegade (2002)\n\nEarth & Beyond (2002)\n\nCancelled games by Westwood Studios\n\nSwords & Sorcery: Come Devils, Come Darkness (cancelled by 1999, reworked by Heuristic Park as Wizards & Warriors in 2000)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Continuum (cancelled by 2002)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Renegade 2 (cancelled in 2002)\n\nCommand & Conquer 3: Incursion (cancelled in 2003)\n\nGames developed by Burst\n\nSpot Goes to Hollywood (1996)\n\nToonstruck (1996)\n\nGrand Slam (1997)\n\nSubSpace (1997)\n\nGames developed by Westwood/EA Pacific\n\nGolden Nugget 64 (1998)\n\nSports Car GT (1999) (for Image Space)\n\nNox (2000)\n\nNox Quest (2000)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert 2 (2000)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert 2: Yuri’s Revenge (2001)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Generals (2003)\n\nIntelligent Games (1997)\n\nIntelligent Games, Ltd. was a game development studio founded in 1988 in London, United Kingdom by Matthew Stibbe at the age of 18. They originally focused on Amiga and DOS games, later shifting to Windows. In 2001, they began developing games for the Nintendo GameCube, the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox, while in 2002 they also started working for the Sony PlayStation 2 and the PalmOS. In 2000, Stibbe left the company and transferred ownership to the company’s management, and in December 2002, the studio was closed.\n\nWestwood Studios called them for assistance several times, for creating skirmish/multiplayer maps for both expansion packs for the original Red Alert and to develop games with the Dune license.\n\nGames developed\n\nImperium (1990)\n\nUSS Ticonderoga: Life and Death on the High Seas (1995)\n\nSimIsle: Missions in the Rainforest (1995)\n\nAzrael’s Tear (1996)\n\nThe Oxfordshire Golf Club (1996)\n\nPGA European Tour (1996) (DOS port, for Polygames)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert: Counterstrike (1997) (maps only, for Westwood Studios)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert: The Aftermath (1997) (maps only, for Westwood Studios)\n\nPGA Tour: Laptop (1997) (additional design for Electronic Arts)\n\nWaterworld (1997)\n\nPGA Tour 98 (1997) (additional development for NuFX)\n\nDune 2000 (1998) (for Westwood Studios)\n\nTiger Woods PGA Tour 99 Golf (additional development for Electronic Arts)\n\nLEGO Loco (1998)\n\nAction Man: Raid on Island X (1999)\n\nPro 18 World Tour Golf (1999)\n\nAction Man: Jungle Storm (2000)\n\nF1 Manager (2000)\n\nLEGO Stunt Rally (2001)\n\nDexter’s Laboratory: Science Ain’t Fair (2001)\n\nCarrera Grand Prix (2001)\n\nThe Powerpuff Girls: Mojo’s Pet Project (2001)\n\nEmperor: Battle for Dune (2001) (for Westwood Studios)\n\nTweenies: Game Time (2001)\n\nUniversal Monsters: Monsterville (2002)\n\n2002 FIFA World Cup (2002) (for Electronic Arts Canada, with Software Creations)\n\nFlipDis (2002)\n\nThe Powerpuff Girls: Gamesville (2002)\n\nFIFA Football 2003 (2002) (additional development for Electronic Arts Canada)\n\nLooking Glass Studios (1999)\n\nLooking Glass Studios, Inc. was formed in 1992 in Cambridge, Massachussets from the merging of two other companies, Blue Sky Productions and Lerner Research. They were best known for the critically-acclaimed Flight Unlimited series and cult classic games like the System Shock and Thief series. For most of their operation, they published games through several different publishers, including Electronic Arts and Eidos Interactive. In 1997, three former Looking Glass employees would form a new studio called Irrational Games, who would eventually work with Looking Glass on System Shock 2.\n\nEidos Interactive bought Looking Glass out in early 2000, but eventually closed the studio on 24 May 2000 due to financial difficulties that arose as a combination of many different factors. The studio’s staff mostly went on to Ion Storm Austin and Mad Doc Software (today Rockstar New England), while others went to many other different studios or left the gaming industry entirely.\n\nIn the Command & Conquer series, Looking Glass Studios was responsible for the Nintendo 64 version of the original Command & Conquer.\n\nGames developed\n\nJohn Madden Football ’93 (1992)\n\nUltima Underworld II: Labyrinth of Worlds (1993)\n\nChuck Yeager’s Air Combat (1993)\n\nSystem Shock (1994)\n\nLinks 386 CD (1995) (Macintosh port, for Access Software)\n\nFlight Unlimited (1995)\n\nTerra Nova: Strike Force Centauri (1996)\n\nFlight Unlimited II (1997)\n\nBritish Open Championship Golf (1997)\n\nThief: The Dark Project (1998)\n\nSystem Shock 2 (1999) (with Irrational Games)\n\nThief: Gold (1999)\n\nCommand & Conquer (1999) (Nintendo 64 port, for Westwood Studios)\n\nFlight Unlimited III (1999)\n\nDestruction Derby 64 (1999)\n\nThief II: The Metal Age (2000)\n\nCancelled games\n\nThief II: Gold (cancelled in 2000)\n\nGames finished by other studios\n\nFlight Combat: Thunder Over Europe (released as Jane’s Combat Simulations: Attack Squadron by Mad Doc Software in 2002)\n\nThief III (released as Thief: Deadly Shadows by Ion Storm Austin in 2004)\n\nElectronic Arts Los Angeles (2003 – 2010)\n\nThe studio was founded in 1995 as DreamWorks Interactive, as a subsidiary of the film company DreamWorks SKG. Thier earliest titles included Someone’s In The Kitchen!, The Neverhood, T’ai Fu: Wrath of the Tiger, BoomBots, and several licensed games from IPs owned by DreamWorks (Goosebumps: Escape from Horrorland, several Jurassic Park games, and Small Soldiers). In 1998, DreamWorks Interactive signed a partnership with Electronic Arts, for whom they have developed the first Medal of Honor game for the Sony PlayStation in 1999 by the concept given by the famous film director Steven Spielberg. In February 2000, Electronic Arts bought DreamWorks Interactive entirely, having the studio further develop Medal of Honor titles and Clive Barker’s Undying (2001).\n\nBy 2002, DreamWorks Interactive was renamed to Electronic Arts Los Angeles (abbreviated as EALA), and the first game released under that brand was Medal of Honor: Frontline. In 2003, the studio was expanded with an RTS division formed by EA Pacific and remains of Westwood Studios. While they operated under the same name and were located in the same building, the two teams were mostly separate internally. The RTS division’s first title was Command & Conquer: Generals – Zero Hour in late 2003. Meanwhile, the rest of the company continued working on the Medal of Honor series.\n\nIn 2004, the SAGE engine that powered C&C Generals was put to use in the RTS game Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth. The sequel, The Battle for Middle-earth II, was released for both Windows and Xbox 360 in February 2006, and received the Rise of the Witch-king expansion (outsourced to BreakAway Games) in November of the same year. These titles helped expand and polish the engine.\n\nAt E3 2006, EA Los Angeles announced the return to the Command & Conquer franchise with Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, which was released in March 2007 and was ported to the Macintosh and Xbox 360. Its expansion pack, Kane’s Wrath was outsourced to BreakAway Games and was released in March 2008, while the most of EALA’s RTS team was working on Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3, released in late 2008. Its expansion, Uprising, was released in early 2009. These titles, although initially divisive in the community, were commercially successful, although hasted production was apparent.\n\nMeanwhile, the rest of the company released Medal of Honor: Vanguard, Medal of Honor: Airborne, Smarty Pants, Boom Blox, two Brain Quest titles, and Lord of the Rings: Conquest. An FPS in the Command & Conquer series, called simply TIBERIUM, was announced in 2008 but was cancelled in the same year, the official reasoning being the game not meeting EA’s quality standards.\n\nBy late 2008, production on a multiplayer-only Command & Conquer spin-off for the Asian market, titled Command & Conquer: Arena was underway, but higher-ups at EA ordered that the game received full AAA status, got a singleplayer campaign, was sold at full price and finished in less than a year. The decision was controversial within EALA, and some developers left the studio as a consequence. The end result was Command & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight, which was panned by critics and fans, and led to the formal dissolution of EALA.\n\nEALA’s FPS department was rebranded in late 2010 as Danger Close, while the RTS team was rebranded as Victory Games, but would not announce themselves until early 2011. Danger Close was put to work on the Medal of Honor rebooted series, but after the two games performed poorly, the studio was folded again and branded as a division of DICE, known as DICE LA, which would only serve as a support studio for games developed by DICE Stockholm. As of early 2020, DICE LA has been headed by the same company lead as Respawn Entertainment, Vince Zampella, who had announced a different path for the studio and even a different name. In 2021, it was revealed to be renamed to Ripple Effect Studios, and it would move on to its own projects after the completion of that year’s Battlefield 2042.\n\nGames developed as DreamWorks Interactive\n\nGoosebumps: Escape from Horrorland (1996)\n\nThe Neverhood (1996)\n\nSomeone’s in the Kitchen!

Their executive staff is composed of several veterans from companies such as MicroProse, Origin Systems, Atari and Acclaim Entertainment. Despite their specialization for “serious games” (i.e. commissioned simulations for various companies and state entities), they have often been tasked with developing commercial games’ expansion packs and/or spin-off titles. Among else, primary development of The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king and Command & Conquer 3: Kane’s Wrath was outsourced to BreakAway Games, with only skeleton teams from EA Los Angeles supervising the production.\n\nCommercial games developed\n\nSid Meier’s Antietam (1998) (for Firaxis Games)\n\nSid Meier’s South Mountain!

While Danger Close was the successor of its FPS team, Victory Games succeeded the RTS team. It was under the leadership of general manager Jon Van Caneghem, of New World Computing and Trion Worlds fame. The studio announced itself in February 2011 and teased that they were working on a Command & Conquer game.\n\nIn December 2011, they announced Command & Conquer: Generals 2, and were into the BioWare label shortly thereafter, being renamed to BioWare Victory. The BioWare label was then dropped in November 2012 and the studio name reverted to Victory Games. Meanwhile, in August 2012, their project was reinvisioned as a live service for free-to-play games in the C&C universe and was simply named Command & Conquer, with Generals 2 content being the first game set to be released within the live service. After troubled development and internal corporate issues, in late October 2013, the Command & Conquer project was cancelled, and Victory Games was closed by EA, with the entire staff being fired. According to our sources, the Command & Conquer IP was not transferred to any EA studio afterwards, and was shelved until 2016, when it was given to a team that would eventually become Redwood Studios.\n\nGames developed\n\nCommand & Conquer: The Ultimate Collection (2012) (compiling and adapting for Origin; with Kalloc Studios)\n\nCancelled games\n\nCommand & Conquer (originally Command & Conquer: Generals 2; in production from 2010 to 2013)\n\nElectronic Arts Phenomic (2011 – 2013)\n\nEA Phenomic was a real-time strategy video game developer, headquartered in Ingelheim, Germany, and founded as Phenomic Game Development in 1997 by Volker Wertich, the person behind Blue Byte Software’s strategy series The Settlers. They were acquired by Electronic Arts on August 23, 2006. In mid-July 2013, EA announced the closure of the Phenomic studio.\n\nGames developed\n\nSpellForce: The Order of Dawn (2003)\n\nSpellForce: The Breath of Winter (2004)\n\nSpellForce: Shadow of the Phoenix (2004)\n\nSpellForce 2: Shadow Wars (2006)\n\nSpellForce 2: Dragon Storm (2007)\n\nBattleForge (2009)\n\nLord of Ultima (2010)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances (2012 – 2013)\n\nCancelled games\n\nCommand & Conquer: Red Alert Alliances (cancelled in 2013)\n\nEAsy Studios (2013 – 2015)\n\nFounded in 2008 and located in Stockholm, Sweden, EAsy was a studio focused on free online games, and was originally a division of DICE. Founded by several game and web industry veterans, EAsy had around 70 staff, who built and operated the game services Battlefield Heroes and Battlefield Play4Free. In July 2013, EAsy Studios took over development of Tiberium Alliances. They were relieved by Envision Entertainment in 2015, after which EAsy Studios is no longer mentioned and their website redirects that of DICE, hinting either at a closure or a re-merge with DICE. The former would be more possible, as both free-to-play Battlefield games they created and maintained were shut down on 14 July 2015, while Tiberium Alliances was transferred to Envision Entertainment around the same time.\n\nGames developed\n\nBattlefield Heroes (2009 – 2015)\n\nBattlefield Play4Free (2011 – 2015)\n\nCommand & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances (2013 – 2015)\n\nEnvision Entertainment (2015 – present)\n\nEnvision Entertainment is a new development studio in Ingelheim, Germany, led by veteran leadership with proven expertise in online free-to-play games.

In April 2015, the company took over the development of Command & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances.\n\nGames developed\n\nCommand & Conquer: Tiberium Alliances (2015 – present)\n\nPath of War (2016) (with Nexon)\n\nThe Settlers: New Allies (2023) (additional development for Ubisoft Düsseldorf)\n\nPioneers of Pagonia (2023 in early access)\n\nMythic (2014?)\n\nMythic was a game development studio from Fairfax, Virginia, originally founded in 1995 as Interworld Productions by Mark Jacobs and Rob Denton. It was renamed to Mythic Entertainment in November 1997 due to the fact that there was already another company called Interworld. It was purchased by Electronic Arts in June 2006, for whom they have made massively-multiplayer online (MMO) games and mobile titles until 29 May 2014, when they were closed. From 2010 to 2012, they operated under the BioWare label, dropping it simultaneously with Victory Games.\n\nIn the Command & Conquer series, Mythic is believed to have been developing an eventually cancelled mobile game called simply Command & Conquer.\n\nGames developed\n\nDragon’s Gate (1996)\n\nRolemaster: Magestorm (1996)\n\nAliens Online (1998) (with Kesmai Corporation)\n\nGodzilla Online (1998) (with Centropolis Interactive)\n\nStarship Troopers: Battlespace (1998)\n\nSpellbinder: The Nexus Conflict (1999)\n\nID4 Online (2000)\n\nDark Age of Camelot (2001)\n\nDark Age of Camelot: Shrouded Isles (2002)\n\nDark Age of Camelot: Foundations (2003)\n\nDark Age of Camelot: Trials of Atlantis (2003)\n\nDark Age of Camelot: Catacombs (2004)\n\nDark Age of Camelot: Darkness Rising (2005)\n\nDark Age of Camelot: Labyrinth of the Minotaur (2007)\n\nWarhammer Online: Age of Reckoning (2008)\n\nUltima Online: Stygian Abyss (2009)\n\nDragon Age II (2011) (additional development for BioWare Corporation)\n\nUltima Forever: Quest for the Avatar (2013)\n\nDungeon Keeper (2013)\n\nCancelled games by Mythic\n\nPopulous (mobile prototype)\n\nCommand & Conquer (mobile prototype)\n\nAerial Combat\n\nRedwood Studios (2016 – present)\n\nRedwood Studios is an Electronic Arts studio operating under the EA Mobile label, located in Redwood Shores, California, USA. They were publicly unveiled on 9 June 2018 during EA Play along with their game Command & Conquer: Rivals, and had been working on it for 2 years prior to the official reveal. Its publicly known key employees are general manager Michael Martinez and game designer Greg Black, a former EA Los Angeles and Blizzard Entertainment employee.\n\nGames developed\n\nCommand & Conquer: Rivals (2018)\n\nunannounced project (TBA)\n\nPetroglyph Games (2018 – 2020)\n\nPetroglyph Games Inc., an independent game developer studio specialized in real-time strategy games, was founded on 1 April 2003 by several former Westwood Studios employees. By 2012, approximately 20% of the Petroglyph Games staff were former Westwood developers, although the number of employees has dwindled since.\n\nTheir first title was the 2006 Star Wars: Empire at War, a real-time strategy that took place both in space and on the surface of planets, which was highly regarded on release and the coming years, also attracting a devoted modding community. Later in the year, the Forces of Corruption expansion pack was released.\n\nFrom 2007, Petroglyph released games with different publishers, including SEGA, Ubisoft, and Greybox, while some were self-published. Their most notable titles were Universe at War: Earth Assault, Panzer General: Allied Assault, Guardians of Graxia, Rise of Immortals (renamed to Battle for Graxia before closure in 2013), and Grey Goo. They released and self-published 8-Bit Armies in 2016, followed closely by the Guardians DLC and mutually compatible standalone expansion packs, 8-Bit Hordes and 8-Bit Invaders. In 2018, they released Forged Battalion.\n\nPetroglyph was also working on End of Nations until 2013, when the game was given to Trion and subsequently entered development hell. They also attempted to create a game called Victory through a kickstarter initiative, but failed to meet the goal. The second attempt in 2015, this time under the name of Victory Command, succeeded, but no news have been released and the official website is currently down. In 2019, they released Conan Unconquered, a survival strategy game not unlike They Are Billions, to lukewarm reception.\n\nOn 14 November 2018, Petroglyph was announced to be involved in the remastered versions of Command & Conquer (1995) and Command & Conquer: Red Alert alongside Lemon Sky Studios, under the supervision of EA producer Jim Vessella. They released the successful Command & Conquer: Remastered Collection on 5 June 2020.\n\nAlso in 2020, they announced EarthBreakers, a tactical first-person shooter game very similar to Command & Conquer: Renegade in gameplay, and briefly offered an early demo to be played on Steam. They halted its development in 2021 to work on a different project. On 30 March 2023, they released The Great War: Western Front published by Frontier Developments. In 2024, they continued their 8-Bit series with 9-Bit Armies: A Bit Too Far in early access.\n\nGames developed\n\nStar Wars: Empire at War (2006)\n\nStar Wars: Empire at War – Forces of Corruption (2006)\n\nUniverse at War: Earth Assault (2007)\n\nPanzer General: Allied Assault (2009)\n\nGuardians of Graxia (2010)\n\nGuardians of Graxia: Elves & Dwarves (2011)\n\nRise of Immortals (2011) (renamed to Battle for Graxia in 2012, closed in 2013)\n\nGrey Goo (2015)\n\nGrey Goo: Emergence (2015)\n\nBattle Battalions (2015)\n\nMytheon (2015)\n\n8-Bit Armies (2016)\n\n8-Bit Armies: Guardians (2016)\n\n8-Bit Hordes (2016)\n\n8-Bit Invaders!
