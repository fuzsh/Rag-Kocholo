        "text": "I bought this game 2 days ago on Steam and played the Red Alert Alliance missions # 1 - 13 in one sitting. Everything was great. The only reason I stopped is because the game crashed and I received the Petroglyph Crash Report. Since then I have been completely unable to play either game in the collection (the map editor still works). I looked up this issue on this and other forums and none of the proposed fixes work including:\n\n*Updating drivers\n\n*Trying a Clean Boot\n\n*Verifying files in Game cache on Steam\n\n*Uninstalling/reinstalling game\n\n*Restarting the computer\n\n*I do not have overclocking software such as MSI afterburner\n\n*Windows Firewall lists all of the apps associated with this game as \"allowed\"\n\nMy computer has the following specs:\n\nIntel Core i7-7700HQ CPU @2.80GHZ\n\n16GB RAM\n\nIntel HD Graphics 630\n\nNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050\n\nI'm worried because the posts I've seen just trail off without resolution even though there are others that seem to be facing the same problems. Still, any help fixing this issue is appreciated and I am willing to retry some of the fixes just in case I made a mistake the first time.\n\nOf course, within 10 minutes of posting about this I try to load the game again and it starts up with only a minor delay as if nothing happened. Even has my old save files. The only thing I did differently in the meantime was to try loading another game in Steam just to see if it would work. Something tells me the fix is not for everyone to just load KOTOR and then close it out immediately, but yet my game is working this very second. I guess I'll update if it stops?\n\nOnce again I appreciate the suggestions, but when I disabled the Intel graphics card my computer struggled mightily (multiple crashes). I'm using a laptop and assuming that whatever resources the NVidia card was using to run the display must have put too much stress on the system overall. I did go to the NVidia Control Center and set the game to run only using the high performance card. Unfortunately I'm still running into the crash report more often than not, but at least when it does load I'm able to knock out a few missions at a time."
