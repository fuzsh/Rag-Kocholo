The purification of deuterium (heavy water) was essential in the development of the atom bomb. He also developed the technique of uranium enrichment using the gaseous diffusion of uranium hexafluoride. His contributions to the Manhattan Project focused on uranium enrichment. Later in his life, Urey did research on the development of organic life from non-living matter. [4]. [5]\n\nHarold knew a woman named Kate Daum who introduced him to her sister Frieda. He married Frieda Daum in Lawrence, Kansas in 1926 and they had four children. They resided in Bergen, New Jersey in the 40s.
