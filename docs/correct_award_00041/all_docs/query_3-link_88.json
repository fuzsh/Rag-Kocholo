After escaping from an\n\nIndiana jail using a wooden pistol in March, John Dillinger was killed outside a Chicago\n\ntheater in July. Washeteria, one of the first laundromats, opened in Fort Worth, Texas. New\n\nYork City grew dim as vicious dust storms swept through the West and South and up the east\n\ncoast. Bonnie (Parker) and Clyde (Barrow) were killed in a police ambush on May 23. William\n\nBeebe descended to record depth of 3,000 feet in his bathysphere. Bruno Hauptmann, an illegal\n\nGerman immigrant, was held for kidnapping the Lindbergh baby. Americans were reading\n\nFitzgerald's\n\nTender is\n\nthe Night;\n\nHilton's Goodbye,\n\nMr. Chips;\n\nand Robert Graves'\n\nI,Claudius.\n\n• Charter Amended • All-American Football\n\n• Chemistry Degrees • Tennis Courts\n\n• Pep Rally Bonfire • Old Coins Found\n\n• Ice Carnival Events • Student Paper Honored\n\n• Ice Carnival Romance • Baseball Scoreboard\n\n• Hockey Champions\n\nCharter Amended.\n\nThe New York State Regents amended Clarkson's charter to authorize the\n\nCollege to grant the honorary degree Doctor of Engineering.\n\nChemistry Degrees.\n\nClarkson's first three degrees of Bachelor of Chemistry were awarded.\n\nThis was the first class required to earn total honor points equal to graduation hours (144 at the\n\ntime). Fall enrollment dropped from 371 in 1933 to 346.\n\nPep Rally Bonfire.\n\nPrior to the St. Lawrence-Clarkson football game, the freshmen, members\n\nof '38, spent the better part of the day gathering wood for a bonfire on the Clarkson estate near\n\nSnell Field, and piling it high. Once it was ready, three freshmen were left on guard. These\n\nthree, however, were outwitted in their lonely vigil by the \"Larries\" who set it on fire before the\n\nrest of the Clarkson students could arrive to begin the pep rally. Fortunately, the freshmen class\n\nrallied, and gathered another large supply of wood, so that when the rest of the \"Techers\"\n\narrived, there was another good blaze going.\n\nIce Carnival Events.\n\nEvents for the Fourth Annual Ice Carnival began with\n\nGrace Law of the Adirondack Skating Club performing Spirit of Ice Carnival. This\n\nwas followed by the crowning of the Ice Carnival King and Queen wearing the\n\nsame royal robes used by the world-famous radio announcer and world traveller\n\nLowell Thomas and his queen at the Lake Placid Ice Carnival several weeks\n\nbefore, and preceded by 10 children in appropriate costumes bearing the crowns\n\non pillows.
