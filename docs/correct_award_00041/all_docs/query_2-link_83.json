        "text": "The decision as to whether the U.S. should make a hydrogen bomb, said Harry Truman, is mine and nobody else’s. But there were a lot of people looking over his shoulder, and they seemed remarkably in agreement on how he should play his hand: they wanted the H-bomb-built.\n\n“I am very unhappy,” said Dr. Harold Clayton Urey, the Nobel Prizewinning atomic chemist, “to conclude that the hydrogen bomb should be developed and built. I do not think we should intentionally lose the armaments race; to do this will be to lose our liberties, and with Patrick Henry, I value my liberties more than I do my life.”\n\nShould the Russians win the race and build the first H-bomb, he added, they might decide that they did not even have to use it. They might say: ” ‘We will build these bombs and issue ultimata to the western countries, and the millenium of Communism will be with us immediately…’ “\n\nHarold Urey, standing before the Roosevelt Day dinner of the Americans for Democratic Action in New York’s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, had a right to be heard. His Nobel Prize had been won in 1934 for the discovery of heavy hydrogen, a basic step toward the development both of the first atomic bomb and any hydrogen bomb that may come. He had predicted the date of the Russian atomic bomb explosion far more accurately than had U.S. military or political leaders.\n\n“I personally hope very much,” he said, “that the [hydrogen] bombs will not explode . . . However, nature does not behave in the way I should like at times, and so there is no use in engaging in wishful thinking. I think we should assume that the bomb can be built.” His estimate of the cost of development: $100 million.\n\nOthers joined in, urging the building of the H-bomb: Elder Statesman Bernard Baruch, Republican Senator John Bricker, Eleanor Roosevelt, Senator Tom Connally.\n\nWhat, thenâ€”or whoâ€”was holding up the President’s decision? If there were voices inside the Administration counseling against the H-bomb, they did not make their arguments public. Many a Washington correspondent pointed the finger at retiring Atom Boss David Lilienthal, who last week characterized all such stories about him as “inaccurate,” but was carefulâ€”on security groundsâ€”not to say just where he did stand.\n\nThis week the President made his decision. He ordered work on the H-bomb to go ahead. Harry Truman’s announcement had in it no sabre-rattling swagger, only the reluctant awareness of a duty that had to be done. He knew that he was authorizing construction of the deadliest weapon ever known to man.\n\nWhite House aides on Tuesday afternoon summoned a dozen reporters, handed them this statement from the President:\n\n“It is part of my responsibility as commander-in-chief of the armed forces to see to it that our country is able to defend itself against any possible aggressor.\n\n“Accordingly, I have directed the Atomic Energy Commission to continue its work on all forms of atomic weapons, including the so-called hydrogen or superbomb. Like all other work in the field of atomic weapons, it is being and will be carried forward on a basis consistent with the over-all objectives of our program for peace and security.\n\n“This we shall continue to do until a satisfactory plan for international control of atomic energy is achieved. We shall also continue to examine all those factors that effect our program for peace and this country’s security.”\n\n*The New York Daily News launched another name for it: the Hellbomb."
