        "text": "About this book\n\nHarold C. Urey (1893–1981) was one of the most famous American scientists of the twentieth century. Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1934 for his discovery of deuterium and heavy water, Urey later participated in the Manhattan Project and NASA's lunar exploration program. Biologists might better know him for his contributions to the now famous Miller–Urey experiment which showed amino acids, life's basic building blocks, could form spontaneously from chemical precursors in an environment that simulated conditions on the early Earth. In this, the first ever biography of the chemist, Matthew Shindell shines new light on Urey's achievements and efforts to shape his public and private lives.\n\nShindell follows Urey through his orthodox religious upbringing, the scientific work that won him the Nobel, and his subsequent efforts to use his fame to intervene in political, social, and scientific matters. At times, Urey succeeded, including when he helped create the fields of isotope geochemistry and cosmochemistry. But other endeavors, such as his promotion of world governance of atomic weapons, failed. By exploring those efforts, as well as Urey's evolution from farm boy to scientific celebrity, we can discern broader changes in the social and intellectual landscape of twentieth-century America. More than a life story, The Life and Science of Harold C. Urey immerses readers in the struggles and triumphs of not only an extraordinary man, but also his extraordinary times.\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction The Making and Remaking of an American Chemist\n\nOne From Farm Boy to Wartime Chemist\n\nTwo From Industrial Chemistry to Copenhagen\n\nThree From Novice in Europe to Expert in America\n\nFour From Nobel Laureate to Manhattan Project Burnout\n\nFive A Separation Man No More\n\nSix A Return to Science\n\nSeven To Hell with the Moon!\n\nEpilogue A Life in Science\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nNotes\n\nList of Archives\n\nList of Oral History Interviews\n\nBibliography\n\nIndex\n\nCustomer Reviews\n\nBiography"
