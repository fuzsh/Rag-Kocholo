        "text": "Featured Speaker: John Urey, Ph.D.\n\nHarold Urey was an orphan who grew up on a 60-\n\nacre farm in Indiana. His family were members of the\n\nChurch of the Brethren. This lecture by his son John,\n\na new Osher member, will discuss how he became a\n\nman who spoke to Kings and Queens and helped to\n\nfound a great public university as the first hire at\n\nUC San Diego. Of course it helped that he won a\n\nNobel Prize for the discovery of deuterium, a key\n\ncomponent of nuclear weapons. Join us to learn\n\nmore about this famous American, to discuss his life,\n\nhis family, his scientific work and his politics.\n\nPresenter Biography\n\nUrey is Harold Urey’s fourth\n\nchild and only son, who was born five years\n\nafter the Nobel Prize and who quickly became\n\n“Prince” John. He grew up in Chicago, got his\n\nB.A. in Chemistry at Swarthmore and Ph.D. in\n\nBiochemistry from Caltech. He tried his hand at\n\ncollege teaching for 10 years and then switched to\n\noptometry. He moved to San Diego in 1983 and\n\nstopped working when COVID made standing eye\n\nto eye with patients risky.\n\nCoordinator: Mavis Porter"
