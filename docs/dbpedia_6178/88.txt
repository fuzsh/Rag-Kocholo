At about 0810 UTC on the 27th day of July 2024, I tuned in to WTWW, broadcasting on 5085 kHz in the English language.

The program consisted of religious music.

The signal was coming from the Lebanon 100kW transmitter in Tennessee, USA. (Short Wave Info 2023)

The overall reception of WTWW was good. The signal strength was good and there was only slight fading of the signal. There was no interference from other stations on the frequency or on adjacent frequencies.

There were some static crashes on the band, but as the signal was so good, they did not significantly impact on listening pleasure.
