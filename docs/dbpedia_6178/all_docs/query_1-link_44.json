Externally, meanwhile, they share an animosity towards the United States Government, as well as a willingness to serve as pawns of the Kremlin's geopolitics.

I`m checking following this in BDXC-UK Communication, first report I`ve seen this year about MiniTransat: ``13735 1505 MiniTransat Sailing, France. Maritime wx, OM, FF, EE // 7340 333 24/07 GS = Gabby Simmonds Worcester Sony ICF-2001D, MLA-30+`` 13735, from 1458 past 1500, NO signal at all direct. Propagation very degraded with little else on band outside USA. So by 1513 I`m tuned to UTwente where 13735.001- is audible poorly at S7/S8, as to be expected at short skip distance, much better on 7340.000- at S9+5/10, YL in heavily accented English with weather info, foneticizing e.g. NNW as November November Whisky. Mixed with French and hard to tell when she`s switching languages. 1522 ``that`s all the weather today`` and over to OM in French, seems like race standings. 1529 music bits. 1530 she`s back talking about Olympix, medal counts, etc. 1532 familiar ``Nuits de Paris`` song, not sure of proper title; and many other songs filling out the hour. First several minutes would play a tune for only a minute or so, fade it down, and start another; must be a very impatient DJ. Chopoff at 1559.7* But which race is this for? The big one with SWx broadcasts like this, La Boulangère Mini Transat, does not appear to be in progress now nor in July. In fact this website https://minitransat.fr/ has nothing about this year, but lots about 2023, when arrival dates ranged from November 8 to 18. That`s the one from France to Canarias and then to Guadeloupe. This site shows many other races including some starting 19 July, 18 and 24 August; I wonder which and how many merit SW broadasts: https://www.classemini.com/?mode=courses These two entries in today`s HFCC update could be a clue, note effective dates: 7340 1500 1600 27W,36,37W ISS 250 266 0 146 1234567 120724 250824 D 4950 Fra F TDF TDF 4613 MT 13735 1500 1600 27W,36,37W ISS 250 256 0 217 1234567 120724 250824 D 17400 Fra F TDF TDF 4614 MT I also searched serial #s 4612 and 4615 for more, unfound. These are also in EiBi without datespans, not Aoki (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) ** NEW ZEALAND. 9700, Aug 12 at 0608, Britishish English, presumed RNZ now, risking RHC collision if on later than last check in its English at 0437 (Glenn Hauser, OK, WOR) ** OKLAHOMA. 1170, Aug 12 at 0613 UT, instead of Olds from NewsOn6, KOTV Tulsa with 10-second loops of 3 seconds of tone and ``This is the TSN?

Unclear how an unused offtopic satellite channel could get plugged into on the air (Glenn Hauser, Enid, WOR) ** SPAIN. 17855, Mon Aug 12 at 2200, token English from SNR is a JBA carrier direct to here! Extremely unusual due to major geomagnetic storm. Slightly better on 15520 off the back at 2207 and the others 17715 & 15390 JBA carriers. By UTwente check at 2227, all are JBA.

Tamandaré in Olinda, Pernambuco, ZYI772. Would you believe that mwlist does not specify the STATE of each ZY entry? It`s a huge country and that would be like eliminating states from USA listings - the most informed American would never be able to know the state for every little town with a radio station - and many town names are duplicated in several states. So I had to look in WRTH 2024 which does show the states. BTW, Tamandaré sounds familiar: was it also on SW long ago?

Many hams go to Caribbean or Central American countries for contest weekends, where they can rent the use of a well-appointed stations like TI7W. I'm guessing he's there for the Worked All Europe contest this weekend (CW version), and perhaps he's staying over til the following weekend for the North American QSO Party (SSB). When visitors are operating during non-contest periods, I believe they must apply for their own station license (or there may be a reciprocal agreement in some countries), thus the TI5/N4YDU callsign. Since they are only away from home temporarily, I wouldn’t expect them to edit their QRZ page. Some ops, especially frequent contesters, prefer to make \"quickontax\", as you call them, even if they're not in a contest at the moment.
