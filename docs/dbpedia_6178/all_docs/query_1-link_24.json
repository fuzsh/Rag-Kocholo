In addition to private broadcasters, the United States also has government broadcasters and relay stations for international public broadcasters. Most privately owned shortwave stations have been religious broadcasters, either wholly owned and programmed by Roman Catholic and evangelical Protestant charities or offering brokered programming consisting primarily of religious broadcasters. To better reach other continents of the world, several stations are located in far-flung US territories. Shortwave stations in the US are not permitted to operate exclusively for a domestic audience; they are subject to antenna and power requirements to reach an international audience.",

Critics of private broadcasting in the US have argued that the service allows extremists to spread their message to others without fear of censorship,[1] while others argue that private shortwave broadcasters provide an important service in providing programming to people without access to other forms of uncensored media.[citation needed]"
