        "text": "The Government carried out a comprehensive TV policy review in 1998, and subsequently opened up the TV market in 2000. There is no ceiling on the number of licences to be granted, subject to physical or technological constraints.\n\nThe Government has adopted a technology-neutral regulatory regime since 2000. TV programme services are licensed and regulated according to their nature and pervasiveness rather than their transmission mode. Under the Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap. 562), the four categories of TV programme services are, domestic free, domestic pay, non-domestic, and other licensable TV programme services.\n\nThere are currently three domestic free TV programme service licensees: i-CABLE HOY Limited (formerly âFantastic Television Limitedâ), HK Television Entertainment Company Limited and Television Broadcasts Limited. They are providing ten domestic channels in digital format by using frequency spectrum and/or fixed network as transmission mode. The three broadcasters are required to broadcast positive programmes, including news bulletins, current affairs programmes, and programmes for children and young persons, etc. in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Authority for fulfilment of the needs of the general public in Hong Kong. RTHK, as Hong Kong's public service broadcaster that produces programmes of public interest, provides five digital TV channels.\n\nThe domestic pay TV programme service licensee namely PCCW Media Limited, is providing over 200 pay TV channels using fully digitised platform. Pay TV services are subject to less stringent content regulation but it is a statutory requirement that the service provider must provide a locking device to protect minors from accessing contents for adults.\n\nHong Kong positions itself as the broadcasting hub of the Asia Pacific region. There are nine non-domestic TV programme service licensees providing over 200 satellite TV channels for the Asia Pacific region. The Government also adopts an \"open sky\" policy. Through satellite master antenna TV (SMATV) and TV receive only systems, Hong Kong viewers are free to receive satellite TV channels that are intended for general reception as uplinked from Hong Kong and elsewhere. There are now over 600 such free-to-air satellite TV channels available for reception in Hong Kong. Over 770,000 premises in multi-storey buildings have access to satellite TV channels through their SMATV systems.\n\nHong Kong implemented full digital TV broadcast on 1 December 2020. The reason for implementing such a measure is that digital TV broadcast out-performs analogue TV broadcast in terms of picture quality and more importantly, valuable spectrum can thus be vacated to address the increasing demand for spectrum for high value-added mobile telecommunications services. To tie in with the implementation of full digital TV broadcast, the Government launched the Community Care Fund Digital Television Assistance Programme from 14 January 2020 to 15 July 2021 to assist needy analogue TV households to purchase digital TV sets or set-top boxes, so that they can continue to watch free TV after the implementation of full digital TV broadcast.\n\nSound broadcasting services are regulated under Part 3A of the Telecommunications Ordinance (Cap. 106). There are 14 local radio channels serving Hong Kong. The two commercial broadcasters, namely Hong Kong Commercial Broadcasting Company Limited and Metro Broadcast Corporation Limited, each broadcast three channels. Eight channels are operated by RTHK, the public service broadcaster.\n\nThe broadcasters are required to provide balanced entertainment, informative and educational programmes, including news and weather reports, current affairs, arts and culture programmes, and programmes for young persons, senior citizens and children. Programmes in Filipino, Hindi, and Thai are also broadcasted to cater for the needs of ethnic minority groups in Hong Kong.\n\nThe broadcasting sector has experienced rapid development in Hong Kong and worldwide. The Government is committed to modernising the regulatory framework in response to changes in market landscape and technological developments. The Government completed the Review of Television and Sound Broadcasting Regulatory Framework in 2018 and proposed a number of measures which aim to remove outdated requirements for licensed broadcasters so as to further promote the development of the local broadcasting industry. The Broadcasting and Telecommunications Legislation (Amendment) Bill 2019 that gives effect to the above measures was passed in October 2020.Â The Government will continue to keep in view the updates and developments in the broadcasting sector and strive to provide a conducive environment for the development of the local broadcasting industry.\n\nReview of Television and Sound Broadcasting Regulatory Regimes"
