If the station ID'ed itself then I must have missed it. Usually, broadcasters play a station interval between shows. I didn't hear that.\n\nI recorded 5085khz after Truth to Ponder to show 5085khz was active. The schedules are still listing WTWW on 5085khz. WTWW's website does not say aanything about returning to the air. Just links to streams and a mention of \"website under construction\" amongst other things. wtww.us. Truth to Ponder wasn't in the WTWW schedules.\n\nI am thinking it is WTWW because it was the station that always has been pretty strong at my location in Oklahoma City. Sorry about the controversial commentary in the video but it's the only way I could show 5085khz being active."
