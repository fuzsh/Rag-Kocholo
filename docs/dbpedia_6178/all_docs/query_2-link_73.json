        "text": "There has been a lot of testing over last few month, with the new working prototype AM receiver. It has taking almost two years to get to this point with a lot of testing to find out what works and what does not.\n\nThe performance on Long wave and Medium wave is outstanding with the external loop configuration, this has many advantages over a ferrite rod antenna design. The Short wave performance is OK, where the front end RF transformers need to be improved with more testing. It out performs my Tecsun PL-398 that uses Digital Signal Processing (DSP), and comes close to what is possible within the high noise floor that you get in buildup areas.\n\nThe adaptive processing works very well, where you can set in software to work based on the signal level and if there is a pilot tone been detected (stereo indicator), this works for both the AM bands and for FM. As with the adaptive processing the noise reduction also works with both AM and FM bands, that has been use with Short wave and Long wave stations. The de-emphasis cave is design for 50 μs, to pass a wider modulation bandwidth through up to 12.5 kHz.\n\nThe Denon TU-680NAB has been the reference receiver throughout all the testing to get to this test point. As this was designed for the high end audio market in the 1990's, to provide the best possible performance for HiFi systems of the day.\n\nTesting with the Denon TU-680NAB\n\nAM range:\n\nTU-680NAB, 520 to 1710 kHz\n\nPrototype, 100 to 21000 kHz\n\nFM range:\n\nTU-680NAB, 87.5 to 108 MHz\n\nPrototype, 76 to 108 MHz\n\nAudio bandwidth wide:\n\nTU-680NAB, AM 10 kHz, FM 15 kHz\n\nPrototype, AM 12.5 kHz, FM 15 kHz\n\nAudio bandwidth narrow:\n\nTU-680NAB, AM 7.5 kHz\n\nPrototype, AM 7.5 kHz\n\nAdaptive processing:\n\nTU-680NAB, none\n\nPrototype, Dynamic expander and noise reduction\n\nStep size:\n\nTU-680NAB, AM 10kHz only\n\nPrototype, AM 1 and 100 kHz, works with both 9 kHz and 10 kHz channel spacings\n\nDe-emphasis cave:\n\nTU-680NAB, AM 75 μs fixed\n\nPrototype, AM 50 μs that can be switch on or off\n\nStereo reception:\n\nTU-680NAB, AM and FM\n\nPrototype, AM and FM (all bands)\n\nDisplay readout information:\n\nAs you tell there is a lot been displayed within limited space, not just signal level, but also have a phase meter useful for finding the center frequency when tuning, and show phase shift alongside the signal level. VU meter that highlight the amount of audio processing that is been done on the selected radio station, if you see 00 most of the time, this means that it is running very large amounts of processing or there is a lot of background noise. When you are on the FM bands the center tune meter is displayed that replaces the phase meter, so you know if you are on the high or low side when selecting a radio station.\n\nOn the back panel there is a F-connector for the Short wave and the FM bands. A RJ-45 socket that connects to the active loop antenna for the Long wave and Medium wave bands. On the four RCA sockets there is left and right audio out, with FM Multiplex out and a 450 kHz IF out from the AM side, providing access to connect up a digital decoder or PC sound card interface, providing a level of flexibility.\n\nThis will be marketed as a high end broadcast receiver, the aim is to stay well clear of low cost products from China, that are all to common these days. This is a Canadian product, showing that there are many new ideas and what possible in this area of development. With all these advancement it possible to provide a high quality music programming using AM radio that sounds as good as FM, with the advantages of larger coverage areas.\n\nA major issue that this receiver has highlighted, is the audio processing that is done to the extreme on many broadcast services both on AM and FM. Yet there is still hope, there is a few radio stations that still sound good on a high end sound system.\n\nThis shows what is possible when there is time available, highlighting that lock down can be a positive thing, when it comes innovation. I now looking for feedback on doing a run of kits or possibly looking at making this into a end product. As this receiver has out performed all my current broadcast receivers, on Long wave, Medium wave, and is the only hardware based Short wave AM stereo (C-QuAM) receiver every made.\n\nOver the last few months I have been doing a number of upgrades such as, a RGB display, and new software updates. With testing on a range of signals from AM to C-QuAM and SSB, I am know looking at making a few small board changes for the product ran, but I also do not want to remove some of the functionality.\n\nThe BFO mode was useful to receiver Drunken DJ Radio WDDR, on 4.015 MHz, other music format stations such as the mighty KBC all seem to be in mono on shortwave. This also goes for all the music radio stations within the Toronto area on Medium wave, where the main one being Zoomer radio that would sound somewhat better if was using C-QuAM. Leaving just CFCO on 630 kHz, that has a county music format that is in AM stereo, but we have a local station here in Toronto on 640 kHz which has been somewhat of issue for testing. There was also CFAJ on 1220 kHz coming in very well here, but again it was just another mono music station, that had limited usefulness for testing."
