Philippines.\n\nBest Shortwave Radio Stations In The UK\n\nThere are numerous shortwave broadcasters in the UK, but admittedly, they can be a little harder to find online. Frequency lists are easier to come by compared to specific stations that provide programming to their listeners.\n\nWith that in mind, we thought we’d at least highlight the following:\n\nBBC World Service\n\nBBC World Service, as you can imagine, is owned by the BBC. Their programming includes news, speech, and discussions in more than 40 languages using a variety of platforms, including shortwave.\n\nWhat Is A Shortwave Radio Station?\n\nShortwave (or SW) radio refers to a type of radio transmission utilizing shortwave frequencies: in the 3,000 to 30,000 kilohertz frequency range. These types of radio waves can and do use reflection or refraction to extend their range, also known as “skip” propagation or skywave. This allows for greater range than line-of-sight propagation.\n\nIn simple terms, it means listening to radio in the high frequency wavelength.\n\nDespite the name SW can be used for long distance communication. It is commonly used to broadcast voice and music covering large areas (sometimes even entire continents and bigger areas than that).\n\nAs you’re about to find out, many shortwave radio initiatives are government owned, or primarily feature religious broadcasting. There are clandestine operations targeting certain regions as well.\n\nAnother way of thinking about it is this. Before we had podcasts, we had shortwave radio broadcasts. SW gave individuals a way of sharing their voice and developing their own radio shows.\n\nSW radio isn’t new, and these days it is considered outdated by many. But even major corporations continue to broadcast via shortwave (along with other platforms), and it is still possible to get your voice on the air using the technology.\n\nAnything else we could say about the inner workings of shortwave radio is highly technical and mostly academic, but if you love the science behind how things work, it might be worth Googling and doing further reading on.\n\nOf course, we will be looking at other aspects of shortwave radio here, so keep reading…\n\nHow Do I Listen To Shortwave Radio?\n\nIf you want to listen to shortwave radio, you’ll need a shortwave radio kit. You can build your own, but these days, as you might expect, there are plenty of pre-made solutions as well.\n\nIt’s important to note that there are a variety of factors that can affect which shortwave radio stations you can listen to and when. Given that the medium utilizes reflections and refractions, this should not come as a surprise.\n\nSome of these factors include your equipment, the time of day, as well as your location (rural or urban). Also, rarely do shortwave radio broadcasts go 24/7. Many stations only broadcast at selected times during the day.\n\nAs result, sometimes, it can be difficult to find stations to listen to. Programming details can often be found online, so if in doubt, Google for broadcaster information.\n\nWe’ll be looking at some shortwave radio stations you can tune into a little later.\n\nAnyway, as with most things, shortwave radio needs to be experienced to be understood. If what we’re talking about here occurs to you as a little “nebulous” or obscure, it will make a lot more sense once you get your SW radio kit and start tuning in to shortwave radio.\n\nWhy Would I Want To Listen To Shortwave Radio?\n\nThese days, there are many ways to connect with your peers and social groups – social media, forums, email, SMS/text messaging, blogs, and more. And to be fair, these are great ways to create and maintain connections.\n\nBut despite the convenience of the many new channels available, no doubt you would agree that each provide a bit of a different experience, right? And not all of them are conducive to more personal connections.\n\nWhich is one of the reasons people still love shortwave radio. Yes, it’s still a great way to communicate with people across the world. But it offers a different kind of experience. You can get different perspectives on news, what’s happening in the world, politics, religion and spirituality, and more.\n\nWikipedia even lists multiple clandestine shortwave radio stations targeting different regions like China, Cuba, Rwanda, Sudan, Uganda, and more. We don’t have anything further to say about that, but you can draw your own conclusions.\n\nThe point is that when listening to local or national news, you’re always going to get a perspective that’s filtered through your country or region. But by listening to shortwave radio, you can get another view on the events unfolding in a specific area. Oftentimes, you will find that different cultures and countries react differently to news items than you might expect.\n\nAgain, it might seem like the internet would be the best resource for getting different perspectives on news and events, but this is much harder than you might expect.\n\nNot only does the internet automatically feed you local news, but most news outlets also share the same perspective, especially these days. Though not well known, it’s a confirmed fact that 15 billionaires own most if not all news companies in America. So, finding a fresh viewpoint is harder than it sounds.\n\nIf you like to stay informed, connect with people on a global level, and get a more worldly outlook on news and events, then listening to shortwave radio is sure to prove a rewarding pastime.\n\nShortwave radio certainly isn’t for everyone, but it offers an experience you can’t find elsewhere.\n\nHow Can I Start A Shortwave Radio Station?\n\nAs noted earlier, it is possible to start your own shortwave radio station. But it is necessary to consider things from multiple angles, including practical, legal, and business model considerations before jumping in. Here is an overview of the steps you’ll need to take to get your shortwave radio station up and running.\n\nFirst, if you want to get into radio, it’s necessary to apply for a broadcasting license with the Federal Communications Commission website. This means filling out all required paperwork. Once your application is approved, you should receive a shortwave radio frequency for broadcasting.\n\nSecond, setting up a radio station costs money. There are many creative sources you can tap into, and you can even self-fund your operations if you have the necessary resources. For many, the expense of setting up will prove daunting, so they will need to offset the startup costs with investors or other sources of funding.\n\nThird, you will need to outfit your station with the necessary equipment. If you have the funds, this part isn’t overly complicated. You should be able to find a shortwave radio setup kit online. When getting your equipment set up, be sure to follow instructions exactly and you shouldn’t encounter any issues.\n\nYou can also create your own shortwave receiver and antennae if you know your way around radio and electronics (DIY isn’t for everyone, but some people love it).\n\nFourth, generating revenue is generally a critical part of sustaining a radio station. The technical term for this would be “business plan,” but for the most part, it’s about figuring out what the format of your broadcasts are going to be, who is going to listen to your broadcasts (target audience), and whether you will have advertisers, community fundraisers, or other initiatives to keep your efforts sustainable.\n\nYou’ll also want to plan the programming and content, whether you’ll primarily be creating it yourself, hiring on-air personalities, outsourcing the content from elsewhere, or a combination of approaches.\n\nWill you be broadcasting music? Then will need to purchase proper licensing. This can generally be done through a Performance Rights Organization. In the States, you would likely go through ASCAP. In the UK, PRS for Music is preeminent.\n\nThis, of course, goes hand in hand with the final step, and that is staffing. Who do you need working at your station? Admin staff, janitors, sales, DJs, on-air personalities, or otherwise? What roles will you be filling, and what roles will others be filling?\n\nWe talked about funding earlier, but if you want to hire people and pay for marketing and advertising (including a website), that’s going to cost something too. As you’re probably starting to see, starting a shortwave radio station doesn’t need to be expensive, but it isn’t cheap either!\n\nShortwave Radio Stations, Final Thoughts\n\nAnd now you know more about shortwave radio than most people ever will.\n\nWe wish you all the best on your journey, whether it’s finding a great shortwave radio, joining and interacting with the community, or even setting up your own station!"
