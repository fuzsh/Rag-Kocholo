S4C's obligations are set out in broadcasting legislation rather than in a licence.\n\nOfcom's regulatory remit in respect of S4C includes duties to:\n\nassess S4C's compliance with quotas agreed by the S4C Authority and Ofcom, including independent production, original production, news and current affairs;\n\nmonitor compliance and consider complaints relating to Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code (which contains rules covering issues such as the protection of under eighteens, fairness and impartiality).\n\nS4C’s public service remit, which is set by statute, is to provide a broad range of high quality and diverse programming with a substantial proportion of programmes in Welsh. The Secretary of State may review how effectively S4C’s public service remit is being fulfilled, in consultation with S4C Authority and the Welsh Government.\n\nS4C\n\nS4C Headquarters\n\nCanolfan S4C Yr Egin\n\nCarmarthen\n\nSA31 3EQ\n\nTelephone: 03305 880456\n\nWebsite: www.s4c.cymru\n\nEmail: gwifren@s4c.cymru\n\nViewers' enquiries and comments"
