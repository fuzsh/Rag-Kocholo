        "text": "Radio station in Okeechobee, Florida\n\nWRMI (Radio Miami International) is a shortwave radio station broadcasting from Okeechobee, Florida, United States. WRMI is a commercial radio station that sells airtime to businesses and organizations.\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nWRMI relays several international news stations including Radio Ukraine International, Radio Slovakia International, Radio Tirana, Radio France International, Famagusta Gazette Radio, Radio Prague, the Italian Broadcasting Corporation, NHK World Radio Japan, Radio Taiwan International, and Radiodifusión Argentina al Exterior, all of which, except for the last, would otherwise be difficult to receive in the Western Hemisphere.[1][2] It also features headline news stories from the Voice of America, several religious programs (particularly those of Brother Stair and Ching Hai), as well as original and syndicated programs.[2][3] According to its 1996 station record from the Federal Communications Commission, WRMI's broadcast target zones were the Caribbean, Central America and South America.[4] In particular, much of its programming was targeted towards Cuba. With the addition of the former WYFR transmitters, WRMI had 14 transmitters with 23 antennas targeting many zones worldwide in 2016.[5] Its broadcasts are also easily received in the United States and Canada. WRMI airs programs in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, Italian, Ukrainian, Russian and Slovak. Since March 2022, WRMI has targeted daily native language programming to Ukraine and Russia regarding the on-going Russian invasion of Ukraine.[6]\n\nWRMI Legends\n\n[edit]\n\nIn November 2022, WRMI added an evening block of personality oldies programming that had previously been aired on WTWW in Lebanon, Tennessee. The block, branded as \"WRMI Legends,\" was forced off WTWW when that station shut down due to a number of factors earlier that month.[7] WRMI Legends has operated on the 5050 kHz frequency, vacated by WWRB following the January 2022 death of its owner, since February 2023. WRMI Legends, like WTWW before it, largely targets a North American and European audience of DXers and Amateur Radio enthusiasts. The WRMI Legends programming block also carries “Ria’s Ham Shack,” an amateur radio focused talk show hosted by Ria Jairam, N2RJ, Sundays at 8PM Central. Jairam’s show was previously broadcast on Saturdays on WTWW.\n\nMighty KBC\n\n[edit]\n\nIn January 2023, WRMI absorbed another block of personality music programming from German/Dutch shortwave broadcaster The Mighty KBC Radio, which was forced to suspend operations due to an energy crisis in Europe.[8]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe station began broadcasting on June 14, 1994, with a 50,000-watt transmitter and two antennas located near Miami, Florida.[4] In December 2013, they purchased the WYFR transmission complex from Family Radio in Okeechobee, Florida.[9] This new facility includes a dozen 100,000-watt transmitters plus two 50,000-watt transmitters and several antennas to cover all parts of the world.[5]\n\nFrequencies\n\n[edit]\n\nWRMI currently, as of April 2024, broadcasts on the following frequencies in the following directions:[10]\n\nBand Frequency\n\n(MHz) Azimuth Intended Audience Hours\n\n(UTC) Notes 16 m 17.79 160° Cuba, the Caribbean and Central America 1500–2100 Used solely for Radio Africa Network 19 m 15.77 44° Europe, the Mediterranean 24/7 31 m 9.955 160° Latin America 2100–0400\n\n1100–1500 Flagship frequency 31 m 9.455 285° Southwestern United States 24/7 31 m 9.395 355° Eastern North America, Western Europe 24/7 41 m 7.78 222° Central America 0000–1100 41 m 7.57 315° North America 2300–0400 49 m 5.95 355° North America 2300–0400 Talk radio format 49 m 5.85 315° Western North America 2200–1300 49 m 5.80 160° Caribbean and Central America 0000–0400 60 m 5.05 160° North America, Cuba, Caribbean 0200–0500 Used exclusively for WRMI Legends oldies programming. 60 m 5.01 181° Cuba, the Caribbean and Central America 0000–0400\n\n1100–1500\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
