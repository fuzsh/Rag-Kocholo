        "text": "International Shortwave Broadcasting:\n\nNearly every country broadcasts on shortwave ( 2.3 - 26.1 MHz ). Many of these countries transmit powerful signals that are some times beamed toward North America. These broadcasts can often be heard on portable shortwave radios. International broadcasters often cover stories not reported in the American media. If you use or are learning another language there are many non-english broadcasts. These signals travel thousands of miles via the upper atmosphere and they may have static, fading or interference. These signals are also affected by the seasons, time of day and solar activity (sunspots etc). Broadcasters often change frequencies, languages and times. Any schedule would soon become out of date. I have never used a \"schedule. In stead, I just tune around the dial and listen to any interesting stations.\n\nThe \"Radio Regulations\" of the International Telecommunications Union define the shortwave broadcast bands. At the 1992 World Administrative Radio Conference, new bands were created and existing bands were expanded. The band limits in the following table reflect the WARC-92 agreements and broadcast band expansions used on a non-interfering basis (e.g., the 41 m band starting at 6890 kHz on a non-interference basis): Although the allocations do not become official until 2007, in practice many stations have already started using the expanded portions under the motto \"use it or lose it.\" Additionally, there are a few stations that broadcast outside the band edges above, e.g., Iran on 9022 and a number of African stations around 9200 kHz. Clearly, receivers with continuous coverage between 1.6 and 30 MHz are preferred.\n\nUsually good only at night.\n\nWhy Shortwave?\n\nDespite the advantages of the \"new\" technologies such as the Internet, satellites, Facebook, Ipods, etc., they can all be blocked and censored by countries who wish to do so -- and they frequently do so.\n\nShortwave radio, on the other hand, is the only medium of communication which can reach across borders -- and around the world -- without the need for permission from governmental authorities. Shortwave is the only medium of truly person-to-person international communication which cannot be stopped at national borders.\n\nWhen crises occur in any country -- earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, wars and political upheavals, to mention a few -- people rely on shortwave radio to transmit news and information.\n\nAnd outside of times of crisis, listeners rely on shortwave stations to provide them with a wide variety of alternative programming that is not available on their local and national media.\n\nA good list of short-wave stations. https://www.short-wave.info\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 APR 2024 Update:\n\nStarts around 5 PM -8 PM Hawaii Standard Time: 17.675 AM English Language.

AM and International broadcaster's transmit a carrier with two sidebands [ lower / carrier / upper ]. Both sidebands have the same information therefore redundant. Shortwave frequencies use single sideband modulation ( SSB ). SSB removes the carrier and one sideband, only one sideband is transmitted. The advantage of SSB is a narrower more powerful signal. Disadvantages: SSB signals are harder to tune, when mistuned they sound \"quacky\" and when the talking stops the entire signal disappears. Almost all signals on shortwave are upper sideband ( USB ).\n\nIt takes a better and more costly receiver to correctly copy SSB signals. If you purchase a shortwave radio I recommend it be capable of receiving SSB signals. Practice listening to USB signals by tuning to amateur radio operators ( Hams ) between 14.150 - 14.350 MHz. When you hear a signal slowly tune back and forth until the voice sounds normal. ( Read the radio owner's manual ).\n\nThe frequencies listed are the suppressed carrier, which is not transmitted. The actual USB signal will be centered about 1.4 KHz higher or lower sideband ( LSB ) signals will be centered about 1.4KHz lower.\n\nSECURE ( State Emergency Communications Using Radio Effectively ) is a secondary emergency back-up communications network. Each state in the network may operate base and mobile stations, transmitting in USB voice, data and maybe morse code. I do not know of any scheduled drills or net operations. Suggest monitoring the interstate coordination frequency 2.326 MHz.\n\nSECURE; Listed by states ( 33 states in network )\n\nAL 2.326 2.487 5.135 5.192 7.805 7.935\n\nCA 2.326 2.419 2.422 2.804 2.812 5.140 5.195 7.480 7.802 7.805\n\nCO 2.326 2.466 2.471 2.274 5.135 7.802 7.805\n\nCT 2.326 2.419 5.135 5.192 7.477 7.805\n\nFL 2.326 2.439 2.463 5.140 7.805 7.932\n\nID 2.326 2.414 2.471 2.535 2.804 5.135 5.140 5.195 7.477 7.805 7.932\n\nIL 2.326 2.414 2.569 2.804 5.135 5.140 5.192 7.480 7.802 7.932 7.935\n\nIN 2.326 2.487 2.511 5.135 5.140 7.802 7.805 7.935\n\nLO 2.326 2.812 5.192 7.477 7.480 7.805\n\nME 2.326 2.414 5.135 5.192 7.805\n\nMA 2.326 2.411 2.414 2.419 5.135 5.192 7.447 7.805\n\nMI 2.326 2.414 2.804 5.140 7.477 7.805\n\nMS 2.326 2.535 2.569 5.195 7.477 7.805\n\nMO 2.326 2.411 2.414 2.419 2.439 2.463 5.140 5.192 7.477 7.802 7.805 7.935\n\nMT 2.326 2.804 2.812 7.477 7.480 7.805\n\nNE 2.326 2.804 2.812 5.192 7.805 7.935\n\nNV 2.326 2.487 2.511 5.195 7.480 7.805 7.932\n\nNH 2.326 2.414 5.135 5.192 7.805\n\nNJ 2.326 2.411 2.587 5.195 7.805\n\nNM 2.801 2.804 5.135 5.140 7.477 7.480 7.805\n\nNY 2.326 2.812 5.135 7.477\n\nNC 2.326 2.411 5.135 7.477 7.935\n\nOH 2.326 2.419 2.422\n\nOK 2.801 2.804 5.135 5.140 7.477 7.480 7.805\n\nOR 2.326 2.414 2.801 5.135 5.195 7.480 7.802 7.805 7.935\n\nRI 2.326 2.411 2.419 5.135 5.192 7.477 7.805\n\nSC 2.326 2.422 2.511 5.135 7.480 7.932\n\nTN 2.326 2.419 2.474 5.135 5.140 5.195 7.480 7.805 7.932\n\nTX 2.326 2.419 2.422 2.587 2.801 2.804 2.812 5.140 5.192 5.195 7.802 7.805 7.932 7.935\n\nVT 2.326 2.411 2.419 5.135 5.192 7.477 7.805\n\nVA 2.326 2.411 2.463 2.511 2.587 2.801 2.812 5.140 5.192 5.195 7.805\n\nWA 2.326 2.411 2.414 2.587 2.801 5.192 7.805 7.935\n\nWY 2.326 2.414 2.419 5.195 7.805 7.932\n\nSECURE: Listed by frequency\n\n2.326 INTERSTATE COORDINATION FREQUENCY ONLY\n\n2.411 MA MO NJ NC RI VT VA WA\n\n2.414 ID IL ME MA MI MO NH OR WA WY\n\n2.419 CA CT MA MO OH RI TN TX VT WY\n\n2.422 CA OH SC TX\n\n2.439 FL MO\n\n2.463 FL MO VA\n\n2.466 CO\n\n2.471 CO ID\n\n2.474 AL CO TN\n\n2.487 AL IN NV\n\n2.511 IN NV SC VA\n\n2.535 ID MS\n\n2.569 IL MS\n\n2.587 NJ TX VA WA\n\n2.801 NM OK OR TX VA WA\n\n2.804 CA ID IL MI MT NE NM OK TX\n\n2.812 CA LA MT NE NY TX VA\n\n5.135 INTERSTATE COORDINATION FREQUENCY ONLY (ALTERNATE)\n\n5.140 CA FL ID IL IN MI MO NM OK TN TX VA\n\n5.192 INTERSTATE COORDINATION FREQUENCY ONLY\n\n5.195 CA ID MA MS NV NJ OR TN TX VA WY\n\n7.477 CT ID LA MA MI MS MO MT NM NY NC OK RI VT\n\n7.480 CA IL LA MT NV NM OK OR SC TN\n\n7.802 CA CO IL IN MO OR TX (DAY ONLY)\n\n7.805 INTERSTATE COORDINATION FREQUENCY ONLY\n\n7.932 FL ID IL NV SC TN TX WY\n\n7.935 AL IL IN MO NE NC OR TX WA (DAY ONLY)\n\nSECURE locations and frequencies obtained from the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) database.\n\nWeb Shortware Receivers\n\nN2JEU | DX Zone List of Receivers | Global Tuners | Virginia Turner\n\nListeners on three continents lament BBC World Service cutbacks\n\nEnd of five foreign language services and shortwave will cut off more than 30 million listeners, a sixth of its global audience\n\nhttp://forums2.qrz.com/showthread.php?282712-The-End-of-the-BBC-World-Service\n\nhttp://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/28/bbc-world-service-cuts-response\n\nThe axing of five foreign language services and wholesale retreat from shortwave radio – including the end of broadcasts to India, Russia and China – will lead to the loss of more than 30 million listeners, a sixth of the World Service's global audience of 180 million, the BBC estimates. The five language services being shut down – Portuguese for Africa, Caribbean English, Macedonian, Serbian and Albanian – have a combined audience of 3.4 million.\n\nThe changes mean the World Service is likely to be overtaken by the Voice of America, established in 1942 and funded by the US government, as the world's leading global news broadcaster. The World Service's former managing director, Sir John Tusa, said its rival had \"always been regarded as a vastly inferior international broadcaster\".\n\nSome Basic Rules of Thumb"
