WRITER\n\nThe new zero tolerance policy\n\nwas enacted this year in attempt\n\nto keep dorm residents and others\n\nfrom using or marketing illegal\n\ndrugs.\n\nThis policy was put into place\n\nby Campus Living in an attempt\n\nto keep the campus, its residents\n\nand students safe.\n\nMaggie Olszewska, assistant\n\ndirector for the Office of Student\n\nConflict Resolution, said the\n\npolicy is a much needed one and\n\nserves an important purpose.\n\n\"The policy states that if any-\n\nbody uses illegal drugs or .even\n\nhas drugs or drug paraphernalia\n\neither on their person or in their\n\nroom, they will have their con-\n\ntract with housing cancelled\n\nsaid Olszewska.\n\nOlszewska said even though a\n\nstudent may not be the one using\n\nthe drugs, if the student is in the\n\nroom or around someone who\n\nhas drugs, the student would be\n\nheld responsible.\n\nOlszewska said the problem\n\nof drugs and substance abuse\n\nhas always been an issue, but\n\nit's one that has been growing\n\nover time.\n\n\"I think, nationally, there\n\nis so much more talk about\n\ndrugs and how they impact stu-\n\ndents and living communities\n\nOlszewska said.\n\n\"The option was always\n\nthere, but now it's been made\n\na mandate\n\nCampus Living has taken sev-\n\neral actions to inform students of\n\nthe new policy.\n\nWhen students moved into\n\nthe dorms, they were required\n\nto sign a piece of paper indicat-\n\ning they are aware of the policy.\n\nPosters and fliers have beeh\n\nplaced around campus and in\n\nresidence halls in order to keep\n\npeople

with\n\nadministration\n\nMICHAEL HARRINGTON\n\nSTAFF WRITER\n\nECU associate professor James\n\nToppen was denied tenure arous-\n\ning emotions among several of\n\nhis students in the industrial\n\ndistribution program.\n\nToppen, who teaches courses\n\nin industrial distribution and\n\nlogistics, a branch of the indus-\n\ntrial technology department, was\n\nnot approved by the committee\n\nreviewing his application, which\n\nangered several of his students,\n\nprompting them to protest the\n\nuniversity's decision.\n\nThe students were granted a\n\nforum where industrial technol-\n\nogy department chairperson,\n\nPaul Kauffmann, spoke with\n\nthe students about the denial of\n\ntenure.\n\nRyan Williams, president of\n\nthe professional association of\n\nindustrial distribution and a stu-\n\ndent of Toppen, said the forum\n\nwas attended by about 75 to 80\n\nstudents.\n\nWilliams said he thought the\n\nforum would be an opportunity\n\nfor the students to voice their\n\nconcerns over the tenure issue.\n\nIt was instead an explanation on\n\nhow the process of tenure works\n\nand why Toppen was not receiv-\n\ning tenure.\n\n\"Dr. Kauffmann just\n\nexplained the tenure process to\n\nus said Williams.\n\n\"He was very vague and\n\nwasn't too concerned with our\n\nfeelings he just kept referring\n\nus to the faculty manual\n\nToppen said he failed to\n\nreceive tenure because he did\n\nnot publish a sufficient number\n\nof articles in journals specifically\n\nrelating to his department, which\n\nsuggests his research and creative\n\nactivities were not deemed suf-\n\nficient by the committee.\n\n\"I started the industrial distri-\n\nbution program seven years ago\n\nwhen there were nine students\n\nand it was only a concentration\n\nwith one unique course said\n\nToppen.\n\n\"Now there are 180 students\n\nand 12 unique courses\n\nToppen said he has been\n\ninvolved in building every course\n\nin the program, which placed 97\n\npercent of its graduates in jobs\n\nlast year.\n\nDare Spurling, senior indus-\n\ntrial distribution major, said the\n\nindustrial distribution program is\n\nlike a family because of Toppen's\n\ncaring and compassionate teach-\n\ning style.\n\n\"This is his major, the pro-\n\ngram is going to lose a lot of\n\nstudents said Spurling.\n\nDue to his being denied\n\ntenure, Toppen will have one\n\nmore year before his employment\n\nat ECU will end.\n\nAccording to the ECU faculty\n\nmanual, tenure ensures academic\n\nfreedom by allowing faculty\n\nmembers to express unpopular\n\npoints of view by protecting\n\nthem from involuntary suspen-\n\nsion or discharge. Once tenured,\n\nthe only grounds for dismissal are\n\nincompetence, neglect of duty or\n\nmisconduct of such a nature as to\n\nindicate the individual is unfit to\n\ncontinue.\n\nTo become tenured at ECU,\n\na professor must be approved by\n\na committee that includes three\n\ntenured faculty members, the\n\nchairperson of the department\n\nand the dean.\n\nThe faculty manual states\n\nthat approval hinges on the\n\napplicant's demonstrated profes-\n\nsional competence, research and\n\ncreative activity and service, as\n\nwell as a potential for future con-\n\ntributions and the institution's\n\nneeds and resources. It notes\n\nthat teaching is the first consid-\n\neration.\n\nBoth Spurling and Williams\n\nsuggested the underlying cause\n\nfor the denial of tenure was\n\npreexisting animosity between\n\nKauffmann and Toppen.\n\n\"Toppen and the department\n\nchair had conflicts Spurling\n\nsaid.\n\nKauffman said by e-mail\n\nhe is not allowed to comment\n\non a specific tenure case, but\n\nhe did note that tenure is an\n\nunbiased process.\n\n\"Tenure is a fair and balanced\n\nsystem that individuals choose to\n\npursue said Kauffmann.\n\n\"There are no surprises in it,\n\nand the expectations are clear\n\nand known\n\nSpurling and Williams\n\nsaid students and parents\n\nare writing letters to the vice\n\nchancellor, who is in charge\n\nof appeals in tenure decisions,\n\nin hopes the decision will\n\nbe reversed.\n\nThis write can be contacted at\n\nnews@theeastcarolinian.com.\n\nINSIDE News: A2 I Comics: A9 I Opinion: A4 I A & E: A5 I Sports: A7\n\nPage A2 news@theeastcarolinian. com 252. 328. 6366\n\nNICK HENNE News Editor KRISTIN DAY Assistant News Editor\n\nWEDNESDAY October 27, 2004\n\nCampus News\n\nVOTE\n\nOne-stop earty voting takes place\n\nuntil Oct. 30 at the Elections\n\nAnnex located at 1800 N.

They were not allowed\n\nin the camp but registered at the\n\ngate, and several dozen families\n\nstayed nearby all day, waiting\n\nfor news.\n\nAuthorities announced a\n\ncurfew in parts of Narathiwat\n\n\"because the situation is still\n\nvolatile Thaksin said.\n\nNeighboring Malaysia, a\n\nMuslim-dominated country,\n\nexpressed concern over the\n\ncrackdown.\n\n\"Thailand is a close neighbor.\n\nAny incident will be watched\n\nclosely here.

UNGERFELT Editor In Chief\n\nWEDNESDAY October 27, 2004\n\nOur View\n\n\"Research the candidates and chose the\n\none whose issues most directly agree with\n\nyours\n\nThis phrase has been printed in so many \"Our\n\nView\" columns, it's almost become redundant\n\nHowever, TEC feels that with election day less\n\nthan a week away, it's important we stress it\n\nagain.\n\nHowever, instead of merely emphasizing that\n\nyou decide on your own, we have taken into\n\nconsideration many students are quick to\n\nlisten to false information passed on to them\n\nfrom friends and family, rather than make their\n\ndecisions for themselves.\n\nRecognizing a student's busy class and social\n\nschedule, TEC has compiled a quick list of key\n\nissues for George Bush and John Kerry. It is\n\nour hope that you can take a few minutes out\n\nof your day to read this list and decide if the\n\ncandidate you plan on voting for is truly the\n\nman you want to be our next president.\n\nWithout further ado, here is the list:\n\nGeneral Information: Bush is a Republican,\n\nwhile Kerry is a Democrat. Both have held\n\nelected offices and both served in the military.\n\nAbortion: Bush strongly favors appointing\n\njudges who will outlaw abortions, outlawing\n\n\"partial birth\" abortions, outlawing abortions\n\nexcept in cases of rapeincest and requiring\n\nparental notification for minors under 18. Kerry\n\nstrongly opposes the above four abortion\n\nissues.\n\nGay Rights: Bush strongly favors the con-\n\nstitutional gay marriage ban and is strongly\n\nopposed to allowing gays to openly serve\n\nin the military. Kerry somewhat opposes the\n\nconstitutional gay marriage ban and strongly\n\nfavors allowing gays to serve in the military.\n\nGun Control: Kerry strongly favors back-\n\nground checks on gun show purchases, while\n\nBush is somewhat opposed to the issue.\n\nDeath Penalty: Both candidates strongly\n\noppose abolishing the death penalty, with\n\nKerry favoring a national review of death\n\npenalty fairness (Bush is strongly opposed\n\nto the issue).\n\nIraq: Kerry somewhat opposes the war In\n\nIraq, with Bush strongly favoring the war. Both\n\ncandidates strongly oppose the immediate\n\nwithdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq.\n\nInformation obtained from presidentmatch.\n\ncom.

I was feeling a\n\nlittle jealous about a week ago.\n\nIt all started after 1 read Peter Kal-\n\najian's opinion about the Confederate\n\nFlag. Since 1 read this particular piece\n\non T�C's Web site, 1 couldn't help but\n\nnotice the number of responses that\n\nhad been posted in regards to Peter's\n\nopinion - at my last count, there were\n\n117.\n\nI clicked on some of my past opin-\n\nions and articles and counted only a\n\nhandful of responses directed toward\n\nme. I savored the reading of each\n\none - it felt like opening gifts on Christ-\n\nmas morning. I know that sounds\n\ncliche, but it's so exciting to get feedback\n\nfrom people who have read your\n\nthoughts and words. It is just that little\n\nreassurance that you aren't sending\n\nyour journalistic endeavors out into a\n\nblack hole. Someone is actually read-\n\ning what you have written and they\n\nfeel moved enough by it to let you\n\nknow.\n\nOne of my roommates loyally\n\ntacks a clipping of my column to the\n\nrefrigerator each week and my parents\n\nregularly send me accolades via e-mail.\n\nSure, it's nice to have their encourage-\n\nment, but she's my friend and they're\n\nmy parents. Isn't supporting me part of\n\nthe job description?\n\nWhen 1 compared the number of\n\nresponses I had received with those\n\nsent to Peter, Tony McKee or Eric\n\nGilmore, I felt like I was losing a\n\ncompetition I had never intended to\n\nenter. It made me wonder if anyone,\n\nbesides the five or so respondents and\n\nmy close friends and family, is reading\n\nmy words.\n\nOf course 1 don't write these pieces\n\nfor any potential fame or praise from\n\nothers. I write them only because I\n\nwant to write. It's what I like to do and\n\nI'm fortunate that someone has given\n\nme the opportunity to publish what I\n\nproduce each week.\n\nYet I still hope when I see someone\n\npick up a copy of TEC, they will turn to\n\nthe opinion page, read my words and\n\nthink about what I've said. Maybe it\n\nwill mean something to them. I hope\n\nit will entertain them, cause them to\n\nreflect on an idea or simply allow them\n\nto take a break from their hectic life and\n\nspend a few minutes with something\n\nless stressful.\n\nEven if they read it, it's doubtful\n\nthey will post any online feedback just\n\nto say how they relate to my sentiments.\n\nWhen 1 don't write anything especially\n\ncontroversial 1 guess I can't expect to\n\nget a response.\n\nIt's true of editorial pieces and it's\n\ntrue of life. So often, people are quick\n\nto respond to the negative. Inflamma-\n\ntory opinions get reactions, just as bad\n\nservice in a restaurant or store does. A\n\ncustomer is much more likely to com-\n\nplain about a bad employee than to\n\npraise one who did a good job. Unlike\n\npoor service, these controversial opin-\n\nions do have their place - I'm just not\n\none to write them.\n\nIssues are rarely black or white\n\n- there is just too much gray area\n\nthat can't be ignored. Depending on\n\nyour background, your station in life\n\nor any number of experiences you've\n\nhad, your opinion will differ ever so\n\nslightly or significantly from mine.\n\nRecognizing this, I just don't want to\n\nrock the boat and tell you that you're\n\nwrong and I'm right. After all, that may\n\nnot be true.\n\nHowever, because I'm not doing\n\nthat in this particular column or any\n\nother I have written or probably will\n\nwrite, I don't expect that you'll respond\n\nto me on the newspaper's Web site. Still,\n\nI long for the day when I see a long list\n\nof messages in regards to something I\n\nhave authored.\n\nUntil then, I am reminded of\n\nanother old familiar cliche that says\n\nsomething about the squeaky wheel\n\ngetting the grease. It may not be fair\n\nand it certainly is frustrating but it's\n\ndefinitely applicable.\n\nEven so, I have a challenge for\n\nany of the five or ten people that read\n\nthis. I'm not begging you to post any\n\nfeedback - I'm just asking that in your\n\nown life, you make a concerted effort\n\nto affirm others at least as much as\n\nsociety seems to put them down. It\n\nmay be harder to do and take some\n\nserious effort but I'm encouraging you\n\nto do something which I am working\n\non myself. Besides, I think we're all up\n\nto the challenge.\n\nIn My Opinion\n\nStatistics don't tell whole story of voters\n\n(KRT) � Something might be hard\n\nto find at voting booths Nov. 2. Hang-\n\ning chads, perhaps?\n\nIt may be young Asian Americans.\n\nAsian Americans between the ages\n\nof 18 and 24 have the lowest rate of\n\nvoter registration among minority\n\ngroups in the nation, according to\n\nAsian St Pacific Islander American Vote\n\n2004. APIA Vote 2004 (www.apiavote.\n\norg) is a national coalition of nonpar-\n\ntisan, nonprofit groups that work to\n\nengage more in the Asian and Pacific\n\nIslander communities into the politi-\n\ncal process.\n\nMoreover, only 34 percent of young\n\nAsian-American citizens voted in the\n\n2000 presidential election, accord-\n\ning to The Center for Information\n\nand Research on Civic Learning and\n\nEngagement. Do Asian Americans ste-\n\nreotypically only care about academics\n\nand the perfect job?\n\nNot from my experience.\n\nDon't let such statistics fool you\n\ninto thinking that young Asian Ameri-\n\ncans are politically apathetic.\n\nMost of my Asian-American friends\n\nplan to vote. And if the University of\n\nWashington campus is any microcos-\n\nmic indicator of the state at large, then\n\nyoung Asian Americans care about\n\nthe political process and the issues at\n\nstake.\n\nThey speak out in student senate\n\nmeetings and hold elected positions.\n\nOutside of school, they're active in civil\n\nrights and cultural organizations.\n\nAnd once they do register to vote,\n\nmany actually act to make change.\n\nYoung Asian Americans had a higher\n\nvoter turnout than any other minority\n\ngroup in the 2000 presidential election,\n\naccording to APIA Vote 2004.\n\nOf course, like the general youth\n\npopulation, the attitude toward voting\n\nranges among some young Asian\n\nAmericans who I informally polled.\n\nSome have been thinking about their\n\ncandidates of choice for months; some\n\ndon't even know how to register; many\n\ndon't care.\n\nYoung Asian Americans aren't a\n\nhomogenous group of apathetic non-\n\nvoters.\n\nSo, how do you explain the sta-\n\ntistics? Many factors need to be con-\n\nsidered. First, many Asian Americans\n\nsimply aren't eligible to vote. Accord-\n\ning to APIA Vote 2004, two-thirds of\n\nAsian Americans are foreign born. In\n\nWashington state, there are 453,000\n\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders,\n\nbut only one-third of them are eligible\n\nto vote.\n\nSecondly, past family experiences\n\nmay have led others to distrust the\n\npolitical system in general. According\n\nto some academics, many immigrants\n\ncame to the United States to flee politi-\n\ncal persecution at home. Young people\n\nwho grew up in such households might\n\nhold a more skeptical perspective on\n\nthe political system.\n\nAnd others might have grown up\n\nin households where politics never\n\nentered everyday conversation.\n\nOf course, there's no excuse for\n\na low percentage of registered voters\n\namong citizens. Especially not when,\n\naccording to the 2000 Census, Asian\n\nAmericans make up 5.5 percent of the\n\nstate population. That's 2 percent more\n\nthan the national averagev And the\n\nnumbers are rising.\n\nPrecious political influence is being\n\nwasted without voter registration and\n\nactual voting.\n\nBut these numbers shouldn't lead\n\none to assume that all young Asian\n\nAmericans are politically apathetic.\n\nThe sheer fact that some young\n\nAsian Americans are trying to change\n\nthese numbers reveals their concern\n\nand investment in civic participation.\n\nYes, the numbers need to rise, but\n\none shouldn't be too quick to assume\n\nthat all young Asian Americans don't\n\ncare.\n\nPirate Rant\n\nWhat's with the tiny shorts\n\nand the oversized hoodies?\n\nWhat are you, confused or some-\n\nthing?\n\n\"Intro, to Physics\" means that\n\nexactly.

Duh, you are\n\ngonna have to change anyway.\n\nLet's get this straight right\n\nnow: There are no dorms on\n\nECU'S campus. There are only\n\nresidence halls. So If you are\n\ngoing to talk about them use the\n\ncorrect terminology. A dorm is a\n\nplace where someone sleeps and\n\na residence hall is a place where\n\nstudents live, learn, grow and\n\nbuild bonds through student\n\ninteraction.\n\nTo the person who felt it was\n\nnecessary to inform us on how\n\nmany soldiers died last week in\n\nIraq, I thought you'd like to know\n\nthey died in honor. With their\n\nown will, they signed up ready\n\nto fight for this country and to\n\nhelp other countries in times of\n\ndesperate need. Think about all\n\nthe men who died years ago, and\n\nlook at what you have!

It is\n\nnatural to enjoy a good scare once\n\nin awhile, what horror movies\n\nencourage is the greatest fright.\n\nDuring Halloween, horror\n\nmovies are particularly appeal-\n\ning for individuals seeking quick\n\nthrills. Within the genre, different\n\ntypes of films are made in order to\n\nappeal to the widest audience pos-\n\nsible. Horror can have elements of\n\nsuspense in them, such as Se7en,\n\nor science fiction, like Alien.\n\nRanging from slasher themes to\n\nmonster themes, scary movies\n\nreach a diverse range of tastes.\n\nJosh Parker, a freshman politi-\n\ncal science major, finds horror\n\nmovies to be rather fascinating.\n\n\"I enjoy movies such as Friday\n\nthe 13th, that had realistic ele-\n\nments. It marked the re-birth of\n\nhorror movies said Parker.\n\nMovies such as Friday the 13th\n\ncame on the scene thanks to the\n\npopularity of the 1978 horror\n\nclassic Halloween. The plot was\n\nsimple: masked killer goes after\n\npromiscuous teens. The budget\n\nwas small and the acting was\n\nmediocre, but audiences flocked\n\nto see this new film. Made on\n\nless than $325,000, Halloween\n\nwent on to gross $47 million in\n\nthe United States. With this new\n\ndemand, studios began turning\n\nout horror movies in mass.\n\nNot since the 1920s and 1930s\n\nhave horror movies enjoyed\n\nsuch popularity. Even today,\n\nfilms such as Nosferatu and Bride\n\nof Frankenstein are considered\n\nclassics and are watched and\n\nrespected today.\n\nSince the first horror film\n\nLe Manoir Du Diable was made\n\nin 1896, scary movies have\n\nremained a staple on cinema. It\n\nwas during the 1960s that master\n\nstoryteller and legendary film\n\ndirector Alfred Hitchcock offered\n\na new type of film. Suspenseful\n\nand thrilling, Hitchcock's films\n\nwere a precursor to the slasher\n\nfilms of the late 1970s. Psycho\n\nleft a generation of women fear-\n\ning the shower and is considered\n\nto be one of the greatest horror\n\nfilms.\n\nMovies such as Psycho opened\n\ndoors for movies that put less\n\nemphasis on blood and gore and\n\nrelied on intelligent suspense to\n\nmove the film. Thrillers such\n\nas Silence of the Lambs and Jaws\n\nhave gone on to acquire critical\n\nacclaim and box office success.\n\nThey offer an alternative for the\n\nsqueamish, who may prefer sus-\n\npenseful scares to gory B-movies.\n\n\"I prefer M. Night Shyamalan\n\nthrillers like Signs. They don't\n\nhave a high body count, but still\n\nbuild up a lot of scares said\n\nfreshman musical theatre major\n\nAmina Edmonson.\n\nThe success of these films\n\nshow a new demand for what\n\nhorror audiences want. A well-\n\nthought script that still provides\n\nscares will leave a lasting impres-\n\nsion on audiences and critics.\n\nContrasting to the earlier\n\nhorror films, many movies now\n\nhave large budgets and use the\n\nlatest special effects.\n\n\"Movies like John Carpen-\n\nter's The Thing have great special\n\neffects and a good story Parker\n\nsaid.\n\nMovies such as The Exorcist\n\nused great effects and an inter-\n\nesting screenplay to make one of\n\nthe highest grossing movies of\n\nall time. Based on a true story,\n\nThe Exorcist made $292.7 million\n\nand earned 10 Oscar nomina-\n\nHalloween specials you\n\ndon't want to miss\n\nBone chilling\n\nmovie line up\n\nDANIELLE WIGGINS\n\nSTAFF WRITER\n\nFright fest, costumes, pump-\n\nkins, candy, ghost and goblins,\n\nall words that lead straight to the\n\nevent we all are looking forward\n\nto this weekend. How do we\n\nprepare to get into the mood of\n\nthis spooky season? Everyone is\n\naccustomed to a little television\n\nand viewers highly anticipate the\n\nHalloween specials that appear\n\nthroughout various channels.\n\n\"Ratings for viewers are\n\nhigh throughout this week for\n\nmovies and previewed Halloween\n\nshows said Lori Scott, research\n\nand advertising for Cox Com-\n\nmunications.\n\nIt is the perfect time of the\n\nyear to microwave some popcorn,\n\nturn off all the lights and enjoy a\n\nfew horror flicks. We have a list\n\nof horror movies that air from\n\nTuesday, Oct. 26 until the event\n\nfinale on Sunday, Oct. 31.\n\nAlthough, the most antici-\n\npated \"Simpson's Halloween\n\nSpecial\" is delayed a week on\n\nSunday, Nov. 7, Fox will air the\n\nmovie version of The X-Files.\n\nAMC, channel 51 is hosting a\n\n\"Monster Fest a week filled with\n\ntop horror films like, Amityville\n\nHorrors, Halloween IV and V,\n\nScream II and The Omen.\n\nIf you are interested in reality\n\nshows, turn to channel 70, The\n\nTravel Channel, where you can\n\nwatch \"America's Most Haunted\n\nPlaces and other ghostly adven-\n\ntures of real life encounters with\n\nthe supernatural.\n\n\"Nights leading into Hal-\n\nloween usually promote the cel-\n\nebrated event Scott said.\n\nIf you so happen to be stuck\n\non Halloween night with noth-\n\ning to do, \"highly unlikely in\n\nGreenville just know you can\n\nreach for the remote, turn to your\n\ntelevision listings and eventually\n\nfind something waiting for you\n\nto watch.\n\nStarting on Tuesday, Oct. 26,\n\nAmityville Horror shows on AMC,\n\nimmediately following that, Hal-\n\nloween IV at 8 p.m. and Halloween\n\nV at 10 p.m. If you would prefer\n\nsomething a little new, turn to\n\nchannel 66 where they are play-\n\ning, Still Know What You Did\n\nsee SPECIALS page A6\n\ntions. It sparked a new interest\n\nin the paranormal influenced\n\nmovies such as The Omen. These\n\nmovies proved that horror isn't\n\njust limited to high death counts\n\nand killing people off in creative\n\nways.\n\nUnfortunately, many of these\n\nsmart and original films are\n\ntarnished by the multitude of\n\nsequels looking to cash-out by\n\nusing the name and success of\n\nthe original. Great movies such\n\nas Halloween have spawned seven\n\nsequels. Friday the 13th used their\n\nkiller Jason in 10 movies after\n\nthe original came out in 1980.\n\nPerhaps this cheapening mass\n\nmarket effect can explain why\n\nthe majority of critics abhor the\n\nhorror genre.\n\nWhen A Nightmare on Elm\n\nStreet came out, it was hailed\n\nas a creative and ingenious\n\nfilm. With the success of the\n\nfirst, came an additional six\n\nwithin the next 10 years. The\n\nfranchise grossed $188,884,750\n\nin the United States alone.\n\nWhile it can be said that\n\nmany of these films are poorly\n\nput together, you can't deny the\n\nsuccess. So popular are horror\n\nmovies, that they proved to be\n\ninspiration for spoof blockbusters\n\nsuch as Scary Movie.\n\n\"Most people are familiar\n\nwith the formula horror movies\n\nprovide, even if they don't watch\n\nthem, that they can understand\n\nmany of the jokes Scary Movie\n\nhas says senior geography major\n\nChad Joyner.\n\nWith Halloween approaching\n\nfast, people will be looking to\n\nhorror movies to make the most\n\nof this frightening time of year.\n\nWhether you choose to rent your\n\nfavorite zombie movie or go to\n\nthe theater to experience what\n\nhorror has to offer, the height-\n\nened atmosphere of Halloween\n\nis sure to make for a frightening\n\nexperience.\n\nThis writer can be contacted at\n\nfeatures@theeastcarolinian.com.\n\nMisery\n\nTHE\n\nEXORCIST\n\nJohn rftv\n\nIndependent horror film makes a debut in Greenville\n\n'Malevolence' movie\n\ncoming to Greenville\n\nHorror movie will make\n\naudiences scream\n\nAMANDA WINAR\n\nSTAFF WRITER\n\nWith Halloween just days\n\naway, television stations start\n\nflooding the channels with the\n\ntypical \"scary Freddy\" reruns to\n\nput you in the ghoulish spirit.\n\nMany of you will also get in\n\nyour cars late at night to drive\n\npast the abandoned houses,\n\nsearch through a haunted house\n\nor even take your chances in a\n\ncemetery.\n\nIf you are still looking for\n\nsomething to \"really scare you\"\n\nthough, you should head over to\n\nthe Carmike 12 off of Fire Tower\n\nRoad to see the independent film\n\ntitled Malevolence.\n\nOnly playing in select cities,\n\nMalevolence is a film that brings\n\nback the \"classic horror\" found\n\nIn your other- loved horror films.\n\nMalevolence was written, directed,\n\nproduced and budgeted by Stevan\n\nMena and was shot in Pennsyl-\n\nvania woods in 2002.

Annie Wiikes\n\ncomes along, recognizes him as\n\nPaul and rescues him. She takes\n\nhim to her home nearby in the\n\nwilderness. Paul wakes up days\n\nlater in an unfamiliar house. He\n\ndiscovers his legs have been shat-\n\ntered from the accident. Annie\n\nWiikes introduces herself as\n\nPaul's number one fan, and also\n\nstates that she is a nurse who is\n\ntaking care of him. At first, Paul\n\nis very grateful to her for saving\n\nhis life and for her help.\n\nBut, when Annie discovers, by\n\nreading Paul's manuscripts, that\n\nhe is going to kill off her favorite\n\ncharacter, Misery from his books,\n\nAnnie forcefully demands that Paul\n\nrewrite his manuscripts in order\n\nto have Misery live. Annie turns\n\ninto a manipulative, psychotic\n\nlunatic. She keeps Paul impris-\n\noned in her house by keeping him\n\nrestrained and by use of torture.\n\nThis novel is slow and may be\n\npsychologically draining, but it\n\nhits readers with the vivid descrip-\n\ntions of the violence, the writing\n\nstyle and the several large themes\n\nthat are implied in the story. The\n\nnovel gives the sense of isolation\n\nand desperation because it only\n\nhas two characters placed in a\n\nhouse in the middle of a harsh\n\nwinter wilderness. Readers can feel\n\nthe sheer terror from Paul because\n\nthey are taken into the very\n\nthoughts and dreams of his mind.\n\nIt has a very chilling effect.\n\nNot for the light- hearted.

Last year, The Ring,\n\nTexas Chainsaw Massacre, and\n\nzombie films, such as 28 Days\n\nLater, kept us on the edge of our\n\nseats. The Grudge looks like it will\n\nfill the shoes of last year's scary\n\nmovie bunch.\n\nThe Grudge, which opened\n\nFriday, Oct. 22, was directed by a\n\nJapanese director named Takashi\n\nShimizu. Shimizu was also the\n\ndirector of the original Japanese\n\nversion, IV-ON: the Grudge, and\n\ndecided to make an English lan-\n\nguage version. It was written by\n\nStephen Susco and Sam Raimi.\n\n\"Original 'JU-ON' director,\n\nShimizu, helms this remake,\n\nwhich looks slick, mysterious,\n\nand terrifying said Ryan Kelley,\n\na movie reviewer from About,\n\ncom, who also gave the movie\n\nfour stars.

Foster, who missed\n\nhis entire rookie season with a\n\nknee injury before becoming an\n\noutstanding backup to Stephen\n\nDavis last year, was placed on\n\ninjured reserve. The Panthers are\n\ncritically short at running back.\n\nDavis missed his fourth game of\n\nthe season Sunday with a knee\n\ninjury and No. 3 back Rod Smart is\n\nalso out with a knee problem.\n\nFullback Brad Hoover started\n\nSunday against San Diego,\n\nrunning for 99 yards on a career-\n\ntying 24 carries. Fox said the\n\nPanthers expected to fill Foster's\n\nspot on the roster with another\n\nrunning back. The team has\n\nworked out several veteran backs,\n\nIncluding Skip Hicks and Stacey\n\nMack. Carolina (1-5) has been\n\ndecimated by injuries this season.\n\nAside from the running backs,\n\nwide receiver Steve Smith is\n\nout with a broken leg, All-Pro\n\ndefensive tackle Kris Jenkins is\n\nout with a shoulder injury and\n\nlinebacker Mark Fields missed\n\ntwo games with back spasms.\n\nBears pass on Couch\n\nThe Chicago Bears will not sign\n\nTim Couch, instead deciding.to\n\nstick with the three quarterbacks\n\non their roster. Couch, the top\n\noverall pick in the 1999 draft, had\n\na tryout on Friday and Saturday\n\nwith the Bears, who are 1-5 and\n\nhave lost starting quarterback\n\nRex Grossman for the season.\n\nHe was cut this year by both\n\nCleveland, for whom he played\n\nfor five seasons, and by Green\n\nBay. He had been bothered by\n\na sore arm. Jonathan Quinn and\n\nrookie Cralg Krenzel played a\n\nhalf each in Sunday's 19-7 loss\n\nto Tampa Bay.

It was an\n\nuncharacteristic distraction for a\n\nteam that won four straight games\n\nbefore Sunday's loss.\n\nPerhaps most surprising were\n\nthe players involved. Manning Is\n\nknown for his studious ways and\n\ncalm demeanor, while Wayne\n\nhas quietly emerged as one\n\nof Manning's top targets. On\n\nSunday, the two Louisiana natives\n\nwere clearly irritated. Wayne and\n\nManning jawed briefly at each\n\nother, facemask to facemask, and �\n\nWayne even shoved last year's\n\nNFL co-MVP moments before\n\nthe offense went back onto the\n\nfield with 33 seconds left in the\n\ngame. Afterward, they appeared\n\nto make public amends. Manning\n\ncalled Wayne one of his favorite\n\nplayers and said it was merely out\n\nof frustration.

The Pirates\n\ntraveled to Danville, Va. this past\n\nweekend and defeated three of\n\ntheir closet rivals to finally cap-\n\nture the elusive state trophy.\n\nIn the first match of the\n\ntournament, the young ECU\n\nsquad faced the Duke Blue Devils.\n\nAfter falling behind 7-0, the team\n\npulled it together at halftime.\n\nWithin the first five minutes\n\nof the second half, the Pirates\n\nplayed as one unit, moving the\n\nball very effectively. The turning\n\npoint of the game came when\n\nveteran winger Dave Zeckman,\n\nkicked the ball over the line of\n\ndefense, ran onto the ball and\n\ntouched it down in the try-zone.\n\nThis magnificent play crushed\n\nDuke's spirits and ECU continued\n\non to win the match by a score\n\nof 19-7.\n\nThe Pirates' momentum from\n\ntheir first win continued to work\n\nin their favor during the second\n\nmatch of the tournament. This\n\ntime, the Pirates faced UNC-\n\nChapel Hill, who was nationally\n\nranked in the preseason and the\n\nfavored team in this year tourna-\n\nment. The first ten minutes of the\n\ngame was a stalemate as no team\n\nhad an advantage over the other.\n\nHowever, with hard hitting and\n\ngreat team work as the game pro-\n\ngressed, ECU was able to create\n\nscoring opportunities and took\n\nadvantage of all of them.\n\nThe onslaught of opportu-\n\nnistic scoring began when UNC\n\nkicked the ball off to ECU. Land-\n\ning in Pat Canham's hands, he\n\nbroke through a few tackles, and\n\npassed the ball down the line\n\nThe Pirate\n\nof support. Eventually reach-\n\ning speedster Jerome Leech, the\n\nball was touched down in the\n\ntry-zone. Once a lead had been\n\nbuilt, the Pirates did not look\n\nback and were triumphant in a\n\n30-12 win.\n\nHaving won both their previ-\n\nous games, ECU was set to play in\n\nthe championship game against\n\na veteran NC State squad. It rep-\n\nresented everything one should\n\nexpect out of the championship\n\ngame; fierce hitting, long offensive\n\ndrives, magnificent goal line stands\n\nand even sudden-death overtime.\n\nAfter two halves of a hard\n\nfought battle, the score was knot-\n\nted up, 13-13. As a result, there\n\nwould be two ten minute halves\n\nof sudden death overtime, the\n\nfirst team to score wins the State\n\nTournament.\n\nAs expected, both teams\n\ncame out firing on all cylinders.\n\nOnce again though, through\n\ngreat teamwork, ECU was able\n\nto move the ball down the field\n\nand scored on the first chance\n\nthey had.\n\nThe game-winning play came\n\nwhen senior Mark Borcherd-\n\ning kicked the ball forward to\n\na host of Pirate attackers. Ryan\n\nFord recovered the kick and got\n\ntackled inches from the try-zone,\n\nwhen Borcherding recovered the\n\nball and passed it to John Metcalf\n\nhe dove in to the try-zone scor-\n\ning the final points. With a final\n\nscore of 18-13, ECU secured their\n\nfirst State Championship in eight\n\nyears.\n\nJunior Rob Hileman was\n\n996. Their remaining games will be at home on Nov. 6 and 13.\n\nan enormous amount of talent\n\nand this was going to be the big\n\ntest. ECU Men's Rugby was con-\n\nsidered the underdog in the eyes\n\nof our opponents but we have\n\nproven ourselves as a force in\n\nNorth Carolina and I believe we\n\nthrilled with his team's victory\n\nafter the game.\n\n\"Winning this tournament is\n\namazing said Hileman.\n\n\"It was some of our veterans'\n\nlast chance to play in it. To go to\n\nthe state tournament with such\n\na young team and win it the way\n\nwe did is incredible\n\nThe win gives the men's club\n\na huge boost in confidence and\n\nin recognition. With 26 players\n\nreturning next year, Canham, a\n\nsenior this year, knows the team\n\nwill be well off in the following\n\nyears when he is done playing\n\nat ECU.\n\n\"The outcome of this week-\n\nend's tournament was huge for\n\nour team said Canham.\n\n\"Coming into the\n\ntournament, we knew we had\n\ncan compete with top competi-\n\ntors. We hope the whole ECU\n\ncommunity will provide the\n\nnecessary support that our team\n\nneeds to accomplish our future\n\ngoals\n\nThe Pirates will take to action\n\nagain on Nov. 6 and Nov. 13\n\nagainst Dan River and UNC-\n\nWilmington. Both games will be\n\nin Greenville at Blount Fields and\n\nwill begin at 1 p.m.\n\nThis writer can be contacted at\n\nsports at theeastcarolinian.com.\n\nReturnees must step up Ex-Eagles bring\n\nIce hockey to ECU\n\nECU hopes for more support than the NHL has right now.\n\nThis year's Pirates have few returning starters and a lot of inexperienced, young talent.\n\nThe Full Court Press\n\nROBERT LEONARD\n\nSTAFF WRITER\n\nI'm not going to lie - football\n\ngames are fun. But nothing on\n\nthis campus compares to basket-\n\nball games.\n\nThe Minges Maniacs have\n\ndone an amazing job building a\n\nfan base for the 2004-2005 ECU\n\nMen's Basketball Team and I\n\nbelieve excitement this year may\n\nbe higher than ever.\n\nAfter last year, we have lost\n\nfive players due to graduation\n\n(Derek Wiley, Eroyl Bing, Gabe\n\nMikulas, Luke McKay and Garth\n\nGrindley) and two others trans-\n\nferred (Belton Rivers and Frank\n\nRobinson). The players remain-\n\ning can't even play five on five\n\nwithout a new teammate coming\n\nonto the court and becoming the\n\nfifth. So with that in mind, I will\n\nonly guarantee one thing for this\n\nseason. Every game, someone\n\nwho didn't attend ECU last year\n\nwill start this year.\n\nThe key to this season will be\n\nthe play of the new guys, but the\n\nfour returnees have to step up.\n\nThis includes everything from\n\nhelping coach Herrion teach\n\nthe new players Herrion's way\n\nof playing to asking for the ball\n\nwhen they're on the court. In my\n\nopinion, and I said this a lot last\n\nyear, no one has to step up more\n\nthan Corey Rouse.\n\nRouse is enteririg his junior\n\nseason. A recruit from Klnston,\n\nhe has never lived up to the hype\n\nhe received out of high school.\n\nHis role was limited last year and\n\nhe didn't see much playing time.\n\nThe first and most important\n\nthing he must do is rebound. I saw\n\nbits and pieces of that last season\n\nin exhibitions and non-confer-\n\nence games. Of course, this was\n\nagainst teams with players having\n\nthe basketball ability of a senior\n\ncitizen. Eroyl Bing did all the dirty\n\nwork on the glass last year, and\n\nRouse must step into that role.\n\nSecondly, Rouse must score. If\n\nhe can put up 10 to IS points a\n\ngame I would be ecstatic, but he's\n\ngoing to have to do down low.\n\nRouse air balled around five free\n\nthrows last season, and unless he\n\ngot his touch down from the line,\n\nhe better earn those points from\n\nabout four feet away.\n\nThirdly, he has got to stay\n\nout of foul trouble. A team with\n\nsix new faces isn't exactly what I\n\nwould call deep. Any time he has\n\nto sit due to foul trouble, we have\n\nto bring in a new guy. No matter\n\nhow good a freshman is, I would\n\nrather have Rouse out there\n\nsimply because he has experience\n\nin Conference USA play.\n\nJaphet McNeil Is another\n\nguy who has to step up. 1 really\n\nthink this team isn't danger-\n\nous unless Rouse and McNeil\n\nare playing their best. McNeil\n\nshowed the potential to be\n\nawesome last season, but more\n\noften than not was, at best,\n\ninconsistent on the hardwood.\n\nAt first, I felt he was going to\n\nbe a great player. He was dishing\n\nout assists as if he got paid to\n\ndo it, but then conference play\n\nrolled around and Mike Cook\n\nstepped up, forcing McNeil out\n\nof the picture. With the transfer\n\nof Rivers and Robinson, we lost\n\nboth our starting and back-up\n\nshooting guard. I believe Cook\n\nwill move over the shooting\n\nguard position and McNeil will\n\nstart at the point.\n\nMcNeil must control the ball\n\nand the pace of the game from\n\nthat number one spot. I think\n\nmany other fans were nervous\n\nwhen he came in and brought\n\nthe ball up court last year.\n\nTeams like Louisville are\n\ngoing to press the absolute hell\n\nout of him so he must remain\n\ncalm. Japhet also has to play great\n\ndefense that was the strongest\n\npart of his game last season. Of\n\ncourse, he was in a back-up role\n\nwhere he was only playing 10-20\n\nminutes a game whereas this year\n\nhe will be playing around 25-35\n\nminutes, something he hasn't\n\ndone since high school.\n\nOut of the 11 guys on the\n\nteam, the only two I have few\n\nworries about are Mike Cook and\n\nMoussa Badiane. These two have\n\nproved themselves against every\n\nteam in C-USA.\n\nSimply put, Cook is the man.\n\nThe reason 1 like Cook is because\n\nthe guy can just flat out ball. He's\n\nsavvy, he's smart, he has great\n\ncourt vision, can shoot the rock\n\nfrom almost anywhere and he\n\ncan shoot free throws.

In the 1996\n\nclassic movie, Adam Sandler's\n\ncharacter tried out every year\n\nto make the local hockey team.\n\nHe never quite made it. Maybe\n\nGilmore should have talked to\n\nBrent Falcon and started a club\n\nice hockey team.\n\nThe newest student organiza-\n\ntion is in the preliminary stages\n\nof forming a cohesive and com-\n\npetitive team who will compete\n\nagainst teams across the nation.\n\nForty-five people have already\n\nshown interest, a staggering\n\nnumber for a club team.\n\nThe club ice hockey team is\n\nthe product of ex-teammates in\n\nFalcon, Jordan Meyers and Corey\n\nFleitz. The three played together\n\nfor four years as part of the East\n\nCoast Eagles, a traveling ice\n\nhockey team from Raleigh.\n\n\"After I stopped playing with\n\nthe Eagles, I had very few options\n\nif I still wanted to play said\n\nPresident Brent Falcon.\n\n\"You miss playing at a real\n\ncompetitive level with people\n\nyour age.

The new\n\nice rink in Greenville is called\n\nBlades on Ice and will debut after\n\nthe semester ends.\n\nBefore the new rink opens,\n\nthe team has scheduled two open\n\npractice sessions in Cary. Unfor-\n\ntunately for the team, they will\n\nhave to commute in order to find\n\na place to skate. Even then, the\n\nprice of skating is no easy bill.\n\nIce time is steep at $200\n\nper hour, a number the newly\n\nformed team will have to pay\n\nout of pocket. In fact, fund-\n\nraising isn't going to be easy\n\nfor a team who will have to\n\ngarner their own skates, uni-\n\nforms, pads and helmets. The\n\nteam will also have a limited\n\nbudget because of the extensive\n\ntravel and other dues involved.\n\n\"It's not going to be easy\n\nFalcon said.\n\n\"Everyone I've talked to is 100\n\npercent behind this and is willing\n\nto do a lot of work to get it going.\n\nWe're not going to quit after our\n\nfirst setback i\n\nThe teams have plans to raise\n\nmoney through selling t-shirts\n\nand working at Kings Dominion,\n\nbut are currently open to any new\n\nideas.
