        "text": "An initial understanding of the most cost-effective methods, and surveying the local market of suppliers and contractors, ensure that the scale of your IBC can be kept in line with budget requirements – always with sustainability and future recycling of materials kept in mind. The overall planning and management of a build are handled by highly-experienced staff with the vision to see the challenges and potential complications of an installation in advance.\n\nThe final steps of the journey are implemented by crews hand-picked for the role following rigorous recruitment procedures. A methodology that ensures the best team for the job, given the local scenario, will be deployed to construct your facility.\n\nHBS’ years of experience have covered all eventualities and numerous approaches to finding a suitable solution for the installation and operation of facilities in all types of environments. For example, the 7th Asian Winter Games Astana-Almaty 2011, where the designated space available for the project was a former nightclub on the 11th floor of the Almaty Towers business complex. The IGBS construction team made it work.\n\nIt is never as simple as hiring a spacious exhibition centre and taking a drag-and-drop cookie-cutter approach to installing multilateral and unilateral areas. Sometimes it can be quite a challenge. HBS’ years of experience have covered all eventualities and numerous approaches to finding a suitable solution for the installation and operation of facilities in all types of environments."
