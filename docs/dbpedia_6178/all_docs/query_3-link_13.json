        "text": "Who Depends on AM?\n\nFrom reporting the latest weather updates and providing vital emergency warnings to covering the local high school football game, communities across the country depend on AM radio.\n\nFrom small and rural markets to major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta, AM stations are among the most popular for news, sports, entertainment and weather. Over 80 million people in the U.S. listen to AM radio each month, according to Nielsen.\n\nAM radio also plays a vital role in connecting Black, Asian and Hispanic communities with stations that serve these audiences with niche and in-language programming.\n\nWith its unique ability to reach a wide geographic area, AM radio offers many Americans struggling with poor, or non-existent, cellular and broadband coverage a chance to stay connected.\n\nDespite this, some auto manufacturers have begun discontinuing AM radio from the dashboard. Instead, they would shift the cost to car buyers, who would need to use cellular data to stream AM stations. Congress is considering legislation that would ensure Americans who depend on AM radio each month for news, entertainment and critical safety information can continue to have access to this reliable communications medium.\n\nTake action now  tell your members of Congress to help keep AM radio in the car!
