        "text": "Guys, I'm listening to a magic jukebox tonight. It's a shortwave radio station called WTWW out of Lebanon, Tennessee but I found them simulcasting on their website and the oldies are sounding better than I've ever heard them. This guy is playing the most incredible mix of 50s, 60s, and 70s in a stream that has so much clarity. The stereo recordings sound so crisp and full and whenever there's a mono recording it has a sonic clarity I've never heard.\n\nWhoever the guy is he plays a wonderful mix of well known stuff plus a lot that seems obscure (at least to me). I love this station.\n\nClick on 'transmitter 2' and it will take you to that station. It's incredible. I'm now running the audio from my Gateway laptop into my stereo and it's so satisfying.\n\nWTWW - Listen Live\n\nI listened for a while last night. My Special Angel by the Vogues kicked it off, which I hadn't heard in a long time (probably since last time I played the band's compilation CD). Decent selection; I wasn't there long enough to figure out how deep they went."
