This possesses a method known as skip or sky wave propagation due to its capability to be aimed at an angle towards the sky and beyond the horizon making the SW waves bounce back to Earth over notably huge distances.\n\nAside from their known usage in the broadcasting industry, their frequency and techniques are utilized between communication in telephones and telegraph messages. In addition to that, these are also used by ham radio stations and mobile radios with two-way communication systems.\n\nToday, shortwave radios are available online and offer more convenient access and availability. You just need an internet connection and the right browser to connect, listen, and even interact with other users.\n\nIs there a shortwave radio app?\n\nDefinitely, yes!

If the frequencies covered by your radio can lie between 26.9 and 27.5 MHz, you may access the CB programs in no time.
