In addition to that, these are also used by ham radio stations and mobile radios with two-way communication systems.\n\nToday, shortwave radios are available online and offer more convenient access and availability. You just need an internet connection and the right browser to connect, listen, and even interact with other users.\n\nIs there a shortwave radio app?\n\nDefinitely, yes!
