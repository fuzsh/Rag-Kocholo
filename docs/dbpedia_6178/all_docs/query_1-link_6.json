        "text": "Hello All,\n\nNew to the forum/site and this is my first post. Curious if I could get some opinions on why I cant seem to hear any of the shortwave stations that should be broadcasting. I'm all the way up in Alaska, on Kodiak Island which is a few hundred miles southwest of Anchorage. All I can hear is stations out of East Asia. I've looked over the schedules, followed the \"rules\" about low frequency in the night and high during the day and I cant hear anything bound for North America. Think this is because I'm so far north? I've attached a long wire antenna to the back of my house and it picks up the Asian stations better but that's really about it. Every once in a while I get the time station on 15000Khz.\n\nTecsun PL-380 is the radio I am using. I know its cheap, but its my first one.\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated.\n\nRyan\n\nYou're in a very unique position, and unfortunately, mother nature hasn't been too kind to us. We're in a downward spiral of a cycle that has been the weakest in nearly a century of record keeping. Consequently propagation hasn't been all that good. Add to that how close you are to the auroral oval and the Pole, and that adds another level of complexity to the equation. Whenever the sun starts acting up, you're likely to be among the first to notice it.\n\nBroadcasts to North America have declined drastically in recent years; heck, there's hardly anything out of Asia coming our way any more. You can use the various schedule websites listed here (links are always blue) to help, but this is always going to be impacted by propagation across the Pole...\n\nSWL Broadcast - The RadioReference Wiki\n\nWWV Colorado on 15 Mhz is a decent catch from where you are so your setup is working; and frankly, you can hear Asian and Pacific stations that we East Coasters would give our eye teeth for to hear.\n\nMike\n\nka3jjz,\n\nThanks for the reply. I get really good reception early in the morning, which in the summer time here isn't before sunrise. I can usually see the sun on the horizon even when I'm up between 430-500am. After about 9am I get nothing on SW. The Asian stations are cool to hear but I would like to understand what they saying! I'll look into the solar conditions more like you were saying. I actually caught BBC in English this morning, so that was cool.\n\nThanks,\n\nRyan\n\nThis is precisely the same as SW propagation here in California. So it goes to what Mike said about the propagation especially in the past 2-3 months. By the way, neat to read what it's like up there in Alaska.\n\nHere, the Asias just ram in bigtime between 1000-1600UTC and like magic, poof! all gone. From that time until around 2300UTC I literally only get solid copy on WWV on 10-15megs, Brother Stair like he's next door, MWARA and 11175. That's it all day lately. But 0000UTC it all starts gaining strength and becomes full solid copy on tons of stuff worldwide into the evening.\n\nYour reception perception might be more common than you know.\n\nAs others have said, conditions are not great, and your location combined with time of the year (but in the winter you have an advantage) does not help, however, I am going to chime in with it is probably also because of your equipment. Yeah, that is going to be controversial, and not everyone will agree with me, but let me explain.\n\nYes, in the mornings things to the west of you and below 14000 kHz will be primarily what you hear, that means Asia, South Pacific, and far east Europe / Russia. Once the sun gets good and up below 8000 kHz will tank, and then freqs above that will be better. In the evening when the sun is getting lower then the east will pick up.\n\nThis is flat out the worst time of the year for your location, and in the middle of some very bad conditions. So it will take optimal equipment (radio and antenna) to squeeze what little can be gotten from the situation.\n\nA good antenna, not just a random wire, maybe something cut for a specific band and properly mounted. And a good receiver.\n\nYeah, as others have said, conditions aren't great, but you can still hear stations. I am in southern CA, so not quite the same conditions as you, but right now is about 3.5 hours from sundown, and I have some usable stations. The following only applies to right now as I write this, and stations that are usably strong. I did not use my Rhombics or beams, this is on a triband fan dipole.\n\nOn 31 meters all of these are at usable (but few strong) levels right now:\n\n9265 WINB, Red Lion PA\n\n9350 WWCR, Nasheville TN\n\n9370 WWRB, TN, (Overcomer Ministries ... DOH! )\n\n9395 WRMI, FL, RMI Oldies\n\n9455 WRMI\n\n9475 WTWW, TN\n\n9535 Radio Habana Cuba\n\n9570 CRI, Albania\n\n9595 R. Nikei 1, Japan (odd reception, at this time)\n\nAnd here is what the spectrum looks like, the vertical lines on the waterfall are stations: I called out only the ones that could be used above, there are several other stations on the waterfall, but they are a pretty tough pull.\n\n25 meters has a similar number of usable stations right now, but more Cuban and less US. 19 meters has some usable traffic on it, but more towards the west, Asia. 41 meters is starting to show some traffic, but anything outside the US is still a bit weak to call usable, give it 2 hours and those will come up out of the noise and Europeans will be usable. However, in your location that might not happen, not sure.\n\nOf those 31 meter stations I listed only 3 can be heard (at a usable level) on my Tecsun PL-660 portable.\n\nTomorrow morning there will be a lot more traffic to be had. Asia and South Pacific will be booming in, from the tropical bands to 25 meters at least. There will be dozens of strong stations, and many times that number usable but not really strong stations.\n\nMarginal to bad conditions require optimal equipment to really get good use. During better times you can get away with a lower end portable and maybe a short random wire. But the worse the conditions the more effort you need to put into the gear / setup.\n\nT!\n\nBoombox,\n\nI've been able to hear Cuba late in the afternoon here in Alaska, which surprised me. I ordered a radio with SSB as a ham operator friend suggested that as well. I'm eager to try it out when it arrives tomorrow.\n\nFor what it's worth, most of my recent loggings/SW stations heard have been on a Grundig G2 (a small, Degen-made portable with a SiLabs IF chip, probably not too different from the circuits in your own Tecsun radio), off its whip antenna.\n\nLast year I was able to hear China's broadcasts to Europe (in the opposite direction from me) from Kashgar (in Sinkiang, Western China) off the same radio, so I think the vast majority of your reception issue is conditions. Although, if you had a very good antenna and a tabletop HF receiver, you would probably have a better chance of hearing things.\n\nRE: Cuba: they always get out quite well, even the Spanish broadcasts. I believe it's partly because they aim their signal North and West towards the US much of the time. There have been times when the only thing I've heard on the air during the evening has been Cuba, and Brother Stair (or a similar religious broadcast coming out of one of the domestic US SW broadcasters).\n\nRE: SSB: that will help with ham band reception. Hams tend to try to contact each other even in miserable conditions, for the challenge of it. And many times I've heard hams on 20 meters when the nearby 19 meter band is kaput.\n\nRE: SSB: that will help with ham band reception.

And many times I've heard hams on 20 meters when the nearby 19 meter band is kaput.\n\nTo the OP, you can listen to AM stations with the receiver in SSB, but not SSB stations with the receiver in AM.\n\nAlso keep in mind that SSB can help when receiving AM stations. Selecting a sideband away from interference (i.e. LSB when there is a strong BC station 5 kHz above the one you want) can be a real help. And sometimes SSB will make a just weak and unreadable AM station copiable even when there is no interference.\n\nI ALWAYS recommend a receiver with SSB, even if the person only wants to listen to SW BC stations. I further recommend the receiver actually have selectable USB and LSB, not just generic SSB with a BFO. The extra few dollars, and generally it is just a few for similar quality, often results in a much more usable receiver.\n\nT!"
