        "text": "Greetings again, all,\n\nA couple of you have been trying to tune into Ted Randall’s “Voice of Freedom” broadcasts on 9940 KHZ and haven’t heard anything.\n\nRemember, he’s beaming these broadcasts into Eastern Europe and Russia. So in order to take advantage of propagation and “prime time” evening listening in that part of the world, his broadcasts need to originate during what is our mid afternoon. And, that’s when we will hear them here in Canada. Right now, at 4:00 PM on Friday his broadcast is booming in to my shack on 9940 KHz with an S9 signal.\n\nAs with most shortwave transmissions, and because of the high costs involved, these stations usually don’t broadcast 24/7. Ted once told me that their hydro bill for running their three 100 KW transmitters on these intermittent schedules usually runs upwards of US $ 75,000 a MONTH!\n\n73,\n\nKeith\n\nThank for the info Keith\n\ntoggle quoted message Show quoted text\n\nOn Fri, Mar 25, 2022 at 4:13 PM Keith Baker via groups.io <kb1sf=yahoo.com@groups.io> wrote:\n\nGreetings again, all,\n\nA couple of you have been trying to tune into Ted Randall’s “Voice of Freedom” broadcasts on 9940 KHZ and haven’t heard anything.\n\nRemember, he’s beaming these broadcasts into Eastern Europe and Russia.
