        "text": "Radio station in Lebanon, Tennessee\n\nWTWW is a shortwave station located in Lebanon, Tennessee. It is officially licensed to Leap of Faith, Inc. As of December 2022, WTWW has one working transmitter, that on 5.085 MHz, which operates during the evening hours carrying Scriptures for America, a service produced by LaPorte Church of Christ.\n\nUntil 2022, WTWW had also carried an oldies/classic hits format operated by Ted Randall, who also appeared on several programs on the station, and his wife Holly on the 5.085 MHz and 9.94 MHz frequencies.[2] WTWW went off-air November 10, 2022, with Randall taking the oldies format to WRMI; the station returned to the air sporadically in December solely carrying Scriptures for America. WTWW is licensed several other frequencies that are off-air.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nWTWW, according to the FCC,[page needed] was originally licensed a construction permit as WBWW on June 30, 2009. Testing began in January 2010 and ending mid-February 2010. Testing frequencies used were 5.755 MHz and 9.48 MHz, and recorded by several listeners who uploaded the audio to YouTube.[citation needed] WTWW broadcast throughout its existence via a heavily-used transmitter donated by KNLS, after that station upgraded to a new transmitter.\n\nWTWW officially signed on at 15:00 UTC on Friday, February 19, 2010 using the 9.48 MHz frequency with low power and streaming [1] with programming from the Scriptures for America broadcast network, part of a long-term leasing agreement that has continued throughout WTWW's existence.[citation needed] Both the frequencies 5.755 MHz and 9.48 MHz and their transmitters were previously used by Christian shortwave outlet KAIJ in Dallas, Texas.\n\nIn January 2010, WTWW (as WBWW) was licensed to operate at 100 kilowatts with an azimuth of 40 degrees, every day, on 5.755 MHz from 00:00 to 07:00 UTC and on 9.48 MHz from 12:00 to 19:00 and 22:00 to 24:00 UTC, targeting CIRAF zones 4 and 9 (eastern Canada), 18 and 27–28 (Europe), 37–38 (north Africa), 39 (the Middle East), and 46–47 (western and central Africa).[1]\n\nIn 2015, WTWW briefly served as the terrestrial broadcast home of Art Bell's overnight radio program Midnight in the Desert.[3]\n\nThe Big One on 5085\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: WRMI § WRMI Legends\n\nFrom August 2018 to 2022, WTWW's lead engineer Ted Randall operated a locally originated personality oldies format on the 5.085 MHz signal in the evenings, with veteran disc jockeys and voiceover artists to host the programming. Among its hosts was famed sound engineer Bob Heil, who hosted an hour of \"Live Theater Organ from the Ozarks.\"[4] WTWW disc jockeys worked unpaid for the station, broadcasting remotely from their homes.[5][6] In a 2017 interview with The Spectrum Monitor, Randall described his arrangement with WTWW as a barter agreement with its owners, providing engineering services in exchange for the right to use the WTWW transmitters for music and ham radio programming as he saw fit, akin to a local marketing agreement.[7]\n\nTemporary shutdown and departure of The Big One\n\n[edit]\n\nOn November 9, 2022, Randall announced his departure from the station, eventually taking the station's programming to a WRMI transmitter five days later. The station briefly shut down after Randall's departure.[8][9] WTWW sporadically returned to the air December 22, carrying Scriptures for America on the 5.085 (and eventually 9.475) frequencies.\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nScriptures for America operates primarily as an outlet for the pre-recorded sermons of LaPorte Church of Christ founder Peter J. Peters (who died in 2011 shortly after the station began broadcasting) and his successors.[10] The Anti-Defamation League has identified Peters's programs as \"bigoted pseudo-religious Christian Identity (and) antisemitism\" and had attempted to take stations that had carried the program at the time (before WTWW had signed on) to be subjected to FCC investigations for broadcasting to domestic audiences, as the ADL argued such programs had no relevance outside the United States.[11]\n\nLaPorte had also previously offered The Bible Worldwide, which offered audiobook broadcasts of the Holy Bible in various languages (with the King James Version being used for English readings), when WTWW had an additional frequency to spare.[12] During his time with the station, Randall commented that the transmitter carrying The Bible Worldwide worked properly almost all of the time while the ones carrying Scriptures for America frequently malfunctioned, which Randall mused could have been a case of divine intervention.[7]\n\nAs of October 2023, WTWW began accepting programming from other religious broadcasters under the guidance of Bob Biermann, including Biermann's talk show Truth2Ponder, which originates from WRMI.[13]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
