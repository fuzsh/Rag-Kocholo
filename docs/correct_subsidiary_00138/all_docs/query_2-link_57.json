        "text": "Its experienced team brings proven expertise and credibility to top communications technology clients\n\nATLANTA – (February 18, 2019) – Calysto Communications is proud to announce its twentieth year as the leading global marketing communications agency specializing in raising awareness for companies in the mobile, wireless, telecom, IT and IoT industries. In an era when technology companies come and go, Calysto has achieved two decades of innovation and steady growth, accomplishing many notable “firsts” along the way.\n\nCalysto began operations in February of 1999 when Laura Borgstede, the company’s founder and Chief Energizing Officer, launched the world’s first global public relations agency focused on mobile, wireless and telecom. She aimed to build an agency uniquely qualified to build awareness and develop content that captured the attention of industry influencers, and that’s precisely what Calysto has done for the last 20 years.\n\nIn 1999, Calysto also launched the PR Vibes™ email newsletter to support its mission: To connect, energize and influence people in communications technology through communications. Today, PR Vibes is read by more than 22,000 C-level executives – including CEOs, CMOs, CCOs, and senior public relations, sales and marketing professionals – and many others via Calysto’s PR Vibes blog.\n\nCalysto’s early success indicated a growing demand for PR services that leveraged relationships with media and influencers in mobile, wireless and telecom. Seeing this opportunity, Borgstede developed and introduced several complementary services including social media marketing and content marketing, making Calysto one of the first public relations agencies to embrace the social media and content marketing trends, upon the release of a revolutionary white paper on the subject in 2012 called The Rise of Content PR. With these and other new service offerings, the agency evolved into a full-service marketing communications firm.\n\nMost recently, the company has introduced its Strategic Business Framework™ – an in-depth journey that incorporates defining a company’s unique value proposition, developing strategic positioning and establishing key messaging. They agency has also become well-known for its ability to position communications technology executives as Thought Leaders, leveraging innovative marketing campaigns to elevate their status as visionaries.\n\nTogether, these capabilities make Calysto’s marketing communications programs more comprehensive than any other social media, digital, content marketing or traditional PR agency in the communications technology domain – and better positioned to help companies effectively build their businesses by leveraging their PR and marketing programs.\n\nCalysto has completed project and program work for hundreds of companies in its 20 years in business, including well-respected names such as Tellabs, ADTRAN, BroadSoft (Cisco), Level 3 Communications (CenturyLink), Broadwing (Level 3), Hitachi, MetaSolv (Oracle), Intec Telecom Systems (CSG), SAP, Telica (Alcatel-Lucent (Nokia)) and innovative startups like RACO Wireless (Kore), Allot Communications, Quuppa, Longview IoT, CoreKinect and many more.\n\nAlthough it’s been involved in M2M/IoT since the early 2000s, Calysto’s strategy blossomed when it became the agency of record for RACO Wireless in 2011. The company has since made its mark as the number one agency for the IoT industry, successfully positioning more than 20 companies for IPO or acquisition.\n\nIn 2007, Calysto became the first agency to offer an all senior-level staff of experts, each boasting more than 20 years of deep experience in communications and marketing, leveraging storytelling, content, PR, and social media to build recognition and value for Calysto’s clients. This is thanks to Borgstede’s early adoption of a then-unique distributed workforce model, enabling Calysto to acquire the most talented and experienced PR professionals in the communications technology industry – independent of their location. These practices have not only benefited Calysto’s clients but also create a greater level of satisfaction among its employees.\n\nIn 2014, Calysto introduced Avante, a wholly owned subsidiary, allowing clients in the mobile, wireless, telecom, IT and IoT industries to benefit from a focused and straightforward PR program with stricter budgetary needs..\n\nCalysto has been recognized as one of “Atlanta’s Best and Brightest Companies to Work For™” by the National Association for Business Resources, and is The winner of a remarkable nine Stevie Awards based on the results it has delivered to its clients. Calysto has proven itself to be a cut above the rest, with 20 years of experience offering unparalleled value and support to some of the top global brands in the mobile, wireless, telecom, IT and IoT industries.\n\n“It’s hard to believe Calysto is 20 years old, that translates directly into 20 years of experience serving clients in the communications industry, as well as 20 years of cultivating meaningful connections with media, analysts, and influencers,” said Laura Borgstede, CEO. “I believe communications technology has the power to change lives, change industries, and change the future. Calysto is proud to have helped communications technology companies share their vision with the world for the past two decades.”\n\nAbout Calysto Communications\n\nCalysto is a global marketing communications agency that specializes in raising awareness and driving value for companies in the mobile, wireless, telecom, IT and IoT markets.
