His work as a venture investor, innovation consultant, university professor and media commentator, allows him to experience and connect the many threads of entrepreneurship and technology innovation that are core to the United States economy and its future. When Jonathan talks about these areas, the community takes notice. He is identified as a leader of change and influence in print and television media, among other things being recognized by Washingtonian magazine as a “Tech Titan,” by Washington Business Journal as a member of the “Power 100” and by the Commonwealth of Virginia as one of the “50 Most Influential Entrepreneurs” in the Commonwealth. He has been innovation policy advisor to a number of national and state political campaigns, including serving most recently as the head of the Innovation Group for the successful gubernatorial campaign of Ralph Northam.\n\nJonathan is best known for his work as the founder and managing partner of Amplifier Ventures, a closely held innovation and venture capital company he founded in 2004. Amplifier Ventures has seeded 16 companies since that time, and helped create lasting technology businesses that have impacted the media, cybersecurity and healthcare industries. His innovation consulting work has been national in scope, and has provided strategically useful advice to a diverse range of clients that includes the Department of Defence, Volunteers of America, Montgomery County Economic Development Corporation and George Mason University. His expertise in creating innovation programs, changing organizational culture and promoting entrepreneurship keeps him in steady demand as an advisor, strategic consultant and keynote speaker.\n\nHe has a significant media footprint. He hosts What’s Working in Washington, a podcast and weekly show on WFED examining innovation in one of the least understood business communities in the country. Jonathan’s interviews reveal how D.C. is about way more than just politics. It is brimming with creative people who are interesting, engaged and getting things done. He is also a weekly columnist in the Washington Business Journal and was previously a columnist in the Washington Post, where in each case he wrote on innovation, entrepreneurship and economic development.\n\nDuring his career Jonathan has helped to create many successful communities of entrepreneurs. In 2011, he was the founder of Startup Virginia, Startup Maryland and StartupDC as part of the Obama Administration’s StartupAmerica Initiative. These efforts resulted in the formation of regionally impactful programs including 1776 Accelerator and the iCorps program. In 2012 he formed FounderCorps, a not for profit that aggregated many of the Greater Washington region’s most prominent entrepreneurs and promoted mentorship. In 2013 he founded TandemNSI, a community that connects entrepreneurs with national security opportunities.\n\nJonathan grew up in a family of small business owners. His parents and grandparents desperately tried to prevent him from living an entrepreneurial life and encouraged him to become a professional instead. He obtained an education in economics and law (with post graduate qualifications in each) from the London School of Economics (MSc in Economics), Cambridge University (BA and MA in law), New York University (LLM) and George Washington University (BA).\n\nDuring his subsequent career as a professional advisor, he worked in the financial services industry in London for Daiwa Securities, Goldman Sachs and Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette, and then as a corporate/venture capital lawyer as a partner in technology law firms Fenwick & West, Pillsbury Winthrop and Fish and Richardson. During this time Jonathan’s focus was on opening new business initiatives and offices, and in 2003 he realized that despite his parents’ best intentions he was really an entrepreneur after all.\n\nJonathan is a committed educator, and has been adjunct professor at a number of universities. He is currently Professor of Entrepreneurship at the Smith School of Business of the University of Maryland, where he teaches a broad range of classes in business formatting, strategy and family entrepreneurship. He is a sought-after commentator on developments in technology, innovation and political economics. In addition to his work with the Washington Business Journal and What’s Working in Washington, he is often quoted in national publications including Bloomberg, CNN, Huffington Post and The New York Times. He is also an active and regular participant on panels involving innovation, entrepreneurship and technology as well as a keynote speaker at similar events.\n\nJonathan is lead guitarist of Two Car Living Room and an avid reader of science fiction.\n\nSession Moderator: Cybersecurity Trends in Protecting Disruptive Technologies\n\nJonathan is highly respected and valued thought leader on entrepreneurship and innovation.

Chef Lightfoot brings over thirty years of culinary experience to the kitchen and hospitality world. He began as a prep cook at the Rib-It Restaurant in Cherry Hill NJ. Only after a year he was named Asst. Banquet Chef at Hogates Seafood Restaurant. Shortly thereafter, he was offered a job as Sous Chef for the Savoy Suites Hotel in Washington, DC. After spending the next few years there, he studied with Chef A. Renato of the famed Georgetown Club Washington, D.C., was a first cook at The Cosmos Club and got his degree at The Baltimore International Culinary Institute of Culinary Arts, and he also studied at the famed Culinary Institute of America, Boot Camps in Hyde Park, New York. At the CIA, Shawn saw and tasted many different cuisines from around the world. He uses techniques from around the world, always with a mind to bend them to his own purposes. As he continued his education, he developed and refined his style as a chef. The more he learned, the more he realized that virtually his entire culinary repertoire was possible to share to his community even under the strict standards of our field. So, after serving as Phillips Seafood Training Coordinator for four years, in 1995 he decided to open his first food experience bringing people a taste of his travels, he decided to redraw the fence line. Truly, it is all about the people, the food and drink. The menus are always focused on freshness, flavor, and healthy preparation options. The foods are grounded in the climate of today’s health disparities in marginalized and low-income communities and neighborhoods. This is his dream come true, his passion and his life. The fences have been rebuilt around his community, and this grass is definitely greener.\n\nSession Panelist: Future of Food\n\nChef Shawn Lightfoot entered the culinary industry in 1982 under the tutelage of Chef Gary Black, then at Washington, DC’s famed Hogates Seafood Restaurant.
