This reduces the desktop clutter and operator confusion associated with multiple keyboards and mice on a desktop. Simply rolling the mouse over a different source activates that control path.\n\nA simple keyboard GUI control, also derived from the Draco tera KVM control methodology enables user source and preset selection.In addition integrated 8-point GPIO module and IP control enable external switching by network or push-button mechanisms as well as LED indication of active status and sources.\n\nAs with all IHSE products, the 4K multiviewer incorporates extensive redundancy and backup features and SNMP options to meet every operational reliability scenario.\n\nProduce » Manage Production » Post-Production Software » Collaboration, review and approval »\n\nTMD’s Media Portal has been developed to provide a standardised method of receiving content. It is designed to make it simpler for media organisations to manage the process of receiving content, along with making it easier and more efficient for studios and third-party collaborators to deliver content to them. Media Portal provides an intuitive solution to transfer media content, with no technical knowledge required. This is preferable to many other methods of transferring content, where there may be limitations on file sizes and formats as well as security challenges.\n\nWith Mediaflex Media Portal, all that is required is for suppliers to access the web address of the organisation’s portal, which could be on the public internet. Once logged in the user is immediately presented with what media content they need to transfer to the Mediaflex platform. The first screen the user sees is a hierarchical list of media content grouped by Series, Season, Episode and Versions, all ordered by deadline date.\n\nOnce uploaded, the video content then goes through an initial set of pre-configured ingest technical QC processes, making it easy to see which files have been successfully uploaded, passed the initial technical checks and are ready to send onto the next stages of the content supply chain processes. Any number of users can upload at the same time from different user accounts located across multiple locations around the world. Configurable metadata fields are completed by the user at the same time, enabling discoverability and searchability of the content once it is enters Mediaflex as a media item.\n\nMedia Portal includes comprehensive logging of events including capturing the details of all files uploaded, sent and deleted. The interface is configurable for each media organisation, and intuitively provides support information and support availability based on the location of the user.\n\nManage » Manage & Orchestrate » Content & Workflow Management » End-to-end supply chain solutions »\n\nThe Mediaflex Video Browser is an intuitive web-based UI, enabling the viewing of all Parliamentary sessions in legislature chambers and meeting rooms, as well as recordings from studios and external locations. Where recordings are from the chambers, during and after the sessions, senators and senate aides and any authorised personnel can view the recordings and access any section of the clips in near real-time as they are being recorded. Selected clips can be added to a workflow, which makes the clip recordings available to senators and staff for use in their parliamentary duties.\n\nThe Video Browser is configurable for access rights. It can be set to only be accessed via a login screen from an authorised network, so it is only available to approved users, or set to have open access if desired.\n\nRecorded content is searchable by configurable criteria, including date, what is currently being recorded, by location, and by keyword (the content of each recorded session). All sessions are recorded to a preservation format and a browse format, with the browse format being configurable including live frame-accurate HLS with closed captions. A thumbnail of the recording and the close captions can also be viewed. The Video Browser reads the captions with corresponding timecodes from the database and/or a file. It supports captions in any language, and in any number of languages.\n\nA recording may be many hours long. Video Browser enables the user to select a single clip from the recording, several short clips as well as single or multiple clips from multiple recordings. The user is the able to see the selected clips in a timeline, which can then be added to a workflow.\n\nManage » Manage & Orchestrate » Content & Workflow Management » Archive and preservation management »\n\nThe consumption of content continues to accelerate on an upwards path and the need to efficiently acquire, manage and deliver across the entire content supply chain becomes ever more compelling.\n\nTo achieve optimum performance we need to consider following a digital transformation strategy that builds on the four pillars of the content supply chain:\n\nContent – in all its forms, digital and physical, video, audio, graphics, captions, subtitles, scripts and documents, as well as all the associated and additional metadata\n\nWorkflow – Nothing happens to content without direction, as simple or complex as needed. Business processes, logic and decisions must be performed to create cohesive and efficient workflows, taking into account both manual, and the increasing amount of automated tasks\n\nResources – Workflows don’t happen without somebody or something managing and orchestrating them, whether it be a person and/or technology\n\nAnalytics – How do you know how well your operation is running and that you’ve implemented efficient working practices? Analytics. Being able to measure and manage the business across the above 3 pillars enables an organisation to automate elasticity in resource utilisation, to understand the metrics of its operation, how efficient they are and ultimately how the bottom line is affected by them.\n\nUndertaking a strategy that creates tight integration of all 4 pillars will deliver significant benefits to the organisation. Maximising the benefit requires the implementation of an agile and flexible content supply chain solution, so implementing a business solution, such as Mediaflex-UMS (Unified Media Services), that embraces all 4 pillars will ultimately lead to a significantly more efficient operation.\n\nFrom its concept, Mediaflex-UMS has been designed to integrate these 4 pillars and place clients in control of their content, metadata and the business processes across their content supply chains. Equally as important, it was designed to place our customers in control of the Mediaflex-UMS platform.\n\nSo often organisations find out the hard way that the implementation of a new system requires them to go back to the vendor and/or rely on technology experts to modify the code to cater for new business processes, or modify existing ones, as the business changes. This often leads to the question “Do I build or buy?”.\n\nWith Mediaflex-UMS you get the best of both worlds: buying a system that allows authorised personnel to use the tool-sets built into the system to design, modify and configure it to meet the ever-changing demands of the business as the consumption of media continues to change.\n\nManage » Manage & Orchestrate » Content & Workflow Management » End-to-end supply chain solutions »\n\nMediaPulse\n\nMediaPulse is the only end-to-end software solution for the complete content lifecycle.
