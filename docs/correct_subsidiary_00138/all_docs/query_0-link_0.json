        "text": "News Facts\n\nOracle today announced that it has agreed to acquire MetaSolv Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: MSLV), a leading provider of service fulfillment operations support system (OSS) solutions for the communications and media industry, through a cash merger for $4.10 per share, or approximately $219.2 million. The agreement is subject to stockholder and regulatory approval and is expected to close in late 2006 or early 2007.\n\nMetaSolv offers communications service providers a comprehensive product set for OSS service fulfillment - including provisioning, network inventory and activation. MetaSolv's standards-based solutions support all types of services including next-generation IMS, VoIP, IPTV, IP VPN, broadband and mobile services, as well as traditional voice and data services.\n\n\"By adding a leading OSS application suite, Oracle plans to offer a fully integrated, end-to-end productized solution that will help service providers streamline the 'campaign to cash' process, optimize asset lifecycles and accelerate time-to-market of new products and services,\" said Bhaskar Gorti, Oracle Senior Vice President and General Manager of the Communications Global Business Unit. \"Conventional, customized solutions have proven inefficient, inflexible and costly. Oracle is putting service providers in control to simplify their infrastructure, deliver more services faster and drive brand loyalty.\"\n\n\"This is an exciting chapter in our business' evolution for MetaSolv customers, partners, shareholders and employees,\" said T. Curtis Holmes Jr., MetaSolv's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"The natural synergies between Oracle's and MetaSolv's premier product suites, coupled with Oracle's extensive research and development capacity, will enable us to further enhance our products and ensure our customers' continued success. It is a very beneficial business combination that will drive service-delivery innovation and leadership in the industry.\"\n\nAfter the closing of the transaction, MetaSolv's employees will join Oracle's Communications Global Business Unit."
