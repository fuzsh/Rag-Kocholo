Trouble tickets are essentially fault reports that are administered as documents. These documents are active from the time a fault is reported, during its diagnosis, and until its eventual correction. They are then generally archived to provide statistical information.\n\nA trouble ticket contains not only information about the related fault but also represents the on-going activity related to the correction of the fault. Hence a trouble ticket contains not only information about the fault (such as a description of the problem, probable cause, and time of reporting) but also status of any corrective action initiated and the current owner of the problem. Trouble tickets may be generated by telecommunications management components or through customer relationship management systems.\n\nA number of trouble ticket systems is available in the marketplace but each is accessed by a different set of APIs necessitating custom integration into an OSS. The goal of this JSR is to define a standardized API, based on J2EE, that will permit rapid deployment of commercial trouble ticket systems.\n\nThe Trouble Ticket API will meet the following functional requirements:\n\nallowing clients to create, remove, or cancel trouble tickets;\n\nallowing clients to change the values of trouble ticket parameters; and\n\nallowing clients to be informed of changes to trouble tickets via a notification mechanism.\n\nThe Trouble Ticket API specification will address the following aspects:\n\nthe specification of the Enterprise Java Beans exporting interfaces to the trouble ticket system;\n\nthe specification of the mechanism to locate the interfaces;\n\nthe specification of the XML-based messages that may be sent to, and received from, a trouble ticket system;\n\nthe specification of the strongly-typed object-based events and XML-based events emitted by a trouble ticket system; and\n\nthe specification of an event subscription mechanism.\n\n2.2 What is the target Java platform? (i.e., desktop, server, personal, embedded, card, etc.)\n\nJava 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition\n\n2.3 What need of the Java community will be addressed by the proposed specification?\n\nThere is a growing trend within telecommunications industry towards the use of J2EE for development of various aspects Operations Support Systems (OSSs). Without some form of standardization, there is a a risk of divergent specifications proliferating throughout the industry.\n\n2.4 Why isn't this need met by existing specifications?\n\nThere are no existing open Java API specifications for trouble ticket systems; existing API are vendor-specific.\n\n2.5 Please give a short description of the underlying technology or technologies:\n\nhe APIs will be defined on top of J2EE. The most important J2EE APIs for this JCP will be the following:\n\nEJB (Enterprise JavaBeans):\n\nTo facilitate the integration of OSS components, the expert group will define standard EJB interfaces.\n\nJMS (Java Message Service):\n\nBesides the ability to execute synchronous (EJB) methods calls, there is also a need to send asynchronous messages. For this, JMS will be used.\n\nJNDI (Java Naming and Directory Interface):\n\nThe specification will include standards for JNDI names.\n\n2.6 Is there a proposed package name for the API Specification? (i.e., javapi.something, org.something, etc.)\n\nThe prefix \"javax.oss\" will be used in all OSS JSRs, including those recently submitted, namely: \"OSS Quality of Service API\" and \"OSS Service Activation API\". Package names of all OSS JSRs will be co-ordinated to avoid ambiguous use.\n\n2.7 Does the proposed specification have any dependencies on specific operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices that you know of?\n\nThe specification has no dependency on operating systems, CPUs, or I/O devices.\n\n2.8 Are there any security issues that cannot be addressed by the current security model?\n\nNone is anticipated\n\n2.9 Are there any internationalization or localization issues?\n\nNo.\n\n2.10 Are there any existing specifications that might be rendered obsolete, deprecated, or in need of revision as a result of this work?\n\nNo.\n\n2.11 Please describe the anticipated schedule for the development of this specification.\n\nPublication of Community Draft: February 2001\n\nPublication of Public Draft: March 2001\n\nPublication of Final Specificaion: June 2001"
