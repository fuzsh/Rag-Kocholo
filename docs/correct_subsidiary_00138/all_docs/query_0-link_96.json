        "text": "Overview\n\nRecently, NSFOCUS CERT found that Oracle officially released a Critical Patch Update announcement (CPU) in January. A total of 413 vulnerabilities of different levels were fixed this time. This security update involves Oracle WebLogic Server, Oracle MySQL, Oracle Java SE, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Oracle HTTP Server and other commonly used products. Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply critical patch updates to fix the vulnerability as soon as possible.\n\nReference link: https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2024.html\n\nKey Vulnerabilities\n\nScreen out the vulnerabilities with great impact in this update according to product popularity and vulnerability importance.\n\nOracle WebLogic Server Security Features Bypass Vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-20927)\n\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Oracle WebLogic Server. A remote unauthenticated attacker can compromise system integrity through this vulnerability. .\n\nOracle WebLogic Server Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2024-20931)\n\nOracle WebLogic Server has an information disclosure vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker sends a special request to the affected server through T3/IIOP protocol, which may realize illegal access to critical data or full access to all data of Oracle WebLogic Server, resulting in sensitive information disclosure.\n\nOracle WebLogic Server Security Features Bypass Vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-20986)\n\nA security feature exists in Oracle WebLogic Server that bypasses a vulnerability by which remote unauthenticated attackers can compromise system integrity or disclose sensitive information after inducing victim interaction.\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities in Oracle MySQL\n\nThis security update fixes 40 vulnerabilities for Oracle MySQL, 12 of which can be exploited remotely without user authentication (i.e., through the network without user credentials). High-risk vulnerabilities are numbered as follows:\n\nCVE-2023-38545\n\nCVE-2023-50164\n\nCVE-2023-5363\n\nCVE-2023-5363\n\nCVE-2023-46589\n\nCVE-2023-5363\n\nCVE-2023-5363\n\nCVE-2023-5363\n\nCVE-2023-41105\n\nMultiple vulnerabilities in Oracle Financial Services Applications:\n\nThis security update fixes 71 vulnerabilities for Oracle Financial Services Applications. Fifty-four of these vulnerabilities were remotely exploitable without user authentication. High-risk vulnerabilities are numbered as follows:\n\nCVE-2023-46604\n\nCVE-2022-42920\n\nCVE-2023-24998\n\nCVE-2022-34169\n\nCVE-2023-24998\n\nThe vulnerabilities in the key patch update of Oracle official website in January are summarized as follows:\n\nMitigation\n\nPatch update\n\nPlease refer to the Appendix “Affected Products and Patch Information” in this document to download the affected product update patch in time, and install and update it by referring to the readme file in the patch installation package to ensure long-term effective protection.\n\nNote: The official patch of Oracle requires the user to have a licensed account of genuine software. After logging in https://support.oracle.com with this account, you can download the latest patch.\n\nTemporary Weblogic Protection Measures\n\n1. Restrict T3 protocol access\n\nThe following measures can be used to block attacks that exploit T3 protocol vulnerabilities if the user is temporarily unable to install patches or communicate with the JVM via the T3 protocol:\n\nWebLogic Server provides a default connection filter named weblogic.security.net.ConnectionFilterImpl, which accepts all incoming connections. Access control can be performed on T3 and T3s protocols through the configuration rules of this connection filter. The detailed operation steps are as follows:\n\n1) Go to the WebLogic console. On the configuration page of base_domain, go to the Security tab page and click Filters to configure connection filters.\n\n2) Enter weblogic.security.net.ConnectionFilterImpl in the connection filter, and configure rules conforming to the actual situation of the enterprise in the connection filter rule by referring to the following writing:\n\n3) If the rule does not take effect after saving, it is recommended to restart the WebLogic service (restarting the WebLogic service will cause business interruption. It is recommended that relevant personnel assess the risk before proceeding). Taking the Windows environment as an example, the steps to restart the service are as follows: Enter the bin directory under the directory where the domain is located, run stopWebLogic.cmd file in Windows system to terminate WebLogic service, and run stopWebLogic.sh file in Linux system.\n\nAfter the termination script is executed, run the startWebLogic.cmd or startWebLogic.sh file to start WebLogic to restart the WebLogic service.\n\nReference link: https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E24329_01/web.1211/e24485/con_filtr.htm#SCPRG377\n\n2. Disable IIOP protocol\n\nUsers can block attacks that exploit IIOP protocol vulnerabilities by disabling the IIOP protocol as follows: In the WebLogic console, choose Services > AdminServer > Protocol and uncheck Enable IIOP. Restart the WebLogic project to make the configuration take effect.\n\nAffected Products and Patches\n\nStatement\n\nThis advisory is only used to describe a potential risk.
