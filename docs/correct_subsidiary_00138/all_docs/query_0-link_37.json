        "text": "Added Support for IPv6 Address Management\n\nMetaSolv Solution now supports Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) address management.\n\nAn increasing need for IP addresses resulted in the development of IPv6, which offers a large address space. Mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other wireless devices need Internet access, and each device requires its own unique IP address.\n\nIPv6 offers extended address length, thus eliminating the need to use other techniques, such as network address translation, to prevent the exhausting of available address space. IPv6 contains addressing and control information to route packets for the next-generation Internet.\n\nThe IPv6 prefix notation is similar to the way IPv4 addresses are written in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation. The notation appends the prefix length, written as a number of bits preceded by a slash.\n\nMetaSolv Solution supports the following types of IPv6 addresses:\n\nLocal Unicast addresses: A Local Unicast address may be created by an organization (or an individual) for use in its private networks or intranets. It is not routable on the Internet; however, a private IPv6 network needs to be unique within the private network or the intranet on which it is used.\n\nGlobal Unicast addresses: A Global Unicast address is allocated by an Regional Internet Registry (RIR) to an organization or an individual (known as the owner). It is routable on the Internet; therefore, it has to be globally unique. It is a unique address assigned to each IPv6 interface on the Internet.\n\nAn IPv6 Global Unicast address is a combination of the following components:\n\nGlobal Routing Prefix (m bits - usually 48 bits): Identifies the IPv6 network; Assigned by an RIR to a site.\n\nSubnet ID (n bits - usually 16 bits): Identifies the IPv6 sub-network (subnet) within the site; Assigned by the site administrator.\n\nInterface ID (128-m-n bits - usually 64 bits): Identifies an IPv6 interface (homed within an IPv6 host) in the network. The Interface ID is represented as 128 bits minus the lengths of the Global Routing Prefix (m bits) and the Subnet ID (n bits).\n\nMetaSolv Solution displays IPv6 addresses using the standard notation, which represents the IPv6 address as eight 16-bit hexadecimal words separated by a colon (:). IPv6 addresses can also be represented in compressed notation, which uses a double colon (::) to represent a single contiguous group of zero fields in an IPv6 address. You can use the compressed notation when entering IPv6 addresses.\n\nFor example, the following are valid IPv6 addresses:\n\n2001:0db8:0000:cd30:0000:0000:0000:0000/60\n\n2001:0db8::cd30:0:0:0:0/60\n\n2001:0db8:0:cd30::/60\n\nThe /60 is the appended prefix length.\n\nThe new MetaSolv Solution Internal IPv6 Management functionality enables you to efficiently manage your IPv6 address inventory. MetaSolv Solution provides a tree view of your IPv6 address inventory as well as tools that enable you to group your inventory to make address retrieval easier. By expanding the tree, you can see the base IPv6 addresses, the subnets you created, and the subnet properties.\n\nThe new MetaSolv Solution IPv6 Address Management functionality lets you do the following:\n\nCreate base networks: The base network (basenet) is the IPv6 address an Internet service provider (ISP) receives from a regulatory body or an upstream ISP. ISPs use their basenet as their starting point. The ISPs enter the basenet into their systems and create more subnets using this basenet.\n\nCreate subnets: A subnet is a sub-network or division of a single base IP address. When creating a subnet, you divide the available addresses within the network. You can also divide a subnet into more subnets.\n\nCreate IP pools: An IP pool is a block of addresses from which you can create subnets. You create IP pools from a block of free hosts in a basenet or another IP pool. When you further divide a subnet, the addresses that remain are placed into an IP pool. The difference between an IP pool and a subnet is that you cannot assign/allocate an IP pool; whereas you can assign/allocate a subnet and any of its hosts.\n\nCombine subnets: You can create a large block of IP addresses by combining two or more subnets into a single address block. Combining subnets gives you additional IP addresses available for assignment. When you combine subnets, the hosts within each subnet are removed. You can manually create hosts within the combined subnet.\n\nThe following rules apply to combining subnets:\n\nThe addresses in the subnets must be contiguous and in Unassigned status.\n\nThe subnets' hosts must be in Unassigned status.\n\nThe subnets must fall within valid bit boundaries.\n\nDelete a base network, subnet, or IP pool: You can delete the created base network, subnet, or IP pool.\n\nThe rules for deleting a basenet, subnet, or IP pool are as follows:\n\nYou can delete a basenet only if all of its subnets and the subnets' hosts are in Unassigned status. When you delete a basenet, all the addresses are physically removed from the inventory. This action cannot be undone.\n\nYou can delete subnets individually or in multiples by clicking each subnet, which places a red check mark beside it. The subnets you select for deletion must be in the same basenet or IP pool. Deleting a subnet removes only its definition and reinstates the addresses to the parent IP pool/basenet.\n\nYou can delete an IP pool only if all of its host addresses are in Pooled status and all of its subnets are in Unassigned status. Deleting an IP pool removes only its definition and reinstates the addresses to the parent IP pool/basenet.\n\nDesignate planned usage of IPv6 addresses with use groups and use codes: Use groups and use codes are user-defined labels that provide the ability to efficiently organize your IP address inventory. Define use groups; define one or more use codes within each use group, and then associate these labels to the IP address inventory. When you search for IP addresses, you can filter the search based on use groups/use codes and view only the addresses associated with these labels.\n\nPreset filter for searching for IPv6 addresses by functional area: A functional area is a module of MetaSolv Solution from which you can search for IP addresses. The functional areas are as follows:\n\nOrdering\n\nEquipment Inventory\n\nNetwork Areas\n\nVirtual Layout Record (VLR)\n\nYou can associate use groups/use codes with functional areas. After you associate use groups/use codes with a functional area, the process of retrieving unassigned IP addresses becomes much easier. For example, by associating the use group with the Ordering functional area, you can limit the number of IP addresses that can be retrieved in a search. This enables you to view only a subset of the IP address inventory to select for the order.\n\nSearch for existing IPv6 addresses: You can search for existing IP addresses based on status, network area, use group, use code, and customer details. You can also search for IP addresses by specifying wild cards (%). For example, LIKE 2001:0db8%.\n\nRecall IPv6 addresses for reuse: When IP addresses are returned as part of an order to disconnect service, the addresses are put into PendDisc (pending disconnect) status until the due date for the order has been completed. At that time, the IP addresses are put into Transitional status and cannot be acted upon until the time period specified in the IP Address Transition Days preference has elapsed. After the elapsed time, you must recall the address block to make it available for subnetting or reassignment.\n\nThe recall function creates new records (in Unassigned or Pooled status) and archives the used records in Unavailable status for history.\n\nThe IP Address Transition Days preference is located under Preferences - Application Setup - Internet Services.\n\nDepending on the setting of the When recalling a disconnected subnet preference, the recall process either retains or deletes the IPv6 subnet addresses. The When recalling a disconnected subnet preference is located under Preferences - Application Setup - Internet Services.\n\nIf the subnet to which the addresses belonged is retained, the status of the IP addresses changes to Unassigned.\n\nIf the subnet to which the addresses belonged is deleted, the addresses are returned to the subnet's parent IP pool and the status of the addresses changes to Pooled.\n\nTrack lifecycle of an IPv6 address: You can track the lifecycle of an IPv6 address that is in any of the following statuses:\n\nUnassigned: The IP address is part of a subnet and is available for assignment.\n\nPending: The IP address has been assigned and is associated with an open order, but the subnet has not been placed in service.\n\nIn Service: The IP address is currently in service and is being billed to a customer.\n\nUnavailable: The IP address has been taken out of service, the transitional period has elapsed, and the IP address has been recalled for reuse. The recall process archives this record for historical purposes. The archived record will remain in Unavailable status indefinitely.\n\nPendDisc: The IP address is associated with a disconnect service request and is scheduled to be disconnected.\n\nPooled: The IP address has 0 (zero) subnet bits, has been specified as an IP pool, or is defined as a single subnet under another subnet.\n\nTransitional: The IP address has been taken out of service and is in a transitional period that may or may not have elapsed.\n\nReserve IPv6 addresses: You can reserve IP address subnets for internal use and for a specific customer. You can also set the reservation to expire after a specified duration.\n\nAssociate IPv6 addresses to network areas: You can select available IP addresses from the ISP's number inventory and associate these IP addresses with a network area for provisioning to customers. The number of IP addresses associated with a given network area can be based on, for example, projected usage in that area based on population or the amount of equipment assigned to that network area. You can associate additional IP addresses with network areas at any time through Application Setup when additional IP addresses need to be made available.\n\nSpecify IPv6 addresses for network elements and network systems: You can specify IPv6 addresses for network elements and network systems. To support this enhancement, the length of the Mgmt IP Addr field has been increased to support IPv6 addresses. The Mgmt IP Addr field lets you enter an IPv4 or IPv6 address. With this enhancement, the IP addresses are saved in the same format in which they are entered. You must enter a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address.\n\nNote:\n\nMetaSolv Solution does not support IP rules and IP reports for IPv6.\n\nSee the Help for more information.\n\nAuto-Generated Allocation Parameters Fall Within the Defined Range\n\nPrior to this enhancement, an auto-generated allocation parameter assigned to a newly-added hard connection in the virtual schematic design may fall outside the range defined in the MetaSolv Solution Utility application. For example, if you defined the range for the auto-generated allocation parameters from 100 to 4095, and if the maximum value (4095) was already assigned to a hard connection, the newly-added hard connection was assigned an auto-generated allocation parameter value of zero (0), which was not within the defined range.\n\nIn this enhancement, when assigning auto-generated allocation parameters to a newly-added hard connection in the virtual schematic design, if the maximum value (for example, 4095) has already been assigned to a hard connection, the application auto-generates a lowest unassigned value (for example, 105) starting from the minimum value (for example, 100) of the defined range for allocation parameters. In essence, the application utilizes the unassigned values between the minimum and maximum values of the defined range when assigning auto-generated allocation parameters.\n\nImproved Work Management Usability\n\nThe following updates have been made as part of this enhancement:\n\nSingle View for All Work Queues Owned By a User\n\nThis enhancement enables you to view all the tasks of all of your personal work queues in a single view in the Work Queue Manager window. To enable this, a new work queue option, <All>, has been added, which displays all the tasks of all the personal work queues owned by the logged in user. You can add the work queue ID as a viewable column and define a view so that the corresponding work queue ID is displayed in the Work Queue Manager window. The number of tasks retrieved in the Work Queue Manager window is based on the Maximum Number of Rows to Retrieve in the Queue Manager preference under Preferences - Work Management - Work Queue Management.\n\nAbility to View All Work Queues in the Work Queue Manager\n\nThis enhancement enables an administrative user to view the tasks in any defined work queue in the Work queue manager. In the Work Queue Manager window, a new radio button, All, has been added, which when selected, displays all work queue IDs in the Work Queue list. The All radio button is protected by the security checkpoint, View All Work Queues, under Work Management in the Security Permissions window. You do not have access to this radio button by default.\n\nUser-Definable Task Attributes\n\nThe existing Task label functionality has been enhanced to add additional task label fields that provide you the ability to define additional attributes for a task. You can view and edit these task labels in the Work Queue Manager window. These task labels can be secured individually in the Security Permissions window. This enhancement also provides display/sort/filter capabilities on these attributes in the Work Queue Manager window. You can manually enter additional information about tasks or auto-populate these task labels through custom extensions or other custom code.\n\nIn the Work Queue Manager window, the existing Task Label right-click option has been renamed as Task Labels, which when selected, displays the Task Labels window. In the Task Labels window, you can enter or edit values for the task labels.\n\nA new system preference, Task Label Headers, has been added under Preferences - Work Management - Work Queue Management. This preference contains 15 Task Label fields and five Task Label (Date) fields. Using this preference, you can enter the Label Text/Header, which is the same for all the users. Only those task labels that have Label text/header defined are available for edit in the Work Queue Manager window. You can modify the existing views or define new views to include the newly-added task labels. The existing views need not be modified if you are not using the new task labels.\n\nAbility to Add Gateway Events and Checklist Items to Tasks\n\nPrior to this enhancement, you could not add checklist items and gateway events to a task when assigning the provisioning plan on an order. This enhancement enables you to do the following when assigning a provisioning plan to an order:\n\nAdd checklist items to newly-added tasks.\n\nAdd gateway events to the newly-added tasks and to the existing tasks.\n\nA new tab, Task Checklist, has been added in both the Task Generation and Task Maintenance windows. The Task Checklist tab allows you to select a particular task from the Newly Added Task list and add the checklist items to the selected task. After the checklist items are added to the task, the checklist items are displayed in the Checklists tab in Work Queue Manager window.\n\nA new right-click option, Add Gateway Events, has been added in both the Task Generation and Task Maintenance windows. This option allows you to add gateway events to the tasks. After the gateway events are added to the tasks, the gateway events are displayed in Gateway Events tab of the Task Generation and Task Maintenance windows.\n\nAbility to Run Rules and Behaviors at Process Supplement\n\nThe Rules and Behaviors functionality has been enhanced to allow the Rules and Behaviors to be invoked when an order is supplemented. This enhancement allows the tasks to be added dynamically through Rules and Behaviors for an order through the supplement process.\n\nIn this enhancement, two new process points, Process Supp and Task Generation and Process Supp, have been added in the following lists:\n\nWhen do you want the action to occur? list in the Task Behavior window.\n\nWhen do you want the event to occur? list in the Gateway Event Behavior window.\n\nYou can create Rules and Behaviors using the Task Generation and Process Supp process point if you want the rule to be invoked during both task generation and order supplement. You can create Rules and Behaviors using the Process Supp process point if you want the rule to be invoked only during order supplement.\n\nJurisdiction Code Displayed Beside Provisioning Plan Name\n\nIn this enhancement, the jurisdiction code is also displayed beside the provisioning plan name in the header of the Provisioning Plan window. This enables you to view the jurisdiction code even when you are viewing other tabs, such as PERT Chart, Task Checklist, and so on, instead of navigating to the Provisioning Plan tab every time you want to view the jurisdiction code.\n\nTask Start Time Displayed in the Work Queue Manager\n\nPrior to this enhancement, in the Work Queue Manager, only the task due date for each of the tasks was displayed, but the information about when to start a task was not displayed. As a result, the processing of the tasks was started late, leaving the tasks in jeopardy.\n\nIn this enhancement, in the Work Queue Manager window, a new column, Task Start Date, has been added, which displays the scheduled start date of a task. This enables the user to start the processing of the tasks on time.\n\nAbility to Expedite Work Intervals for Tasks in the Provisioning Plan\n\nPrior to this enhancement, if the total standard duration in the provisioning plan was greater than the available duration required to complete the order, the tasks at the beginning of the provisioning plan utilized their entire allotted time and the tasks at the end were stacked because they were unable to utilize their full allotted time (work interval).\n\nThis enhancement improves the task generation process within MetaSolv Solution for expedited orders by automatically reducing the duration of various tasks on the order when the time to complete the order is less than the standard interval set up in the provisioning plan.\n\nFor example, consider a provisioning plan that contains 7 tasks. Each task has a work interval of 5 days so the total task interval is 35 days. When this provisioning plan is assigned to an order that has a due date of 30 September 2010 and the current date is 15 September 2010, the available duration in the order is 16 days, but the tasks need 35 days to complete. In this scenario, the tasks at the end of the provisioning plan are stacked because they are unable to utilize their full allotted time (work interval).\n\nThis enhancement prevents the tasks from being stacked at the end of the provisioning plan by expediting the total standard duration. To expedite a particular task, you can specify a value in the newly added Expedited Work Days, Expedited Work Hours, or Expedited Work Minutes fields in the Provisioning Plan Window - Task Assignments tab, Provisioning Plan Window - Task Dependencies tab, or Rules and Behaviors - Task behavior window. If a task cannot be expedited, the Expedited Work Days, Expedited Work Hours, and Expedited Work Minutes fields can be left blank.\n\nWhen the tasks are generated, if the total standard duration in the provisioning plan is greater than the available duration in the order, the expedited work interval is considered instead of the standard duration; as a result, the tasks are not stacked at the end of the provisioning plan.\n\nNote:\n\nThis new functionality to expedite work intervals when generating tasks is also supported by MSS APIs.\n\nEnhanced Application Usability\n\nThe following updates have been made as part of this enhancement:\n\nAdded Last Modified User and Date Information in Connection Design Window\n\nIn this enhancement, in the Connection Design Window - Connection Summary View and Connection Design Search window, two new fields, Modified By and Modified Date, have been added. The Modified By field displays the last modified user ID for both the new and old issues if you select Save as New Issue in the Connection Design window. The Modified Date field displays the last modified date and time for both the new and old issues if you select Save as New Issue in the Connection Design window.\n\nAdded Material Code as a Search Criteria in Equipment Spec Search\n\nThis enhancement enables you to search for an equipment specification using material code in the Equipment Spec Search window.\n\nIn this enhancement, a new search criteria, Material Code, has been added that enables you to specify the material code of an equipment specification when searching for equipment specifications. In the Equipment Spec Search - Results window, a new Material Code column has been added that enables you to sort equipment specifications based on material code.\n\nAdded Rate Center as a Search Criteria in Telephone Number Reservation Search\n\nThis enhancement enables you to search for telephone numbers by specifying the Network Area (Rate Center) in the Telephone Number Reservation Search window.\n\nIn this enhancement, in the Telephone Number Reservation Search window, a new radio button, Network Area, has been added that enables you to search for telephone numbers by specifying Network Area (Rate Center) as one of the search criteria. If you select Network Area in the Telephone Number Reservation Search window, you must select a network area from the Network Area Name list.\n\nAbility to Copy Information From PRILOC Tab to the SECLOC Tab On a PSR Order\n\nPrior to this enhancement, if you wanted to specify the same end user location information on PRILOC and SECLOC, the information entered on the PRILOC had to be repeated in SECLOC location information as the PRILOC information could not be copied to the SECLOC until the PRILOC was saved. To achieve this, you had to enter the PRILOC end user location and save it. Then, open the PRILOC/SECLOC window again and use the same PRILOC information. This process was time consuming.\n\nIn this enhancement, a new check box, Copy from Priloc, has been added in the SECLOC tab - End User view. When adding PRILOC/SECLOC information on a PSR order, if the SECLOC end-user information is the same as PRILOC end-user information, you can select the Copy from Priloc check box in the SECLOC tab - End User view. All the information on the PRILOC tab is copied to the SECLOC tab. The Copy from Priloc check box enables you to populate the fields on the SECLOC tab without reentering repetitive information.\n\nNew Preference to Default Order types in Child Order Search Window\n\nIn this enhancement, a new user preference, Default Order types in Child Order Search, has been added under Preferences - Service Request. This preference allows you to select the default order types in Child Order Search window of the Service Request Hierarchy window. This preference lists the order types: ASR, LSR, DSR, ISR, EWO, and PSR with a check box for each order type. If you do not select any of the check boxes in the Default Order types in Child Order Search preference, the ASR check box is selected by default in the Child Order Search window.\n\nAdditional Automation Capabilities\n\nThe following updates have been made as part of this enhancement:\n\nAbility to Automate the Provisioning of Facility Circuits\n\nMetaSolv Solution now provides the ability to automate the provisioning of non-templated DS1 and DS0 Facility circuits (CLF and OTF) through the newly-added AUTODSGN system task.\n\nWhile the AUTODSGN task does provide an out-of-the-box algorithm to determine both an originating and terminating port assignment, along with a channel assignment to a supporting coterminous parent facility, its full potential is realized when executed along with the included Connection Design > DS0/DS1 Automated Design custom extension.\n\nBy providing a custom extension, custom logic may be written to determine the appropriate design assignments, based upon unique business requirements. The custom logic will only be responsible for determining which assignments to make (channel, port, network, cable pair, and so on), as the core application logic is responsible for creating the design issues, making the assignments, building the appropriate design blocks, as well as saving and issuing the designs. See MetaSolv Solution Custom Extensions Developer's Reference for more information.\n\nSee the Help for more information about the AUTODSGN task.\n\nAbility to Automate the Generation of Connection IDs\n\nMetaSolv Solution now provides the ability to auto-generate connection IDs for CIRCUIT, INTRNCKT, and CONNECTOR products ordered on a Product Service Request, by expanding the capability of the existing CKTID task.\n\nWhen executed by the System Task Server, the CKTID task will generate Connection IDs in either CLF or CLS format for traditional Facility and Special circuits, while it will generate an OTS-formatted Connection ID for template-based connections.\n\nThis capability may also be expanded to adhere to specific naming standards by implementing custom Connection ID generation logic through the newly-available Connection ID Automation custom extension. In addition to the three Connection ID formats listed above (CLF, CLS, and OTS), the logic also supports the creation of an OTF-formatted connection when generated through the custom extension.\n\nThe automated CKTID task generates the connection ID using the input values returned by the Connection ID Automation extension. See MetaSolv Solution Custom Extensions Developer's Reference for detailed parameter-level information.\n\nWhen the Connection ID Automation extension is not defined, the default out-of-the-box functionality is executed.\n\nSee the Help for more information about the CKTID task.\n\nEnhanced Support for Virtual Connections\n\nThe following updates have been made as part of this enhancement:\n\nAllow Multiple Soft Connections Within Virtual Schematic Design\n\nThis enhancement provides the ability to design a virtual connection using multiple soft connections, which may be placed anywhere within the schematic design. This capability is enabled by a new Add Soft Intermediate Connection option within the right-click menu, which allows you to designate the terminating component of the soft connection.\n\nThis capability allows you to add a soft intermediate connection between the entry (ingress) and exit (egress) nodes of networks for which the circuit designer does not want to model with permanent connectivity, which will therefore not require a redesign as a result of network changes.\n\nWhen the new Add Soft Intermediate Connection right-click option is selected, a new Available Nodes window is displayed, which allows you to designate the terminating component. This window is preloaded with the complete list of network components contained within the same networks as the originating component of the soft connection, listed by the containing network system. Initially, only nodes with connectivity outside of the selected network are displayed to limit the result set. To display all nodes within the selected network, deselect the Only Display Internetworking Nodes check box. A new Network Component Search window, opened by clicking the Search button, is also available to search for any network component that may not be in the preloaded list.\n\nSupport Partial Redesign of Virtual Connections\n\nThis release extensively improves the usability within the schematic design of virtual connections by allowing you to remove any segment within the entire path of the design during all phases of the design process. Prior to this release, only a limited number of scenarios enabled the Remove Connection option, which required you to perform a complete redesign of the connection when only a partial redesign was necessary.\n\nWhen a connection is removed from the design, the originating and terminating components of this connection are also removed, but only if these components are not connected to any other components by an existing hard or soft connection; the originating and terminating components defined for the connection will never be removed.\n\nBy not requiring a complete redesign of the connection, this new capability considerably reduces the time and effort necessary to modify the path of a virtual connection, which leads to increased productivity.\n\nAbility to Order Virtual Connections on an Engineering Work Order\n\nPrior to this release, you were required to create an Internal Service Request (ISR) to manage virtual connections for internal orders. This release expands the capability of an Engineering Work Order (EWO) to now include virtual connections, which gives you another option.\n\nYou can create new virtual connections within an EWO by clicking the new Virtual hyperlink within the Create New section of the Actions panel found within the Manage Connections page. This opens the Connection Identification window, which allows you to define and name the virtual connection.\n\nIn addition, the existing functionality to Change and Disconnect connections has been enhanced to support changing and disconnecting virtual connections. The order supplement process has also been enhanced to support virtual connections.\n\nUnlike PSR, you are not required to enter the Connection Specification within the order. This information, along with all of the associated custom attributes, can be maintained within Connection Design after the connection has been created/added on the order.\n\nEnhanced Network Grooming Capabilities\n\nThe following updates have been made as part of this enhancement:\n\nAdded Support for Grooming All Template-Based Connections (Including Virtuals)\n\nPrior to this release, the Network Grooming tool only supported the maintenance of port and channel assignments for traditional Facility, Special, and Trunk circuits, in addition to switch grooming for telephone numbers. In this release, the Network Grooming tool has been enhanced to support all template-based connections, including virtuals, enabling you to manage allocations to and from parent bandwidth connections. Unlike physical connections, any changes to virtual connections made within the grooming workspace will be reflected within the schematic design view of Connection Design once the grooming order has been processed.\n\nAs virtual connections do not occupy a specific channel on a parent connection, the Network Grooming tool provides the ability to manage the individual allocation parameters (stored as Custom Attributes) for each parent to child relationship, when applicable.\n\nTo enable this capability, a new Specify Virtual Channel... right-click option has been added within the Maintenance and Connection Hierarchy views of the Groom Maintenance window. Allocation parameters are also auto-generated during the Groom To step if the template is set up to provide this capability.\n\nWhen making design changes for template-based connections within the grooming workspace, you are prevented from making assignments that would break the rules defined for the connection spec of the connection being modified.\n\nIn addition to managing virtual connection allocations to parent bandwidth connections, the Network Grooming tool has been enhanced to also support the ability to allocate physical circuits to bandwidth connections using circuit emulation, which are represented by bandwidth blocks on the DLR within Connection Design."
