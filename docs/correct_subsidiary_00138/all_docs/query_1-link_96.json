MetaSolv Solution is here today as a result of the wide range of doors that the industry has opened.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-17\n\nThe MetaSolv Solution consists of a set of subsystems integrated by a common repository of business data and processes. Each subsystem supports a critical aspect of the telecom industry: •\n\nOSS Gateway Management\n\n•\n\nCustomer Care\n\n•\n\nNetwork Design\n\n•\n\nService Provisioning\n\n•\n\nOrder Management\n\n•\n\nTrouble Management\n\n•\n\nWork Management\n\n•\n\nData Management\n\n•\n\nSecurity\n\nEach subsystem can be extended with add-on modules to tailor it to support unique products and services, such as resale or wholesale-based products that provide local or long distance services. The subsystems can also support network technologies, such as wireless radio or SONET. This class will be a journey through these subsystems. You will wear many hats throughout the next few days. You will be an engineer, a customer service representative, a problem solver, an administrator, and perhaps, all of these rolled into one! Before you log on, to MetaSolv Solution lets discuss the subsystems and each role that you will play.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-18\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nOSS GATEWAY MANAGEMENT Slide 6 OSS Gateway Management The MetaSolv Solution is developed on an open architecture that recognizes the need to electronically exchange information with a wide array of systems, such as the managed network, other enterprise systems, and external trading or service partners and their operations support systems.\n\nFigure 2\n\nOSS Gateway Management\n\nThis Application Programming Interface (API) architecture enables companies to achieve their goals of flow-through provisioning and interconnection, which helps them take advantage of powerful new opportunities. The integration that the APIs provide forms a solid foundation for revenue assurance activities.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-19\n\nCUSTOMER CARE Slide 7 Customer Care One of the key architectural features of MetaSolv’s approach is a high degree of integration of customer information.\n\nFigure 3\n\nCustomer Care\n\nThis Integrated Telecom Information Architecture maintains key relationships between customers and the full scope of their involvement with the business. This architecture supports the ability to view the customer from the many angles that are important to managing and growing the customer relationship. In your training, you will access this subsystem to enter basic customer information, work a trouble ticket, and enter a variety of service requests.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-20\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nNETWORK DESIGN Slide 8 Network Design MetaSolv Solution Network Design subsystem is powerful enough to handle large telecom networks and flexible enough to manage a mix of both old and new telecommunications technologies.\n\nFigure 4\n\nNetwork Design\n\nThis subsystem brings together the geographical, physical, electrical, and logical dimensions of the network into a single, cohesive view that is supported by a set of integrated equipment administration and network design modules. When you access the Network Design subsystem, you will use it to view, install, delete, and move different types of equipment. You will also create some SONET networks and network routes as well.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-21\n\nSERVICE PROVISIONING Slide 9 Service Provisioning The integration of the Service Provisioning subsystem with the Order Management and Network Design subsystems provides an accurate view of what the customer ordered and what your network can support when deciding how to design or provision the service.\n\nFigure 5\n\nService Provisioning\n\nBecause the Network Design subsystem supports network components from a variety of sources, the Service Provisioning subsystem enables you to build the end-to-end circuit design. You will access this subsystem after you have processed the orders for service. Service Provisioning is the subsystem that is designed to give you a checklist of steps to complete when you design and activate the networks and circuits.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-22\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nORDER MANAGEMENT Slide 10\n\nOrder Management The MetaSolv Solution's Order Management subsystem enables you to manage the end-to-end service delivery process that can often involve more than one type of order or transaction across your organization, as well as with other service providers or network providers.\n\nFigure 6\n\nOrder Management\n\nAt the core of the MetaSolv Solution Order Management subsystem is flexible service request architecture. This architecture captures the components of today’s complex customer requirements and enables you to create and manage multiple types of orders. Not only will you enter many different types of orders in the Order Management section of this training, but you will also learn about cataloging equipment specifications and designing some ordered circuits.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-23\n\nTROUBLE MANAGEMENT Slide 11\n\nTrouble Management MetaSolv Solution Trouble Management subsystem is integrated with Order Management, Service Provisioning, and Network Design, which results in one, comprehensive, consistent view of who the customers are, what services you provide them, and how you provide those services. When you get into this facet of the training, you will learn how to open, respond to, refer, and close trouble tickets.\n\nFigure 7\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nTrouble Management\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-24\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nWORK MANAGEMENT Slide 12\n\nWork Management The MetaSolv Solution Work Management subsystem brings all of the pieces together, enabling work to flow electronically across the organization, providing visibility to your processes and resource utilization.\n\nFigure 8\n\nWork Management\n\nThe Work Management subsystem provides the capability to maintain provisioning plans, which are groups of “tasks”, needed to manage the flow of work and information. You can cause provisioning plans for common order types and customize them to add unique tasks to fulfill a specific request. You will create and select the provisioning plans for the various orders that you enter in MetaSolv Solution.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-25\n\nDATA MANAGEMENT Slide 13\n\nData Management The Data Management component of the MetaSolv Solution maintains reference data about your business, its structure, and other information required to ensure quality and integrity throughout the business process.\n\nFigure 9\n\nData Management\n\nThis central repository of essential reference, or infrastructure data, ensures quality and integrity throughout the business processes that MetaSolv Solution supports. Later, you will actually go into Infrastructure and create a city, a LATA for that city, an organizational structure, and many more components required to activate a network.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-26\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nSECURITY Slide 14\n\nSecurity At the outset, all users have permission to access the entire product, except for the security windows that are protected.\n\nFigure 10\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity administration involves adding groups and users and restricting those groups and users from using various parts of the MetaSolv Solution product line.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\nAT\n\nTHE\n\nEND\n\n2-27\n\nOF THIS\n\nCOURSE\n\nIn a few moments, you will be on a journey through the MetaSolv Solution subsystems. This journey will lead you to your final goal, which will be a Final Bootcamp Obstacle Course, with you as the sole owner of a phone company. In this final obstacle course you will complete a variety of exercises, from setting up ACTLs to provisioning some orders, from designing networks, to even taking care of some trouble along the way. So, you have some work ahead of you. For starters, as a company executive, you have chosen to purchase MetaSolv Solution from MetaSolv Software, Inc. On top of that, you need to learn how to use the MetaSolv Solution to successfully complete the exercises.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-28\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nBOOTCAMP ROADMAP Slide 15\n\nIN\n\nMETASOLV SOLUTION SOFTWARE\n\nRoadmap Bootcamp is designed to give you a high-level training about the effects of MetaSolv Solution on the telecom world. This class has been arranged to give you a working knowledge of telecom (as you learned in Unit 1) and how the MetaSolv Solution relates to the industry. Suppose you are at home and you have decided to form a phone company. Congratulations! You have made the decision to become a phone company! What is it going to take to be competitive and successful? Well, for starters, you need to purchase MetaSolv Solution.\n\nFIRST STOP—PREPARE Slide 16\n\nTHE\n\nMETASOLV SOLUTION\n\nAdministrator Hat Now that you have the software, what are you going to do with it?\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTO THE\n\nMETASOLV SOLUTION\n\nEveryone in your company needs to know the basics. You will learn the basics of the software that is, the navigational techniques, various windows and fields, and how to use online help.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-29\n\nINFRASTRUCTURE SUBSYSTEM Then put on your administrator hat because you need to load your company information, create some office locations, create some city statistics, and LATA information. As an administrator you will be entering all of this data in the Infrastructure subsystem.\n\nSECURITY Also, as an administrator, since you have so many departments doing different things, you definitely want to ensure that they work only in their perspective areas of the software. If the wrong person ends up manipulating the system in areas in which they don’t belong, then this can really cost you some revenue because of the time it takes to recover the lost or changed data. You need some security control!\n\nWORK MANAGEMENT After you set up your company basics and secured the software the way you like, you are just about finished plugging in your basic information. But, one more thing needs to be done while you still have your administrator hat on.

It is not a true Web-based functionality, but merely a navigational tool on top of the application. QuickLinks is included as part of the standard MetaSolv Solution application. MetaSolv or another professional service organization performs any desired customization of the HTML page. QuickLinks is optional functionality controlled by MetaSolv Solution preferences.\n\nPREFERENCES The global and user preferences reference the file location of the HTML page. • The global preference provides that all MetaSolv Solution users access the same HTML page. • The user preference provides a customized HTML page for every specific user.\n\nDEFAULT FUNCTIONALITY The QuickLinks page makes a variety of functions available:\n\nENTER\n\nA\n\n•\n\nEnter a New\n\n•\n\nQuery For\n\n•\n\nService Requests\n\n•\n\nLinks\n\nNEW QuickLinks supports creating new service requests, displaying recently edited service requests and tasks, plus links from other applications or websites. You can create a new PSR, ASR, ISR, LSR, or Trouble Ticket from a button on the HTML page. Without QuickLinks, you would select the Customer Care button, the Service Requests button, and the New button.

It houses all of a company’s basic information. The first thing a company does when it purchases MetaSolv Solution is set up shop. They will plug in all data, such as Network Location, addresses, and any other “backbone” information. Their Infrastructure input is the glue that holds the company’s information together.\n\nOBJECTIVES Slide 25\n\nLesson Objectives Given an instructor lecture, you will be able to explain the basics for setting up your company Infrastructure, as well as explain the concepts of the Infrastructure preferences. Follow-up exercises will confirm your success.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-40\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nENTER YOUR INFORMATION HERE Congratulations! You have decided to purchase MetaSolv Solution from MetaSolv Software, Inc.! So what are you going to do next? At this time you, as an administrator, need to enter all of your information into the MetaSolv Solution so that you will be able to take some orders and provide some service to clients. So, where are you going to enter this information? Infrastructure. Because of dependencies, you must enter the information into infrastructure in a certain order. That information comes from three main sources: • and Telcordia\n\nPreloaded data from Metasolv\n\n• Guide, or LERG\n\nThe Local Exchange and Routing\n\n•\n\nManually entered data\n\n• Figure 11\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\nOrigin of Infrastructure Data\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-41\n\nTHE LERG CD Slide 26\n\nLERG The Location Routing Gateway allows data to be imported from Telcordia’s Local Exchange Routing Guide (LERG) into the MetaSolv Solution Infrastructure subsystem. Because the LERG contains such a large volume of data and is very time consuming to load, some MetaSolv Solution customers elect not to load the entire LERG CD. Regardless of how much of the LERG a company decides to use, it is considered best business practice to utilize the LERG to acquire the necessary data for the MetaSolv Solution’s Infrastructure. When a company does load the LERG CD, the data that the LERG loads is pretty much “all or nothing.” They can, however, specify or narrow the amount of data that is loaded by selecting specific states to be loaded.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-42\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nDATA CONTAINED IN THE LERG The data contained in the LERG is shown in the table below. Notice that the LERG loads the cities and states first, which allows a company to narrow the amount of imported data. The table also denotes whether the data is required or optional in MetaSolv Solution.\n\nTABLE NAME\n\nREQUIRED IN METASOLV SOLUTION?\n\nGROUP\n\nWITHIN THE\n\nCOMPANY THAT NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS AND INPUT\n\n1.)

Cities are used throughout MetaSolv Solution to specify locations within entities, such as primary locations and secondary locations. Defining City information involves specifying the following: •\n\nValid name for each city\n\n•\n\nState in which the city is located\n\n•\n\nValid Telcordia place code\n\nFigure 12\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nStates and Cities\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-44\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nOPERATING COMPANIES Operating companies are providers of local telecommunication services (for example, ILEC’s CLEC’s, and wireless entities). Each operating company is identified by an operating company number (OCN), which is an industry-wide standard.\n\nFigure 13\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\nOperating Company\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-45\n\nLATA’S (LOCAL ACCESS & TRANSPORT AREA) As mentioned earlier, a Local Access and Transport Area (LATA) denotes a geographic area established for the provision and administration of communications service. A LATA encompasses one or more designated exchanges, which are grouped to serve common social, economic, and other purposes.\n\nFigure 14\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nLATAs\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-46\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nCENTRAL OFFICE (CO) EXCHANGE AREA’S A central office (CO) exchange area is an industry-wide name for a geographic area within which you provide telephone or Internet services for customers and end users. CO exchange area information is required in MetaSolv Solution, regardless of whether your company provides exchange or access information. (CO Exchange areas are prerequisite to several Infrastructure entities.) CO exchange areas allow you to group network locations for purposes such as rate setting and calling plans. The CO exchange area usually has the same name as the locality it serves. It is served by one serving wire center (SWC), and can contain multiple NPA/NXXs.\n\nFigure 15\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\nCO Exchange\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-47\n\nNPA/NXX CODES NPA/NXX codes are set up by the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and are codes that utilize ten digits to identify telephone numbers. The first six digits of the ten-digit number are referred to as the NPA NXX, which is a combination of the three-digit numbering plan area (NPA) code, (the area code), and the three-digit NXX code, (the CO prefix).\n\nFigure 16\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nNPA/NXX’s\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-48\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nNETWORK LOCATIONS A network location represents the physical points or locations of a building, a point or an inventoried item that your company owns or uses. All network locations are identified by an eight-or-eleven byte Network Location code. For example, the switch where a circuit terminates, or the building that houses a relay rack that you own are both network locations.\n\nFigure 17\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\nNetwork locations\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-49\n\nNETWORK LOCATION EXAMPLES Below are some examples of network locations:\n\nLOCATION\n\nDESCRIPTION\n\nTandem\n\nTandems are switching systems in the network that establish trunk-to-trunk connections, thereby reducing the number of trunk routes in a concentrated arrangement for subtending ends offices.\n\nACTL\n\nAccess Customer Terminal Location (ACTL) is the interLATA facility terminal location of the access customer providing service. The ACTL provides pertinent location information about the service being ordered (the “A” location).\n\nServing Office\n\nThe serving office is a local switching system that connects lines and trunks. It is a facility where subscribers’ lines are joined to switching equipment for connecting other subscribers to each other, for both local and long distance services. “Serving office” can also refer to a network location, such as an end office or mobile telephone serving office that provides telephone exchange switching services. Serving offices play a significant role with respect to billing for access services.\n\nEnd Office\n\nThe term “end office” denotes a local telephone company switching system where telephone exchange service customer station loops are terminated for the purposes of interconnection to each other and to trucks. An end office is the central office switch to which a telephone subscriber is connected. The end office delivers dial tone to the subscriber’s terminal equipment for local POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service).\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-50\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nMANUAL LERG LOAD It is important to understand how to manually enter data from the LERG CD into MetaSolv Solution. Often, to fit its specific needs, a company needs to augment or add to the data that was imported from LERG.\n\nORDER\n\nOF\n\nENTRY As mentioned before, entering the data into infrastructure is pretty straightforward. It’s important to enter the information in the correct order so that all data that is dependent on other data is entered in the proper sequence, which allows associations to be made.

If the wrong person came in and opened up some part of the system and manipulated components within it, recovery time could be costly. With that in mind, MetaSolv Solution has developed a security system, for the MetaSolv Solution software that allows administrators to secure any screen button, or field. Administrators can set the View Only features (Total Access or All Rights), depending on the type of security that is required.\n\nOBJECTIVES Slide 29\n\nLesson Objectives Given a demonstration of security procedures and reference to those procedures in the How Guide, you will be able to:\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\n• capabilities.\n\nDescribe administrator\n\n• functions.\n\nDescribe various password\n\n• permissions and restrictions.\n\nDescribe available security\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-54\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nWINDOWS USED A security administrator uses the following windows specifically for security: •\n\nAssign Permission\n\n•\n\nUsers and Groups\n\n•\n\nSecurity Reports\n\nSecondary windows, such as Add User, are available after you select a main security window.\n\nMETASOLV SOLUTION INTERFACE Slide 30\n\nPower Builder Objects\n\nFigure 18\n\nPower Builder objects\n\nMetaSolv Solution interface is comprised of objects, such as windows, controls (radio buttons or fields), and menus (including pop-up menus).\n\nWINDOWS Windows are the principle points of interaction between you and MetaSolv Solution subsystems. They display information, request information from you, and respond to your mouse clicks or keyboard actions.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-55\n\nWINDOW CONTROLS If you need to protect window controls, such as certain fields or radio buttons on a window, MetaSolv Solution allows you to customize the permissions you set for these objects. Some window controls are preloaded, and you can easily scan others into the software to fit the needs of your business.\n\nPOPUP MENUS MetaSolv Solution provides the ability to assign permissions to the pop-up menus and their controls. The Assign Permissions window lists all securable pop-up menus.\n\nCHECKPOINTS Checkpoints protect the security administration windows and selected functions in the system. The security administrator can establish a special password so that when a user tries to access a particular window or function, a checkpoint window appears. The user must enter the password to gain access to the protected window or function.\n\nPERMISSIONS Security administration involves adding groups and users and restricting those groups and users from using various parts of the product line. If you want to allow users to use some portions of the product line but not others, you can give them permissions that change their access from the default access.\n\nDEFAULT PERMISSIONS When MetaSolv Solution is installed, all users are members of the Default user group. Everyone in this group can access every part of MetaSolv Solution, except those parts protected by checkpoints, which require direct permission or a password. Default group permissions are set when MetaSolv Solution is installed.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-56\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nADMINISTRATOR CAPABILITIES Slide 31\n\nAdministrator Rights A security administrator has the following capabilities: • Solution subsystems.\n\nDepartmentalize MetaSolv\n\n•\n\nHide objects.\n\n•\n\nMake objects “read only.”\n\n• specific objects or functions.\n\nRequire passwords to access\n\n• Assign and display user permissions and group permissions. •\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\nAccess security reports.\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\nBASIC STEPS Slide 32\n\nIN A\n\n2-57\n\nSECURITY IMPLEMENTATION\n\nSecurity Implementation Flowchart\n\nFigure 19\n\nSecurity Implementation Flowchart\n\nThe basic steps to follow in a first-time security implementation include: 1\n\nEstablish the Sec_Admin group.\n\n2\n\nSet up groups and users.\n\n3\n\nSet Global preferences.\n\n4\n\nAssign permissions.\n\nYou will learn more about these steps later.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-58\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nREPORTS Security Reports allow you to view or print reports that detail what permissions are assigned to a user or group. One of the most important aspects of the report feature is the new ability to identify any users that are not assigned to the Default group. Running this report periodically helps you locate any users that “slip through the cracks.”\n\nUSERS Slide 33\n\nAND\n\nGROUPS\n\nUsers and Groups At installation, only the security administrator has access to the Users and Groups window. The security administrator can assign access to groups or users. Setting up groups in the database allows you to easily grant the same rights and permissions to users with similar responsibilities. If you have to make a change that affects every user in the group, then a single change to the group applies simultaneously to every user in the group. For example, if you have 500 users in your Engineering group, you can imagine how much easier it is to make a single Engineering group change than to have to make 500 individual changes! To save time when entering groups and users in the Users and Groups window, use the Continuous Add checkbox to add a number of groups or users.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-59\n\nPASSWORDS Users are required to have passwords to log on to the MetaSolv Solution and to access windows protected by checkpoints. When new users are added, the password automatically defaults to the user ID. The system administrator can assign a permanent password or change the Security Preference so that users can change their own passwords when they log on for the first time.\n\nPASSWORD REQUIREMENTS Slide 34\n\nPassword Requirements Passwords are a necessary part of securing the database. Users are required to have passwords to: •\n\nLog on to the MetaSolv Solution.\n\n•\n\nAccess windows or functions protected by checkpoints.\n\nLogon passwords like the user ID must be:\n\nNote\n\n•\n\nFour - eight characters long\n\n•\n\nStart with a letter\n\n•\n\nInclude only letters and numbers.\n\nAre passwords case sensitive? No! Currently, Oracle does not support case sensitivity.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-60\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nPASSWORD EXPIRATION DATES Slide 35\n\nExpiration Dates\n\nSERVER DATES The log on and expiration dates validate against the server date instead of the date on your personal computer. Using the server date allows for more consistency and accuracy because fewer people have access to the server.\n\nPASSWORD EXPIRATION The password will expire on the date displayed in the Edit User window. The system default is ninety days from the setup date. Note\n\nNo preference currently exists to change the default.\n\nNO EXPIRATION DATE If you leave the Password Expires On field blank. You can make this field blank the password will never expire by highlighting the date and pressing the key. Warning\n\nPassword Expires On Field For security reasons, we do not recommend that you leave the Password Expires On field blank.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-61\n\nPASSWORD EXPIRATION WARNINGS Slide 36\n\nChanging Passwords The MetaSolv Solution warns users that their password is about to expire six days prior to expiration. When the user receives the warning, they may change their password in the User Information folder in Preferences before it expires. If a user does not change their password or access the MetaSolv Solution during the time that the warning appears, then the password expires. Users are then forced to change their password the next time they login to the MetaSolv Solution.\n\nRESTRICTING ACCESS Slide 37\n\nRestricting Access If you want to allow users to use some portions of the product line, but not others, give them permissions that change their access from the default access. The best way to handle this task is to divide users into groups based on job functionality. Let’s say you want a manager to have the ability to make changes through a certain window, but you do not want to give that permission to a temporary office worker. You create a group named \"Clerical\" and put temporary office workers into that group. But first, you need to restrict access for that group. Security Administration provides an easy way to view the permissions associated with an individual user.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-62\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nPERMISSION TYPES Slide 38\n\nPermission Types The following permissions are available for objects in the product line. The object type determines the permission that you assign to the object. You can assign a checkpoint to some windows and functions, which requires a user to enter a password for access to those windows and functions. PERMISSION\n\nDEFINES\n\nDisabled\n\nWhat you can see but you cannot use because the object is grayed out.\n\nFull Access\n\nThat the selected group or user is specifically permitted to use the selected object.\n\nInvisible\n\nWhen you cannot see an object on a window.\n\nNo Access\n\nWhen you cannot see or use a window or checkpoint.\n\nNot Set\n\nWhen you can use a window or menu by default. (The default for checkpoints is No Access.)\n\nPassword\n\nWhen you must enter a password to access the checkpoint.\n\nRead Only\n\nWhen you can see and access the object but cannot make changes to the selected object.\n\nNote Read-Only Windows If a user enters data on a read-only window, no notice appears to notify the user that the data has not been accepted. Therefore, use the Read Only permission sparingly. These permissions are available for every object in the product line.

However, users do not have default access to functions that have checkpoints, such as Work Management changes or security administration.\n\nGroups\n\nOnce associated with a group, the user inherits the group’s permissions. In cases of conflict between a user’s permissions and a group’s permissions, the least restrictive permissions apply unless the user is directly granted permission such as Enabled or No Access. Directly granted user permissions override other permissions, which allows the security administrator to override a permission obtained through group membership.\n\nCheckpoints\n\nThe default permission for a checkpoint is No Access, which means that you must assign the user permission to pass a checkpoint and access the protected object or function.\n\nNot Set versus Enabled\n\nAn object that does not have an assigned permission is Not Set. Therefore, you get the default permission for the object or checkpoint, which can include a restriction. The Enabled permission gives the user explicit permission to access an object. When a user has Enabled permission, more restrictive group permission cannot override it.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-64\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nUSER IMPACT The access that a user has to the software depends on two variables:\n\nSlide 39\n\n• assigned?\n\nAre specific user permissions\n\n• more groups?\n\nDoes the user belong to one or\n\nPermissions Flowchart\n\nFigure 20\n\nSlide 40\n\nPermissions Flowchart\n\nRules Rules governing permissions include: • Users are given the LEAST RESTRICTIVE access available. • override group permissions.\n\nSpecific user permissions\n\nNot Set allows access to windows as a default, but it is ignored as a determining factor when you set group permissions.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-65\n\nPERMISSIONS GROUP BOX A user or group can have different levels of permissions, depending on group memberships and individual permissions.

You can even secure controls on the window so that a user can perform some functions but not others. To assign permissions to window controls, you need to assign permissions to objects on windows (fields, radio buttons, and so on). On the Assign Permissions window, all windows are listed, but not all of the controls for the windows are listed. You must scan in controls that are not listed. When you scan in window controls, these controls are added to the database.\n\nCHECKPOINTS Slide 42\n\nCheckpoints For a new installation, the Security Administration group has \"Access\" permissions for all security checkpoints.

Only those employees that complete tasks for orders own work queues. • Work QueueWork Queues contain the tasks that are generated during the order entry process. The work group queue usually receives the tasks first and then distributes them to the individual work queues that are associated with it. As an example, a task is sent to the Engineering work group and then assigned to an engineer. • TasksTasks are the steps you take to process an order. They are the building blocks that you use to create provisioning plans. They are, in fact, “to-do” items. • Checklist ItemsChecklist items are associated with individual tasks. An example of a checklist item might be to do a credit check on a customer when a service request is submitted. • Provisioning PlansProvisioning plans allow you to define in the MetaSolv Solution how you complete service requests in your organization. They are a collection of “to-do” items or tasks. After you set up all of these puzzle pieces, you are ready to receive service requests. A provisioning plan is generated for a request, but the tasks on the plan can have multiple circuits. The tasks for that request MetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-73\n\nare then assigned to work queues. These are the main pieces of the Work Management subsystem.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-74\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nWORK QUEUE SET-UP PROCESS FLOW Slide 50\n\nWork Queue Setup Process Flow To set up employee work queues so that they can receive tasks, use the following process: 1\n\nAdd the employee to the Security database, if not already entered.\n\n2\n\nAdd the employee to the Work Management database.\n\n3\n\nCreate parent and child work queues.\n\nEMPLOYEES Slide 51\n\nEmployees Employees are the first piece of the Work Management puzzle. Not all employees own a work queue. Only those employees that complete tasks own work queues. To own a work queue, you must be entered as an employee in the Work Management subsystem. Only employees who will be performing tasks to fill a service request need a work queue.\n\nSlide 52\n\nEmployees Rules Before employees can log on to the MetaSolv Solution and use the Work Management functions, the following rules apply: • Infrastructure.\n\nAn organization must be set up in\n\n• The employee must be entered in MetaSolv’s Security database with a valid logon ID. • The employee must be entered in the Work Management subsystem. Remember that you can set up employees with a MetaSolv Solution log on ID and not set them up as employees in the Work Management subsystem. If you do so, however, they will not be able to access any tasks in the MetaSolv Solution.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-75\n\nWhen you add an employee to Work Management, the new ID should be the same as the MetaSolv Solution log on ID. When an employee logs on to the MetaSolv Solution, the log on ID determines which work queues the employee can access. You can enter employees who do not have MetaSolv Solution log on IDs in Work Management, but they won’t be able to log on to the MetaSolv Solution without a MetaSolv Solution log on ID. When you create an Employee ID, the system validates that the MetaSolv Solution log on ID has direct access to the Employee ID’s work queues.\n\nNote\n\nPasswords Security passwords must begin with a letter and be between four and eight characters long. Some companies create a generic logon for all of their contractors. If the security administrator locks down all systems for this logon, except the Work Queue Manager, then contractors can view only their work queues.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-76\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nTOGETHER—CREATE\n\nA\n\nNEW EMPLOYEE\n\nYour supervisor at NewTel has asked you to add a new employee to the Work Management database. His name is Ronnie Wood (RWOODXX), and he has already been set up in Security.\n\nWORK QUEUES Slide 53\n\nWork Queues In work queues you store and organize tasks generated during the order entry process so that individuals or groups of individuals can access and work on their assigned tasks. The parent, or work group, work queue receives the tasks first and then distributes them to the child work queues that are associated with the parent. Therefore, a task would go to the Engineering work queue (the parent queue) and then will be sent to an individual engineer (to the child queue of the engineering parent queue).\n\nSlide 54\n\nParent and Child Relationship (child)\n\nTONI\n\n(child)\n\n(owner)\n\nJOHN (owner)\n\n(child)\n\nJOHN\n\n(child)\n\nTOM\n\n(child)\n\n(child)\n\nSUSIE\n\n(owner)\n\nSUSIE\n\nJAMES\n\n(owner)\n\n(owner) (child) (owner)\n\n(owner)\n\nLARA (owner)\n\n(child)\n\nBILL\n\n(child)\n\n(child)\n\nMARIA (owner)\n\n(owner)\n\n(child)\n\nMIKE\n\n(owner)\n\n(child)\n\nGERRI (owner)\n\nParent Work Queue A Lara (owner)\n\nFigure 24\n\nParent Work Queue B Mike (owner)\n\nParent and child relationship\n\nYou must set up the parent work queue first.

Tasks are the steps that you take to process an order, such as confirming the order, designing the circuit, or preparing billing. The MetaSolv Solution includes detailed reporting that identifies which users completed tasks on time and which users completed tasks late.\n\nTASK TYPES Slide 55\n\nTasks The Work Management Task Types section allows you to create and maintain task types associated with provisioning plans. Task types are pre-loaded when the MetaSolv Solution is installed, and they trigger specific pre-programmed processes within the system.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-79\n\nSMART TASKS Slide 56\n\nSMART Tasks The highlighted tasks are “SMART” tasks. A SMART task drives information in the system. It has a double-click function that takes you to wherever you want to go in the MetaSolv Solution to accomplish a task. When you double-click a SMART task in the Work Management subsystem, a window specific to that task opens. For example, when you double-click the DLRD task, the Design Layout Record window opens. When you double-click any task that is not a SMART task, then the system defaults to the Service Request Query window.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-80\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nTASK PROPERTIES Slide 57\n\nTask Properties You can edit the existing task types or create new task types that are specific to your company. For each task entered you can: • Create the number of grace days, hours, and minutes, which allows users additional time after the due date before a why missed code is required. • Create the potentially late notification days, hours, and minutes, which gives users advance notice that a task has the potential for being late. •\n\nDetermine if the task is critical.\n\n• Create a double-click action if the task is not already a SMART task. For example, if you select DLRD as the double-click action for a new task called “PRECLR” (pre-circuit layout record), then when you double-click the PRECLR task, it also opens the Design Layout Record window. You can make any new task work like an existing SMART task. Warning\n\nSMART Tasks with Background Validations In your task handout, notice that a few tasks have an asterisk beside them.

Each checklist item is user-defined, based on your business practice, and is associated with a task on a provisioning plan. When you add a checklist item to a task, it shows up only for new tasks generated. It does not apply to tasks that are already in work queues. Let’s say that for the APP task, you want to define two subtasks: one to send a welcome letter when you complete the APP task and the other to check the customer’s credit to make sure they can pay you. You can set up both of these subtasks as checklist items. Again, a checklist item is a reminder for the person completing the task. In this example, you must complete both checklist items before you can complete the APP task. The MetaSolv Solution doesn’t hold you to completing your checklist items in any specific order, except that you must complete them before you complete the task. Your business process dictates the recommended order of completion.\n\nTOGETHER—CREATE CHECKLIST ITEMS To make sure that you don’t forget to do a credit check on a customer when you complete the APP task, with your instructor, add a checklist item that will remind you to do the credit check.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-90\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nCREATE PROVISIONING PLANS Slide 60\n\nProvisioning Plans A provisioning plan is essentially a list of “to do” items, or tasks, that each order type follows. Provisioning plans allow you to define how you complete tasks for orders in the MetaSolv Solution. They are associated with service type groups, organizations, and jurisdictions. When you enter an order, only the provisioning plans that match the service type, organization, and jurisdiction are available.\n\nTASK PROPERTIES Slide 61\n\nTasks Properties in Plan You must consider two additional properties when you add tasks to a provisioning plan: • A work queue is the group of individuals or the department responsible for completing the tasks. The group might be customer service representatives, engineers, or field services. • The interval is the length of time (in 15-minute increments) that you can complete a task and is on time.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-91\n\nOTHER OPTIONS In addition to these required properties, you can choose from several additional options: • Close of BusinessYou can mark a task “Close of Business,” which means that the task is due at the end of the business day, according to the times that you have set up in the Work Management Preferences. • Potentially Late IntervalRecall that in the task lesson, we set up the “potentially late interval,” which is the notification that a due date is approaching and you haven’t completed a task. The default interval carries over, but you can override it when you create the provisioning plan. • AutoCompleteableYou can also make a task “AutoCompleteable.” Whenever you complete a follower task, any auto-completeable tasks complete automatically.

For example, in the plan that you just created, the RID task cannot begin until you complete the APP and CONF tasks. (The dependencies display in Gantt Chart format.)\n\nDATING INDICATOR FIELD In most cases, all tasks are forward dated, except the Due Date task, which is usually backdated. Sometimes, you backdate other tasks when an order is not due for a long time. For example, a customer orders a T1 line in January but doesn’t want it turned on until May 1st. If a standard order takes six weeks, the installation of the T1 would take place way ahead of schedule. Therefore, you would probably complete the application and credit check and then backdate the remaining tasks from the Due Date. After a gap of no work from January to March, the work would begin in March and be completed by May 1. You can also forward date the Due Date. For example, if you make a sale for a product that takes two weeks to produce and the due date is in one week, all the tasks would have earlier due dates that you most likely cannot meet. In a realistic work schedule, the Due Date would be forward dated and would fall in line with the task intervals.\n\nRULES\n\nFOR THE\n\nDATING INDICATOR FIELD • If a task is forward dated (arrow pointing to the right), then all of its predecessor tasks are forward dated. • If a task is backward dated, then all of its follower tasks up to DD are backward dated. • task must be forward dated.\n\nAny tasks appearing after the DD\n\n• If you add a parent task that is backward dated, then all of the child tasks must be backward dated. If the DD task is forward dated, then all tasks must be forward dated.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-96\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nPERT CHART The PERT chart is a graphical representation of the tasks listed on the Task Dependencies tab.\n\nNPA/NXX TASK ASSIGNMENT The NPA/NXX assigned on an order determines which work queue the tasks for that order are assigned to. NPA/NXXs must exist in the MetaSolv Solution Infrastructure, and you must set the Require NPA NXX for Work Queue Scheduling preference to “Yes.” Example: A customer creates the NW Region as an organization, which could have 20 different NPA/NXXs as a subset. If more than one work queue has responsibility for the same NPA/NXX, then the tasks go to the NPA/NXX queue with the fewest tasks (as in “regular” task assignment).\n\nGATEWAY ASSIGNMENT A gateway event is the process of linking a third party vendor to the MetaSolv Solution. You use the Gateway Assignment tab to add a gateway event to a task in a provisioning plan.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-97\n\nAUTOMATIC PLAN SELECTION It can be confusing for customer representatives to select the right provisioning plan if their company has a lot of plans to choose from. To make it easier, you can set up the MetaSolv Solution so that it selects a predetermined provisioning plan automatically during task generation and sends that plan to the default work queues. The customer rep doesn’t have to do anything except click the Tasks button or the Finish button, depending on the order type.\n\nRULES Slide 63\n\nFOR\n\nAUTOMATIC PLAN SELECTION\n\nAutomatic Provisioning Plan Selection Automatic provisioning requires that you set up the MetaSolv Solution so that it meets the following conditions: • as “WORKMGMT.”\n\nThe service type group is set up\n\n• for the service type is checked.\n\nThe Auto Apply Plan checkbox\n\n• The organization, jurisdiction, and service type must be unique (to one provisioning plan).\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-98\n\nRULES\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nAND\n\nSlide 64\n\nBEHAVIORS\n\nRules/Behavior The Rules/Behavior functionality is similar to an “If-Then” statement. If a rule is true, then perform a behavior. Here’s an example: “If it’s raining, then put up an umbrella.” In the MetaSolv Solution, we call the “if” part of the statement the “rule,” or query. We call the “then” part of the statement the “behavior.” The MetaSolv Solution automatically performs the behavior, based on a rule, when the query is successful.\n\nBENEFITS\n\nOF\n\nRULES\n\nSlide 65\n\nBenefits\n\nAND\n\nBEHAVIORS\n\nThis functionality allows the MetaSolv Solution to provide the best of both worlds: • The ability to set up standard, consistent provisioning plans to apply to a service type, and • The flexibility to add or delete tasks from provisioning plans dynamically, based on customer criteria. The Rules/Behavior functionality cuts down on the number of provisioning plans that are needed, as well as the number of tasks that a customer representative must modify manually. A representative enters an order and selects a provisioning plan. Then he or she can modify the tasks on the plan to meet any unique requirements for the order. With the Rules/Behavior functionality, the representative does not have to make any task changes, which means that a new provisioning plan is unnecessary. The provisioner adds the “if-then statement” into the Work Management subsystem. Then, whenever someone enters an order, the MetaSolv Solution checks to see if the IF statement is true. If it is true, then the behavior takes place automatically.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\nEXAMPLE\n\nOF\n\n2-99\n\nUSING RULES\n\nAND\n\nBEHAVIORS\n\nAt predefined process points during the entering of a service request, the system searches for all rules that you created for the process points and then executes those rules. For example, you can have a rule that runs at the process point of \"push the Validate button” or “push the Order Finish button” or for when you add a service item to an order. On the Rules and Behaviors - New window, you can set up the software so that a credit card validation takes place at any one of these process points.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-100\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nGENERATE Slide 66\n\nAND\n\nMODIFY TASKS\n\nGenerate and Modify Tasks\n\nFigure 26\n\nGenerate and modify task flow\n\nGenerating tasks occurs after you enter an order and validate it. You will select a provisioning plan for an order and then send the tasks to the appropriate work queues. Generally, if your company does a good job defining provisioning plans, then when you generate tasks, you will be able to select the appropriate provisioning plan, choose the work queues, and save the task assignments. Frequently, you won’t even have to select a plan or work queue because the system will do it for you automatically. In some cases, such as when a provisioning plan hasn’t been created for a certain order type, you may need to modify the tasks on the plan.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-101\n\nGENERATING TASKS Before generating tasks, an appropriate provisioning plan must exist in the database. You’ve already set up a plan through the MetaSolv Solution Work Management subsystem. You have identified the following: •\n\nBase set of tasks\n\n• each task\n\nWorkdays needed to complete\n\n•\n\nDependencies between tasks\n\n•\n\nDefault assignments for each task\n\nNow, you are ready to generate tasks for the order. The Plan Selection tab on the Tasks window allows you to select a provisioning plan, plus NPA NXX scheduling information (if the preference is set up). The MetaSolv Solution uses this information to generate work queue assignments.\n\nProprietary and Confidential\n\nBootcamp\n\n2-102\n\nUnit 2—Preparing the TBS SoftwareMetaSolv Solution\n\nTOGETHER—COMPLETE\n\nTHE\n\nPLAN SELECTION TAB\n\nOpen the service request (ASR) with a PON of NEWTELXX and select a plan for provisioning the tasks associated with this order. After you select a provisioning plan, the system displays the Task Gantt tab automatically, which allows you to see the current tasks in the provisioning plan. Also view the tasks on the Task List tab, which has the same tasks in list form, but with more detail.\n\nMetaSolv Solution 5.0  7/12/2011  D5.0\n\n2001 MetaSolv Software, Inc.\n\nWork Management\n\n2-103\n\nWORK QUEUES You can select work queues automatically or manually (if the Allow Manual Queue Scheduling at Task Generation preference is turned on). For both methods, the type of work queue and employee availability affect, which work queues, you can select. Note Unidentified Work Queues Question marks (????????) indicate that the MetaSolv Solution inserted or added a task after executing rules and behaviors. (Only tasks that come from a provisioning plan have associated work queues.) You must select work queues for these unidentified work queues manually.
