Oracle Corp. (ORCL) said Thursday after the closed that first quarter earnings rose 28% from last year, helped by strong sales of new software licenses and higher revenues from software license updates. The company's quarterly earnings per share, excluding items, also came in above analysts' expectations.

The world's largest enterprise software company reported GAAP net income for the first quarter of $1.08 billion or $0.21 per share, compared to $840 million or $0.16 per share for the year-ago quarter and $2.04 billion or $0.39 per share for the previous sequential quarter.

Excluding acquisition costs, employee stock options expense, amortization of intangible assets and other items, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $1.54 billion or $0.29 per share, compared to $1.17 billion or $0.22 per share in the prior year quarter and $2.43 billion or $0.47 per share in the prior quarter.

On average, 22 analysts polled by First Call / Thomson Financial expected the company to earn $0.27 per share for the first quarter.

This marked the eleventh consecutive quarter in which Oracle's earnings has surged by at least 20%, which is part of the company's strategy to deliver growth through acquisitions.

In June, Oracle had forecast first quarter earnings of $0.17 to $0.18 per share or $0.26 to $0.27 per share, excluding certain items.

GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 29%, compared to 27% in the first quarter of last year and 41% in the fourth quarter.

Non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 40%, compared to 37% in the first quarter of last year and 49% in the fourth quarter.

Redwood Shores, California-based Oracle said total GAAP revenues for the first quarter increased 18% to $5.33 billion from $4.53 billion a year ago, while non-GAAP revenue also increased 18% to $5.42 billion from $4.59 billion last year. Sequentially, first quarter GAAP revenue declined 26.4%, while non-GAAP revenue fell 25.5%. Twenty-five analysts had a consensus revenue estimate of $5.42 billion for the first quarter.

Oracle's results came as a sort of relief to investors who witnessed one of the most turbulent weeks in the history of Wall Street that saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the forced takeover of Merrill Lynch and Co., and the unprecedented government bailout of American International Group Inc.

Oracle said total GAAP software revenues for the first quarter surged 20% year over year to $4.2 billion. GAAP new software license revenues for the quarter rose 14% from a year earlier to $1.2 billion. In June, the company forecast that it would post a 10% to 20% jump in new software sales.

First quarter GAAP software license updates and product support revenues increased 23% year over year to $2.9 billion, while service revenues grew 9% to 1.2 billion.

GAAP revenues from the Americas rose 13% to $2.7 billion in the first quarter from $2.4 billion a year ago, while Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue surged 20% to $1.8 billion from $1.5 billion last year and Asia Pacific revenue grew 30% to $814 million from $624 million a year ago.

"Oracle has once again increased its database market share according to the latest Gartner research report," said Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. "Oracle's 49% market share in the survey year 2007 was greater than the market share of the next 4 vendors combined: IBM, Microsoft, Teradata, and Sybase."

Oracle has already taken the number one position in database software from IBM and that if it continues to grow its middleware software , particularly after its acquisition of BEA Systems, Inc., it may challenge IBM for the number one position in middleware by the end of this year.

Oracle continues to carry out its strategy of acquisition-driven growth. Since the end of 2004, Oracle has spent more than $35 billion on more than 30 acquisitions. In January 2005, the company completed its $11.1 billion purchase of PeopleSoft after a prolonged takeover battle. Besides PeopleSoft, Oracle has also swallowed up Siebel Systems Inc. for $6.1 billion. Some other deals included MetaSolv Software Inc., Stellent Inc. and Hyperion Solutions Corp.

In late April, Oracle closed its $8.5 billion acquisition of BEA Systems Inc. The acquisition will significantly enhance and extend Oracle's Fusion middleware software suite. Oracle expects the acquisition to be accretive to its earnings by at least $0.01 to $0.02 on a non-GAAP basis in its first full year after closing.

In July, Oracle agreed to buy Global Knowledge Software LLC, a division of Global Knowledge, Inc. Earlier this month, Oracle signed deal to buy ClearApp, a private firm that provides application service management for J2EE-based composite applications.

Last month, Oracle said it has appointed Jeff Epstein as executive vice president and chief financial officer, starting September. Epstein succeeds Safra Catz in that position. Catz, who continues to serve as the president, held both the positions since November 2005. Epstein will report to Catz.

In terms of stock performance, Oracle shares have lost 13.15% in the last one year, during which Microsoft shares have fallen 14.30% and IBM shares have declined 4.46%. Oracle shares trade at 10.90 times estimated forward earnings, compared to Microsoft's 10.53 times and IBM's 11.82 times.

Oracle shares, which have traded in a range of $18.07 to $23.62 over the past year, closed Thursday's regular trading session at $18.75, up 65 cents or 3.59%. The stock is currently gaining $1.42 or 7.57% in after hours trading.
