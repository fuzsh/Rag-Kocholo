        "text": "Cover from the American hardcover edition. Author(s) Diana Wynne Jones Country England Language English Series The Chrestomanci Series Genre(s) Fantasy, Children's novels Publisher Harper Collins Publication date 2005 Media type Print (Hardback & Paperback)\n\nConrad's Fate is a novel by Diana Wynne Jones published in 2005. It is the fifth book of the Chrestomanci series. It tells the story of Conrad Tesdinic, a boy from Series Seven who is sent on a mission to fix his bad karma.\n\nPlot summary\n\nConrad Tesdinic lives in Stallery, a small town in his world's version of the English Alps, formed as in Series Seven worlds the British Isles are still connected to the European mainland. In the mountains high above Stallery lies Stallery Mansion, a possibilities mansion, grand and imposing house, home to the Count and his family. Conrad's father is dead; his sister Anthea left home to go to university; his mother, Franconia, is a rather eccentric feminist author, and her books are sold exclusively in her brother's bookshop, where she and Conrad also live.\n\nConrad's uncle tells him that someone up at Stallery Mansion is pulling the possibilities – that is, changing the details of the world. Judging from the affluence of Stallery, this person is making a great deal of money by doing so, perhaps by playing the stock market; but this is adversely affecting the rest of the world. At first only small details change – the colour of the postboxes, the titles of books – but the changes keep getting bigger and bigger.\n\nConrad is going to die. According to his uncle, this is because of his bad karma, which, if he does not kill the person pulling the probabilities, will result in he himself being killed within a year. Conrad's uncle and his group of magician friends work a strange spell on a cork, giving it, and Conrad, who has possession of it, the power to summon a Walker at will. A Walker is a being who will give him what he needs to defeat the person he should have eliminated in a past life. Conrad needs to be sure who this person is before he summons the Walker, however, so instead of moving forward in school with his friends, he is sent to work at Stallery and study its inhabitants, one of which is the person Conrad needs to defeat.\n\nConrad soon finds that he is not the only one snooping around the mansion. He befriends his fellow servant-in-training, Christopher \"Smith\" (really Christopher Chant), who is searching for his friend Millie. Together, they discover that she is trapped in one of the possibilities. Conrad and Christopher must stop the person behind all the mischief, rescue Millie, and fix Conrad's fate, all without spilling soup on the Countess although Conrad's bad Karma isn't helping along the way.\n\nCharacters\n\nConrad Tesdinic: Conrad decides to take an alias at Stallery, and calls himself \"Conrad Grant\". His uncle Alfred's surname. Christopher suspects this is false, and so calls him \"Grant\" in a superior and often sarcastic way all throughout the book. Conrad's uncle runs the bookshop in town, and so he has a great love of books––which makes the pulling of the possibilities very irritating for him, as the book titles and minor details within the books change overnight. He brings his camera with him to Stallery and makes great use of it.\n\nChristopher Chant: Christopher also has an alias: \"Christopher Smith\". The character we see here is around fifteen, older than in The Lives of Christopher Chant, but younger than in the other Chrestomanci books. He is witty, confident, charming, he also seems to have a very soft spot for Millie. Christopher can often talk his way out of a situation, even though he goes rather vague at times...\n\nMillie: Christopher's friend. She becomes lost in the possibilities at Stallery while running away from boarding school. Christopher's chief reason for coming to Stallery is to find her. When found by Conrad she becomes a maid for a while.\n\nMr. Amos: The pear-shaped, severe butler of Stallery. He insists on discipline and impeccable dress at all times. But even through his reiteration of and insistence on a servant's place, Conrad and Christopher cannot help but feel that there is more to his place than he is letting on.\n\nAnthea Tesdinic: Conrad's sister, who left home a few years before the bulk of the story. Appears again in a sticky mess she cant see."
