guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nPreface The year is 1456. The place is the Southern Baltic. The Free City of Danzig is in rebellion against the BrotherKnights of the Teutonic Order. Privateers flying the Danzig colors patrol the waters of the Baltic all the way from Reval to Denmark. Bearing letters of marque they will intercept any vessels attempting to reach the Ordensstaat: the Monastic State of the Teutonic Order. Their crews are armed with crossbows, firearms, and cannon, and wear the armor of Medieval Knights. Gunboats, similarly armed with swivel guns, crossbows and breach loading cannon, patrol the Vistula River, engaging any enemy forces they encounter. Professional contractors do most of the fighting in this war... Bohemian heretics fight as mercenaries on both sides, and today they are preparing to sell three captured towns to the highest bidder. They are joined by Austrian, Scottish, Dutch, Swedish, and Italian mercenaries, each with their own small private armies. The city councilors of Danzig plot their strategy over a chess game played this evening in their merchant’s guild hall named for King Arthur. Safe behind the mighty walls of their city, the city council composes a letter to their ally King Casimir IV Poland, seeking to coordinate a new offensive. Nearby, burghers drink beer with their wives in the public baths, taking a break from a long day of guard duty on the city walls, or working the foundry in one of the city’s water powered mills. At the river front, the seven story high mechanized crane unloads gunpowder, salt, pickles, and four hundred kegs of beer from an ocean going three masted carrack just arrived from Bruges, having crossed the multiple blockades under the safe passage of the navy of the Prussian Confederation and the Hanseatic League. The citizens will celebrate tonight, for tomorrow is the feast of St. Vitus. A few hundred miles to the East in nearby Lithuania, the eerie primordial groves of a vast forest called The Grauden echo with the chants of pagan priests of the wild Samogitians, who still practice their ancient pre-Christian faith. This night they will give sacrifice to their heathen god Kupolė by bathing naked in the river in the moonlight. They dance the wild primal dance around the fire without fear of interference. The Teutonic Knights invaded this land annually for two hundred years in a vain attempt to convert the population to the rule of Christ. Eventually they gave up, and the Samogitians are their own masters this day. Meanwhile in his impregnable three level castle of Malbork, the stern Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, Ludwig von Erlichshausen consults with his mercenary captains and brother-knights. His castle is surrounded by Introduction\n\nenemy forces who occupy the town of Marienburg, but he has plenty of cannon and sufficient supplies to hold out for years, with 100 iron-hard Brother Knights of the Teutonic Order by his side. The rebels dare not try to storm the walls, nor will they be able to stop the armed river boats he is preparing to carry his orders to his other great fortress at Konigsberg. The knights are gathering their mercenaries, raising money, and preparing a mighty counterstroke against the enemies of St. Mary and the righteous Ordensstaat. Down in Silesia, in the range known as the Giant Mountains, superstitious gold prospectors leave offerings to the troll which is said to haunt the mountain range known as the “Giant Mountains”. His name is Krakonoš but it is said to be wiser to refer to him as Herr Johan. They say he can make people disappear, or grant them good luck, according to his whim. Further to the East, Mongol horse-archers of the Golden Horde check their saddles and water their horses as they prepare to make a slave raid deep into Poland. This is what they call ‘harvesting the steppe’. Their vassals in Muscovy not far away, give prayers to St. Vitus as they forge new gun barrels and build up their city walls for the inevitable next violent encounter with their ruthless overlords. Further to the south, escaped Ukrainian slaves in an outlaw Cossack band are making preparations of their own, planning a violent night time raid into the land of the Mongols, to steal horses, rescue Ruthenian women and liberate men who will join the ranks of their growing Cossack army. In the north, Swedish and Finnish fur trappers hunt a wounded wild boar on skis, eager to bring food back to their trapping camp where they have been collecting beaver pelts. Little do they know, a pack of wolves is stalking them, and the alpha male is pacing their group, waiting patiently for them to become separated. Not far away on a hilltop, armed Druzhina from Novgorod watch the drama unfold with the help of a brass spyglass, not sure yet if they will rob the Swedes, or save them from the wolf attack. This is the historical reality of life in the 15th Century Baltic. It’s a tough place, a place where high technology and sophisticated urban life exist only a few miles away from primitive tribesmen, struggling for survival. It is a land of many ethnicities and language groups, religions and social classes, where adventure, honor, and wealth beyond the wildest dreams of fantasy can be won by the daring, but swift death awaits both the foolish and the unlucky.\n\nPage 8 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nVisitors from overseas, Nicholas Roerich\n\nThe Wild Wild North In the 8th Century AD, the heathen Svear and Goth fleets left the Vik and the Isle of Gotland to cross the wine-dark sea of the Baltic in a new type of longship, sleeker and faster and more seaworthy than anything the Northern world had yet seen. They were heading east and south, bringing the dawn of an age of raiding, exploration, warfare and trade that filtered back to their homeland in tales of great deeds and tragic reversals, a few of which have crossed eleven hundred years to reach us today. It was Western Europe’s first documented introduction to this mysterious region. The fierce men of the land of the midnight sun poured into the coastal communities of the Baltic like a hurricane of death, killing and stealing, reaping the battle harvest, feeding the eagles. But the people they faced here were tough, honorable men and the Vikings found that trade was a surer path to riches than conquest against such hardy warriors. Settlements were soon established, trading posts, winter forts, fishing towns. The Norse intermarried with the locals and settled in the new land.\n\nNorsemen made alliances with local tribes and sold their services as warriors. They travelled deep into the remote wilderness seeking amber, furs, silk, wax, honey, and slaves. Viking fraternities were founded here, the famous Jomsvikings made their base Jomsborg in Baltic Pomerania in the 10th Century to raid coasts from Denmark to Ireland. Within a generation the Norse armed trading bands called varjags, known as varangians to the Greeks, had penetrated all the way to the Black Sea, fighting their way across the steppe, facing horse-nomads, mysterious Wends, the ancient decadent pagan kingdom of the Khazars, and eventually the mighty, mighty walls of Miklagard, the greatest city in the Western Hemisphere, many times larger than all the towns in Scandinavia put together. The Greeks had their own name for this place, Constantinople. From that time until the time of the setting of this book in the mid-15th Century many generations of raiders, crusaders, traders, adventurers, bandits and villains have shaped this tumultuous region, creating a complex and dangerous landscape of clashing loyalties, worldviews, and agendas which are not always as they first appear.\n\nPage 9 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nOne way to get your head around the reality of life in the Medieval Baltic is to consider its similarities with a slightly more familiar genre, the early frontier of Colonial North America. There are many strong parallels to the time of the fur trapping Voyageurs of 17th Century Canada, and to the pioneers, religious “pilgrims”, traders, soldiers and frontiersmen of Canada and New England in the 17 th Century. Like in the old American frontier, the Medieval Baltic is dominated by a system of forts, trading posts and fortified outposts, precariously linked by ships operating along the coasts and rivers, linking powerful Renaissance cities. As in Colonial North America, the mysterious, heavily forested interior of the Medieval Baltic remains occupied by unpredictable and dangerous natives. In both cases the relationship between the Colonial invaders and the indigenous people is characterized by trade and profit, alliance and betrayal, heroic last stands and vicious massacres, firm treaties and sudden reprisals, with an overall pattern of colonization and forced conversion, but also trade and cultural exchange. Meanwhile the threat of betrayal and death remain a constant. In the Wild Wild North of 1456, the Teutonic Order and the other Colonial powers exercise control of the coastal regions through the means of such high technology as crossbows, firearms, and cannon, to which may be added armored heavy cavalry and large ocean-going ships. They rely on fort-building to extend their reach, and have come to prefer brick or stone castles because wooden forts are too vulnerable to fire. The similarities to North America are not entirely coincidental. The fur trade was one of the biggest industries in the Baltic region and this fur trade simply shifted west when the Americas were discovered. The climates are not that different, nor are the geographies. As in Colonial North America, the colonists were losing trust in their own colonial masters. But there is a point at which the comparison breaks down. Unlike in the New World, the natives here in the Baltic already had the technology of steel making and had horses, guns and crossbows of their own. They also had the diplomatic skill to forge real alliances with the rival colonial powers. Beyond the immediate Baltic region, the menace of the Mongols and the Turks lay waiting out on the Steppe, a\n\nuniversal threat capable of wiping out all and enslaving of the peoples of the region whether they were Christian or Heathen.\n\nWhat Volume II is Volume I of the Codex Guide to the Medieval Baltic is a kind of encyclopedia which covers the basics of geography and travel, the estates of the princes, the knights, the peasants, and (especially) the burghers, and takes a deep dive into the equipment and strategy of warfare in the 15th Century. Volume II explores the estates of the Church and of scholars, and delves into the law and legal systems of the time. Religion and life within the Church are assessed, and there is a short list of important Saints. In the shadow of canonical Christianity, we find heresy and witchcraft lurking, as well as the indigenous religions and ancient spiritual practices of the region. We then enter the world of the literati, and briefly explain scholasticism, humanism and some examples of period literature; and universities in North-Central Europe. Volume II provides detailed historical timelines of major regional events from the 13th through mid-15th Centuries, and tells some of the great stories in this period, laying out the historical narratives in a discussion of each of the major kingdoms, duchies, city states and other polities in the Baltic region. These are divided into Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary ‘players’ in terms of relevance to the region in focus, with more emphasis put on those closest or most influential to the Baltic in the mid-15th Century. The storytelling continues with a description of some of the most important towns and cities of the Medieval Baltic, with a special focus on Danzig / Gdansk. This is followed by a section of the personalities of the setting, the fascinating, often brilliant, and sometimes very dangerous people who fought, schemed, adventured, studied and in various other ways contributed to the historical record in this part of the world, during this remarkable time. Finally, we end the book and this specific series on the Baltic with a brief description of the often sad events which took place in North Eastern Europe in the 17th-20th Centuries, and the more recent changes since the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991.\n\nPage 10 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nThe Southern Baltic, 1456 AD\n\n“Between the construction of the two above-mentioned forts, Meinhard was consecrated bishop by the metropolitan of Bremen. After the second fort had been completed, in their iniquity they forgot their oath and perjured themselves, for there was not even one of them who accepted the faith. Truly the soul of the preacher was disturbed, in as much as, by gradually plundering his possessions and beating his household, they decided to drive him outside their borders. They thought that since they had been baptized with water, they could remove their baptism by washing themselves in the Dvina [river] and thus send it back to Germans. As a co-worker in the gospel the bishop has Brother Theodoric of the Cistercian order*, subsequently a bishop in Esthonia [Estonia]. Because the crops in his fields were quite abundant and in their own fields dying because of a flooding rain, the Livonians of Treiden prepared to sacrifice him to their gods. The people were collected and the will of the gods regarding the sacrifice was sought after by lot. A lance was placed in a position and the horse came up and, at the signal of God, put out one foot thought to be the foot of life. Brother Theodoric prayed aloud and gave blessings with his hand. The pagan priest asserted that the Christian God was sitting on the back of the horse and was moving the horse’s foot forward; that for this reason the back of the horse needed to be wiped off so that the God might slide off. When this was done, the horse again put forth the foot of life, as before, and Brother Theodoric’s life was saved.” -excerpt from The Chronicle of Henry of Livonia, Henricus Lettus (Author), circa 1227 AD.

We broke down the roles of knights, pikemen, castles and other fortifications, cannon and firearms, and the dreaded war-wagon. We analyzed the new strategies and tactics which were being developed in this era. We also delved into some of the political interaction between the burghers, nobility and princes. In this volume we will explore two of the other very important estates of late medieval Europe: The Church and the Universities. While the knights, princely armies and burgher militias struggled for military control, attempted to dominate the Baltic pagans and sought to block the incursion of Ottoman and Mongol raids, there was a second equally fraught conflict between all of the ideological, spiritual and philosophical factions of the era. Though this could also spill out onto the battlefield, the main arena for ideological conflict was in the minds (and souls) of the people. The Late Medieval period was a unique time of explosive growth in technological achievement, economic prosperity, and very rapid changes in the forms of social organization. It was a period of surging cultural genesis the likes of which had not been seen in Europe since the Golden Age of Athens. The people of this era knew they were in a time of profound and rapid change, and many sought to guide its development. Within the institutions of the Church, inside the lecture halls of the universities, in the monasteries and abbeys, and the new urban and princely salons, the parameters of a future world were being hashed out. Some wanted to reinvent the ancient Roman empire, others were advocates of Classical republicanism of the earlier citystates. Some wanted to forge a truly Christian lifestyle, and some wanted to create entirely new types of societies. At the same time, there was a battle for people’s souls. The Muslims sought to convert Christians by the sword, while the Christians tried to do the same to the pagans of the Baltic. The heretical Hussites of Bohemia posed a challenge to the Church by their very existence, and their scholars continued to point out the need for reform. Disgruntled members of the Church itself spread dissent and subversion throughout Europe in their travels. The new universities routinely veered into dangerous ideological territories, and philosophical disputes frequently broke out into violence. The estates and their rivalries The development of a consensus in Latin Europe was difficult, because not only did each faction within the church or the nobility disagree with the others, all of the medieval estates considered the others kind of irrelevant and frustrating.\n\nThe Holy See cared about Vatican politics, corralling the cardinals and archbishops, and perhaps the existence of rival popes, but kings and cities were just violent and greedy fools blocking Gods Will. Kings and Emperors of various monarchies cared about their own princely families, first and foremost, including rival brothers and uncles and wives and daughters, and saw all others as impediments to their Hausmachtpolitik. The Kings of Hungary, Spain and Portugal saw themselves on the Front Line against the Muslim Infidel, and perceived all other monarchs and citystates as traitors who didn't care about the ultimate menace. Autonomous cities like Venice, Florence, Lübeck or Danzig saw most kings, prelates and princes as violent fools; treacherous thieves to be manipulated when possible, appeased when necessary and forcibly blocked when required. The Religious, (monks, friars and nuns) cared about their Orders and those of their rivals, and the theological disputes between them, but perceived the Church leadership as hopelessly corrupt and always a hairs breadth from utter spiritual ruin. The lay community, to them, were hopelessly lost in Sin. Universities were also universes unto themselves and the literati who could read and write in Latin thought anyone who couldn't read Latin, (and ideally in Greek and Arabic too) were illiterate trash who just got in the way of progress and couldn’t be trusted to make serious decisions. The various estates were always rubbing up against each other, sometimes forming alliances, sometimes breaking out into wars, usually trying to make each other do their own bidding. Some polities had a much more sophisticated view of the world which did indeed grasp the other perspectives (say, Venice for example, which seemed to always be capable of analyzing a problem from many different angles) while others, in spite of being very powerful, often seemed willfully provincial in their outlook. Like the big kingdoms of France and England. But to some extent they all imposed their own reality on their neighbors, and all of their points of view were part of the crazy churn which left us the Renaissance - and thereby cannon, muskets, ocean-going ships, unique literature, major advances in chemistry and medicine, some very impressive architecture, and some extremely nice paintings and statues. We are going to open up the engine of this marvelous churn we call the Renaissance, and try to figure out what made it tick.\n\nPage 12 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nLaw, religion, and the life of the mind\n\nmight have markets for generations before they were officially chartered under Town Law and legally permitted to run them.\n\nLaw “Whoever makes shoddy beer, shall be thrown into manure “ - Town Law from Danzig, 11th century.\n\nMedieval Europe was a curious mix of strict and complex legal organization and its utter lack. Society was almost hyper-regulated in many respects in theory, while often simultaneously deferring to laissez faire traditions in practice. It was a place where people could settle scores by judicial combat or practice robbery or piracy with relative impunity under the rules of ‘private war’, but every aspect of production was strictly controlled by town authorities and guilds, anything to do with religion was managed with ruthless efficiency by the Church, and the rule over the rural territories was managed according to harsh feudal laws.\n\nGuilds would exist for decades before being legally recognized in the town charter. Local people preferred to informally deal with certain types of crimes, such as acts of stupidity committed by youths, without enrolling them into the records as felonies or misdemeanors, and disputes between factions or families, even those which resulted in violence, were often settled through various types of informal mediation and payment of “gifts rather than formal action by a court.\n\nCriminal laws in the Baltic were strict, justice was swift and while many punishments could be mild to moderate and usually non corporeal, punishment of serious crimes like robbery, murder or rape was very harsh indeed, meaning various increasingly gruesome forms of execution. German Law and Local Laws German law in the 15th Century was a rather uneasy mix of Roman law with the Germanic tribal laws of at least half a dozen tribes (German, Flemish, Scandinavian, Slavic and Gaelic among others), but most notably the Franks and the Saxons. Due to the important role of immigrants from throughout the region of Germany in the Ostsiedlung, much of the law in the Baltic was derived from German tribal laws or the laws of the Holy Roman Empire, as well as German town charters, combined in varying degree with local Slavic, Norse and Baltic traditions. This was true to a large extent in Prussia, Silesia, and Pomerania and in certain parts of Bohemia, Poland, and Masovia. In Sweden and Finland a few larger towns operated under charters derived from German Town Law but the rural areas were still based on local Norse laws. It was a similar situation in Lithuania, the town charters were based on German Town Law but the rural areas were governed according to an ecclectic mix of local Baltic traditions. Formal and informal law in medieval society. One of the curious aspects of Medieval law in Central Europe generally and the Baltic in particular was that there was always a certain gap between the law as written and the law as practiced. Locals were reluctant to add new ‘official’ laws to the books because once written down; they could be misused. Traditions of all kinds were usually in place for a long time before they became law: towns\n\nKrosl, from the travelogue of Count Palatine Ottheinrich, 1536\n\nAs a result, sometimes Centuries-old laws had certain well known loopholes which the community remained happy to exploit. Only when a significant faction within the community became sufficiently dissatisfied with the status quo did the written laws change, often after a war or an uprising. The gap between law as written and law as practiced caused great confusion among generations of historians: The law books, especially the old Roman laws, were harsh and often capricious, and varied unpredictably from community to community. But the actual court transcripts indicated a far more moderate regime in practice in most places. Anti-social crimes like a secret killing (the legal definition of murder in Germanic law often included secrecy) or theft, or any antisocial crime done against the community, typically resulted in severe treatment. Most other things seemed to be handled with fines, public censure, or even just stern public lectures by the Schöffe. In more serious cases where some doubt as to guilt or culpability remained, exile was the most typical expedient. Alternatively, the Church might send a miscreant on a pilgrimage or some other act of penance to expiate their sin. Even serious sins like manslaughter could sometimes be redressed by a pilgrimage.\n\nPage 13 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nAccusatory vs. inquisitional law One major difference between almost all forms of medieval law and law today, is the nature of prosecution and accusation. Under medieval “accusatory” law, if the accuser couldn’t prove the guilt of the accused, it was they (the accuser) who would suffer the punishment. Wherever there was any doubt as to guilt, it was possible, at least in theory, for the accused to demand trial by ordeal or trial by combat. By the High Medieval period, these extreme measures were falling out of favor, but the legacy of the accusatory system remained – people rarely faced corporeal punishment (meaning anything from death to wounding to beatings) unless they were caught redhanded, no matter how serious the crime.\n\nNight-watchmen being paid their salaries in Sienna, anonymous circa 1440.\n\nLaw and Punishment Formal punishments included capital punishment, torture, imprisonment, temporary (usually a year and a day) or permanent exile (one hundred years and a day), and cash fines of all sorts which were the most common type of sanction. Petty crimes were usually dealt with by a small cash fine, some form of ostracism or public scolding, or in the worst cases, corporeal punishment such as a beating, branding or maiming. In the towns, burghers feared exile in particular. Noncitizens (whether visitors or nominal residents) were at much more risk of corporeal punishment or for serious crimes, execution. Needless to say if one was guilty, the magistrate was to be avoided, because a robber, murderer or rapist caught red-handed was going to meet their maker in short order. A basic understanding of the law was critical to the conduct of both commerce and warfare. This was made trickier by the multiple types of law practiced in Central Europe: Church law, Imperial law, German Town Laws, Feudal law, Hanseatic League law, Polish law, Russian law, Nordic law, Lithuanian law and so on. It was not always immediately obvious which legal system has jurisdiction over a given situation, but if you had friends establishing jurisdiction could be one way out of trouble. It wasn’t unusual for malefactors to shop their case around to different jurisdictions seeking a milder punishment.\n\nThis means in order to be severely punished for a crime, one had to be interrupted in the act, or just after the act, as in with blood on your hands (or stolen artifacts on your person). Punishment in such cases tended to be harsh, especially for serious crimes like murder or rape. But due to the comparative rarity of catching someone in the middle of a crime, it was far more common for a cloud of suspicion to be cast over a likely criminal, and for more cautious measures to be taken (such as fines or exile). This was something of a problem for many communities, in particular towns but also abbeys and convents, and rural communities as well. In order for commerce and manufacturing to proceed, for the community to remain safe enough to function and to protect itself from hostile neighbors, it was vital that crime be kept to a minimum and therefore, that swift punishment be meted out to the guilty. The city councils of the towns, the bishops and abbots, and the secular lords of the rural territories needed means by which to enforce the law and punish malefactors, while people traveling from one place to the other needed predictable rules to follow. Harsh punishments could cause dangerous political disruptions if applied in a manner that seemed unfair. Two things were done to remedy the problem, both starting in the High Medieval period. One was to temper the harshness of punishments under Roman Law and Feudal law with more traditional, and often informal or semiformal pre-Christian remedies in which punishments also included public shaming or confessions, warnings or scoldings by authorities (i.e. the town council or by guild aldermen etc.), fines, and temporary or permanent exile, or even things like forcing a malefactor to buy beer for a victim. The second was to codify the town laws into charters, and the regional laws into so-called Mirror of Peoples books.\n\nPage 14 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\ncorpus of canon law, which protected the rights of the priestly estates and The Religious (monks, nuns and friars). Town rights were established in town charters, which were either the result of detailed negotiation between the town and a local prince, or (much more often) they were simply copied from the existing charter of another town (for example, in the Baltic zone most often Lübeck, Kulm, or Magdeburg) and then approved by a local or regional prince. Once a town received such a charter they held onto it like a great treasure, and they would go to war over any attempt to roll back any right they received from such a document ever again. In the charter the citizens of these communities gained many rights and privileges, including specifically freedom from arbitrary punishment by princes. The King and the Pope are great pals in this edition of the Sachsenspiegel, proving that it wasn’t entirely based in reality.\n\nLandrecht, Lehnrecht, Städtrecht The Sachsenspiegel (originally Sassen Speyghel, “The Mirror of the Saxons”), was the first of a series of so-called ‘Mirror of People’ books of law and custom to appear in the German speaking lands in the 13th Century. Other known versions include the Ausburger Sachsenspiegel, the Deutschenspiegel, the Schawbenspiegel, and of particular relevance for the Baltic, the Elbinger Rechtbuche, also known as the Polenspiegel. Like the ancient code of Hammurabi inscribed on public monuments, these were codifications of regional legal and sumptuary traditions which had been made available and accessible to the public, in this case by translating them from Latin into the vernacular, i.e. German dialect. In the case of the Elbinger Rechtbuche this was in both German and Polish. The Sachsenspiegel (et al) codified two kinds of law and tradition. Landrecht, or the land laws, was mostly derived from traditional tribal law and had to do with land rights, marriage and property rights, weights and measures and so on. There were special courts set up to deal with both civil and criminal cases under Landrecht. Then Lehnrecht, the feudal law (or law of Lehsmannen, the law of vassals), governed feudal rights and responsibilities in traditions dating back to the Carolingian era. This type of law had its own courts, and was the concern mainly of nobles, but also to some extent to people who had business with nobles. Significantly, it covered feuds or fehde. Neither of these two traditions had much to say about town rights (Städtrecht) or urban law however, and they also did not emphasize Canon or Church law either. So these other estates had to enforce their own statutes and convene their own courts. The Church of course already had centuries of legal tradition to draw on in their complex\n\nThe Elbinger Rechtbuche is one of the most interesting of these legal codices because it included both German and Polish traditional law (Landrecht) and therefore gives us a fascinating insight into Polish common law traditions going back into pre-Christian times. As with the other books, some of these laws were quite strange, and many of the punishments were rather harsh, some of the special rights were also quite wild. But we now know from examining court records that the courts were hesitant to impose draconian punishments where guilt was uncertain or possible ameliorating circumstances existed. This was not so much out of kindness so much as caution, as harsh punishments could have severe social, legal and sometimes military ramifications for the judges. The domination of the Dominus All caution and equivocation could go out the window however whenever the judge or magistrate either was (or represented the wishes of) a major prince. Princes such as the King of France, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Order, or the Margrave of Brandenburg had no compunctions about issuing sentances with the harshest punishments from the old Roman laws, and were far less concerned about the consequences of executing rivals, miscreants, or just about anyone who rubbed them the wrong way. Late Medieval society was a patchwork of different types of governments, and neither the Holy Roman Empire nor Prussia (after 1454) had a single ruler who could impose their will freely. But within those large regions there were many smaller communities which did have rulers whose will was essentially unchecked. In communities like towns, peasant clans, or religious communes where there was some degree of self governance (and protection from the arbitrary whims of princes), a similarly harsh regime of punishment could still be unleashed under two specific circimstances: If the miscreant is an outsider, with no diplomatic clout, there was far less concern over the consequences of severe punishment. And if the accused was known, but widely\n\nPage 15 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nunpopular, they could find the consensus turning swiftly against them, and harsh punishment may be the result. Thus it was always wise in any medieval community to keep at least a few friends and allies invested in your good fortune.\n\nOn the left, a mercenary named Hans Spiess is broken on the wheel in the town of Lucerne in 1506 AD. After losing a lawsuit to his mistress Margaret, he allegedly smothered her with a pillow the day after he was forced to deliver her alimony payment. He refused to confess the murder under torture, so he was forced to confront her corpse in a strange mystical ordeal called a Bahrprobe, and when auspices indicated his guilt, was broken on the wheel and executed. On the right, Executions in France in the 15th Century, from Jean Froissarts Chronicles. This was the execution of the Breton knight Olivier de Clisson, whose capricious trial and execution so outraged his wife Jeanne, that she sold their family property to equip a three ship pirate fleet with which she successfully terrorized the French for several bloody years, sinking dozens of ships, before she finally retired to England with her children. Harsh punishments were often favored by mighty princes but could have unintended consequences.\n\n(from leaving permanent scars and disfigurement to outright crippling or death). Needless to say, even first degree was usually enough in most cases to get what was wanted, and third degree was rarely practiced, as it could lead to consequences from friends and relatives of the accused. The towns used their magistrate’s authority to use torture in interrogation to help enforce their Landfrieden (freedom of the roads), protecting their commerce from bandits both low or high born, and protecting their trade monopolies and special rights from smugglers and hostile corporations. However, rights acquired both within town entities (like guilds) and externally under feudal law meant that many were effectively immune from interrogation under torture if they had any social standing, except in the most extreme cases. The most common form of torture was during an execution for particularly severe crimes for which the accused was actually caught in the act: Murder of children, treason, rape of a town citizen or a noblewoman, arson causing death and so on. Crimes of this nature were punished by breaking on the wheel or other gruesome equivalents. If accused of such a severe crime, some criminals would flee to the Church to appeal for an alternative (and usually lesser) sentence, which could be enforced. The Church appreciated the income from fines, and there was actually competition between the urban, princely, and Church courts to judge cases.\n\nTorture Though torture as a form of interrogation remained illegal in Europe during the early middle Ages, at least on an official basis, it was partially legalized by Pope Innocent IV's bull Ad exstirpanda of 12521, which authorized and regulated its use when investigating heresy. From that point it very gradually gained a foothold in the Latin Christian legal system and over time torture became a more acceptable and even common form of punishment for certain types of very serious offenses like murder, and in cases where guilt seemed likely but was not proven, it was relied upon as a means of investigation of serious crimes. Torture or the threat of torture increased the fear of legal authority in general. Torture had three degrees which varied in intensity depending on the specific place and jurisdiction. The first degree was either just showing the accused the instruments of pain, or alternately ‘soft’ tortures such as water-boarding. The second degree was actually using the devices in tortures that (in theory) did not leave permanent marks. The “third degree” was basically going all-out to the point of permanent harm\n\nJudicial Combat Another possible way out of serious legal trouble was judicial combat. This right was granted to persons of some status, normally it was a privilege reserved for aristocrats, burghers, or churchmen, but with the right sponsor a litigant with a martial background finding him or herself in legal difficulty could fight (or even hire a champion) instead of facing the magistrate. Aristocrats and patricians had the right to fight in armor, lower ranking commoners had to fight unarmored or in light armor (gambeson) with\n\nPage 16 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nno helmet. Fights were rarely to the death but defeat was considered a guilty verdict and the loser could face further punishment. Judicial combats were very rare and used as a last resort in cases where one individual’s word was against the other. Usually centered on some very serious accusation or insult. The threat of having to actually fight was often enough pressure for both parties to eventually reach a settlement, as the risks were obviously enormously high. If either party required training, the fight was further delayed and training provided by the local authorities for a period of 3 months, and at any point during this time the accuser could decide to back out. If the case involved soldiers or knights (or burghers experienced in war from the militia) who already had training, the fight would take place sooner and was more likely to occur. “In 1281, Rudolf compelled Philip I, count of upper Burgundy to cede some districts to him, forced the citizens of Berne to pay tribute, and in 1289 marched against Philip’s successor, Otto IV, and compelled him to do homage. He was much less successful, however, in maintaining order in Germany, although in 1289 he led an expedition into Thüringia and destroyed some robber castles.” - Excerpt from the Nuremberg Chronicle, FOLIO CCXVI recto, 1493\n\n“Item, we rode from Anspach to Feuchtwangen and Keylsam. Here in two places certain men set upon my lord with intent to overthrow him. But as everyone, lord, nobleman and page carried his crossbow on his saddle they came to the conclusion that we were too strong for them.” -From the travels of Leo of Rozmital (1467) – Tetzel2.\n\nLaw and War German law acknowledged two types of war, private war (fehde) and public war (krieg). This went back to preChristian traditions but also reflected the ongoing political and military reality: There was no authority within the Holy Roman Empire let alone its affiliated outlying regions which could fully enforce peace between all its constituents. In theory the concept of fehde allowed for disputes to be contained so that local wars did not spill over into regional wars and so that a minimum of damage was done to the social fabric. In practice, while the fehde did act as an outlet for trouble (and probably helped forestall organized revolutions and major regional wars) it also led to a situation in which constant unrest and violence, albeit somewhat limited to robbery and kidnapping rather than murder, made much of the countryside unsafe for travelers and forced towns and princes alike to expend a great deal of energy fighting to keep the roads safe for commerce.\n\nReligion in the Baltic On the lower reaches of society, religion was a sectarian dividing-line which separated one community from another. The dietary rules, fast days and holidays, different modes of dress, grooming and worship which all trickle down from religion, created a very strong cultural barrier between people of the Greek –Christian faith (including the Ruthenians and Russians) and the Latin – Christian faith (including the Germans, Czechs, Poles etc.), separated Jews from gentiles, relegated heathens to the remote wilderness, and created a potent (though not completely insurmountable) political and legal barrier between Christians and Muslims or pagans. The economy of the rural world depended largely on market fairs which were often associated with religious holy-days for various saints. Pilgrimages also accounted for a good portion of both the rural and urban economy, as did the manufacture of religious artifacts, some genuine some spurious. In the higher reaches of society, the language and forms of religion were the framework within which a great deal of administration, business, and entertainment were carried out, and was the principal subject for public art. Cavalry on the march to war, from the Von Wolfegg Housebook, late 15th Century\n\nHowever, while every hour of the day and every day in the calendar was associated with a specific saint or Christian ritual, the actual level of immersion in the religion for\n\nPage 17 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nordinary people was not as all-encompassing or rigid as it was in earlier and would be in later, more religious periods, or even in some places today. Christianity was ubiquitous, but ultimately the prevailing culture: Social life and politics of the community, local stories and legends, the guild, the confraternity, the family and clan, the local festivals and perhaps the patron saint as personification of all or any of the above mattered more than the poorly understood deeds of the eras of the distant past or theology. Even the deeds of Moses and the Apostles.\n\nthe patron saint of their craft, their family, their valley, their town, or maybe some other confraternity or group they belonged to than of fully understanding all of the mysteries of the Holy Trinity.\n\nOne important factor in this was the uneven dissemination of religious fluency and literacy around the land. While literacy in the vernacular was commonplace in the towns at least, and not extremely unusual even in the countryside, literacy in the language of the Church (Latin, for the Catholics, or Greek or Old Church Slavonic, for the Russians, Greeks and East-Slavs), was much rarer, and more limited to the elite. Even priests were often illiterate in Latin in the more remote rural areas and many simply memorized the sounds of the Masses they gave without fully knowing the meaning. Most of the laity of course did not understand Latin except for a few common words and phrases, so did not necessarily grasp the meaning of the mass. During conversion of north-eastern Europe, spiritual submission to the authority of the Church was initially accomplished only among the elites, and it took generations for this to filter down to the common people.\n\nThe Altar in St. Mary’s Cathedral, Danzig\n\nNevertheless, religion was the basis of much of the ethics, public morality, and a considerable amount of the law in East-Central Europe on both sides of the Latin / Greek Orthodox divide, and had a strong influence on intellectual life at all levels. But for the ordinary person, it was more a matter of going through familiar rituals and identifying with\n\nAlbrecht of Riga, the mighty and transformative bishop of Livonia in 1211, statue on the outside of the Riga Cathedral.\n\nWhile religion was pervasive and required everyone adhere to certain practices, language, and rituals, many of the rituals were actually hold outs from earlier preChristian tribal traditions that were much older than Christianity itself. Christian Holy Days were layered over pagan solstice celebrations and feast days, local river or mountain deities were replaced by saints with some superficial symbolic similarity, (a river god might be replaced by a saint who was martyred by being drowned in a river, for example) but people weren’t necessarily fooled by the façade. Nor did it matter that much to the common folk if the harvest celebration was done in the name of a pagan god or a Christian saint. The party and rituals may have been a bit tamer, but weren’t really all that different. This was particularly true in the Baltic where conversions happened fairly late. The Poles, perhaps the most ardently Christian in the region, converted in the 9th Century, the Saxons were converted by Charlemagne also in the 9th (but forcibly, at the point of a sword). The Swedes and Czechs converted in the 10th Century, the Latvians, Estonians, Prussians etc. not until the 13th or 14th Century (again very much by force), and the Lithuanians were still only partly converted to Christianity in the 15th (through a very cautious diplomacy by the Poles, force from the Teutonic Knights having failed).\n\nPage 18 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nSt. Vitus Cathedral, Prague\n\nThe famous Black Madonna of Częstochowa, one of the (literally) iconic images of Polish Catholicism\n\nContrary to popular depictons, medieval society was not typically as fanatically devout or hyper-moralistic as say, 17th Century Puritans. Many of the activities that would seem normal today also went on in medieval society more or less openly (or just beneath a thin veneer of plausible deniability). The Church assured that this veneer of respectability was maintained, but their influence over day to day social mores was limited, especially over matters deemed more or less harmless by the community at large, for example dancing, music, public nudity and pre-marital sex. Public art commissioned by Popes and bishops in the 15th Century was considered shocking and scandalous in the 17th Century, and was even still raising eyebrows (and instigating censors) in the 19th and early 20th. The medieval Latin Church condemned sins and vices, and people did fear purgatory and hell, but rarely to the point of hysteria, and in fact, probably not enough to always maintain decorum: often the authorities found themselves hard-pressed to keep order. Fanaticism was frowned upon, even by the Church itself, as fanatics were associated with insanity and heresy. Sometimes the line between sainthood and serious legal trouble or treatment for mental illness was a rather narrow one.\n\nPeople were also very cynical about the Church. Prelates (bishops, archbishops, abbots and so on) were openly appointed on the basis of patronage and as often as not, naked military power or bribes, rather than any special qualities of holiness, wisdom or erudition. The selling of Church offices, called Simony, was a controversial though widespread practice throughout medieval Europe. Another practice which was simultaneously extremely popular and widely condemned was the selling of Indulgences (time off from purgatory), something both the Church writ large and local prelates did fairly routinely in the 15th Century when they needed money. Furthermore, when involved in disputes with kings, towns, princes, or each other, the Vatican and local church leaders (prelates) were overly fond of using their ultimate weapon: the ‘ban-hammer’ of excommunication and interdiction. This happened so often that the effects were wearing off. At any one time dozens of cities, whole regions and entire kingdoms were under interdict (a temporary form of excommunication) and yet life went on. This created a constant tension between local people, especially in the German-speaking and other northern areas, and the Church authorities who were seen as cynical, corrupt and out of touch. It all contributed to the diminishing respect for the Church as an authority, especially over secular matters. Factions within the Church were also routinely at-odds. So when the bishop or the pope put a town under interdict, town authorities could always find for example Franciscans or members some other religious Order who were willing to say mass, preside over weddings and funerals, baptize babies and perform all the other duties that the town actually needed the Church for. At the same time, the Dominicans would condemn the Franciscans for disobeying the Pope or the Bishop and would preach\n\nPage 19 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nagainst them at every opportunity. Common people didn’t know who to believe. In the end, they stopped worrying about it so much.\n\npregnant (or pregnant again) or too debased and infamous for a possible later arranged-marriage. Needless to say, this was not a recipe for discipline and good behavior. By the 15th Century convents and monasteries were routinely being shut down due to outbreaks of drunken orgies, prostitution, homosexuality and other sexual “misconduct”, and monasteries were frequently embarrassing pits of drunkenness, abuse, and slovenly behavior, with certain religious Orders in particular gaining a bad reputation, sometimes leading to investigations by the Church and even entire Orders being shut down. Nor was this the only type of trouble caused by the Religious. In the early 1300’s the Franciscan Order got itself in serious trouble with the Church over issues of doctrine (the Franciscans advocating poverty for all members of the priesthood), at least four prominent Franciscans were burned by the Inquisition in 1318. In the late 14th Century some abbeys were even conducting military raids against rival monasteries and neighboring castles or villages.\n\nCrucifix in St. Mary’s Church, Kraków, Poland. Photo by Bart Van den Bosch\n\nScandalous Monks and Nuns One of the biggest problems the Church faced in fact was maintaining control over its own religious orders and their lay equivalents in the Minor Orders and Christian associations. Generally speaking, The Religious, as they were called (monks, friars and nuns) could range from zealous reformers to restive miscreants. The convents and monasteries were well known to be temporary or permanent dumping grounds for the ‘excess’ children of the nobility, since especially in those areas under the law of primogeniture, (in which the senior male of the aristocratic household took all the wealth and all the titles), second, third, fourth and fifth brothers and sisters could be inconvenient to have around (though they might be needed later). Daughters and nieces of prominent noble families were often dispatched to live in convents until a suitable husband could be found for them, (or if they got unexpectedly pregnant) without necessarily having any particular religious’ enthusiasm, or realistic prospects of ever getting a husband. They were instead put into a kind of holding pattern, and supervised so as not to become\n\nLaw and Sexuality The legal rules around various sexual practices in the medieval world ranged widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and could even vary within a community because there were potentially at least three legal authorities – the Church, the seigniorial (Feudal) courts, and those of the municipal or lay community. Very generally speaking however, if you divided Christian Europe into several communities – Northern, Central, Southern, West and East, the enforcement of sexual mores followed certain patterns. In the West (England, France, Spain) and East (i.e. Russia and the Orthodox Christian lands) the laws were probably the strictest. What at the time were considered sexual crimes, such as adultery, fornication, abortion and homosexuality (particularly sodomy) were often strictly punished. This didn’t mean they were rare. In parts of Southern Europe, notably in the Iberian Peninsula punishments for adultery were notoriously strict and harsh. Prostitution on the other hand was as a rule, tolerated rather than prosecuted in the late medieval period, but this could mean either a kind of tacit decriminalization or outright open practice with administrative oversight from the town. In Italy however, albeit with a fairly wide variance, in practice there seemed to be a great deal of de-facto tolerance for homosexuality in some communities. The authorities in many Italian cities, perhaps most famously Florence, appeared to make little serious effort to control or even conceal the sexual activity between men. This was\n\nPage 20 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\ncertainly not universal by any means, but it could be said that was not rare either. According to one estimate, roughly half of the male population of Florence was criminally charged with “sodomy” during a 70 year period in the 15th Century 3 . Often these were older men in relationships with younger men. Some even conducted informal marriages. Despite the large number of investigations, less than 3,000 of the total number were convicted by city authorities, and the vast majority were only issued fines, which many did not pay4.\n\nVery generally speaking, most men in Italy did not marry until they were in their 30’s, while the bride was typically in her late teens6 7. The new married couple often lived with the extended family of the husband. This is in contrast to Northern Europe where most of these practices were different. “In parts of Germany, Flanders, Switzerland and Scandinavia, a level of sexual contact between men and women in their late teens and early twenties was sanctioned. Although these traditions - known as ‘bundling’ and ‘night courting’ - were only described in the 19th Century, historians believe they date back to the Middle Ages. \"The girl stays at home and a male of her age comes and meets her,\" says Colin Heywood from the University of Nottingham. \"He's allowed to stay the night with her. He can even get into bed with her. But neither of them are allowed to take their clothes off - they're not allowed to do much beyond a bit of petting.\" Variants on the tradition required men to sleep on top of the bed coverings or the other side of a wooden board that was placed down the centre of the bed to separate the youngsters. It was not expected that this would necessarily lead to betrothal or marriage. “ -from the BBC World Service, “What medieval Europe did with its teenagers”, William Kremer, 23 March 2014, retrieved 21 May 2020\n\nThe devil tempts men to embrace, from the Bible Moralisee, 13th Century\n\nWhile Florence was perhaps an outlier in Italy in terms of tolerance, Venice was on the other extreme, and probably the most significant exception to this general rule, being similar to Northern Europe. Venice was far stricter in punishing ‘sodomy’ and other crimes linked to homosexuality, and the punishments could be severe 5 . Again, that did not necessarily mean it was effective in curtailing such practices, though it certainly made them a bit more clandestine. It is important to reiterate however, we don’t actually know what people did behind closed doors. All we can say is what the laws, legal records and documentation appear to indicate. And that tells us there was tolerance in some places. It was also in Venice, which formally legalized and regulated prostitution in 1358, where female prostitutes could rise above the level of a common sex worker. Most famously there was a semi-recognized status assigned to the cortigiana onesta ‘honest courtesan’, a role somewhat analogous to a Geisha in Japan. Venetian courtesans of the higher category were educated and sophisticated, and could openly socialize with patricians and aristocrats. Some, like the famous 16th Century humanist courtesan Veronica Franco became courtiers with real power and influence. This practice later spread to some other Italian cities including Rome.\n\nA Swedish couple engaged in ‘Nattfrieri’, or ‘night-courting, from 1912. The practice continued in Sweden until the early 20th Century. In this version the man is supposed to stay above the blanket. Images public domain.\n\nIn Northern and Central Europe, the marriage pattern and the formal and informal laws governing fraternization between young men and women varied sharply from the common practice in the South, East or West. The requirement for female virginity was not nearly as strict in Northern Europe. Most couples married when both the man and the woman were at the age of about 258, and wide age disparities between husband and wife were rare, though the household was more isolated in the sense of being a ’nuclear family’, and did not have as much support from the in-laws. It was also commonplace for girls and boys to spend unsupervised time together. In some cases, parents even allowed overnight visits between teenage boys and girls, as long as certain limits were adhered to (i.e. no pregnancy would result).\n\nPage 21 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\nWomen arguably had a somewhat higher social visibility in towns north of the Alps, with a little bit more freedom to roam around. In fact, women (mostly servants) made up the majority of the urban population in most Central European cities. Husbands and wives also routinely drank together in pubs and married women or widows could go to taverns (usually in groups or with family) without much notoriety. Men and women bathed naked in the same bath-houses and hot springs. Promiscuity was frowned upon, but some sexual ‘play’ or activity between unmarried people was not considered unusual particularly during certain major feast days like Carnival. Unlike in Southern Europe, prosecutions for adultery were relatively rare and tended to be mostly punished by fines, whereas prosecutions for “sodomy”, while also rare, could be extremely harsh, routinely including exile, corporeal punishment and execution. However, in both cases authorities tended not to involve themselves unless some kind of social disturbance had arisen forcing the matter to their attention. Female homosexuality seemed to have drawn far less attention from the secular and religious authorities than that among males, particularly in Northern and Central Europe. Prosecutions of women for same sex relationships (also technically considered “sodomy”) were extremely rare 9 . In the Southern Low Countries (meaning mostly what is today Belgium) in the 150-year span between 1400 and 1550 only 25 women were tried for this crime. Apparently only a handful of cases could be found by academic researchers in the Holy Roman Empire in the same period, and none in Scandinavia or Poland. Prior to 1532 only one city in Central Europe (Bamberg) even had a formal law against female Homosexuality.\n\nnunnery and the most beautiful nuns I have ever seen. There we saw in the church a fine coffin in which was the holy St. Quirinnus. We saw his skull out of which they gave us to drink. They receive no-one in the nunnery who is not of noble birth. They may leave the nunnery to get married. The mother superior invited my lord as her guest, and gave a fine dance in the nunnery. The nuns were very finely dressed and knew all the best dances. Each one had her own page who waited on and preceeded her. They all lived as they wished. I can say that never in my whole life have I seen so many beautiful women in a nunnery.” -The travels of Leo of Rozmital – Tetzel, 146710.\n\nWomen and the Church The relationship between women and the Latin Church was complex and somewhat fraught in Medieval Europe. On the one hand women were among the most ardent Christian worshipers, and female saints, especially the Virgin Mary, were extremely popular. Arguably the Cult of Mary was the strongest in the entire Church in almost every part of Europe, including in particular in the Baltic – Livonia was known as Terra Marina, the ‘Land of Mary’, the Teutonic Order was dedicated to Mary, and she was deeply venerated in Russia and Poland as well. Every Hanseatic city was dominated by a giant Church of St. Mary, the one in Danzig held 25,000 people.\n\nThe Danaïdes kill their husbands, miniature by Robinet Testard, late 15th century\n\nStatue of Heilweige Bloemaert on the façade of the town hall of Brussels.

Women were often ridiculed in sermons and\n\nPage 22 of 231\n\nCodex guide to the Medieval Baltic\n\ntheological essays, blamed for sexual deviancy and associated with sin, particularly the sins of wrath, lust, greed, pride, and envy. Church sermons, thousands of which have survived to posterity, criticize women for being overbearing, for being overly sexualized, and for influencing men to do all kinds of wrongs. This of course stems all the way back to the creation story, wherein Eve convinces Adam to do the Devil’s bidding. According to medieval Church doctrine, women during their period, and during or after pregnancy were ‘unclean’ and were not permitted inside Churches or any sanctified buildings, in some cases for up to a year after giving birth (one can only imagine how traumatizing this must have been for highly religious mothers, especially if they experienced postpartum depression). Women couldn’t be priests, of course, and the highest official rank they could achieve within the Church was an abbess. An abbess, particularly an Imperial abbess could become quite powerful, and she was a prelate (and therefore in many cases, a prince) just like an abbot or a bishop. But there were only so many convents.\n\nfamily or built a strong support base in the guilds, in a trading company, or from a religious following. A famous example of such a resourceful woman is the influential courtier, author and Humanist Christine de Pisan, who originating in Venice, went on to become a powerful intellectual figure as a courtier in Burgundy and France. Her popular Book of the City of Ladies ridiculed the kinds of ‘women are icky’ arguments put forth by some of the famous theologians of her day (particularly certain Dominicans) and provided strong and convincing counterarguments and examples of forthright women from history and Classical and Biblical sources. Aside from intellectuals like de Pisan, unofficial and unsanctioned female lay mystics could also become locally very powerful, particularly in the cities. Perhaps the most famous woman of this type was Jean D’Arc, the maid of Orlea"
