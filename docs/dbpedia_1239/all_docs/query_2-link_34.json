I suspect that in few arenas is any¬ one so indebted to so many as in research and writing. This modest volume, while intended only as a brief introduction, has been made better because many cared enough to contribute their ideas and sup¬ port. To them, I extend my warmest thanks. In particular, Paul Toews, director of the Center for Mennonite Brethren Stud¬ ies, has been most helpful and encourag¬ ing in this effort, and has provided the initiative that led to the publication of this manuscript by the Center. Also, Kevin Enns-Rempel, archivist of the Center, has made very useful editorial and biblio¬ graphic suggestions. Special thanks are due to Aniela Przywuska, archivist of the Gdansk State Archives. Her tireless searching often led me to important sources. I also want to thank Edmund Kizik of the University of Gdansk for verifying a number of Polish names of vil¬ lages that once bore German names. In addition, it is a special pleasure to thank those whose financial support helped to make this publication possible. Summer 1988 The face of Europe has changed dramatically since this book appeared in 1989. New states have emerged, and boundaries have changed. For the new maps of the Kaliningrad region and Galicia (now part of Ukraine), I am especially grateful to friends who have made important contributions: Gary Nachtigall, who for many years has taught geography at Fresno Pacific University, and his associate Richard Milhorn, accomplished cartographer. Thanks also to Alan Peters, noted genealogist and helpful advisor; Roland Bergthold, Fresno, and Glen Linscheid, Butterfield, Minn., who supplied mountains of important material about Mennonites in Galicia, from early settlement until the tragedies of World Warll. In addition, one of the benefits of expanding one’s horizons is the joy of discovering new kin¬ dred spirits. 1 am especially grateful to Bolek Klein and the late Dr. Arkadiusz Rybak, both builders of bridges of understanding between Mennonites and Poles, and to superb guides Alexandra Borodin and Ela Tujakowska, who led us on wonderful journeys of discovery. Also, spe¬ cial thanks to Pani Borodin for translating Homeland for Strangers into Polish (Ojczyzna dla Przybyszow). I also wish to thank Joel Klaassen, skilled printer and patient critic who gave excellent pro¬ fessional advice and printed this volume. Fresno, Summer 2011 FOREWORD From Reformation times until the end of World War II—a full four centuries— the Vistula River basin provided a home¬ land for numerous Mennonite communi¬ ties. The large majority of these people had their roots in the Low Countries; they had come to seek religious freedom and economic opportunity in the lands along the Vistula. While fires of persecution still formed part of the landscape in much of Reform¬ ation Europe, many regions under the Polish crown offered a large measure of religious toleration. As Poland's main artery of trade, the Vistula provided ready access to numerous ports of trade, includ¬ ing those in the Low Countries. At the same time, many of the fertile lands along the river were still marshlands waiting to be reclaimed. For the Netherlanders, many of whom were Mennonites, this sit¬ uation provided an opportunity to match technical skill with economic need. It is not surprising that, as civil war and reli¬ gious persecution swept much of the Low Countries, many Mennonites decided to take advantage of the opportunities pre¬ sented by a tolerant Polish crown. During the 16th and early 17th centuries, Men¬ nonites settled along the great river, from the delta south to Thorn and beyond. In the late 18th century, when Prussia gained control of these regions, Men¬ nonite development here continued; however, it soon became apparent that the new regime was more restrictive than the former, more relaxed Polish government. Restrictions were soon placed on acquisi¬ tion of land; traditional Mennonite practices were challenged. As a result, a number of Mennonites decided to seek opportunities elsewhere. Late in the 18th century, many accepted the invitation of Tsarina Catherine II to settle on the fertile plains of South Russia; others moved to establish new homes in the United States. Throughout these times of change and development, the Mennonite community in what was now a part of Prussia, and later, of Germany, continued to prosper. Large, active congregations flourished here until the end of World War II. Today, the informed visitor to these regions will find numerous evidences of Mennonite contributions to the fertile lands along the Vistula. This brief intro¬ duction is designed to suggest some of the remarkable legacies left from four cen¬ turies of Mennonite settlement. The observant visitor to the lush meadows, fertile farmlands and numerous villages will quickly see that, despite political changes and the relocation of former inhabitants of the area, the Mennonite contribution to the garden of the Vistula continues to shape the life of people living there. At the same time, it is apparent that many of the persons now living along the Vistula, as well as the descendants of those who originally drained much of this area and otherwise helped to create a prosperous homeland, know little about the remarkable drama enacted here cen¬ turies ago. The Dutch Mennonites came as strangers, yet were given a remarkable welcome. Later Polish kings repeatedly confirmed the rights granted the settlers; indeed, monarchs pointed with pride to the economic prosperity created along the Vistula. Along its banks and in other low- lying areas, the marshlands provided new hope and new opportunity. The strangers had found a new home. It is my hope that the reader will find this brief overview a stimulus to further study and reflection. A more complete monograph, based upon extensive archival sources, is currently under prepa¬ ration. Some readers may be encouraged to visit contemporary Poland and see the evidences of an earlier Mennonite pres¬ ence. This slender volume includes photographs of all former Mennonite church buildings still in use, although in many cases no longer serving as houses of worship. A note about names may be useful. Since World War II, most formerly German names in Poland have been given Polish names or new designations. In most cases, I have retained the names used during the period under discussion. Thus, Danzig becomes Gdansk in 1945. In some instances, well-established forms of the name, such as Warsaw, are used throughout. On the banks of the Vistula, Summer 1988 Addendum to the 1988 Foreword Since the first edition of Homeland for Strangers was published, a number of encouraging developments have brought new interest in the study of Mennonites in Poland. The Foreword in the 1988 edi¬ tion mentioned a forthcoming book on the Mennonite story here, and Mennonites in Early Modern Poland and Prussia has been published (Johns Hop¬ kins, 2009). In addition, other recent publications, such as Mark Jantzen’s Men¬ nonite German Soldiers (2010), an English edition of H. G. Mannhardt’s Die Danziger Mennonitengemeinde (The Danzig Men¬ nonite Church, translated by Victor Doerksen; edited and annotated by Mark Jantzen and John D. Thiesen, with an epi¬ logue by Tomasz Ropiejko), as well as an impressive array of scholarly articles, have brought greatly enhanced interest in the saga of Mennonites in Poland and in areas that used to be part of Poland. This renewed interest has been widely shared. In 1988, the formation of the Mennonite-Polish Friendship Association, with an international advisory board, soon to be followed by similar associations in the Netherlands and Germany, helped to bring hundreds of visitors to former Mennonite historical centers in the regions of their earlier homeland. This strong interest in Mennonite life in east- central Europe brought significant personal involvement in—and financial support for—restoration of cemeteries, museum renovation and exhibits, school projects, research projects, and personal friendships. Tours to historical sites have drawn hundreds of participants. An additional, important benefit of this strong interest has been the building of better understanding of the Mennonite heritage by Poles; they have responded enthusiastically to this interest in their larger history. It is especially gratifying to note that many strong friendships have developed between visitors and Poles now resident in areas once home to many Mennonites. It has been a special pleasure to see persons return to homes that they were forced to leave at the end of World War II and be welcomed by the present occupants. Quite often, the latter had themselves been evicted from homes as the Soviet Union seized part of eastern Poland. Since the first edition of this book appeared, a remarkable change has oc¬ curred In the Vistula Delta. Cities such as Gdansk, Elbl^g and Malbork are now beautifully rebuilt and flourishing com¬ mercial, educational and artistic centers; similarly, towns such as Nowy Dwor, Nowy Staw and Tczew have become pros¬ perous, attractive urban communities. An attractive, rebuilt museum in Nowy Dwor presents a historical overview of the local Mennonite story, while a few kilometers north of this town a historical park presents a rich variety of former Mennonite life in the region. In addition, the robust village life in the Vistula Delta and beyond reflects the colorful local cul¬ ture. It should be noted that, while the original edition was confined to present areas of Poland, this new edition includes regions once part of East Prussia but now the Russian region of Kaliningrad, as well as that part of Galicia, once Polish, now part of Ukraine.

Three- fourths of a century ago, the first shots of World War 11 were fired there. The result¬ ing conflict dramatically altered the political, social and ethnic configuration of this area. It was there, too, that in the 18th century the rival ambitions of great powers led to the dismemberment of a state. Not surprisingly, the resurrection of that state in the 20th century gave new hope and confidence to a people who ear¬ lier had often been in the vanguard of the new and the progressive. It was, after all, this land on the southern shores of the Baltic and along the Vistula River that had nourished the spirit of the astronomer Copernicus. It was here, too, that many ideals of liberty and human dignity were shaped on the anvil of economic innova¬ tion, political accommodation, diplomatic interaction and social diversity. It was here, while much of Europe was still ravaged by religious intolerance and while many countries were still burning nonconformists at the stake, that kings and other authorities in Poland chose a different way. Whatever the motivations may have been, early modern Poland per¬ mitted religious differences. It is thus not surprising that people who prized reli¬ gious values left intolerant surroundings to live in freedom under the Polish crown. Among those who came to the regions along the Vistula to practice their faith and to find new opportunities were numerous settlers from the troubled Low Countries. During the Reformation Era, with its turmoil and change, these lands experienced savage intolerance. Adher¬ ents of some of the new movements, such as the Anabaptists—here called the Mennonites—decided to seek a haven along the Baltic and the Vistula. Poland welcomed them. From the 1530s until the end of World War II, the regions along the Vistula River were home to numerous Mennonite com¬ munities. Because of changing political conditions, this area was sometimes under Polish—at other times under Prussian (or German) rule. Throughout the centuries, however, the fertile fields along the Vistula continued to nourish many settlers who had originally come from the Netherlands and several regions of Germany. In the late 18th century, as well as much of the 19th century, descendants often moved on to other countries, such as Russia. Others emigrated to the United States in the 19th century. Throughout all the changes, how¬ ever, large congregations continued to flourish and to make the Vistula-Nogata Delta and the lowlands along the Vistula a lush, fertile garden. In the middle of the 17th century, King Wladyslaw IV summa¬ rized the sentiments of the Polish gov¬ ernment: We are well aware of the man¬ ner in which the ancestors of the Mennonite inhabitants of the Marienburg islands (Werder), both large and small, were invited here with the knowledge and by the will of the gracious King Sigismund Augustus, to areas that were barren, swampy and unusable places in those islands. With great effort and at very high cost, they made these lands fertile and productive. They cleared out the brush, and, in order to drain the water from these flooded and marshy lands, they built mills and constructed dams to guard against flooding by the Vistula. Nogat, Haff, Tiege and other streams.' After the king had recounted the accomplishments of the Mennonite set¬ tlers, he reaffirmed “every right, privilege, freedom and custom” granted them by earlier monarchs. Successive rulers reiter¬ ated these assurances, so that for more than two centuries, until the partition of Poland among Russia, Austria and Prussia in the latter part of the 18th century, Mennonites lived under the protection of the Polish crown. At the same time, it must be noted that although Mennonites in most areas along the Vistula enjoyed a remarkable measure of religious toleration, during the 16th and 17th centuries they were often referred to as heretics. Various restrictions by Catholic and Protestant authorities made it clear that Mennonites did not enjoy the same status as did the “official” religions. Thus, in most of this region Mennonites were not permitted to build churches until the latter part of the 18th century. Even then, structural designs were to be distinctly different from state churches and were to resemble regular homes. Numerous other stipulations demon¬ strated the subordinate role given the Mennonites. They were forbidden to gain converts from the state churches. Persons who disregarded this prohibition might be fined or subjected to other penalties. 2 Mixed marriages similarly were forbidden, although they often occurred. Not infre¬ quently, persons wishing to be married to those of another faith but choosing to GULF OF GDANSK GDYNIA .SOPOT GDANSK \"f rombork Nowy Owor' S^Gdarisk IE L BLAG OlSZTYN OSFKODA KWIDZYN GRUDZIAOZ heFmno / ^OsJORUNl IYOGUSZCZ Clecbocinek INOWROCIAU lorisk WbOCtAWtK PbOCK .Wyszogrod WARSZAWA NORTH CENTRAL POLAND remain in the Mennonite churches would travel to Holland, be baptized there, then return to their homes. 3 Sometimes authorities tried to have children of mixed marriages baptized In the local Catholic or Lutheran church.' The fact that prohi¬ bitions of intermarriage were issued repeatedly suggests that they must have been rather ineffective. Sometimes, government authorities tried to prevent intermarriages by decree¬ ing that marriage of a Mennonite with a non-Mennonite would mean loss of all Mennonite privileges; on other occasions, restrictions on land acquisition were used to try to prevent mixed marriages. 5 Of course, as a report issued in 1692 indi¬ cated, if the couple voluntarily joined a Catholic or Lutheran church, their alliance would be readily sanctioned. It should also be remembered that restrictions varied and often reflected the sentiments of local authorities. Then, with the passage of time, many of the severe limitations were allowed to lapse. As late as the 20th century, however, inhabitants of Elbing were surprised to discover that an old law prohibited the ringing of bells by a Mennonite church. It was quickly rescinded. I THE EARLY HISTORICAL CONTEXT The Hansaand the Teutonic Knights Long before Mennonites began settling near the Vistula in the second quarter of the 16th century, the river, as an important ar¬ tery of trade, had attracted commerce from many trading centers in northern areas of Europe. During the Middle Ages, the Hansa, the north European trading associ¬ ation, established centers of trade on the Baltic coast and along the Vistula River. As a result, traders came from many different countries and often established their own communities in the new homeland. Names such as “Schottland,” a suburb of Danzig, or “Preussisch Holland,\" near Elbing, suggest the origin of the early settlers here. Then, at the same time that merchants of the Hansa were establishing themselves along the shores of the eastern Baltic, or along some of the important rivers, another powerful force began to make its presence felt in these regions. Early in the 13th cen¬ tury, the Teutonic Knights, originally formed to assist with the reconquest of the Holy Land, shifted their interest to crusad¬ ing efforts in the Baltic. There, a local duke, Conrad of Mazovia, was finding it difficult to meet the military challenge of a people known as the “Pruzzen,” the \"Old Prus¬ sians.\" Conrad invited the Teutonic Knights to help him, and so with the blessing of pope and emperor, the Knights moved into the region south of the Baltic. The Teutonic Knights soon established themselves in the area, and began to build castles and towns, as at Thorn (Torun), Kulm (Chelmno), Marienburg (Malbork) and elsewhere. Gradually, the Knights es¬ tablished a state that included most of the Baltic coast east of Danzig (Gdansk) and that stretched south to Thorn. The expanding state soon posed a threat to Polish rule; war resulted. At the battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410, Poland and her allies defeated the Knights, but no satisfactory peace resulted. War broke out again in 1434, and this time many of the important cities, such as Danzig, Marienburg and Thorn joined the war against the Knights. By the terms of the Peace of Thorn (1466), the western part of the lands held by the Knights came directly 5 A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS 6 Malbork (formerly Marienburg) The massive castle, former headquarters of the Teutonic Knights and residence of the Grand Masters from 1308-1457, dominates this city on the Nogat. Built from the 13th to the 15th centuries, it served as the royal residence when the Polish kings visited this part of the realm. under the Polish crown, now to be known as Royal Prussia. The eastern part remained under the rule of the Knights, but their Grand Master was forced to become a vassal of the king of Poland. In addition, many of the larger trading centers, such as Danzig, Elbing, and Thorn were rewarded for their support of the king. They were given a large measure of self-government and special privileges, although they recognized the Polish king as their ruler. The Reformation in Polish and Prussian Lands Soon after Luther launched his reli¬ gious reform efforts, his message reached the shores of the Baltic. Close commercial ties helped to bring Luther’s writings to cities such as Danzig; the city soon had nu¬ merous champions of the reformation. In addition, in East Prussia, Albert, Grand Master of the Knights, also became a con¬ vert to Luther’s ideas and in 1525 embraced the new faith. At the same time, he re¬ nounced his position as Grand Master, and secularized his lands. As vassal of the King of Poland, he now became Duke of East or Ducal Prussia. Lutheranism became the faith of most of the German-speaking inhabitants of the important trading centers. Repeated efforts by the King of Poland and the church hier¬ archy to stop the growth of “heresy” proved futile. Gradually, Poland developed a policy of toleration that allowed most people to practice their faith without fear of oppres¬ sion. Other Protestant movements also gained a foothold; Calvinism, in particular, won the support of many Polish nobles and of many citizens in the towns. Soon a Calvinist congregation developed in Danzig, in Thorn and elsewhere. In Elbing one of the mayors was a Calvinist. Most of the Protestants, however, were Lutheran. Gradually, cities along the lower Vistula be¬ came largely Lutheran, while much of the countryside remained Catholic. Early Anabaptist-Mennonite Settlers When Anabaptists, or Mennonites, began coming to the Vistula-Nogat Delta in THE EARLY HISTORICAL CONTEXT the 1530s, they came to an area that had al¬ ready felt the first impact of the Reforma¬ tion and that had begun to adopt a relatively tolerant attitude toward religious dissent. This was in stark contrast to condi¬ tions in areas from which the Anabaptists came. In few parts of Europe was the struggle for religious allegiance so bitter and so bloody as in the Low Countries. First under Emperor Charles V, then under Philip 11 , Spain determined to keep this area loyal to the traditional faith. When, during the first half of the 16th century, Anabaptism gained many followers here, they were subjected to savage repression. Their story of persecu¬ tion and suffering has been recorded in the Martyrs Mirror. One of their leaders, Menno Simons, a former Catholic priest, joined the movement in 1536. Then, as the Low Countries became involved in a strug¬ gle for self-government, an ever more bitter war engulfed the towns and countryside. Not until the latter part of the 16th century did the northern states gain their independ¬ ence as the United Provinces, soon to be known as the Netherlands. During the long struggle, many An¬ abaptists, rejecting the resort to violence but also seeking to find a peaceful existence elsewhere, decided to move to the more tol¬ erant lands along the Baltic. Commonly known as Mennonites, after their Dutch leader Menno Simons, they brought with them their skills as craftsmen, merchants and farmers. It was in the latter category in particular that they found new opportuni¬ ties for their skills as farmers, who could drain the land and thus reclaim swamps, could be put to good use in the Vistula Delta.

Between Danzig and the Vistula, the Danzig Werder—also known as the Little Werder—formed a comparatively narrow but fertile strip of farmland. Then between the Vistula and the Nogat lay the agricultural heartland of this region, the Large Werder, noted for its grain and milk production. To the east, be¬ tween the Nogat and the highlands, the Lit¬ tle Werder similarly was dotted by farms. Together these regions formed a prosper¬ ous, highly productive part of the realm. During the sixteenth century, this region became the new homeland of hundreds of Mennonites who had fled persecution else¬ where, or who had been invited because of their agricultural and commercial skills. During the previous century, war and flooding had left parts of this region deso¬ late. The low terrain and the rivers could create hazardous conditions, especially in times of war when dikes might not be main¬ tained. During the 16th century, new set¬ tlers helped to build higher and stronger dikes, so that flooding dangers were re¬ duced. Special wardens of the dikes were appointed to make sure dikes remained in good condition. It should also be noted that rivers were important avenues for travel, but especially vital for transportation of goods from the interior. The prosperity of a city such as Danzig and of the agricultural communities in the delta was closely related to the Vis¬ tula. It would not be inaccurate to modify a phrase from Herodotus and suggest that Danzig was the gift of the Vistula. Danzig and the Delta Ties between Danzig and the Nether¬ lands rested upon shared commercial inter¬ ests. In the middle of the 16th century, more than a thousand Dutch ships came to Danzig annually. Dutch skill in reclaiming land from the sea was already legendary, and so it was not surprising that the city of Danzig decided to invite Dutch settlers to drain some of the marshlands that the city 9 A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS had acquired following the defeat of the Teutonic Knights. Thus, in 1547 the Danzig city council sent Philip Edzema to the Netherlands to find settlers who might come to farm some of the lowlands under the city’s jurisdiction. Dutch settlers soon restored much of the land to productivity; they built new dikes, dug ditches and drained the land so that it could be farmed. Danzig discovered, however, that many of the newcomers were Anabaptists, or Mennonites, and so the city tried to compel adherence to the approved religion. In 1582 settlers in some of the newly founded villages such as Scharfen- berg, Wotzlaff and Neuendorf petitioned the city government to grant religious tol¬ eration. Describing themselves as “subjects who are derisively called Anabaptists or Mennonites,\" they requested the council to observe agreements made thirty years ear¬ lier, when there had been no attempt to force religious conformity. Eventually the council decided to impose a special tax and grant the settlers’ request for religious lib¬ erty. Other settlements, such as Neunhuben (Dziewi^c Wlok) Gross- and Klein-Wald- dorf (Wielki Waldorf) and Quadendorf (Przejazdowo) were also reclaimed from marshlands. At the same time, the city fol¬ lowed a vacillating religious policy, some¬ times declaring that all religious services by “heretics” were to be stopped. At other times, as in 1650, local authorities prohib¬ ited further acquisition of lands by Mennon¬ ites. Repeatedly, however, the Polish king issued edicts declaring Mennonites free to practice their religion. King Wladyslaw IV in 1642 issued a typical statement: At the humble request of the aforementioned inhabitants of our Marienburg islands, we retain and protect completely, without excep¬ tion, each and every right, privilege, freedom and custom granted by the gracious Sigismund Augustus, our grandfather and confirmed by the gracious Stephen, Sigismund III.... 6 Such assurances of royal support pro¬ vided a very significant measure of protec¬ tion and toleration for the Mennonites coming from the Netherlands. Sometimes, however, the more immediate authorities in the area, such as local lords and city coun¬ cils, adopted policies much more stringent and exclusionary than those promulgated by a distant king. Throughout most of the 16th and 17th centuries the Vistula Delta and other regions along the Vistula re¬ mained a mixture of tolerant and intolerant jurisdictions. In some instances villages were devel¬ oped jointly between Dutch and native set¬ tlers. In Fischerbabke (Rybina), the Dutch SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA drained the land and raised cattle, while the native settlers derived their livelihood from fishing. Other villages, such as Glabitsch (Globica) and Steegnerwerder (Stegienka), also owed their development to collabora¬ tive efforts between Dutch and native set¬ tlers. Sometimes, as in the case of Poppau (Popowo), land that lay below sea level was leased to Dutch settlers. They reclaimed the land and established a small village there. In other villages, they formed part of the population and often simply settled among the native inhabitants. Just west of the lagoon, called the Frisches Haff or the Vistula Bay, and south of the Szkarpawa stream, some of the land lies 1.5 meters below sea level, and thus forms the lowest depression in the area. This region, once called the “Scharpau,” was acquired by Danzig in 1530. The city deter¬ mined to gain some profits from what was then swampy wasteland, and so again in¬ vited Dutch settlers to drain the land. Beier- shorst (Wybicko), and Altebabke (Babki), as well as other areas, were soon made arable, although some of the land remained marshland for decades. In Danzig and Its Environs Prosperous and proud, Danzig domi¬ nated trade in the eastern Baltic during the 16th century. As a major member of the Hansa, the city had come to exert consider¬ able influence far beyond the Polish and Prussian coastlines. Each year several hun¬ dred ships sailed from Danzig for points west. These vessels brought with them a wide variety of commodities as well as peo¬ ple with nontraditional points of view. As early as the 1330s, Danzig began to express concern over the alleged arrival of Anabaptists. Although the city had em¬ braced the Lutheran Reformation and had introduced Lutheran practices throughout most of the numerous churches, opposition to “heresy\" remained vigorous. Nonethe¬ less, Anabaptists continued to come. Often called Mennonites by the middle of the 16th century, they found new homes in Schott- land, an area just south of the city walls of Danzig and owned by the bishop of Wloclawek. A nearby village, Schidlitz, also provided a haven for the Mennonites. Both Schottland and Schidlitz 7 remained major Mennonite centers until the devastation brought by the Napoleonic Wars. For the bishop, economic returns were more convincing than religious uniformity. He permitted the Mennonites to practice their religion and, at the same time, to em¬ ploy their skills as merchants and crafts¬ men. One facet of the cloth trade in particular—the making of braid and lace— developed rapidly within the Mennonite community. As the marketing of these com- A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS modifies began, the Danzig guilds voiced strong opposition and persuaded the Danzig city council to take action against the Mennonite craftsmen and merchants. The economic strife between Danzig and the neighboring villages continued for more than a century. Repeatedly, craftsmen in Danzig persuaded the city council to issue decrees restricting the sale of lace and braid within the city. Members of the cloth¬ making guilds tried to bar Mennonites from both manufacturing and the selling of these products. At the Diet of Thorn in 1571, emis¬ saries from Danzig charged that adherents of “harmful sects” 8 were taking bread out of the mouths of its citizens. Despite such protests from a city as powerful as Danzig, Polish bishops and kings repeatedly as¬ serted and often expanded Mennonite eco¬ nomic rights. Polish rulers, from Sigismund II Au¬ gustus to Stanislaw II Augustus, took the Mennonites under royal protection. On Oc¬ tober 23,1623, King Sigismund III issued a decree confirming clothmaking rights for settlers in Schottland. On December 30, 1634, King Wladyslaw IV reaffirmed and ex¬ tended these privileges, and, in 1642, he is¬ sued a charter of liberties in which he praised the economic productivity of the Mennonites. Later rulers took a similar po¬ sition. On June 22,1649, King John Casimir decreed that the traditional rights of the Mennonites should be upheld. In 1660, when Mennonites in Tiegenhof (Nowy Dwor) and Barwalde (Niedzwiedzica) were threatened with seizure of their lands, he declared them to be under his protection. Again, in 1681, the king firmly informed the city of Danzig that it could not deprive Mennonites of the privileges he had con¬ ferred upon them. Toward the end of the 17th century, King John III Sobieski in¬ structed his officials to make more land and economic opportunities available to Men¬ nonites. In 1784, Stanislaw II Augustus, last of the Polish monarchs, once again issued a vigorous defense of the customary Men¬ nonite rights and privileges. 9 Thus, from the beginning of Mennonite migration to Poland until the extinction of the Polish monarchy, Polish kings usually remained strong champions of toleration toward the Mennonites. Despite such royal protection and favor, Danzig only slowly and grudgingly al¬ lowed Mennonites to settle within the city. In 1656, during war with Sweden, Danzig military commanders decided to strengthen their defensive position by burning villages on the outskirts of the city. Schottland and Schidlitz, where most of the Mennonites in the area lived, were also razed, and so the city council permitted some Mennonite families to settle in the city. Gradually this number increased. At SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA the same time, Mennonites were granted limited trading concessions and were per¬ mitted to buy property, including land, within the city. Soon they built two churches—one each for the Flemish and Frisian groups. Nonetheless, Mennonites were not granted full citizenship, and when the craft guilds complained about the busi¬ ness activities of the Mennonites, King Au¬ gustus III, in sharp contrast to usual royal practice and despite vigorous opposition by an emissary from the Netherlands, issued a decree to restrict Mennonite economic ac¬ tivities. Further acquisition of city land was prohibited; Mennonites were to buy their raw materials only from Danzig citizens; their goods were to be sold only in Danzig. In addition, a Mennonite was not to engage simultaneously in manufacturing and in selling. In Danzig, Mennonites were also granted exemption from military service, although they had to meet various alterna¬ tive obligations to the state. When Danzig was besieged by Russian troops in 1734 and incendiary explosives were thrown into the city, Mennonites were employed to Fight the resulting fires. On other occasions, Men¬ nonites were assessed an additional tax in lieu of war service. Thus, in 1749 King Au¬ gustus III imposed a tax of 5,000 florins on the Danzig Mennonites. The Mennonite Church in Danzig By the middle of the 16th century, Men¬ nonites had established themselves in vil¬ lages outside the walls of Danzig. Menno Simons evidently spent some time here, as¬ sisting the young congregation, for in 1549 he penned a letter to his fellow-believers in Prussia and referred to his visit among them. Menno’s associate, Dirk Philips, took up residence in this area and emerged as the First permanent leader of the Mennonites here. As new congregations arose in low¬ lands along the Vistula, Philips came to cen¬ ters such as Montau and installed elders (ca. 1568). The Danzig Mennonites grew steadily during the latter part of the 16th century, especially as the armies of the Duke of Alva spread Fire and destruction through¬ out much of the Netherlands. Mennonites, as “heretics,” were subject to especially heavy persecution, and so, many tried to Find a new home in the more tolerant cli¬ mate of the Vistula Delta. By 1598 their number in the environs of Danzig had in¬ creased to such an extent that their former elder, Quirin Vermeulen, resident in Schot- tland, printed a Dutch translation of the Bible. 10 At the same time, the divisions that had arisen among Mennonites in the Nether¬ lands were perpetuated in the Danzig area. Thus, both Flemish and Frisian congrega¬ tions arose. The former were more rigid in A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS matters of church discipline, especially in enforcing the ban (exclusion from the con¬ gregation of a member who had violated church practices). As the number of Men- nonites in the Vistula lowlands increased, Flemish and Frisian congregations arose there as well. Both groups retained close ties with similar congregations in the Nether¬ lands. Gradually, the Flemish congregations included Danzig (centered in Schottland), Elbing, the large rural congregation in Rosenort in the lowlands, as well as others. Frisian congregations, in addition to the one in Neugarten, on the outskirts of Danzig, included those in Montau as well as the large rural congregations of Orloffer- felde in the Vistula Delta, and Thiensdorf, in the lowlands just east of the Nogat River. Although Mennonites were permitted to settle on land just outside the city walls, the city of Danzig long remained largely closed to them, both for residence and trade. Mennonites sometimes evaded these restrictions by leasing land or buildings within the city. On the other hand, owners of land, outside the city wall, such as a Catholic bishop who wanted his land made profitable, granted extensive rights to the new settlers. Danzig, however, feared that Mennonites might provide too much eco¬ nomic competition for some of its citizens if the barriers were removed. Thus, throughout much of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, various restrictions were im¬ posed on Mennonites. Indeed, full citizen¬ ship was made available to Mennonites only in 1800. In Danzig, the “third estate” (rep¬ resentatives of the city’s numerous guilds) was especially vocal in its opposition to the Mennonites, for it feared that Mennonite craftsmen would encroach upon the trade enjoyed by the guilds. Economic factors long remained a source of friction between Mennonites and the guilds. When the Peace of Oliwa (1660) ended the war, Mennonites returned to Schottland and other areas where they had previously lived. Despite vigorous objec¬ tions by the third estate, including appeals to the Polish King, John Casimir, Mennon¬ ites were permitted to rebuild their homes and resume their earlier farming and pro¬ duction of various goods. Soon their shops and homes were restored, thanks in signif¬ icant measure to financial aid sent by their fellow-believers in the Netherlands. Once again, Mennonites resumed their weaving, making of lace and braid, as well as various other articles for sale along the Vistula. Royal edicts repeatedly confirmed their rights to manufacture and sell freely. Despite continued attempts at repres¬ sion or expulsion. Mennonites were able to maintain themselves near the city proper, and also to construct their own church buildings. In 1638 the Frisian congregation SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA acquired land near the Neugarten city gate and built its church there. The Flemish con¬ gregation in turn built its house of worship near the Petershagen gate. Both congrega¬ tions immediately constructed hospices for the elderly and needy; the practice of mu¬ tual aid had always been a central teaching of the Mennonites. Fora full two centuries, Mennonites retained their native Dutch language. Cultural and religious ties to the Netherlands delayed full accommodation to the dominant German culture in Danzig and other parts of the Vistula-Nogat Delta. For decades, Danzig church services were still conducted in Dutch. Not until 1762 did the Flemish congregation have its first sermon in German—and then only be¬ cause the preacher was a guest from Elbing, where German was already in use. The adoption of the local language, however, was inevitable, and in 1768 Elder Hans von Steen published a catechism in German.\" Similarly, in 1780 the Danzig Mennonites adopted their first German hymnal. In part it included translated versions of the Dutch Psalms used earlier; in part, it incorporated new songs written by the ministers Peter Thiessen, Jacob de Veer and their associates. Some German Psalms from the Lutheran tradition were also used. While these changes into German were being implemented, the situation in Danzig and, indeed, in all of Royal Prussia was being dramatically altered. In 1772 the first partition of Poland brought the Vistula Delta (but not Danzig) under Prussian rule. In 1793, however, the proud, long independ¬ ent city was forced to accept Prussian rule. Not long thereafter, the Napoleonic Wars brought devastation to Danzig. In 1807 the city fell to besieging French troops, and for seven years, Danzig existed as a \"free state” under French control. During the hostili¬ ties, both Mennonite church buildings were destroyed. Those members who had taken up residence in the city now began holding their church services in an English chapel within the city. When the war ended, the two congre¬ gations faced the task of rebuilding. Their shared loss and destruction had brought them together, and they resolved to unite into one congregation and build one church structure. Accordingly, on July 9, 1818, under the leadership of Abraham de Veer, the congregation began the building of a new house of worship. On September 12, 1819, the new church was dedicated as the “United Frisian and Flemish Mennonite Church.” The structure was packed with vis¬ iting dignitaries and members of the con¬ gregation as Elder Peter Thiessen spoke the solemn words of dedication. From that time until 1943, services were regularly con¬ ducted there. A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS % The title page of the Dutch Bible published by Quirin Vermeulen and printed in Haarlem.

AJ •« * *irr* rMbn«n i dmmj Soca InJciwn SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA Challenge and Change in the 19th Century In many respects, the century between the end of the Napoleonic Wars and the outbreak of World War I witnessed a series of dramatic changes in Danzig and, indeed, in all Mennonite communities of the area. Traditional distinctives were challenged as new economic, political, cultural and na¬ tionalistic realities shaped a new society. Acculturation became increasingly appar¬ ent. In 1800 Mennonites were given rights of citizenship in Danzig; questions con¬ cerning civic rights and responsibilities, in¬ cluding military obligations, became pressing issues for congregations. During most of the following century, Mennonites served in various public offices, including the city council. Others held teaching posi¬ tions in the noted Danzig Gymnasium. Many also became an important factor in the city’s trade and quickly established themselves evermore fully as traders, mer¬ chants, and various kinds of entrepreneurs. Meanwhile, Mennonite religious prac¬ tices also underwent modification. In 1826 the Danzig church decided to adopt a new policy concerning the ministry; the first salaried minister, Jacob van der Smissen, was appointed. This break with entrenched tradition occasioned considerable criticism, but soon other congregations followed suit. Another major change occurred in 1845 when Jacob Mannhardt, then pastor of the Danzig church, founded the periodical, Mennonitische Blatter. In the following decades the paper established itself as the chief literary bond among Prussian, indeed, all German, churches. It served as a forum for discussion and a means for information dissemination until German government authorities stopped its publication in the early stages of World War II. Certainly one of the severest challenges to face Danzig and other Prussian Mennon¬ ites in the 19th century was the issue of mil¬ itary service. For a time after the Prussian seizure of Royal Prussia in 1772, military ex¬ emption was maintained, but Mennonites were compelled to pay a specified amount to help maintain a military academy in Kulm. In addition, further acquisition of lands was prohibited, as military obliga¬ tions were tied to the land. Mennonites re¬ sponded to these restrictions by seeking new lands, especially in South Russia, where the recent conquests of Catherine II had made vast steppes available in the Ukraine. During the greater part of the 19th century, Prussian authorities pressed for the abolition of Mennonite exemption from military obligations. Finally, in 1867, a Prussian edict abolished military exemp¬ tion, although service as noncombatants remained an option. Debate raged through- A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS The Danzig Gymnasium established itself as a major center of learning. Its instructors included the noted Mennonite civic figure Albert Momber as well as the historian Gottfried Lengnich and astronomer Johannes Hevelius. out the Prussian Mennonite community, but in Danzig the answer was decisive; on October 2, 1870, the local Mennonite church unanimously adopted a resolution rejecting the traditional insistence on paci¬ fism. Individual members were now free to make their own choices, although ministers often urged young men to select noncom¬ batant military service. Gradually, however, this emphasis waned, and regular military service became common. A House Divided and Scattered For most Danzig Mennonites, as in¬ deed for most inhabitants of that city, the 20th century brought difficult and frustrat¬ ing change. Following World War I, when the victors created the Danzig Free State, this area soon found itself caught in the middle of a power struggle between larger political and military powers. Eventually, these tensions became a major factor in bringing about the outbreak of World War II. On September 1,1939, the first shots were fired in Danzig territory. The city was quickly seized by German forces. Like other citizens in this center, Mennonites were compelled to support the new government; young men were drafted for military serv¬ ice, and Mennonite congregations sus¬ tained heavy losses. When the war ended, Danzig lay in ruins. Soviet troops took the city in the end of March 1945. By then, many inhabitants had already fled to the west. Others were forced to leave, so that virtually no mem¬ bers of the Mennonite Church remained in the city. The church building had suffered damage but was soon restored to its original purpose. This time, however, parishioners were not Mennonite, nor was the language German. Following negotiations with the postwar Polish authorities, the Polish United Evangelical Church took possession of the structure. Today, a thriving Pente¬ costal congregation worships there regu¬ larly. Four centuries of a Mennonite presence in Danzig seemed largely forgot¬ ten in the new Gdansk, but have recently come to hold a prominent position in local historical memory. SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA Elbing and Vicinity The City As Poland’s major outlet to the Baltic, Danzig tended to dominate economic de¬ velopment in the Vistula Delta. The port of Elbing, however, also figured prominently in the history of this region. Indeed, some¬ times it presented a direct challenge to its more famous rival. Situated just off the la¬ goon known as the Vistula Bay, or the Zalew Wislany, Elbing (Elbing) provided a natural setting for trade. Soon after it was founded by the Order of Teutonic Knights in 1237, merchants from Liibeck and elsewhere es¬ tablished a trading center here. The town became an important outlet for forest and farm products destined for markets in west¬ ern Europe. As a member of the Hansa, El¬ bing had access to substantial markets, although its rival Danzig usually dominated trade coming from the Vistula region. Like a number of other important com¬ mercial centers in the Vistula Delta and fur¬ ther upstream, Elbing eventually found the domination by the Order too oppressive and joined other cities in a war to throw off the yoke of a system that had lost much of its earlier dynamism and vision. In the Thir¬ teen Years War, the League of Prussian Cities, in alliance with the King of Poland, defeated the Order. Elbing declared its al¬ legiance to the Polish crown; the king in turn granted the city a large measure of self¬ rule. In addition, the city was able to retain sizable adjacent lands. As a vassal city-state of King Casimir IV, Elbing was largely free to chart its own course. In 1577 tension between Danzig and Poland’s king, Stephen Batory, erupted into war. In an effort to break Danzig’s economic strength, the king transferred the Hansa center from Danzig to Elbing and decreed that Poland’s exports through the Baltic must pass through Elbing. 12 English traders in particular used this opportunity to ex¬ pand their trade in Elbing, and the Eastland Company, in quest of grain and shipbuild¬ ing materials, established a center in Elbing. Danzig vigorously objected to this loss of its most favored position, but the king tri¬ umphed. For the next half century, the Elbing- English connection brought expanded trade and prosperity to Elbing. Of some 200 ships coming annually to Elbing, one-third came from England. English and Scottish merchants established residence there and were often granted citizenship. Indeed, at least five of them served on the city council during the 17th century, and one of them, Charles Ramsey, became mayor. During the latter part of the 16th century, as many as 97 families settled in the city. At the same time, because a number of them were Calvinists, the reformed faith gained new strength in a city dominated by Lutheranism. Growing A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS religious toleration characterized the vi¬ brant city. For a time, prosperity and toleration became hallmarks of the city. Its economic growth was dealt a severe blow by the Thirty Years War and by the prolonged Polish- Swedish wars in the 18th century. Elbing never fully recovered. When, in 1772, Prus¬ sia, Russia and Austria carried out the First partition of Poland, Elbing and its territo¬ ries fell under Prussian rule. The Elbing Lowlands Commercial ties between the Low Countries and Elbing were already firmly established by the end of the Middle Ages. Then, with the religious upheavals of the 16th century, a new wave of settlers came to Elbing. Because many of the newcomers were Anabaptists fleeing the wrath of the Duke of Alva, questions of religious con¬ formity were soon raised in Elbing. As early as 1531, the Bishop of Ermland (Warmia), who held ecclesiastical jurisdic¬ tion over the city, warned the city council to be on guard against heretics from the Low Countries. Elbing, however, had suffered greatly in the 1319-21 war, so that many vil¬ lages in its hinterland lay desolate. New set¬ tlers were welcome. Some Elbing land- owners invited Mennonites to settle on land near the city, so that a Mennonite commu¬ nity began to develop. Not all of the new¬ comers were content to pursue farming, and by the middle of the century, Elbing craftsmen complained to King Sigismund Augustus about loss of business to the new¬ comers. Although the king ordered their ex¬ pulsion, the effect must have been minimal, for by the 1580s some Mennonites acquired Elbing citizenship. By 1590 Mennonites in the city were permitted to have their own house of worship—the first such permis¬ sion in a major Polish or Prussian city. Despite such positive developments, tensions between Mennonites and citizens in Elbing continued. Craftsmen resented the competition created by the newcomers from the Netherlands, while merchants tried to exclude the Hollanders from what was still a thriving trade with various parts of the Baltic and beyond. Attempts to ex¬ clude Mennonites met with only limited success. In 1572 the city council decreed that Mennonites were to be expelled, but should be allowed to remain until they had har¬ vested their crops. The expulsion was never implemented. By 1612 some sixteen families had settled within the city walls. Outside the city to the west, Mennon¬ ites were permitted to settle in the lowlands around Elbing. Marshlands and other areas described as “unusable” were leased to the new settlers, and in the 1560s, the Ellerwald, a brush, forest and swamp lowland west of the city was made available for settlement. SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA Parcels of land were distributed by lot.' 3 Using the skills they had brought with them, the Mennonites began a systematic drainage program by building dikes, canals, drainage ditches and windmills. Lands leased to Mennonites were held in accordance with local emphyteutic tenure. This involved longterm leases, with specified rents to be paid annually. Terms of the lease typically were designed to pro¬ vide incentives for development of the land. Agreements were usually for several decades and could be inherited or sold. General supervision over the Ellerwald and the villages established there was exercised by prominent citizens chosen by the Elbing City Council. When the formal distribution of land in the Ellerwald occurred on February 10, 1565, the city established regulations for the newcomers. These village regulations, known as the “Dorfsordnung,” were later modified to permit Mennonites to partici¬ pate in revision or adoption of the regula¬ tions. The last version of the “Dorf¬ sordnung” appeared in 1754. Soon there¬ after the absorption of Elbing and the Eller¬ wald into the Prussian state created a different relationship between settlers in the area and the city of Elbing. The regulations issued for the Eller¬ wald settlers reflected the realities of the time. Settlers were urged to be devout members of their church. Physical labor was forbidden during the time of church services. Similarly, during this time no beer or brandy was to be sold. Other “blue laws” stipulated that dancing, card playing and gaming were prohibited on Sundays, while flashy clothing was forbidden by city regu¬ lations. Education was taken seriously, and parents were instructed to send their chil¬ dren to school regularly. Local government was left largely in the hands of the settlers. The area was divided into five administrative units, with each one headed by a “Schulze.” Each of these chief administrators was assisted by a “Ratmann.” Both the “Schulze” and the “Ratmann” were elected for a period of three years. The “Schulze” was charged with general super¬ vision of the community’s well-being, such as maintenance of dikes, canals, bridges, locks and roads. The actual work was done by the settlers. The system worked so well that it has been described as having no equal in the whole Vistula-Nogat Delta. 14 The condition of the land often deter¬ mined the terms of the lease. In 1586 Men¬ nonites were given especially favorable terms in exchange for building dikes and draining a swampland at Kerbswalde and Aschbuden. For two years the farmers were given free use of the land, although in later years the cost of the lease was substantially increased. Most of the drained land was set- A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS tied by Mennonites. Another nearby village was founded on pastureland at Blumenort. A 29-year lease gave the settlers the neces¬ sary incentive to improve their holdings. Adjacent land was also leased, and here the village of Rosenort was established. Gradu¬ ally, the marshy lowlands became increas¬ ingly profitable farms. Continued drainage programs permit¬ ted Mennonites to help develop land so that new settlements, Nogatau (1602) and Kerb- shorst (1636), came into being. By the mid¬ dle of the 17th century, other villages that had been founded on reclaimed land in¬ cluded Bollwerk, Keitlau, Schlammsack and Schwarzdamm. Another low-lying region near Elbing, the “Einlage,” bordered the Nogat and was usable only as pasture because of regular flooding, but it provided further opportu¬ nity for Mennonite settlement. In 1640, the city council, hoping to increase the city’s in¬ come, made part of the Einlage available to the brothers Abraham and Jacob Wiebe, for an initial period of fifteen years. More set¬ tlers came, and soon the region took on the appearance of an island, surrounded by dikes, canals and rivers. A century later, two-thirds of the farmers in the area were Mennonites, and passing decades did not significantly alter this situation. Other settlement occurred in this area on lands that had once been cultivated by the Teutonic Knights, but had become des¬ olate when the Order was defeated in the 15th century. Klein Mausdorf and Krebs- felde were restored to productivity with the coming of Mennonite settlers. Part of the Drausen (Druzno) Lake bottom, just south of Elbing, was also reclaimed in Dutch polder fashion. Other marshy lands nearby were also brought under cultivation, as were villages once devastated by war. Soon the region south of Elbing and east of the Nogat, the “little island” (Kleines Werder) was dotted with villages built or expanded by Mennonites, Schonwiese, Thorichthof (Szaleniec). Preussisch Rosengart (Roz- gart), Thiensdorf (Jezioro), Rosenort (Ju- randowo), Markushof (Markusy), Thiergart (Zwierzno) and others. Increasingly, Men¬ nonites were coming to be recognized as desirable and successful farmers. In 1676 when the voivode [military commander] of Pommerelia urged the Polish Parliament to expel Mennonites as dangerous heretics, they were staunchly defended by Polish ad¬ ministrators from MarienburgA Late in the 17th century, the Elbing City Council decided to increase the income from some of its other lands by allowing some wooded or marshy areas to be devel¬ oped for farming, especially grazing of cat¬ tle. Some 30 farms, with strong Mennonite participation, were begun near the village SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA Jungfer. As the settlement expanded, new villages, such as Walldorf, Lakendorf, Fiirst- enauerweide and others came into being. In some villages, such as Walldorf, Mennon- ites farmed four-fifths of the land; in other villages, the amount varied, but was always substantial. When Elbing and its lands were incor¬ porated into Prussia in the first Polish par¬ tition of 1772, Mennonites constituted a prosperous element in the larger commu¬ nity. Some 329 families lived on Elbing land at that time and constituted about 29 per¬ cent of the total. Mennonite Churches in and Near Elbing In 1590, the first Mennonite church in Elbing was built as the first Mennonite church structure anywhere in the Vistula- Nogat Delta. This building served the con¬ gregation until 1900, when it was replaced by a new church built on the west side of the Elbing River, on what was then known as Berliner Strasse. This church still stands and serves a Polish Catholic parish. It is situated on Ulica (street) Warszawska at Ulica Orla. In 1783, the Elbing congregation built an¬ other church, this time in the heart of Men¬ nonite farmlands, in Ellerwald, only a few kilometers west of Elbing. The two churches functioned as one congregation, sharing elders and ministers. Both churches remained active until the end of World War II. In the middle of the 19th century, an¬ other congregation was formed in the city. Disagreement over the necessity of having professionally trained ministers helped to induce some members of the Elbing-Eller- wald congregation to form a new group. They invited Carl Harder, who had just completed a theological program at the University of Halle, to provide pastoral leadership. In 1852, this group was able to dedicate a new church building. It contin¬ ued to function as a church until the closing days of World War II, when it was de¬ stroyed. A Century of Transition For Mennonites in Elbing and vicinity, as for other Mennonites under Prussian rule, the 19th century produced strains upon traditional practices and values. Intel¬ lectual and cultural trends sometimes cre¬ ated tensions between Mennonite congregations in the city and the more con¬ servative rural elements. In addition, the Prussian government’s restrictions on fur¬ ther acquisition of land by Mennonites mo¬ tivated a good number to emigrate to Russia late in the 18th and during the first half of the 19th centuries. An especially acute problem arose when exemption from military service was A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS ended. Some church leaders were prepared to accept the new conditions; others, such as Elder Andreas of the Elbing-Ellerwald congregation, insisted that those who ac¬ cepted military service could not receive communion. Most of his parishioners re¬ fused to support this stance, and so he, to¬ gether with some of his members, emigrated to the United States in 1870. Mennonites in Elbing had a long his¬ tory of being involved in the usually pros¬ perous commercial life of the city. Some of them were merchants, owners of iron works, shipbuilders, brewers, educators and other professionals. It is not surprising that congregations in the nearby countryside sometimes looked askance at what they re¬ garded as a too accommodating attitude in the city. Further acculturation occurred as increasing numbers of Mennonites studied at the highly-regarded Gymnasium in El¬ bing. Following World War I, Elbing, unlike Danzig and the Marienburg Werder, re¬ mained a part of Germany, and was thus spared some of the political and economic uncertainty that became evident in the Danzig Free State. The city, however, suf¬ fered almost total destruction in the latter stages of World War II. Today, many new buildings, some rebuilt in the earlier archi¬ tectural style, welcome the visitor. The Large Marienburg Werder (Zutawy) Draining the Marshlands Today’s visitor to the lowlands that lie in the huge triangle formed by the Vistula, Nogat and the Gulf of Gdansk is at once im¬ pressed by the flat, green meadows, the large herds of cattle and the productive Fields of grain that cover the rich, fertile soil. Villages, still largely agricultural, dot the countryside, while an extensive network of canals, ditches and dikes suggests that this land has been reclaimed from the sea. Throughout most of modern times, this area has been known as the “Large Marienburg Werder,” from a term meaning island. Land immediately to the east, on the right side of the Nogat, was called the “little Marienburg Werder,” and extended from Marienburg (now Malbork) to Lake Drausen (now Lake Druzno). Attempts to dam the rivers and drain the lands began in earnest when the Teu¬ tonic Knights gained control of this region in the 13th century. On the right bank of the Nogat they built the mighty castle, the Marienburg, that dominated the country¬ side. Gradually a town grew up around the castle, and for centuries Marienburg served as the administrative center of an area that included most of the large Werder as well as lands south and east of the city. In the Thirteen Years War (1453-1466), Marienburg and the Werder passed under SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA the control of the Polish crown. During the war, however, much of the land had been devastated. The situation was made even worse when, in a futile effort to regain con¬ trol of the region, Grand Master Albert in 1519 led the Knights into a war with Sigis- mund I. The Werder was pillaged and many of the villages left desolate. Finally, in 1523 an “eternal peace” was proclaimed, but the area lay in ruins. Further devastation oc¬ curred in 1526 when high water broke through the dike at Schoneberg. The eco¬ nomic distress of the region is indicated by the fact that it took five years to repair the dike. Many of the inhabitants decided to seek their fortunes elsewhere. For the next several decades the Polish king tried to find methods whereby his newly acquired lands might be made more profitable. He appointed his personal rep¬ resentative, or “starosta,” to be administra¬ tor of the Marienburg Werder. Marienburg served as the seat of local government, and from then until the first partition of Poland in 1772, the proud city on the Nogat was the center of local royal authority. The Werder was indeed an island, bounded by the two major rivers, the Vis¬ tula and the Nogat on the west, south and east, while in the north, the Elbing Vistula (later known as the Szkarpawa), together with the lagoon, the Frisches Haff, com¬ pleted the encirclement by water. Territory to the north of the Elbing Vistula, also in the delta, had been given to Danzig in re¬ turn for that city’s support of the king against the Knights, and was thus outside the jurisdiction of Marienburg. The whole area formed part of Royal Prussia (later called West Prussia). Adjacent territory to the east, known as Ducal Prussia (also East Prussia) remained under the rule of the Duke of Prussia. Lands in the Large Marienburg Werder were subject to a variety of jurisdictions. Some of the area formed part of the crown lands, and was thus directly under the su¬ pervision of the king’s representative. Other areas were owned by cities, the church or various landlords, and thus only indirectly subject to the Polish crown. For the Werder, the 16th century was the time of recovery and development. In the middle of the century, King Sigismund 11 Augustus leased a number of desolate vil¬ lages to the Loitz brothers—Simon, Hans and Stephen—who invited Dutch settlers, the Mennonites, to restore the lands to pro¬ ductivity. Soon villages such as Ladekopp (Lubieszewo), Orloff (Ortowo), Tiege (Tuja), Reimerswalde (Lesnowo), Tiegen- hagen (Cyganek) and Petershagen (Zeli- chowo) were restored to at least a measure of prosperity'. Dikes were rebuilt, lands drained, crops and cattle raised again.' 6 In the 1570s, another prominent land- A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA lord in the region, Ernst von Weiher, invited Mennonites to settle along the Tiege (Tuga) River, near his castle. One of the new settle¬ ments came to be known as Weihershof; later it took the name Tiegenhof (now Nowy Dwor). Some of the land in the area was at or below sea level and thus required extensive drainage. Nonetheless, numerous villages arose along the Tiege and nearby, among them Tiegerweide, Pletzendorf, Al- tendorf Stobbendorf (Stobiec) and others. I n most cases, the new settlers were allowed to acquire their lands in long-term tenure. It should also be noted that villages were often developed through the joint efforts of Mennonites and other settlers. Relative re¬ ligious toleration allowed persons of differ¬ ent faiths to live peacefully together in the various villages of the werder. In other parts of the Large Werder, such as the region just across the Nogat, north¬ west of Marienburg, the village of Heubu- den (Stogi) became the center of one of the largest Mennonite congregations in the en¬ tire werder. Farther north much of the swampy land along the Linau (Linawa) River was also settled by Mennonites. In another part of the Large Werder, the “tenuta Barwald,” a region held by Rein¬ hold Krokau in leasehold from the king, provided another opportunity for new set¬ tlement. This land, with its villages of Fiirstenwerder (Zulawki), Barwalde (Nied- zwiedzica) and Neumunsterberg (Nowa Koscielnica), had also been devastated by the wars and floods, and so in the 1560s Krokau invited Netherlanders to restore his holdings to productivity. All three villages became important Mennonite centers. New villages, such as Vierzehnhuben (Zad- worze), were also established. By the early part of the 17th century, most of the Large Werder had been re¬ stored or settled anew. The reclamation had been so successful that a French traveler, Charles Ogier, described the region as a “fertile garden.’’ 17 Although dike breaks con¬ tinued to threaten the development of parts of the werder, and over the years often pro¬ duced great hardships for the settlers, they were always rebuilt and the land reclaimed. For the coming centuries, the Large Werder remained a major source of farm goods. Built upon the rich soil, the farm economy brought prosperity and economic stability to the region. Local Administration in the Large Werder When the new settlers came, they were almost always given their land in long-term leases, usually valid for 30 to 40 years. On other occasions, they might acquire actual ownership under terms of the Kulm Code, an adaptation of the juridical system ema¬ nating from Magdeburg and serving as the A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS usual legal basis for defining relationships between settlers and local government. The system had been introduced by the Teu¬ tonic Knights and remained in force when the Knights were defeated. Much of the land around Marienburg formed part of the Polish crown lands, but the king permitted new settlements to be founded and governed in accordance with the old code of laws established by the Knights. As the area was drained and as ad¬ ditional settlements came into being, a sys¬ tem of local administration arose that expressed the special circumstances of a so¬ ciety whose economic well-being was shaped by dikes and drainage patterns. The royal representative (Vogt or Starosta) presided over the administration of justice, while local economic policies were largely determined and executed by local officials. Some of the most prominent officials were charged with responsibility to protect the dikes (Deichgeschworene).' 8 Their titles re¬ flected the crucial role played by the dikes. At the local community level, each village had its own Schulze, or administrator. Early documents kept by some of the settlers reflect conditions as communities sprang up on both sides of the Nogat River. A contemporary account, later incorpo¬ rated into the chronicle of the Orlofferfelde Mennonite Church, describes the begin¬ ning of the settlement: Tiegenhof and its environs, be¬ fore being settled by Mennonites, was largely a swampy, unusable area, covered with reeds and bushes. It had been leased from the Polish king by the brothers Hans, Simon and Stephen Loitz. These men hoped to improve their unus¬ able land . ... In 1562 Simon and Stephen Loitz, together with the latter’s wife, Esther ofBaasen, in¬ vited Mennonites from Holland and elsewhere. These made the larger and smaller islands [Werder] arable by building dams at the Haff, Lake Drausen, and downstream along the Vistula and the Nogat, as well as along the Tiege. They con¬ structed watermills and dug drainage ditches, and thus made the swampy, unusable lowlands arable. In 1578 Hans Loitz the younger gained the Tiegenhof prop¬ erty by inheritance . ... He now rented the reclaimed land for inter¬ est for thirty years to the invited Mennonites. Annually they paid 52 guilders and 13 chickens for each farmyard ... .‘ 9 The chronicle goes on to recount how later owners of the land continued to rent it to the Mennonites for periods of 20 to 40 SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA years. Moreover, Mennonites were ex¬ empted from duties such as quartering troops and performing “Scharwerk,” or corvee, the unpaid labor services often per¬ formed for landowners by tenants or serfs. The long-term tenancies were approved by successive Polish kings, beginning with Sigismund Augustus (1548-1572) and con¬ cluding with Stanislaw Poniatowski (1764- 1795)- Mennonite villages in the lowlands had gained a reputation for their productivity, efficiency and distinctive patterns. Long¬ term leases, designs of farm buildings, legal responsibilities, government structures— these all formed part of the image of the communities commonly referred to as “Hollandereien” (in German) or“ol^dry\" (in Polish). The term came to denote this spe¬ cific type of farming population and was later applied to communities that con¬ formed to this pattern, even if the inhabi¬ tants were not Netherlanders. The Lowlands in Transition The first partition of Poland in 1772 brought the delta under the Prussian crown. The next century proved to be a time of cultural accommodation and religious tension as the designs of the Prussian state came into conflict with traditional values of the Mennonites. Sometimes, conflicting views could not be reconciled and stimu¬ lated emigration; usually, cultural accom¬ modation carried the day. Prussian seizure of this area coincided with Mennonite linguistic transition from Dutch to German. A confession of faith, published in Dutch in 1730, appeared in German in 1768. Despite changes in lan¬ guage, Mennonites in Prussia maintained strong ties with Holland. Mennonites felt their way of life threat¬ ened when Prussian authorities began to restrict further acquisition of lands by Men¬ nonites. Military obligations were tied to land; because Mennonites were exempt from military service, the Prussian king re¬ solved to prevent any further erosion of sup¬ port for his army. Mennonites responded to House-barn built and used by a Mennonite family until the end of World War 11. The nearby Orloffer- felde cemetery still has a number of gravestones, including some of the prominent Donner family. 29 A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS the new policy by seeking land elsewhere. Many decided to accept an invitation from Tsarina Catherine II to settle on newly-ac¬ quired lands in South Russia. In July 1788 a large farewell celebration was held at the church in Rosenortas 152 families (919 per¬ sons) initiated the emigration to Russia. A momentous new chapter in Mennonite his¬ tory had begun. For the next several decades hundreds of Mennonites from var¬ ious parts of Prussia, but overwhelmingly from the delta, joined the exodus. Another major challenge faced the Mennonites when exemption from military service was ended in 1867. Some Mennon¬ ites refused to accept this change and once again suggested emigration. Gerhard Pen- ner, elder of the large Heubuden congrega¬ tion, rejected the government demands, and led several hundred people to settle in the United States, while the elder of the Ladekopp congregation moved to Russia. In some churches, the issue of military service led to division or to removal of ministers from their offices. The new policy, however, also meant that restrictions on land acqui¬ sition were now removed, and gradually most Mennonites came to accept military service as an appropriate obligation of citi¬ zens. Centuries of pacifism ended as the powerful forces of Prussian nationalism and militarism, embodied in a dynamic culture, changed the character of Mennonite belief in this area. The Dutch Mennonites were being Prussianized. Later developments in Prussia, and in the larger German state, strengthened this historic change. By the end of the 19th cen¬ tury, most Mennonites in Prussian lands identified with most aspects of the domi¬ nant culture. Reminders of a Legacy Although the Dutch settlers in the Vis- tula-Nogat Delta long retained many of their cultural characteristics, gradually the centuries of living in a predominantly Ger¬ man society produced a large measure of as¬ similation. Nonetheless, the Mennonites retained their religious identity, and a num¬ ber of congregations and church buildings formed part of the landscape. Today, the congregations of the Large Werder are no more, for they were dis¬ persed by the ravages of World War II. Some of the church buildings still stand and are in use today. The former Mennonite Church in Pr. Rosengart (Rozgart) serves the local Roman Catholic parish. The adja¬ cent cemetery is desolate and overgrown with bushes and weeds. Just a few miles to the east, the former church building of the Mennonites in Thiensdorf (Jezioro), despite its fine red brick structure, is used as a stor¬ age building. In the Large Werder, today known as A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS 32 Almost all windmills that once dotted the landscape in the Vistula-Nogat Delta have disappeared. This one, situated in Wikrowo (Wickerau) immediately south of the Ellerwald area, was used for milling. Fire destroyed this landmark in 2002 . Zutawy, no former Mennonite church building still serves its original purpose. In Barwalde (Niedzwiedzica), the log struc¬ ture built for a church in 1768 was used by the local collective farm as a storage shed until it was destroyed by fire in 1990. Al¬ though the former cemetery is largely gone, a number of gravestones have been set up neatly in the former churchyard. Also, the foundation of the former church provides a border fora neat lawn. Local residents wel¬ come visitors to this historic site. Nearby, the local Roman Catholic parish has con¬ structed a church. In Heubuden (Stogi), the Mennonite congregation constructed a large church in 1768; it is gone, but the ad¬ jacent cemetery still has many headstones with legible inscriptions. The impressive wrought iron gate to the cemetery has been restored. Former Mennonite church buildings in Ladekopp (Lubieszewo), Orlofferfelde (Or- lowskie Pole), Rosenort (Rozewo—not to be confused with another Rosenort), and Tlegenhagen (Cyganek ) no longer exist. Similarly, the former Mennonite chapel at Neunhuben (Dziewi^c Wlok) is gone. A the same time, local Poles, as well as visitors from United States, Canada, Germany and the Netherlands, have worked together to restore numerous cemeteries and to keep them presentable. Funds have been gath¬ ered to support and expand the museum in Nowy Dwor, especially aspects of the Men¬ nonite story. Also, a historical park in Cy¬ ganek (near the former Tiegenhagen), still in construction, has a house built in the style of earlier Mennonite homes; in addi¬ tion, gravestones from various overgrown and neglected Mennonite cemeteries, as well as historic artifacts, have been gathered here. Many of the villages that dot Zulawy, however, still have houses built by Mennon¬ ite settlers. A good number of the distinc¬ tive arcaded houses, many of them under government protection as historical build¬ ings, can be seen throughout the lowlands. In many instances, carefully-carved capitals on wooden columns reflect the care and SETTLEMENTS IN THE VISTULA-NOGAT DELTA artistry that shaped regional architectural design. Also, the name of the “Baumeister,” the building master, is often carved on the lintel above the door. Much of the Zulawy must be drained regularly to remain productive. The exten¬ sive drainage system, built over the cen¬ turies, still serves its original purpose. Also, many good roads have been constructed since World War II and allow the visitor to reach destinations quickly. Many of the smaller villages can still be reached by trav¬ eling along the traditional cobblestone roads, picturesquely lined by trees. For centuries, Marienburg (Malbork) served as an important administrative cen¬ ter for the area. When this region was seized by Prussia in 1772, Mennonite leaders went to persuade Frederick II to grant them their traditional privileges and rights. Gradually a Mennonite congregation arose in and around the city, and in 1906, this group, to¬ gether with the large Heubuden congrega¬ tion constructed a church building here. Following World War II the structure was used as a cinema, then removed to make room for new city projects. Today, Malbork and its adjacent low¬ lands still constitute one of the most pro¬ ductive agricultural areas of Poland. The network of canals, dikes and ditches; the carefully-planned, tree-lined roads; the ar¬ caded houses and the remaining church structures are reminders of an era of pros¬ perity and rural tranquility. Some of the old farming traditions still survive. At the same time, demographic change and modern technology have given rise to a new order. Arcaded houses still form part of the landscape in many villages in the delta. A plate on the house indicates that the building is under protection as a historical structure. 33 Ill SETTLEMENTS ALONG THE VISTULA Soon after Netherlanders had begun their economically successful settlement in the Vistula-Nogat Delta, they were invited to continue land reclamation and develop¬ ment to the south, up the Vistula. Low-lying areas around Mewe (Gniew), Marienwerder (Kwidzyn), Neuenburg (Nowe), Graudenz (Grudzi^dz), Schwetz (Swiecie) and Kulm (Chelmno) attracted settlers when local rulers decided that nonconformists could be tolerated. Even earlier, some Anabaptists from South Germany and Moravia had come to Przechowka near Schwetz and to some lowlands on the other side of the Vis¬ tula, where villages such as Schonsee were founded. The precise date of these begin¬ nings cannot be ascertained; it appears to have been in the 1540s. Soon other settlers came from the delta. Contemporary local government documents refer to both kinds of settlers as “Hollanders,” thus indicating that the type of villages established here were those of persons who had brought skills in draining marshes and in developing certain agricultural patterns. The new settlers wrested their land from the river and soon established a thriv¬ ing cattle and dairy economy. In addition, they were permitted to carry on many of their traditional crafts, despite objections from guilds in the larger towns/ 0 Near Marienwerder (Kwidzyn) Although the region of the Marien¬ werder lowlands constitutes a geographic unity, it was divided into three parts by the Peace of Thorn. The southern extremity formed part of the kingdom of Poland. The Teutonic Order retained the middle sec¬ tion, while the northern part also became part of the kingdom of Poland. Shortly after the secularization of the territories of the Order and adoption of Lutheranism in ducal Prussia, Duke Albert served notice that he would not permit “heretics\" to live in his lands. Mennonites soon discovered that if they wished to reside along the Vis¬ tula, it would have to be in territories sub¬ ject to the crown of Poland. In the northern parts of the Marien¬ werder lowlands, villages settled largely or entirely by Mennonites included commu- A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS nities such as Schulwiese, Kiiche, Trag- heimerweide and Montauerweide. Later, following a period of some toleration in Ducal Prussia, Mennonites were again ex¬ pelled from that duchy in 1724 and came to villages in the Marienwerder area. By now, Prussia had become a kingdom, and the new ruler was actively recruiting tall men for his armies. Villages such as Zwanziger- weide, Schweingrube, Gross and Klein- schardau, and Rudnerweide became the new homes of the dispossessed from Prus¬ sia. The emigrants were determined not to be inducted into the king’s “Potsdam Riesengarde.\" 2 ' As Mennonite settlers continued to come to the northern part of the Marien¬ werder lowlands, swamps and bushland were brought under cultivation as the new¬ comers applied their techniques and skills. Land was leased for periods of thirty or forty years, so that settlers were assured a meas¬ ure of security. In addition, in 1728 the Bishop of Kulm, Felix Ignatius Kretkowski, granted the Mennonites permission to build a church. 22 Near Montau (Mqtawy) Economic expectations were clearly a major factor in persuading local officials to invite these Hollanders to come to this area. Reports issued by some officials state that they were confident that if this area could be farmed by methods similar to those used in the delta, the income for the royal coffers would be more than doubled. Thus, in one of the earlier settlements along the Vistula, royal lands in the vicinity of Montau (Mqtawy) were made available to Nether- landers, and a substantial community arose here along the west bank. In 1569 King Sigismund Augustus confirmed a lease agreement whereby the Mennonites were granted exemption from various services on condition that they would make a money payment of 1400 marks. The first such agreement, drawn up for a period of twelve years, included a group of 18 Hollanders. At the expiration of the agreement, it was extended for another 18 years. Polish authorities, who owned the land, were well-pleased with the arrange¬ ment, for the contract explained that previ¬ ously “the land and village Montau was desolate, and brought little or no profit”; now the land through the “industry, care and hard work” of the settlers, had become productive. 25 The introduction of successful farming methods also permitted local land¬ lords to increase rents substantially. In ad¬ dition, Mennonite settlers were permitted to sell their goods along the Vistula. Settlers in the Montau area enjoyed a large measure of religious liberty. As early as 1586 they had their own church building in Montau. 24 Lease agreements tended to be written SETTLEMENTS ALONG THE VISTULA for several decades and might involve pay¬ ments in kind or money, as well as a variety of services. A declaration made by a landowner in Montau in 1636 is illustrative. The lessor, Teresa of Konarzyny, stated that she had leased her Montau land “for fifty years to the Hollanders.” They agreed to pay her 1600 Polish zlotys annually, together with ten hams. The settlers were granted their “freedoms,” exemptions from the corvee, the right to sell their crops “every¬ where,” as well as some other rights. The agreement stipulated that the entire com¬ munity must meet its obligations as a unit. Payments were to be made “all for everyone, and everyone for all.” 25 Soon more villages appeared along the Vistula. Some of those founded near Mon¬ tau in the 16th or early 17th centuries in¬ cluded Dragass ( 1592 ) (Dragacz), Gross Lubin (1583) (Wielki Lubien). Klein Lubin (1593) (Maly Lubien), Kamerau (ca. 1570- 80) (Kamirowo), and Gruppe (1604) (Grupa). These newly established villages soon developed programs of mutual sup¬ port and, in so doing, laid the basis for a number of cooperative ventures. In 1605, 21 representatives from eight villages in the Gruppe-Montau area agreed to implement proposals to clean out and maintain the lit¬ tle Montau stream. Most of the participants were Mennonites, who took a leading role in introducing systematic flood control to the Montau on the left bank of the Vistula. 26 During the two Swedish wars, this area suffered severe hardship and devastation. Many of the homes were plundered, so that inhabitants were unable to pay for their use of the lands. Resulting disputes between landlord and tenant led King John Casimir to appoint a commission to resolve the issue. Joint efforts by the tenants allowed them to make an adequate money payment and thus retain their rights and freedoms. Similar problems were forcing Polish farm¬ ers into serfdom; Mennonites had found a solution in mutual aid. 27 Economic problems continued to plague the settlements in Montau and its vicinity. During the 1660s and 1670s, the Vistula on several occasions broke through the dikes and brought destruction to several of the villages. In 1677 King John Sobieski freed the settlements from some of their obligations so that they might have a better opportunity to recover. Soon, additional problems arose as the Northern War (1700- 1721) brought devastation and depopulation as Swedish, Russian, Saxon and Polish troops marched through the area. Nonethe¬ less, the times of trouble were followed by times of recover)' and growth, so that the settlements continued to develop. Conditions in Montau tended to be re¬ flected in other nearby villages. In the latter part of the 16th century Mennonites estab- A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS SETTLEMENTS ALONG THE VISTULA lished the village of Klein Sanskau on land granted them in long-term tenure. In 1592 this lease was extended for forty years for an annual rent of 350 guilders. The arrange¬ ment must have proved mutually satisfac¬ tory, for it was continued throughout the 17th and 18th centuries until the area was taken by Prussia in the first partition of Poland. The last tenancy agreement, signed by Countess Theofila Potocka in 1732, called for a lease of 30 years with an annual pay¬ ment of 450 guilders and six hams. 18 Just a few kilometers south of Sanskau was the older village, Gross Sanskau, where Mennonites also settled, although they formed only part of the larger community. Here, too, land was held in long-term leases, with annual money and in-kind pay¬ ments to the landlord. Mennonites also settled in the nearby villages of Gross Lubin and Dragass, al¬ though the precise date of settlement is not known. In 1583 Bishop Rozrazewski issued a visitation report in which he complained of Hollanders living in Lubin. 19 The local administrator, the castellan Jan Zborowski (in office from 1581 until his death in 1603), noting that Gross Lubin and neighboring lands were “totally flooded and unproduc¬ tive, made desolate and ruined in the war,” decided to lease the land to Hollanders. The terms called for a rent of 1087 guilders for a period of 50 years. Sigismund III granted inhabitants of Dragass, Gross and Klein Lubin, as well as several other nearby vil¬ lages the right of shipping and selling their goods along the Vistula. 30 Clearly, officials were pleased with the results of their colo¬ nization policies, for in 1640, the local stew¬ ard extended the lease for another 50 years. Evidently the king shared this generally positive attitude toward the settlers, for in the middle of the 17th century John Casimir issued a proclamation declaring that “Hol¬ landers” in the “Graudenz staraster” were no longer to be subjected to the quartering of troops and the imposition of special taxes by local authorities. 31 Several other villages in this area emerged in the 16th century as places where Mennonite farmers were welcome. Brat- twin, Deutsch Westfalen (Male Stwolno), and some other settlements were leased to Hollanders, although the extent to which these comprised Mennonites is uncertain. In 1593 King Sigismund III approved the settlement of farmers in this area. Half a century later, the local royal administrator, Jan Zawadzki, extended the lease; once again, royal approval followed. 31 Mennonite villages continued to de¬ velop in this region throughout the period of Polish rule. Thus, in 1745 seven Mennon¬ ite families bought and settled Neunhuben. Later King Stanislaw Augustus ratified the acquisition. Repeatedly, Polish kings and A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS their officials demonstrated a readiness to permit Mennonite settlement on crown lands. The Polish monarchy indeed estab¬ lished Poland as a haven for the oppressed and homeless. In addition to their settlements on crown lands, Mennonites also established villages on lands belonging to the nobility and the Catholic Church. In Gruppe, “swampy land”” owned by the nobleman, Felix Konarski, was leased to Mennonites for 50 years (1604-1654). The new settlers were permitted to cut wood, fish in the lord’s streams, and sell their products along the Vistula. They were also granted local civil administrative authority, as well as re¬ ligious toleration. In 1625 the voivode of Marienburg, Samuel Zalinski, who also owned land in Gruppe, leased “land and bush,” as the contemporary chronicler de¬ scribed the area, to Hollanders. Later, more land was leased specifically to Mennonites and other settlers. These new communities gradually emerged as Ober- and Nieder- gruppe. Most of the leased land here was held in tenure for periods of 40 to 50 years. Settlers agreed to fixed rents, as well as specified conditions, such as grinding grain only at the lord’s mill and buying beer only from the lord’s brewery. Soon after this area was taken by Prus¬ sia in 1772, the farmers found that their rent had been increased from 49 to 136 Taler. By this time, farms in Ober- and Niedergruppe were held almost exclusively by Mennon¬ ites. 34 Like many other communities, they found that the new regime was much less open to compromise and accommodation than the old one had been. Earlier, in the nearby village of Kom- morsk (Komorsk), the Bishop of Wloclawek granted “industrious Hollanders” 33 settle¬ ment privileges during the 17th century. By the 1720s, however, the local climate had changed. Some of the neighboring Poles charged that heretics, commonly called Hollanders, 36 had wrongly acquired land. In this instance, the bishop’s court declared that the Mennonites would have to leave, although they were to be compensated for the homes and canals they had constructed. A later agreement between the bishop and new settlers in the area stipulated that land was to be rented only to Catholics. In a sim¬ ilar vein, the bishop announced that in the village Schottland, where his predecessors had invited Mennonites to settle, he was re¬ placing all Mennonite public officials with Catholics. The winds of toleration did not always blow with even strength. In the Schwetz (Swiecie) Area Just south of Schwetz, in the lowlands on the left side of the Vistula, Mennonites from Groningen settled perhaps as early as 1540. Centered in the village Wintersdorf SETTLEMENTS ALONG THE VISTULA (Przechowka), they maintained close ties with Flemish congregations in Holland until well into the 18th century. Here, too, land was held in long-term tenure. Thus, a lease agreement issued by the administrator (starosta) in Schwetz, Jan Zawadzki, in 1642 specified terms for 50 years. The last such agreement was issued for Wintersdorf by the then starosta Johanna Jablonowski. Confirmed by King Augustus III in 1742, it indicated that terms had remained con¬ stant for a century. Mennonitesalso settled in neighboring villages such as Schonau (Przechowo), Glu- gowka, Christfelde (Chrystkowo) and Kos- sowo (Kosowo). Lease agreements, because they were made with various owners, tended to vary slightly, but generally in¬ cluded specified annual money payments, religious toleration, and local civil admin¬ istrative authority. In some cases, settlers re¬ ceived permission to establish and operate their own schools. Farm produce could be sold in Danzig and elsewhere, while linen weaving could be used to supplement other income. Early in the 18th century Mennonites in the Schwetz lowlands established a daugh¬ ter settlement in nearby Kleinsee (Jeziorka). The owner of the land Hedwig von Steffens- Wybczynski, determined to undo the ad¬ verse effects of war devastation, granted a 40-year lease to Mennonites who now pro¬ vided the agricultural skills necessary to transform the land into productive farms. Once again, Mennonites were granted reli¬ gious toleration, provided they would pay parish dues to the Catholic church. 37 In the Kulm (Chehnno) and Graudenz (Grudzi^dz) Lowlands In 1553 King Sigismund II permitted Hollanders to settle in the Kulm lowlands. 38 Soon thereafter, the first Mennonite com¬ munity in this area emerged at Schonsee (Sosnowka). This village now became the center of a substantial Mennonite settle¬ ment in this region. The local Catholic bishop, who had jurisdiction over the land and made it available to settlers, was pleased to see his marshes transformed into productive farms, and so he permitted reli¬ gious toleration. Skill in draining swamps, building dikes, raising cattle and producing good crops made the Mennonites welcome residents. By the early 17th century, villages such as Rossgarten (Rozgarty), Lunau (Lu- nawy), Ober and Niederausmaas (Dolne and Gorne Wymiary), Grenz (Granica) and Dorposch (Dorposz) provided homes for numerous Mennonites. Details of earliest arrangements be¬ tween the settlers and the landowner are difficult to determine, nonetheless, the sec¬ ond lease arranged between the city council of Kulm and the Mennonite settlers in A HOMELAND FOR STRANGERS Schonsee, dated September 26, 1565, pro¬ vides some insights into mutual obliga¬ tions The city retained ownership of the land and ultimate judicial authority, Lessees were required to market their pro¬ duce in Kulm; only if the city could not ab¬ sorb all of the goods could they be sold elsewhere. Competition with Kulm merchants was specifically forbidden; only local village needs could be supplied by the Mennonite craftsmen. Settlers were also permitted lim¬ ited other rights, such as fishing in local streams. Most importantly, Mennonites were granted the right to practice their reli¬ gion freely. Similar leases were signed in later years. 40 Sometimes, privileges were expanded. Thus, in 1670 local authorities permitted Mennonites to establish their own school. In addition, Mennonites developed their own local civil administration, with the un¬ derstanding that such developments must reflect city administration guidelines. Like Schonsee, the nearby village of Jamerau also had a number of Mennonite settlers in the 16th century. Lease agree¬ ments were similar to those made between Kulm and Schonsee, although in this case no reference was made to schools. Another nearby village, Gross Lunau (Wielkie Lu- nawy), also emerged as a Mennonite center at about this time. The local bishop, Lau- rentius Gembicki, permitted the city of Kulm to lease land to the Mennonites pro¬ vided that they would not build “strange churches” 4 ' or spread non-Catholic teach¬ ing. In a later lease agreement (1664), Men¬ nonites were permitted to build their own school and appoint their own teachers. In the early 17th century, the Mennon¬ ites near Kulm built a church at Schonsee. A century later, around 1725, they organized a fire insurance association that was des¬ tined to become a major public welfare in¬ stitution among Mennonites along the Vistula. Other villages in the area also came to be predominantly Mennonite. Together, these educational efforts, religious activities centered in the Schonsee church, and vari¬ ous mutual aid practices, especially in in¬ stances of property loss by fire or flooding, formed an important aspect of community life. Over the decades, and with the inten¬ sification of the Counter-Reformation, the leniency toward “heretics” sometimes came under fire. In the latter part of the 17th cen¬ tury, complaints that Mennonites paid no money for masses, or insistence that "
