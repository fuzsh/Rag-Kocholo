        "text": "Courts martial and executions\n\nAll the prisoners were put on trial in front of the martial court of the Wehrmacht's Gruppe Eberhardt. A first group of 28 Victoriaschule prisoners, with a single Wehrmacht officer as defence lawyer,[7] was tried on 8 September, a second group of 10, who recovered in the hospital, on 30 September. All were sentenced to death as illegal combatants under the German special military penal law of 1938. The sentence was demanded by the prosecutor Hans-Werner Giesecke and declared by presiding judge Kurt Bode[de], vice-president of the Oberlandesgericht Danzig (Higher Regional Court of Danzig).[8] Twenty-eight of the judgements were countersigned, and thus became legally valid, by General Hans Günther von Kluge, the further 10 by Colonel Eduard Wagner.[9] A clemency appeal was rejected by General Walther von Brauchitsch.[10]\n\nThe prisoners were mostly executed by firing squad led by SS-Sturmbannführer Max Pauly (later commandant of the Neuengamme concentration camp) on 5 October and buried in a mass grave at the cemetery of Danzig-Saspe (Zaspa).[4] One, Leon Fuz, was later recognized and murdered in the Stutthof concentration camp in November. Four defenders who managed to escape and hide survived the war. The families of the postmen were also persecuted. A similar fate awaited eleven Polish railway workers from Tczew south of the city, who were executed by the SA after they foiled a German attempt to use an armoured train in a sneak attack.[11]\n\nWagner, a conspirator in the 20 July plot later committed suicide on 23 July 1944, after the plan's failure. Kluge killed himself on 19 August 1944. Pauly was executed by the British for other crimes in 1946, and Brauchitsch died in British custody while awaiting trial for war crimes in 1948. However, Giesecke and Bode were never held responsible for this episode or held accountable for the executions. They were denazified after the war and continued their careers as lawyers in Germany. Both died of natural causes in the 1970s. Only in 1997–1998 did the German court at Lübeck (the Große Strafkammer IIb and the Dritte Große Strafkammer) invalidate the 1939 Nazi sentence, citing among the reasons that the special military penal law had only taken effect in Danzig on 16 November 1939 and charged the presiding judge with negligence of his duties.[12] The decision of the German court occurred thanks to the work of a German author, Dieter Schenk, who published a monograph on the defence of the post office and referred to the execution of the defenders as judicial murder (Justizmord).[13] Schenk stresses the commanding role of Danzig police forces, which made a Wehrmacht court martial not competent to convict the defenders. Instead, the Free City of Danzig's penal law would have been applicable, without the option of a death penalty.[8]\n\nCultural legacy\n\nIn Poland, the episode has become one of the better known episodes of the Polish September Campaign and it is usually portrayed as a heroic story of David and Goliath proportions. In this view, it was a group of postmen who held out against German SS troops for almost an entire day.\n\nThe Polish defence of the post office was also sympathetically portrayed in Chapter 18 of The Tin Drum (1959) by Günter Grass, 'The Defence of the Polish Post Office'. In the chapter, the protagonist Oskar Matzerath meets his presumptive father Jan Bronski as the latter heads home, trying to avoid fighting in the looming battle. Upon meeting Oskar, Jan returns to the post office, taking Oskar with him. Oskar is present during the siege, and portrays his presumptive father negatively to the SS, leading him to find himself guilty of Jan's execution. In the novel's penultimate chapter, Oskar and his friend Vittlar after the war encounter in Düsseldorf a survivor of the siege, Viktor Weluhn, whom two men were preparing to execute for his actions at the siege. Viktor and his executioners disappear into the night later in the chapter, with Viktor's fate left unknown.[14][15][16]\n\nIn 1979, the Defenders of the Polish Post Office Monument[pl] was unveiled in Gdańsk.[17] In 2012 the Polish rock/metal band Horytnica[pl] has written a song titled \"Obrońca Poczty w Gdańsku\" (\"Defender of the Post Office in Danzig\").[18] The defence of the post office is dramatised in the first episode of the 2019 British war drama series World on Fire.[19]"
