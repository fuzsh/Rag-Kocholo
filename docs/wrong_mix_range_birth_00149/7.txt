Early Life of Robin Williams

Chicago, Illinois, was the birthplace of Robin Williams on July 21st, 1951. A prominent family raised Williams. Lauren, his mother, was a former model from New Orleans, and Robert, his father, was a senior executive at Lincoln-Mercury Motors in charge of the Midwest division. Robin's family moved to the San Francisco Bay Area before he attended high school. When Robin was younger, he was very quiet. One of the few early predictions that he would become a comedian was his excellent version of his grandmother. Beyond that, he started opening up in earnest when he began performing in high school plays.

Education

Robin studied at the College of Marin in Kentfield after graduating from Redwood High School in Larkspur, California. He afterward studied at New York City's famous Julliard School. In this location, Robin would first meet his lifelong friend and future Super Man actor, Christopher Reeve. Robin was encouraged by a teacher at Julliard to switch his focus from stand-up comedy to acting. Williams started performing in New York's comedy clubs after considering that advice. His wild actions and quick one-liners rapidly won the hearts of the audience.

Career

In the 1970s, he started his career performing stand-up comedy. In late 1977, he had the first tv appearance of one of his stand-up acts. Despite the laugh-fail, sometimes it is evident that it assisted him in getting attention for his talent. When he played at the Comedy Club in Los Angeles in 1977, T.V. producer George Schlatter saw him and invited him to participate in a brand-new edition of his "Laugh-In" program.

In 1979, he gave a live comedy show at the Copacabana in New York called "Reality... What a Concept," for which he got a Grammy. A string of further roles quickly followed, and in 1984 he was cast as Vladimir Ivanoff in the comedy-drama "Moscow on the Hudson," for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. His role was loosely based on radio DJ Adrian Cronauer in the military comedy film "Good Morning, Vietnam" from 1987.

He appeared in the drama movie "Dead Poets Society" in 1989, which told the tale of an English teacher at a traditional school who inspires his pupils by teaching them poetry. The film was a big success. Mr. Doubtfire, a 1993 comedy in which he portrays a guy who dresses as a woman to be near the kids he shares with his ex-wife, is one of his most well-known comedies.

He appeared in films including "License to Wed" (2007), "One Hour Photo" (2002), "Robots" (2005), and "Old Dogs" as he continued to enjoy success in his career well into the new millennium (2009). He was granted the chance to act in the amazing movie "Good Will Hunting" in 1997, in which he plays the role of a therapist who offers advice to a disturbed but smart young man. For the movie, he won multiple awards.
