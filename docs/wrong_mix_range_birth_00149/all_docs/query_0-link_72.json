        "text": "Robin: The Ultimate Robin Williams Tribute Experience has appeared across the country at corporate events and in\n\nmany of the finest performing arts centers, casinos and comedy clubs.\n\nI had to do a double take when Roger Kabler first bounded on stage, since his physical resemblance to the late comedy legend Robin Williams goes far beyond his signature rainbow suspenders.\n\nKabler does a remarkable job recreating Williams' hysterical one-liners and irrepressible vocal explosions, although his frequent breathlessness proves that Williams' manic energy is inimitable without chemical assistance.\n\nDated cultural references to Tonya Harding and Buddy Hackett (along with some crudely misogynistic material that feels out of step with I remember of Williams' character) may make the show less accessible for younger audiences, but moments with beloved characters like Aladdin's Genie and Mrs. Doubtfire should reel them back in.\n\nWhat elevates this above a mere impression is the mid-show moment where Kabler drops the shtick to share how Willaims' life and death impacted him as a recovering addict; I was left wanting to learn more, which can be found in \"Being Robin\" in the documentary Kabler produced.\n\nThe structure does get a bit scattershot towards the end, with an overlong series of over acting celebrities, but the pacing recovers during a funny physical comedy finale.\n\nFor those old enough to remember the cocaine fueled - insanity of Robin Williams' early stand-up comedy specials - and all those to young to have personally witnessed his protean talents - Kablers' \"Ultimate Robin Williams' Tribute\" may be the next best thing to time - traveling back to the Met (circa 1986)."
