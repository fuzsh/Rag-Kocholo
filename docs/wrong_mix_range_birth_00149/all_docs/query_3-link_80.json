        "text": "Robin Williams, the former College of Marin student who rose to stardom as a comedian and Oscar-winning actor, was found dead Monday at his home in Tiburon.\n\nThe cause of death is pending, but the preliminary investigation suggests he died of suicide by asphyxiation, said sheriff”s Lt. Keith Boyd, assistant county coroner.\n\nWilliams had turned 63 on July 21.\n\nAn autopsy was planned for Tuesday.\n\nAuthorities received a 911 call at about 11:55 a.m. Monday from Williams” home in unincorporated Tiburon, where he was found unconscious, Boyd said. Williams lived there with his wife, Susan Schneider.\n\nSheriff”s deputies and Tiburon and Southern Marin firefighters responded, and Williams was pronounced dead at 12:02 p.m.\n\nWilliams was last seen alive at about 10 p.m. Sunday at his home.\n\nBoyd declined to release additional details as the investigation was continuing.\n\nWilliams, who had spoken publicly about his bouts with alcohol and cocaine abuse, had recently checked into a rehab to reinforce his sobriety, according to news reports. He also had a heart valve operation in 2009.\n\n“He has been battling severe depression of late,” Williams” publicist, Mara Buxbaum, told the Hollywood Reporter, a newspaper covering the entertainment industry. “This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time.”\n\nThe newspaper also published a statement from Williams” wife: “This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken. On behalf of Robin”s family, we are asking for privacy during our time of profound grief. As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin”s death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.”\n\nRobin McLaurin Williams was born in Chicago and spent part of his childhood in Michigan until the family moved to Marin. He graduated from Redwood High School in Larkspur in 1969 and attended College of Marin before launching his entertainment career.\n\nAfter achieving fame on the television comedy “Mork & Mindy,” he went on to star in dozens of movies. He was nominated for the Academy Award four times and won for his role in “Good Will Hunting” in 1997.\n\n“Winning the Oscar has a short half-life,” Williams told the Marin Independent Journal in a 1999 interview. “At first people say, ”Oh, you won an Academy Award.” Then it”s ”Didn”t you win an Academy Award? Do you know Matt Damon?””\n\nHis long film career also included “The World According to Garp” (1982), “Good Morning, Vietnam” (1987), “Mrs. Doubtfire” (1993), “Patch Adams” (1998) and “The Fisher King” (1991).\n\nIn addition to winning an Oscar, Williams won or was nominated for numerous awards in the United States and abroad, including the Golden Globe, the Grammy and the Emmy.\n\nWilliams was known for making appearances at local venues and community fundraisers in Marin.\n\n“The Marin Humane Society is very sad to hear about the passing of Robin Williams,” the organization said. “In 2009, we were honored when he gave a surprise performance at our Woofstock benefit concert. Our thoughts go out to his family at this time.”\n\nNews of Williams” death spread quickly Monday afternoon, leading to an outpouring of tributes on social media.\n\n“He gave so much to so many people,” comedian Ellen DeGeneres posted on Twitter. “I”m heartbroken.”\n\n“Robin Williams was like no other,” actor Henry Winkler said on Twitter. “To watch him create on the spot was a privilege to behold..Robin you are an angel now !!! REST IN PEACE.”\n\nPresident Obama also released a statement on Williams” death:\n\n“Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between. But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien — but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit. He made us laugh. He made us cry. He gave his immeasurable talent freely and generously to those who needed it most — from our troops stationed abroad to the marginalized on our own streets. The Obama family offers our condolences to Robin”s family, his friends, and everyone who found their voice and their verse thanks to Robin Williams.”\n\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, Williams” survivors include three adult children: Zachary, from his first marriage, to Valerie Velardi, and Zelda and Cody, from his second marriage, to Marsha Garces. He married Schneider in 2011."
