        "text": "Whether your favorite Robin Williams movie is “Good Will Hunting,” “Mrs. Doubtfire” or “Patch Adams,” be sure to watch it as soon as you can — as the longtime actor and comedian would have turned 69 today.\n\nOn Tuesday, fans of the late star, who died six years ago, shared their birthday wishes and fond memories on social media to celebrate his life.\n\n“I had the honor of meeting Robin Williams in Afghanistan,” US Army veteran David Weissman tweeted to his 167,400 followers. “He was [a] huge supporter of soldiers. #HappyBirthdayRobinWilliams.”\n\n“Robin Williams felt immortal in a way that’s hard to articulate, but we didn’t know that until we lost him,” writer Charlotte Clymer tweeted to her 315,500 followers. “And like many, for years afterward, I would forget he died and be shocked upon reminding. No other person’s death has felt that way to me.”\n\nBorn on July 21, 1951, in Chicago, Williams took his own life at his home north of San Francisco on Aug. 11, 2014 — not yet a month after turning 63. His sudden death sent shockwaves across the world, and without a suicide note, left many wondering what really went on.\n\nReports credited severe depression and Parkinson’s — but it turned out Williams had developed Lewy body dementia, a diagnosis made only in his autopsy. The second-most-common progressive dementia, after Alzheimer’s, the incurable brain disease starts with memory problems and worsens with personality changes, psychiatric symptoms — including psychosis — and death.\n\nThat led some fans to tweet the Williams quote, “Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.”\n\nWilliams, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1998 for “Good Will Hunting,” also had Golden Globes and Emmy awards under his belt. He totaled 65 wins and 85 nominations, which also included Grammy, Kids’ Choice and Peabody awards.\n\nBeyond memories and achievements, people also tweeted about Williams’ sense of style — including a photo of him wearing a flame-print shirt with shoes to match.\n\nBut one user, named Randy Bish, made it more personal.\n\n“Today, Robin Williams and I share a birthday,” he tweeted. “The world could sure use his humor today.”"
