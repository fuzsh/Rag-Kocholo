        "text": "DETROIT, MI -- Actor-comedian Robin Williams, who spent some of his childhood in Metro Detroit, was reportedly found dead Monday in his home in Northern California of apparent suicide.\n\nSeveral news outlets including CNN, Reuters, The Los Angeles Times, The Huffington Post and The Hollywood Reporter reported the news and confirmed the death with the Marin County (Calif.) Sheriff's Office.\n\nReuters says the sheriff's coroner's division said it suspects the death was a suicide due to asphyxia, but the cause of death is still under investigation.\n\nThe 63-year-old Williams was born in Chicago, but told the Chicago Tribune in an 1988 interview that he moved to Metro Detroit when he was \"5 or 6.\"\n\nHe was a student at Detroit Country Day School and lived for a while with his family in Bloomfield Hills.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported in an 1988 profile of Williams that he was \"tightly wrapped\" after being sent to the private school.\n\nAn excerpt from the profile written by Gene Siskel:\n\n\"It was only before his senior year in 1968, when his family moved to trendy Marin County, Calif., that young Robin began to unwind with the much looser California crowd. The good vibrations from the summer of love in San Francisco were still around.\"\n\nWilliams' father, Robert Fitzgerald Williams, was a senior executive at Ford Motor Company in charge of its Midwest region.\n\nDespite spending most of his later years in California, Williams' childhood in Metro Detroit appeared to have a strong impact on him.\n\nPeople Magazine reported in 1991 that William's 1989 performance as a passionate, iconoclastic teacher in \"Dead Poet's Society\" was largely based on John Campbell, a teacher he had a Detroit Country Day.\n\nTwitter was flooded Monday night with reaction to Williams' death. A look at reaction from Twitter users in Metro Detroit:\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter appeared to be the first to break the news of Williams' death at about 7 p.m. Monday and posted the following statements from Williams representative and wife on its website:\n\nPublicist Mara Buxbaum: \"Robin Williams passed away this morning. He has been battling severe depression of late. This is a tragic and sudden loss. The family respectfully asks for their privacy as they grieve during this very difficult time.\""
