        "text": "Perhaps actor Robin Williams will be best remembered as Mork from Ork, the suspenders-clad alien who lived in Boulder, Colo. and laid the catch phrases “nanu nanu” and “shaazbot” on a recession- and scandal-weary 1970s America.\n\nOr maybe it will be as the well-disguised divorced dad desperately trying to hold his family together while posing as an English maid named Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nSadly, the laughter the funnyman and Oscar-winning actor brought to so many was tinged with sorrow Monday as authorities in Northern California announced that Williams, 63, had taken his own life\n\n“Robin Williams was an airman, a doctor, a genie, a nanny, a president, a professor, a bangarang Peter Pan, and everything in between,” President Barack Obama said in a statement. “But he was one of a kind. He arrived in our lives as an alien — but he ended up touching every element of the human spirit.”\n\nMaybe it’s odd for the president to issue a statement on the passing of a comedian, but Robin Williams’ was more than just a comic. His routines defined observational humor for whatever my generation is called. And, his acting could be as magnificent as any practitioner of the craft you can name, earning him awards and honors from his peers, critics and fans.\n\nBorn in Chicago to a auto company executive father and a model mother, Williams grew up in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and attended the Detroit Country Day School. When Williams was a teenager, his family moved to Marin County in Northern California. There he attended the Redwood High School. He briefly attended Claremont Men’s College — now Claremont McKenna — and enrolled at Julliard with Christopher Reeve in 1975. The two would become life long friends.\n\nWilliams’ abilities as a mimic and a mime were often showcased in racy early HBO comedy specials that aired in the late 70s. The comedian, often bouncing from character to character, joked about drugs, sex and abortion while he frequently engaged members of the audience in his routines. And they were routines that couldn’t be easily mimicked by me or my friends at Bellarmine or San Jose State, try as we might.\n\nDuring one televised 1977 performance Williams ran to the back of a dimly lit auditorium and said, “Let’s get a larger crowd in here,” before opening curtains to the lobby and shouting “Free cocaine.”\n\nWe laughed because we knew it would work.\n\nCocaine and Williams went together like Rodney Dangerfield and his ever-present tie or Dean Martin and his cocktail glass. He frequently turned to it for a punch line.\n\nIn a 1986 skit Williams joked about the drug and its powerful effect on users.\n\n“There’s a wonderful thing called ‘freebasing,’” Williams said with the rapid-fire delivery that would become his trademark. “It’s not free, it can cost your house. It should be called ‘home basing.’ ”\n\nWilliams would go on to do several more HBO specials culminating in his 2009 “Weapons of Self-Destruction Tour.”\n\nDuring that tour a more matured and measured Williams joked about life in the Golden State.\n\n“In California this summer all the state parks caught on fire, which was sad because these parks are full of weed. It’s bad news. Even the guys fighting the fires were like ‘Ha ha ha. Oh my God! Make another rainbow Tommy.’”\n\nWilliams’ wife, graphic designer Susan Schneider, released a statement filled with the sort of sentiment fans and friends around the world expressed as the news of the actor’s death spread.\n\n“This morning, I lost my husband and my best friend, while the world lost one of its most beloved artists and beautiful human beings. I am utterly heartbroken,” she said. “As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin’s death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.”\n\nSchneider was Williams’ third wife. He is survived by Schneider and his three children, Zachary, Zelda and Cody.\n\nIn a statement issued Monday afternoon, the Marin County Sheriff’s Office, Coroner’s Division, reported receiving a 9-1-1 call at about 10 a.m. from Williams’ home in unincorporated Tiburon, about seven miles north of San Francisco.\n\n“At this time the Sheriff’s Office Coroner Division suspects the death to be a suicide due to asphyxia, but a comprehensive investigation must be completed before a final determination is made,” the statement said.\n\nThe actor was last seen alive around 10 p.m. Sunday. Officials will perform a toxicology test before making a final determination as to the cause of Williams’ death. An autopsy will be performed today.\n\nWilliams appeared in dozens of films and television shows. He won several Golden Globes and earned an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as Sean Maguire in the film “Good Will Hunting.”\n\nCelebrities occupy rarified turf. We measure them through the looking glass, but should note that they are real people who live real lives and leave behind real impressions.\n\nA friend of mine told how Williams once offered his estate to the family of one of his employee’s so that they could celebrate an important family occasion. When the event ended Williams followed up to make sure the South Pasadena couple had a good time.\n\nWilliams’ friends loved him too. As the news broke Monday many took to social media to express their grief. “I am so sorry about Robin. He was sweet and generous and kind as well as a comedic genius. This is just terrible news. #RIPRobinWilliams,” wrote late night talk show host Craig Ferguson.\n\nComedian and actor Eric Idle of Monty Python expressed his sadness too.\n\n“I am sick with grief,” Idle posted. “I can’t believe my lovely friend is gone. My heart goes out to his wife and his beloved children. He brought us so much joy and laughter.”\n\nWhile laughter was the attribute that brought Williams into American living rooms in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the actor struggled with alcohol and drug addiction and depression throughout most of his adult life.\n\nWilliams told an interviewer for the Actor’s Studio on Bravo that he quit using cocaine after the death of his friend fellow comedian John Belushi.\n\n“Was it a wake-up call? Oh yeah, on a huge level,” he quipped. The grand jury helped too.”\n\nWilliams’ described himself on Twitter as an “Actor, Comedian, Cyclist, Retired Mime.” He had been infrequently active on social media platforms including Instagram through July. Among the posts was a photo of Williams reaching out to a monkey at the San Francisco Zoo with the caption, “Feeding “Robin Williams”, a Howler Monkey named after me at the @sfzoo. What an honor! pic.twitter.com/UOagKvcAoi”\n\nFuneral arrangements are pending. I’ll be reliving the 70s and 80s on YouTube tonight.\n\n#RIP\n\nFrank Girardot is the senior editor of the San Gabriel Valley News Group and author of “Name Dropper: Investigating the Clark Rockefeller Mystery.” Follow him @FrankGirardot on Twitter."
