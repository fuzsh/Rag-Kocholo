        "text": "(1951–2014). American comedian and actor Robin Williams was known for his rapid stream-of-consciousness comedy and wild improvisation. He won an Academy Award for supporting actor for his role in Good Will Hunting (1997).\n\nRobin McLaurin Williams was born on July 21, 1951, in Chicago, Illinois. While in grade school he used humor to entertain his classmates, and he was a fan of comedian Jonathan Winters. When Williams was 16, his family moved to San Francisco, California. He subsequently studied political science at Claremont Men’s College (now Claremont McKenna College), where he began taking courses in improvisation. He then attended the College of Marin to study acting but later received a scholarship to study at the Juilliard School in New York, New York.\n\nWilliams eventually moved back to California, where he began appearing in comedy clubs in the early 1970s. By the mid-1970s he was guest starring on several television shows, including The Richard Pryor Show and Laugh-In. After guest appearances as the alien Mork on Happy Days, Williams was given his own show, Mork & Mindy (1978–82). The series proved an immense success and was instrumental in launching Williams’s film career.\n\nWilliams’s early movie appearances included leads in Popeye (1980) and The World According to Garp (1982). His first major role came with Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), in which he portrayed a military disc jockey. The role earned Williams his first Academy Award nomination. His second nomination came soon after for his performance as an inspirational English teacher at a boys’ school in Dead Poets Society (1989). In the early 1990s he starred in a number of successful family-oriented films. In Mrs. Doubtfire (1993) he played a father who dresses as a nanny in order to be close to his children, and in Jumanji (1995) he became trapped in a board game that came to life.\n\nWhile undoubtedly a successful comedic actor, Williams was equally adept at more sober roles. He played a distressed former professor in The Fisher King (1991) and a psychiatrist who mentors a troubled but mathematically gifted young man (played by Matt Damon) in Good Will Hunting. Both films earned Williams Academy Award nominations, and for Good Will Hunting he finally received an Oscar.\n\nAs his career progressed, Williams continued to act in both comedic and serious roles. He starred as a doctor who attempts to heal his patients with laughter in Patch Adams (1998) and portrayed a psychotic photo-lab technician who stalks a suburban family in One Hour Photo (2002). A 2002 stand-up performance led to the hugely successful Robin Williams: Live on Broadway (2002), which was released as both an album and a video. He later portrayed President Theodore Roosevelt in the comedy Night at the Museum (2006) and its sequel, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian (2009). He also provided voices for the animated films Happy Feet (2006) and Happy Feet Two (2011). Williams was sidelined with heart problems in early 2009, but later that year he resumed his comedy tour and starred in the family comedy Old Dogs.\n\nIn 2011 Williams—who had appeared in a 1988 Off-Broadway production of Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot—made his Broadway acting debut in Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo, a surreal comic drama set during the Iraq War. In 2013 he returned to movies, portraying a priest in the farce The Big Wedding and President Dwight D. Eisenhower in Lee Daniels’ The Butler. The TV series The Crazy Ones, in which Williams played the head of an ad agency, aired for one season, from 2013 to 2014."
