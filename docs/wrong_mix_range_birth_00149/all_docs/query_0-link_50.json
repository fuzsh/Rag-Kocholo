        "text": "Salvatore “Sal” Colletti passed away peacefully on Monday, July 8, 2024, in Shrewsbury, Missouri, at the age of 76, after a three-year battle with pancreatic cancer.\n\nSal was beloved husband of Karen Colletti for 53 years; loving father of Carla Colletti (Eric Ring); cherished Nonno of Elizabeth; son of the late Francesco and Rosalia Colletti; brother of Rosario Colletti, the late Saverio Colletti, and the late Mario Colletti; brother-in-law of Richard and Maryann Pollacchi, Francesca Colletti, and Diana Colletti; and dear uncle, cousin, and friend to so many.\n\nBorn in Chiusa Sclafani, Sicily, the youngest of four children, Salvatore emigrated to the United States during his childhood, and his family settled in Chicago, IL. He attended Steinmetz High School, and in 1968, enlisted in the United States Army as an infantryman. He served in the Vietnam War as a soldier in the 101st Airborne Division and received the Bronze Star Medal and the Army Commendation Medal for his actions. He later became a citizen of the United States in Honolulu, Hawaii, 1969.\n\nAfter the war, Sal worked as a banker in Chicago, married Karen, welcomed his daughter, Carla, into the world, and built a life filled with laughter and dedication to his family and friends. He enjoyed skiing, woodworking, traveling, watching movies, listening to music, and cheering on his favorite Italian soccer team, Juventus, and his favorite Chicago sports teams. He later worked as a retail manager, became an avid golfer, was a member of the VFW Post 11018, Bartlett, IL, and eventually moved to St. Louis, Missouri, to be closer to his daughter and her family. In St. Louis, he was deeply involved with his community, serving as Warden of the Società Unione e Fratellanza Italiana (Italian Fraternal Union), and was a member of the Sicilian Cultural Association of St. Louis.\n\nSal was the life of the party. He was known for his humor, generosity, and the unwavering love he extended to friends and family alike. His presence brought a smile, warmth, and joy to those who knew him. He will be dearly missed by all who had the privilege of knowing him.\n\nVisitation will be on Friday, July 19, 2024, 10 a.m., at St. Peter Damian Catholic Church, 131 S. Crest Ave., Bartlett, IL. Mass will take place at 11 a.m., and burial to follow at Queen of Heaven Cemetery, Hillside, IL. A memorial service and celebration of life will be scheduled for later in the summer in St. Louis, MO."
