        "text": "Introduction\n\nBy definition, \"The act of deliberately taking one's own life or causing one's own death\" is referred to as \"suicide.\" Various causes of suicide have been studied, including mental disorders like depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder11.

Lancet. 2009;373:1372-81. The most commonly used methods of suicide include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms.

Suicide and psychiatric diagnosis: a worldwide perspective. World Psychiatry. 2002;1:181-5. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and permanent or long-term disabilities. Attempts are more common among young people and females. However, successful attempts are more prevalent among males. Therefore, it is a clinical challenge to save patients at risk from committing suicide. Neither celebrities nor politicians are safe from this cause of death. The suicide of the famous Oscar-winning actor Robin Williams (like many other \"celebrities\" before him) is one example of how famous people are not immune to suicidal impulses.\n\nOn August 11th 2014, movie fans in the United States and across the world were stunned when various TV channels broadcast, and internet news websites posted, the sad news that Robin Williams, the famous Hollywood actor and comedian, had died.99.

Williams chose a career in acting and later went on to become one of the most renowned actors Hollywood has ever produced.\n\nThe majority of people who attempt suicide usually suffer from major depression. Less than four percent of these eventually take their lives. The percentage of all depression sufferers who successfully commit suicide is very low, so what triggered Robin Williams' suicide? Was it just depression, or did a combination of problems lead to his suicide? This case study will highlight the event of the superstar's death and the factors leading to his death.\n\nCase description\n\nEvents leading to suicide\n\nIt is reported that Williams became addicted to cocaine during the late 1970s and early 1980s.1515.

He quit cocaine after a friend's demise. However, this event led Robin Williams to major depression, which is thought be a leading cause of his death.

Furthermore, fighting two divorces with two of his ex-wives not only proved to be emotionally and psychologically stressful, but was also an immense financial burden for the superstar. Divorce settlements cost him more or less tens of millions of dollars according to one estimate. This led to financial problems, which itself is a contributing risk factor leading to depression and suicide. He had to sell his 29.9 million dollar 640-acre ranch in Napa, California, which he had owned for more than ten years. Furthermore, another trigger for his depression was when CBS announced that his series, \"The Crazy Ones,\" would not get a second season. Robin's close friends claimed that this news was emotionally draining for Williams. This happened a little after his famous heart surgery, further aggravating his symptoms of depression.2020.

At 7:09 p.m. on the night before his demise he called his wife to tell her that he was buying magazines for her at a bookstore. He returned home fine and handed the magazines to her. He then spent some time searching through their closet, grabbed his iPad and left the room at 10:30 p.m., which is when his wife saw him last. She left the house the next morning assuming he was still sleeping. At around 11:45 a.m., William's assistant became worried due to his lack of response to text messages and phone calls and later found him hanging by a nylon belt in a closet door frame wearing a long black T-shirt and belted black jeans slightly suspended in a seated position, with superficial cut marks on the inside of his left wrist; with rigor mortis evidently visible. He was pronounced dead at 12:02 p.m. on Monday.2626. Youn S. Robin Williams: autopsy confirms death by suicide . Nov/07/2014.

His iPhone and wallet were found in his pockets.\n\nWilliams' assistant and his wife confirmed that despite a long history of severe depression he had never expressed suicidal thoughts or behavior. His pill box had been refilled the day before, but the medications remained intact in daily spots which showed lack of medication compliance. A search of his iPad revealed information about medications in his browsing history and no search results related to suicide or hanging. The telephone revealed no hint of him being suicidal.2626.

However, an unknown person interviewed stated that Williams had worked on a movie some years earlier in which his character's son accidentally died by autoerotic asphyxiation and the scene was very difficult and emotionally stressful for Williams and he may have researched hanging during filming. Later, an investigator revealed that he had watched the movie - a dark comedy called World's Greatest Dad - and found that (in the movie) the character's son was found seated on the floor, learning forward with a ligature around the neck secured by a belt - very similar to the position Williams' body was found after the death.2626.

All of these problems, except Lewy body dementia, have been described as risk factors for suicide. A significant psychiatric problem such as severe depression is often found in people who die by suicide or attempt suicide. In addition to depression, alcohol abuse is also considered as one of the most common disorders associated with suicidal behavior. The lifetime risk of suicide is usually around 4% in people suffering from mood disorders.3434. Bostwick JM, Pankratz VS. Affective disorders and suicide risk: a reexamination.

The lifetime risk of suicide in schizophrenia: a reexamination. Arch Gen Psychiatry. 2005;62:247-53.\n\nThis risk of suicidal behavior increases with a comorbid condition; for example, patients with depression and psychosis at the same time are more likely to commit suicide than patients with depression alone.3939. Cavanagh JT, Carson AJ, Sharpe M, Lawrie SM. Psychological autopsy studies of suicide: a systematic review. Psychol Med. 2003;33:395-405. The case description also mentions paranoia as one of the actor's symptoms, which does point toward an undiagnosed psychosis and if this were the case it would further aggravate the chances of committing suicide.\n\nAll kinds of substance abuse disorders increase the chances of a person committing suicide.4040.

Substance use disorders and risk for completed suicide. Arch Suicide Res. 2009;13:303-16. Likewise, the risk is further aggravated if alcohol or substance use is present together with other psychiatric disorders.

Unfortunately, all of these risk factors or contributors to suicidal behavior were present in the legendary actor Robin Williams' life.\n\nA careful examination of the life of the apparently pleasant, funny, and happy Robin Williams indicates that he was indeed suffering from major depression, alcoholism, drug abuse, financial problems, serious relationship issues leading to multiple divorces, and Lewy body dementia, all of which are considered risk factors leading to attempted and successful suicide. In this case, a combination of all these factors, or the comorbid condition of such severity, even though not apparent to the world, ultimately led to his suicide. His symptoms, as described, also point toward a possibility of acute psychosis, although this diagnosis remained unconfirmed.\n\nIn the 21st century, various countries have developed national strategies that involve commitment by their governments to prioritize and tackle the problem of death by suicide. These involve education and guidance about evidence-based suicide prevention methods.5252. WHO. Public health action for the prevention of suicide: a framework [Internet]. 2012 [cited 2014 Apr 23]. apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75166/1/9789241503570_eng.pdf\n\napps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75166/... The United Nations has published \"Prevention of suicide: guidelines for the development and application of national strategies\".5353. United Nations. Prevention of suicide: guidelines for the formulation and implementation of national strategies. New York: United Nations; 1996. Unfortunately, despite all these measures, the suicide rate continues to rise. Educating doctors, nurses and other clinicians to identify depression, other mental disorders, and substance abuse and performing comprehensive evaluations of suicide risk are vital measures for preventing suicide. Continuous psychiatric training of psychiatrists and non-psychiatric clinicians should be arranged over a number of years in order to fight with this clinical challenge.5454. Du RoscoÃ¤t E, Beck F. Efficient interventions on suicide prevention: a literature review. Rev Epidemiol Sante Publique. 2013;61:363-74.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that patients, physicians, and psychiatrists should not take these risk factors lightly, but should take appropriate measures as soon as the symptoms of depression or alcoholism are observed in a patient, because these kinds of medical problems can be life threatening, as is evident from the case of the actor Robin Williams. Whether Lewy body dementia can trigger suicide, and whether it contributed to his suicide, is still a matter of debate and future studies may uncover this association."
