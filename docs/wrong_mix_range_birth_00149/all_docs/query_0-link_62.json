Starring Robin \"The Lady of Rage\" Allen (On Ten, Tha Dogg Pound & Snoop Dogg: Who da Hardest) along with Shane Johnson (Power) and Ian Bohen (Yellowstone) and directed by Tim Reid (Sister, Sister) the epic journey picks up in the late 90s' when, single mom Youree Dell Harris finds herself desperate to take care of her family and takes a job at the Psychic Readers Network -- only to become one of the networks most beloved personalities, Miss Cleo. But her challenges don't end there and when the network faces allegations of fraud and deception, they turn their sights on Miss Cleo. For the first time ever, Miss Cleo's side of the story will finally be told.\n\nKnown for her work during the late 1990's and early 2000's with the Psychic Readers Network, this professional telephone and television psychic Youree Dell Harris (Allen) was launched into the pop culture zeitgeist when the network's infomercials took off, making her a cult icon as the TV persona Miss Cleo. Fondly remembered for donning a colorful turban in a candlelit room, Miss Cleo dutifully listened to callers detailing the most intimate details of their lives. Miss Cleo ultimately became the face of the Psychic Readers Network, earning the trust and loyalty for those that called her. Years later, Harris' world was turned upside down with complaints that the Psychic Readers Network was fraudulent and spread false advertising. Facing angry fans, Harris was forced to defend her reputation to clear her name and escape financial devastation.\n\nMiss Cleo: Her Rise and Fall also stars Daphne Maxwell Reid, Cocoa Brown, Dwayne Boyd, Towanda Braxton, Jaida Standberry, Marley Taylor, Amelia Young, Stevie Baggs Jr., and Leslie Black. Miss Cleo: Her Rise and Fall is produced by Hillionaire Productions for Lifetime and produced by Jami McCoy-Lankford and Samone Norsworthy, Anthony Standberry, Ahmed Hussain and Jami McCoy-Lankford serve as executive producers and William J. Cone serves as consulting producer. Tim Reid directs a screenplay by Camara Davis.\n\nCall Me Miss Cleo the documentary chronicles the icons rise, fall, and reinvention of the '90s TV psychic Miss Cleo. Known for her larger-than-life persona and memorable accent, Miss Cleo, born Youree Dell Harris, garnered a nationwide cult following on the Psychic Readers Network, a popular telephone hotline that later came under fire for its alleged deceptive practices. Featuring interviews with celebrities and those closest to the self-proclaimed voodoo priestess, the film explores the many layers behind a complicated and charismatic figure. Call Me Miss Cleo was produced by Gunpowder & Sky for HBO Max. Van Toffler, Floris Bauer, Barry Barclay, Anne Loder, Jennifer O'Connell, and Lizzie Fox serve as executive producers.
