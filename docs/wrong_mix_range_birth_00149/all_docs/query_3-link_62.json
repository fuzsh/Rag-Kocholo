        "text": "Principal Oboe\n\n“Robin Williams’ heart-wrenching oboe solos were to die for in their sheer beauty.” – Herald\n\nBorn in West Bromwich, Robin Williams attended Wells Cathedral School where he studied oboe with Janet Craxton. He went on to study with Peter Graeme at the RNCM, where he was a major award winner of the Countess of Munster Trust and was finalist in many prestigious competitions (including in the first ever BBC Young Musician of the Year).\n\nAfter graduating, Williams spent several years abroad, as concert soloist with the Heidelberg Kammerorkester, the Wiener Solisten, the Johann Strauss Sinfonietta and Musikkollegium Zurich, and subsequently as Principal Oboe with the Espoo City Chamber Orchestra in Finland. Moving to Germany in 1990, he worked with the Niederrheinischen Sinfoniker.\n\nRobin appears regularly as part of the SCO Wind Ensemble, in chamber music and as a soloist with the SCO, including Kenneth Leighton’s Veris Gratia (with cellist Raphael Wallfisch) and Mozart’s Oboe Quartet K370 as part of a chamber music disc directed by Alexander Janiczek. His recordings include Bach’s Oboe and Violin Concerto (directed by violinist Joji Hattori), Vivaldi’s Oboe Concerto in A minor as part of a mixed disc of Vivaldi concertos conducted by Nicholas McGegan."
