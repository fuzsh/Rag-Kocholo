As they ferry their explosive cargo to a faraway oil fire, each bump and jolt tests their courage, their friendship, and their nerves. The result is one of the greatest thrillers ever committed to celluloid, a white-knuckle ride from France’s legendary master of suspense, Henri-Georges Clouzot. (Janus Films)\n\nThis film is screening as part of Arkadin’s TAKE TWO series, where we show a great film and its equally excellent remake. Check out William Friedkin’s rip-roaring remake Sorcerer at 7pm just after The Wages of Fear."
