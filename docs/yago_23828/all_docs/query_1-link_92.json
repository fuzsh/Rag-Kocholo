        "text": "After probably the most purely enjoyable opening film in recent memory – Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr Fox – the London film festival is offering up items of pure gold, and I have to take a moment to dwell on one of this festival's most notable, though somehow least noticed qualities: its structurally embedded francophilia.\n\nWe here in perfidious Albion may be grumpy about France in many ways, but as an institution, the LFF every year does its level best to promote the entente cordiale in British public life. For as long as I can remember, it has had a separate section specifically for French films, entitled French Revolutions. German films don't merit a separate section, neither do Spanish films, Italian films, Turkish films or Iranian films. Nope – they are placed in the Cinema Europa or World Cinema, or for those prominent entrants, into the Gala or Film on the Square sections.\n\nNow, it has to be said that our native British films do get a separate section at the LFF, entitled New British Cinema, which always looks to me like a patriotic consideration for the home team. The French getting their own national section is clearly quite different. It is a quiet but firm reiteration of the core conviction – amounting to a tacit article of faith among cineastes – that there is something super-special about French cinema and French movie-makers. Is that fair? Is it outmoded? Is there a whiff of stale Gitanes smoke around that assumption? Maybe. But if I ever felt like complaining about the French emphasis in the LFF, then that niggle was utterly blown out of the water by the superbly fascinating documentary that headlined the French films: L'Enfer D'Henri-Georges Clouzot, written and co-directed by the ebullient film historian Serge Bromberg.\n\nThis is an attempt at once to resurrect, to reconstruct and explain one of the great lost films: Henri-Georges Clouzot's L'Enfer, or Hell, the making of which sent the great French director into his own personal hell from which he probably never emerged.\n\nHaving amassed a brilliant reputation with classic thrillers such as Le Corbeau (1943), Le Salaire De La Peur (1953) and Les Diaboliques (1955), Clouzot also enjoyed the glamour of having made a well-regarded movie with Bridget Bardot in the leading role: La Vérité (1960). He now had the clout and the Hollywood backing for what was clearly going to be his masterpiece: L'Enfer, about a married couple who run a hotel. The husband conceives a paranoid jealous obsession with his wife's supposed affairs and descends into an unending nightmare.\n\nClouzot had some bold and brilliantly experimental ideas about how his crazed mental state should be represented. The movie would switch from black-and-white to colour to convey his lurid fantasies. The techniques of op art would be employed. Strange new colour schemes, involving innovative camera technology, would splash across the screen. Long, weird dream-like sequences would challenge conventional narrative form and the audience would be jolted by bizarre surreal juxtapositions. It would centre on his leading lady Romy Schneider, transfigured by the director's passionate scrutiny.\n\nBut the movie never got finished. The leading man fell ill, and the director – to the dismay of his crew – was behaving strangely. He took perfectionism to new levels. He shot miles and miles of unused film. He made the crew wait around for weeks and months while he brooded on images and ideas. Eventually, funding and insurance collapsed, the project was abandoned and Clouzot himself was never the same again.\n\nWhat on earth happened? Many answers are suggested in Bromberg's film which unearths stunning footage and attempts reconstructions of the dialogue with modern actors. (In fact, Claude Chabrol filmed a version of L'Enfer in 1994 using Clouzot's original shooting script.)\n\nClouzot had always been the most efficient and craftsmanlike film-maker. Never before had he shown a Kubrick-esque tendency to self-indulgence. And yet he had lately been stung by mockery from the radicals of the new wave, who teased him for sticking to the script and making conventionally polished drama. Could it be that at the age of 57, he was suddenly convulsed by a late creative menopause, by a need to show these youngsters his potency in that most exhibitionist of media, the cinema? There is also a certain machismo in making everyone on a film set wait. Time is money in the film world, and so the person with the clout to make everyone hang about is the person with the greatest prestige.\n\nThen there is the nature of the film itself. A man descends into hell through futile obsession. The director sought to intuit that hell by participating in it. He cultivated his own Hitchcockian obsession with his leading lady, at once imperious and submissive – and that naturally had its own destructive sexual charge.\n\nAnd then there was something else, something more banal. Could it have been that the conventional film-maker in Clouzot – the down-to-earth craftsman – knew that however wonderful his experimental images were, and however replete with dizzying possibility, they would inevitably be reduced in power when he had to make a selection of the best and lock them into a finished film? The finished product would be a disappointment compared with the open-ended thrill of this creative process. Wouldn't it be more exciting to protract the process … indefinitely? I suspect that this played a great, if unconscious role.\n\nWhat a joy this film is: endlessly fascinating. Perhaps Bromberg's \"deconstructed\" presentation of its images comes closest to the excitement that Clouzot dreamed of. It can be seen again, I hope, when the LFF goes on a national tour; it is on again at the beginning of November at the Ciné Lumière at London's Institut Français."
