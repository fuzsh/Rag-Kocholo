        "text": "Diabolique (1955)\n\nJuly 4, 2018 1:19 PM - Subscribe\n\nThe wife and mistress of a cruel headmaster conspire to kill him; after the murder is committed, his corpse disappears, and strange events begin to plague the two women.\n\nSlant: Good thrillers usually suggest a world of perversity that the proper plot only partially touches on—a realm of unease that might play to our most paranoid suspicions of the danger inherent in everyday life. Henri-Georges Clouzot’s Diabolique, often and famously cited as an influence on Psycho, is such a film. Diabolique, like many of Clouzot’s movies, is really a caustic, despairing character study masquerading as a thriller. It conjures an atmosphere of suffocating rot that’s so palpable, in fact, that the murder plot is in many ways its least disturbing element.\n\n...\n\nAs Terrence Rafferty writes in his excellent essay that serves as the liner notes for this Criterion edition of the film, Clouzot’s attention to the neorealist chaos of the environment lends the thriller tropes an unusual credibility that can’t even really be found in much Hitchcock. Hitchcock was an expressionist, while Clouzot was somehow a realist and expressionist in roughly disconcertingly equal measure. The boarding school is portrayed with the stressed and rumble-ready textures of a real school, yet it also appears to exist in a realm of otherworldly myth that’s particularly embodied by the creepy pool into which Christina and Nicole eventually decide to dump Michel’s body.\n\nEmpire: Following the outdoor suspense of The Wages Of Fear, Henri-Georges Clouzot directs with a gray, claustrophobic cruelty that briefly made him seem a serious rival to Alfred Hitchcock. After drawing on Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac, authors of the book that Les Diaboliques is based on, for Vertigo, Hitchcock made Psycho explicitly to reclaim his ‘Master Of Suspense’ title, and took care to follow Clouzot by setting his most horrible scene in the bathroom and building up to a twist ending. It has several strong moments of physical horror (one trick with contact lenses is still creepy), but roots its nastiness in everyday cruelty — as when Michel forces his wife to eat a disgusting school dinner — and the down-at-heel, despair-haunted school setting.\n\nRoger Ebert: The famous plot of the movie usually deceives first-time viewers, at least up to a point. The final revelations are somewhat disappointing, but Clouzot doesn't linger over them. The most disturbing elements of the movie are implied, not seen, in the seedy air of the teachers, all of whom have seen better days and at least one of whom should probably be in jail.\n\nThe movie was made by Signoret in her heyday as a fleshier, blowsier French version of Marilyn Monroe. She makes a dramatic contrast to the petite Vera Clouzot, the director's wife; he often frames little Christina with Nicole and Michael looming over her.\n\nThere is the possibility, just hinted at, that Nicole may have lesbian designs on Christina. And there is a shabby depravity in the way Christina is so defeated by her husband that she lets him continue to run her school (and abuse her) even after he starts an open affair with the Signoret character.\n\nThe movie has fun with the usual whodunit details: The split-second timetables, and the sleepy old guard who must open the gates to let anyone in or out of the school grounds. The Inspector also amuses himself reconstructing timetables and quizzing a small student who seems to see and hear impossible things. Then comes the ending, inspired by \"Gaslight,\" in which a woman is either going mad, or nothing is as it seems. \"Diabolique\" is so well constructed that even today it works on its intended level - up until, say, the last 30 seconds.\n\nSenses of Cinema: In essence, Les Diaboliques is one of the greatest suspense films of all time. The film mingles aspects of moral decrepitude, revenge, a well-crafted ballet of appearance and reality, and the intricacies of the evil mind and how it never takes a rest. These themes come together in an eloquent and elegant cinematic/literary tribute to the craftiness of the fox and the wisdom and patience of the hare. I’ve always thought of Les Diaboliques as an Aesopian yarn of the hunter and the hunted, where the latter leads the expedition into attrition.\n\nThe lyrically mesmerising beauty of this film has to do with our witnessing just how the hare outfoxes the fox. In other words, how the fox outfoxes itself. Just how much the tables are turned on the hunter by its prey; this is the staple technique of this wonderful film. Don’t think that I will spoil it for you, for even if one wanted to, Les Diaboliques’ plot is far from easy to give away. Besides, when this magnificent film was first released, the director and the production company virtually begged moviegoers not to reveal the ending. I will honour this request.\n\nAt its core, Les Diaboliques is a story of avarice, a love triangle and the degree of evil craftiness that fuels each. Yet it is not a simple task to figure out just who is the most heinous character in this tale of moral torment. The psychological suspense of the film forces us to enter into the mind and soul of the characters. Les Diaboliques is not an experience for the lazy. Evil is subtle. The most effective perpetrator is always found quietly plotting and calculating behind the scenes. The writers of Les Diaboliques capture the meaning and import of evil like few films in this genre ever have.\n\nTrailer\n\nStreaming on YouTube with English subtitles, but with these annoying little pop up ads that come up now and then.\n\nAbout FanFare\n\nFanFare is a pop culture discussion site for TV, movies, podcasts, and books.
