        "text": "The Wages of Fear (Limited Edition Dual Format) | DVD | (23/10/2017) from £14.99 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nIn 1953, before any American studio exec used the phrase \"high concept\", Henri-George Clouzot's The Wages of Fear boasted a premise so literally explosive that audiences were excited before they got into the theatres. With an oil-fire burning out of control deep in the South American jungle, two lorryloads of highly unstable nitro-glycerin have to be driven through miles of unstable terrain littered with dangerous turns, crumbling planks, falling rocks and mediocre hardtop. One good jolt will vaporise truck, nitro, drivers and a substantial swathe of the countryside, so the company recruits desperate souls among the loser tramps who loiter around the nowhere town of Las Piedras, begging for any kind of work. On the road, Clouzot stages a string of unforgettable sequences: one stretch of badly paved track can only be crossed by driving at under six miles an hour or over 40; a mountain turn requires that the trucks back out onto a rickety, rotten wooden structure; a 50-ton boulder has fallen into the road, and one of the drivers calmly drains a litre of nitro into his thermos to blow it up, only remembering when the fuse is lit that this will rain pebbles all over the countryside and a few good hits on the cargo will set it off. This is perhaps as great a mix of action-adventure and contest as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and still a textbook example of sustained suspense. On the DVD: The print is in great shape, though the image is a little soft; the menu has a clever explosive aspect and uses the same vintage artwork as the sleeve cannily combined with a snippet. There are trailers for both Wages and Clozuot's other masterpiece, Les Diaboliques, as well as biographies of the principal cast, eight stills and three posters.--Kim Newman\n\nDiabolique | Blu Ray | (05/06/2017) from £19.98 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nLegend has it that Henri-Georges Clouzot beat out Alfred Hitchcock to secure the rights to this novel, which proved to be a veritable blueprint for an icy masterpiece of murder, mystery and suspense. Véra Clouzot plays the sickly wife of a callous headmaster of a provincial boarding school going to seed, and the commanding Simone Signoret is the headmaster's mistreated mistress. Together they plot and carry out his murder, a brutal drowning that director Clouzot documents in chilly detail, but the corpse disappears and a nosy detective starts sniffing around the grounds as threatening notes taunt the women. Clouzot's thriller is as precise and accomplished a work as anything in Hitchcock's canon, a film of gruelling suspense and startling shocks in an overcast, grey world of decay, but his icy manipulations lack the human dimension and emotional resonance of the master of suspense. Many critics have accused the film of being misanthropic, and Clouzot's attitude toward his characters is bitter at best, contemptuous at worst. The viewer is left on the outside looking in, but the razor precision and terrifying twists deliver a sleek, bleak spectacle worthy of attention. --Sean Axmaker, Amazon.com\n\nLes Diaboliques | DVD | (29/10/2007) from £20.00 | Saving you £-0.01 (N/A%) | RRP £19.99\n\nLes Diaboliques is an unsettling and beautifully-paced study of betrayal mistrust and guilt. Set in a decaying boarding school it shows the grim course of a peculiar relationship between two female teachers and a sadistic headmaster. Atmospherically shot in black and white its murky tones hauntingly echo the moral ambiguity of its pricipals.\n\nThe Mystery Of Picasso | Blu Ray | (22/01/2018) from £16.55 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nThe Mystery Of Picasso Henri-Georges Clouzot, best known for his classic French thriller Les Diaboliques, took on a different mystery in 1956: the creative process and the essence of an artist, namely Pablo Picasso. Utilising transparent canvases so the camera of Claude Renoir could directly capture an artwork s creation, Picasso created 20 artworks for the film. At first, these are simple sketches in marker, but each grows in complexity until the final reel, when The Mystery of Picasso switches to a CinemaScope ratio and bursts into colour. One of the greatest documentary portraits of an artist of work, this release is accompanied by two other films of Picasso: Paul Haesaerts BAFTA-winning A Visit to Picasso from 1949 and a charming home movie by fellow artist Man Ray. Features: High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentation, from materials supplied by Gaumont Original French mono audio (uncompressed LPCM) Optional English subtitles A Visit to Picasso, Paul Haesaerts 1949 BAFTA-winning documentary on the painter, capturing Picasso at work in his Vallauris studio La Garoupe, a 1937 home movie by Man Ray, in black and white and colour, of Picasso and friends holidaying near Antibes Reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork by maarko phntm FIRST PRESSING ONLY: Illustrated collector s booklet featuring new writing on the film by author and illustrator John Coulthart\n\nLa Vérité (1960) | Blu Ray | (25/02/2019) from £17.99 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nBeautiful, troubled Dominique Marceau (Brigitte Bardot) came to bohemian Paris to escape the suffocation of provincial life, only to wind up in a courtroom, accused of a terrible crime: the murder of her lover (Band of Outsiders' Sami Frey). As the trial commences and the lawyers begin tangling over Dominique's fate, the Oscarnominated La vÃ©ritÃ©, directed by HenriGeorges Clouzot (Diabolique), delves into her past, reconstructing her struggle to find a foothold in the city. What emerges is a nuanced portrait of an impulsive young woman misunderstood and mistreated by those around her, and of her ultimately tragic affair with an upandcoming conductor. With an astonishing performance by Bardot, Clouzot's affecting and intricately constructed filma huge latecareer success for the French masterrenders a harsh verdict against a hypocritical and moralistic society. Features: New 4K digital restoration, with uncompressed monaural soundtrack Le scandale Clouzot, a sixtyminute documentary from 2017 on director HenriGeorges Clouzot Interview from 1960 with Clouzot Interview with actor Brigitte Bardot from the 1982 documentary Brigitte Bardot telle qu'elle New English subtitle translation PLUS: An essay by film scholar Ginette Vincendeau\n\nQuai Des Orfevres | Blu Ray | (05/03/2018) from £13.30 | Saving you £N/A (N/A%) | RRP £N/A\n\nA marriage that has fallen on hard times is further tested by the couple's implication in a murder.

However, when she agrees to a meeting at his home and he is found dead later in the evening - Maurice's untamed jealousy is in the frame.

A wave of hysteria sweeps the small provincial town of St. Robin when a series of poison-pen letters signed Le Corbeau (The Raven) appear, denouncing several prominent members of society. Starting with the village doctor, the slow trickle of sinister letters soon becomes a flood and no one is safe from their mysterious accusations. Condemned by the political left and right and the church upon its release in 1943, Clouzot was banned from filmmaking for two years after making the film.
