Note that director Clouzot was himself accused of having collaborated with the Nazis because he made a movie for the German controlled French government, and he was banned from filmmaking for five years, and this was his first film, dealing with a very similar theme, but borrowing heavily from G.W. Pabst's \"Pandora's Box\", but merging that plot with post World War II France. Many people consider this movie to be as good or better of a movie as \"Diabolique\", which is considered by most to be Clouzot's masterpiece, but this film is not nearly as well known, probably both because of its distasteful subject matter and is controversial nature, asking questions that are difficult to answer. Note that when this movie was first released in the United States in 1950, it was likely released as an \"arthouse\" movie (we can't say for sure, because we have never seen a first release U.S. poster), but it was soon re-released in the U.S. as a sexy foreign film, with all the emphasis on \"gorgeous, voluptuous 19 year old Cecile Aubry\".\n\nNOTE: Click on linked names to see a biography.\n\nImportant Added Info: Note that this still measures 7\" x 9 1/2\" [18 x 24 cm], but it has not been trimmed.\n\nCondition: very good.\n\nLearn More about condition grades\n\nPostal Mailing Address:\n\nBruce Hershenson, P.O.
