        "text": "This seems to have been marketed as a comedy-thriller, and I wasn't sure how I felt about Clouzot hamming it up when I have been such a fan of his far more serious minded films. I needn't have worried though - The Spies, although occasionally amusing and with some absurdist overtones, is really far more interested in being a taut thriller, and it's yet another cracker of a film from the man. Henri-Georges Clouzot is fast becoming one of my absolute favourite directors.\n\nClouzot always manages to evoke an intoxicating sense of place to his films, and this is no exception. Our setting is a crumbling old maison being used as a mental hospital by our protagonist, the rather hapless…\n\nTwo things I liked about this:\n\n1. This is a Cold War movie from a French perspective, so while France was not neutral during this tense time of world politics, the film is critical of the tactics used by both the Americans and the Soviets to terrorize the rest of the world (represented through innocent laypeople like Dr. Malic) into serving their political self interests. Through Hugo Vogel, the atomic bomb pioneer/target of both the Soviet spies and American spies, there is also criticism of these countries only taking an interest in science in order to bring death or at the very least the threat of death to the entire world.\n\n2. Peter Ustinov...wearing glasses...a nice suit and coat...with a…\n\nI love the work of Henri-Georges Clouzot. Although many consider 'Diabolique' or 'The Wages of Fear' to be his best film, I choose the fantastic 'Le Corbeau' as his finest achievement.\n\nAfter Diabolique in 1955 Clouzot makes a documentary about Picasso in 1956, his first box-office failure, and starts working at The Spies (Les Espions) shortly after.\n\nHe would like to make a filmadaptation of 'The Trial' by Kafka, but fails to get the rights. When he stumbles on a positive article in Time Magazine about the novel 'The Midnight Patient' by the Czech author, Egon Hostovský, he reads the novel and finds a Kafkaesque atmosphere in it. He contacts Hostovský, who is happy to sell the rights to him.…"
