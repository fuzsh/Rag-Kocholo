        "text": "You could say he created the action film, a suspenseful genre in which desperate protagonists had to keep moving to survive. He is also the director of not just the most frightening film ever made in France, but one of the scariest pictures from anywhere. Who is he?\n\nLast clue: he also made a documentary film about Pablo Picasso at work, still one of the most vivid encounters between cinema and painting. He was a master, yet he was loathed. I mean Henri-Georges Clouzot, a bizarre lesson in changing tastes, and a rare misanthrope about to be recovered at the National Film Theatre.\n\nIf you examine the moment of Clouzot's success, when Le Salaire de la Peur (The Wages of Fear) opened in 1953, with Les Diaboliques following two years later, it's hard to understand how Clouzot was so pushed aside by film culture. Together, those films helped build the arthouse audience for foreign-language pictures all over the world. It was enough, in an age when suspense was vital in cinema, for Clouzot to have a reputation on a par with that of Alfred Hitchcock (and Hitchcock was once in the bidding to do The Wages of Fear).\n\nEven though its high concept has affected so many other films, I wonder how The Wages of Fear will look now. It is the story of outcasts, the scum of the earth, who take on the job of driving truck-loads of nitroglycerine through the South American jungle. You know everything from that one sentence - just as the simple fun of Speed is revealed in the plan that Keanu Reeves must never let his Los Angeles bus drop below 50mph.\n\nThere are telling differences: LA is one kind of jungle, but, in the early 1950s, Clouzot went to the back country of South America (I think it was Brazil, but it could as easily be a jungle by the Douanier Rousseau). And Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are well-intentioned kids next to Clouzot's wastrels. His drivers, played by Yves Montand, Charles Vanel and Peter van Eyck, are hardened cases all of them, pessimists making a last gamble with life. It's a long film, claustrophobic and very contrived. It may seem hackneyed now - but appreciate the bleakness of its vision and the unsentimental portrait of dangerous men unglamorised by stars playing them.\n\nWhat made Clouzot such a pessimist? He might have pointed to the pitiless expose of human nature and false sentiments in France in the 1930s and then under Nazi occupation. Onlookers said no, the answer lay in Clouzot's jaundiced temperament, and in his lifelong struggle with bad health.\n\nBorn in Niort in 1907, his attempts to be a screenwriter were dogged by illness and poor eyesight. In fact, he spent several years in hospital in the mid-1930s, and, when he did work, he was always in jeopardy because of his insistence on harsh locations and his inability to relax. To work on a Clouzot film, it was said, was a form of prison: little humour was allowed, meticulous execution was the order, and no one worked more intensely than Clouzot himself. It was no fun - and that dank mood often shows.\n\nThe breakthrough for Clouzot came under the Nazi occupation, when he made Le Corbeau (1943), a glittering melodrama about a poison-pen letter-writer, set in the provinces and filled with unlikable people. Le Corbeau was made by a film company controlled by the Nazis, and that made for some suspicions that the film was collaborationist; this was the more easily felt in that the movie is so horrified at the texture of French provincial life. But we know now that the vision was Clouzot's alone, and that actually the film company achieved a high level of subtly anti-Nazi work.\n\nLe Corbeau has recently been restored, and it will feature prominently in the NFT season. It's one more sign of the depths of authentic bile and black ink that may be found in the French film noir. And it's a preparation for two postwar pictures, small gems of decay and nastiness, Quai des Orfèvres and Manon - pictures in which even the young lovers, overshadowed by destiny and corruption, prove to be helpless liars and twisters themselves. Manon, adapted from the Prevost novel, is set in occupied France and full of Clouzot's scorn for alleged heroes.\n\nStill no amount of being dragged through the gutter quite prepares one for Les Diaboliques. You may know the title, for the story has been remade in English: on TV with Sam Waterston, Tuesday Weld and Joan Hackett; and for cinemas as Diabolique, with Chazz Palminteri, Sharon Stone and Isabelle Adjani. If you have seen either of those, you have seen nothing.\n\nThe setting is a French boarding school where Paul Meurisse is the headmaster and a monster of cruelty. He has a wife (played by Véra Clouzot, the director's wife), who has a bad heart; and he has a mistress, played by Simone Signoret. This set-up is so consumed in loathing that everyone has a longing to kill everyone else, while the wife might be frightened to death. But what makes the film is the hideous school, the sense of damp, rot and poison everywhere - and the sheer incredulity that anyone would want to stay alive.\n\nLes Diaboliques has many plot turns, and many unhealed scars in my mind. So I'd far rather not get into the odious swimming pool, let alone the bathroom. Just try it for yourself. Perhaps it has gone stale and obvious by now. I doubt it. Few things date more quickly than films meant to frighten us. But Les Diaboliques is a little along the lines of Psycho: it leaves you wanting to be clean again, yet redefines all our feelings about baths and showers.\n\nClouzot usually did his own screenplays and, on Les Diaboliques, he worked from a novel by Pierre Boileau and Thomas Narcejac. Ever alert to box office, Hitch noted the triumph of Les Diaboliques and checked on other things that duo had done. He found another novel, D'Entre les Morts, which became the basis for Vertigo.\n\nThen, commercially liberated, Clouzot showed his disdain for conventional movies by making Le Mystère Picasso (1956). He had been friendly with the painter for years, and he had always wanted to paint himself. What prompted this film was the discovery of a method - that of filming from behind a translucent canvas - so that we can see drawings coming to life, and the face of Picasso at work.\n\nI'm not sure that the film is really so profound (in part because nothing can curb the show-off in Picasso), but it was a gimmick and a modest sensation, as well as a final discovery that there was something in life Clouzot cared about.\n\nStill, he had the fortune (or not) to be probably the most successful French film director functioning as the critics and directors of the New Wave came to power. They dumped on Clouzot for the most part. The man was not liked, and never kind to his juniors. The collaborationist rumours remained: Clouzot had been banned from work for a while after the war. And he was unashamedly rightwing.\n\nJacques Rivette was only the most pointed voice in a chorus that accused Clouzot of complacent cruelty, box-office cunning and cowardice in his pursuit of material. His one ally was François Truffaut, who had seen Le Corbeau so many times as a kid that he knew it by heart.\n\nIn the new age of young films, Clouzot then made his worst picture: La Vérité, in which Brigitte Bardot tries to be convincing as a woman on trial for murder. The commercial angle was as obvious as it was forlorn. A few years later, making a film called Hell, Clouzot had a serious heart attack. He died in 1977, having done only one other film, La Prisonnière, released in Britain as Woman in Chains.\n\nSo, it's not a cheerful story. But if you have a taste for French noir, unremitting doubts over human nature or extreme anxiety about drowning, then Henri-Georges Clouzot is for you. It wouldn't surprise me if young audiences today came out of The Wages of Fear and Les Diaboliques raving about masterpieces, and too afraid to go home in the dark."
