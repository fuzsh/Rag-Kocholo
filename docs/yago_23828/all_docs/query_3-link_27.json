        "text": "Often described as the French Hitchcock, Henri-Georges Clouzot (1907-77) moved from screenwriting to direction during the second world war when the French cinema was closely supervised by the German occupying powers. His masterly second movie, Le corbeau (1943), a bitter thriller about the corrosive effect of poison-pen letters on a small provincial town, was withdrawn for two years after the war, and Clouzot was banned from directing for six months after a rumour spread that the movie had been shown in Germany to expose French moral corruption.\n\nHis 1942 debut, The Murderer Lives at 21, a stylish black comedy, suffered no such fate despite the characteristic misanthropy underlying its light surface. A combination of Agatha Christie whodunnit and French roman noir, it features the great Pierre Fresnay as a suave police inspector pursuing a serial killer styling himself \"Monsieur Durand\". After a tip-off reveals that \"Durand\" lives at a seedy boarding house in Montmartre, the inspector, accompanied by his perky mistress (Suzy Delair), goes undercover as a Protestant pastor. But the killer could be any of the pension's eccentric guests. The script is clever, the performances engaging and the photography by the gifted veteran Armand Thirard (who later shot Clouzot's The Wages of Fear) is remarkable, considering the wartime restrictions."
