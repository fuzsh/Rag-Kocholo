        "text": "Spoilers ahead.\n\nThe women in Quai des Orfèvres defy the expectations of jaded cinemagoers to such a degree that it almost feels as if they're mocking us. We see the flirtatious married woman and immediately peg her as cold and promiscuous, someone who, no doubt, treats her husband like the burden he is. And the spectacular, bottle-blonde neighbor is clearly just biding her time, making clearer and clearer her designs on the husband, as she pushes her way into the lives of the mismatched couple and tries to make herself indispensable to the man she loves.\n\n(If they could see us, both women would laugh, roll their eyes, and dismiss us, just as they have so many others who presume…\n\nAs a man looks for his wife, he accidentally stumbles upon a dead body and becomes the prime suspect of a murder in the midst of Christmas eve.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot has to be one of the most overlooked directors from the past century, especially when talking about great filmmakers from the good ole' France. Les Diaboliques, Wage of Fear are some of his prime work and he showcase his talent on this movie that does a great job balancing the humor with crime procedurals. Louis Jouvet's L'inspecteur adjoint Antoine is awesome and his sarcastic personality makes for some of the best moments in the scene and brings up the laugh. There's also some great camera work and cinematography that enhances…\n\nStrange that this is listed here under the rarely used Jenny Lamour moniker. I only ever knew it under its original title Quai des Orfèvres, which is the address of the Paris police headquarters.\n\nUnder any title it’s one more masterpiece by the remarkable Henri-Georges Clouzot, probably the ultimate French noir and an absolute blast.\n\nLike Clouzot’s much better known 1955 classic Les Diaboliques this one also features two women living in the same house, both involved in the murder of a detestable man. But how different both movies are. Where one is nasty, pessimistic and mean-spirited, this one is joyful, relaxing and ultimately life-affirming. How does this go together with film noir, you may ask. Well that’s probably just…\n\nThe story is ridiculous but the energy, the grit, the idiosyncrasies, and most of all the cavalcade of well drawn characters is what this is all about. For what it’s worth, Jenny is a budding star, happy to use her looks to land her a role in a movie. Maurice is her jealous, grumpy, poorly besuited husband who doesn’t want her anywhere near anything that resembles a threat to his manhood. Downstairs lives Dora a closet lesbian with her eyes on Jenny, and who everyone including Jenny assumes is after Maurice. And then there’s Brignon, the hunchbacked, lecherous producer who ends up in a pool of his own blood, with Maurice, Jenny and Dora all prime suspects. The first act…\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot’s comeback film after he had been banned for his collaboration with German-owned Continental Films during WWII, and the perceived anti-French (which it is not) Le Corbeau, is a terrifically entertaining Noir. It exhibits Clouzot’s usual misanthropic attitude in the poisonous relationship of the central couple. Maurice (Bernard Blier) is your typical noir loser: a plump, balding piano player married to a sexy singer (Suzy Delair). He is neurotic and suspicious. She is a flirt who is not above using sex to further her career, and it drives him crazy. The irony is that she loves him dearly, but his neurosis blinds him to the obvious and it almost destroys the both of them. The optimistic finale helps make…\n\nAt least this movie has an excuse for straying far from the source material: the people that adapted it only read it years beforehand and writing from hazy memories resulted in something only loosely connected to a novel (title translates in English to Self Defense) by Belgian author Stanislas-Andre Steeman. The differences are unknown to me but from scuttlebutt, the French-speaking Steeman was apparently a great mystery author who'd have many more English-speaking fans if more of his work was translated.\n\nAs I can discuss this movie, it's from Henri-Georges Clouzot, which is one of the reasons I had even heard of this (the initial time was years ago) and finally-via TCM-it was seen. As the movie was named after…\n\nWith the highly controversial Le Corbeau earning him a 2-year ban on filmmaking in France, Henri-Georges Clouzot made good use of his time off, returning to the limelight with a tight little police procedural in Quai des Orfèvres (French for \"Goldsmith's Quay,\" a title so awkward-sounding that it didn't even get an English translation, in spite of the fact that it probably leaves non-French-speaking monolinguals with aneurisms). The ban, a result of Clouzot's (and his film's) association with the German-controlled production company Continental Films, was evidently not carried out by the will of the people (several of his contemporaries successfully lobbied against the initial insane sentencing of lifetime excommunication from film production), and as a result, Quai des Orfèvres surprisingly…\n\n“Life’s no fun, that’s for sure.”\n\nThe French invented the noir concept, applying it mostly to American films, but they made noirish films themselves. Although Quai des Orfevres is ostensibly a police procedural, it has many noir elements: dark, threatening streets, characters wrongly suspected of murder, suggestive sexual situations, nightclub scenes, a femme fatale. Well, actually two femmes fatale, though one is fatale in a way unlike her American equivalents. The well-drawn characters and the actors portraying them are the best of many outstanding aspects of the film.\n\nSuzy Delair, as sultry singer Jenny Lamour, is almost a precursor of Jeanne Moreau, not conventionally attractive but alluring nevertheless. Delair, the mistress of director Henri-Georges Clouzot at the time, looks different…\n\nA singer and her husband fall under suspicion for the murder of a sleazy old man.\n\nThe more I see the more I feel there is something really special being done in the French films of the immediate post war period, something that has perhaps been glossed over in the rush to see the Nouvelle Vague as a much needed revolution. Maybe it's just Clouzot and Becker, I don't know, I've hardly seen that much from the period, maybe it's just a comparitively freer set of rules than the US or UK but there seems to be a fresh and vital feel to them with a real earthy sexiness to go incongrously well alongside real threat and stakes.\n\nHere Suzy…\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot remains to this day my 'master of suspense' but I feel that his work continues to be underrated and he almost forgotten. Watching this film today reminded me why I love him so much so I thought I might take this chance to express that.\n\nThe trademark of any Clouzot film is the claustrophobic paranoia that inhabits every single scene. The way he frames every shot with intensity, the way his characters act psychologically, and the way his plots snowball out of control all pull you into the film but in an unnerving way. You feel like the room is getting smaller and smaller and smaller. You feel trapped, just like the characters, and there’s that strange sense…\n\nWorld Tour 2020\n\nSo today's double-bill of Henri-Georges Clouzot has left me in almost the same position I was in with his films before today.\n\nThey're still not totally doing it for me and, again, I felt it was for a different reason this time. I felt like as soon as Quai des Orfèvres crossed over into its police procedural territory that the tone of this changed, mainly because Louis Jouvet, as the chief cop investigating this murder, played it a bit too much for laughs.\n\nThe plot is ingeniously woven but I just was frustrated that it wasn't darker or more intense. It's almost too flamboyant and stylish for the story it was telling but that story is *so*…"
