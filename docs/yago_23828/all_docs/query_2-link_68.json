        "text": "A house of cards built on a bed of sand in the middle of a hurricane; it flies apart and collapses almost immediately.\n\nIts anarchic and rambunctious approach to the genre results in an entertaining hybrid of comic book action and straightforward satire.\n\nBy placing itself in the shadow of \"Twister\" and relying so much on story beats of the original, it feels like the most unnecessary of films.\n\nAlthough better than it has a right to be and represents a worthy way to dispose of a couple of hours lying on the couch at home, this is hardly a triumphant return for Axel."
