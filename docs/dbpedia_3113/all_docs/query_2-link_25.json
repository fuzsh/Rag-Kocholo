I enjoy working with cord, rope, and knots. I carry several pieces of cord in my pockets and share my knotting skills with interested parties. I then leave most with a new piece of cord in the hope they will continue their interest. It's satisfying to consider that perhaps Grandma's rocker will survive the pickup truck ride across seven states to a new home or some youngster will find his boat still tied to a tree the next morning after a campout on the river.\n\nJohn T.

I found your website because I'm a volunteer at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi and I was doing a search for knot tying because I'm making a smallish soccer goal post for the kids at the hospital and I was looking for some advice on on how to make netting. I didn't find exactly what I'm looking for but enough to get by. The knots I'm tying certainly are not load bearing knots but they at least look like symetrical diamonds which makes the net look reasonable! (I thnk I'm using a really, really warped version of the carrick knot). Anyway, I'd like to comment that the background image for your home page is cool, but makes the type difficult to read. I think a plain white background with rope braiding for the borders only would be much more reader friendly and still convey the same ideal of kick-ass knot tying. From Nairobi, thanks again for all the hard work you've put in to your site.

I too appreciate the \"simple\" tools aka knives, rope & brains. I'm a bit of a knot nut in my circle of friends. I like to review the 'good ones' from time to time so I can actually use them when needed. I'm still not over the 'tricky' part as you warned. I guess I'm not doing a good job of controlling \"rolling\" the knot back & forth. Could you consider labeling the 'tag' end versus the 'standing' end? Thanks for your efforts here.

Bend behind the bar, insert second bend from in front of bar, insert third bend from behind the bar, pull on the standing part. A jerk on the bitter end will release instantly. Thanks.\n\nJames W.

(meaning TRUCK in England ). Imagine securing a load down on a truck. One end is made fast. In the middle, the Lorrie knot (loop)then through an eye or cleat on the other side. The rope is then brought back through the loop and pulled tight and finished with a standard hitch. Most people make a loop using an overhand knot which hardly EVER can be undone! The beauty in the Lorrie knot is ,no matter how tight you pull on it , it simply falls apart !! Have you ever heard of this knot? If not pass it on to other enthusiasts and give me a hollar back if you would. I appreciate your time and efforts!Nice job on your website, I'll pass it on to the boys in the neighborhood.\n\nJohn Riegel <jdanger57@yahoo.com>\n\nYork, PA USA - Saturday, August 01, 2009 at 14:31:12 (EDT)\n\nFor some years I worked as a commercial diver.As you probably know, rigging is an essential requirement.During that time I worked with some boys from England.When securing a load they would most always use a knot they called the \"LORRIE\"knot.

Start it by passing the bight behind your back, then progress to tying it on a rope lying on the deck. Easy. I am looking for a method of tying the bowline into a heaving line as the line is thrown. I know that Breton fishermen use this method. Anyone know where to find it?\n\nGraham Crooks <grahamcrooks@gmail.com>\n\nAuckland, New Zealand - Thursday, July 30, 2009 at 20:38:03 (EDT)\n\nI like the way your website on knots is laid out. Animations are great. Consider for your next revision two suggestions. First - regarding the Turks Head and other similar decorative knots, you may wish to describe the diameter thickness of the string that would work best for the Woggle Slide. In my Wood Badge Staff Development Training that I am taking, I had mentioned that I thought 1/4\" would be good, but I found out I was wrong. I have still yet to get to find out what would make a good size string for the woggle. The second topic is where you talk about knives for knots. Although I skimmed through your pages of knives, nowhere did I see any discussion regarding Geman steel. I use a K55 Mercator knife at work, and everyone has always said how the German steel, and specificaly Soligen Steel, holds its edge and how easy it is to sharpen. I just felt these two topics may be deemed worthy for your next update. As far as the humor goes, I loved it. I don't know how many times I have heard or seen the frayed knot joke, but I still love it. I do not know if you are familar with the Dragon Bowline joke where a student is taught how to make a Bowline then the instructor drops it on the floor and pulls it. To which the student says, \"Now what are you doing?\" and the instructor says, \"I just made a 'Dragging Bowline!\" (Ba-da-bum) I hope you found that worthy of putting into your humor section. Finally, I just want you to know that I will reccommend your website to my son's Boy Scout Troop when we restart in September, because I found it that helpful. Good luck and much success on your website.

One addition you may wish to consider to your knives (tools) section would be the use of palm, needle and bobbin for light stuff for binding loose ends and wrapping rope ends. I use a small version of the ones that you see commercial fishermen using to mend or form nets. It really improves an otherwise finger-destroying job.\n\nPat Shera <pshera@shaw.ca>\n\nNorth Saanich, BC Canada - Friday, January 09, 2009 at 00:54:43 (EST)\n\nAM GOING THROUGH CREW TRAINING WITH THE COAST GUARD AUXILLIARY.VERY HELPFUL.

I am an art/humanities teacher who teaches my students how to make Celtic knots and Japanese tetrahedron kites (among other things) which both require being familiar with knots as well as actually tying them. I was stunned to find that most children do not know how to tie knots. I looked around and found that most of the students wear slip-on or velcro shoes and most of the others with laces wear their shoes untied. So this year, rather than struggle with kids who don't know how to tie knots, much less draw them, I will introduce them to some basic knot tying. I will take your cue and use the colorful ropes for demonstration purposes and may even create some reference packets using your great step-by-step photographs. I will recommend your site as a reference for students who are inspired to go beyond my expectations and learn more on their own because the illustrations and animations are so clear and colorful.

Thanks for helping me tie an awesome tautline!\n\nMegan Cook\n\nWA USA - Tuesday, July 29, 2008 at 02:52:29 (EDT)\n\nA friend has asked the name of a knot that I use to tighten a tent line. It is tied back on itself with two loops in one direction and then one loop in the reverse direction. Almost like a prusik knot with one loop around the main line dropped. Any ideas?
