        "meta_description": "MY MEMORIES OF MARTHA AND LEVI HARKER By James Harker Clarke When I think of Grandma and Grandpa my heart is filled with a warm, happy feeling; but my mind is forgetful of the details of my early association. Perhaps the fact that we left Canada in 1934, when I was eleven years old, gives me some excuse for my poor memory. My memories are of a time when my parents, Mabel Harker and P. Drew Clarke, lived in Lethbridge and we would occasionally visit our grandparents Martha and Levi Harker; and Vilate Clarke who lived at the other end of Magrath. Usually we traveled in our old Nash car; occasionally Keith, my brother, and I were put on a train and my parents would come out later to take us back. Twice we rode our horse Flooz (sp?), which horse we purchased for $25 from Jim Harker, our uncle. One of my proudest moments was watching Levi, riding at the head of the parade on Flooze, and carrying a large Canadian Flag at the annual holiday celebrating Queen Elizabeth’s birthday. I remember Levi as a large man with a twinkle in his eye and a pleasant happy face, but not smiling. He had white hair and a white moustache and an air of authority that demanded respect from all with whom he came in contact, and that respect was freely given. I never remember anyone who did not respect him and no one who disliked him. I never remember him being angry. He had a calm manner and a soothing effect on anyone around him. I remember Martha as a happy hard working wonderful cook. Keith and I always begged to visit Grandma and Grandpa. My favorite treat, next to fresh homemade ice cream and the New Year’s Party, was homemade bread with fresh butter and sugar on top. Of the old home I remember mostly the kitchen with Grandpa in the Captain’s Chair, and the stove in the other corner, and kneeling for family prayer before breakfast. I also remember how much we loved the feather bed upstairs. Since I have become a grandparent looking back on my childhood visits to Magrath, I wonder if Keith and I being the only grandchildren who lived out of town and being the only children of the only daughter; I sometimes wonder if Martha didn’t spoil us, almost as much as they probably spoiled Doreen. One story I remember, that occurred before I was born. Apparently several of the teenagers, about my father’s age probably, were tormenting “The Chinaman', who owned the café in Magrath. The Chinaman spoke to Levi to intercede with the teenagers. Apparently even they respected and were obedient to his request. Not long after “The Chinaman' gave to Martha a beautifully embroidered red silk scarf about two feet by five feet, which my mother inherited and which I inherited from her. Every Christmas Eve when we have our family for dinner the scarf is down the middle of the table, giving the table a very elegant appearance, and recalling to my mind my wonderful Grandparents, and the annual New Year’s party for the large Harker Family. Another story that involved Levi, also occurred before I was born. My father’s father, Peter Gemmel Clarke was Levi’s counselor in the Magrath Ward Bishopric. Peter Gemmel Clarke died of Cancer when Peter Drew Clarke his eldest son, and my father, was seventeen years of age. Drew worked for four months earning $40.00 per month, enough to pay his way through one year of Normal School. The rest of the family stayed in Utah with relatives until the spring following the funeral. When Drew finished Normal School he got a job teaching school at $65.00 a month and this was the main income for a family of seven. His mother earned a little money selling cream, eggs and chickens. Drew also ran the farm for a meager additional income. He started playing pool after it got dark when he could no longer work on the farm. The pool hall closed at midnight and then he would often play poker the rest of the night. He had little thought of the worry and sleepless nights he was causing his mother. This went on about 18 months. Many family friends tried to talk to Drew, but he was too impressed with his own importance to listen. Bishop Levi Harker had watched quietly hoping Drew would come to his senses. Near the end of 1915 Bishop Harker, had a serious talk with Drew, probably because of Levi’s love for Peter Gemmell, his former counselor, Bishop Harker made it plain that Drew “was on a straight road to hell”, and asked Drew to accept a mission cal. Bishop Harker was the only one Drew respected enough to even listen. Nevertheless, Drew knew there were two reasons that made it impossible for him to go on a mission. First, he was completely unworthy, but Bishop Harker told him he could and should repent. Second, he contributed about 90% of the family’s income and they could barely survive on that and if he left they wouldn’t have nearly enough to live on, and especially not enough to pay his way on a mission. Drew about fainted when the Bishop told him that his family would be happier and much better off after he was gone; and the Bishop promised him that if he went on a mission and did his best, the Lord would bless and prosper his mother so that she would be better off financially when he returned home than she was when he left. Drew thought of the mortgage on the farm and the small two room home. The oldest brother left would be only ten years old. There was no one to farm or pay the mortgage..but trusting Bishop Harker, Drew accepted the mission call and served twenty-four months in the Northern States. While he was gone two of his brothers died of Diphtheria. How the family survived and paid for his mission I have never found out. I wonder if Levi didn’t arrange for some financial aid to help them. In January 1916 Drew left on his mission. In May Bishop Harker called on members of the Ward to meet at the Clarke Farm. In one day eighty acres were plowed, harrowed and planted with wheat. That fall the crop was the best crop of wheat the farm had ever produced. The wheat was cut and stacked in the field. A heavy snow came, melted some and then froze. Each bundle was frozen to the ground and was not harvested until May 1917. Mice, wild geese and loose cattle fed on the wheat all that time. In May when the crop was harvested there was enough wheat left to bring in more money than the farm had ever produced. When Drew returned home, after a wonderful mission his mother had paid all her debts, built a nice four room home, installed a new furnace and electricity, neither of which she had ever had, and new furniture for the whole house. Levi’s reputation for prophecy became even more well established than before. In summary I am especially proud that Levi and Martha Harker were my grandparents. I always loved and respected them and everything they did. In my opinion, there is no question that Levi Harker was by far the most outstanding person who ever lived in Magrath. | BillionGraves",
