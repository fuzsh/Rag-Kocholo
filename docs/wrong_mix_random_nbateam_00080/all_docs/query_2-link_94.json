        "text": "Jane Eyre\n\nby Charlotte Brontë\n\nPenguin, £6.99\n\nI first read this as a teenager at a convent school when I was young and easily influenced. It really chimed with where I was: we were both young women caught up in very intense situations. Later in my 20s I read Jean Rhys’ prequel Wide Sargasso Sea which was also a big fascination. I identified with Jane as an outsider caught up in an intense romantic situation. The Victorian integrity of the book appealed.\n\nThe House Of The Spirits\n\nby Isabel Allende\n\nVintage, £8.99\n\nI love rich South American mystical and political books and I loved the expanse of this epic spanning generations. It felt enormous and spiritual and very feminine.\n\nThe Magus\n\nby John Fowles\n\nVintage, £8.99\n\nA friend gave me this which is very different: very Sixties and masculine. The opposite of Allende’s book. It was very influential and is enormous: you disappear into it.\n\nFour Letters Of Love\n\nby Niall Williams\n\nPicador, £7.99\n\nA romantic, intense dramatic read about the relationship between a father and son. It is a personal and special book to me which I give to close friends and family. They find it reflects something in their lives. It is poetic, harrowing and realistic about love.\n\nInto The Silent Land\n\nby Paul Broks\n\nAtlantic, £8.99\n\nBroks is a neuropsychologist and these short stories are philosophical explorations of the mind, consciousness and imagination. It is funny, poetic and stimulating as he asks questions about who and what we are.\n\nHowards End\n\nby EM Forster\n\nPenguin, £8.99\n\nI read this for an audiobook recently and fell for it. It chimed with me as my family had a cottage that we shared like Howards End. I love when you read something from long ago and it feels so fresh."
