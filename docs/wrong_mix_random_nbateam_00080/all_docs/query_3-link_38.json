        "text": "Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice has topped a list of teachers' favourite books, external, compiled by the Times Educational Supplement (TES).\n\nAn online survey asked 500 teachers to name their favourite titles.\n\nHarper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird was second and the Harry Potter series third - but the top 100 also includes picture books like The Gruffalo.\n\nThe list \"is a masterpiece of erudition and entertainment\", according to TES editor Gerard Kelly.\n\n\"It could be one of the few things that Michaels Gove and Rosen agree on\", he writes in a leader column for the magazine, reflecting an ongoing disagreement between the secretary of state and the former children's laureate over the direction of English teaching in England's schools.\n\nMr Kelly points out that apart from a modern intrusion in the form of Harry Potter, the top 10 is dominated by the literary canon in the shape of the Brontes, Orwell and Tolkien.\n\nThomas Hardy, Dickens and Tolstoy all figure in the list, alongside books for very young children like The Gruffalo by Julia Donaldson, and Eric Carle's early years counting book: The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\n\nBethan Marshall, a senior lecturer in English education at King's College London told the magazine the literary merit of picture books was often underestimated, comparing The Very Hungry Caterpillar favourably with another literary hit, Yann Martel's Life of Pi.\n\nDr Marshall said the central plot line where the caterpillar eventually becomes a butterfly is transformational and \"worthy of Life of Pi, possibly even more meaningful than Life of Pi\".\n\nThe list also includes books for older children like Roald Dahl's The Twits, plus titles beloved of teenagers such as Stephanie Meyer's Twilight series and The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins.\n\nThere are also a number of English set texts: To Kill a Mockingbird is one, Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men is another.\n\nDr Marshall told the TES that this may reflect the broad nature of the teaching profession: \"When you have any eclectic group, including one made up of teachers, there are going to be those who don't read that much.\n\n\"So they think back to books that they've read at one time, and possibly that might be a set text.\"\n\nMr Kelly added: \"Strip out the children's books, the inclusion of which is only to be expected from people whose job it is to engage children, and what you are left with is a pretty canonical list.\n\nThere's enough Dickens, Steinbeck, Hardy, Wilde, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Hugo and Eliot to satisfy even the most conservative of politicians, and of course, plenty of modern greats: Kerouac, Ishiguro, Roy and Plath, to please the modernists.\n\n\"As a list, I think it's a pretty healthy reflection of a profession that really knows what makes a great book.\""
