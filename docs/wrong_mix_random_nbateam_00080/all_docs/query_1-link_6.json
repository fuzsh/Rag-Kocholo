He received three Laurence Olivier Award nominations for his performances in the original production of the musical Martin Guerre, the West End production of The Blue Room and the 2006 West End revival of The Crucible, portraying John Proctor.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nGlen was born on 24 June 1961 in Edinburgh, Scotland, and educated at the Edinburgh Academy,[3] an independent school for boys (now co-educational), followed by the University of Aberdeen.[3] He then trained in acting at the RADA in London,[4] due to it being the only one holding auditions at that moment.[3] He graduated in 1985 with an Acting (RADA Diploma),[4] having won the Bancroft Gold Medal. His older brother is Hamish Glen, artistic director of the Belgrade Theatre, Coventry[3] and former artistic director of the Dundee Repertory Theatre.[5]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nGlen's big screen debut came in the 1988 film Paris by Night, alongside Charlotte Rampling and Michael Gambon.[3] The same year, Glen appeared in Gorillas in the Mist with Sigourney Weaver.[3] In 1990, Glen won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 40th Berlin International Film Festival for his role in Silent Scream.[6] That year he was cast as Hamlet, Prince of Denmark in Tom Stoppard's film adaptation of his play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, which won the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival.[7]\n\nIn 1998, Glen was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor for his performance in The Blue Room starring opposite Nicole Kidman.[8]\n\nIn 2002, Glen starred with Emilia Fox in the Italian-French-British romance-drama film The Soul Keeper, directed by Roberto Faenza.[9] In 2008, Glen was Samson in the BBC Radio 3 production of Samson Agonistes directed by John Tydeman.[10]\n\nGlen starred as John Fielding in the 2008 British TV mini-series City of Vice.
