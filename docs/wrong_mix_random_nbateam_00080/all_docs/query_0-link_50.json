Echo-Hawk\n\nRacing through the thick buffalo grass, the mounted, uniformed Pawnee soldiers blew their war whistles and rode their ponies into American history. Their saga is recounted in these pages. The history of the Pawnee scouts is a stirring tale for soldiers and citizens of any nation, race, place, or age. It is about warriors who answered that age-old call to defend their homeland, their way of life, and the survival of their people. This band of brothers formed a unique military unit. Composed of warriors from the four bands of the Pawnee Nation, the Pawnee scouts fought as cavalry in the United States Army. They became, according to one military expert, “the most capable mobile strike force ever to take the field during the Indian Wars.”1 Until now, their remarkable military history has been unsung, except in tribal lore. Though much has been written about the Indian wars, the role of the Pawnee scouts is usually presented as incidental sidebar information by historians, who have focused on other combatants in the conflicts that swept the Great Plains during the nineteenth century. Thus it is not surprising that the history of the Pawnee scouts is not widely known, or that it has fallen into the realm of Hollywood fiction, twisted into a popular but false stereotype. Ignorance about the important role of the scouts in the service of the United States can be found even among military historians and career army professionals.2 Nonetheless, the scouts’ unique history deserves to be told. It is imbued with all the familiar hardships and heartbreaks faced by veterans across the ages, races, and cultures. It tells the story of victories, tragedies, privation, and sacrifice. This is the familiar lot of soldiers who, in this instance, xi\n\nxii\n\nforeword\n\nfought with all their might for the survival of their people during the tumultuous decades of the mid-nineteenth century, when the Pawnee homeland was engulfed by war, as Manifest Destiny raged throughout the plains. The Indian wars can be seen in a brand-new perspective when viewed through the eyes of the Pawnee warriors in uniform—the raaripákusu’, or, to neighboring Indian tribes, the “Wolf Men.” In those turbulent decades, the Pawnee Nation was under siege at home by several powerful allied confederacies of tribal enemies. The Sioux, Cheyennes, Arapahos, Kiowas, Comanches, Osages, Kansas, and others were bent upon the utter destruction of the Pawnee people and their way of life as one of the oldest aboriginal inhabitants of the Great Plains. Women and children were scalped and slain while working in village gardens; innocents were slaughtered during tribal buffalo hunts; and villagers lived under the constant threat of attack. The beleaguered Pawnee Nation thus became a military ally of the United States and furnished crack troops in the battle against common foes. These mounted soldiers provided the Pawnee Nation with a potent offensive capacity in the defense of its besieged homeland. Those who have maligned the Pawnee Nation for its military alliance ignore the war of annihilation brought against it by more numerous tribal adversaries. In the law of nations, the use of military force to repel aggression is the unquestioned right of any nation. Violence often follows when proud peoples collide. From at least 1850 to 1890 warfare was virtually constant on the Great Plains as cultures clashed. As the inextricable flood of immigration, settlement, and displacement uprooted tribes and threatened their ways of life in the years following the Civil War, unrest and turmoil were followed, ultimately, by the outbreak of full-scale war. The grassy expanse was occupied by numerous buffalo-hunting nations with proud warrior traditions. They were determined to protect their homelands. For more than 150 years the mounted horsemen of these nomadic Indian tribes barred settlement of the prairie by the Spanish conquistadors, Mexicans, Texans, English, French, and Americans. By the 1860s warriors made immigration through the grasslands downright dangerous, and skittish settlers scurried to more hospitable regions. Similarly, the United States was no stranger to the use of violence. From 1776 to the present, the long, almost continuous history of warfare places ours among the most violent nations on earth.\n\nforeword\n\nxiii\n\nThe resolve and warlike prowess of the indigenous peoples matched that of the warlike Americans. The Pawnee Nation resided in the epicenter of this storm. Armed by warrior traditions of their own, the Pawnees struggled valiantly to survive the clash between proud peoples. They were a nation adrift in a grassy sea of warring Indian tribes and American invaders, living in a violent time when their domain formed a vast cauldron of war. Times of adversity test the best within us. In this crisis, the Pawnee scouts emerged. As the first line of defense, they became a mobile strike force capable of driving the enemy from the Pawnee homeland. Their exploits carried on a warrior tradition from mythic times and provided a bridge to the present, as displayed most visibly in the many decorated Pawnee combat veterans who today wear the American uniform in distant places such as Iraq and Afghanistan. In carrying the war into the backyard of their enemies, the Pawnee scouts compiled an impressive string of military victories—winning many horses, trophies, and a Congressional Medal of Honor along the way. As Native soldiers trained from boyhood to pay close attention to the land, they were skilled trackers in the vast expanses of their aboriginal terrain. They were gifted scouts, deeply knowledgeable about their tribal foes, and ferocious warriors always found in the forefront of the fighting. One military commentator observes: The Pawnee Scouts were unique in American history. They were the most capable mobile strike force to ever take the field during the Indian Wars. The Pawnee Battalion fought as cavalry for the cavalry. Their forte went far beyond the traditional bounds of Indian peoples functioning as guides and scouts. And they were far more effective in an attack than anything demonstrated by other Indian allies and auxiliaries. The Pawnees served the full gamut of reconnaissance, security, and disciplined effective attack, and they routinely augmented or even replaced white army cavalry units.3 As this book shows, the Pawnee scouts played pivotal roles in many crucial military campaigns during the height of the Great Plains Indian wars (1864–77). With war howling at the very doorstep of the Pawnee Nation, these soldiers forestalled the specter of genocide in their homeland and safeguarded the cultural survival of their nation into the present. Those veterans in that urgent time of need became tribal heroes who left an enduring legacy.\n\nxiv\n\nforeword\n\nToday the Pawnee scouts hold an honored place in Pawnee history and culture. They provide ideals for bravery, instill the values of valor, and inspire patriotism for tribe and country. The scouts are revered in song and memorialized in tribal societies, ceremonies, dances, art, lore, names, and family oral traditions. Their history is taught in the Pawnee Nation College. Every family tree traces back to the Pawnee scouts. The Echo Hawk family lines, with which I am most familiar, afford an example of this pervasive influence. The names of our family’s forebears include Kutawikucu’ tawaaku’ ah, or Echo Hawk (Howard Echo Hawk; Powder River campaign, 1876–77); Asawiita, or Male Horse (Powder River campaign, 1864–65); Arusa to-tah-it, or Rides A Captured Horse (Robert Taylor; Republican River campaign, 1869); Resaru siti reriku, or The Heavens See That He Is A Chief (Baptiste Bayhylle; 1867); See-lee-lee-lu-ha-lu tike (Abraham Lincoln; Powder River campaign, 1876–77); and Rahekuts Kiripatski, or Little Warrior (Ralph Weeks; Powder River campaign, 1876–77). Like many other tribal members, I have walked the cemeteries where the scouts are buried, danced to Pawnee scout songs, visited the battlefields where they made their mark in history, and listened to the stories told by our elders. Scout lore in family oral traditions abounds. The Blaine family humorously recounts that the Pawnee scouts noticed that, when wounded, white troopers normally fell to the ground, propped themselves up, and strangely cried, “Wah tuh! wah tuh! wah tuh!” This behavior perplexed the Pawnees, who thought it was more prudent for injured soldiers to lie quietly concealed until the fighting was over.4 In our family it is said that the Echo Hawk name came from the battle against Morning Star’s Northern Cheyennes during the Powder River campaign of 1876–77. My great-grandfather enlisted under the name Tawi Hiisi, meaning Leader Of The Group, but he returned home as Echo Hawk after many scouts changed their names, according to tribal custom, to celebrate that victory in battle. He was part of an unbroken family warrior tradition that reaches into the twenty-first century. My Aunt Malinda (“Bink”) Hadley/Haragara (1910–89) was born in a camp south of Pawnee, Oklahoma, and knew the old-time Pawnee scouts. As a young girl she served them coffee, meat, and bread when they came to visit Echo Hawk. The old scouts would sit and talk about their exploits in Nebraska, and many still dressed in old-time Indian leggings. Some, like\n\nforeword\n\nxv\n\nRuling His Son, were gruff in the eyes of the young girl, but Echo Hawk told her to treat them with respect. They drank black coffee (rakits katit) without sugar, according to Aunt Bink, perhaps because that was the way they drank it on the campaign trail. Many stories told by these scouts at Echo Hawk’s camp are contained in these pages. In my mind’s eye, they recalled their days in words similar to those of Tahirussawichi (Arrives First). In 1900, while in Washington to make cylinder recordings of ceremonial songs for the Smithsonian Institution, he described the Powder River campaign of 1876–77: I think back over my long life with its many experiences; of the great number of Pawnees who have been with me in war, nearly all of whom have been killed in battle. I have been severely wounded many times—see this scar over my eye. I was with those who were sent to the Rocky Mountains to the Cheyennes, when so many soldiers were slain that their dead bodies lying there looked like a great blue blanket spread over the ground. When I think of all the people of my own tribe who have died during my lifetime and then of those in other tribes that have fallen by our hands, they are so many they make a vast cover over Mother Earth. I once walked with these prostrate forms. I did not fall but I passed on, wounded sometimes, but not to death, until I am here to-day doing this thing, singing these sacred songs into that great pipe [the graphophone] and am telling you of these ancient rites of my people. It must be that I have been preserved for this purpose, otherwise I should be lying back there among the dead.5 These are their stories. They have been compiled by my good friend, historian Mark van de Logt. It was my privilege to accompany him and family members on a summer camping trip as we retraced the campaign trails of the Pawnee scouts in the Republican River expedition of 1869 and the Powder River campaign of 1876–77. Those war trails, forts, campsites, and battlefields led us through largely unsullied natural landscapes in the prairie grasslands, river valleys, sand hills, and mountains of Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, and Wyoming, in the heart of the Great Plains of Native North America. This is where our ancestors rode into history and earned their place of honor in the Pawnee world. Their story is the story of our land, of the many conflicts and hardships that for better or worse birthed our country, and of the many proud and colorful peoples\n\nxvi\n\nforeword\n\nwho inhabit this part of Mother Earth. Although peace has been achieved in this haunting land, it is important to remember the travails of those who came before, as we look to the future of our diverse peoples now joined together on the land.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis book could not have been completed without the help and support of many people.

Augur defended his use of Indian scouts against criticisms from officials in the Interior Department who believed that military service retarded efforts to “civilize” these Indians. According to Augur, not only were Indian scouts effective military allies, but their service would also prepare them for entrance into white society. “It opens to those people a useful career, [and] renders them tractable and obedient, educating them more effectually than can be done in any other way.”1 Lieutenant General William T. Sherman agreed. “If we can convert the wild Indians into a species of organized cavalry,” Sherman mused, “it accomplishes a double purpose, in taking them out of temptation of stealing and murdering, and will accustom them to regular habits and discipline, from which they will not likely depart when discharged.”2 The Indians to whom Augur referred belonged to Major Frank J. North’s famous “Pawnee scout battalion,” as it was popularly but never formally known.3 Between 1864 and 1877 these scouts rendered invaluable military assistance to the United States Army. The Pawnees called them raaripákusu’, which means “constant fighters” or “persistent fighters.”4 They joined the army in many operations against resisting Indian tribes, who usually were enemies of the Pawnee people as well. During these operations their duties involved much more than scouting alone. The Pawnee scouts led missions deep into contested territory, tracked resisting bands and spearheaded attacks into their villages, protected construction crews of the Union Pacific Railroad against Indian raiders, carried dispatches through dangerous territory, and, on more than one occasion, saved American troops from disaster on the field of battle. Within a few 3\n\n4\n\nintroduction\n\nyears the Pawnee scouts established a reputation as a highly effective fighting force. Sherman’s and Augur’s pontifications that military service streamlined the scouts’ assimilation into white society did not correspond to reality. Although the Pawnee scouts took great pride in scouting for the American army, they never relinquished their Indian heritage. In fact, military service reinforced established Pawnee martial values and customs. As scouts they continued to fight their enemies, the Sioux, Cheyennes, and Arapahos. Military service allowed them to exact revenge on these enemies with the approval and the guns of the Great Father in Washington, and to be paid for doing so. Their mode of warfare, based on stealth and surprise, changed little, if at all. They continued to count coups, take scalps, and practice their war-related ceremonies. Sherman and Augur were well aware that the success of the Pawnee scouts depended largely on their familiarity with Indian warfare, and the army enlisted them, first and foremost, for their skills as scouts, guides, and warriors. As a result, their commanding officers did little, if anything, to discourage the persistence of Pawnee martial traditions. Although the scouts proudly wore the army blue uniform of the United States Cavalry, they never ceased to be Pawnees. The Pawnee battalion was truly a war party in blue. Most histories of the scouts emphasize the role of Major Frank North in the extraordinary success of the Pawnee battalion. This is not surprising, because most of these studies are based on the writings of Luther North, Frank North’s brother. Luther North was troubled by the fact that his brother, who died in 1885, had never received the attention and public recognition he deserved, and he published numerous accounts in newspapers, magazines, and historical journals to correct this ommission. Even though these accounts are invaluable in reconstructing the history of the Pawnee battalion, each must be considered a personal monument to Luther North’s older brother. The crucial figure in them is not the Pawnees but Frank North.5 Basing their works on Luther North’s writings, later authors have echoed the claim that it was North’s leadership that turned the scouts into an effective fighting force. Typical of writers taking this view, George E. Hyde, in his classic study The Pawnee Indians (1951), criticized Pawnee leaders for past military failures and credited the remarkably successful\n\nintroduction\n\n5\n\nmilitary record of the Pawnee scouts entirely to Frank North and his staff of white officers. “One must admit that there was something wrong with the Pawnee leaders who went through one disastrous experience after another,” Hyde wrote, but under “the command of Frank North, his brother Luther North, and other white officers, these same Pawnee warriors—properly armed and led—were never defeated, and they won a number of handsome victories over their Sioux and Cheyenne enemies.”6 The actual contributions of the scouts have not received the same praise and attention as those of the North brothers.7 In this book I try to bring the experiences of the Pawnee scouts themselves to the foreground. I argue not only that the scouts remained distinctly Pawnee, but also that it was exactly their military qualities that made them such effective allies of the United States on the field of battle. The role played by Frank North and his officers was smaller than previously assumed. North may have been nominally in charge, but the tactics, style, and conduct of warfare were decidedly Pawnee. The difference with the past was that the scouts were now armed and mounted by the same government that had previously neglected to provide them with the means to defend themselves adequately. Besides focusing on the role of the scouts, I attempt to provide a comprehensive history of Pawnee military service in the 1860s and 1870s. Although I rely heavily on the accounts by Luther North and George Bird Grinnell, an ethnologist who knew the North brothers and spent years studying the Pawnees, Cheyennes, and other Plains tribes, I go beyond these to include other, less known accounts and events as well. Wherever possible, I try to correct the factual errors that plague the North and Grinnell accounts. Finally, I attempt to put the actions and behavior of the scouts, both on and off the battlefield, within the context of Pawnee cultural practices and customs. Focusing on the Pawnees, I have paid less attention to the viewpoints of their opponents, such as the Sioux and the Cheyennes. I treat warfare as a cultural construct. This means simply that different cultures fight wars and view warfare in different ways. When these dissimilar cultural traditions meet on the battlefield, the result is usually confusion, all too often followed by mutual accusations of violations of culturally accepted codes of war. Thus, in North America, both American\n\n6\n\nintroduction\n\nIndians and Euro-Americans soon accused each other of committing atrocities. Such accusations frequently led to retaliatory acts that could escalate and intensify conflicts. Europeans and Euro-Americans quickly denounced American Indian warfare as “savage” and used it to justify harsh military and political measures (such as removal of the Indians from their homelands to areas not yet inhabited by white people) as “punishment.” My purpose is not to pass moral value judgments on the ways each side conducted war. Instead, I seek to understand each culture on its own terms. I want to know why men acted on the field of battle in the way they did. The Pawnee way of war was different from the way the Americans fought battles. I believe it was because of their experience with Plains Indian warfare that the Pawnees made such efficient allies. For this reason I refer to them with terms such as “warriors” and “war party” that contrast with European and Euro-American concepts. Regrettably, these are racially charged terms that might be misconstrued to mean that Plains Indian warfare was less sophisticated than or inferior to American warfare. This is not my intention at all. I do not believe that the Western way of war was “superior” to American Indian warfare; it was merely different as a result of different cultural values, experiences, and technologies. I do not view terms such as “warriors” and “war party” in racially charged ways. Indeed, I prefer to use the term “war party” because it more adequately describes the temporary character and relatively fluid composition of typical Pawnee military field organizations. In the same way, the term “raid” (as opposed to the vaguer “expedition”) refers more accurately to the type of military tactic the Pawnees typically employed in war. It is a military term that describes a quick but intense surprise attack by a relatively small military unit deep into enemy territory. By the same token, I believe the term “warrior” better expresses nineteenthcentury Pawnee cultural values than the term “soldier.” For lack of better alternatives, I have also found it difficult to avoid other racially charged terms such as “Indian,” “chiefs,” “village,” and “tribe.” Originally, I intended to provide the proper spellings of Pawnee names in the current orthography. This task proved impossible for two reasons. First, differences exist between the spellings and pronunciations of names as they were used by the Skiri Pawnees, the northernmost of the four Pawnee bands, and by members of the other three bands, known\n\nintroduction\n\n7\n\ncollectively as the South Band Pawnees. In many cases the band associations of the scouts were impossible to determine, and to give the proper spellings in both Skiri and South Band Pawnee was impractical. Second, it is often difficult to ascertain the exact meaning of a name, because mustering officers and other eyewitnesses who left accounts gave very imperfect spellings of Pawnee names. Providing all possible translations of names would have considerably lengthened the manuscript and unnecessarily interrupted the narrative. The research for this book was based on extensive study of primary, secondary, and archival sources as well as field trips to the various sites where the Pawnee scouts were stationed or battled with their enemies. Among the sites I visited in Nebraska were Fort Kearny, Fort McPherson, Sidney Barracks, Fort Robinson, the Plum Creek battlefield near presentday Lexington, Massacre Canyon, the old Pawnee Agency at Genoa, and the Columbus Cemetery, where many of the officers of the battalion are buried. Field trips to Wyoming included visits to Fort Laramie, Fort Fetterman, Fort Reno, the Connor battlefield, and the Dull Knife battle site. I also spent one day visiting the Summit Springs battlefield near present-day Sterling in northeastern Colorado. The story of the Pawnee scouts is a tale of triumphs as well as tragedies. Although it is true that they helped to conquer the resisting tribes such as the Sioux, Cheyennes, and Arapahos, they did so because they perceived these tribes as a greater threat to the well-being of the Pawnee people than the mighty power that replaced them—the United States. Unfortunately, the United States government never properly honored the contributions of these men. Not only were many scouts denied pensions, but the government also insisted on eradicating Pawnee native culture. Despite this record of mistreatment by the U.S. government, the Pawnee people today take special pride in the service of their scout ancestors, whom they regard as the first Pawnee-American patriots.\n\nMajor battles and engagements involving Pawnee scouts, 1857–1876\n\n8\n\n9\n\nCHAPTER\n\n1\n\nPawnee Military Culture in the Mid-1800s\n\nShortly after the birth of Lone Chief, around 1850, his father, a Kitkahahki Pawnee chief, died. Lone Chief’s mother took up the responsibility for instructing her son in becoming a successful and important man in the tribe. Among the things she taught him as a child was the following lesson: You must trust always in Ti-ra’-wa. He made us, and through him we live. When you grow up, you must be a man. Be brave, and face whatever danger may meet you. . . . Your father was a chief, but you must not think of that. Because he was a chief, it does not follow that you will be one. It is not the man who stays in the lodge that becomes great; it is the man who works, who sweats, who is always tired from going on the warpath. When you get to be a man, remember that it is his ambition that makes the man. If you go on the warpath, do not turn around when you have gone part way, but go on as far as you were going, and then come back. If I should live to see you become a man, I want you to become a great man. I want you to think about the hard times we have been through. Take pity on people who are poor, because we have been poor, and people have taken pity on us. If I live to see you a man, and to go off on the warpath, I would not cry if I were to hear that you had been killed in battle. That is what makes a man: to fight and to be brave. I should be sorry to see you die from sickness. If you are killed, I would rather have you die in the open air, so that the birds of the air will eat your flesh, and the wind will breathe on you and blow over your bones. It is better to be killed in the open air than to be smothered in the earth. Love\n\n11\n\n12\n\nwar party in blue your friend and never desert him. If you see him surrounded by the enemy, do not run away. Go to him, and if you cannot save him, be killed together, and let your bones lie side by side. Be killed on a hill; high up. Your grandfather said it is not manly to be killed in a hollow. It is not a man who is talking to you, advising you. Heed my words, even if I am a woman.1\n\nThis story, recorded by ethnologist George Bird Grinnell in the 1880s, sums up some Pawnee attitudes toward warfare. Only successful men could become prominent members of Pawnee society. In order to be successful, a man had always to put his faith in the sacred powers, without whose supernatural assistance he was destined to fail. Manhood was defined in terms of ambition, hard work, bravery, generosity toward the poor, and loyalty toward friends. One way for a man to satisfy his ambitions was to go to war. Should death come to him while he displayed these virtues on the battlefield, he died with honor, and this honor would then be bestowed on his family. These were the attitudes the Pawnees carried into battle as scouts for the United States Army. Lone Chief, the boy to whom the preceding words were directed, enlisted in the Pawnee battalion in 1867. He distinguished himself in battle against the Arapahos while serving in Luther North’s company.2 To understand the attitudes, behavior, and tactics of the Pawnee scouts, it is necessary to understand the role of warfare in Pawnee society and culture in the mid-nineteenth century. In this chapter I describe the character of what ethnologist Marian W. Smith called the “war complex” of the Pawnees. I explain why the Pawnee scouts were such effective allies of the United States Army and why the Pawnees formed an alliance with the United States and assisted the army as scouts in the first place. My emphasis is on the nineteenth century, by which time the Pawnees had fully incorporated horses and guns into their military organization.3 Because this chapter is focused solely on Pawnee martial values, it may leave the impression that Pawnee culture was highly militaristic. Such an impression would be false. In reality, Pawnee men identified themselves in many different ways: as hunters and providers, doctors, philosophers, teachers, artists and craftsmen, husbands and family men, workers, political leaders, and religious officials. After work, most men enjoyed visiting\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n13\n\nfriends and relatives and attending religious ceremonies or social events and dances. They took part in meetings of one of the men’s societies, where they sang songs, challenged each other to games of chance, exchanged stories, and discussed town politics. Pawnee culture was exceptionally rich and offered Pawnee men many ways to express themselves. Warfare was only one aspect of Pawnee life in the mid-nineteenth century, and community expectations of men extended far beyond military matters. Around 1800, the four bands that composed the Pawnee confederacy— the Skiri, Chawi, Kitkahahki, and Pitahawirata bands—occupied a territory along the Platte, Loup, and Republican Rivers in present-day Nebraska and north-central Kansas. They lived in semipermanent towns of dirtcovered lodges. Their economy was based on corn horticulture supplemented by hunting and gathering. During the summer, while their crops matured, the Pawnees left their earth-lodge towns for several months and traveled west in search of buffalo. During this time they camped in buffalo-skin-covered tepees. The four bands of the tribe were socially and politically autonomous. Indeed, until the late 1700s it is perhaps more accurate to view the northernmost group, the Skiris, as a tribe entirely separate from the three “South Band” Pawnee groups. Still, the four bands shared many of the same basic cultural values and practices.4 Religion played a major role in the daily lives of the Pawnee people and formed the basis for their social and political organization. The Pawnees did not clearly distinguish between a “natural” and a “supernatural” world. The “supernatural” was simply part of the natural world. According to Pawnee theology, Tiiraawaahat (“This Expanse” or “The Heavens”) had created the universe, the Earth, and everything that existed, both living and nonliving. He was addressed as “father” in prayers and ceremonies. Ranking below him were stars and other celestial objects. Most prominent of these were Evening Star, a female power, and Morning Star, a male power. Morning Star was usually portrayed as a warrior and presented the ideal for any Pawnee man. These celestial powers protected the tribe, band, or town against disease, starvation, and poverty. The power of the celestial beings was represented in so-called sacred bundles called cu’uhre re ipi ru’ (“rainstorm wrapped up”). Priests were responsible for conducting ceremonies to maintain the covenant with the celestial powers.\n\n14\n\nwar party in blue\n\nMeanwhile, the head chief of a band, town, or village was usually a descendant of the original bundle owner. The positions of priest and band or village chief were hereditary.5 The Pawnees also recognized terrestrial powers, manifested in the form of animal benefactors or guardians. The animals appeared to individuals in dreams or visions and instructed the visionary to make a sacred bundle. These personal bundles were called karu su’ (“sack”). Such bundles and the songs and rituals that accompanied them could be sold to others. Although less powerful than the sky powers, the animal guardians granted individual Pawnees power and fortitude in hunting, doctoring, and warfare. The power bestowed by one of the animal benefactors enabled ordinary people to become doctors and warriors and to accumulate wealth and status in the community. A successful warrior might eventually be raised to the position of subchief and take a seat in the town or village council. Not surprisingly, ordinary Pawnees spent considerable time and effort in acquiring spiritual power. A man could attain status in Pawnee society in different ways. Doctoring and hunting were both considered important—if not essential—honorable, and noteworthy. Men sought to perfect their skills in these endeavors by obtaining the blessings of the sacred powers. Another way to attain wealth and status was to go to war. A Pawnee man had plenty of opportunities to do so. By the mid-1700s the Pawnees were surrounded by other tribes. To the east were the Omahas, Iowas, Otoes, and Missourias. To the south were the Kaws, Osages, Kiowas, Comanches, and Plains Apaches. To the west were the Arapahos and the mighty Cheyennes, and to the north were the Poncas and the powerful Lakotas, or Western Sioux. The Pawnees’ relations with these tribes were complex. Their interactions with the other sedentary tribes (Omahas, Iowas, Otoes, Missourias, Kaws, and Poncas) fluctuated between war and peace, as did their relations with the more nomadic Kiowas and Comanches. But Pawnee relations with the Sioux and Cheyennes appear to have been poor from the beginning. Certainly by the 1830s, the Sioux and Cheyennes had become the most fearsome enemies of the Pawnees. The Pawnees called the Sioux paahíksukat, and the Cheyennes, sáhi. Pawnee men went to war for a variety of reasons: to defend their home territory against invaders, to protect their hunting grounds, to avenge\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n15\n\nthe deaths of relatives, to end the mourning period for deceased loved ones, to gain prestige by accumulating war honors, to accumulate wealth (primarily in horses), to gain social status by giving away the spoils of war, to protect tribal trade interests, to capture (or recapture) women and children, to take scalps, which they sacrificed in honor of the sacred powers, and to prove their readiness to be married.6 It is unclear exactly when this particular martial culture developed, but it has roots stretching back to earlier, perhaps even ancient, times. There is little doubt, however, that when new tribes appeared on the Great Plains, having been drawn there from the east as a result of opportunities afforded by horses and guns and pushed there through displacement by Europeans and later Euro-Americans, warfare between the Pawnees and these newcomers broke out and quickly escalated. The immigrant tribes competed with the Pawnees for increasingly scarce natural resources, especially buffalo. Pawnee scholar Roger C. Echo-Hawk believes that Pawnee martial culture intensified in response to Sioux and Cheyenne pressures in the nineteenth century. By the 1830s, warfare had become a reality of life for the Pawnees. It was even sanctioned by their religion.7 Warfare with the Sioux and Cheyennes was both defensive and offensive. Two forms of offensive warfare can be distinguished: expeditions in search of horses and loot and expeditions to kill and destroy the enemy. Even though participants in the former of these often sought to avoid battle, it was considered an act of war. The latter was more “noteworthy”— that is, it was recognized by the sacred powers. Such expeditions were ceremonial undertakings and involved elaborate ceremonial preparations, such as the opening of a sacred bundle. The act of going on such a dangerous mission could be regarded as a ceremonial act in itself. Like most other Pawnee ceremonies, it involved a sacrifice. In this case, the sacrifice came in the form of the killing of an enemy. If the expedition was unsuccessful, the Pawnee warrior or warriors themselves might end up being the sacrificial victims. If it was successful, the ceremony was not over until the warriors returned home, shared their victory with the people there, and returned the war insignia to the sacred bundles. Considering the importance of warfare in Pawnee culture, it is not surprising that Pawnees boys were prepared from an early age to follow the path of the warrior. They were told not to fear death and that it was\n\n16\n\nwar party in blue\n\nbetter to die bravely when young than to live to an enfeebled old age.8 “For those of us that are men it is unworthy to be buried in a regular grave,” Effie Blaine’s father, a Pitahawirata headman, told her. “It is far better to lie in the open and be eaten by the birds.” For this reason Pawnee families welcomed the birth of a son with a mixture of joy and sadness.9 When a young man reached an “age of realization” that his fate was not in his own hands but in those of the sacred powers, he would walk around the town singing, “My spirit rests in the belief that power is in the heavens.”10 This song signified his readiness to go on the warpath and his willingness to give up his life in the defense of his people. Declaring himself no longer afraid of death, he could now pursue the goal of becoming a brave warrior. Of course, declaring oneself brave did not necessarily make one so; the real test remained in facing the enemy in battle. Bravery was the most highly regarded virtue in a Pawnee warrior. According to John Brown Dunbar, son of a Presbyterian missionary to the Pawnees, it determined a person’s status in the afterlife. The Pawnees believed that the spirit of the deceased had to follow a dangerous path beneath falling arrows and cross a deep chasm on a small log. Only the brave passed over this dangerous route to a new country of peace and plenty. Cowardly spirits chose a path free of danger but strewn with hoes, axes, and other implements of labor, indicating that they would spend the afterlife in “an existence of endless toil and servitude.”11 Ethnomusicologist Frances Densmore recorded a Pawnee song that told how, should a person die in battle, the spirits would welcome him to the spirit world and talk of all his great deeds: Aheru raa heru kitu tix wahe he weta axrau isirit ra tawe (“Beloved, come, Beloved, All the spirits spoke. Here he comes. It is openly known that he did these generous things.”)12 Warriors carried songs like these into battle because they gave them comfort on dangerous missions. Although men did not actively seek to die in battle, the songs reminded them that they should not fear death.13 Apart from learning to place their fate in the hands of the sacred powers, Pawnee boys learned practical skills that were necessary attributes for a warrior. Among these skills were horsemanship, endurance, stealth, and the manufacture, repair, and maintenance of weapons.\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n17\n\n“The Pawnees are expert horsemen,” wrote visitor Edwin James in 1820, “and [they] delight in the exhibition of feats of skill and adroitness.”14 Like most other Plains tribes, the Pawnees considered horses great “medicine.” Their power allowed a man to outrun the buffalo during the hunt or to make deep forays into enemy territory. The Pawnee term for horse is aruúsa’. Another common term is asaa-, followed by a descriptive term. Thus, asaataáka means “white horse,” asaakaatit, “black horse,” and so forth. The Pawnees obtained the horse in the late seventeenth century. The animal had such a powerful effect on them that they believed it was a gift from Tiiraawaahat to the people.15 Pawnee warriors often painted and decorated their war horses before going on a war party. The decorations usually represented a higher power that would give the horse strength, endurance, speed, and fearlessness in battle. For example, Echo Hawk, a Pawnee scout, always painted his horse’s head with white clay to symbolize an eagle. On his pony’s chest was a beaded rosette depicting the skull of an eagle.16 According to Luther North, one of the officers in the Pawnee battalion, the Pawnees also painted their horses to make them less conspicuous targets and disorient the enemy. Conversely, warriors sometimes fastened colored feathers in the tails and manes of their horses. Warriors might spend several hours preparing themselves and their horses in anticipation of a fight.17 Pawnee children learned to handle and care for horses at a young age. When John Treat Irving, who accompanied a U.S. peace commission in 1833, entered a Pawnee town he saw small bands of young men amusing themselves by racing their horses at full speed while attempting to throw each other from their saddles by violently steering their animals into each other. “There is nothing upon which the Indians pride themselves, more than their horsemanship,” Irving wrote. “They are as much at ease, when mounted, as when sitting upon the floor of their own lodge.”18 Indian horses were generally better acclimatized to the harsh conditions of the plains than U.S. Cavalry horses. Unlike grain-fed cavalry mounts, which usually required large quantities of feed that had to be carried along in wagons, Indian ponies subsisted primarily on grass. Although usually smaller and therefore slower than cavalry horses, they had greater endurance. George H. Holliday, who served alongside the Pawnee scouts in 1865, wrote that Indian ponies were “better calculated\n\n18\n\nwar party in blue\n\nfor the use of cavalry on the plains than ‘Americano’ horses.” According to Holliday, Indian horses could “travel a greater distance and carry a load in a day, or week, or all the time, for that matter, and do it on less rations than any other living animal.”19 Pawnee warriors also had an array of “horse medicines” at their disposal. They applied boiled parts of the “sticky head” plant (Grindelia squarrosa) to treat saddle galls and sores and fed the bulbs of sheep sorrel (Oxalis violacea) to horses “to make them more fleet.” They blew dried and powdered meadow rue (Thalictrum dasycarpum) into a horse’s nostrils to increase its endurance “when obliged to make forced marches of three or four days’ duration in order to escape from enemies.”20 Just as they did horses, the Pawnees often endowed guns with supernatural power to improve their effectiveness. The Pawnees were successful exploiters of imported technologies. After adopting the gun, they applied to it the name they used for the bow and arrows, tíraaku’, and used the diminutive form, tíraakis, for the bow. The English traveler Charles Augustus Murray wrote in the 1830s that the Pawnees also called the gun “medicine-weapon.” To make guns work more efficiently (for example, to avoid misfires), the Pawnees believed they needed the blessing of the supernatural beings. The successful use of these weapons often depended more on an individual’s “medicine” than on his ability as a marksman. Hence, many warriors had special ceremonials with which they prepared their guns for battle. But just as good spirits helped bullets to find their way, so angry or aggrieved spirits could sabotage a weapon. One such spirit caused the Pawnees much grief in the 1830s. This was the spirit of a young Skiri warrior who had been killed during a Sioux raid. The animal spirits took pity on him and breathed new life into him. His spirit then returned to his people and warned them whenever the Sioux came to attack them. But when the Skiris began to ignore him, he turned against them and began aiding the Sioux instead. The Skiris believed that the angry spirit “caused their guns to flash in the pan and the bullets to roll harmlessly from the muzzles.” They also thought this spirit broke their bow strings in battle.21 Despite the power of the gun, the Pawnees continued to rely heavily on other weapons such as the bow and arrows. Antoine Deshetres, a French\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n19\n\ntrader who toured the prairies with writer Washington Irving in 1832, believed that “the rifle of the white man was no match for the bow and arrow of the Pawnee.” On several occasions Deshetres watched Pawnee archers send their arrows through one buffalo into another. He also wrote that the Pawnees could shoot at their enemies while hanging from the horse’s side to shield their bodies, discharging their arrows from under the horse’s neck.22 This latter feat might have been more hyperbole than fact. Describing a Chawi warrior in 1835, Charles Murray observed that he carried a gun only for “show” and that he relied on his bow and arrows “when the chase-signal or the war-cry was given.”23 The Pawnees preferred a bow of bois d’arc, a type of wood that grew only on the southern plains. They obtained the wood through trade with the closely related Wichitas, who lived in that area. Pawnee warriors always kept a supply of bois d’arc sticks in their lodges with which to make new bows when their old ones gave out.24 “As soon as the boys are able to run about,” wrote Murray in 1835, “they begin to practice the bow and arrow, [and at] the age of twenty they are allowed to hunt, and seek other opportunities for distinction.”25 Grandfathers usually instructed young boys in the manufacture and use of the bow and arrows.26 Pawnee boys perfected their skills in the use of arms through games. In the arrow game, one player shot his arrow into the ground between forty and sixty paces away. The other players then shot their arrows as close as possible to the main arrow. The player who lodged his arrow closest won and could claim all the arrows discharged. Another game was a hoop and stick game called stuts-au’-i-ka-tus, in which the players threw a lancelike stick at a rawhide hoop. These games perfected hand-eye coordination as well as the use of spears and bows and arrows.27 It is uncertain whether the Pawnees poisoned their arrows, although they were familiar with the poisonous properties of certain plants such as “snow on the mountain” (Dichrophyllum marginatum).28 Complementing a warrior’s arsenal were a battle ax, a war club, a spear, a shield, and usually one or more knives.29 According to Edwin James, the circular shield of bison skin was thick enough to ward off an arrow. Such shields offered protection only if they had undergone some kind of ceremonial treatment. Shield covers were often decorated with\n\n20\n\nwar party in blue\n\nfantastic designs that symbolized their sacred properties. “Defended by this shield,” James wrote, “a warrior will not hesitate to cross the path of an arrow; he will sometimes dexterously seize the missile after it has struck, and discharge it back again at the enemy.” Only distinguished warriors were allowed to display their weapons on a special rack in front of their lodge.30 But as the quality and performance of guns improved, most traditional weapons were discarded or obtained a ceremonial function only. Nevertheless, most of the Pawnees who served in the U.S. Army continued to carry one or more traditional weapons with them.31 Physical and mental endurance were also highly valued martial virtues. Pawnee runners had a reputation as remarkable athletes who could travel more than one hundred miles in less than twenty-four hours, without food or sleep. The Reverend John Dunbar, who joined the Pawnees on many travels, recorded many instances in which they went without food for several days without a noticeable effect. They merely wrapped a thong several times tightly around the waist “to still the gnawings of hunger.”32 Charles Murray observed how Pawnee warriors chewed on lead bullets, claiming that it “excites the saliva, and relieves the pains of thirst.” Murray said that he himself “more than once used one of my own rifle balls for this purpose, and have experienced much relief from so doing.”33 Every warrior who entered battle did so only after obtaining the protection of the supernatural. This protection was crucial; without it no man, regardless of his skills and personal strength, could achieve success.34 The Pawnees believed that at birth, each person came under the influence of an animal spirit.35 Some of these spirits gave the individual the power to cure certain illnesses, but they could also provide a warrior with good fortune in battle. Pawnee animal symbolism was complex and used in many and various ways. In warfare, animal spirits could symbolize certain martial traits. For example, wolf symbolism represented stealth and craft, the eagle represented courage and fierceness, and the bear symbolized invulnerability.36 Once a spirit had revealed itself, the Pawnee warrior tried to master its powers. Usually this meant that he had to learn the proper procedures for renewing and handling personal medicine bundles and amulets.37 He also had to observe certain taboos, one of which was to prevent menstruating women from handling the sacred\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n21\n\nobjects. The attire of each warrior included symbolic representations of these supernatural powers. Some wore bird feathers, bear claws, or other prepared animal parts. Many warriors attached a piece of corn, which represented the power of life, to their clothes.38 Warriors kept animal skins, bones, claws, rocks, paints, and other representations of the supernatural in small personal medicine bundles, which they carried into battle for protection and success. Captain J. Lee Humfreville, who met the Pawnee scouts during the Powder River campaign in 1865, wrote that “no Pawnee warrior would think of going into battle or on a hunt without it.” The bundle, according to Humfreville, was a warrior’s “great protection under all circumstances.”39 The bundles also contained herbs and other medicines to treat wounds. Puffballs (Lycoperdon perlatum), for example, were used as a styptic for wounds. Each warrior had his own special medicines. Often these had been revealed to him in dreams or visions.40 A Pawnee warrior generally joined one of the men’s societies. Although many of these fraternal orders had a certain recreational character, they also served specific public functions. Special organizations were the various doctors’ societies, which were composed of men who had obtained sacred power (usually from an animal protector) that enabled them to cure certain diseases. Some acted as a tribal police force during the annual buffalo hunt. Among the Skiri Pawnees, the nonmedicine societies served military purposes. For example, they took on the defense of the town during enemy attacks.41 Two types of nonmedicine societies existed among the Pawnees. The first consisted of the prestigious “lance societies,” which were associated with the tribal bundles. Only warriors with distinguished records of achievement were allowed to become members. Once a candidate passed the requirements of the fraternity, he became a member for life. Men could join several orders. Each society had its own origin myth, lodge, ceremonies, dances, songs, dress, paint code, and special objects. The ceremonial life of an order usually revolved around a special lance. Each year these lances were symbolically “renewed” (to restore their powers) in a special springtime ceremony. Often the lance represented or symbolized a specific martial quality. The lance of the Thunderbird\n\n22\n\nwar party in blue\n\nLance society, for example, had a point of flint, a stone that represented thunder or the power to strike an enemy before he was aware of danger. The lances were not normally taken on expeditions but were used only for defensive purposes. Sometimes during battle, a warrior would plant a lance before the enemy and tie himself to it. This symbolized his determination to stand and fight until death. He could be relieved only by another warrior who, in order to save the lance, carried it away.42 Like the standards and colors of modern armies, lances were rallying points for the members of a lance society and served to inspire its warriors. One is reminded of the words of the European tactician Maurice de Saxe, who wrote in 1732 that soldiers should never abandon their standard: “It should be sacred to them; it should be respected; and every type of ceremony should be used to make [it] respected and precious.”43 To the Pawnees, the military society lances performed exactly this role. Less accomplished warriors were organized into private societies, which constituted the second category of military society. These orders were usually formed by ambitious young men and operated in a manner similar to that of the lance societies. They, too, had their own origin myths, sacred bundles, dances, dress and paint codes, ceremonies, insignia, and objects. Unlike the lance societies, however, they lacked the official sanction of one of the tribal sacred bundles. A private society was usually created by a man who had been instructed to do so in a dream or vision. The supernatural power in the vision promised success and protection to the visionary’s followers. Unlike the established orders, the private organizations were more offensive-minded. Their members often went to war in search of horses, scalps, and war honors, or “coups.” Some distinguished themselves through their “reckless” behavior in battle. Members of the Crazy Dog society, for example, sometimes “staked” themselves to the battlefield, signaling their determination to fight until death. The “Children of the Iruska” were so-called “contraries,” who behaved opposite to their spoken words. For example, they entered a fight only when told not to. Despite this peculiar behavior, they were among the most aggressive fighters. These societies often competed with each other for the highest military honors. Some, such as the Young Dog and the Mischievous societies, were very successful and highly respected by the other members of the tribe. A few\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n23\n\nsocieties disappeared when they were annihilated in battle, their members preferring to perish rather than abandon their society brothers.44 When old enough, young men were invited to join one of the military societies. There they received instruction in the art of war. Members prepared for war through drills, sham battles, and other military exercises. The emphasis was on tactics, both defensive and offensive. Societies resembled the company system of modern-day armies. They had their own officers and command structure. Their purpose was, apart from drills and tactics, to instill a sense of brotherhood among their members. For this reason each society had its own regalia, songs, and rituals. The bond between members was often so strong that not infrequently warriors sacrificed their lives to save those of their comrades.45 It appears that when the Pawnee battalion was organized, this society system continued to operate. Not only were scout companies constituted according to band affiliation (Skiri, Chawi, Kitkahahki, or Pitahawirata), but specially assigned platoons were often composed of members of a specific fraternal order. Although most war parties consisted of members of a specific society, this did not have to be the case. Noted warriors often drew followers from various societies and sometimes even from different bands. Usually the leader of a party had no difficulty recruiting men, but sometimes he organized a special war dance for this purpose. Depending on whether the purpose was to steal horses or take scalps, war parties varied in size from a single man to several hundred warriors. Horse-stealing parties were usually small, to avoid detection. Expeditions in search of scalps were usually larger and could be composed of several warrior societies under the leadership of an elected chief. The contingent of Kitkahahki warriors that surrounded an advance party belonging to Major Stephen Long’s western expedition in 1819 numbered about 130 to 140 men.46 Plains Indian warfare has often been characterized as undisciplined and disorganized. In reality, Plains Indians usually spent a lot of time preparing for battle, and the Pawnees were no exception. While on expeditions, Pawnees also maintained discipline rigorously. Discipline was essential in both the hunt and war. According to John Brown Dunbar, chiefs on occasion had taken a life in order to secure obedience. A person “persisting in willful insubordination was pretty sure of at least a sound beating.”47 Before setting out on a military expedition, according\n\n24\n\nwar party in blue\n\nto Dunbar, Pawnee warriors spent much time practicing maneuvers. They fought mock battles in which they deployed and reassembled troops. Supervising these maneuvers was the leader of the party, who observed the movements of his men from an elevated position. From his vantage point he also gave signals and directions to the warriors.48 After the acquisition of the horse in the late seventeenth century, the Pawnees largely abandoned pitched-battle and formation warfare in favor of raids—usually small-scale, lightly armed incursions deep into enemy territory. Their purpose was to catch the enemy off guard, strike quickly, and retreat before the enemy could reorganize and launch a counterattack. The Pawnees perfected the raid and distinguished between expeditions in search of horses and expeditions in search of scalps.49 During the eighteenth century, horse-raiding expeditions became more common than expeditions in search of enemy scalps. Pawnee horse-raiding parties were small (from one to perhaps thirteen men) and usually made their forays into hostile territory on foot in order to escape detection. They sometimes walked for hundreds of miles and ventured as far as Wyoming and Texas. According to some observers, war parties went on foot as a show of their determination to return on horseback. According to Dunbar, such expeditions also had some strategic advantages: “Movements on foot, though not so swift for a sudden dash, could be kept more secret and unerring, [and] in case of a hard struggle . . . they could not then be so easily stampeded, and all developments could be kept better in hand.”50 Warriors on foot often carried extra sets of moccasins, usually filled with so-called corn balls, made of a mixture of corn flour, dried and pulverized beef, dried fruits, and buffalo fat. Loaded with calories, these balls were the MREs (“Meals Ready to Eat”) of the Plains Indian warrior. After locating the enemy, the horse raiders usually held a small ceremony to appeal once again to the supernatural powers for success. After the ceremony, the warriors discussed a plan of attack. If the enemy camp was large, they would make a stealthy attack during the night or at dawn to drive off the horses. A few selected men, usually those designated as scouts and “soldiers,” approached the herds quietly on foot, then tried to stampede the animals in the direction of the other party members. Sometimes they screamed and shouted to get the horses moving. Josiah\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n25\n\nGregg, a merchant who traveled the Santa Fe Trail in the 1830s and 1840s, claimed that the Pawnees also used a peculiar whistle to stampede the horses.51 Although less common than horse raids, expeditions designed to attack and kill the enemy involved more elaborate ceremonial preparations. Such expeditions were often composed of members of different military societies who, for this occasion, temporarily formed new societies, called araris taka (“white wolf societies”). In Pawnee cosmology, the wolf symbolized the god of war (the Morning Star). The Skiri Pawnees, or “Wolf” Indians, adopted this animal as their tribal emblem because of its “intelligence, vigilance, and well known powers of endurance.” The wolf had the power to steal up on an enemy and get away without being discovered. Hence, the Pawnees always sought the power of the wolf when they went on the warpath.52 Before the war party set out, its leader had to obtain this power for his men. He would go to the village bundle keeper and ask for a number of articles from the bundle that were related to the specific powers of the wolf. A four-day ceremony followed in which the warriors sought the sanction of the supernatural. The party carried these objects with them on the warpath in a special war bundle.53 According to James R. Murie, an ethnographer and the son of an officer of the Pawnee battalion, the warriors set out on their mission in two columns. Each line had a leader, two scouts, two “soldiers,” the warriors, and some assistants. The scouts surveyed the area in front and on the flanks of the expedition and reported their findings to the leaders. The exact task of the “soldiers” is unclear, but it is possible that they led the warriors like modern-day company sergeants. They also made sure that no man wandered off by himself in search of individual war honors, thereby endangering the entire party. The assistants were inexperienced young men on their first expedition. They usually stayed in the back and learned the art of warfare by observing the more experienced members. All were painted heavily with white clay to imitate the wolf. The scouts also wore wolf-skin caps or white eagle feathers arranged in their hair to resemble a wolf’s ears. According to Murie, the idea was that as they looked over the crest of a hill, they would appear to be wolves rather than spying men.54 Yet by adopting wolf power, a warrior in fact “became” a\n\n26\n\nwar party in blue\n\nwolf. He received wolf power not simply by putting on a wolf skin or applying white clay; it was the ceremonial appeal to the sacred bundle that enabled him to be a wolf.55 As soon as the scouts discovered an enemy camp, they reported their findings to the war party leader, who called a council to discuss the plan of attack and conduct another ceremony in which he appealed to the sacred powers. The warriors prepared for the attack by removing all superfluous clothing and applying face paint. The leader of the expedition did not necessarily participate in this attack but frequently directed the campaign from a strategic location. He usually remained behind to guard the war bundle. Overlooking the battlefield, he sent scouts to convey his orders or signaled the warriors from his position.56 Western explorer James Ohio Pattie wrote about this particular tactic in 1824: “Their commander stations himself in the rear of his warriors, seldom taking part in the battle, unless he should be himself attacked, which is not often the case. They show no inconsiderable military stratagem in their marches, keeping spies before and behind, and on each flank, at the distance of a few days travel; so that in their open country, it is almost impossible to come upon them by surprise.”57 Surprise was of the utmost importance during such attacks. For this reason the Pawnees preferred to attack at dawn, when the unsuspecting enemy was least able to organize quickly. If they succeeded in surprising an enemy, the death toll could become high. In warfare, the Pawnees neither gave nor expected to be given quarter, although women and children were sometimes spared and taken back to the war party’s town, where they could be adopted into the tribe. When caught in a desperate situation, Plains Indian warriors such as the Pawnees preferred to fight to the death rather than risk the humiliation of capture and death by torture. Like most other Plains tribes, the Pawnees took scalps (paksíckuusu’, literally, “head peeling”). Scalps were more than mere trophies or evidence of military prowess. Contrary to what is sometimes believed, scalps represented not a person’s soul, which the Pawnees considered immortal and which would, after death, rise to the “village in the sky,” but rather his life force. By scalping an enemy the Pawnees took away this life force and, after some ritual treatment, could use it to their own spiritual advantage. For this reason the Pawnees included scalps in their sacred bundles,\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n27\n\nplaced them in or over the graves of loved ones, decorated shirts and other garments with them, gave them to people in mourning to “wipe away their tears,” presented them to friends, and sacrificed them as burnt offerings to the sacred powers. According to Murie, the sacrifice of a scalp was one of the most important acts in the life of a warrior. It served to reaffirm the people’s relationship with the sacred powers and ensured the vitality and well-being of the tribe. The Pawnees also believed that a person who had been scalped but “survived” was no longer really human and therefore could not live among them anymore.58 The Pawnees also took trophies in battle. In the 1830s, Maximilian, Prince of Wied, observed a Pawnee warrior who wore a valuable Sioux headdress into battle. He had taken it from a distinguished Sioux chief and wore it to taunt and challenge his enemies. This warrior took considerable risks, because the Sioux, recognizing the headdress of their deceased comrade, made great efforts to kill him. Clearly, the Pawnee must have been extremely confident, because he intentionally solicited the wrath of the Sioux.59 Horses, scalps, and plunder were not the only objects of desire. Warriors also sought to earn war honors, so-called coups, in battle.60 Although some historians and anthropologists believe that Plains Indian warfare was first and foremost a struggle between tribes over economic resources and political power, war honors reflected the individual performance of a warrior in battle. Such war honors were important because they allowed a successful warrior to recruit men for future expeditions. The crucial measure of his success and prowess was the number of coups he had counted on his enemies. In order to lead future war parties and thus receive a larger part of their spoils, warriors hoped to obtain as many coups as possible. Such acts would win them great prestige. The Pawnees recognized several deeds that counted as war honors. All of them required great bravery and skill. Among these were capturing enemy horses, taking an enemy’s scalp or gun in battle, and taking an enemy prisoner. Among the highest honors was to count coup on an enemy in battle. The word “coup,” French for “strike” or “blow,” refers to the hitting or touching of an enemy in battle. Unlike killing an enemy from a distance with gun or bow, the act of touching the enemy required that a warrior approach his foe and engage in more dangerous\n\n28\n\nwar party in blue\n\nhand-to-hand combat. The honor counted even when the enemy was already dead.61 Although this last act might not seem daring at first glance, Colonel Philip St. George Cooke, who knew the Pawnees personally, explained that a wounded or dead enemy was still dangerous to approach because his friends were usually nearby. Indeed, Cooke claimed that warriors sometimes pretended to be dead in order to draw an enemy close and kill him.62 After a successful raid or attack, the warriors immediately retreated with their plunder, riding continuously for two or three days without sleep or food. Once out of reach of their pursuers, they camped in a secure place. Some members went to hunt and brought back meat to be sacrificed in a thanksgiving ceremony. Two men, selected by the leader, divided the spoils of war among the men according to their rank. After the spoils were divided, it was time for a name-changing ceremony.63 According to Pawnee belief, a man was entitled to change his name whenever he performed an act of great significance in war or some other endeavor, such as when a boy killed and consecrated his first buffalo. This custom rested on the idea that life developed in certain stages. Some men rose only a little way along the developmental path, but men who sought the favor of the gods could “climb up” through deeds that indicated great ability or strength of character. Success in battle, such as counting coup on an enemy, was among these accomplishments. By discarding his old name and adopting a new one, a warrior announced that he had reached a new level in the path of life. This process involved a name-changing ceremony, during which the man recounted his deed publicly and in the presence of a priest. Among the Chawi, Kitkahahkis, and Pitahawiratas, the ceremony consisted of reciting a lengthy poem that explained the origin of the custom and related the way the gods took pity on the man and gave him the power to perform the deed. The recital, reproduced here as recorded by Alice C. Fletcher, ended with the disposal of the old name and adoption of the new one: Ra-wa! Ha-wa u-ra-sha-ru we tat-ki-wa-ti. Hi-ri! Ta-tux ta-pa-ki-a-ho, ha-wa, Ra-ruts-ka-tit! Hi-ri! Ra-ro rik-cha ro re Hi-ri! A-ki-ta-ro hi-wa we-ra-ta-we-ko. Hi-ri! Sha-ku’-ru Wa’-ruk-ste. Hi-ri-wa wi-ti ra-ka-wa-ka-ru ko re. (Attend! Once more I change his name.\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n29\n\nHarken! Ri-ruts’-ka-tit it was we used to call him by, a name he won long days ago, marking an act well done by him, but now passed by. Harken! Today all men shall say— Harken! His act has lifted him. Where all his tribe behold a man. Clothed with new fame, strong in new strength, gained by his deeds, blessed of the gods. Harken! Sha-ku’-ru Wa’-ruk-ste shall he be called.)64 After the name-changing ceremony and sufficient rest, the warriors set out for home. According to Murie, they regularly set the prairie grass on fire from a distance, to announce to the towns their return. They also painted their faces black or covered their white face paint with black dots.65 Pawnee men composed songs commemorating their victories in battle. After witnessing an attack by a Cheyenne war party on a Pawnee hunting camp in 1835, Charles Murray heard a Pawnee by the name of Black Wolf sing his victory song: I rushed upon my enemy like a buffalo! I shouted my war cry aloud! Hi-hi-hi-hi-hi!&c. I took his scalp! His women howl for him in their lodge! I am a great war-chief! I am called the Black Wolf! Hi-hi-hi-hi!66 The torture of enemy captives was not uncommon among the Pawnees. Usually it was the prerogative of the women in the town. Returning war parties presented captives to the town’s women’s society, which usually consisted of single women and widows. During the four-day ceremony, the women wore mock war bonnets made of corn husks instead of feathers and carried crude representations of weapons. They made a fire in front of the prisoner and humiliated and tortured him in any conceivable way. According to Murie, women would urinate in bowls and force the captive to drink. Others took up coals of fire with which they scorched the victim’s skin. Usually the torture ended with the death of the captive.67 All this time the war party was formally still in operation, allowing women and other members of the tribe to share in the glory of the expedition. It did not end until a “homecoming” ceremony had been conducted.\n\n30\n\nwar party in blue\n\nIn this ceremony, which took place after a long interval, the leader of the war party returned the objects from the war bundle to the original bundle keeper. The members of the party also presented the bundle keeper with gifts such as horses.68 The Pawnees had a number of dances that are usually grouped under the label “war dances.” Some of them provided individual warriors with a stage on which to display their bravery. They also allowed the Pawnees to impress guests with the military prowess of the tribe. In the early 1830s, Philip St. George Cooke attended a Pawnee war dance at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Each time a dancer moved into the dance circle to recount a coup, he placed a small gift before the chief, who, according to Cooke, acted as a judge and rewarded the bravest deed.69 Warriors not only tried to impress visitors with war dances but also displayed their deeds on buffalo robe paintings. “The story of a battle is often depicted in this way,” wrote Edwin James in 1820, “and the robe of a warrior is frequently decorated with the narration, in pictures, of some of his exploits.” Warriors frequently gave such pictorial records away so that their fame might be carried with the gift.70 A warrior who died in the defense of his town or for the greater glory of his tribe received a funeral with all the splendor his sacrifice deserved. After clothing him in his finest garments, a priest covered the body and face with a mixture of sacred red paint and buffalo fat to give the skin a smooth and healthy appearance. If the dead warrior had been a member of a fraternal society, his face was painted according to the style of his society. While uttering prayers, the priest placed offerings of fat in the hands and mouth of the deceased, in order to send his spirit on its way. Then the body was wrapped in a buffalo robe or blanket. Burial took place usually within two days after death. The Pawnees commonly buried their dead in the earth with the head pointing east. They also placed objects in the grave such as scalps, knives, revolvers, bows and arrows, pipes, and personal bundles. Warriors belonging to one of the lance societies were sometimes buried with the group’s old lance, which had been discarded after the lance renewal ceremony. After the burial, mourners placed food and other objects on the grave. Occasionally, a horse was slain and placed at the gravesite. The idea behind these funerary gifts was that the objects would be useful in the afterlife. Sometimes the mourners burned\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n31\n\nenemy scalps at the gravesite. Bodies that could not be recovered were left where they had died. This was not a violation of proper burial procedure. According to Pawnee scholar Roger Echo-Hawk, “such resting places on the open ground were respected as acceptable alternatives to interment in the earth.”71 The death of a loved one was a cause of much pain and grief among the Pawnees. In their grief, mourners slashed their arms, chests, and legs with knives. Women cut their hair. Charles Murray wrote in 1835 that the “duration of mourning among [them] seems very unfixed: the widow always mourns a year for her husband; but I have sometimes seen squaws mourning . . . for a relative, who had been some years dead.”72 Still, the Pawnees also believed that death on the field of battle was more honorable and even desirable for a warrior than death of old age or sickness. A warrior who died in the defense of his town or for the greater glory of his nation was showered with honors. His death, while a cause of much grief, was also a source of great pride. Jean Baptiste Truteau, a French trader who lived and traded among the Pawnees in the 1790s, observed this sentiment during the funeral of a Pawnee brave: I myself have seen, when I resided for three consecutive years at the home of the nation of Panis Republicains [Kitkahahkis] fathers and mothers sing near the bodies of their sons that had been brought back to the village to be interred, sons who had been killed in battle between the Halitannes [Comanches] and the Republicains on open prairie at some distance from their summer hunting camp, which episode I witnessed. These women, mothers of the young men who were killed, holding a bow in one hand and an arrow in the other, sang near the bodies of their sons an air both gay and martial, thanking them for having given them the satisfaction of seeing them die at the hands of the enemy while fighting valiantly for the defense of their country, a death a thousand times preferable to the fate of him who on a wretched mat expires consumed by some deadly disease.73 And so the life cycle of a warrior came to an end. But as his spirit rose to the afterworld, another man would take his place. This warrior carried on the struggle against the enemies of his nation. He fought to preserve the hunting grounds. He stole into enemy camps to secure the horses his people needed for the upcoming annual hunt. He was capable of committing acts of great bravery as well as cruelty in the name of honor\n\n32\n\nwar party in blue\n\nand revenge. His objective was always to hurt the enemy, who threatened the lives and well-being of his people. Sometimes he fought as part of a war party with his brothers of his lance society. In the 1860s and 1870s, he could also fight his enemy as a scout in the service of the United States Army. The war ethic described here was of course an ideal to which Pawnee men aspired. The reality of war was sometimes different. There is no reason to assume that Pawnee men did not also experience fear, fatigue, and demoralization. Still, by the late 1700s, the war ethic of the Pawnees had helped to make them one of the great military powers on the Great Plains. John Brown Dunbar, who grew up on the Pawnee reservation, where his father was a missionary, called the last decades of the eighteenth century the “heroic age” of the Pawnee tribe. Although Dunbar’s assessment might be an overstatement, the Pawnees were undoubtedly at the height of their power at that time. South Band Pawnee war parties ventured deeply into Apache, Osage, Kiowa, and Comanche territory. To the north, meanwhile, the Skiri Pawnees had effectively checked the expansion of the Otoes, Omahas, and Poncas. Unfortunately for the Pawnees, their supremacy would not last. By 1800, ominous signs of decline loomed ahead. Among the most devastating developments was the introduction of foreign diseases such as smallpox, influenza, measles, cholera, and whooping cough. These diseases spread quickly in the compact and densely populated towns of the Pawnees. Of all these maladies, smallpox was the most lethal. The disease struck the Pawnees in 1780–81, causing massive mortality. Tragically, the Pawnees had little time to recover from such devastating epidemics, which followed each other with remarkable frequency in the early 1800s. Recorded smallpox outbreaks caused many casualties in 1825, 1831, 1837–38, and 1852. The smallpox epidemics of 1831 and 1837–38 reportedly killed 3,000 and 2,000 Pawnees, respectively. The cholera epidemic of 1849 reportedly claimed the lives of 1,234 people, or one-fourth of the entire Pawnee population. In 1864, hundreds of Pawnees succumbed to measles and diphtheria.74 Around the same time that epidemic diseases began to take their toll among the Pawnees, the Sioux and Cheyennes began to expand into Pawnee territory. Though not immune to European-introduced germs, these tribes were more adaptable to them because their more flexible social organization allowed them to break up into smaller groups and thus escape\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n33\n\ninfection. Their populations recovered faster and may indeed have been increasing even as those of the sedentary tribes (Mandans, Hidatsas, Arikaras, Omahas, Poncas, Otoes, Missourias, Wichitas, Kitsais, and Pawnees) were declining. As the Sioux and Cheyenne tribes grew more populous, they searched for new territories and hunting grounds. By the 1830s they had overpowered most of the sedentary tribes.75 The Pawnees kept up the most stubborn resistance against the nomadic tribes posed by any of the sedentary groups. Encounters between the Pawnees and their enemies were often extremely bloody. In 1819 a Skiri war party of ninety-three men was caught by surprise and nearly annihilated.76 In 1829 the Skiris intercepted and massacred a Cheyenne war party. In 1830 the Cheyennes retaliated, but in the battle that followed they lost their famous “sacred medicine arrows.”77 In 1832, not long after the Pawnees had been weakened in a smallpox epidemic, some Sioux attacked a Skiri hunting camp and reportedly slaughtered one hundred people. In 1833 the Cheyennes and Arapahos surrounded a group of Pawnee hunters in southeastern Colorado and massacred them all.78 Matters became even worse in 1840 when the Cheyennes, Sioux, and Arapahos formally established a military alliance against the Pawnees.79 Several years later, in 1843, a large Sioux war party attacked a Pawnee town and killed around seventy people. This battle is still remembered among some Pawnees today as the “Battle of Burned Town.”80 Pressure from the Sioux and Cheyennes forced the competing Skiri and Chawi bands finally to resolve their differences and assist each other against their common enemies. In the mid-1840s the four bands concentrated their towns in a small area near the Platte River in order to protect themselves better against enemy attacks. They continued to be vulnerable, however, while out on hunting expeditions. In 1847 a Sioux war party of about seven hundred warriors attacked a Pawnee camp of some two hundred people and killed eighty-three of them.81 In the 1860s, warfare intensified as buffalo herds dwindled because of overhunting and the disruptive effect of Euro-American settlement and overland travel. To the Pawnees, the appearance of the United States after 1804 was much less an immediate cause for alarm than the threat posed by the Sioux, Cheyennes, and Arapahos. Although the Pawnees had few illusions about the imperialist intentions of the United States, they were fully aware\n\n34\n\nwar party in blue\n\nof its potential power as an enemy, an ally, or simply a supplier of badly needed guns and gunpowder. Rather than fight the United States, the Pawnees believed it was better to welcome its representatives.82 In 1816 and again in 1818, two Skiri chiefs attempted to abolish the sacrifice of enemy captives during the band’s Morning Star ceremony, an action apparently meant to appease the United States and smooth the way for friendly diplomatic relations.83 It appears that their strategy was successful, because in 1818 chiefs from all four bands traveled to St. Louis to sign a treaty of “perpetual peace and friendship” with the United States. The friendship between the Pawnees and the United States was further solidified in another treaty, signed in 1825.84 In yet a third treaty, signed in 1833, the Pawnees agreed to cede their territories south of the Platte River in exchange for annuities, schools, and “twenty-five guns, with suitable ammunition, [to be placed] in the hands of the [government] farmers of each village, to be used in case of an attack from hostile bands.”85 In their search for anything that might give them an advantage in the war against the Sioux and Cheyennes, the Pawnees even welcomed two Presbyterian missionaries into their towns in 1834. Although John Dunbar and Samuel Allis had been sent to preach peace and brotherhood under God, it is possible that the Pawnees hoped to obtain some form of additional supernatural power from them that would aid the tribe in its struggle against its enemies.86 Attempts by the United States to effect peace between the Pawnees and the Cheyennes and Arapahos met with little enthusiasm on either side. During peace talks in June 1835, the Cheyennes showed more interest in retrieving their sacred medicine arrows from the Pawnees than in establishing peace. Shortly after the talks ended, Walking Whirlwind of the Cheyennes organized another war party against the Pawnees. His warriors blundered straight into a large Pawnee camp one foggy morning and were all slain.87 Another peace conference at Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory, in October 1851 quickly broke down when one of the Cheyenne chiefs, Alight On The Clouds, refused to smoke the peace pipe. Ironically, Alight On The Clouds was killed in a skirmish with the Pawnees the next year when he was shot in the eye by a fifteen-year-old boy named Big Spotted Horse. Big Spotted Horse later enlisted as a U.S. Indian scout\n\npawnee military culture in the mid-1800s\n\n35\n\nduring the Red River war of 1874–75, against the Comanches, Kiowas, and Southern Cheyennes.88 While Sioux and Cheyenne raiders stole their horses, ambushed their hunting parties, and killed women on their way to the cornfields,89 the Pawnees also faced pressures from Euro-American settlers and overland migrants, who, apart from spreading diseases, introduced liquor and destroyed valuable resources such as wood, fresh grass, and game. As a result of these combined pressures the Pawnees were reduced to poverty and stood in real danger of starvation. To avoid starving, some began to demand tribute from overland travelers while others simply took what they needed. Consequently, most migrants looked upon the Pawnees as beggars and thieves. Not infrequently, migrants and settlers filed false claims in order to receive Pawnee annuity money in compensation.90 To prevent confrontations with the growing number of settlers in the area and to provide desperately needed support for their people, the Pawnees agreed to a new treaty in 1857. In it they ceded more land in return for fixed reservation boundaries and new annuity payments.91 Unfortunately, it offered them little protection against the Sioux. Around 1860 the Pawnees built a high sod wall to defend their now single, consolidated settlement on the west, south, and east against enemy attacks. Nevertheless, between April and September 1860, Sioux raiders struck the town no fewer than eight times.92 The U.S. government, meanwhile, seemed more content with pacifying the resisting tribes such as the Sioux with gifts than with providing adequate protection for friendly tribes such as the Pawnees.93 Although military historians tend to reserve the concept of “total war” for conflicts between modern industrial nations, the term nevertheless most closely approaches the state of affairs between the Pawnees and the Sioux and Cheyennes. Both sides directed their actions not solely against warrior-combatants but against the people as a whole. Noncombatants were legitimate targets. Indeed, the taking of a scalp of a woman or child was considered honorable because it signified that the scalp taker had dared to enter the very heart of the enemy’s territory. The war also had a distinct economic component, in that the Sioux and Cheyennes often targeted Pawnee women on their way to their gardens, plundered the\n\n36\n\nwar party in blue\n\nstorage pits in the towns, and attacked Pawnee hunting parties in search of buffalo. The relatively small scale of these conflicts should not obscure the fact that, to the Pawnees, the devastation wrought upon them by their enemies in the 1860s compares in magnitude to the burning of Atlanta several times over. It is within this context that the military service of the Pawnee scouts must be viewed. Faced with the grim prospect of annihilation, the Pawnees seized the opportunity to fight their enemies as allies of the United States. When war broke out between the United States and the Sioux, Cheyennes, and Arapahos in the early 1860s, government officials in the War Department began to consider the potential value of a military alliance with the Pawnees. The United States needed help in locating and surprising the resisting tribes, and the Pawnees welcomed the opportunity to place their enemies on the defensive, take the war away from the Pawnee towns, and exact revenge for past losses. For the Pawnees, scout service was merely a continuation of a war that had begun a long time before.94\n\nCHAPTER\n\n2\n\nU.S. Military Tactics and the Recruitment of Pawnee Scouts\n\nNeither the Wild Tribes, nor the Government Indian Scouts ever adopted any of the white soldiers’ tactics. They thought their own much better. —Captain Luther H. North, Pawnee scouts The expansion of the Sioux and Cheyennes posed a problem not only for the Pawnees but for the United States as well. Although the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 had transferred the political title to the northern and central Great Plains from France to the United States, the military conquest of the region by the Americans was an entirely different matter. Contrary to popular imagination, the United States did not control the plains. The Sioux, Cheyennes, Kiowas, Comanches, and other tribes contested the United States’ claim for control of the area. For much of the nineteenth century the U.S. Army was unable to impose its military hegemony over the powerful tribes of the West. It was this inability to subdue the tribes that prompted U.S. military commanders to seek the assistance of Indian nations who also suffered from the pressures of these tribes. The Pawnees did not approach the United States; rather, the United States approached them.1 Until the Mexican War of 1846–48, relations between the United States and the Indians of the Great Plains had been relatively peaceful. But the conclusion of the war marked a new phase of Anglo-American expansion into the West. The newly acquired territories in Oregon and the Southwest attracted thousands of settlers. Traffic along the Santa Fe 37\n\n38\n\nwar party in blue\n\nTrail increased, and new “highways,” such as the Oregon and California Trails, sliced through the plains. The migrants were a source of irritation for the tribes living here. Their wagon trains disrupted hunting grounds and scared away buffalo and other game. They depleted the supply of timber along the trails, and their livestock consumed the grass that Indian horses depended on for forage. The Pawnees, arguably, suffered the most serious disruption, because the migrant trail ran through the heart of their territory, along the Platte River. The flow of settlers grew dramatically after the discovery of gold in California and Colorado in the 1840s and 1850s.2 As the volume of traffic along the trails increased, so did the number of confrontations between Indians and whites. Most tribes resented the disruption caused by the migrants, whom they regarded as trespassers. They deplored the disappearance of game and demanded gifts such as food and supplies as a form of compensation for allowing the migrants to travel through their territories. Others did not demand but simply took what they needed. They did not consider stealing a dishonorable occupation, especially if hunger was the alternative. The overland travelers, however, detested the presence of Indians along the trails.3 To prevent conflicts between Indian tribes and migrants and settlers, the United States government adopted several measures. It established a series of military posts along the main routes to guard the overland trails and to impress the Indian nations with the power of the United States.4 In addition to building forts, government officials began to negotiate with the tribes living near the main migrant trails. In 1851 they concluded a treaty with a number of tribes of the northern plains at Fort Laramie. The Pawnees were not part of these negotiations. In this treaty the tribes agreed to leave the migrant trains alone, refrain from wars with the United States and each other, and permit the construction of forts and roads through their territories. In return, the United States promised to pay the Indians annuities and restitution for damages caused by travelers. Two years later, at Fort Atkinson, Kansas, a similar treaty was concluded with the tribes of the southern plains. Finally, during the 1850s, the United States adopted the reservation policy. This policy replaced the removal policy of the 1830s, which had become impractical after the\n\nu.s. military tactics and the recruitment of pawnee scouts\n\n39\n\nUnited States acquired the southwestern territories during the Mexican War. The reservation policy not only allowed the United States to contain tribes in relatively small areas but also enabled missionaries and other agents of “civilization” to begin their work of obliterating American Indian cultures. These measures did little to appease the Indian tribes. Some tribes considered the presence of forts in the heart of their country humiliating. They also resented the sluggishness with which the United States implemented its treaty provisions. Annuities rarely arrived on time, and although the government was quick to punish Indians accused of committing depredations, it did little to prevent or punish violations against Indians. Most of all, the Sioux and Cheyennes resented attempts by the government to confine them on reservations. Forts, treaties, and reservations, then, were not a solution to Indian hostilities but frequently a cause of them.5 The U.S. government depended heavily on the army to maintain peace on the plains. The army’s task was twofold: to protect travelers and settlers against hostile tribes and to protect friendly Indians from hostile and ignorant whites. Policy makers in Washington decided that the best way to keep these groups apart was to prevent the tribes from roaming the area by concentrating them on reservations, where they could be supervised by the army. But the army faced several problems that prevented it from achieving these goals. One problem was the size of the regular army. Congress placed restrictions on the size of the army for budgetary as well as ideological reasons. Policy makers in Washington disagreed on the proper policy. Some, mostly western congressmen, advocated military conquest. Others, mostly eastern congressmen, favored “conquest by kindness.” Washington never resolved this dilemma.
