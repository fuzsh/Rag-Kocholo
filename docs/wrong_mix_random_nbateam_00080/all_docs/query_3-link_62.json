        "text": "Joseph Harker was no stranger to adversity. He grew up with an alcoholic father. After his father died of alcoholism, his family was left with a large debt. He and his mother and his brother were saved by the kindness of a neighbor who kept them from losing their home. Joseph's brother unfortunately suffered from a psychiatric disorder that eventually let him to try to kill Joseph and their mother. Joseph and his mother had to have him placed in an asylum.\n\nDespite all the troubles he had suffered in his early life he still had a heart that hoped for a testimony of the Lord. He wrote in his own words: \"One night I sought the Lord with all my heart to get a testimony from the Lord. About midnight I saw a personage coming over the top of the trees at the back of the house. He stood at the foot of the bed and the room became light as day and then he disappeared. This left such a joy and feeling upon me I can never forget. I had been attending the Wesleyan meetings and I had faith that I could do the same and I know that my prayer was answered.\" Soon after this vision he heard the gospel preached an became converted. On May 25, 1845 Joseph Harker was baptized.\n\nThings did not get easier because he joined the church. He did marry Susannah Sneath and joined the saints in Nauvoo in time to suffer with the saints as they were forced to leave. In the year of 1846 they lost two young sons, a year of heartbreak. They went to Winter Quarters and lived there with the saints.\n\nJoseph had a real scare at Winter Quarters. Some soldiers came to his house to check on things and decided to stay and cook their evening meal. Susannah had been suffering from a fever, and she was very afraid of the soldiers. Joseph discovered her missing. Joseph followed the trail to the creek and feared that she had fallen in and drowned when she went to get water for the soldiers. He spent hours with his pitchfork trying to find her body, thinking that she was dead. In a moment of rest he heard some sniffling and saw a little path leading off of the creek. When he followed it he found Susannah lying the grass suffering from her fever. He was so relieved to find her, but she refused to return to the cabin until the soldiers were gone.\n\nThey had some adventures with the Indians as Joseph was able to get a job working for an Indian while they lived at Winter Quarters.The Indians held Joseph and his family hostage for a time because they did not want him to travel west with the saints. Joseph had been working for a wealthy native and the man he was working for didn't want him to quit so he detained Joseph and Susannah. Joseph and Susannah devised a plan and were able to get away. The arrived in Salt Lake the first summer in 1847.\n\nThey were among the first to Salt Lake Valley, and Susannah where they were among the few to settle west of Jordan River. Susannah was the first white woman to live west of the River.\n\nhttp://lawpioneer.fatcow.com/people/harker/josephharker/josephharke...\n\nMormon Pioneer Overland Travel 1847â€“1868 Edward Hunter - Joseph Horne Company (1847) Age at Departure: 29\n\nMormon Pioneer.
