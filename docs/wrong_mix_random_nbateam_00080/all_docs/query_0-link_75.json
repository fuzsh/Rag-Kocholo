        "text": "Praise for Anno Dracula:\n\nâKim Newmanâs Anno Dracula is back in print, and we must celebrate. It was the first mash-up of literature, history and vampires, and now, in a world in which vampires are everywhere, itâs still the best, and its bite is just as sharp. Compulsory reading, commentary, and mindgame: glorious.â\n\nâ Neil Gaiman\n\nâAnno Dracula couldnât be more fun if Bram Stoker had scripted it for Hammer. Itâs a beautifully constructed Gothic epic that knocks almost every other vampire novel out for the count.â\n\nâ Christopher Fowler\n\nâBloody excellent. Kim Newman has exsanguinated the best of fact and fiction and created a vivid vampirous Victorian world uniquely his own. This clever, delicious extravaganza â Hammer Horror meets True (Blue) Blood â is just the tonic for the year of a Royal Wedding.â â Stephen Volk\n\nâAnno Dracula is the smart, hip Year Zero of the vampire genreâs ongoing revolution.â â Paul McAuley\n\nâA brilliantly witty parallel-world saga... builds sure-footedly to a bravura climax which entirely redefines âVictorian valuesâ.â\n\nâ Daily Telegraph\n\nâA tour de force which succeeds brilliantly.â â The Times\n\nâA marvellous marriage of political satire, melodramatic intrigue, gothic horror and alternative history. Not to be missed.â\n\nâ The Independent\n\nâThe most comprehensive, brilliant, dazzlingly audacious vampire novel to date. âUltimateâ seems an apt description... Anno Dracula is at once playful, horrific, intelligent and revelatory... Newmanâs prose will remain gloriously unique.â â Locus\n\nCOMING SOON:\n\nANNO DRACULA: THE BLOODY RED BARON\n\nANNO DRACULA: DRACULA CHA CHA CHA\n\nANNO DRACULA: JOHNNY ALUCARD\n\nANNO DRACULA\n\nISBN: 9780857685339\n\nPublished by\n\nTitan Books\n\nA division of Titan Publishing Group Ltd\n\n144 Southwark St\n\nLondon\n\nSE1 0UP\n\nFirst edition: May 2011\n\n10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n\nThis is a work of fiction.

Here, in the whirlpool of European races, the Ugric tribe bore down from Iceland and the fighting spirit which Thor and Wodin gave them, which their Berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of Europe, ay, and of Asia and Africa too, till the peoples thought that the were-wolves themselves had come. Here, too, when they came, they fought the Huns, whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame, till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches, who, expelled from Scythia had mated with the devils in the desert. Fools, fools! What devil or what witch was ever so great as Attila, whose blood is in these veins? Is it a wonder that we were a conquering race; that we were proud; that when the Magyar, the Lombard, the Avar, the Bulgar, or the Turk poured his thousands on our frontiers, we drove them back? Is it strange that when Arpad and his legions swept through the Hungarian fatherland, he found us here when he reached the frontier? And when the Hungarian flood swept eastward, the Szekeleys were claimed as kindred by the victorious Magyars, and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of Turkey-land; ay and more than that, endless duty of the frontier guard, for, as the Turks say, âwater sleeps, and enemy is sleeplessâ. Who more gladly than we throughout the Four Nations received the âbloody swordâ, or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the King? When was redeemed that great shame of my nation, the shame of Cassova, when the flags of the Wallach and the Magyar went down beneath the Crescent, who was it but one of my own race who as Voivode crossed the Danube and beat the Turk on his own ground? This was a Dracula indeed! Woe was it that his own unworthy brother, when he had fallen, sold his people to the Turk and brought the shame of slavery upon them!... Again, when, after the battle of Mohacs, we threw off the Hungarian yoke, we of the Dracula blood were amongst their leaders, for our spirit would not brook that we were not free. Ah, young sir, the Szekeleys â and the Dracula as their heartâs blood, their brains and their swords â can boast a record that mushroom growths like the Hapsburgs and the Romanoffs can never reach. The warlike days are over. Blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace; and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told.â\n\nCount Dracula\n\nâI have studied, over and over again since they came into my hands, all the papers relating to this monster; and the more I have studied, the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out. All through there are signs of his advance; not only of his power, but of his knowledge of it. As I learned, from the researches of my friend Arminius of Buda-Pesth, he was in life a most wonderful man. Soldier, statesman and alchemist â which latter was the highest development of the science-knowledge of his time. He had a mighty brain, a learning beyond compare, and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse. He dared even to attend the Scholomance, and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay. Well, in him the brain powers survived the physical death; though it would seem that memory was not all complete. In some faculties of mind he has been, and is, only a child; but he is growing, and some things that were childish at the first are now of manâs stature. He is experimenting, and doing it well; and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet â he may yet be if we fail â the father or furtherer of a new order of beings, whose road must lead through Death, not Life.â\n\nDr Abraham Van Helsing\n\n1\n\nIN THE FOG\n\nDr Sewardâs Diary (kept in phonograph)\n\n17 SEPTEMBER.\n\nLast nightâs delivery was easier than the others. Much easier than last weekâs. Perhaps, with practice and patience, everything becomes easier. If never easy. Never... easy.\n\nI am sorry: it is difficult to maintain an orderly mind and this marvellous apparatus is unforgiving. I cannot ink over hasty words or tear loose a spoiled page. The cylinder revolves, the needle etches, and my ramblings are graven for all time in merciless wax. Marvellous apparatuses, like miracle cures, are beset with unpredictable side-effects. In the twentieth century, new means of setting down human thought may precipitate an avalanche of worthless digression. Brevis esse laboro, as Horace would have it. I know how to present a case history. This will be of interest to posterity. For now, I work in camera and secrete the cylinders with what remain of my earlier accounts. As the situation stands, my life and liberty would be endangered were these journals exposed to the public ear. One day, I should wish my motives and methods made known and clear.\n\nVery well.\n\nThe subject: female, apparently in her twenties. Recently dead, I should say. Profession: obvious. Location: Chicksand Street. The Brick Lane end, opposite Flower & Dean Street. Time: shortly after five ante meridiem.\n\nI had been wandering for upwards of an hour in fog as thick as spoiled milk. Fog is best for my night-work. The less one can see of what the city has become in this year, the better. Like many, Iâve taken to sleeping by day, working by night. Mostly, I doze; it seems years since the bliss of actual sleep. Hours of darkness are the hours of activity now. Of course, here in Whitechapel things were never much different.\n\nThereâs one of those cursed blue plaques in Chicksand Street; at 197, one of the Countâs bolt-holes. Here lay six of the earth-boxes to which he and Van Helsing attached such superstitious and, as it eventuated, entirely unwarranted importance. Lord Godalming was supposed to destroy them; but, as in so much else, my noble friend proved not equal to the task. I was under the plaque, unable to discern its wording, pondering our failures, when the dead girl solicited my attention.\n\nâMister...â she called. âMissssster...â\n\nAs I turned, she settled feathers away from her throat. Her neck and bosom showed mist-white. A living woman would have shook with the cold. She stood under a staircase leading to a first-floor doorway above which burned a red-shaded lantern. Behind her, bar-shadowed by the stairs, was another doorway, half-sunken below the level of the pavement. None of the windows in the building, nor in any close enough to see clearly, showed a light. We inhabited an island of visibility in a sea of murk.\n\nI traversed the street, boots making yellow eddies in the low-lying fog. There was no one nearby. I heard people passing, but we were curtained. Soon, the first spikes of dawn would drive the last new-borns from the streets. The dead girl was up late by the standards of her kind. Dangerously late. Her need for money, for drink, must have been acute.\n\nâSuch a handsome gentleman,â she cooed, waving a hand in front of her, sharp nails shredding traces of fog.\n\nI endeavoured to make out her face and was rewarded with an impression of thin prettiness. She angled her head slightly to regard me, a wing of jet-black hair falling away from a white cheek. There was interest in her black-red eyes, and hunger. Also, a species of half-aware amusement that borders contempt. The look is common among women, on the streets or off. When Lucy â Miss Westenra of Sainted Memory â refused my proposal, the spark of a similar expression inhabited her eyes.\n\nâ... and so close to morning.â\n\nShe was not English. From her accent, Iâd judge her German or Austrian by birth. The hint of a âchâ in âchentlemanâ, a âcloseâ that verged upon âclozeâ. The Prince Consortâs London, from Buckingham Palace to Buckâs Row, is the sinkhole of Europe, clogged with the ejecta of a double-dozen principalities.\n\nâCome on and kiss me, sir.â\n\nI stood for a moment, simply looking. She was indeed a pretty thing, distinctive. Her shiny hair was cut short and lacquered in an almost Chinese style, sharp bangs like the cheek-guards of a Roman helmet. In the fog, her red lips appeared quite black. Like all of them, she smiled too easily, disclosing sharp pearl-chip teeth. A cloud of cheap scent hung around, sickly to cover the reek.\n\nThe streets are filthy, open sewers of vice. The dead are everywhere.\n\nThe girl laughed musically, the sound like something wrung from a mechanism, and beckoned me near, loosening further the ragged feathers about her shoulders. Her laugh reminded me again of Lucy. Lucy when she was alive, not the leech-thing we finished in Kingstead Cemetery. Three years ago, when only Van Helsing believed...\n\nâWonât you give me a little kiss,â she sang. âJust a little kiss.â\n\nHer lips made a heart-shape. Her nails touched my cheek, then her fingertips. We were both cold; my face a mask of ice, her fingers needles pricking through frozen skin.\n\nâWhat brought you to this?â I asked.\n\nâGood fortune and kind gentlemen.â\n\nâAm I a kind gentleman?â I asked, gripping the scalpel in my trousers pocket.\n\nâOh yes, one of the kindest. I can tell.â\n\nI pressed the flat of the instrument against my thigh, feeling the chill of silver through good cloth.\n\nâI have some mistletoe,â the dead girl said, detaching a sprig from her bodice. She held it above her.\n\nâA kiss?â she asked. âJust a penny for a kiss.â\n\nâIt is early for Christmas.â\n\nâThereâs always time for a kiss.â\n\nShe shook her sprig, berries jiggling like silent bells. I placed a cold kiss on her red-black lips and took out my knife, holding it under my coat. I felt the bladeâs keenness through my glove. Her cheek was cool against my face.\n\nI learned from last weekâs in Hanbury Street â Chapman, the newspapers say her name was, Annie or Anne â to do the business swiftly and precisely. Throat. Heart. Tripes. Then get the head off. That finishes the things. Clean silver and a clean conscience. Van Helsing, blinkered by folklore and symbolism, spoke always of the heart, but any of the major organs will do. The kidneys are easiest to reach.\n\nI had made preparation carefully before venturing out. For half an hour I sat, allowing myself to become aware of the pain. Renfield is dead â truly dead â but the madman left his jaw-marks in my right hand. The semi-circle of deep indentations has scabbed over many times but never been right again. With Chapman, I was dull from the laudanum I take and not as precise as I should have been. Learning to cut left-handed has not helped. I missed the major artery and the thing had time to screech. I am afraid I lost control and became a butcher, when I should be a surgeon.\n\nLast nightâs went better. The girl clung as tenaciously to life, but there was an acceptance of my gift. She was relieved, at the last, to have her soul cleansed. Silver is hard to come by now. The coinage is gold or copper. I hoarded threepenny bits while the money was changing and sacrificed my motherâs dinner service. Iâve had the instruments since my Purfleet days. Now the blades are plated, a core of steel strength inside killing silver. This time I selected the postmortem scalpel. It is fitting, I think, to employ a tool intended for rooting around in corpses.\n\nThe dead girl invited me into her doorway and wriggled skirts up over slim white legs. I took the time to open her blouse. My fingers, hot with pain, fumbled.\n\nâYour hand?â\n\nI held up the lumpily-gloved club and tried a smile. She kissed my locked knuckles and I slipped my other hand out from my coat, holding firmly the scalpel.\n\nâAn old wound,â I said. âItâs nothing.â\n\nShe smiled and I quickly drew my silver edge across her neck, pressing firmly with my thumb, cutting deep into pristine dead-flesh. Her eyes widened with shock â silver hurts â and she released a long sigh. Lines of thin blood trickled like rain on a window-pane, staining the skin over her collar-bones. A single tear of blood issued from the corner of her mouth.\n\nâLucy,â I said, remembering...\n\nI held up the girl, my body shielding her from passersby, and slid the scalpel through her stays and into her heart. I felt her shudder and fall lifeless. But I know the dead can be resilient and took care to finish the job. I laid her in the well of the sunken doorway and completed the delivery. There was little blood in her; she must not have fed tonight. After cutting away her corset, easily ripping the cheap material, I exposed the punctured heart, detached the intestines from the mesentery, unravelled a yard of the colon, and removed the kidneys and part of the uterus. Then I enlarged the first incision. Having exposed the vertebrae, I worried the loose head back and forth until the neckbones parted.\n\n2\n\nGENEVIEVE\n\nNoise reached into her darkness. Hammering. Insistent, repeated blows. Meat and bone against wood.\n\nIn her dreams, GeneviÃ¨ve had returned to the days of her girlhood in the France of the Spider King, la Pucelle and the monster Gilles. When warm, she had been the physicianâs daughter not Chandagnacâs get. Before she turned, before the Dark Kiss...\n\nHer tongue felt sleep-filmed teeth. The aftertang of her own blood was in her mouth, disgusting and mildly exciting.\n\nIn her dreams, the pounding was a mallet striking the end of a snapped-in-half quarterstaff. The English captain finished her father-in-darkness like a butterfly, pinning Chandagnac to the bloodied earth. One of the less memorable skirmishes of the Hundred Yearsâ War. Barbarous times she had hoped deservedly dead.\n\nThe hammering continued. She opened her eyes and tried to focus on the grubby glass of the skylight. The sun was not yet quite down. Dreams washed away in an instant and she was awake, as if a gallon of icy water were dashed into her face.\n\nThe hammering paused. âMademoiselle DieudonnÃ©,â someone shouted. It was not the director â usually responsible for urgent calls that dragged her from sleep â but she recognised the voice. âOpen up. Scotland Yard.â\n\nShe sat, sheet falling away. She slept on the floor in her underclothes, on a blanket laid over the rough planks.\n\nâThereâs been another Silver Knife murder.â\n\nShe had been resting in her tiny office at Toynbee Hall. It was as safe a place as any to pass the few days each month when lassitude overcame her and she shared the sleep of the dead. Up high in the building, the room had only a tiny skylight and the door could be secured from the inside. It served, as coffins and crypts served for those of the Prince Consortâs bloodline.\n\nShe gave a placatory grunt and the hammering was not resumed. She cleared her throat. Her body, unused for days, creaked as she stretched. A cloud obscured the sun and the pain momentarily eased. She stood up in the dark and ran her hands over her hair. The cloud passed and her strength ebbed.\n\nâMademoiselle?â\n\nThe hammering started again. The young were always impatient. She had once been the same.\n\nShe took a Chinese silk robe from a hook and drew it about herself. Not the dress etiquette recommended to entertain a gentleman caller, but it would have to do. Etiquette, so important a few short years ago, meant less and less. They were sleeping in earth-lined coffins in Mayfair, and hunting in packs on Pall Mall. This season, the correct form of address for an archbishop was hardly of major concern to anyone.\n\nAs she slid back the bolt, traces of her sleep-fog persisted. Outside the afternoon was dying; she would not be at her best until night was about her again. She pulled open her door. A stocky new-born stood in the corridor, long coat around him like a cloak, bowler hat shifting from hand to hand.\n\nâSurely, Lestrade, you are not of the kind that needs to be invited into any new dwelling?â GeneviÃ¨ve enquired. âThat would be very inconvenient for a man in your profession. Well, come in, come in...â\n\nShe admitted the Scotland Yard man. Jagged teeth stuck from his mouth, unconcealed by a half-grown moustache. When warm, he had been rat-faced; the sparse whiskers completed the resemblance. His ears were shifting, becoming high and pointed. Like most new-borns of the bloodline of the Prince Consort, he had not yet found his final form. He wore smoked glasses but crimson points behind the lenses suggested active eyes.\n\nHe set his hat down upon her desk.\n\nâLast night,â he began, hurriedly, âin Chicksand Street. It was butchery.â\n\nâLast night?â\n\nâIâm sorry,â he drew breath, making an allowance for her spell of rest. âItâs the seventeenth now. Of September.â\n\nâIâve been asleep three days.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve opened her wardrobe and considered the few clothes hanging inside. She hardly had costume for every occasion. It was unlikely, all considered, that she would in the near future be invited to a reception at the Palace. Her only remaining jewellery was her fatherâs tiny crucifix, and she rarely wore that for fear of upsetting some sensitive new-born with silly ideas.\n\nâI deemed it best to rouse you. Everyone is jittery. Feelings are running high.â\n\nâYou were quite right,â she said. She rubbed sleep-gum from her eyes. Even the last shards of sunlight, filtered through a grimy square of glass, were icicles jammed into her forehead.\n\nâWhen the sun is down,â Lestrade was saying, âthereâll be pandemonium. It could be another Bloody Sunday. Some say Van Helsing has returned.â\n\nâThe Prince Consort would love that.â\n\nLestrade shook his head. âItâs merely a rumour. Van Helsing is dead. His head remains on its spike.â\n\nâYouâve checked?â\n\nâThe Palace is always under guard. The Prince Consort has his Carpathians about him. Our kind cannot be too careful. We have many enemies.â\n\nâOur kind?â\n\nâThe un-dead.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve almost laughed. âI am not your kind, Inspector. You are of the bloodline of Vlad Tepes, I am of the bloodline of Chandagnac. We are at best cousins.â\n\nThe detective shrugged and snorted at the same time. Bloodline meant little to the vampires of London, GeneviÃ¨ve knew. Even at a third, a tenth or a twentieth remove, they all had Vlad Tepes as father-in-darkness.\n\nâWho?â she asked.\n\nâA new-born named SchÃ¶n. Lulu. Common prostitute, like the others.â\n\nâThis is... what, the fourth?â\n\nâNo one is sure. The sensation press have exhumed every unsolved East End killing of the past thirty years to lay at the door of the Whitechapel Murderer.â\n\nâHow many are the police certain of?â\n\nLestrade snorted. âWeâll not even be certain of SchÃ¶n until the inquest, although Iâll stake my pension on her. Iâve come direct from the mortuary. The trade marks are unmistakable. Otherwise, Annie Chapman last week and Polly Nichols the week before. Opinions differ on a couple of others. Emma Smith, Martha Tabram.â\n\nâWhat do you think?â\n\nLestrade nibbled his lip. âJust the three. At least, the three we know of. Smith was set upon, robbed and impaled by roughs from the Jago. Violated, too. Typical rip-mob assault, nothing like our manâs work. And Tabram was warm. Silver Knife is only interested in us. In vampires.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve understood.\n\nâThis man hates,â Lestrade continued, âhates with a passion. The murders must be committed in a frenzy, yet thereâs a coolness to them. He kills out on the street in broad darkness. He doesnât just butcher, he dissects. And vampires arenât easy to kill. Our man is not a simple lunatic. He has a reason.â\n\nLestrade took the crimes personally. The Whitechapel Murderer cut deep. New-borns were jerked this way and that by misunderstanding, cringing from the crucifix because of a folk tale they half-knew.\n\nâHas the news travelled?â\n\nâFast,â the detective told her. âThe evening editions carry the story. Itâll be all over London by now. There are those among the warm who do not love us, Mademoiselle. Theyâre rejoicing. When the new-borns come out, there could be a panic. Iâve suggested troops, but Warren is leery. After that business last year...â\n\nShe remembered. Alarmed in the aftermath of the Royal Wedding by increased public disorder, Sir Charles Warren, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, had issued an edict against political meetings in Trafalgar Square. In defiance, warm insurrectionists, preaching against the Crown and the new government, gathered one November afternoon. William Morris and H.M. Hyndman of the Socialist Democratic Federation, with the support of Robert Cunningham-Grahame, the radical Member of Parliament, and Annie Besant, of the National Secular Society, argued for the declaration of a Republic. There was fierce, indeed violent, debate. GeneviÃ¨ve observed from the steps of the National Gallery. She was not the only vampire to consider aligning with the putative Republic. You did not have to be warm to take Vlad Tepes for a monster. Eleanor Marx, herself a new-born, and authoress with Dr Edward Aveling of The Vampire Question, made an impassioned speech calling for the abdication of Queen Victoria and the expulsion of the Prince Consort.\n\nâ... I canât say I blame him. Still, H Division isnât equipped for riot. The Yard has sent me over to goose the local blokes, but weâve got enough to do catching the murderer without having to fend off some scythe-and-stake mob.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve wondered which way Sir Charles would jump. In November, the Commissioner, a soldier before he was a policeman and now a vampire before he was a soldier, had sent in the army. Even before a flustered magistrate could finish reading the Riot Act, a dragoon officer ordered his men, a mixture of vampires and the warm, to clear the Square. After that charge, the Prince Consortâs Own Carpathian Guards set about the crowd, doing more harm with teeth and claws than the dragoons had with fixed bayonets. There were a few fatalities and many injuries; subsequently, there were a few trials and many âdisappearancesâ. November 13th, 1887, was remembered as âBloody Sundayâ. GeneviÃ¨ve spent a week in Guyâs Hospital, helping with the less seriously wounded. Many spat on her or refused to be ministered to by one of her kind. Were it not for the intervention of the Queen herself, still a calming influence on her adoring subjects, the Empire could have exploded like a barrel of gunpowder.\n\nâAnd what, pray, can I do,â GeneviÃ¨ve asked, âto serve the purpose of the Prince Consort?â\n\nLestrade chewed his moustache, teeth glistening, flecks of froth on his lips.\n\nâYou may be needed, Mademoiselle. The Hall will be overrun. Some donât want to be out on the streets with the murderer about. Others are spreading panic and sedition, firing up vigilante mobs.â\n\nâIâm not Florence Nightingale.â\n\nâYou have influence...â\n\nâI do, donât I?â\n\nâI wish... I would humbly request... you would use your influence to calm the situation. Before disaster occurs. Before more are unnecessarily killed.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve was not above enjoying a taste of power. She slipped off her robe, shocking the detective. Death and rebirth had not shaken out of him the prejudices of his time. Lestrade shrank behind his smoked glasses, as she swiftly dressed, fastening the seeming hundreds of small catches and buttons on her bottle-green skirt and jacket with neat movements of sharp-tipped fingers. It was as if the costume of her warm days, as intricate and cumbersome as a full suit of armour, had returned to plague her. As a new-born, she had, with relief, worn the simple tunics and trews made acceptable if not fashionable by the Maid of Orleans, vowing never again to be sewed into breath-stopping formal dress.\n\nThe Inspector was too pale to blush properly, but penny-sized patches appeared on his cheeks and he huffed involuntarily. Lestrade, like many new-borns, treated her as if she were the age of her face. She had been sixteen when Chandagnac gave her the Dark Kiss. She was older, by a decade or more, than Vlad Tepes. While he was a warm Christian Prince, nailing Turksâ turbans to their skulls and lowering his countrymen on to sharpened posts, she had been a new-born, learning the skills that now made her the longest-lived of her bloodline. With four and a half centuries behind her, it was hard not to be irritated when the fresh-risen dead, still barely cooled, patronised her.\n\nâSilver Knife must be found and stopped,â Lestrade said. âBefore he kills again.â\n\nâIndubitably,â GeneviÃ¨ve agreed. âIt sounds like an affair for your old associate, the consulting detective.â\n\nShe sensed, with the sharpened perceptions that told her night was falling, the chilling of the Inspectorâs heart.\n\nâMr Holmes is not at liberty to investigate, Mademoiselle. He has his differences with the current government.â\n\nâYou mean he has been removed, like so many of our finest minds, to those pens on the Sussex Downs. What does the Pall Mall Gazette call them, concentration camps?â\n\nâI regret his lack of vision...â\n\nâWhere is he? Devilâs Dyke?â\n\nLestrade nodded, almost ashamed. There was much of the man left inside. New-borns clung to their warm lives as if nothing had changed. How long would it be before they grew like the bitch vampires the Prince Consort had brought from the land beyond the forests, an appetite on legs, mindlessly preying?\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve finished her cuffs and turned to Lestrade, arms slightly out. It was a habit born of lifetimes without mirrors, always seeking an opinion on her appearance. The detective gave grudging approval. Settling a hooded cloak about her shoulders, she left her room, Lestrade following.\n\nIn the corridor outside, gaslights were already lit. Beyond a row of windows, hanging fog purged itself of the last of the dying sun. One window was open, letting in cool air. GeneviÃ¨ve could taste life in it. She must feed soon, within two or three days. It was always that way after her rest.\n\nâThe SchÃ¶n inquest commences tomorrow night,â Lestrade said, âat the Working Ladsâ Institute. It might be best if you attended.â\n\nâVery well, but I must first talk with the director. Someone will have to take care of my duties for the duration.â\n\nThey were on the stairs. The building was coming to life. No matter how the Prince Consort changed London, Toynbee Hall â founded by the Reverend Samuel Barnett in the name of the late philanthropist Arnold Toynbee â was still required. The poor needed shelter, sustenance, medical attention, education. The new-borns, potentially immortal destitutes, were hardly better off than their warm brothers and sisters. For many, the East End settlements were the last recourse. GeneviÃ¨ve felt like Sisyphus, forever rolling a rock uphill, losing a yard for every foot gained.\n\nOn the first-floor landing sat a dark-haired little girl, a rag-doll in her lap. One of her arms was withered, leathery membranes bunched in folds beneath it, the drab dress cut away to allow freedom of movement. Lily smiled, teeth sharp but uneven.\n\nâGenÃ©,â Lily said, âlook...â\n\nSmiling she extended the spindly arm. It grew longer, more sinewy; the hairy grey-brown flap stretched.\n\nâIâve been working on my wings. Iâll fly to the moon and back.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve looked away and saw Lestrade similarly examining the ceiling. She turned back to Lily and knelt, stroking her arm. The thick skin felt wrong, as if the muscles beneath were pulling against each other. Neither the elbow nor the wrist locked properly. Vlad Tepes could shape-shift without effort, but new-borns of his bloodline could not carry off the trick. Which didnât prevent them from trying.\n\nâIâll bring you some cheese,â Lily said, âas a present.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve stroked Lilyâs hair and stood. The directorâs door was open. She entered, rapping a knuckle on the wood as she passed. The director was at his desk, going over a lecture time-table with Morrison, his secretary. The director was youngish and still warm, but his face was lined, his hair streaked grey. Many whoâd lived through the changes were like him, older than their years. Lestrade followed her into the office. The director acknowledged the detective. Morrison, a quiet young man with an interest in literature and Japanese prints, stood back in the shadows.\n\nâJack,â she said, âInspector Lestrade wishes me to attend an inquest tomorrow.â\n\nâThereâs been another murder,â the director said, making a statement not asking a question.\n\nâA new-born,â said Lestrade. âIn Chicksand Street.â\n\nâLulu SchÃ¶n,â GeneviÃ¨ve put in.\n\nâDid we know her?â\n\nâProbably, but under some other name.â\n\nâArthur can go through the files,â the director said, looking at Lestrade but indicating Morrison. âYouâll want the details.â\n\nâWas she another street girl?â Morrison asked.\n\nâYes, of course,â said GeneviÃ¨ve. The young man looked down.\n\nâI think weâve had her here,â he said. âOne of Boothâs cast-offs.â\n\nMorrisonâs face screwed up as he mentioned the Generalâs name. The Salvation Army deemed the un-dead beyond redemption, worse than other drunkards. Although warm, Morrison did not share the prejudice.\n\nThe directorâs fingers drummed his desk. He looked, as usual, as if the weight of the world had just unexpectedly settled on his shoulders.\n\nâCan you spare me?â\n\nâDruitt can take your rounds if heâs back from his cricketing jaunt. And Arthur can fill in once weâve got the lecture schedules arranged. We werenât, ah, expecting you for a night or two yet anyway.â\n\nâThank you.â\n\nâThatâs quite all right. Keep me informed. This is a dreadful business.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve agreed. âIâll see what I can do to pacify the natives. Lestrade is expecting an uprising.â\n\nThe policeman looked shifty and embarrassed. For a moment, GeneviÃ¨ve felt small, teasing the new-born. She was being unfair.\n\nâThere may be something I can actually do. Talk to some of the new-born girls. Get them to take care, see if anyone knows anything.â\n\nâVery well, GeneviÃ¨ve. Good luck. Lestrade, good evening.â\n\nâDr Seward,â said the detective, putting on his hat, âgood night.â\n\n3\n\nTHE AFTER-DARK\n\nFlorence Stoker daintily tinkled her little bell, not to summon the maid but to call her parlour to attention. The ornament was aluminium, not silver. The clatter of tea-taking and conversation died. The company turned to play audience to their hostess.\n\nâAn announcement is imminent,â Florence declared, so delighted that the lilt of Clontarf, usually rigorously suppressed, insinuated itself into her tone.\n\nBeauregard was suddenly a prisoner in himself. With Penelope on his arm he could hardly refuse the fence, but the situation was instantly different. For some months, he had teetered on the brink of a chasm. Now, screaming inside, he plunged towards the doubtless jagged rocks.\n\nâPenelope, Miss Churchward,â Beauregard began, pausing then to clear his throat, âhas done me the honour...â\n\nEveryone in the parlour understood at once, but he still had to get the words out. He wished for another gulp of the pale tea Florence served in exquisite bowls, in the Chinese fashion.\n\nPenelope, impatient, finished for him. âWeâre to be married. In the Spring, next year.â\n\nShe slipped her slim hand about his own, gripping tight. When a child, her favourite expression had been âbut I want it now.â His face must be flushed scarlet. This was absurd. He hardly qualified as a swooning youth. He had been married before... Before Penelope, Pamela. The other Miss Churchward, the elder. That must cause remark.\n\nâCharles,â said Arthur Holmwood, Lord Godalming, âcongratulations.â\n\nThe vampire, smiling sharply, pumped his free hand. Beauregard assumed Godalming knew how bone-crushing was his un-dead grip.\n\nHis fiancÃ©e was detached from him and surrounded by ladies. Kate Reed, by virtue of her spectacles and unruly hair the perfect Penelopeâs favourite confidante, helped her sit and fanned her with admiration. She chided her friend for keeping the secret from her. Penelope, honey over salt, told Kate not to be such a drip. Kate, one of those new women, wrote articles about bicycling for Tit-Bits, being currently much excited by something called a âpneumatic tyreâ.\n\nPenelope was fussed over as if she had announced an illness, or an expected baby. Pamela, never far from mind when Penelope was present, had died in childbirth, her huge eyes screwed tight with pain. In Jagadhri, seven years ago. The child, a boy, had not survived his mother by a week. Beauregard did not care to remember that he had had to be dissuaded from shooting dead the fool of a station doctor.\n\nFlorence was conferring with Bessie, her one remaining maid. Mrs Stoker dispatched the dark-eyed girl on a private mission.\n\nWhistler, the grinning American painter, elbowed aside Godalming, and playfully thumped Beauregardâs arm.\n\nâThereâs no hope for you, Charlie,â he said, stabbing the air in front of Beauregardâs face with a fat cigar. âAnother good man fallen to the enemy.â\n\nBeauregard successfully sustained a smile. He had not intended to announce his engagement to Mrs Stokerâs after-dark gathering. Since his return to London, he had been less frequently a guest at the get-togethers. Florenceâs position as a hostess to the fashionable and noted remained secure, though the question of her vanished husband hovered about always. No one had the courage or the cruelty to enquire after Bram, who was rumoured to have been removed to Devilâs Dyke after an altercation with the Lord Chamberlain on a point of official censorship. Only the distinguished intervention of Henry Irving, Stokerâs employer, prevented Bramâs head from joining that of his friend Van Helsing outside the Palace. Lured by Penelope to this much-reduced gathering, Beauregard noted other absences. No vampires were present, aside from Godalming. Many of Florenceâs former guests â notably Irving and his leading lady, the incomparable Ellen Terry â had turned. Presumably others did not wish to associate even with the rumour of Republican sentiments, though the hostess, who encouraged debate at her after-darks, often made mention of her lack of interest in politics. Florence â whose tireless struggle to surround herself with men far more brilliant and women marginally less pretty than herself Beauregard had to admit he found faintly irritating â entertained no question about the right of the Queen to rule, no more than she would query the right of the earth to revolve around the sun.\n\nBessie returned with a dusty bottle of champagne. Everyone discreetly set down their tea-bowls and saucers. Florence gave the maid a tiny key and the girl opened a cabinet, disclosing a small forest of glasses.\n\nâThere must be a toast,â Florence insisted, âto Charles and Penelope.â\n\nPenelope was by his side again, holding fast his hand, showing him off.\n\nThe bottle was passed to Florence. She regarded it as if uncertain which end could be opened. She would normally have a butler to perform uncorking duties. Momentarily, she was lost. Godalming stepped in, moving with a quicksilver grace combining speed with apparent languor, and took the bottle. He was not the first vampire Beauregard had seen, but he was the most perceptibly changed since his turn. Most new-borns fumbled with their limitations and capabilities, but His Lordship, with the poise of generations of breeding, had adapted perfectly.\n\nâAllow me,â he said, draping a napkin over his arm like a waiter.\n\nâThank you, Art,â Florence babbled, âIâm so feeble...â\n\nHe flashed a one-sided smile, baring a long eye-tooth, and dug a fingernail into the cork, then flipped it out of the bottleneck as if tossing a coin. Champagne gushed and Godalming filled the glasses Florence held beneath the bottle. His Lordship accepted mild applause with a handsome grin. For a dead man, Godalming practically burst with life. Every woman in the room was fixated upon the vampire. Not entirely excluding Penelope, he could not help but notice.\n\nHis fiancÃ©e did not much resemble her cousin. Except sometimes, when, catching him unaware, she would produce some phrase of Pamelaâs or make a trivial gesture that exactly duplicated a mannerism of his late wifeâs. Of course, there were also the Churchward mouth and those eyes. When he first married, eleven years previously, Penelope had been nine. He recollected a somewhat nasty child in a pinafore and sailor hat, deftly manipulating her family so the household revolved around her axis. He remembered sitting on the terrace with Pamela, and watching little Penny taunt the gardenerâs boy to tears. His bride-to-be still had a sharp tongue sheathed in her velvet mouth.\n\nGlasses were distributed. Penelope managed to accept hers without for a moment leaving go of his hand. She had her prize and would not let it escape.\n\nThe toast fell, of course, to Godalming. He raised his glass, bubbles catching the light, and said, âfor me this is a sad moment, as I experience a loss. Iâve been beaten out again, by my good friend Charles Beauregard. I shall never recover, but I acknowledge Charles as the better man. I trust he will serve my dearest Penny as a good husband should.â\n\nBeauregard, cynosure of all eyes, experienced discomfort. He did not like to be looked at. In his profession, it was unwise to attract notice of any kind.\n\nâTo the beautiful Penelope,â Godalming toasted, âand the admirable Charles...â\n\nâPenelope and Charles,â came the echo.\n\nPenelope giggled like a cat as the bubbles tickled her nose, and Beauregard took an unexpectedly healthy swig. Everyone drank except Godalming, who set his glass down untouched on the tray.\n\nâI am so sorry,â Florence said, âI was forgetting myself.â\n\nThe hostess summoned Bessie again.\n\nâLord Godalming does not drink champagne,â she explained to the girl. Bessie understood and unbuttoned her blouse at the wrist.\n\nâThank you, Bessie,â Godalming said. He took her hand as if to kiss it, then turned it over as if to read her palm.\n\nBeauregard could not help but feel slightly sickened, but no one else even made mention of the matter. He wondered how many were assuming a pose of indifference, and how many were genuinely accustomed to the habits of the thing Arthur Holmwood had become.\n\nâPenelope, Charles,â Godalming said, âI drink to you...â\n\nOpening his mouth wide on jaw-hinges like a cobraâs, Godalming fastened on to Bessieâs wrist, lightly puncturing the skin with his pointed incisors. Godalming licked away a trickle of blood. The company were fascinated. Penelope shrank closer to Beauregardâs side. She pressed her cheek to his shoulder but did not look away from Godalming and the maid. Either she was affecting cool or the vampireâs feeding did not bother her. As Godalming lapped, Bessie swayed unsteadily on her ankles. Her eyes fluttered with something between pain and pleasure. Finally, the maid quietly fainted and Godalming, letting her wrist go, caught her deftly like a devoted Don Juan, holding her upright.\n\nâI have this effect on women,â he said, teeth blood-rimmed, âit is most inconvenient.â\n\nHe found a divan and deposited the unconscious Bessie on it. The girlâs wound did not bleed. Godalming did not appear to have taken much from her. Beauregard thought she must have been bled before to take it so calmly. Florence, who had so easily offered Godalming the hospitality of her maid, sat beside Bessie and bound a handkerchief around her wrist. She performed the operation as if tying a ribbon to a horse, with kindness but no especial concern.\n\nFor a moment, Beauregard was dizzy.\n\nâWhat is it, dear-heart,â Penelope asked, arm sliding around him.\n\nâThe champagne,â he lied.\n\nâWill we always have champagne?â\n\nâAs long as it is what you wish to drink.â\n\nâYouâre so good to me, Charles.â\n\nâPerhaps.â\n\nFlorence, her nursing done, was swarming around them again.\n\nâNow, now,â she said, âthereâll be plenty of time for that after the wedding. In the meantime, you must be unselfish and share yourselves with the rest of us.â\n\nâIndeed,â said Godalming. âFor a start, I must claim my right as the vanquished sir knight.â\n\nBeauregard was puzzled. Godalming had blotted the blood from his lips with a handkerchief, but his mouth still shone, and there was a pinkish tinge to his upper teeth.\n\nâA kiss,â Godalming explained, taking Penelopeâs hands in his own, âI claim a kiss from the bride.â\n\nBeauregardâs hand, fortunately out of Godalmingâs view, made a fist, as if grasping the handle of his sword-stick. He sensed danger, as surely as in the Natal when a black mamba, the deadliest reptile on earth, was close by his unprotected leg. A discreet cut with a blade had separated the snakeâs venomous head from the remainder of its length before harm could come to him. Then he had good cause to be thankful for his nerves; now, he told himself he was overreacting.\n\nGodalming drew Penelope close and she turned her cheek to his mouth. For a long second, he pressed his lips to her face. Then, he released her.\n\nThe others, men and women, gathered around, offering more kisses. Penelope was almost swamped with adoration. She wore it well. He had never seen her prettier, or more like Pamela.\n\nâCharles,â said Kate Reed, approaching him, âyou know... um, congratulations... that sort of thing. Excellent news.â\n\nThe poor girl was blushing scarlet, forehead completely damp.\n\nâKatie, thank you.â\n\nHe kissed her cheek, and she said âgoshâ.\n\nHalf-grinning, she indicated Penelope. âMust go, Charles. Penny wants...â\n\nShe was summoned over to examine the marvellous ring upon Penelopeâs dainty finger.\n\nBeauregard and Godalming were by the window, apart from the group. Outside, the moon was up, a faint glow above the fog. Beauregard could see the railings of the Stoker house, but little else. His own home was further down Cheyne Walk; a swirling yellow wall obscured it as if it no longer existed.\n\nâSincerely, Charles,â Godalming said, âmy congratulations. You and Penny must be happy. It is an order.â\n\nâArt, thank you.â\n\nâWe need more like you,â the vampire said. âYou must turn soon. Things are just getting exciting.â\n\nThis had been raised before. Beauregard held back.\n\nâAnd Penny too,â Godalming insisted. âShe is lovely. Loveliness should not be permitted to fade. That would be criminal.â\n\nâWe shall think about it.â\n\nâDo not think too long. The years fly.â\n\nBeauregard wished he had a drink stronger than champagne. Close to Godalming, he could almost taste the new-bornâs breath. It was untrue that vampires exhaled a stinking cloud. But there was something in the air, at once sweet and sharp. And in the centres of Godalmingâs eyes, red points sometimes appeared like tiny drops of blood.\n\nâPenelope would like a family.â Vampires, Beauregard knew, could not give birth in the conventional manner.\n\nâChildren?â Godalming said, fixing his gaze on Beauregard. âIf you can live forever, surely children are superfluous to requirements.â\n\nBeauregard was uncomfortable now. In truth, he was unsure about a family. His profession was uncertain, and after what had happened with Pamela...\n\nHe was tired in his head, as if Godalming were leeching his vitality. Some vampires could take sustenance without drinking blood, absorbing the energies of others through psychical osmosis.\n\nâWe need men of your sort, Charles. We have an opportunity to make the country strong. Your skills will be needed.â\n\nIf Lord Godalming had an idea of the skills he had developed in the service of the Crown, Beauregard supposed the vampire would be surprised. Since India, he had been in Shanghai, at the International Settlement, and in Egypt, working under Lord Cromer. The new-born laid a hand upon his arm, and gripped almost fiercely. He could hardly feel his own fingers.\n\nâThere will never be slaves in Britain,â Godalming continued, âbut those who stay warm will naturally serve us, as the excellent Bessie has just served me. Have a care, lest you wind up the equivalent of some damned regimental water-bearer.â\n\nâIn India, I knew a water-bearer who was a better man than most.â\n\nFlorence came to his rescue, and guided them back into the mainstream. Whistler was recounting the latest instalment of his continuing feud with John Ruskin, savagely lampooning the critic. Grateful to be eclipsed, Beauregard stood near a wall and watched the painter perform. Whistler, accustomed to being the âstarâ of Florenceâs after-darks, was obviously happy the distraction of Beauregardâs announcement had passed. Penelope was lost somewhere in the crowd.\n\nHe had cause to wonder again whether he had selected a proper path, or even if the decision had been his own to take. He was the victim of a conspiracy to entrap him in the webs of femininity, orchestrated between China tea and lace doilies. The London to which he had returned in May differed vastly from that he had left three years ago. A patriotic painting hung above the mantel: Victoria, plump and young again, and her fiercely moustachioed, red-eyed consort. The unknown artist posed no threat to Whistlerâs pre-eminence. Charles Beauregard served his Queen; he supposed he must also serve her husband.\n\nThe doorbell rang just as Whistler made an amusing speculation, perhaps unsuited to predominantly feminine company, regarding the long-ago annulment of his hated enemyâs marriage. Irritated at the interruption, the painter resumed his flow as Florence, herself irritated because Bessie was unavailable for the menial task, hurried off to answer her door.\n\nBeauregard noticed Penelope sitting near the front, laughing prettily as she pretended to understand Whistlerâs insinuations. Godalming stood behind her chair, wrists crossed under his evening coat in the small of his back, the sharp points of his fingers dimpling out the cloth. Arthur Holmwood was no longer the man Beauregard had known when he left England. There had been a scandal, shortly before his turning. Like Bram Stoker, Godalming had sided with the wrong lot when the Prince Consort first came to London. Now he had to prove his loyalty to the new regime.\n\nâCharles,â Florence said, quietly enough not to interrupt Whistler further. âThere is a man for you. From your club.â\n\nShe gave him a calling card. It bore the name of no individual, just the simple words. THE DIOGENES CLUB.\n\nâThis is in the nature of a summons,â he explained. âMake my apologies to Penelope.â\n\nâCharles...?â\n\nHe was in the hallway, Florence following close behind. He took his own cloak, hat and cane. Bessie would not be up to her duties for a while yet. He hoped, for the sake of Florenceâs dignity, the maid would be available to see to the guests when the time came for their departure.\n\nâIâm sure Art will see Penelope home,â he said, instantly regretting the suggestion. âOr Miss Reed.â\n\nâIs this serious? Iâm sure you donât have to leave so soon...â\n\nThe messenger, a close-mouthed fellow, waited out in the street, a carriage at the kerb beside him.\n\nâMy time is not always my own, Florence.â He kissed her hand. âI thank you for your courtesy and kindness.â\n\nHe left the Stoker house, stepped across the pavement, and climbed up into the carriage. The messenger, who had been holding the nearside door open, joined him. The driver knew their intended destination, and immediately set off. Beauregard saw Florence closing her door against the cold. The fog thickened and he looked away from the house, settling in to the steady motion of the carriage. The messenger said nothing. Although a summons from the Diogenes Club could mean no good news, Beauregard was relieved to be out of Florenceâs parlour and away from the company.\n\n4\n\nCOMMERCIAL STREET BLUES\n\nAt Commercial Street Police Station, Lestrade introduced her to Frederick Abberline. At the sufferance of Assistant Commissioner Dr Robert Anderson and Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, Inspector Abberline had charge of the continuing investigation. Having pursued the Polly Nichols and Annie Chapman cases with his customary tenacity but without notable results, the warm detective was now saddled with Lulu SchÃ¶n, and any yet to come.\n\nâIf I can help in any way,â GeneviÃ¨ve offered.\n\nâListen to her, Fred,â Lestrade said, âsheâs wise to the ways.â\n\nAbberline, obviously unimpressed, knew it was politic to be polite. Like GeneviÃ¨ve, he could not see why Lestrade wanted her dogging the case.\n\nâThink of her as an expert,â Lestrade said. âShe knows vampires. And this case comes down to vampires.â\n\nThe inspector waved the offer aside, but one of the several sergeants in the room â William Thick, whom they called âJohnny Uprightâ â nodded agreement. He had interviewed GeneviÃ¨ve after the first murder, and seemed as fair and smart as his reputation would have him, even if his taste in suits did run to lamentable checks.\n\nâSilver Knife is definitely a vampire-slayer,â Thick put in. âNot some rip-merchant killing to cover theft.â\n\nâWe donât know that,â Abberline snapped, âand I donât want to read it in the Police Gazette.â\n\nThick kept quiet, satisfied that he was right. In their interview, the sergeant admitted his personal belief was that Silver Knife imagined he had been wronged â or, more likely, actually had been wronged â by Vlad Tepesâs get. GeneviÃ¨ve, expert enough to know the capabilities of her kind, agreed, but knew the description fit so many in London that it would be fruitless to extrapolate a list of suspects from the theory.\n\nâI believe Sergeant Thick is right,â she told the policemen.\n\nLestrade assented, but Abberline turned away to give an order to his own pet sergeant, George Godley. GeneviÃ¨ve smiled at Thick and saw him shiver. Like most of the warm, he knew even less about bloodline, about the infinite varieties and gradations of vampire, than the Prince Consortâs glut of new-borns. Thick looked at her and saw a vampire... just like the bloodsucker who had turned his daughter, violated his wife, taken his promotion, killed his friend. She didnât know his history but supposed his theory formed by personal experience, that he guessed the murdererâs motive because he could understand it.\n\nAbberline had spent the day interrogating the constables who were first at the scene of the murder, then going over the ground himself. He had not immediately discovered anything of any relevance and was even holding off on committing to a statement that SchÃ¶n was indeed another victim of the so-called Whitechapel Murderer. On the short walk from Toynbee Hall, they had heard newsboys shouting about Silver Knife; but the official flannel was that only Chapman and Nichols were demonstrably dead by the same hand. Various other unsolved cases â SchÃ¶n now joining Tabram, Smith and sundry others â linked in the press could conceivably be entirely separate crimes. Silver Knife hardly held the patent on homicide, even in the immediate locality.\n\nLestrade and Abberline went off to have a huddle. Abberline â without realising it? â elaborately came up with other things to do with his hands whenever the possibility of pressing flesh with a vampire was raised. He lit a pipe and listened as Lestrade ticked off points on his fingers. A jurisdictional dispute was in the offing between Abberline, head of H Division CID, and Lestrade. The Scotland Yard interloper was assumed to be one of Dr Andersonâs spies, dispatched by Swanson to check up on the detectives in the field, ready to swoop in whenever glory was to be claimed but anonymous if results were lacking. Anderson, Swanson and Lestrade were the Irishman, the Scotsman and the Englishman of the music hall stories, and had been pictured as such by Weedon Grossmith in Punch, traipsing over a murder site and obliterating clues to the annoyance of a local copper who somewhat resembled Fred Abberline. GeneviÃ¨ve wondered if she, hardly the epitome of the French girl from the same stories, fitted into the scheme. Did Lestrade intend her for a lever?\n\nShe looked about the already busy reception room. The doors pushed open constantly, admitting foggy draughts, and banged shut. Outside were several groups of interested parties. A Salvation Army band, flying the Cross of St George, supported a Christian Crusade preacher who called down Godâs Justice on vampirekind, upholding Silver Knife as a true instrument of the Will of Christ. The Speakersâ Corner Torquemada was heckled by a few professional insurrectionists, ragged-trousered longhairs of various socialist or Republican stripes, and ridiculed by a knot of painted vampire women, who offered expensive kisses and a quick turning. Many new-borns paid to become some street tartâs get, purchasing immortality for as little as a shilling.\n\nâWhoâs the reverend gentleman?â GeneviÃ¨ve asked Thick.\n\nThe sergeant glanced out at the mob and groaned. âA bloody nuisance, Miss. Name of John Jago, so he says.â\n\nThe Jago was a notorious slum at the upper end of Brick Lane, a criminal jungle of tiny courts and overpopulated rooms. It was undoubtedly the worst rookery in the East End.\n\nâAny rate, thatâs where he comes from. He talks up an inferno, makes them all feel righteous and proper about shoving a stake through some trollop. Heâs been in and out of here all year for fire-breathing. And drunk and disorderly, with the odd common assault tossed in.â\n\nJago was a wild-eyed fanatic but some of the crowd listened to him. A few years ago, he would have been preaching against the Jews, or Fenians, or the Heathen Chinee. Now, it was vampires.\n\nâFire and the stake,â Jago cried. âThe unclean leeches, the cast-outs of Hell, the blood-bloated filth. All must perish by fire and the stake. All must be purified.â\n\nThe preacher had a few men soliciting donations in caps. They were rough-looking enough to blur the line between extortion and collection.\n\nâHeâs not short of a few pennies,â Thick commented.\n\nâEnough to get his bread-knife silver-plated?â\n\nThick had already thought of that. âFive Christian Crusaders claim he was preaching his little heart out to them just when Polly Nichols was being gutted. Same for Annie Chapman. And last nightâs too, Iâll lay odds.â\n\nâStrange hours for a sermon?â\n\nâBetween two and three in the morning, and five and six for the second job,â Thick agreed. âDoes seem a trifle too done up in pink string and sealing wax, doesnât it? Still, we all have to be night-birds now.â\n\nâYou probably stay up all night regularly. Would you want to listen to God and Glory at five oâclock?â\n\nâItâs darkest just before dawn, they say.â Thick snorted, and added, âbesides, I wouldnât listen to John Jago at any hour of the day or night. Especially on a Sunday.â\n\nThick stepped out and mingled with the crowd, getting the feel of the situation. GeneviÃ¨ve, at a loose end, wondered whether she should be getting back to the Hall. The desk sergeant checked his watch and gave the order to turn out the stationâs regulars. A group of shabby men and women were let out of the cells, marginally more sober than they had been when they were pulled in. They lined up to be officially set free. GeneviÃ¨ve recognised most of them: there were plenty â warm and vampire â who spent their nights shuffling between the holding cells, the Workhouse Infirmary and Toynbee Hall, in the constant search for a bed and a free feed.\n\nâMiss Dee,â said a woman, âMiss Dee...â\n\nA lot of people had trouble pronouncing âDieudonnÃ©â, so she often used her initial. Like many in Whitechapel, she had more names than the usual.\n\nâCathy,â she said, acknowledging the new-born, âare you being well treated?â\n\nâLoverly, miss, loverly,â she said, simpering at the desk sergeant, âitâs an âome from âome.â\n\nCathy Eddowes looked hardly better as a vampire than sheâd done when warm. Gin and nights outdoors had raddled her; the red shine in her eyes and on her hair didnât outweigh the mottled skin under her heavy powder. Like many on the streets, Cathy still exchanged her body for drink. Her customersâ blood was probably as alcohol-heavy as the gin which had been her warm ruin. The new-born primped her hair, arranging a red ribbon that kept her tight curls away from her wide face. There was a running sore on the back of her hand.\n\nâLet me look at that, Cathy.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve had seen marks like these. New-borns had to be careful. They were stronger than the warm, but too much of their diet was tainted. Disease was still a danger; the Prince Consortâs Dark Kiss, at whatever remove, did something strange to diseases a person happened to carry over from warm life to their un-dead state.\n\nâDo you have many of these sores?â\n\nCathy shook her head but GeneviÃ¨ve knew she meant yes. A clear fluid was weeping from the red patch on the back of her hand. Damp marks on her tight bodice suggested more. She wore her scarf in an unnatural fashion, covering her neck and the upper part of her breasts. GeneviÃ¨ve peeled the wool away from several glistening sores and smelled the pungent discharge. Something was wrong, but Cathy Eddowes was superstitiously afraid of finding out what it was.\n\nâYou must call in at the Hall tonight. See Dr Seward. Heâs a better man than youâd get at the Infirmary. Something can be done for your condition. I promise you.â\n\nâIâll be all right, love.â\n\nâNot unless you get treatment, Cathy.â\n\nCathy tried to laugh and tottered out on to the streets. One of her boot-heels was gone, so she had a comical limp. She held up her head, wrapping the scarf around her like a duchessâs fur stole, and wiggled provocatively past Jagoâs Christian Crusade, slipping into the fog.\n\nâDead in a year,â remarked the desk sergeant, a new-born with a snout-like protrusion in the centre of his face.\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve said, âNot if I can help it.â\n\n5\n\nTHE DIOGENES CLUB\n\nBeauregard was admitted into the unexceptional foyer off Pall Mall. Through the doors of this institution passed the cityâs most unsociable and unclubbable men. The greatest collection of eccentrics, misanthropes, grotesques and unconfined lunatics outside the House of Lords was to be found on its membership lists. He handed over gloves, hat, cloak and cane to the silent valet, who arranged them on a rack in an alcove. While deferentially slipping off Beauregardâs cloak, the valet subtly established that he was carrying no concealed revolver or dagger.\n\nOstensibly for the convenience of that species of individual who yearns to live in monied isolation from his fellows, this unassuming establishment on the fringes of Whitehall was actually much more. Absolute quiet was the rule; violators who so much as muttered under their breath while solving a crossword puzzle were mercilessly expelled without refund of their annual dues. A single squeak of marginally inferior boot-leather was enough to put a clubman on probation for five years. Members who had known each other by sight for sixty years were entirely unaware of one anotherâs identity. It was, of course, absurd and impractical. Beauregard imagined the situation which would eventuate were a fire to break out in the reading room: members stubbornly sitting in the smoke, none daring to call out an alert as the flames rose around them.\n\nConversation was permitted in only two areas, the Strangersâ Room, where clubmen occasionally entertained indispensable guests, and, far less famously, in the sound-proofed suite on the top floor. This was set aside for the use of the clubâs ruling cabal, a group of persons connected, mostly in minor official capacities, with Her Majestyâs Government. The ruling cabal consisted of five worthies, each serving in rotation as chairman. In the fourteen years Beauregard had been at the disposal of the Diogenes Club, nine men had served on the cabal. When a member passed on and was discreetly replaced, it was always overnight.\n\nAs he was kept waiting, Beauregard was carefully watched by unseen eyes. During the Fenian Dynamite Campaign, Ivan Dragomiloff had penetrated the Club, intent on executing a commission to exterminate the entire ruling cabal. Detained in the foyer by a porter, the soi-disant ethical assassin had been noiselessly garrotted so as not to offend the sensibilities or excite the interest of the ordinary members. After a minute or two â no ticking clocks disturbed the peace â the valet, as if acting on telepathic command, lifted the purple rope that barred the unremarkable staircase leading directly to the top floor, and gave Beauregard the nod.\n\nOn the stairs, he remembered the several times he had been summoned before the ruling cabal. Such a call inevitably resulted in a voyage to some far corner of the world, and involved confidential matters affecting the interests of Great Britain. Beauregard supposed he was something between a diplomat and a courier, although he had at times been required to be an explorer, a burglar, an impostor, or a civil servant. Sometimes the business of the Diogenes Club was known in the outside world as the Great Game. The invisible business of government â conducted not in parliaments or palaces but in Bombay alleys and Riviera gambling hells â had afforded him a varied and intriguing career, even if it was of such a nature that he could hardly profit in his retirement by writing his memoirs.\n\nWhile he had been away pursuing this Great Game, Vlad Dracula had taken London. Prince of Wallachia and King of Vampires, he had wooed and won Victoria, persuading her to abandon her widowâs black. Then he had reshaped the greatest Empire on the globe to suit his tastes. Beauregard had vowed death would not interfere with his loyalty to the Queenâs person, but he had thought he meant his own death.\n\nThe carpeted stairs did not creak. The thick walls admitted no noise from the bustling city without. Venturing into the Diogenes Club was like sampling deafness.\n\nThe Prince Consort, who had taken for himself the additional title of Lord Protector, ruled Great Britain now, his get executing his wishes and whims. An elite Carpathian Guard patrolled the grounds of Buckingham Palace and caroused throughout the West End like sacred terrors. The army, the navy, the diplomatic corps, the police and the church were all in Draculaâs thrall, new-borns promoted over the warm at every opportunity. While much continued as always, there were changes: people vanished from public and private life, camps such as Devilâs Dyke springing up in remote areas of the country, and the apparatus of a government â secret police, sudden arrests, casual executions â he associated not with the Queen but with Tsars and Shahs. There were Republican bands playing Robin Hood in the wilds of Scotland and Ireland, and cross-waving curates were always trying to brand new-born provincial mayors with the mark of Cain.\n\nOn the top landing was a man with a military moustache and a neck the thickness of his head, even in civvies the absolute image of a sergeant-major. Beauregard passed inspection and the guard opened the familiar green door, stepping aside to allow the clubman to enter. He was inside the suite sometimes referred to as âthe Star Chamberâ before a realisation sank in: Sergeant Dravot, the man on guard, was a vampire, the first he had seen within the walls of the Diogenes Club. For a horrid, sinking moment, he assumed his eyes would get used to the gloom within the Star Chamber and alight upon five bloated leeches, sharp-fanged horrors ruddy with stolen blood. If the ruling cabal of the Diogenes Club had fallen, the long reign of the living would genuinely be at an end.\n\nâBeauregard,â came a voice, normally pitched but sounding, even after only a minute in the silence of the Club, like a thunderclap from God. His moment of fear passed, replaced by a mild puzzlement. There were no vampires in the room, but things were changed.\n\nâMr Chairman,â he acknowledged.\n\nIt was convention not to address any of the cabal by name or title in their suite, but Beauregard knew he faced Sir Mandeville Messervy, a supposedly retired admiral who had made his name in the suppression, twenty years earlier, of the Slave Trade in the Indian Ocean. Also present were Mycroft, an enormously corpulent gentleman who had been chairman on Beauregardâs last visit, and Waverly, an avuncular figure Beauregard understood to be personally responsible for the downfall of Colonel Ahmad Arabi and the occupation of Cairo in 1882. There were two empty seats at the round table.\n\nâAlas, you find us depleted. There have, as you know, been changes. The Diogenes Club is not what it was.â\n\nâA cigarette?â offered Waverly, producing a silverwork case and offering it.\n\nBeauregard declined but Waverly tossed him the case anyway. He was fast enough to catch it and return it. Waverly smiled as he slipped the case into his breast pocket.\n\nâCold silver,â he explained.\n\nâThere was no need for that,â said Messervy. âI apologise. Still, it was an effective demonstration.â\n\nâI am not a vampire,â Beauregard said, showing his unburned fingers. âThat much should be obvious.â\n\nâTheyâre tricky, Beauregard,â said Waverly.\n\nâYou have one outside, you know.â\n\nâDravot is a special case.â\n\nFormerly, Beauregard had considered the ruling cabal of the Diogenes Club impregnable, the ever-beating lion-heart of Britannia. Now, not for the first time since his return from abroad, he was forced to realise how radically the country was altered.\n\nâThat was a fine piece of work in Shanghai, Beauregard,â the chairman commented. âVery deft. As we have come to expect of you.â\n\nâThank you, Mr Chairman.â\n\nâIt will be some years, I believe, before we hear again of those yellow devils in the Si-Fan.â\n\nâI wish I shared your confidence.â\n\nMesservy nodded sagely. The criminal tong was as impossible to root out and destroy as any other common weed.\n\nWaverly had a small pile of folders in front of him. âYouâre a well-travelled man,â he said. âAfghanistan, Mexico, the Transvaal.â\n\nBeauregard agreed, wondering where he was being led.\n\nâYouâve been of great service to the Crown in many situations. But now we need you closer to home. Very close.â\n\nMycroft, who might have been sleeping with his eyes open for all the attention he seemed to pay, now leaned forwards. The current chairman was obviously so used to deferring to his colleague that he sat back and allowed him to take over.\n\nâBeauregard,â said Mycroft, âhave you heard of the murders in Whitechapel? The so-called Silver Knife killings?â\n\n6\n\nPANDORAâS BOX\n\nâWhatâs to be done?â shouted a new-born in a peaked cap. âWhatâs to stop this fiend slaughtering more of our women?â\n\nCoroner Wynne Baxter angrily tried to keep control of the inquest. A pompous, middle-aged politician, GeneviÃ¨ve understood him to be unpopular. Unlike a High Court judge, he had no gavel and so was forced to slap his wooden desk with an open hand.\n\nâAny further interruptions of this nature,â Baxter said, glaring, âand I shall be forced to clear the public from the room.â\n\nThe surly rough, who must have looked hungry even when warm, slouched back to his bench. He was surrounded by a similar crew. She knew the type: long scarves, ragged coats, pockets distended by books, heavy boots and thin beards. Whitechapel had all manner of Republican, anarchist, socialist and insurrectionist factions.\n\nâThank you,â said the coroner ironically, rearranging his notes. The troublemaker bared his fangs and muttered. New-borns disliked situations where someone warm had the authority. But a lifetime of cringing when officials frowned left habits.\n\nThis was the second day of the inquest. Yesterday, GeneviÃ¨ve had sat at the back of the Hall while sundry witnesses gave testimony relating to Lulu SchÃ¶nâs origins and movements. She had been out of the ordinary among East End streetwalkers. Countess Geschwitz, a mannish vampire who claimed to have come from Germany with the girl, blurted out something of Luluâs history: a procession of acquired names, dubious associations and dead husbands. If born with a real name, no one knew it. According to a telegraph from Berlin, the German police still wanted to talk to her in connection with the shooting of one of her more recent husbands. All the witnesses â including Geschwitz, who had turned her â were transparently in love with Lulu, or at least desired her beyond all reason. Evidently the new-born could have been one of les Grandes Horizontales of Europe, but foolishness and ill fortune had reduced her to fourpenny knee-tremblers in Londonâs meaner streets and finally delivered her to the sharp mercies of Silver Knife.\n\nThroughout the testimony, Lestrade muttered about opening up Pandoraâs Box. It was almost certain the only connection between the Whitechapel Murderer and his victims came at the point of their deaths, but the police investigation could not afford to overlook the possibility that these were pre-meditated killings of specific women. Back in Commercial Street, Abberline, Thick and the others were assembling and cross-referencing biographies, more exhaustively detailed than any life of a great statesman, of Nichols, Chapman and SchÃ¶n. If any connection could be established between the women, beyond the fact that they were all vampire prostitutes, then that might lead to their killer.\n\nAs the inquest, commenced in the early afternoon, proceeded into the evening, Baxter had turned his attention to SchÃ¶nâs doings on the night of her death. Geschwitz, face red from a recent feeding, said Lulu had left their attic some time between three and four in the morning. The body had been discovered by Constable George Neve, walking his beat shortly after six. After finishing Lulu, presumably in plain sight on Chicksand Street, the murderer had dumped her on the doorstep of a basement flat. A family of Polish Jews, of whom only the littlest child could speak anything approaching English, had been inside. They all stated, as translated by the tiny girl after a Yiddish babel of argument, not to have heard anything until Constable Neve roused them by practically battering down their door. Rebecca Kosminksi, the self-assured spokeswoman, was the only vampire in the family. GeneviÃ¨ve had seen her kind before; Melissa dâAcques, who had turned Chandagnac, was one. Rebecca might live to become the all-powerful matriarch of her extended clan, but she would never grow up.\n\nLestrade fidgeted throughout, describing it cruelly as âcomedy relief â. He would rather have been out combing the crime scene than sitting on a hardwood bench made for the tough bottoms and short legs of twelve-year-olds, but he could not get in Fred Abberlineâs way too often. He gloomily told GeneviÃ¨ve that Baxter was known for the length of his inquests. The coronerâs approach was characterised by an obsessive, not to say tedious, insistence on dragging out irrelevant details and the flamboyant off-handedness of his summings-up. In his closing remarks on Anne Chapman, Baxter had invented the theory, on the basis of gossip overheard at the Middlesex Hospital, that an American doctor was either the murderer or the employer of the murderer. The unknown doctor, researching the physiognomy of the un-dead, was rumoured to have offered twenty guineas for a fresh vampire heart. There had been a brief flurry of activity as Abberline tried to locate the foreigner, but it turned out vampire hearts, mainly somewhat damaged, could be unethically purchased from mortuaries for as little as sixpence.\n\nBaxter had adjourned before midnight, and reconvened the inquest this morning. Now evidence from the post-mortem was available, and todayâs business mainly concerned a succession of medical men, all of whom had crammed themselves into Whitechapel Workhouse Infirmary Mortuary to examine the mortal remains of Lulu SchÃ¶n.\n\nFirst came Dr George Bagster Phillips, the H Division Police Surgeon â well known at Toynbee Hall â who had done the preliminary examination of the body in Chicksand Street and performed the more detailed post-mortem. It boiled down to the simple facts that Lulu SchÃ¶n had been heart-stabbed, disembowelled and decapitated. It took much desk-banging to quieten the outrage that followed these not unexpected revelations.\n\nBy law, inquests had to be held in public places and be open to the press. From the several appearances GeneviÃ¨ve had made as a witness in connection with the deaths of paupers in Toynbee Hall beds, she knew the only audience was usually a bored stringer from the Central News Agency, with the occasional friend or relation of the deceased. But the lecture hall was even more thickly populated today than it had been yesterday, the benches as heavily burdened as if Con Donovan were on the stage, rematching with Monk for the Featherweight Title. Aside from the reporters hogging the front row, GeneviÃ¨ve noticed a gaggle of haggard mainly un-dead women in colourful dresses, a scattering of well-dressed men, some of Lestradeâs uniformed juniors, and a sprinkling of sensation-seekers, clergymen and social reformers.\n\nIn the centre of the room, spaces all around unoccupied despite the surplus of attendees, sat a long-haired vampire warrior. Not a new-born, he wore the uniform, including a steel breastplate, of the Prince Consortâs Own Carpathian Guard, augmented by a tasselled fez. His face was withered white parchment but his eyes, blood-red marbles set in the dead waste of skin, constantly twitched.\n\nâDo you know who that is?â Lestrade asked.\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve did. âKostaki, one of Vlad Tepesâs hangers-on.â\n\nâThat sort gives me the creeps,â commented the new-born detective. âThe elders.â\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve almost laughed. Kostaki was younger than she. His presence was almost certainly not due to mere curiosity. The Palace was taking an interest in Silver Knife.\n\nâPeople die every night in Whitechapel, in ways Vlad Tepes couldnât devise, or live lives worse than any death,â GeneviÃ¨ve said, âyet from one yearâs end to the next, London pretends weâre as remote as Borneo. But give them a handful of gory murders and you canât move for sightseers and prurient philanthropists.â\n\nâMaybe some good will come of it,â Lestrade commented.\n\nDr Bagster Phillips was thanked and dismissed, and Baxter called for Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.CL., LL.D., F.R.S., etc. A dignified, smooth-faced man of fifty, obviously once handsome, approached the lectern and took the oath.\n\nâWhenever a vampireâs killed,â Lestrade explained, âJekyll comes creeping round. Something rum about him, if you get my drift...â\n\nThe scientific researcher, who first gave a detailed and anatomically precise description of the atrocities, was warm only in the sense that he was not a vampire. Dr Jekyll was self-controlled to a point that suggested a disturbing lack of empathy with the human subject of the inquest, but GeneviÃ¨ve listened with interest â certainly more than that expressed by the yawning reporters in the front row â to the comments Baxter solicited from him.\n\nâWe have not learned enough about the precise changes in the human metabolism that accompany the so-called âturnâ from normal life to the un-dead state. Precise information is hard to come by, and superstition hangs like a London fog over the subject. My studies have been checked by official indifference, even hostility. We could all benefit from research. Perhaps the divisions which lead to tragic incidents like the death of this girl could then be erased from our society.â\n\nThe anarchists were grumbling again. Without divisions, their cause would have no purpose.\n\nâToo much of what we believe about vampirism is sheer folklore,â Dr Jekyll continued. âThe stake through the heart, the silver scythe. The vampire corpus is remarkably resilient, but any major breach of the vital organs seems to produce true death, as here.â\n\nBaxter hummed and questioned the doctor. âSo the murderer has not, in your opinion, followed what we might deem the standard superstitious practice of the vampire killer?â\n\nâIndeed. I should like to put certain facts into the record, if only to provide a definitive contradiction of irresponsible journalism.â\n\nSome of the reporters hooted quietly. A lightning sketch artist sitting in directly in front of GeneviÃ¨ve was deftly portraying Dr Jekyll for reproduction in the illustrated press. He pencilled in some dark shadows under the witnessâs eyes to make him look more untrustworthy.\n\nâAs with Nichols and Chapman, SchÃ¶n was not penetrated with a wooden stake or paling. Her mouth was not stuffed with cloves of garlic, or fragments of communion wafer, or pages torn from a sacred text. No crucifix or cruciform object was found on or near the body. The dampness of her skirts and the residue of water on her face were almost certainly condensation from the fog. It is highly unlikely that the body was sprinkled with holy water.â\n\nThe artist, probably the man from the Police Gazette, drew in heavy eyebrows and tried to make Dr Jekyllâs thick but immaculately combed hair look shaggy. He went too far in distorting his subject and, tutting at his overenthusiasm, tore the sheet off his pad, crumpled it into his pocket, and began afresh.\n\nBaxter jotted down some notes, and resumed his questioning. âWould you venture that the murderer was familiar with the workings of the human body, whether of a vampire or not?â\n\nâYes, coroner. The extent of the injuries betokens a certain frenzy of enthusiasm, but the actual wounds â one might almost say incisions â have been wrought with some skill.â\n\nâSilver Knifeâs a bleedinâ doctor,â shouted the chief anarchist.\n\nThe court again exploded into uproar. The anarchists, about half-and-half warm and new-borns, stamped their feet and yelled, while others talked loudly among themselves. Kostaki looked around and silenced a pair of clergymen with a cold glare. Baxter hurt his hand hitting his desk.\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve noticed a man standing at the back of the courtroom observing the clamour with cool interest. Well-dressed, with a cloak and top hat, he might have been a sensation-seeker but for a certain air of purpose. He was not a vampire, but â unlike the coroner, or even Dr Henry Jekyll â he showed no signs of being disturbed to be among so many of the un-dead. He leant on a black cane.\n\nâWho is that?â she asked Lestrade.\n\nâCharles Beauregard,â the new-born detective said, curling a lip. âHave you heard of the Diogenes Club?â\n\nShe shook her head.\n\nâWhen they say âhigh placesâ, thatâs where they mean. Important people are taking an interest in this case. And Beauregard is their catspaw.â\n\nâA striking man.â\n\nâIf you say so, mademoiselle.â\n\nThe coroner had restored order again. A clerk had nipped out of the room and returned with six more constables, all new-borns. They lined the walls like an honour guard. The anarchists were brooding again, their purpose obviously to cause enough trouble to be an irritant but not enough to get their names noted.\n\nâIf I might be permitted to address the implied question raised by the gentleman,â Dr Jekyll asked, eliciting a nod from Baxter, âa knowledge of the position of the major organs does not necessarily betoken a medical education. If you are disinterested in preserving life, a butcher can have out a pair of kidneys as neatly as a surgeon. You need only a steady hand and a sharp knife, and there are plenty of both in Whitechapel.â\n\nâDo you have an opinion as to the instrument used by the murderer?â\n\nâA blade of some sort, obviously. Silvered.â\n\nThe word brought a collective gasp.\n\nâSteel or iron would not have done such damage,â Dr Jekyll continued. âVampire physiology is such that wounds inflicted with ordinary weapons heal almost immediately. Tissue and bone regenerate, just as a lizard may grow a new tail. Silver has a counteractive effect on this process. Only silver could do such permanent, fatal harm to a vampire. In this instance, the popular imagination, which has tagged the murderer as âSilver Knifeâ, has almost certainly got its facts straight.â\n\nâYou are familiar with the cases of Mary Ann Nichols and Eliza Anne Chapman?â asked Baxter.\n\nDr Jekyll nodded. âYes.â\n\nâHave you drawn any conclusions from a comparison of these incidents?â\n\nâIndeed. These three killings are indubitably the work of the same individual. A left-handed man of above average height, with more than normal physical strength...â\n\nâMr Holmes wouldâve been able to tell his motherâs maiden name from a fleck of cigar ash,â Lestrade muttered.\n\nâ... I would add that, considering the case from an alienistâs point of view, it is my belief that the murderer is not himself a vampire.â\n\nThe anarchist was on his feet but the coronerâs extra constables were around him before he could even shout. Smiling to himself at his subjugation of the court, Baxter made a note of the last point and thanked Dr Jekyll.\n\nGeneviÃ¨ve noticed that the man she had asked Lestrade about was gone. She wondered if Beauregard noticed her as she had noticed him. From her side, a connection had been made. She was either having one of her âinsightsâ or had gone too long without feeding. No, she was certain. The man from the Diogenes Club â whatever that really was â was materially involved in the affairs of the Whitechapel Murderer, but she could not guess in what capacity.\n\nThe coroner began his elaborate summing-up, delivering the verdict of âwilful murder by person or persons unknownâ, adding that the killer of Lulu SchÃ¶n was judged to be the same man who had murdered, on 31st of August, Mary Ann Nichols, and, on 8th of September, Eliza Anne Chapman.\n\n7\n\nTHE PRIME MINISTER\n\nâWere you aware,â began Lord Ruthven, âthat there are people in these isles whose sole objection to the marriage of our dear Queen â Victoria Regina, Empress of India, et cetera â to Vlad Dracula â known as Tepes, quondam Prince of Wallachia â is that the happy bridegroom happened once to be, in a fashion I shanât pretend to understand, a Roman Catholic?â\n\nThe Prime Minister waved a letter selected apparently at random from the piles of ignored correspondence littering the several desks in his Downing Street receiving room. Godalming knew better than to interrupt one of Ruthvenâs fits of loquacity. For a new-born eager to be initiated into the secrets of the elders, close attention to the centuries-old peer was a valuable, indeed indispensable, instrument of learning. When Ruthven talked a streak, volumes of ancient truth disclosed long-forgotten spells of power. It was hard not to be caught up in the force of his personality, to be transported on wings of rant.\n\nâI have here,â Ruthven continued, âa missive from a miserable society devoted to the thin memory of that constitutionalist bore Walter Bagehot. They tactfully complain that the Prince accepted the embrace of the Anglican Church an indecently short time before he accepted the embrace of the Queen. Our correspondent even goes so far as to suggest Vlad might conceivably not be sincere in his abjuration of the Pope of Rome, and that, with Cardinal Newman as his secret confessor, he has imported the perfidious taint of Leo the Thirteenth into the Royal Household. My curly-haired friend, some dunderheads find it easier to forgive a taste for virgin blood than the drinking of communion wine.â\n\nRuthven shredded the letter. Its confetti joined that of many other derided documents on the carpet. He grinned and breathed heavily, but there was no trace of his apparent excitement in his milk-white cheeks. It struck Godalming that the Prime Ministerâs rages were counterfeit, the impostures of a man more used to simulating than experiencing passion. He strode across the room, making and unmaking fists behind his back, grey eyes like fine-lashed marbles.\n\nâOur Prince changed his faith before, you know,â Ruthven observed, âand for the same reason. In 1473, he abandoned Orthodoxy and became Catholic so he could marry the sister of the King of Hungary. The manoeuvre won him freedom after twelve years as a hostage at Mathiasâs court, and a clear shot at regaining the Wallachian throne his bloody foolishness had lost him. That he stuck by Rome for four centuries afterwards tells you not a little about the manâs innate dullness. If you wish to examine the true soul of conservatism, you should look no further than Buckingham Palace.â\n\nBy now the Prime Minister was addressing himself not to Godalming but to a portrait. Its beak-nosed profile was turned towards a balancing picture of the Queen that ornamented the same wall. Godalming had only met Dracula once; the Prince Consort and Lord Protector, then a mere Count going by the name of de Ville, had not much resembled the proud creature captured in paint by Mr G.F. Watts.\n\nâImagine the brute, Godalming. Brooding for four hundred years in his stinking wreck of a castle. Plotting and scheming and swearing and gnashing his teeth. Festering in medieval superstition. Bleeding dry uncouth peasants. Running and rutting and raping and rending with the mountain beasts. Taking his coarse pleasure with those un-dead animals he calls wives. Shifting his shape like some were-wolf mountebank...â\n\nThough the Prince Consort had personally sponsored the Prime Ministerâs appointment, relations between the vampire elders, formed over the course of centuries, were hardly congenial. In public, Ruthven displayed the expected fealty to the elder who had been King of the Vampires long before he was ruler of Great Britain. The un-dead had been an invisible kingdom for thousands of years; the Prince Consort had, at a stroke, wiped clean that slate and started anew, lording over warm and vampire alike. Ruthven, who had passed his centuries in travel and dalliance, was dragged out of the shadows with the other elders. Some might say that a chronically impoverished nobleman â who once remarked that his title and barren acres in Scotland could buy him a halfpenny bun if he had the haâpence to go with them â had done well out of the changes. But His Lordship, a man whose title could hardly compare with Godalmingâs own, was a complainer.\n\nâNow this Dracula has his Bradshaw by heart and calls himself a âmodernâ. He can tell you all the times of trains from St Pancras to Norwich on bank holidays. But he canât believe the world has revolved since he got himself killed. Do you know how he died? He disguised himself as a Turk to spy on the enemy, then his own men broke his neck when he tried to come back to camp. The seed was already in him, put there by some fool of a nosferatu, and he crawled out of the earth. He is nobodyâs get. How he loves his native soil, to sleep in it at every opportunity. Thereâs grave-mould in his bloodline, Godalming. Thatâs the sickness he spreads. Think yourself lucky that you are of my bloodline. Itâs pure. We may not turn into bats and wolves, my son-in-darkness, but we donât rot on the bone either, or lose our minds in a homicidal frenzy.â\n\nGodalming believed Ruthven had sought him out and made a vampire of him solely because of his involvement in what was now regarded as an underhanded conspiracy against the Royal Person. When warm, Godalming had personally destroyed the first of Draculaâs British get. That made him a likely candidate for the pike between Van Helsing and that solicitor fellow Harker. He remembered with a shudder the Thor-like blows that drove the stake through his then-beloved Lucy, and felt a poisonous hate for the Dutchman who had persuaded him to such an extreme. He had been criminally foolish and was now eager to compensate. His turning, and Ruthvenâs adoption of him as protÃ©gÃ©, had saved his heart for the moment, but he was too well aware of the Prince Consortâs capriciousness and capacity for vengeance. And, of course, his father-in-darkness was hardly known for his own constancy or evenness of temperament. If he was to find a secure place in the changed world, he would have to be careful.\n\nâHis ideas were formed in his lifetime,â Ruthven continued, âwhen you could rule a country with the sword and stake. He missed the Renaissance, the Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, the French Revolution, the rise of the Americas, the fall of the Ottoman. He wishes to avenge the death of our gallant General Gordon by dispatching a force of ferocious vampire idiots to ravage the Sudan and impale all who owe allegiance to the Mahdi. I should let him do it. We could well live without his Carpathian cronies draining the public purse. Let a hundred or so of the clods get cut down by canny Mussulmen and left to rot in the sun and weâd have all the barmaids in Piccadilly and Soho flying the Crescent in gratitude.â\n\nRuthven swept his hand through another pile of letters, and sent up a flurry which descended around him. The Prime Minister seemed barely out of his teens, with cold grey eyes and a dead white face. He betrayed no ruddy flush even when he had just fed. A connoisseur of delicate young girls, he nevertheless chose for his get able young men of position. He distributed his new-born children-in-darkness to government offices, even encouraging competition between them. Godalming, unsuited by his title to menial duties and yet hardly qualified for a cabinet post, was currently the most favoured of Ruthvenâs get, serving unofficially as a private messenger and secretary. He had always had a practical streak, a flair for working out the details of complicated plans. Even Van Helsing had trusted him to handle much of the spade-work of his campaign.\n\nâAnd have you heard of his latest edict?â Ruthven held up a scroll of official parchment, bound in scarlet tape. It unravelled, and Godalming saw the copperplate of a palace secretary. âHe wants to crack the whip on what he refers to as âunnatural viceâ, and has decreed that the punishment for sodomy shall henceforth be by summary execution. The method will, of course, be his old reliable, the stake.â\n\nGodalming glanced over the paper. âSodomy? Why should that so offend the Prince Consort?â\n\nâYou forget, Godalming. Dracula has not the Englishmanâs tolerance. He spent some years of his youth as a hostage to the Turks, and we must assume his captors made use of him from time to time. Indeed, his brother Radu, significantly known as âthe Handsomeâ, developed a taste for masculine attentions. Since Radu betrayed him in one of his familyâs innumerable internal intrigues, the Prince Consort has chosen to take an extreme position in regard to matters homosexual.â\n\nâThis seems a very minor business.â\n\nRuthven flared his nostrils. âYour understanding is limited, Godalming. Just consider: there is hardly an upstanding member of either house who has not, at one time or another, buggered a telegraph boy. Come December, Dracula will have some very prominent fairies slowly sinking on to the Christmas trees they are surmounting.â\n\nâA curious image, my Lord.â\n\nThe Prime Minister waved away the remark, diamond-shaped nails catching the light.\n\nâTchah, Godalming, tchah! Of course, in that canny brain, our Wallachian Prince may have many purposes to one action.â\n\nâMeaning?â\n\nâMeaning that there is in this city a certain new-born poet, an Irishman, as known for his amatory preferences as for his unwise association with a countryman whose memory is much out of favour. And, dare I say it, better known for either attribute than for his verse.â\n\nâYou mean Oscar Wilde?â\n\nâOf course I mean Wilde.â\n\nâHe is not much at Mrs Stokerâs lately.â\n\nâNeither should you be, if you value your heart. My protection can only cloak so much.â\n\nGodalming nodded, gravely. He had his reasons for continuing to attend Florence Stokerâs after-darks.\n\nâI have a report on the doings of Mr Oscar Wilde somewhere,â Ruthven said, indicating another pyramid of papers. âCommissioned in my private capacity as a gentleman of letters, with an interest in the continuing health of our finest creative minds. Wilde has embraced the vampire state with enthusiasm, youâll be pleased to know. Currently, sampling the blood of young men is his favoured pursuit, somewhat eclipsing his aesthetic fervour, and completely obliterating the flirtation with Fabian socialism that regrettably preoccupied him at the beginning of the year.â\n\nâYouâve obviously taken an interest in the fellow. For myself, I always find him tiresome, tittering behind his hand to hide his bad teeth.â\n\nRuthven threw himself into a chair and ran a hand through his longish hair. The Prime Minister was something of a dandy, given to an extravagance of cuffs and cravats. Punch called him âthe compleat murgatroydâ.\n\nâWe contemplate the dread possibility that Alfred, Lord Tennyson, will hold the post of poet laureate for dreary centuries. Egads, imagine Locksley Hall Six Hundred Years After? I would rather drink vinegar than live in an England that would allow such a horror, and so I have been casting around for a merciful alternative. If things had been otherwise, Godalming, I should have chosen to be a poet, and yet tyrannous fate, with the invaluable assistance of the Prince Consort, has bound me to the rock of bureaucracy, the eagle of politics pecking at my liver.â\n\nNow Ruthven stood up and wandered to his book-cases, where he remained, contemplating his beloved volumes. The Prime Minister had lengthy passages of Shelley, Byron, Keats and Coleridge by heart, and could disgorge chunks from Goethe and Schiller in the original. His current enthusiasms were French, and decadent. Beaudelaire, de Nerval, Rimbaud, Rachilde, Verlaine, MallarmÃ©; most, if not all, of whom the Prince Consort would have gleefully impaled. Godalming had heard Ruthven declare that a purportedly scandalous novel, A Rebours by J.K. Huysmans, should be placed before every schoolboy, and that he would, in a utopia, make vampires only of poets and painters. It was said, however, that one symptom "
