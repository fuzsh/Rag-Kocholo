        "text": "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of good fortune must be in want of sex with a man who doesn’t use the smiling turd emoji.\n\nThis week, the historian Lucy Worsley set petticoats aflutter when she tried to argue that dating in the modern world simply doesn’t have enough obstacles to achieve the “slow exquisite torture of love” found in great fiction. That Jane Austen could not write her novels now, in this age of Grindr and Tinder, “when bored singletons search for one-night stands with a few clicks of their mobiles”. Which is, of course, as ironic as any passage from the creamy pages of Pride and Prejudice because the frontline of modern dating is nothing if not a churning, pitted wasteland of judgment, etiquette, deceit, dismissal, disappointment and, worst of all, choice.\n\nI have just returned from a wedding in France where I careered around the married guests like a beardless ancient mariner in a pale blue jumpsuit, whispering, desperately, “But how did you know? How did you know?” into people’s blanched and weary faces. With apps such as The Grade assessing people’s grammar in their messages, or Tinder making the act of rejection easier than a sneeze, how can anybody be sure that this clever, well-informed person with a great deal of conversation is the one they want to marry?\n\nSome of us may no longer have the great obstacles of overbearing fathers, dowries, social hierarchy and family disapproval (although, God knows, many still do) but we have instead prioritised the enormous obstacle that is ourselves and our own opinions. Without a codified checklist of suitable marital attributes we’re left to try to work it out for ourselves. We’re supposed to dredge up from our gut or loins or heart the certainty that this person is The Person. Which is far from easy when you’re scrolling through a potential dance card of 50 million people, your fingers slippery with anxiety over your own grammar, desperately looking for a flattering profile photo, lying about your income, swerving around your ex and trying to remember the suitable response to a dickpic.\n\nAlso, let’s not pretend that the obstacles to love have really changed so much. When Austen wrote in Mansfield Park that “life seems but a quick succession of busy nothings”, she was essentially describing Tinder. When Austen wrote in Persuasion that, “to flatter and follow others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of half enjoyment”, she could well have been refreshing her empty OKCupid inbox. When she wrote that, “a large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of”, she was basically laying out the mantra for The Inner Circle – a dating site that describes itself as “an exclusive network reserved for only the most successful and attractive singletons around the world”. When Mrs Bennet asks in Pride and Prejudice, “Is not general incivility the very essence of love?” she could be well be howling over her phone in a pub toilet at an unanswered message on Guardian Soulmates.\n\nWithout the well-worn courting rituals of the landed gentry on our side, we’re still facing the essential problem laid out in Emma: that one half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other. We don’t know how happy our partner is supposed to make us. We aren’t taught how much joy they are supposed to pour into our lives. In short, we don’t know how good is good enough. So we instead pick people apart on the basis of tiny inconsequentialities such as their spelling, use of emojis and unflattering selfies. We are cruel, judgmental, dismissive and quick to criticise. We upload screengrabs of poorly worded Tinder profiles to Twitter so we can all laugh at someone’s innocent mistake. We put into action Operation Fake Emergency Text when a first date reveals that they’ve had to move back in with their parents. We swipe left simply because we don’t like the wallpaper someone’s standing in front of in their profile photo. Not to mention the bigger problems facing the modern singleton hoping to settle down: unemployment, lack of housing, debt, soaring rates of chlamydia.\n\nSo let’s not go pretending that ours is an era free of slow, exquisite torture. That we don’t still look to our friends as a balm for the pangs of disappointed love. That happiness in marriage isn’t, in many cases, entirely a matter of chance. That single people no longer worry about income, grammar, social status, parental approval, beauty, truth, dancing or how to cope with the heart-draining reality of unrequited love. The search for romance is the same as it ever was – we just don’t do it in corsets any more."
