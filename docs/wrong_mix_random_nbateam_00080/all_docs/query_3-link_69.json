        "text": "Following a sell-out run at the Menier Chocolate Factory, Lindsay Posner’s hit production of Mike Leigh’s seminal 70s comedy Abigail’s Party transfers to the West End.\n\nStarring original cast members Jill Halfpenny, Joe Absolom, Natalie Casey, Susannah Harker and Andy Nyman, Abigail’s Party is a comedy of manners with plenty of black humour.\n\nSet in 1970’s suburbia, Abigail’s Party sees a party hosted by Beverly and her husband Laurence turn from an evening of drinks and cheesy pineapple nibbles into a night of unmasked prejudices and flared tempers.\n\nBest known for her long-running role in EastEnders, Jill Halfpenny starred as Paulette in Legally Blonde for which she won an Olivier Award. She is joined in Abigail’s Party by fellow former soap stars Absolom and Casey, who play Tony and Angela, along with Pride And Prejudice’s Susannah Harker and Andy Nyman (Ghost Stories) playing Sue and Laurence."
