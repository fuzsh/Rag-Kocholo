        "text": "Susannah Sneath, Joseph Harker; 2017.\n\nJoseph Harker was a colonizer, bishop, missionary, patriarch and visionary. His first wife, Susannah Sneath was his indomitable help meet, without whom it is certain he could not have achieved what he did. When at seventy-eight years of age and his life was drawing to its close (1896), he added one final journal entry for the benefit of his posterity: âI now bear testimony that the Lord Almighty has never left me nor forsaken me, from my childhood until the present time.â ___ Joseph Harker (b. 28 Feb 1818), brought his young family to America from Lincolnshire, England, departing Liverpool on February 17, 1846. He and his wife, Susannah Sneath, had joined the Mormon Church the previous year (25 May 1845), baptized by Josephâs older brother Amos. After nine weeks at sea the Harkerâs arrived at New Orleans. Shortly thereafter, they and their three young sons (John, Job, and Joseph) took a riverboat up the Mississippi to the headquarters of the Mormon church at Nauvoo, Illinois. En route, tragedy struck when three-and-a-half-year-old John fell overboard and was drowned. The heart-sick Harkerâs had already received disquieting news from Nauvoo. It was two years since the martyrdom of the prophet, Joseph Smith, and the Saints were being driven from their homes. The family arrived in Montrose, Iowa, across the river from Nauvoo, on April 26, 1846. They stayed about two weeks, visiting the Nauvoo Temple while preparing to follow the Saints west (Joseph Harker Family History, p. 11, 15-16). The Trip West In early May, the Harkerâs travelled west along mud clogged trails in a wagon train. Come July they arrived at Council Bluffs, Iowa. Brigham Young rode into camp and gave Joseph a blessing. Thereafter, âJoseph and Susannah knew that regardless of what lay [ahead], their strength would be equal to itâ¦.â Late that September, one-year-old Joseph, steadily weakening, passed away. The Harker family was fortunate to survive the winter that took over 300 lives on both sides of the river. Early-on, Joseph secured work with a half-breed Indian, Bill Bond. The family lived in Bondâs house until Joseph could move them into a home of their own. They ate better than many, but the winter of 1846/47 was a season of intense âsuffering and exposure to cold and disease...â (JHFH p. 16-18). After a flurry of preparations in the spring, the family left for the Salt Lake Valley as part of a massive group of some 600 wagons, divided into nine separate companies (Pioneer Overland Travels, John Taylor, 1848). They followed the route of the pioneering company led earlier that season by Brigham Young, departing on 17 June 1847 (POT, Horne/Hunter Company, 1847). Josephâs family, having a good wagon and a fine pair of oxen, traveled well. He testified of his happiness and light heart during the journey west saying, âWe had many trials on the way but I never had a happier summer in my life.â Joseph reported, âMy wife would drive the team and I would go and hunt game until I was tired.â Known as a good shot, he was valued for his ability to supply meat to those he accompanied. Their wagon train averaged about 100 miles a week. On September 26, nearing their goal, the Harkerâs paused at the top of Echo Canyon long enough for a fourth son, William, to be born. The following morning, âthe wagonâ¦ with locked wheelsâ¦ skidded, bumped and crashed its way down the precipitous descent....â Almost three and a half months after departing Winter Quarters, on October 1, 1847, Joseph Harker and his family arrived in the Salt Lake Valley of the Saints (JHFH, p. 19). Early Years in Utah During the fall of 1848, thirty-year-old Joseph Harker was the first pioneer to settle west of the Jordan River, probably near present-day 600 West and 3300 South in greater Salt Lake City. The area became known as Harkerâs Settlement (Taylorsville Utah History, p. 21; JHFH, p. 20-21). During those early days of intense privation..."
