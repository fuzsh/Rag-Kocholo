A FULL ACCOUNT OF THE History, Antiquities, Natural Productions, Scenery, Customs and Folk-lore OF THE ANCIENT TOWN AND PARISH OF BINGLEY, IN THE WEST RIDING OF YORKSHIRE.\n\nBY\n\nHARRY SPEIGHT,\n\nAUTHOR OF \"THE CRAVEN HIGHLANDS;\" \"THROUGH AIREDALE;\" \" NIDDERDALE ; \" \" ROMANTIC RICHMONDSHIRE ; \" ETC.\n\nNUMEROUS ILLUSTRATIONS.\n\nLONDON :\n\nELLIOT STOCK, 62, PATERNOSTER ROW, E.C.\n\n1898.\n\nEntered at Stationers' Hall.\n\nPrinted by Edwabd Foijlds, Main Street, Bingley, Yobks.\n\nPreface\n\nOLD Saxon town of Bingley, is very pleasantly situated in the valley of the Aire, about twelve miles from Leeds, and six miles from Bradford. At one time consisting of but few hoiises, clustered round its venerable Parish Church, the little place lay deeply embosomed amidst high craggy hills and embowering woodlands, and well did it deserve its title of \"The Throstle Nest of Old England,\" which it still fondly bears. In the following pages I have endeavoured to trace the history of the town arid parish fi'om the remotest times. The work is divided into four parts ; the first embracing the period from the foundation of the rocks to the Ice Age and the advent of man ; the second from thence to the Norman invasion ; the third conducting to the present time ; while the fourth deals with outlying places in the parish. The design and general scope of the work will at once be apparent on turning to the index of Contents on page 5.\n\nSince the prospectus of the work was issued in 1896 a very large amount of additional matter has been received, which accounts not only for the delay in the publication of the volume, but also for its greatly increased size. My thanks are especially due to Mr. Ferrand, of St. Ives, Bingley, the principal landowner in the parish, whose estates and valuable manuscript collections have been open to me in the most generous manner. Mr. Ferrand has also been good enough to revise the proof-sheets relating to his family's possessions, without which help the book could not have been so accurate and complete. To Mr. Arthur C. Benson, son of the late Archbishop of Canterbury, I am indebted for many interesting particulars respecting his family's connections with the parish. The Right Hon. the Earl of Cranbrook has also senfr me many\n\n629693\n\ninteresting notes. To the clergy, ministers, and a large number of others, in the parish and elsewhere, I am likewise indebted for various useful help, and especially to the following :— Mr. W. A. Brigg, Kildwick Hall Mr. Francis R. Shackleton, Torquay ; Messrs. Farrer & Co (solicitors to Mr. Lane Fox), London ; Miss Maud, Seattle U.S.A. ; Mrs. Staffurth, Bognor ; Mrs. Le Page, Cheadle Mr. J. Stephenson, Bath; Mr. Algernon G. Hartley, London the late Mr. J. Aldam Heaton, London ; the Rev. R. V Taylor, Melbecks ; Mr. J. Norton Dickons, Bradford Mr. J. J. Stead, Heckmondwike ; and the following local residents, namely : Messrs. J. E. Preston, John Walker, J. A. Clapham, T. Wilkinson Green, Alfred Platts, N. H. Walbank, Thomas Longbottom, William Green (librarian), Stephen Darlow, and Sydney Waddington.\n\nThe numerous illustrations, and the names of those who have supplied the originals, are given on pages 6 and 7. For a large proportion of the photographs engraved I am indebted to the industry and skill of Mr. George Whitaker, of Bingley, who has taken them specially for this work, and has been unremitting in his pains to supply excellent and suitable originals. Mr. T. W. Goodall, of Bingley, has kindly supplied some beautiful pictures, including various views in the Main Street before the alterations. Miss Nannie Preston, of Gilstead, has furnished some original drawings, and her work — too well known to need any comment of mine — will speak for itself. All the blocks have been engraved by Messrs. Armitage and Ibbetson, of Bradford, and printed with the book by Mr. Edward Foulds, of Bingley.\n\nThe valuable plate of \" Bingley Eighty Years Ago,\" in the best edition only, depicts the old church, grammar school, canal, and Belbank woods before the railway was made, and the picture was dedicated to the Rev. Richard Hartley, D.D., vicar of Bingley, and published by N. Whitley, of Hahfax, in 1822.\n\nTo the subscribers and the many friends who have helped to obtain them my thanks are also due.

When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the Lord thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.\" — Deut. viii, 9, 10,\n\nN order to determine the causes which led to the site of Bingley being first chosen as a place of dwelling, it will be necessary to go far back to primeval ages, long before the human epoch. It was then through the wisdom of their infinite Author that the rocks with their mineral treasures were deposited, followed by a wondrous vegetable growth and a beauty of form and mould adapted to man's services and advancement, as implied by the words of the above scriptural text.\n\nAs was the case with most ancient centres of population, the spot was unquestionably selected by reason of the physical advantages of rock-structure and surroundings. Moreover, the situation of Bingley at the confluence of two secluded and well-wooded valleys, was one calculated •to inspire the early love of meditation and retirement, and even long antecedent to the time when the first fragment of local history was carved in stone, now more than 1100 years ago, the place doubtless was the scene of a happy religious devotion. Ages before then , however, the aboriginal\n\n10\n\nskin -clad native rowed his coracle on the bright waters of the Aire, albeit the full manner and fruition of his life in the district are obscured in the darkness of antiquity.\n\nYet, again, this man's presence at Bingley is but as of yesterday compared with the time that has elapsed since the rocks on which he first stood and the valley in which he first lived were formed. How came these rocks and this valley, are questions I must now engage to answer. The divers grit rocks and sandstones which constitute the floor and sides of the valley are said to be the result of the decomposition and dispersion of the constituents of granite. Granite consists of an aggregation of -felspar, silica or quartz and mica, such materials in fact of which the first solid crust of the earth was made. But how this grit came to be deposited here is a problem that may well arouse enquiry. There appears, however, to be a consensus of opinion that it was derived from the granites of Norway and Sweden, as no other granite resembles so exactly the fluids, gases, and crystals of the grit rocks of this country. As' granite decomposes most readily under alternations of great heat and cold, it is conjectured that this took place when the earth was sufficiently cooled to admit of this possibility, and that the particles were borne from the east by hurricanes of wind to find a barrier and stay upon the range of Carboniferous Limestone, at a time when no land existed eastward of the limestone, — all the present land surface in this direction being of more recent formation. The phenomena of wind-borne particles over long distances is not unreasonable when we consider the travelling power and desolating effects, even at this day, of great masses of sand in the desert region of Sahara in Africa and in Central Asia ; the sea bottom in many places is covered with a great thickness of sand blown from the desert of Sahara, as was proved by the dredgings brought up by the Challenger, often at very considerable* distances from the African coast. Yet the wind-bearing theory while it explains many circumstances attending the deposition of the gritstone in England does not explain all. The angularity of the enclosed quartz particles may be accounted for in this way, whilst on the other hand the\n\n11\n\nrock at Bingley is often found to have these pebbles in varying size rounded and smoothed as if by the action of water. The precise determining causes of these variations have never been satisfactorily explained.\n\nOverlying the Rough Eock, which forms the topmost bed of the Millstone Grit series we have the Coal Measures, consisting of alternating beds of sandstone, shale, and thin seams of coal. Bands of ironstone and a stratum of fire-clay are also associated with these measures at Bingley. A valuable sandstone, close-grained and highly silicious, termed galliard, is likewise found in small quantities usually directly beneath the lowest coal seams.\n\nIn these upper beds appeared the first vegetable life at Bingley. Also the vegetable origin of coal has long been established. With the gradual cooling and thickening of the earth's crust fresh deposits of mud and sand were formed, and as each successive surface rose above the water it was soon covered with a luxuriant and dense vegetation. The jungles of tropical forests at the present day are mere barrenness in comparison with the extraordinary growth of terrestrial vegetation during this warm period of local history. The giant lepidodendron, or fossil tree of our quarries, waved its palm-like branches over a rank and profuse undergrowth of large and magnificent ferns, of which half-a-hundred kinds grew within a few miles' radius of where Bingley now stands. Enormous calamites, so called from the reed-like jointings of the stalk, flourished on the muddy banks of these primeval streams; their representatives being the dwindled \" horsetails \" of our hedge banks and beck sides. Occasionally, as at Gilstead, we find these fossil trees encased in a thin cylinder of coal, formed by the preservation of the bark, the tree having- become hollow got filled up with mud or sand, and so took the shape of the trunk. Sometimes, too, we find the sandstone ripple-marked, produced by a gentle flow of water over the surface, which had hardened on the retreat of the wave ; hkewise the sandstone pitted with small holes caused by rain drops, and we may sometimes tell by the position and form of the holes which way the wind blew when it rained in those far-off days.\n\n12\n\nUndoubtedly at one time the land within and adjoining the parish was almost one unbroken level surface, but the eye of God alone beheld this. The places which we now know as Greenhill, Druids' Altar, Cottingley Moor, Wrose Hill, Baildon Hill and Gilstead Moor were once joined together by an almost continuous table-land. There happened at this time and also at intervals before, great subsidences in the strata, some taking place suddenly, while others were gentle and protracted. The effects of these subsidences, throws, or \" faults,\" as they are technically termed, we are witnesses of at the present day. An important one extends from near Greenhill, by Gawthorpe Hall, and crossing the town extends the whole length of the Harden valley, throwing out some fine springs in Bell Bank Field and at the back of St. Ives, until its course is stopped by a cross fault through Harden Moor, forming the romantic ravine of Deep Cliff, and passing southwards by Harden Hall towards Wilsden. There is little doubt that the beautiful Harden valley owes its inception to this fault, although so much removed above the present valley bottom.\n\nThe Aire valley, where Bingley is situated, is however not directly due to any such faulting as I have described. This dale, like the other great valleys of Yorkshire, owes its origin to the great and much older Penine ridge, which runs in a north and south direction from Derbyshire to the Cheviots. It is noteworthy that most of the great rivers of the world run east or west for similar reasons. The Danube, the Po, and the Tagus in Europe ; the Amazon, the Orinoco, and the La Plata in South America ; the St. Lawrence, the Ohio, and the Missouri in North America, flow towards the east or west ; though the Apennines in Europe, the Andes in South America, and the AUeghany and Rocky Mountains in North ' America, extend northwards and southwards.\n\nThat the Bingley valley is a valley of denudation only is obvious from the corresponding position of the strata on opposite sides of the valley. These strata when not interrupted by faults are perfectly conformable and rise in regular sequence. It is impossible to estimate correctly in point of years how long it has taken to form the valley.\n\n18\n\nIn remote times no doubt the denuding power of water and the actions of heat and frost, have been much more rapid than they are at present, but if we are to accept Dr. Geike's hypothesis that upon an average one-tweKth of an inch is worn out of the valleys in 8J years, or say one foot in a century, we arrive at the conclusion that it must have taken fully 450,000 years to excavate the Bingley valley, say from the level of the Druids' Altar and Greenhill (650 feet) to the river level at Castlefields (270 feet). This may be an over-estimate, inasmuch as the thickness or depth of the valley is not wholly solid rock, but contains a good proportion of shale, which would wear away much quicker than the sandstone and grit. The trough of Priesthorpe, for example, was excavated out of this softer material, and forms a plateau resting on rock sloping westwards to the valley.\n\nI have spoken of the vegetable life of the local rocks and the earliest evidence of animal life I have met with in the parish is an annalide or form of water-worm ; petrified castings of which are found in the sandstones of the millstone grits and coal measures. An admirably -preserved specimen is to be seen on a sandstone gate-post at Ravenroyd, and this may be regarded as the oldest representative of animal life extant in the parish. Little or nothing is known of the life-history of these interesting creatures, which occur in varying forms in the rocks long antecedent to the sandstone era, even far down to Cambrian age. Doubtless all our freshwater and terrestrial worms are modern developments of these primitive estuarine and marine forms. Higher up in the series of local rocks we find a more advanced type of animal life in the shape of fossil shells and fish remains. No insects, however, or reptiles are seen, which belong to a later period than is yielded by the local strata. And these facts, by the way, are quite in accord with science and the Bible ; the humble forms of life are the oldest, and the most wonderful and complex, viz., man, appears as the consummation or climacteric of life on the earth.\n\nIn the coal measures is found a well-preserved mollusc, Aviculopecten, accompanied with a goniatite, a univalve\n\n14\n\nshell coiled up like a snail, a form of which occurs in the Carboniferous Limestone of Bolland, Derbyshire, and the Isle of Man, as well as in the limestone and coal measures of Ireland. A higher type still, ranking between the fishes and reptiles, is found in the roof of the Hard Bed coal, including the colossal Megalidhys Hibberti, a fine specimen of which is in the Leeds Museum.\n\nThe \"fossil mussel,\" hardly distinguishable at sight from the common sea-mussel of the present age, which is found in quantities close above the coal seams on Baildon Moor, is doubtless a descendant of the primeval form occurring in the Carboniferous Limestone, and allied to the freshwater types found in the neighbourhood of Bingley at the present day. I am told on the authority of several old men, still living, that when the railway was made at Bingley in 1846, the stone tippings in the bog caused numerous specimens of black mussel and sea-cockle to ooze to the surface, and in places where they could not possibly have been thrown. That these should appear at Bingley dark coloured, or even black, is easily accounted for by long continuance in stagnant water and subject to the pressure of decayed vegetable matter excluded from the air, precisely in the same way as the vegetable accumulations of coal become black. But the occurrence of the sea-cockle at Bingley, if it be ever proved to be such, is of more than ordinary importance. Until, however, actual specimens are produced from the spot the subject is purely speculative. Possibly the shells were the freshwater helices (Tellina cornea) which have been found in peat-moss, but in these forms the stripes are across the shell, from side to side, not in the same directions as the sea-cockle. I have met with but a single mention of the occurrence of sea-cockle in peat-moss in Yorkshire, and this about forty miles from the sea, at a point about two miles from Greta Bridge and about two miles from the river Tees. The cockles were, it is said, found in considerable quantity, and an old farm- house near, called Cocklesbury, is said to have taken its name from the circumstance. But in the Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal, vol. II (1827), Sir W. C. Trevelyan doubts that they are native to the place, and asserts that\n\n15\n\nafter an actual visit he found some freshwater specimens, the common whelk ; and if the sea-cockle [carduum edule) has been found there, they have been put there for the purpose of hoaxing the individuals who collected them afterwards. The only shell which I have myself found in the peat at Bingley was obtained during the recent draining in the highroad on the edge of the bog going to Crossflatts. Here at a depth of 16 feet from the present surface I obtained from the peat dead specimens of Helix rufescens, a common and still-existing land shell. A marine shell (Cyprina Islandica), I may add, has been found in this valley at Greengates, but embedded in glacial drift. In the same material at Bingley, about 8 feet from the surface, there was found, while digging a grave on the east side of the cemetery, in January, 1898, about sixty well-grown specimens of the peculiarly limestone mollusc, Helix nemoralis. It is not unusual for this creature to burrow 3 to 4 feet down, but to find it at a depth of 8 feet is very remarkable. Probably they had slipped through an aperture in the gravel. All were dead.\n\nWhen the conditions which had produced the rocks and strange life above described had ceased, and the hills and valleys were clothed with a tropical growth, there was another and more complex kind of life existing here, of which, however, we know little. Still we are sure there were some strange quadrupeds at Bingley, for the bones of the hippopotamus, the teeth and bones of the mammoth, bear, bison (a tooth was found in forming the fish-pond at Milner Field), and the molars of a single lion, all found in Airedale, constitute undoubted evidence as to the kinds of creatures that infested the local woods and glades in those primeval times. But we have no evidence of the presence of man and his handiwork until after the close of the Ice Age, a comparatively recent event when considering the antiquity of the valley he inhabits, an antiquity that recalls the words of the divine Interrogator to His servant Job : \" Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth ? Declare if thou hast understanding ! \" And the man answered : \" Behold I am vile ; what shall I answer Thee ? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.\"\n\n17\n\nBINGLEY DURING THE ICE AGE.\n\nHE stupendous walls of blue ice that completely filled the gorge at Bingley and had been encroaching upon this district during many centuries, drove away every form of life save that which is peculiar to the frozen regions of the north at the present day, as for example, the bear, Arctic fox and certain species of birds. The huge mammoth (now extinct) seems also to have survived the rigours of this Polar cold in Yorkshire, and doubtless, the hippopotamus too, a denizen of the Bingley swamps, as bones of this thick- skinned sluggish creature, identical Avith the species now inhabiting African rivers, have been found in glacial clay lower down the Aire valley. About sixty years since while a small tunnel was being made from the river to a well in Mr. Wm. Maud's property on Elm Tree Hill there was found in the glacial drift some fifty or sixty feet from the surface a leg bone of a fowl, but singularly not far from it was a brass pin. But it is very questionable, considering the proximity of the latter, if the bone was of glacial age. Man, however, as I have just said, does not appear to have been present in Yorkshire antecedent to or during this great northern cataclysm. In North Britain, Scandinavia, and indeed throughout Northern Europe paleolithic implements have never been found nor any evidence of pre-glacial man, whilst in the south of England and in France they are abundant. It is moreover now agreed that the supposed human fibula found in glacial debris along with bones of the mammoth and spotted-hyaena in the Victoria Cave, near Settle, is not a human remain, but may be the bone of some inferior order of animal which cannot be determined with certainty. That man may have come northwards and witnessed the retreat of the glaciers in the Yorkshire dales is not at all improbable, as I have shewn in my work on Eichmondshire. The discovery\n\n18\n\nof a bone brace of very primitive make, along with the remains of reindeer and other evidences of the occupation of Wensleydale during a period of intense cold, seems to point to the belief that man and the reindeer were coeval in Yorkshire when it had an Arctic climate. The reindeer is an aniraal that subsists on lichens and has a preference for a certain degree of cold ; it is a migratory animal upon which one class of mankind — the Laplanders — are mainly dependent for their existence. Is it not likely then that the reindeer followed the retreat of the ice northwards, and that man accompanied it ; the present inhabitants of the Arctic regions being the descendants partly of the primeval tenants of the Yorkshire dales ? As will be explained in the next chapter, many Arctic plants have survived at Bingley unto this day ; among others the old Eeindeer Lichen (C. sylvatica) still maintains its ground.\n\nIn my work on Nidderdale I have expounded the astronomical discovery of General Drayson shewing that \" about 23,000 years B.C., the Arctic circles extended about 30 degrees from the Poles, at about 13,500 B.C., they extended nearly 35^ degrees from the Poles, or to be exact to the latitude of 54 degrees, 34 minutes, 13 seconds in both hemispheres. Consequently North Yorkshire was within the Arctic Circle, the dales were filled with glaciers, the land to an altitude in some places of nearly 2000 feet above present sea-level, was submerged in ice and snow and all the appearances of an Arctic climate prevailed.\" Long after the ice-mantle disappeared from the higher ground, tongues of ice in the shape of local glaciers continued to fill the Yorkshire dales, and in Airedale we have evidence that the glacier extended below Shipley, thinning away in the neighbourhood of Leeds. Ice- groovings have been noted on rock near Apperley Bridge, &c., and at Bingley magnificent evidence is to be seen of the contest which the ice had with the winding sandstone gorge, in forcing through which enormous mounds of moraine matter were deposited. Nowhere in Yorkshire can the strange effects of these ancient glaciers be better studied than in the neighbourhood of Bingley, where the confined valley must have been choked with ice for many\n\n19\n\nhundreds of years. And these singular mounds with their loads of transported limestones, &c., were to prove in after days, as I shall shew by-and-bye, a source of great and exceptional profit to the inhabitants of Bingley.\n\nIt was not until 5,600 B.C., that the Arctic Circles had contracted to 30 degrees from the Poles or to the latitude of about south Shetland, and it would not be until about 3000 years B.C., that Yorkshire would possess a climate suitable for habitation by man. The fabulous antiquity so frequently ascribed to certain finds of human remains, and their associated relics in the north, must therefore be received with caution. There is probably not a human bone ever found in Yorkshire that has an age of 5000 years upon it, whilst the first steps in the human history of this parish begin long after this date. Northern Europe, as 1 have pointed out, was not inhabited until the Neolithic or second Stone Age.\n\nIn the long and severe winters of that frozen era, ice and snow covered the hills and valleys in winter, whilst the almost tropical heat of short summers produced enormous floods, accompanied by dense fogs, just as they arise now on the banks of Newfoundland from the same cause. In Airedale these successive annual floods filled the valley' in many places to a great depth with water ; lakes were formed, traces of which remain to this day. A considerable amount of denudation also took place ; many of the stones composing the glacial hummocks were rolled in water and the striations caused by the scratching of one stone against another during the ice pressure were largely removed, whilst upon the hill slopes almost every trace of glacial deposit was obliterated. Ice-scratched limestone pebbles may however still be picked out of the clay on the hill sides surrounding Bingley, as well as from the till and esker-ridges on the moor tops. Perched blocks, galliard resting on millstone grit, were also at one time very numerous on Harden and the surrounding moors. On Gilstead Moor and on Rumbalds Moor these white, flinty rocks have been very numerous in places where no galliard is in situ. Most of them have been used for walUng purposes as the moors became enclosed.\n\n20\n\nThe town of Bingley stands on one of these old glacial moraines, the Main Street following its longitudinal apex, whilst the \" Old Hills \" and Myrtle Pasture (formerly worked for limestone), completes the drift on the south side of the town. At the north end a long mound commences on the north-west side of the church and rises towards the cemetery. This single deposit occupies all the ground between the river on the west and the railway on the east running north-west and south-east for 46 chains (about half-a-mile), and is 20 chains at its broadest part. The maximum depth above normal river level is about 70 feet. Its northern boundary is limited by the river-bend at Ravenroyd to Castlefields Mill, and the reason why the river has not followed a straight and natural course along the valley on the east side of the hill where the railway runs, is owing to the thick spreads of gravel, which rising towards Crossfiatts, have baulked the river and compelled it to cut a fresh channel by the lower level on the west side of the town. This extensive mound, called Bailey Hills, was at one time undoubtedly an island and a secure refuge of the early inhabitants {see chapter on The Advent OF Man). It was bounded on the west by the river and on the east by an extensive lake which continued impassably wet until the making of the railway in 1846. The highroad from the vicarage to Crossfiatts rises over the eastern slope of this mound, and the railway cuts through the northern extremity of the gravel at the bridge. Crossfiatts is built partly on gravel containing drifted sandstone and limestone pebbles, and it is gravel all along the canal-bank as far as the Five-Rise Locks, where the drift is abruptly terminated. The whole of the expanse below towards the vicarage (which is erected on elm piles) formed a large lake, whilst another wide-spreading lake filled the valley beyond Crossfiatts towards Marley. Peat has accumulated to a great thickness in the valley below the vicarage, and during the recent excavations for the main drain I had opportunities of noting that the peat at a depth of 18 feet from the road surface rested on a stratum of tough boulder clay. The valley has moreover nurtured a forest of indigenous growth, and much decayed as well as\n\n21\n\nsound wood has been found here. One trunk of black oak, fully 20 feet long and 2 feet in diameter was dug out, and others of varying dimensions have been also unearthed from time to time whilst digging for foundations in different parts of the valley. Pieces of black oak which an axe could not cut were lately met with while excavating for the foundations of the centre buttresses of the new aqueduct across the Aire near Cottingley Bridge.\n\nOne noteworthy feature in connection with these mounds is the very stony character of the deposits at Bingley, where boulders up to half-a-ton in weight are not uncommon. The included boulders consist principally of local grits and sandstones of various kinds, also limestones, white, blue, and encrinital, and now and then I have met with boulders and pebbles of a hard detrital bluish-grey rock — though sometimes found of a greenish tint — which appears identical with the Silurian grits of upper Ribblesdale, of which the magnificent group of erratics at Norber, near Austwick, constitute the most notable existing example of ice-transportation of this rock {see my \" Craven Highlands,\" pages 168-170).*\n\nNorthwards, nearer Marley and at Sandbeds, the deposits are almost wholly pure sand, forming smooth, rounded lesser hills and beds of fine sand of great thickness. This circumstance may be explained by the fact that at the south end of the town, where the valley makes a sharp curve with the principal declination of the ground towards the west, the glacier has accumulated to an enormous thickness, filling the whole of the gorge, and depositing its burthen of debris, which here attains its greatest thickness. These accumulations have completely stopped the outlet of the water, and the dam so formed has caused the waters to gather into a large lake, the current, or rather conjunction of currents, with the main valley from Morton Glen have tended to form banks of sand by continued attrition. Higher up the dale, opposite Carlton, similar whirlpools have caused deposits of sand, and on the\n\nA well-rounded boulder of this rock, weighing probably 2 cwt.,\n\nhas lately been dug out of the drift in Priesthorpe Road, at an elevation of about 150 feet above the river. Sandstones have also been found containing fossils, evidently of a Silurian facies.\n\n22\n\nsite of Skipton Cemetery graves are dug through fifteen feet of sand without finding a stone bigger than a pigeon's\n\nAn inspection of the ground at Bingley shews that the declension of lateral currents and the increased power of the main current have in course of time forced an outlet near Castlefields Mill, cutting along the west side of the Bailey Hills, thus lowering the level of the old lake, and leaving a sandy shore. The principal mounds of the valley, too, appear to be formed on a neucleus of solid rock. The rock is in evidence near Castlefields ; in Myrtle Place and Main Street, and a good section is exposed in the mound at Hirst Wood, close to the Seven Arches, where it has been quarried for sandstone (see page 16/ The glacier grinding over these strata would smooth and polish them, or it may also have been partially cleft, and crevasses would be formed, causing a more rapid break-up of the ice-mass and consequent deposit of debris.\n\nAs I have stated, the tough blue clay forms the floor of the superficial deposits of the valley, and this boulder clay, consisting of clay and stones intermingled, ascends nearly, if not quite, to the summit level of the watersheds of Aire and Wharfe. During the construction of the Shipley reservoir on the moor above Eldwick (750ft.) a good example of this till was come upon in the course of excavating. A similar mass of till extends from Calverley Moor to Eccleshill and Idle, about 600 feet above the sea level. A peculiarity of these beds, observes Mr. Davis in West Yorkshire, is that whilst they contain numerous sub-angular boulders of grit and sandstone derived from the Millstone Grits and Lower Coal Measures south of Skipton, no Carboniferous Limestone has been found. But this supposition may be controverted. I have myself obtained well-rounded and beautifully-striated limestones from the blue clay on Greenhill, overlooking the Bingley valley, at a similar elevation (600ft.). The deposit at this spot is of unique interest. In the quarries of the Bingley Sanitary Tube Co. at Greenhill, a section has been bared of an extraordinary character. It consists in descending order as follows :— (1) Top soil 8 to 4 feet; (2) about 20 feet of\n\nshale and sandstone of no commercial value ; (3) black shale, about 3 feet, from base of which springs of water are pumped into a small reservoir in the quarry ; (4) a parting of coal about 1^ inches thick ; (5 ) the coal rests on a bed of fire-clay 3 feet thick, from which the sanitary tubes are made ; (6) below the clay, forming the base of the quarry, is about 20 feet of \" blue-bind \" (shale), from which common bricks are made. The whole series comprises a thickness of about 50 feet. The bed of fire-clay is apparently of no great extent, following a north and south direction towards Greenhill Grange, perhaps 200 yards, when it disappears, being cut off by a fault, which brings up the sandstone of the Millstone Grit series.\n\nBut the most remarkable features connected with these measures is the presence of an ancient stream-gully, which at first sight I took to be a breach made by a fault in the strata, but a little investigation showed that the gully was completely filled with the glacial till above described. The till consists of a stifi\" blue clay with a blackish sandy base, containing rounded and scratched stones. The gully takes a curvilinear direction from north-west to south-east right through the measures, and is about 25 yards wide at the summit (moor) level, maintaining nearly the same width until a depth of over 30 feet is reached, when it narrows to about 9 feet, though originally it maintained a pretty uniform width to the floor level. On the east side the strata along the margin are perceptibly bent by impact of the superincumbent mass ; on the west boundary they appear to be less compressed. The illustration prefacing the first chapter shows the main features of the strata, with the till in the gully ; the latter has no commercial value, and is now being removed. The limestones found in it are small, and never more than a pound or two in weight, whilst several boulders of local sandstone, some upwards of a ton in weight, have been removed. That the gully primarily originated by the action of water is also evident from the presence of several basin-shaped hollows in the shaly floor (where the rails are laid), which contained hundreds of pebbles, well-rounded by the swirl of waters in these cavities.\n\nA Botanist's Paradise, Seven Aeches.\n\n25\n\nWANDEEINGS AMONG WILD FLOWERS.\n\nHonour the Most High for His sweet power,\n\nThe gift of flowers ! The glory and the meekness of the earth, Telling of years not ours, but time of eld. Ere wit of man knew aught of the deep truths That spring from out their secret majesty. — H. Speight.\n\n^^M HEN the babe Nature grew into the perfection LmWH °^ womanhood she girdled the earth with kJ^j^ flowers. Her attractions play so prominent a\n\n' part in the parish of Bingley, and they have\n\ndone for ages we cannot count, that these must form the next step forward in the sequence of local history. Once on a time the old place lay encircled in leafy and many-coloured luxuriance. Great trees with their spreading arms grew around on all sides, literally embracing the old town ; swelling uplands towered above the valley gay with a thousand floral treasures, while many a rill poured forth in musical sweetness its pure flood into the valley below. To the lover of Nature the scene under such purely rustic aspects must have been charming ; a \" Throstle Nest,\" truly, as the old folks loved to call it, and a \" Throstle Nest,\" too, that lay deeply hidden as in a huge nosegay !\n\nLet memory go back for a brief space to those happy olden days whilst we wander in thought through the leafy lanes of old Bingley. I am told by aged people still living that sixty or seventy years ago the vernal season was ushered in with such a show of primroses, anemones, and celandines as few other places could boast. From Bingley Bridge to Eavenroyd the river sides were aglow with countless primroses ; the same lovely flower starred every hedge bank, and in the pastures at the bottom of Priesthorpe, where now are rows of streets, cowslips and primroses might have been gathered in hundreds. The delicate white flowers of the anemone and the yellow rays of the\n\n26\n\ncelandine also covered coppice and wood on the Harden as well as Priesthorpe sides of the town. In the Harden valley primroses are still pretty numerous, but the glory of their profusion, alas ! is gone.\n\nWhat a welcome flower is the soft-eyed primrose at each return of spring ! There is hardly a poet of rank from Chaucer onwards who has not loved it and sung its praises. Its peculiar creamy tint resembles no other British flower, and it is said we must go to the moist banks of tropical countries to flnd its likeness. Perhaps the primrose is one of those tropical species which has come down to us from very remote ages ? It delights in a warm and sheltered soil, and dwindles and perishes in cold and exposed situations. Then there are the curious arums and orchids of our woods, which are said to be descendants of old tropical forms. Have these lain sepulchred for ages under an Arctic ice-blast, until the light and warmth of another era have raised them fresh and sweet into life and beauty, though in an altered form ? We know there are certain seeds and roots that have retained their power of germination after preservation through numberless centuries.\n\nThere are many plants and flowers peculiar to our district which suggest themes for the studious and inquisitive lover of Nature. Many, doubtless, are the survivors of ancient tropical or sub-tropical forms, whilst others have been brought hither by the great glaciers from the north, described in the last chapter. Take the pretty tuberous moschatel (Adoxa moschatellina), which grows in two or three places, but notably about Beck- foot. Here, in the lap of an old glacial moraine, this interesting little plant has flourished in a wild state, probably for several thousand years. It is a characteristic plant of the cold and frozen north. It grows on the summits of Scotland's highest mountains, expanding its pale green blossoms beside the hardy saxifrages; on the Scandinavian ranges, too, and in the treeless deserts of Siberia and Lapland, as well as on the wind-swept shores of Arctic seas it revels in the sun-warmth of the short summer incident to those frigid parts. Singularly, this\n\n27\n\nplant and two or three other northern species are not found in the Calder valley ; having their westward range apparently limited by the Airedale spurs of the great Penine Chain.\n\nSome of the saxifrages found in the Bingley area also luxuriate in the far north, and never have I seen finer specimens of the beautiful flower of Parnassus (Parnassia palustris) than those which bloom among the mountains of Argyll. I have seen this plant on the edge of Rumbalds Moor, above Bingley, and I have also gathered it lately on the Cornshaw Moors, west of Keighley, at an elevation of near 1,000 feet. The golden saxifrage {Chrysosplenium) occurs in Bingley streams, and is found in the Yorkshire highlands up to an altitude of fully 2,000 feet. The little rue-leaved saxifrage (5. tridactylites), growing near Cottingley, is very rarely found on grit rock. It is partial to limestone districts, and must have been carried down the valley from the white crags of Craven. Then again, there are here certain Scandinavian insects, and there are those remarkable little insectivorous plants, the butterwort (formerly used for curdling milk, and still so in Lapland) and sundew (described by Darwin), both of which occur in our area but sparingly, though they are abundant in the moorland districts further north. The round -leaved sundew {Drosera rotundifolia) is by no means common in Airedale, yet in the Priesthorpe district, almost within a stone-throw of where I write, I have seen at least one hundred specimens in a wild state, as it only will grow. Cultivation out of its own element kills it ! In the highlands of Scotland I have seen it redden the streams for miles, and it is found all down the Penine ridge by Blackstone Edge to Derbyshire.\n\nThe distribution of plant-life is one of engrossing interest. It must not be supposed that the occurrence of this or that species in a given locality is due entirely to spontaneity or is a gift direct from the Creator. Geological formation and climatic conditions are the great governors of the plant-life of the earth. Ice and water have had a share in the local distribution of plants, and there is no doubt that winds and high gales are important factors in\n\n28\n\nthe dissemination of seed, particularly in the case of the minute spores of certain ferns and mosses. How else are we to explain the records of the delicate and rare Killarney Fern (Trichomanes radicans) in the Bingley woods except by these means ? I have often thought that high south-westerly gales must have prevailed for a long period up to the close of the Ice Age in this district, and that these sweeping winds down the Harden valley may have contributed not only to the transmission of spores, but\n\nA Home of the Killabney Fern, Bingley.\n\nto the break-up of the ice in the Bingley valley. This fern , which at one time flourished amazingly about the beautiful Lakes of Killarney, but is r\\ow, I regret, through the rapacity of collectors, almost extinct, was first recorded for Bingley by Dillenius in Ray's Synopsis (a.d. 1724). It is hardly likely to have been planted here at a time when no interest was taken in ferns, and communication with Ireland was tedious and difficult. The first monograph\n\non British Ferns was, I believe, written by J. Bolton, and published in 1785. In that work the author refers to this fern having been \" first discovered by Dr. Richardson in a Httle dark cavern, under a dripping rock, below the spring of Elm Crag well, in Bell Bank.\" In the same place Bolton saw it in plenty in 1758, and again when he visited the spot in 1782 he found the cavern had been destroyed, but a single root was discovered under a rock to the left side of the current, and about fifteen yards above the cistern. From this specimen an engraving was made for his book. Dickson and Teesdale (vide Linn. Trans., 1800) likewise record the existence of the fern at the same place. Since this time there is no evidence of its having been seen, and it is known to have been long extinct here.\n\nThe length of time covered by these valuable records leaves no room to doubt that the Killarney Fern has been a native of Bingley. But who shall measure the period of its continuance at this spot, so far from its true home ? It is, however, well-known to have been observed in some retired glens of North Wales within the last twenty years, and may perhaps be found in other places there and in England yet, whilst in many others it has probably become extinct. The plant is not so much injured by frost as by the direct rays of the sun, and those who know the situation of the recorded habitat at Bingley, which is represented in the accompanying view, must realise that no more likely spot, embracing all the conditions requisite to the life of the plant, could be found in the county of broad acres.*\n\nBut a multitude of other gems awaits attention, so now let us wander awhile through our \" fortunate fields\n\nThe situation and conditions are identical with those of the\n\nlately-discovered Irish hepatic, Juhula Hutchinsia, near Hebden Bridge, which Mr. Needham describes in the Naturalist for 1897 (p. 128) : \" Found growing on sandstones in a damp wood in a sheltered glen by a small rill, which empties itself into the river Hebden. The wood in which it grows has a westerly aspect, and is well sheltered from the north and east by lofty hills.\" This is the first record of the plant in Yorkshire ; its habitat being principally confined to the sheltered glens of Glengariff and Killarney.\n\n80\n\nand groves and flowery vales.\" Upon these things the great limner of Paradise loved to dwell, for Milton was passionately fond of flowers, both wild and cultivated, and in his blindness loved to have their forms described. Burns and Wordsworth leaned to Nature's wildings, and who has written with more soul-affection than Scotia's prince of song in his idyll. To a Mountain Daisy ? The celandine was Wordsworth's favourite flower, and who does not love to see its golden rays expand and illume the earth like bright stars in the sky after weeks of dull and clouded weather? It is the first real harbinger of spring, and in the genial days of February or early March it may usually be found lighting up the yet bare and brackish gill above Gawthorpe Hall, as well as in other similarly- sheltered places.\n\nBut the best haunts of Nature's varied treasures are, of course, on the woodland side of the valley. Going over Bingley Bridge on to the Harden road we soon pass through the stile on the left, and go through Holme House Wood and by the flower-embroidered path over the Hesp Hills to Beckfoot, a favourite walk at any season. Here we shall flnd the early purple orchis (0. mascula), whose tuberous root is said to yield a preparation equal to the finest salep brought from Persia. The bright pink meadow-lychnis, or ragged-robin, is always found plentifully about here ; then we drop on to the woody-nightshade (Solanum Dulcamara), with its frail branching stems and drooping flowers of deep purple and yellow. It belongs to an order of poisonous plants which includes the deadly nightshade, potato-flower, and tobacco-plant. The enchanter's-nightshade {Ciycma lutetiana) also grows in these woods. In different places in this neighbourhood appear likewise the various species of stitchwort, including the rare Stellaria nemovum, or broad-leaved stitchwort, which fortunately occurs in some profusion. Here, too, is the old medicinal wood-sanicle (S. europxa) and the large flowered bitter-cress (Cardamine amara). Here also grows the sweet violet {V. odorata), which puts forth its fragrant blooms in the early spring. Then there is a solitary patch of the curious fleabane, its scientific name\n\n81\n\nbeing Inula dysentenca. Anciently it was called Helenium, the heroine of the Trojan war, and the plant is said to have sprung from her tears. Year after year it appears in the same place.\n\nWalking about Harden and in the Goit Stock valley we have many precious flowering plaiits, mosses, and ferns, whose localities I dare not name, lest the despoiler lay ruthless hands upon them. The hellebore {E. latifolia), one of the rarest of our orchids, grows sparingly in two places. Herb Paris and monk's hood (Aconitum napellus) I have seen ; the latter, no doubt, a garden escape, though here far away from any garden. Several of the hawkbits also occur here, including Leontodon hirsutus, whilst the familiar \" mother-of- thousands,\" or ivy-leaved toad-flax, fringes many an old rock and cottage wall.\n\nAscending the river to Marley, we have the two geraniums, sylvatica and pratense, and along the wood bottom, taking the river-side walk, to Eavenroyd is the passion-dock or snake-root {Polygonum Bistorta), with its spikes of pale pink flowers. It grows here in profusion, and has also lately got established in the public lane. Polygonum Hydropiper, or water-pepper, is also found about here. The frog orchis [Habenaria viridis), butterfly orchis {H. cJdorantha), bog violet [Hottonia palustns), water plantain (Alisma plantago), water figwort [S. aquatica), monkey-flower (Mimulus lutens), knotted spurrey (Sagina nodosa), and three species of mint, are amongst some noteworthy plants of this district.\n\nCrossing to the heights of Gilstead and Eldwick, we find patches of good king Henry (Chenopodtum Bonus Henricus) and the pretty scarlet pimpernel {Anagallis arvensis) (in my garden at Crow Nest the variety ccerulea has cropped up among waifs of the common speedwell, dwarf spurge, &c.). We have quite a host of waifs and strays to record in the corn-lands about Glovershaw Beck. Such, for example, as the madder, grey speedwell, shepherd's needle, lamb's lettuce, field woundwort, sun spurge, &c. The butterfly orchis and the beautiful bog pimpernel {A nagallis tenella) occur on the edge of Eumbalds Moor. At Morton has been found the sow-\n\n32\n\nthistle {Sonchus oleraceus), with its succulent leaves and stems, for which pigs have a particular liking, hence its name. Coming down from Gilstead to the canal we find the rare gipsy-wort {Lycopus euyopceus) here growing by the water brink in some quantity. The rare mountain crane's-bill (G. pyreniscum) has also been noted in this locality for many years.\n\nNow we are at the Seven Arches, and truly we may wander far over the big shire before we find a spot where so many objects of interest to the naturalist are crowded into a like space. This is an attractive and never-tiring spot, very well known to members of the Bradford Naturalists' Society, who have made it a special field of investigation. Every foot of ground has been scrutinized, and probably every object recorded. I have deemed it interesting to perpetuate some aspects of this classic ground in the engraving which prefaces this chapter. My friend, Mr. John W. Carter, ex-President of the society named, is introduced into the picture ; he is shewn upon the rustic bridge which spans the stream below the Arches. Many happy hours has he and other members of the long-established Bradford Naturalists' Society spent here in fruitful quest of flower and insect and shell. It is unnecessary to enumerate all the records that have been made. It must suffice if I describe one bit of bank close to the scene of the picture. Here within a space of a few yards I have noted the following plants. Beside a spreading sycamore (whose foliage and flowers are no where more luxuriant than at this spot), where a thorn and hazel crop up among trailing brambles, springs the wild hyacinth and red-flowered campion, barren and fruiting strawberry, yellow archangel, and sweet-scented ciceley ; the fern-like foliage of the white-flowered earth- nut, rough chervil, ground ivy, and white-flowering cow parsnip ; the tender green leaves of the wood sorrel (which some believe is the true shamrock), wood violet, wild garlic, the star-like stitchworts, broad and narrow-leaved, Jack-by-the-edge, herb Eobert, and climbing bush-vetch, with the modest little Greenland moschatel half screened from view. The common ivy plant trails its shining\n\n88\n\nleaves in and among this wealth of various plant-life, whilst above and around range the sweet wild roses and stately bell-flowers, as if they would make an Eden's bower. And all this within almost an arm's-breadth of Nature's own garden ground ! Of insects and other curious things of God's own giving, each having its wondrous life-history, these are in plenty, too.\n\nBut I must stop. May all of them, I pray, continue to harbour the same sweet spot for years yet to come ; helping by their manifold beauty and diverse structure to guide us to a nobler appreciation of the best aims of life ; to grow wise in the loving and rich in the spirit of His glorious works. Spare thou, therefore, the flowers and the green sod where thou canst ! Do not let the cunning of thy hand smite the tree and floral bank for pure lust of gain ! If we had all the wealth of Croesus we should be poor if our woods and fields and flowers were gone. The meek-eyed tender wildings are as angels' looks by the thorny paths of life ! Their pure love never ceases, for while cities and temples have fallen and the stones' of man's hewing have crumbled to dust, the uninjured flowerets of the field are clothed as with immortality, and shall gladden thy soul for aye ! Let us not forget, too, that\n\n\" Other eyes than ours Were made to look on flowers ; Eyes of small birds, and insects small,\n\nThe tiniest living thing That soars on feathered wing, Or crawls among the long grass out of sight, Has just as good a right To its appointed portion of delight As any King.\"\n\nThe \"Thkostle Nest of Old England,\" Bingley.\n\n86\n\nWILD BIEDS OF BINGLEY DISTRICT.\n\nI LAP! flap! What is that? Bingley by the sea ! No, that cannot be. yet the great white wings of the sea-gull pass close before my window, the birds doubtless making for their old accustomed haunts by the quiet reaches of the river near Marley. I have seen them sometimes, too, in the retired marshy hollows about Beckfoot. Are they instinctively scouring the land in search of some long-lost prehistoric sea ? I trow not, although the vagaries of migration are yet but imperfectly understood. In this district it is generally accounted a sign of approaching stormy weather when the gulls are seen ; but they do not stay long, merely making this a halting-place in their quick passage from coast to coast. Flocks of wild geese also fly inland, resting in the same spots as the gulls, and I have noticed that their presence here has been followed by sudden storms of wind, rain, or snow. The delicate organisms of birds are, no doubt, more susceptible to atmospherical changes and alterations of season than are the larger animals. This is unquestionably one of the motives for seasonal migration, inasmuch as an equable climate conduces to the comfort and consequent health and maintenance of the species. To trace the complexities of migration to their source, and to explain the reason for the preferences of certain birds to particular climates and surroundings we must again go back to the remote Ice Age. Then there must have been a forcing southwards of certain northern types and a re-installation of certain species on the amelioration of climate as the ice withdrew. The common red-grouse of our moors, for example, possesses a close affinity with the willow-grouse (Lagopus albus) ; the latter, however, is arboreal in its habits, and the differentiation of the species can only be explained by isolation at some remote epoch when the changed\n\n36\n\naspects altered the food supply. The red-grouse is now strictly confined to the cold, bracing moors of the north, and the theory of its continuance in these latitudes since the Ice Age is very ingeniously set forth in an interesting chapter of Mr. Chas. Dixon's \" Migration of British Birds.\"\n\nMost of our so-called resident birds are more or less migratory, and this is especially applicable to a district like Bingley, where altitudinal range is so marked. It is also noteworthy that in any general migration southwards the female birds of some species greatly preponderate, and this fact did not escape the vigilant eye of Gilbert White, who, writing from Selborne in 1770, remarks upon the vast flocks of hen chaffinches appearing in that neighbourhood in winter time, and Linnaeus remarks the same thing. In this district \"resident\" birds are usually more markedly numerous in summer than in winter, and this is especially the case in high or exposed situations, like, for example, the Park top, whence there is a general exodus of bird-life on the approach of winter's cold. The winter season, however, has its compensations in the appearance of many interesting species driven by the hyperborean cold and insufficient food supply to pass the winter with us ; also some moorland types occasionally seek shelter and nutriment in the lowlands. About Crow Nest and in Priesthorpe, the ring-ouzel, which appears to be only a partial migrant, will sometimes come down for a meal to the gardens, and even hop among poultry. Large numbers of these birds are to be found on the Sussex downs in winter, and also in North Africa, and they return to our moors in spring. Harden Moor is one of their early and favourite haunts in this district. Fieldfares and redwings, which belong to the same genus, also visit us in some numbers in winter. Both these interesting species breed in Norway and Sweden, building their nests, which are most like those of the ring-ouzel, against the trunk of the spruce fir or birch, at varying heights from the ground. Flocks of wild ducks also generally pass the winter in one or two places near Bingley, and there are water-hens also to be found.\n\n37\n\nAmong the rarer winter visitors to this district have been noted, principally by Mr. E. P. Butterfield, of Wilsden, the'siskin, great crested grebe (P. cristatus), green sandpiper {T. ochropus), pochard (F. Ferina), greenshank {T. canescens), common buzzard {B. vulgaris), once an abundant resident among the crags of northwest Yorkshire, and hooded crow (C. cormx). A handsome specimen of the honey buzzard was shot by Scott, the keeper, in Blakey Wood, Marley, some ten years ago, and is now at Cuckoo Nest. In the severe weather of January, 1895, Mr. Butterfield observed several snow-bunting (P. nivalis) in the Main Street, Wilsden. I have seen numbers of these pert little birds about the snow on the summit of Ben Nevis in the warm days of mid-August. Its nest has been found as far north as Grinnel Land, at latitude 82°-83'. In February, 1896, an immature specimen of the great northern diver (C. glacialis) was shot on Baildon reservoir. It was sent for preservation to Mr. Fred. R. Kirby, taxidermist, of Bradford. It is a very rare visitor to this district ; its nearest home and breeding-place being in the far-away Western Hebrides. The true Canada-goose [B. canadensis) is also reported from the Bingley district, and I am assured by the Eev. J. Beanland, of Calverley, that it has nested on the tarn side near St. Ives, in 1887, and that he obtained three eggs from the nest. The nest was very large, and built of twigs, grass, &c., and originally contained six eggs, but three were hatched when the nest was found on June 24th, 1887,\n\nOf all seasons spring is the best time to enjoy the company of the birds, to learn something of their ways, and delight in their varied notes and songs. Who, after the long, dull, winter-time, does not rejoice at the arrival of the first summer migrants, seeking their old accustomed haunts by stream, or moor, or woodland ? Who does not welcome the familiar twin notes of the cuckoo as they issue from the depths of the green, awakening woods, or perchance a little later are heard in the solitudes of the far-extending moorlands ? In the glistening skies of April the lark, too, keeping tune by the vibration of his wings, floods the air with joyous melody.\n\n38\n\n\" Now rings the woodland loud and long, The distance takes a lovelier hue, And drown'd in yonder living blue, The lark becomes a sightless song.'\n\nAs Tennyson hymns the praise of spring. Now is the time when Bingley's woods . are fresh and fair, and a thousand feathered choristers have gathered about the \"Throstle Nest,\" and are filling the air with amorous song. Some birds, however, which are with us all the year round, sing at all seasons. Such is the redbreast, whose smart, vivacious airs enliven many a cold and frosty day's walk.\n\nBut in Spring, when haunts are \"green and bright,\" with light heart and buoyant step we take to woodland paths, climb the invigorating heights, and join the living voices of wild nature once more. I invite my friend, Mr, E. P. Butterfield, of Wilsden, to join me in some of these pleasant rambles, for to him, more than to anyone else, I think, we owe our best and fullest knowledge of the wild birds of this district. Away, then, we go — one day by Beckfoot, and by the river side to Cottingley ; another day up to the heights of Marley ; and on another through the lovely Harden valley and by the sequestered shades of Hallas. All these ways are ways of pleasantness, and abound with much and varied interest. Mr. Butterfield is a keen and accurate observer, and has devoted a large portion of his leisure to the study of Nature, and of local birds particularly he has made a special study.\n\nOn one occasion I met him by appointment in the neighbourhood of Beckfoot. While we stood discussing some object, \"There,\" said he, \"keep your elbow off that wren's nest.\" I suddenly looked round. \" Where, pray, is it?\" I asked. *' Why, there,\" he answered, pointing to a very small aperture in the grassy bank, which none but the eye accustomed to such haunts could have detected. I peered in, and there was the curious dome-shaped nest, evidently just completed. The female bird is usually the architect of the home, but the male amuses himself often with nest-building, though he does not give his work the same delicate finish which is peculiar\n\n89\n\nto that of the female. Many of these male nests are to be met with during the breeding season unoccupied, and generally go by the name of \" cock nests.\" Some good people may think these nests had been robbed or deserted, and, doubtless, too many nests are, yet be it remembered with respect to the wren and the robin, who cheer us with song all the year round —\n\n\" Who hunts the robin or the wren Will never prosper, sea or land.\"\n\nOnce a robin built its nest in a watering-can suspended from the roof of a greenhouse at Wilsden. This bold little bird makes its home in odd places sometimes.\n\nThe Beckfoot district is a good locality for observing many kinds of birds and their ways. In and about the stream the handsome wagtails, both pied and grey, are commonly to be met with, and it is also a favourite haunt of the thrushes. Bingley well deserves its title of the \" Throstle Nest of Old England,\" for these birds were formerly very abundant here, and the throstle's rich and fluent notes could be heard on every hand. Strange to relate, for two or three years after the almost Arctic winter of 1879-80 they were remarkably scarce, but they are now fairly numerous again, and in Spring-time, when the hedgerows are green and the milk-white flowers of the thorn spread a delicious fragrance around, it is a treat to listen to the male bird pouring forth his love-song to his mate from some blossoming bough.\n\nBut come, now, let us take a walk, the day is quite perfect ! Along the verdant glade we leisurely go, listening to the many gladsome voices, as the golden sunlight streams down among the tall trees upon the moss-velvet of the old walls, also brightening our onward path. Ah ! soon we stop and peer into a bush close beside the way. And what do we see ? A throstle's nest, with its lovely freight of speckled eggs, snugly laid among flowers, gray lichen, and bowery fern, and screened by full, overhanging trees. A pretty sight, surely ! Brush the screen away, and now, my friend, step into the picture, and let us try to commemorate your good work and the\n\nIn the Habden Valley.\n\n41\n\n\" Throstle Nest of Old England ! \" Mr. Butterfield, after some hesitation, meets the wish ; a camera is brought, and the tout ensemble is transferred to the sensitive glass, eventually to form the illustration prefacing this chapter.\n\nNow, going towards Harden, we notice several sparrow- hawks, whose flight very much resembles that of the cuckoo, and when on the wing the latter is often mistaken for it. Hundreds of cuckoos for this reason are sacrificed to the keeper's gun every season throughout England. The sparrow-hawk, by the way, is not now a common bird in this district, though a few still breed here. In the woods owls are not uncommon, and on a calm night it is impressive to listen to their vehement conversation : \" Quotha ! tu whit ; tu whit ! tu whoo ! oh-h, h, h ! ! \" ringing on the night air. Mr. Butterfield tells me he once found a tawny owl's nest in a rabbit-hole near Wilsden, a most unusual place. The stockdove also breeds in the woods, and for more than twenty years a colony of jackdaws have reared their sable nestlings here. Some jackdaws have been taught to talk very fairly, but in this respect they do not equal either the magpie or the raven.\n\nContinuing our walk by Bank End, my friend related a singular discovery he once made here. Everyone knows a wasp's nest, made from particles of sound timber, which are kneaded up with the insect's saliva, and then moulded into fine combs. Well, one of these curious structures was found in a hole in the ground, and it was resting partly on the back of a toad, which lay motionless in a state of torpor. The creature had, perhaps, been drawn by the warmth of the nest into its remarkable hiding-place, and had it moved afterwards would, no doubt, have been stung to death.\n\nIn the charming Goit Stock valley we meet with a great variety of bird-life. The lanes are alive with redbreasts, chaffinches, throstles, blackbirds, and titmice. It is amusing to watch the great titmouse and blue titmouse pegging away at the bark of some well-crusted elm trees to obtain the larvae. Here, too, we get a sight of the handsome little gold-crest, whose true home is\n\n42\n\namong the Norwegian pine-forests. He is the smallest of European birds, and remains with us through the severest winters, a few probably remaining to breed in suitable places. In early autumn he may sometimes be seen with the gathering swallows, wheatears, tits, &c., in Bingley Park, and how interesting it is to see some of the birds tossing themselves into every conceivable attitude whilst hunting for food !\n\nThe rare hawfinch has also been noted in the Goit Stock valley, and at Manywells a specimen was shot. The lesser white-throat, green and great spotted woodpeckers, kingfisher, and pied flycatcher have likewise nested in the district. The beautiful kingfisher was once numerous in the Bingley becks and about the river, but the rapacity of traders in their plumage has greatly diminished the numbers. Happily, however, an improved taste has brought about a decline in the demand, and the birds, I understand, are everywhere becoming more numerous. Both the kingfisher and the dipper used to nest in the vicinity of Goit Stock waterfall. To get to its nest the wet-loving dipper has sometimes been known to dash through the torrent of the descending cascade. He has been met with far north, even within the Arctic Circle ; a true denizen of mountain and upland streams, and in his lonely hermitage, if not molested, is as happy as the day is long.\n\nBut my ramblings after these fairy wights at Bingley must here end. How long some of them may have dwelt here or have come hither, God alone knows. But during those bleak ages, in the very twilight of our history, when the bright moon silvered the wide-sheeted ice, casting a glamour over the lone, frosted wilds ; or the bristling sun at mid-day pierced with his rays the lofty glacier- walls in Bingley's time-wrought vale, the fowl of the air were moved by to irresistible impulse, and came hither at God's bidding. And here, forsooth, they remained until by the beckoning of His hand that bade the ice-storm cease, man once more appeared.\n\nTHE ADVENT OF MAN.\n\nThe Aborigenes\n\nHE deluge following the Ice Age rendered, as I have said, this immediate district uninhabitable by man for a long period subsequently. In some parts of North England evidences of a post-glacial people are to be found in implements made of the bone of reindeer and in the galleried tombs and dwellings, which are identical with those of the Esquimaux of the present day. Implements and weapons of bone and stone were used at this time, and it was not until the commerce in flint had been established by Neolithic traders that flint was adopted in the manufacture of these articles in this district. The rude flint implements picked up on our moors are probably of more recent date than is generally supposed ; mere crudeness of make cannot be accepted as a criterion of antiquity, and the oldest of these articles are, as I hope to shew, not older than the late Goidelic settlers of the great Celtic immigration. Metal, of course, was well- known to the ancient Britons as well as to the Romans, yet stone and flint continued to be used even down to historic times. Not, however, until the Goidelic immigration have we any positive knowledge of man and his work in this district.\n\nThe Celts\n\nOn the westward emigration of the Indo-Celtic races the aborigenes were driven further and further north, and that branch denominated the Goidels or Gauls of France and Switzerland overspread Britain, and eventually\n\n44\n\nobliterated the existence of the original inhabitants of the island. Gradually they died out in the remote western isles of Scotland, though in St. Columba's time 1,300 years ago, we are told their language was still living ; a few men of rank being found on the mainland opposite the Isle of Skye with whom the great missionary could not converse in the Goidelic tongue.* These Goidels from Gaul were in turn driven to the western and northern mountains on the great Brythonic irruption or second Celtic wave, yet so largely and firmly had the original Goidelic or Gallic tribes established themselves in Britain that their language in this country was almost universal, and even so late as the Eoman conquest w^s spoken by the bulk of the people in the north and west.\n\nIt is with both of these Celtic peoples that we are concerned in our district. They have long since gone, but some little knowledge of their mode of life and language has been preserved in our midst even to the present day. In the primitive sheep-scoring numerals, hereafter mentioned, and in such names as bailey, hel, beldune, cat or cath, bron or brown, pen-y-thorn, crummach, and possibly Dobrudden, we have evidences of dialectal forms of these old Celtic tongues. An immemorial tradition also exists in this district respecting the Druids' Altar, and in the ancient earthworks, marked stones, and stone circles, single and double-ringed, on the moors, as well as in the tumuli and their contained remains ; these all point to the possession of this district by the first as well as by the second family of Celtic invaders.\n\nThe best example of a stone circle in the vicinity of Bingley lies on the moor close to the parish boundary, on land belonging to Mr. Fawkes, of Farnley Hall. It is a complete circle, consisting of about twenty stones, placed close together (a very unusual arrangement), from two to four feet high, the circumference being about 35 yards. An excavation was made in the middle of it some years ago, when bits of flint were found, but no trace of burial.\n\n• Cormac, writing in the 9th century, gives us to understand that the larn, a non-Aryan language, lingered in Ireland until the 8th century.\n\n45\n\nIt is built on a slight slope of the moor, facing the south, and is now much concealed by heather. It is, doubtless, the oldest known evidence of man's handiwork remaining in the neighbourhood of Bingley, and there is small doubt that it was originaUy intended to fence a burial, such \" Druids' Circles \" being primarily meant to enclose places of sepulchre in the same way that walled enclosures came to be adopted round our churchyards. A large flat stone on the top side, about three yards distant, is marked with cups and channels, and probably was in the centre of the circle originally.\n\nThe Goidels were Druids, and they worshipped the sun, moon, and stars ; the Brythons, so far as is known, were\n\nAncient Stone Circle, neak Bingley.\n\nnot under the sway of Druidism, but were polytheists of the Aryan type. Caesar goes so far as to say that Druidism originated in Britain, but with his limited knowledge of the country, the statement must be doubted. It is more than probable that it was the common religion of the aborigenes of the Continent as well as of this country, although some authorities maintain that it was introduced into Britain by the Phoenicians, and did not entirely disappear until the Roman idolators cut down the sacred groves, and ultimately suppressed the practice. I cannot, however, conceive that Baal worship prevailed at\n\n46\n\nBaildon because the present name lends itself to that convenient construction. In the oldest records the name is spelled Beldune, which is pure Goidelic for Oxford {pel) at a hill [dune) (its Irish equivalent dun, genitive dune), having reference in all probability to the old road which came up the valley, oxidi forded the Aire at Baildon Bridge, then ascending the old foot-road up the hill to the Celtic encampment on the common, with its stone circles and tumuli, existing to our own day. Bel-hdink, Bingley, is another instance of an ancient ford or entrance to a Goidelic settlement, which I shall presently show was on the Bailey Hills.\n\nIt must not be supposed that the Celtic tribes always clung to the hills. They took refuge there chiefly by stress of conquest. We find them often living in the midst of marshes, in lakes, or upon islands protected by artificial ditches or by natural waters. Both Caesar and Strabo tell us that they generally chose a place well shut in by woods, with a good supply of water near at hand, and on such a spot they would build their huts and collect their cattle. The prevalence of Brythonic words about the hills within this district seems to me to point more clearly to the Goidelic occupation of the valley, and on the conquest of the latter to a complete Brythonic possession of both hill and dale, rather than to the Brythonic withdrawal on the Anglian irruption. In such places as Brown Hill (Bryth- Celtic, hron, a hill-slope), Ive Bridge, Gildas-stead, which are all adjacent to the Bingley valley, we see the Celt ; the same names occurring in the ancient Celtic provinces of Britany and Cornwall. I suspect also that Fern Cliff, below Gilstead, has nothing to do with ferns, but betrays its Cymric Celtic origin in the root ffynnon, cognate with the Goidelic fuaran, a fountain, well, or gushing water, in allusion to the copious springs which issue from that side of the hill. The old pronunciation of the name vf&afearnan or f earn, and I have seen the name in old parish books, to wit in the minutes of the overseers last century, written Fearingcliff.\n\nBut to turn to the original settlement. I have said that after the Ice Age the glacial floods converted the\n\n47\n\nBailey Hills into an island, and it is very probable they retained this character down to Roman times, and even to our own day the valley side of them through which the railway runs was almost in the condition of a lake, I am persuaded that no better site could possibly have been chosen for habitation, at a time when the district was densely wooded, particularly with mast-bearing trees, and the woods and thickets were the haunts of wild beasts. It is on this site that the traditional \"castle \" once stood. Now these \" castle hills,\" applied to prehistoric camps and forts, are universal, and many a time as I have wandered over the assumed site of Dodsworth's \"castle \" on the Bailey Hills it has occurred to me that a tradition existed before Dodsworth's day that the hills had been occupied with some manner of fortification, and that old and perhaps extensive foundations were in Dodsworth's time still pointed out. These proofs of some \" castle \" of unknown origin would gain credence in the popular mind, which time has not obhterated, but rather strengthened. Such is the prevailing belief that we find the sites of many hills and mounds, now or in past times occupied with ancient earthworks or foundations, still known as \" Castle Hills.\" Fortunately, the name \" Bailey Hills \" has been preserved, while the name \" Castlefields\" is merely a later adjunct of the castle theory.\n\nNow, in the absence, so far as I can discover, of any written record or evidence of a castle, or of any reference whatever to such save the tradition mentioned by Dodsworth, I am suspicious that no post-Norman castle ever existed. But even if it can be proved to have existed it will not operate against my deduction that the Bailey Hills was the original home of the Celtic settlers at Bingley. Physically, botanically, philologically, and by the evidence of actual remains it can be proved to have been such. The name Bailey is older than any personal name that can be applied to it, and, if I mistake not its meaning, this word baile, baily, or hally is Goidelic-Celtic for a fortified place, a home, a town or settlement, and is at the root of the words vallum, wall, &c. Such, for example, are Bally more (great town), Ballymena (middle\n\n48\n\ntown), Ballycastle, Balmoral, Balachulish, anciently Baile-na-caolish, &c. The name baile (pron. baily) is a frequent compound in Goidelic or Gaelic place-names in Scotland and Ireland, and Dr. O'Donovan, a well-known authority, says that the word is frequently used in old Irish to signify a castle or military station. Then again, we have at the most likely approach to the Bailey Hill, namely, at the ancient ford at Ireland Bridge, the name Bel-bank, and this word bel signifies, in the same Goidelic dialect, a ford or mouth, or in a secondary sense, as stated in Blackie's \" Place Names,\" an entrance into any place. This is, therefore, as I shall shew in discussing the subject of old roads, the most ancient approach to Bingley and to the original British settlement on the Bailey Hills.\n\nOn the Hills, in a field next the cemetery (the site of the traditional \" castle \"), is a camp-like enclosure, occupying a flat hollow of about 1,600 square yards. It is bounded on the north and west sides by a raised fence, that on the north side falling deeply and sharply to the enclosure, and affording capital shelter on that side. In the field beyond, parallel with the wall separating the Grammar School land (now the Show Field) and Mr. Butler's estate, is a rampart-like bank, partly natural, extending from the school buildings right across the hill to the river, and is nearly complete all the way, a length of about 200 yards, in some places being 20 feet above the natural field-level. The north face has, no doubt, sloped naturally, but has been cut back into a precipitous front, while old ash and sycamore trees, with boles four or five feet in circumference, grow upon it, proving, at anyrate, that the hill was scarped or cut back before any house or building was built on the Hills. It is a kind of defence, natural or artificial, that one may expect to find in such a place, being to the north, whence danger came, and appears of similar import to those extensive lines of earth and stones that are found stretching across many of the Yorkshire dales. It is designedly thrown up to a great height above the river, and at the opposite extremity, in Mr. Town's garden, there are some very large mounds, obviously older than any garden-tips, though they may be\n\n49\n\ncast-up mounds of the old kiln-workers. I have not heard that any relics have been discovered at this point, because it has never been dug, but on the south side, where the cemetery is now, a couple of stone querns or hand-mills have been dug up ; one of them, a fine and perfect specimen, is now in the Bingley Free Library. It is marked \" Roman,\" but there is no evidence of the Roman occupation of the site ; it is more likely to be ancient British or Anglo- Celtic {see illustration at the end of this section).*\n\nSo far the prehistoric bailey or castle. Over the river and above this ancient rampart and enclosure, rises the far-famed Druids' Altar, \" a name it has borne of yore, and shall do a thousand more.\" It is not for me to draw fancy pictures of the traditional rites of the Druids, but will content myself by adducing such facts as support the\n\nSince the above was written I have learnt that this fine quern\n\nwas found while digging a grave near a Scotch fir-tree, about fifty yards east of the chapel. Near here, I am told, are traces of what looks like an ancient wall. It has been discovered extending in a north and south direction for a distance of about 20 yards, when the gravel walk is reached ; then it continues on the opposite side in the same direction, occurring in every grave for a further space of nearly 20 yards. A great many of the stones have been removed, and have been utilised for the walls and steps on the paths leading down to the river ; others have been tipped in the heap for the new walk parallel with the river, now in course of formation. The stones are not rounded boulders, but flat and rudely shaped, some of them being 6 to 8 inches thick and from 2 to 3 feet long, and must be from 2 to 3 cwt. in weight. The stones are not mortared, and from the massive character of the work there appears little doubt of its antiquity. In places it is from 7 to 8 feet below the present surface, but owing to the disturbance of the soil by the 17th century lime-burners (see post) it is difficult to say what has been the original elevation. Mr. Greaves, the registrar, tells me that another apparent wall has been found extending for some yards north and south on the north side of the main walk, near the church. It runs parallel with the above. Portions of a more recent wall are visible below the main walk above the river. When this path was laid the top of this wall was used for the foundation of the wall supporting the path aboVe. The appearance, character, height, and thickness of these peculiar walls I have had no opportunity of viewing, and in the absence of fuller infonnation, I give these particulars with every reservation. I have thought they might be the wall-stones of old kilns, but am assured the wall is continuous in one direction for the space so far discovered.\n\n50\n\npopular belief in this romantic spot. The situation of the noble-looking rock is perfect for its purpose ; it faces the rising sun, and commands a magnificent prospect of the valley below, while the rosy hues of departing day are often seen reflected on its surface. From the old bailey by the ancient road from the ford to the mystic rock, may we not indulge the picture of the tribes in procession, led by the venerable fathers through the sacred groves of oak on the day of sacrifice or thanksgiving ? For thanks to God or the all-seeing Power have gone for^h from man from the time of our first knowledge of him on earth ; and the idols of his worship or temples of his faith are among the earliest relics we possess of his belief in a Creator and in the immortality of the soul. From the Celtic word for the oak, derw, the Druids took their name, and the oak has been a conspicuous tree in the neighbourhood of the Altar from time immemorial. The tree or its timber were indispensable at their great festivals, and when living with the mistletoe upon it was held in the highest reverence. The mistletoe is rarely found on the oak, says the Eev. C. A. Johns in The Forest Trees of Britain, but when it was discovered the Druids went forth clad in white robes, and cut pieces off with a golden knife. It was always gathered at a particular age of the moon, at the beginning of their year, and should any chance to fall to the ground it was considered an omen of misfortune to the people.\n\nI have endeavoured to ascertain if the mistletoe has ever been found growing on the oak near the Druids' Altar, and I am assured by Miss Maud, of Seattle, U.S.A., that she herself gathered it there when a girl, now nearly seventy years ago. She told me on her recent visit to Bingley that she well remembered the circumstance, and was surprised on reading a book on the subject that stated there were only some dozen places in England where the mistletoe had been observed growing on oak, and Bingley was not mentioned. If the place has produced mistletoe this century, I can see no reason why it should not have done so before the Roman conquest, and in this event it is more than probable it would form an important factor in the selection of a home of the early\n\n61\n\nCeltic Druids. Oak, moreover, has always grown in plenty around Bingley, and that portion of the town bordering on Chapel Lane and the Dubb has been an old forest or pasture of oak, known in Anglo-Saxon times as mcest-stcsl now (Mastal), from the oak-mast it yielded in the fattening of swine, and in times of scarcity as food for the people.\n\nThe old rites and customs of these early British possessors of Bingley have almost entirely succumbed to newer beliefs, yet I have not the smallest doubt that when they held Bingley the well-known Midsummer fires blazed on the hill-tops, and at what more likely spot than the Druids' Altar ? These Beltane fires continued in some parts of Yorkshire down to the present century, but at Giggleswick they were lighted on St. Lawrence's Eve, the 9th of August, yet no one seems to know why that particular day was chosen. At Bingley the preservation of the half-burnt yule-log from one Christmas Eve to the next is the simple survival of the Druids' \" perpetual fire,\" for once every year all the fires of a British town were extinguished, and re-lighted from the sacred fire of the Druids. This sacrifice of fire was the visible thank-offering for the sun's beneficent gifts, and our present harvest- thanksgivings are the survival of these ancient British rites.\n\nIt does not appear that Druidism nor the language of its followers survived but in a small measure the Brythonic conquest. With but few exceptions, the Celtic names of places around Bingley apparently belong to the later invaders, and their study and consideration are essential in the proper elucidation of the early history of Bingley. Some of these names have reference also to the Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian possession of the district, which will be dealt with in chronological sequence. I have already pointed out some Celtic names, and I need at present only refer to the old sheep-scoring numerals which have survived in the district of Bingley to the present time, though probably now known to very few. They are, however, evident in the corrupt jingles of children's games where counting-out is used (5^^ Folk Lore). From Mr. Edward Smith (aged 80), of Cowling (late of Harden), I have taken down the numbers as he remembered hearing them from old men at Harden\n\n52\n\nwhen a young man. I have not followed the doubtful Celtic orthography, but spell the words exactly as they are pronounced in English : —\n\n1 — Era. 6 — Southa. 11 — Era-dicks. 16 — Era-pumpit.\n\n2— Tera. 7 — Loutha. 12 — Tera-dicks. 17— Tera-pumpit.\n\n3 — Tethera. 8 — Cobbera. 13 — Tethera-dicks. 18 — Tethera-pumpit.\n\n4 — Fethera. 9 — Dobbera. 14 — Fethera-dicks. 19 — Fethera-pumpit.\n\n5 — Pimps. 10 — Dicks. 15 — Pumpit. 20 — Jiggit.\n\nThese numerals differ from any I have seen printed, and my aged informant repeated them to me several times, not always in the same sequence, yet always in pentads of five, or by finger arithmetic, being the oldest form of counting. Sometimes he placed the set 16 to 20 before the 11 to 15, but the above is obviously the correct order. It may be noted that 1 and 2 are rendered era, tera, while in all versions I have seen n takes the place of r. Thus the Ehode Island Indians say ene, tene, tether, f ether, pip ; the Massachusetts Indians eeni, teeni, tuderi, federi, fip ; in Swaledale it is, yan, tean, tethera, methera, mick ; in Nidderdale, jk^Am, tehn, eduru, pedum, pips. An old man at Bingley, who was a coal agent in the Midland Goods Yard, used to be called \" Yan West \" because he always counted in these numbers. I am told he came from near Colne.\n\nIt is stated that these numbers originated in the Brit- Welsh kingdom of Strathclyde, and that all the versions are but dialectal forms having one common origin ; the North American Indians having learnt them from early English or Welsh settlers. That they really sprang from Old Kymric, and are found throughout the Brythonic region from the Dee to the Solway, is evident, because it is only in the Welsh dialect of the Kymry that this method of counting in fives prevails. In Irish, Manx, and other Goidelic provinces the system and language are dijQferent, but into these distinctions I cannot here enter.\n\nThere is no reason to doubt that the Brythonic element entered largely into the aggregate population of the Bingley district, and that the language of these people prevailed down and beyond the Koman conquest, when the establishment of the Koman station at Ilkley diffused the habits, manners, and language of the Latins among the\n\n68\n\nBritons of these parts. We have the authority of no less a geographer than Ptolemy (a.d. 150) that Olicana (Ilkley) was one of the chief towns of the Brigantes, and these Brigantes were the later comers, the stronger, privileged, free-men, who drove oflf the older race, and established themselves on their best lands. The Brigantes, or Brythons, were a hardy and courageous people, and gave the Romans, perhaps, more trouble than any of the other tribes in their conquest of the island. I do not think the Romans troubled Bingley, but directed their energies rather to the greater station at Ilkley, which they ultimately reduced to submission. This I judge to be the case in spite of the Brown Hill entrenchment, which I take to be a later work, for while the name brown is derived from a Brigantian term (bron) for such a situation as that which it occupies (now the Park), I have many reasons for considering that this post was a refuge for a time on the Anglian or Pictish irruption after the Roman evacuation.\n\nQdebn kound on Bailey Hills.\n\nThe Romans\n\nwe know, penetrated this romantic district in the time of Agricola, who was appointed legate of Britain in a.d. 78. This great Roman leader, after a very determined effort, beset with unnumbered difficulties, conquered the Brythonic province of the Ordovices in North Wales, and made\n\n54\n\nDeva (Chester) his headquarters and starting point of his wonderful expedition through the forests and marshes of Lancashire and Yorkshire. Some idea of the extent of these primeval woods and the difficulty of passage may be gathered from the fact that even at the time of the Norman conquest there were not less than 260,000 acres of more or less tangled forests in the single region between the Mersey, Calder, and Ribble. Nearly the whole of Airedale, with its tributary valleys, was one continuous thicket, and the valley bottom was a vast swamp. Above these rose the high moors, which the Romans chose, not only as affording an easier passage, but also for the better observation of the movements of the natives. With them they brought, often by accident, the seeds of various plants and herbs hitherto unknown in England, just as in the same way many kinds of weeds and wayside flowers were introduced into France by the invading armies of Germany during the great war of 1870-71. So, too, with birds and beasts. The domestic cat, for instance, which is mentioned in Egyptian inscriptions as far back as 1680 B.C., was brought from Rome with the conquering legions to England, where it had been hitherto unknown. Likewise the rabbit was undoubtedly an importation from Rome at the same time.\n\nBut let us turn to the Roman steps in this district. It is, as I have said, not likely that the Romans made any attack on Bingley, nor can the discovery of the great chest of Roman coins at Morton Banks be interpreted into an attack from this quarter, which rendered, as some suppose, the sudden concealment of the chest necessary. As coins from the time of Nero, a.d. 54, to Pupienus, a.d. 238, were found in the horde it is obvious the chest was buried long after the local Britons were at peace with the Romans and under the Roman power. The road from Aldborough to Manchester, via Ilkley, which for several miles passed through the parish of Bingley, was also undoubtedly made during the latter days of the Empire, probably by the Emperor Philip, who reigned a.d. 244-8. Some of the mile-stones on the Roman road from Warrington to Lancaster have his name upon them, and there are good\n\n65\n\nreasons for believing that the roads northwards and eastwards through the hilly regions of the Penines were made about the same period, or after a general restoration of the camps in the time of the Emperor Severus. That they were also assisted in this enterprise by the conquered Brigantes appears evident by the discovery of the well-known valuable Roman altar-stone at Thick HoUins, in Greetland, which is dedicated \" to the god of the states of the Brigantes and of the deities of the Emperor [Severus].\" This shews that not only were Eomans and\n\nRoman Road on Blackstone Edge.\n\nBritons of this district in friendly alliance early in the third century, but that paganism was yet rampant in these parts.\n\nFrom Manchester the road came over Blackstone Edge, where extensive and perfect remains of it still exist. I present a view of it as it appears on the western slope of the moor — perhaps the finest existing example of a Roman roadway in the North of England — which shews a causeway 16 feet wide, with a central massive pavement about 3 feet wide, furrowed on each side, caused, doubtless, by the abrasion of wheeled vehicles. The entire road is composed of wrought blocks of millstone grit, laid in a\n\n56\n\nfoundation of sand and rubble, and the whole appears as sound and almost as perfect as when first laid down more than 1,600 years ago. This road passed between Halifax and lUingworth, continuing thence through Denholme Park, where it .was visible as a paved way about 100 yards south of Denholme Gate, and again a little to the east of Denholme Mills. It then went by Cullingworth and Hainworth, but its course here is less certain. Some have supposed that it passed up old Dolphin Lane, which terminates peculiarly, without any further traces of its continuance, on Harden Moor. But Dolphin Lane is too much east of that directness which is a characteristic of Roman roads to lend such assumption in the least degree probable. I have carefully examined the ground many times, and my own impression is that it ran to the west of Cullingworth by the old Turf Lane and Benty Lee Lane, on the west side of Cats"
