        "text": "The Dying Detective\n\nSherlock Holmes gets a visit from Adelaide Savage who is worried about her husband Victor's increasing habit of smoking opium to heighten his powers for writing poetry. After a dinner date resulting in Victor's demise, all fingers point towards opium abuse. But with Holmes on the case, it seems that it was murder - and a very deceptive one at that!\n\nPrivate Lives\n\nAfter shooting a child killer who was deemed untouchable, Scotland Yard's Albert Tyburn is sent to 1930s Kenya to head a new criminal division of the small police force in Nairobi. He investigates the death of Lady Daphne Ellesmere as a murder, though his boss Commissioner Burkitt and the coroner insist her death by lion attack was an accident."
