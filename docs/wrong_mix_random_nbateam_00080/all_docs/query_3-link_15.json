In 24 books and over 12’000 lines Homer follows Odysseus, the “Master of plots and plans” and King of Ithaca, on his adventures after the decade-long Trojan War. Across another ten years while he was presumed dead, our hero saw all his crew-mates dying horrendous deaths. He was lured by sirens, killed a cyclops, and faced a series of horrible feats.\n\nJames Purefoy to Lead THE ODYSSEY at Jermyn Street Theatre\n\nJermyn Street Theatre has today announced casting for its marathon performance of Homer’s The Odyssey, translated by Emily Wilson.
