An elderly woman remembers her dead husband over a cup of tea. And two strangers arrive from nowhere in the middle of the night.\n\nSapphire and Steel are gone.\n\nSapphire and Steel are here.\n\nEpisode One –\n\nWe hear someone pouring tea from a teapot, we hear the person walk around the room, and sit down, then the voice of a old woman. She says that first thing she did when her husband dead was to Dyson the house from top to bottom, because she reasons it’s something you do and she hear it on Woman’s Hour. But adds back then it was a Hover, nobody has a Dyson back then will not on Cranbury Road anyway, though she wouldn’t to it pass a Mrs G at 37, we was the one in the street to get a electric oven and makes her own bread and her olive peter needs to be tasted to be believed. Not her cup of lapsang souchong, Then she wouldn’t be offered it anyway. Non of them would anyway. They avoid her mostly even now, because she believes that they are embarrassed. Oh they will say “Hello”. Bernice from the wool shop even treated her to a walnut slice once. But they didn’t really talk. Bernice talked about her husband sponsored parachute jump, for the blind, old woman corrects herself and says the visually impaired, and the charity that organises a very hot on it. As is Bernice’s husband. Norman she thinks his name is. She says that she told them, that in her day the blind were blind and the deaf were deaf, and mentally handicapped people didn’t have learning difficulties, they were put in a home.\n\nThen there is the sound of time moving around, the old woman pours more tea and continues to talk. Saying that she vacuumed, dusted and polished everything she could see, and even cleared out the cupboard under the stairs and she found a few surprises in there. A wind-up clockwork donkey that her mother had brought back from Benidorm, it had lost it Eeyore which most have been the rust, but its tail still when round, she put on the mantelpiece for a while trying to find it comforting, but in the end it didn’t go with pottery pigs. So she gave it to woman who comes are the plastic bag or tried to, the woman told her it says quite clearly on the bag the only except fabrics, old pillowcases and stuff. The old woman even asked who was collecting for. The woman said children with cerebral palsy. Well they would love that donkey the old woman tells her, it would give something to at. And then she offers some her late husband underwear, but when she came back the plastic bag woman had gone. Leaving the donkey, had having gone to the trouble finding the underwear she was going to put it to good use.\n\nWe hear a collection of ticking clocks and someone opening a big heavy door, from the outside. Then the voice of a young woman. She calls out the name Davey, we walks through the rooms and calls upstairs for Davey again, but no one answers her. She starts humming to herself.\n\nThere is also the sound of whispering\n\nThe old woman says that her late husband Richard would have a fit if saw her use his underwear as a dusters, he was always some what particular about his underwear. Teller her to always put clean underwear when your going out as you never know when your going to be hit by a bus. However she always thought he was being silly, because if you had been hit by a bus the last thing your underwear would be is clean. Time is now getting louder. But it turns out that she was right. Because her brother in law Samuel, was hit by a bus and if the sate of his trousers where anything to go by. Richard took Samuel’s death, he gave up a little, because they were close. And that she believes that Richard’s cancer took hold at Samuel’s funeral, it was like it had been just sitting there, watching to go off like a time bomb. And losing Samuel was like lighting the fuse. Time takes hold of her word repeating them over again, as if they were suck record and then we hear the clocks again.\n\nAnd once again, the young woman calls out Davey, but there is no answer. Just time echoing around, then something takes hold of her. She calls for help and then for Davey.\n\nThe old woman, is still repairing. Lighting the fuse, the voice becomes distorted as if on a radio and the young woman switches it off and says oh Davey. Then there is loud knocking on the door she entered.\n\nThe knocking get louder, the young woman goes to the door, and Asks.\n\nWho is it’s?\n\nPollyanna Elizabeth Clegg a soft sounding female Australian voice say.\n\nYes.\n\nYou asked for help\n\nYes. I did but.\n\nThen she unlocks the door.\n\nStanding there are two young people, a woman and a man. Polly asks them why they are here and tells them she doesn’t know them. The woman doesn’t answer her first question but says it doesn’t matter and everything in under control. What do you mean. Polly asks. Oh she’ll be right the young man says he has similar accent to the woman. What, Polly says. The man tells her that everything is going to all right. Why, Because we’re here. The young woman is now moving around the house open doors. Polly turns to the young man. Who does she think she is just. She a hard ass the young man tells Polly and that she will get used it. Polly tells him that she has no right to just. The young man stops her, by asking her did she almost disappear. Yes. And you what him back. Yes. Well it looks like we’re the right blokes for the job. The young woman shouts Steel.\n\nWe hear the voices of time whispering again.\n\nThere is a sound of a tape recorder being switched on, and we hear the old woman again, she say that is was awful, his cancer adding that she can’t deny it, and by the end he lost all his dignity, and it may sound heartless. By she’s says called a spade a spade, at the end Richard was ugly and she couldn’t bear to look at him, she didn’t even tell him that she was expecting, saying wasn’t being cruel, it would have been cruel to tell him. Cruel to him and me, cruel to the baby\n\nWell Steel asks, It’s an old house, 18th century, the young woman tells him, she using some kind power. Full of old furniture. Nothing from this century. Not even the paper, he asks. What. The newspaper on the kitchen table. The young woman tells him the date 14 March 1987, 21 years old. Polly says that there a pile of them in the larder, and she likes to read them. As it get boring all on your own. Steel asks her is here on her a lot. Most of the time it’s her and Davey. Still using her powers, the young woman tells Steel David Henry Hawkhurst. Sometimes there are others, but they stay the other side of the house. The other side. The young woman says the east wing was built in 1950s, when the Grange was converted into a hospital. Steel asks the young woman is it still a hospital. Not anymore. Polly says she doesn’t like the people who stay that side. Then asks Steel who they are.\n\nSteel, says he is Steel and the young woman is Sapphire. Polly says Steel is a funny name. So Pollyanna, he says Polly says no one calls her that, adding that sometimes Davey calls her Polly pocket, when his in good mood. Sapphire calls to Steel tells him off. Steel says he was only being friendly. Sapphire adds that they are here to do a job. Out loud Sapphire asks Polly when was the last time she saw David Hawkhurst, she calls her Pollyanna. She says about a hour ago she when down to the bay and watched the sunset. Sapphire asks he’d disappeared when you’re come back. Polly says she doesn’t know he wants here when she got back to kitchen. Sapphire then asks were was he when she left. In his bedroom, listening to music adding that she asks a lot of questions. Sounding a little upset Sapphire says. Of course I do, that’s why we are here. Steel cuts in saying the house is full of clocks. Sapphire points that no of them work, and asks if they have ever worked. Yes Polly says, but they stopped, when. When want Steel asks her. Just before Davey disappeared. Again Sapphire almost explodes, saying that she thought she didn’t know when Davey dissappeaed. But Polly says he wasn’t in the kitchen when she got back from the bay.\n\nSapphire is shouting now, So you saw him disappear. Steel jumps in calling Sapphire out. No I didn’t see anything. Polly says, adding that she just felt strange. Strange asks Sapphire. Like I always do. Polly answers slowly. She then tells them that the place is haunted. Sapphire laughs at this. Really asks Steel, so you have seen a ghost. No but there are ghost Polly tells him. Davey’s seen them and then there was this one time there was all this blood all over the larder floor, says that Davey said that’s were she buried the body and on some nights you can hear the cries and screams of the babies. Steel asks Polly were is the larder, Polly points to a door in the corner of the kitchen.\n\nSapphire walks over, and opens the door. And uses her powers. Steel asks if she can feel anything. Nothing. Steel turns to Polly and say Well Polly pocket I reckon we have a captain’s cook at mates room.\n\nWe are now back with the old woman, she is talking about her husband again and how she wake up at sometimes and can swear that he’s there, clearing his boots by the doorway and she can even smell the polish, oh for goodness sake Richard it’s the middle of the night and come to bed. And then the baby starts crying what will the neighbours say, he on a early shift and she prone to migraines. There will be another little note on the front door mat. But then she wakes up properly. She’s got it all wrong of course. Richard never even saw the baby did he and the Pressons moved out years ago, after her stroke she couldn’t handle the staircase any more, they could have put in downstairs bathroom, but there was something wrong with the water, something to do with the pressure. Time is moving around again.\n\nSapphire asks Polly she told them she felt strange when the clocks stopped. Yes. Steel then asks if felt like it before. Yes again Polly tells them. Now Sapphire wants to know if her heard or see anything. Polly asks her own question were has he gone. And the fact the two of the arrived out of nowhere, without a car or boat. She wants to know something about them. Steel starts to say there is another place. But Sapphire mentally tell him that it won’t help she will not understand. But tells her, me will give it ago away. So he starts again. There another place, another dimension, the dimension of time. Its everywhere around us. Inside us. You can’t see it but it’s there. And can you go into it Polly asks. No you can’t, but sometimes can enter ours, break in. Take things and people. Like Davey you mean. Yes Steel says Like Davey. How Polly wants to know. Sometimes the fabric of time, the walls of the other dimension become weak and they can break. And that’s what’s happened here Polly asks. We reckon so Steel tell her, somewhere in this house, maybe his bedroom, time has broken in and taken him. Sapphire tells them both to come on, and they carry on up stairs.\n\nThe old woman is talking again, but unlike the last time it sounds more like a tape recording. It’s an American apparently taking over the electronics factory, were she works, on Tuesday and Thursdays. Putting things on to other things. Which she doesn’t know the name of.\n\nSapphire asks, Polly what the noise is. She tells her that is one of Davey CD’s. Steel tells Sapphire what a CD is. Why she asks Steel tells her is something to do. Steel stops the CD and shows her the shiny side. Steel starts looking though the collection Davey has. He pick out two, one being a music and the other better science fiction rubbish according to Polly. Sapphire ask if any of Steel is any of relevant. He says it might be, but he asks Polly what she thinks. But she doesn’t know. Steel asks her if Davey was listening to one when he disappeared. She tells him that she suspect so. Sapphire uses her powers and tells them both the CD player was made in 1996, in a factory not far from here. Manchester. Steel asks is there anything special about it, No. Steel says they should take a look at the clocks. Polly wants to know what they are going to do with them, they don’t work. Sapphire says they do work they have wound down. What all at the same time, it’s a bit of coincidence Polly answers. Steel asks if she was in the room before she went to see the sunset. Yes. And that was the last time you saw him. Yes again. So were was he Steel asks. Polly’s says it hard to remember. Sapphire almost shout at her asking the same question. He was sitting next to the window, on the floor. Sapphire tells Polly to show them how he was sitting. Please asks Steel. Polly sits down, and Sapphire asks her were was she, by the door I suppose she tells them. Sapphire shouts, you suppose. Again Steel calls Sapphire out for it. Yes I was by the door. Steel walks across the room and stand by it. Yes. Steel asks Sapphire if she’s ready. Steel wind-ups two of the clocks that’s in the room. And then asks Sapphire about the CD player, so she set it up, but nothing happens. Polly tells Sapphire she put it upside down. We then hear a odd sounding song. After a few seconds Steel asks if Sapphire felt something. Yes but it’s distant, but she then says it’s a fracture and she can feel them trying to come through, try to reach out to them. The clock suddenly stop again, then Polly hears and sees Davey moving around the room as the old Woman’s voice starts talking again talking about cleaning again. Steel calls to Sapphire telling her to fight them. But then everything stops.\n\nThere is the sound of something breaking Sapphire and Steel turn to Polly Steel asks her what did she do. Polly says smashed the clock. Sapphire is now very angry with her. And tells Polly off for messing with things she doesn’t understand, telling her to get out of the room and stay out. Now. Polly leaves\n\nThe old woman voice again, this time she talking about seeing some girl sitting on a wall as she left the factory, she nearly when over and said something but she did. And how strange it would be as the girl is the spitting image of young version of her mother, and the girl would think she was mad, maybe telling her to… The old woman says maybe the girl would use words like that because she has kind eyes and how people say that they are the windows to the soul.\n\nSteel turns to Sapphire. Well. Sapphire says that there thee of them. Steel says that they knew their names. Steel says that’s no good, and he suggests that they asks for help. But Sapphire doesn’t like the idea and tell him that they can handle it themselves. Steel asks if the CD player is the trigger, but doesn’t see how it can be, as she didn’t feel anything from it. Sapphire says that there must be something else. Steel asks in the room and then adds somewhere else in the house. Yes Sapphire says as we walks out of the room.\n\nPolly asks Steel if he’s from Australia, Steel at first doesn’t understand. Polly says he sounds foreign like his from Australia or something. No we’re he says but may have been there once. Polly then asks has he been to the other dimension, or has he see it. Yes he reckons maybe has it’s difficult to say. She then asks what’s it like. Steel starts to explain, but Sapphire jumps in and tells her that it’s unimaginable, immense, Infinite and dangerous. Because there are creatures that live at the very beginning of time and the very and these creatures have access to the other dimension, and are forever moving through it, searching for a way into this dimension. Sapphire says that must never be let in. Adding that there have stopped them for now but they will try again.\n\nPolly now wants to know about Davey. Steel tells her that his gone, but only for now. But Sapphire says probably for good.\n\nThe old woman says they were right about the shirt and the teeth, and the tie wasn’t to her taste because was very loud and very American he looked like a male model, however he had small mole on his cheek. It suited him but she adds that he should get seen to. Because the Australian broke the ozone layer, with all those barbecues. She talks the sounds of time start to echoing amd whispering. Then one single voice calls out Polly.\n\nPolly says he met him at work, the museum, in the village. Were they keep the things found in the bay, and there is waxworks. And one of things she does is stand still with other waxworks, when other people turn up and when they not look tap them on the shoulder. But it’s something Davey disapproves of, he disapproves of most things when they are at work, she says it like he’s a totally different person. Polly enjoys her work, but Davey say she not meant to and to take it seriously. A woman called Annie told her that Davey has a trouble soul, Annie is a woman who at first Polly didn’t like because of her ginger hair, and when she first started, she wasn’t sure if she was one of them, one of the staff or a member of the public. As they all looked the same to her.\n\nPolly say that first time they met, Annie screamed at her, and Polly didn’t want to work someone like that, Polly shouted back and Annie just laughed at her, because it was the first time Annie had someone apologise to her like that. Annie is fact a volunteer. Polly carries on taking\n\nSapphire is back from looking around the whole house. Steel mentally asks her if found anything. No, no sign of any time disturbs. Steel says it doesn’t make sense. Sapphire says it has to be something in the room. Suddenly Sapphire notics all the clocks are working again. And from somewhere in the house a voice calls out Polly Pocket. Sapphire tells her to stay.\n\nNow the old woman is talking, about a man called Barry Winston and how he can see from they records that she’s had cancer and calls her Mary. But her words are drowned out by time as gets louder. Steel tells Sapphire they are get stronger and she will have to do something. Then Polly calls out Davey who is suddenly in the hallway. Sapphire turns to Polly telling her off again, for not staying put. Davey says Hello asks her were has she been.\n\nEnd of Episode One\n\nEpisode Two\n\nWe are back, with Mary and she still talking about Barry Winston and he moved away from talking about her cancer to her depression, she thinks she should have had said that he would have be depressed if his husband dropped dead after 20 years of marriage and had child on the way. But she didn’t and just told him that she was fine now and hoped he would leave it at that. But he didn’t are least she doesn’t think he did. She was really paying attention to what he was saying and believed he said she should go to the council about it, as he friend on the council and how she had helped his ex-wife. She wasn’t cheap but if she mentioned his name she would give Mary a discount. But Mary tells him that may be the way things work in America but here in England we have moral standards to uphold. But he wasn’t too impressed with it. In fact he told her the the United States of the best councils in the world and their renowned for them. Mary says she never heard of any of them. Only Mr Clinton who she does like, and it at that.\n\nShe then when the canteen to find people talking. Someone called Shirley saying that they would all be replaced by American sooner rather than later. Mary tells her is talking a lot rubbish and she would be had pressed to find any American who would want to work in a electronics factory in the middle of Nuneaton. Another woman called Harriet came up to her and asks if she was alright, she told her of course she was alright. She was only been sacked, adding that Barry told her that were cutting down on part time workers, but Shirley has kept hers which was odd. Harriet then made her a cup of tea but left her soon after. Mary knows it not get anything to do with her being part time, but she believes that people think she abnormal for have only one breast, thanks to the cancer. And just as she leaving, to get her things she saw someone out the corner of her eye. It was you know who, sitting on her own at the other end of the room, staring right at her, not nasty just staring. But by the time Mary was ready to work over there to confront her she gone. Suddenly time starts to be hear.\n\nIt now the next day in the house and Steel is making toast. He asks Polly and Davey would they like some. Polly says no but Davey says yes. But then they complain to each other because they believed the other was snoring. There is sound of someone hammering. Steel stops the argument by putting down the toast in front of Davey. Polly asks want Sapphire is doing. Davey she hammering wood over his bedroom door, because she bonkers. But Steel says she doing her job. But mentally Steel asks why is she doing it. He tells him that she doesn’t really know but just feels right. Polly asks Steel why are they still here, because Davey is back and everything alright. But Davey says anything isn’t not alright and he doesn’t want to sleep in Polly’s room again, and Polly agrees to this too. Steel says that can’t let anyone sleep in Davey’s room until they have sorted everything out. So Polly says going to Annie’s house. Davey say she that hates Annie’s house, But Polly say no she doesn’t. So Davey then points that there are spiders everywhere and that you can write your name in the dust. Polly tells him to shut up. Davey then mocks Polly, Annie is Annie that. Polly keep talking saying that Annie has the gift of second sight, but strictly speaking it wasn’t her who has it there was this pig. Davey starts make pig sounds. Polly get upset and Steel tells him give her a fair go.\n\nSo Polly starts to tell, Steel about Annie and the pig. And now when Annie was a little girl she was woken up by this pig in her bedroom, she wasn’t frightened just wondered how it got in. As her mother was a very clean woman. Always dusting and Polly thinks that why Annie doesn’t bother now. So the pig starts talking to her, first about the weather and the how nice her room was. But Annie asks the pig does have something more important to talk about. Yes the pig did have something to say, but didn’t quite know how to put. Polly changes her voice a little to sound posh. He told her that she was going to dead of kidney infection. On 31st of August 1997 and her labrador was going to have twins. Then he vanished. Which was all very interesting because Annie didn’t even have a labrador at the time. But her father had got her one as surprise and it was still in quarantine.\n\nDavey say it’s the stupidest thing he’s ever heard his life. But Steel asks does she still see the pig. Yes Polly tells him. Davey says Steel shouldn’t believe her as she always making things up. Polly says no she’s not. Steel asks Polly to tell him more about it. Davey thinks Steel is as bad as her. Steel suddenly reaches over and almost breaks Davey’s arm. And says he wants to hear about the pig. He let’s go and Polly continues her story saying it comes a couple of times a week now. And always with a bit of interesting news, but recently it talks about the women on the Television, the one with the diet thing and funny hair. And the pig has told Annie the woman is going to die. Annie has become a little obsessed about her. Polly told Annie if carries on like this you’re not see her again.\n\nMary is now clearing the carpet, but it doesn’t seem to be going well, she has tried all kinds of things. And how all this work reminds her of working at the Grange, she has been thorough six bottles of domestos. All spotless, well all apart from this one place, she then complains of the cold and saying that she had the telephone call off because the radio waves and making it to warm and how every time it rang she took off her cardigan. However she solved the problem with the upstairs windows there was to much light coming in. So she used brown tape to cover them which took four rolls. It was very fortuitous because the foreign gentleman who runs a corner shop was having a sale, but it was the last day, and she may have do the same thing on the downstairs windows soon. Because as soon as autumn is here the bushes loses their body and the light starts get through the branches, she then thinks about using blankets, and what she would keep them in place, having given all of Richard tools away, to Help the Aged at the bring and buy sale but she didn’t buy anything, she doesn’t want things. Yet she could do with a hammer, she goes back scrubbing the floor for a few minutes. She then stops and asks the person she talking would they mind moving she could polish the chair they are sitting in\n\nShe then says she had been sitting there for three days now. Because Desert Island Discs was on when she arrived, but that was before Mary got rid of the wireless. It gave her quite a start when Mary frist saw her, and asked did she get in, because Mary had double locked the door like always. Mary say the she doesn’t say much but, she doesn’t either both fond of their company. Mary talks her guess telling her that she looks so much like her mother, they could be twins. She says that she would ask her mother about her wrinkles, her mother would tell her that would be plenty of time for them, when she gets older and when you get as old as she was she will hate them. Now Mary does hates her own.\n\nMary then says her daughter would be 25 on if she had lived, 25 round about your age she tell the she sitting on the chair. Then she says she knows were is a hammer.\n\nThere is sound of hammering again, Sapphire says there done. Now there is the sound of someone playing a piano Polly asks who playing it. Davey tells her is one of Annie’s pig. Polly tells him to shut up. But Steel whats to know were its. The front room Polly tells him, Steel tells them to stay here but Davey starts to walk out the house. Polly ask were is he going he say the Museum, and doesn’t care what Steel said, the song on the piano changes. As Steel walks into the room. Sapphire is now with him and asks who as it no one he tells her.\n\nThe piano stops playing and Ruby slowly appeareds. Sapphire is angry again and tells Steel off for calling for help. But he says he didn’t. Ruby is a little surprised first says how both of them have changed and the fact Sapphire is wearing a trouser suit. Sapphire says likes to rise to the occasion.\n\nPolly has followed Davey to the museum, but can’t find him, she say he’s going them into trouble. Then she comes across Annie, she singing to herself. But when she see Polly she tells her she was wondering when would show herself. Polly asks her why she here as it’s a Sunday. Annie says she still got to clean. Polly then asks if she seen Davey. No she hasn’t and carries on cleaning. Then Polly seems something new and asks Annie what it’s meant to be, she tells her it’s a waxwork. She knows that, but what of. Annie thinks it’s funny and starts laughing only to have be come a coughing fit. Polly tells her to sit down. Polly reads the little card by the waxwork Mary Jean Reynolds ne Glegg born December 12 1921, that’s the one Annie, but Polly says it doesn’t look anything like her and it looks horrible, this makes Annie laugh even more. And tells her that this the demon dungeon and they have to look a bit gruesome. But this different Polly says because she knew her and she was lovely and that thing makes her look like a murder. Annie says that the whole point. Polly is upset now that Annie is laughing at her, and she tells Annie she’s getting feed up with her and says she has a good mind never to visit her again in her smelly little house pointing out she will no one to talk to because she doesn’t have other friends, the pig doesn’t count and it sever her right.\n\nSapphire is still angry that Ruby is here, she tells Steel that they can manage on their own. Steel says he never said they didn’t, calling her a drongo. Which Ruby picks up on and then Sapphire calls her the old guard and out of touch about as useful as a ashtray on a motorbike. Steel says he knows all this. Sapphire keeps going on says does he really think any of them will be of any help when the transients launch their final attack during the war. And just look what happened to Sliver a mobius strip, plus what are meant to do if they chose to come through the fracture upstairs, maybe play them a song on the piano. Steel tell her to calm down, and tells her that this has bugger all with the war and the transients. But Sapphire tells him not to go there. Steel tells her it’s true. Sapphire thinks Steel believes that she jealous of Ruby. Steel tells her not be so rude and apologises on her behalf to Ruby\n\nBut Sapphire is still angry, and Steel says she always felt threatened by her, ever since. Sapphire doesn’t let him finish, by saying she bets he was grinning like a stuffed fox when he heard about silver. But Steel tells her that different but she doesn’t believe him. Steel tells Sapphire that she has crush on Sliver. Sapphire then says Steel has been flirting with both Ruby and this Pollyanna girl. Then Ruby asks were is she, both Sapphire and Steel stop shouting at each other. Ruby asks again were are the girl and the boy. Steel says he left them in the kitchen. But Ruby tells him they aren’t there now. Sapphire says it doesn’t matter. Ruby tells her you call her old gaurd if you like but yes it does matter.\n\nAnnie asks Polly want her job is but Polly says she isn’t talking to her. Annie asks her again what does really think her job is here. Polly wants to know what does it have to do with her. Annie wants to know how much they pay her. But again Polly doesn’t see what it has to do with her. Annie starts asking new questions like what is Polly first memories and did she have chicken poxs when she was a little girl, how old was she when she got here. Polly tells her to stop it. And then says she leaving her, leaving her here with the spiders and the waxwork that doesn’t look like her nice lady. Then Annie falls to the ground unconscious.\n\nSapphire is mad a Ruby, she can’t just turn up and tell them what to do. Ruby says she can, telling her to sit down and shut up. Sapphire does everything but telling Steel is what happens when you call for help. Ruby says no one sent for her she came because we wanted to. Sapphire tells to go away then. But Ruby says she here clean up the mess they were about to make. Ruby then asks Sapphire what have they found out so far. Sapphire doesn’t says anything. So she asks Steel who says not much really, it’s an old house and the fracture seems to be upstairs in the boys room and they thought the trigger was the CD player as it was playing when he disappeared. But Sapphire couldn’t sense anything anywhere in the house. Ruby then asks about the CD itself, not of them says anything. Ruby says she thought Sapphire of all people would have, but they can do that later once they have taken the wood planks off the bedroom door.\n\nRudy says that they told her that they didn’t notice anything strange about the house. No Steel says it mainly 18th century, a part from the east wing Ruby adds. Sapphire is upset that Ruby has had a look around. So nothing else unusual she asks. No Sapphire tells her. So what’s the date then. Sapphire quickly says the present. The exact date Ruby asks. Sapphire doesn’t answer. So Ruby asks Steel, the 13 March 2008. A Thursday asks Ruby as she walks across the room and the radio she switchs it on and voice says its Sunday 31st August here is the news Diana Princess of Wales has died. Ruby says it not the present is 1997\n\nAnnie is now awake again, she telling Polly that old pig was right. Polly wants to know what she talking about. Annie tells her the date which the same as the radio, and it’s her time. Polly tell her not to be silly, and she can get her some help she will fetch Mr Steel because he will know what to do. Annie says No. Polly then she says that she didn’t mean what she said and she was only being silly about the waxwork, Polly then says she didn’t know her full name until now but she had known her years, because she never talked to her. Not until the end anyway but that was when she was going funny so she didn’t understand. Annie is just about still breathing.\n\nPolly doesn’t get why is she here because she couldn’t murder anyone, she was just a lonely old lady. Polly tells Annie to shh and say she looks so peaceful at the end. And she saw her take the pills 32 of them. Counted them and washed them all down with a cup of tea. And then as she got sleepy she started talking to herself even singing saying she was going to met her baby,. Which odd because Polly don’t know she had one. Bonkers at the end Polly says and that she sat with her for ages holding her hand but when the man with the clipboard arrive, he told her that she must have been there for at least a week and was surprised that nobody missed her. The other man said that was the way of world now and she probably didn’t have any friends. Polly says wanted to she was her friend, but nobody was taking much notice of her, so she just left them. Poor old lady.\n\nAnnie then says before she goes there is something she has to tell her.\n\nSapphire isn’t happy with what Ruby is implying. But Ruby says not implying anything. It statement that they completely overlooked the fact that this house or are the entire Village have been shifted back in time by 20 years, so it’s perfectly possible over looked something else. Like what Steel asks, Sapphire tells Steel off for encouraging her. Maybe a trigger Ruby says. The CD. Or something else. Steel says she knows something and she not telling them. Sapphire says do enlighten us oh wise one. OK Ruby says in fact she will show them.\n\nAnnie says that there something that she been meaning to tell Polly for a long time, Polly says if it to do the with pig or the woman off the telly she doesn’t care. Annie says it’s nothing to do with Diana. It has to do with her. She is a very special little girl.\n\nRuby has taken them both out to village graveyard. And she show them a grave stone. Steel reads it David Harry Hawkhurst, dead the 4th April 1908. Davey. Yes Ruby says he dead 100 years ago. He a ghost Sapphire says.\n\nEnd of Episode Two\n\nEpisode Three\n\nMary is talking again saying she forgot, and how you wouldn’t forget something like that, first she put a little Teddy bear in because she was afraid of the dark, only she’d forgotten doing it. She now thinks others will be poking their noses in and everything will come out and they will be taking her off to the funny farm. Because they won’t understand why she did it. Why she had to do it. She then talks about how the bady was such a pretty little girl with eyes as blue as the sea. And if Richard could have seen her, but that was the point she seen him die and lose his dignity and when the cancer came for her she couldn’t let her see all that. Leaving her on her own with her.\n\nBack with Sapphire, Steel and Ruby. Who tells them that Davey could quite possibly be their trigger. Steel asks if triggers can be people. Ruby calls him Green, just like him was when she first met him. And they was quite charming about the cynical older version of him. But she tells him yes people can be triggers and so can emotions, in fact virtually anything. Sapphire says that they need to Davey send him or kill him again. Ruby tells her that it might not be that simple because he may not be the only one. Steel asks if there are more ghost. Ruby says it quite possible and points out that’s odd that they didn’t notice that two young people were alone in huge house with no parents. But then correct herself says they wouldn’t because they fresh out the box. Both Sapphire and Steel want to why this is odd.\n\nRuby then asks now old do you think the two people are. Sapphire doesn’t see what different does it make. Yes it does Ruby and its going to be one hell of learning curve. Which does in press Sapphire, who tells Ruby to get to her point and says it like it. So Ruby tells them had they thought Pollyanna was a ghost to.\n\nWe then hear, Mary as recoding. She says about leaving her baby in the dark. As time begins to echo around, slowly were hear the older Steel call for the older Sapphire and gets a very faint answer from the older Sapphire. Ruby hears all this and out loud tries to answered then both, but the young Steel answers, then asks does she know another Steel. To which she no she doesn’t, they are long gone and old school. They are back in the house looking through the old newspaper and other things, Sapphire says it tedious. Ruby tells her not to so hard on her, everyone Has bad days and if the whole village has slipped back 20 years, then would very hard to see the wood for the trees. Sapphire doesn’t understand way they are looking though of this stuff saying why don’t they just kill the boy and get out of here. Ruby is a little surprised at this attitude and tells of the killing a ghost interesting concept. Steel suddenly finds something, in the newspaper. A report at a baby being kidnapped from a pram, from 1st of October 1955. But Sapphire doesn’t see the link until he show her the name of the place Little Hellingly, the village that are in. The name of the baby Pollyanna Clegg. She worked her as cleaner. Who did Sapphire asks. Her mother Mary Clegg her husband dead the year before. But Sa. Sapphire says she still doesn’t understand how it relevant, it doesn’t prove anything. The girl gets kidnapped from a pram, grows up somewhere else. Comes back to find her mother. Ruby adds who die in 1980.\n\nSteel wants to know how Ruby knew that, Ruby show them another newspaper. So what Sapphire says, but is stopped by saying anything else as the door opens and Polly walks in.\n\nBack with Mary who now saying the she pretended that she been kidnapped from one side of the supermarket, and how the newspaper wanted to take photos of the pram and people would stop her in the street, giving her money and flowers. With one woman hugger her. It came to were she started to believe it herself. Yet she was still there underfloor boards. Then how it was all for the best, but it really wasn’t, because she had the operation, and the doctor gave her the news that they have had the tests back and they were all negative. The thing was that no one ever told her she would get better, it wasn’t ment to be like this. So she beings to clean the house. Saying one day she will get it clean. As she talks her voice becomes more like a recording and we hear time and echos.\n\nSteel asks Polly were has she been, and they have been worried about her. She tells them that she went to the museum, she didn’t see Davey but Annie. Steel asks how is she. Polly tells him that she die, Ruby mentally asks sapphire how old Polly is but she can’t tell, Sapphire then says she’s not there and Polly isn’t real. Polly says that Annie told her she was special because.. But it was silly and she should really stop listening to the pig, as there are no such things a ghost and nobody walks around after they are dead, it’s impossible and she would if she was dead. Steel asks so Annie told you were dead. Polly the says that Annie told her she wasn’t a ghost but wish fulfillment, and asks her what does she mean. Annie told her to look at the waxwork. Steel asks what waxwork. The lady in the museum Polly tells him. And when Annie dead she read the thing next to the lady, and it said she killed her little baby with a hammer, hiding it under the floor then the seeing the baby’s name was Polly. Now Polly is angry and says she right no body walks around when they are dead, because Annie dead and she not walking around. In fact not of the other dead are, it just her and Davey walking around forever, just get older and more miserable but ever going away. She breaks down.\n\nSuddenly Davey appears and says she’s lying calling her stupid girl they aren’t ghosts . Steel wants to know were he came from. Ruby, says no they aren’t really ghosts. Sapphire wants to know what are they. Steel says they are wish fulfillments, like Annie said. Ruby adds perhaps. But Davey says it just one of Polly’s stupid stories. Polly tells him to shut up and he doesn’t anything about it. But Davey says he not a ghost. Ruby then asks him how old is he. But he doesn’t answer actually he wants to know who she is and he’s not going to answer her questions. Sapphire then tell Ruby that he the same as Polly. Sapphire uses her powers on him Ruby asks again, and this time says no he doesn’t. Polly says he does and it the 4th April. He tells her to shut up again. Steel mentally tell Sapphire and Ruby that he dead on his birthday. Which Sapphire then says out loud. And it say so outside on grave. Davey says at least he got one and was stuck under the floor board with his head bash in. Steel then asks him so he knows he has a grave, Yes he knows. But Steel says he thought he was a ghost. I not a ghost because I still born, still bron babies don’t have ghosts. And does he look like a baby.\n\nNow we have a new recording with a male voice, saying that there are sometimes three are shadows just out of sight, shadows that whisper in the night and words he doesn’t understand. But he knows what they are, they were taught about purgatory, the Abbott taught us. Haunted and tormented by all the bad things. Now a new female voice talking about her father being shot. The male is back says he thought when you’re dead you’re dead and never knew it was meant to be like this. Time is echoing around them.\n\nRuby now wants to try an experiment, and they can call it a game if they like. Davey says he hates games, but Polly says doesn’t mind she tells him to go a listen to his CD. But Davey says can’t because she Sapphire board up his room. Ruby shows them a music box. She tells them that she found it a cupboard. But mentally Steel says it looks familiar. Yes it does she answers. Ruby then gets Polly to open it. Ruby asks Sapphire if she can feel anything, not at first but then she feels what she calls a shadow. As the music, Polly calls out Mary Jean Reynolds ne Glegg name and we hear her ask someone to move out of the way so she can polish the chair. Polly says she talking to and how she’s trying to talk back to her, but Mary can’t hear her, and asks Mary asks how she got in Polly tells them that she already inside. And don’t always use doors. Polly is now answering the questions Mary asked before. And then about how Mary said she looked like her mother. Steel then says he recognises the voice, and so does Sapphire. But can’t place it. Then the music ends and the link between Polly and Mary is broken\n\nBut now Ruby and Polly are now witness, to Mary giving birth to her. And then Mary counting out the pills. Polly is crying and asks Ruby to stop it. Polly even calls to her past self. Polly starts calling Mary, mummy. Mary says she going to see her little baby now and now everything will be alright now.\n\nRuby and Polly finds themself back with Sapphire, Steel and Davey. Sapphire tells her that they remember were they hear before. Steel says it was on the CD. Sapphire adds it was playing when Davey disappeared, he says he didn’t. He when for a ride on flying saucer. Polly says talking rubbish. But Ruby says maybe or maybe not, Ruby asks him want he was listening to. Sapphire and Steel say it play with the women. But no he say he using his CD Walkman and the Tomorrow People. Why was he playing two CD he wasn’t the other one plays by itself. He then starts to act out the Tomorrow People messing with Polly and they laugh with each other leaving the room.\n\nSo the CD was the trigger says Steel. But Ruby says it far more interesting than that, and asks him if he’s realised what’s going on. You of all people. Sapphire tells her she wishes that she would stop saying that. Ruby then say that history is repeating itself, so to speak. Then says they know Mary killed her daughter, according to waxwork Museum she did Sapphire says. Ruby says she and Polly saw it happened. So someone wrote about and put it on CD asks Steel. No something far more dangerous than that. And asks them both don’t they remember that in their previous farms they were trapped on CD within a fiction, a creature creatived fissure between a fiction and reality. Then Sapphire adds did they cross that fissure. Yes. So the same thing happened again. Not not quite, the drama on the CD is the thing that has crossed over and become reality. Mary, Polly, Davey, Annie, the village and the house all of it. You mean not of this real asks Sapphire.\n\nEnd of Episode Three\n\nEpisode Four\n\nWe then hear a disjointed and distorted, version of the theme. And them lines from the The Tomorrow People CD. As time echos around the place. Steel ask were did Polly and Davey go, Ruby says it doesn’t really matter now that they know they not real. Steel as if we’re they ever real. And has anything like that existed before a wish fulfillment. Ruby is not sure may be in a fantasy play or a dream. Sapphire points out that there very existence was defined by a dream. Ruby says very good maybe this version of her may turn out to all right eventually. If a little unconventional. Then Steel asks if they are real, and not just something off a CD. Ruby answers by saying who can tell. Steel doesn’t like the sound of that. And Sapphire tells him that he’s real enough. Even this he doesn’t like.\n\nThey have made there way to Davey’s bedroom, and Ruby isn’t in pressed, because when Sapphire nail the planks to the door she created a barrier between them and the Fisher this almost in penetrable. Ruby explains that they are standing on the edge of the Fisher so anything is possible. Steel tells then to shh as he can hear something, Sapphire thinks it’s the CD player. Suddenly Ruby tells them she a unique relationship with music and she walks towards the barrier and vanishs.\n\nWe then hear echoing from the other audios. And Ruby calls to Steel, she tells him that she going to try and close the fisher. Sapphire wants to know now, Ruby says by improvising. Then the asks herself what would Steel do. Steel says he would smash or burn the CD player. But she tells him that she doesn’t mean him. He says sorry, but there again she says you could be right she then creates music out of the air, things begin to break down. Down stairs Polly and Davey can feel the house shake, Polly what’s to know what happening, Davey says they are trying to close the fisher. Polly plays dumb saying she doesn’t understand. But Davey’s calls her out as he changes, adding this time there is no more playing games. Polly says she likes playing games and being Pollyanna. Davey says that will time for that later.\n\nRuby stops trying, as we hear the a new voice says quietly. This a visualisation technique. Then suddenly we hear Steel the older one calling out to Sapphire, Ruby asks the younger Steel did he says something. No. Then we hear older Sapphire call back to older Steel. The young Sapphire can’t hear anything. Then older Steel calls out to Ruby.\n\nOutside the room, Steel says that he wished he knew what was going on. Sapphire says Ruby will tell them if there any developments. They now can hear someone whistling God Save the Queen.\n\nInside the room, Ruby asks Steel if it really him. Yes of course it’s. She wants to know were he is. He tells her that he trapped on this CD, but then Sapphire corrects him by saying not just this CD all the ones in the cabinet. Ruby is genuinely surprised by this. Sapphire says they have been working they way through the collection trying to find some suitable music. So it was them playing with the CD player just to reach her asks Ruby. Sapphire adds that it was hard and not get caught up in the talking books and plays. Steel says they don’t have much time until the end of the track and asks Ruby wants she doing. She tells him that trying to closes the Fisher in the hope that fictional characters would be drawn back, in the CD player and this all end. But Sapphire says she can’t do that, because it will trap them forever. Ruby asks was she wrong. Not really Sapphire tells her, because they created the Fisher in the first place, they way out but transients got there first. Steel says the drew a real person in and made a her life into a radio play finding gaps in it, they could fill with the real world.\n\nThe wish fulfillments, Ruby says. But Steel don’t understand. Ruby explains the bady she killed, the still born baby and the Museum cleaner with second sight. Very typical transient folder. And the house is suck in 1987, and it wasn’t only Saturday who couldn’t see the wood for the trees. Older Sapphire doesn’t understand. But Ruby adds something has changed.\n\nYoung Sapphire and Steel have now started to walk towards the sound of the whistling. Steel tells Sapphire asks does realise this could be a trap drawing them away from Ruby. The whistling stops and Sapphire suddenly agrees with him. They now hear a little girl. This a choo choo train, puffing down the track, now it going forward, now its going back. But even after work this out there still press on. And walk into a new room and see that is now snowing.\n\nRuby picks up on this and tells Steel and Sapphire, Steel asks why it important. Its August. Ruby tells him. Steel then says she needs to wideing the Fisher just long enough for them to slip out. They is silence, Sapphire asks Ruby if she still there. Yes and that is Sapphire Ruby asks unsure if it really is them, says thetransients can take on an any form and there is always the possibility wideing it she could. But Steel tells her just to get on with it. And she answers by saying certainly sounds like Steel, the old Steel without the jeans. What he asks. Never mind she tells him.\n\nYoung Sapphire says its December in the room, no November, we now hear the radio. Crowd as big a victory night throned Piccadilly as the time arrived to throw off the last traces of the war time. Steel says 1949, we hear the rest of the news report word for word the same one Steel hear when was trapped in the retirement home.\n\nRuby says she needs to get it just right, otherwise she could shattered the Fisher completely, she uses her powers, and the older Steel says she doing well. But some thing begins to break, the CD is throw across the room. Ruby calls to Steel but the young one answers. We then hear older Sapphire saying the poem ring a ring a roses. Young Steel as who it’s Sapphire tells him that it he, not now but then. In 1892, they are travelling back in time.\n\nRuby then starts looking through the collection of CD’s and she knows the Transits taking the village back in time, trying to get them out of the way. She then find a rock concert music CD, but it doesn’t play. She has to find Davey’s CD Walkman, so she tries again. She calls to the older Sapphire and Steel but once again, the young Sapphire answers, then a new male voice says they are trapped, forever, trapped in the disc. Trapped in the fiction and even if she did reach them, they wouldn’t be able to distinguish you from the story they are living though, over and over again. Then there a female voice joining in.\n\nRuby calls to the young Sapphire and tells her to anchor her. And disappears into the Fisher. The young Steel asks were are now. 1412 Sapphire tells him but that doesn’t matter now. And calls to Ruby asking her if she’s alright. Yes she thinks so, but it feels like she be here for about 8 months. Sapphire asks were is here, she not sure then she says you took your time Steel. There the sound of a horse and carriage, the is set of guards after the young Steel and Sapphire\n\nRuby tells Steel she needs to know what can he see and to think outside the box. The older Steel says he can hear her and so can Sapphire. But the song is coming to an end. Ruby tells them it needs to be now. So using her powers Sapphire pulls them all back into the bedroom. Steel says thank you and smashes the remaining CD’s. Ruby tells him not bad for a old coot. Sapphire doesn’t understand. Ruby says a private joke, then Steel smashes the CD player to, just as the young Steel enters the room. The older Steel asks who he is a the younger Sapphire see her older self\n\nThe clocks are now once again working, Steel says that they have to go, they have to delete them, and she knows the rules. But Ruby asks is he feeling threatened by a younger version. But he says don’t be absurd. She points out that it’s interesting dilemma, and deleting them would be killing a part of themselves. Steel says it’s a dilemma at all, they shouldn’t exist. But they do she tells him. The older Sapphire, her younger self and young Steel are in another part of the house. He says he forgot how much a spuck she was and what a no hoper he was so up himself. But the older Sapphire wasn’t that bad, aren’t that bad. So he suggests they do a swap. The young Sapphire says he will kill him. The older Sapphire say they have extremely peculiar vernacular. Oh don’t we just the young Sapphire says. It clear that the older Sapphire is little bit soft on the young Steel\n\nRuby tells the older Steel that he has to admit his younger self is other attractive although his manners leave a lot to be desired. Mind you the young Sapphire is little bit of a tyrant. But still Steel says its completely relevant what they look like or behave like, they are Sapphire and Steel is a simple as that and they shouldn’t exist. The young Sapphire and Steel are now kissing each other, Sapphire asks Steel does he remember what’s that like adding that they know wants going to happen to them. Ruby say they all know what going to happen. Sapphire says they wanted to make the most of the moment, how interesting in for them to embraced, their … There what Steel asks their humanity, their experiences says Sapphire. But Steel say they aren’t human… and never will be Ruby finish, then asks it’s time. Yes Sapphire tells her\n\nWe are with the young Sapphire and Steel. He asks her she’s all right. She tells him that she’s just thinking about them both and wondering what it would be like to be together.\n\nIt over Ruby tells Sapphire, yes she tells her she felt it. Ruby say he stickler for the rules. Yes I know, Sapphire says. But then Ruby sees Steel with something. And says maybe his not. He his the Walkman there was disc left in it. He says it a keepsake. Both Ruby and Sapphire extremely surprised it, he says he though he better hold on to it. Steel walks out of the house. Sapphire uses her powers and finds out that Steel has broken the rules, he calls to Sapphire and she follows.\n\nMy Review\n\nWell, for everyone that called the Big Finish audios just cheap a reboot, or reimagining this audio assignment really is it and you’re hate it. Because the whole length story your going to sit there and nit pick, ‘Sapphire and Steel wouldn’t do this or that’ and then you see the joins in the story, because some of my direct lifts from other places and you will know them word for word.\n\nBut if me, having sat through both the television and audio assignments, I have come to the conclusion that they are the same thing. And this one was written just so it was clear, that Big Finish do not do cheap reboots.\n\nHere we have two new unknown actors stepping in the roles of Sapphire and Steel. With a brand new attitude and style, plus a bit of role reversal, Steel taking a back sit and Sapphire being the heavy. We even get a new introduction, that’s why wrote it down twice.\n\nAt the beginning it did feel like it was going to be a retelling of the first assignment, but it’s more like echos of things than went before. Both from the television series and the audios. And of course there has to a bridge between the old and the new in the form of Ruby, I believe it was done not only because of the the nature of the story, but also unfortunately, Mr Val Pringle had passed away some nine years before production was even just an idea, and I would like to imagine that if he had been around would have him reprise his role as Lead just because.\n\nNigel Fairs, does a excellent job of just twisting things it just a little bit. So that Blair McDonough and Anna Skellern get to play and a stretch out their roles. Which is a lot of fun, but having said that Polly and Davey feel bit wasted, and so does Annie all the stuff about the talking pig. I get that Mary was a real person trapped in the fiction. Yet what I don’t understand is that if killed herself shouldn’t have all ended. Yes Sapphire and Steel open the Fisher to escape but trans dimensional being took it over. Bringing Mary’s life on the CD’s and adding bits so it can feed off the potential of the new and unexpected events. And what was the point in Mary telling Polly, all that information when she could have just read it, then slowly work it out herself. Which I think would have been more useful.\n\nSo when the question about, could Sapphire and Steel come back to television is kicked about and people say you can’t do because it would never work. Well this assignment is proof that can work. But the real question is should it\n\nNext week, we are back with the original Sapphire and Steel (David Warner and Susannah Harker) as they take trip to the seaside, in John Dorney’s Remember Me. One of only three of the audio assignments I have very vague memory of because of the fact the late comic actor Sam Kelly, its in (he’s Allo Allo co-stars Kim Hartman and Arthur Bostrom having appeared in Sapphire and Steel before)"
