        "text": "Crystallization of dienelactone hydrolase in two space groups: structural changes caused by crystal packing\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPorter, Joanne L.; Carr, Paul D.; Collyer, Charles A.; Ollis, David L.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nDienelactone hydrolase (DLH) is a monomeric protein with a simple Î±/Î²-hydrolase fold structure. It readily crystallizes in space group P212121 from either a phosphate or ammonium sulfate precipitation buffer. Here, the structure of DLH at 1.85â Ã resolution crystallized in space group C2 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit is reported. When crystallized in space group P212121 DLH has either phosphates or sulfates bound to the protein in crucial locations, one of which is located in the active site, preventing substrate/inhibitor binding. Another is located on the surface of the enzyme coordinated by side chains from two different molecules. Crystallization in space group C2 from a sodium citrate buffer results in new crystallographic proteinâprotein interfaces. The protein backbone is highly similar, but new crystal contacts cause changes in side-chain orientations and in loop positioning. In regions not involved in crystal contacts, there is little change in backbone or side-chain configuration. The flexibility of surface loops and the adaptability of side chains are important factors enabling DLH to adapt and form different crystal lattices.

In recent years, a better understanding of the molecular basis for this process has emerged, which is in large part due to a steep increase in structural information. Yet, the conformational transitions underlying the transport mechanism are still not fully understood, and additional data is therefore needed. Here we report in detail the detergent screening, crystallization, experimental MIRAS phasing, and refinement of the peptide transporter PepTSt from Streptococcus thermophilus. The space group is P3121, and the protein is crystallized in a monomeric inward facing form. The binding site is likely to be somewhat occluded, as the lobe encompassing transmembrane helices 10 and 11 is markedly bent towards the central pore of the protein, but the extent of this potential occlusion could not be determined due to disorder at the apex of the lobe. Based on structural comparisons with the seven previously determined P212121 and C2221 structures of inward facing PepTSt, the structural flexibility as well as the conformational changes mediating transition between the inward open and inward facing occluded states are discussed. In conclusion, this report improves our understanding of the structure and conformational cycle of PepTSt, and can furthermore serve as a case study, which may aid in supporting future structure determinations of additional MFS transporters or other integral membrane proteins.

V.; Shipilova, A. S.; Gusarova, E. V.; Knyazeva, S. S.; Stepanova, O. V.; Chuprunov, E. V.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe crystal structures of methylprednisolone aceponate were determined by X-ray diffraction analysis at temperatures 90 K and 150 K: space group P212121, a = 14.8592(2), b = 19.6844(5), c = 26.1626(4) Ã , Z = 12; R = 0.0598 (T = 90 K); space group P212121, a = 6.57348(14), b = 14.8295(3), c = 26.2214(5) Ã , Z = 4; R = 0.0518 (T = 150 K). Features of structural changes in the phase transition were revealed. The abrupt change in the unit cell parameters in the phase transition was shown by low-temperature X-ray powder. The methods of degree of invariance of crystal electron density and molecular Voronoi-Dirichlet polyhedra were used for the analysis of polymorphism in methylprednisolone aceponate. The atomic structure at 90 K have a translational pseudosymmetry of electron density Î· = 0.329(1). The decrease of number of intermolecular contacts in the high-temperature modification due to rupture of intermolecular non-valence contacts C/O was observed.\n\nLow orthopyroxene from a lunar deep crustal rock - A new pyroxene polymorph of space group P21ca\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSmyth, J. R.\n\n1974-01-01\n\nBronzite crystals (En86Fs11Wo3) from a slowly-cooled lunar troctolitic granulite, have space group P21ca, a postulated, but previously unreported space group. Diffractions violating the b-glide extinction conditions have been observed in long-exposure X-ray precession photographs from three of these crystals and on an automated X-ray diffractometer. P21ca is a subgroup of the common orthopyroxene space group Pbca, and its cell dimensions (a = 18.235 plus or minus 0.004 A, b = 8.831 plus or minus 0.002 A, c = 5.189 plus or minus 0.001 A) are similar to those of terrestrial bronzites. It is postulated that the lower symmetry space group has developed as a result of very slow cooling at pressures of one to two kilobars deep in the lunar crust.\n\nCrystal structures and theoretical studies of polyphosphate LiZnP3O9 for nonlinear optical applications\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXie, Zhiqing; Su, Xin; Ding, Hanqin; Li, Hongyi\n\n2018-06-01\n\nNonlinear optical materials have attracted worldwide attention owing to their wide range of applications, specially in the laser field. Phosphates with noncentrosymmetric structures are potential candidates for novel ultraviolet (UV)-NLO materials, because they usually display short UV cut-off edges. In this work, a polyphosphate, the LiZnP3O9 polyphosphate crystals were grown through spontaneous crystallization from high-temperature melts. It crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell parameters a = 8.330(3) Ã , b = 8.520(3) Ã , c = 8.635(3) Ã , and Z = 4. In the structure, all the P atoms are coordinated by four oxygen atoms forming the [PO4] tetrahedra and further connected to generate a zig-zag [PO3]â anionic framework. Thermal analysis, IR spectroscopy, UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum and powder second harmonic generation measurements are performed. In addition, the first-principles calculation was employed for better understanding the structure-property relationships of LiZnP3O9.\n\nCloning, expression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray studies of argininosuccinate lyase (Rv1659) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPaul, A.; Mishra, A.; Surolia, A.; Vijayan, M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe last enzyme in the arginine-biosynthesis pathway, argininosuccinate lyase, from Mycobacterium tuberculosis has been cloned, expressed, purified and crystallized, and preliminary X-ray studies have been carried out on the crystals. The His-tagged tetrameric enzyme with a subunit molecular weight of 50.9â kDa crystallized with two tetramers in the asymmetric unit of the orthorhombic unit cell, space group P212121. Molecular-replacement calculations and self-rotation calculations confirmed the space group and the tetrameric nature of the molecule.

The grown crystals were subjected to powder X-ray diffraction analysis, (PXRD) and it was found that the title compound was crystallized in the orthorhombic crystal system with noncentrosymmetric space group of P212121. The vibrational frequencies of various functional groups present in the crystal were analyzed using the FTIR spectrum with a wavenumber range between 450 cm-1 and 4000 cm-1. The microhardness analysis of the sample revealed that the crystal belongs to the soft material category. Piezoelectric analysis was performed to measure the value of the piezoelectric (d33) coefficient. Blue light emission of the material was confirmed using the photoluminescence spectrum. Thermal stability of the grown crystal was analyzed using a melting point apparatus and it was found that the LLPNP is stable upto 175âC. Etching analysis was performed at various durations, in order to identify the surface properties of the LLPNP crystal.\n\nPseudo-merohedral twinning and noncrystallographic symmetry in orthorhombic crystals of SIVmac239 Nef core domain bound to different-length TCRÎ¶ fragments\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKim, Walter M.; Sigalov, Alexander B.; Stern, Lawrence J.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nHIV/SIV Nef mediates many cellular processes through interactions with various cytoplasmic and membrane-associated host proteins, including the signalling Î¶ subunit of the T-Â­cell receptor (TCRÎ¶). Here, the crystallization strategy, methods and refinement procedures used to solve the structures of theÂ core domain of the SIVmac239 isolate of Nef (Nefcore) inÂ complex with two different TCRÎ¶ fragments are described. The structure of SIVmac239 Nefcore bound to the longer TCRÎ¶ polypeptide (Leu51âAsp93) was determined to 3.7â Ã resolution (R work = 28.7%) in the tetragonal space group P43212. The structure of SIVmac239 Nefcore in complex with the shorter TCRÎ¶ polypeptide (Ala63âArg80) was determined to 2.05â Ã resolution (R workÂ =Â 17.0%), but only after the detection of nearly perfect pseudo-merohedral crystal twinning and proper assignment ofÂ the orthorhombic space group P212121. The reduction in crystal space-group symmetry induced by the truncated TCRÎ¶ polypeptide appears to be caused by the rearrangement of crystal-contact hydrogen-bonding networks and the substitution of crystallographic symmetry operations by similar noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operations. The combination of NCS rotations that were nearly parallel to the twin operation (k,Â h,Â âl) and a and b unit-cell parameters that were nearly identical predisposed the P212121 crystal form to pseudo-merohedral twinning.

We extend the static crystal to the dynamic \"space-time\" crystal characterized by the general intertwined space-time periodicities in D +1 dimensions, which include both the static crystal and the Floquet crystal as special cases. A new group structure dubbed a \"space-time\" group is constructed to describe the discrete symmetries of a space-time crystal. Compared to space and magnetic groups, the space-time group is augmented by \"time-screw\" rotations and \"time-glide\" reflections involving fractional translations along the time direction. A complete classification of the 13 space-time groups in one-plus-one dimensions (1 +1 D ) is performed. The Kramers-type degeneracy can arise from the glide time-reversal symmetry without the half-integer spinor structure, which constrains the winding number patterns of spectral dispersions. In 2 +1 D , nonsymmorphic space-time symmetries enforce spectral degeneracies, leading to protected Floquet semimetal states. We provide a general framework for further studying topological properties of the (D +1 )-dimensional space-time crystal.\n\nSpace-Time Crystal and Space-Time Group.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Shenglong; Wu, Congjun\n\n2018-03-02\n\nCrystal structures and the Bloch theorem play a fundamental role in condensed matter physics.

The first crystal form was obtained by crystallization of BHA at room temperature in the presence of acarbose and maltose; data were collected at cryogenic temperature to a resolution of 1.9â Ã . It was found that the crystal belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters aÂ =Â 47.0, b = 73.5, c = 151.1â Ã . A maltose molecule was observed and found to bind to BHA and previous reports of the binding of a nonasaccharide were confirmed. The second crystal form was obtained by pH-induced crystallization of BHA in a MESâHEPESâboric acid buffer (MHB buffer) at 303â K; the solubility of BHA in MHB has a retrograde temperature dependency and crystallization of BHA was only possible by raising the temperature to at least 298â K. Data were collected at cryogenic temperature to a resolution of 2.0â Ã . The crystal belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 38.6, b = 59.0, c = 209.8â Ã . The structure was solved using molecular replacement. The maltose-binding site is described and the two structures are compared. No significant changes were seen in the structure upon binding of the substrates.

Lowering the temperature doubles the b-axis repeat and changes the space group from P2(1)2(1)2(1) to P112(1) with gamma now 99.37 degrees. The structure is twinned, the twin rule corresponding to a 2(1) screw rotation parallel to a. The phase transition is associated with a sequential displacement parallel to a of zigzag bi-layers of ribbons perpendicular to b*. No similar phase transition was observed for form (I) and this was attributed to the different packing symmetries of the two room-temperature polymorphic forms.\n\nJohnson Space Center's Risk and Reliability Analysis Group 2008 Annual Report\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nValentine, Mark; Boyer, Roger; Cross, Bob; Hamlin, Teri; Roelant, Henk; Stewart, Mike; Bigler, Mark; Winter, Scott; Reistle, Bruce; Heydorn,Dick\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe Johnson Space Center (JSC) Safety & Mission Assurance (S&MA) Directorate s Risk and Reliability Analysis Group provides both mathematical and engineering analysis expertise in the areas of Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA), Reliability and Maintainability (R&M) analysis, and data collection and analysis.

The N-terminal domain of Epf was crystallized in space groups P2(1) and P2(1)2(1)2(1) in the presence of the protease chymotrypsin. Mass spectrometry showed that the species crystallized corresponded to a fragment comprising residues 52-357 of Epf. Complete data sets were collected to 2.0 and 1.6â Ã resolution, respectively, at the Australian Synchrotron.\n\nPurification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic analysis of the adhesion domain of Epf from Streptococcus pyogenes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLinke, Christian; Siemens, Nikolai; Middleditch, Martin J.; Kreikemeyer, Bernd; Baker, Edward N.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe extracellular protein Epf from Streptococcus pyogenes is important for streptococcal adhesion to human epithelial cells.

An ATP-binding domain of human Hsp70 protein has been crystallized in two major morphological forms at pH 7.0 in the presence of PEG 8000 and CaCl2. Both crystal forms belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121, but show no resemblance in unit-cell parameters. Analysis of the crystal structures for both forms shows a 1-2 A shift of one of the subdomains of the protein. This conformational change could reflect a 'natural' flexibility of the protein which might be relevant to ATP binding and may facilitate the interaction of other proteins with Hsp70 protein.\n\nA comparative study on the crystal structure of bicycle analogues to the natural phytotoxin helminthosporins\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBarbosa, Luiz ClÃ¡udio de Almeida; Teixeira, Robson Ricardo; Nogueira, Leonardo BrandÃ£o; Maltha, Celia Regina Alvares; Doriguetto, AntÃ´nio Carlos; Martins, Felipe Terra\n\n2016-02-01\n\nHerein we described structural insights of a series of analogues to helminthosporin phytotoxins. The key reaction used to prepare the compounds corresponded to the [3 + 4] cycloaddition between the oxyallyl cation generated from 2,4-dibromopentan-3-one and different furans. Their structures were confirmed upon IR, NMR and X-ray diffraction analyses. While bicycles 7, 8 and 9 crystallize in the centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P21/c, compound 10 was solved in the noncentrosymmetric orthorhombic space group P212121. The solid materials obtained were shown to be racemic crystals (7, 8, 9) or racemic conglomerate (10). In all compounds, there is formation of a bicycle featured by fused tetrahydropyranone and 2,5-dihydrofuran rings. They adopt chair and envelope conformations, respectively. Crystal packing of all compounds is stabilized through C-Hâ¢â¢â¢O contacts. Conformational aspects as well as similarities and differences among the crystal structures of the synthesized analogues are discussed.\n\nPreliminary crystallographic examination of a novel fungal lysozyme from Chalaropsis\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nCarter, Daniel C.; He, Xiao-Min; Lyne, James E.; Stubbs, Gerald; Hash, John H.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe lysozyme from the fungus of the Chalaropsis species has been crystallized.

Both of the compounds which are Schiff base derivatives are isomer of each other. While the compound (I) crystallizes in centrosymmetric monoclinic space group P 21/c, the compound (II) crystallizes in orthorhombic space group P 212121. The theoretical parameters of the molecules have been calculated by using Hartree-Fock (HF) and density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) with 6-31G (d,p) basis set. These theoretical parameters have been compared with the experimental parameters obtained by XRD. The experimental geometries of the compounds have been superimposed with the theoretical geometries calculated by HF and DFT methods. Furthermore, the theoretical IR calculations, molecular electrostatic potential maps (MEP) and frontier molecular orbitals have been created for the compounds.\n\nAn alkaline active xylanase: insights into mechanisms of high pH catalytic adaptation.\n\nPubMed\n\nMamo, Gashaw; Thunnissen, Marjolein; Hatti-Kaul, Rajni; Mattiasson, Bo\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThe alkaliphilic bacterium, Bacillus halodurans S7, produces an alkaline active xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8), which differs from many other xylanases in being operationally stable under alkaline conditions as well as at elevated temperature. Compared to non-alkaline active xylanases, this enzyme has a high percent composition of acidic amino acids which results in high ratio of negatively to positively charged residues. A positive correlation was observed between the charge ratio and the pH optima of xylanases. The recombinant xylanase was crystallized using a hanging drop diffusion method. The crystals belong to the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and the structure was determined at a resolution of 2.1 A. The enzyme has the common eight-fold TIM-barrel structure of family 10 xylanases; however, unlike non-alkaline active xylanases, it has a highly negatively charged surface and a deeper active site cleft. Mutational analysis of non-conserved amino acids which are close to the acid/base residue has shown that Val169, Ile170 and Asp171 are important to hydrolyze xylan at high pH. Unlike the wild type xylanase which has optimum pH at 9-9.5, the triple mutant xylanase (V169A, I170F and D171N), which was constructed using sequence information of alkaline sensitive xylanses was optimally active around pH 7. Compared to non-alkaline active xylanases, the alkaline active xylanases have highly acidic surfaces and fewer solvent exposed alkali labile residues. Based on these results obtained from sequence, structural and mutational analysis, the possible mechanisms of high pH stability and catalysis are discussed. This will provide useful information to understand the mechanism of high pH adaptation and engineering of enzymes that can be operationally stable at high pH.\n\nCrystallization and preliminary X-ray study of a (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol dehydrogenase from Bacillus coagulans 2-6\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiao, Xiangzhi; Huang, Xianhui; Zhang, Guofang; Zhao, Xiufang; Zhu, Xianming; Dong, Hui\n\n2013-01-01\n\n(2R,3R)-2,3-Butanediol dehydrogenase (R,R-BDH) from Bacillus coagulans 2-6 is a zinc-dependent medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenase.

To assess the scope and magnitude of pay-for-performance (P4P) incentives among physician groups and to examine whether such incentives are associated with quality improvement initiatives. Structured telephone survey of leaders of physician groups delivering primary care in Massachusetts. ASSESSED METHODS: Prevalence of P4P incentives among physician groups tied to specific measures of quality or utilization and prevalence of physician group quality improvement initiatives. Most group leaders (89%) reported P4P incentives in at least 1 commercial health plan contract. Incentives were tied to performance on Health Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) quality measures (89% of all groups), utilization measures (66%), use of information technology (52%), and patient satisfaction (37%). Among the groups with P4P and knowledge of all revenue streams, the incentives accounted for 2.2% (range, 0.3%-8.8%) of revenue. P4P incentives tied to HEDIS quality measures were positively associated with groups' quality improvement initiatives (odds ratio, 1.6; P = .02). Thirty-six percent of group leaders with P4P incentives reported that they were very important or moderately important to the group's financial success. P4P incentives are now common among physician groups in Massachusetts, and these incentives most commonly reward higher clinical quality or lower utilization of care. Although the scope and magnitude of incentives are still modest for many groups, we found an association between P4P incentives and the use of quality improvement initiatives.\n\nThe space shuttle payload planning working groups: Executive summaries\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1973-01-01\n\nThe findings of a space shuttle payload planning group session are presented.

To cope effectively with likely future space research opportunities, broad, multilateral, coordinated strategic planning is required. Thus, life scientists from these agencies have allied to form the International Space Life Sciences Strategic Planning Working Group. This Group is formally organized under a charter that specifies the purpose of the Working Group as the development of an international strategic plan for the space life sciences, with periodic revisions as needed to keep the plan current. The plan will be policy-, not operations-oriented. The Working Group also may establish specific implementation teams to coordinate multilateral science policy in specific areas; such teams have been established for space station utilization, and for sharing of flight equipment.\n\nSome New Generalized Difference Spaces of Nonabsolute Type Derived from the Spaces â p and â â\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBaÅar, Feyzi; Karaisa, Ali\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWe introduce the sequence space â p Î»(B) of none absolute type which is a p-normed space and BK space in the cases 0 < p < 1 and 1 â©½ p â©½ â, respectively, and prove that â p Î»(B) and â p are linearly isomorphic for 0 < p â©½ â.

Crystals diffracting to 1.4â Ã resolution were obtained from 10% ethylene glycol, 27% PEG 6000, 500â mM LiCl and 100â mM sodium acetate pH 6.3 in space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 45.75, b = 46.31, c = 60.80â Ã and one molecule in the asymmetric unit.

The experimental screening for the possible crystal forms were carried out using various solvents, which generated three forms. The crystal structure of Form II and III was determined using PXRD pattern whereas structural analysis of Form I has already been reported. Form I, II and II was found to exist in P212121, PNA21 and P21/c space groups respectively. Conformational analysis was performed to account the conformational flexibility of RPG. The obtained conformers were further utilized to obtain the information about the crystal packing pattern of RPG polymorphs by polymorph prediction module. The lattice energy landscape, depicting the relationship between lattice energy and density of the polymorphs has been obtained for various possible polymorphs. The experimentally isolated polymorphs were successfully fitted into lattice energy landscape.\n\nProfessional Discussion Groups: Informal Learning in a Third Space\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nJordan, Robert A.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nIn this ethnographic study, I explored two discussion groups and discovered Third Space elements such as cultural hybridity, counterscript, and sharing of experiences and resources contributed to a safe learning environment existing at the boundaries between participant personal and professional spaces.

The predicted crystal structures of ibuprofen with space group P21/c has the lowest total energy and the largest density, which is nearly indistinguishable with experimental result. In addition, the XRD patterns for predicted crystal structure are highly consistent with recrystallization from solvent of ibuprofen. That indicates that the simulation can accurately predict the crystal structure of ibuprofen from the molecule. Furthermore, based on this crystal structure, we predicted the crystal habit in vacuum using the attachment energy (AE) method and considered solvent effects in a systematic way using the modified attachment energy (MAE) model. The simulation can accurately construct a complete process from molecule to crystal structure to morphology prediction. Experimentally, we observed crystal morphologies in four different polarity solvents compounds (ethanol, acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, and toluene). We found that the aspect ratio decreases of crystal habits in this ibuprofen system were found to vary with increasing solvent relative polarity. Besides, the modified crystal morphologies are in good agreement with the observed experimental morphologies. Finally, this work may guide computer-aided design of the desirable crystal morphology.\n\nINFLUENCE OF SPAWNING GROUP SIZE AND SPACE ON REPRODUCTION BY SHEEPSHEAD MINNOWS, CYPRINODON VARIEGATUS\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nCripe, G.M., R.L.

We prove a spectral gap rigidity result for the central sequence algebra {N' \\\\cap M^Ï} of any nonamenable von Neumann subalgebra with normal expectation {N subset M}. We use this result to show that for any strongly ergodic essentially free nonsingular action {Î \\\\curvearrowright (X, Î¼)} of any bi-exact countable discrete group on a standard probability space, the corresponding group measure space factor {L^â(X) rtimes Î} has no nontrivial central sequence. Using recent results of Boutonnet et al. (Local spectral gap in simple Lie groups and applications, 2015), we construct, for every {0 < Î» â¤ 1}, a type {III_Î»} strongly ergodic essentially free nonsingular action {F_â \\\\curvearrowright (X_Î», Î¼_Î»)} of the free group {{F}_â} on a standard probability space so that the corresponding group measure space type {III_Î»} factor {L^â(X_Î», Î¼_Î») rtimes F_â} has no nontrivial central sequence by our main result. In particular, we obtain the first examples of group measure space type {III} factors with no nontrivial central sequence.\n\nP-MASS and P-GBA: Two new hardware developments for growing plants in space\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nHoehn, Alexander; Luttges, Marvin W.; Robinson, Michael C.; Stodieck, Louis S.; Kliss, Mark H.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nPlant growth, and especially plant performance experiments in microgravity are limited by the currently available plant growth facilities (low light levels, inadequate nutrient delivery and atmosphere conditioning systems, insufficient science instrumentation, infrequent flight opportunities). In addition, mission durations of 10 to 14 days aboard the NSTS Space Shuttle allow for only brief periods of microgravity exposure with respect to the life cycle of a plant. Based on seed germination experiments, using the Generic BioProcessing Apparatus hardware (GBA), two new payloads have been designed specifically for plant growth. These payloads provide new opportunities for plant gravitational and space biology research and emphasize the investigation of plant performance (photosynthesis, biomass accumulations) in microgravity. The Plant-Module for Autonomous Space Support (P-MASS) was designed to utilize microgravity exposure times in excess of 30 days on the first flight of the recoverable COMET satellite (Commercial Experiment Transporter). The Plant-Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (P-GBA), is designed for the National Space Transportation System (NSTS) Space Shuttle middeck and the SPACEHAB environment. The P-GBA is an evolution from the GBA hardware and P-MASS (plant chamber and instrumentation). The available light levels of both payloads more than double currently available capabilities.\n\nInvestigation of intermolecular interactions in finasteride drug crystals in view of X-ray and Hirshfeld surface analysis\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBojarska, Joanna; Maniukiewicz, Waldemar\n\n2015-11-01\n\nThe N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solvate hemihydrate (1) of finasteride, has been structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction at 100 K and compared with previously reported finasteride crystalline forms. In addition, in order to resolve ambiguity concerning H-bond interactions, the crystal structure of finasteride hemihydrate, (2), originally reported by Schultheiss et al. in 2009, has been redetermined with higher precision. The (1) and (2) pseudopolymorphs of finasteride crystallize as orthorhombic in chiral P212121 space group with two very similar host molecules in the asymmetric unit. The conformation of fused 6-membered rings are screw-boat, chair and chair for both molecules, while 5-membered rings assume chair in (1), and half-chair in (2). There is a fairly close resemblance of the molecular geometry for all analyzed compounds, arising due to the rigid host molecule. Inter- and intramolecular host-host, host-guest strong O-H&ctdot;O, N-H&ctdot;O hydrogen bonds and weak C-H&ctdot;O interactions form 3D net conferring stability to the crystal packing. Finasterides can be classified as synthon pseudopolymorphs. Isostructural solvates crystallizing in the orthorhombic space group P212121, with Zâ§ = 2, exhibit R22(8) C22(15) network, monoclinic solvate (Zâ§ = 1) possess D11(2), while both orthorhombic and monoclinic polymorphs have C(4) motifs, respectively. The structural similarities and subtle differences have been interpreted in view of the 3D Hirshfeld surface analysis and associated 2D fingerprint plots, which enabled detailed qualitative and quantitative insight into the intermolecular interactions. The 97-100% of Hirshfeld surface areas are due to HÂ·Â·Â·H, OÂ·Â·Â·H/H&ctdot;O, CÂ·Â·Â·H/H&ctdot;C and N&ctdot;H/H&ctdot;N contacts. Furthermore, the electrostatic potential has been mapped over the Hirshfeld surfaces to decode the electrostatic complementarities, which exist in the crystal packing.\n\nAnagostic interactions in chiral separation. Polymorphism in a [Co(II)(L)] complex: Crystallographic and theoretical studies\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAwwadi, Firas F.; Hodali, Hamdallah A.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nSyntheses and crystal structures of two polymorphs of the complex [Co(II)(L)], where H2L = 2,2'-[cis-1,2-diaminocyclohexanediylbis (nitrilo-methylidyne)]bis (5-dimethyl-amino]phenol, have been studied. The two polymorphs concomitantly crystallized by vapour diffusion of solvent. The first polymorph (I) crystallized as a racemate in the centrosymmetric tetragonal I41/a space group. The second polymorph (II) crystallized in the chiral orthorhombic space group P212121. The chiral conformers of symmetrical cis-1,2-disubstituted cyclohexane molecules cannot be resolved in the liquid or gas phases, due to the rapid ring inversion. In the present study, the two chiral conformers are present in crystals of polymorph I, whereas, only one chiral conformer is present in crystals of polymorph II. Crystal structure analysis indicated that the formation of two different polymorphs of [Co(II)(L)] complex can be rationalized based on Csbnd H&ctdot;Co anagostic interactions. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations indicated that Csbnd H&ctdot;Co interactions are due to HOMO-LUMO interactions.\n\nEnvironmental interactions in space exploration: Environmental interactions working group\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nKolecki, Joseph C.; Hillard, G. Barry\n\n1992-01-01\n\nWith the advent of the Space Exploration Initiative, the possibility of designing and using systems on scales heretofore unattempted presents exciting new challenges in systems design and space science. The environments addressed by the Space Exploration Initiative include the surfaces of the Moon and Mars, as well as the varied plasma and field environments which will be encountered by humans and cargo enroute to these destinations. Systems designers will need to understand environmental interactions and be able to model these mechanisms from the earliest conceptual design stages through design completion. To the end of understanding environmental interactions and establishing robotic precursor mission requirements, an Environmental Interactions Working Group was established as part of the Robotic Missions Working Group. The working group is described, and its current activities are updated.\n\nExpression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of conjugated polyketone reductase C2 (CPR-C2) from Candida parapsilosis IFO 0708.\n\nPubMed\n\nYamamura, Akihiro; Maruoka, Shintaro; Ohtsuka, Jun; Miyakawa, Takuya; Nagata, Koji; Kataoka, Michihiko; Kitamura, Nahoko; Shimizu, Sakayu; Tanokura, Masaru\n\n2009-11-01\n\nConjugated polyketone reductase C2 (CPR-C2) from Candida parapsilosis IFO 0708 is a member of the NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of ketopantoyl lactone to d-pantoyl lactone.

Spectroscopic data gives the strong evidence that ligand is coordinated through azomethine nitrogen and enolic oxygen with metal ion. The DNA binding studies revealed that the complexes bind to CT-DNA via intercalation/electrostatic interaction. All the targeted compounds showed more pronounced DNA cleavage activity in the presence of H2O2 and also inhibit the growth of in vitro antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\n\nSixty years from discovery to solution: crystal structure of bovine liver catalase form III\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nForoughi, Leila M.; Kang, You-Na; Matzger, Adam J.\n\n2012-03-27\n\nThe crystallization and structural characterization of bovine liver catalase (BLC) has been intensively studied for decades. Forms I and II of BLC have previously been fully characterized using single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Form III has previously been analyzed by electron microscopy, but owing to the thinness of this crystal form an X-ray crystal structure had not been determined. Here, the crystal structure of form III of BLC is presented in space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 68.7, b = 173.7, c = 186.3 {angstrom}. The asymmetric unit is composed of the biological tetramer, which is packed in a tetrahedronmoreÂ Â» motif with three other BLC tetramers.

Vdh catalyzes the activation of vitamin D3 via sequential hydroxylation reactions: these reactions involve the conversion of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol or VD3) to 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)VD3] and the subsequent conversion of 25(OH)VD3 to 1Î±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [calciferol or 1Î±,25(OH)2VD3]. Overexpression of recombinant Vdh was carried out using a Rhodococcus erythropolis expression system and the protein was subsequently purified and crystallized. Two different crystal forms were obtained by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method at 293â K using polyethylene glycol as a precipitant. The form I crystal belonged to the trigonal space group P31, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 61.7, c = 98.8â Ã . There is one Vdh molecule in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 47.6%.

There is one Vdh molecule in the asymmetric unit, with a solvent content of 46.7%. Native data sets were collected to resolutions of 1.75 and 3.05â Ã for form I and form II crystals, respectively, using synchrotron radiation. The structure solution was obtained by the molecular-replacement method and model refinement is in progress for the form I crystal.

Volume 5: Space research and development facilities task group\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\n1994-01-01\n\nWith the beginnings of the U.S. space program, there was a pressing need to develop facilities that could support the technology research and development, testing, and operations of evolving space systems. Redundancy in facilities that was once and advantage in providing flexibility and schedule accommodation is instead fast becoming a burden on scarce resources. As a result, there is a clear perception in many sectors that the U.S. has many space R&D facilities that are under-utilized and which are no longer cost-effective to maintain. At the same time, it is clear that the U.S. continues to possess many space R&D facilities which are the best -- or among the best -- in the world. In order to remain world class in key areas, careful assessment of current capabilities and planning for new facilities is needed. The National Facility Study (NFS) was initiated in 1992 to develop a comprehensive and integrated long-term plan for future aerospace facilities that meets current and projected government and commercial needs. In order to assess the nation's capability to support space research and development (R&D), a Space R&D Task Group was formed. The Task Group was co-chaired by NASA and DOD. The Task Group formed four major, technologically- and functionally- oriented working groups: Human and Machine Operations; Information and Communications; Propulsion and Power; and Materials, Structures, and Flight Dynamics. In addition to these groups, three supporting working groups were formed: Systems Engineering and Requirements; Strategy and Policy; and Costing Analysis. The Space R&D Task Group examined several hundred facilities against the template of a baseline mission and requirements model (developed in common with the Space Operations Task Group) and a set of excursions from the baseline. The model and excursions are described in Volume 3 of the NFS final report. In addition, as a part of the effort, the group examined key strategic issues associated with space R\n\nPreliminary Crystallographic Study of Hemoglobin from Buffalo (Bubalus bubalis): A Low Oxygen Affinity Species.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalasubramanian, Moovarkumudalvan; Moorthy, Ponnuraj Sathya; Neelagandan, Kamariah; Ponnuswamy, Mondikalipudur Nanjappa Gounder\n\n2009-01-01\n\nHemoglobin is a tetrameric, iron-containing metalloprotein, which plays a vital role in the transportation of oxygen from lungs to tissues and carbon dioxide back to lungs. Though good amount of work has already been done on hemoglobins, the scarcity of data on three dimensional structures pertaining to low oxygen affinity hemoglobins from mammalian species, motivated our group to work on this problem specifically. Herein, we report the preliminary crystallographic analysis of buffalo hemoglobin, which belongs to low oxygen affinity species. The buffalo blood was collected, purified by anion exchange chromatography and crystallized with PEG 3350 using 50mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.7 as a precipitant by hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Data collection was carried out using mar345dtb image plate detector system. Buffalo hemoglobin crystallizes in orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with one whole biological molecule (alpha2beta2) in the asymmetric unit with cell dimensions a=63.064A, b=74.677A, c=110.224A.\n\nRadiological Protection in Space: Indication from the ICRP Task Group\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDietze, GÃ¼nther\n\nIn 2007 the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) has established a Task Group (Radiation Protection in Space) dealing with the problems of radiation protection of astronauts in space missions. Its first task is a report on \"Assessment of Radiation Exposure of Astronauts in Space\". When the ICRP published its general recommendations for radiological protection in 2007 (ICRP Publication 103 following ICRP Publication 60 (1991)) it was obvious that these recommendations do not really consider the special situation of astronauts in space. The radiation field with its high content of charged particles of very high energies strongly differs from usual radiation fields on ground. For example, this has consequences for the assessment of doses in the body of astronauts. The ICRP Task Group has discussed this situation and the presentation will deal with some consequences for the concept of radiation dosimetry and radiological protection in space. This includes e. g. the assessment of organ doses and the application of the effective dose concept with its definition of radiation weighting factors. Radiation quality of high energy heavy ions may be defined different than usually performed on ground. An approach of using the quality factor concept in the definition of an \"effective dose\" is favored for application in space missions similar to the method proposed in NCRP Report 142. New data calculated on the basis of the reference anthropomorphic voxel phantoms recommended by ICRP support this procedure. Individual dosimetry is a further subject of discussion in the Task Group. While the operational dose equivalent quantities generally in use in radiation protection on ground are not helpful for applications in space, different procedures of the assessment of organ and effective doses are applied. The Task Group is dealing with this situation.\n\nSubluminal group velocity and dispersion of Laguerre Gauss beams in free space.\n\nPubMed\n\nBareza, Nestor D; Hermosa, Nathaniel\n\n2016-05-27\n\nThat the speed of light in free space c is constant has been a pillar of modern physics since the derivation of Maxwell and in Einstein's postulate in special relativity. This has been a basic assumption in light's various applications. However, a physical beam of light has a finite extent such that even in free space it is by nature dispersive. The field confinement changes its wavevector, hence, altering the light's group velocity vg. Here, we report the subluminal vg and consequently the dispersion in free space of Laguerre-Gauss (LG) beam, a beam known to carry orbital angular momentum. The vg of LG beam, calculated in the paraxial regime, is observed to be inversely proportional to the beam's divergence Î¸0, the orbital order â and the radial order p. LG beams of higher orders travel relatively slower than that of lower orders. As a consequence, LG beams of different orders separate in the temporal domain along propagation. This is an added effect to the dispersion due to field confinement. Our results are useful for treating information embedded in LG beams from astronomical sources and/or data transmission in free space.\n\nStudent \"Facebook\" Groups as a Third Space: Between Social Life and Schoolwork\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nAaen, Janus; Dalsgaard, Christian\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe paper examines educational potentials of \"Facebook\" groups that are created and managed by students without any involvement from teachers.

Complexes 1-3 were structurally characterized by X-ray single-crystal diffraction, IR, UV-vis, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Complex 1 crystallizes in the chiral space group C2, which exhibits a mono-nuclear structure. Both complexes 2 and 3 display a one-dimensional (1D) tape structure, which crystallize in chiral space group P21212 and P212121, respectively. Among these complexes, there exist a variety of hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions, through which a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture will be generated. Compared with the standard (Voriconazole), these Cu-based complexes show the more potent inhibiting efficiency against the species of Candida and Aspergillus. Moreover, among these complexes, complex 1 shows the most excellent efficiency.\n\nExpression, purification, crystallization and preliminary X-ray analysis of conjugated polyketone reductase C2 (CPR-C2) from Candida parapsilosis IFO 0708\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYamamura, Akihiro; Maruoka, Shintaro; Ohtsuka, Jun; Miyakawa, Takuya; Nagata, Koji; Kataoka, Michihiko; Kitamura, Nahoko; Shimizu, Sakayu; Tanokura, Masaru\n\n2009-01-01\n\nConjugated polyketone reductase C2 (CPR-C2) from Candida parapsilosis IFOÂ 0708 is a member of the NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily and catalyzes the stereospecific reduction of ketopantoyl lactone to d-pantoyl lactone. A diffraction-quality crystal of recombinant CPR-C2 was obtained by the sitting-drop vapour-diffusion method using PEG 3350 as the precipitant. The crystal diffracted X-rays to 1.7â Ã resolution on beamline NW12A of the Photon Factory-Advanced Ring (Tsukuba, Japan). The crystal belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 55.02, b = 68.30, cÂ = 68.93â Ã . The Matthews coefficient (V M = 1.76â Ã 3â Daâ1) indicated that the crystal contained one CPR-C2 molecule per asymmetric unit.

UPH was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity with the specific activity 230 units/mg with a recovery of 80%, yielding 120 mg of enzyme from 3g cells. Crystals of enzyme suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained in a preparative ultracentrifuge. The packing of the molecules in the crystals may be described by the space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) with the unit cell constants a = 90.4; b = 128.8; c = 136.8 A. There is one molecule per asymmetric unit, Vm = 2.4. These crystals diffract to at least 2.5-2.7 A resolution. The hexameric structure of UPH was directly demonstrated by electron microscopy study and image processing.\n\nStudy of liquid crystal space groups using controlled tilting with cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nSagalowicz, Laurent; Acquistapace, Simone; Watzke, Heribert J; Michel, Martin\n\n2007-11-20\n\nWe developed a method that enables differentiation between liquid crystalline-phase particles corresponding to different space groups. It consists of controlled tilting of the specimen to observe different orientations of the same particle using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. This leads to the visualization of lattice planes (or reflections) that are present for a given structure and absent for the other one(s) and that give information on liquid crystalline structures and their space groups. In particular, we show that we can unambiguously distinguish among particles having the inverted micellar cubic (space group Fd(3)m, 227), the inverted bicontinuous gyroid (space group Ia(3)d, 230), the inverted bicontinuous diamond (space group Pn(3)m, 224), and the inverted bicontinuous primitive cubic structure (space group Im(3)m, 229).\n\nThe structures of marialite (Me[subscript 6]) and meionite (Me[subscript 93]) in space groups P4[subscript 2]/n and I4/m, and the absence of phase transitions in the scapolite series\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAntao, Sytle M.; Hassan, Ishmael; Calgary)\n\n2014-05-28\n\nThe crystal structures of marialite (Me{sub 6}) from Badakhshan, Afghanistan and meionite (Me{sub 93}) from Mt. Vesuvius, Italy were obtained using synchrotron high-resolution powder X-ray diffraction (HRPXRD) data and Rietveld structure refinements. Their structures were refined in space groups I4/m and P42/n, and similar results were obtained. The Me{sub 6} sample has a formula Ca{sub 0.24}Na{sub 3.37}K{sub 0.24}[Al{sub 3.16}Si{sub 8.84}O{sub 24}]Cl{sub 0.84}(CO{sub 3}){sub 0.15}, and its unit-cell parameters are a = 12.047555(7), c = 7.563210(6) {angstrom}, and V = 1097.751(1) {angstrom}{sup 3}. The average (T1-O) distances are 1.599(1) {angstrom} in I4/m and 1.600(2) {angstrom} in P4{sub 2}/n, indicating that themoreÂ Â» T1 site contains only Si atoms. In P4{sub 2}/n, the average distances of (T2-O) = 1.655(2) and (T3-O) = 1.664(2) {angstrom} are distinct and are not equal to each other. However, the mean (T2,3-O) = 1.659(2) {angstrom} in P4{sub 2}/n and is identical to the (T2-O) = 1.65"
