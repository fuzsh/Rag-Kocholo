        "text": "1881 Â· The Assassination of James Garfield\n\nGarfield was shot twice by Charles J. Guitea at Railroad Station in Washington, D.C. on July 2, 1881. After eleven weeks of intensive and other care Garfield died in Elberon, New Jersey, the second of four presidents to be assassinated, following Abraham Lincoln.\n\n1896 Â· Utah Becomes a State\n\nAfter three prior attempts to become a state, the United States Congress accepted Utah into the Union on one condition. This condition was that the new state rewrite their constitution to say that all forms of polygamy were banned. The territory agreed, and Utah became a state on January 4, 1896.\n\n1901 Â· Assassination of Mckinley\n\nPresident William McKinley was shot at the Temple of Music, in the Pan-American Exposition, while shaking hands with the public. Leon Czolgosz shot him twice in the abdomen because he thought it was his duty to do so. McKinley died after eight days of watch and care. He was the third American president to be assassinated. After his death, Congress passed legislation to officially make the Secret Service and gave them responsibility for protecting the President at all times."
