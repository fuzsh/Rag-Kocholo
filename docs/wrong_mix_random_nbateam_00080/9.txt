Susannah Harker

I met Susannah Harker after her performance as Amanda Wingfield in Tennessee Williams' play The Glass Menagerie, staged at the Nottingham Playhouse in March 2016. She signed a photo for me, of her as Matilda Simms in an episode of Midsomer Murders, and my dad took this super photo of us.

Susannah Owens was born in Hampstead, London in 1965. She is the daughter of the English actress Polly Adams and the actor Richard Owens. She has a sister Caroline Owens. Susannah and Caroline belong to a long theatrical tradition. Her great-great-great-grandfather was an actor called William Pierpoint Harker, whose son Joseph Harker (1856-1927) was a scene painter in the London theatre. He was a friend of the writer Bram Stoker, who named the hero of Dracula (Jonathan Harker) after him. One of Joseph's sons was the veterancharacter

veteran character actor Gordon Harker (1885-1967), who was Susannah's great-great-uncle. It was inevitable that Susannah would adopt Harker as her stage name, in order to keep the name's long theatrical tradition going.

It was in 1990 however, that Susannah shot to national prominence, when she starred as Mattie Storin, a journalist for the fictional Chronicle newspaper, in the highly acclaimed four-part series House of Cards (1990). Her co-star was Ian Richardson as politician Francis Urquhart. Storin falls for Urquhart romantically, and calls him Daddy.

Susannah was educated at the Convent of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Boarding School run by nuns at Billingshurst in Sussex, and later trained at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London.
