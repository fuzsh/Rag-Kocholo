        "text": "This is an Accepted Manuscript of an article published by Taylor & Francis in Christian Higher Education, 17.1-2 (2018), 110-112. Available online: http://www.tandfonline.com/10.1080/15363759.2018.1406259 From the review:\"The focus on history, while appropriate to the historical consciousness of modernity, also points out what is missing in Purvis’ own methodology. He clearly admires the pursuit of Wissenschaft and wants to recommend for our time a “powerful synthesis” (p. 230) between faith and reason, faith and history, and the confessional and the empirical. He also recognizes that their pursuit involved the modern theologians in various philosophical commitments; yet he never clarifies his own philosophical position. This leaves the reader with a feeling that Purvis too believes in a “presuppositionless” history of the encyclopedic form to which the reader can somehow return, if only Purvis can give us an encyclopedic understanding of the encyclopedia.\""
