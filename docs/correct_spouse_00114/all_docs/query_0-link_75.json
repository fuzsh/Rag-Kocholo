        "text": "BEVERLY Hills, 90210's Tori Spelling and Canadian actor Dean McDermott have apparently moved on from their messy marriage.\n\nAlthough not officially divorced yet, they were recently spotted on dates with new prospective lovers.\n\nTori, 50, was caught packing on the PDA in Los Angeles with advertising CEO Ryan Cramer.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the lovebirds were seen getting hot and heavy outside a convenience store at the end of a date night.\n\nTori and Ryan couldn't seem to keep their hands off each other once they locked lips.\n\nThey were seen making out in the backseat of an Uber that picked them up and whisked them into the night.\n\nMeanwhile, Dean, 56, crossed a major relationship milestone when he drove his new girlfriend Lily Calo to the airport.\n\nHe, too, made no secret of his feelings, giving the senior account executive a lengthy goodbye at the gate with plenty of kisses to remember him by.\n\nTori and Dean seem to have found happiness with others, as a bitter divorce battle between the two drags on.\n\n'A NEW JOURNEY'\n\nIn June, Dean posted a formal letter telling his Instagram followers that he and Tori were now \"starting a new journey.\"\n\nBut just hours later, the post appeared to have been deleted - with no explanation.\n\nIn the emotional statement, he wrote: \"It’s with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways, and start a new journey of our own.\n\n\"We will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time.\n\n\"We ask that you all respect our privacy as we take this time to surround our family with love and work our way through this. Thank you all for your support and kindness.\"\n\n'A COMPLETE DISASTER'\n\nJust a few days later, a source close to the couple exclusively revealed to The U.S. Sun that Tori's marriage is \"a complete disaster.\"\n\n\"Dean has spoken about leaving Tori for 4 years and the night he announced their marriage was over on social media, it shocked Tori because she never takes Dean seriously.\n\n\"But that night, they both were drinking heavily and had a huge blowout fight,\" the insider claimed.\n\n\"The announcement on social media was like the dropping of a bomb. She had no idea he would take it that far,\" they added.\n\nThe couple who have had their fair share of ups and downs have been \"faking a happy marriage all while Dean has been sleeping above the garage.\n\n\"And Tori has been sleeping with two of her daughters in her bedroom,\" the source alleged.\n\n\"They truly are miserable. They literally fight nonstop and find it incredibly hard to hold it together in public.\"\n\nThe U.S. Sun revealed Dean has wanted to file for divorce as early as July 2021, but he could not \"afford it.\"\n\nAnother insider added: \"Tori and Dean are totally stuck together right now. Neither of them can afford to go through divorce proceedings.\n\n\"Right now, divorce isn't on the horizon because they can't swing it financially. They are in a living nightmare.\"\n\nCHEATING SCANDAL\n\nIn November 2021, rumors swirled of a possible breakup due to his cheating scandal.\n\nHe admitted to cheating on his partner in 2014 and spoke about his infidelity on True Tori.\n\nA source told People that the former pair were \"not in a good place and have been evaluating their relationship.\"\n\nThe insider continued: \"It's been very chilly between them for a long time. They have been through the wringer before, but they've always gotten out of it.\"\n\nEVERYTHING IS AWESOME\n\nDean previously insisted \"everything was great\" between the pair in an interview with The U.S. Sun after speculation they had secretly split.\n\nHe said in November 2022: \"Everything is amazing. Everything's great. We're having a lot of fun.\n\n\"We're loving the cold weather and then getting ready for the craziness of Thanksgiving and Christmas... I'm excited.\n\n\"We live in a cul-de-sac and this year we're gonna do a big potluck with all our neighbors. So really looking forward to that.\"\n\nHe also joked to fans: \"I'm sorry I'm off the market, ladies. I'm so sorry.\"\n\nThe two married in 2006 and share five kids: Liam, Stella, Hattie, Finn, and Beau.\n\nBefore they married, Dean was hitched to ex-wife Mary Jo Eustace, 61, and Tori was linked to ex-husband, Charlie Shanian, 58."
