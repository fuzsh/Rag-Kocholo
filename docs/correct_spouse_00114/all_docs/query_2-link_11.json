        "text": "Tori Spelling is already questioning her decision to divorce Dean McDermott.\n\nThe “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum admitted that she’s considered staying in her marriage for the sake of the five children she shares with the Canadian actor.\n\n“I’m not gonna lie, there are moments where I’m like, ‘Should I have stayed?’ What are the long-term ramifications on the children of staying in a marriage where they have a family, they’re in the same house, it’s all in tact, you move fluidly, but there’s so much unhappiness, so much anger?” she said on Monday’s episode of her “Misspelling” podcast.\n\nThe confession comes one week after the actress, 50, called her estranged husband, 57, in the middle of her podcast recording to inform him she had officially filed for divorce.\n\n“At what point is it worth it to have to go through that process where they’re separated and they go see different parents?” she pondered. “I don’t know. I didn’t know the answer until I was in it.”\n\nMcDermott – who shares Liam, 17, Stella, 15, Hattie, 12, Finn, 11, and Beau, 7, with Spelling – has already moved on with new girlfriend, Lily Calo.\n\n“There’s still times where I’m like, ‘Oh…,’ because we do have family dinners with Dean and his girlfriend,” Spelling explained. “I like her a lot. I like Lily a lot. It’s just different.”\n\nShe added, “Dean is a very good looking man. That has never changed. I think there was just so much resentment that was built up that I couldn’t go back to that.”\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nThe pair split nine months before Spelling filed for divorce, and she said she’s since realized not everyone should stay married just for the sake of their children.\n\n“I don’t know if I believe that everyone should end up with the person they have kids with. I just don’t know if it’s ultimately possible,” she said, noting that kids can “break a relationship.”\n\n“It’s my belief now we have two soulmates or two partners we’re supposed to have — one for that chapter and one for our chapter.”\n\nSpelling and McDermott met in 2005 while married to Charlie Shanian and Mary Jo Eustace, respectively. They tied the knot the following year."
