        "text": "Marriage-wrecking actress Tori Spelling walked down the aisle again yesterday, wedding beau Dean McDermott on a private tropical island in Fiji.\n\nThe barefoot bride wore white, despite her less-than-virtuous actions in stealing the groom from Canadian sitcom actress Mary Jo Eustace last year while Spelling and McDermott were filming a television movie together.\n\n“We didn’t want to wait another day to get married,” Spelling told People magazine.\n\nHer new husband added, “I’ve never had as much desire to get married and make a woman my wife as I’ve had with her. The feeling is overwhelming. We’re soul mates.”\n\nMcDermott’s words must have appeared to be an extra slap in the face for Eustace.\n\nShe’s been shopping around a book called “My Husband Left me for Tori Spelling” since the former “Beverly Hills 90210” star bedded McDermott only months after he and Eustace had adopted a baby girl.\n\nSpelling was newly married at the time to actor-writer Charlie Shanian. Their divorce was finalized this month.\n\nThe nondenominational ceremony yesterday was attended only by the bride and groom, People reported.\n\nMcDermott proposed to Spelling on Christmas Eve in Toronto, popping the question with a diamond-and-sapphire ring following a ride in a horse-drawn carriage."
