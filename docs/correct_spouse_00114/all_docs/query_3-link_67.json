        "text": "Who Is Tori Spelling?\n\nIf you’re a product of the 90s, you probably know who Tori Spelling is. Famous for playing none other than Donna Martin on the original “Beverly Hills, 90210,” Tori’s face graced many a television screen throughout the 90s and early 2000s.\n\n“Beverly Hills, 90210” was one of the biggest hit shows of the 90s, and it quickly shot her name to fame. But Tori Spelling’s foray into acting and celebrity culture seems to have been written in the stars. Her dad was Hollywood mogul Aaron Spelling, making Tori one of Hollywood’s most well-known Nepo babies.\n\nThe Spelling Family Dynasty\n\nIt can be argued that Tori Spelling was born into Hollywood royalty. Her father was acclaimed Hollywood producer Aaron Spelling, who became famous for producing shows such as “Charmed,” “Charlie’s Angels,” and, of course, “Beverly Hills 90210.” Aaron was such a prolific producer that he still holds the record for creating the most TV shows in American history.\n\nAlong with fame came a boatload of money. By the time Victoria Davey Spelling was born on May 16, 1973, Aaron had already amassed a considerable amount of wealth through his successful production company. There’s no denying that all of her dad’s hard work allowed her to have a pretty charmed childhood.\n\nA Charming Childhood\n\nTori grew up with a silver spoon in her mouth alongside her younger brother, Randy Spelling. With her father’s enormous fortune, how could they not? Aaron and his wife Candy gave their kids anything and everything they wanted– even the impossible. Tori recalled a memorable Christmas when her parents managed to get fresh snow onto their backyard in Los Angeles.\n\nThis was no easy feat, considering it never naturally snows in sunny Los Angeles. Tori was used to her parents pulling out all the stops for holidays, birthdays, and any small life event in between. While many people would consider all this privilege to be a pretty sweet deal, things were less than perfect under the shiny veneer of money.\n\nA Total Daddy’s Girl\n\nAs the oldest daughter of the family, Tori grew up being doted on by her father. Tori has childhood memories of her dad spending quality time with her and giving her special attention despite his busy schedule. She revealed in her memoir, “Stori Telling,” that her dad even told her he loved her more than Tori’s mom, Candy.\n\nThis special treatment from her dad created a strained relationship with her mom. Even as a little girl, Tori felt awkward, criticized, and on guard around her mother. Although Tori has never disclosed any specifics, it seems that Candy constantly criticized Tori and spoke down to her as a child, which naturally created conflict between the two as Tori got older.\n\nTori Dips Her Toe Into Acting\n\nWith a super-successful producer like her father, it was only natural that Tori was curious about acting as a child. Never one to skimp on his kids, Aaron hired an acting coach for Tori when she was only six years old. From there, Tori began testing the waters with minor roles in her dad’s TV shows.\n\nTori made appearances on famous shows like “The Love Boat,” “Fantasy Island,” and “T.J. Hooker.” While some say that Tori’s acting skills have never been top-notch, there’s no denying that her dad wanted to see her happy. With so much power and influence, it makes sense that Aaron Spelling took advantage of his connections to help Tori out.\n\nGood Old School Days\n\nDespite the at-home tension between Tori and her mom, the young actress-to-be grew up rubbing shoulders with other Nepo babies and Hollywood elites. Naturally, Tori attended the best private schools in the Los Angeles area from kindergarten all the way through high school.\n\nIn a funny example of foreshadowing, Tori attended Beverly Hills High School for a bit before transferring to Harvard-Westlake School, one of the most elite private schools in the area. She graduated in 1991, just as her role in “Beverly Hills, 90210” was picking up steam. By the time she graduated, she and her family had moved to a much fancier home.\n\nTori’s Teenage Years at “The Manor”\n\nAaron and Candy Spelling made waves in the late 1980s when they had their Holmby Hills mansion built on an exclusive property that formerly belonged to Bing Crosby. Coming in at 56,500 square feet, the illustrious mansion is still considered the second-largest house in all of Los Angeles. Tori didn’t only grow up in this extremely opulent house– she also named it.\n\nThe story goes that Tori was the one who named their new home “The Manor.” The name has continued to stick to this day, even though the Spelling family no longer owns the property. Tori was 17 when the house was completed and lived in the mansion for about two years. As an adult, Tori explained that while “The Manor” was beautiful, it never felt cozy or homey to her.\n\nTori’s Breakout Role\n\nTori Spelling’s life changed when she was cast in her dad’s new show “Beverly Hills 90210.” While many assume that her late father got her the role of Donna Martin, the truth is a little different. Tori wanted to prove herself without the help of her famous dad, so she auditioned under the alias “Tori Mitchell.”\n\nOriginally, Tori wanted the starring role of Kelly Taylor, but Jennie Garth got the part instead. She was cast in the supporting role of Donna Martin, who would eventually become a lead character. For obvious reasons, Tori revealed her real last name once she was cast on the show. We can’t help but wonder whether or not the casting directors knew who Tori actually was during the entire audition process!\n\nDad’s Behind-the-Scenes Influence\n\nWhile Aaron Spelling may have been the reason Tori got the part of Donna Martin, we’ll never know for sure. What we do know is that he worked behind the scenes to influence aspects of his daughter’s character on “Beverly Hills 90210.” As an adult, Tori realized that her dad was the one who initially pushed to make her character chaste and abstinent.\n\nIf you’re a “Beverly Hills” fan, you probably remember that Donna was the sweet, rational character who had no intimacy with anyone until season seven. Tori was totally fine with the storyline and even thought it helped teens see themselves in the show. However, she had no idea that her producer-dad was the one who initially brought that storyline to the table. It seems he was trying to protect her image from behind the scenes, which is weirdly sweet.\n\nAn Anything but Average Party\n\nWe all remember a wild party or two from our teenage years, right? Well, none of our parties have anything on Tori Spelling’s house parties growing up in “The Manor.” Even though her mom, Candy, only threw a few parties at the mansion while Tori lived there, they were incredibly memorable. Need proof? Well, Candy’s first party had none other than Prince Charles as a special guest.\n\nYup, that Prince Charles. Aka, the current King of England. No big deal. Prince Charles’ team requested to host a fundraising dinner at “The Manor” during a visit to Los Angeles in 1994. Not many teenagers can say that they attended a party alongside the likes of Prince Charles. Tickets to the fundraiser allegedly cost over $2,000. We wonder if Tori and her family got to attend for free.\n\nSecret Insecurities\n\nDespite being a teen star on a massively popular TV show, Tori Spelling still struggled with self-esteem issues. Teenage years are tough, to begin with, but everything was magnified for Tori because she was growing up in front of millions of strangers on TV. She oftentimes felt like she wasn’t good enough, pretty enough, or popular enough.\n\nFans of her character on the show had no idea that young Tori was dealing with such low self-esteem in her real life. Her “90210” character had it all, from popularity to a dream wardrobe. Tori’s self-esteem issues just go to show that we never truly know what someone is going through.\n\nThe “90210” Wrap Party\n\nTori was only 17 when she started working on the first season of “Beverly Hills, 90210,” but that didn’t stop her from trying to act older to keep up with her costars. Decades after the show debuted, Tori revealed on her 2020 podcast “9021OMG” that she snuck some adult beverages at the “Beverly Hills” season one wrap party. Scandalous!\n\nShe can’t remember how she got a hold of the drinks since she was under the age of 21 at the time, but she does remember getting wildly sick shortly afterward. Her dinner combo of alcohol and spaghetti didn’t do her any favors, and she remembered seeing a lot of her recently eaten food making a comeback at the wrap party. Understandably, her parents grounded her when they found out about her underage antics.\n\nOn-Set Romances\n\nAll of the stars in “Beverly Hills, 90210” were young and attractive, so it’s no surprise that many of them paired up and dated over the years. While Tori Spelling and her costars were tight-lipped about their romances back when they were filming the show, they’ve revealed some secrets as they’ve gotten older.\n\nTori had a fling or two during her time on “90210.” She casually dated Brian Austin Green, who played her on-screen boyfriend. She also had a low-key fling with Jason Priestley and admitted to having kissed the late Luke Perry just once. It seems that everyone was simply having fun while working on the show, so none of Tori’s flings were that serious.\n\nTori Dealt With a Bad Relationship\n\nTori did have at least one serious relationship during the early years of filming “90210,” although it wasn’t the healthiest. She dated actor Nick Savalas for a couple of years in the early 90s, but she wasn’t happy. Nick was verbally abusive toward Tori during the entirety of their relationship, calling her “ugly” when he knew how insecure she was about her looks.\n\nNaturally, Tori’s parents and her “90210” costars weren’t the biggest fans of Nick. Her costar, Luke Perry, always stood by her side and defended her from verbal abuse more than once. Thankfully, Tori was able to extract herself safely from the relationship and move on to bigger and better things.\n\nTori the Snitch?\n\nAny “Beverly Hills 90210” fan no doubt remembers when Shannen Doherty was dramatically fired from the show. However, fans may not know that Tori Spelling may have been the main reason Shannen was abruptly fired. Tori was really close with actress Jennie Garth, and Jennie and Shannen simply did not get along.\n\nTori always acted as the peacemaker between the two, but one day, they got into a physical fight. Tori was over it. She told her dad, Aaron Spelling, about Shannen’s behavior. Being an executive producer on the show, it’s no surprise that he fired Shannen a bit after he learned that news from his daughter. Looking back, Tori regrets that her ratting on Shannen is likely what led her to lose her job.\n\nThe Rumblings of Financial Trouble\n\nAs Tori made a name for herself in “Beverly Hills, 90210,” she found herself with a steady self-earned income for the first time in her life. Once Tori realized how much money she was making, she got busy spending it. She moved out of “The Manor” and started living independently. “I had a hit TV series, so I didn't really need my parents for anything,” Tori said in a 2008 interview.\n\nHowever, this new sense of financial independence eventually got her into some deep trouble. When “90210” ended in 2000, so did her cash flow. As it turns out, Tori had been extravagantly spending beyond her means for years. She loved to go on shopping sprees that could total over $50,000, which she always charged on her credit card. This instance of near-bankruptcy was a tiny peak into Tori’s future financial woes.\n\n“90210” Meets “Scream”\n\nYou know you’ve made it big when a blockbuster movie makes a joke about you. Tori Spelling was forever immortalized when she became the butt of a joke in the original “Scream.” This classic 1996 slasher featured a scene where the character Sidney Prescott bemoaned the possibility of Tori Spelling playing her in a movie about her life.\n\nThe joke was meant as a jab (no pun intended) at Tori’s acting skills, but she took it in stride. In fact, she ended up fully embracing the joke. When fans first saw “Scream” in theaters, they had no idea what they were in for when “Scream 2” would come out. That’s right. Tori actually made an appearance in the sequel.\n\nTori, the “Scream” Queen\n\nIt seems that Tori Spelling has always been a good sport and a fan of self-deprecating humor. After being referenced in the original “Scream,” Tori actually had a cameo in “Scream 2,” which came out in 1997. Like many of her acting gigs after “90210,” Tori plays a fictionalized version of herself in the slasher sequel.\n\nTori plays herself being interviewed about a new movie called “Stab.” Several cheesy scenes from the fake movie are played as a “sneak peek,” too. Here’s where the joke comes in. The movie version of Tori plays a fictionalized version of Sidney Prescott in “Stab.” It seems that Tori ended up playing Sidney in the movie version of her life, after all.\n\nThe Sidney That Almost Was\n\nAs with any Hollywood actor or actress, Tori Spelling has auditioned for many roles that she ultimately didn’t get. Many years after the “Scream” movies premiered, Tori revealed that she actually auditioned for the lead role of Sidney. She knew the joke about herself was in the film, but she went for it anyway.\n\nIn a 2021 Instagram post, Tori wrote, “No one could have played Sidney Prescott other than the amazing Neve Campbell. But, the role I got in ‘Scream 2’ was amazing!” We guess Tori did get to play Sidney, in a way. Other actresses who almost played Sidney were Drew Barrymore, Brittany Murphy, and Reese Witherspoon. That’s some pretty stiff competition!\n\nTori’s First Award Nomination\n\nTori’s tongue-in-cheek cameo appearance in “Scream 2” immediately became legendary. Her role as a fictionalized version of herself playing Sidney Prescott was the first of many self-referential and meta-acting roles Tori would take on throughout her career. However, this cameo appearance remains the most memorable.\n\nTori was even honored with an award nomination for her performance in “Scream 2.” Well, kind of. She was nominated for a Razzie award for “Worst New Star,” which is a compliment of sorts. She was in on the joke, so we don’t think she was too insulted. For better or worse, she didn’t end up winning the Razzie. We’re sure it was an honor just to be nominated.\n\nEnter: Charlie Shahnaian\n\nAlthough Tori’s relationship with her husband, Dean McDermott, is pretty public, not everyone is aware that Tori was married once before. Tori Spelling and Charlie Shahnaian met in 2002 on the set of a play called “Maybe Baby, It’s You.” The two hit it off and got married two years later.\n\nTori and Charlie’s wedding wasn’t just any old event, though. Her dad, Aaron, pulled out all the stops and spent a whopping one million dollars on his daughter’s wedding. The ceremony and reception took place on the grounds of “The Manor.” It was a night to remember, even though their relationship wouldn’t last forever.\n\nA Fateful Meeting\n\nAs any Tori Spelling fan knows, she and her now-husband, Dean McDermott, have had a pretty tumultuous and public relationship. However, Tori had no idea what she was in for when the two first met in 2005. Tori and Dean met in Canada on the set of the “Lifetime” movie “Mind Over Murder,” in which they were both starring.\n\nAccording to Tori, it was “love at first sight.” There was just one teeny, tiny problem. Tori was, of course, already married to Charlie Shanian. Oh, yeah. Dean was also already married to someone else. Despite their already-established marital commitments, the two couldn’t resist the attraction they felt for each other.\n\nAn Irresistible Draw\n\nAs Tori and Dean continued to bond on the set of “Mind Over Murder,” they couldn’t deny how attracted they were to each other. Tori later revealed in her 2008 memoir that the two gave into temptation pretty quickly after having a few drinks together at a bar one evening.\n\nDespite the judgment that both Tori and Dean received at the time, the two couldn’t deny their feelings. To this day, Tori admits that she felt no remorse over her actions, which made her realize that something was “really wrong” with her marriage. After that fateful night, the two took steps to end their respective marriages in order to be together.\n\nHow Charlie Found Out\n\nFor someone to be unfaithful to you, well, it is never a great experience, but we have to admit that the way Charlie Shahnaian found out about Tori’s extramarital interests was pretty rough. In a \"GQ\" interview Charlie gave in 2007, he disclosed that he discovered what was going on through a paparazzi picture in the “National Enquirer.”\n\nDiscovering that your spouse is seeing someone else via a tabloid magazine is a low blow. Understandably, Charlie was pretty salty about it for years after their divorce. As extra salt in the wound, Tori officially broke up with Charlie in her therapist’s office. Granted, Tori didn’t handle this break-up with the most grace. As she grew older, she acknowledged how poorly she treated Charlie and asked for his forgiveness.\n\nAn Elopement in Fiji\n\nLess than a year after meeting, Tori and Dean eloped in Fiji. While getting married on a private island sounds pretty romantic, there was probably another less romantic reason behind their small ceremony. When the two wed on May 7, 2006, Tori had only been divorced from her first husband, Charlie, for a few months.\n\nDean had also just wrapped up a divorce from his former wife, Mary Jo Eustace. Getting married so quickly after separating from their respective spouses made it pretty obvious that they started out at a problematic time. They got some major side-eye from news outlets, but the worst was yet to come.\n\nTori’s Marriage Caused Family Strife\n\nTori’s parents, Aaron and Candy, were none too pleased with Tori’s fast-paced divorce and secret elopement. Although they tried to be supportive of their daughter, Aaron, and Candy struggled with the fact that Tori had essentially left her husband for another person. Very scandalous. As a result, Tori became a bit estranged from her parents after the wedding.\n\nAlthough she’s never publicly admitted it, Candy didn’t seem to be the biggest fan of Dean McDermott in the very beginning. In addition to Candy’s wariness with her new husband, Tori hadn’t even seen her parents for months before the two got married. In a fateful turn of events, Tori saw her father for the first time in months, just a few weeks before he passed away.\n\nTori Gets Meta on “So Notorious”\n\nVicious rumors and catty comments about nepotism have always surrounded Tori Spelling. Throughout the years, many haters have criticized Tori, saying that she would have never gotten acting gigs or fame without the help of her well-connected father. Well, Tori decided to clap back at the haters in the most Tori Spelling way possible: with a TV show.\n\n“So Notorious” debuted on VH1 in 2006. The show was a hilarious, self-aware takedown where Tori played a fictionalized version of herself navigating the world after “90210.” The show was a way for Tori to poke fun at herself while acknowledging that she’s fully aware of what people say about her. “The Manor,” the messy family, and Tori’s reputation as an airhead were all incorporated into the show, which only lasted one season.\n\nTori’s Father Passes Away\n\nOn June 23, 2006, just over a month after Tori’s elopement, Aaron Spelling passed away. The 83-year-old producer and Hollywood legend died from stroke complications at “The Manor,” his sprawling Los Angeles mansion. Candy was by his side when he passed away, but Tori was still in Canada with Dean.\n\nTori announced that she would fly back to LA alongside Dean to be with her family. Rumors began to swirl in the tabloids about tense family strife and drama. Although Tori’s brother, Randy, denied the rumors, we can’t help but wonder if there was a kernel of truth in them. We’ll never know for sure.\n\nAn Unexpected Inheritance\n\nAaron Spelling was worth an estimated $600 million when he passed away in 2006. That’s a whopping amount of money, so it’s no surprise that tabloids immediately began speculating about how much inheritance Tori and her brother Randy would receive. While not exactly the classiest move, the gossip magazines eventually got their answer.\n\nIn a surprising twist of events, it was revealed that Tori and her brother only got $800,000 each. “Only” is a relative term here because most of us would do unspeakable things for that amount of money. However, considering Aaron’s massive wealth, inheriting less than a million seems like a snub. Apparently, the rest of Aaron’s estate was passed down to Tori’s mom, Candy.\n\nOr Maybe Not So “Unexpected”\n\nOnce the news broke that Tori only received a small portion of her dad’s wealth, people began speculating about family drama and hurt feelings. However, Tori defended her father’s decision and revealed that she knew how much money she would receive before her father even passed away.\n\nShe wasn’t shocked by her inheritance because she discussed it over lunch with her dad long before he died. The conversation was probably uncomfortable, but it was definitely necessary, considering her family’s wealth and status. In her memoir, Tori revealed that it was a hard conversation to have with him and that she hated herself for hoping it would be different because she didn't want to take advantage.\n\nRandy Spelling Leaves Hollywood\n\nWhile Tori Spelling has remained in the limelight for most of her life, not much is known about her younger brother, Randy. There’s a very intentional reason for that. Randy dabbled in acting and reality TV in the 90s and early 2000s but decided to leave Hollywood altogether after Aaron Spelling passed away.\n\nRandy decided to permanently move to Portland, Oregon, to pursue a career as a life coach. He’s been there ever since, occasionally traveling between his home and LA for work. Unfortunately, it seems the family tensions extend to the relationship between Tori and Randy. Tori became estranged from him after their father’s passing.\n\nTori & Dean: A Reality TV Empire\n\nAmidst the family strife and drama, Tori and Dean scored the first of many reality TV show deals. Originally called “Tori & Dean: Inn Love,” the reality show followed a pregnant Tori and Dean as they searched for a bed-and-breakfast property to purchase with Tori’s inheritance. The show was a huge hit when it aired, and it was quickly renewed for a second season.\n\nAfter the first two seasons, the couple pivoted away from the bed-and-breakfast storyline and started documenting more of their day-to-day life raising their kids in Los Angeles. Fans loved getting a glimpse into their growing family, cute kids, and funny shenanigans. The show was eventually renamed “Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood” and remained on-air until 2012.\n\nTori’s First Child Is Born\n\nAbout a year after tying the knot with Dean McDermott, the couple welcomed their first child. Liam Aaron was born in 2007, and Tori was over the moon. Sources said that Tori had a challenging child delivery and had to undergo a C-section, but both Tori and Liam came out on the other side healthy and happy.\n\nThe couple was filming “Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood” while Tori was pregnant, so they featured Liam’s early newborn days on the show. As with many reality shows of the time, Tori and Dean shared a lot about their family life and their struggles as new parents. Fans fell in love with the new family and Liam’s adorable baby antics.\n\nTori and Dean Welcome Stella Doreen\n\nA little over a year after Liam was born, Tori gave birth to her second child, a daughter whom she named Stella. Their new baby girl’s name was quite significant. Tori revealed that there was a very special reason for giving her first-born daughter the name Stella. As a young girl, Tori was obsessed with “Great Expectations” by Charles Dickens.\n\nOne of the main characters in the book is named Estella, but that didn’t feel quite right to Tori and Dean. When Dean suggested shortening the name to just Stella, Tori immediately knew it was perfect. In addition, the couple gave Stella the middle name of Doreen in honor of Dean’s late mother.\n\nTori’s Fears About Motherhood\n\nTori Spelling got quite candid about her feelings and fears when it came to the birth of her first daughter. Tori has a notoriously strained relationship with her mom, Candy. When she learned that she was having a baby girl, she couldn’t help but wonder if her relationship with her own daughter would be just as tumultuous.\n\nBefore Stella was born, Tori felt excited at the possibility of building a relationship with her daughter that she never had with her own mom. On the other hand, she was also afraid that she would simply repeat the cycle of mother-daughter strife without realizing it. As it turns out, Tori didn’t have anything to be afraid of and the two seem to get along great.\n\nFamily Drama Made Public\n\nTori’s strained relationship with her mother got even more complicated when Candy published an open letter to Tori on her website. In the letter, Candy Spelling claimed that she had yet to meet her newest granddaughter, Stella, who was born in 2008. “I want to see you and your family – in private, like the 'normal family' you say you always wanted,” wrote Candy.\n\nTori fired back, saying that the claims that she was ignoring her mother were simply not true. According to Tori, Candy knows how to reach her and where she lives, and if she would love to see her grandchildren, she should really make an effort to reach out and see them. Obviously, we don’t know the whole story, but it sounds pretty complicated.\n\n“Stori” Time\n\nPublishing a memoir is a rite of passage for most celebrities. Tori Spelling joined the club with the publication of “Stori Telling” in 2008. In her first autobiography, Tori explains what it was like growing up with wealthy parents and how she navigated her teen years as a famous actress on “Beverly Hills, 90210.”\n\nIn “Stori Telling,” Tori also gets personal with discussions about her complicated relationship with her mother and her first marriage. Tori has always been the center of brutal tabloid speculation, so she took this debut memoir as an opportunity to set the record straight. Fans loved the book, quickly landing it on the New York Times Bestseller list. Not bad for a debut memoir if we say so ourselves.\n\nWest Beverly Class Reunion\n\nFans of the original “Beverly Hills, 90210” were ecstatic when the CW announced it was rebooting an updated version of the show in 2008. The show, simply titled “90210,” featured a whole new cast of characters to introduce the franchise to a whole new, younger generation. The brand new storyline didn’t mean that they completely abandoned the original show, though.\n\nTori Spelling made a guest appearance during the first season of “90210,” along with Jennie Garth, Shannen Doherty, and Joe E. Tata. Tori reprised her role as Donna Martin, and she was thrilled. She told People magazine that she couldn't be happier about returning to the zipcode she knows best.\n\n“Mommywood” Hits Bookshelves\n\nHot on the heels of her successful reality show “Tori and Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood,” Tori published her second memoir in 2009. Called “Mommywood,” this book features funny stories from Tori’s life as a Hollywood mom of two. The stories and anecdotes feature Tori’s famous wit and sense of humor, making it a fun read.\n\nAs always, Tori wasn’t afraid to tell her fans about the good, the bad, and the ugly parts of being a mom. Even though her life is entirely different than most of ours, there’s something about Tori that is totally relatable. She’s funny, self-deprecating, and snarky, which isn’t common when it comes to Hollywood.\n\nA Vow Refresh\n\nWho doesn’t love a wedding? Tori and Dean sure do! The two decided to renew their vows for their four-year anniversary. This time around, they had a more formal ceremony instead of eloping on a private island. The two planned a ceremony at a beautiful Beverly Hills residence where their closest family and friends gathered to help them celebrate their love.\n\nTori also got a jewelry refresh, with Dean gifting her a brand new Darkened Diamond Eternity Band by jewelry designer Neil Lane. This sweet renewal ceremony was a nice way to include family and friends who didn’t get to celebrate the couple’s union the first time around when they eloped in 2006.\n\nTori’s Third Child Is Born\n\nTori and Dean welcomed their third child in 2011. They named their daughter Hattie Margaret, but the whole birthing process was a bit of a surprise. With Hattie, Tori and her husband decided not to know the sex of their baby until it was born. When Hattie arrived, they were surprised she was a girl!\n\nApparently, Tori had a feeling that her third child would be a boy, but they were thrilled with Hattie’s arrival nonetheless. Since Hattie was born in October, Tori really leans into the spookiness and coziness of the season. She has thrown Hattie Halloween-themed birthday parties, which both of them love. Plus, Hattie has grown to love horror movies. Seeing her mom’s performance in “Scream 2” is probably a few years off, though.\n\nA Complicated Fourth Pregnancy\n\nIn 2012, Tori was pregnant with her fourth child. However, this pregnancy was quite harrowing for both Tori and her newborn son, Finn. After being hospitalized, Tori found out that she had placenta previa, which can cause serious complications. She was put on bed rest for the remainder of her pregnancy and experienced some scary moments throughout.\n\nThankfully, Finn was born safely, if a little early, via C-section. Tori had to get emergency surgery less than a month after Finn’s birth, which only added to the general stress of the whole situation. Despite Tori’s health scares, she fully recovered. At the time, Tori swore that Finn would be her last kid, but we now know that there would be at least one more kid in the future for Tori and Dean.\n\n“Spelling It Like It Is”\n\nEver since Tori published her first memoir, “Stori Telling,” fans have flocked to her funny and relatable essays about her life. She put her author cap back on in 2013 and published “Spelling It Like It Is.” She returned with a slew of new, fun essays about her life as a busy celebrity and mom just trying to make it through the day.\n\n“Spelling It Like It Is” tackled some serious topics, including her difficult pregnancy with Finn. Tori went into her feelings and experiences while pregnant with him, as well as the health scare that landed her in emergency surgery shortly after his birth. The book once again endeared Tori to her fans because her style of storytelling feels like chatting with a friend.\n\nThat Didn’t Age Well\n\nTori and Dean’s relationship has always been surrounded by rumors and speculation despite their best efforts to diffuse gossip. Many people have put their marriage under a microscope because of the nature of how they got together in the first place. As it turns out, not everyone thinks that marrying someone you were unfaithful with is a great idea.\n\nNevertheless, Tori and Dean remained strong going into 2013. Tori tried to diffuse rumors about possible marital woes by saying that it's sad that their actual happiness would probably be deemed boring. She praises him for standing by her during the good times and holding her hand through the darkest moments of her life. Those words would come back to haunt Tori a few months later.\n\nA Not So Merry Christmas\n\nThe holidays are supposed to be filled with family, friends, and good times. That was, unfortunately, not the case for Tori Spelling in December 2013. While celebrating the holidays with her kids, Tori and the rest of the world learned that her husband, Dean McDermott, had been unfaithful to her earlier that month.\n\nThe story goes that Dean met a woman named Emily Goodhand (yes, really) on December 6th during a press tour for his new show “Chopped Canada.” Ms. Goodhand almost immediately spilled the beans to “US Weekly,” who reported that the two were intimate the very same night that they met.\n\nThe Cheating Scandal Fallout\n\nOnce the press caught wind of Dean’s scandal, it was all anyone was talking about. In classic Hollywood fashion, Dean entered rehab, where he received treatment for unhealthy dependency on physical intimacy. Although Dean’s issues caused quite a stir, Tori was still willing to work things out for the sake of her four kids.\n\nA source close to Tori told “ People ” that Tori was absolutely against the idea of raising four young children on her own. The source further explained that she wants to be married to Dean, and she wants the whole sad issue to never have happened. But of course, that’s not the case. Thankfully, Dean was willing to work on their relationship, too. Along with Dean’s stint in rehab, the two started couples therapy.\n\nThe Court of Public Opinion\n\nAlthough Dean McDermott made moves to rectify his wayward ways, fans of Tori Spelling weren’t fully convinced by his efforts. The court of public opinion did not treat Dean kindly, especially among Tori’s fans. According to Emily Goodhand, Dean told her that there was no physical aspect to his marriage when he met her.\n\nGoodhand told “US Weekly” in an interview that she believed him. That may have been true, but Tori’s fans didn’t buy that as an excuse to do what he did. Keep in mind Tori had just experienced a grueling pregnancy and serious health scare a mere 14 months before Dean’s thing happened. She was going through it, and many fans thought Dean should have been at her side as she healed postpartum.\n\n“True Tori” Debuts\n\nAfter the cheating scandal broke, Tori and Dean decided to document their reconciliation process in a “Lifetime” reality show called “True Tori.” The show gets pretty candid, showing the couple attending therapy, having tough conversations, and facing Dean’s self-admitted mental health issues. When the show debuted in 2014, fans got a glimpse into what the aftermath was really like.\n\nDean fully admitted to two-timing Tori, and things got intense during their filmed therapy sessions. Dean admitted on-screen that he felt shame, which he'd never felt before. Fans learned that his transgression with Goodhand happened while she and the kids were at a Christmas event, which didn’t exactly endear him to Tori’s fans. Dean candidly admitted during an episode of the show that it was \"disgusting\".\n\nIt’s “Going to Take Time to Get Through”\n\nTori and Dean faced perhaps the most challenging chapter of their relationship in the aftermath of the cheating scandal. Outside of their reality show, “True Tori,” the couple kept pretty mum as they worked through their marital issues. Tori gave a few quotes to media outlets when they asked about her relationship with Dean, but she never got as raw and honest as she did on “True Tori.”\n\n“Life is always a work in progress, and our relationship is one as well, so we're moving in the right direction,” Tori told “ Good Morning America ” in June 2014. Both Tori and Dean put in the effort to repair their relationship for the sake of their kids. Thankfully, they worked things out and continued their relationship with therapy and open communication.\n\nTori and Jennie, Together Again\n\nAmidst the Dean's extramarital scandal publicity, Tori continued her entrepreneurial streak with a new TV show on “ABC Family.” The show, called “Mystery Girls,” starred Tori and her longtime friend and “90210” costar Jennie Garth. The family-friendly show follows detective show actresses who decide to become real-life investigators.\n\nThe Madcap sitcom only lasted one season, but Tori had a great time filming it. She and Jennie are friends in real life, so they were thrilled to work together again in a professional setting. Plus, “Mystery Girls” undoubtedly acted as a nice distraction from the stress of her marriage at the time.\n\nAn Intentional Scheduling Snafu?\n\nBy the time Tori and Dean’s new reality show, “Tori & Dean: Cabin Fever,” debuted in 2014, everyone already knew about their marital woes. “Cabin Fever” was filmed the summer before the happenings with Dean, and it follows their family as they head to Canada to live in a quaint cottage.\n\nInexplicably, this happy-go-lucky reality show aired right after the heartbreaking and emotional “True Tori” had finished its first season. Many speculated that Tori and Dean decided to air this pre-drama docu-series to get more views. People undoubtedly tuned in to see if they could detect cracks in their marriage since “Cabin Fever” was filmed only a few months before Emily Goodhand came on the scene.\n\nAn Unfortunate Run-In with a Grill\n\nAny Tori Spelling fan knows that drama seems to follow the star like moths to a flame. The drama continued for Tori in 2015 when she allegedly fell onto a hot hibachi grill at a Benihana restaurant in Encino, California. The accident happened on Easter Sunday when she went out to eat with her family.\n\nTori was rushed to the hospital for emergency skin grafts to treat second and third-degree burns on her arm. Skin burns are no joke, but Tori made a full recovery. After her emergency operation, Tori ended up suing Benihana over the injuries. The lawsuit was eventually resolved two years later.\n\nRelationship Stress Takes a Toll\n\nAs 2015 progressed, the stress of Tori’s marital woes, work schedule, and the filming of her “True Tori” reality show eventually caught up with her. She was hospitalized in late 2015 after coming down with severe pneumonia and bronchitis. Dean McDermott opened up about how the stress of his scandal took a toll on him, too.\n\nDean shared with “Entertainment Tonight” that he messed up but he is owning up to it, and getting help. But to label him as a monster or evil is very hurtful. Overall, it seemed that Dean didn’t appreciate what “True Tori” did for his reputation among Tori’s fans.\n\nHow Do You Spell “Lawsuit”?\n\nBy the time 2016 rolled around, it was no secret that Tori and Dean weren’t very good at budgeting. Both have pretty extravagant taste, which came back to bite them when a series of lawsuits were filed against them for back payments and defaulting on a loan.\n\nIn the same year, City National Bank and American Express filed lawsuits against the spend-happy couple. Apparently, Tori and Dean had stopped making payments on a $400,000 loan from the bank. In addition, they had a ​​$87,594 outstanding balance on their American Express credit card. Whoops. Tori is the first to admit that she’s horrible at saving her money, but that amount of debt is giving us major anxiety.\n\n“The Best Place It’s Ever Been”\n\nIn spite of all the financial stress that Tori and her husband experienced in 2016, the couple made a comeback in the romance department. Throughout the year, it seemed that they were falling in love all over again after moving through Dean’s scandal. They couldn’t stop gushing about each other in interviews.\n\nTori shared with “Entertainment Tonight” that in their relationship, they've definitely had to, not start over, but rebirth the relationship as something that was new and kind of moving on towards the future. Fans rejoiced over Tori’s happiness, especially after Dean shared that their relationship is in the best place it's ever been, in that same “ET” interview.\n\nBeau Is Born\n\nAfter experiencing a rocky patch in their marriage, Tori and Dean found out they were pregnant with their fifth child together. Beau Dean was born in 2017, and his birth was symbolic in a way their other children’s births weren’t. Tori told “ People ” that Beau was a symbol of a new phase in her marriage with Dean McDermott.\n\n“I feel like Beau is really the pillar of the rebirth of our relationship,” Tori said, “...he’s the first baby out of all five that we’re raising in a communicative way.” The couple was ecstatic to welcome their new baby home, mainly because they don’t plan on having any other kids in the future.\n\nThrowing Shade on “Drag Race”\n\nTori Spelling and bestie Jennie Garth let loose and had some fun when they joined “RuPaul’s Drag Race” as guest judges in 2017. One of the challenges was themed around “Beverly Hills, 90210” as a way to honor the two guests. In true queen fashion, Tori and Jennie decided to throw some shade at an old costar.\n\nContestant Aja dressed up as Tiffani Thiessen’s “90210” character, Valerie Malone. When it came time to provide Aja’s critique, Jennie was hesitant to say Tiffani’s name. Tori jumped in with, “Just say, 'That which we don't speak of.” Tori and Jennie had a notorious feud with Tiffani back in the day, and it seems that the animosity is still there to this day. All tea, all shade.\n\nThe Importance of Mental Health\n\n2018 was a tough year for Tori Spelling. Two instances in March of that year clued fans into the state of her mental wellness. On March 1, media outlets uncovered that a wellness check was conducted by the Los Angeles Police Department at Tori and Dean’s home. Apparently, Tori had called the police in the morning because she thought someone was breaking into her home. It just ended up being Dean.\n\nLater that month, Dean called the police again when Tori left the house with one of their kids. The cops located her at a doctor’s office. Everyone was fine, so it’s still unclear why Dean felt the need to call for help. Some fans speculated that Tori may have been dealing with anxiety, depression, or mental exhaustion.\n\nA Return to “Beverly Hills”\n\nReboots are a dime a dozen these days, and “Beverly Hills, 90210” was no different when it premiered in 2019. Or was it? Tori Spelling, along with her other former castmates, signed on to star in “BH90210,” a reboot of the original show from the 90s. The thing was, “BH” wasn’t any old reboot. It was a meta depiction of the original cast members playing themselves as they prepared to make a reboot of “Beverly Hills, 90210.”\n\nAre you confused? So were plenty of other people. In “BH90210,” the fictionalized version of Tori Spelling is trying to convince her other castmates-slash-friends to participate in the “Beverly Hills” reboot. The whole premise of the show was a bit too meta for viewers’ tastes. It was canceled after one season. Oh well.\n\nTori Co-Created “BH90210”\n\nDespite the “BH90210” reboot being a flop, plenty of diehard “90210” fans loved it. Some fans even petitioned Fox Network to renew the show for a second season but to no avail. Tori Spelling was undoubtedly happy to hear that many people liked the show because she was actually its co-creator.\n\nEven though she took after her late father and acted as a co-creator, her role in the 2019 reboot wasn’t as glitzy as some might think. Tori and her costars, including Shannen Doherty and Jennie Garth, only made about $70,000 per episode. While that’s certainly a lot of money, it’s not as much as other actors have made in other reboot shows.\n\nAn Awkward Interview\n\nIt’s common knowledge that you shouldn’t bring up money or religion in polite company. Reporter Rosanna Scotto apparently didn’t get that memo during an interview with Tori Spelling and Jennie Garth on “Good Day New York.” The two actresses appeared on the show to promote “BH90210,” and things got really awkward really fast.\n\nScotto steered the interview to focus on Tori’s financial problems, which Tori admitted to including in the “90210” reboot as a way to poke fun at herself and the constant rumors. Instead of talking about the new show, Scotto continued to press Tori about her personal finances, even asking her point-blank if she was able to pay her bills. A flabbergasted Tori handled the situation with grace, considering how inappropriate the line of questioning was.\n\nSome “90210” Nostalgia\n\nIn November 2020, as the world continued to shelter in place, Tori and her real-life bestie, Jennie Garth, took on the world of podcasting. The two former “Beverly Hills, 90210” stars decided to revisit their famous TV show in “9021OMG,” a rewatch podcast where they dish behind-the-scenes secrets and nostalgic perspectives about the show.\n\n“People got to see us on camera, but we were actually, you know, friends in real life behind the scenes. So, it’ll be cool to kind of merge those worlds and let [our fans] in on it,” Tori told US Weekly back in 2020. The podcast was an immediate hit, and it’s still going strong to this day.\n\nTori’s Many Nicknames\n\nOn her “9021OMG” podcast with former costar Jennie Garth, Tori dished some little-known facts that fans of the show had never heard before. On one episode of the podcast, Tori revealed a sweet memory of her costar, Luke Perry. While they were filming “Beverly Hills, 90210,” Perry began calling her “camel.”\n\nThis may seem like an insulting nickname on the surface, but Perry’s reasoning was actually very sweet. According to Tori, he came up with the nickname because camels have long, beautiful eyes and eyelashes, which reminded him of her, so she loves that name to this day. Perry passed away in 2019, but it’s obvious Tori still holds him dear in her heart.\n\nAn Unlikely “Messy” Pairing\n\nTori Spelling and Snooki of “Jersey Shore” fame are a celeb duo we didn’t know we needed. The two paired up along with figure skater Adam Rippon and the late comedian Teddy Ray to host the MTV show “Messyness” in 2021. The show, which has two seasons, involves the four celebs cold-reacting to viral internet videos of the most ridiculous order.\n\nFans of the two women were surprised to see them paired together and immediately wanted to know how they got along. Unfortunately for gossipmongers, there was no tea to spill. Snooki and Tori got along splendidly. Snooki gushed over working with Tori, calling her “iconic.” Tori returned the love by saying Snooki is smart, funny, and humble.\n\nTrouble in Paradise?\n\nNo one has forgotten Tori and Dean’s very tumultuous, very public rough patch back in 2013 and 2014. Naturally, fans like to keep tabs on their relationship to see if things are on the rocks again. Tori gave fans a clue into the status of her marriage when she was a guest on SiriusXM’s “Jeff Lewis Live.”\n\nDuring the interview, she reluctantly admitted that she shares her bed with her kids and dogs. Still pressing, Jeff Lewis asked if Dean was in a guest room, to which Tori coyly responded that he was in a room. You’re not quelling any rumors with an answer like that, Tori!\n\nA Dean-less Holiday\n\nTori Spelling continued to fan the flames regarding the rumors surrounding her marriage with Dean McDermott when she released her family’s 2021 holiday card. “With love, from our farm to your home!” the holiday card reads. The card featured Tori wearing an off-the-shoulder mini-dress with leather cowgirl boots.\n\nTori looks moisturized and unbothered in the photo, holding a chicken and surrounded by her five amazing kids. But guess who’s not in the photo? Yup. Dean McDermott is noticeably absent from the family portrait. There’s such a thing as camera timers, so there’s no way he was behind the camera in this case. Tori didn’t make any comment about his absence, which intensified rumors of a split.\n\nDid Tori Go Under the Knife?\n\nAmidst the many rumors that constantly seem to be swirling around Tori is the pesky speculation about whether or not she’s had plastic surgery and other work done. Tori claims that people have always been critical of her appearance, and the plastic surgery speculation began when she was just 17.\n\nTori openly admits to getting breast implants in her early 20s and a nose job, but she denies getting any other plastic surgery procedures. Tori complained in an interview that she constantly reads false news items about having done more. While it’s possible that Tori has gotten fillers, Botox, and chemical peels over the years, it’s really none of our business.\n\nTori Spelling, a Real Housewife?\n\nIt’s no secret that Tori Spelling loves reality TV. Not only has she starred in her fair share of reality series, but she’s also an avid consumer of a ton of hit shows. One of her favorite reality series is the “Real Housewives” franchise. She loves the many iterations of the show so much, in fact, that she once had aspirations to be featured on the “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” series.\n\nShe claims that she always heard rumors of the show possibly reaching out to her to join the cast, but no one ever contacted her agent. She didn’t mind that much until her friend Jennie Garth was apparently invited to join one year. Probably feeling more than a little jealous, Tori asked Andy Cohen about it.\n\nA Passive Aggressive Confrontation\n\nMore than a little miffed at being ignored for “The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,” Tori eventually confronted Andy Cohen on “What What Happens Live.” Andy was able to avoid the question by making some kind of non-answer, but Tori was still bummed that she had never been asked.\n\nTori, for one, is confused by the lack of interest from “RHOBH.” She told Bethenny Frankel on her show that she was friends with every single person in the cast. There’s no denying that Tori’s penchant for drama would make her a pretty entertaining housewife on the show. Fans agree, constantly commenting that they would definitely tune in if Tori joined the show.\n\nTori’s Return to Reality\n\nAlthough Tori’s dreams of becoming a “Real Housewife” haven’t come true, she’s still maintained her reality TV show presence. In 2022, Tori and her team premiered a 10-part series called @Home with Tori, which features the life and times of Tori and her five kids. The show is cute and comforting and shows a slice of Tori’s life that fans don’t often get to see.\n\nDuring the course of the show, Tori does plenty of cooking and crafting, which are two of her favorite passions. She also hosts birthday parties and girls' nights at her home for her kids and celebrity friends. The show really lets Tori’s fun and goofy personality shine through, which is why fans love it so much.\n\nCracks Underneath the Surface\n\nAs the months and years progressed, more fans and tabloids began to doubt Tori and Dean’s insistence that everything was okay in their marriage. In late 2022, a source came out and told “ People ” that Tori and Dean were definitely on the rocks again. According to this anonymous source, Tori was still dealing with trust issues after Dean’s 2014 infidelity, and they were spending a lot of time apart.\n\nMore rumors started to swirl that the only reason Tori and Dean were still together was for the sake of their kids. With the kids being in their fundamental years, it's important for Tori that they have their dad. Whatever the truth is behind the rumors, it sounds stressful and emotional.\n\nMTV Calls Again\n\nIn September 2022, Tori Spelling revealed that she was coming back to MTV as the host of the network’s new show, “Love at First Lie.” The mystery dating show involves a group of couples who have to figure out which of their competitors are actually dating and which couples are faking it.\n\nWhen MTV approached Tori to host the show, she was all about it. Tori is a huge self-proclaimed fan of reality dating shows, so the concept of “Love at First Lie” intrigued her. The first season of the show aired in late 2022, but there’s no news of a second season as of yet.\n\nTori and Candy, Together Again\n\nTori made another attempt to mend fences with her mom in September 2022 when she attended Candy’s 77th birthday celebration. Family friend Josh Flagg helped arrange a birthday dinner for Candy and made sure Tori felt comfortable attending. According to Tori, her relationship with her mother had been going well for a while.\n\nThankfully, Candy’s birthday dinner made their relationship even better. Spending time with her mother made Tori reflect on the importance of family, regardless of how difficult those relationships can sometimes be. Time flies, and it’s better to mend fences and make an effort in a relationship instead of ignoring conflict.\n\nA Heartfelt Birthday Tribute\n\nIt’s every parent’s rite of passage to post a gushing tribute to their kid on social media for their birthday. Tori joined the club when she made a heartfelt post in honor of her oldest son’s 16th birthday. Liam celebrated his 16th birthday in March 2023, and Tori couldn’t help but share how proud she was of him with the world and her Instagram followers.\n\nShe wrote in her caption that she has to stand on her tippy toes to hug him. But, he'll forever be her baby. It seems like only yesterday that Liam was the cute blonde kid running around on-camera for Tori and Dean’s reality show. Tori’s love for her kids has always been a bright spot in her life, and fans celebrated right alongside her by leaving their own well wishes and comments on Tori’s sweet post.\n\nRandy Spelling Makes an Appearance\n\nIn addition to patching things up with her mom, it seems that Tori is making efforts to establish a better relationship with her brother as well. Tori took to Instagram to share photos of a family trip to Universal Studios, and Randy was featured in the very first image of her post.\n\nShe shouted out Randy’s Instagram account in her caption and mentioned that Randy’s two daughters came along, too. Fans were thrilled to see Tori and her brother spending time together, commenting positive words of support and love. It took many years, but it seems that the Spelling family has been able to patch things up for the better.\n\nFrom Mansion to Mold\n\nIt seems there’s never a dull moment in the life of Tori Spelling. In May 2023, Tori shared with her fans that she and her family had to evacuate their rental home in Los Angeles after an extreme mold problem was discovered within their walls. According to Tori, her family had been experiencing a “spiral of sickness” for years before the discovery was made.\n\nShe took to Instagram to share her plight, even going so far as to ask her fans for lawyer references, implying that she might want to take legal action against her landlord. Household mold is no joke, so Tori was undoubtedly relieved to get her kids out of danger.\n\nOn the Rocks\n\nTori Spelling and her husband, Dean McDermott, have always had somewhat of a rocky relationship. Many people were not surprised when the couple officially announced that they were separating for good in June 2023. However, the way they went about announcing the news was kind of odd. In a now-deleted Instagram post, Dean announced his impending divorce and tagged Tori’s own account in the caption.\n\nAnnouncing a divorce on social media and then deleting said post raised some eyebrows, but it seems that Dean was completely serious. Tori was seen leaving a motel with her five kids one morning while Dean was photographed moving his stuff into storage.\n\nAn Amicable Split\n\nTori and Dean have had very public feuds, fights, and tiffs, but they are keeping things professional with their most recent divorce announcement. Sources close to the couple say that they are being as amicable as possible with each other for the sake of their kids.\n\nIn his now-deleted Instagram post that served as a divorce announcement, Dean said that they will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love their children through this difficult time. It’s always sad when a well-known couple splits up. However, if the tabloid rumors are true, their relationship has been on the rocks for a while. Being respectful toward each other seems like the best course of action for these two former lovebirds.\n\nFrom Mansion to Motel\n\nIt seems that every time Tori and Dean’s relationship is back in the news, so are reports of Tori’s finances. After Dean’s mysterious divorce announcement, Tori and her five kids have been spotted hanging out around $100-a-night motels and RV parks. Seeing Tori out and about at these locations has prompted fans to wonder if Tori is doing okay financially.\n\nAfter being forced out of her rental home due to a mold infestation, it seems like Tori doesn’t have the money to afford another house or a more private place for her and her kids to stay. Rumors started to swirl that Candy Spelling had refused to help her daughter this time, but they seemed unfounded. In fact, some reports say Tori refused help from her wealthy mom. It remains to be seen what the future holds for Tori.\n\nLove, Loss, and the Future\n\nTori Spelling is a celebrity who has experienced love, loss, and success while growing up in the limelight. Despite the many challenges she has faced in her life, she continues to be a resilient light to fans all over the world. From growing up in “The Manor” to forging her own path in reality TV, Tori is a mainstay in Hollywood who can’t be ignored.\n\nDespite the ups and downs in her personal life, Tori continues to make waves as a businesswoman. Her deals with QVC, MTV, and other media outlets prove that Tori is here to stay. With every new era of her career, there’s no denying that she’ll come out on top."
