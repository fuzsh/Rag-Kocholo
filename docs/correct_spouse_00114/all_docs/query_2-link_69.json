        "text": "For well over a decade now, Tori Spelling has been married to fellow actor Dean McDermott, with whom she shares five children. The two have had their fair share of ups and downs over the years but, through it all, they remained together. Sadly, it would appear that their marriage is now coming to an end. Spelling and McDermott have decided to formally divorce after 18 years of marriage. The latter star confirmed the news himself via social media, releasing an emotional statement in which he discussed the situation.\n\n56-year-old Dean McDermott revealed his impending split from his wife in a post shared to Instagram early Saturday morning. Said update included two photos: one of the two actors together and another snapshot of them with their brood. While McDermott didn’t get too specific about what motivated the decision to divorce, he did state in his caption that he and his soon-to-be ex-wife are looking to move forward with their lives and family. He also asked a request of his fans during this time of transition:\n\nTori Spelling tied the knot with the Due South alum in Fiji less than a month after her divorce from writer and actor Charlie Shanian was finalized. As mentioned, their union spawned five children: sons Liam (16), Finn 10 and Beau (6) as well as daughters Stella (15) and Hattie (11). Their fifth and final child was born in 2017 following an excitement-fueled pregnancy announcement from Spelling in 2016. The past several years have seen the actress and her estranged hubby appear with their kids at public events together. The 50-year-old Spelling posted about their appearance at the StandUp for Kids gala earlier this week. And just the other day, the group traveled to the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where they celebrated Stella’s birthday.\n\nThe celebrity couple found themselves making headlines on more than one occasion amid their time together, with some moments being less flattering than others. For example they drew a lot of attention in 2011 after Dean McDermott mistakenly tweeted a photo of his wife topless. Things took a more serious turn in 2018, though, after cops were called on the Beverly Hills, 90210 star during a reported mental breakdown. They also found themselves embroiled in drama with McDemott’s ex-wife shortly after he’d launched a podcast with her. Nevertheless, they continued to be candid about their lives, even revealing some of their role-playing activities in the bedroom.\n\nOne of the most notable developments from their marriage occurred in 2013 amid Tori Spelling’s pregnancy with their second child. It was reported, at the time, that Dean McDermott had been unfaithful to his wife. Ultimately, they managed to work through their issues but, by 2021, rumors began swirling that their romance was on the rocks. That speculation came around the time that Spelling was spotted without her wedding ring. Sources later claimed in the summer of 2022 that they were in the midst of a trial separation.\n\nDivorces are rarely easy, for the two people that are splitting or the children they have. Based on Dean McDermott’s statement, you get the idea that the decision was mutual and possibly reached amicably. Should that be true, it could make the eventual legal proceedings easier on everyone involved. We wish McDermott, Tori Spelling and their kids the best as they navigate this period in their lives."
