        "text": "Desperately seeking closure, Tori Spelling planned to meet the ex-husband she had cruelly abandoned years ago for Dean McDermott.\n\nAnd Spelling’s surprising decision to contact Charlie Shanian came as second husband Dean McDermott pondered getting a vasectomy -- after Spelling flatly said she didn’t want any more children with him in the aftermath of his cheating scandal.\n\nThat’s what viewers of Lifetime’s True Tori saw on Tuesday night’s episode, as memories of the past came back to haunt Spelling.\n\nThe former Beverly Hills 90210 star left playwright Shanian after cheating on him with McDermott, who was also married. Eventually, Spelling and McDermott divorced their spouses, got married and had four kids.\n\nBut McDermott, 47, betrayed Spelling, 41, by having a two-day affair with Emily Goodhand in 2013 while shooting his show Chopped Canada in Toronto. Since then, he and Spelling have stayed together, gutting it out through the toughest of times.\n\nSpelling, who wanted to make money by selling her old items, had trouble letting go of the baggage related to her first marriage.\n\nAfter looking at her old wedding bouquet and a painting Shanian had given her, she remarked, “seeing these things in storage reminds me of how I ended that relationship and it weighs on me every day, the regrets of how I handled it.”\n\nSpelling and McDermott attended couples therapy with Dr. Ann Wexler, where the star told the doctor that she wasn’t pregnant as they earlier suspected. A relieved Spelling told her that they’d talked about McDermott having a vasectomy.\n\n“It’s entirely because he cheated on me,” Spelling said. “Because of what I went through, I know that I don’t want any more babies with him.”\n\nAt that, McDermott looked shattered, and both he and Spelling then got teary-eyed.\n\n“There’s consequences to actions,” Spelling finally explained in therapy. “I felt the need to say it but now that I’ve said it I feel bad about the way I said it.”\n\nLater, McDermott expressed second thoughts about the vasectomy idea.\n\nSpelling told her husband, “You broke that trust. A year ago, you were more set on doing the vasectomy and now I’m more set on doing it and you’re sad about it.\n\n“It’s a role reversal.”\n\nSpelling told the cameras that a fifth baby would be too much stress so she wanted McDermott to get ahead with the operation.\n\nLater, in a visit to urologist Dr. Werthman, a worried McDermott asked if a vasectomy would affect his testosterone production. The answer was no, so the actor decided to do it.\n\n“I’d be scared,” McDermott admitted.\n\n“Scared that I’d go back to him?” Spelling asked.\n\n“You’ve told me what a great guy he is, very nurturing and caring and I know I’m not the greatest at it,” he replied.\n\nMcDermott told the cameras, “I’m just afraid she’s going to go and see Charlie and remember how great that was and go, ‘Gosh, what did I do?’”\n\nDespite McDermott’s misgivings, Spelling decided to contact Shanian via email. He agreed to see her but on the day of the meeting, Spelling wound up sick with a migraine and canceled.\n\nThey rescheduled the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, McDermott dragged his feet on the vasectomy, especially about doing it on camera.\n\n“It’s my reproductive organs,” he complained, and added about another reality star, “I don’t want to be like Spencer Pratt. Does the world really need to see this?”\n\nAdding to his angst, Spelling said she had changed her mind a little bit about having more children.\n\nSpelling also confided in friend Courtney that she was on the pill.\n\nHowever, McDermott indicated their oldest daughter, now 6, wasn’t planned. “We had Stella on birth control,” he said.\n\nMcDermott then broke down over his vasectomy decision, shouting, “This is crazy, no cameras, please, go!”\n\n“I’m not going to do it,” he finally told Spelling, citing how they connected through having kids.\n\nViewers also saw Spelling have a meltdown describing to McDermott how she felt about seeing her items in storage, which evoked memories of being the daughter of the late TV mogul Aaron Spelling."
