        "text": "Live from her podcast, it’s Tori Spelling’s divorce.\n\nThe Beverly Hills, 90210 star let listeners of her podcastMisspelling in on her phone call to estranged husband Dean McDermott to let him know she had filed for divorce.\n\nSpelling, 50, fretted about the conversation before chatting with McDermott, saying, “Oh, s**t. He’s at work right now. This sucks.”\n\nThe actress acknowledged this when they spoke and admitted she “hate[d] to do this to” McDermott, 57, while he was “in the middle of going to work and everything.”\n\nShe then announced, “They’ve done it. It’s the formality. It’s just the one sheet you check off, and next you’ll have to sign it.”\n\nSpelling, who did not air McDermott’s side of the call in Sunday’s episode, subsequently asked whether he had a lawyer.\n\n“Wait, it’s gonna be spun what way? That I’ve had enough of you? What? What do you mean?” she asked before arguing with the actor about who had the right to file first.\n\n“In all honesty after this whole journey, if it’s about … who files first, the other person is wrong, I feel like I deserve to file first then,” she said. “You basically put it out there with Daily Mail and said everything you’ve done to me over the years, so I think it makes perfect sense that it followed up that I would file.”\n\nSpelling concluded the call with, “Love you.”\n\nThe former reality star cried after hanging up, telling her team that she had “never felt more alone in 50 years” and did not “feel worth loving” while “in a room full of friends doing a podcast.”\n\nShe gave insight into McDermott’s side of the talk, claiming he told her that the news was “great” and “good.”\n\n“[He said], ‘I have a lawyer. I was gonna do this, but cool, yeah, saves me $500,’” Spelling shared.\n\nThe emotional taping aired two days after her filing made headlines — and nine months after McDermott first revealed their split in an Instagram statement.\n\nThe “Due South” star, who has moved on with Lily Calo, previously spoke out about their break-up and his addiction battle in May.\n\nSpelling touched on his “red flags” on Misspelling, as well as admitting she “should have left [the marriage] sooner.”\n\nShe and McDermott met in 2005 while married to Charlie Shanian and Mary Jo Eustace, respectively. They wed the following year and are the parents of Liam, 17, Stella, 15, Hattie, 12, Finn, 11, and Beau, 7."
