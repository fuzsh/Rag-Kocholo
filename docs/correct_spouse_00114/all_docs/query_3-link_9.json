When the pair met in 2005, McDermott was married to Mary Jo Eustace, with whom he shares son Jack, and Spelling was married to Charlie Shanian. “It was love at first sight. I fell so hard … Then I noticed he had a wedding ring. And — oh, yeah — I had a husband too,” Spelling wrote in her 2009 memoir, sTORI Telling, revealing she and McDermott spent the night together at a hotel. “The following day when I woke up next to Dean, I had no regrets.\" The duo tied the knot less than a year after they met and went on to welcome five children: son Liam in 2007, daughter Stella in 2008, daughter Hattie in 2011, son Finn in 2013 and son Beau in 2017. As their family grew, however, so did the drama. Scroll through for a timeline of Spelling and McDermott’s ups and downs:\n\nCredit: Gregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\nJuly 2005\n\nSpelling and McDermott, who were both married to other people, met on the set of a made-for-TV movie in Ottawa, Canada. The Scary Movie 2 star detailed telling her first husband about her affair with McDermott in her 2009 book, sTORI Telling.\n\n“I told him that I’d never been in love with him. I loved him and he’d been a friend to me, but I married him because he was a great guy, a guy who took care of me. Charlie didn’t want to hear it,” Spelling wrote. “He kept saying, ‘Where’s all this coming from? We have a perfect relationship.’ Then he turned to me. ‘Did you cheat on me?’ I said yes. He said, ‘It was with Dean, wasn’t it?’ I said yes. He said, ‘I should have known.’”\n\nCredit: Clark Samuels/startraksphoto.com\n\nMarch 2007\n\nFollowing Aaron’s death, reports surfaced that Tori and her brother, Randy, only inherited $800,000 each of their late father’s fortune. As a result, rumors of a feud between Tori and her mother, Candy, ran rampant.\n\nWhile the Spelling family drama made headlines, the newlyweds started a family of their own. Tori and McDermott welcomed their first child, a baby boy named Liam, in March.\n\nCredit: Ron Wolfson/Wireimage\n\nMay 2009\n\nTori’s relationship with her mother hit another low point in 2009 after Candy blamed her daughter — and her relationship with McDermott — for Aaron’s death during a radio interview.\n\nShe clarified her comments, but maintained that Tori’s estrangement from her dad affected him negatively. ”I didn't intend to create headlines. I was asked a question about my daughter not speaking with my family, and I answered truthfully,” Candy told HuffPost in a statement at the time. ”My husband was very ill, and he had stopped eating and taking liquids. He called Tori on a daily basis, and never stopped asking if Tori had returned his call. We had to say no every day.”\n\nCredit: Albert Michael/startraksphoto.com\n\nApril 2010\n\nSpelling and McDermott fought back against split rumors after footage from their reality series showed them feuding. \"I just want the old Dean back. I really do. I miss you so much,” Spelling said on an episode of Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood.\n\nA month after declaring they were “committed to each other” on the Today show, the couple renewed their vows.\n\n\"This is a rebirth,\" Spelling told Us exclusively at the time. ”We've gone through our ups and downs, but we wouldn't have changed a moment of it.\"\n\nCredit: Michael Simon/startraksphoto.com\n\nAugust 2012\n\nAfter an unexpected fourth pregnancy — just five months after welcoming Hattie — Spelling was diagnosed with a severe form of placenta previa and suffered massive bleeds throughout her pregnancy. Following four months of strict bed rest in the hospital, Spelling gave birth to son Finn.\n\n\"It was surreal. I just remember thinking, I can't leave three children behind,” the actress told Us in October 2012. \"I kept envisioning myself holding a healthy baby. That was my goal.”\n\nShe added: \"When they put him in my arms I was like, 'We made it. We did.' Now we have an insane bond. We've been through hell and back.\"\n\nCredit: TLC\n\nApril 2014\n\nSpelling coped with McDermott’s affair by documenting their struggles on a Lifetime docuseries, True Tori. \"I can never give him enough sex!\" Spelling yelled in one of their onscreen couples therapy sessions. ”He's never gonna be happy with just me.\"\n\nMcDermott, for his part, suffered an onscreen breakdown on True Tori. “I just thought, 'This is it. You can't get out of this. I blew it. Everything great in my life, I s–t on.' I just thought, 'Tori deserves me to die,’” he said during an April episode. He later checked into treatment.\n\nCredit: Vince Flores/startraksphoto.com\n\nOctober 2017\n\nFollowing her high-risk pregnancy with Finn, Spelling shocked fans by announcing she was pregnant with her fifth child in October 2016. The Mystery Girls star welcomed a healthy baby boy named Beau in March 2017.\n\nSpelling later referred to the twosome’s third son as the “rebirth” of their marriage.\n\n“We know how to do it differently now,” she said one year later. “For so many years, we kind of didn’t know how to find time for ourselves, it was all about the kids, because we did start having kids right away.”\n\nCredit: Noel Vasquez/Getty Images\n\nMarch 2018\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department confirmed to Us that they responded to a 911 call about a verbal dispute at Spelling’s house on March 1. They did not confirm if the argument was between Spelling and McDermott. An insider told Us at the time that the Mistle-Tones star’s family and friends were “very, very worried” that Spelling was on the cusp of a breakdown.\n\nMcDermott’s ex-wife, meanwhile, told Us that same month that Spelling was paying her husband’s alimony payments.\n\n“[Tori] stepped up, and I accepted that. So that, sort of, our relationship took a turn there as well because she was owning up to it and taking responsibility for it, which was good,” Mary Jo Eustace told Us at the time. After Spelling missed a couple of payments, according to Eustace, the Masked Singer star told the Divorce Sucks author that she had been suffering from migraines.\n\n“She said, ‘I’ve been consistent, and I can’t go through it again, and I just haven’t been well, and I just want to take care of this right away,’” Eustace explained. “And I said, ‘OK.”’\n\nCredit: Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nJanuary 2019\n\nSpelling and McDermott’s only issue in 2019? Instagram trolls. The Slasher actor has defended his wife’s social media activity several times. In January of that year, McDermott clapped back at a hater who body-shamed his kids. Two months later, the former Chopped Canada host stood up for Spelling after users criticized her post about feeding their children muffins for a snack.\n\nAfter Spelling shared a photo with her BH90210 costars Jennie Garth and Gabrielle Carteris in bathing suits on location for the Beverly Hills, 90210 quasi-revival in June 2019, McDermott swooped in again.\n\n“I love how you haters have private accts!!” he fired back at the time. “Let’s see what you trolls look like ya cowards!!!”\n\nCredit:\n\nNovember 2019\n\nMcDermott reflected on the couple overcoming his past indiscretion during an exclusive interview with Us. “I thought that Tori was just going to run for the hills, and I could totally understand why,” he told Us. “But she was like, ‘I just can’t turn off the love for you. I love you. You hurt me. I’m angry, but I love you. I can’t turn that off.’”\n\nCredit: Scott Kirkland/Fox/Picturegroup/Shutterstock\n\nMay 2020\n\nThe couple celebrated 14 years of marriage in 2020. “My partner in crime and my best friend. You are an amazing papa bear and I love that you always have my back no matter what!” Spelling gushed via Instagram. “Thank you for loving me and I promise I am still fun! Life just gets stressful sometimes but thru it all we have each other. One day we will get back to Fiji where we became husband and wife and started our journey of a lifetime. I love you with all my heart and soul. Always Your TT Girl xoxo #anniversary #14years #soulmate #happyaniversary❤️”\n\nCredit: GAC/MEGA; MEGA\n\nJune 2021\n\nThe “9021OMG” podcast host addressed speculation about her marriage for the first time when pal Jeff Lewis inquired about Spelling wearing her wedding ring again.\n\n“What is really going on? You put the wedding ring on. Are things OK?” he asked on SiriusXM’s Jeff Lewis Live. “Because I feel like the last time you were here things were good, you were having sex. Are you guys sleeping in the same bed?”\n\nSpelling revealed that her “kids and dogs sleep in my bed,” adding that McDermott is “in a room” at their home. “Since he left — this is not good, you guys — but since he left [and] he was gone for six months filming in another country, they all stayed with me,” she explained. “So I currently still have four in the bedroom with me who have yet to go back to their rooms, yes.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Lifetime\n\nJune 2021\n\n“Tori and Dean have been having major issues for over a year now,\" a source told Us exclusively. \"The fact that she’s talking about sleeping in separate beds is very telling. She wouldn’t do that unless things were really not great between them. Tori knows her kids see what she says online, so for her to say something publicly means the end could be very near.\"\n\nCredit: The Wendy Williams Show/YouTube\n\nSeptember 2021\n\nAs speculation about their relationship status continued to spread, McDermott seemingly shut down the divorce rumors during an episode of the \"Feminine Warrior\" podcast. \"It's just like, 'OK, if that's what you want to think, then think it,'\" he said at the time.\n\nThe following month, Spelling refused to answer a question about her marriage during an appearance on The Wendy Williams Show as an insider told Us the actress wanted to pull the plug but felt \"trapped.\"\n\nCredit: Chelsea Lauren/Shutterstock\n\nNovember 2021\n\nSpelling raised eyebrows when she posted a family holiday card that showed her and her children posing without McDermott. “With Love, from our farm to your home! Xoxo, Tori & Family,” the card’s signature read. In a second photo, the actress hung personalized stockings on her mantle, but there was notably no stocking for her husband.\n\n\"Fact: @imdeanmcdermott was filming his new feature film in Canada,\" she wrote via Instagram in response to a follower who asked where her spouse was during the card photo shoot. McDermott, meanwhile, was photographed seemingly getting into a fist fight while playing hockey in Los Angeles.\n\nCredit: Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency/MEGA; Mediapunch/Shutterstock\n\nJune 2022\n\nAn insider told Us that the couple's friends were told that McDermott and Spelling are “going through with a trial separation.” A second source, meanwhile, claimed that the duo decided to press pause on divorce because it's an \"expensive\" process. \"They both feel trapped,\" the second insider explained. \"Having kids makes it more difficult because they don't want their children to be unhappy, yet at the same time Tori has been unhappy for quite a while now. They truly are still together for their kids.\"\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nJune 2023\n\nLess than one week after the pair stepped out at the Stand for Kids gala in Los Angeles, McDermott announced that they were getting a divorce.\n\n“It’s with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways and start a new journey of our own,” he wrote via Instagram early on June 17. “We will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time. We ask that you all respect our privacy as we take this time to surround our family with love and work our way through this. Thank you all for your support and kindness. 🙏.”\n\nSeveral hours later, McDermott deleted the post. A source exclusively told Us at the time that the pair “are not getting a divorce” and “have been better than ever.”\n\n“They’ve had their ups and downs like any couple, but [they] have continued working on their marriage through couple’s counseling,” the insider said. “They love each other and are not going to split.”\n\nCredit: Frank Trapper/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nNovember 2023\n\nMcDermott spoke out about his split from Spelling for the first time during a lengthy interview with the Daily Mail. He revealed that he hadn’t seen his estranged wife or their children since June 2023 but was in contact with Spelling.\n\nThe actor also opened up about how his alcoholism had affected his family and revealed he’d completed a 40-day stint in rehab over the summer.\n\n“Alcohol made me feel good enough. I started feeling good enough until it got to a point where it didn’t — it ended up in isolation,” McDermott said, noting that his drunken moods “petrified” his family. “It ended up with me drinking a fifth of tequila every night, seven days a week, and a handful of [pills] by myself with a beautiful family in the other room. That’s what it led to and that’s what led to the brokenness and to what happened between me and Tori.”\n\nMcDermott added that not sleeping in the same bed as Spelling for years had contributed to the breakdown of their relationship.\n\n“It’s like docking your iPhone at night. If you don’t dock your iPhone at night, you wake up with a dead battery. I believe that the marital bed is the docking station for your relationship,” he said. “It’s where you download information. It’s where you spend time together. It’s where you’re intimate, it’s where you love. You laugh and you cry. So, [if] that’s gone, the relationship suffers greatly.”"
