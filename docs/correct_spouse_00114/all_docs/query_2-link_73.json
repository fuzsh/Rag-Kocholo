        "text": "Tori Spelling’s first marriage will be officially over next week, clearing the way for her to marry fiance Dean McDermott, according to a report.\n\nIn court documents obtained Tuesday by syndicated TV news magazine “Entertainment Tonight”, a Superior Court commissioner stated that Spelling’s marriage to actor Charlie Shanian will be dissolved on April 20.\n\nShanian filed for the divorce in October, a little more than a year after marrying the former “Beverly Hills, 90210” star. He cited dissolution of marriage.\n\nSpelling and McDermott became engaged in December. The two met last year while working on the TV movie “Mind Over Murder.”\n\nSpelling, who is the daughter of producer Aaron Spelling, is starring as a fictionalized version of herself in VH1’s “so noTORIous.”"
