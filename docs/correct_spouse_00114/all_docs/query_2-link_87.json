        "text": "In the latest episode of “True Tori,” Tori Spelling met with her ex-husband, Charlie Shanian, whom she cheated on with current husband Dean McDermott, and she just sobbed and sobbed about it.\n\nTuesday's episode, “Tale of Two Husbands,” highlighted Tori's anxiety about seeing her ex for the first time since 2005.\n\nShanian declined to have his meeting with Spelling recorded, but she was clearly emotional after their two-hour conversation.\n\nTori started crying while driving home, “He told me how he felt. It made me feel sad that he had to come to grips with what I said... He's a good man.”\n\n[photo: Getty]\n\nAt home, she continued crying, telling Dean, “It felt like family, safe, nurtured by and then it felt like a loss. I remember how safe I felt with him. When I left, I just suddenly felt really alone and I don't know why.”"
