As news of Tori Spelling divorce from Dean makes headlines, fans have been wondering what truly led to the demise of their marriage.\n\nThe beginning of Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott relationship\n\nVictoria Davey Spelling, better known as Tori Spelling, is an American actress, TV personality, and author. On the other hand, Dean McDermott is a Canadian actor well-known for his reality TV appearances with Tori Spelling and as the host of Chopped Canada.\n\nThe two met in Ottawa, Canada, while filming Mind Over Murder. At that time, Tori Spelling's ex-husband, Charlie Shanian, was still in the picture. McDermott was also married to Mary Jo Eustace.\n\nShortly after Spelling's divorce from Shanian and McDermott's separation from Eustace, they married in a private ceremony in Fiji on May 7, 2006.\n\nIn May 2010, Spelling and McDermott renewed their vows at a private home in Beverly Hills. McDermott marked the occasion by gifting Spelling a custom Darkened Diamond Eternity Band by Neil Lane.\n\nTori Spelling and Dean McDermott marriage timeline\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child in March 2007, shortly before debuting their first reality Television show, Tori & Dean: Inn Love.‚Äù\n\nFollowing two successful seasons of Tori and Dean: Inn Love, Spelling and McDermott's reality show returned for a third season on Oxygen under the new title Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood.\n\nHowever, rumors that the couple was having trouble started spreading in 2013. Dean McDermott's spouse, Spelling, refuted the claims.\n\n\"It's just sad that our actual happiness would probably be deemed boring. I can handle [media scrutiny.] I always have. But don't do it to a man that has done nothing but loved me and our children.\" she said.\n\nBut, by the end of 2013, McDermott's infidelity came to light, marking a significant downturn in their relationship.\n\nDean admits to cheating on Tori\n\nIn 2014, Dean McDermott admitted publicly to having an affair.

Here, Dean claimed that he felt ashamed and disgusted by his behavior.\n\nIn one of the episodes of True Tori, she claimed that she was aware of her inability to satisfy McDermott sexually.\n\nMeanwhile, McDermott had an emotional breakdown on the show, admitting,\n\n\"I thought, 'This is it. There's no way out. I ruined everything good in my life.'

She added that she only shared her bed with her kids and dogs.\n\nThe same year, Spelling attracted attention when she was seen without her wedding band during a public appearance. This also prompted fans to observe that she and McDermott did not publicly recognize their 15th anniversary in May.\n\nLetting the cat out of the bag\n\nThere were significant trust issues for Spelling following McDermott's infidelity, and their relationship never fully recovered from it. McDermott's ongoing battles with sobriety also posed a continuous challenge for the couple throughout the years.\n\nThe couple did not announce their separation until June 2023, when Dean posted on Instagram.\n\n\"It's with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and five amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways and start a new journey of our own,\" part of the caption said.\n\nMcDermott addressed his celebrity life and separation from Spelling publicly for the first time in a detailed interview with the Daily Mail. He disclosed that he had not been in physical contact with his estranged wife or their children since June 2023 but emphasized ongoing communication with Spelling.\n\nMcDermott mentioned that the decision to sleep separately from Spelling over the years had played a role in the deterioration of their relationship.\n\nBy the end of 2023, both seemed to have moved on and started new relationships. McDermott is now dating Lily Calo, while Spelling was seen sharing kisses with Ryan Cramer, the CEO of Neuron Syndicate Inc.,\n\nTori Spelling files for divorce\n\nSpelling filed for divorce nine months after McDermott made their breakup public on social media. Court documents reveal that Spelling listed \"irreconcilable differences\" as the explanation for their separation. In addition to asking for joint legal custody of their five children, she also seeks spousal support and sole physical custody.\n\nTori decided to officially file for divorce around the same time she launched her podcast, misSpelling.
