        "text": "For the past 18 years, Tori Spelling and her husband Dean McDermott have been together. But it appears their relationship is either coming to an end or on rocky grounds.\n\nOver the weekend, McDermott shared a post on Instagram, saying he and his wife Spelling were breaking up.\n\n\"It's with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and five amazing children, that Tori Spelling and I have decided to go our separate ways and start a new journey of our own,\" he began the statement.\n\n\"We will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time. We ask that you all respect our privacy as we take this time to surround our family with love and work our way through this.\"\n\nBut only a few short hours after the post was made, it mysteriously was archived.\n\nWatch: even celebrities need wingmen. Post continues below.\n\nVideo via Mamamia.\n\nThe post was made in the early hours of Saturday morning.\n\nRepresentatives for both Spelling and McDermott have so far not responded to PEOPLE's request for comment, or further confirmed the news.\n\nThe Beverly Hills, 90210 actress is yet to publicly comment on the matter.\n\nOver the past 18 years, the couple has weathered plenty of storms together.\n\nIn 2014, McDermott publicly admitted to cheating on Spelling. He said he had engaged in a long affair with another woman, saying in their reality series True Tori that he felt \"shame\" over the infidelity.\n\nDuring a recent podcast, McDermott said his reasons for cheating were to do with him and his state of mind, rather than anything to do with Spelling.\n\n\"It was about inadequacies with myself. I felt so bad about myself, I felt like a piece of s**t, I needed to do that to feel some kind of power,\" he explained. \"It was horrible and I'm an a**hole piece of s**t for doing it. That was a rough Christmas, but we came out through the other end.\"\n\nReflecting on the situation, Spelling said that while she's proud they didn't hide their marital issues from the cameras, it has been tough for her children to read of their parent's relationship woes online.\n\n\"My kids have not seen clips, but they've seen something out there online and my daughter saw something,\" Spelling said on the Women on Top podcast in 2020. \"It really upset her.\"\n\nSpelling and McDermott have five children together — Liam, 16, Stella, 15, Hattie, 11, Finn, 10, and six-year-old Beau.\n\nThe pair regularly share parenting content online, Spelling saying she is more the \"feelings mum\" whereas McDermott is the \"procedural\" parent.\n\nSpelling said the fear around McDermott's propensity to cheat continued to be a sore point after the 2014 infidelity was brought to her attention.\n\n\"My biggest fear in our relationship was I was like, he's going to cheat on me, he's going to cheat on me, he's going to cheat on me,\" she said.\n\n\"So when it happened, I was like, 'See, I always thought from day one he was going to cheat on me,' and it wasn't about him, that was about me. I was like, 'Okay, I know I'm not good enough,' that's how I felt about myself and one day he's going to realise that and he's gonna find someone else.\"\n\nIn 2021, there were further rumours that the pair's marriage was rocky, after Spelling posted a holiday season card on Instagram in December — and McDermott was notably absent from it.\n\nShe later explained that it was because McDermott was away filming a movie at the time. But the rumours persisted.\n\nFor McDermott, he has said that since the affair, \"everything crashed\" but it allowed them to \"start over and completely rebuild\".\n\nAs Spelling said to PEOPLE previously: \"It was one of the worst times in our lives, but it was also one of the best times. I wouldn't change anything because if we hadn't started talking and opened up those lines of communication, maybe we wouldn't be here today.\"\n\nFeature Image: Getty.\n\nfor your chance to win one of four $50 gift vouchers!"
