        "text": "Tori Spelling has finally addressed her divorce from Dean McDermott.\n\nAfter officially initiating their divorce proceedings over the weekend, the Beverly Hills, 90210 star spoke up about the split on the debut episode of her podcast, misSPELLING.\n\n“I’ve never felt more alone,” the 50-year-old actress confessed. “I don’t feel worth loving. That’s the truth. And that’s something that’s just in you, it’s not something I wanted or created. That starts when you’re young. [And changing it], that’s not easy to do… I don’t know if you can.”\n\nAfter a tumultuous period of their relationship, Spelling finally filed for divorce on Friday, March 29. Immediately afterwards, she sat down to record her podcast.\n\nIn fact, the debut podcast begins with Spelling calling up McDermott and informing him about the filing.\n\nRecalling the moment, she explained, \"There’s this weird thing that I didn’t know about before that you have to be careful with your ex. It’s a he-said, she-said, who filed first. I had to file and go through the process and then once it was accepted and publicly posted, then I’m allowed to call and fill in my ex. So I just called Dean.”\n\nReflecting on the downfall of their relationship, Spelling pinpointed the demise of the \"honeymoon period\" just four months after they first got together."
