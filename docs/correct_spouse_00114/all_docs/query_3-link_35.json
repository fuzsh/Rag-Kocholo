        "text": "Post by spinsterliz on\n\nI wonder what will become of her proposed reality show now? Apparently it's called \"NoTORIous\" (ooh, clever) but so far nobody wants to pick it up. Can't say I'm surprised about that. I have no idea who would be interested in watching a reality show about Tori Spelling. Maybe people would watch the first episode out of curiosity but I couldn't see it actually becoming a hit. She peaked at least eight years ago.\n\nPost by Hamatron on\n\nDONNA MARTIN GRADUATES!\n\nOops, er. She seems like a nice person albeit a little loopy (she's into dog psychics, and beachball boobs that are slowly rotating towards her armpits). She also makes my top ten worst actresses ever list-- be it for 90210, Trick or that one show that was on (...the WB?) for ten seconds before it was cancelled. Actually, I think almost all of the shitty actresses on my list are the product of nepotism... funny that.\n\nPost by nuharoo on\n\nI always hated how she was always the \"victim\" all the time. Even my dad noticed it. She was always the one who was raped, hit, shot at, etc. And to think her dad was the producer of almost everything she's been in. I wonder if he somehow subconsciously hates his daughter.\n\nPost by dnt on\n\nShortly before they got hitched, Spelling told USA Today she knew her fianc√© was \"the one\" because \"he waited for me.\"\n\nMy God. That's exactly what Tori-as-Donna said to David on 90210. Of course, David DIDN'T wait for her, he cheated on her with some PR flack in the back of a limo.\n\nI've been watching 90210 in reruns on SoapNet and it amazes me that, until maybe the 5th season or so, I actually thought Tori Spelling was pretty cute, and her character was pretty down to earth. She was always too thin, but during the high school years, she looked pretty good. Why she felt the need to butcher herself into Michael Jackson-like plasticity is beyond me."
