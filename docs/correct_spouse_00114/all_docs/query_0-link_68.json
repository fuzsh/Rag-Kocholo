        "text": "Tori Spelling says her former Beverly Hills, 90210 co-star Brian Austin Green was her “first love” and the only man to have broken her heart.\n\nThe actress, 50, is currently divorcing Dean McDermott after 18 years of marriage and dated Brian, 50, while they starred in the popular 1990s high school show.\n\nShe has now told her fellow former Beverly Hills, 90210 co-star Shannen Doherty, 53, on her misSpelling podcast about how she recently talked to Brian about her split from Dean, 57, saying: “'No, I was in love. Maybe I wasn’t in love. I’m not sure. No one’s broken my heart since you.’\n\n“And there was like pause, pause. And I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is the first time I’ve said it in 30 years.’”\n\nDespite their fling in their teens, Tori added their relationship is now purely platonic.\n\nShe added: “You know how close Brian and I are. I tell him everything. We’re brother and sister and best friends, so close. We can have that connection.”\n\nTori, who divorced Dean last year after 17 years of marriage, also insisted she is happy for Brian and his Dancing With the Stars professional dancer fiancée Sharna Burgess, 38, with whom he had a child in June 2022.\n\nShe added: “It’s been 30 years. We’re just friends. I love his fiancée. It’s not that. But if he says something to me, I get so flustered and riled up.”\n\nThe actress also recalled on the podcast she cheated on her then-boyfriend Ryan Ozar, to whom she lost her virginity, with Brian when she was about 18 years old.\n\nBut Tori and Shannen then concluded her teen romance with Brian was due to youthful infatuation.\n\nTori and Brian played love interests Donna Martin and David Silver on Beverly Hills, 90210, and their characters got married at the end of the series.\n\nShe went on to marry Charlie Shanian in 2004 and they divorced in 2006, the year she married Brian, with whom she has five children.\n\nDean was already the father of a son named Jack, who he had in 1998 with his 61-year-old actress ex-wife Mary Jo Eustace.\n\nBrian also married actress Megan Fox, 37, in 2011 and they had three boys before separating in 2020.\n\nThe actor also has 21-year-old son, Kassius Lijah, with his 55-year-old former girlfriend Vanessa Marcil."
