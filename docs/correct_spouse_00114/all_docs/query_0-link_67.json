        "text": "After many years of drama and threatening to pull the plug on their marriage, Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott finally announced last month that they’re getting a divorce after 18 years of marriage. The Spelling-McDemotts have five children: Liam, 17, Stella, 15, Hattie, 12, Finn, 11, and Beau, seven. You may remember how Tori and Dean got together in the first place. They met on the set of a TV movie called Mind Over Murder while both were married to other people. Tori was married to actor Charlie Shanian and Dean was married to singer/actress Mary Jo Eustace, with whom he had a son, Jack. Mary Jo did not go quietly and even now, she’s always good for a juicy quote or tidbit about Tori and Dean or how Dean is a sh–tty father.\n\nSince their split, Dean’s gone to rehab and is now with girlfriend Lily Calo. Tori’s busy with her new(ish) podcast, misSPELLING. On the show, Tori’s overshared lots of details about the ending of their marriage, including tidbits like they hadn’t slept in the same bedroom for three years, the fight that ended their marriage involved her throwing a loaded baked potato, and that she hasn’t used the bathroom alone – by choice!! – in 18 years. Oh, and on the inaugural episode of misSPELLING, Tori called Dean live on air to break the news to him that she’d filed for divorce. Re-enter Mary Jo. During an event in Beverly Hills last week, MJ was asked about Tori and Dean’s divorce, and she did not disappoint.\n\n“Desperate much? It’s just low, low, low,” she candidly told Page Six at the Beverly Hills Rejuvenation Center’s West Hollywood grand opening on Thursday.\n\n“It’s just not how you conduct things,” Eustace, who shares 25-year-old son Jack with McDermott, added. The Canadian songstress didn’t hold back as she also called Spelling “so thirsty” for expressing interest in joining the “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” cast. However, Eustace, who seems to be on good terms with McDermott, played coy when asked about her ex’s new relationship with girlfriend Lily Calo.\n\n“Who’s Lily? I did not know. Well, I mean. Who’s Lily? I wish her luck. I don’t know what to say. I really don’t,” she told us.\n\nEustace, 61, and McDermott, 57, married in 1993 but divorced in 2006 after he had an affair with Spelling, 50, while working on their Lifetime movie “Mind Over Murder.”\n\nMcDermott announced that he and Spelling were separating after 17 years of marriage in June 2023, but he deleted the post shortly afterwards. However, just a few days later, they seemed to confirm the separation when McDermott was photographed moving his belongings out of their home. Since then, both the “Beverly Hills, 90210” star and the “Chopped Canada” alum have each spoken out about the separation several times.\n\nIn March, Spelling stunned fans when she called McDermott while recording the first episode of her podcast, “MisSpelling,” to inform him that she had officially filed for divorce.\n\n“In all honesty after this whole journey, if it’s about … who files first, the other person is wrong, I feel like I deserve to file first then,” she told him over the phone.\n\n[From Page Six]\n\nI mean…Mary Jo’s not wrong here. Both Tori and Dean are thirsty mothersf—ckers who spent 18+ years together despite hating each other. Rather than separate, they continued to sell their drama to the highest bidder. I think it’s both hilarious and messed up that Tori likely made Dean take down his “We’re separating” Instagram post only to use the “I filed for divorce” play to get attention for her podcast. It’s completely wild that she did that, but you know, girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do for attention. Substance abuse issues aside, they deserved one another. But, Mary Jo, Jack, and Tori and Dean’s five children together don’t deserve to be casualties of their messiness. I have no idea if these two actually do or will ever have their sh-t together, but for their kids’ sake, I hope they do or get it together soon."
