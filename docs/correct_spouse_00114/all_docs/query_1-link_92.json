        "text": "What Is Tori Spelling's Net Worth and Salary?\n\nTori Spelling is an American actress who has a net worth of $150 thousand. Tori Spelling is probably best known for playing the role of Donna Martin on the '90s TV series \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" which was co-produced by her legendary father, Aaron Spelling. She also briefly starred in the show's modern spin-off series.\n\nDespite being the daughter of Aaron Spelling (net worth $600 million at the time of his death), one of the richest and most prolific television producers in history, Tori did not inherit a significant portion of her father's estate when he passed away in 2006. Instead, the bulk of the wealth went to her mother, Candy Spelling. Reportedly, Tori received just $800,000. Further financial strain developed when Candy allegedly cut Tori off financially, claiming her daughter's spending habits were out of control. The mother-daughter duo has had a rocky relationship over the years, with money often cited as a point of contention.\n\nOutside of her role as Donna Martin on \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" Tori has had a diverse career in television, film, and reality TV. She starred in the sitcom \"So Notorious\" (2006), a satirical take on her own public image, and has appeared in numerous TV movies, notably for Lifetime and the Hallmark Channel. Spelling also ventured into reality television, co-starring with her husband, Dean McDermott, in \"Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood\" (2007-2012). In addition to acting, she's authored several books, including the \"New York Times\" bestseller \"sTORI Telling,\" and launched a jewelry line, showing her entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nIs Tori Spelling Broke?\n\nIn October 2013, Tori made the shocking announcement that she was broke and had squandered away every penny she had ever made to the point where she was borrowing money from her mother to pay rent and could not afford a simple medical procedure for her husband.\n\nSpelling claimed to have blown through every dollar she ever made acting or inherited from her late father (an estimated $15 â€“ $20 million). In an interview, she claimed to have blown through millions of dollars on failed real estate investments and lavish purchases for her family. When asked about her exact net worth Tori replied:\n\n\"I don't have one million dollars. We had some income here and there, but no savings apart from our retirement accounts.\"\n\nTo be fair, Tori's husband, Dean, clarified her statements the next day by telling US Magazine:\n\n\"Right now things are going well. Tori and I are doing just fine financially.\"\n\nAlso, keep in mind that Tori's mom, Candy Spelling, has a net worth of $600 million. So I wouldn't stress too much about Tori Spelling's financial future. But at the same time, in March 2017, City National Bank filed a lawsuit against Tori and Dean after they failed to pay off $200,000 out of a $400,000 loan. City National also claimed that Tori overdrew $17,000 from her checking account.\n\nWhile that lawsuit was going on, Dean was also being sued by his ex for $100,000 in owed child support. In October 2017, court documents filed by Dean's ex-wife, Mary Jo Eustace, alleged that months after she had taken him to court for his failure to pay alimony, he had stopped paying child support. In her lawsuit, Eustace stated:\n\n\"In the last six weeks he has been on two luxurious vacations, Iceland & the Four Seasons in Punta Mita. He resides in a $2 million estate paid by his mother-in-law, Candy Spelling, and has no impetus to work. He owes over $100,000 moving forward, and I believe he has no intention of paying. He bounces my son's university rent/tuition and is delinquent in paying therapist bills, while he shops visibly and throws lavish parties for his other five children.\"\n\nA few months earlier, the couple was sued by American Express for $87,000 in credit card debt and $260,000 in unpaid taxes. In 2023, it was reported that Spelling settled her credit card debt with American Express.\n\nEarly Life\n\nTori Spelling was born Victoria Davey Spelling on May 16, 1973, in Los Angeles, California. She was born to two famous parents: Her father is television and film producer Aaron Spelling, and her mother is author and socialite Candy Spelling. Her brother, Randy Spelling, is a former actor who now works as a life coach. Tori attended Beverly Hills High School, then she completed her education at Harvard Westlake, graduating in 1991.\n\nActing Career\n\nSpelling took acting lessons from an acting coach her father hired for her at just age six. She subsequently landed guest spots on several popular TV shows like \"The Love Boat,\" \"Fantasy Island,\" and \"Saved by the Bell.\" When she was 17, she was given the role of Donna Martin on \"Beverly Hills, 90210,\" co-produced by her father's company Spelling Television. The series ran for ten seasons, from 1990 to 2000, with Spelling portraying Donna the entire run. She was nominated for two Young Artist Awards for her work. During her time on the show, she was also featured in several made-for-TV films, including \"Co-Ed Call Girl,\" \"A Friend to Die For,\" \"Mother May I Sleep With Danger?,\" \"The House of Yes,\" and \"Trick,\" all in the '90s. In 2006, Spelling starred as herself in the VH1 Sitcom \"So Notorious.\" It parodied her public image.\n\nReality Shows\n\nIn 2007, Tori and her husband, Dean McDermott, bought a bed and breakfast, Chateau La Rue, in Fallbrook, California, and subsequently starred in a reality show called \"Tori and Dean: Inn Love.\" That show later became \"Tori and Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood\" after they sold the bed and breakfast. In July 2007, Spelling became an ordained minister in order to marry a gay couple at the bed and breakfast. The wedding ceremony was featured on an episode of \"Inn Love.\" Tori and Dean's spinoff series of \"Home Sweet Hollywood,\" \"Tori & Dean, sTORIbook Weddings,\" premiered on April 6, 2011. Writers filed a $60 million dollar lawsuit against the series after claiming they came up with the idea of the same series starring Tori and Dean. In the lawsuit, they cited breach of implied-in-fact contract, slander of title, and unfair business practices, among many other charges. In August 2014, eight half-hour episodes of a new reality show, \"Tori & Dean: Cabin Fever,\" were produced and aired on CMT Canada and HGTV. The show chronicled Spelling, McDermott, and their children as they moved into a lakeside cabin in Ontario, Canada. She has also been a guest and contestant on episodes of \"The Masked Singer\" and a host on 2022's \"Love at First Lie.\"\n\nOther Television Roles\n\nTori voiced the Pirate Princess in \"Jake and the Neverland Pirates\" in 2011. Later, she played a role in the comedy short film \"Hoarders: Untold sTori.\" It premiered at the Outfest Film Festival in July 2011. Spelling was on \"Big Brother 13\" in September 2011. In 2012, she made a guest appearance on Nick Jr.'s \"Yo Gabba Gabba.\" In 2014, Spelling starred in the ABC Family TV series \"Mystery Girls\" alongside her former \"90210\" co-star Jennie Garth. In 2016, she did a remake of \"Mother, May I Sleep with Danger?\" alongside James Franco. Since June 2018, Spelling has been hosting the makeover TV series \"The Look: All Stars.\" She also appeared in the 2018 TV movie \"The Last Sharknado: It's About Time.\"\n\nOther Ventures\n\nSpelling has her own line of fashion jewelry that she designs and sells on the Home Shopping Network. Tori has written three books, \"sTori Telling,\" which tells more about her life in the limelight, \"Mommywood,\" which describes her experiences as a mom, and \"Uncharted Territory.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nTori has been married twice. First to actor and playwright Charlie Shanian from July 2004 to April 2006. In May 2006, she married Dean McDermott, whom she fell in love with while filming 2005's \"Mind over Murder,\" a made-for-TV movie. At the time, Dean McDermott was married to Mary Jo Eustace. Dean and Mary Jo had a child and were in the process of adopting a child. They divorced in 2006.\n\nTori and Dean have five children together. Tori is also the stepmother to Jack Montgomery McDermott, Dean's son with Eustance. It was reported in June 2022 that Spelling and McDermott were in the middle of a trial separation. In June 2023, they officially announced their separation after 17 years of marriage. Tori officially filed for divorce in March 2024.\n\nIn May 2023, Tori and her children were admitted to Urgent Care after getting sick from a mold infection in their house. She took to social media to ask for guidance on the issue that has been \"slowly killing\" her family for years.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2020, Tori and Dean paid $3.7 million for a 5,980-square-foot home in the Santa Monica Mountains. The mansion includes five bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a gourmet kitchen, a playroom, and a wet bar, and the property features a swimming pool and a spa with a rock waterfall.\n\nThe couple previously owned a 6,700-square-foot Encino estate, which they sold for $2.5 million in 2011. The Encino home has 6 bedrooms, 6.5 bathrooms, and 4 fireplaces. The home has a formal entryway and custom finishes, including French doors, wood and stone flooring, and a gourmet kitchen. The master suite has a sitting area, fireplace, balcony, and spa tub. The grounds are landscaped and feature a lanai, BBQ, putting green, and a pool/spa."
