        "text": "Cheating on her first husband Charlie Shanian with Dean McDermott is a regret Tori Spelling has lived with, but could meeting with her ex finally give her the closure she has been waiting years for?\n\nOn last night’s True Tori, the Mystery Girls star sat down with Charlie for the first time in eight years.\n\nWhen Dean asked Tori if she regretted anything from the situation she responded, “Yeah, I regret how I handled things, obviously. I told him that, that I regret that every day of my life.” She continued, “If I had it to do over again, I wouldn’t have done it the way I did it. He’s a good man, smart and just gets it.”\n\nWhen Dean said that he sensed doubt from Tori about not regretting her decision to leave him, she said, “I can’t doubt you. I made that choice. I chose to not be with him. I chose to be with you. Did you turn out to be different than how I thought you would be? Yeah. But I made the choice so I need to figure it out.”"
