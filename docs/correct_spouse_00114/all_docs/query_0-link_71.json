        "text": "Going down memory lane can often be a tough trip, especially for Tori Spelling.\n\nThe former Beverly Hills 90210 star visited her ex-husband, Charlie Shanian, whom she cheated on with now-husband Dean McDermott, and the visit left her emotionally reeling. In a new clip for an upcoming episode of True Tori, Spelling returns home from her quick visit, only to confess to her husband that she’s feeling “alone.”\n\n“I regret the way I handled things obviously,” she snaps at McDermott, who is sick in bed with a migraine. “He’s a good man.”\n\nSpelling left Shanian and married McDermott, which resulted with the reality star giving birth to four children. But after she recalls what a “good man” her ex is, McDermott worryingly asks her if seeing Shanian brews feelings of anger about the Chopped Canada star cheating on her."
