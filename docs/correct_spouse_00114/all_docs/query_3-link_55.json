        "text": "Tori Spelling may not have liked how her father structured his estate.\n\nFame and fortune do not buy happiness.\n\nNumerous celebrities have had tumultuous relationships with spouses, parents, and other family members.\n\nThese tensions can be highlighted through estate planning and reactions to the plans.\n\nAccording to a recent Page Six article titled “Tori Spelling’s ex-husband claims she cried when dad left fortune to mom Candy: ‘She was so upset’,” screenwriter Charlie Shanian recalled Tori Spelling being visibly shaken by the estate planning decisions of her father Aaron Spelling.\n\nAlthough now an ex-husband, Shanian was married to Tori Spelling from 2004 to 2006.\n\nHer ex recalled how Tori learned of the estate planning wishes of her father prior to his death.\n\nLearning her father had left the entire fortune to her mom Candy Spelling brought Tori Spelling to tears.\n\nWhy was she so upset?\n\nAccording to Shanian, the control granted to her mother was the most upsetting aspect of the estate plan for Tori.\n\nCharlie Shanian seems to recall Aaron Spelling hoped the way he structured his estate plan would help the mother and daughter to reconnect.\n\nShanian shared how he believed trusts had been set up by Candy to be received by her adult children someday.\n\nThere has been recent public disapproval of Candy on social media, where she has been condemned for seeming flippant about the financial struggles of her daughter.\n\nDespite this, Candy Spelling did find a house for Tori and her grandchildren.\n\nA source reported Tori Spelling declined the home because it was not located where she wanted to live.\n\nAlthough the fortune of Aaron Spelling was quite significant, his daughter has had her own career as an actress.\n\nHer breakout role was as Donna Martin on the 1990s television show Beverly Hills 90210.\n\nIn 2019, she reprised this role for the spin-off BH90210.\n\nTori Spelling also appeared in several made-for-television movies and wrote an autobiography titled Stori Telling.\n\nHer book was named the best celebrity autobiography of 2009.\n\nDespite her own career, Tori Spelling has struggled financially.\n\nWhether the estate planning goals of Aaron Spelling were to help restore relationships between his wife and daughter or to protect her inheritance from being squandered, it is not surprising his estate planning upset some of his loved ones."
