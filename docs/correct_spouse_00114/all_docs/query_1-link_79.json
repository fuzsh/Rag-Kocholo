        "text": "Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott's relationship status has been a topic of celebrity gossip from the day they met. Over the weekend, it took another dramatic turn when he posted to social media a statement announcing their separation. Soon after, he deleted it.\n\nThe post, which appeared and disappeared on June 17, said: \"It's with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways and start a new journey of our own. We will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time. We ask that you all respect our privacy as we take this time to surround our family with love and work our way through this.\"\n\nNeither the Beverly Hills, 90210 star, 50, nor Dean, 56, has provided an explanation or update since, and their joint rep hasn't replied to Yahoo Entertainment's request for comment.\n\nHowever, a source did tell Us Weekly, \"Tori and Dean are not getting a divorce. Tori and Dean have been better than ever. ... They’ve had their ups and downs like any couple, but [they] have continued working on their marriage through couple’s counseling. They love each other and are not going to split.”\n\nTheir relationship status has long raised questions — and brows — from their first days together when they had an affair while both were married to other people and then ditched their spouses for each other. Let's look back at their drama-filled time together, including their infidelities and financial troubles...\n\n1993: Dean, a Canadian actor, marries actress Mary Jo Eustace, who is five years his senior.\n\nJuly 2004: Tori, the '90s TV actress best known for playing Donna Martin, says \"I do\" to screenwriter Charlie Shanian in a $1 million wedding.\n\nJuly 2005: Tori and Dean are cast in the Lifetime TV movie Mind Over Murder. They have sex the night they meet, Tori later says, cheating on their respective spouses.\n\nAugust 2005: Three weeks after meeting Tori, Dean tells Eustace — while on a family vacation with their 7-year-old son, Jack, and 1-month-old adopted daughter, Lola — that he's in love with the 90210 alum and he's leaving. Tori calls Shanian to a joint therapy session and tells him she cheated on him and doesn't want to be married anymore.\n\nSeptember 2005: Tori separates from Shanian — and he files for divorce the next month.\n\nDean files for divorce from Eustace, listing their separation as Sept. 2. Eustace calls the situation “humiliating beyond anything I’ve ever known\" and finalizes the adoption of their daughter as a single parent.\n\nDecember 2005: Dean proposes to Tori on a Christmas tree farm on Christmas Eve in Toronto. They said in a statement they were \"so incredibly happy and in love\" and \"cannot wait to start our lives together.\"\n\nMay 2006: With their ink on their divorce papers still wet, the So NoTORIous star marries Dean in Fiji. \"We didn’t want to wait another day to get married,\" she told People. He added, \"We’re soulmates.\"\n\nDean gets Tori-inspired tattoos, including her face on his arm.\n\nJune 2006: Tori's father, producer Aaron Spelling, dies. She sees him two weeks before his death after an estrangement from both her parents (including mom Candy) over her divorce and affair.\n\nDecember 2006: Dean proposes to Tori again on Christmas. \"I immediately started crying and said 'Yes! Again and again and again!'\" she says.\n\nMarch 2007: Tori and Dean welcome their first child, Liam.\n\nThe same month, their reality show Tori & Dean: Inn Love premieres on Oxygen. It sees them running a bed and breakfast with what she views as the unexpectedly small amount — $800,000 — she received as inheritance from her father's massive estate.\n\nMarch 2008: Tori releases her book, sTORI Telling, detailing her affair. \"I had no regrets,\" she wrote. \"Something was really wrong with my marriage. Not only because I slept with this guy — though that certainly wasn’t a positive sign — but because I didn't regret it.\"\n\nJune 2008: Their daughter Stella is born. After two seasons, they return to L.A. and their show is renamed Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood.\n\nOctober 2009: Eustace publishes a book about her split: Divorce Sucks: What to Do When Irreconcilable Differences, Lawyer Fees, and Your Ex's Hollywood Wife Make You Miserable.\n\nMay 2010: Tori and Dean renew their vows in Beverly Hills.\n\nJuly 2010: Dean is in a motorcycle accident and is treated for a punctured and collapsed lung.\n\nApril 2011: Tori & Dean: sTORIbook Weddings, in which they act as wedding planners, premieres and lasts one season.\n\nOctober 2011: The couple's daughter Hattie is born.

The other woman, Emily Goodhand, told the outlet: \"He told me he and Tori had a sexless marriage. I believed him.\"\n\nJanuary 2014: Dean admits to cheating and goes to rehab. He says in a statement: \"I am truly sorry for the mistakes I have made and for the pain I've caused my family. I take full responsibility for my actions and have voluntarily checked myself into a treatment center to address some health and personal issues. I am grateful to be getting the help I need so I can become the husband and father my family deserves.\"\n\nApril 2014: The couple work through his cheating on a Lifetime series, True Tori.\n\nJanuary 2016: Tori is sued over a $38,000 unpaid American Express bill.\n\nApril 2016: Dean proposes to Tori for the third time.

But she was like, 'I just can't turn off the love for you. I love you. You hurt me. I'm angry, but I love you. I can't turn that off.’\"\n\nAugust 2020: Tori talks about saving their marriage, saying on the Women on Top podcast: \"I make my own money. I can be a single mom, but I actually really love him and I want to work on this. If it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out, but we're going to try.\"\n\nOctober 2020: Tori and Dean are hit by a tax lien for $707,487 in unpaid federal taxes for 2014.\n\nJune 2021: Tori — who is photographed not wearing her wedding ring during the year — says on SiriusXM's Jeff Lewis Live that she and Dean don't sleep in the same bed.\n\nNovember 2021: Tori doesn't directly reference the rumors, but does leave Dean off her Christmas card.

We ask that you all respect our privacy as we take this time to surround our family with love and work our way through this. Thank you all for your support and kindness.\"\n\nSoon after, Dean's announcement is deleted.\n\nA source tells Us Weekly they will not divorce: \"Tori and Dean are not getting a divorce. Tori and Dean have been better than ever\" in recent months. \"They've had their ups and downs like any couple, but [they] have continued working on their marriage through couple’s counseling.
