        "text": "Tori Spelling and Dean McDermott’s marriage had an explosive ending.\n\nThe actress finished the first episode of her “Misspelling” podcast last week by revealing her estranged husband’s marriage-ending comment — that he was sick of picking up “her s–t” — and detailed the rest of their fight in Monday’s installment.\n\n“This guttural scream came out of me,” Spelling, 50, told listeners. “It wasn’t even a sexy scream like running in a horror film. It was beast-like. It wasn’t pretty at all.”\n\nThe “Beverly Hills, 90210” alum, who yelled “F–k you,” then threw her Wendy’s baked potato.\n\n“I took my most prized possession … loaded to perfection, and I smashed it on the ground,” she recalled. “I’ve never seen a baked potato fly like that. Let me just say, it was wall-to-wall potato. It was on the oven. It was everywhere.”\n\nAt the time, Spelling told herself, “‘Later tonight on your Ambien, you will come out here, and you will lick this up and eat it properly.'”\n\nThe “BH90210” star knew she had gone “too far” by “dirty[ing] the kitchen,” so she went into the room she shares with her kids and locked the door.\n\nShe alleged that after “banging” on it, McDermott entered the room through a side entrance.\n\n“He came in, and he was very, very upset,” she claimed. “And he said, ‘I want a divorce. This is over.’ And I said, ‘OK. Great. OK.’”\n\nMcDermott, who shares Liam, 17, Stella, 15, Hattie, 12, Finn, 11, and Beau, 7, with Spelling, posted a statement about their split to social media that evening — which he later took down at his eldest daughter’s request.\n\n“It’s with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that @torispelling and I have decided to go our separate ways, and start a new journey of our own,” the former “Chopped Canada” host captioned the since-deleted upload in June 2023.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nFour months later, McDermott packed on PDA with new girlfriend Lily Calo. Spelling was photographed making out with a mystery man shortly after.\n\nMcDermott later told Page Six the role his addiction battle played in his breakup.\n\nSpelling didn’t file for divorce until last month, documenting the moment in the March 31 episode of her podcast as she called her estranged husband to share the news.\n\nThe “Mind Over Murder” co-stars were previously married to Charlie Shanian and Mary Jo Eustace, cheating on their former spouses when their romance began in 2005."
