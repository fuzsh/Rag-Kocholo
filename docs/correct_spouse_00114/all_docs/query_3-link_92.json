It is the first marriage for both.\n\nSpelling, daughter of TV producer Aaron Spelling, spent 10 years on his hit series about a group of rich teens who attend Beverly Hills High School. The series ran from 1990-2000.\n\nHer films include Scary Movie 2, Scream 2 and Troop Beverly Hills.\n\nThe couple met on stage in 2002 during the Los Angeles production of the romantic comedy Maybe, Baby It's You, co-written by Shanian. They were in 11 vignettes about couples in search of love."
