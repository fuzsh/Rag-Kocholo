        "text": "Canadian actor\n\nDean McDermott (born November 16, 1966)[1] is a Canadian actor best known as a reality television personality with his wife, actress Tori Spelling, and as the host of the cooking competition Chopped Canada. He played the role of Constable Renfield Turnbull on the TV series Due South.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMcDermott was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to David and Doreen McDermott.[1] He has three sisters, Dale, Dawn, and Dana. He graduated from North Albion Collegiate Institute in Rexdale, Ontario.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMcDermott has performed in films Open Range,[3] Irvine Welsh's Ecstasy[4] and Against the Ropes.[5]\n\nMcDermott has appeared in several TV movies including Always and Forever,[6] Santa Baby 2: Christmas Maybe[7] and A Christmas Visitor.[8]\n\nMcDermott has had a variety of guest and recurring roles on television series, such as Earth: Final Conflict,[9] Tracker,[10] 1-800-Missing,[11] NCIS[12] and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.[13] 2016 saw McDermott take on a starring role, portraying Iain Vaughn on Slasher.[14][15]\n\nCulinary arts\n\n[edit]\n\nMcDermott is a professionally trained chef.[16] In 2013, he became a member of \"Team Guy\" on the second season of Food Network's Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off and was the winner,[17] and in January 2014, McDermott began hosting Chopped Canada on Food Network Canada.[18] McDermott hosted Chopped Canada for two seasons, announcing in March 2015 that he would leave the show.[19]\n\nMcDermott released a cookbook The Gourmet Dad, in which he wanted to make intimidating plates more attractive to kids.[16][20]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMcDermott's first wife is actress Mary Jo Eustace.[1] They have one child, son Jack Montgomery (born October 10, 1998).[21] In July 2005, McDermott began filming the Lifetime TV movie Mind Over Murder in Ottawa, during which he met actress Tori Spelling, who was then married to writer-actor Charlie Shanian. Spelling and McDermott began an affair the night they met.[22] Upon his subsequent divorce from Eustace, McDermott was granted joint custody of their son Jack, opting not to move forward with the adoption of a baby girl, Lola Eustace (born July 7, 2004), whom he and Eustace were in the process of adopting prior to their separation. However, according to recent Instagram posts, McDermott refers to Lola as his “step daughter” and Lola refers to McDermott as her “dad”.[23]\n\nMcDermott married Tori Spelling on May 7, 2006, in Fiji.[24] Spelling and McDermott renewed their vows on May 8, 2010, in Beverly Hills.[25] Spelling and McDermott have five children: three sons, Liam Aaron (born March 13, 2007),[26] Finn Davey (born August 30, 2012)[27] and Beau Dean (born March 2, 2017)[28] and two daughters, Stella Doreen (born June 9, 2008)[29] and Hattie Margaret (born October 10, 2011).[30][31][32]\n\nOn July 1, 2010, McDermott was involved in a dirt bike accident, his second motorcycle accident of the year. He was hospitalized in Los Angeles with a punctured and collapsed lung, and doctors said they expected him to make a full recovery.[33] McDermott was released from the hospital on July 6, 2010.[34]\n\nMcDermott became an American citizen at a ceremony in Los Angeles on August 21, 2010.[citation needed]\n\nIn December 2013, after welcoming their second son, Us Weekly broke the news that McDermott was unfaithful to Spelling. The couple worked through the aftermath of the affair on a Lifetime series titled True Tori.[35]\n\nOn January 23, 2014, a month after the news broke, McDermott's publicist announced McDermott had entered rehab for \"some health and personal issues.\"[36]\n\nWhile McDermott and Spelling's marriage was back on track, the couple once again made headlines in 2016 for owing $39,000 to American Express in unpaid credit card bills. McDermott's mother-in-law Candy, who was also on good terms with her daughter, told TMZ at the time that she was helping out the family financially.[37]\n\nIn June 2023, McDermott announced that he and Spelling decided to separate after 18 years together in a now-deleted Instagram post.[38]\n\nOn March 29, 2024, Spelling officially filed for divorce from McDermott, citing irreconcilable differences and asking for sole physical and joint legal custody of their five children with visitation rights for McDermott.[39]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nMovies\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1988 Graveyard Shift II Best Boy 1990 Straight Line John 1991 Stepping Out Young Man at Bar 1995 Iron Eagle IV Major Miles Pierce 1998 Bone Daddy Mort Jr. A Cool, Dry Place Sheriff Pritchard 2001 Picture Claire Attendant at the Station 2003 Open Range Doc Barlow 2004 The Skulls III Detective Staynor direct to video Against the Ropes Pete Kallen Touch of Pink Alisdair Keith 2007 Kiss the Bride Plumber 2008 Saving God Blaze/John Henry James 2011 Irvine Welsh's Ecstasy Hugh Thompson 2017 Garlic & Gunpowder Agent Bean 2017 Dead Again in Tombstone Dr. Goldsworthy 2023 My Animal Coach Dutch\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1989 My Secret Identity Roger 2 episodes C.B.C.'s Magic Hour Chris Ryan 2 episodes Friday's Curse Peter Episode: \"Crippled Inside\" 1991 Final Judgment Young Marty TV movie Conspiracy of Silence Constable Dutton Miniseries 1992 Top Cops Wasco Episode: \"Steve Sessler/Jerry Smith/Terry Blaylock\" 1993 Sweating Bullets Tony Episode: \"Feedback\" Counterstrick Johnny Episode: \"Clearcut\" Exploring Ontario's Provincial Parks Nick Ward Miniseries Street Legal Harris Kepler Episode: \"Believe the Children\" 1994 Lives of Girls & Women Garet French TV movie Wild C.A.T.s WarBlade (voice) TV movie Sodbusters Young Destiny TV movie The Forget-Me-Not Murders Agent Alex 2 episodes (voice role) 1994, 1998 Due South Laurier / Bubba Dean Episode: \"The Man Who Knew Too Little\" / Episode: \"Doctor Longball\" 1995 Nancy Drew Mackerin Episode: \"Welcome to the Callisto\" Bloodknot Local Boy TV movie Derby Eric McDowell TV movie 1995–1999 Due South Constable Turnbull Recurring role 1996 Critical Choices Johnny TV movie Jack Reed: Death & Vengeance Vasili TV movie Kung Fu: The Legend Continues Sheriff Episode: \"Storm Warning\" The Outer Limits Ray Carter Episode: \"Vanshing Act\" Ed McBain's 87th Precinct: Ice Tim Moore TV movie 1997 Joe Torre: Curveballs Along the Way David Cone TV movie F/X: The Series Ted Abbott Episode: \"Reunion\" 1998 Power Play Mark Simpson Main cast The Wall Captain Alle1n TV movie Evidence of Blood Young Harlan Wade TV movie Blood on Her Hands Detective Steve Nelson TV movie Fast Track Unknown Role 2 episodes La Femme Nikita Sykes Episode: \"New Regime\" 1999, 2002 Earth: Final Conflict Colonel Liam Kincaid / Lt.
