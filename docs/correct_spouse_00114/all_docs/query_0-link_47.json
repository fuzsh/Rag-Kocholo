        "text": "In a new clip from True Tori, Tori Spelling says she empathizes with Dean McDermott’s mistress, Emily Goodhand, because she also couldn’t practice much restraint when she first met him.\n\n“We had sex the first night we met,” Tori told a friend when explaining why she feels some need to defend Emily. “It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, just get your rocks off, have sex with someone just to have sex,’ you know? It was a conscious decision, like, fell head over heels for you.”\n\nIn a later confessional, Tori said the irony of her current situation isn’t lost on her.\n\n“Dean and I met and fell in love when we were both married to other people,” she said. “Now that this has happened to me, I know a lot of people are like, ‘Well, karma’s a b**ch.'”\n\nWhen Tori and Dean costarred on Mind Over Murder in 2005, he was married to Mary Jo Eustace and in the process of adopting a child while Tori was married to Charlie Shanian.\n\nTori Spelling and Charlie Shanian’s wedding picture from People. The quote from Tori’s maid of honor says, “Charlie is so in tune with who Tori is. It’s wonderful to see her marry her perfect match.”\n\nIt had only been one year since Tori and Charlie’s $1-million wedding, but she said their marriage was unhappy. Charlie, however, said shortly after divorcing Tori that he was blindsided by her affair — which he only found out about through a tabloid.\n\n“Fifteen months into my marriage, I opened the National Enquirer to see pictures of what appeared to be my wife giving another man a lap dance,” he told GQ in 2007, two years after he filed for divorce. He said Tori told him she only got married because he “loved her and took care of her.”\n\nCharlie didn’t have as kind of feelings toward Dean as Tori now does for Emily: “In the end, I didn’t screw up, she did. Well, some might say she screwed down, but that’s a matter of opinion.”\n\nNow 45, Charlie seemed to retreat from the spotlight after the end of his marriage: He doesn’t have any acting credits since 2006 short film and his publishing profile still says he “lives in Los Angeles with his two dogs, three cats and one and only wife, Tori.”"
