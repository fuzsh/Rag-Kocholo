Tori Spelling’s husband has filed for divorce, a little more than a year after the couple married.

The couple separated last month. Actor-writer Charlie Shanian is seeking spousal support from Spelling, according to papers filed Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court.

Spelling, best known for her role as Donna on TV’s “Beverly Hills, 90210,” met Shanian on stage in 2002 during the Los Angeles production of his romantic comedy “Maybe, Baby It’s You.” The two were in 11 vignettes about couples in search of love.

They wed in July 2004 at her parents’ Holmby Hills home.

Spelling’s father is TV producer Aaron Spelling.
