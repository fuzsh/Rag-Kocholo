        "text": "The rumours surrounding Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s possible divorce surfaced online when the Bachchan family and Aishwarya arrived at Aaradhya’s annual function separately. The rumours intensified when Aishwarya arrived separately from her in-laws and husband at Ambani's wedding, fueling speculation about the couple's relationship. Now, fans have noticed another intriguing development in Abhishek's behaviour, which has raised questions and added further fuel to the speculation surrounding the couple's marital status.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan Likes A Divorce Post\n\nThe post that Abhishek Bachchan liked reads, “When love is no longer easy.' Moreover, the caption is even more intense. 'Divorce is not easy for anyone. Who doesn't dream of living happily ever after or imagine recreating heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands while crossing the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things?”\n\n“What drives them to sever ties, and what challenges do they face? This story delves into these questions. Coincidentally, ‘grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters’—terms for those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50—are on the rise globally. The reasons, though varied, are not surprising,” the post further read.\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan sparked curiosity when she made a solo appearance on the red carpet at the high-profile Ambani wedding, sans her husband Abhishek Bachchan and in-laws. Accompanied solely by her daughter Aaradhya, her arrival seemed to suggest a possible rift in the family. However, contrary to initial speculations, subsequent photos and videos from within the wedding venue revealed a different story altogether. It emerged that Aishwarya and Aaradhya had, in fact, joined Abhishek, Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, and Shweta Bachchan inside the venue, putting on a united front and dispelling any rumours of a family rift. The sequence of events left onlookers intrigued, with the initial separation on the red carpet giving way to a heartwarming display of family unity and togetherness.\n\nALSO READ: Filmfare Awards South 2024 Nominations: Salaar, Dasara, Ponniyin Selvan, Sapta Sagaradaache Ello & More Bag Top Spots"
