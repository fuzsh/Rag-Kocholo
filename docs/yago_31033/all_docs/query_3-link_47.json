        "text": "Amidst rumours of divorce between Bollywood star couple Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, an intriguing story from their wedding has surfaced.\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya tied the knot on 20 April 2007. At the time, Amitabh Bachchan’s mother, Teji Bachchan, was gravely ill, prompting the Bachchan family to opt for a simple wedding ceremony, Indian media reported.\n\nThe wedding was an intimate affair, attended by close relatives and friends, with many Bollywood personalities not receiving invitations. However, the Bachchan family sent well-wishes cards and sweets to the entire Bollywood industry post-wedding.\n\nSenior actor Shatrughan Sinha notably refused the wedding sweets. He said, “Those who had not been invited were not his friends in the first place. I won’t be put in second place and embarrass him by accepting the sweets.”\n\nRead also: ‘Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai may split’\n\nShatrughan then lashed out at the Bachchans, saying, “The least I expected was that either Amitabh or someone from the family would call me up before sending the sweets. When that was not done, why the mithai?”\n\nThe actor-turned-politician also spoke about all the celebrities who were not invited. He said, “Hema Malini was not invited, neither were Dharmendra and Ramesh Sippy. Half of the industry has stood by the Bachchans through thick and thin. All of us are currently in second place as Amitabh is being guided by a misguided missile called Amar Singh.”\n\nHowever, Amitabh Bachchan had later said that those who couldn’t understand their situation and why they were not invited to the wedding, weren’t his friends in the first place.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan, on the other hand, also spoke about Shatrughan Sinha returning the sweets. He said that the veteran actor was entitled to his opinions and if he didn’t want to keep it, he had a valid reason for it."
