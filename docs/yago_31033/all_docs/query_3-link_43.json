Abhishek posed with his family, including Amitabh, Jaya, and his sister's family. Aishwarya arrived later with their daughter, Aaradhya.\n\nSocial Media Activity Raises Eyebrows\n\nFollowing their separate appearances, Abhishek liked an Instagram post discussing rising divorce rates.

This interaction was quickly noticed by keen-eyed social media users, further fueling the rumors.\n\nPublic Absence and Ongoing Rumors\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya have not been seen together in public for some time. The latest wedding event, attended by many celebrities, highlighted their absence as a couple. The rumors of their separation have been circulating for a while and gained more attention with this recent incident.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya got married on April 20, 2007. They welcomed their daughter, Aaradhya, on November 16, 2011.
