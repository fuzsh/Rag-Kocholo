        "text": "Even though they've been married for almost seven years, the twosome, who have a daughter, look as cozy as ever. When asked in a new interview whether he ever feels insecure about being married to the most beautiful woman in the world, the actor gave the sweetest response.\n\n\"Not at all,\" said Bachchan. \"That's one of our greatest strengths as husband and wife. She is the most beautiful woman, nobody is lying. To me she is the most beautiful thing on earth... She is great fun; she is really my best friend. I can talk to her about everything and that's the reason I love her so much. I haven't married her because she is the most beautiful woman or the biggest stars on earth. That's not the equation we share.\""
