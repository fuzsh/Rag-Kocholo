        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan are celebrating their 14th wedding anniversary today, April 20. The couple is separated miles apart as Abhishek is shooting in Lucknow and Aishwarya is in Mumbai. They won't be able to spend the day together due to the rising Covid-19 cases in the country. However, their love and respect for each other have always given the current generation #CoupleGoals for 14 years. The story about how Abhishek proposed to Aishwarya is equally interesting.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHOW DID ABHISHEK PROPOSE TO AISHWARYA?\n\nAbhishek Bachchan was filming in New York. He used to stand on the balcony of his hotel room and wish that one day, it would be nice if he and Aishwarya are together, married. Years later, the couple were there for the premiere of Guru. After the premiere, they were back in the hotel. So, he took her to the very same balcony, and asked her to marry him.\n\nHowever, the ring he gave Aishwarya was no sparkling solitaire, but a prop from the sets of Guru. It was the same ring that he proposed with in Mani Ratnam's film. He in fact asked the producer if he could keep the ring, for sentimental reasons. She instantly said yes, and they have been enjoying marital bliss for 14 years now.\n\nWHAT DID AISHWARYA SAY ABOUT ABHISHEK?\n\nAishwarya Bachchan told a magazine in 2010, \"He is original and real, like our relationship. There is nothing predictable or boring about our life. We nurture each other. The gesture was spontaneous and meaningful. God has been kind to us. We can certainly afford those standard rocks. But do we need them?\"\n\nLike any regular couple, Abhishek and Aishwarya's relationship too is not devoid of any fights, though short-lived ones. \"We argue and fight over such trivial things, nothing major. I can't carry a sulk for too long. After any argument, it's generally me who breaks the ice by asking Abhishek for some advice or the other. Besides, technology has made things so much easier, what are emotions for,\" she had said.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan, in recent interviews, had revealed that Aishwarya doesn't like to watch his films before they release. He also appreciated her for 'training' their daughter on how to handle media attention. Abhishek and Aishwarya have worked together in films like Dhai Akshar Prem Ke (2000), Kuch Naa Kaho (2003), Umrao Jaan (2006) and Dhoom 2 (2006), Guru (2007) and Raavan (2010), among others.\n\nALSO READ | Abhishek Bachchan says Aishwarya put his life 'into focus' and 'back on track' last year"
