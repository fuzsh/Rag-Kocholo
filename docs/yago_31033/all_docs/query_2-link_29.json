        "text": "When Aishwarya And Abhishek Fell In Love\n\nA lot of people believe that Abhishek and Aishwarya fell in love at first sight and then went on to marry each other. But the truth is that the two were great friends as they worked together for movies like Dhai Akshar Prem Ke, Kuch Na Kaho. It was when they appeared in movies like Dhoom 2, Umrao Jaan and Guru that they fell in love with each other. It was after that their love story began.\n\nAbhishek's Romantic Proposal\n\nAbhishek proposed to Aishwarya while they were out in New York for their movie Guru's premiere. In an interview, Abhishek shared, “I was filming in New York for a movie. And, I used to stand on the balcony of my hotel room and wish that, 'One day, wouldn't it be nice if I was together with her, married. Years later, we were there for the premiere of Guru. After the premiere, we were back in the hotel. So, I took her to the very same balcony, and I asked her to marry me.”\n\nTheir Intimate Wedding\n\nThe Bachchans decided to keep it all simple for Aishwarya and Abhishek's wedding because reportedly some actress names Janhvi had attempted suicide claiming that she was married to Junior Bachchan. The wedding ceremonies took place at the Bachchan residence. The wedding took place in a Mangalore style and saw big names from Bollywood and Politics in attendance.

Aishwarya's kiss with Hrithik in the movie Dhoom 2 is believed to have created a lot of tension in the Bachchan family. There were also rumours that Aishwarya married a tree to ward off the ill effects of being a Manglik girl.\n\nToday, the two stand strong with each other, as they pass through all the different phases. They also have a beautiful baby Aaradhya. Their love story still makes all of us go aww! The couple is adored by all for their love and commitment towards each other.\n\nRecommended Video\n\nWhat do you love the most about the power couple? Share your thoughts with us.
