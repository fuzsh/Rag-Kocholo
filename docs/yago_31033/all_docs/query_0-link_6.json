        "text": "Looks like there is some truth in divorce rumours! Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai are headed for a divorce or so it seems after their last public appearance in which the two didn’t attend a wedding together. While Abhishek posed with his family including father Amitabh, mother Jaya, sister and her family, Aishwarya Rai came later to the wedding with her daughter Aaradhya Bachchan.\n\nPost the separate public appearances, Abhishek fuelled divorce rumours as he liked an article on Instagram on rising divorce cases. The post was shared by a journalist on the social media platform.\n\nWhat was the social media post about?\n\nThe Instagram post read, \"When love stops being easy.\" The caption read, \"Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn’t dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things?\"\n\nAbhishek Bachchan liked the social media post and hawk-eyed social media users noticed the same.\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya have not been seen together for a while now. The separation rumours have been doing the rounds and the issue escalated in the most recent wedding of an Indian billionaire’s son’s wedding which saw the whos-who of the entertainment world attend.\n\nAlso read: Bhumi Pednekar, Sonam Bajwa call out unfair trolling of Aishwarya Rai on her fashion choices\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan tied the knot on April 20, 2007. They welcomed Aaradhya on November 16, 2011.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan's films\n\nOn the work front, Abhishek Bachchan will next be seen in Shah Rukh Khan film, King. It is said that Abhishek will play a negative role in it. The film will also reportedly star Shah Rukh's daughter Suhana Khan. King is likely to be directed by Sujoy Ghosh.\n\nAlso read: Bad Newz: Censor Board orders modification of Vicky Kaushal-Triptii Dimri's intimate scenes\n\nAbhishek will also be seen in Housefull 5.
