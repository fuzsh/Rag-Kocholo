        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan ‘Likes’ Post on Divorce Amid Aishwarya Rai’s Solo Appearance at Ambani Wedding\n\nAbhishek Bachchan recently captured the attention of fans after he liked a social media post discussing the challenges of divorce and the rising trend of ‘grey divorces.’ This action came just days after his wife, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, attended Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s wedding alone.\n\nThe post, shared by author Heena Khandelwal, featured an image with the words, “When love stops being easy. Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?” The accompanying caption highlighted the increasing cases of divorce, especially among older couples.\n\nThe post delved into the emotional and practical difficulties of divorcing after many years of marriage. It noted the growing phenomenon of ‘grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters,’ referring to those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50. The reasons for this trend, though varied, are becoming more common worldwide.\n\nAbhishek’s ‘like’ on the post quickly drew reactions. A screenshot of his interaction was shared on Reddit, prompting a flurry of comments. While some speculated about potential marital issues, others defended Abhishek, suggesting it might have been a casual ‘like’ without personal implications. One social media user commented in amazement, “Kaise tum log itna observe kar lete ho yaar…just howowowow,” while another added, “(It) could just be a general like on a topic/post that makes sense.”\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan’s solo appearance at the high-profile wedding also sparked curiosity. She walked the red carpet with her daughter, Aaradhya, while Abhishek posed for photographers with Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan, and Shweta Bachchan. However, inside the venue, Aishwarya and Aaradhya were seen reuniting with Abhishek, attending the event together.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have been married for 17 years, making their relationship a subject of public interest. The recent events and Abhishek’s social media activity have fueled speculation, but it remains unclear whether there is any deeper meaning behind his online interactions."
