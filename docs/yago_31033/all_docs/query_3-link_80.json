        "text": "Photo- ANI\n\nWhen love brew\n\nThe gradual transition from being friends to partners reportedly took place in 2006-2007, where in a period of one year, three of their films were released. It was during this phase, that they got an opportunity to know each other inside-out.\n\nAt that point, no one knew that the on-screen chemistry between the two lead actors in 'Dhoom 2', 'Umrao Jaan' and 'Guru', was soon going to change into a real-life relationship.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nThe first Bachchan ensemble\n\nThe first time we got to see Abhishek, Amitabh and the would-be Mrs Bachchan together on screen was during 'Bunty Aur Babli' (2005).\n\nThe iconic song 'Kajra Re' where the father-son duo rocks the stage with the ever-beautiful Aishwarya is one of the most memorable moments in the 'Abhi-Aish' timeline.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nEngagement and Wedding\n\nAfter the proposal, the couple had secretly gotten engaged on January 14, 2007, at the Bachchan's residence. After their engagement, Aishwarya quite frequently used to meet the Bachchans.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nIn the span of a few months, the couple went ahead with their highly-anticipated wedding on April 20, 2007. Aishwarya looked heavenly in the beautiful golden Kanjeevaram saree and traditional jewellery, with the ensemble made by fashion designer Neeta Lulla.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\n'Abhi-Aish' at Cannes\n\nIn May 2007, the couple walked their first ever Cannes red carpet together. The charming duo appeared hand-in-hand at the event, setting major couple goals and winning many hearts.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nMilan Fashion Week\n\nIn 2010, the couple were sitting in the first row with international stars at the Giorgio Armani fashion show at the Milan Fashion Week.\n\nWhile Aishwarya wore wide-legged velvet Armani trousers paired with a smart black satin jacket and a simple clutch, Abhishek chose a black suit with a white shirt.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nThe Oscars\n\nVacationing in Los Angeles, the couple got an invitation to the Academy Awards aka Oscars.\n\n\"What a great interruption to have, I think. It's been wonderful, it's a bit cold in LA which is unusual but it's wonderful, it's so nice, very sweet of them to invite us and recognise our film industry and we're very happy to be here representing India,\" Abhishek said at the event.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nWelcoming their first child\n\nAfter four years of being married, Abhishek and Aishwarya welcomed their daughter, Aaradhya, into the world on November 16, 2011.\n\nBoth Aishwarya and Abhishek have been vocal about how grateful they are for Aaradhya coming into their life. When Aishwarya made her debut on Instagram, she had posted a monochrome picture with Aaradhya when she was born and had captioned it as 'I was born again.'\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nGraceful public appearances\n\nAfter the birth of their daughter Aaradhya, Abhishek and Aishwarya were spotted together on several occasions.\n\nIn 2012, on Amitabh Bachchan's 70th birthday, Aradhya made her first public appearance along with her mother Aishwarya.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nIn 2014, Abhishek and Aishwarya were seen at the Pro Kabaddi League supporting their team Jaipur Pink Panthers.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nIn 2016, Aaradhya and her parents were seen together at a Durga Puja event, and in 2017, they were spotted entering the Siddhivinayak temple.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nAlso in 2017, they were seen at the Ambani's Ganpati party.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nIt's been 15 years since Abhishek and Aishwarya tied the knot and the couple never fails to embrace their love for each other.\n\nIn a recent interview with ANI, Abhishek shared how Aishwarya taught him to focus on positivity in life, especially while dealing with negative criticism.\n\n\"My wife once told me that, 'you get 10,000 positive comments but you get affected by one negative comment. You should concentrate on positivity and experience the beauty of the positive world'. So, I always try to look at things with positivity,\" he had said.\n\nPhoto- ANI\n\nTalking about their work front, Aishwarya will be making her comeback with 'Raavan' director Mani Ratnam for the Tamil film 'Ponniyin Selvan', a historical drama that also stars Jayam Ravi, Chiyaan Vikram, and Keerthy Suresh.\n\nOn the other hand, Abhishek recently starred in 'Dasvi' which gained some appreciation from fans. He will be next seen in a new season of Amazon Prime's 'Breathe'.\n\nREAD ALSO:\n\nB-town celebs aced the style game with these gym looks\n\nAlia Bhatt returns to work post wedding, resumes shooting for 'Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani'\n\nAjay Devgn, Kajol drop stunning pictures of Nysa on her 19th birthday\n\nAjay Devgn announces his next venture 'Bholaa'\n\nAishwarya Rai abhishek bachhan Bollywood"
