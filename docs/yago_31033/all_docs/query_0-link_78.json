        "text": "The low-profile actor, who has a considerable following on social media – 6.7 million on Instagram and 15.4 million on Twitter – was among several stars who tested positive for Covid-19 in 2020, as did his father, wife and daughter Aaradhya. Such is the Bachchan name and its dizzying fandom that millions of people prayed for their recovery.\n\nMeanwhile Aishwarya seems to be taking a break since she recovered from Covid-19. The actress, who has kept a low profile these past few months, was seen with Abhishek and Aaradhya in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, a few weeks ago. It reportedly was the first time she left Mumbai since the city went into lockdown in March 2020. The actress will next be seen in the Tamil historical film Ponniyin Selvan, due out in late 2021.\n\nBut it’s for something else that Bachchan junior is in the spotlight: the professional kabaddi team, Jaipur Pink Panthers (JPP), which he bought in 2014, and which went on to win the inaugural Pro Kabaddi League the same year. Kabaddi is a traditional Indian contact sport that seemed to be dying a slow death - until Abhishek trained a light on it.\n\nSo popular are the JPP (the team even boasts a Korean player, Dong Gyu Kim) that Amazon launched a series, Sons of the Soil: Jaipur Panthers, directed by Briton Alex Gale.\n\nThe unscripted documentary offers an “unfiltered” – according to Abhishek – behind-the-scenes peek into the indigenous game and its steady transformation from forgotten to famous and commercially viable. It is an astonishing success in a country refuses to end its obsessive love affair with cricket.\n\nThe road has not been without challenges. Abhishek, who is said to be “hands on” in his involvement with the prized team, says in the documentary: “I ask myself why do I put myself through this? The agony, the ecstasy, the highs and the lows, and the heartbreak.”\n\nBut the game drew more than 400 million viewers during the inaugural season, and kabaddi has grown in stature to become the second-most popular sport in India.\n\nAbhishek also has the lead role in the upcoming biopic The Big Bull, about the life and financial crimes of infamous Indian stockbroker Harshad Mehta."
