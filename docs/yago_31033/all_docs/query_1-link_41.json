        "text": "Among the many priceless gifts Bollywood has given to mankind, are the inexplicable urge to dance in chiffon saris on the Swiss Alps and impossibly beautiful couples who set unrealistic expectations for our future amorous prospects.\n\nFalling into the latter category is Abhishek Bachchan, who has been happily married to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan for the past 10 years. An otherwise non-controversial character, Abhishek has quietly spent the past decade ruining things for Indian boyfriends and husbands everywhere. How, you ask? Why, how convenient that we have all the reasons neatly listed right here.\n\nAbhishek isn’t threatened by Aishwarya’s success\n\nNot only does his wife inhabit the rarified air at the very top of Bollywood’s food chain, but she’s also a beloved international celebrity having starred in movies like The Pink Panther 2 and Bride and Prejudice. Abhishek proudly wears the badge of ‘Aishwarya’s Number 1 Cheerleader’, even shutting down the trolls who’ve tried to compare his success with that of his wife, “Where’s the comparison with Aishwarya? She isn’t as popular as me, she is more popular. She’s a bigger star than I am. I’m very happy and proud about it.”\n\nAbhishek puts his money where his mouth is\n\nIt isn’t all gushing declarations in newsprint and on Twitter. Abhishek takes time out to accompany Aishwarya to her events around the world, happy to let her have all the limelight. He once said, “Do you ever ask Aishwarya why she walks the red carpets with me at the premieres of my films? She attends all my events, but I cannot accompany her. That’s wrong. If my wife supports me, then it’s my duty to support her.” Are you listening, future prospects?\n\nHe’s not PDA-intolerant\n\nAccording to the laws of millenial relationships, you aren’t really in love unless half your social media posts are dedicated to your significant other. Proving he’s on top of trends, Abhishek’s SMDA (Social Media Display of Affection) has been consistently off the charts, posting photos of his wife, celebrating different milestones and sometimes, just reminding the world that he seriously lucked out. Does your man create a social media plan to cement your importance in his life? We have a feeling we already know the answer to that.\n\nTroll his woman and he will come for you\n\nA good partner is one who accepts you in every form. A better partner is one who stands up for you in the face of public bullying. Case in point, the fat-shaming Aishwarya endured after giving birth to daughter Aradhya. “I just think it’s extremely insensitive and no one has the liberty to speak about her like the way they sometimes do. Yes, she’s a public figure, but people forget she’s also a woman and now a mother and there’s a line that’s not to be crossed. I don’t talk that way about any woman ever and it’s obviously not graceful for anyone to talk about her like that either,” Abhishek said in an interview.\n\nHe sets an example for his colleagues and contemporaries\n\nAbhishek’s “supportive husband” bit isn’t just to impress the public. Close friends and colleagues can vouch for his behaviour being consistent. When asked which Bollywood star was the ideal husband, even Sonam Kapoor didn’t have to rack her brains, saying. “I think he (Abhishek) is an amazing husband. He loves her and respects her. He is also very open-minded.”"
