        "text": "The star-studded wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant at the Jio World Convention Centre continues to make headlines, especially with a new photo of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, and Hrithik Roshan going viral. The image has sparked discussions, particularly in light of Aishwarya’s separate arrival from the rest of the Bachchan family.\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan made a solo appearance at the grand wedding, accompanied only by her daughter, Aaradhya. This move raised eyebrows as Abhishek Bachchan arrived with his parents and legendary actors Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan and his sister Shweta Bachchan Nanda’s family. Aishwarya was seen posing alone and later with Aaradhya, adding to the intrigue surrounding her separate entrance.\n\nHowever, the recently surfaced photo shows a different scene. Aishwarya is seen standing next to Abhishek, who is seated with Aaradhya beside him. The picture captures a candid moment with Hrithik Roshan sitting next to Abhishek, looking away. The viral photo has caught the attention of fans and netizens alike.\n\nAishwarya also made a solo appearance at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s Shubh Aashirwad ceremony today. The event, held at the Jio World Convention Centre, saw the former Miss World donning a vibrant black suit adorned with colourful embroidery. Her look was completed with a statement necklace and a traditional maang teeka, exuding elegance and grace. This unusual move raised eyebrows once again, especially since Amitabh Bachchan, Navya Naveli Nanda and Nikhil Nanda had earlier arrived together. The senior Bachchan was also seen posing with his granddaughter Navya at the Shubh Aashirwad ceremony.\n\nMeanwhile, Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s wedding was a grand affair, attended by some of the biggest names in the entertainment industry. Bollywood stars like Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Ranveer Singh, Deepika Padukone, Ranbir Kapoor, and Alia Bhatt graced the event with their presence. The gathering also featured international sensation Kim Kardashian, adding a global touch to the celebration. In an unexpected twist, WWE superstar John Cena made an appearance."
