        "text": "No wonder they're called Bollywood's Brangelina!\n\nAishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan grace the cover of Masala magazine's May 2014 issue, and the couple look pretty darn glamorous if we do say so ourselves.\n\nThe cover headline says, \"Abhi & Ash celebrate 7 years: Inside Bollywood's most famous marriage,\" referring to the wedding anniversary the hot couple celebrated on April 20.\n\nIt's true that both are looking better than ever: in the photo, Ash dazzles in an off-the-shoulder black gown and accessorizes with a blinding jeweled cuff while her movie star husband looks dashing in a blue three-piece suit with a black trim.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBollywood's most sought after couple also cover the mag because both will be attending the 2014 Cannes Film Festival, which runs from May 14 to May 25.\n\nThis will be Aishwarya's umpteenth time at the glam event. Last year, the 40-year-old L'Oreal spokesperson dazzled with her fashion prowess on many a red carpet (we still can't stop thinking about her amazing gold sari)."
