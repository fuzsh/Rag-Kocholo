        "text": "MUMBAI: For a few months now, reports of a fracture in Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's marriage have been making headlines. There is a lot of conjecture that something is wrong with the couple. But according to recent sources, Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan would never formally file for divorce.\n\nAlso Read- What! When Saif Ali Khan opened up about his ex wife Amrita Singh not letting him meet his children Sara and Ibrahim; “Each time I look at their pictures, I feel like crying”\n\nThe fact that the Bachchan family has never before experienced a divorce is among the primary reasons Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan would never part ways. This is believed to be one of the main reasons Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan decided against getting divorced despite a reported falling out.\n\nShweta Bachchan and her husband, Karisma Kapoor's relative Nikhil Nanda, had a falling out when Abhishek Bachchan and Karisma Kapoor broke off their engagement. Even though Nikhil Nanda lives in Delhi and Shweta Bachchan spends most of her time in Mumbai, the couple is still married and frequently seen together at public occasions.\n\nThere have been rumors of a falling out between Amitabh Bachchan and Jaya Bachchan throughout the years, but these rumors have never had an impact on their marriage.\n\nAlthough neither Abhishek Bachchan nor Aishwarya Rai Bachchan have publicly acknowledged any breach, many fans believe that even if the pair led different lives, they would not file for divorce because it would be against the Bachchan family custom.\n\nAlso Read-What! When Saif Ali Khan revealed he was asked to breakup with Amrita Singh for his debut film, “It was a moral choice”\n\nFor more news and updates from the world of television, OTT, and movies, stay tuned to TellyChakkar.\n\nCredit- DNA"
