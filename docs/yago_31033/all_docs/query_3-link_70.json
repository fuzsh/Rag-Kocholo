        "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan relocates from Bachchan abode -marriage trouble with Abhishek Bachchan\n\nAll seems to be not well with\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Married life seems to be in doldrums.\n\nSource close to the Bachchans reveal that Aishwarya Rai has relocated from the Bachchan House amid marriage trouble with Abhishek Bachchan.\n\nThe fresh development comes days after speculations around the Bollywood couple’s divorce rumors, which began after Jr. Bachchan was spotted without his wedding ring.\n\nHuman relationships are fragile and at times face various challenges. When a marriage breaks down, it can be disheartening for both partners, especially when there are children involved.\n\nHowever, the latest reports suggest that regardless the trouble in paradise, Abhishek and Aish are not considering divorce as they aim to be the best parents to their 12-year-old Aradhya Bachchan.\n\nA source close to the Bachchan family reveal a quoted in a section of the media that it is for their child that Abhishek and Aishwarya are still together. They have been having problems for years. Now matters have come to a head.\n\nAfter moving out of the Bachchan residence, Aishwarya divides her time between her mother’s house and Jalsa, where she stays in a separate wing from her in-laws with her husband and daughter, the report further added. It also states that Ash has ceased all communication with Jaya Bachchan. In the midst of this saas-bahu tumult, it’s apparently Abhishek who continues to suffer, as he aims to be a devoted son while also trying the best of his abilities to be a good husband to his wife and a doting father to his daughter.\n\nAlthough there has been a conflict in the Bachchan house for some time now, the decision of the Bachchans’ daughter Shweta to permanently move into Jalsa was reportedly the final nail in the coffin for Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.\n\nNevertheless, for Aish and Abhishek, who have been married for sixteen years now, a divorce is not on the cards. However, the growing distance amidst them continues to concern their well-wishers.\n\nMeanwhile, in spite of the emotional turmoil of their marriage, Abhishek and Aishwarya recently posed together at the premiere of\n\nThe Archies, which marked the debut of Shweta Bachchan and Nikhil Nanda’s son, Agastya Nanda.\n\nNews Edit K.V.Raman"
