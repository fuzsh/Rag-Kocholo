        "text": "PTC Web Desk: Speculation about the relationship status of power couple Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan has been circulating for some time, and recent social media activity by Abhishek has added fuel to the fire.\n\nThe actor liked a post on Instagram that discussed divorce, which has intensified rumors of trouble in their marriage. The post, titled “Why love stops being easy,” explored the rising trend of long-married couples deciding to part ways, particularly focusing on the phenomenon of “grey divorces” or “silver splitters,” which refers to marital dissolutions typically occurring after the age of 50.\n\nThe post highlighted the emotional and logistical difficulties associated with divorce, especially for couples who have spent significant portions of their lives together. It addressed the common dream of a lifelong partnership and the challenges faced when such dreams are shattered. The side note of the post poignantly stated, “Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn't dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street?\"\n\nThe main text continued, \"Yet, sometimes life doesn't unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things? What drives them to sever ties, and what challenges do they face? This story delves into these questions. Coincidentally, ‘grey divorces' or ‘silver splitters'—terms for those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50—are on the rise globally. The reasons, though varied, are not surprising.”\n\nDespite the ongoing speculation, neither Abhishek nor Aishwarya has confirmed or denied the divorce rumors. Their silence on the matter has left fans and media speculating about the true state of their relationship.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan were married in a grand ceremony in 2007 at Prateeksha, the Juhu bungalow of Abhishek's father, megastar Amitabh Bachchan. Their wedding was a significant event in the Indian entertainment industry, attracting considerable media attention. The couple welcomed their first child, Aaradhya, in November 2011, marking a joyous addition to their family.\n\nOn their 17th wedding anniversary in April this year, Aishwarya shared a throwback picture from their engagement ceremony on social media. The photo, which only showed their hands, was accompanied by a simple caption of emojis, suggesting a nostalgic reflection on their journey together. The couple has also shared the screen in several films, including “Guru,” “Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke,” “Kuch Naa Kaho,” “Dhoom 2,” and “Umrao Jaan,” showcasing their on-screen chemistry and collaborative professional relationship.\n\nAs the rumors continue to swirl, fans and followers of the couple are left hoping for clarity. Whether the speculation is true or not, the public remains intrigued by the lives of Abhishek and Aishwarya, who have been prominent figures in the Indian film industry for many years. Their relationship, both personal and professional, has been a subject of fascination and admiration, and any developments in their story are sure to be closely watched.\n\n- With inputs from agencies"
