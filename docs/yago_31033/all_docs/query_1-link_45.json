        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan reacted to an Instagram post about divorce amid speculations of separation with his wife-actor Aishwarya Rai. A journalist uploaded the post on the social media. She took to Instagram to share a piece written for the Eye magazine of Indian Express.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan likes post about divorce\n\n\"When love stops being easy,\" the words on the post read. The caption of the post read, \"Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn’t dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things?\"\n\nIt also read, \"What drives them to sever ties, and what challenges do they face? This story delves into these questions. Coincidentally, ‘grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters’—terms for those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50—are on the rise globally. The reasons, though varied, are not surprising.\"\n\nAbhishek Bachchan reacted to the post by clicking the \"like\" button, which has fueled divorce speculation.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai divorce rumour\n\nIt has been a while since the separation rumours started circulating on social media. On July 12, when the couple showed up separately for the Ambani wedding held at the Jio Convention Centre in Mumbai. During the star-studded wedding of Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant, Aishwarya made a stunning appearance with her daughter, Aaradhya. Meanwhile, Abhishek reached the venue with his father, Amitabh Bachchan, and mother, Jaya Bachchan. They were accompanied by her sister Shweta Bachchan, her husband Nikhil Nanda, and their children, Navya Nanda and Agastya Nanda.\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya got married on April 20, 2007. They welcomed their daughter ,Aaradhya, on November 16, 2011."
