        "text": "'Ohoo... that title is... my god!'\n\nIn the video, Aishwarya is taken aback when a journalist introduces her as \"Rai Bachchan.\" She responds, \"Ohoo... that title is... my god! Just regular Aishwarya, the way you have known me.\" When asked if \"Rai Bachchan\" is her official surname, she clarified, \"Aishwarya Rai, as it has been professionally known, who got married to Abhishek Bachchan. So, obviously, Aishwarya Bachchan. Make what you want out of it.\"\n\nSeparation rumors fueled by Abhishek's social media activity\n\nThe resurfacing of this video comes amid rumors of a possible separation between Aishwarya and Abhishek. Speculation was further fueled when Abhishek liked an Instagram post about divorce. The post, shared by author Heena Khandelwal, discussed the rise of \"grey divorces\" or divorces among couples over 50. According to Redditors, Abhishek liked the post because it featured inputs from Dr. Zirak Marker, a close friend of Aishwarya.\n\nJaya Bachchan recently sparked row over 'Amitabh' mention"
