        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAbhishek Bachchan recently liked an Instagram post about divorce, leading to speculation about marital issues with his wife, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. However, it has been clarified that his like was in support of Dr. Zirak Marker, a close friend of Aishwarya and a contributor to the article referenced in the post. This explanation has reassured fans, debunking rumors of any trouble in their marriage.\n\nA recent social media activity by Abhishek Bachchan has sparked widespread speculation about potential troubles in his marriage to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The actor's simple act of liking a post about divorce led to numerous rumors of their possible separation. However, the true story behind this 'like' has now emerged, providing much-needed clarity for their fans.\n\nThe Instagram post in question, shared by author Heena Khandelwal, discussed the complexities and rising trend of 'grey divorces,' where older couples decide to part ways after many years of marriage. The post's caption posed a poignant question about the challenges couples face when love becomes difficult.\n\nGiven the sensitivity of the topic, Abhishek's engagement with the post quickly attracted attention, leading to speculation about his own marital status.\n\nClarification From Reddit\n\nA Reddit thread has shed light on the real reason behind Abhishek's 'like.' It turns out that Dr. Zirak Marker, a renowned psychiatrist and a close friend of Aishwarya Rai, contributed to the article referenced in the Instagram post.\n\nAbhishek's like was a gesture of support for Dr. Marker rather than an indication of any personal marital issues.\n\nFans expressed their relief on Reddit. One user commented, \"So this divorce post, which people took as a confirmation of divorce, is him being a supportive partner and therefore may be a confirmation of not being divorced.\"\n\nThe real reason why Abhishek liked that IG post: Aishwarya’s longtime friend Zirak Marker contributed to the article.\n\nbyu/goldengirlsunehri inBollyBlindsNGossip\n\nAnother added, \"Was I the only one who always felt there was no deeper meaning to him liking the post and was just general appreciation for the post?\"\n\nWho Is Dr. Zirak Marker?\n\nDr. Zirak Marker is a prominent psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, known for his work with both adults and children. He has a long-standing friendship with Aishwarya Rai, dating back to their college days at Mumbai's Jai Hind College. Aishwarya even launched his book, \"Parenting in the Age of Anxiety,\" in 2016. Dr. Marker and his wife, parent coach Priya Marker, are often seen vacationing with Aishwarya, Abhishek, and their daughter Aaradhya.\n\nBachchans At Anant Ambani Wedding\n\nFurther fueling rumors were the appearances of Abhishek and Aishwarya at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding ceremony. While Abhishek arrived with his parents, Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, and sister Shweta Bachchan Nanda, Aishwarya and Aaradhya arrived separately. This separation led to speculation, but they were later seen together inside the venue, dispelling the rumors of any discord.\n\nOn the professional front, Abhishek Bachchan is set to appear as the main antagonist in Sujoy Ghosh's upcoming film, \"King,\" and in Shoojit Sircar's next project. Meanwhile, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan was last seen in \"Ponniyin Selvan: II.\"\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nHero, Bajaj, and TVS rev up electric scooter play.
