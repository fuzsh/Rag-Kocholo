        "text": "Bollywood's most loved couple Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan have managed to grab everyone's attention with their separation rumours. The entire Bachchan clan arrived together at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding. But, Aishwarya arrived with her daughter Aaradhya alone. She even posed for pictures with Aaradhya and not with her family. Well, this raised eyebrows and rumours of Abhishek and Aishwarya's separation spread like wildfire. But, here we have good news as inside pictures and videos from the wedding are doing rounds on the social media.\n\nBollywoodLife brings top Entertainment news and TV News.

Aishwarya and Aaradhya's absence from the Bachchan family reignited rumorus about their family issues. In the inside pictures and videos from the wedding, Aishwarya Rai is sitting in between, while her daughter Aaradhya is sitting on the left and her husband Abhishek is on the right. The pictures and videos come as a sight of relief for their fans.\n\nA look at inside videos\n\nAbhishek and aishwarya together!!!!!!\n\nbyu/Lamplightqueen inBollyBlindsNGossip\n\nThe video shared by a user on the Reddit page BollyBlindsNGossip showcases them together. But as per rumours the two sat together but did not speak much. Aishwarya was seen talking to other guests around. One user commented, 'They aren’t divorced so not surprised they are seated together. I didn’t believe the rumours either but it was way too obvious yesterday'. Other said, 'Both aish and abhishek aren’t wearing their wedding ring. Their marriage is over . But I think they are still cordial for aaradhya'. Third user wrote, 'A happily married man doesn’t let his wife and child arrive alone together at events no matter what living arrangements they may have. He could have gone to meet her. There are also no shots of her interacting with his family, yet they are at the same event. If they are still together, the fact that he chose to arrive with his family and let them arrive alone definitely speaks volumes about his priorities'.\n\nAnant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s wedding was a star studded affair including Shah Rukh Khan, preggers Deepika Padukone, Ranbir Kapoor to Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, John Cena and PM Narendra Modi and more.\n\nHere's a video from Anant Ambani, Radhika Merchant's wedding:\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan tied the knot in 2007.
