        "text": "Abhishek Bachchan recently drew attention after liking a post on social media that discussed the difficulties of divorce and the increasing trend of ‘grey divorces.’ Abhishek’s online activity comes just a few days after his actress-wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan made a solo appearance at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant’s wedding.\n\nThe post, shared by authors Heena Khandelwal, featured an image with the words, “When love stops being easy. Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?” The picture was shared with the caption about the article on the rising divorce cases.\n\n“Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn’t dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things? What drives them to sever ties, and what challenges do they face? This story delves into these questions. Coincidentally, ‘grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters’—terms for those seeking marital dissolution typically after age 50—are on the rise globally. The reasons, though varied, are not surprising,” the post read.\n\nAbhishek was one of the many people who ‘liked’ the post. This move raised eyebrows. A screenshot of the same was shared on Reddit and several people took to the comments section to weigh in. While many speculated for the worse, there were also a few who defended Abhishek and said that it might be a general ‘like’ and not related to anything personal. “Kaise tum log itna observe kar lete ho yaar…just howowowow,” a social media user said in awe. “(It) could just be a general like on a topic/post that makes sense,” another added.\n\nAishwarya raised eyebrows when she walked on the red carpet of the Ambani wedding without the Bachchan family members. She was seen accompanied by her daughter, Aaradhya, moments after Abhishek posed for the cameras with Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and Shweta Bachchan. However, in videos and photos from inside the wedding venue, it was revealed that Aishwarya and Aaradhya reunited with Abhishek and attended the wedding together.\n\nAbhishek and Aishwarya have been married for 17 years now."
