The rumours of their separation have been going around for a while now, and the rumoured news of Aishwarya moving out of the Bachchan house and netizens noticing Abhishek Bachchan liking a post on divorce have fueled them further.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan Likes Instagram Post On Divorce\n\nRecently, a journalist shared anarticle for Indian Express' Eye magazine on social media which was liked by Abhishek Bachchan. The post was about\"When love stops being easy,\" captioned, \"Divorce is never easy for anyone. Who doesn’t dream of a happily ever after or envision recreating those heartwarming videos of elderly couples holding hands as they cross the street? Yet, sometimes life doesn’t unfold as we hoped. But how do people cope when they separate after decades together, after spending a significant portion of their lives relying on each other for both big and small things?\" The netizens have linked Abhishek's liking this post with the separation rumours.\n\nDuty As Parents\n\nMarried for 16 years, the couple is parents to their adorable daughter, Aaradhya.

Before getting hitched with Aishwarya, he was engaged to Karisma Kapoor but their relationship was short-lived.\n\nAmitabh Bachchan Unfollowed Aishwarya Rai\n\nRecently, the netizens could not find Amitabh Bachchan amongst Aishwarya’s Instagram followers which led to the suspicions of divorce between Aishwarya and Abhishek, and the Bachchan family feuds.\n\nSaas-Bahu At War\n\nAccording to the rumours over time, there’s no love lost between Aishwarya Rai and her mother-in-law, Jaya Bachchan. Apparently, they don’t get along well and this is also believed to be one of the major reasons behind the couple’s rumoured divorce.\n\nBacklash From The In-Laws For Bold Scenes\n\nAccording to the reports, Aishwarya faced a lot of backlash from her in-laws after her film, Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, because of the bold scenes.\n\nRai’s, Bachchan’s And Nanda’s Spotted Together\n\nAmidst the rumours of divorce, Rai’s, Bachchan’s and Nanda’s were spotted together last night arriving at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School to cheer for Aaradhya who gave a stellar performance at the school’s annual function.\n\nIf you liked this story then please share it.
