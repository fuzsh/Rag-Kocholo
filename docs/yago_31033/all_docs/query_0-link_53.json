After these images, the news of the divorce between the two was dismissed, but now Abhishek's new step has troubled fans.\n\nAccording to Indian media, Abhishek Bachchan has liked an article on the divorce of Indian woman Henna Khandelwal. The journalist had posted this article on her Instagram handle.\n\nThe article about divorce stated that for a long time, couples bound in marriage are now separating, so what is the thing that is forcing them to make this decision?\n\nAmong the likes of this post is also the name of Abhishek Bachchan; some fans speculated that Abhishek and Aishwarya Rai have divorced, while some said that the actor is considering divorce.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai got married in 2007, and their daughter Aaradhya was born in 2011.\n\nPreviously, Bollywood's former golden couple, Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai, sent fans into a frenzy when a photo of them together at Anant Ambani's wedding surfaced online. The lavish ceremony, hosted by India's wealthiest businessman Mukesh Ambani on July 12, was attended by numerous Bollywood stars and international celebrities.\n\nAishwarya Rai, accompanied by her daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, was seen posing for photographs, while the rest of the Bachchan family also made a separate appearance. However, it was a viral image of Aishwarya holding Salman Khan's hand, with Salman's sister Arpita Khan Sharma also in the frame, that captured everyone's attention.\n\nThe image sparked wild speculation and joy among fans, with many wondering if the two stars were considering rekindling their romance."
