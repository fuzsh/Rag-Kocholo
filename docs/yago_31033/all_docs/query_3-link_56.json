        "text": "Mumbai: It's a special day for Bollywood lovebirds Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan as they have completed 16 years of married life. Marking the special occasion, the duo took to their respective Instagram handles and dropped a beautiful selfie. In the picture, the couple is seen flashing their million-dollar smile as they twin in white.\n\nFor the caption, Abhishek simply put, \"16.\" He also added nazar amulet emoji and a toffee emoji. On the other hand, Aishwarya in her caption wrote, \"Sweet 16.\" Fond of emojis, she dropped a string of red heart emojis as well in her caption. The couple's anniversary post garnered several likes and comments from the netizens.\n\n\"Congratulations and best wishes,\" a social media user commented. \"Lovely couple,\" another one wrote. Aishwarya and Abhishek's wedding took place in a private ceremony at Prateeksha, Amitabh's bungalow in Mumbai. After four years of their marriage, the couple became parents to a daughter, Aaradhya, on November 16, 2011.\n\nAlso read: Delhi HC restrains YouTube channels from sharing fake news on Aaradhya Bachchan\n\nMeanwhile, on the work front, Aishwarya will be seen reprising her role in Ponniyin Selvan-Part 2.
