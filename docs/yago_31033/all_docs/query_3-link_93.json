        "meta_description": "A video claiming that Abhishek Bachchan announced his divorce from Aishwarya Rai has gone viral online. The video, which features noticeable lip-syncing issues, spread rapidly and has been widely condemned by netizens who suspect it may be a fake. Abhishek is not alone in facing AI-related manipulation; earlier, celebrities such as Aamir Khan, Ranveer Singh, Rashmika Mandanna, Katrina Kaif, and Kajol also fell victim to deepfake technology. Rumours about Ash and Abhi’s relationship have been trending on social media for some time. Recently, the mother-daughter duo enjoyed a vacation in New York without Abhishek and were notably distant from the Bachchans at the Ambani wedding. Abhishek's recent like on a divorce-related post has further fueled the buzz. On the work front, Abhishek will next be seen in Remo D'Souza's film 'Be Happy.'",
