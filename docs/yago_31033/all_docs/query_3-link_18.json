        "text": "Being happy in whatever he does is most important for Abhishek Bachchan. And that's something that comes across in his interview with Niranjan Iyengar on Look Who's Talking.\n\nThe actor elaborates, \"I was really sad when Khele Hum Jee Jaan Se didn't get the response it deserved. I believed that freedom fighter deserved a better response. At that time, what the film's director Ashutosh Gowariker told me, really hit me. He said, 'Set a goal for yourself and be happy when you achieve it. Be happy when you do your work perfectly. Don't care about the world. You can't lose yourself in quests of pleasing others. It's of no use.' \"\n\n\"Going back to a happy, healthy family at the end of the day is more important than being successful,\" says AB Jr. He confesses that he's more like his mother than his father and even acts like her. \"I am a people's person like her. I am very outgoing. My dad is a loner. He likes to have us around. He would call us in his study and we used to sit there for hours without saying a word. We were never brought up as star kids. We were any other normal family,\" he admits.\n\nAbout his soulmate, Abhishek says they were meant to be. \"Aishwarya is like an anchor for me. My parents had always given me the freedom to do whatever I wanted. I was carefree. After marriage and my daughter's arrival, I have become more responsible. She is my buddy, a friend. I can discuss anything with her. Our relationship is not based on her being the Aishwarya Rai or me coming from an illustrious family. It is just about two people falling in love which was organically grown. We shot three films back-to-back for a year at that time. It started during Guru. We were meant to be, it's destiny.\"\n\nAnd about his daughter, Abhishek says that, at times, Aaradhya behaves older than him! \"She is a very easy, very happy, very loving kid. Aishwarya has to be given the credit for the same. She is always around for Aaradhya. Even when Aishwarya will start working, there won't be any problem as she is very organised. She thinks about everything beforehand. I have only once changed a diaper as Aishwarya is so prompt that she hardly gives anyone else a chance to do anything. I will never do anything that will bring shame to my daughter today or 10 years down the line.\"\n\nShyness is a trait that comes easily to him. \"I cannot walk into a room alone (restaurants, public spaces). So, the mobile phone is a boon. I pretend that I am on call if I have to be alone in public spaces!\"\n\nOne has rarely spotted him without a beard. The face fuzz has been a constant feature since he was studying abroad he had long hair and a beard. \"I look very innocent and immature without a stubble,\" he grins.\n\nAnd no, he is not obsessed about looking good on screen. \"I am not a vain person. I am in the wrong profession, I guess. I feel I don't have to look good onscreen all the time. I should look the character,\" he shares. It's the same about skin show. He feels that one doesn't have to take out his shirt just because he has a good physique. \"If it's the need of the character then fine. I give a lot of importance to physicality as it's an important part of getting into character. That is why I had put on a lot of weight for Guru,\" he says.\n\nWhat was his most difficult scene, Abhishek said that Kabhi Alvida Na Kehnaa (KANK) was a challenging film. \"Hrishi's character was really difficult. I had to play a man who's innocent like a kid. In a particular scene where I meet Rani (Mukerji) for the first time after we split up and I have to inform her that my dad is dead and hand over his photo. My dad (Amitabh) is playing that character and it's his photo I am holding in my hand. It was most difficult scene of my life. There are few moments in every actor's life where it's more personal than acting. The scene started and I was holding my dad's picture and say that he is dead. After the scene I just broke down and started crying. I was sitting in a corner and Karan came up to me as he understood what I was feeling. He just hugged me as he too was missing his dad. He teared up too; even Rani started crying looking at us. It was too special. Micky (Contractor) took me for a long drive after that where I told I am in love with Aishwarya. We were not dating then.\"\n\nAbhishek is sensitive to criticism. Ravan, he said, was a very tough film for him both physically and mentally. \"Media criticism after the film was disheartening. I lost my confidence after that. There were times when I did not want to go home as I used to feel that I am not worthy of father's name. I am still picking pieces after that. I understand as public figures we are subjected to public scrutiny. But we actors are human beings too with real feelings. One doesn't need to be shown mirror in public on weekly basis.\"\n\nBut this serious side aside, he's a known prankster who loves to fool around and have fun. \"I am free-spirited. I have worked on different levels of film-making, so I am comfortable with people on set. I too have lot of inhibitions as an actor. Mingling with others on the set and having fun helps me manage that,\" he says, adding that it bothers him when people think he is not serious about his work because he is funny."
