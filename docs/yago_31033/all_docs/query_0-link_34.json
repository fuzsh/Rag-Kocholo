        "text": "In the wake of swirling rumours regarding the alleged separation of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan, a resurfaced 2010 interview with Salman Khan has captured attention. The interview, originally featured on India TV's Aapki Adalat, unveils Salman's reflections on his former flame's marital status with veteran superstar Amitabh Bachchan's son.\n\nThe reappearance of this clip has sparked renewed interest, especially as fans speculate about the current dynamics between Aishwarya and Abhishek. In the interview, Salman provides insights into his sentiments regarding Aishwarya's marriage, adding a layer of intrigue to the ongoing discussions surrounding the celebrity couple.\n\nWhen asked about reports of his aggression towards Aishwarya, Salma replied, “So many years have gone by. She’s somebody’s wife and I am very happy that she is married to Abhishek. I think Abhishek is a great guy and (she) married into a big family and they are very happy together. This is the best thing that any ex-boyfriend would want. You don't want this in your life where once your friendship is over, and that person is miserable without you. You want that person to be really really happy without you.\"\n\nAs rumours surrounding the possible separation of Aishwarya and Abhishek continue to circulate, the resurfaced clip has further intensified online chatter. The video's resurgence coincides with heightened interest in the dynamics of Aishwarya and Abhishek's relationship. Despite the passage of nearly 17 years since Aishwarya's wedding, Salman's amicable relationship with the Bachchan family remains evident, with the actor frequently exchanging greetings with Abhishek at public events.\n\nHave something to add?
