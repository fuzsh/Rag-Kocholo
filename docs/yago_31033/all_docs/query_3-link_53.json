        "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan are among fans’ favorite Bollywood couples. Their love story spans almost 17 years, as they tied the knot in 2007. However, they worked on several films together much before that. From Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke to Dhoom 2, the couple’s films are still loved by their fans. While they have not collaborated on a project for a while, a list of their films is listed here.\n\nDhaai Akshar Prem Ke\n\nThe 2000 movie Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke was the first project on which Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan collaborated. The movie features a strange love triangle as it also star Sonali Bendre. Its plot revolves around Karan, a young man who is in love with Nisha. However, while pretending to be married to Sahiba, he developed feelings for her. Directed by Raj Kanwar, it is a remake of the 2005 Hollywood film A Walk In The Clouds.\n\nKuch Naa Kaho\n\nIn 2003, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan returned to the silver screens as a powerful couple in Kuch Naa Kaho. Also starring Arbaaz Khan, the movie follows the story of Raj and Namrata. While Raj’s father asks Namrata to find a suitable girl for his son, he refuses to marry anyone. Instead, he falls for Namrata in the process. While the love story seems simple, it is soon revealed that Namrata is married, and her husband fled before the birth of their first child. Rohan Sippy directed the film, which earned several awards.\n\nBunty Aur Babli\n\nBunty Aur Babli starred Abhishek Bachchan and Rani Mukerji in the lead roles. However, the actor did share the screen with Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the iconic dance number Kajra Re. The song is considered one of the best tracks of Bollywood and tops the playlist of many music buffs. While Aishwarya won hearts with her dance moves, Abhishek and Amitabh Bachchan did complete justice to the choreography. It came out in 2005 and soon became a commercial success. Shaad Ali directed the film, while Aditya Chopra produced it.\n\nDhoom 2\n\nAbhishek Bachchan reprised his role as ACP Jai Dixit in the 2006 action hit Dhoom 2. While Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan were not paired together in this blockbuster, they amazed everyone with their performances. The movie’s plot revolves around a thief who does not spare any chance to pull off a heist at the most secure places in the world. He finds Sunehri to be an ally, but he soon turns out to be siding with the police. Uday Chopra, Bipasha Basu, and Rimi Sen also starred in this action drama.\n\nUmrao Jaan\n\nThe period drama Umrao Jaan was released in 2006 and featured Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan in the lead roles. The movie is based on the Urdu novel Umrao Jaan Ada and focuses on a courtesan of the titular name. Its story is filled with pain and emotions that a courtesan goes through. Besides the two leads, the cast also features Suniel Shetty, Shabana Azmi, Divya Dutta, and Kulbhushan Kharbanda.\n\nGuru\n\nThis 2007 film is a masterpiece by celebrated writer and filmmaker Mani Ratnam. Set against the backdrop of the 1950s, it shows the journey of an ordinary man (played by Abhishek Bachchan) who works hard to become a business tycoon. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan plays his better half, and their romantic story is still cherished by fans. The film was released in Telugu, Tamil, and Hindi, and AR Rahman gave its brilliant music.\n\nSarkar Raj\n\nSarkar Raj was Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s first film after their marriage in 2007. The movie also starred Amitabh Bachchan and follows the story of Sarkar. As he opposes an offer of a CEO to build a power plant in a village, his son Shankar convinces him otherwise. However, the project soon turns into a political storm, and the drama in the story intensifies. Ram Gopal Varma directed the project, which became a blockbuster in the country.\n\nRaavan\n\nThe couple worked with Mani Ratnam once again in this 2010 film. It revolves around the story of a bandit who kidnaps an officer’s wife. As he accidentally falls in love with her, he lets her go, only to realize that she has the same feelings. However, her husband then uses her to get to the bandit and seek his revenge. Vikram plays the lead antagonist in the movie, while Prithviraj Sukumaran, Karthik, Priyamani, and others portray supporting characters.\n\nRaavan was the last film that Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan made together. After the birth of their daughter, the actress took a few years of hiatus. However, the two of them always ensure to support one another’s endeavors."
