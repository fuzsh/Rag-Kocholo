        "meta_description": "Amid the ongoing divorce rumours, B-town's power couple Abhishek Bachchan and his wife Aishwarya Rai seemingly shut down all speculations with their joint appearance at an event. The couple arrived together at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School Annual Day event in Mumbai, where their daughter Aaradhya studies. Apart from them, the entire Bachchan family, including Amitabh Bachchan, Jaya Bachchan and Agastya Nanda also graced the event. Soon their pictures and videos emerged on social media and went viral in no time. While Aishwarya looked classy in a black and golden suit and heels, Junior B wore a navy blue shirt, which he paired with matching pants and sneakers. Reacting to their pictures, one fan said, 'Thank god!! Ye dono saath hain', another wrote, 'Yes ab lagra saath hai dono..i wish hamesha saath rahe.' Abhishek and Aishwarya got married on April 20, 2007, in an intimate wedding ceremony. They became proud parents of a daughter, Aaradhya, on November 16, 2011. Meanwhile, on the work front, while Aishwarya was last seen in Mani Ratnam's magnum opus 'Ponniyin Selvan: II', Abhishek garnered immense love and appreciation for his performance in the critically-acclaimed sports drama film 'Ghoomer.'
