        "text": "Putting an end to ongoing divorce rumours, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan subtly dismissed any speculation by expressing her love for her husband, actor Abhishek Bachchan, on her Instagram account.\n\nIn a heartfelt birthday message, the renowned star shared a photo featuring herself, Abhishek, and their daughter Aaradhya, all elegantly coordinated in red attire. Additionally, she included a black-and-white baby picture of her husband, expressing affection and warmth in the birthday tribute.\n\nExtending warm wishes to her husband and expressing hopes for abundant happiness, love, tranquillity, peace, and good health, Aishwarya conveyed blessings and encouraged her husband to shine in life. In the accompanying caption, she penned, \"Here’s wishing you a happy birthday with much happiness, love, calm, peace and good health. God Bless. Shine on!\"\n\nOne user in the comments noted, \"Girl ended divorce rumour.\" Another shared, \"She ended all notions of divorce with this post.\" A heavily invested fan penned, \"Thanks for clearing the rumour ma’am. My maternal grandmother was quite anxious.\"\n\nThe spotlight had steadfastly been on the power couple as of late, as rumours about alleged rifts circulated on the internet. This intensified as the duo made a joint appearance at the Dhirubhai Ambani International School Annual Day event in Mumbai, as reported by Hindustan Times. Amid circulating reports from various media portals suggesting strains in their relationship, the couple's presence together at this public event sparked intense curiosity among fans and media outlets alike.\n\nObservers noted various interactions between the family members. Aishwarya exchanged words with Amitabh and affectionately held her nephew Agastya's cheek as they gathered at the venue. Notably, Abhishek was seen engaged in conversation with Aishwarya, displaying an affectionate gesture by placing his arm around her as they strolled into the school premises.\n\nThe initiation of rumours can be traced back to Abhishek's niece Navya Naveli Nanda and Aishwarya avoiding taking photographs together during their joint appearance on the runway for a renowned brand at the Paris Fashion Week, as per Times of India. Despite the presence of Shweta and Jaya Bachchan at this esteemed event, Shweta deliberately omitted mentioning the actor in her Instagram post, choosing instead to focus solely on her daughter.\n\nAishwarya then posted a cropped image on her social media from Amitabh’s 80th birthday bash, focusing solely on Amitabh and Aaradhya while excluding Jaya, Navya, and Agastya. Moreover, Abhishek's public appearances without his wedding ring, as reported by Times of India and Firstpost, fueled the gossip mill. Amitabh’s reported decision to unfollow Aishwarya on social media further stoked the fire, leading to rampant speculations among fans.\n\nA cryptic tweet from Amitabh, with a contemplative tone, added to the mystery surrounding the couple’s relationship status. Recent incidents, such as Aishwarya and Abhishek skipping joint photo opportunities and the absence of the Bachchan family at Aishwarya’s 50th birthday, only served to intensify the speculation. Furthermore, reports by ZoomTV suggested that Aishwarya allegedly relocated from the Bachchan family residence. Moreover, a cessation of communication between Aishwarya and her mother-in-law, Jaya, was also reported.\n\nAishwarya and Abhishek tied the knot on April 20, 2007, in an intimate ceremony held at Amitabh's bungalow, Prateeksha. Their family expanded with the birth of their daughter, Aaradhya, on November 16, 2011.\n\nHave something to add? Share it in the comments"
