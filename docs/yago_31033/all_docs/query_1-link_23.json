        "text": "Instagram is slowly morphing into a tool for letting people know how messy those supposed perfect and impressionable lives can be. Is it any longer a medium to connect fans and strangers, and reuniting friends? The latest example that has been blown out of proportion is Abhishek Bachchan liking a post about divorce. Certain netizens think stars go through the same chaos in their personal lives if they like something they read on social media.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShared by author Heena Khandelwal, the Instagram post liked by the ‘Yuva’ actor reads, “When love stops being easy. Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?” Fans have further fuelled Bachchan’s divroce rumours with his wife Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.\n\nExample No. 2- Shaikha Mahra Bint Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the daughter of Dubai’s ruler, publicly divorced her husband after her message went viral on Instagram.\n\nâDear Husband,â the Dubai princess began. âAs you are occupied with other companions, I hereby declare our divorce. I divorce you, I divorce you, and I divorce you. Take care. Your ex-wife.â These were the explosive words, or declaration.\n\nâBad news. God bless you,â a user commented under the post.\n\nAnother wrote, âI am proud. Your Decision.â\n\nMeanwhile, someone asked, âBut the divorce will occur from Husband’s side, right? And Wife has to choose Khul’?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat next?"
