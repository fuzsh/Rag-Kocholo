        "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan are one of the most loved celebrity couples in Bollywood. Their fun banter and palpable chemistry are appreciated by their fans both on-screen and off-screen. Aishwarya, who is one of the biggest global superstars, married Abhishek, whose father Amitabh Bachchan is also a global superstar. The couple are doting parents to daughter Aaradhya, who keeps making appearances from time to time. In an old interview, Abhishek Bachchan had expressed that he is against the idea of planning babies and that he’ll be content with just two kids. The Dasvi actor had also shared that it irked him to see people’s obsession with the couple having babies.\n\nSpeaking about the same with GQ India 2010, just a couple of years after his wedding, Abhishek Bachchan had explained, “I’ll be happy with two kids. I mean I have a sister, so maybe that’s where it comes from. I feel they are blessings of God, and it should just happen as and when. You know, whenever it’s meant to be. I am against the whole thing of ‘Let’s plan it’, you know, ‘We’re trying for a baby’.”\n\nHe went on to add, “I find that a bit weird. I don’t want to have that vision in my head of somebody else. And now I’ve finally decided that I’m that sort of a guy. It’s really none of your business. I find it very intrusive. I really don’t want to know when other people are having babies; why would you want to know when I’m having babies?”\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan had a traditional south-Indian wedding in April 2007, in Mumbai after getting engaged in an intimate ceremony in January 2007. After their wedding, the couple appeared together on The Oprah Winfrey Show, where Abhishek shared the story of his proposal to Aishwarya.\n\nDuring the interview, Abhishek reportedly revealed, “I was filming in New York for a movie, and I used to stand on the balcony of my hotel room and wish that one day… ‘wouldn’t it be nice if I was together with her (Aishwarya), married?'” The actor further shared that he took Aishwarya to that same balcony and asked her to be his life partner and Aishwarya agreed.\n\nThe duo had met on the sets of their romantic hit Dhai Akshar Prem Ke and later, had worked together in Kuch Naa Kaho. It was during the filming of Dhoom 2 that the two had reportedly fallen in love with each other. As per Abhishek, during the filming of Mani Ratnam’s film, Guru, he had decided to propose to his lady-love and had planned to go down on his knees.\n\nAs for their professional endeavours, Aishwarya was last seen in the historical action drama Ponniyin Selvan: II, directed by Mani Ratnam, released in April. Abhishek, on the other hand, was last seen in the sports drama film Ghoomer, directed by R Balki."
