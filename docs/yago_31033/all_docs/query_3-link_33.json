Here, we look in depth at the couple’s real estate wealth.\n\nThe Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan house in Mumbai is frequently flooded with fans hoping to catch a glimpse of the stars. We give you a quick overview of the house they currently live in, as well as the other houses and properties they own.\n\nAishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan are global icons. One is the Miss World Beauty Pageant winner, the face of L’Oreal Paris, and a well-known actor, while the other is a successful actor from one of Bollywood’s most powerful families. They make an incredible pairing.\n\nGiven their reputation and popularity, it is understandable that they frequently make headlines. In this blog, we take a quick look at the property details of the two – Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan’s houses in Mumbai and elsewhere.\n\nQuick Facts about Aishwarya Rai & Abhishek Bachchan House\n\nAishwarya Rai & Abhishek Bachchan’s House Details: Jalsa\n\nJalsa is a luxurious bungalow that exudes sophistication around every corner. In 1982, director Ramesh Sippy gave Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya’s father-in-law, the house as a gift. They have lived in Jalsa with Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan, as well as their daughter Aradhya, since they married in 2007.\n\nFew Facts About this House\n\nThe house’s design is very minimalist, combining traditional and modern elements.\n\nJalsa notices that the palatial bungalow is an architectural marvel in design.\n\nEach room and section of the house has been carefully and thoughtfully designed. The house’s notable areas include the grand entrance, living room, dining room, gourmet kitchen with cutting-edge kitchen appliances and tools, master suite, guest rooms, fitness and wellness sections, entertainment room, personal library and study room, in-house swimming pool, and staff quarters.\n\nBoth the interior and exterior of the house pay homage to traditional sensibilities as well as contemporary modes of thought. However, this approach to design is not visually jarring because each school of design blends seamlessly into the next.\n\nAishwarya Rai & Abhishek Bachchan’s House and Other Properties in India:\n\nAside from their primary residence in Jalsa, the couple has made several additional investments in the country. Some of these are listed below for easy browsing:\n\nSkylark Towers Apartment, Worli, Mumbai\n\nIn 2015, Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan made a power couple-like move by investing in a luxury flat worth INR 21 crores in Worli, Mumbai. The flat is located in one of the most upscale residential complexes in Signia Isles, the Bandra-Kurla Complex. Talati Panthaky Associates designed the Signia Isles building, and Sunteck Realty, an in-house team, specifically designed the couple’s apartment.\n\nLonavala Farmhouse, Mumbai Hill Station\n\nAside from their bungalow and apartment in the bustling city of Mumbai, the couple also owns a serene farmhouse in Lonavala. This is a hill station located far from the hustle and bustle of city life, offering the couple an idyllic escape whenever they need it. The farmhouse includes luxurious amenities such as a tennis court, helipad, and swimming pool.\n\nAccording to a report, Abhishek Bachchan purchased six apartments in Borivali, Abhishek Bachchan paid Rs 15.42 crore for six apartments in Mumbai’s Borivali neighbourhood.

These six apartments cover a total of 4,894 square feet, with a property cost of Rs 31,498 per square foot.\n\nCarpet Area and Property Price for Abhishek Bachchan’s New Apartments\n\nLocation of Abhishek Bachchan’s New House\n\nThe six new apartments are located on the 57th floor of a rising Western Express Highway (WEH) building in Borivali East.\n\nAishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan’s house and other properties are international.\n\nThe couple owns the two properties listed below on an international scale:\n\nDubai Villa, Jumeirah Golf Estates\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of Shah Rukh Khan, Salman Khan, Anil Kapoor, and Sanjay Dutt, Aishwarya Rai and her partner own a luxury property in Dubai. The villa was bought in 2015 for a whopping INR 16 crore. The villa is located in Sanctuary Falls, Jumeirah Golf Estates, one of Dubai’s most luxurious artificial islands. The villa’s amenities are sure to impress, including a private swimming pool, Scavolini designer kitchen, Vileroy & Boch sanitary fixtures, Nolte wardrobes, and an in-house gym. The villa is opulent, comparable to the quality of properties owned by other global figures.\n\nProperty in New York City, USA\n\nAccording to news reports, Aishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan bought a swanky flat in the heart of New York City around 2017. There is little public information available about this flat.
