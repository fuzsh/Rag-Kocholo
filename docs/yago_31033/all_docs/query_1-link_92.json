        "text": "Aishwarya Rai Bachchan grabbed all the attention after she arrived at Anant Ambani and Radhika Merchant's wedding separately from her husband, Abhishek Bachchan, and her in-laws. While the entire Bachchan clan posed together, Aishwarya came along with her daughter, Aaradhya Bachchan, which left everyone wondering if the divorce rumours were true. Later, in the inside glimpses from Anant Ambani's wedding, we saw Aishwarya and Abhishek together, which brought a sigh of relief. However, amid this, Abhishek's social media action again grabbed attention.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAbhishek Bachchan reacts to a post on 'divorce' rising speculations about his split rumours with Aishwarya\n\nWhen Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Abhishek Bachchan were later spotted together at Anant Ambani's wedding, people thought that maybe everything between the couple was fine and it was only a family feud, as reported earlier. Amid this, we stumbled upon a post by an author, Heena Khandelwal, on IG, wherein she talked elaborately about divorce. The post featured a cover of an article/book about 'divorce', and the title reads, \"When love stops being easy.\" The subhead under the post could be read as:\n\n\"Couples who have been married are now parting ways. What has prompted their decision and why are grey divorces on the rise?”\n\nRecommended Read: Mommy-To-Be, Deepika Padukone Kisses Ambani's 'Choti Bahu' Radhika Merchant In Unseen Photo\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn the caption, the author details the aspects that her article/book covers, such as 'grey divorces’ or ‘silver splitters' and more. She also, in her caption, wrote that her article/book features about the hardship of separation, including how couples who had spent years of togetherness cope with parting ways with one another and how it would be so difficult for them to accept, as they once dreamt of being together and live the moments like the hand-holding old couples that we see in several videos or movies. However, what grabbed the attention was Abhishek Bachchan's like on it, which yet again sparked rumours about his split with Aishwarya.\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nAishwarya Rai Bachchan kept a distance from the Bachchan clan as she appeared at Anant Ambani's wedding\n\nThe split rumours between Abhishek and Aishwarya Bachchan yet again began, when the actress arrived at Anant Ambani's wedding with her daughter. On the other hand, the Bachchan clan posed for a family photo, including Abhishek, Shweta, Jaya, Amitabh, Nikhil Nanda, Navya, and Agastya. It seemed a bit unusual as only Aishwarya and Aaradhya were missing from the frame. Such an incident instantly ignited the ongoing divorce rumours between the couple.\n\nadvertisement.\n\nOn the other hand, Aishwarya met Rekha at Anant's wedding. The actresses shared a warm hug, and Rekha also blessed Aaradhya. Amid this, some inside glimpses from the wedding went viral, wherein Abhishek and Aishwarya could be seen alongside each other. It left netizens thinking that everything was fine between the couple and that it was a family feud that kept Aishwarya away from posing with the Bachchans.\n\nAlso Read: Parents-To-Be, Deepika And Ranveer's Chemistry At Anant's Wedding Leaves The Photographer In Awe\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nLast year, reports were rife that Aishwarya had moved out of Jalsa, and was not on cordial terms with Jaya. It was also reported that Jaya and Aishwarya hadn't talked for years.
