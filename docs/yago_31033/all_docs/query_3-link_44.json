        "text": "KUALA LUMPUR: Bollywood was recently abuzz on celebrity couple Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai's marriage being possibly on the rocks.\n\nThis came to light after the 48-year-old actor had liked a social media post on divorce by The Indian Express special correspondent named Heena Khandelwal.\n\nThe post by Heena, had reportedly been based on an article she previously wrote titled 'When Love Stops Being Easy.'\n\nRumours of the couple getting a divorce are not new, but gained new life recently when the two appeared at the Ambani wedding held in Mumbai on July 12 separately.\n\nAshwarya, 50, was photographed arriving at the scene with daughter Aaradhya Bachchan, while Abhishek attended the wedding with his family members including his parents Jaya and Amitabh, Shweta, Nikhil Nanda, Navya, and Agastya.\n\nHowever, fans were relieved to see that both mother and daughter were later seen seated next to Abhishek, which was a sign that the rumours were simply unfounded.\n\nAs for liking the divorce post, Hindustan Times yesterday quoted a Reddit user who said that the real reason why the actor liked the post was not because he was hinting about an impending separation, but that the writer of the article is someone close to the actress."
