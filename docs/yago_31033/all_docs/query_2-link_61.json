        "text": "Rumors have been doing rounds about Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai since many days that all is not well between them. These rumors gained more momentum when Abhishek Bachchan liked a post related to divorce. Earlier, Aishwarya Rai and her daughter Aaradhya’s entry in Anant Ambani’s wedding, apart from the Bachchan family, also caused it. However, Aishwarya is said to be close by liking the divorce post. Now a video of Abhishek is going viral on social media. In this he is talking about post marriage with Aishwarya.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan’s video which is going viral is from Karan Johar’s show Koffee with Karan. In this, Karan Johar asks Abhishek Bachchan if he has ever felt confused between three women in his life. Karan said that you are the apple of Jaya Bachchan’s eye and the apple of Shweta’s life. Now you have another woman in your life i.e. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, so how do you balance these roles. Have you ever had a problem with this and got stuck? Both Aishwarya and Abhishek arrived at the show. In between, Aishwarya laughs and says, “Only a wife will be called another woman.”\n\nAnswered that\n\nIn response to Karan Johar’s question, Abhishek Bachchan said that he gives full credit to the three women in his life. He revealed that his mother and wife are very close and they talk about everything. Abhishek said, “When a woman comes to her husband’s house for the first time, she naturally feels a little uneasy. I think if anyone can really end that thing, it’s none other than his mother-in-law.”\n\nAbhishek Bachchan Workfront\n\nAishwarya Rai and Abhishek Bachchan got married in the year 2007. The duo welcomed their daughter Aaradhya Bachchan in 2011. The couple has worked together in many films. It includes the names of films like ‘Dhai Akshar Prem Ke’, ‘Kuch Na Kaho’, ‘Umrao Jaan’, ‘Dhoom 2’, ‘Guru and Raavan’. Talking about the work front, Abhishek Bachchan will be seen with Shahrukh Khan in his film King."
