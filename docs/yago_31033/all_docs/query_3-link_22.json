I'm not even joking, I cannot image the amount of pressure they have in public so they seem stressed every time.\n\nAlso IDK if you can 'poor guy' Abhishek for anything he seems fine.\n\nOriginally posted by: DheeJattanDi\n\nDon't think you can be with someone for 15+ years without loving them. So of course she loves him.. and he adores her too. Not everyone has to publicly love their partners, some people are more introverts and got different love languages."
