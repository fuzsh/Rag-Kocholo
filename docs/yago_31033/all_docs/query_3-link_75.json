        "text": "Although the Indian film industry has, in recent years, expanded the scope of its genres to produce several horrors, dramas, comedies and thrillers of note, nothing can hold a candle to the quintessential Bollywood romance. From Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela (2013) starring Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh to Mani Ratnam’s Guru (2007) starring Abhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, Bollywood, through the ages, has seen iconic stories of love unfurl on the silver screen, often inspiring the actors portraying these passionate characters to embark on awe-inspiring romances of their own. We look back at the stories of couples who met on set that serve as a reminder that love can strike when you least expect it to.\n\nDeepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh\n\nWhen it comes to Bollywood couples with envious chemistry, Padukone and Singh’s performance in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s 2013 drama Goliyon Ki Raasleela Ram-Leela is the gold standard. Although the pair first met on the sets of the movie Bombay Talkies, it wasn’t until Ramleela that a real-life connection was sparked. The couple kept their relationship under wraps for the longest time before getting married at Lake Como in 2018. Since then, starring together in movies like Padmaavat (2018) and Bajirao Mastani (2015) has only made their combined fandom thirsty for more.\n\nKareena Kapoor Khan and Saif Ali Khan\n\nKareena Kapoor and Saif Ali Khan had shared screen space in Omkara (2006) and LOC: Kargil (2003) before, but it wasn’t until the pair met on the set of Tashan (2008) that sparks flew. Kapoor was just coming out of a long-term relationship of five years with Shahid Kapoor, and Khan had been divorced from Amrita Singh since 2004. When they finally fell in love, it culminated in a fairytale royal romance between the Nawab of Pataudi and the daughter of Bollywood’s blue-blooded family. The pair went public with their relationship in 2008, and after four years of dating, got married in October 2012 in one of the most anticipated weddings in Bollywood. They have two adorable boys together, Taimur and Jehangir, who are paparazzi darlings thanks to the ease with which they field shutterbugs.\n\nAbhishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan\n\nBefore they became a certified A-list couple, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan’s relationships with Salman Khan and Vivek Oberoi were the talk of the town and would routinely set tongues wagging, much to the chagrin of the former Miss World. Aishwarya and Abhishek Bachchan fell in love while filming Mani Ratnam’s critically acclaimed drama Guru (2007) and tied the knot at Pratiksha, Amitabh Bachchan’s private residence in Mumbai. The couple continues to inspire us with their magical combination of grace and wit.\n\nSidharth Malhotra and Kiara Advani\n\nMalhotra and Advani reportedly began dating soon after they started working together on Shershaah (2021). Though it was speculated that they became an item in 2021, neither had confirmed that they were in a relationship until Advani reluctantly confessed on season 7 of Koffee with Karan that they were “more than close friends” Although the pair couldn’t have a happy ending in their first and only on-screen project till date, they found themselves bound together by love and joy when they tied the knot earlier this year in February.\n\nRanbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt\n\nWhile Bhatt publicly professed her long-time crush on Kapoor back in 2013 in season 4 of Koffee with Karan, it wasn’t until over a decade later—when the duo collaborated on Ayan Mukerji’s 2022 fantasy drama Brahmāstra—that love blossomed between them. When rumours of their romance started doing the rounds in 2017, the two chose to keep a low profile until their dreamy, intimate wedding ceremony that took social media by storm in April 2022. Among the most-adored couples who met on set, Bhatt and Kapoor became proud parents to their daughter Raha in November 2022 and are expected to be seen on screen in the upcoming two movies in the Brahmāstra trilogy.\n\nRicha Chadha and Ali Fazal\n\nChadha and Fazal were roped in for 2012’s comedy hit Fukrey and had been friends for a long time before they started dating. They became a couple in 2015 and went public with their relationship in 2017 when they attended the premiere of Victoria & Abdul at the Venice Film Festival. Reportedly, Chadha experienced this rush of affection for Fazal when they were watching a film called Chaplin starring Robert Downey Jr. and she realised how glad she was to have found someone with similar tastes. And although that’s when she said the three magical words to him, Ali took three months to say them back. Water under the bridge though‚ since they’ve been legally married since 2020 and had a beautiful ceremony in October last year.\n\nAjay Devgn and Kajol\n\nKajol and Devgn’s romance began in 1995 on the sets of their film Hulchul. Despite reservations from their friends and families citing their contrasting personalities, they tied the knot in 1999. As is evident, their relationship stood the test of time and the duo has spoken candidly about navigating the challenges of being married. The couple shares two children—Nysa and Yug—and they were last seen together on screen in the 2020 release Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior for which Devgn won a National Film Award.\n\nAkshay Kumar and Twinkle Khanna\n\nKumar and Khanna first met during a Filmfare photoshoot but sparks flew on the sets of International Khiladi (1999)—their first appearance together on the big screen. Their love story is embellished with quirky anecdotes like the detailed family health history Khanna demanded before agreeing to Kumar’s proposal, but that didn’t stop them from trying the knot in 2001 in an intimate ceremony at the residence of designer duo Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla. In the 22 years since, they became parents to son Aarav and daughter Nitara and continue to pull each other’s leg in public.\n\nAlso read:\n\n7 celebrity couples that get twinning right\n\n20 celebrity couples show you how to step out in style\n\n5 celebrity couples that met on social media to get inspired by, if you're looking for love in lockdown"
