My dad was out of town.’ Further, Ash also recalled shooting for the song ‘Khwaja Mere Khwaja’ from ‘Jodhaa Akbar’ as a bride around same time. ‘I am like, oh my god this is surreal, all happening on-screen, off-screen, it was really really weird’, she concluded.For more news and updates, stay tuned to ETimes.
