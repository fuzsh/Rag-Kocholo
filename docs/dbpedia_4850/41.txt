Not your typical candidate, Beki Adam, 48, is taking on her most difficult transformation yet, to challenge long-term Mid Sussex MP Sir Nicholas Soames who has a majority of almost 7,500.

The independent candidate, who will challenge the Conservative MP in May, became a TV star in her 20s as a presenter on Top Gear before opting for the quieter life of being a Buddhist monk in 1999.

In between she spent an afternoon in police cells in 1992 when she sold cannabis cakes from a Brighton coffee shop as part of a drug legalisation protest.

She jokes that she ran the shortest-lived business in the South East after it was shut down by police in just 57 minutes.

Ms Adam is unfazed by contesting a seat occupied by Churchill’s grandson and in a constituency which has been Tory since it was formed.

Also fighting for the seat is Labour candidate Greg Mountain, UKIP’s Tony Brothers, Green Miranda Diboll and Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper.
