Beki Adam was a presenter on the original format of Top Gear from Series 19 in 1988 through to Series 24 in 1990. She would appear in 15 episodes, and primarily focused on American muscle cars and European sports cars.

Despite having at one time a deeply-vested interest in cars, she would delve into spirituality following her tenure on the show and deemed it a waste.
