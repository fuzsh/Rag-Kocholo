Beki Adams originally trained as a classical musician at the Royal Northern College of Music before going on to complete her PGCE in Secondary Music at the Manchester Metropolitan University. After teaching music in disadvantaged schools in North Manchester and volunteering in her community as a District Commissioner for Girlguiding UK, she set her sights further afield. Beki retrained as an ESL teacher in 2016 so she could pursue her dream of traveling the world as a Digital Nomad. Her recent career switch into the social impact space came from her love of volunteering in various countries around the world. She feels the most valuable part of being a global citizen is the unique connections you can realize through experiencing new and contrasting perspectives.
