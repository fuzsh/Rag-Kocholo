        "text": "Beki Baker News\n\nStudio Tenn's DRIVING MISS DAISY Beautifully Captures The Spirit of Alfred Uhry's Play\n\nAlfred Uhry is a Southern writer who knows our region better than most and he uses the power of his words and the artistry of his pen to create moments and scenes in plays and musicals that are as authentic as the little rivulets of condensation that snake their way down the outside of a glass of iced tea on a too-hot afternoon in March, for goodness’ sake.\n\nReview Round-up: JAGGED LITTLE PILL, THE 39 STEPS, MRS. KRISHNAN'S PARTY and THE REVOLUTIONISTS\n\nIn the aftermath of experiencing the Nashville premiere of Jagged Little Pill — the musical inspired by and featuring music from Alanis Morissette’s 1995 album of the same name, other songs written by her and including two created expressly for the production, and featuring a compelling, biting and challenging book by Diablo Cody — one cannot help but lament the show’s abbreviated three-performance run at TPAC’s Andrew Jackson Hall.\n\nBeki Baker Infuses Lipscomb University's ADA AND THE ENGINE With Sensitivity, Wit and Understanding\n\nMeghan Wombles’ spirited portrayal of 19th century British genius Ada Byron Lovelace provides the very heart of Lipscomb University Theatre’s Ada and The Engine, currently onstage through February 18 at the Shamblin Theatre, in a beautifully conceived production directed by Beki Baker.\n\nLast Chance to Vote for the BWW Nashville Awards; Voting Ends 12/31\n\nIt's the final week left to vote for the 2023 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards! Voting ends on 12/31 at midnight. Don't miss out on making sure that your favorite theatres, stars, and shows get the recognition they deserve!\n\n2 Weeks to Vote for the BWW Nashville Awards; ALL SHOOK UP, THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG, Cumberland County Playhouse & More Lead!\n\nThere's just two weeks left to vote and we have the latest standings as of Monday, December 18th for the 2023 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards! Don't miss out on making sure that your favorite theatres, stars, and shows get the recognition they deserve!\n\nBroadwayWorld Nashville Awards; ALL SHOOK UP, THE PLAY THAT GOES WRONG, Cumberland County Playhouse & More Lead!\n\nIt's the final 3 weeks and we have the latest standings as of Monday, December 11th for the 2023 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards!

Don't miss out on making sure that your favorite theatres, stars, and shows get the recognition they deserve!\n\nCOLLEGIATE THEATRICS: Connor Adair of Lipscomb University\n\nToday, we continue to celebrate the return of Collegiate Theatrics featuring one of our favorites from the theatre department at Nashville’s Lipscomb University: Connor Adair, a native of Edmond, Oklahoma. Throughout his time on-campus, he’s become a stalwart company member of virtually every Lipscomb University Theatre production we’ve reviewed, most recently taking on a significant supporting role in their acclaimed production of Big Fish.\n\nA Nashville Theater Tribute: GIVING THANKS FOR DENICE\n\nWith the season of Thanksgiving at hand, we celebrate Denice Hicks with A Nashville Theater Tribute: Giving Thanks for Denice, a multi-part retrospective of some of our favorite stories and interviews with her from over the years. We begin our special season of giving thanks for her theatrical legacy, abiding love and continuing presence in our lives with some thoughts from some of her closest friends and artistic collaborators…\n\nLipsomb University Theatre's Emotional and Whimsical BIG FISH THE MUSICAL\n\nOn its surface, there is so much about which to alternately fall in love with/wonder quizzically about in Big Fish, the musical with book by John August (based on his screenplay for the 2003 film version) and a score by Andrew Lippa, that there’s no wonder the show had trouble finding its audience on Broadway but now has proven tremendously popular among theaters all over the country.\n\nNashville Rep's Season-Opening 9 to 5: The Musical Kicks Off An Eagerly Anticipated Slate of Theater\n\nBaker’s superb direction brings all the various moving parts of this huge production together to deliver a gratifyingly heartfelt paean to the millions of working women (and men) who inspired the screenplay and musical book by Patricia Resnick. Baker’s vision for the piece, in concert with her team of collaborators, delivers a production of 9 to 5: The Musical that is delightfully fresh and new, eschewing the tendency of some directors to offer a rehash of what’s already been seen on Broadway, on tour or in regional theater.\n\nReview: 'Stylish, Sophisticated and Uproariously Fun' PRIDE AND PREJUDICE At Lipscomb University Theatre\n\nConfidently directed by Beki Baker, in a stylish and rather sophisticated production led by two of Lipscomb Theatre’s finest – Victoria Griffin as Lizzy Bennet and Bryce Dunn as Mr. Darcy – Pride and Prejudice is clearly one of the most entertaining and quite joyful productions we’ve seen since the pandemic has loosened its grip on theater and allowed a return to near-normalcy stagewise.\n\n12 Days Left To Vote For The 2022 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards; Audience of One Leads Favorite Local Theatre!\n\nThe latest standings as of Monday, December 19th, have been released for the 2022 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards! Nominations were reader-submitted and now our readers get to vote for their favorites.\n\nLatest Stats Released For The 2022 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards; at Cookeville HE Leads Best Ensemble Performance!\n\nThe latest standings as of Monday, December 12th, have been released for the 2022 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards! Nominations were reader-submitted and now our readers get to vote for their favorites.\n\nLatest Standings Released For The 2022 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards; Audience of One Leads Favorite Local Theatre!\n\nThe latest standings as of Monday, December 5th, have been released for the 2022 BroadwayWorld Nashville Awards! Nominations were reader-submitted and now our readers get to vote for their favorites.\n\nBWW Review: Lipscomb University Theatre's MAMMA MIA Is Exactly What's Needed Onstage Now\n\nIn October 2001, Mamma Mia! opened on Broadway, just weeks after the horrific events of 9/11, and most pundits had little inkling that the show – a jukebox musical comprised of ABBA hits and the story of a young girl trying to divine the identity of her father from among three of her mother’s suitors some 21 years earlier – would go on to become the ninth longest running musical in the history of the New York theatrical enclave. But Mamma Mia! was exactly what the theater-going public needed in the aftermath of an epoch-shattering and historic event: an enormously entertaining, fast-paced show set to an eminently hummable, danceable score of songs that could whisk them away to another time and place.\n\nGetting to Know...Studio Tenn Artistic Director PATRICK CASSIDY\n\nThough hard to believe it may be, Studio Tenn artistic director Patrick Cassidy and his wife Melissa Hurley Cassidy have been Tennesseans for well over a year now – he took the reins at Studio Tenn, the Franklin-based professional theater company that has gained critical acclaim and national notoriety during its existence for its unique blend of musicals and original plays – but only now, as theater re-emerges from the dark days of a pandemic-related shutdown, have we managed to get the peripatetic Mr. Cassidy to take time out from his hectic schedule to answer our questions and give BroadwayWorld readers a chance to get to know him better.\n\nBWW Review: Hatty Ryan King's Star Shines Brightly in Lipscomb's BRIGHT STAR\n\nThere is something about Hatty Ryan King a?\" the young woman playing Alice Murphy in Lipscomb University Theatre's superb production of Bright Star (the recent Broadway musical by Steve Martin and Edie Brickell) now onstage at Collins Alumni Auditorium through November 10 a?\" that sets her apart from her peers, that makes her seem destined for greatness and which ensures that every role she takes on is elevated by her unerring instincts, her palpable presence and her inestimable talent.\n\nWhere Are They Now? It's Opening Night in Dallas for EMILY FAITH and Lily & Joan Theater Company\n\nCelebrating an opening night is always exciting, if exhausting, nerve-wracking and exhilarating, but when it's the very first production of a new theater company you've co-founded, odds are it's even more so. Just ask Emily Faith who is directing the premiere production of A Midsummer Night's Dream for the Dallas-based Lily & Joan theater company she co-founded in 2018 with Erika Larsen."
