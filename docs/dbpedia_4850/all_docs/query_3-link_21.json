        "text": "Since her birth in Ottawa, Ontario, Beki Lantos has loved to perform. At a young age, her career in the arts quickly progressed from singing with the family on Sundays to regular performing events across the city. She began performing locally at the tender age of nine in television and theater. At the age of ten she won a singing competition on Ottawa CTV's \"Homegrown Cafe\". At eleven, she released her first album entitled 'Here I Am' and then landed the lead role of Annie in the Company Musical Theater production of the same name.\n\nAt thirteen, she and her family formed the band \"Tangleroot\" for which Beki was a lead singer, bassist and songwriter. The band played together for six years, releasing two albums; \"Tangleroot\" and \"In Pieces\". She never lost her love and passion for television and film though, as she completed writing her first feature film screenplay at the age of fourteen.\n\nThe band split when Beki was 19, and within the next year she started her family. Her first addition was her son, Austin Henderson (2002). Shortly thereafter came her husband, Adam Lantos and their daughter Emelyn Lantos (2004).\n\nBeki's kids are almost grown now, and her love for the arts and performing never left her. She rarely acts anymore but can still be found singing and performing in venues in and round the Lower Mainland of BC. She's also continued her passion for writing and hopes to get one of her films made some day."
