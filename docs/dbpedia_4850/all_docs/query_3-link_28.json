        "text": "V’eyleh toldot Yitzchok ben Avraham,\n\nare the first words of this parshah.\n\n“This is the story of Isaac son of Abraham,”\n\nEtz Chayim translates it.\n\nBut just a few verses back\n\nthere’s an identical line with just the name changed,\n\nv’eyleh toldot Yishmael ben Avraham,\n\nwhich Etz Chayim translates as\n\n“This is the line of Ishmael son of Abraham.”\n\nSo which is it – line or story?\n\nRobert Alter translates it as lineage\n\nor what earlier translations called begettings.\n\nThe lineage of Isaac.\n\nthe patrimony of Isaac.\n\nI want to focus on both of those this morning:\n\nthe story of Isaac\n\nand what he begets,\n\nwhat he leaves behind.\n\nA couple of weeks ago David Kuperstock\n\ntook us through the Akeidah\n\nthrough Abram’s eyes.\n\nNow let’s change the perspective,\n\nthe point of view,\n\nswivel the camera around\n\nfrom the top-down view\n\nof Abram looking down\n\nat his son bound on the altar,\n\nand instead look up\n\nfrom that son’s perspective,\n\nsee the world through Isaac’s eyes,\n\nthe eyes of a man who would go blind.\n\n* * *\n\nThis is Isaac’s parshah.\n\nBy next week, the story is Jacob’s –\n\nIsaac makes no appearance at all –\n\nand in the parshah after that\n\nall we see of Isaac is his death.\n\nAlready here, this week, Rebecca and Jacob and Esau\n\nthreaten to overtake the narrative.\n\nBut if Isaac has any moment in the limelight,\n\nit is this one: v’eyleh toldot Yitzchok ben Avraham.\n\nWho is Isaac?\n\nLet’s start with the broadest facts:\n\nHe is the longest lived of the patriarchs,\n\nthe only one who never leaves Canaan,\n\nthe only one to marry only one woman,\n\nthe only one whose father never blesses him.\n\nThat last fact is key, I think,\n\nto both Isaac’s story and to Isaac’s lineage.\n\nHe is the boy unblessed by his father,\n\nbut also the first man to bless his own boys,\n\nleaving behind a legacy of troubled blessings,\n\nthe first blessings spoken by a Jew,\n\nblessings ripe with the errors of beginning.\n\n* * *\n\nThe central story of this parshah\n\nis the battle for the blessings,\n\nthe Thrilla in Kehilla:\n\nTwo brothers, one bracha!\n\nTwo brothers, one bechora!\n\nWho will emerge victorious?!?\n\nLike so many of us here,\n\nI’ve read this parshah each year\n\nfor many years,\n\nand one thing always troubles me deeply.\n\nIt’s in the midst of the central scene,\n\nthe stolen blessing,\n\nright after Jacob tricks his blind father Isaac\n\ninto giving him his twin brother Esau’s blessing.\n\nEsau, ignorant, comes in holding the dish\n\nthat his father asked for,\n\nthe good boy who did the special chore,\n\nexpecting his blessing:\n\nAnd “Isaac was seized with a very great trembling\n\nand he said,\n\n‘Who is it, then, who caught game\n\nand brought it to me and I ate everything\n\nbefore you came – and blessed him?\n\nNow blessed he stays.’\n\nWhen Esau heard his father’s words,\n\nhe cried out with a great and very bitter outcry,\n\nand he said to his father,\n\n‘Bless me, too, Father!’\n\nAnd he said,\n\n‘Your brother has come in deceit\n\nand has taken your blessing.”\n\n“Bless me, too, Father!”\n\nEsau says, holding the meat he hunted down for his father.\n\nBut Isaac has none to give:\n\n“Your brother has come in deceit and has taken your blessing.”\n\nThen comes what is, to me,\n\none of the most plaintive questions in the Torah:\n\n“Have you not kept back a blessing for me?”\n\nIsaac answers –\n\na troubling answer that we’ll return to in a moment –\n\nbut one that ends with\n\n“For you, then, what can I do, my son?”\n\nThis father, Isaac, our father,\n\nfeels empty – he has nothing to offer.\n\nHe has somehow used up all he has with Jacob.\n\nEsau presses on again, a third entreaty:\n\n“Do you have but one blessing, my father?\n\nBless me, too, Father.”\n\nAnd with that third entreaty,\n\nthat double line that ends each time with “Father,”\n\n“Esau raised his voice and wept.”\n\nIt’s hard still to read this,\n\nthis umpteenth time,\n\nand not be moved.\n\nNot be disturbed.\n\nWhy must the world be like this?\n\nWhy does Isaac think\n\nhe has only one blessing to give?\n\nWhy does it take the tears of his hunter-son,\n\nhis son’s triple entreaty,\n\nfor Isaac to find any blessing at all\n\nfor his favorite son?\n\nIsaac does respond to that third entreaty,\n\ndigging deeply into some extra store\n\nhe did not know he had,\n\nbut even then,\n\nthe thing he calls a blessing is hard news:\n\n“By your sword shall you live\n\nand your brother shall you serve.”\n\nThis may be a blessing,\n\nbut it’s not so far from a curse.\n\nWhy does Isaac feel\n\nhe has only one real blessing to give?\n\nHow can this father,\n\nthis patriarch, one of the fathers,\n\none of our fathers, our avot,\n\nsee blessing as a limited resource,\n\na dwindling commodity?\n\nWhat is it about blessings,\n\nor about the Torah’s notion of blessings,\n\nor Isaac’s notion of blessings,\n\nthat so constrains him?\n\nMust blessings be so narrow?\n\nAnd if this is a blessing –\n\n“By your sword shall you live\n\nand your brother shall you serve” –\n\nthen what exactly is a blessing?\n\n* * *\n\nTo answer that,\n\nwe need to go back further,\n\nto where blessings begin.\n\nBefore we get to human blessings,\n\nthe blessings of a person, a parent,\n\nwe should ask where any blessings began.\n\nThe first brocha of the Torah\n\ncomes from G-d.\n\nG-d blesses “the great sea monsters,\n\nand every living creature that crawls,\n\nwith which the waters swarmed,\n\naccording to their kind,\n\nand every winged fowl.”\n\nG-d blesses them, saying,\n\n“Be fruitful and multiply,”\n\nP’ru urvru.\n\nWhatever blessing is,\n\nit does not need a human being on either side,\n\nas subject or object.\n\nG-d repeats this blessing of fruitfulness\n\nA few lines later,\n\nTo the unnamed first man and woman\n\nin the first chapter of Breishit,\n\nthe first of the two creation stories:\n\n“And G-d created man in His image,\n\nin the image of G-d he created him;\n\nmale and female He crated them.\n\nG-d blessed them and G-d said to them,\n\nbe fertile and increase”\n\nAnd the third blessing\n\nrecounted in the Torah,\n\na few lines later still,\n\nis an ethereal blessing,\n\nthe most abstract blessing possible:\n\n“vayavarech elokim et yom hashvi’i”\n\n“and G-d blessed the seventh day.”\n\nAn invisible G-d blessing invisible time.\n\nSo we come to the end\n\nof the first parshah of the Torah, Parshat Breishit\n\nunsure of what blessing is.\n\nIf we know anything of it,\n\nit’s what we’ve already assumed about it:\n\nthat it means a promise of future goodness,\n\nnot just a hope of future goodness,\n\nbut some way of projecting power into the future –\n\na totem of future good.\n\nThe first two blessings connote fruitfulness:\n\n“G-d blessed them and G-d said to them,\n\nbe fertile and increase”\n\nThe third does not.\n\nThe Sabbath does not multiply, or gain abundance:\n\nIt is simply blessed.\n\nSo here in the text,\n\nin these first three instances,\n\nwe’ve seen the word blessing\n\nused in ways that may seem contradictory:\n\nblessing as a prelude to fertility and increase – to p’ru urvu\n\nand blessing as a marker of ceasing, of stopping:\n\nTo multiply and to pause,\n\nto build and to break:\n\nboth can be brochos.\n\nSo what is a brocha?\n\n* * *\n\nThe first blessing uttered by a human\n\nComes in the next parshah,\n\nIn Noach, after Noah’s drunken escapade,\n\nwhen the bad son Ham\n\ndoesn’t lower his eyes\n\nat his father’s nakedness\n\n(or whatever that connotes).\n\nNoah begins with curses –\n\n“cursed be Canaan,\n\nthe lowest of slaves\n\nshall he be to his brothers,”\n\nThen he turns to a blessing –\n\nbut a blessing of G-d, not people:\n\n“Blessed be the L-rd,\n\nthe G-d of Shem;\n\nlet Cannan be a slave to them.”\n\nG-d will be blessed,\n\nNoah seems to be saying,\n\nfor making his grandson –\n\nCanaan is Ham’s son –\n\na slave to his other sons.\n\nThere are two peculiarities\n\nin this first blessing\n\nspoken by a human.\n\nFirst, that Noah curses Canaan, not Ham,\n\nAnd conversely, that he blesses G-d\n\nfor making Canaan – not Ham –\n\nA slave to Ham’s brothers.\n\nWhy his grandson, and not his son?\n\nMaybe he feels the particular ignominy\n\nof being both shamed by a son\n\nand ashamed of a son:\n\nof his son simultaneously embarrassing him\n\nand being an embarrassment.\n\nSo he visits the curse –\n\nand blesses G-d for, he hopes, enforcing the curse –\n\non the son’s son,\n\nletting him feel what it’s like\n\nto have a cursed son.\n\nWe see, already, the vindictiveness\n\nof this blessing:\n\nthis effort to drag G-d\n\ninto the business of family revenge,\n\na business that here harms\n\nnot just the wrongdoer\n\nbut an innocent grandson.\n\nThe second peculiarity of this blessing\n\nintensifies that theme:\n\nIn offering this first human blessing,\n\nNoah uses a strange name for G-d:\n\n“Blessed be the L-rd,\n\nthe G-d of Shem;\n\nlet Cannan be a slave to them,” he says.\n\nThe G-d of Shem.\n\nNot “Blessed be the L-rd,” full stop,\n\nnot “Blessed be the L-rd, my G-d,”\n\nnot “Blessed be the L-rd, G-d of my father Lamech,”\n\nnot “Blessed be the L-rd, G-d of Adam,”\n\nbut “Blessed be the L-rd, the G-d of Shem.”\n\nShem, his son.\n\nThe G-d of his son.\n\nHe calls on the G-d of one of his sons\n\nTo enforce a curse\n\nvisited on one of his grandsons\n\nAs punishment for the crime\n\nof another of his sons.\n\nAnd he calls this a blessing.\n\nIs it a blessing?\n\nIs it what the Torah thinks of as a blessing?\n\nOr is it just what Noah thinks of as a blessing?\n\nIt is so different from G-d’s blessings,\n\nFrom the blessings G-d gives to the first people,\n\nthe blessing of fruitfulness\n\nor the blessing of time, of the seventh day.\n\n* * *\n\nThe first time that G-d blesses\n\nsomeone by name\n\nis in the next parshah, Lech L’cha\n\nwhen G-d speaks to Abram\n\nfor the first time.\n\nG-d promises that when\n\nAbram leaves everything he knows\n\nand travels to the promised land,\n\n“I will make you a great nation\n\nand I will bless you\n\nand make your name great,\n\nand you shall be a blessing.\n\nAnd I will bless those who bless you,\n\nand those who damn you I will curse,\n\nand all the clans of the earth\n\nthrough you shall be blessed.”\n\nAfter the string of curses\n\nthat begins with Adam and Eve,\n\nand carries on to Cain and Noah and his grandson,\n\nThis is the first blessing of a man with a name.\n\nAnd it’s not just a single blessing,\n\nbut a spurt of blessings:\n\n“I will bless you . . .\n\nyou shall be a blessing . . .\n\nI will bless those who bless you . . .\n\nall the clans of the earth through you shall be blessed”\n\n5 brachas in 2 verses.\n\nA font of blessings.\n\n* * *\n\nAfter this font of blessings,\n\nG-d begins to bless more freely,\n\npromising to bless Sarah and Isaac and Ishmael,\n\nand there are passing blessings by people as well:\n\nMelchizedek blesses Abraham.\n\nLet’s travel past those, though,\n\nTo the next crucial blessing:\n\nThe blessing G-d gives atop Mt. Moriah\n\nwhen Abram took the cleaver to slaughter his son,\n\nand the angel stopped him.\n\nthe angel’s voice calls to Abram\n\nfrom the heavens, and G-d speaks:\n\n“that because you have done this thing\n\nand have not held back your son,\n\nyour only one,\n\nI will greatly bless you\n\nand will greatly multiply your seed,\n\nas the stars in the heavens\n\nand as the sand on the shore of the sea,\n\nand your seed\n\nshall take hold of its enemies’ gate.”\n\nThis is the first time that dominion,\n\nmilitary power, enters the notion of blessing.\n\nIt is as if the cleaver\n\nhas caught the eye of the blessing,\n\ntransforming it, making it martial.\n\nIn the glint of that knife,\n\nfruitfulness is not enough.\n\nBut militarized as the blessing is,\n\nit still comes mixed,\n\npromising not just martial victory\n\nbut also fruitfulness,\n\nfruitfulness of the sort we saw earlier:\n\nof G-d’s promise to the unnamed first humans\n\nin the first creation story,\n\nthe promise of fertility and increase, of p’ru urvu.\n\nparadoxically, the willingness to destroy\n\neverything that matters,\n\neverything that one loves,\n\ncan lead to a blessing –\n\na complex blessing\n\nof both multiplication and death,\n\nof self-replication and destruction.\n\nThis is not the pure vengeance\n\nOf Noah’s blessing;\n\nNot the unadulterated revenge of those words,\n\nAnd it is not the pure blessing of fruitfulness.\n\nIt is a complex blessing:\n\nA blessing made complex\n\nby a world where there are enemies,\n\nand by a world where fathers\n\naim to strike the balance\n\nbetween what they believe to be right –\n\nthe voice of G-d –\n\nand what they love.\n\nAnd where the balance they seek\n\nis sometimes poised at the tip of a cleaver.\n\n* * *\n\nAnd what does it look like\n\nFrom underneath that cleaver?\n\nWhat does it look like to\n\nthe thirtysomething Isaac\n\nbound to the altar\n\nlooking up not just at his father,\n\nbut beyond\n\nto the heavens.\n\nThe midrash gives us an answer.\n\nRashi quotes from the Tanchuma\n\nIn explaining why Isaac was blind\n\nWhen he blessed Jacob and Esau.\n\nHere’s what he says:\n\n“When Isaac was bound on the altar\n\nand his father wanted to slaughter him,\n\nat that moment,\n\nthe heavens opened up\n\nand the ministering angels saw and wept,\n\nand their tears came down\n\nand fell into his eyes;\n\ntherefore, his eyes dimmed.”\n\nPicture him immobile there,\n\nlooking clearly at what\n\nwas about to befall him.\n\nHis blindness is delayed,\n\nbut it is inevitable.\n\nHe is a man whose\n\n“ashes were as though heaped on the altar,”\n\nas Rashi puts it,\n\na man who has seen his own death,\n\nhis own sacrifice to his father’s greater good.\n\nOr as Avivah Zornberg puts it:\n\n“His awareness of death\n\nFills every moment of life.”\n\nWe see that on the day\n\nthat he chooses to bless his sons.:\n\n“Look, now, I am old,\n\nAnd I don’t know the day of my death . . .\n\nLet me bless you, before I die”\n\nHow long does he live after saying that?\n\nAn hour? A day? A week?\n\nSixty years.\n\nHe lives sixty years\n\nafter his deathbed speech.\n\nDeath fills every moment of his life.\n\n* * *\n\nIf his experience under that cleaver\n\nkept death always in his mind,\n\nand if that experience too\n\ndrove him to a post-traumatic blindness,\n\nthen what drove him to bless his boys?\n\nDid Isaac hear G-d’s blessing\n\nof his father Abraham,\n\nthe promise of both fruitfulness and dominion?\n\nWas he still there,\n\ndid he stick around\n\nafter his father dropped the cleaver?\n\nAnd if he was, could he hear anything\n\nafter what had just happened?\n\nand was G-d’s voice even audible,\n\nor directed only to his father?\n\nWe don’t know.\n\nWhat we do know is that\n\nwhen he walks up Mount Moriah,\n\nIsaac has never heard G-d’s voice.\n\nAnd from the time he walks down Moriah,\n\nmany years pass before he hears G-d’s voice.\n\nHe descends the mountain to find his mother dead,\n\nperhaps from grief at what she has just learned.\n\nThe stranger Rebecca is brought to him\n\nand he takes her into his mother’s tent,\n\nand in his mother’s tent he takes her,\n\nand there he loves her,\n\nand is consoled for his mother’s death.\n\nThis is the first time, by the way,\n\nthat word love\n\nis used in the Torah\n\nto describe the relationship\n\nbetween a man and a woman:\n\nLove with a stranger in a dead mother’s tent.\n\nAnd this love is yinachem, comforting,\n\na word related to the word for womb.\n\nBut love doesn’t conquer all.\n\nIf Isaac is the subject of this first romantic love,\n\nhe was the object\n\nof the only previous use of the word love,\n\nthe very first mention of love in the Torah:\n\n“Take your son, your only one,\n\nIsaac, whom you love.”\n\nWe know what follows from that first-ever love:\n\nthe trip up the mountain,\n\nthe binding, the raised cleaver.\n\nBeing loved is dangerous,\n\nIsaac knows, better than any of us,\n\nbut he will not shy from loving:\n\nHe will burrow into the grief of his mother’s tent,\n\nand there, with a stranger,\n\nwill build the first romantic relationship\n\non which the Torah bestows the word “love.”\n\n* * *\n\nIf he did not hear the blessing of\n\nfruitfulness and dominion\n\nthat G-d gives to his father Abraham,\n\nWhere did Isaac learn it?\n\nIt came with Rebecca.\n\nWhen Rebecca says she will go\n\nwith Abraham’s servant to marry Isaac,\n\nLaban says:\n\n“O sister!\n\nmay you grow\n\ninto thousands of myriads;\n\nmay your offspring\n\nseize the gates of their foes.”\n\nMore than one commentator\n\nhas noted the parallel\n\nbetween the blessing that Laban gives Rebecca\n\nand the blessing that G-d gives Abraham\n\nafter the Akeidah:\n\nAgain we see the pairing\n\nof a blessing of power, of dominion –\n\nseize the gates of their foes –\n\nwith a blessing of fruitfulness, of p’ru urvu.\n\nBut what’s important here\n\nis not just the parallel,\n\nbut the difference:\n\nA blessing that G-d gave\n\nin the extraordinary moment of the Akeidah\n\nis now being offered\n\nnot by G-d but by a person,\n\nand not in the extraordinary moment of the Akieidah\n\nbut in an ordinary moment of leave-taking,\n\nof a sister leaving home to get married.\n\nThat complex interweaving of multiplication and death\n\nis now a blessing uttered by human mouths.\n\nThis is the moment when the notion\n\nof the human power to offer a blessing of dominion\n\nfirst entered the Jewish people.\n\nWe still don’t know what a blessing is,\n\nbut we know that the idea that a person\n\ncan give a blessing of dominion, of martial victory,\n\nbegins with Laban,\n\nand enters the Jewish people through Rebecca.\n\n* * *\n\nAt some point Isaac must learn of blessings\n\nfrom this woman he loves,\n\nmust learn of blessings of power and dominion,\n\nblessings of fruitfulness.\n\nBut for Isaac, the years after Moriah,\n\nafter his mother’s death,\n\nwere filled with silence,\n\nnot blessings.\n\nWe get a sense of him from his first meeting with Rebecca:\n\nHe is strolling alone in the fields at dusk\n\nas a caravan approaches.\n\nIn the caravan, Rebecca asks who the solitary man is.\n\nThe servant answers her,\n\nthen goes to Isaac and tells his tale.\n\nIsaac says nothing in all of this.\n\nHe walks alone as the dark gathers,\n\nhe listens to an old man,\n\nhe takes a veiled stranger into his mother’s tent.\n\nIn this world of silence and darkness,\n\nG-d has never spoken to him.\n\nThe Torah tells us that after Abraham died,\n\nwhen Isaac and Ishmael came together\n\nto bury their father in the cave\n\nwhere their mother too was buried,\n\nG-d blessed Isaac.\n\nThe text offers nothing more –\n\nnothing about the content of that blessing,\n\nor what it means –\n\nand it does not say that G-d spoke to Isaac.\n\nAnd we have no record of Isaac himself speaking at all\n\nsince that climb up Mount Moriah.\n\nWe see him speak only\n\nafter twenty years of marriage,\n\ntwenty years of Rebecca’s barrenness,\n\nwhen he pleads with G-d\n\n“on behalf of his wife, for she was barren.”\n\nG-d “grants his plea,”\n\nbut does not speak,\n\nand even with this granted plea,\n\nit’s clear that Isaac isn’t getting quite what he wished for:\n\nthe children struggle in the womb,\n\nand his wife falls into despair:\n\n“Then why me?”\n\nOnly after Esau spurns his birthright,\n\ndoes G-d speak to Isaac,\n\nwhen the famine has driven Isaac to Abimelech.\n\nG-d’s first words to Isaac are a prohibition:\n\n“Don’t go down to Egypt!”\n\nBut then the words become more positive:\n\n“Sojourn in this land so that\n\nI may be with you and bless you,”\n\nand then the promise of fruitfulness returns:\n\n“for to you and your seed I will give all these lands\n\nand I will fulfill the oath that I swore\n\nto Abraham your father,\n\nand I will multiply your seed like the stars in the heavens\n\nand I will give to your seed\n\nall these lands,\n\nand all the nations of the earth\n\nshall be blessed through your seed.”¹\n\nThere is nothing here about seizing the enemies’ gates.\n\nFor Isaac, the blessing is simpler:\n\nof fruitfulness, not of power and dominion.\n\nG-d repeats that blessing later, saying\n\n“I will bless you and I will multiply your seed\n\nfor the sake of Abraham My servant.”\n\nIsaac, the only one of the patriarchs\n\nto have only own wife,\n\nthe only one of the patriarchs\n\nto have no concubines,\n\nis the one blessed with pure fruitfulness.\n\n* * *\n\n¹Lest Isaac think his own worth warrants such attention, G-d makes clear why he\n\nwill give this blessing: “because Abraham has listened to my voice and has kept\n\nmy charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my teachings.”\n\nThis is the Isaac of the deathbed speech,\n\nthe Isaac blinded by his ordeal on Moriah,\n\nthe Isaac who knows from his beloved Rebecca\n\nthat people can offer blessings of fruitfulness\n\nand blessings of dominion.\n\nThe Isaac who received neither from his father.\n\nNow he will make up for what his father lacked.\n\nHe will reward Esau, whom he loves.\n\nHis favorite son.\n\nThe son who loved him back.\n\nWho did for him.\n\nThe meritorious son.\n\nThis son will get blessings not only of fruitfulness,\n\nthe half-blessing Isaac got from G-d,\n\nbut of dominion too, of power:\n\nThis boy, this bowman,\n\nthis true son,\n\nwill be a leader, a conqueror.\n\nOf course it goes awry.\n\nRebecca, who knows the blessing of dominion\n\nbetter than Isaac,\n\nalso knows how to trick a man\n\nblinded by his own trauma:\n\na man who looks back\n\nwhen he should look forward.\n\nShe will switch the boys,\n\nmaneuvering Jacob into the special spot\n\nwhere Isaac gives him the blessing of dominion.\n\nFor that is the blessing he gives:\n\n“May God grant you\n\nfrom the dew of the heavens and the fat of the earth,\n\nand abundance of grain and drink.\n\nMay peoples serve you,\n\nand nations bow before you.\n\nBe overlord to your brothers,\n\nmay your mother’s sons bow before you.\n\nThose who curse you be cursed,\n\nand those who bless you, blessed.”\n\n(It sounds almost like a Scorcese film there,\n\nor the Godfather.)\n\nNow we understand why Isaac\n\nthinks he has no blessing to give:\n\nOnly one can hold dominion.\n\nIn a blessing of power,\n\nthere is only one winner.\n\nAnd that winner now is Jacob.\n\nIsaac’s desire to give the blessing\n\nthat his father never gave him,\n\nthat not even G-d gave him,\n\nhas led him to create a world\n\nthat is the opposite of what he wanted.\n\nThese are dangerous blessings,\n\nthese blessings of dominion.\n\nEsau presses on three times,\n\nas we’ve seen, ending with his most plaintive cry:\n\n“Have you not kept back a blessing for me?”\n\nOnly then, pressed to reach deeper,\n\ndoes he remember that he has\n\na blessing of fruitfulness to give,\n\nbut with his words of dominion\n\nalready loosed, he must offer too\n\nthe curse of servitude:\n\n“Look, from the fat of the earth be your dwelling\n\nand from the dew of the heavens above.\n\nBy your sword shall you live\n\nand your brother shall you serve.\n\nAnd when you rebel\n\nyou shall break off his yoke from your neck.”\n\nBoth blessings,\n\nthe blessing of Jacob and the blessing of Esau,\n\nhave the blessing of fruitfulness –\n\nthe dew of the heavens and the fat of the earth –\n\nbut dominion cannot be shared:\n\nOne dominates, one serves.\n\n* * *\n\nThere’s a midrash in Breishit Rabbah\n\nExplaining a passage in Chaye Sarah\n\nThat says simply\n\n“After the death of Abraham,\n\nG-d blessed his son Isaac.”\n\nAbraham didn’t bless him,\n\nso G-d did.\n\nWhy didn’t Abraham bless him?\n\nthe midrash wants to know.\n\nIt tells the story of a king who owned an orchard\n\nand leased it to a tenant.\n\nTwo trees grew there,\n\nentwined together:\n\nOne of vital potions,\n\none of deadly poisons.\n\nThe tenant farmer knew\n\nthat if he watered one,\n\nthe other would also be watered;\n\nif he deprived one of water;\n\nthe other would also be deprived.\n\nHe chose to do nothing:\n\n“I’m just a tenant here.\n\nI’ll finish my lease.\n\nThen let the owner decide what to do.”\n\nSo it was with Abraham,\n\nthe midrash tells us:\n\nHe didn’t know how to bless Isaac\n\nwithout also blessing Ishmael and the sons of Qeturah,\n\nAnd he didn’t know how to not bless the others,\n\nAnd bless Isaac.\n\n(As with many older midrashim,\n\nthere’s an enmity against Ishmael\n\nand the other sons,\n\nbut let’s set that aside,\n\nand focus on the deeper point.)\n\nSo Abraham decided that he’d done his part,\n\nfathering his boys;\n\nhe was just a tenant on this earth,\n\nafter all,\n\nand it was up to G-d to do the rest.\n\nAbraham, caught in the tension between\n\nequality and merit,\n\nchose equality:\n\nLeave all his sons unblessed\n\nrather than bless those not deserving of blessing.\n\nIsaac ends up getting Abraham’s blessing,\n\nbut not from Abraham; from G-d.\n\nAnd so Isaac has no personal experience\n\nof human blessing,\n\nof a father blessing his son.\n\nWhen he feels his death day near\n\n(though it’s sixty years away)\n\nhe wants to do what his father did not:\n\nHe will bless his children,\n\nwith his own hands,\n\nand not a half-blessing, but a full one:\n\nof fruitfulness and power.\n\nSo he, unlike his father,\n\nand unlike that tenant farmer,\n\nmust choose between merit and equality.\n\nHe chooses merit:\n\nHe will not worry about giving different gifts;\n\nhe will give what is merited:\n\nThe greater blessing to the greater son: Esau.\n\nUnschooled in blessings, untaught by his father,\n\na novice at blessing:\n\nHe fails miserably,\n\nnot just because he blesses\n\nwho he doesn’t want to bless,\n\nand curses who he meant to bless,\n\nbut because he sows enmity\n\nbetween his only sons,\n\na deep hatred between his twins.\n\nBy the end of the chapter,\n\nRebecca has plotted against her son;\n\nEsau is crying and enraged, planning murder;\n\nJacob has fled to Laban –\n\nof all people –\n\nthe first man to offer a blessing of power\n\nto this family.\n\nA blessing that is tearing this family apart.\n\nIs there no middle ground?\n\nNo way to bless a child\n\nwithout dividing a family?25\n\nNo way to have merit\n\nwithout sacrificing equality?\n\nNo way to have equality without sacrificing merit?\n\nNo way to water the vital tree,\n\nbut not the deadly one?\n\n* * *\n\nWhat we often forget is that these two blessings\n\nare not the only blessings of the parshah.\n\nWhen Rebecca tells Jacob to run,\n\nand Rebecca tricks Isaac a second time,\n\ncreating the cover story for Jacob’s escape,\n\nIsaac summons Jacob\n\nnot just to tell him to go to his uncle Laban,\n\nbut to bless him too:\n\n“Isaac sent for Jacob and blessed him.”\n\n“May G-d bless you,\n\nmake you fertile and numerous,\n\nso that you become an assembly of peoples.\n\nMay He grant the blessing of Abraham\n\nto you and your offspring,\n\nthat you may possess the land\n\nwhere you are sojourning,\n\nwhich G-d assigned to Abraham.”\n\nWhere did this blessing come from?\n\nIsaac had said moments ago\n\nthat he had no blessings left,\n\nAnd then pressed by Esau,\n\nfound only a meager blessing.\n\nHow now has he found this generous blessing still to give?\n\nSome would say that he never really wanted\n\nto give Esau a blessing,\n\nthat he was not tricked by the ruses,\n\nbut tricking himself,\n\nfinding a way to empower a younger son\n\nwho by rights should not have had the power.\n\nMaybe.\n\nBut for me, there is a deeper explanation.\n\nIsaac has learned\n\nthat the blessing of fruitfulness\n\nis not limited.\n\nIt is not like the blessing of dominion,\n\nWhich requires the dominant and the submissive.\n\nThe blessing of fruitfulness can be shared by all,\n\nCan be given again and again and again.\n\nAnd now – after his violent shaking,\n\nafter learning how he has been deceived –\n\nhe still has in him the blessing of fruitfulness.\n\nHe will bless his sons, no matter what,\n\nand he will do it freely, not through deceit.\n\nIsaac now turns away\n\nfrom one tradition of blessings –\n\nthe tradition begun by the hung-over Noah\n\nwho offered a blessing-curse to Canaan,\n\nthat half a blessing that the cleaver-wielding Abraham\n\nreceives at the Akeidah,\n\nthe one that Laban says aloud,\n\nand sends in Rebecca’s ears\n\nto the Jewish people.\n\nHe turns toward\n\nthe other tradition:\n\nthe blessing of fertility and increase,\n\nthe p’ru uvru blessing offered to the first people,\n\nthe other half of the oddly twined Akeidah blessing,\n\nthe tree, perhaps, of vital potions.\n\nThis is Isaac’s lineage:\n\nv’eyleh toldot yitzchok.\n\nIsaac will still bless –\n\nHe will not be the father his father was.\n\nBut his ordeal has taught him –\n\nthe anger about to tear his family apart has shown him –\n\nwhat blessings of dominion can do.\n\nThey were a beginner’s mistake, perhaps,\n\nthe first Jew’s clumsy efforts\n\nat blessing his children.\n\nThat is Isaac’s story:\n\nv’eyleh toldot yitzchok.\n\n* * *\n\nWe haven’t given up on blessings.\n\nWe still bless our children every Friday night,\n\ninvoking Ephraim and Manasseh,\n\nIsaac’s great-grandchildren.\n\nOr at least we say we bless them.\n\nWe still lay hands on them,\n\nas if there is some power in those hands,\n\nas if a magic emanates from our fingers.\n\nBut what we say are not words of power,\n\nnot even words of fruitfulness.\n\nIn our thousands of years,\n\nwe have moved to words of hope, of supplication:\n\n“May G-d bless you and keep you.\n\nMay G-d shine His face on you and be gracious.\n\nMay G-d turn his face to you and give you peace.”\n\nThese are not even blessings,\n\nin the sense that Isaac used them:\n\nthey are not professions of power\n\nto alter the future,\n\nthey are devoid of dominion of all sorts.\n\nThey are hopes,\n\nhopes that we put in G-d’s hands.\n\nHopes of safety and generosity,\n\nof light and peace.\n\nWe’ve come a long way from Isaac,\n\nfrom his story and his lineage.\n\nThese blessings –\n\nOur hands on our children’s heads on Friday night –\n\nThese are our story, our lineage, our Toldot.\n\nShabbat shalom."
