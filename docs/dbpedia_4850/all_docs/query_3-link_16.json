        "text": "Ahoy! This here is the 34th Featured Article.\n\n\"Kuzan\" has been featured, meaning it was chosen as an article of interest.\n\nFor the chapters with his alias and name in their titles, see Chapter 319 and Chapter 1081.\n\nKuzan,[6][11] better known by his alias Aokiji,[12] is one of the Ten Titanic Captains of the Blackbeard Pirates, as the captain of the Tenth Ship.[2][5] Before joining Blackbeard's crew, he served as a Marine Admiral,[1] having been taught by Monkey D. Garp.[5] He was nominated by Sengoku for the position of Fleet Admiral; however, after fighting Sakazuki for the position and losing, Kuzan resigned from the Marines.[13][4]\n\nKuzan is a major antagonist of the Long Ring Long Land Arc, one of the two secondary antagonists of the Marineford Arc (along with Borsalino),[14] a minor antagonist in the Egghead Arc, and a major antagonist in the Final Saga. In the anime, he is one of the main antagonists of the Foxy's Return Arc.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhy did Kuzan, also known as Aokiji, decide to join the Blackbeard Pirates?\n\nKuzan, also known as Aokiji, decided to join the Blackbeard Pirates to start living for himself instead of for others. He had grown resentful of his time as an enlisted officer and the limitations it placed on his personal freedom. After leaving the World Government, he was eager to live life on his own terms. This desire resonated with Blackbeard, leading Kuzan to accept the offer to become one of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains. Despite his new affiliation, Kuzan maintains his own agenda, often acting as an independent observer.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat led to Kuzan's resignation from the Marines?\n\nKuzan, also known as Aokiji, resigned from the Marines after a duel with his fellow Admiral, Sakazuki. The duel was a result of their differing views on the direction of the Marines. Kuzan was against Sakazuki's ruthless approach and chose to fight him rather than let him take over. After his defeat, Kuzan decided to resign rather than serve under Sakazuki. His resignation also came with a realization of the corruption within the World Government, leading him to become a wanderer.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWho was Kuzan's mentor during his time as a Marine Admiral?\n\nKuzan's mentor during his time as a Marine Admiral was none other than Monkey D. Garp. Known for his exceptional teaching skills, Garp has mentored many prominent figures in the Marines. Kuzan sought out Garp to further his training, surpassing the standard Marine training and ready for the next level. Garp initially refused, but eventually took Kuzan on as an apprentice, shaping him into the formidable Marine Admiral we know today.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat was the outcome of the fight between Sakazuki and Kuzan?\n\nThe duel between Sakazuki and Kuzan, two powerful characters from One Piece, was an intense battle that lasted for ten days. Both suffered heavy injuries, but in the end, Sakazuki emerged as the decisive winner. Despite Kuzan's impressive abilities, Sakazuki's power and speed were just too much for the 'one piece ice guy'.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nAppearance[]\n\nKuzan is an incredibly tall, slim, yet muscular man. At 298 cm tall, he is just slightly shorter than the other two Admirals pre-timeskip[14] and he is the shortest of the Blackbeard Titanic Captains. He has black, curly hair cut to chin length that fans out at the tips, tanned skin, and an altogether lean, long build.\n\nHis standard outfit while in the Marines consists of a white buttoned-up vest with standing collar over a long-sleeved navy-blue shirt, with matching white trousers and black dress shoes. This is all rarely accompanied by a matching white suit jacket.[15] He also wears a yellow tie divided geometrically by black lines and a sleep mask on his forehead. During his preparations for the war against Whitebeard, Kuzan had a white Marine Admiral's coat (golden epaulettes and for him being the ice user, blue cuffs) draped over him like a cape, as did the other Admirals.[14] He was also seen wearing a green and purple sleep mask at all times two years ago from the present timeline.[15] In contrast to Borsalino and Sakazuki, Kuzan is far younger than his colleagues, being less than fifty years old. His looks, combined with his manner, make him appear even younger than he actually is.\n\nAs a child, Kuzan had a grimace on his face. He wore a dirty light blue shirt and a purple pair of shorts with white stripes. He carried an umbrella tied on his back, a bottle of alcohol and a backpack. Also, his hair was curlier compared to his current hairstyle.\n\nIn his youth, Kuzan wore a white Marine cap and a shirt.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, during the Ohara Incident, Kuzan wore a dark blue bandanna with a white Marine symbol on it, as well as a pair of black round sunglasses, as well as an indigo coat with the Marine emblem on the left chest and the back.[6] This outfit was also what he wore 27 years ago, during the Battle of Edd War.[16]\n\nAfter the timeskip, his attire bears similarities to what he wore in his 20's. He wears a blue bandana that covers most of his hair, leaving only the tips which fan out. He wears a white V-neck shirt with black trousers, as well as an open dark blue green trench coat that extends past his knees. He also now wears black cowboy boots and travels with a knapsack carrying his belongings, along with his old pair of green round sunglasses. Like his rival Sakazuki, he also has grown facial hair, namely, a thin mustache and a beard.[17]\n\nAfter his duel on Punk Hazard, Kuzan received several burn scars spanning from the right side of his neck down to his entire right shoulder and onto his torso. His right hand is also heavily scarred, and he lost part of his left leg, for which he now wears a prosthesis made of ice formed by his Devil Fruit ability.[18]\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, Kuzan wears a light-colored frilled dress shirt with a cravat, dark pants, and a dark-colored trench coat with a fur collar which he wears draped on his shoulders.[3]\n\nGallery[]\n\nMain Series[]\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nOther[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nKuzan is a very laid-back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything. His lack of interest and \"Lazy Justice\" (だらけきった正義, Darakekitta Seigi?)[19] (as he describes his motto himself) often leads others to believe he cannot possibly be a Marine of such a high ranking, which causes them to underestimate him, making him all the more dangerous (it is unknown whether this is a façade or if he is genuinely lazy). However, if he deems a situation worthy, he will take action. During the Summit War at Marineford, Aokiji grudgingly shredded his usual lax and friendly nature, for a more ruthless and aggressive personality, repeatedly targeting Whitebeard himself with his Hie Hie no Mi, managing to severely injure \"Diamond\" Jozu and generally hampering any attempts at rescue or escape for the invading pirate fleets.\n\nIn accordance with the age difference between him and the other pre-timeskip Admirals, Kuzan does not refer to himself with \"Washi\" (儂?), the \"I\" typical for older men but the \"I\" more frequently used by younger men and teens, the rather rough \"Ore\" (俺?); altogether, his manner of speaking is far more lax than Borsalino's (who is exceedingly polite), containing a lot of ellipses and contractions, yet lacking the rude connotation of Sakazuki's speech, and being far more calm. He tends to begin addressing people with \"excuse me\"/\"I hate to interrupt, but…\" (ちょっとごめんな, chotto gomen na?).[17]\n\nAokiji is a compassionate man, helping Tonjit at Long Ring Land to cross the ocean with his ability and even letting Nico Robin escape the Buster Call on Ohara by providing a small boat while also a trail of ice for her to leave safely even sabotaging the ships that were about to go after her. Despite being a Marine, this compassion can even extend to pirates as long as their actions are mostly benevolent. He chose not to arrest or kill Luffy because the young pirate had defeated Crocodile beforehand, thus saving Arabasta from the latter's malevolence.\n\n“ The thing called \"justice\" changes its shape... Depending on where you stand. ”\n\n— Kuzan's view of justice.\n\nIn contrast to his former colleague, Fleet Admiral Sakazuki, Kuzan sometimes tolerates compromises with pirates.[20] He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations (such as the Ohara Incident), calling him a fool. While he follows Lazy Justice, he does understand the position his ranking puts him in and does not hesitate to do what is necessary for the needs of the Marines, even if reluctantly. He froze his former friend Jaguar D. Saul during the Ohara Incident following this reasoning.\n\nAs a Marine, Kuzan was a faithful follower of the World Government. His motto used to be \"Burning/Fired Up Justice\" (燃え上がる正義, Moeagaru Seigi?) before switching to Lazy Justice. He always tried to follow orders, but sometimes found his own ideals in opposition to them. Even as Kuzan followed his orders, he would occasionally exhibit a sense of mercy and honor other World Government officials did not. Like many characters in One Piece (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless murder of many innocent people, Kuzan has come to realize the depths to which the World Government will sink to accomplish their goals.\n\nHis relaxed demeanor while performing the more macabre of his duties is similar to that of Borsalino, making him one of the more complicated characters in the series. Despite not really wanting the position of Fleet Admiral, he was even more opposed to Sakazuki getting the position due to the latter's immense ruthlessness and dueled his fellow Admiral rather than letting him take it. After being defeated, Kuzan chose to resign from the Marines rather than stay under Sakazuki's command.\n\nHaving left the Marines and realizing just how truly corrupt the World Government had become after the timeskip, Kuzan became a wanderer. He still cares for his friends, rescuing Smoker from Donquixote Doflamingo's fury during a visit to Punk Hazard. However, Kuzan appears to be now involved in shady dealings with pirates, having joined forces with the Blackbeard Pirates for unknown reasons. Doflamingo was convinced that Kuzan had something planned while Smoker thought the same, as he was aware of Kuzan's involvement in the Underworld. Kuzan reassured Smoker that he had not changed at all, cryptically stating that he could still accomplish things as an independent observer.\n\nAfter joining the Blackbeard Pirates, Kuzan openly expressed he did so because he wishes to begin living for himself instead of for others, perhaps showing some resentment for his time as an enlisted officer and the things he was made to do or prevented from doing. He wanted to take back his personal freedom and live life on his own terms, something Teach sympathized with, and was seen being quite jolly with a somewhat dry sense of humor as they drank together.\n\nHe has a recurring phrase, \"Arara\", meaning \"Oh, my\", which is frequently used when something surprises him.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMarines[]\n\nAccording to Jinbe, Kuzan was very popular with the troops of any rank, which was why most flag officers favored him as candidate for the position of Fleet Admiral.[21]\n\nMonkey D. Garp[]\n\nKuzan is the former protégé of Monkey D. Garp,[5][22] and owes Garp a debt for helping him sometime in the past, whether the help was in training Kuzan or something else is unclear.[23] He also admired, and possibly idolized, Garp for consistently refusing promotions, since the latter was already satisfied with the rank bestowed upon him since the time of Roger. However, with Luffy's choice of piracy, even the favor and admiration are not enough to let him spare Luffy's life during their encounter at Marineford, though whether it was because he felt that Ace was too much of a risk to be left alive, or because letting Luffy go publicly would get him into severe trouble, or because he has something personal against pirates is unknown.\n\nAfter Kuzan had left the Marines and had become a member of the Blackbeard Pirates, Garp demanded his former protégé to return to the Marines, which Kuzan refused. The two fought, but Garp was able to easily overpower the former Admiral, while scolding him for losing his way.[24] After successfully subduing Garp, while the rest of the Blackbeard Pirates looked at the fallen Hero with malice, Kuzan alone gave an emotionless look.\n\nJaguar D. Saul[]\n\nKuzan was a close friend of Jaguar D. Saul. Apparently, one of the reasons that he let Robin go during the destruction of Ohara is because of Saul. He states that he respected Saul's will and felt it was his duty to watch over Robin's life until she found her place. However, this friendship was not enough for Kuzan to spare Saul's life, though it is later revealed that Saul had survived, indicating that Kuzan had indeed shown mercy towards his friend.\n\nSakazuki[]\n\nKuzan detests fellow Admiral Sakazuki, because the latter follows the policy of \"Absolute Justice\" to a deadly degree. This disgust dates back many years, as during the time when both were still Vice Admirals, Sakazuki killed innocent Ohara civilians to ensure that none of the archaeologists escaped the Buster Call, causing Kuzan to call him a fool for overdoing things.[25]\n\nFollowing Sengoku's resignation, Admiral Aokiji was strongly opposed against Admiral Akainu becoming Fleet Admiral and fought him for the position, even though Kuzan himself originally had little interest in it. They battled for 10 days, but Kuzan was defeated, and he resigned from the Marines rather than serve under Sakazuki.[26] Nonetheless, he was not above telling Smoker to warn Akainu about the danger Doflamingo posed to the new Marine Headquarters, showing a degree of concern for the well-being of the Marines, despite disagreeing with Akainu's ideals.[27]\n\nSmoker[]\n\nKuzan is also acquainted with Smoker, since he mentioned his message given to him about Luffy, though Kuzan chose not to give it, as he thought it was stupid.[28] They were also talking together in his office about Smoker's transfer to G-5.[29] In the Punk Hazard Arc, he even goes as far as to call the Vice Admiral his friend after saving him from Donquixote Doflamingo.[17]\n\nSengoku[]\n\nSengoku seems to trust and respect Kuzan well enough to lead the Marines since he nominated him to be Fleet Admiral.[13]\n\nWorld Government[]\n\nDuring his time with the Marines, Aokiji was loyal to the World Government. He did his best to follow the government's commands, but at times found his own ideals in opposition to his orders. Even as he completed his assignments, he would sometimes exhibit a sense of mercy and honor that other World Government officials did not. Similar to many of his colleagues (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless massacre of innocent people, Aokiji may have come to realize the depths to which the World Government will sink to fulfill their agendas.\n\nSeven Warlords of the Sea[]\n\nKuzan also seems to have some kind of grudge against Crocodile (if not all of the Seven Warlords of the Sea). After sparing Luffy's life, Aokiji says, \"With your defeat of Crocodile, we'll just call it even.\" Kuzan, however, did apologize (albeit sarcastically) to Jinbe for freezing the ocean to prevent escape.[30] He also stopped Donquixote Doflamingo from killing Smoker on Punk Hazard.[17]\n\nStraw Hat Pirates[]\n\nAokiji was first encountered by the Straw Hat Pirates immediately following the conclusion of the Davy Back Fight and the fight against Foxy the Silver Fox. Initially, Aokiji stated that he was not there to arrest or execute the Straw Hats, saying that he was merely there to view their progress, but also went on to say that with the collective of mavericks garnered amongst them coupling with their past exploits, pooled bounties, growing strength and future potential. In spite of his grand experience with pirates of all kinds, they deeply terrified him. However, just as the Straw Hats were about to leave, Aokiji appeared to have a change of heart, and announced that he was there to arrest Nico Robin on the account of understanding the forbidden Poneglyph text/language and for being the only survivor of Ohara. The Straw Hats attempted to protect her, but Aokiji soundly defeated all of them, including Luffy twice, but he mercifully let them live due to owing a debt to the pirate captain's grandfather and out of curiosity as to how they would survive against the increasingly daunting odds in the Grand Line. This fated encounter in turn prompts the crew to realize that they would need to start taking the grave dangers and foes that lie ahead more seriously.[31]\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nKuzan has also helped the Straw Hat Pirates by giving them information about his former admiral and mentor Z's plans to destroy the New World. He also protected the pirates from an armada of Marines led by Kizaru by creating an ice wall to cut them off from Z.\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nNico Robin[]\n\nKuzan shows some disappointment in the fact that Nico Robin had taken the path of piracy and had not changed her life for the better (although the government did have a bounty put on her, making it difficult to live a normal life). It is also revealed that Kuzan and Nico Robin share a past as when he was a Vice Admiral, he was forced to freeze his good friend, former Vice Admiral Jaguar D. Saul, due to the latter refusing to participate in the Ohara massacre. As it happened, Saul was also Robin's best friend at the time, and it became a very traumatic moment for the little girl, who is fearful of Kuzan to this date. As a testament to the giant's friendship, Kuzan allowed Robin to escape from Ohara, but he warned her that should they ever cross paths again, he would be her enemy, and he would attempt to arrest or even kill her.[32]\n\nHowever, later, he seemed to retain some concern for her well-being, as he was relieved to see her finally find a place to belong with the Straw Hat Pirates. The two did manage to encounter one-another during the post-Enies Lobby celebrations, but Aokiji decided against action, and even encouraged Robin to continue sailing with the Straw Hats, remarking they are unlike any of the other crews or organizations that she joined in the past, and they truly understand the concept of \"friendship\".\n\nMonkey D. Luffy[]\n\nKuzan is shown to have a grudging respect for the young captain, even though he is a pirate. He immediately recognized Luffy's leadership on their first encounter; Luffy chose to settle things with him in a one-on-one duel, rather than jeopardize the entire crew being wiped out by allowing them to get involved. He felt he owed Luffy for his defeat of Crocodile, but it also indebted to his grandfather Vice Admiral Garp for a yet unknown reason. Due to Kuzan's power, the fated conflict between him and the Straw Hats prompted Luffy to be less naive towards future conflicts;[31] for this reason, Kuzan served as the starting point for Luffy to push his strength beyond his limits. Kuzan is shown to be impressed by Luffy's quick rise in infamy; Luffy and the Straw Hats escape from the Marines' strongest battle force; Luffy being able to escape Impel Down, bringing several notorious convicts with him to the Summit War of Marineford; and Luffy being able to penetrate Marine Headquarters a second time to ring the Ox Bell.[29]\n\nOthers[]\n\nCamel[]\n\nCamel is Kuzan's traveling companion, having met him after leaving the Marines. The duo is said to be very compatible.[33]\n\nBlackbeard Pirates[]\n\nAfter the timeskip, Kuzan became a member of the Blackbeard Pirates,[2] acting as the captain of the tenth ship. While their first meeting had some ups-and-downs, where Laffitte suggested they kill him for his Hie Hie no Mi powers, Marshall D. Teach recruited him with some words of encouragement.[34] Some members like Jesus Burgess are not so quick to trust Kuzan because of his past as a marine, but Blackbeard pays it no mind.[35] He has a rather casual relationship with the crew, referring the Admiral by his given name without any honorifics.[36]\n\nBeing of such high rank and reputation, the lower ranking members of the Blackbeard Pirates greatly admire Kuzan, and refer him by his Marine alias despite his disconnection with the organization.[12]\n\nAbilities and Powers[]\n\nWhile an Admiral, Kuzan held power over the thousands of lower-ranked Marine personnel, his status being just below Fleet Admiral Sengoku's. He could command fleets, have a say on the overall strategy of the organization, and issue special orders, like the enactment of a Buster Call on any island he deemed a threat or delegate to lower-status government agents the same privilege.[37][38][39] With his resignation, of course, came the forfeiture of any such powers.[4] Nonetheless, despite the outward indolence that Kuzan showed in casual situations, holding such a high military office bore out his leadership prowess. Further attesting to these skills as a leader, plus his charisma, is the support Kuzan enjoyed from among subordinate ranks to become Fleet Admiral following the Summit War, as well as having Sengoku himself personally select him as his successor (as opposed to Akainu's backing coming mainly from governmental dignitaries).[13][26]\n\nAs a combatant, Kuzan with his fellow Admirals was held as the \"Greatest Military Power\" that the World Government and Marine Headquarters could bring to bear,[1][37][14] making him one of the world's strongest people. Being one of the Marines' chiefest assets, his departure had a notably detrimental impact on their force,[4] with one of the Five Elders referencing his \"enormous power\" in his dismay over Kuzan's affiliation with the Blackbeard Pirates.[2]\n\nAccording to Brannew, Kuzan's strength as a Marine \"hero\" was not gifted at birth but rather built up by training, as was the case with Monkey D. Garp. Still, since his early days in the Marines, Kuzan seemed quick to learn everything that instructors would teach him, leading him to start training under Garp as he subsequently rose through the ranks.[22] During Kuzan's time as a Vice Admiral over two decades ago, his strength was already considered abnormal for someone of his rank, as illustrated by Jaguar D. Saul, an extremely powerful giant who used to be a vice admiral himself, being taken down by Kuzan easily with a mere two attacks, after having fled at Kuzan's mere sight.[40]\n\nThe first hint given to Kuzan's reputation involved Nico Robin; though arguably the most well-composed of the Straw Hats, she completely panicked and lost her grip in the Admiral's presence, this relating to her childhood trauma (despite Kuzan having spared her as a child).[41][37] During his first encounter with the Straw Hats on Long Ring Long Land, Kuzan effortlessly overwhelmed their top three fighters in a single moment, followed by him incapacitating Robin without her able to retaliate in any measure, and subsequently dealt a swift but crushing defeat to Monkey D. Luffy in a duel that saw the rookie pirate completely at the Admiral's mercy, unable to lay so much as a scratch on him (though largely due to having no means to hurt the Admiral's Logia form).[42][43]\n\nDuring the Summit War, Kuzan's power was well-exemplified against the Whitebeard Pirates, with him engaging Whitebeard, the world's strongest pirate, head-to-head and holding his own, albeit briefly until Jozu's interference.[44] He would go on to battle Jozu, one of Whitebeard's most formidable men, and defeat him with relative ease upon exploiting an instant's distraction of his foe, robbing him of an arm and incapacitating him for the total rest of the war.[45][46] Ultimately, Kuzan himself emerged from the war almost entirely unscathed, with nothing but a small bruise to show for it.[47]\n\nAgainst Akainu, Kuzan would prove his then-fellow Admiral's equal in strength. A one-on-one duel between the two saw them meeting one another blow for blow throughout most of the fight, such that it took ten entire days to settle; though Akainu was the one to emerge victorious, both men sustained grievous injuries.[26][18]\n\nUpon encountering the Blackbeard Pirates a year after his fight against Akainu, Kuzan was able to swiftly defeat several of Blackbeard's officers, including the enormous Sanjuan Wolf and other ex-prisoners from Impel Down's Level 6, by freezing them up in a matter of seconds.[34] In the year since joining hands with Blackbeard, Kuzan has become a powerful asset of the Emperor's crew,[2] and with his position of Titanic Captain comes the authority over the Blackbeard Pirates' Tenth Ship.[5] In particular, Kuzan's knowledge of the Marines' inner workings, including the most secretive organization SWORD, provides valuable intel for the crew.[36]\n\nIn Totto Land, Kuzan managed to ice up and thus defeat Charlotte Cracker, one of Big Mom's strongest commanders with an 860,000,000 bounty, without coming to harm himself.[48]\n\nWhen he approached Garp face-to-face on Hachinosu, Kuzan began fighting on nearly even grounds against his former mentor who, despite bemoaning his decline in strength, still demonstrated monstrous fighting ability against the many Blackbeard Pirates present on the island, with Garp initially holding the upper hand against the ex-Admiral.[24][49] Ultimately though, with the aid of his fellow Titanic Captains, Kuzan managed to subdue Garp and left him on the ground impaled with a massive icicle, slowly freezing up, even though Garp had been more preoccupied with letting his students escape the island than with defeating the enemy.[50]\n\nAside from combat, Kuzan is shown to have enough navigation skill to be able to traverse the Grand Line seas using a simple bicycle (assisted by his ice powers to create a track by which to cycle on the water).[1]\n\nPhysical Abilities[]\n\nKuzan's physical prowess is immense, befitting his former Admiral position. His strength is particularly notable, having developed massive punching power from years of training under Garp since his early marine days. Like his mentor, Kuzan would use retired battleships like sandbags (\"battleship bags\") to train up the force of his punches, while not permitting himself to use his Devil Fruit powers or Haki; ultimately, Kuzan reached a point where, like Garp himself, he could cave in the armored hulls of ships with the sheer force of his blows.[22] Two years ago, against the much weaker Straw Hats, Kuzan proved his strength by casually stopping Sanji and Zoro in their tracks using a single hand to grab hold of each, simultaneously taking a punch to the gut from Luffy without seemingly turning to ice, yet not so much as reacting or losing his grip on the former two.[51] Post-timeskip on Hachinosu, Kuzan showcased power roughly on par with Garp's, at least enough to have an even exchange of blows with the elder marine that sent both of them flying (though Garp noted that his strength was nowhere near what it used to be).[49]\n\nAttesting to his tremendous endurance and strength of will, Kuzan managed to fight his equal Akainu for a total of ten days before being defeated, and despite suffering grievous injuries (including the loss of a leg) he recovered.[26] Kuzan's durability, likewise, is impressive. At Marineford, he remained unfazed by a Haki-imbued kick from Marco that sent him flying with great force[52] and later a violent, Haki-enforced tackle from the diamond-bodied Jozu, the latter of which (coming as a sneak attack) left him only slightly bleeding from the mouth.[53] When fighting Garp on Hachinosu, Kuzan was able to swiftly recover from being subjected to the latter's powerful, Haki-infused Blue Hole attack that slammed him into the ground headfirst, hard enough to make a deep crater,[54] Kuzan reemerging with only some minor bruises.[55] When both Kuzan and Garp subsequently exchanged Haki punches to the face that caused a massive explosion and sent both hurtling back,[49] Kuzan rose up moments later with, still, only superficial wounds on him.[56]\n\nThe ex-Admiral is also extremely fast and agile, able to close large distances and jump to extreme heights within seconds (often implicitly aided by his powers, traces of ice being visible on spots he leaps from).[57][58][59] His attack speed is notable as well, with him managing to intercept Whitebeard's quake-powered naginata mid-swing by fully encapsulating its wielder in ice and subsequently avoid a quick, Haki-infused surprise thrust of Whitebeard using the same weapon, by seamlessly opening up a hole in his icy self just large enough to avoid contact with the blade.[44] Against Doflamingo (a Kenbunshoku Haki user), Kuzan proved fast and stealthy enough to sneak up on him, taking his back without the Warlord noticing until Kuzan spoke, and thereupon prevent Doflamingo from dealing a killing blow to Smoker by icing him up faster, with precision, than he could move his hand, while leaving Smoker untouched.[17][60]\n\nOtherwise, the Admiral has shown rather acute hearing, able to notice underwater activity from hundreds of meters away[61] and overhearing Laffitte's whispers to Blackbeard amidst loud partying in a bar.[62]\n\nDevil Fruit[]\n\nFurther information: Hie Hie no Mi\n\nKuzan ate the Hie Hie no Mi, a Logia-type Devil Fruit[63] that allows him to create, control, and transform his body into ice. Compared to most Logia users who, when transformed, can let physical attacks pass through their \"fluid\" bodies, Kuzan is more easily hit since ice is a solid element. However, he still goes unharmed by enemy attacks that are not infused with Haki; instead of dissipating out of harm's way, his body shatters apart when struck, only to reform as effortlessly as any Logia user thereafter.[42][43][64][53]\n\nKuzan is able to form constructs out of ice. In combat, Kuzan can create weapons, primarily forming swords and spears,[65][66] but can also make more elaborate constructs, like a giant pheasant to send flying at enemies.[67] By imbuing his icy fist with Haki, he can also greatly empower his punches.[49]\n\nOn a smaller scale, Kuzan can quickly incapacitate enemies by freezing them solid on contact or from a distance by launching waves of ice,[68] and may even encase opponents in large spheres of ice to make escape even more difficult.[44] Aside from potentially suffering dangerous degrees of frostbite and hypothermia, those frozen by Kuzan are left in a very fragile state, as they body could be shattered by any kind of impact;[42][43][45][46][60][34] however, a person can be freed from the ice if they are thawed out properly and carefully.[43] On a larger scale, Kuzan can spread his freeze outward over tremendous distances, casually icing over several square kilometers of ocean within seconds of dipping his hand in the water, or turning a pair of mountainous tsunamis into icebergs just as swiftly, using icy beams shot from his hands.[69][57] Despite the speed at which Kuzan can flash-freeze massive amounts of water, the ice he thereby forms tends to be extremely thick and able to persist for long periods—several days even.[70][71][72]\n\nKuzan can also bypass his weakness to water and falling therein by freezing it before he can sink below the surface. Not only does this keep him from drowning, it lets him prevent enemies from escaping by sea, by freezing their ships in place, or render the sea a solid battleground for entire armies to fight on.[73][74]\n\nEven by Logia standards, this ability has impressive potential—when used excessively for ten days straight, it was able to permanently alter the very climate of half an island, rendering it a frozen, uninhabitable wasteland with constantly raging blizzards.[75]\n\nHaki[]\n\nMain article: Haki\n\nAs a former Marine Admiral, Kuzan is a highly skilled Haki user.[76]\n\nBusoshoku Haki[]\n\nDuring the Summit War, Kuzan was seen using advanced-grade Busoshoku Haki to negate an extremely powerful quake shockwave sent out by Whitebeard, by generating, with his fellow Admirals, an emitted shield combination of their three Haki to disperse said shockwave.[77] On its own, Kuzan's Haki is shown to be enough to allow the ex-Admiral to have an even exchange of blows with Garp, a wielder of both Busoshoku and Haoshoku Haki, causing a massive explosion when they struck one another with their Haki-imbued fists.[49]\n\nKenbunshoku Haki[]\n\nKuzan possesses the ability to use Kenbunshoku Haki.[7]\n\nWeapons[]\n\nKuzan has been shown to be adept at using weaponry formed from ice, like a hand-wielded sword to clash with another swordsman.[65]\n\nHistory[]\n\nPast[]\n\nKuzan was born 49 years ago in the South Blue.[7]\n\nJoining the Marines[]\n\nIn his youth as a Marine, Kuzan sought out Monkey D. Garp to further his training, having felt he learned enough from his previous Marine instructors and surpassed the standard Marine training. He believed he was ready for the next level, so he asked Garp to take him on as an apprentice. Garp initially refused, but eventually, through unknown events, Garp did indeed end up training Kuzan. They trained using \"punching ships\", the same thing as punching bags, only they trained by punching the bow of scraped ships, leaving large indents in the ships they practiced on. As a rule of the training, they were not allowed to use Haki or Devil Fruit powers, just raw brute strength. During this training, Garp became more casual with Kuzan even talking to him about his family.[22] Even though he joined the Marines, Kuzan stated that he never held the World Government in high esteem to begin with.[78]\n\nA Storm in the Edd War[]\n\nWhen the Marines learned that the Roger Pirates and the Golden Lion Pirates were about to do battle in the Edd War, three years before the death of the Pirate King, Kuzan was in Marineford and walked with Monkey D. Garp, Jaguar D. Saul, Sakazuki and Tsuru. He told Garp that him turning down another promotion was really something cool.[79]\n\nOhara Incident[]\n\nKuzan was among the Marine forces present during the incident at Ohara that prompted the Marines to put a bounty on Nico Robin's head. At that time, Vice Admiral Kuzan appeared to have been responsible for the deployment of CP9 in pursuit of the \"criminal\" archaeologists of Ohara.[6]\n\nHe was one of the five Vice-Admirals taking part in the Buster Call on Ohara. During the attack, the destruction of the civilian fleet, ordered by Vice Admiral Sakazuki (who was later promoted to Admiral and later Fleet Admiral), came as a complete shock to Kuzan. The original order that had been sent was for all those who had not been involved with the Ohara scholars and the Poneglyph, to be safely transported off the island. However, Sakazuki's course of action was the complete opposite.\n\n“ And remember this: I am not your ally... If you do anything, I'm the 'enemy' that will be the first to catch you. ”\n\n— Kuzan's warning to Robin[80]\n\nKuzan then froze Jaguar D. Saul using his Devil Fruit powers. He helped Robin to escape via the use of his Devil Fruit powers, by freezing a trail in the ocean for her boat to sail safely through. Before her departure, he warned her that he is not her ally despite this one assistance, and would be quick to come after her, if he ever felt that she was a threat.[81]\n\nAs part of his plot in saving Robin, Kuzan froze Spandine's ship's rudder, but regardless, Spandine saw Robin and had her marked for capture. Kuzan seemed troubled when he was present at the meeting between the Marines and Spandine.[82]\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nSometime after being promoted to Admiral, Aokiji came across an island being rocked by a massive disturbance. He looked around the island, seeing the ruins of a large city and a small boy named Grount huddled nearby. Wondering if Grount was responsible for the destruction, Aokiji watched as Grount revealed his monstrous left arm, which he could not control. Grount unwillingly attacked Aokiji with his left arm, but the Admiral dodged it before finally relieving the boy of his suffering by freezing his arm and knocking him out.\n\nAokiji took Grount into the Marines, where he was given a metal attachment to control his left arm. Aokiji trained Grount alongside Bonham and Zappa but kept him out of the front lines until he could master his power.[83]\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nWater 7 Saga[]\n\nLong Ring Long Land Arc[]\n\nTwenty years later, when the Marine Headquarters discovered that Aokiji was missing, they informed the Five Elders about the situation. The Five Elders were upset with Aokiji's action and remarked that he should watch his rank.[1]\n\nAokiji went to Long Ring Long Land, having tracked Robin there. Standing in front of Tonjit's house, he slept.\n\nAfter the Straw Hat Pirates finished the Davy Back Fight, they returned to Tonjit with the pirate flag. Gleefully, Tonjit walked to the door of his house, only to bump into the sleeping Aokiji. Aokiji woke up and began to make excuses that he wanted to inspect something. He froze the water with his power to create a bridge for Tonjit to cross.[84]\n\nAfter the Straw Hats bid their goodbyes to Tonjit, Aokiji lied by saying that he once tried to arrest Robin. He then started to talk nonsense, confusing the pirates and making Sanji and Luffy angry with him. Aokiji told Luffy that his anger reminded him of his grandfather, which startled Luffy. After that, Aokiji then announced that maybe they should just die.[23]\n\nAokiji decided to test the Straw Hat Pirates by saying that everyone around Robin got wiped out with her being the only person left standing, referring to the actual situation that happened to Robin's mother. The truth is Robin only ran away from people who tried to kill her or turn her in. The Straw Hats never knew about Robin's past and stand with Robin against him. Aokiji started to call Robin a demon and an unfortunate woman. He told them that one day they would regret having Robin with them.\n\nAngry and tired of Aokiji's taunting game, Robin used her Devil Fruit abilities to break him into pieces against Usopp's wishes. Thinking he was dead, the Straw Hats prepared to flee, but Aokiji returned back in one piece, grabbed some grass and breathed on the grass to create an ice saber. He attempted to strike Robin, but was parried by Zoro. The saber was kicked away (and thus destroyed) by Sanji shortly thereafter.\n\nZoro rushed in attempting to cut him only to be caught by the wrist. Sanji tried to kick him but was grabbed by the thigh. Luffy tried to punch him in the stomach, but when he connected, his hand was frozen. Sanji and Zoro were also frozen on the leg and arm respectively. Nami blocked Aokiji with her staff but was pushed away.\n\nHe then froze Robin into solid ice and threatened to punch her into pieces, claiming that the world would be better off without her. Luffy saved Robin in the nick of time, but Aokiji said that they should not try to save her and was going to stomp on her, but Usopp and Chopper managed to save her and drag her back to the ship.\n\nLuffy ordered his crew to go back to the ship as he faced Aokiji one-on-one. Luffy tried to send him flying with his Gomu Gomu no Storm, but he was quickly frozen up by Aokiji. Having Luffy frozen solid, he realized that Luffy tricked him. By agreeing to a one-on-one fight with Luffy, he could not attack his crew. He remarked that Robin would bring him only misfortune. He then decided not to kill Luffy, saying that he did the World Government a favor by defeating Crocodile and commented that Smoker's message was too stupid.[28] As Aokiji left on his bike across the ocean, he noticed that the Straw Hat Pirates were heading to Water 7, which is close to the Marine Headquarters.\n\nHe then called Spandam, who was ready to have his unit finish a mission, and informed him that Robin was heading to Water 7. It was later stated by Spandam (though never shown) that Aokiji also gave him the Golden Den Den Mushi at this time in order to summon a Buster Call.[85] Spandam decided to wait until Robin arrived at Water 7.\n\nEnies Lobby Arc[]\n\nAfter the Straw Hats defeated the seemingly invincible CP9, rescued Nico Robin from Enies Lobby, and escaped the Buster Call, Aokiji was seen again witnessing the aftermath of their raid at Enies Lobby and the Buster Call attack. They had passed his \"test\" far beyond his expectations. When he was asked by a Marine over the Den Den Mushi whether they should continue to pursue the Straw Hats, Aokiji declined, noting the Marines suffered heavy casualties already, calling their battle \"a complete defeat\".[86]\n\nPost-Enies Lobby Arc[]\n\nAokiji later visited Water 7 and had a secret conversation with Robin while the Straw Hats were having a party with the Water 7 citizens. He then revealed to Robin that he was good friends with Saul and allowed Robin to escape Ohara because of this friendship. He also said that he intended to have her eliminated by CP9, as he had come to see her as danger after 20 years of living as a rogue, but he did not expect CP9 to lose to the Straw Hats. However, when he asked Robin why she did not run from the Straw Hats, Robin told him that she does not want to see them die. Aokiji bid Robin farewell, telling her to live strong, remarking that Ohara is not fully destroyed, presumably meaning that the memory and purpose of Ohara live on within her. He then left by appearing to instantly disappear with his ice abilities.[87]\n\nA while later, he was seen leaving Dock 1 on his bike. Sometime later, Robin speculated that he was responsible for excluding all the non-Straw Hat Pirates (outside Franky, who joined the Straw Hats after the incident) from the report on the Enies Lobby incident and instead making them out to be innocent civilians who got caught up in all the commotion.\n\nLater, he asked for Garp to lend him a ride on his ship back to Marine Headquarters because riding back there on his bike was \"such a bother\".[88] He witnessed the Straw Hats' new ship, the Thousand Sunny, leaping into the air to escape and seemingly impressed by it, smiled.[89]\n\nSummit War Saga[]\n\nAmazon Lily Arc[]\n\nFollowing the announcement of Portgas D. Ace's execution, Aokiji was summoned to lead the Marines in the battle against the Whitebeard Pirates and arrived at Marine Headquarters.[90]\n\nMarineford Arc[]\n\nAokiji sat over the execution platform of Portgas D. Ace with his fellow Admirals, watching over it.[14]\n\nWhen Whitebeard's forces arrived and their captain used his Gura Gura no Mi powers to create two massive tidal waves, Aokiji freezes them both with Ice Age, then attacks Whitebeard with his Partisan. However, he is shattered by one of Whitebeard's seismic waves, which the Admiral shrugs off. He then froze the bay water of Marineford, which not only stopped all the pirate ships from moving, but also served as a foothold for them. Having reformed himself at some point, Aokiji can only remark at the motley crew that Luffy helped gather at Impel Down for his attempt at freeing Ace from the Marines.[91]\n\nAfter Whitebeard is attacked by Squard, Aokiji follows Sengoku's orders and freezes Buggy and the Impel Down prisoners loyal to him, stopping them from showing the world any more of the battle. When Whitebeard fired off a shockwave towards the execution platform itself, the three Admirals, including Aokiji, are seen raising their hands in order to block the sheer concussive force of the shockwave. Aokiji mutters how slow they are at raising the encircling walls in time. Akainu chides Aokiji for his ice being the problem, with Kizaru chiming in for the latter to just melt his ice.\n\nLater, when Luffy leaps over the siege wall, with a large piece of broken mast in hand, Aokiji comments on how, despite how far he has come, that Luffy was still not ready to \"play with the big boys\". When Luffy simply brings the broken mast piece to bear, Aokiji freezes it before it could somehow damage the three Admirals and watches as the frozen piece of wood smashes beneath the assault of kicks almost immediately following it.\n\nLuffy, having been (once more) prevented from reaching the execution platform, then gets cornered by Aokiji. He comments that he is in debt to Luffy's grandfather but that he has no choice since Luffy himself chose this path of death for himself. He stabs Luffy through his shoulder with an Ice Saber and as he is about to impale him again, Marco intervenes and shatters the spear with a single kick that knocks Aokiji away from Luffy.\n\nAokiji is then seen blocking Whitebeard's bisento attack with his Ice Ball. After seeing that he failed to freeze Whitebeard's earthquake, he commented that he did not know that earthquakes could not be frozen. He then got stabbed by Whitebeard's bisento, to which pirates are seen wondering if Aokiji was stabbed with Haki and if he was dead. Aokiji told them not to spout nonsense before grabbing the bisento and using his Ice Block Partisan attack. All of a sudden, Jozu attacks him and Aokiji is caught off-guard, even bleeding from his mouth.\n\nWhen Jozu is distracted upon seeing Marco being shot by Kizaru's laser beam, Aokiji warns him that he should not be getting distracted and freezes his right arm, and then his entire body, forcing him to fall over resulting in his right arm shattering, before commenting that the Whitebeard Pirates are finished. When Luffy unleashes a burst of Haoshoku Haki, Aokiji is seen shocked and sweating at his power.\n\nAfter Ace is freed, he attacks Ace and Luffy, but Ace blocked his attack with his fire. Aokiji is later seen with a solemn expression after witnessing Akainu striking Ace from behind with a magma fist. After Whitebeard's death, Aokiji froze the sea once again in order for the pirates to not leave Marineford.\n\nWhen Jinbe tries to escape into Marineford Bay with Luffy and notices that it was frozen over, Aokiji is seen nearby apologizing to Jinbe. As the Heart Pirates are leaving with Luffy in their submarine, Aokiji attempts to freeze them with an Ice Age, but the Heart Pirates' submarine manages to elude him. After that, he stands down.\n\nPost-War Arc[]\n\nHe is later seen in his office in Marineford with Commodore Smoker, commenting on Luffy's return to Marineford and the ringing of the Ox Bell. The Admiral wonders if the Ox Bell ringing was some kind of message. Aokiji then spoke with Smoker about the Commodore's request for transfer to Marine outpost G-5 in the New World. Unsure of being able to grant his transfer, he assured he would negotiate with Sengoku for approval.[29] Aokiji was then nominated by Sengoku to be the next Fleet Admiral upon the latter's resignation.[13]\n\nDuring the Timeskip[]\n\nA Fierce Duel and Resignation[]\n\nEven though Sengoku supported Aokiji as a candidate for the next Fleet Admiral, many of the upper brass of the World Government nominated Akainu. Aokiji strongly opposed Akainu becoming Fleet Admiral and fought him for the position.[26] They battled on Punk Hazard, with the fight lasting for ten days.\n\nAccording to Smoker, the battle between these two was so ferocious that it literally changed the weather of Punk Hazard Island.[92] Eventually, Akainu ended up as the winner and even though Kuzan survived the battle, he unfortunately did not escape unscathed. He parted from the battle with a staggering level of scars and with his left leg reduced to a stump. Though crippled, Kuzan used his Devil Fruit powers to generate a replacement limb out of ice. Afterwards, Kuzan resigned from the Marines, not wanting to work under Sakazuki.[4]\n\nAfter Resignation[]\n\nAfter leaving the Marines, Kuzan met a large penguin named Camel and the two of them became traveling companions.[33]\n\nDonquixote Doflamingo and Smoker have speculated that sometime around the timeskip, Kuzan affiliated himself with the Underworld of Brokers. Kuzan has neither confirmed nor denied these suspicions.[93]\n\nOne year after leaving the Marines, Kuzan encountered the Blackbeard Pirates at a bar in the New World. He got in a fight with Blackbeard's crew and froze them before Blackbeard demanded him to undo his powers. Kuzan explained that Blackbeard's crew started the fight, though he agreed to thaw them out afterwards. The Blackbeard Pirates had a drink with Kuzan as he discussed with them about his battle with Sakazuki. The crew then talked about Hinokizu and his possession of one of the Road Poneglyphs needed to reach Laugh Tale, in which Kuzan replied he did not know who he was and that the Poneglyphs give him bitter memories, remembering he took fate into his own hands for his friend and Nico Robin back at Ohara. Upon hearing Laffitte suggesting to Blackbeard that they should kill him and steal his Devil Fruit power, Kuzan became furious. Blackbeard apologized and said he had no intention of doing so, and instead wanted Kuzan to join the crew. Although Kuzan was at first irritated at their request, Blackbeard mentioned that Kuzan is no longer with the World Government and can make his own choices, while pointing out that he and his crew seek to fulfill their own interests. In the end, Kuzan accepted the offer and became one of Blackbeard's Ten Titanic Captains, leading the tenth ship of the pirate fleet.[34]\n\nDressrosa Saga[]\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nOne Piece Film: Z[]\n\nKuzan first appeared near Firs Island on his bicycle, watching an explosion caused by the fight between Z and Borsalino. He then left after asking himself what the Marines were doing.\n\nIn Secon Island's springs, he met Luffy, Zoro, Sanji, and Brook. After he calmed them down by saying that he wasn't out to capture them, he warned them of Z's power and his mission to destroy the New World. Brook did not recognize him, but panicked when they told him in that he was an Admiral. Kuzan reassured them he was not there to capture them and had given up being an Admiral.\n\nBrook asked what he was then, with Kuzan finding being questioned bothersome. He thought on the question and was unable to think of a proper answer confusing them further. However, he told them again he was not their enemy anymore and reminded them if he was, he would not be in a hot spring where he could not use his powers. As Kuzan got out of the water, the Straw Hats saw his battle-scarred body and his missing leg that he regrew with his ice powers. He merely said he got carried away, when explaining this. Kuzan and the Straw Hats were seen making their way to port, as he talked about the great age of pirates. He pondered to himself if pirates were made from the One Piece existing, or if the One Piece existed because of the pirates. Kuzan looked out to sea, telling them how when some follow their dreams, it could lead to pain and sadness of others. He told them that Z planned to destroy piracy by destroying the One Piece. He had chosen to follow Z's journey but is unsure what actions he himself must take. He then departed, telling Luffy he would find Z on the island.\n\nAfter Luffy's second battle with Z, Kuzan met his former instructor. Kuzan gave him a bottle of wine and prepared to fight him but chose not to and just walked away. He told Z he used to drink that because of him, looking up to him. He told Kuzan to not lecture him, and he would go forward with his plan no matter what. Kuzan told him he might die, as Z responded that was no problem if he could rid the world of evil. Z told him to step aside, and the next time they meet they would share drinks together. Kuzan and Z faced each other, but each side unwilling to fight one another as enemies. Kuzan backed down and left Z to his machinations.\n\nLater, he met with the Straw Hat crew again and explained Z's plan to use the Dyna Stones to destroy all the three Endpoints and then release the Grande Imbuto, which would destroy the New World and everyone in it, pirates and civilians alike. Now that two of the Endpoints had been destroyed, Z is about to go to the last one, Piriodo, and unless the Straw Hats stop him, the Pirate Era would end. The Endpoints had been considered a legend; with most thinking it was nonsense. The government covered up the truth about them, to dissuade pirates from using it. That only the World Government and highest-ranking officers of the Marines knew about it. He laments that it was an Admiral abusing this knowledge above all else. He reminded them that he was not doing this out of power, but to punish pirates.\n\nLuffy remains undeterred despite being defeated twice by Z, vowing to chase him down and get his hat back. If he let Z keep his hat, he could never face Shanks or be worthy of the Pirate King title. Kuzan then gave the crew an Eternal Pose leading to Piriodo. Nami asked why he was helping them, as he ignored the question and warned them that their journey would be very dangerous. If they lost to Z, they would be destroyed along with the New World. Or, if they won, they would be attacked by the Marines. With that said he left them to their own fates. The crew began making their preparations to leave, as Kuzan and Robin shared a small moment.\n\nKuzan was then seen watching Z and Luffy's final battle. He later helped his former instructor to protect Ain, Binz, and the Straw Hat Pirates from Borsalino's fleet attack by creating an ice wall so that Z could fight to his heart's content. He was later seen at Z's grave, telling Ain and Binz that he died like he wanted to.[94]\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nPunk Hazard Arc[]\n\nSometime during the events of the Punk Hazard Arc, Kuzan decided to go to Punk Hazard.[95] He eventually arrived shortly after the conflict between Doflamingo and the G-5 Marines. Before Doflamingo could deliver the killing blow to Smoker, Kuzan suddenly appeared, claiming that the Vice Admiral was his friend.[17]\n\nDoflamingo ignored Kuzan and attempted to finish off Smoker, but the former Admiral froze Doflamingo solid. The Warlord freed himself from the ice and walked away with Buffalo and Baby 5, having no interest in fighting Kuzan. After this, Smoker discussed with Kuzan about the latter's current status. Smoker also wondered if he had some kind of connection to the Underworld. Kuzan stated he was still himself, seemingly reassuring Smoker. He then told Smoker to be wary of Doflamingo and to ask the Fleet Admiral to dispatch the Admirals as soon as possible. He also asked the G-5 Marines to not reveal his presence there, to which they agreed.[96]\n\nWhole Cake Island Saga[]\n\nFrom the Decks of the World: The 500,000,000 Man Arc[]\n\nKuzan was seen reading a newspaper while Camel was cooking barbecue.[97]\n\nWano Country Saga[]\n\nGerma 66's Ahh... An Emotionless Excursion[]\n\nKuzan and Van Augur went to Cacao Island.[98] When Charlotte Cracker tried to stop them from kidnapping Pudding, Kuzan froze Chocolat Town, including Cracker and the residents. Kuzan and Augur then took Pudding back to their ship.[99]\n\nFinal Saga[]\n\nEgghead Arc[]\n\nKuzan was later present at Hachinosu after Koby was abducted by the Blackbeard Pirates and overheard Teach's plans with Koby. After hearing Koby was part of SWORD, he explained SWORD's nature to Teach and the Captains present.[36] When Garp alongside SWORD and a Marine squad invaded Hachinosu to rescue Koby, Kuzan appeared in front of them, freezing Hibari, stating he could not let Koby escape due to his captain not being thrilled about the escape. He then remembered when Teach approached him on an island about joining his crew, effectively offering him the choice to be free and chase his own interests under his flag. As Garp then demanded from him to unfreeze Hibari, set Koby free and rejoin the Marines, Kuzan stated he could not grant any of these wishes. He then attacked Garp with Ice Ball, but Garp broke free easily and smashed Kuzan into the ground with Blue Hole.[24]\n\nKuzan managed to return to the fight quickly and was helped by his fellow Titanic Captains Vasco Shot, Avalo Pizarro and Shiryu. After Shiryu managed to grievously wound Garp, Kuzan told his underlings to stand aside as he knew they were still no match for his former mentor even in his weakened state. As the two continued to fight Kuzan remember how Garp lamented to him how his son Dragon and grandson Luffy became a revolutionary and pirate respectively and seeing how Kuzan himself turned out, he commented that Garp has a habit of raising enemies, with Garp simply saying he was done with him as the two clashed.[100] Koby managed to successfully escape with the rest of SWORD as Garp decided to stay behind and fight. Kuzan and the other Blackbeard Pirates ultimately overwhelmed the Hero to the Marines, as Kuzan stabbed Garp through the chest with a huge icicle. Kuzan and his crewmates then converged around Garp.[101]\n\nFollowing their fight, Kuzan listened to Vegapunk's pre-recorded worldwide message that predicted the earthquake would increase the world's sea level substantially.[102] When the broadcast was nearing it's end, Kuzan looked into the distance coldly as he listened to Vegapunk statement that the fate of the world would be decided by whoever was able to claim the One Piece.[103]\n\nMajor Battles[]\n\nKuzan vs. Jaguar D.

In the anime, he met them much later at a different island and showed his powers helping some shipwrecked passengers as opposed to Tonjit.\n\nIn the anime, after the war, Aokiji is seen standing on the bow of a warship vessel approaching Marineford, sneezing the very moment Sengoku mentions him to Kong as his chosen successor. When he enters the headquarters building, a Marine officer approaches him in tears, reporting his inability to capture Luffy. Aokiji merely pats him on the shoulder and tells him that it is okay.\n\nTranslation and Dub Issues[]\n\nKuzan's alias, \"Aokiji\", means \"Blue Pheasant\" in Japanese. 青 = Ao = Blue (this \"Ao\" Color can be referred as both blue or green, depending on the Japanese phrase) 雉 = Kiji = Pheasant. It was literally translated in most dubs. Kiji was written katakana キジ from the introduction of Kuzan, but was shown in kanji in his introduction box in the Summit War of Marineford. After that, it was reverted to katakana.\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nAokiji has been a choice character in several series of merchandise. He has been featured in the Portrait of Pirates Figuarts Zero, One Piece DX Figure, One Piece High Spec Coloring Figure, Super Modeling Soul One Piece lines. But also, in World Collectable,One Piece Super Effect, One Piece Amazing Log Collection,Deformeister Petit One Piece,One Piece Super Deformed Figures, Anichara Heroes, One Piece Full Face Jr., One Piece Battle One Piece Attack Motions, One Piece Great Deep Collection, and the One Piece Logbox series.\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nPlayable Appearances[]\n\nEnemy Appearances[]\n\nOne Piece: Dragon Dream!\n\nOne Piece: Unlimited Adventure\n\nOne Piece Romance Dawn: The Dawn of the Adventure\n\nOne Piece: Pirate Warriors\n\nOne Piece: Unlimited World Red\n\nOne Piece: World Seeker\n\nOne Piece Odyssey\n\nSupport Appearances[]\n\nOne Piece: Pirates Carnival\n\nOne Piece: Great Pirate Colosseum\n\nOther Appearances[]\n\nOther Media[]\n\nIn One Piece Premier Show 2011, Aokiji and the other admirals come to the Marine Island where the Straw Hat Pirates try to rescue Nami and Robin. They leave after Bentham, disguised as a marine, tells them that Charlos has been injured and needs to retreat. In One Piece Premier Show 2013, Kuzan comes to Paradise Island and stops Doflamingo from helping Lambor Bukini. He and Jinbe chase off Caribou and Coribou before Luffy defeats Bukini.\n\nAokiji appears in Super Kabuki II: One Piece during the retelling of the Marineford Arc.\n\nKuzan appears in the Nami and Marineford versions of the Hungry Days commercials.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nKuzan's epithet, along with the other admirals' (Aokiji, Akainu, and Kizaru), are taken from Momotaro legends (Momotaro met Pheasant, Dog, and Monkey as friends to accompany him in his journey).\n\nIn the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th fan polls of most popular characters, Kuzan was ranked 16th, 17th, 22nd, 26th, and 36th respectively.\n\nIn the 3rd of the fan polls, he is ranked as the second most popular Marine after Smoker. Overthrowing him in the 4th and 5th, being Kuzan the most popular Marine (in charge or retired). But being again the second most popular in the 6th, behind Donquixote Rosinante.\n\nKuzan is the first admiral (though technically former) to be shown after the timeskip.\n\nKuzan's favorite foods are sherry wine, dairy milk, and coffee (original Kuzan blend).[7]\n\nHis given name can mean \"Nine Mountains\" if written in kanji (九山 (Kuzan?)), a phrase repeatedly named in post-timeskip One Piece: Roronoa Zoro mentions it in reference to his ability to \"cut everything\"; specifically, he states that \"of the nine mountains and five seas, and under the sky, there's nothing [he] cannot cut\". In this sense, Kuzan (九山, Kuzan?) means \"all the land\", as Gokai (五海, gokai?) is \"all the seas\", and the entire phrase is an allegory for \"all the world\".[104]\n\nKuzan was the only marine whose codename does not include an animal in the Chinese Zodiac. However, the pheasant is included in the family Phasianidae, which also includes the rooster, so it is safe to assume that Kuzan's epithet may represent the rooster in the Chinese Zodiac.\n\nIn Volume 1000 and the Vivre Card - One Piece Visual Dictionary's timeline, Kuzan was said to have joined the Marines 30 years ago at 19 years old.[8][7] This appears to contradict the flashback from Chapter 1087, which features a significantly younger-looking Garp than how he looked in the same timeframe during Chinjao's flashback in Chapter 719. Notably, Garp looked closer to his younger depiction in One Piece Film: Z's promotional materials in Kuzan's flashback.\n\nSBS-Based Trivia[]\n\nKuzan was modeled on the late actor Yusaku Matsuda, best known for playing private eye Shunsaku Kudō on the cult TV series Detective Story (探偵物語, Tantei Monogatari?). Apart from hair and clothing styles, even Kuzan's birthday was drawn from Matsuda's.[105][9]\n\nA fan asked Oda if Kuzan's penis is made out of ice, and Oda answered that it is.[106]\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nMarine Officers:Subordinates and Others:Non-Canon:\n\nFormer MarinesMarine Officers:Subordinates and Others:Non-Canon:\n\nTransportationShip(s):Vehicles:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Fighting Style Based:Weapon Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesMarine Bases:Groups:Events:Concepts:Story Arcs:Cover Stories:Movies:Specials, Featurettes and OVAs:Other:\n\nAdmiral:Ten Titanic Captains:Pets:Other Members:Subordinates:Allies and Affiliates:Ships:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Weapon Based:Fighting Style Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Cover Stories:Locations:Movies:Others:\n\nFour BluesEast Blue:West Blue:South Blue:North Blue:\n\nGrand LineParadise:New World:\n\nFormerRetired:Arrested:Deceased:\n\nOthersSpace:Unknown Location:Non-Canon:\n\nCanonStraw Hat Grand Fleet:Red Hair Pirates:Cross Guild:Buggy Pirates/Buggy's Delivery (Former)‡:Black Cat Pirates:Krieg Pirates:Arlong Pirates (Former)‡:Baroque Works (Former)‡:Bliking Pirates:Whitebeard Pirates (Former: Disbanded)‡:God's Army:Thriller Bark Pirates:\n\nHogback\n\nAbsalom (Deceased)†\n\nPerona (Former: Defected)‡\n\nKuja Pirates:Golden Lion Pirates:\n\nIndigo\n\nScarlet (Non-Canon)≠\n\nRevolutionary Army:New Fish-Man Pirates:Donquixote Pirates (Former: Arrested)‡:Blackbeard Pirates:Big Mom Pirates:Beasts Pirates:\n\nKing\n\nQueen\n\nJack\n\nX Drake (Former)‡ (Unknown status)?\n\nPage One\n\nUlti\n\nWho's-Who\n\nBlack Maria\n\nSasaki\n\nSheepshead (Unknown status)?\n\nGinrummy (Unknown status)?\n\nBasil Hawkins (Unknown status)?\n\nHoled'em\n\nSpeed (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nDobon\n\nBabanuki (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nDaifugo (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nSolitaire\n\nBao Huang\n\nBriscola (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nFourtricks\n\nHamlet (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nPoker (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nMizerka (Former: Tamed by Tama)‡\n\nNon-CanonDrayke Pirates:Flower Angel:Simon Pirates:Gasparde Pirates:Neo Marines:Silver Pirate Alliance (Former: Dissolved)‡:Gran Tesoro:Cidre Guild:Crimson Soldiers:\n\nEmperors:Brokers:\n\nJoker (Former)‡\n\nTamago\n\nPekoms (Unknown status)?\n\nPurchasers:Mercenaries:Intermediate Providers:Mafia:Yakuza:Organ Traders:\n\nJigra (Deceased)†\n\nGum (Non-Canon)≠\n\n150 (Non-Canon)≠\n\nOpera (Non-Canon)≠\n\nWolf (Non-Canon)≠\n\nOther Associates:\n\nSmugglingGoods:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Weapon Based:Fighting Style Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Locations:Associated Groups/Crews:Other:\n\nSouth Blue Inhabitants\n\nSouth Blue CiviliansBaterilla:Black Drum Kingdom:Roshwan Kingdom:Sorbet Kingdom:Other Pirates:Other inhabitants:\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Weapon Based:\n\nRelated ArticlesStory Arcs:Mini-Arcs:\n\nParameciaCanon (Natural):Canon (Artificial):\n\nS-Shark (Sui Sui no Mi)*\n\nS-Bear (Nikyu Nikyu no Mi)*\n\nS-Snake (Mero Mero no Mi)*\n\nS-Hawk (Supa Supa no Mi)*\n\nNon-Canon:\n\nZoanCanon (Natural):\n\nMonkey D.
