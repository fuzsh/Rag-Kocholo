        "text": "Beki Adam emailed with this lovely quote to add to our website :\n\n“Your service was first class. It’s nerve wracking to find Shippers you can trust when one has no experience sending a container of household items abroad. You (Incare) really were so ‘on top of it’ and very helpful with so many explanations to me – and reasonably priced too. Thank you again.”\n\nToday, over five million UK citizens live abroad. More and more people are relocating or moving overseas which is why Incare International offers a low cost, simple service for relocating and shipping Expat goods and possessions.\n\nWhether you need to ship a single suitcase from or to your destination, or the whole house, we can help you ship it from virtually any domestic or international destination. Airlines charge a ridiculous amount of money for excess luggage.\n\nPlease contact us for a quote.\n\nMoving abroad happened a lot quicker than we thought, one minute we were living in London worrying about house prices, the next …. “there’s a job in Vietnam, do you want to go?” It wasn’t long from the initial meeting to “Flight XXX is currently boarding”! Like most couples, we had a lot more stuff than we originally thought and, after finding out that each airline charged a ridiculous amount for excess luggage (at the time it was round £300 for an extra 30kg!!), we decided we needed some help. Incare International came very highly recommended. The first thing we found out that shipping anything to Vietnam is hard, very very hard! There are so many different rules you have to adhere to (which I have now seen first-hand). I suspect if we had done this ourselves, our luggage would still be sat in Customs being charged some astronomical rate for storage.\n\nIncare walked us through everything. They collected our luggage prior to the move, packed it all and stored it at an excellent rate (compared to other companies). We only appreciated how well everything had been packed once it arrived – not only was it tightly packed so it didn’t move in transit, it also meant the Customs arrival team in Ho Chi Minh were very reluctant to rip the whole crate apart (which I saw happen to other arrivals). It obviously isn’t part of the service, but it just goes to show – going over and above on the ‘lead-up’ service, really made a huge difference to the service Incare provided.\n\nThe Incare Team gave us different options on speed and cost and helped us plan what we wanted. They also allowed us to add a few bits (which we had forgotten!!) hassle free.\n\nOne huge differentiator for us was that Incare has a team member located in Vietnam who helped walk us through everything. There are – as always – many ‘extras – that we wouldn’t have considered!\n\nDoor-to-door service that was both easy and reasonable – perfect : a first-class service.\n\nThank you Incare."
