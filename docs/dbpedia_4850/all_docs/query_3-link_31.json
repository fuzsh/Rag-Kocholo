        "text": "Chad Weiberg assumed the role of Oklahoma State Vice President and Athletic Director in July of 2021 after having spent the previous four years as OSU’s Deputy Athletic Director. In this role, Weiberg serves on President Kayse Shrum’s leadership team that helps advance Oklahoma State’s land grant mission and President Shrum’s strategic initiatives for the institution.\n\nThe timing of his promotion to athletic director lined up with seismic shifts in national landscape of college sports. Realignment within the Big 12 Conference and the emergence of Name, Image and Likeness both occurred within a month of Weiberg’s start date.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, in the modernized world of college athletics, Weiberg’s OSU has been a force in competition. A sampling of Oklahoma State’s accomplishments during his three years as athletic director:\n\n* Oklahoma State won team national championships in equestrian (2022) and men’s cross country (2023) and the women’s tennis team won the 2024 ITA indoor national title.\n\n* OSU won 15 Big 12 team conference championships across its 18 varsity sports.\n\n* Oklahoma State finished in the top 25 of the Learfield Directors’ Cup standings each year.\n\n* Oklahoma State won the all-sports Phillips 66 Bedlam Series over in-state rival Oklahoma twice and tied the Bedlam Series once.\n\n* The Cowboy Football team beat No. 5 Notre Dame in the 2021 Fiesta Bowl, had a winning record over Oklahoma and twice appeared in the Big 12 Championship Game.\n\n* Oklahoma State produced 140 All-Americans across all sports for the highest three-year total in school history.\n\nOSU’s broad-based success reflects how the department has evolved in ways that produce a meaningful advantage. Some of key initiatives developed within OSU Athletics under Weiberg:\n\n* The creation of a name, image and likeness department with a dedicated full-time director and assistant director.\n\n* A partnership between OSU Athletics and the Spears School of Business to create the innovative Brand Squad, which pairs the best and brightest students in OSU’s famed Spears School of Business with student-athletes for the purpose of creating a personal brand and managing NIL opportunities, as well as coordinating with supporters establishing new collectives to provide NIL opportunities for OSU student-athletes.\n\n* The creation of the POSSE STAR Fund to provide student-athletes financial rewards for achieving academic success in accordance with the Supreme Court ruling on Alston vs. NCAA.\n\n* The creation of a student-athlete leadership and professional development program with a dedicated full-time director and assistant director to help best position student-athletes for success beyond sports.\n\n* Numerous structural and cosmetic upgrades to Boone Pickens Stadium geared toward improving the fan experience.\n\n* Launching of the OSU Athletics Vision Plan, which is highlighted by a new Human Performance and Innovation Complex and football center, upgrades to Boone Pickens Stadium and entirely new competition facilities for softball and indoor track and field, practice facilities for wrestling and men’s and women’s basketball and upgrades to Karsten Creek Golf Course, the Pedigo-Hull Equestrian Center and to Gallagher-Iba Arena.\n\n* A partnership with Sport and Story to create OSU’s own streaming service, OSU Max.\n\nWeiberg has made three head coach hires, successfully recruiting Jacie Hoyt (women’s basketball), Steve Lutz (men’s basketball) and David Taylor (wrestling) to Stillwater.\n\nOklahoma State hosted NCAA Championship events in men’s and women’s cross country (2022), wrestling (2023) and men’s and women’s tennis (2024) under Weiberg, providing the Cowboys and Cowgirls with added visibility on the national level.\n\nAlso on the national level, Weiberg was on the College Football Playoff Future Format Athletic Directors Focus Group and beginning in September of 2024, joins the NCAA Division I men’s basketball committee for a five-year term.\n\nIn 2023-24, he served as chair of the Big 12 Athletic Directors.\n\nPrior to his elevation to athletic director, Weiberg served as OSU’s Deputy Athletic Director from 2017-21. In that role, Weiberg was the chief operating officer, second-in-command and responsible for the day-to-day operations of the athletics department. He served as Athletic Director Mike Holder’s administrative liaison for football and men’s basketball and was responsible for football scheduling.\n\nDuring his time as Deputy AD, he played a significant role in successfully navigating OSU Athletics through the COVID pandemic. Notably, he developed a partnership with the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences that helped produce the planning and resources to keep Cowboy and Cowgirl student-athletes healthy, safe and ready for competition.\n\nWeiberg was a key figure in several important initiatives that benefited student-athletes and fans alike. A little more than one year after Weiberg’s arrival, OSU added a director of counseling and sport psychology position within the athletic department to better serve the mental health of student-athletes.\n\nHe also played a key part in improving OSU’s gameday experience. Highlights include the addition of one of the largest video boards at a college-only football stadium, the addition of alcohol sales at OSU athletic venues and expanded concession offerings.\n\nWeiberg is a 1994 OSU graduate with a degree in business administration. He earned a master’s in business administration from OSU in 2002. After earning his undergraduate degree, he served as the director of corporate sales and donor relations for OSU Athletics until 1999. He served as senior director of field operations for the OSU Alumni Association from 1999-2002 before becoming the director of development for the OSU Foundation/College of Business Administration from 2002-03. He held a similar role for OSU Athletics from 2003-04 before moving to Kansas State.\n\nAt K-State, Weiberg served the KSU Foundation as Director of Corporate Relations for a year before becoming the Director of Major Gifts for K-State Athletics in 2005. Weiberg assumed the lead role for K-State Athletics’ Ahearn Fund in 2009 and, for his team’s efforts, was recognized as the National Fundraiser of the Year by the National Association of Athletic Development Directors in 2014. Weiberg was the Senior Associate Athletic Director for Development when he left K-State in 2015 to become Deputy Director of Athletics at Texas Tech University, a role in which he served for two years before returning to his alma mater in 2017.\n\nCollege athletics have played a key role in Weiberg’s life from an early age. His father, Mick, and brother, Brett were both college basketball head coaches and his brother, Jared, played basketball at OSU under Eddie Sutton for a year before moving into the role of team manager. Weiberg’s uncle, Kevin, served as commissioner of the Big 12.\n\nWeiberg and his wife, Jodi, have two children, Ella and Grant.\n\nChad Weiberg Career Path 1994-99 Oklahoma State Athletics Director of Corporate Sales and Donor Relations 1999-2002 Oklahoma State Alumni Association Senior Director of Field Operations 2002-03 Oklahoma State Foundation/College of Business Administration Director of Development 2003-04 Oklahoma State Athletics Director of Development 2004-05 Kansas State Foundation Director of Corporate Relations 2005-15 Kansas State Athletics Director of Major Gifts from 2005-09, Associate A.D./Development from 2009-15 2015-17 Texas Tech Athletics Deputy Athletic Director 2017-present Oklahoma State Athletics Deputy Athletic Director from 2017-21, Athletic Director from 2021-present"
