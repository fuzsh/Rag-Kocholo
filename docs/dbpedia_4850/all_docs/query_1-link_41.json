        "text": "Well since I was the one suggesting it I'd better put my vote in for YES, I would definatley buy a copy.\n\nI personally would include the bulk of the content on the 308/328 GTB/S and the 308 GT4 with country specification variations and any specials.\n\nThere are a few notable books already on the 288 and a separate book on 308 GTB rally cars so I don't think that is as critical.\n\nI think to cover the 308/328/GT4 topics in great detail would be enough content for a substantial reference book and one worth buying for any owner (of which there are many worldwide) and any fans of the \"Magnum\" series of Ferrari.\n\nIf you mean by the word “marketable” that such a book would be profitable, I would wager that it would be very unlikely to be profitable. There are many great books by famous photographers or famous drivers that barely sell.\n\nIf you simply mean “interesting”, there is interest in 308 books since it is such a famous and beloved car. There is much of the 308 story which has not been told; famous owners, famous tuners, cultural impact etc. This human side of ownership has never been told.\n\nThe dry documentation of what the car looks like has been told in many places (e.g. Bluemel) as has the story of its genesis (e.g. Fioravanti).\n\nThe car is also missing books that are in-depth technical repair manuals. There are books for other cars out there that set the standard such as the BMW E30 Service Manual by Robert Bentley Publishers. That book is a masterpiece.\n\nSomebody must be making money because there is no shortage of new automotive themed books constantly coming onto market, mostly from European publishers, but also from American houses like Dalton Watson.\n\nFunny timing\n\nI was laying in bed last night watching a show that made me think of this very project. Probably nothing exists that I have more innate passion for than the 308 Ferrari. On my nightstand is that book on Enzo that is as thick as a 70's New York phone book. On a shelf on the other side of the room is my collection of every book on the 308 I have been able to find over the past almost 40 years - not very many and they are all kind small (some literally).\n\nSo I started wondering about a life project where I just start putting down in writing everything about that model like nothing seen before in print and detailed like that foot thick Enzo book. Full color covering everything. The kind of book that we reach for as the Bible to settle an argument over the knobs on the battery cover, that sort of thing. In the back I want every known chassis number and whatever is known about that car. As much as I love the GT4 and the 328's - I would leave them out only for the room to be hyper specialized on the 308.\n\nHow cool would that be?\n\nHi Nathan,\n\nI think I would be a little more hesitant than on your Boxer and 550/575 books in that there are a number already that cover some of the ground you mention. Off the top of my head:\n\nOriginal Ferrari V8 by Keith Bluemel\n\nFerrari V8 by Beki Adam\n\nFerrari The Turbo Eight Cylinders by Alberto Mantovani\n\nFerrari 308, 328 and 348: The Complete Story by Robert Foskett\n\nFerrari 308, 328 and Mondial by Wallace A Wyss\n\nFerrari 308, 328, Mondial by Geoff Willoughby\n\nFerrari Dino, 308 and 328 by Alan Henry\n\nAlso Automobilia did a book on the 328 and there are various volumes of magazine article reprints. There's also a book on the Michelotto 308s but I can't immediately recall the title and don't have it to hand.\n\nI don't know if there would be much interest - at least enough interest to justify the work unless it's totally a labor of love and hang the expense!\n\nI guess I say that based on my own feeling about it...Heck I've been a Ferrari fan since I was 14 but despite being a fan for so long and owning a 328, I don't own a single book or other piece of Ferrari-related merchandise. The only thing I own that says \"Ferrari\" anywhere on it is my 328. I WOULD like to see a good maintenance manual and if that shows up, I would definitely buy that. I read the Bluemel book, owned by a friend, and I was shocked at the errors. It's not worth the paper its printed on as far as a reference book though I realize some people will pay a lot of money for it. I'm still trying to find the hydraulic clutch reservoir he says my car has...\n\nI forgot to add that there are also several books specifically on the 288 that I haven't mentioned above.\n\nI own every one of those books mentioned above in my collection.\n\nKeith's book is filled with errors both in text and in photos (I'm surprised it is consisted as well regarded as it is quite frankly) and by covering so many other V8 models doesn't go into much real detail on the 308/ 328 series to be a definitive guide.\n\nThe Automobila book is such lazy journalism whereby nearly every photo is just taken out of the 328 and Mondial brochures and owners manuals with a road test at the end.\n\nAlberto's book is great but only really deals with the Turbo models which were rare at best in the model range.\n\nOtherwise the other books are thin, small books that give overviews of the models mentioned, mostly have black and white photographs and are hardly a definitive guide like the Dino Compendium or anything like it in terms of options, colours, chassis number changes, technical specs, etc.\n\nI personally think it's a book crying out to be made.\n\nThat's funny, I have that same book on my nightstand as well. Have you read the entire book yet. That will take a while to digest, can you imagine the length of time that it took to write that? Amazing.\n\nI agree with most of what has been said about the need for reference material concerning our cars. It would be great to create a single source of truth. Although, I would miss all of the debates that we constantly have related to what came on the car original, from the dealer, from the factory, what year had 16\" wheels, radios, color combinations, exhaust options, etc.\n\nDon't forget the GTO Evoluzione!"
