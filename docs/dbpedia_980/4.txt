Merry Christmas II You

Mariah Carey released her second Christmas album, Merry Christmas II You, on November 1, 2010. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart after selling 56,000 copies and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 11, 2011. Merry Christmas II You reached the top spot on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it the second Christmas album to ever reach number one.

The album features eight traditional holiday songs, four new original songs, a re-recorded version of Mariah's massive 1994 hit “All I Want For Christmas Is You” and the live version of “O Holy Night” at the Westminister Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles. For the album, Mariah collaborated with producers Randy Jackson, Jermaine Dupri, James Poyser and Marc Shaiman. “This album is a labor of love — a gift to those who share my excitement about the Christmas season and want to fill this special time of year with heartwarming, festive and uplifting music,” Mariah explained. “I was inspired by the traditional tunes of Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby — I really love those albums. I also enjoyed the festive-sounding ones like those by The Jackson 5. As a result, there are different influences in this album. I also wanted it to be like ‘Part 2’ of the Merry Christmas album. I wanted to keep it classic, traditional, festive and happy and have a warm feeling for the holidays so people will love it. In the spirit of classic Christmas records made in the 1950s, we had a huge orchestra session, and I've never experienced anything so beautiful and rich in my musical career as being in the room listening to the lush orchestral moments.”

“Oh Santa!” was released as the album's first single on October 1, 2010. “‘Oh Santa!’ is a new song that I wrote with my friend Jermaine Dupri and also our friend Bryan Michael-Cox, who works with both of us, we sat in a room and I just came in with a basic idea for how I wanted the beat to be and I kinda knew I wanted it to be like writing a letter to Santa Claus,” Mariah said about the song. “It's hard when you've already written a Christmas ‘classic.’ It's weird for me to say it but it's true 'cause a lot of people have grown up with the song and feel really close to ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You.’ But ‘Oh Santa!’ is a different song, it's just got sort of a similar feeling but it's like a retro '60s type of feeling but still modern. We wanted to keep it really simple in terms of the music.” “Oh Santa!” debuted at number one on Billboard's Holiday Digital Songs chart and became Mariah's forty-third Hot 100 entry, peaking at number one-hundred during the week of January 1, 2011. “Oh Santa!” made its debut at number twelve on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Songs chart and reached the top spot the following week, marking the quickest ascent to the peak position in the chart's history.

Another original song on the album is “When Christmas Comes,” written with James Poyser of The Roots. “He's an incredible musician,” Mariah explained. “We got together and I wanted everything in this album to feel classic, to feel festive and timeless. It has a 1970s soul.” A new version of the song featuring singer John Legend was released on November 21, 2011. “The duet that I did with John Legend was so much fun, we had the best time,” Mariah told VEVO in 2011. “To hear his voice and the choices that he made, I feel that he really took it up several notches. I just love what he gave to the song, I feel like he gave so much of himself to the song.”

The album includes a duet with Mariah's mother Patricia on “O Come All Ye Faithful / Hallelujah Chorus.” “Many people already know that my mother is a trained opera singer, so I guess it was only a matter of time before we both got onto a record together,” Mariah explained in 2010. “Doing ‘O Come All Ye Faithful’ and the ‘Hallelujah’ chorus seemed like a perfect vehicle for both of our voices, which are very different in terms of style. It was a lovely experience being in the studio together and I'm very happy that I have this documented for the rest of my life.”

The new version of “All I Want For Christmas Is You” was arranged by March Shaiman. “When I decided to re-do it. I realized that most people love the original. So I asked Marc to do something beautiful for the introduction of the song,” Mariah explained. “We cut the entire track and put it on live instrumentation as opposed to programmed music. It's essentially the same track, but we re-did it from scratch so theres a bit more soul because live music cuts everything from the beginning. Even the piano is more ‘sober’ towards the end. I even brought back some of the girls who sang backup in the original. One of them is Melonie Daniels, who is a fantastic singer. I'm glad I re-did ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ because I think it really enhanced this album.”

Lyrics

Oh Santa!

Oh Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine (Oh Santa!)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas (Oh Santa!)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine

Santa, if you get this letter won't you help me out

I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now

And I don't know how

You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas Eve

But it's amazing

And I bet that you could bring me back my baby

Because every time I see Christmas lights

I feel this void inside and I just can't take it

I saw them shopping last week

And his new girl was so bleak

And then I swore to myself

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

Ho, ho, ho

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Oh Santa, I heard that it's really gonna snow this year

So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer

Get you safely here

So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney

I've been really, really, really good this year

So put on that red suit and make him appear

Because Christmas cheer just ain't the same without my baby

Come on, oh Kris Kringle, send me help

They say it's unrealistic

But I believe in you, Saint Nick

So grant this wish for me right quick

Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night

Ho, ho, ho

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Oh Santa!

Oh Santa!

Oh Santa! (Come on Santa)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine

Oh Santa Claus, if you get this letter please don't make me wait

Cause all December I'll be counting down the days

So hop on your sleigh

I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

The trees are sparkly and gold

But inside I feel so cold

So soon as you leave the North Pole

Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night

Santa's gonna come and make him mine Ho, ho, ho (Oh Santa is gonna come and make him mine)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine Ho, ho, ho

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine (Santa)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine Ho, ho, ho (I know he will)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine Ho, ho, ho (Santa)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas (Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas)

Santa's gonna come and make him mine Ho, ho, ho

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

Santa's gonna come and make him mine Ho, ho, ho

Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine

Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas

O Little Town Of Bethlehem / Little Drummer Boy Medley

O little town of Bethlehem

How still we see thee lie

Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

The silent stars go by

Yet in thy dark streets shineth

The everlasting light

The hopes and fears of all the years

Are met in thee tonight

Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum

Rum, pa, pum, pum

Rum, pa, pum, pum

Then he smiled at me

For Christ is born of Mary

And gathered all above

While mortals sleep

The angels keep

Their watch of wondering love

All morning stars together

Proclaim the Holy birth

And praise and sing

To God the King

And peace to men on Earth

Christmas Time Is In The Air Again

Christmas time is in the air again

Christmas chimes reminding me of when

We fell like the snow so deep in love

High above us the evergreens

Sparkle with lights and feel the breeze

As we made future Christmas memories

Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile

Cause the mistletoe is occupied

And the dream is to share

This Christmas cheer with you all year

And not wait till the morning

When Christmas time is in the air again

Mean Mr. Grinch simply can't resist

Warming up when he looks our way

Even Old Scrooge makes a Christmas wish

For a honey to hold Christmas day

And to feel love like ours always

And the dream is to share

This Christmas cheer

With you all throughout the year

And not wait till the morning

When Christmas time is in the air

Christmas time is everywhere

Christmas time is in the air again

Again and again

The First Noel / Born Is The King Interlude

The First Noel

The angels did say

Was to certain poor shepherds

In fields as they lay

In fields where they lay

Keeping their sheep

On a cold winter's night

That was so deep

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel

They looked up

And saw a star

Shining in the East

Beyond them far

And to the earth

It gave great light

And so it continued

Both day and night

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

Born is the King of Israel

Israel

Born is the King

Born is the King of Israel, Israel

Israel, Israel (Israel)

Born is the

Born is the King, born is the King

Born is the King, born is the King

Born is the King, born is the King

Our finest gifts we bring

To the King of Israel

King of Kings

The First Noel the

Angels did say

Born is the

Born is the King, born is the King

Born is the King, born is the King

Born is the King, born is the King

Of Israel

When Christmas Comes

The whole world

Feels a little bit more love

When Christmas comes

When Christmas comes

And everywhere that you go

There's people singing “Let It Snow”

And hanging up

That mistletoe

And me, and you gonna have ourselves

A holiday

And we don't need nobody else

To celebrate

And we're gon' kiss our worries

And our cares away

I can't wait

Because this Christmas time

Get together

It's gonna be so nice

Better than ever

And baby, you're the one

Special treasure

I can't wait to unwrap your love

Until Christmas comes

So many souls hurt

So many don't have enough

When Christmas comes

When Christmas comes

But baby, if you spread love

Someday it might be enough

To heal each other

One by one

And we gon' get together

And rejoice and pray

And we gon' help the world

Become a better place

And we gon' sing and shout

Because the Savior reigns

So don't dismay

Because this Christmas time

Get together

It's gonna be so nice

Better than ever

Because this gift of love

Lasts forever

The Lord makes our hearts open up

Soon as Christmas comes

It's gon' be alright

When Christmas comes

Oh, jingle all the way

Oh what fun

And we gon' reminisce about

The good old days

And we gon' laugh together

As the children play

And through the years it's always

Gonna be this way

Come what may

Because this Christmas time

Get together

It's gonna be so nice

Better than ever

And baby, you're the one

That I treasure

I can't wait to unwrap your love

Charlie Brown Christmas

Christmas time is here

Happiness and cheer

Fun for all that children call

Their favorite time of year

Olden times and ancient rhymes

Of love and dreams to share

Such spirit through the year

Such spirit through the years

O Holy Night

O holy night the stars are brightly shining

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world in sin and error pining

Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees

O hear the angels' voices

O night divine

O night when Christ was born

O night divine, O night

O night divine

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices

For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees

O hear the angels' voices

O night divine

O night when Christ was born

O night divine

O night divine

O night divine (Ooh yes it was)

O night divine (It is the night of our dear Savior's birth)

O night divine (Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah)

O night divine (It was a holy, holy, holy, oh)

O night divine (Oh… yes it was)

One Child

An angel appeared

Of the highest One

And Mary believed

The word she received of

God's only son

The Virgin rejoiced

Gave thanks to the Lord

And as Joseph dreamt

The angel was sent

With tidings of peace and joy

Of the blessed baby boy

They travelled for miles

To reach Bethlehem

Yet when they arrived

No one could provide

Place at the inn for them

But God kept them safe

From hurt, harm and danger

In His warm embrace

Away in a manger

Waiting for Jesus' birth

To glorify the Earth

Then He came

One child can change the world

Christmas Morn'

The King of all kings was born

He reigns forevermore

Let us worship and adore

Christ the Lord

A wondrous star

Led shepherds and wise men

Through valleys and mountains

Angels surrounded them

As they travelled far

As Heaven and Home

Rang out for the Savior

The Sweet Prince of peace

Lay majestically

Asleep glorious and pure

And His mercy endures for always

One child can change the world

Christmas Morn'

The King of all kings was born

He reigns forevermore

Let us worship and adore

Christ the Lord

One child can change the world

Christmas Morn'

The King of all kings was born

He reigns forevermore

Let us worship him

Let us worship him

Let us worship

Christ the Lord

This angel appeared

The angel appeared

Christ the Lord

On Christmas Morn'

All I Want For Christmas Is You - Extra Festive

I don't want a lot for Christmas

There is just one thing I need

I don't care about presents

Underneath the Christmas tree

I just want you for my own

More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true…

All I want for Christmas

Is you…

I don't want a lot for Christmas

There is just one thing I need

I don't care about presents

Underneath the Christmas tree

I don't need to hang my stocking

There upon the fireplace

Santa Claus won't make me happy

With a toy on Christmas day

I just want you for my own

More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true

All I want for Christmas is you…

You baby

I won't ask for much this Christmas

I won't even wish for snow

I'm just gonna keep on waiting

Underneath the mistletoe

I won't make a list and send it

To the North Pole for Saint Nick

I won't even stay awake to

Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight

Holding on to me so tight

What more can I do

Baby all I want for Christmas is you

You…

All the lights are shining

So brightly everywhere

And the sound of children's

Laughter fills the air

And everyone is singing

I hear those sleigh bells ringing

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need - won't you please bring my baby to me…

Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas

This is all I'm asking for

I just want to see my baby

Standing right outside my door

Oh I just want him for my own

More than you could ever know

Make my wish come true

Baby all I want for Christmas is

You…

All I want for Christmas is you baby
