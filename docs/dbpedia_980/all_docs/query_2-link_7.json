        "text": "The Nutcracker – Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky\n\nThe Nutcracker is something of a Christmas tradition. The festive tale of a toy soldier that comes to life has endured over the years and been subject to some radical retellings. But it’s Tchaikovsky’s music at the centre that makes the beloved ballet that little bit more special.\n\nRead more: The best ballet scores of all time\n\nTroika – Sergei Prokofiev\n\nTaken from his Lieutenant Kijé, Prokofiev’s festive sleigh-ride of a piece is not only a mainstay in Christmas concerts around the world, but on hit radio stations too. English musician, Greg Lake, samples the Russian composer’s melody in his 1975 Christmas song, ‘I Believe in Father Christmas’.\n\nRead more: Greg Lake’s use of Prokofiev’s Troika is one of the best things about Christmas\n\nProkofiev: Troika · Sokhiev / Berliner Philharmoniker\n\nCarol Symphony – Victor Hely-Hutchinson\n\nWritten in 1927, Victor Hely-Hutchinson’s festive shindig of a piece takes the listener on a tour of some of the best-loved Christmas carols including ‘O Come All Ye Faithful’, ‘God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen’ and ‘The First Noël’.\n\nCarol Symphony (complete) - Victor Hely-Hutchinson (1901-1947)\n\nL’Enfance du Christ – Hector Berlioz\n\nBerlioz wrote the oratorio L’Enfance du Christ from 1854. It’s a huge work, which took four years to compose, and depicts not just the childhood of Christ but also Herod’s mass murder of infants in Judea, which led to the fleeing of Mary, Joseph and Jesus. The best-known section, ‘The Shepherds’ Farewell’, is a glorious blend of warm woodwind sounds, sublime choral harmonies and sensitive orchestral accompaniment.\n\nRoyal Choral Society: The Shepherds' Farewell, Hector Berlioz\n\nChristmas Greeting – Edward Elgar\n\nWhile not one of Elgar’s best-known works, this delicate little Christmas song showcases his pastoral roots. Descriptions of the English countryside and calls of ‘Noël!’ make this an underrated festive gem.\n\nEdward Elgar: Christmas Greeting\n\nChristmas Overture – Samuel Coleridge-Taylor\n\nColeridge-Taylor brings together a conglomeration of Christmas melodies and carols in his Christmas Overture. But this work is so much more than just an arrangement of well-known classics for orchestra, as the composer’s cleverly placed integrations show.\n\nIt is thought the piece was composed by Coleridge-Taylor for the children’s play, The Forest of Wild Thyme. The work was published posthumously in 1925, 13 years after the composer’s death, age just 37.\n\nChristmas Overture: Samuel Coleridge-Taylor\n\nChristmas Prelude for Chamber Orchestra – Vítězslava Kaprálová\n\nCzech composer, Vítězslava Kaprálová, wrote the orchestral miniature, Christmas Prelude for Chamber Orchestra, in 1939 for a Christmas program on the Paris PTT Radio. The unusual timbre of the work sets this short orchestral excursion apart from other festive favourites in this list, with the role of the harp beside the chamber orchestra and piano bringing a new colour to the work.\n\nChristmas Prelude for Chamber Orchestra\n\nSong for Snow – Florence Price\n\nWritten in 1930, this beautiful work by Florence Price for chorus and piano opens with the evocative lyric, ‘The earth is lighter than the sky’. The song’s text comes from a poem of the same name by American author, Elizabeth Coatsworth.\n\nPrice’s vocal lines emulate falling snowflakes with an overarching descending melody, and a delicate piano accompaniment. Soft staccato homophony later evokes an icy landscape, before returning to the sweet, laid-back melody.\n\nSong for Snow\n\nSleigh Ride – Leopold Mozart\n\nLeopold Mozart’s Sleigh Ride takes the listener on a quaint though brief trot through a snowy forest on the back of a horse-drawn sleigh. Complete with an almost continuous drone of sleigh bells, ‘Schlittenfahrt’ was written by Leopold shortly before the birth of his son, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Alongside the festive percussion instrument, the score also calls for a rattle, a whip, and triangle among the orchestra.\n\nThe younger Mozart would quote from his father’s festive work in his own ‘3 German Dances’ a few decades later.\n\nLeonard Bernstein - Mozart Schlittenfahrt (Sleigh Ride) 1967\n\nA Ceremony of Carols – Benjamin Britten\n\nThis Christmas choral staple is one of Britten’s best-known works. Scored for three-part treble chorus, solo voices and harp, the piece is based on medieval carols.\n\nThe work was originally scored for and first performed by the women of the Fleet Street Choir, but Britten quickly decided that the sound of boys’ treble voices were better at reflecting the child-like innocence he wanted to achieve through his setting.\n\nBritten's Ceremony of carols : This little babe\n\nSleigh Ride – Leroy Anderson\n\nThe second Sleigh Ride on our list was written two centuries after Leopold Mozart’s work, but contains just as many sleigh bell passages. Leroy Anderson’s Sleigh Ride, written in 1948, is a light orchestral standard, and was famously written during a heatwave in July.\n\nLike the Mozart work, Anderson employs another unusual instrument in his orchestration – this time, the use of woodblocks to create a horse-like ‘clip-clop’. Towards the end of the piece, a trumpeter is also instructed to make the sound of a horse whinnying using the brass instrument.\n\nRead more: The 30 greatest Christmas carols of all time\n\nSleigh Ride (Anderson)\n\nChristmas Concerto – Arcangelo Corelli\n\nThe pastoral strains of Corelli’s Christmas Concerto have been a festive mainstay since the work’s publication in 1714. Published as Concerto grosso in G minor, Op. 6, No. 8, the work was published posthumously and gained its Christmas name due to an inscription on the title page reading, ‘Fatto per la notte di Natale (made for the night of Christmas)’.\n\nCorelli uses folk-like tunes, and sounds evoking bagpipes to conjure images of the biblical shepherds attending the manger at the birth of Jesus.\n\nCorelli: 12 Concerti Grossi, Op. 6, No. 8; Christmas Concerto - Musica Amphion - Classical Music HD\n\nChristmas Oratorio – Johann Sebastian Bach\n\nWritten in 1734, J.S. Bach’s popular Christmas work is one of the choral masterpieces of the Baroque era. The Christmas Oratorio was written in six parts, for performance on one of the major feast days during the period between Christmas Day and Epiphany.\n\nDespite this, Bach clearly envisaged the work being heard as one united whole, and the full oratorio can be heard in churches across the world over the festive season.\n\nBach: Christmas Oratorio I - 1. Jauchzet, frohlocket - Koopman\n\nMessiah – George Frideric Handel\n\nThis English-language oratorio by Handel may have been composed for and first performed during Eastertide, but the choral work is a mainstay in Christmas concerts around the world.\n\nHandel confidently announces the birth of Christ with a radiant section of his Messiah that quotes St Luke’s gospel, ‘For Unto Us A Child Is Born’, and the famed ‘Hallelujah’ Chorus, despite being written to proclaim Christ’s Resurrection, is often associated with the Christmas season.\n\nRead more: Christmas shoppers stunned as choir bursts into Handel ‘Hallelujah’ Chorus in food court\n\n'Silent monks' perform Handel's Hallelujah Chorus in hilarious high school concert\n\nOratorio de Noël – Camille Saint-Saëns\n\nSaint-Saëns wrote this oratorio in just one fortnight, submitting the work just 10 days before its premiere performance in 1858. Scored for soloists, chorus, organ, strings and harp, the composer was highly influenced by music from traditional Christmas church liturgies.\n\nThe cantata-like work is divided into 10 movements; first a prelude, followed by nine vocal pieces.\n\nSaint-Saëns: Weihnachtsoratorium / Christoph Poppen / DRP\n\nChristmas Eve: Orchestral Suite – Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov\n\nThis sweeping orchestral suite was inspired by Rimsky-Korsakov’s four-act opera, Christmas Eve, written between 1894-95. In turn, his Christmas opera is based on an 1832 story by Russian Novelist, Nikolai Gogol, of the same name.\n\nThe magical story takes place in the snowy setting of Dikanka, Ukraine, and characters include the devil, witches, wizards, and spirits of both good and evil nature.\n\nRimsky-Korsakov - Christmas Eve: Orchestral Suite (1895)\n\nStella Natalis – Karl Jenkins\n\nWritten in 2009, Welsh composer Sir Karl Jenkins’ 12-movement work explores the various themes of Christmastide. Stella Natalis, which translates to ‘star of birth’ or ‘star of origin’, draws inspiration from Bible Psalms, but also Zulu texts, and Hindu gods.\n\nJenkins: Stella Natalis - XI. Sing With Joy At Christmas\n\nWinter – Antonio Vivaldi\n\nWhile not strictly a Christmas work, Vivaldi’s fourth season, Winter, is a masterclass in depicting scenery through music. The Italian composer’s writing for violin and orchestra evokes visions of icy surroundings and bitter winds, particularly in the fast and frenzied high-pitched plucking from the strings.\n\nVivaldi's 'Winter' from the Arctic Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra\n\nChristmas Waltz – Tchaikovsky\n\nLike Vivaldi, Tchaikovsky also wrote a work dedicated to the Earth’s seasons. However, unlike Vivaldi’s four, Tchaikovsky wrote twelve movements, one for each of the months of the year. His twelfth movement was his Christmas Waltz, which is often performed on its own.\n\nThis dainty work for solo piano has metamorphosed into various orchestral arrangements since its publication, like the one below, and can be heard in concert halls around the world at Christmas time.\n\nPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky - The Seasons, Op 37a, December Christmas – orchestra Richard Bonyng"
