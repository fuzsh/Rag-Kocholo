        "text": "Everyone know that there are many songs that we consider Christmas songs that have absolutely nothing to do with Christmas. \"Jingle Bells\", \"Winter Wonderland\", \"My Favorite Things\", etc.\n\nSo how many songs are out there that actually mention Christmas in the lyrics, but aren't ever considered Christmas songs. I can think of only one, perhaps two. The one I'm sure of comes from the A&M world - Carpenters \"Those Good Old Dreams\". Lyrics say \"...like a child's eyes, on a Christmas night...\", yet the song was never considered a Christmas tune. The only other possibility I can think of is Joni Mitchell's \"The River\", but that may have gotten some Christmas airplay over the years.\n\nAny others?\n\nIt just so happens I put together a non-Christmas Christmas CD last year so I have a bunch for you.\n\nI Wish I Had A River-Joni Mitchell (Blue)\n\nI Saw My Baby Wearing Santa's Beard-They Might Be Giants\n\nBlood on the Rooftops-Genesis (Wind and Wuthering)\n\nFather Christmas-The Kinks (Misfits Bonus cut)\n\nI Believe In Father Christmas-E.L.P. (Works Vol 2)\n\nI Believe In Everything-John Entwistle (Smash Your Head Against The Wall)\n\nPretty Boy Floyd-Bob Dylan\n\nChristmas In Prison-John Prine\n\nChristmas With The Devil-Spinal Tap (Break Like The Wind)\n\nGlad Tidings-Van Morrison (Moondance)\n\nSolstice Bells, Christmas Song and Another Christmas Song-Jethro Tull\n\nBy the way, there is a whole album of Christmas music just released by Jethro Tull featuring classic songs plus re-recordings of his older Christmas-related tunes.\n\nDan\n\nSade - - Promise - \"The Sweetest Taboo\"\n\n\"...You've got the biggest heart\n\nSometimes I think you're just too good for me\n\nEvery day is Christmas, and every night is New Year's Eve\"\n\nSparks - Kimono My House - \"Thank God It's Not Christmas\"\n\n\"Thank God it's not Christmas\n\nWhen there is only you\n\nAnd nothing else to do\n\nThank God it's not Christmas\n\nWhere there' just you to do\n\nThe rest is closed to public view\"\n\nAttached Files:\n\nsparks.jpg\n\nFile size:\n\n56 KB\n\nViews:\n\n97\n\nColin,\n\nNone of the songs I suggested are traditional Christmas songs. Even if they have the word Christmas in the title, they aren't the usual Christmas fare. Blood on the Rooftops, for instance, only mentions Christmas once in passing.\n\nAnd The Kinks Father Christmas is about a store Santa being mugged by a bunch of kids.\n\nI thought that was what the poster was looking for.\n\nDan\n\nChristmas In Prison actually was put on a Christmas CD by John Prine. .\n\nHow about Fairy Tale of New York by The Pogues:\n\nHappy Christmas your ****\n\nI pray God\n\nIt's our last\n\nor Another Lonely Xmas by Prince - probably the most depressing Christmas song ever"
