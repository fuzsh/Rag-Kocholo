        "text": "Christmas Round The Fireside\n\nReaders Digest RDA248\n\nAccording to the nativity story, on the first Christmas morn, when the infant Jesus lay in His manger, the heavens resounded with the singing of angels. Since that time 2000 years ago, the songs the angels sang have been echoed by men on earth. The beautiful hymns and carols inspired by the Nativity have come from all over the world — from people of all eras, all languages and all traditions. In the Christmas Sing-Along are some of the loveliest Christmas songs ever written — the old as well as the new, the sacred as well as the secular. “Peace and joy” is the message of the Christmas season, and of mankind’s many arts, music expresses that message best.\n\nIn “Christmas Round The Fireside”, Readers Digest presented a collection of holiday music we all grew up singing. In the 6-Record set album jacket they included a booklet will all the song lyrics. We share that song listing together with lyrics here.\n\nSilent Night\n\nMusic by Franz Gruber; Lyrics by Joseph Mohr\n\nSilent night, holy night,\n\nAll is calm, all is bright.\n\nRound yon Virgin Mother and Child,\n\nHoly infant so tender and mile,\n\nSleep in heavenly peace,\n\nSleep in heavenly peace!\n\nSilent night, holy night\n\nShepherds quake at the sight.\n\nHeav’nly hosts sing Alleluia;\n\nChrist, The Savior, is born,\n\nChrist, The Savior, is born!\n\nSilent night, holy night,\n\nSon of God, love’s pure light.\n\nRadiant beams from Thy holy face,\n\nWith the dawn of redeeming grace,\n\nJesus, Lord, at Thy birth,\n\nJesus, Lord, at Thy birth.\n\nThe First Noel\n\nTraditional\n\nThe first Noel, the angel did say,\n\nWas to certain poor shepherds in fields as they lay;\n\nIn fields where they lay keeping their sheep,\n\nOn a cold winter’s night that was so deep.\n\nChorus:\n\nNoel, Noel, Noel, Noel,\n\nBorn is the King of Israel.\n\nThey looked up and saw a star\n\nShining in the East, beyond them far;\n\nAnd to the earth it gave great light,\n\nAnd so it continued both day and night.\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\nThis star drew nigh to the northwest;\n\nO’er Bethlehem it took its rest,\n\nAnd there it did both stop and stay,\n\nRight over the place where Jesus lay.\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\nO Little Town of Bethlehem\n\nMusic by Lewis H.

I’ll be back again some day.”\n\nA Marshmallow World\n\nMusic by Peter De Rose, Lyric by Carl Sigman\n\nIt’s a marshmallow world in the winter\n\nWhen the snow comes to cover the ground.\n\nIt’s the time for play; it’s a whipped cream day;\n\nI wait for it the whole year round.\n\nThose are marshmallow clouds being friendly\n\nIn the arms of the evergreen trees,\n\nAnd the sun is red like a pumpkin head;\n\nIt’s shining so your nose won’t freeze.\n\nThe world is your snowball; see how it grows;\n\nThat’s how it goes whenever it snows.\n\nThe world is your snowball just for a song;\n\nGet out and roll it along.\n\nIt’s a yum-yummy world made for sweethearts;\n\nTake a walk with your favorite girl.\n\nIt’s a sugar date; what if spring is late;\n\nIn winter it’s a marshmallow world.\n\nJingle Bell Rock\n\nWords and Lyric by Joe Beal and Jim Boothe\n\nJingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock,\n\nJingle bells swing and jingle bells ring.\n\nSnowing and blowing are bushels of fun,\n\nNow the jingle hop has begun.\n\nJingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock,\n\nJingle bells chime in jingle bell time.\n\nDancin’ and prancin’ in jingle bell square\n\nIn the frosty air.\n\nWhat a bright time; it’s the right time\n\nTo rock the night away;\n\nJingle bell time is a swell time\n\nTo go riding in a one-horse sleigh.\n\nHey giddy-yap jingle horse; pick up your feet’\n\nJingle around the clock.\n\nMix and mingle in a jingling beat.\n\nThat’s the jingle bell rock.\n\nSleigh Ride\n\nMusic by Leroy Anderson\n\nLyric by Mitchell Parish\n\nChorus:\n\nJust hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling too;\n\nCome on, it’s lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.\n\nOutside the snow is falling and friends are calling “Yoo-hoo,”\n\nCome on it’s lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.\n\nGiddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let’s go;\n\nLet’s look at the show;\n\nWe’re riding in a wonderland of snow.\n\nGiddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, it’s grand,\n\nJust holding your hand;\n\nWe’re gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland.\n\nOur cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we;\n\nWe’re snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be.\n\nLet’s take that road before us and sing a chorus or two;\n\nCom on, it’s lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you.\n\nThere’s a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray.\n\nIt’ll be the perfect ending of a perfect day.\n\nWe’ll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop.\n\nAt the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop.\n\nThere’s a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy,\n\nWhen they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie.\n\nIt’ll merely be like a picture print by Currier and Ives;\n\nThese wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives.\n\nRepeat chorus.\n\nJoy to the World\n\nMusic by Lowell Mason\n\nLyric by Isaac Watts\n\nJoy to the world! the Lord has come: let earth receive her King.\n\nLet ev’ry heart prepare Him room, and heav’n and nature sing,\n\nAnd heav’n and nature sing, and heav’n and heav’n and nature sing.\n\nJoy to the world! the Savior reigns: let men their songs employ;\n\nWhile fields and floods, rocks, hills, and plains\n\nRepeat the sounding joy, repeat the sounding joy,\n\nRepeat, repeat the sounding joy.\n\nHe rules the world with truth and grace, and makes the nations prove\n\nThe glories of His righteousness and wonders of His love\n\nAnd wonders of His love, and wonders wonders of His love.\n\nWhat Child Is This? (Greensleeves)\n\nLyric by William C. Dix\n\nWhat Child is this, who, laid to rest,\n\nOn Mary’s lap is sleeping?\n\nWhom angels greet with anthems sweet,\n\nWhile shepherds watch are keeping?\n\nChorus:\n\nThis, this is Christ the King,\n\nWhom shepherds guard and angels sing.\n\nhaste, haste to bring Him luad,\n\nThe Babe, the Son of Mary.\n\nWhy lies He in such mean estate,\n\nWhere ox and ass are feeding?\n\nGood Christian, fear for sinners here\n\nThe silent Word is pleading.\n\nRepeat Chorus\n\nSo bring Him incense, gold and myrrh;\n\nCome, rich and poor, to own Him.\n\nThe King of Kings salvation brings;\n\nLet loving hearts enthrone Him.\n\nRepeat Chorus.\n\nO Holy Night\n\nMusic by Adolph-Charles Adam\n\nLyric by John Sullivan Dwight\n\nO holy night, the stars are brightly shining;\n\nIt is the night of the dear Savior’s brith.\n\nLong lay the world in sin and error pining,\n\nTill He appeared and the soul felt its worth.\n\nA thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,\n\nFor yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.\n\nFall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices!\n\nO night divine, O night when Christ was born!\n\nO night divine!
