        "text": "TITLE: Their 37th album is also their fourth Xmas album, so this title is a little bit exhausting, and I honestly don’t know what stopped them from putting a IV at the end of it.\n\nCOVER ART: Baked in the cake, it had to look like this because all Chicago albums have to look like this.\n\nLISTENING: Horns! I cannot keep the history of this band straight in my head, beyond that there is the “25 or 6 to 4” era and then the Peter Cetera era and then somehow it is now 2019 and Chicago is still a band, which feels like a minor XMAS miracle to me.\n\nVERDICT: I don’t have time to go back and check out the previous three Chicago Xmas albums, so I’ll confess I feel unqualified to judge this one properly. But they get major points for writing a bunch of new originals, and for cleverly transforming the Bacharach/David classic “What The World Needs Now” into a holiday song merely by including it.\n\nTITLE: I assume there was a Big Band Christmas I prior to this, but I am not gonna look it up because I like the title more if I pretend the first one never happened.\n\nCOVER ART: Classy cut-out art. It looks like the kind of holiday greeting card that I would refuse to buy in a fancy greeting card store because it costs as much as what, in my mind, a paperback book should cost. Did I mention that one of the morbid delights of Xmas is that each one makes you feel older and sadder?\n\nLISTENING: Why do I like this one as much as I do? I thought it was gonna be boring but it won me over immediately.\n\nVERDICT: These folks know what they’re doing and they somehow make “traditional” feel fresh & exciting. I changed my mind, I will look up Big Band Christmas I.\n\nTITLE: I am 100% fine with this title, especially with the dropping of the “g” in “grooving.” Although if they had kept it, it would have seemed so weird that I would’ve been fine with that, too.\n\nCOVER ART: Two dudes, looking right at the camera while they are clearly going somewhere. One guy has drumsticks. The other guy has a tree, I think? The image is dark and hard to see. Are these guys mad at me? They are both wearing blue hats. Two fonts. I’m not wild about this cover art.\n\nLISTENING: I thought this was going to be terrible, but I liked it. It is less “drum-y” than I was expecting! A lot of it sounds like tuned percussion. This is one of the biggest surprises of the year, this record. I would have skipped right over it and I’m glad I didn’t. It is the kind of ambient, mood-setting, holiday record that you can put on and it will make the holidays feel more relaxed. It’s also just a little bit melancholy.\n\nVERDICT: I really like this record a lot, and you know what? I think babies would like it, too. Play this for your baby, if you have a baby. I could be wrong about this, but I think they will like it. Apologies if I am wrong about this, and your baby hates it. (I am talking to parents who have actual newborn babies, not “baby” like “Baby, It’s Cold Outside.”)\n\nTITLE: Still a good title. This is just a re-issue of last year’s very good album with four new tracks, a customary practice that is both fun (yay more tracks!) and a rip-off (if you bought the album last year). But in the streaming era I guess it is less of a rip-off, maybe? I feel like with every new decade of recorded music, it becomes less clear who is stealing from whom.\n\nCOVER ART: It is the same art as last year, except I think they added a red ribbon?\n\nLISTENING: Four new songs. Two of them — I would argue — are controversial! I have never been able to completely accept “My Favorite Things” as a Xmas song. It is a Sound of Music song, and as far as I can tell, all it took for it to sneak into the holiday canon was Julie Andrews singing it on a 1961 TV Xmas special. But the biggest news is the updated version of “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” where Legend & Kelly Clarkson sing new lyrics designed to make it less creepy and more fun for 2019 listeners who believe in consent. (No doubt this will anger the small segment of the population that gets mad at every attempt at progress, despite the fact that there are still more than enough versions of the problematic original readily available for their listening pleasure.)\n\nVERDICT: I liked this album a lot last year, and now it is 4 songs longer! I’m glad I didn’t buy it on vinyl already, because when I inevitably do, I want these extra songs.\n\nTITLE: This title is either the least punk rock I can imagine or it is so not punk rock that it has circled back around to being punk again, I cannot tell.\n\nCOVER ART: A skeleton with a garbage bag and a striped aluminum can. I am not sure what this is meant to be rebelling against. Recycling?\n\nLISTENING: At this point, I have a much higher tolerance for anything that is pushing back against the traditional Xmas-sounding arrangements, so it takes me longer to figure out if I actually like some of these or if it is just the shock/thrill of the new.\n\nVERDICT: I like more of these than I dislike. Sneak “Christmas Sucks (You Stupid Fucks)” into your family’s holiday playlist to disrupt things.\n\nTITLE: After a while, I begin to regret that I decided to judge all these albums’ titles. I have no strong opinion about this title except that it is a long title in two parts and it is very business-like. It feels like the name of a PBS holiday special.\n\nCOVER ART: I am not sure what I am looking at. I think it might be those paper bags that people put candles in? Do you know what I’m talking about? Anyway, it might be those, or it might not be.\n\nLISTENING: Choral Xmas music, songs like “Lo, How a Rose E’er Blooming” and “Go Tell It on the Mountain” and yet another version of “Silent Night.” I haven’t mentioned it yet, but it feels like too many of these albums include a version of “Silent Night,” which is a lovely song but I honestly don’t think it’s so lovely that everybody needs to keep recording it constantly. Like, if we stopped now, we have enough versions to last us the rest of our lives, easily. We are stocked up, fully.\n\nVERDICT: This is an album I am fine with in the background but I doubt I would ever actively choose to play it when there are so many other records to get to. They sound good, but this is not my favorite sound of the holidays.\n\nTITLE: Are you kidding me? A pun? And it’s personalized, so it wouldn’t work as the title of anyone else’s Xmas record? Well done, Don Amero. This is the best title so far, and it’s not even close. If I found out he only made this album so he could use this title, I would say it was well worth it, no matter what it sounds like.\n\nCOVER ART: Black-and-white photo of Amero, smiling and touching his guitar. Some Xmas art details around the title and a weird gradient wave of red appearing from the bottom of the frame. I have to say that when it comes to Xmas colors, you really need green and red to be in something close to equal proportions or else it just looks weird. You know when people just do all red Xmas lights on their house and it looks sort of evil? This looks like the red fires of hell are eating his guitar and he is loving it — all because they didn’t blend in more green. I will not be talked out of this opinion.\n\nLISTENING: Bold choice to follow “Please Come Home” with “Merry Christmas (Baby Please Come Home).” I only wish there was a third song called “I Am Asking You For the Last Time to Please Come Home For Xmas” where the begging becomes frantic.\n\nVERDICT: Another entry where more than half of the record is unfamiliar (or less familiar titles), so overall this year’s crop is surprising me in this respect. Overall, this album’s sound doesn’t ring my bell — Contemporary Country is always a tough sell for me, even from a Canadian artist — but I’m not really the target demo for this one, so don’t take it as a slight.\n\nTITLE: Rejoice could be a generic Christian album title. But at least you know what you’re getting. Cards on the table and all that.\n\nCOVER ART: Red-and-white graphics, it is snowing. Calee is smiling and either blowing kisses or snowflakes or both directly at the camera. She seems like she is in a good mood.\n\nLISTENING: As I have stated several times already, I am in this for the Secular Xmas fun and sadness, so the Religious Christmas songs have to work a little harder to hook me. A song like “Heaven’s Here” almost hooks me when it starts to get jolly and festive but then it loses me again. “Breath Of Heaven” likewise faces an uphill climb getting me on board.\n\nVERDICT: Another one which just fails to connect with me. Which is fine! I don’t need to like all of these. It would be insane if I liked all of these records. You cannot expect that of me. I am a human being, and I cannot like everything. I am trying to be positive. We are not even halfway done, and I am really feeling it.\n\nTITLE: They are the 5 Browns because their last name is Brown and, if you listen to their Christmas record, that’s how you spend Christmas with them.\n\nCOVER ART: The 5 Browns are all smiling. Three are seated at a table, one is standing and one is sitting on the floor with her back to the rest of them. The woman on the far left obviously just said something funny and is making a gesture with her hands as if to say, “right?”\n\nLISTENING: They are a classical piano ensemble made up of two brothers and three sisters and they are playing classical music like The Nutcracker Suite.\n\nVERDICT: I mean, unless you hate this kind of thing, this is the easiest record in the world to say yes to. They know what they are doing, and it all sounds nice and great.\n\nTITLE: Not to be confused with Joseph Fuller’s Christmas in the City! We narrowed Fuller’s titular city down to Houston, and Michelle’s third track is “Christmas In New York,” but that is the extent of this album’s focus on urban concerns. I would really like it if the next person to name their album Christmas in the City actually does a full-on concept album about what it is like to spend Xmas in a big city. Be specific! Public transportation is usually on a limited schedule on major holidays, for instance, and that is worthy of at least a song or two.\n\nCOVER ART: Lea sits on the stairs in a big red dress. She is smiling, and the dress is spread out everywhere so no one else can use the stairs, but in fairness, we have no idea what building she is in or if there is anybody else there waiting to use the stairs. Maybe this is her house! Anyway, it’s a nice dress and the stairs look clean.\n\nLISTENING: For the most part, this is just too many of the same songs done in perfectly acceptable professional-sounding arrangements.\n\nVERDICT: I know that people really want to record all of these songs, because they keep recording them, every year. And part of me would miss it if people stopped doing it, but it is kind of crazy that you can count on a whole bunch of people to just keep recording them and recording them and recording them. At some point, these records become like the pages of Jack Torrence’s book as discovered by Shelley Duvall, the same songs over and over and over and over again.\n\nTITLE: Bingo! They are contractors who sing and they put the word building in their title and they tied it in with Xmas. This is how you do it.\n\nCOVER ART: Three fonts on the cover, a white background, and two men leaning in very hard to their brand as singing contractors.\n\nLISTENING: Why just do normal versions of the same old songs? Their version of “The Chipmunk Song” has some “contractor” specifics but for the most part these are just the same old songs being performed the same way.\n\nVERDICT: I really thought they would take advantage of their gimmick more. Most of these songs have already been covered by some of the greatest singers of all time, so these versions don’t really add much unless you just really want to hear these specific guys (who happen to be contractors) singing them. I would have liked them to do a version of “Deck the Halls” about work they were doing to the halls, or to a deck.\n\nTITLE: Title track! But it feels right. I realize I’m giving a lot of waivers this year when the title tracks feel perfectly suited to the records at hand. See, I’m not asking for earth-shattering originality, just for artists to try and pick a title that hasn’t been used a dozen times before, and one that ideally feels like it is specific to the album they made. If the Beatles made a Xmas album and called it “A Fab Christmas” it would pass both tests, and I feel like this title is basically the equivalent of that for the Oak Ridge Boys.\n\nCOVER ART: The four Oak Ridge Boys (although one of them resembles Santa Claus in sunglasses) stand on the other side of a piano decorated with Xmas garland. Do they want us to play the piano for them? One of them is making a gesture as if to say, “Who is going to play the piano? Anyone?”\n\nLISTENING: I feel like I heard about the Oak Ridge Boys all the time as a kid growing up in Missouri, but have had little awareness of their whereabouts or activities since, say, 1987. That’s on me, not them. Everything is targeted and niche-ified now, and we all live in our own bubbles.\n\nVERDICT: I have to say that this very much sounds like an album recorded not by boys but by older men, and I find that charming. When they all sing at once, it almost feels like they are shouting the songs at you. Even their version of “Silent Night” feels gruff.\n\nTITLE: I don’t like that everybody keeps casually saying the title of Dylan Scott’s album to each other and they don’t even know it.\n\nCOVER ART: I have grown skeptical of Xmas album covers where the person just dresses up nice and smiles for the camera like a prom photo. I need it to feel more Xmas-y than this.\n\nLISTENING: All the same songs, slightly country-fied. It’s mostly down to the timbre and inflection of Scott’s voice — if you are a fan already and you like his voice and wanna hear him sing these songs, then you will probably like this. But it doesn’t try to do much to distinguish itself.\n\nVERDICT: I don’t need this! It’s all the same songs! I feel like I’ve heard this record before, and in a year with dozens of new records, something like this struggles to make a strong impression, my mind just absorbs it and erases from my mind moments later.\n\nTITLE: All it takes is one unexpected descriptor to take a run-of-the-mill title and transform it. In this case, it’s the word “progressive” that makes all the difference.\n\nCOVER ART: An illustration of a pickup truck with a tree in it. It’s snowing. This also looks like a public radio giveaway.\n\nLISTENING: Is it reductive to say that this is a holiday album for anyone who owns the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack and still listens to it at least once a year?\n\nVERDICT: A very unassuming album. It is starting to feel like I am damning with faint praise each time I say that another one of these albums is “nice.” Almost all of them are “nice.” Xmas is a “nice” holiday! “Peace On Earth, Goodwill Toward Men” is just a fancy way of saying “everybody be nice.” Anyway, their version of Vince Guaraldi’s “Skating” is an instant “must-add” for this year’s playlist.\n\nTITLE: This title takes two kinda generic-sounding titles and combines them! Like Deck The Halls: A Classic Christmas or Away In A Manger: A True Christmas. As always, I get to a point where I start to feel like I’m the crazy one for expecting people to put effort into thinking up interesting titles for their Xmas records.\n\nCOVER ART: It’s snowy, sort of, and Danny looks like he is lost in thought, or maybe he has fallen asleep standing up? It’s a thoughtful pose.\n\nLISTENING: Gokey closes with a perfectly nice version of “Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas,” reminding me that this song is nearly impossible to screw up and yet the bar is astonishingly high for recording a new version that feels essential.\n\nVERDICT: I really am trying my best to give each of these albums a chance, and it’s actually a relief every time I encounter ones that clearly just weren’t made for me. I can move on quickly, no hard feelings.\n\nTITLE: Shakespeare! No one else has used a Shakespeare title, so this feels novel. Or maybe I’m just lowering my standards.\n\nCOVER ART: Snowy! Icy! There is an archway! Two fonts used. It’s fine, but very basic. I can’t imagine anyone getting that excited when this is their cover art.\n\nLISTENING: There are sub-genres of Xmas music that you know immediately whether or not you are on board for them, and “Celtic Christmas” is an easy one. You know, right? You know whether or not this is what you want before you hear a single note. The odds that you will be surprised are slim.\n\nVERDICT: I would buy this for my mom, but I’m not sure she needs another Celtic Christmas album.\n\nTITLE: OK! Wintertime Dreams: A Parisian Christmas is exactly what I’m talking about. Somebody cared about what they were gonna call this album. That is not a title that was arrived at casually.\n\nCOVER ART: This looks like it should be something you get during a public radio pledge drive in early December.\n\nLISTENING: This sounds like it should be something you get during a public radio pledge drive in early December!\n\nVERDICT: Old fashioned frisky fun, and if you listen to public radio you probably will like this. They sing “Jingle Bells” in French!\n\nTITLE: Did 92 Keys name their album after Phil Wickham’s album? I just looked it up and found out that there are over 50 different Christmas albums that are just called “Christmas,” which makes me angry but also makes me want to make a list where I listen to all of them and see which one is the best and only that one gets to be called “Christmas,” and then I force all the others to come up with new titles. I am willing to do this as a reality show, if anyone wants to fund it.\n\nCOVER ART: It’s a painting of a man and a woman, outside. He plays the piano and she plays the violin. It is snowing. Neither of them is dressed for it.\n\nLISTENING: Xmas albums where they drop the lyrics have a real advantage. It is easier to sound elegant or fun without seeming overdramatic or silly. It also doesn’t take much to sound fairly innovative.\n\nVERDICT: I like this. It sounds like the score to a holiday movie where very important things are happening in December.\n\nTITLE: Almost every Xmas album could be called this and it would make sense. This is the slightly duller version of calling your album “Christmas Party.”\n\nCOVER ART: He is wearing a suit but the suit is red and overall the design looks like wrapping paper.\n\nLISTENING: This is at least Jim Brickman’s seventh Xmas record. When someone makes that many Xmas records, it either means they are sincerely into it or they have latched onto a good racket. I choose to not be cynical and I always assume the former. Brickman seems into it. A lot of this album is solo piano and quiet ballads, but there are a couple of boisterous party songs that feel like they belong on an entirely different record.\n\nVERDICT: I am starting to realize that listening to this many Xmas records, I am only going to welcome a small handful of them into my regular listening rotation. I have to move on to the next one. If this were one of five albums, I would probably spend more time picking out my favorites and appreciating what is good about it, but if I do that, it will be New Year’s Eve by the time I get done with this.\n\nTITLE: The easiest workaround for anyone wanting to get past my admittedly stupid obsession with the originality/specificity of Xmas album titles is to just put your name in the title or make your name the title.\n\nCOVER ART: Dionne posing with her arms folded, but she is smiling. Some clip art snow flakes. No one spent a ton of time pondering this. Truly, there is a strain of cover art for these records that is the equivalent of picture day in grade school, like everybody who had a Xmas record lines up to get their pic taken in front of a plain color and somebody will toss a few snowflakes onto it to make it feel like Xmas.\n\nLISTENING: Some nice arrangements! But mostly just the same songs, sung this time by Dionne Warwick & some guests.\n\nVERDICT: There is a kind of Xmas album that a lot of people make and it is this album. If you like that album, here it is again! With Dionne Warwick! And friends!\n\nTITLE: All the lights is a lot of lights. I don’t know what this title means and it only seems like a Xmas title if you already know it’s a Xmas title but it’s not the worst. Also, dammit: it’s a title track!\n\nCOVER ART: It looks like a template that you could use for a holiday card, if you go to the trouble of making your own holiday cards. Photo of Donna making an expression that I interpret as “skeptical that these are really all of the lights.”\n\nLISTENING: When I get to the title track, I learn that “all the lights” is a reference to the light of Jesus’ birth being brighter than all the other lights. I wish that the song “Anything Is Possible” was a holiday song from an agnostic POV, but this is very much a Religious Christmas record.\n\nVERDICT: Not for me, sorry. This record is not for me. It’s the weirdest thing: I like babies, and I like mercy, and I like Xmas, and yet the whole Baby Jesus story has never really connected with me. I get creeped out by the hero worship and the King Herod aftermath. Side note, not unrelated: Baby Yoda is the best, right? And he uses his magic powers to help people even when it’s exhausting!\n\nTITLE: That’s right, they are going to Christmasplain the holidays to you, dear listener. The Erwins are here to tell you what Xmas actually means, as they are gonna go full Linus Van Pelt “Lights Please” on you. (Oh, and it’s a title track.)\n\nCOVER ART: The Erwins are sitting on some stairs. Just out of frame, I imagine that there are people who want to go up or down those stairs, but they cannot! The Erwins are blocking the way!\n\nLISTENING: There is a kind of holiday record that just checks all the wrong boxes for me. It is too big, trying to sound modern without feeling current, musical theater-y in the way that a theme park or a megachurch performance might be. Emotional without feeling vulnerable, enthusiastic without feeling joyful. I mean, the Erwins would likely hate my Xmas album. We are just on two different sides of the spectrum in terms of what we like.\n\nVERDICT: I can’t. Religious Christmas is just not my holiday, y’know? And when a record isn’t a match, it isn’t a match.\n\nTITLE: I’m probably being paranoid and reading too much into the title, but are there family Christmases that are being accused of being somehow fraudulent? This feels passive aggressive.\n\nCOVER ART: A family portrait, indoors but featuring some outdoor clothing. Is it cold in there, or did some of them just arrive? Maybe they are on their way out the door. True families often have busy schedules and maybe it was hard to get everyone there at the same time.\n\nLISTENING: They open with a song from The Polar Express, which I still am too frightened to watch. (I have seen stills from it.) I am nuts for Christmas and, yet, the Collingsworths might be a little too much for me. They come out of the gate hard with big time orchestration and an “Up With People” vibe that is honestly just too much for me to take. “We Do Christmas Like We Mean It” is a perfect example of a song that is 100% not for me despite my admiration for the sentiment being expressed. Still: there is a nice plinky-plonky piano version of “Sleigh Ride” that I really did enjoy.\n\nVERDICT: Your mileage may vary with all of this stuff. I am a devout agnostic with a preference for Secular Xmas, and I am trying to be up front about my bias and my personal agenda. For some people, this record will be exactly what you want from a Christmas record. It’s just that a lot of it did not connect with me. And my filthy mind can’t absorb a title like “Isn’t That Why He Came” without feeling like a dirtbag.\n\nTITLE: All I am asking for is that people try and give their Xmas records titles that are specific to their album. I think that’s what I am looking for. How’s about this: If your title could also be the title of literally anyone else’s Xmas album, then you might want to set aside a few minutes to make a list of five other options just to see if something more interesting pops up.\n\nCOVER ART: It’s a painting of some big weird colorful structures, possibly buildings. Some small figure is dragging a Xmas tree along the ground, and there is a star in the sky. Whatever this painting is, it is not giving up all of its secrets. It reminds me of that painting in Goodfellas with the guy in the boat with the dog that Joe Pesci explains out loud.\n\nLISTENING: It sounds like there is a mandolin or maybe a banjo at work here? And vocal harmonies. I am unfamiliar with this band, and none of their song choices veer beyond the usual suspects — this is 10 songs without a single surprise in the bunch… and yet, I do not mind this at all. Something about these very simple and direct musical arrangements is making me listen.\n\nVERDICT: It’s not earth-shattering, but I am not bored by it, either, and that’s saying something, considering that these are the same songs you can find on dozens upon dozens of other holiday albums.\n\nTITLE: Not a title track, but the kind of title that has been used before for other people’s jazzy Xmas records. The concept of jazzing up Xmas is not a new one.\n\nCOVER ART: Nice photo, vivid red, good fonts: Four guys singing around a single microphone. Gets the job done.\n\nLISTENING: This more often feels like “show choir” than “jazzy” to me. It veers from doo-wop to Broadway to Easy Listening and it’s all perfectly pleasant.\n\nVERDICT: Records like this make me feel like a grumpy grinch, just because I have a low threshold for Xmas music this sweet and saccharine. Even their perfectly lovely rendition of Guaraldi’s “Christmastime Is Here” makes me feel like I’m going to lose a toe to diabetes.\n\nTITLE: I would be stunned to learn that this group had even a single conversation about what to call this album. No one cared. It is literally just the first track, so that is what the album is called.\n\nCOVER ART: Just now, I made my own cover art for this album using my phone by grabbing the first pic on their Facebook page and a meme generator app. It took less than 60 seconds and is basically as good as what they did. I guarantee someone in this band has a niece or nephew who would have designed them a nicer-looking album cover. This stuff is just not a priority for them, clearly! They did not care what this record was called or what it looked like.\n\nLISTENING: Plot twist — I love it. Full disclosure, this is an album of Dixieland jazz Xmas music, so every track sounds like it should be on the soundtrack to a Woody Allen movie. You may hate this record. I like it. I think these folks are great, and their record sounds swell. It should be acknowledged that there is a non-zero chance that the majority of the records on this list will likely feature the same 12 songs, over and over and over. All it takes is a handful of unexpected titles to feel revolutionary, and NOJBOC eventually starts to mix it up a bit.\n\nVERDICT: They need a graphic designer and maybe their most clever friend to sort them out with a good title and a cool cover. My first thought is that they could have called it Santa Claus Is Coming to Cologne. I’m not saying that’s a great title, but I put literally three seconds’ of effort into it. Imagine what a room full of people brainstorming for 20 minutes could’ve come up with!\n\nTITLE: They were boxed in, they had to call it this or it wouldn’t make sense as part of the series. But I do wish I had some context, like what songs did they hear prior to this that they would not call “Country Christmas”? I like imagining that every title in this series was preceded by a disappointing compilation that somehow failed to get it right. And I never understand why the word NOW is the one they emphasize.\n\nCOVER ART: Same. These decisions were mostly out of their hands. It’s a template, they have to follow it. I do always look at these and think it would be difficult to make them less appealing to my eye.\n\nLISTENING: I was dreading this one since contemporary country music isn’t my jam. My main associations with Toby Keith are him singing about America putting “a boot in your ass” and shitting all over the Dixie Chicks for thinking the Iraq War was a terrible idea, so I really don’t need his version of “Frosty the Snowman.” But, to be honest, most of these tracks are pretty standard fare with a pleasant country twist.\n\nVERDICT: I did not mind this at all, overall. It’s a mixed bag like most compilations, and I admittedly went into it with a terrible attitude (but not as terrible as Toby Keith’s attitude toward the Dixie Chicks circa the early years of Gulf War II).\n\nTITLE: I am baffled by anyone who wants to call their Christmas album “Christmas.” Now whenever people talk about “Christmas” we won’t know if they are referring to the holiday or to Phil Wickham’s album.\n\nCOVER ART: So simple you could literally make it with one of those stamps where you cut a potato in half. I say this as a compliment.\n\nLISTENING: Given the simplicity of the title and cover art, this is much more multi-tracked than I would’ve expected. Wickham has an interesting singing voice, and I found myself wanting to linger on these songs rather than moving on quickly to the next record, which is really saying something when I have so many other albums to get through.\n\nVERDICT: Full disclosure: My own personal preference leans more toward secular Xmas than religious Christmas, but I don’t mind a little overlap. I am not familiar with Wickham, but I think this is a really nice, sincere holiday record.\n\nTITLE: The title is almost a lyric from “Silver Bells,” but not quite — and that song isn’t even on the album! Still, I don’t know why this is called Christmas in the City, except that it was recorded in Houston, which is a city.\n\nCOVER ART: A photo of Joseph standing in what appears to be a city. Other than the word “Christmas” in the title, there is no other indication that this is a Christmas record. What is he looking at? Why is he leaning against that building? Was this photo taken in June?\n\nLISTENING: He is good at playing the piano, and these are Christmas songs played on the piano. Every now and then, we hear the audience applaud. Some nice versions, and a few unexpected titles near the end!\n\nVERDICT: This is lovely. I almost didn’t include the “live in concert” titles on my list to make it more manageable and yet so far these have been among the most pleasant surprises. This is going on my playlist and I recommend it for in-store play at book stores and high-end shops that sell fancy/classy things.\n\nTITLE: Not a title track! However, it is a very familiar title: The Muppets Xmas record with John Denver was called “A Christmas Together” and Garth Brooks used it too, so points deducted.\n\nCOVER ART: Big painting of a guitar, a city skyline, some huts, a Xmas tree and bell with some mistletoe and holly. The font is quirky.\n\nLISTENING: The great thing about Xmas albums in the streaming era is that you can tell within seconds if a record is for you or not. I knew almost immediately that this one was not to my liking. nine seconds was as far as I got in any track before there was a sound that rubbed me the wrong way. Apologies for being so dismissive but I have to keep moving, I am only four records in and already my brain is breaking a little bit.\n\nVERDICT: I would not mind if I walked through the slowly-dying shopping mall in my hometown while this played, especially Butler’s version of “Away in a Manger” which might be a perfect recording for that exact circumstance.\n\nTITLE: Points for alliteration. This title does feel generic but as a follow-up to Stanley’s 2017 EP of standards (titled Classic) it is more likely that this is the second in a series of records where she attempts to take possession of the “classic” brand.\n\nCOVER ART: Brynn playing peek-a-boo with her white sweater sleeve.\n\nLISTENING: I find it hard to be too critical of an album like this, even if it isn’t the kind of Xmas record I am likely to get super-excited about, personally. These are professionals who know what they’re doing, and Stanley isn’t phoning it in — more than half of the songs on the album aren’t the usual suspects. And Stanley’s “Selfie With Santa” is a song that I suspect a lot of people will love (if that title sparks your interest, it is most likely worth you checking it out.)\n\nVERDICT: Again, this one is not my speed but that’s on me. I don’t have anything critical to say about it. But I have a lot of new records to get through, so I can’t be too forgiving or my personal playlist is gonna be too long.\n\nTITLE: A little bit all-purpose/generic, but not a title track.\n\nCOVER ART: Pasquale stands as if he’s sort of getting out of a car, the door opened just wide enough for him to step out. There are two kids in the car with presents and a little Xmas tree. They’re meant to be outside as there’s a forest behind them, but this looks like an art-directed studio shot. I can’t tell why the “S” and the “C” in the title are red letters when the rest of the title is white. The more I look at this cover, the more I feel like I’m supposed to find the 10 things that are wrong with it.\n\nLISTENING: It opens with kids’ voices talking and asking questions, and I’m disoriented. I automatically picture that it’s the two kids on the cover art, and that makes me think about that car and whether that photo takes place before or after this song, where he sings about the “long road ahead” and that he’ll be “home for Christmas.” That cover has gotten into my head! Why is he getting out of the passenger side? Were the children driving?\n\nVERDICT: I mean, obviously if you are a big fan of Pasquale Esposito, you will probably love this! (That is probably true for a lot of these records, right?) There is one medley that includes “Jingle Bells” and another that includes “Jingle Bell Rock” … and I’m reaching my limit.\n\nTITLE: I always think that the first thing I’d do if I had a title like this — a very common turn of phrase— is to Google it and see how many other things have this title — whether it was other records or books, movies, etc. — and then I’d see if there was anything else at all I could call it. Having said that, the world is a mess and we could maybe use more peace on Earth, so…\n\nCOVER ART: An elegant photo of Kellie Haddock singing into a vintage microphone. The font gives me a Downton Abbey vibe.\n\nLISTENING: Haddock wrote three originals for this: “Bright Christmas” (fun!) “Almost Winter” (dramatic!) and “Bethlehem” (pretty) and the rest of the songs are nicely performed and arranged.\n\nVERDICT: If I had listened to this first, I’d likely have a warmer feeling toward the overall record, which is well-made. But in my depleted state, it’s those three originals that grabbed my attention. They’re good! But I gotta keep moving!\n\nTITLE: OK, I don’t know what this title means. But I like it.\n\nCOVER ART: Michael Lington, saxophonist, stands holding his saxophone by his right leg. His left hand is on his left leg. He wears a white suit with a red scarf and is surrounded by wintry graphics.\n\nLISTENING: It starts off with an instrumental, sax-driven version of “Last Christmas.” There are guest singers. This is one of those records where you will (quite handily) know within seconds whether it’s for you or not. There are no mid-album reveals that will suddenly surprise you.\n\nVERDICT: The sound is a time capsule that takes me back to 1980s shopping malls from my youth, but I admit that he did a version of “Silent Night” that’s completely unlike the previous dozens.\n\nTITLE: Christmas Jukebox is a pretty good title, but not for an EP: The whole point of a jukebox is that it has a lot of songs — this is a jukebox that only has five songs on it! Ideally, this title would’ve been held for someone who was going to record 100 or more Xmas songs for it.\n\nCOVER ART: Ripped green at the top and bottom as if it’s torn wrapping paper, and the picture of Chris Mann is bathed in an almost sinister red. Chris is looking off to the side — at what? We’ll never know…\n\nLISTENING: To his credit, three of these are brand new songs, so you can almost just count something like this as an album by pretending he also did “Silent Night” and “Jingle Bells” and five or six other too-familiar tunes anyway. I’ve heard those songs so many times in so many different styles now that I can pretty much imagine anyone singing them, in any and all styles. Mann’s club version of “Up on the Hilltop” is going on my playlist for later, and his “Auld Lang Syne” is nice, too.\n\nVERDICT: A fun, high-energy party mood. I can’t take it right now because I have a headache. I like it, just… not right this moment.\n\nTITLE: When Nat King Cole and Garth Brooks have already used a title, we should all agree that it’s been used up.\n\nCOVER ART: A woman is looking right at us, through the haze of various Photoshop elements and layers. Is she the Celtic Woman? I assume so.\n\nLISTENING: I always think “I should buy this for my mom” when I hear this kind of record, but then I also wonder if she has too many CDs like this already.\n\nVERDICT: It’s all pretty traditional. Less “Celtic” in places than expected, and in some places exactly as Celtic as I was expecting. It was never more Celtic than I was expecting. I didn’t mind any of it at all, but it also isn’t the thing for me — by the time it gets to yet another version of “Silent Night,” I fall into a coma.\n\nTITLE: Rock by the Sea is a children’s cancer charity, and this is their 10th Xmas compilation with proceeds benefiting pediatric cancer research, so this is the perfect title.\n\nCOVER ART: Angel ornaments on the tree, and info about the charity.\n\nLISTENING: Another solid alt/indie compilation. Truly, you can take most modern Xmas compilation and put them all together on shuffle mode and you will get a nice result. A few new originals, some interesting new interpretations (like Kevn Kinney’s version of “The Christmas Song”) and maybe every now and then you might not like a track. But overall, you don’t get 10 volumes into this kind of alt-Xmas series without knowing what you’re doing.\n\nVERDICT: It’s for a children’s cancer charity! Go to their Bandcamp and buy a copy!\n\nTITLE: Oh, a VERY Merry Christmas? You don’t SAY! This is unprecedented! I mean, I’ve heard of a Merry Christmas, but a very merry one? This I gotta see! How Merry? VERY? Yikes, that is merry!\n\nCOVER ART: Three dudes in flannel shirts and light green pants are photoshopped into what looks like clip art of a snow globe surrounded by some loose XMAS decorations. Are they inside? On a window seat, looking outside? It is hard to tell.\n\nLISTENING: OK, so this is apparently a group that specializes in “alternative music for kids” or “kindie rock” so it’s perfectly fine that I am not on board for this particular kind of fun. They open with a performance of “Jingle Bells” that incorporates the “Batman Smells” lyrical variant.\n\nVERDICT: If this group had come to my elementary school to do a concert when I was a kid, I would have bought their records. But we are decades past that point, so I can move along to the next record.\n\nTITLE: I do wish that Pentatonix would’ve written and recorded a song called “The Best of Pentatonix Christmas.” But they did not, and this is exactly what this record needed to be called.\n\nCOVER ART: Pentatonix sits in front of a Xmas tree. They love Xmas and it shows.\n\nLISTENING: They have recorded a lot of Xmas songs and we are being told these are the best of those songs. You know how “best of’s” work, right? I don’t need to explain this. So if you never bought their previous Xmas albums, this might be the place to start. I am listening, and it’s like a sugar high, it’s so energetic that I feel like they are killing me with holiday cheer. They get to their version of Brian Wilson’s “God Only Knows” and by this point, I have lost my ability to wonder why it’s included; I just accept it blindly, so relieved am I that it’s not “Silent Night.” Leonard Cohen makes his second appearance on a holiday record this year, with their version of “Hallelujah,” which is quietly being forced into the canon by sheer force of will — people really want to make it into a Xmas song, and if it gets recorded once a year on Xmas records for five years in a row, I declare it will officially be one.\n\nVERDICT: 19 tracks and not one of them is “Silent Night,” which at this point is enough for me to give it a thumbs up."
