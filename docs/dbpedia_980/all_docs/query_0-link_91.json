        "text": "Merry Christmas II You\n\nMariah Carey released her second Christmas album, Merry Christmas II You, on November 1, 2010. The album debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart after selling 56,000 copies and was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America on January 11, 2011. Merry Christmas II You reached the top spot on the R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, making it the second Christmas album to ever reach number one.\n\nThe album features eight traditional holiday songs, four new original songs, a re-recorded version of Mariah's massive 1994 hit “All I Want For Christmas Is You” and the live version of “O Holy Night” at the Westminister Presbyterian Church of Los Angeles. For the album, Mariah collaborated with producers Randy Jackson, Jermaine Dupri, James Poyser and Marc Shaiman. “This album is a labor of love — a gift to those who share my excitement about the Christmas season and want to fill this special time of year with heartwarming, festive and uplifting music,” Mariah explained. “I was inspired by the traditional tunes of Nat King Cole and Bing Crosby — I really love those albums. I also enjoyed the festive-sounding ones like those by The Jackson 5. As a result, there are different influences in this album. I also wanted it to be like ‘Part 2’ of the Merry Christmas album. I wanted to keep it classic, traditional, festive and happy and have a warm feeling for the holidays so people will love it. In the spirit of classic Christmas records made in the 1950s, we had a huge orchestra session, and I've never experienced anything so beautiful and rich in my musical career as being in the room listening to the lush orchestral moments.”\n\n“Oh Santa!” was released as the album's first single on October 1, 2010. “‘Oh Santa!’ is a new song that I wrote with my friend Jermaine Dupri and also our friend Bryan Michael-Cox, who works with both of us, we sat in a room and I just came in with a basic idea for how I wanted the beat to be and I kinda knew I wanted it to be like writing a letter to Santa Claus,” Mariah said about the song. “It's hard when you've already written a Christmas ‘classic.’ It's weird for me to say it but it's true 'cause a lot of people have grown up with the song and feel really close to ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You.’ But ‘Oh Santa!’ is a different song, it's just got sort of a similar feeling but it's like a retro '60s type of feeling but still modern. We wanted to keep it really simple in terms of the music.” “Oh Santa!” debuted at number one on Billboard's Holiday Digital Songs chart and became Mariah's forty-third Hot 100 entry, peaking at number one-hundred during the week of January 1, 2011. “Oh Santa!” made its debut at number twelve on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Songs chart and reached the top spot the following week, marking the quickest ascent to the peak position in the chart's history.\n\nAnother original song on the album is “When Christmas Comes,” written with James Poyser of The Roots. “He's an incredible musician,” Mariah explained. “We got together and I wanted everything in this album to feel classic, to feel festive and timeless. It has a 1970s soul.” A new version of the song featuring singer John Legend was released on November 21, 2011. “The duet that I did with John Legend was so much fun, we had the best time,” Mariah told VEVO in 2011. “To hear his voice and the choices that he made, I feel that he really took it up several notches. I just love what he gave to the song, I feel like he gave so much of himself to the song.”\n\nThe album includes a duet with Mariah's mother Patricia on “O Come All Ye Faithful / Hallelujah Chorus.” “Many people already know that my mother is a trained opera singer, so I guess it was only a matter of time before we both got onto a record together,” Mariah explained in 2010. “Doing ‘O Come All Ye Faithful’ and the ‘Hallelujah’ chorus seemed like a perfect vehicle for both of our voices, which are very different in terms of style. It was a lovely experience being in the studio together and I'm very happy that I have this documented for the rest of my life.”\n\nThe new version of “All I Want For Christmas Is You” was arranged by March Shaiman. “When I decided to re-do it. I realized that most people love the original. So I asked Marc to do something beautiful for the introduction of the song,” Mariah explained. “We cut the entire track and put it on live instrumentation as opposed to programmed music. It's essentially the same track, but we re-did it from scratch so theres a bit more soul because live music cuts everything from the beginning. Even the piano is more ‘sober’ towards the end. I even brought back some of the girls who sang backup in the original. One of them is Melonie Daniels, who is a fantastic singer. I'm glad I re-did ‘All I Want For Christmas Is You’ because I think it really enhanced this album.”\n\nTracklist\n\nTrack # Song Run time 1\n\nSanta Claus Is Comin' To Town Intro\n\nWritten by J.

ever know\n\nMake my wish come true\n\nAll I want for Christmas is you…\n\nYou baby\n\nI won't ask for much this Christmas\n\nI won't even wish for snow\n\nI'm just gonna keep on waiting\n\nUnderneath the mistletoe\n\nI won't make a list and send it\n\nTo the North Pole for Saint Nick\n\nI won't even stay awake to\n\nHear those magic reindeer click\n\n'Cause I just want you here tonight\n\nHolding on to me so tight\n\nWhat more can I do\n\nBaby all I want for Christmas is you\n\nYou…\n\nAll the lights are shining\n\nSo brightly everywhere\n\nAnd the sound of children's\n\nLaughter fills the air\n\nAnd everyone is singing\n\nI hear those sleigh bells ringing\n\nSanta won't you bring me the one I really need - won't you please bring my baby to me…\n\nOh I don't want a lot for Christmas\n\nThis is all I'm asking for\n\nI just want to see my baby\n\nStanding right outside my door\n\nOh I just want him for my own\n\nMore than you could ever know\n\nMake my wish come true\n\nBaby all I want for Christmas is\n\nYou…\n\nAll I want for Christmas is you baby\n\n(Repeat)\n\nWritten by Mariah Carey and Walter Afanasieff.\n\nProduced by Mariah Carey, James “Big Jim”
