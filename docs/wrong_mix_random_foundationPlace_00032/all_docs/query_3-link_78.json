        "text": "2. The U.S. Congressional Serial Set Digitization Project  A collaboration of Readex Corporation a division of NewsBank, Inc. and Dartmouth College Library 2005 - 2013\n\n3. This little book was written for our partners at Readex Corporation to commemorate the end of the U. S. Congressional Serial Set Digitization Project. The Dartmouth Project Team\n\n4. Government Printing Office book binders 1910\n\n5. The story to preserve and digitize the U. S. Congressional Serial Set involves many, many people and many, many, many volumes. June 2009 celebration at Readex upon reaching the original project goal.\n\n6. To know the U. S. Congressional Serial Set is to love it.\n\n7. There are almost 16,000 volumes shelved throughout the Dartmouth College Libraries. Volumes were retrieved from the following libraries: •Baker Berry Library •Feldberg Business & Engineering Library •Kresge Physical Sciences Library •Dana Biomedical Library •Sherman Art Library •Rauner Special Collections Library •Storage Library\n\n8. What’s inside the Serial Set: •Transcontinental Railroad •Smithsonian Institution Report •Census Data •US Geological Surveys •Requests for Pensions •War of the Rebellion •Budgets •Post Master General Reports •Patents Illustration of the silk worm stages The first test color scan •Teapot Dome & Watergate\n\n9. Voyages of Discovery… Perry’s Expedition to Japan\n\n10. Fascinating birds of a feather.\n\n12. Frightful trips\n\n13. Addresses from Prominent People\n\n14. Brushes…\n\n15. …and the plants from which they are made.\n\n16. Scientific Experiments…\n\n18. Animals…\n\n21. Along the way we found a remarkable surprise...\n\n22. Original drawing held by the Hood Museum at Dartmouth College. Osage Dance, 1880 -A scene in a war dance, Kiowas, Pawnees, & Osages participating. Julian Scott Ledger Artist A. Graphite and colored crayon on laid ledger paper. Purchased through the Robert Strasenburgh II 1942 Acquisition Fund: D.2003.18.2 Provenance: Julian Scott: by descent in the family; sold to Morning Star Gallery Santa Fe, New Mexico, 1986; sold to Mark Lansburgh, Class of 1949, 1986; sold to present collection, 2003. Hood Museum, Dartmouth College, Hanover, New Hampshire\n\n23. The drawing was reproduced in Serial Set number 3016, page 532. War Dance, 1890 - Participated in by Kiowas, Osages, and Pawnees. Drawn in color by a Comanche boy at Kiowa, Comanche, and Wichita Agency , Oklahoma, September 1890. Reproduction of Osage Dance in Report on Indians Taxed and Indians Not Taxed in the United States (Except Alaska) at the Eleventh Census: 1890 (United States Census Office. Washington, D.C: Government Printing Office, 1894) Serial Set volume 3016, p. 532\n\n24. Another surprise…\n\n26. From a little book comes…\n\n27. A very, very big map !\n\n28. How did all this get done?\n\n29. The Process at Dartmouth: Shipments consisted of 60-65 volumes per week. These would be retrieved in sequence order from the stacks.\n\n30. Cleaning the Books: The books tended to be dusty so they were vacuumed and dusted.\n\n31. Applying Leather Consolidant The sheepskin covers had become powdery so each volume was treated with a 2% Klucel G solution; treatment and date noted on verso of title page.\n\n32. Inventory Control Inscribe front flyleaf with Serial Set number.\n\n33. Add barcodes\n\n34. The Serial Set had not been linked in the Library’s on-line catalog so for each volume an item record was created. In this project we exceeded the system’s limit for item records in a single bibliographic record – twice!\n\n35. Once the item records were created each volume was checked out to “Readex Repair” as it came for treatment. This was critical to keep track of where each volume was located throughout the workflow process at Dartmouth.\n\n36. There was a lot of processing.\n\n37. In the beginning of the project we assessed the condition of each book prior to sending to Readex for scanning; however, we discovered that such great care was being taken at Readex with each volume that we soon decided detailed pre and post scanning reviews were not necessary.\n\n38. Minimal Repairs Many volumes had torn pages which were repaired with heat set tissue or japanese tissue. This was also the case for the hundreds of maps which needed a lot of mending.\n\n39. Extra Paper to Trim\n\n40. Ready for Readex pick up with Packing Slip After repairs are done the shipments are wrapped in plastic ready to go to Readex in Chester, VT.\n\n41. When the books arrived at Readex the project staff tracked each volume from the point of receipt from Dartmouth until it was returned.\n\n42. The Readex Process At Readex project staff carefully scanned each book on a Kirtas machine.\n\n43. Great care was taken to protect the fragile volumes during the scanning.\n\n44. Quality control was applied throughout the production to obtain the best images and confirm completeness of the volume and the publication.\n\n45. Large maps were placed in on a table and photographed from above.\n\n46. Throughout the process the volumes were treated with care.\n\n47. The Editorial Team developed vocabulary to enhance a user’s search experience.\n\n50. When all volumes were accounted for they were packed and returned to Dartmouth.\n\n51. Returned to Home Base\n\n52. Post Scanning Repairs Dartmouth staff delayed some repairs until post scanning. This allowed the Readex team to obtain the best scan possible while minimizing damage to the book. Typical treatments included: •spine lined with japanese tissue •new spine using morki tissue •hollow tube\n\n53. Casing in with japanese tissue\n\n54. New Serial Set number labels were made to match the original ones that had fallen off.\n\n55. Repairs completed ready for final inspection.\n\n56. Ready for the return home to the stacks.\n\n57. Paper is preserved at Dartmouth College Library… …and the digital is secure at Readex.\n\n58. When it was finished…\n\n59.
