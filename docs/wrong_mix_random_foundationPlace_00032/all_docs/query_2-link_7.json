        "text": "MINSK, Belarus | An ailing American lawyer who was imprisoned in Belarus last year on charges of using fake documents and attempted industrial espionage walked free Tuesday night after a presidential pardon.\n\nEmanuel Zeltser, a 55-year-old diabetic, was sentenced to three years in prison in August 2008 after being convicted in a closed trial on charges his supporters called politically motivated.\n\nIn November, Zeltser was placed in a prison hospital after arriving at a penal colony in eastern Belarus, where he was denied medicine, according to lawyers.\n\nOn leaving the prison clinic in the eastern town of Mogilyov, Zeltser said, \"I am glad about my freedom.\"\n\n\"I have problems with my health, I plan to get better. I am not making any plans,\" he said by telephone outside the prison. He refused to comment further.\n\nZeltser, slightly limping, was met by U.S. officials and entered a car with them to head for the U.S. Embassy in Minsk.\n\nPresident Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree pardoning Zeltser earlier Tuesday.\n\nBelarus and its authoritarian leader are on a drive to court better political and economic ties with the West, and Washington had said Zeltser's release would help the process.\n\nU.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said of Zeltser's release \"the United States welcomes this positive step.\"\n\nHe added, in a statement, that consular officials were working with Zeltser's family \"to arrange his swift and safe return to the United States.\"\n\nEarlier, on news that Zeltser would be released, Kelly had said that his imprisonment was \"a major obstacle in our bilateral relations. We still have other concerns, of course, with some of the actions of the Belarusian government. So we're very happy that this one obstacle has been removed, and we'll review our policy as necessary.\""
