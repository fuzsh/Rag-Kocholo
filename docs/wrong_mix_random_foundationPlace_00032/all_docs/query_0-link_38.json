ABOUT INCLO The International Network of Civil Liberties Organizations (INCLO) comprises 15 independent national human rights organizations working to promote fundamental rights and freedoms by supporting and mutually reinforcing the work of member organizations working in their respective countries and collaborating on bilateral and multilateral bases. Each organization is multi-issue, multi-constituency, domestic in focus and independent of government, and advocates on behalf of all people in its country through litigation, legislative campaigning, public education, and grassroots advocacy. The members of INCLO are Agora International Human Rights Group (Agora) in Russia; the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the USA; the Association for Civil Rights in Israel (ACRI); the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA); Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS) in Argentina; the Commission for the Disappeared and Victims of Violence (KontraS) in Indonesia; Dejusticia in Colombia; the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR); the Human Rights Law Centre (HRLC) in Australia; the Human Rights Law Network (HRLN) in India; the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (HCLU); the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL); the Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC); the Legal Resources Centre (LRC) in South Africa; and Liberty in the United Kingdom. Police brutality, discrimination, and protest rights are priority areas for INCLO. INCLO members partner to advocate against government and police repression of protests and to promote human rights activism. INCLO also seeks to promote and protect the right to protest by combining technical work–the compilation of standards and analysis–with creating materials intended for a wider audience. Previous reports include: Take Back the Streets: Repression and Criminalization of Protest Around the World (2013); Defending Dissent: Towards State Practices That Protect and Promote the Right to Protest (2018), in partnership with The Global Human Rights Clinic of the University of Chicago Law School; and Protesting During a Pandemic: State Responses During COVID-19 (2021). The INCLO members that participated in this report are the ACLU, ACRI, Agora, CCLA, CELS, KontraS, Dejusticia, HCLU, HRLC, HRLN, ICCL, KHRC and the LRC.

INCLO INTERNATIONAL NETWORK OF CIVI L LIBERTIES ORGAN IZATIONS 2 Lethal in Disguise 2: How Crowd-Control Weapons Impact Health and Human Rights ABOUT PHR For nearly 30 years, Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) has used science and medicine to document and call attention to mass atrocities and other severe human rights violations. PHR is a global organization founded on the idea that health professionals, with their specialized skills, ethical duties and credible voices, are uniquely positioned to stop human rights violations. PHR’s investigations and expertise are used to advocate for the protection of persecuted health workers, prevent torture, document mass atrocities and hold those who violate human rights accountable. In 1999, PHR led the effort to develop the internationally recognized Manual on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, also known as the Istanbul Protocol, which PHR was instrumental in updating in 2022. PHR has a long history of advocating against weapons that can cause grave injury to civilian populations including organizing against the use of landmines for which PHR shared the Nobel Prize in 1997. As to crowd-control weapons in particular, PHR has assessed the adverse health effects in a number of places, including Bahrain, Egypt, the Occupied Palestinian Territory (OPT), the Republic of Korea (South Korea), Thailand and Türkiye. PHR’s studies have documented severe injuries due to birdshot and rubber bullets in Panama and the OPT, abuse of tear gas posing risks to health in Bahrain, South Korea and Turkey, as well as beatings using batons and sticks. Through direct examination of victims, desk research and scientific evaluation of weaponry and its potential adverse consequences (when used both appropriately and inappropriately), PHR has brought relevant information to advocates and policymakers seeking to curtail responses by police and security forces that not only suppress lawful dissent, but also harm human health.

Physicians for Human Rights 3 Lethal in Disguise 2: How Crowd-Control Weapons Impact Health and Human Rights ABOUT OMEGA Founded in 1990, the Omega Research Foundation (Omega) is a UK-based nongovernmental research organisation. Omega investigates and exposes the global manufacture, trade, procurement, and use of a wide range of military, security, and policing weapons, including small arms and light weapons as well as large weapon systems, surveillance technologies, vehicles, and a wide range of law enforcement equipment. Omega works to ensure that human rights and international humanitarian law violations, including torture and other ill-treatment, are not committed or facilitated by people using such equipment and techniques, so that people are free to exercise their full range of human rights without the threat of violence and repression. as batons with metal spikes, which have no lawful use. Omega also strives to strengthen controls on other weapons that are frequently used for repression and human rights violations, including torture and ill-treatment, such as batons, handcuffs, and tear gas. Omega looks to increase transparency and improve controls on the trade of military, security, and policing equipment worldwide. Omega is working to strengthen use of force standards and their application, support human rights monitors and researchers around the world, force governments to change laws, campaign to control the trade in weapons and equipment, hold corporations and individuals to account, and secure justice for survivors of torture.

The unnecessary and disproportionate use of force often serves not to disperse crowds and quell dissent but rather leads to acrimony and further escalation of conflict. Such uses of force often involve crowd-control weapons (CCWs), weapons ostensibly designed to inflict sublethal pain on individuals.1 The rising popularity of CCWs by state actors highlights alarming trends in policing across the world: growing authoritarianism, the militarization of law enforcement, unregulated and precipitous use of weapons against peaceful, unarmed people, politically biased decisions to use force, little transparency Protests against authoritarian governments around when, how and why CCWs are used were also seen in places such as Hong and no meaningful accountability. The Kong in 2019, in Myanmar, Israel and the result is thousands of people worldwide Occupied Palestinian Territories in 2021, who have been seriously injured or killed by and more recently in Iran, Russia and China these weapons, and the chilling effect of this in 2022. Recent demonstrations have also violence on millions more. played out against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, in which global protests Rigorous documentation of injuries resulting have occurred in response to perceived from the use of CCWs is necessary for government ineptitude or overreach. Whether understanding their impacts both on health this pattern of ongoing protests represents and on assembly, association and free a momentary period of turbulence or a new expression rights. In 2016, the International normal is yet to be seen. What is clear is Network of Civil Liberties Organizations that people-driven protest movements are (INCLO) and Physicians for Human Rights becoming an increasingly common aspect (PHR) published Lethal in Disguise (LiD1), of the 21st-century geopolitical landscape. which was the first report to systematically catalogue the health risks and consequences Law enforcement and security forces have of CCWs. Our 2016 report leveraged an frequently responded to these protests extensive review of the peer-reviewed with excessive force and violence that medical literature, augmented by reviews Public protests have surged across the world in recent years, often led by grassroots movements seeking to challenge social and economic injustices, express discontent and demand transformative change from their governments. Economic inequity led to the 2018 “Yellow Vests” protests in France, and echoes of these protests were felt in the 2019 Chile protests, the 2020 Indian farmers’ protests, and those across Colombia in 2021. George Floyd’s 2020 murder by a policeman set off a historic wave of protests across the United States and globally, while similar cases of police brutality were behind the #EndSARS protests in Nigeria. 1 It is important to note that the violent repression of protesters is not always or solely supported by the use of CCWs. In many countries, including where INCLO member organizations are based (e.g. the United Kingdom), tear gas, water cannons and other CCWs discussed in this report are not used or are banned in the context of peaceful assemblies. However, there are still serious challenges to the full enjoyment of assembly, association and free expression rights. 8 Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary not just to health but also to the meaningful exercise of assembly, association and free expression rights? In raising awareness about the misuse of CCWs, we seek to answer these questions and foster a global debate Since then, the nature, scale, and to develop further international standards documentation of protests–and the and guidelines on the deployment of CCWs. weapons used–have evolved considerably. Ultimately, our goal is to prevent injury, There are numerous reports in the media disability and death by providing information and medical research about thousands of about CCWs and enabling people to exercise people with severe injuries resulting from assembly, association, and free expression CCWs: kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs) have rights safely and freely. caused permanent blindness, brain damage and internal bleeding; chemical irritants This report examines many categories of have caused trauma from the canisters, as CCWs used around the world: including kinetic well as respiratory, skin, and eye injuries impact projectiles (KIPs), chemical irritants, from the chemicals; stun grenades have water cannons, disorientation devices and burned people; and acoustic weapons have acoustic weapons.

What new Based on multiple expert interviews, this report threats do we recognize these weapons pose also demonstrates that injuries have been of news and human rights organisations’ reports and other data, to elucidate the range and scope of injuries from the use–and misuse–of CCWs. 9 Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of findings repeatedly exacerbated by disproportionate, indiscriminate and excessive use of these weapons. We are not intending to claim that public order and safety are not a legitimate state obligation. Too often, however, the use of force and CCWs are used in violation of local, state and international protocols, resulting in disproportionate and excessive use. Nearly all weapons can and are frequently used as indiscriminate tools of collective punishment against peaceful protesters, bystanders and disruptors alike, regardless of their vulnerabilities, actions or potential for causing harm. Some are inherently unlawful, just because they are indiscriminate. Summary of findings2 Kinetic impact projectiles KIPs–commonly referred to as “rubber bullets” or “baton rounds”–are bullet-like missiles used by law enforcement and security forces to deter conduct through the pain of impact. The findings of a systematic review of medical literature indicate that KIPs can cause serious injury, disability, and even death. Our updated research identified 2,190 people with injuries from KIPs reported in medical literature published over the last six years (2016-2021) globally; and at least twelve of the identified people died from Police violence is also frequently their injuries with 945 suffering permanent discriminatory and biased against disabilities. Ocular injuries, including marginalised groups, including racial, ethnic, blindness, account for 1,575 of the injuries political, religious, and other minorities, who reported (65% of the total number of injuries). too often face disproportionate deployments of force and weapons during protests. While These data demonstrate that severe the use of certain CCWs may be warranted in injuries are most likely when KIPs are fired some cases to ensure the safety of the public at close range, when KIPs contain metallic and law enforcement officials, this study components or when multi-projectile KIPs demonstrates that the vast majority of CCWs are used. Of note, the number of injuries are not only unnecessary for this purpose, from metal birdshot found in our literature but their use runs directly counter to the review dwarfs those from other KIPs (82% objective of “public safety and order”. of all injuries). Additionally, we found that from close range, some types of KIPs have a similar ability to penetrate the skin as conventional live ammunition and can be just as lethal. When launched or fired from afar, these weapons are inaccurate and can strike vulnerable body parts and cause unintended injuries to bystanders, especially when multiple projectiles are scattering from one firearm simultaneously. Our conclusion 2 The health effects of KIPs and chemical irritants are described in detail because there is adequate medical data on associated injuries to conduct a robust analysis. For other weapons, we harness the growing social media landscape and the growth of online news media sources to identify and catalogue injuries reported resulting from weapons. 10 Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of findings is that it is doubtful that these weapons can be used in a manner that is both safe and effective in a protest setting. as a result of metal birdshot, a hunting munition pressed into service in several countries as a KIP. This report illustrates metal pellets’ imprecision, indiscriminate nature, and unmatched capacity to maim. Key findings on KIPs › › › Increase in use and injuries: Since the publication of LiD1, data on the use of KIPs to suppress mass dissent has more clearly illustrated the true health cost of the proliferation of KIPs in law enforcement and security forces worldwide. Focusing on literature published from 2016-2021, 2,190 persons were injured or killed by KIPs, mostly in protest settings, a number greater than LiD1’s total of 1,984 persons reported as injured and killed based on literature published before 2016. Multi-projectiles: The finding of widespread injuries from multi-projectile KIPs–where multiple projectiles are fired at once–demonstrates the harmful effects of these inherently indiscriminate weapons. They cannot effectively target a single individual or a single body part, and their use has resulted in serious injuries to targeted individuals (when they impact sensitive body parts) and to bystanders (when the projectiles miss the intended target, instead affecting those not targeted). The results of our analysis suggest that these weapons are more dangerous than single projectiles and leading us to call for a prohibition on their use as a first step in limiting harm from KIPs. Metal pellets: The vast majority of reported severe injuries (82%) occurred › “Hybrid” weapons: The development and proliferation of “hybrid” weapons that combine characteristics of KIPs with other CCWs, such as “pepper balls” or stun grenades that disperse rubber balls, are proliferating technologies that must be closely observed and evaluated. › Canisters misused as KIPs: Tear gas canisters, when fired directly at protesters, can be extraordinarily hazardous. These devices and their resultant injuries are reviewed in the chemical irritants section, but the ad hoc use of other weapons as KIPs must be further examined and regulated. Chemical irritants Commonly referred to as “tear gas” and “pepper spray,” chemical irritants include a variety of chemical compounds intended to irritate the senses. The general perception is that these weapons have mostly shortterm effects that include irritation of the eyes, dermal pain, respiratory distress, and the psychological effects of disorientation and agitation. A systematic review of medical literature documenting the health effects of chemical irritants identified over 100,000 people who have been injured since 2015. At least fourteen people have died, all of them 11 Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of findings because of trauma inflicted by the canister.3 While chemical irritants are often thought of as causing minimal transient harm, our findings also identify longer-term risks, including permanent disability and death from their use and misuse. recent medical literature associated with tear gas have occurred due to impacts from military-grade tear gas canisters. › New hazards recognized as a result of the airborne transmission of viruses, such as COVID-19: The extensive use of chemical irritants during the pandemic has increased the risk of adverse medical effects due to COVID19’s effects on breathing and the lungs, as well as the risk of infection through induced coughing or sneezing. While there is limited information on the incidence of COVID-19 in the setting of tear gas exposure, this issue continues to be of concern as the pandemic continues, and others will likely follow. › Psychological impacts: The psychological impacts of the use of CCWs have not been extensively studied nor documented in the medical literature, but cases documented in this review indicate that exposure to chemical irritants may result in significant psychological effects, including potential long-term disability. Key findings on chemical irritants › 3 12 Extensive use, limited evaluation: Tear gas has continued to be used extensively around the world. While chemical irritants continue to be the primary crowd-control agent used by law enforcement and security forces to repress and disperse protests, there is almost no publicly accessible manufacturer or governmentsanctioned literature on the composition, health or environmental safety standards on the use of these weapons. › New ways of deployment: Beyond the use of traditional canisters, sprays, and grenades, the use of chemical irritants diluted in water cannons is a growing problem, with reports of resulting skin irritation and pain. There has also been growing use of other composite weapons, such as pepper balls or water cannons laced with chemical irritants, which complicate the identification of weapons, as well as the treatment of injuries. › Canisters misused as KIPs: Dense and metallic tear gas canisters can easily cause fatal injuries when fired at the head or torso. All deaths reported in The deaths reported were primarily in Iraq where military-grade canisters were used. Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of findings Other weapons4 Acoustic weapons Water cannons Acoustic weapons, sometimes called sound cannons or sonic cannons, indiscriminately emit painful, loud sounds that have the potential to cause significant harm to the eardrums and delicate organs of the ears and may cause hearing loss. Eardrum injury and hearing loss have been reported in a handful of lawsuits and other cases; serious questions remain about their safety and efficacy in protest contexts. Water cannons are inherently indiscriminate, particularly at long distances. They can also make communicating with protesters difficult. Their intimidating size and appearance may cause panic leading to stampedes among protesters. We found that blunt trauma from their force has resulted in blindness, head trauma and fractured bones in a number of people. The use of coloured dyes, chemical irritants, or malodorants in conjunction with a water cannon is a form of collective Blunt force weapons punishment which underscores the potential Blunt force weapons (i.e. batons) are perhaps for abuse of these weapons. the most recognizable police weapon used against protestors. These include many Disorientation devices variations of a stick or club, depending on Disorientation devices, also known as “flash- history, culture and context. Batons can be bangs” or stun grenades, create a loud defensive weapons, but in the context of explosion and, in some instances, a bright protests, they are frequently used as offensive flash of light. They are made of both metal weapons, sometimes in conjunction with and plastic parts that may fragment during other weapons, to shove, strike, hold or apply the explosion and therefore carry risks of pressure on people. Batons, depending on blast injuries to targeted individuals and the force and the location of the strike, can bystanders. Explosions that occur close to cause anything from mere bruising to lifepeople have led to amputation, fractures, threatening blunt trauma. We highlight cases burns and death. Additionally, the ability in Italy, India, Chile and Kenya that illustrate to precisely place these thrown devices the potential for abuse of batons in protests is questionable, especially when used in and demand broad regulation of the use of protest settings. There are frequent news this type of weapon in protest settings. reports and anecdotal evidence of injuries and deaths from these weapons, including reports of injuries to military, corrections, and other law enforcement officials while handling these devices. 4 Although to date there is limited evidence in the medical literature on the safety of water cannons, disorientation devices, acoustic weapons, blunt force weapons (batons) and remotely operated vehicles, case studies involving these weapons demonstrate their capacity for causing significant harm to protesters. 13 Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of recommendations New frontiers 5 Electronic conduction devices Electronic conduction devices (ECDs), such as tasers and electric shields, are transitioning from weapons used primarily in arrest or carceral settings to protest contexts. Cardiac arrhythmias, muscle damage and electric burns (both on the skin and internally) may result from electrical conduction, and there may be trauma from the barbs or shields that compounds the danger. ECDs have been identified as contributing factors in over 100 incustody deaths in the United States as well as thousands of injuries globally. Expanding the use of these weapons to more people poses the risk of far more injuries. is appropriate. Mistakes are frequent in military drone strikes, and, by extension, any deployment of drones capable of firing CCWs in protest settings is concerning. To our knowledge, although drones that fire CCWs have only been used by Israeli law enforcement and security forces, a large number of countries have purchased these technologies, leading to concerns about their expanding use. Access to medical care The health effects described in this report may be exacerbated by factors that serve to impede access to medical care. These include restricted access to medical transport, forbidding or restricting medical assistance at protests, direct attacks on medical professionals and street medics, Remotely operated vehicles and the chilling effect of detaining those Remotely operated vehicles, more commonly injured by CCWs at medical facilities, which known as drones, have seen massive growth leads people not to seek necessary medical in the past decade. Civil liberties experts attention. These barriers to access to timely note that the use of drone technology is the medical care have played a significant most concerning CCWs development in role in increasing the risk of serious injury, the past five years. To date, they have been permanent disability, or death from CCWs. primarily used for surveillance, but they are increasingly being used to carry and fire CCWs. Both of these uses are problematic in terms of injury and the potential to violate Since LiD1 was published in 2016, we have fundamental rights. seen both improvements and mounting challenges to limiting the dangerous use of These weapons may cause additional risk CCWs. The initial report was well received and of injury because they can be employed led to numerous national and international remotely from the actual physical location of discussions around better regulation, law enforcement or security forces, which resulting in the development of the 2020 can limit in-person judgements of how, when, United Nations Human Rights Guidance on on whom, and how much of a response Less-Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement Summary of recommendations 5 drones. 14 New frontiers in protest contexts include the use of electric weapons (such as tasers) and remotely operated vehicles such as Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of recommendations (UN Guidance).6 Protesters are now more aware of potential injuries and have better tools to report on their experiences. At the same time, weapons manufacture and use have proliferated, resulting in more injuries and less accountability for their harm. In many countries, there is still a lack of documentation, reporting and investigation of CCWs injuries. Meaningful accountability for CCWs abuses remains rare. In the light of the evidence gathered in this report, INCLO and PHR, with contributions from the Omega Research Foundation, propose several recommendations on all aspects of CCWs use, including: regulating manufacturing and transparency in their design, composition, and testing, to regulating their trade and use; promoting the reporting of all uses of CCWs and seeking accountability for misuse. The purpose of the recommendations, found in detail in Section 4, is to reduce injuries, disabilities and deaths caused by CCWs; to bolster international guidelines for the use of CCWs; to ensure the protection and promotion of assembly, association and free expression rights; to seek accountability in cases of harm; and to develop safe practices for the occasions where these weapons are deployed. These recommendations are based on two core principles: (1) protecting health and limiting injuries; and (2) ensuring the meaningful exercise of the right of assembly, association and free expression. Design, development, and procurement › CCWs and related equipment intended for use in the context of protests must be designed and produced in a way that ensures that they meet legitimate law enforcement objectives and comply with international law and standards. This duty applies to states and their agents as well as to companies that manufacture weapons for law enforcement (recommendation 1). › Information on CCWs, including manufacturer testing data and safety data sheets, must be made publicly accessible (recommendations 5-6). › International, regional and national controls should be adopted on the trade in CCWs and equipment. These should prohibit the trade in inherently abusive weapons and equipment and control the trade in CCWs that are misused to ensure that they are not used in human rights abuses (recommendation 7). › Testing, evaluation and approval should include a multidisciplinary approach that, in addition to law enforcement and manufacturers, includes policymakers, academics, health professionals and other relevant civil society actors. Testing of CCWs should consider, at the least, legality, level of target accuracy, risk of lethality, risk of serious injury or disability, level of pain inflicted, operational 6 United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations Human Rights Guidance on Less-Lethal Weapons in Law Enforcement, 2020 (UN Guidance on LLWs), accessible at: https://www.ohchr.org/Documents/HRBodies/CCPR/LLW_ Guidance.pdf. 15 Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of recommendations lifespan, reliability (i.e., minimal risk of malfunction) and other relevant factors (recommendations 8-13). › Selection and procurement of weapons must comply all domestic and international standards, and information about the process and the inventories should be made publicly accessible (recommendations 14-16). Regulations and training › States should engage with and support internationaland regional-level processes to develop trade controls, including the United Nations (UN) process on controls on the trade in tools of torture (call to the UN number 4). › Regulations, procedures, and/or protocols on the use of CCWs should be developed for law enforcement based on applicable domestic, regional and international laws. Treaty obligations and international standards should be observed and operationalized in the protocols. These should also reflect the findings from independent testing. Law enforcement should never rely solely on manufacturers’ instructions (recommendation 17). › 16 Law enforcement should be trained in human rights and legal standards as well as human rights-compliant use of CCWs. In addition to teaching the technical aspects of the weapon and its use, training should be contextual, including addressing the specific aspects and challenges of managing protests in compliance with all international, national and local laws (recommendations 19-27). Use of force › The use of any kind of force, including CCWs, must always comply with the principles of necessity, proportionality, legality, precaution, non-discrimination, and accountability (recommendation 28). › Appropriate de-escalation techniques should be used to minimise the risk of violence. Law enforcement officials should be aware that even the display of CCWs may escalate tensions during protests. Where force is proportionate and is necessary to achieve a legitimate law enforcement objective, all possible precautionary steps must be taken to avoid, or at least minimise, the risk of injury or death (recommendations 2930). › Where a decision to disperse a crowd is taken in conformity with domestic and international law, force should be avoided. Where that is not possible under the circumstances, only the minimum force necessary may be used, with consideration of proportionality, and then only after very clear warnings and opportunities to comply have been made (recommendations 31-34). Deployment of crowd-control weapons › This report makes it clear that KIPs can cause serious injuries, permanent disability and even death. Severe injuries Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of recommendations are more likely when KIPs are fired at close range. When launched from afar, these weapons are often inaccurate and can strike vulnerable body parts or bystanders. Therefore, the medical evidence in this report underscores that KIPs should never be fired indiscriminately into groups and are, in general, an inappropriate weapon in any protest context (recommendation 36). › Chemical irritants, when deployed using canisters or grenades, are inherently indiscriminate by nature, cause severe pain and injuries and frequently escalate tensions. Therefore, extreme caution must be used before and during deployment, including considerations of the presence of bystanders and the existence of areas of egress and airflow to minimise any risk of overexposure due to serious risk of injury (recommendation 41).7 › Many CCWs, including water cannons and acoustic weapons, are indiscriminate in nature and must be restricted and, if used at all, used with extreme caution in protest contexts (recommendations 4446 and 51-53). › Batons should only be used in exceptional circumstances and only against violent individuals posing significant risks to themselves or others (recommendations 54-56). › Some weapons have already been determined to cause disproportionate harm to health, undue collective punishment, or both, and must be prohibited. These include any kind of live ammunition (recommendation 36); KIPs that fire multiple projectiles at once, also known as “scatter shot” (recommendation 38); any projectiles with metal components or cores, including rubber-coated metal bullets, bean bag rounds and PVC-metal composite material, any projectiles with lead (recommendation 39); and pellet rounds, such as “birdshot” (recommendation 40); chemical irritants, including launchers that fire multiple chemical irritant canisters, such as the Venom system, excessively dense or high-grade canisters, canisters with additives or ingredients within them, sprays and grenades that are determined to be toxic or hazardous, have passed their expiration date or are otherwise in disrepair (recommendation 42); dye, chemical irritants or malodorants mixed with or sprayed with water cannons (recommendation 47 and 48); disorientation devices, such as stun grenades, explosive grenades or other flash bang weaponry (recommendations 49 and 50); direct 7 INCLO member, the ACLU, supports these recommendations and, additionally, calls for a full prohibition of chemical irritants and all indiscriminate CCWs on any mass gathering or assembly. In July 2020, the ACLU submitted a statement to the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) which among other things stated that: “[p]olice response to protests and other mass assemblies should not involve militarized displays or mass violence by the government, and law enforcement should never deploy indiscriminate weapons, such as tear gas and stun grenades, on any mass gathering or assembly.” Several cities and states in the United States have proposed bills to ban or severely restrict the use of tear gas and/or KIPs in the context of protest. For example, the City of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has categorically banned the use of chemical weapons and kinetic energy munitions by the police against any individual engaging in First Amendment activities. 17 Lethal in Disguise 2 – Executive summary: Summary of recommendations contact electric shock weapons; some blunt force weapons, such as whips and weighted or spiked batons (recommendation 56); and fully autonomous weapons systems (recommendation 58). › › Some weapons are concerning because of the risk of severe injuries or human rights violations. A moratorium on the use of these weapons in protest contexts should be issued until further evidence of their impacts has been collected and the boundaries of their lawful use have been established. These weapons include remotely operated armed drones, the development or use of directed energy weapons, and all other electric shock devices (recommendation 58). For some weapons, the methods and contexts of use can exacerbate injuries, escalate tensions and compound rights violations. As a result, their methods of use must be restricted and limited. Specifically, firing in enclosed or confined spaces, using excessive quantities, exposing vulnerable individuals, including children, the disabled and older persons, and/or firing weapons directly at individuals or into dense crowds (recommendations 37 and 43, 54-55, and 57). Post-deployment procedures and accountability › 18 Medical care for sick and wounded people must not be restricted or interfered with and identities of those seeking care should not be released to law enforcement (recommendations 59-61). › Law enforcement officials should record and report any use of CCWs, including specific models of CCWs deployed, the distances from the targeted individuals and/or bystanders and duration of deployment, the number of each type of CCW used, and the specifics of any injuries caused by CCWs. Review of this reporting must confirm that the reporting is accurate, and that the that the use of CCWs was proportionate, necessary, and lawful (recommendation 62). › There should be a visible identification and a clear chain of command whenever CCWs are used, in order to ensure responsibility and accountability. All decisions taken should be traceable, and those who have taken them must be held accountable (recommendations 63-64). › All deaths, injuries and suspected misuses of CCWs should be thoroughly investigated by a body independent of the implicated officials, with a view to establishing responsibilities and accountability of the officials involved, including the various levels of the command structure in charge during the incident. Where there is evidence of unlawful conduct, commanders and responsible officers should face administrative disciplinary measures and/or criminal prosecution, as appropriate (recommendations 65-67).

The consequences of the extended and growing use of these weapons have ranged from mild to severe injuries, including deaths. In 2016, the International Network of Civil Liberties Organisations (INCLO) and Physicians for Human Rights (PHR) published a first-of-its-kind report, Lethal in Disguise: The Health Consequences of Crowd-Control Weapons (LiD1). It provided the most comprehensive evaluation to date of the medical issues around the use of CCWs and how they are used to repress the rights to free speech and assembly. Since LiD1, CCWs are still used in responses by law enforcement9 to popular protests, mainly through interventions consisting of largescale crowd dispersal operations using these weapons indiscriminately. Also known as “riot-control weapons,” “nonlethal,” “less lethal,” or “less than lethal” weapons, CCWs include kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs),10 chemical irritants, acoustic weapons, water cannons, stun grenades, electrical conduction devices, and directed energy weapons, among others. We employ the term “crowd-control weapons” (CCWs) to denote both the weapons being discussed and the context of their use. As protests continue, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, and more repressive responses by states, including CCWs abuses, continue to expand, we now update and strengthen our initial reporting. Lethal in Disguise 2: How Crowd-Control Weapons Impact Health and Human Rights examines the continued use and abuse of CCWs, expands the discussion of legal and contextual dimensions, and explores historical and modern trends in policing. As a result of our ongoing research, we have also established the Lethal in Disguise platform, a web-based portal which includes additional CCWs-related resources. It is accessible at lethalindisguise.org. CCWs have been misused in many flagrant incidents around the world since LID1 was published six years ago, and they became more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic - whether as a part of ongoing social movements as in Chile, Hong Kong, and India or catalysed by ineffective governmental responses to the pandemic as in Brazil.11 New protests have also emerged during the pandemic in response to police brutality, both inspired by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and due to ongoing human rights violations like the anti-SARS protests in Nigeria and the national strike in 9 Throughout this report, we use the term “law enforcement” to encompass a broad definition of police and security forces. In particular, we rely on the definition of “law enforcement officials” used in the Basic Principles id, which “includes all officers of the law, whether appointed or elected, who exercise police powers, especially the powers of arrest or detention. In countries where police powers are exercised by military authorities, whether uniformed or not, or by [s]tate security forces, the definition of law enforcement officials shall be regarded as including officers of such services.” 10 KIPs are among the types of weapons police use in the context of protests, but there is debate on whether it is proper for them to be included under the umbrella term of “crowd-control weapons.” This infers that they are appropriate tools for the management of assemblies, including to disperse assemblies. However, as the research in this section demonstrates, KIPs are dangerous weapons that are difficult to target in the context of protests and can cause serious injuries or even death. 11 See INCLO, Protesting during a pandemic: State responses during COVID-19, April 2021, accessible at: https://files.inclo.net/ content/pdf/55/Protest-and-State-Response-V7.pdf. 20 Lethal in Disguise 2 - Introduction: Methodology and limitations Respect for assembly, association and free expression rights is one of the key indicators of a government’s respect for human rights and one of the pillars of modern democracies. Colombia. These cases and others point to a growing trend of law enforcement using CCWs against crowds in inappropriate, unnecessary, unlawful, and disproportionate ways, causing severe and even fatal injuries. Methodology and limitations The findings in this report are based on research conducted jointly by INCLO and PHR, first from 2014-2015 and then from 2021-2022. This additional research expands on and updates our original findings and recommendations in LiD1. There are complex linkages among laws and policies directed at protests, policing norms, and technological advances in CCWs that put both human rights and health at risk. We cannot properly understand the health impacts of CCWs without exploring the legal standards, the cultural and historical practices of law enforcement, the push-pull tensions between entrenched practices and reform, and the medical evidence. As such, this report is based on a triangulation of multiple methods: interviews, desk research, systematic reviews of peer-reviewed medical literature, and case study analysis. In this version, we have updated our extensive research on CCWs, including chemical irritants, KIPs, acoustic weapons, water cannons, stun grenades, directed energy weapons, and added reviews of blunt force weapons (i.e. batons), electrical conduction devices, and other emerging tools and technologies. Research topics included a history of the weapons, mechanisms of action, and an analysis of the harms produced by their use. Significantly, we developed case study examples from INCLO members to demonstrate the concrete realities on the ground in different contexts. The analysis of the identified CCWs, their use, and their impact required diverse methods of inquiry and investigation. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to conduct systematic literature reviews of peerreviewed publications that documented the health impacts of KIPs and chemical irritants. The searches for these two weapons were limited to peer-reviewed medical journals and publications to ensure high-quality data. Papers were included if they were published between 1 January 2015 and 28 February 2022 and documented symptoms, injuries and/or deaths associated with these weapons. Given the dearth of published studies, searches included publications discussing the use of these CCWs in protests, military or police training exercises, accidental discharges, and other police use in different contexts. Full details on the methodology we used is available in 21 Lethal in Disguise 2 - Introduction: Methodology and limitations previously published research papers.12 In this report, prior data were updated, and the findings were revised to highlight changes and emphasise ongoing concerns.13 For other weapons categories, including water cannons, disorientation devices, acoustic weapons, batons, and other weapons, there is even less published data for review. In these cases, we also analysed case-series14 describing the health effects of using these CCWs, using data available in medical journals, news media, social media, grey literature, human rights organisational reports, government reports and legal documents, among other sources. While we sought to identify the full scope and range of injuries possible, the absence of systematic reporting requirements for deaths and injuries in crowd-control and protest settings makes it likely that the numbers of reported deaths and injuries are significantly underestimated. Moreover, comparative and risk analyses are not possible due to the lack of global data on the health impacts of these weapons. To further contextualise documented injuries, between October 2021 and March 2022, we interviewed 22 civil liberties advocates from eighteen countries across six continents who litigate, advocate and work on protest-related issues. These experts, all civil liberties lawyers who collectively bring years of experience in human rights, CCWs, and policing and civil liberties, were interviewed in their professional capacity. We conducted teleconference interviews and used deductive and inductive analysis to identify key themes from the interviews. The countries represented through these interviews are Australia, Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Kenya, Nigeria, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. These countries have a wide range of political and legal systems, recent protest themes, and cultural practices. The interview process was reviewed and approved by the UC Berkeley Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects (Protocol ID: 2021-0814599). In 2016, LiD1 was the first rigorous effort to explore how law enforcement uses CCWs to perpetrate human rights violations in the course of managing protests and the health effects of these practices. This second edition builds on that foundation by expanding our knowledge of the health impacts of CCWs while also exploring the legal and practical contexts in which they are used. This research underpins concrete recommendations for strengthening standards and regulations 12 RJ Haar et al., “Health impacts of chemical irritants used for crowd control: a systematic review of the injuries and deaths caused by tear gas and pepper spray,” BMC Public Health 17, no 1b (October 2017): 831, doi:10.1186/s12889-017-4814-6; and RJ Haar et al., “Death, injury and disability from kinetic impact projectiles in crowd-control settings: a systematic review,” BMJ Open 7 (2017): e018154, doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2017-018154 A systematic review of the literature is a rigorous methodology to identify literature on a subject.

In analysing the results of our review of the published literature, we recognize that this literature fails to document the entire scope of harm from CCWs. Our analysis can therefore provide only some insight into the range of potential injuries. Similarly, interviews with individuals working to advance human rights and civil liberties were designed to present a range of expert opinions and personal and professional experiences in diverse contexts. Our interviews were by no means comprehensive or representative of entire countries or populations. Anti-government protests, whether to protest authoritarian activities or economic corruption, have also been widespread. Public health protests since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to protest maskwearing or other lockdown measures also occurred in all regions of the world.16 The health, economic and social emergency caused by the COVID-19 pandemic aggravated inequities affecting already marginalised communities in many countries. These included unjust labour practices, a lack of basic sanitation, inadequate living conditions and education, and unfair land use policies. Labour protests may not have received as much attention, but they were widespread and frequent. Trends and context of recent protests and movements Interviews with the 22 civil liberties experts highlighted some overarching trends in social movements that may provide insight into why and when CCWs are used and the mechanisms by which they can cause injuries. These interviews were by no means representative of the geography or scope of protests in current times, but they build on decades of experience and expertise in countries with INCLO members.15 Protests are complex and dynamic, and it is difficult to compare the frequency or size of demonstrations, marches, protests and other campaigns over the years. It is important, however, that the social movements that The climate justice movement has also seen dramatic growth in the past five years; climate-related protests have been characterised by traditional marches and protests, but also school strikes by students. There have also been incidents of locking-on or protesting on private property, especially in relation to corporations engaging in oil and gas manufacture by those who have settled or function on indigenous land. Many of the above movements are interrelated and have mutually shared goals, participant communities and activities. 15 I Ortiz et al., “An Analysis of World Protests 2006-2020,” in World Protests (2022), pp 13-81, Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, doi:10.1007/978-3-030-88513-7. 16 See https://www.icnl.org/covid19tracker/. 23 Lethal in Disguise 2 - Introduction: Trends and context of recent protests and movements In almost every case, law enforcement has been responsible for the management of protests. In some cases, special public order units have been deployed. In others, varying combinations of federal, state or local police have been deployed. In rare cases, the military or government security agencies have supported local police. On occasion, private security organisations or non-state actors have supported law enforcement operations. Within law enforcement institutions, specific public order response teams that mobilise or respond to protests are frequently used. This is an area where experts noted increased militarization techniques, weapons and strategy. The use of private security personnel has also increased in responding to climate justice protests, such as in protests led by environmental activists against construction activities. rights, the management of assemblies, and the appropriate use of CCWs. In general terms, they noted that police units had not been sufficiently trained in de-escalation techniques. That failure is evident in the way that law enforcement officials respond to protests and how often they resort to the use of force. In many countries, there is also a lack of training or any knowledge of protocols for the management of assemblies. Additionally, when military or reserve units are mobilised to support police, these units often have even less training in how to manage public gatherings or how to deploy CCWs safely. Interviewed experts noted that law enforcement has also responded to protests in other ways beyond the use of force. Among these, surveillance of protests and protesters and arrests of organisers and others appear to be the most common measures. In almost Many of our interviewees noted that the every country studied, some form or another training of law enforcement officials and of surveillance technology is being used: other personnel is often suboptimal and tapping of the phones or social media activity highly variable in the amount and quality of organisers; the use of video surveillance of training on the foundations of protest and facial recognition technologies during 24 Lethal in Disguise 2 - Introduction: History and culture of policing protests; media monitoring programs; closed circuit televisions (CCTV); drone surveillance; and even UV-related or coloured dye in water cannons have been used to identify and track individuals. assemblies across the world. This history has often resulted in a military mentality of police, who treat protesters as the “enemy” rather than fellow members of their community whom they are entrusted to protect. Interviewees stated that, in many cases, protesters are arrested or detained, purportedly for being violent or threatening public order, safety, or national security, with limited to no justification. Frequently, these arrests are of non-violent people who are only exercising their rights to assemble and speak. While most people are released soon after their detention or arrest, there are many instances of ongoing cases. Land occupier movements are especially at risk of conviction. Intimidation and arrests have resulted in both the explicit and implicit chilling of protest rights. This history and culture, according to the interviewees, may also influence how police use the laws and their powers to restrict some protests and not others. Interviewed experts noted that often political protests and antigovernment or anti-police brutality protests were treated with far more aggression than other types of demonstrations. In many contexts in which we conducted interviews, there is disproportionate repression of protest rights among socioeconomically, ethnically or culturally marginalised populations such as Black people, LGBTQ+ groups, Roma, indigenous groups, migrants and refugees. Journalists, particularly women journalists, have been targeted specifically or through a lack of specific protections in many protests. Interviewees noted that the level of repression of protests due to the viewpoints of the protesters had been based on a number of factors, including political affiliation and if the cause was perceived as opposing government or law enforcement practices. Anti-police violence protests, such as the BLM marches, for example, have been met with disproportionately high levels of violence. Per our interviews, the repression of environmental protesters has been a growing and concerning trend. In some countries, progressive or leftwing protesters also appear to face more severe uses of force or other repressive measures than conservative or right-wing protests. History and culture of policing Civil liberties experts also spoke of the importance of the history and culture of policing and the crucial role the police play in understanding current police behaviours, especially concerning protests and the use of CCWs. There are significant differences across regions, countries, and even police departments within a country, and this section touches only on issues reported by the experts interviewed. They noted that historically, and in many contexts, racism, classism, and legacies of colonialism, political repression, authoritarianism, and slavery have influenced law enforcement practices. A deeply rooted culture of impunity has resulted in the normalization of excessive uses of force and repressive policing of IMAGE LEFT: POLICE IN RIOT GEAR SURROUNDED BY TEAR GAS AND PINK COLOR SMOKE BOMB IN TACTICAL TRAINING MR.

For each type of weapon, we review the weapon profile (history and description of the device), the mechanism of action (how the weapon works), and what is known about the health effects. In updating this report, we also summarise notable changes in the use, misuse, or advocacy related to each weapon since the publication of LiD1 in 2016.

This allowed for a detailed analysis of new patterns of injury observed over the last six years. We consulted with partner organisations of INCLO members who offered invaluable and alarming insights on the health impacts of CCWs. While not used as primary sources for this study, social media accounts of the misuse of CCWs brought to our attention emerging trends in these weapon systems. In addition to updating the sections on KIPs, chemical irritants, water cannons, and acoustic weapons, we have added new sections on disorientation devices (“stun” grenades) and batons.

BRENDAN HOFFMAN | GETTY IMAGES Weapon profile Kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs) are bulletlike missiles used in various law enforcement contexts as a deterrent through the pain of impact. Shot from firearms, these weapons were developed to offer the deterrent power of handheld baton strikes from greater physical distances. The staggering variety of KIPs has led to an abundance of common and trade names for what are often referred to as “baton rounds.” KIPs are most commonly dubbed “rubber bullets” regardless of their composition: modern KIPs are most commonly made of plastic (“foamtipped plastic bullets,” “plastic baton rounds,” “sponge grenades,” “Flashball rounds”), metal (“rubber-coated metal bullets,” “pellets,” “birdshot,” “flexible baton rounds,” “bean bag rounds,” “Super-sock”), or other materials such as wood or rock salt. 28 The development of KIPs for crowd control is linked to the colonial policing of the British Empire. Early forms of KIPs used in protests were sawed-off pieces of wooden broom handles that were shot at rioters in Singapore in the 1880s. In the 1960s, slightly more advanced wooden bullets were developed in the United Kingdom and used against protesters in Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore. The British Army initially developed wooden and then plastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and rubber bullets for use during the conflict in Northern Ireland. In parallel, the United States introduced rubber bullets to quell Vietnam War protests but temporarily halted their use in protests after a fatality in 1971. Over the past 40 years, the production of KIPs has spread from a few manufacturers in the United States and the United Kingdom to dozens of producers throughout the world. Manufacturers now produce more than 75 different types of Lethal in Disguise 2 - Crowd-control weapons and their impacts: Kinetic impact projectiles bullets and launchers.17 Today, KIPs have found widespread use both in everyday policing and in crowd control as an addition to an arsenal that includes firearms, batons, chemical irritants, and more. The global CCW market was estimated at $867.4 million in 2019 and is expected to continue to grow well into this decade.18 Some bullets are designed to be fired as a single missile, while others are fired as a group of small projectiles. The latter are sometimes known as “pellets,” “scatter shot”, or “multiple projectile rounds”, where many small- to medium-sized spheres are fired at a broad target. “Bean bag rounds” also consist of small metal pellets that are stitched into a synthetic cloth bag designed to expand on impact and therefore behave as a single projectile. Newer weapons include projectiles with a hard outer shell encasing chemical irritants that explode upon impact, or “attenuated energy projectiles,” where a hollow tip can limit the risk of ricochet or penetration by crushing into itself on impact. bullets designed as KIPs have been used for crowd control, and LiD1 highlighted the extreme danger posed by these weapons. This report highlights the impact of metal hunting bullets that have been arbitrarily designated “less-lethal” by virtue of protocols intended to reduce their lethality. While both types of weapons are used for crowd control in a similar manner to other KIPs, their inherent killing power has left a huge number of injuries, disabilities, and deaths in the wake of their use, as detailed further below. KIP weapons exemplify the “elephant in the room” problem of less-lethal weapons: To date, no organisation, study, or report has clearly and objectively defined what makes a weapon lethal, less-lethal, or non-lethal– much less acceptably “safe.” The decision is typically left to the very organisations tasked with procuring CCWs–or the government entities demonstrators often protest against– to determine whether said weapons achieve a level of acceptable lethality. There are heterogeneous rules across countries and jurisdictions, ranging from allout bans to free Of special concern are metallic rounds used use of all KIPs and many permutations in for crowd control. Due to their density and between. typically high velocities of impact, these pose greater inherent risks than rounds made of any other material.

See, also, Global Non-Lethal Weapons Market Report 2013-2018. Manufacturing of KIPs takes place in locations as diverse as Brazil, China, Israel, South Africa, South Korea, and the United States. 18 Grand View Research, “Less Lethal Ammunition Market Size, Share & Trends Analysis Report By Weapon Type (Shotguns, Launchers), By End Use (Law Enforcement, Military), By Product, By Region, And Segment Forecasts, 2020 - 2027,” accessible at: https:// www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/less-lethal-ammunition-market. 29 Lethal in Disguise 2 - Crowd-control weapons and their impacts: Kinetic impact projectiles Sidebar Defining “lethal” versus “non-lethal” Clearly defining “lethal” versus “non-lethal” projectiles has proven difficult. Most physical based guidelines for defining less-lethal impact projectiles stem from a 1977 pilot study by the United States Army’s Human Engineering Laboratory, which established an “extensive damage” threshold of 90 footpounds (approximately 120 joules) of kinetic energy of impact, beyond which severe damage to the human body was highly likely.19 However, this threshold was arrived at through tests with approximately 1-inch diameter rubber spheres; while kinetic energy considers only mass and velocity, the form of a projectile strongly also affects its terminal behaviour. For instance, a pellet of U.S. #6 birdshot (a common size used by Indian police, approximately 3mm in diameter) has an approximate mass of 0.126g and a muzzle velocity of 365 m s-1, yielding a kinetic energy at the muzzle of ~8 joules, well below the so-called lethal threshold. However, metal birdshot is universally accepted to be lethal at close range and hazardous to the eyes at longer distances, due in large part to its ability to penetrate tissues even at extreme ranges. “Energy density”–or how much kinetic energy is distributed over impact area–is a more relevant metric for evaluating penetration. Birdshot’s energy of impact is focused on a very small area (birdshot ranges in diameter from <1 to 6 mm), which accounts for its high risk of penetration and accordingly high potential for injury. The ambiguous physical principles behind projectile lethality must be kept in mind when authorities claim a particular CCW is “non-lethal.” This uncertainty can, in some circumstances, allow for exceptionally hazardous weapons to be utilised in crowd control contexts. A more nuanced approach to evaluating lethality would rigorously test factors beyond impact energy, such as energy density, projectile precision, and human factors of use,20 although to date testing that is both comprehensive and publicly available has not proven forthcoming. 19 DO Egner, “Evaluation of Less-Lethal Weapons,” U.S. Army Human Engineering Laboratory Technical Memorandum, 37-77, (December 1977) at p 194, accessible at: https://www.ojp.gov/ncjrs/virtual-library/abstracts/evaluation-less-lethal-weapons. 20 The “SWAPDEC” testing protocol considering speed, weight, accuracy, precision, density of impact energy, effective range, and consistency comes closest to a standard of testing that could effectively anticipate health risks of an impact munition under consideration for use.

While lethal projectiles are constructed to maximise the likelihood of death by penetrating the skin to compromise vital organs, KIPs are ostensibly constructed to minimise penetration while delivering sufficient kinetic energy to produce significant pain and/or incapacitate an individual. A projectile’s impact force and propensity to penetrate depend on a number of factors, foremost among them their cross-sectional area and speed. Small, fast projectiles are more likely to penetrate the skin than large, slow projectiles. Many KIPs are designed to maximise the surface area of presentation to distribute impact force and reduce the probability of skin penetration or to minimise weight so that the projectile will quickly lose speed while in flight. The plasticity of a round, the number of projectiles fired at once, and protocols governing their use will all also affect how a projectile functions. In spite of design efforts to reduce lethality, KIPs can cause serious injury, permanent disability, and death if they hit critical parts of the body with significant force. To avoid potentially lethal uses of KIPs, manufacturers often establish protocols to avoid circumstances in which KIPs could prove fatal. First, as projectile velocity is greatest as soon as it enters ballistic flight (i.e. immediately after a bullet is fired), manufacturers often establish minimum use distances to reduce the impact velocity of KIPs. Complexity arises when considering distance: older projectiles had a reputation for inaccuracy (especially when “bouncefired” off the ground). While ballistic testing of newer designs has shown them to be capable of sufficient precision to keep rounds within the lower third of the body at operational distances, these operational distances can differ between weapons, be unclear in practical terms, and are frequently not maintained.21 Second, manufacturers sometimes issue warnings that KIPs should never be shot at vital parts of the body, such as the head. However, guidelines on targeting parts of the body tend to be contradictory, some saying that the bullets should be aimed in the torso “box” between the clavicles and the hips, others noting that the upper torso should be avoided, and bullets should be aimed towards the lower legs. Given that police departments purchase multiple weapons for use in the same protests, and each weapon can have vastly different instructions, there is frequent confusion and misuse. Use protocols help to mitigate the human hazard of KIPs, although they are by nature imperfect and do not eliminate the objective hazard inherent in ballistic weapons such as KIPs. Minimum engagement distances are often difficult to follow in dynamic, high-stress situations, such as crowd control, which can lead to inadvertent deployment at dangerous ranges. Directives to target specific body parts are heavily contingent upon the training and stress response of users, with the latter having been demonstrated to add 21 I Ndindabahizi et al., “Error Budget of Non-lethal Projectiles Using Stochastic Simulations,” Human Factors and Mechanical Engineering for Defense and Safety 3, (August 2019),a p 10, doi:10.1007/s41314-019-0029-1. 36 Lethal in Disguise 2 - Crowd-control weapons and their impacts: Kinetic impact projectiles significantly to the inaccuracy of KIPs.22 These human factors are exacerbated by the minimum operational ranges imposed to limit the damage caused by KIPs–longer engagement distances make it more difficult to accurately target specific body parts and more likely that projectiles may fly astray. Multiple projectile KIPs Multiple projectile KIPs, which fire more than one projectile per shot, best illustrate the irreconcilable nature of protocols demanding pinpoint accuracy at extended ranges. When fired, these projectiles spread out in a cone from the muzzle of the weapon, resulting in progressively greater imprecision with distance. At longer distances, projectile dispersion renders these projectiles impossible to place precisely, increasing the likelihood that projectiles may accidentally impact other parts of a target’s body or other individuals entirely. This risk is greatly exacerbated by the large number of projectiles in flight with the use of these weapons, which is tens to hundreds of times greater than that of single projectile rounds. The metal pellets described earlier in this section illustrate the danger posed by a failure to understand the interaction among these risk factors. Colloquially known as “birdshot,” these are hunting rounds fired as a single group of tens to hundreds of highvelocity metal spheres. While indisputably lethal at close range, the minimum distance of use (e.g., 50 metres in India)23 is designed to be far enough to ensure that pellets have lost sufficient velocity so as to render them non-lethal. However, even beyond 50 metres, pellet guns have the ballistic capacity to penetrate some organs, such as the eyes, causing blindness.24 The vast number of individuals gravely injured by birdshot used as a CCW is a testament to the regrettable ignorance of the danger posed by any use of these potentially lethal rounds. The use of potentially lethal weapons as KIPs is perhaps unsurprising given that there is little published research on the safety of KIPs. There is an overall lack of transparency by manufacturers and policing organisations regarding the type of safety testing KIPs have undergone and under what conditions. The dozens of weapon types on the market Multiple projectile KIPs, which fire more than one projectile per shot, best illustrate the irreconcilable nature of protocols demanding pinpoint accuracy at extended ranges. 22 J Taverniers and J Suss, “A user-centred assessment of a less-lethal launcher: the case of the FN 303 in a high-pressure setting,” Ergonomics 62, no. 9, (2019), at pp 1162-1174, doi:10.1080/00140139.2019.1626916. 23 ScSaaliq, “Pellets: Lethal or not?” Hindustan Times, (July 28, 2016), accessible at: https://www.hindustantimes.com/static/lethalpellets/. 24 B.

There are examples of penetrating, where the pellet does not enter KIPs being aimed at the upper body or face, the skin or tissue (such as blunt force trauma) being fired from very short distances, being or penetrating (where the pellet does enter used against non-threatening individuals, and in the case of perforating injuries, also and being fired indiscriminately at crowds exits the tissue).

Worldwide reports of calibre and shape), and the characteristics of KIP injuries to critical areas of the body–as the target tissue.26 well as injuries to innocent bystanders–are testaments to this unacceptable risk. KIPs can cause severe injuries through both blunt and penetrating trauma. Blunt trauma directly damages tissue by crushing but can also lead to potentially life-threatening injuries from organ rupture, bone fracture, and internal haemorrhage.

Tissue damage from penetrating and perforating wounds can cause laceration of skin and solid organs, stretching of tissue in the track of the projectile and shockwaves of pressure in the tissue. Penetrating trauma to the brain causes traumatic brain injury, such as skull fractures and intracranial haemorrhage and is often instantly fatal. Piercing the heart or lungs directly compromises the circulation system and the body’s oxygen exchange system, which can result in death within minutes. Severed arteries can also lead to rapid death through exsanguination (bleeding out). Spinal cord or nerve injuries can be permanently debilitating, causing motor and/or sensory deficits. Injuries to other organs may require rapid emergency surgery to avoid fatality, given the risks of internal bleeding, organ damage, and secondary infection (particularly from bowel perforation). Furthermore, the risk of permanent disfigurement or disability is high from both blunt and penetrating trauma, either through compromise of non-vital organs (such as the eyes) or damage to the skin or musculoskeletal system. least 1,245 individuals have likely sustained permanent injuries as a result of KIPs.

This does not necessarily indicate a relative increase in the use of less lethal weapons; rather, the high number of injuries over the past five years could represent an increasing awareness of and interest in documenting the health hazards posed by impact projectiles.
