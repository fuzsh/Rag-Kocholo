        "text": "I–MOSCOW\n\n“I’ve come to dissolve my American citizenship.”\n\nRimma Shirakova loved to speak English. Rusty now, she could say, but she would conduct, if you will, every word of this interview in English, and she could tell the gentlemen who were speaking to her now that back then, for the Soviet people, 1957 had been an exciting year. After much preparation, Moscow had opened at that time a festival to establish human relations between foreigners and Russians in Moscow. It was the greatest event for changing life in the Soviet, she explained. Rimma was twenty in 1957, a student at Moscow Foreign Languages Institute, and she met a number of new people and spoke to foreigners and taught English to children.\n\nFreedom was very great in that year, you see. There were so many young foreigners and young Russians all together. Foreigners heard about it and wanted to come for visits. So Intourist was started to arrange all the work for tours and visas, and Intourist took on many guides, which is how Rimma would say she got into it.\n\nFirst of all, new employees took courses on how to become good at their work. That was connected to studying relevant material that guides should use. For example, Rimma took examinations on how to show their Kremlin Treasury. That was in June of 1959, and those who passed were offered a job in July; most of them were her fellow-students at their Foreign Languages Institute. In September, most of these people, to use King’s English, were sacked. Only those like herself, who showed excellent retention of facts, were accepted for permanent work.\n\nCome autumn and winter of 1959, there were few tourists, but in general through 1959 there had been a good number of Americans, and a big business exhibition came and went in August. Rimma had worked with seventeen “boys.” That was how they introduced themselves: “boys.” They were governors from the Southern states of America, seventeen big boys, all of them with cameras. And Russian people in those days had a picture of Americans never being without their cameras.\n\nOne day in October of 1959, October 16th, Rimma was given the name of a man she was now assigned to take around in Moscow for five days. When she met him, however, she was surprised. He had not only arrived by Deluxe class—but he was taking his whole tour Deluxe. Only rich people travel in such a class. The most wealthy! How many can come alone Deluxe to Moscow for five days? So, she was expecting quite another kind of fellow, some gentleman who would be like an equal maybe to her governors of the Southern states, and they had not even been Deluxe. Only first class. Deluxe was two rooms to yourself, a suite. Naturally, she was expecting a middle-aged man who would be impressive. A dandy!\n\nWhen she went, however, to the assigned section of the Berlin Hotel lobby to meet him, there was only a boy, slender, of medium height, wearing a dark-blue three-quarter autumn overcoat of inexpensive material and military boots with thick soles. Ordinary boots. From her point of view, someone travelling Deluxe should not look like this, certainly not! And this boy was pale, very pale. She would say he looked gloomy and nervous—yes, nervous, very nervous. He wasn’t calm.\n\nShe introduced herself and gave a preview of the program. Intourist had group plans for people on excursions, but now there was only Rimma and this Deluxe boy, who was to have everything private. So she offered him a sightseeing tour. He spoke quietly, but at first it could have been a closed door between them. He didn’t seem to know a single word in Russian, so Rimma spoke to him in English, about obtaining tickets to this or that theatre, and she went down a list of what to tour with him, but he showed no interest in excursions. This first morning, they went with a driver on a sightseeing tour around Moscow, and made stops. Their last one was Red Square, but the initiative for all of one hour and a half had been Rimma’s. He did not interrupt any of her tour stories; he asked no questions. Such an odd Deluxe tourist.\n\nThen their morning tour was over and he returned to the Berlin Hotel and had his midday meal alone. Rimma just said she’d see him a little later. She was planning to take him to the Kremlin that afternoon. There was something about him, something maybe unusual, but he was nice. He was polite and getting more natural. But that afternoon, this first day, he began speaking about himself. They did not go to the Kremlin after all. He wanted to talk.\n\nNaturally, she didn’t go to his suite: she would never do that. It wasn’t allowed. So they went out. It was warm, and they sat on a bench, and he repeated, “If you don’t mind, I don’t want to go on a tour.” Now, this was not against their rules; it was allowed, but it wasn’t considered a good idea.\n\nAnyway, he began to say a few words about himself, that he was from Texas, had served as a U.S. marine, and had decided to go and see this country, Russia. He had read, he told Rimma, that Soviet people lived good, useful, and very peaceful lives.\n\nNow, in those days Rimma was a great patriot, a very great one, she would say, so she was quite sure she agreed with him. She told him, Certainly ours is the best country, and you were right to come. She also felt that he was trying to get closer to her, because she was someone he could exchange information with. Not serious information, just talk about life. She was very enthusiastic that he liked her country, but she had never expected him to speak like this.\n\nHe started talking about how war was very bad because innocent people got killed, and as he talked he became more friendly, and she understood that he wanted to tell her so many things from his point of view.\n\nThen he said that his real idea was that he didn’t want to return to the United States. There was no sense in his going back, he told her. He had already settled that in his mind. He was going to stay here. He gave reasons. To her, they sounded like good ones. He said that his mother had remarried and had another husband, practically had another family, so his mother was not interested in him. Nobody was interested in him there. And when he had served in the Far East he had seen so much suffering, so many deaths, for which he blamed the United States. His country fomented unjust wars, he said, in which he did not want to take part. He gave her an impression that he had actually been in combat, fighting for his country, definitely gave her this impression, and he was sympathetic and believable to her. She thought he was quite right. It was certainly very strange that there was an American like this, but she was sure he was quite right. So she told him she shared his opinion, that there should not be unjust wars—certainly it was unnatural to kill people. He said again he wanted to stay here. This was a proper country from his political point of view.\n\nRimma was surprised. Even shocked. It was not a simple situation. Not routine at all. Nobody in training had ever spoken about something like this. So she helped him to write a letter to Supreme Soviet and she had it delivered. Nobody asked her to; it was her young wish to help him. But later, when she spoke to her boss, a woman, and told this story, her boss was not happy. Her chief said, “What have you done? He came as a tourist. Let him be a tourist.”\n\nRimma was a little upset, because she felt her chief was taking the easiest way. That was bureaucracy. For sure. But Rimma knew her people. In general, most people were slow. They did not want to be energetic. They would say, “My job is not a wolf, it won’t run away into the forest, so why should I hurry?” That was one prevailing attitude. But Rimma was also sure that her chief would get in touch with someone above her and they would know what to do.\n\nFrom Oswald’s diary:\n\nOct. 16\n\nI explain to her [Rimma] I wish to apply for Russian citizenship. She is flabbergasted, but agrees to help. She checks with her boss, main office Intourist, then helps me address a letter to Supreme Soviet asking for citizenship.1\n\nAlexander Simchenko was the boss of the U.S. and Canada desk of OVIR, the Visa and Registration Office, and had about thirty people under him. Decades later, still speaking some English, he would say to the Oswald interviewers, “I can tell you very honestly that everybody at that time who was working for Intourist was under observation and control by our K.G.B. If they asked, ‘What is your impression of So-and-So?’ concerning someone we were taking around, it was not possible to say, ‘I don’t care to speak about it.’ Even if you liked a tourist, you had to give your professional opinion. When some K.G.B. officer would call, he would, to identify himself, give you his first name and patronymic but not his family name. He might say ‘This is Gennady Petrovich. We want to know about So-and-So.’ ”\n\nAlexander, of course, understood. At that time, they were taught that a majority of foreigners are spies. So you had to understand certain requirements of his position. But as far as Alexander can tell, not of a single person on whom he reported could you say that he told something inaccurate. He would tell Gennady Petrovich exactly how he accepted and reacted to each person. He reported verbally.\n\nAlexander had acquired some experience concerning persons from other countries who wanted to apply for Soviet citizenship. Ninety-nine per cent of them were disturbed. He remembered a call from a militiaman in Red Square, who told him, “There’s an American lady distributing leaflets here in front of Lenin’s Tomb,” and he said, “O.K., bring her to my office. Also, bring her leaflets.” Printed in Russian was “Dear Soviet Citizens: Help me to receive Soviet citizenship.” Alexander told her, “You have to apply to our Embassy in Washington for something like this,” and she said, “I did, and they said, ‘Go to Russia, and Intourist will help you.’ ” So Alexander told her that Intourist was responsible only for tourists who were acting like tourists. Others were always told to go back and apply again to the Embassy of the Soviet Union in their own country. When they still insisted on trying to get it done in Russia, his only answer was “Go to the Presidium or the supreme congress,” which Presidium happened to be in an adjoining building, and so they would walk over there, and someone would receive them and say, “Go back to Intourist.” At the Russian Embassy in Washington, they kept saying, “Travel to Moscow on a tourist trip. Intourist will help you.”\n\nOf course, Alexander would often hear from K.G.B. of such cases. Still, he had never met anyone from K.G.B.; it was always a voice on his phone. If it wasn’t Gennady Petrovich, it was someone who would get on and say, “I don’t know you, but Gennady Petrovich recommended I call and speak to you . . .” Then they would proceed. He just listened, and tried to be helpful.\n\nThe first time Alexander came across Lee Harvey Oswald’s name was when he received a call that a young American was trying to receive Soviet citizenship. When Alexander heard his first name was Lee, he thought, “Chinese, maybe he’s Chinese by birth.” But then he thought, “Oswald—that’s not Chinese, not Oswald.” So he wasn’t too surprised when this young person came in. He seemed an average young American.\n\nHe was very cute, he was smiling, a person who tried to be very appealing, and he was, yes, very appealing. Smiling. He came in wearing a short black parka and no hat and a knitted turtleneck sweater, and he was wearing a silver chain with his name on it, and a ring with a stone. He was an unusual case, and Alexander was afraid to speak to him for too long, just talked to him a little and told him nicely to go away. He certainly wasn’t in a mood to call somebody higher up and ask them to help, because they would only say, “Why?”\n\nYears later, for instance, when the president of McDonald’s hamburgers first came to Moscow, he told Alexander he’d like to introduce McDonald’s to all of the Soviet Union, and Alexander made a call to City Council’s catering department, and they said, “What? What you are doing? You want to leave your job? Why are you introducing this?” That was why, in unorthodox cases, Alexander was reluctant to call anybody.\n\nHe did ask Oswald how he received his name Lee, and the young man replied, “Maybe it’s my grandparents’. Maybe it’s Irish.” But then, thinking there might be Spanish in this name Oswald, like Osvaldo, Alexander said, “Habla español?” and Oswald said, “No, no, no, no.” He said he wanted to stay in the Soviet Union because he felt very sympathetic to Alexander’s country; he had read Lenin, Stalin, newspapers, magazines, etc. Alexander thought his knowledge might be superficial; maybe he had read some books, but, still, nothing deep. So Alexander replied, “You know, we’re not able to do anything here.” At that time, it was difficult to extend a tour; everything had to be worked out in advance through a travel agency. Intourist couldn’t sell to you on the spot. Alexander knew many cases where persons wanted to prolong their stay but couldn’t find a way to buy new vouchers for food, entertainment, theatre, ballet, visits, trips, no way to connect at the last minute with an appropriate bureau to get vouchers. Besides, Alexander knew that if a high official were interested in having this tourist Oswald stay on, the high official would begin to take a few steps. Since Lee Oswald had been sent routinely to him, that meant nobody was interested. Alexander took it for granted that K.G.B. knew more about Oswald than Alexander did and that it was not his business.\n\nNext morning, Rimma was asked by this boy, “Do you think I’ll be allowed to stay?” and Rimma told him she didn’t know. “As for me,” she said, “I’ll do everything I can to help you.” She felt much closer to him now. He had become to her like a relative. It wasn’t romantic on her side, although she felt there might be something on his side, because he certainly seemed sure she would only do good for him. He was sweet and natural, and maybe back then when she was young she was a little more coquettish. A little bit. She couldn’t say she liked him very much: he wasn’t her type. Maybe it was a small amount romantic, but certainly they did not kiss each other. She was like a sister to him, you see. He was in such a difficult position in his life; he needed someone. And who was there to rely on but herself? So they were friendly, very friendly, and she was upset also, and uneasy. She had thought official response would be quicker. That there’d be more interest. But nothing happened on this second day.\n\nThe next morning was Sunday, the third day of his visit, and his birthday, October 18th. By his passport she knew he was now twenty, but he looked younger. She gave him a gift. She bought a book by Dostoyevski—“The Idiot”—for him. And they visited Lenin’s Tomb, in Red Square. No special reaction. He was waiting for news, but Sunday had no news. Ditto, Monday. Absence of new information. Still, there were reports to file.\n\nAfter he had told her of his desire to stay, she reported each afternoon to the proper people. It was very important, you see, for his fate. But she was surprised. They did not seem to pay much serious attention to his case.\n\nToday, thinking of herself as a source of information to her superiors concerning Oswald, she wonders what value a young girl could bring who had never had such an experience before. At least, she was sincere. But it’s difficult to say what K.G.B. thought.\n\nSunday and Monday he was saying maybe he could tell them some secret things. He had served in his armed forces and he had something to tell. Rimma went to her boss and reported that Oswald was now prepared to offer matters of interest. He knew about airplanes; he mentioned something about devices. He said he’d like to meet some authorities. Her boss said, “Oh, go and have another tour,” and Rimma had a feeling that maybe people from Internal Security had come around already to take a quiet look at him. Not to talk to him, just to keep a little watch on him.\n\nOn Tuesday night, however, they told her that he wouldn’t be allowed to stay; he would be refused. She could not give him such bad news then. She waited until the next morning, which was the sixth and last day of his visa.\n\nHe was shocked. Very depressed, very tense. She tried to calm him, but now it was as if he were dead. He spent a whole morning with her. So depressed. She did talk him into a trip for that afternoon.\n\nAfter taking her big meal at lunchtime, she waited for him downstairs; usually he was punctual—nine sharp was always nine sharp for him, ditto for 2 P.M. Now, this afternoon they had their car and driver waiting, and it was very difficult with cars; you had to reserve carefully in advance. So by two-thirty she was so worried that she went upstairs to his room without permission.\n\nThe floor lady at the elevator landing said, “He’s still in his room, because I don’t have his key.”\n\nRimma said, “Come with me.” They began knocking. Nobody answered. His door was locked from the inside, and so the floor lady couldn’t put her extra key in. They called someone from Internal Security, and a locksmith from their hotel crew joined them, but the locksmith had difficulty opening the door, and finally pushed it open with such a bang that both men fell into the living room. They saw nobody. Rimma, behind them, saw nothing. Then these two men went on to the left and into Oswald’s bathroom. Rimma doesn’t know where they found him, whether in the tub or on the bathroom floor; she couldn’t see from where she was in the hall, and she did not want to. Then they came out and said, “Get an ambulance.” Rimma went down to call, and, soon after, a policeman told her that he had cut his wrists. He had said “cut his wrists,” but she didn’t know if it was one or two. “Old Italian method,” he said. Rimma was scared certainly, but also glad. From a moral point of view, she thought it was good that she had come in time. When they brought him out on a stretcher she saw that he was dressed. His clothes were dry. He was lying unconscious on this stretcher and she sat next to him in the ambulance. Up front was a man driving, and another fellow who had helped carry his stretcher. She was alone with him in back, and he looked so weak and thin. His cheeks were hollow: his face was bluish. He looked like a person about to die. If he did, there might be a bad situation for her country, a scandal between U.S. and U.S.S.R. Tourists come, and now this one’s dead, so other tourists might be afraid to visit. What with serious distrust between two great nations, Americans might think that Soviet officials had tortured him.\n\nI leave Embassy, elated at the showdown, return to my Hotel. I feel now my energies are not spent in vain. I am sure Russians will accept me after this sign of my faith in them.\n\nNov. 2-15\n\nDays of utter loneliness . . . I remain in my room. I am racked with dysentery.\n\nNow, at the Metropole, Rimma would go up to his room. She could. She had been given new rules, as if it were a new case. She was assigned to taking full care of him. He was no longer a tourist. They took it as something very serious, and so did he. Why were they not solving this problem? He was very nervous. He told her that all his money had gone for his tour Deluxe. He had done it purposely. If he was on a tour alone, more attention would be given to him than in a group, and that way he could fulfill his plan.\n\nRimma’s relationship with Lee became a good deal closer. He was very much like a relative now—but not a brother, not a boyfriend, in between. He wanted to kiss her and was ready to try, but she didn’t want that. She never kissed him at all, not ever. It was considered, as the English would say, not good form to behave like that. People who did could lose their jobs. Of course, for her, as a person, she could certainly kiss him if she wished it that much, but, you see, she did not. Certainly not. She had a boyfriend, a young engineer, graduate of Moscow Power Institute, whom she would see once a week. A loving fellow. Moreover, with Alik it was a situation where it was impossible to be light-minded. The consequences of improper behavior could not be simple. A Russian writer said once, “It’s better to die than to kiss without love,” and good girls were of that same opinion. If she didn’t love him and didn’t want close relations, then she should not kiss. So she patted him on his hand. Enough. Her psychology.\n\nBesides, she had to send reports to her chief and be factual, always factual. So how could she kiss? Was she to report that? She would say Alik was O.K., he wanted to be accepted into their Soviet Union; she tried to give a good impression of him, but factual. Sometimes she wrote her report daily, sometimes weekly; it depended on how much information she received. They didn’t ask her to tell them every day but absolutely when she felt she should. Very difficult days.\n\nNov. 16\n\nA Russian official comes to my room, asks how I am. Notifies me I can remain in USSR until some solution is found with what to do with me. It is comforting news for me.\n\nNow days started to go by and still they didn’t give an answer. Rimma spent every working day with him. Very long intolerable days. He was upset, he didn’t know what to do, and she didn’t even try to teach him to speak Russian a little, because, from a psychological point of view, it was not a time to learn; to her mind, he was in his room too much, thinking and thinking. She didn’t even know whether he was reading her gift—“The Idiot.” Maybe he had been a little shocked at such a title; could wonder if was personal, yes. And maybe Dostoyevski was difficult for him, very difficult. He was interested in nothing but his own fate. Very self-centered.\n\nSometimes he would still say that all people are brothers and sisters, and the Soviets wanted more good for our world than America. But Rimma felt he had come to such ideas without knowing many facts. Very superficial. Not natural. Not deep.\n\nShe never said this to him, however, because it would be too easy to hurt his feelings. He knew that, too. He would never insult her, she knew, because she could say something back that would show him to be a person who thinks too much of himself and shouldn’t behave as he does. You should know the kind of person you are, she was ready to tell him if he got at all unpleasant—you are just nothing.\n\n“What’s my news?” he kept asking her. Always this same question. And she had a feeling that maybe he was going to ask her to marry him. But he didn’t. Maybe he knew she wouldn’t agree. However, he hinted many times, said how good and how happy he felt being with her. When she went to her chief and asked about his situation, one question they would always ask her was “What can he do for a living?” Unfortunately, he could do nothing.\n\nFinally, since he had no money, her boss told Rimma they should move him from his present good room to something smaller. They found such a cubbyhole, very small, very modest. His life was going from Deluxe down. Down and down. Which means up. Higher floor, smaller room.\n\nRimma couldn’t even eat with him. In those days, even if her salary was a hundred rubles a month because of her excellent marks, meals at a hotel were too expensive. She went to reasonable places. Then, because they couldn’t afford to give him restaurant meals at his hotel any longer, higher-ups said, “Special meal.” Poorer quality. Of course, he wasn’t always gloomy. Sometimes he was certainly romantic, and would tell jokes, but mostly she had to try to cheer him up. He would say that if he was allowed to stay in her country he would live in Moscow. Of course, if he married her it would be easier for him to do that. But she never discussed this with him, and didn’t think he was just pretending that he loved her; she thought his feelings were sincere. But he wasn’t sleeping well. He was thinking of his situation. Always. His Russian didn’t get much better, either—no, no.\n\nOne day, finally, late in December of 1959, just before New Year’s, they called Rimma into Intourist’s main office and told her they were sending Oswald to Minsk. When she informed him, he was so disappointed he even cried at first, with tears, yes, he wanted Moscow not Minsk, but he was also happy he was allowed to stay, relieved and happy. Of course he was happy. He was shining. He did not hide it. But he was still upset he had to go to Minsk.\n\nHe had no idea where it was. Had never heard of it. Rimma told him it was a good city, which was true. She often took foreigners to Minsk in a railroad coach on trips. She liked its newest hotel, their Hotel Minsk. People in Minsk, she told him, are much better than in many other places. But he was depressed. He wanted her to accompany him on his all-night railroad trip from Moscow to Minsk, but by now he understood that everything was not so simple as he had thought before everything was more serious than he had thought. In America, when he took this decision to go to Russia, he must have been like a child, but then in these days he grew up, you see. So now he understood that, even if Rimma wanted, she couldn’t leave her job and go with him. He understood it was impossible. He knew it was a very serious place here.\n\nJan. 7\n\nI leave Moscow by train for Minsk, Byelorussia . . . I wrote my brother and mother letters in which I said, “I do not wish to ever contact you again. I am beginning a new life and I don’t want any part of the old.”\n\nRimma remembered that on this day he left for Minsk it was snowing when she said goodbye to him. He was crying and she was crying.\n\nBut she did not write to him. It was understood that an Intourist girl was not to write letters to tourists she had guided, and Rimma could not violate such a principle.\n\nII–MINSK\n\nWhat is the marine from Texas doing here?\n\nHow Igor Ivanovich Guzmin2 looked when young would be hard to decide in 1993, because his presence spoke of what he was now: a retired general from K.G.B. Counterintelligence, a big man and old, with a red complexion and a large face that could have belonged to an Irish police chief in New York, impressive from his sharp nose up, with pale-blue eyes ready to blaze with rectitude, but he looked corrupt from the mouth down—he kept a spare tire around his chin, a bloated police chief’s neck.\n\nGuzmin, Igor Ivanovich, born in 1922, had worked in Minsk for the K.G.B. from 1946 to 1977, and had first been dispatched there by Moscow Center to undertake a “strengthening of cadres,” and in Minsk he had remained for more than half of his fifty years in service. Having walked in as Deputy Chief of Counterintelligence, Minsk, he became Deputy Chief of Branch, and was finally promoted to Chief of Department in Byelorussia. While his arrival came more than a year after the Nazi occupation of Minsk had ended, he could inform his interviewers that one out of every four persons in that republic had died in combat, or in German concentration camps, or under other circumstances. He said no more. His point was that rebuilding had been done in Minsk under difficult conditions. There was not only physical disruption but a population compromised by collaboration. Certainly all standing policemen, local army, village headmen—the persons installed by Germans—had to be seen as collaborators or Fascist agents. His State Security office had, therefore, to cleanse everything that you could call an obstruction to reconstruction. Many people didn’t want to take responsibility for their collaborative actions with the Nazis and so had gone underground, which gave the Organs a further task of freeing society from their concealed presence. It was a good deal of work. They weren’t finished dealing with all of that until 1953.\n\nAt 11 o’clock Lee Harvey left Hotel Minsk and went to GUM. There he came up to electrical department, asked a salesperson some question, then took money out of his pocket and went to a cashier of this department. He did not pay for anything but just put money back into his pocket and started pacing first floor of department store up and down looking at different goods. Then he went back to electrical department, paid 2 rubles, 15 kopecks for electrical plug, put it into his pocket and went up to second floor. There he spent some time in department of ready-made clothes, looked through available suits, then left GUM store walking fast. He was back at his hotel by 11:25.\n\nAt 12:45 he came out of his hotel room and went to restaurant. He took seat at vacant table and began to eat. (No observations were made during this meal, because no other people were in there.)\n\nAt 13:35 Lee Harvey left restaurant and went back to his room.\n\nAt 18:10 he left his room and went to restaurant. He took vacant table, had his meal, left restaurant at 18:45, and took elevator to fourth floor where he went to his room.\n\nHe did not leave his room up to 24:00 after which time no observation was made until morning.\n\nFrom K.G.B. Chronology:\n\n13.01.60 In accordance with order No. 6 (12.01.60) Oswald was taken on as regulator, 1st grade, in experimental shop at Minsk radio plant.\n\nAccording to Igor Ivanovich, K.G.B. had done nothing directly about choosing Oswald’s place of work or where he would live. Such matters were overseen by the Council of Ministers. So the Organs were not even consulted. It was policy. No matter how people might work at placing him, a hint of their efforts could still reach Oswald and spoil their case. Now, however, that he had been given a job as a fitter-trainee at Gorizont (Horizon) and was able to use radio equipment and communication devices, it could be said that it did not hurt their purposes. If he was a specially trained agent, it would be possible to observe in a factory environment what level of expertise he had in handling radio equipment under different conditions. At that time, Horizon factory in Minsk was not under high security—at least, not in Oswald’s shop. However, this radio factory did, at times, coöperate with secret Soviet organizations, so it would be possible to observe whether Oswald made attempts to penetrate into such special networks.\n\nIt was a large factory, occupying perhaps as much as a quarter of a mile by an eighth of a mile, and inside its gates was a sprawl of streets, sheds, and three- and four-story factory buildings that had gone up in different years—a multitude of buildings, alleys, vans, trucks, and company streets not unreminiscent of an old-fashioned and somewhat run-down movie studio.\n\nJan. 13-16\n\nI work as a “checker,’’ metalworker; pay, 700 rubles a month, work very easy. I am learning Russian quickly. Now everyone is very friendly and kind. I meet many young Russian workers my own age. They have varied personalities. All wish to know about me, even offer to hold a mass meeting so I can [speak]. I refuse politely.\n\nBy her early twenties, Katya had worked at the Horizon radio plant for six years. Born on a collective farm, she still didn’t feel like a city girl. So she was very quiet, but still she was pretty, if very slim and very shy, and she never spoke to Oswald, just observed him. Now she’s heavier, a mother, and braver, but she was timid then. Year after year, she had worked hard, wearing Horizon’s white gown and a kerchief for her hair so it didn’t get into any apparatus, the gown and kerchief both provided by the factory. When Alik came down her aisle, he didn’t surprise Katya, just a young guy who looked like her own people, nothing special.\n\nExcept one matter. This American complained always that he was cold. In their shop it was warm, but he said he always felt cold outside. People laughed at him when he talked. His Russian was so bad people laughed, not mocking, but friendly. He would try to pronounce words, get them wrong. They would laugh.\n\nThe work of Stepan Vasilyevich on Oswald was always studied critically by Igor. A developer could fail to see something in time, so Igor could not be satisfied only with what Stepan reported, but looked to give specific directions.\n\nIgor did want to point out that he had a large number of other matters to oversee, and so it is important to understand that while he kept watch on each project, each developer had to live in his case, accumulate every fact, make evaluations, and then come up with proposals for action that would develop his viewpoint. Stepan, therefore, was leading the case.\n\n“Now, of course mistakes were made,” Igor said. “Sometimes our actions were not commenced in time, and some of Oswald’s actions were not prevented; nothing, obviously, can be perfect.”\n\nOne early instance—and it still stands out in Igor’s memory—is that Stepan did not take steps to screen Oswald away from one eighteen-year-old at the radio factory who happened to be the only son of an Air Force general who was also a twice-decorated Hero of the Soviet Union, a very high award. But his son, Pavel, was considered to be of “dissident nature.” So they were afraid of what a qualified agent could do with young Golovachev—maybe even recruit him over to Western thinking.\n\nLibezin, the big man in charge of proper ideological environment, came walking down Pavel’s aisle and said, “Anyone here speak a little English?” Pavel happened to be the one who did. He was not asking for it, he could have said that he did not know English, but he nodded. Libezin took him to meet Oswald at his worktable, and there they were, shaking hands.\n\nPavel had studied English from fifth to tenth grade and, of course, it wasn’t much. His first reaction to Oswald was that he looked like an extraterrestrial who had all of a sudden ended up in their factory. “Well,” said Pavel to himself, “if it is not an angel, it is a man. That will be proved by time, but there is nothing repellent about him.”\n\nBesides, in that period, Khrushchev had started a campaign for peace and friendship. Society was opening up. You had to keep in mind the specifics of that time. So there was Pavel, on the second day after this introduction, standing with a pocket dictionary, and Lee Oswald next to him with another dictionary. Of course, not knowing that their association would be important someday, Pavel did not keep notes. But then, for many years after, he wanted to forget all of it, the whole goddam thing, you understand? He really did not keep it in his memory. Now he doesn’t remember too much, and he doesn’t want to make up stories. He could spin a tale about how he and Lee Oswald went to pick up girls, but that was not the case.\n\nIt was more like he took Oswald around the shop and helped him communicate with other workers when a job had to be explained. At first, however, this American’s vocabulary was minimal. Pavel had to explain a word like “falling” by taking a box of matches and dropping it from his hand.\n\nA few workers were hostile to Oswald, but just a few. There was one, Viktor, a zhlob, medium-sized guy, real strong. And Viktor always used to say, “Those American imperialists—if I had a machine gun, I would shoot them.” A real zhlob. Viktor had a clear image of his enemy, and he once picked a fight with Lee, although it was broken up immediately. Pavel’s recollection is that Lee was not pugnacious. Maybe he had such qualities hidden inside him, but he was not very big in the bones.\n\nOf course, if Viktor had gone further, Pavel would have gotten in between. It was the very least he could do. While he would not call Oswald a “friend,” it is only because that word in Russian is so holy that not only can you give up your last shirt but you are ready to die for a friend. If you think in this way, obviously you don’t have a lot of friends. In fact, you are lucky to have one. All others are “pals.” In that sense, Lee was his pal. Maybe more, but still not his friend.\n\nOne night that winter, not two weeks after he met Lee, a stranger came up to Pavel on his way home from work. There, right outside his apartment entrance, this stranger showed an identification card from K.G.B.\n\nPavel said, “Can we go up to my apartment and talk? It’s winter.”\n\nThe stranger said, “Let’s talk here.”\n\nIt was too cold, however. Pavel was frozen. So he persuaded the man to come upstairs.\n\nThey conversed in Pavel’s room. His visitor took out about five pictures, and started off by saying, “Do you know this fellow?” He went through each one of the five pictures, and Pavel said, “No. I don’t know any of them. Who are they?” And received for a reply: “They are state criminals.” At which point, his visitor looked at him hard, as if maybe he really did know them well.\n\nPavel said, “I don’t want you to waste your time. I have never met these men in my life. It’s strange you ask me these questions.”\n\nThen the man from K.G.B. brought out a photograph of Oswald and said, “You know, you took on a relationship with this American guy so easily, but we would like to tell you that your Motherland now asks that you give us some information so that we know what kind of person he is. We need your help.” Pavel didn’t feel anything like a patriot, but knew for sure they would get coöperation. It was a demand. People senior to himself became nervous if they saw a K.G.B. card in a man’s hand. It was not that Pavel felt any kind of obligation to his Motherland; he was eighteen, and scared to death. That was, Pavel would say, a strong substitute for obligation: being scared to death.\n\nPavel never looked at a clock during this interview, but it must have taken almost an hour. A lot of questions went by. The K.G.B. man kept going around and around for quite a while before he touched their main subject. Then he explained, “Oswald is from another country, a hostile country.” It could not be more clear what he was saying. He must have been twice as old as Pavel, short, compact, sharp eyes—one Byelorussian who didn’t show any feelings or emotions, just a small trim fellow with a smooth round face, a long thin pointed nose, and small dark eyes as sharp as his nose. He would depend on that nose. It seemed to sniff out everything inexact that Pavel was saying.\n\nWhen Ella was growing up, she liked to dance waltzes, but then her favorite soon became the foxtrot. She did hear of this American bandleader, Glenn Miller, and then saw Mr. Miller and his orchestra in a film called, in Russia, “Serenade of Sunny Valley” (which might also translate into “Sun Valley Serenade”). She remembers that one U.S. film she liked was “Twelve Angry Men,” because she was able to compare the judicial systems in both countries. After that, she no longer trusted what she was being told about America—that rich people were only a small group and most people were poor. She remembers that people in those days would whisper that even the unemployed in America had a level of life equal to Russians who were working. On the other hand, she did believe that the United States government could start a war.\n\nBy the time she met Lee, she was already twenty-three and had dated many young men. She would go out with someone a couple of times but then realize she didn’t feel anything toward this person, so why continue? On the other hand, it was boring to sit home. Sometimes she would even go out on a date without any feeling that it could be the right man for her.\n\nWhen she came in on her first morning, she remembers being introduced to Lee. All that week he kept looking at her during lunch break. She knew that if she went up to him and asked for a favor, he would like that even if lots of girls wanted to be his friend. She noticed that when he would walk along the factory aisles many girls would cry, “Hello, Alik, hi!” as if he were of special importance.\n\nNow, in her night-school classes she was working on some English text and had to translate a number of pages by a certain date, so it was not wholly a pretext to get him to help her. There was some real need. While this would not characterize her in a positive fashion, she would say, she sometimes did use men to do small things for her. For instance, there was an engineer she did not like particularly, but she was not good at drawing certain kinds of wiring schemes, so she asked him to help, even though she had no intention of dating him. For Lee, however, she did not have negative feelings. Since the American seemed to find her attractive, why not ask him to help translate her assignment? In fact, when she did ask, he smiled, and they agreed to meet in a smaller workroom that afternoon. She assumed there wouldn’t be anyone else there, although, as it turned out, a few workers were still present. She and Lee sat down at a small table where a radio was playing music.\n\nLee spread out her pages and turned off the sound without asking whether anyone wanted to listen. But Max Prokhorchik was also working there, and he became indignant. He came up and turned the radio back on. Lee turned it off; Max turned it on. Then Lee turned it off, and said, “Russian pig!” Whereupon Max stalked off.\n\nIt was unpleasant for Ella. In front of several people, Lee had turned off their radio just because she had to study, but, on the other hand, a well-brought-up person would have done exactly what Lee did. At that moment, Ella could say that she was on Lee’s side. All the same, he did not seem too bright at first. His Russian was poor and he took everything as a joke. He laughed a lot. So they laughed a lot, too much maybe. Yet as she saw more of him it became interesting to talk about his country.\n\nBefore long, he was inviting her to see movies. They went often for walks and to parks and sat on a bench. He would tease her, “You know, I am a rich bridegroom. I have an apartment.”\n\nIt was exceptional to be dating an American, and she was curious. Besides, he did not create problems. He was not aggressive. That was understood as their basis for going out together. Some men had been nasty, but he wasn’t. And, of course, he didn’t have financial problems; he even hinted to her that he had high connections. He had met the chairman of the City Council, Sharapov. “If we need something,” Lee said, “for our future, I can go to the mayor. We can get what we need.” So Lee did seem a confident person to her, and merry. He had a sense of humor and they still kept laughing a lot. In those days, friends used to call her khokhotushka, a person who enjoys life, and so she and Lee did not have difficult or deep conversations, just talked like young people. She liked to tease him. Not in a bad sense, just to challenge him a little.\n\nDuring all this time, they dated approximately twice a week, but had lunch together at their cafeteria every day. And they usually sat alone; other people respected their privacy and did not try to join their table.\n\nShe never felt, Oh, I wish we’d go out with other people. She liked being alone with him. It was her way of dating. She had always had such relations with men. So she hardly knew anything about his friends or who else he saw.\n\nShe believes that Lee knew she was Jewish, maybe from their very first meeting, but she remembers that he only mentioned it once. That was when he realized she was not exactly jumping into marriage with him. Such a question never got to yes or no for many months, but he did tell her, “I know you are Jewish and people, you know, don’t like Jewish people, but I myself don’t care about that.” It was his way of saying, “It wouldn’t stop me from marrying you.”\n\nBefore Lee, a few men had already proposed. There had been one she liked, a captain, who went off to do his service in Kamchatka, but Ella felt indecisive and didn’t go with him; and there had been a boyfriend she dated for a year, and he, too, had asked her to marry him. So Lee was hardly first in this kind of relationship, and, besides, if Lee was in love with her, she was not in love with him. Rather, she felt it was all right to have nice feelings for someone in a good way, feeling that he was, underneath everything, very lonely here. And so she pitied him enough to feel that if she rejected him he would be even lonelier. Therefore, she didn’t stop dating him. But she knew she didn’t like him in such a way that one goes on to get married.\n\nLee told Ella once that she knew more about him than any other person ever had, and so she was surprised when she found out years later that he had a mother still living—he had told her he didn’t. Also, he told her that he never wanted to go back to America.\n\nOnce, after they first started going out, he was quite upset. It was when news came to Minsk that an American U-2 had been shot down over Soviet territory, and its pilot, Francis Gary Powers, had been captured. Lee asked her, “What do you think, Ella? Can it damage me because I’m American?” She told him not to worry personally, because “no one can say you are responsible.” She tried to calm him down and talked to him nicely. She wasn’t really sure, but she did want to support him. It was their most emotional moment yet.\n\nLee told Ella that when he lived in Moscow he was afraid of Americans more than Russians. In fact, he told her, the Soviet authorities had sent him to Minsk because he would be safe there. He even said, “Here in Minsk I’m invisible. But when I came to Moscow I was really outstanding.” Americans had been very interested in him, he told her, and had been hunting him and wanted to kill him. She thought maybe he had offered some information to obtain a Soviet citizenship, information Americans didn’t want given out. He said, “If I go back to America, they’ll kill me.”\n\nIt made him more interesting, but she didn’t believe it was real. She just thought they were passing remarks.\n\nThey chatted about many matters. But there were also moments on summer evenings when they just sat on a bench and enjoyed a silence as if he were a Russian man. She felt he reacted to everything with understanding, but was very reserved. Even though they dated for many months, maybe eight months, it was still too short a period for her to comprehend his nature. He never showed much. He was always even, kindhearted, smiling, nice, without ups or downs. Only twice, in fact, did they have a quarrel. Of course, she was also easygoing. People even said to her, “You laugh so quickly. If I show you my finger, you start to laugh. So easy you are.”\n\nIt is possible she did laugh too easily. When she read his diary all these thirty and more years later, she could not believe how distorted was his sense of time.4 He had had them meeting after the summer of 1960 when, in fact, they had known each other back in May of 1960, when the American U-2 was shot down, and they talked about Gary Powers. How little she had known of Lee, and how little, obviously, he had known of her.\n\nWhen he learned that Pavel knew a lot about shortwave radios, he asked if Pavel could make him one. With local radios, you only received Soviet news. Pavel told him he could put together such an apparatus, but it wouldn’t look nice—all of its parts would be exposed—so Oswald then laid out his money and bought himself a shortwave radio that looked as pretty as a lady’s purse. It had only two frequencies, high and medium, but on MF, 257 metres, the Voice of America was transmitted. Since it was all in English, they didn’t even bother to jam it.\n\nPeople talked about Oswald as if he might be a spy, but Pavel remembers Lee Oswald coming to him with a simple Soviet camera and he wasn’t able to put film into it. Pavel had to show him how. Once, Oswald bought a radio set and tried to insert its batteries, but even in trying to do that much he ripped a few wires loose. To take another example, Oswald liked to listen to the Voice of America, but he didn’t know how to make adjustments for it on his radio set so that it came in clearer. Pavel, using a penknife, had to play with one part and move it a little in order for Lee to be able to listen. Pavel assumed that if Oswald were James Bond he would have arrived in the Soviet Union able to take care of such small details.\n\nFrom K.G.B. Chronology:\n\n4.IX.60 Oswald saw “The Wind” in Letny movie house.\n\n4.IX.60 Oswald visited a party for youth in Officers’ House.\n\n6.IX.60 Oswald saw “Babetta Is Going to War” in Mir movie house.\n\n7.IX.60 Oswald saw “A Partisan’s Spark” in Pobeda movie house.\n\n8.IX.60 Oswald saw “Babetta Is Going to War” for second time in Mir movie house.\n\n9.IX.60 Oswald saw “The Commander of the Detachment” in Letny movie house.\n\nFrom September 4th to September 9th, he saw four movies, one of them twice, and all but one were war movies. He had bought a single-barrel shotgun in August, and joined a hunting club organized by Horizon. But it was not until September 10th, filled by now, one may assume, with images of himself as a participant in war movies, that he finally went out with the hunting club.\n\nBy now, Stepan had given his team of observers a code name for Oswald. It was Likhoi. That sounded like Lee Harvey, but the word meant valiant, or dashing. It was K.G.B. humor. Likhoi never seemed to do anything but go to work, walk around, and shop.\n\nBut later he began to discuss serious matters. For example, he didn’t want to live in Minsk. It was, he said, a provincial city. He had lived in New Orleans; that was big. He asked her to share a dream. He said, “Maybe I will move to another socialist country. For example, Czechoslovakia.” He said, “Shall we go to live in Prague?”\n\nHe was a very proud man. He didn’t want to be rejected by Ella. She believes that’s why he never asked directly. He would say, “How do you do things here? In America, we have an engagement ring, a silver ring that’s exchanged for a golden ring. But how do you do it here?” Perhaps he was waiting for her to ask, “Why are you interested in how marriages are made in Russia?” but he never said directly, “I would like you to be my wife.”\n\nOne time, he showed his Russian residence papers, and he said, “Soon I have to make a decision. You’re the one who’s going to influence it. Do you want to live in Prague? Because if you do, then I won’t take Soviet citizenship. But if you want to live here, tell me if you want that, and I’ll take it—this all depends on you.” And in December he showed her that his papers terminated on January 4th, next year, just a few weeks away. He had to make a decision what to do with his life before 1961 was four days old.\n\nBut that was a big question for her: Why had he come here, and why did he now want to move? He told her, “You don’t understand. In our country, we travel, we change places—you don’t understand.” But she didn’t trust him. Besides, Lee was not really to her taste. She liked men with bigger shoulders.\n\nWhen he kissed her, he was not unpleasant—he was nice. But because Ella was not in love with him she was not excited. All the same, he never scared her as a man. In that aspect, he was perfect. He was so tender. She was never scared. Yet all those months she went with him, from May to January, she did not trust him. Some people told her that he was an American spy. And she thought, Maybe he wants to marry me so he can stay in this country. When he says he loves me, he doesn’t love me at all.\n\nShe never thought to herself, Maybe I’ll go to Prague and it’ll work. Or, if it doesn’t work, I’ll get a divorce. For Ella, marriage was something you did for life. You loved a person and you trusted him. Because if you didn’t, how could you go to a new world?\n\nFinally, he became very pushy. He said, “You have to make up your mind if you’re going to marry me,” and when she asked for time to think it over he said, “No, I have to decide by January 4th.” That made her feel more mistrustful. She told him, “I like you, too, but I need time to think.” She was not a person to offend people who were nice to her.\n\nThey had a quarrel, however, concerning New Year’s Eve. He had invited her to a party for that night, and so she turned down an invitation that came to her for another gathering. Then, at the very last moment, he told her that his evening was not going to take place. Now they were without anywhere to go that night for New Year’s Eve.\n\nThere was an expression, razbitoye koryto. It meant they were ready to eat but had only a broken plate. Ella got very angry that they didn’t have a proper situation; she said, “You let me down.” Now he, too, became agitated. Finally, he said, “You are playing a game with our situation. Oh, you are an actress!” It was equal to saying that her emotions were not sincere. They walked away from one another.\n\nSince Ella wasn’t going to any party now, she began to help her mother. Some of their family was coming over for a small New Year’s Eve party, so they cleaned house and cooked, and then, as was common in Russia, they napped for a little while around 8 p.m. in order to be able to stay up all night. At 11 p.m., guests would begin to come, but on this night, at a little after nine, she heard their doorbell ring. She was sleepy when she opened her door. Lee was standing there wearing that Russian hat she had never liked, but he was proud of it, and was standing up straight with his hands behind his back. He said, “You know, Ella, Christmas is one of our dearest holidays in America, and your New Year’s is like our Christmas. That’s why I came to you. This is one day when I feel very lonely and I come to you.” He added, “We have a tradition in America; we usually bring gifts,” and he gave her a big box of chocolates decorated with a little candy statuette. She took his gift and said, “Wait a second. I want to put this away.” She went in to her mother and said, “My boyfriend from America brought me this gift. Can we invite him?” Her mother said, “Yes, of course.”\n\nWhen she finally got to this hospital—such a long trip by streetcar—he was glad to see her. He hadn’t expected a visit. What a low opinion he must have had of her! But he was so happy she had brought him canned apricots. He told her it was his favorite dessert. Intuition must have let her know.\n\nIt was sad, however. He did look ill and his smile was pale. Physically, she couldn’t say she liked him now. A little later during that visit, he kissed her (after asking permission), and she didn’t take to this first kiss, either. There was negative feeling. Like a warning to stop. Stop right there. She asked herself, “Do I want this to continue?” She had never thought of it before, but that first kiss could tell you a lot. Did she really want to know him more? Maybe no. Yet her mind remained curious. And he was so gentle. She remembers that his kiss wasn’t just a peck, thank you for coming—no, it showed expectations. But he didn’t smell like a Russian. He didn’t even smell like he was in the hospital. His skin had some funny odor. There could be a lot of scents on top, but underneath was some basic scent. Kissing him gave her that negative response. He did not smell like fresh air and sunshine.\n\nLater, she would come to accept this scent of his body. Still there, but she accepted it. If you love a man, you accept.\n\nIt was funny. After work, every day she would go to visit him. She could get in when no one else could. Visiting days were Sundays only, but she was wearing her white uniform from the pharmacy at Third Clinical Hospital, where she worked—so no problem.\n\nShe did not love him yet, but she certainly felt sorry for him. He was so alone. She could understand that. Loneliness is an everyday companion to a lot of people, but it is certainly not your good companion. And Valya was so sorry for him.\n\nWhile he was still in the hospital, he told Marina that he wanted to be engaged to her and she should not see anyone else. “I promised, but I did not take this seriously.” She did not love Lee—not yet. She just felt sorry for him. Still, he was an American. You weren’t going to say no if an American said you should be engaged; not right away, in any case.\n\nOn the day he got out of Fourth Clinical Hospital, Valya had him over for dinner with Valya’s husband, her Uncle Ilya, a lieutenant colonel in the Ministry of Internal Affairs—the M.V.D.\n\nShe liked how Alik could handle himself with her uncle. Very dignified. He told Ilya he had come to live forever in Russia. He intended to work hard. Ilya said, Well, if that was so, then he, Ilya, would be ready to help him organize his life. And Marina could see that Valya was thinking, yes, they could have a little guidance over him, because Alik didn’t have anyone in Minsk, and they would treat him well.\n\nHe charmed Valya. He was very tender. He kissed Valya after dinner and said, “Thank you, this meal was great.” Well, it was, but he also said it nicely.\n\nAfter dinner, Ilya said, “Take care of this girl. She has plenty of breezes in her brain.” Wasn’t that awful? She was a serious person. She would have liked to have breezes in her brain—she certainly wanted to have fun—but she was always feeling responsible, or examining her conscience. She could never say, “Just wash it off!”—she never did. Maybe, from Ilya’s point of view, it was because she liked one guy this week, another guy the following week; but Marina would have told him, “I’m still looking. I meet somebody, and he’s an idiot. He takes me out to dinner and wants me to pay for it. Or, he’s always clearing his throat because he’s an opera singer. All evening long, that’s what my opera singer did.” Yes, she had known one; she had gone on a date with him. “He had a nice cashmere coat and scarf.” When they went to a restaurant that he chose, she thought, Well, maybe he’ll show some culture here. But he ate his dinner and said, “I forgot my wallet.” Then he said, “Pay for it. I’ll give you some tickets for my opera.” When she got to that, he turned out to be Soldier 29, back somewhere in the chorus—a real Enrico Caruso! Of course, she had to drop him.\n\nNo, she did not want to talk about her courtship with Alik. It was not that remarkable. All courtships are the same: Put your best foot forward. The trouble with courtship is that you never know the other person until you get married and live the first twenty-four hours with him.\n\nStill, she was ready to talk to others about this courtship with Alik. And her girlfriends, especially Larissa, encouraged Marina. As Larissa saw it, this American boyfriend would distinguish Marina from other girls. Besides, he had an apartment. When Alik invited Marina to visit his place on the night after his dinner at Ilya and Valya’s, Marina came with some friends. Safety in numbers. But Larissa talked about him positively afterward. He had such good manners.\n\nSasha Piskalev, a medical student who was in love with Marina and wanted to marry her, recalls that night at Alik’s place because it was so painful to him. The American lived in a grand building, but his apartment did not look cozy. It was what they call kazyonno; that is, bureaucratic, lacking in home atmosphere.\n\nFor their wedding, Valya had prepared a feast: crab salad, salami, black caviar, red caviar, pâté. And then she had stuffed a fish with its own cooked meat, kept the skin whole and put all the fish meat back inside, but now no bones. Not one. It looked like a real fish again. And yet you could slice it. Such a special effort.\n\nMarina had already begged her aunt not to go through any Russian tradition of saying “Gorko, gorko.” But as they sat around their table eating, somebody pretended to be choking on too much pepper, and so everybody started crying out, “Gorko”—which means bitter—and Marina turned red. In obedience to such custom, they now made her kiss Lee over and over every time somebody said, “Gorko.” Later, she danced with everyone, and then Alik and a couple of friends sang “Chattanooga Choo Choo.” That night, when they went back to his apartment, they discovered that Valya and Larissa had placed flowers all around their bed. Her nightgown was on a pillow. Next morning, Valya walked right into their apartment and dropped a plate on the floor with enough noise to wake up ghosts. Then she said to Alik, “Russian custom.”\n\nThey didn’t have a honeymoon. They just spent two days in bed getting accustomed to each other—what would you want her to tell? They were new. They couldn’t analyze everything. Talk a little, observe a little—bit by bit you go on; you don’t make any big issue. Little by little. When you read romantic books, it’s not enough; you want more. But sex was not romance. More like soiled clothes.\n\nOne thing: Lee was not bashful. He could walk around their apartment naked. As if it were nothing. That was surprising to her—that a man could be so comfortable before he got dressed. But she never said anything about it. For Minsk, however, he was some exhibitionist. She had just never experienced this American way. Lee was not even embarrassed to get up and go to the bathroom while leaving the door open. That was unusual. Marina was trying to find out what was expected of her. She did not know what her man wanted, so she had to learn.\n\nGuys at Lee’s factory, she soon found out, were always talking about sex. Quite a big topic over there. That was why Marina never wanted to date factory boys—their mentality. When Alik would laugh at what they said, she would say, “Don’t tell them about our lovemaking. Don’t you dare.”\n\nAlik’s first experience with sex had not only been with a Japanese girl, but he also said that he’d never had an American girl. Just Japanese and Russian girls. Marina wondered whether he felt that he was missing something. Maybe he should have had a girl from his own country first? No, Marina didn’t know what to expect during these first few days of marriage. She could say that she kind of lived in euphoria. Finally married, you know! And she had married an American. She had that stupid apartment she’d always dreamed about. God was smiling on her. Finally!\n\nMay 1, 1961\n\nFound us thinking about our future. Despite the fact I married Marina to hurt Ella, I found myself in love with Marina.\n\nMaybe a week after their marriage, Aunt Valya said, “Let me see your pampered, manicured hand,” and all Marina could show were Polish fingers: her nails were broken from cleaning stone walls on her balcony and washing their floor. For that one moment, she had said to herself, “Is this what married life is about? Broken nails? Oh my God!”\n\nBut for the first couple of days, since that was all they had off from their jobs and couldn’t have a honeymoon, they would stay in bed and not get up until late afternoon. A honeymoon was sexual; you explored. Marina felt as if now she was free to do what she wanted to do. She didn’t think about their problems in sex, and she didn’t want to talk about that, really. You expected fireworks, and it didn’t happen, and you thought maybe it’s supposed to come later. It never did. That was all right. But she didn’t know if what little was happening to her was all that was supposed to happen, and so in bed everything was a problem. She didn’t know what to do, and Lee was always eager-beaver. Later on, when Marina was tired or in a bad mood, she didn’t avoid him, just told him, “No, I don’t want to make love to you, because I feel used one more time. What for? Something there for you, maybe, but nothing for me.” Even if that was kind of insulting to him, he would try to handle it. “Come on,” he would say, “you know I love you.” He would play that he was a little boy and make jokes. Sometimes she would give in. She thinks he really liked sex, but she resents talking about it. “Nobody asks Jacqueline Kennedy what Jack Kennedy was like in bed.” And here she has to discuss such private things as what it was like to have a person inside you. There is nothing dirty about sex unless you let people watch—then it’s degrading. But she would say that no matter what their difficulties, people ask if Lee was a homosexual and she would say she never had any sense with Lee that he’d be partial to a man, never. Maybe he could be gay somewhere else, but not around her.\n\nLee liked to stand in front of his mirror and admire himself, that was true. “How unbashful he was,” Marina said. “He would admire himself. He was not tall, but he was well proportioned. He had beautiful legs. And he knew I liked them, so he would flirt. ‘Don’t you think I have gorgeous legs?’ he would say. Just begging for compliments. Kind of a joking relationship. Private, but of the sort people do have.” Her understanding: he really liked women. That was her interpretation.\n\nWhen Marina was told how Lee went for months without trying to seduce Ella, never forcing her, she asked if it was possible that Ella was embarrassed to talk. “You know, ‘I’m holier right now than I was then,’ know what I mean?” And then she thought, “Maybe he liked her so well that if she didn’t want him that bad he wouldn’t push.”\n\nLee did tell her, and with a lot of admiration, about that beautiful Japanese girl who had been the first woman he knew. Marina was left with an image of a lovely Oriental blossom whom Lee still longed for. It made her jealous. Of course. There in his mind was a lovely woman. Was that to influence her? So that she would pay more attention to all kinds of sex? And learn new ways? She wanted to compete when Lee—always with great admiration—described all the sexual things this Japanese girl did to him, this unknown beauty.\n\nThey wanted her to be pregnant right away. For the first month, nothing happened, and Lee and Valya were equally disappointed. Valya even said, “We were hoping you would have a child, but you’re probably going to be like your uncle, won’t be able to.” Said it after one month! Lee wanted to have a boy. He was going to call him David. Their boy, he assured Marina, would someday be President of the United States. And then, whenever Marina would go to the bathroom, at least when her period was approaching, he wouldn’t let her shut that door. He wanted to know for sure whether she was having a period. When she asked him why he didn’t trust her, Alik said, “Well, you work in a hospital. If you don’t want to have a child, you could have an abortion. So I want to know.” It didn’t hurt her feelings; she wanted a child, too. She thought he was being stupid, but she brushed it off. She even said, “Well, leave the door open”—took it like a joke. She said, “Lee, I want a child as much as you. I’m not going to do anything foolish.” So it was not such a big deal. It wasn’t like he stood there and said, “You must peepee in front of me”—no, it was more gentle. After all, late spring had come, and her mood was “I’m going to have a child and I’m going to have a family right here,” and she wanted them to be as young and happy as they could be.\n\nDuring the first weeks of their marriage, Lee would meet her at the pharmacy entrance and walk her home, and when evening came he would go out on their balcony and look at sights far off with his binoculars. At night, he would wash the breakfast dishes, and on days when they had hot water he would do their laundry. When Marina would climb up their entryway from Kalinin Street, she could hear him singing “Volga Boatmen” from four flights down. He wouldn’t be one for a choir, but he could sing with zest. A pleasant voice. And he was washing his own work clothes. He just didn’t want her near his dirty things.\n\nShe soon learned that he didn’t enjoy his job. He claimed that they resented him and his privileges. But she didn’t know how true it might be. Lee played with people. That she soon learned. Maybe he even played with her.\n\nA few weeks after they were married, some letters arrived from America and in one was a picture of Marguerite Oswald. She was in a white nursing outfit, just sitting in a chair. “That’s my mother,” he told Marina. He studied the picture and said, “She’s gained some weight. As I remember her, she wasn’t that plump.” That was it. Marina said, “You told me your mother was dead.” He said, “Well, I don’t want to talk about my mother.”\n\nShe did not know how to accept that. He had said he was an orphan. Now she thought to herself, “Stupid me! There I was believing late at night that it was a sign and God sent me an orphan like myself.”\n\nJune\n\nA continuance of May except that we draw closer and closer and I think very little now of Ella . . .\n\nSometimes she would get a glimpse—if only for a little while—of what was in him. Then he would lift his shield again. He was embarrassed to show vulnerability. Only in intimate moments could he be himself, this little boy who wanted attention. Then he would pretend that he didn’t need anything. “He would isolate himself,” Marina said, “and play games with people. Treat them like they were not people.”\n\nOnce, on a day when everyone was supposed to vote for some Presidium or something, election workers started knocking on their door at 7 a.m. Lee told them to go away—it was too early. They came back again, and Lee wouldn’t open up. He kept yelling, “This is a free country.” He gave them lectures while they stood outside. She doesn’t remember whether she went to vote, but Lee kept telling her that the Soviet constitution said it was a free country. They were not supposed to drag you out to vote. So she received a speech on politics early that day. Of course, she had never studied that stupid Soviet constitution. That is, she had studied, had even passed her exam, but now she couldn’t recall any of it. So he had to teach her about her own system, and told her how they were not practicing their constitution properly.\n\nTwenty months of the realities of life in the Soviet Union have clearly had a maturing effect on Oswald. He stated frankly that he had learned a hard lesson the hard way and that he had been completely relieved of his illusions about the Soviet Union at the same time that he acquired a new understanding and appreciation of the United States and the meaning of freedom. Much of the arrogance and bravado which characterized him on his first visit to the Embassy appears to have left him . . .\n\nFrom Oswald’s diary:\n\nJuly 9\n\nReceive passport, call Marina to Moscow also.\n\nJuly 14\n\nI and Marina return to Minsk.\n\nFrom K.G.B.

Stepan underlined those speeches he considered pertinent to his needs, whereas any comments that appear in italics as stage directions were made by the K.G.B. transcriber. That worthy was making his [or her] observations through a peephole in a rented room adjacent to the Oswalds’ apartment.)\n\nFor Object: OLH-2658\n\nFor Period: 17 July 1961\n\nLHO: I can’t tell you what to do.

She wasn’t able to buy food he would like. For instance, Alik would say, “I want to have corn,” and any corn they grew around there was for livestock. So she said to Misha Smolsky, “Let’s say we have cultural difficulties.”\n\nFrom K.G.B. Transcripts:\n\nFor Object: OLH-2658\n\nFor Period: 21 July 1961\n\nLHO: Well, why are you crying? (Pause.)

(Radio drowns out conversation.)\n\nWhen Marina’s friend Inessa met Lee Oswald, he seemed not exactly unfriendly but very suspicious about things. They exchanged a few words and then he sat down in a chair and became completely occupied with some comic books his brother had sent him from America. Inessa spent her time chatting with Marina.\n\nAfter a few more visits, however, Alik’s suspicions began fading away. Before long, Inessa was eating with them in their kitchen. Indeed, she even liked it that he hadn’t become open right away but had waited and observed. She thinks she probably wouldn’t have believed him if, immediately, he had been too friendly. In fact, she liked him as a husband for Marina. He did all the man’s work around their apartment without needing reminders. Which is not too often true of Russian men.\n\nWhat she wasn’t so comfortable with was that all of a sudden he would announce what he liked about the Soviet Union and what he didn’t like, and he would do it in the open—never whispering. And there were other little things. She really couldn’t say that she approved of him entirely, even if they were only small things. He would carry on if dinner wasn’t cooked on time, and in her opinion Marina didn’t fit his American standards of what a wife should be. When they had fights, Inessa saw them as children, one more stubborn than the other. She liked them both and was comfortable with both, and—maybe she was just lucky—in her presence they never had any really big arguments. She does remember that Marina would get irritated when Alik would read his American comic books and begin to laugh loudly. On the other hand, Marina thought he was too pedantic and told Inessa that she was dissatisfied with his mind.\n\nHe also had bad habits. Like a worker or a crude soldier. He was always spoiling the air with gases. That was shocking, and he did it as naturally as drinking water.\n\nAll the same, Inessa always felt that Alik was more calm than Marina. Outside of those gases, he was very organized. He liked perfection in everything, and Marina used to complain about this trait. Taken all together, Inessa never really thought that Marina was deeply in love with him. She thinks Alik loved her more.\n\nFrom K.G.B.

But Pavel would rather say that he wasn’t prepared for Marina. He didn’t even meet her until the wedding, and then he didn’t take to her at first.\n\nMaybe Pavel saw her twenty times altogether, and he looked at her as a friend’s wife, nothing more. Whatever she was as a woman did not interest him. He had no hate for her; he just looked at her as a sheet for his friend’s bed. That was an expression he had learned at Horizon. His factory, maybe because there were so many Jews in it, was considered to be the most humorous plant in Minsk. Certainly tractor factories and military factories were nothing like that, but then Jews who wanted to work in such places couldn’t get in.\n\nPavel never saw Lee become very angry with Marina, but Oswald didn’t like it at all when his new wife lit a cigarette. So whenever Pavel and Marina were out on the balcony together, Pavel used to hold one in his hand for her. That was to make it look as if Pavel were smoking, not her. He could say she inhaled as lightly and delicately as a yogi.\n\nSoon after Lee and Marina were married, Pavel was getting ready to visit his parents in Khabarovsk, and Stepan had a meeting with him. “Tell Oswald,” Stepan said, “that your father works on big deals as Air Force general. See if he will be interested.”\n\nThe next time, when Stepan asked for Oswald’s response, Pavel said, “He just didn’t react at all.”\n\nOswald had, in fact, ignored Pavel’s remark, but Marina said, “Oh! Why are you saying that to him?” And Pavel knew then that she understood a game was being played and that Pavel was a cog. He didn’t know if she was very quick or whether this news about his father had just been more interesting to her than to Lee.\n\nAll the same, Pavel would say that he was not an active informant for the Organs. He never gave a written report, he never signed anything, and he did his best to be minimal with his Organ bosses when he did have to report. Pavel even told Lee not to talk too much with anyone. Then he added, “I’m telling you this, but other people might not.” He couldn’t allow himself to get more specific than that.\n\nThe interviewers could not find out when Lee’s apartment had first been wired. The earliest transcripts they would receive from the K.G.B. were dated mid-July, which was just after Oswald returned from his trip to the American Embassy. The question, however, remained open. Had Oswald’s apartment been bugged in early March of 1960, prior to his moving in, or at some other period before July, 1961? It is also possible, since the daily labor consequent upon bugging was an expensive item in their budget, that the local K.G.B., having close human sources in place, did not install equipment until those four days in July when both Oswald and his wife were in Moscow.\n\nIn conversations with the interviewers, Igor did say that after Likhoi was married it became crucial to learn all they could about Marina’s character. Was she a type of person to obtain secrets from her uncle and pass them on to Oswald?\n\nWhen installing a bug, the Organs would often rent a room in an apartment above or next door to their target. That was usually not too difficult, since people always had rooms for rent in a larger apartment. In Oswald’s case, conversations were transcribed from a chamber above his apartment, and, later, such equipment was moved to a room next door. If the Organs had been able to rent an entire apartment above Lee’s rather than a single room, they would have bugged the bathroom, kitchen, and balcony—all three. But they did not have that kind of access.\n\nAs for being able to observe people visually, that was no longer difficult by 1961. An imperceptible hole was made and a special lens inserted, a most useful tool thirty years ago—an early use of fibre optics. At that time, it was their “greatest weapon,” because it provided a good deal of information.\n\nFor example, knowledge started to come in to Igor and Stepan that Marina had a low opinion of Lee as a partner. Still, their relationship was interesting. They got married and now they were going to have a child. Was their reason love, or was it Oswald’s desire for better cover? This was one question Counterintelligence had to determine. If, in the course of going back to his native country, Oswald all of a sudden divorced his family and left without them, that would put the Organs on guard. Was it that he had completed his work and was now running away? But no—this man wanted his wife to go with him. That caused many suppositions to fall away. Studying the character of Oswald’s marriage reduced anxieties for Igor and Stepan.\n\nFrom K.G.B. Transcripts:\n\nFor Period: 26 July 1961\n\n9:50 p.m. (LHO goes into the kitchen; comes back.)\n\n10:10 p.m. (They go to bed.)\n\n10:15 p.m. (Intimate conversation.)\n\n10:30 p.m. (Quiet; they are sleeping.)\n\n11:00 p.m. (Surveillance ends.)\n\nStepan was asked if it was K.G.B. policy to discontinue bugging at 11 p.m., since people usually went to bed then. He replied that this type of measure could be conducted around the clock or for only a few hours. A matter of operative expediency.\n\nNor was there a set policy about recording intimate moments. Usually, a K.G.B. transcriber would state that such an action had occurred, but would not give details. It goes without saying that each developer had the major responsibility for such decisions. It depended on what he was looking to analyze. Stepan, for one, preferred to avoid this sort of thing. “But assume I am C.I.A. or F.B.I. and I am trying to recruit a Soviet engineer. I would have to look for compromising materials on him, first and foremost sexual things. Working as an analyst on such a case, I give this order: ‘Take down everything in the most detailed manner possible. All sexual processes. Take photographs. So on.’ Everything depends on which goal is being pursued.”\n\nIn Lee Harvey Oswald’s case, sexual details were not necessary. “If he and Marina said something of interest, let our transcriber take it down; but if Oswald and Marina are just making love, a person listening or looking through our device would write no more than ‘intimate, tender moments.’ ” In fact, Stepan did not relish these personal occasions. Why irritate higher-ups who have to read it? But if something said is significant, well, his transcribers wouldn’t miss that—it goes without saying. If, for example, subjects start, during lovemaking, to speak about important matters, that would be mentioned. Stepan recalls nothing significant, however, being noted during Oswald’s case.\n\nAlik and Marina were sure the Organs were bugging them. “Yeah,” says Marina now, thinking about it. “We’d become like two kids. Nothing or nobody is going to stop us. I was his ally all the way through. Just for the damn principle of it.” Once, when all lights were off in their apartment, they examined their electricity meter with a flashlight. The needle was still moving. That was when Lee said, “They bug our apartment.” Maybe he was just playing some game with her, making it dramatic. But if they wanted to talk, they did go out to their balcony or turned on their radio. Especially so they wouldn’t jeopardize any persons they were talking about. Still, it did not become part of her life. If she wanted to talk to Lee, she did not always go out on that balcony. Because, really, there was nothing to hide. The most horrible thing, you would expect, was that maybe somebody was recording them in bed. Yet, and it sounds stupid, they weren’t all that concerned about it—isn’t that funny? But if they wanted to discuss something about their upcoming trip to America, they would go out to the balcony. Maybe she was just blocking out everything about this “intimacy part,” but as she remembers she didn’t mind all that much if someone was listening. Maybe it was because they didn’t make love as frequently in those months of pregnancy.\n\nPavel knew that Lee’s apartment was wired. He couldn’t say exactly how he knew; probably it was intuition reinforced by experience. Stepan, after all, knew certain things about Lee he could have learned only by such methods, and hints of such knowledge came out when he met with Pavel to give instructions on what questions to ask next. So Oswald’s apartment had to be bugged.\n\nNot his balcony, however. Pavel calculated that it would be difficult to disguise a microphone out on a naked balcony. Moreover, cars would be passing, and there would be wind and interference from birds. From detective stories, you would have believed that the Organs had enough technology to put a miniature microphone in a button on a shirt, but that is very expensive.\n\nAll the same, they were always there. Or so it felt. Pavel, when talking to Lee, would not allow himself to get curious. He didn’t want to gain any information he would have to divulge or else not be serving his Motherland.\n\nWhen speaking to the interviewers, Stepan always put his emphasis on the more efficient aspects of security activities. He did not dwell on lapses. Whatever impediments might hinder good transcription were not going to be discussed by him. After a review of those particular transcripts that the K.G.B. did provide, it is, however, hard to suppose that we are in the presence of advanced technology. As was often indicated by the transcriber, the sound was poor and Oswald’s radio was usually on. Indeed, he often had to yell above it for Marina to hear. Since it was summer, there were frequent visits to their balcony, and from there nothing could be heard, while the sounds of running water are what is picked up most often from the kitchen.\n\nAdd to this that there might be unprofessional fatigue visiting that K.G.B. auditor in the next room—even periods, conceivably, of dozing off—and one is left for the most part with a portrait of two young married people who argue with each other so fiercely and (for all we can make out) so pointlessly that an impulse arises to compose a one-act play: “Newlyweds.”\n\nInterviewer: Did you ever fight over washing the floors?\n\nMarina: No.\n\nInterviewer: Would he ever complain about the floors?\n\nMarina: I don’t remember . . . but I don’t think so.\n\nInterviewer: Did you ever argue about cleaning the house?\n\nMarina: We probably argued about even the cats scratching the roof.\n\nFrom K.G.B.

I suppose you want me to wash floors every day?\n\nLHO: Yes, wash these floors every day . . .\n\nWife: You don’t do anything and I’m supposed to spend all day cleaning up. A decent man would help. Remember you used to say: I’ll help! You did wash once, and now you talk about it endlessly, and I wash our clothes every time and it doesn’t count for anything . . .\n\nLHO: You have to make something to eat!\n\nWife (yells): I can’t. I’m not going to cook.\n\nLHO: You could make cutlets, put on water for tea. I mean, I bought everything, everything.\n\nWife: I won’t.\n\nLHO: You haven’t done anything.\n\nWife: Well, what have you done for me?\n\nLHO: Silence!\n\nWife: I’m not going to live with you . . .\n\nLHO: Thank God!\n\nWife: Take a look at yourself. A tidy man! You’re twenty times dirtier than I am. Look at your pillow; you sleep on it once and it’s already dirty.\n\nLHO: You never do anything!\n\nWife: That’s right, I just carouse. I carouse with my health.\n\nLHO: You don’t do anything.\n\nWife: You have cleaned up this apartment just once, and I’ve done it twenty-one times. You’ll do it once and then talk about it all day.\n\nLHO: This house has to be cleaned every day. There’s dirt in our kitchen, dirt everywhere. What good is that? You sleep until ten in the morning and you don’t do anything. You could be cleaning up during that time.\n\nWife: I need my sleep. If you don’t like it, you can go to your America.\n\nLHO (calmly): Please, thank you.\n\nWife: You’re always finding fault . . .\n\nLHO: You’re ridiculous.

I’m not your housekeeper. Give me proper conditions . . .\n\nLHO: Don’t cry. I’m just saying that you don’t want to do anything.\n\nWife: So?

If you don’t like it, you can go to your America.\n\nLHO: I’ve told you for a long time that you don’t do anything.\n\nWife: I wash floors every day.\n\nLHO: It’s dirty.\n\nWife: What’s dirty to you is clean to me. I washed floors yesterday and you walk around in shoes.\n\nLHO: There’s dirt and dust because you open our balcony doors.\n\nWife (yells): It was closed all day. You don’t understand anything.\n\nLHO: Don’t cry . . .\n\nWife: Don’t you see that I dust each morning?\n\nLHO: You don’t clean up over there on our table.\n\nWife: Yeah, yeah, I dirty it up.

At times like this you could kill me.

No tenderness, nothing. If it weren’t for your being pregnant . . . (Doesn’t finish his sentence.) I can’t yell at you in the presence of other people, but you’re always saying things about me around other people . . . And then you tell fairy tales about how I’m going away, how I’m leaving you, that everything’s my fault. But even so I want you to be with me. I understand that you are the way you are and that you can’t be any different than you are. (Pause.) Why do you make yourself out to be so wronged? The most wretched girl in the world!

Don’t let her get lost in history.”\n\nSometimes Marina would wonder if Lee thought it would be harder for Americans to arrest him if he came home with a wife and a child. Maybe his mother had told him to bring his Russian along. Since his mother wrote letters to him in English, how could Marina know? She would apologize to Americans, but she did not really like their language. It was much less beautiful to her than Russian.\n\nIn the later months of her pregnancy, Lee became careful. The American baby book said, Don’t make love once a certain month is reached—now she can’t remember which month. And Lee was protective, very protective of their unborn baby, and tender, very tender; he measured her stomach and he petted it.\n\nShe wasn’t showing anything for a long time. Just a little belly. Once, he asked, “Are you sure you’re pregnant?” He was afraid their baby might be too small. But he was excited when he heard the heartbeat for the first time—a nice quiet moment. He loved to lay his ear on her stomach and listen.\n\nAll through their marriage, she would say, little by little, maybe their sex got better. Only one thing she would never allow: “What do you call it?—when people kiss feet—fetish?” She never heard about anything like that until she read of it. She would never allow men that, but Lee was not perverted in such a way. He was nice. When her feet felt wooden in the last months of pregnancy, Lee would massage them. And later he was very kind about a few stretch marks she had after June was born. He would look at their baby and say, “Your mama did all this for you,” and he would stroke those stretch marks and kiss them. But, of course, they were never that bad. She never got that big.\n\nNow, at night, in their small apartment, as winter came on, he would write in a notebook. Since they were going to America, he had started a new journal, and for a couple of nights he wrote so much that she finally asked him if he was a spy. Up to then, she had tried to respect his privacy. She didn’t believe that marriage was a place where you have to smother each other. People must have their own lives. But she was curious. So she asked him what he was writing, and he told her it was his memories of Russian life. She said, “Are you sure you’re not a spy?” He said, “What if I were?” He stared at her. He said, “What would you do if I am?” She really didn’t know. She started thinking about it. When he saw how worried she looked, he said, “Don’t worry. I was joking. I’m not a spy.” So she trusted him. Still, she could see how he might be a spy. Who could love the Soviet Union? She didn’t. No admiration there at all. Why, she even smoked Belomorkanal cigarettes. Her private protest. She could explain: Belomorski Canal had been built by political prisoners, whose bones were buried in the canal banks, and later, when they named a cigarette Belomor, people saw it as a symbolic memento of all the bones that were buried during Stalin’s period. “A great economic achievement—so many bones were buried there. Our system was such that you have to read between the lines. People knew what was happening even if they could not tell. We felt solidarity with people buried near Belomorski Canal. Even now, people won’t switch, even now. Belomor is not just a cigarette. If you buy it, you’re saying, ‘Thank you, brother. You died. I’m with you.’ So Russians laugh when they smoke Belomor. They say, ‘My God, everything built in Russia is on the bones, you know?’ ”\n\nAt Horizon, Katya, working down the aisle from Alik, had come to notice that he was becoming less and less of a worker. More and more often, he would sit with his feet on the table. When there was no table, he would put his feet on a chair. His fellow-workers decided it was American culture.\n\nThey would say to him, “Alik, why do you come here and go to sleep? It’s still morning.” He would answer, “I made love a lot. That’s why I’m sleeping now.”\n\n“Maybe he said it in joking,” Katya said. “But it was not important for me.”\n\nStep by step, people stopped being curious about him. Once or twice, after Alik was called into the office for a reprimand, he would come back to his worktable and say, “I am going to write my memoirs—‘How I Remember the Soviet Union.’ ”\n\nNobody reacted. Everybody thought, What is he going to write if he can’t even speak properly? It was best to keep some distance from him. How could you know what is in his mind?\n\nAfter Marina filled out every paper, every one of so many needed for her to go to America, and all those weeks went by, and then all those months from August to December, a phone call came to her at last, when she was at work. Marina was told to go over to the main government building on Lenin Street, where M.V.D. and K.G.B. were housed.\n\nShe came in from a side street and walked downstairs. There was only one man in the room; he “was gray-headed, he was authority.” He was tall, but she doesn’t remember his face. Just that he was in uniform. Nor does she recall whether he called her Marina or Mrs. Oswald; but he did say, “I’m here to talk to you about your "
