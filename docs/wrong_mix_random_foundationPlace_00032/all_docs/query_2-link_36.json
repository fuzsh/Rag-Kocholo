        "text": "The EUâs response to COVID-19\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 2021, following one of the most challenging years in its history, the European Union began to look to the future by launching its recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe EU redoubled its efforts to scale up vaccine production and to support Member States and partner countries as they sought to speed up vaccination. Action taken early in 2020 through the EU Vaccines Strategy â investing in several different vaccines â proved successful. This resulted in the widespread availability of vaccines in 2021, despite a slower-than-expected start due to initial problems with the production and supply of one of them.\n\nFollowing large-scale vaccination in Member States, on 31 August 2021 the EU reached the crucial milestone of having vaccinated at least 70 % of the EU adult population. By the end of the year, the share had risen to 79.8 %. As a resurgence of the pandemic swept through Europe and the world towards the end of the year, stemming the spread of the virus remained a key priority. The Commission put forward a common and coordinated EU approach to address the challenge in all Member States â several of which reintroduced restrictions â while continuing the effort to increase vaccination coverage and starting to deploy booster jabs.\n\nDuring the year, the European Commission worked with Member States to enhance their testing and tracing capacities and to implement whole-genome sequencing (which has proved crucial with the spread of the Omicron variant). The Commission also continued to invest in research and innovation for new and improved vaccines and treatments for COVID-19. The EU Digital COVID Certificate, launched in July, made it easier for people to travel safely around Europe and further afield. One billion certificates had been issued by the end of 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU mobilised to deliver Europeâs unprecedented recovery plan. The EUâs long-term budget (â¬1 211 billion), coupled with NextGenerationEU, the temporary instrument designed to boost the recovery (â¬800 billion), is the largest stimulus package ever financed by the EU, totalling more than â¬2 trillion. In response, Member States drew up national recovery and resilience plans, setting out investments and reforms to address the impact of the pandemic and accelerate the green and digital transitions. The Recovery and Resilience Facility at the heart of NextGenerationEU will provide â¬723.8 billion in grants and loans to support Member Statesâ reforms and investments. By the end of the year, the Commission had positively assessed 22 national plans worth more than â¬445 billion in funding, which were approved by the Council of the European Union. The Commission disbursed â¬54.3 billion in pre-financing under the Recovery and Resilience Facility to 20 Member States, and made a first payment of â¬10 billion to Spain. While the speed of the recovery may vary across the EU, all Member States are expected to see their economies return to pre-crisis levels by early 2023.\n\nBuilding on the early lessons learnt from the pandemic, the first European Health Union proposals focused on crisis preparedness. When adopted, these will equip the EU with the means to better prevent and address future pandemics and other cross-border health threats, and to improve the resilience of health systems. The launch in September of the new Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) was a major step forward in helping protect the health of people in the EU, completing the European Health Union. (See Chapter 4 for more information.)\n\nThe EU also worked to strengthen international cooperation against the pandemic, including through the G20+ Global Health Summit, held in Rome, Italy, in May, and the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator (ACT-A) initiative, which aims to speed up the development and production of and equitable access to COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines. The Global Health Summit adopted the Rome Declaration, setting out common principles to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and to prevent and prepare for future pandemics. The Commission, Member States and financial institutions, in particular the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, acting together as Team Europe, stepped up funding for and action on other continents. By 4 January 2022, Team Europe had shared 380 million doses of vaccines with partner countries, 255.4 million of which had already been delivered, mostly through COVAX (the ACT-A vaccine pillar). The overall target is to share 700 million doses by mid 2022.\n\nExtending the crisis response\n\nIn 2021, the European Union continued and extended its efforts to deal with the impact of the crisis, with more than 2 326 measures to provide support adopted in total since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThe unprecedented activation of the general escape clause of the Stability and Growth Pact, allowing Member States to deviate temporarily from the strict budgetary rules, continued to apply in 2021, allowing them to provide strong fiscal support. During the year, the Commission continued to use the full flexibility of State-aid rules as part of its policy response in support of an economy severely impacted by the effects of the pandemic. Between the start of the pandemic and the end of 2021 it adopted more than 730 decisions, approving nearly 900 national measures notified by the Member States, for a total funding amount of â¬3.17 trillion. In the course of 2021, the focus gradually shifted from the urgent need to keep ailing businesses afloat to facilitating a quick, robust and sustained recovery. The sixth amendment to the State Aid Temporary Framework, adopted in November 2021, reflects this shift, enabling an EU-wide coordinated phase-out of support while envisaging measures to accelerate the recovery. Thanks to these more flexible rules, and their constant fine-tuning as the crisis moves towards recovery, the Commission helped Member States to contain the impact of the economic downturn of the pandemic, preserve a properly functioning and competitive Single Market and pave the way for recovery.\n\nEmergency support and assistance\n\nMember States have been able to rely on the EU budget to help them deal with the many health consequences of the pandemic. In 2021, a wide range of health initiatives were funded through the Emergency Support Instrument, which is financed through the EU budget, including securing vaccines through advance purchase agreements with vaccine manufacturers.\n\nIn January, the Commission announced the 24 projects selected to create new programmes, or expand existing ones, to collect plasma from donors who have recovered from COVID-19. The EU also made an additional â¬65 million available from its budget in 2021 to purchase personal protective equipment and medicines, train healthcare professionals in intensive-care skills and test people in difficult-to-reach areas. It also mobilised an additional â¬100 million to directly purchase over 20 million rapid antigen tests, which were delivered to 25 Member States from February onwards.\n\nOverall, the EU Civil Protection Mechanism has helped deliver more than 30 million vaccine doses and over 200 million items of medical equipment to EU Member States and other countries since the start of the pandemic. In 2021, the EU also mobilised emergency medical teams to Romania and Slovakia in the EU, and further afield to Guinea, Papua New Guinea and Tunisia. The EU further developed the strategic rescEU medical stockpile in close cooperation with Member States, and funded the purchase of additional personal protective equipment, intensive care units and oxygen concentrators. Through rescEU, the EU managed to plug the gap of 6 million COVID-19-related emergency medical items in Latvia and Romania in the EU, and Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia in the Western Balkans. It delivered more than 3.4 million protective masks, 2.5 million pairs of gloves, 150 000 gowns and other items of personal protective equipment, such as face shields, goggles and foot protection. During the year, the Humanitarian Air Bridge continued to deliver support, including essential medical supplies, to some of the worldâs most vulnerable communities.\n\nSome 305 disinfection robots were delivered to hospitals across the Member States. Up to â¬12 million was made available to purchase the robots, which can disinfect standard patient rooms using ultraviolet light in just 15 minutes.\n\nThe EU provided â¬43 million to Member States for the production of EU Digital COVID Certificates, and an additional â¬7 million for the revocation of false certificates. â¬2.5 million was mobilised to develop the European Digital Passenger Locator Form application to facilitate contact tracing when travellers are exposed to an infectious disease during their travel. A total of â¬220 million was also made available in 2020 and 2021 to finance the transport of COVID-19-vaccination-related equipment and treatments, and to support the transfer of patients and the deployment of medical teams.\n\nTesting for and tracking COVID-19\n\nIn January, the Commission set out the key elements of comprehensive testing strategies to be considered for national, regional or local testing approaches, such as their scope, priority groups, testing capacities and resources, and indications as to when rapid antigen testing may be appropriate. The Commission called on Member States to increase genome sequencing, and provided â¬110 million in support through the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. To delay the spread of emerging variants of concern, the centre recommended that Member States put the required capacities in place that would allow them to sequence a total number of samples that would detect a variant of concern at a prevalence level of 1 %.\n\nIn March, the Commission adopted a recommendation to track COVID-19 through wastewater monitoring. It asks the Member States to put in place wastewater surveillance systems and ensure that relevant data is provided promptly to the competent health authorities.\n\nSupporting jobs and protecting livelihoods\n\nThe Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency (SURE) initiative, set up in 2020 to protect jobs and support families affected by the pandemic, has been an important part of the EUâs response to the COVID-19 crisis. Under the initiative, the Commission borrowed â¬89.64 billion between October 2020 and May 2021, which it provided in loans to 19 Member States. A further â¬4.62 billion in already approved support should be raised and disbursed in 2022. Other Member States can submit requests to receive support under SURE, which can still provide almost â¬6 billion in financial assistance.\n\nBetween 1.5 million and 2.5 million firms have benefited from SURE, allowing them to retain workers.\n\nIt is estimated that Member States have saved more than â¬8 billion in interest payments by using SURE instead of issuing sovereign debt themselves.\n\nA report published by the Commission in September on the impact of the scheme confirms its success in cushioning the impact of the crisis through financial assistance for short-time work schemes and measures for the self-employed. In 2020, SURE supported 31 million people â 22.5 million employees and 8.5 million self-employed people. This represents more than one quarter of the total number of people employed in the 19 beneficiary Member States.\n\nThe EU is committed to helping Member States maintain and create jobs for a fair, inclusive and resilient recovery from the COVID-19 crisis. In March, the Commissionâs recommendation on effective active support to employment provided guidance to Member States on active labour-market policies. It aims to address the challenges triggered by the pandemic, bridge the skill shortages that are holding up economic growth during the recovery and help every individual to successfully navigate the green and digital transitions. The goal is to move gradually from emergency measures taken to preserve jobs during the pandemic to new measures for a job-rich recovery.\n\nIn August, the Commission took action to support farmers affected by the pandemic and adverse weather conditions, enabling them to receive higher advance payments under the Common Agricultural Policy. The Commission also supported the agri-food sector through increased flexibility and specific market measures that targeted the wine, fruit and vegetable sectors.\n\nTo ensure the safe resumption of activities in the cultural and creative sectors, in June 2021 the Commission published EU guidelines to provide a coordinated approach in line with the specific national, regional and local conditions. In November, it published an online guide to EU funding for culture , covering around 20 existing EU programmes that Member States and the sector can access to apply for funding.\n\nEU Vaccines Strategy\n\nThe European Union has successfully built, together with the Member States, a broad and diversified portfolio of billions of doses of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19, from multiple manufacturers. By the end of 2021, five of the eight vaccine contracts had delivered safe and effective vaccines, while two more may still do so and one contract had been abandoned. The EU Vaccines Strategy had resulted in deliveries to Member States of nearly 1 billion doses by then, with as many doses exported to other parts of the world.\n\nThe groundwork in the early days of the pandemic led to the delivery of hundreds of millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines following the approval and authorisation of the first vaccine, developed by BioNTech/Pfizer, at the end of 2020.\n\nIn 2021, the Commission granted a further four conditional marketing authorisations for the vaccines developed by Moderna, AstraZeneca, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Novavax, following the European Medicines Agencyâs (EMA) positive assessment of their safety and efficacy. Several other vaccines are at different stages of assessment by the agency. Following the withdrawal of CureVacâs vaccine from the EMAâs rolling review process on 11 October, the contract with CureVac was abandoned, and it is no longer part of the EU vaccine portfolio.\n\nThe scientific evaluation by the EMA of the vaccines being produced by Valneva and Sanofi was still ongoing at the end of 2021. Should the EMA give a vaccine a positive scientific opinion for a conditional marketing authorisation by the Commission,then these vaccines will also be available to Member States.\n\nSince mid 2020, the Commission has thus secured the right to buy up to 4.2 billion vaccine doses through advance purchase agreements and purchase agreements. In return, the Commission financed part of the upfront costs using the Emergency Support Instrument. This funding, following an open invitation to vaccine developers, was considered a down payment on the vaccines that Member States purchase under the advance purchase agreements. The portfolio consists of promising vaccines selected by the Commission, where manufacturers have received funding for the development up front as the Commission intends to purchase doses once the vaccine has been approved by the EMA.\n\nWhile production and delivery in the first quarter of the year had been expected to be relatively low, this was exacerbated by the failure of one company to deliver in line with its contract. In February, the Commission set up a task force with the aim of helping to ramp up the production capacity for vaccines in the EU â acting as a one-stop shop for manufacturers in need of support â and to identify and address bottlenecks in production capacity and supply chains. The Commission also supported Member States in rolling out vaccines by preparing them for large-scale vaccination â from cold-chain infrastructure that ensures vaccines are stored at the correct temperature to defining priority groups for vaccination and communication efforts.\n\nThe COVID-19 vaccination state of play at the beginning of 2022\n\n981 million\n\ndoses delivered\n\n79.8 %\n\nof the EU adult population\n\nfully vaccinated\n\nSource: Vaccine producers and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control data.\n\nFrom April 2021 onwards, deliveries to the EU increased considerably, as expected. By mid July, over 1 billion vaccine doses had been produced in the EU, with 500 million vaccines delivered to Member States â enough to reach the goal of vaccinating 70 % of adults by the end of the summer. This target was reached by 31 August 2021.\n\nFollowing a resurgence of the virus in autumn 2021, and with the Omicron variant circulating at the end of the year, Member States redoubled their efforts to limit its transmission, including by reintroducing measures such as social distancing and international travel restrictions, and through their national vaccination programmes. The European Commission worked with Member States and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to find a coordinated approach to these matters. The Commission has also worked with Member States to increase vaccination uptake by addressing vaccine hesitancy, misinformation and disinformation.\n\nThe rate of vaccination continued to increase throughout 2021, with the EMA recommending a number of vaccines to adolescents and to children over the age of 5. By the end of the year, all of the Member States had started offering additional doses to medically vulnerable groups, and booster doses to the general population.\n\nDeveloping treatments for COVID-19\n\nOvercoming the pandemic will require more than just vaccines. Even with increasing vaccination rates, measures such as wearing face masks and social distancing often remained necessary in 2021. COVID-19 treatments are needed to avoid or reduce hospitalisations, speed up recovery and save lives. In May, the Commission proposed an EU Strategy on COVID-19 Therapeutics, which aims to support the development and availability of much-needed treatments, including for 'long COVID'. It complements the EU Vaccines Strategy and builds on both the Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe and the Commissionâs cooperation with the EMA to support the research, development, manufacturing and deployment of treatments.\n\nIn October, the Commission established a portfolio of the 10 most promising COVID-19 therapeutics. The list was based on the screening of 82 therapeutic candidates in late-stage clinical development by a group of independent scientific experts. These therapeutics cover different product categories addressing different stages and severities of the disease, and will reach patients across the EU as fast as possible, provided their safety and effectiveness is confirmed by the EMA.\n\nBy the end of 2021, the Commission had authorised five treatments from the list for use in the EU, following their evaluation by the EMA. The monoclonal antibodies Ronapreve, Xevudy and Regkirona were authorised for those in the early stages of the disease, while two medicines already on the market â the immunomodulators RoActerma and Kineret â were authorised for hospitalised COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe Commission is supporting Member States in having access to therapeutics, and has concluded two joint procurement contracts for the purchase of monoclonal antibodies. Negotiations are also ongoing for some other products that are under assessment by the EMA.\n\nThe Commission has invested â¬119 million under Horizon 2020 to support 45 research and innovation projects on therapeutics and treatment options for COVID-19, including via the European Innovation Council and the Innovative Medicines Initiative. The Commission is currently supporting three clinical trials â the REMAP-CAP, Discovery and EU-SolidAct trials â which have delivered significant results on treatments in development.\n\nTackling new variants\n\nNew variants, some of which are more transmissible than others, have added to the complexity and challenges of the pandemic. HERA brought together researchers, biotech companies, manufacturers and public authorities in the EU and globally to prepare for new variants. While the first generation of vaccines approved in the EU proved largely effective against early variants, future variants may prove more resistant to vaccines. This requires constant vigilance against and monitoring of COVID-19 mutations. HERA provides this shield against such future potential variants, along with incentives to develop new and adapted vaccines, speed up the approval process for such vaccines and scale up manufacturing capacities.\n\nIn June, the Commission adopted a decision to set up a European expert group on SARS-CoV-2 variants, which brings together leading scientists in the field of COVID-19. This group has been instrumental in reviewing data about emerging variants and advising on the need for adapted vaccines in the light of the available scientific data. The expert group was mobilised quickly at the start of the Omicron crisis, and solutions were sought to share possible access to samples of the virus, organise scientific capacities and share the results widely, with the financial support of HERA.\n\nIn 2021, the Commission increased funding for research on variants by providing an additional â¬30 million to several projects running under Horizon 2020, and launched the EU-wide vaccine trial network Vaccelerate. The network is the backbone of the acceleration of phases two and three of COVID-19 vaccine trials in the EU, connecting all stakeholders involved in vaccine development and providing a pan-European platform for clinical-trial design and conduct.\n\nUnder the Horizon Europe research and innovation programme, â¬120 million was mobilised for 11 new research projects. Most of this amount will support clinical trials for new treatments and vaccines, along with the development of large-scale COVID-19 cohorts and networks, including work beyond the EU. Other projects will reinforce and widen access to research infrastructure, including the COVID-19 Data Platform.\n\nReopening Europe safely\n\nIn May, as the health situation improved and vaccination started to speed up across the EU, the Commission proposed that Member States should gradually ease travel restrictions. In June, the Parliament and the Council approved a Commission proposal for a regulation establishing the EU Digital COVID Certificate, to facilitate safe travel inside the EU. Also in June, the Council adopted an updated recommendation on free-movement restrictions. All of the Member States, along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, implemented the certificate in 2021. Making use of the EU Digital COVID Certificate system, the Council updated its recommendations on travel restrictions. The recommendations also envisaged action to limit the risk of new variants entering the EU: an emergency brake mechanism was introduced to allow Member States to act quickly and set up temporary limits on travellers from affected countries.\n\nThe EU Digital COVID Certificate has been very successful. Thanks to its speedy adoption by the Parliament and the Council it was up and running in just 3 months, and in time for the start of the summer holidays in July. The EU has established a common framework for issuing, verifying and accepting certificates. Many Member States adopted national laws to introduce further use of the certificates domestically. The system has helped to keep shops, services and businesses open and has enabled people to take part in cultural, sporting and leisure events. It has helped the tourism sector by making it easier for authorities and airlines to verify the documentation provided by travellers, giving people the confidence that their documentation will be accepted when they travel in the EU.\n\nBy the end of the year, more than 1 billion certificates had been issued by EU Member States and countries in the European Economic Area. The EU Digital COVID Certificate is also a success worldwide: 33 non-EU countries (and territories) had joined the EU Digital COVID Certificate system by the end of December, based on EU equivalence decisions. The Re-open EU website acts, along with its app, as a hub for information on health and travel measures across the Member States, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.\n\nNextGenerationEU: the EUâs recovery plan in action\n\n2021 saw the EUâs historic NextGenerationEU recovery plan come to life, with funds flowing into EU economies from the summer onwards, marking the start of the turnaround from the pandemic.\n\nNextGenerationEU will not only help repair the damage caused by the pandemic but also enable Member States to invest in the EUâs long-term future and resilience, with a strong focus on accelerating the green and digital transitions. It provides a once-in-a-lifetime chance to emerge stronger from the pandemic, transform EU economies and create opportunities and jobs.\n\nThe centrepiece of NextGenerationEU is the Recovery and Resilience Facility. Launched in February 2021, it offers up to â¬723.8 billion (in current prices) in grants and loans to support reforms and investment across the Member States. The facility is a performance-based instrument, and disbursement of funds is conditional on the satisfactory achievement of the agreed milestones and targets. In order to benefit from it, Member States have to submit to the European Commission national plans that set out the reforms and investments that they intend to make up to the end of 2026, which then must be approved by the Council.\n\nAll plans have to meet binding climate and digital goals, including a minimum expenditure of 37 % dedicated to climate investment and reforms and a minimum expenditure of 20 % dedicated to the digital transition. In practice, Member States are committing to going further than these targets, as almost 40 % of expenditure is to be spent on climate investments and reforms while 26.4 % is to be spent on the digital transition. This will help the EU to achieve its goal of climate neutrality by 2050 and will set it on a path of digital transition, creating jobs and spurring inclusive growth in the process.\n\nUnder the Recovery and Resilience Facility, by the end of 2021 the Commission had positively assessed 22 of the national recovery and resilience plans, worth more than â¬445 billion in total (out of the â¬723.8 billion available). These plans were subsequently approved by the Council. The national plans were assessed according to 11 criteria, including how well they address challenges identified in the European Semester country-specific recommendations. In designing and implementing the growth-enhancing and inclusive reforms required, Member States can count on support from the Commission through the Technical Support Instrument. This support is provided in a wide range of areas, such as the green transition, healthcare, public finances, the digitalisation of education and public services, the business environment and the financial sector.\n\nThe Commission has so far distributed â¬54.3 billion to 20 Member States under the Recovery and Resilience Facility, both in pre-financing and in response to the first payment request from a Member State. In December, following a Commission assessment and confirmation the country had reached the relevant milestones and targets, Spain received â¬10 billion.\n\nThe payments followed the Commissionâs successful performance on the capital markets. To fund NextGenerationEU, the institution, on behalf of the EU, will borrow up to around â¬800 billion on the financial markets by the end of 2026. Thanks to the EUâs high credit rating, the Commission is able to borrow at more favourable rates than many of its Member States, to the advantage of those Member States and the EU budget. The Commission will seek to raise 30 % of the funds by issuing NextGenerationEU green bonds, and will use the proceeds to finance green policies.\n\nIn April 2021, the Commission announced it would use a diversified funding strategy to raise the necessary funding. Following the approval by all EU Member States of the Own Resources Decision â the legal tool enabling the borrowing â the Commission proceeded with the first issuance in June 2021. By the end of the year, it had raised a total of â¬71 billion in EU-Bonds, and additional funds in short-term EU-Bills. This included the first NextGenerationEU green bond, of â¬12 billion â the worldâs largest-ever green bond issuance. It was issued following the adoption of a state-of-the-art NextGenerationEU green bond framework in September 2021, which guarantees to investors in these bonds that the funds mobilised will be allocated to green projects.\n\nAll borrowing under NextGenerationEU will be repaid by 2058. To help repay the funds raised â and to contribute to the EUâs policy objectives on the budget-revenue side as well â the Commission has proposed the introduction of new sources of revenue to the EU budget. A levy based on non-recycled plastic packaging waste, which will contribute to the goals of the European Green Deal, was introduced in January 2021. In December, the Commission proposed to establish three new own resources for the EU budget, based on:\n\nrevenues from the Emissions Trading System;\n\nthe resources generated by the proposed EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism; and\n\nthe share of residual profits of multinational companies reallocated to Member States in accordance with the forthcoming directive on the implementation of the global agreement on the reallocation of taxing rights.\n\nThese revenues will also contribute to financing the Social Climate Fund, designed to make sure that the transition to a decarbonised economy works for everyone. The Commission will propose additional new own resources by the end of 2023.\n\nREACT-EU\n\nâ¬7.7 billion\n\nto help hospitals secure medical devices, personal protective equipment, ventilators and testing.\n\nâ¬11.5 billion\n\nto support businesses in all sectors of the economy, including those hardest hit such as culture, tourism and food service.\n\nâ¬4.1 billion\n\nto provide direct support to people, including workers, by implementing and supporting employmentretention schemes.\n\nSome examples of REACT-EU funding.\n\nAs part of NextGenerationEU, REACT-EU (Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe) continues and extends the crisis-response and crisis-repair measures delivered through the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative and the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative Plus, and provides a bridge to the long-term recovery plan. As such, REACT-EU will contribute to a green, digital and resilient recovery of the economy.\n\nThis funding, of â¬50.6 billion, is entirely new. It is a top-up to funding still available under 2014â2020 programmes to be added to the cohesion funding allocations for 2021â 2027. The money will be made available to the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived.\n\nRural areas of the EU were also supported under the NextGenerationEU recovery instrument, to the amount of â¬8 billion, distributed via the rural development programmes funded under the Common Agricultural Policy. This funding has allowed Member States to support the green and digital transitions in rural areas.\n\nThe EUâs Cohesion Policy on the front line of the recovery.\n\nEuropean Regional Development Fund\n\nThe fund has supported the purchase of vaccines for more than half of the population in Portugal and paid for the installation of new IT systems in the health sector in Slovenia. It is funding the purchase of new medical equipment to help regions become more resilient against future health crises in Czechia, and supporting small companies in managing the digital transition in Sweden.\n\nEuropean Social Fund\n\nAcross the Member States, people have received training, coaching and career guidance to increase their chances of maintaining their jobs or finding new ones. In Italy, businesses have received hiring subsidies to support the employment of women and young people. The fund has also supported financial counselling services and housing for homeless people.\n\nFund for European Aid to the Most Deprived\n\nIn Austria and Romania, children in need have received school supplies. In Estonia, France, Luxembourg and other Member States, food aid (such as warm meals) and basic material assistance (such as hygiene products) have been delivered to those people most in need.\n\nFighting COVID-19 disinformation\n\nIn 2021, the EU continued to fight false information and disinformation on COVID-19 coming from both inside and outside the EU. This entailed monitoring information from a wide range of sources and debunking conspiracy narratives, including about the effects of vaccines or that undermined trust in vaccination. All action was taken in close cooperation with the EMA, the Member States and international partners such as the G7 and NATO. The findings were published regularly by the European External Action Service and the Commission.\n\nIn the face of growing disinformation around the pandemic within the EU, the Commission published guidance on strengthening the Code of Practice on Disinformation to make it a more effective tool for countering false or misleading information, and suggesting wider participation. In July, the Commission and current signatories to the code issued a call for more companies and organisations to sign up with the aim of further strengthening the EUâs stance against this harmful phenomenon. Twenty-six prospective signatories have since joined the process to draft a strengthened code of practice, which is expected in spring 2022.\n\nExternal action included work to strengthen awareness of the benefits of vaccination, including through social media campaigns such as the #VaccToNormal campaign, which features personal stories of vaccinated people from around the world. Efforts focused on public diplomacy initiatives in countries neighbouring the EU â in particular in the Western Balkans â and around the world to ensure access to authoritative information. The EU also provided support to independent media and journalists inside and outside the Member States. The Commission has, in addition, financed research projects addressing the accuracy of information on social and other media, along with coronavirus-related disinformation.\n\nIn October, the Commission launched an Expert Group on Tackling Disinformation and Promoting Digital Literacy through Education and Training. The groupâs overall mission is to help prepare practical guidelines for teachers and educators. This will serve to reinforce the objective of the Commissionâs Digital Education Action Plan, which aims to ensure that every pupil in every school across the EU receives the best possible digital education.\n\nActing worldwide\n\nVaccines\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, the EU has been at the forefront of global solidarity. It has continued to uphold its commitment to ensuring that safe vaccines reach all corners of the world, together with personal protective equipment, ventilators and other equipment, including through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. By the end of 2021, the EU had exported or shared over 1.7 billion vaccine doses to 165 countries, representing two thirds of the total number of doses produced in the EU. This makes the EU, right from day one of vaccine production, the worldâs largest exporter of vaccines.\n\nIn February 2021, COVAX â the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility â started delivering COVID-19 vaccines around the world, with the aim of guaranteeing fair and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines for every country. Team Europe â made up of the EU institutions, the Member States and European financial institutions â is a lead contributor, mobilising over â¬3 billion to help COVAX purchase 1.4 billion doses by the end of 2021, of which more than 981 million doses have been delivered to 144 countries and territories.\n\nComplementing the direct acquisition of doses by COVAX, the European Commission has established an EU Vaccine Sharing Mechanism to help Member States share their vaccines with non-EU countries both directly and via COVAX. The EU supports its partners with their vaccination strategies and the distribution of supplies, and to increase the local manufacturing of vaccines. Member States had committed to sharing over 200 million doses by the end of 2021, a target that was greatly exceeded as 380 million doses were shared with countries outside the EU, 255.4 million of which had been delivered by the end of the year (87 % via COVAX). The G20+ Global Health Summit also saw industrial partners commit to making available 1.5 billion doses of vaccines to low-income countries at no profit and middle-income countries at low cost by the end of 2021. With its humanitarian aid, the EU also responded to urgent needs stemming from COVID-19 among the most vulnerable countries by establishing the COVAX Humanitarian Buffer.\n\nFurthermore, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced in November that the EU will share a total of 700 million vaccine doses with the most vulnerable countries by mid 2022, 200 million of which would be paid for from the EU budget.\n\nThese efforts are complemented by the Team Europe initiative to support local manufacturing and access to vaccines, medicines and health technologies in Africa. This is backed by â¬1 billion from the EU budget and European development finance institutions, and by cooperation between the European Centre for Disease Control and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nGlobal Health Summit\n\nIn May, President von der Leyen and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi co-hosted the G20+ Global Health Summit in Rome, where leaders backed the World Health Organizationâs leading and coordinating role in response to COVID-19, and the broader global agenda on health. Leaders signed the Rome Declaration on preparing for and preventing future pandemics.\n\nThe 16 principles of the declaration reconfirm leadersâ commitment to global solidarity, equity and multilateral cooperation; to effective governance; to a people-centred approach; to building on science and evidence-based policies and trust; and to the promotion of sustained financing for global health. The declaration rejects export bans, and pledges to keep global supply chains open and operational to diversify global vaccine-manufacturing capacity.\n\nThe principles of the Rome Declaration inform ongoing work in the G7 and G20, including the recent formation of a G20 Joint FinanceâHealth Task Force to ensure adequate financing of prevention, preparedness and response. The EU led the efforts that resulted in the decision taken at the World Health Assembly Special Session in November and December to establish an intergovernmental negotiating body to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response.\n\nIn September, the EU and the United States made joint commitments in relation to vaccine sharing, readiness, supply (including of therapeutics), sustainable financing and regional vaccine production in their agenda for beating the global pandemic.\n\nMitigating the effects of the pandemic\n\nThe Team Europe approach has supported over 130 partner countries around the world with flexible financial support. From the beginning of the pandemic until the end of 2021, Team Europe mobilised over â¬46 billion to help address humanitarian needs, improve health, water and sanitation systems and mitigate the socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic.\n\nIn 2021, the EU stepped up its work to kick-start the global recovery. The Commission has worked to bring international players together, building new coalitions and cooperative initiatives to fight COVID-19 and launch a sustainable global recovery. In February, President von der Leyen joined the Global Citizen campaign 'A Recovery Plan for the World'. The year-long campaign was built around five priorities: help end COVID-19; curb the hunger crisis; resume learning everywhere; protect the planet; and advance equity for all.\n\nFrom the beginning of the pandemic until July 2021, the EU provided over â¬4.35 billion to the Western Balkans and Turkey and more than â¬3.41 billion to the European Neighbourhood regions to address immediate health needs and reduce the socioeconomic impact of the crisis. This included programmes and grants to ensure the availability and distribution of EU-authorised COVID-19 vaccines and support to speed up vaccination campaigns. By the end of December, more than 77 million vaccine doses had been provided through the COVAX Facility to the Western Balkans and the Eastern and Southern Neighbourhood regions, and almost 32 million doses had been shared by Member States with partner countries (either directly or via COVAX) with EU support.\n\nCreating a greener, climate-neutral Europe\n\nDelivering the European Green Deal\n\nIn 2021, the EU continued to fight climate change through ambitious policies at home and close cooperation with international partners. In February, the European Commission adopted a new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, setting out how the European Union can adapt to the unavoidable impacts of climate change and become climate resilient by 2050. Europeâs first-ever Climate Law was adopted in June by the European Parliament and the Member States, writing into law the economy-wide targets of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 % by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and reaching climate neutrality by 2050.\n\nThen, in July and December, the Commission tabled a series of proposals to make the EU fit to meet its climate ambitions by revising existing policies and putting forward new measures. The legislative proposals to deliver the European Green Deal cover a wide range of policy areas, including climate, energy, transport and taxation. They set out how the EU will reach its 2030 target, which is now legally binding. The proposals were communicated to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change as the EUâs contribution to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\nThe benefits of climate action are clear: preventing or mitigating the climate emergency; a healthier planet to hand over to future generations; cleaner air; cooler and greener towns and cities; healthier citizens; lower energy use and bills; greater energy independence; new technologies and industrial opportunities; and more space for nature. Last but not least, the green transition will create new types of jobs. Accompanied by the right policies, it could create around 1 million jobs in the EU by 2030 and 2 million by 2050, and enhance the EUâs global competitiveness, with many other countries seeking climate solutions.\n\nWhile the benefits of the EUâs climate policies clearly outweigh the costs of this transition in the medium to long term, in the short term they risk putting extra pressure on vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users. The policies are therefore designed to spread the cost of tackling and adapting to climate change fairly, to ensure a just transition for all. This is one of the reasons why a Social Climate Fund accompanies the Commissionâs proposal for the new Emissions Trading System in road transport and buildings. The potentially significant social impacts are further addressed in the proposed recommendation on ensuring a fair transition towards climate neutrality (see below).\n\nRevision of the EU Emissions Trading System\n\nThe EU Emissions Trading System is the worldâs first major carbon market. It sets a limit, or cap, on the total amount of certain greenhouse gases that can be emitted by the sectors covered. The cap is reduced over time so that total emissions fall. Companies covered by the system buy emissions allowances at auctions or receive them via free allocation. They can also trade allowances with one another as needed. Every year, each company must surrender enough allowances to fully cover its emissions, otherwise heavy fines are imposed.\n\nSince the system was launched, in 2005, greenhouse gas emissions have been cut by around 43 % in the sectors covered (power generation, energy-intensive industry and aviation within the European Economic Area). Together, these sectors account for 41 % of the EUâs total emissions. In July 2021, as part of the legislative package to deliver the European Green Deal, the Commission proposed a new target to reduce emissions from the Emissions Trading System sectors by 61 % by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. To achieve this, the Commissionâs proposal is for a one-off reduction of the total emissions allowances and an increase in the rate of reduction to 4.2 % per year, up from 2.2 % under the current system.\n\nThe Commission has also proposed a Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Compatible with World Trade Organization rules, this mechanism will ensure that ambitious climate action in Europe does not lead to 'carbon leakage', whereby businesses transfer production to countries with weaker rules on emissions. Its gradual introduction, in parallel with the phasing out of free allowances under the current Emissions Trading System, will ensure that certain carbon-intense products imported into the EU â such as cement, iron and steel, aluminium, fertiliser and electricity â cost as much as the same products produced in the EU.\n\nThe Commission has put forward a proposal to strengthen the Market Stability Reserve. This reserve improves the systemâs resilience to major shocks by setting aside a number of emissions allowances, which can be used to adjust the supply of allowances at auction. In the aviation sector, the Commission has proposed to gradually phase out the free allocation of allowances to airlines operating flights in the European Economic Area, moving towards full auctioning of allowances for the sector. The Commission is also proposing to apply the global Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation to flights to and from the European Economic Area.\n\nFor the EU to reach its 2030 emissions reductions target, sectors currently outside the Emissions Trading System need to increase their decarbonisation efforts. To this end, the Commission has proposed to extend emissions trading to maritime transport and to introduce a separate emissions trading system for the road transport and buildings sectors.\n\nIn July, the Commission also proposed to ramp up climate innovation finance by significantly increasing the size of its Modernisation and Innovation Funds. Financed by allowances auctioned under the Emissions Trading System, the funds respectively support lower-income Member States in their transition to climate neutrality and finance innovative low-carbon technologies needed to power the green transition.\n\nA fair transition towards climate neutrality\n\nAt the heart of the European Green Deal lies the commitment to make the transition to a climate-neutral economy in a fair way, leaving no one behind.\n\nA new Social Climate Fund was proposed in July to help Member States support the transition to climate neutrality for those vulnerable citizens most reliant on fossil fuels. The Commission proposes to finance the fund via the EU budget with an amount equivalent, in principle, to 25 % of the expected revenues from the new emissions trading system for the road transport and building sectors, mobilising â¬72.2 billion for the 2025â2032 period. This will be used to assist Member States in supporting vulnerable households and micro-enterprises, invest in energy efficiency and the renovation of buildings and help finance zero- and low-emission mobility. Pending the impact of these investments on reducing costs and emissions, the fund will also be able to finance temporary direct income support for vulnerable households.\n\nIn December, the Commission issued policy guidance to encourage Member States to take action for a fair and inclusive transition to climate neutrality. The proposed Council recommendation addresses the relevant employment and social aspects of the transition. It pays particular attention to addressing the needs of those people and households that are highly dependent on fossil uels and could be most affected by the green transition. It also invites Member States to make optimal use of public and private funding and to work in close cooperation with social partners. The proposal includes measures and guidance to:\n\nsupport quality employment and facilitate job-to-job transitions;\n\npromote equal access to quality education and training;\n\nensure fair tax-benefit and social-protection systems;\n\nfacilitate affordable access to essential services;\n\ncoordinate policy action and follow a whole-of-economy approach; and\n\nmake optimal use of public and private funding.\n\nRevision of legislation for sectors not covered by the Emissions Trading System\n\nFor sectors not covered by the Emissions Trading System, the EUâs Effort Sharing Regulation sets binding targets for reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, for the EU and its Member States. The effort of cutting emissions is distributed among Member States according to their relative wealth, measured in gross domestic product per capita, and taking into account cost-efficiency.\n\nIn July, the Commission made a proposal to increase the EUâs target from the current 29 % decrease in emissions compared to 2005 levels to a 40 % decrease. Proposed national targets for decreases in emissions range from 10 % to 50 %, also compared to 2005.\n\nForests and agricultural land together cover more than three quarters of the EUâs land mass. Well-managed and resilient forests are key to achieving climate neutrality, as they remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. In July, the Commission made a proposal to increase carbon removal to the equivalent of 310 million tonnes of CO2 by 2030 and to achieve climate neutrality in the combined land-use, forestry and agriculture sector at the EU level by 2035.\n\nDecember saw the Commission adopt a communication on sustainable carbon cycles. It sets out how the EU can increase the removal of carbon from the atmosphere by reducing its reliance on fossil carbon, upscaling carbon farming to store more carbon in nature and promoting industrial solutions to sustainably and verifiably remove and recycle carbon.\n\nEU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change\n\nWhile the EU is doing everything it can to mitigate climate change, both domestically and internationally, it must also prepare to face its inescapable consequences. From deadly heatwaves and devastating floods to degraded forests and coastlines eroded by rising sea levels, climate change is already taking its toll.\n\nThis is why, in February, the Commission adopted a new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, setting out how the EU can become climate resilient by 2050. Its objectives are to make adaptation smarter, swifter and more systemic, and to intensify international action. It aims to shift the focus from planning to implementation by developing and deploying solutions at scale.\n\nFor example, Climate-ADAPT, the European platform for adaptation knowledge, will be made more accessible for everyone, and now has a dedicated observatory to help track and prevent health threats linked to climate change. Another example is the launch of a Horizon Europe Mission on Adaptation to Climate Change. This flagship initiative will bring the latest adaptation technology, nature-based solutions and best practices to the EUâs regions so that they can become resilient to climate change.\n\nMaking our buildings more sustainable\n\nFollowing the 2020 Renovation Wave strategy, the Commissionâs ambition of doubling the rate of building renovation across the EU has been reflected in a number of new initiatives. In particular, Decemberâs proposed revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive aims to ensure that the EU is on track to decarbonise its building stock. The revision ensures that the energy consumption of buildings in the EU decreases by upgrading their energy efficiency through deep renovation. The proposal sets minimum energy performance standards and requires that 15 % of the building stock of each Member State be upgraded from label G to at least F by 2030. As part of the revision, the Commission also proposed that all new buildings must be zero-emission from 2030, and new public buildings from 2027.\n\nThe Commissionâs proposal for a new Energy Efficiency Directive includes a more ambitious target for energy savings by 2030 across the economy, including by renovating public buildings. The Renewable Energy Directive proposal also sets a new benchmark of using 49 % renewable energy in buildings by 2030, and requires annual increases in the amount of renewable energy used for heating and cooling. The proposed new emissions trading system for buildings includes heating fuels. The Social Climate Fund financed by the new system will provide financial support for renovation to vulnerable households and micro-enterprises.\n\nFinally, given the potential for renovation to act as a springboard for economic recovery, the EUâs Recovery and Resilience Facility puts particular emphasis on the building sector, and many Member States have included renovation and energy-efficiency investment in their national recovery plans.\n\nNew European Bauhaus\n\nLaunched in 2020, the New European Bauhaus aims to accelerate the transformation of our society and economic sectors such as construction and lifestyle industries, providing citizens with access to goods and services that are circular, affordable and less carbon intensive. In doing so, it helps to translate the European Green Deal into tangible change on the ground that improves everyday life, in buildings and public spaces as well as in fashion and furniture. The New European Bauhaus brings a cultural dimension to the Green Deal, and involves groups such as architects, designers and artists to leverage their contributions to the transformation.\n\nInspiration from grassroots projects from all over Europe and beyond helped shape the Commissionâs concept of the New European Bauhaus initiative, published in September 2021. The co-design phase of the project, which ran from January to July, attracted more than 2 000 contributions. EU programmes â including Horizon Europe, LIFE, the Single Market Programme and Digital Europe â will provide around â¬85 million to New European Bauhaus projects in 2021â2022. In addition, the initiative will be integrated into many other EU programmes, such as Erasmus+ and the European Solidarity Corps. The Commission will also establish a New European Bauhaus Lab to co-create, produce prototypes of and test new tools, solutions and policy recommendations, together with the community.\n\nFrom a 'floating' wild garden in the heart of Barcelona to a zero-waste house in Slovenia, the winners of the first New European Bauhaus prizes showed that sustainable can also be beautiful and inclusive. The 20 winners were announced in September.\n\nPowering a climate-neutral economy\n\nBuilding on the various strategies outlined in 2020, including on energy-system integration, offshore renewable energy, hydrogen and methane emissions, the Commission took a number of steps in 2021 to convert these ideas into EU legislation. It presented proposals in July and December to rewrite EU energy-policy rules and accelerate the transition to clean energy.\n\nThe Commission has proposed that renewables should reach a 40 % share of the EU energy mix by 2030. This is double the 2020 figure, and a significant increase on the previous target of 32 %. Eurostat figures have confirmed that the EU reached its 2020 targets comfortably.\n\nThe July proposal to revise the Renewable Energy Directive includes measures to target areas (such as transport and buildings) where progress has been slower than expected. Similarly, the proposal to revise the Energy Efficiency Directive aims to collectively reduce energy consumption by a further 9 % compared to what Member States have already pledged in their 2021â2030 national energy and climate plans, and intends to nearly double the annual energy-efficiency obligation.\n\nFurther elements of the package of measures to deliver the European Green Deal followed in December, with proposals to decarbonise the gas sector and establish a hydrogen market. These proposals for the EU gas market facilitate the transition from fossil-based fuels towards renewable and low-carbon gases. They also focus on creating a functioning market for hydrogen in the medium term, while also promoting other clean gas technologies.\n\nAs a driving force behind the Global Methane Pledge, to which the EU and 110 countries signed up at the COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, the EU has also helped establish an International Methane Emissions Observatory to measure emissions and track progress. In December, the first-ever legislative proposal was tabled to tackle EU methane emissions.\n\n2021 also saw a rescaling of EU energy labels for certain household products (from washing machines to light bulbs). This shows that the label helps drive innovation in energy efficiency as manufacturers want to be in the highest class available on the market, and consumers are influenced by these labels when buying products.\n\nThe European Green Deal package, in July, also included a proposal to revise the EUâs Energy Taxation Directive. This aims to ensure that the taxation of energy products better reflects the impact they have on the environment and supports the EUâs climate-change goals. The revision will remove current disadvantages for clean-energy products and technologies and introduce higher levels of taxation for more-polluting fuels. This will help to set the right price signals for energy products, thereby reinforcing green innovation and investment in sustainable, clean energy.\n\nAs an immediate response to the global phenomenon of exceptionally high energy prices, the Commission issued a communication with a 'toolbox' of measures in October, indicating short-, medium- and long-term initiatives that the Member States and the EU can undertake to alleviate the situation for households and businesses alike. By January 2022, most Member States had introduced measures laid out in the toolbox, to cushion the impact of the price surge. The Commission followed up on the communication with legislative proposals in December to improve the use of storage. It then set out an enabling framework for joint purchases of gas reserves and provisions to reinforce solidarity between Member States.\n\nSustainable and smart mobility\n\nAs part of the July legislative package to deliver the European Green Deal, the Commission proposed new rules to incentivise and increase the use of clean fuels in the aviation and maritime sectors (ReFuelEU Aviation and FuelEU Maritime). This will not only help reduce emissions from these two sectors, but also foster innovation and economic activity in the EU through the necessary technological adaptation and the development of alternative fuels.\n\nTo meet the decarbonisation targets for transport, the EUâs industrial base must develop new sourcing capabilities, production and storage capacity and distribution networks â all in a very short period. To complement the legislative proposals presented in 2021, the Commission has also launched the Renewable and Low-Carbon Fuels Value Chain Alliance, which aims to boost the supply and affordability of renewable and low-carbon gaseous and liquid fuels in transport, focusing on the aviation and maritime sectors.\n\nThe European Year of Rail in 2021 highlighted the crucial role that railways play in our society, connecting people and businesses across the EU in one of the most sustainable and safest ways available. The Year of Rail also shed light on the challenges of getting more people travelling by train, more businesses shipping their goods by rail and more people working in the rail industry.\n\nOne highlight of the year was the journey across the continent made by the Connecting Europe Express, showcasing the power and potential of Europeâs rail sector. The journey was an opportunity to confirm that more needs to be done for rail to play its rightful part in the green transition. The Commission adopted an action plan in December to boost long-distance cross-border passenger rail, and is preparing new rules on rail freight corridors (see also 'Q & A: Sustainable and Smart Mobility Strategy'). This will help make cross-border rail freight more competitive by improving rail infrastructure capacity management and maximising the use of existing rail infrastructure, complementing the rail industryâs ongoing efforts to improve the speed, punctuality and reliability of rail freight.\n\nIn December, the Commission presented proposals for revised Trans-European Transport Network guidelines, a revised Intelligent Transport Systems Directive and a new EU Urban Mobility Framework.\n\nThe Trans-European Transport Network is an EU-wide network of rail, inland waterways, short-sea shipping routes and roads. It links major cities, ports, airports and terminals. It is crucial to the functioning of the internal market as it ensures the efficient transport of goods and passengers. With the proposed measures, the network will be made greener, more efficient and more resilient.\n\nSmart mobility makes transport safer and more sustainable. The revision of the Intelligent Transport Systems Directive will address the emergence of new road-mobility options, mobility apps and connected and automated mobility. It will stimulate the faster deployment of new, intelligent services by proposing that certain crucial road, travel and traffic data â such as speed limits, traffic circulation plans or roadworks â should be made available in digital formats.\n\nThe new Urban Mobility Framework proposal addresses some of the mobility challenges stemming from the intense activity in cities â including congestion, emissions and noise â for the benefit of transport users and all the people around them.\n\nCleaner and safer vehicles\n\nPassenger cars and vans are together responsible for around 15 % of total CO2 emissions in the EU, therefore the cooperation of these sectors is crucial to achieving the EUâs emissions-reduction targets. More ambitious CO2 emissions standards are needed for new cars and vans to help increase the number of zero- and low-emission vehicles on EU roads. As part of the package to deliver on the European Green Deal, in July the Commission proposed to introduce more ambitious CO2 emission targets for new cars and vans from 2030 onwards:\n\na 55 % reduction in emissions from cars by 2030,\n\na 50 % reduction in emissions from vans by 2030,\n\nzero emissions from new cars by 2035.\n\nTo support the greening of Europeâs transport fleet, the Commission has proposed an alternative fuels infrastructure regulation to guarantee that sufficient public charging and refuelling capacity is in place in every Member State to meet the demands of a growing fleet of zero-emission cars and lorries. The regulation would also ensure EU-wide coverage of charging infrastructure at fixed intervals along major transport corridors, so that drivers can easily recharge or refuel their electric or hydrogen-fuel-cell vehicles across the EU. Under the proposed rules, aircraft, ships and barges will have access to the electricity supply in major ports and airports.\n\nActing globally\n\nThe COP26 Climate Change Conference took place in Glasgow on 1â13 November. At the start of the conference the EU set out three objectives.\n\nFirst, to get commitments to reduce emissions during this decade, to keep within reach the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 Â°C.\n\nSecond, to reach the target of providing $100 billion per year in climate finance to developing and vulnerable countries.\n\nThird, to reach an agreement on the Paris Agreement rulebook.\n\nProgress was made on each of the objectives.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, 195 countries set a goal of keeping the average global temperature rise well below 2 Â°C and as close as possible to 1.5 Â°C. Before COP26, the planet was on course for a dangerous 2.7 Â°C of global warming. Based on new announcements made during the conference, experts estimate that likely scenarios now set the world on track for between 1.8 Â°C and 2.4 Â°C of warming. In the conclusions to the conference, parties have now agreed to revisit their commitments, as necessary, by the end of 2022 to limit global warming to 1.5 Â°C by the end of the century, maintaining the upper end of ambition under the Paris Agreement.\n\nIn order to deliver on these promises, COP26 participants also agreed for the first time to accelerate efforts towards the phase-down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil-fuel subsidies, and recognised the need for support to manage a just transition.\n\nAt COP26, participants also completed the technical negotiations on the Paris Agreement rulebook, which fixes the requirements for all parties to track progress against their emission-reduction targets. The rulebook also sets out how international carbon markets will function, to support further global cooperation on emission reductions.\n\nOn climate finance, developed countries agreed to double the collective share of support to help other countries adapt to the consequences of climate change within the $100 billion annual target for 2021â2025, and to reach the existing goal of providing $100 billion per year to them as soon as possible. Parties also committed to a process to agree on long-term climate finance beyond 2025. The conference also decided to establish a dialogue between parties, stakeholders and relevant organisations to support efforts to avert, minimise and address damage associated with climate change.\n\nThe EU was also involved in the following announcements at COP26.\n\nThe Global Methane Pledge, launched by the EU and the United States. Over 100 countries, representing 70 % of the global economy and almost half of anthropogenic methane emissions, have now committed to a collective goal of reducing global methane emissions by at least 30 % by 2030, compared to 2020 levels.\n\nThe EU has pledged â¬1 billion over 5 years to support the Global Forests Finance Pledge. The EU will help partner countries protect, restore and sustainably manage forests worldwide. More than 100 world leaders, representing around 85 % of the worldâs forests, promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030.\n\nThe EU, along with France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, launched a Just Energy Transition Partnership with South Africa to accelerate the decarbonisation of South Africaâs economy, with a focus on the electricity system. With an initial commitment of $8.5 billion (around â¬7.4 billion) for the first phase of financing, the partnership will help South Africa achieve the ambitious emissions goals set out in its updated nationally determined contribution.\n\nThe EU announced a donation of â¬100 million to the UNâs Adaptation Fund, making it the biggest contributor to the record total of $351.6 million.\n\nA partnership between the Commission, the European Investment Bank and Breakthrough Energy Catalyst â the EUâCatalyst Partnership â will mobilise up to â¬820 million ($1 billion) between 2022 and 2026 to accelerate the deployment of and rapidly commercialise innovative technologies that will help deliver European Green Deal ambitions and the EUâs 2030 climate targets. Each euro of public funds is expected to leverage â¬3 of private funds. Investment will be directed towards EU-based projects with a high level of potential in four sectors: clean hydrogen; sustainable aviation fuels; direct air capture; and long-duration energy storage.\n\nThere is still a lot of work ahead to keep global warming to 1.5 Â°C. The EU will now seek to implement the promises of the Glasgow conference as rapidly as possible, and will continue to work with its international partners to deliver on the Paris Agreement.\n\nUN Biodiversity Conference\n\nParticipating virtually in the Davos Agenda â an online event bringing together leaders from businesses, governments, international organisations, civil-society organisations and academia â on 26 January 2021, Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said that the UN Biodiversity Summit in Kunming, China, 'will have to be like COP21 was for climate. Because we need a Paris-style agreement for biodiversityâ. The EU is leading efforts and working with like-minded partners to come to an agreement, at the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP15) in Kunming, on an ambitious post-2020 global biodiversity framework to halt and reverse the loss of the planetâs plants, animals and ecosystems. The first part of this summit took place in October 2021 and showed generally strong engagement across the globe, reflecting a growing awareness of the urgent need to address the ecological crisis. The Kunming Declaration needs to be translated into a concrete agreement that is scheduled to be adopted in spring 2022, during the second phase of the conference.\n\nEUâJapan Green Alliance\n\nIn June, the EU and Japan announced their intention to create a Green Alliance to accelerate the transition of their economies towards becoming climate neutral, circular and resource efficient. Both Japan and the EU share the aim of becoming climate neutral by 2050. This is the first Green Alliance for the EU, and the increased cooperation with Japan will help the EU create a global coalition for net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nSustainable production and consumption\n\nThe new Circular Economy Action Plan, adopted in 2020, is a key pillar of the European Green Deal. To change the way we produce and consume, it addresses the entire life cycle of products, from design and manufacturing to consumption, repair, reuse, recycling and bringing resources back into the economy.\n\nThe Commission has taken action to ensure that the EU does not export its waste challenges to non-EU countries. The November proposal for a thorough review of EU rules on waste shipments will benefit the circular economy in several ways, both within and outside the EU.\n\nFirst, the proposal will improve the functioning of the EU internal market for waste for recycling and reuse, to boost the market for secondary materials and the circular economy (shipments within the EU).\n\nSecond, it will reduce waste exports and guarantee that waste is only shipped outside the EU if it will be managed in an environmentally sound manner in the countries of destination.\n\nThird, the proposal will tackle illegal shipments by improving the system of enforcement and sanctions and by increasing transparency in the waste supply chain.\n\nThe Commission has proposed limit values for the presence of persistent organic pollutants in waste, to eliminate or minimise their emissions. This will ensure clean material cycles and secure trust in the markets for secondary raw materials and the products that use them. It will also ensure the highest level of protection of human health and the environment.\n\nSustainable food systems\n\nIn July, the Commission, together with 65 industry stakeholders, launched the EU Code of Conduct on Responsible Food Business and Marketing Practices, a deliverable under the Farm-to-Fork Strategy. The code has two aims: for EU associations to inspire their members towards specific goals, targets and initiatives, all geared towards making the sustainability transition work; and for frontrunner companies to make ambitious commitments covering areas such as animal welfare, cutting sugar and salt content and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe EU was an important contributor to the first UN Food Systems Summit, convened by AntÃ³nio Guterres, the UN Secretary-General, in September. Outcomes include a statement of action, food-systems transformation pathways and more than 30 coalitions for action. The Commission contributes to the pathways and will actively engage in several of the coalitions. A global meeting will be organised every 2 years to review progress.\n\nAgriculture, fisheries and rural areas\n\nThe new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for 2023â2027 was adopted on 2 December 2021. The secondary legislation that details the implementation of the new CAP will be adopted early in 2022. The new CAP will be greener, fairer and more flexible, with a stronger focus on innovation, while ensuring food security for people in the EU. It will be essential to achieving the objectives of the European Green Deal and its Farm-to-Fork and Biodiversity strategies. By the end of 2021, most Member States had submitted their strategic plans to implement the new CAP at the national level. The Commission will assess the plans, taking into account how they contribute to the 2030 targets set out in the two strategies. Following the Commissionâs approval, the plans will apply from 2023.\n\nRural areas cover 83 % of the EUâs territory and are home to 30 % of the population. The long-term vision for EU rural areas, launched in June, examines the socioeconomic challenges associated with achieving stronger, connected, resilient and prosperous rural areas by 2040. Such areas are key to the EUâs sustainability goals, providing food security and sustainable raw materials, improving water quality and biodiversity and acting as carbon sinks. The vision aims to revitalise rural areas and rethink development in line with the objectives of the European Green Deal, the sectoral EU policies, the NextGenerationEU recovery package, the Territorial Agenda 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals, while countering negative demographic trends.\n\nIn cooperation with local, regional and national authorities, the vision will support, among other things, smart specialisation, environmental protection, the improved competitiveness of small and medium-sized enterprises, digitalisation and social inclusion.\n\nIn December, the Commission adopted a communication on sustainable carbon cycles, setting out how to remove more carbon from the atmosphere. To balance out the impact of its CO2 emissions, the EU will need to drastically reduce its reliance on fossil carbon, scale up carbon farming to store more carbon in nature and promote industrial solutions to sustainably and verifiably remove and recycle carbon. The communication sets out short-to-medium-term initiatives on carbon farming to better reward land managers for carbon sequestration and biodiversity protection. By the end of 2022, the Commission will propose an EU regulatory framework for the certification of carbon removals.\n\nIn March, the Commission adopted an Action Plan for the Development of Organic Production in the EU. This aims to contribute to the European Green Deal target of having 25 % of agricultural land dedicated to organic farming by 2030, along with a significant increase in organic aquaculture. It will do so by stimulating consumer demand, expanding the production and supply of organic products and increasing the sustainability of the sector.\n\nMember States are invited to set targets and to support measures for organic production under the new CAP and national action plans. The Commission also encourages Member States to include the increase in organic aquaculture production in their national strategic plans for aquaculture, which are currently under review by the Member States. Innovation, research and the exchange of best practices will receive a significant boost across the EU to support further sustainable expansion in organics. Support for organic aquaculture will also be available under the 2021â2027 European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund.\n\nThe COVID-19 crisis has shown the resilience of the EU agri-food sector. EU action ensured that the food supply lines continued to function, preventing the health crisis from being aggravated by food shortages. Mindful of the growing impact of climate change and environmental degradation on food production â along with risks related to public health, cyber threats or geopolitical shifts threatening the functioning of the food supply chain â in November the Commission adopted a contingency plan for ensuring food supply and food security in times of crisis, as envisaged under the Farm-to-Fork Strategy. This plan is based on cooperation between all of those involved in the food chain, to ensure preparedness in times of crisis.\n\nEuropean Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund\n\nThe European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund, set up in 2021, supports the implementation of the EUâs Common Fisheries Policy, maritime policy and International Ocean Governance Agenda. The fund promotes the sustainable use and management of marine resources and the development of a resilient blue economy. As a global ocean actor and a major producer of seafood, the EU aims to protect and sustainably use the oceans and their resources, guaranteeing the availability of food supplies, the competitiveness of the maritime economy and the livelihoods of coastal communities. The fund is also helping to achieve the UNâs Sustainable Development Goal No 14 ('Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources') and to fulfil the objectives of the European Green Deal.\n\nSupport from the fund is especially geared towards innovative projects that facilitate the transition to sustainable and low-carbon fishing; the protection of marine biodiversity; the supply of quality and healthy seafood; the economic and social vitality of coastal communities; the improvement of skills and working conditions in the fishing and aquaculture sectors; and international cooperation on healthy, safe and sustainably managed oceans. The total budget for 2021â2027 is â¬6.1 billion.\n\nThe blue economy\n\nThe EUâs blue economy, which encompasses all industries and sectors related to oceans, seas and coasts, is fundamental to the European Green Deal and the Recovery Plan for Europe. The EUâs new approach for a sustainable blue economy is an indispensable factor in meeting the EUâs environmental and climate objectives. It does so by promoting the development of offshore renewable energy, the decarbonisation of maritime transport and the greening of ports; introducing guidelines for sustainable aquaculture; and renewing standards for fishing-ge ar design, ship recycling and decommissioning offshore platforms.\n\nFurthermore, developing new green infrastructure in coastal areas will help preserve biodiversity and landscapes, while benefiting tourism and the coastal economy. The new approach provides coherence across the various blue economy sectors, facilitates their coexistence and looks for synergies in the maritime space. It also underlines the need for investment in research, skills and innovation.\n\nInternational cooperation\n\nThe European Union has the ambition and the know-how to lead the world in the transition to a circular economy. It teamed up with the UN Environment Programme and the UN Industrial Development Organization to launch the Global Alliance on Circular Economy and Resource Efficiency on 21 February. The aim of the alliance is to support a global, just transition to a climate-neutral, resource-efficient and circular economy, to use resources more equitably and to achieve sustainable consumption and production. It builds on international efforts and puts the EU at the forefront of the green transition.\n\nEnvironmental footprint methods\n\nImproving the environmental performance of products and organisations is an essential part of the transition to a circular economy, and is necessary to achieve other European Green Deal objectives. In December, the Commission adopted a recommendation on the use of common environmental footprint methods to measure and communicate the environmental performance of products and organisations. This will help many people and organisations involved in environmental decision-making.\n\nProtecting the environment and biodiversity\n\nThe zero pollution vision for 2050\n\nAir, water and soil pollution is reduced to levels no longer harmful to health and natural ecosystems, thus creating a toxin-free environment.\n\nWhy do we need a Zero Pollution Action Plan?\n\nIn the EU, every year, pollution causes 1 in 8 deaths.\n\nPollution can cause cancer, coronary heart disease, obstructive pulmonary disease, mental and neurological conditions, diabetes and more.\n\nThe most vulnerable groups are the hardest hit, creating further inequalities.\n\nPollution is one of the five main drivers of biodiversity loss.\n\nPollution is threatening the survival of more than 1 million of the planetâs estimated 8 million plant and animal species.\n\nÂ© GettyImages/Mario De moya F\n\nThe Zero Pollution Action Plan â\n\ntargets for 2030\n\nÂ© GettyImages/hirun â¢ Â© GettyImages/oticki\n\nAir. Reduce premature deaths caused by air pollution by more than 55 %.\n\nWater. Reduce waste and plastic litter at sea by 50 % and microplastics released into the environment by 30 %.\n\nSoil. Reduce nutrient losses and chemical pesticide use by 50 %.\n\nBiodiversity. Reduce the number of EU ecosystems in which air pollution threatens biodiversity by 25 %.\n\nNoise. Reduce the share of people chronically disturbed by transport noise by 30 %.\n\nWaste. Reduce total waste generation significantly, and residual municipal waste by 50 %.\n\nIn May, the Commission adopted the Zero Pollution Action Plan, to achieve zero pollution by 2050. This means that pollution will be reduced to levels that are no longer harmful to health or natural ecosystems. The action plan combines all relevant EU policies to tackle and prevent pollution of the air, water and soil, marine and noise pollution and pollution caused by consumer products. Along with the European Committee of the Regions, on 16 December the Commission launched the Zero Pollution Stakeholder Platform to bring together people from different communities and areas of expertise to tackle these interrelated challenges.\n\nIn 2021, the Commission implemented several of the 80 measures announced in the 2020 Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability. It established a high-level round-table conference to reach the strategyâs objectives in dialogue with the stakeholders concerned. To ensure that the most harmful chemicals will no longer be used in consumer products, except when essential for society, the Commission is revising legislation and setting criteria for the 'essential use' of a chemical. Funding opportunities for research on the impacts of chemicals on health and for the green transition to safe and sustainable chemicals were set up through Horizon Europe, LIFE, the Recovery and Resilience Facility, cohesion funds and InvestEU.\n\nThe European Environment Agencyâs latest report on 'Air quality in Europe 2021', published in December, found that, despite improvements, air pollution is still a major health concern for people. Similarly, the 'Second clean air outlook' report highlighted that the full implementation of clean-air and climate measures could reduce premature deaths due to air pollution by 55 % in 2030 compared to 2005. The report also stressed that more could be done, as there are still plenty of measures for reducing air pollution that would bring more benefits than costs to society.\n\nThe plastic problem\n\nin numbers\n\n80â85 % of marine litter found on the EUâs beaches is plastic.\n\n50 % of EU marine litter consists of single-use plastic items.\n\n27 % is fishing gear that contains plastic.\n\nPlastic causes â¬13 billion worth of damage to global marine ecosystems each year.\n\nAn estimated â¬630 million is lost each year by tourism and coastal communities in the EU due to plastic pollution.\n\nPlastic costs the EUâs fishing industry an estimated â¬300 million a year.\n\nExpected impact\n\nCut littering of the top-10 single-use plastic items by more than 50 %.\n\nPrevent CO2 emissions of 3.4 million tonnes per year.\n\nPrevent â¬22 billion worth of environmental damage by 2030.\n\nSave consumers â¬6.5 billion a year thanks to less spending on throwaway products.\n\nOut â¦\n\nSingle-use plastic items to be banned by 2021:\n\nCutterly\n\nplates\n\nstraws\n\ndrink stirrers\n\ncups and food and drink containers made of polystyrene (including lids)\n\ncotton buds and balloon sticks\n\nall products made of oxo-degradable plastic (widely used for shopping bags).\n\nIn â¦\n\n2021 clear labelling of cups, wet wipes, sanitary pads, tampons and applicators, and tobacco products with filters, highlighting their plastic content, proper disposal methods and environmental risks.\n\n2024 lids and caps made to stay on drinks containers and bottles with a capacity of up to 3 litres.\n\n2025 plastic bottles made of at least 25 % recycled plastic.\n\nseparate collection of 77 % of plastic bottles with a capacity of up to 3 litres.\n\n2026 EU Member States to achieve ambitious and sustained cuts in consumption of single-use plastic cups (including lids/covers) and food containers, compared to 2022.\n\n2029 separate collection of 90 % of plastic bottles with a capacity of up to 3 litres.\n\n2030 plastic bottles made of at least 30 % recycled plastic.\n\nPlastic waste accumulates in seas and oceans and on beaches in the EU and worldwide. The EU is taking action against plastic pollution. EU rules on single-use plastic products aim to prevent and reduce the environmental impact of certain plastic products by banning from the EU market single-use plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks and cotton buds, along with cups, food and beverage containers made of expanded polystyrene and all products made of oxo-degradable plastic. To reduce plastic pollution and waste, the EU is promoting recycling. The Circular Plastics Alliance brings together 300 relevant stakeholders and has committed to ensuring that at least 10 million tonnes of recycled plastics find their way into new products in the EU by 2025.\n\nProtecting the environment through criminal law\n\nIn December, the Commission adopted a proposal to strengthen the protection of the environment through criminal law, fulfilling a key commitment of the European Green Deal. The proposal intends to make protection of the environment more effective by obliging Member States to take criminal law measures. It defines new environmental crimes, sets a minimum level for sanctions and strengthens the effectiveness of law-enforcement cooperation. It also obliges the Member States to support and assist people who report environmental offences and who cooperate with the enforcement. This proposal will help to protect nature and natural resources, along with public health and well-being.\n\nInternational Coral Reef Initiative\n\nIn February 2021, the EU joined the International Coral Reef Initiative. This will help the EU uphold the principles of the International Ocean Governance Agenda while supporting climate action and strengthening its commitment to protecting biodiversity. As part of its activities under the initiative, the EU is promoting its goal of protecting vulnerable marine ecosystems in cooperation with other like-minded organisations and countries. This includes adopting good practices in the sustainable management of coral reefs and associated ecosystems, capacity building and awareness raising.\n\nForests\n\nThe worldâs forests are being damaged and destroyed at an alarming rate. Around 80 % of global deforestation is driven by agricultural expansion, and the EU is also a consumer of commodities linked to global deforestation, such as soy, palm oil, wood, cocoa and coffee. With a legislative proposal adopted in November to ban the access of commodities from deforestation to the EU market, the Commission is seeking to minimise the EUâs contribution to deforestation and forest degradation worldwide and to promote the consumption of products from deforestation-free supply chains in the EU.\n\nConsumption of beef, palm oil, soy beans, wood, cocoa and coffee in the EU drives deforestation and forest degradation across the world. The EU aims to stop this by no longer allowing deforestationrelated commodities and products on the market.\n\nÂ© Avigator Fortuner/Shutterstock.com\n\nCitizens supported EU action to tackle deforestation and forest degradation with 1.2 million responses to a public consultation.\n\nDeforestation and forest degradation are important drivers of global warming and biodiversity loss. 23 % of greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, forestry and other land uses.\n\nThe new Deforestation Regulation will:\n\nguarantee EU citizens that the listed products they buy, use and consume do not contribute to global deforestation and forest degradation;\n\nreduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere due to EU consumption and production of the relevant commodities by at least 32 million tonnes a year, saving at least â¬3.2 billion annually and enhancing the contribution of forests to tackling climate change;\n\naddress illegal deforestation and forest degradation, along with any deforestation due to agricultural expansion caused by the production of the commodities.\n\nThe new EU Forest Strategy for 2030, adopted in July, will contribute to achieving the EUâs biodiversity and climate objectives. It recognises the central and multifunctional role of forests, and the role of foresters and the forest-based value chain in achieving a sustainable and climate-neutral economy by 2050 and preserving lively and prosperous rural areas. The strategy sets out a vision and concrete initiatives to improve the quantity and quality of EU forests and to invest in research and innovation as motors for change, and includes a pledge to plant 3 billion additional trees by 2030.\n\nHealthy and biodiverse forests are also key to reducing the risk of wildfires, which once again wreaked havoc in several regions in Europe during the summer. The prevention, preparedness and response efforts under the EU Civil Protection Mechanism to fight forest fires are an integral element of EU action to protect people and nature. The Commission has continued to strengthen the EUâs aerial forest-firefighting capacities to address national shortcomings in responding to forest fires. The Commission also published new guidelines in March 2021 on land-based wildfire prevention and effective responses.\n\nSoil strategy\n\nSoils are home to a quarter of all biodiversity on the planet, and by 2050 they will need to feed a world population of nearly 10 billion people. However, here in the EU they continue to degrade. In November, the Commission adopted an EU Soil Strategy for 2030, along with a mission in the area of soil health and food under Horizon Europe to restore our soils and achieve the EUâs climate and biodiversity goals, while recognising the key role of farmers and foresters.\n\nHealthy soils are essential for achieving climate neutrality, establishing a clean and circular economy, reversing biodiversity loss, providing healthy food, safeguarding human health and halting desertification and land degradation.\n\nÂ© LeQuangNhut/Shutterstock.com\n\nÂ© Photo by Becca Lavin on Unsplash\n\nÂ© design36/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe new EU Soil Strategy:\n\nsets out a framework and concrete measures for the protection, restoration and sustainable use of soils , in synergy with other European Green Deal policies;\n\nsets out a vision to achieve healthy soils by 2050 and its associated objectives, with concrete action by 2030;\n\nannounces a new Soil Health Law to be proposed by 2023 to ensure a level playing field and a high level of environmental and health protection, complementing the upcoming Nature Restoration Law.\n\nClean water\n\nMost people living in the EU already enjoy very good access to safe drinking water, thanks in part to over 30 years of EU legislation on drinking-water quality. In January, the revised Drinking Water Directive entered into force. As a direct follow-up to the first-ever successful European Citizensâ Initiative, 'Right2Water', it includes measures to improve and maintain access to safe drinking water for everyone in the EU, in particular for vulnerable and marginalised groups. It also covers the latest scientific developments and contaminants of emerging concern, in line with the EUâs zero-pollution ambition.\n\nThe EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change highlights the importance of measures such as nature-based solutions, reducing our water use and a stable supply of clean water. Within this framework, in December, the Commission published a report assessing Member Statesâ updated programmes of measures under the Water Framework Directive and the updated national preliminary flood-risk assessments under the Floods Directive.\n\nIvory trade\n\nDespite an international ivory-trade ban under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, elephant poaching and ivory trafficking recently reached record levels. In December, the Commission proposed additional measures aimed at effectively banning most forms of EU trade in ivory. While the EU is not identified as a region of concern regarding the illegal ivory trade, this revision of existing EU rules reaffirms and delivers on the EUâs commitment to take further action against elephant poaching and ivory trafficking globally. It also follows the commitment made in the EU Biodiversity Strategy to further tighten the rules on the EU trade in ivory.\n\nRevised Commission guidance on the EU regime governing the ivory trade notably suspends the trade in raw ivory on the EU market, while amendments to an existing Commission regulation ensure that any remaining trade in antique ivory objects will always be subject to prior authorisation.\n\nEighth Environment Action Programme\n\nThe focus of the Eighth Environment Action Programme is on supporting the implementation of the European Green Deal at all levels of governance, and on monitoring progress. The programme builds on the long-term vision for 2050 of 'living well, within planetary boundaries' and sets out six priority objectives for the period up to 2030: climate mitigation, climate adaptation, the circular economy, zero pollution, biodiversity and tackling the main environmental and climate pressures.\n\nThe programme calls for good governance; sustainable finance; the integration of environmental concerns into all policy areas; a number of steps enabling the phasing out of environmentally harmful subsidies; and the development of knowledge and innovation to support the transition to an economy that promotes well-being. The proposed programme was endorsed by Member States in a provisional political agreement in December.\n\nResearch and innovation helping to deliver the European Green Deal\n\nOver 35 % of the â¬95.5 billion budget of the Horizon Europe programme for 2021â2027 will be invested in research and innovation to address climate change and contribute to the objectives of the European Green Deal. In June, the Commission proposed a set of new European partnerships in the fields of climate, energy and transport. These partnerships will leverage more than â¬22 billion in private financial and in-kind contributions, and will promote the development and delivery of new technologies, materials and products with lower greenhouse gas emissions and better overall environmental performance.\n\nIn September, the Commission launched five new EU Missions â a new way of working together to tackle big challenges in health, climate and the environment. A novelty of Horizon Europe and an original concept in EU policy, bringing together several Commission services under the authority of nine members of the College of Commissioners, missions will support research to deliver on the Commissionâs main priorities and find answers to some of the biggest challenges that society faces today. The missions include research and innovation projects, policy measures and legislative initiatives to deliver solutions to key global challenges by 2030. The Commission is making nearly â¬2 billion available from the Horizon Europe programme between 2021 and 2023 to launch the five missions, with further funding expected from other programmes. Of the five missions launched in September 2021, four aim to deliver on the objectives of the European Green Deal:\n\nAdaptation to Climate Change (which will support at least 150 European regions and communities in becoming climate resilient);\n\n100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities;\n\nRestore our Ocean and Waters;\n\nA Soil Deal for Europe (100 living labs and beacons to lead the transition towards healthy soils).\n\nIn September and October, the Commission approved â¬1 billion in funding for 73 research and innovation projects to support the European Green Deal. Besides investing in core technologies across a wide spectrum â from energy sources and biomass to transport technologies and infrastructure â the call for projects also had two human-centric areas: strengthening knowledge and empowering citizens.\n\nSustainable finance\n\nIn April, the Commission adopted a package of initiatives to help improve the flow of finance towards sustainable activities across the EU. The EU Taxonomy Climate Delegated Act sets out the technical screening criteria for economic activities that make a substantial contribution to the climate objectives under the Taxonomy Regulation, with no significant harm to other EU environmental objectives. A proposal for a corporate sustainability reporting directive aims to improve the quality of sustainability information reported by companies. It will make their reporting on sustainability more consistent, so that financial firms, investors and the public have access to comparable and reliable information on companiesâ risks and impacts as regards sustainability. Six amending delegated acts on fiduciary duties, investment and insurance advice were adopted to ensure that financial firms include information on sustainability in their procedures and their investment advice to clients.\n\nThe Sustainable Finance Strategy adopted in July 2021 aims to support the financing of the transition to a sustainable economy through action in four areas: facilitating transition finance; supporting a more inclusive sustainable finance framework; strengthening work on the resilience and impact of the financial sector; and adapting to renewed global ambition.\n\nFinancing the transition to sustainability\n\nThis strategy provides the tools and policies to enable those involved across the economy to finance their transition plans and to reach climate and broader environmental goals, whatever their starting point.\n\nInclusiveness\n\nThis strategy caters for the needs of, and provides opportunities to, individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises to have greater access to sustainable finance.\n\nFinancial-sector resilience and contribution\n\nThis strategy sets out how the financial sector itself can contribute to meeting Green Deal targets, while also becoming more resilient and combating greenwashing.\n\nGlobal ambition\n\nThis strategy sets out how to promote international cooperation for an ambitious global sustainable finance agenda.\n\nIn July, the Commission proposed a regulation on a European Green Bond Standard. This proposal aims to create a high-quality voluntary standard available to all bond issuers to help finance sustainable investments.\n\nGreen bonds are already used to raise finance in sectors such as energy production and distribution, resource-efficient "
