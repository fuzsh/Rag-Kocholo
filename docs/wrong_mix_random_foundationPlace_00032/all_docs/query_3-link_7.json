TARBERT, OF MARYLAND, TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY, INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND DEVELOPMENT, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY ---------- TUESDAY, MAY 16, 2017 U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Washington, DC. The Committee met at 10:03 a.m., in room SD-538, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Mike Crapo, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN MIKE CRAPO Chairman Crapo. This hearing will come to order. Congratulations to all of you on your nominations to these very important offices. I see friends and family behind you, and I welcome all of you here as well. This morning, we are going to consider four nominations: First, Ms. Sigal Mandelker. She is to be the Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Crimes. Second, Ms. Mira Ricardel. Did I get that right, Ricardel? Ms. Ricardel. Yes, sir. Thank you. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. To be Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. Third, Mr. Marshall Billingslea, to be Assistant Secretary of Treasury for Terrorist Financing. And, finally, Mr. Heath Tarbert, to be Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Markets and Development. Again, welcome to all of you. Considering the nature of these nominations, especially in a time of heightened security in the international arena, we need to work together to process your nominations quickly. All four of these highly qualified nominees have extensive national security experience from their years spent in Government, supplemented by an understanding of the practicalities and specific commerce and finance requirements honed in the private sector. Ms. Mandelker's experience in senior law enforcement and national security positions equip her with the judgment necessary as Under Secretary to lead Treasury's Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, the TFI, where she would oversee sanctions policy on Iran, Russia, North Korea, Syria, and some 25 other programs, including narcotraffickers, nuclear proliferators, and the like. Ms. Mandelker would also lead on the Nation's anti-money laundering efforts and other illicit financial threats. As Assistant Secretary, Mr. Billingslea would work with Ms. Mandelker to coordinate all elements of the national security and law enforcement community to develop and execute TFI policies and to conduct outreach strategies to address threats to the domestic and international financial system. Mr. Billingslea has worked jointly with Treasury elements in the past while he served in senior defense positions. This experience puts him in an excellent position to leverage these and other such relationships in the future. Mr. Tarbert has an in-depth knowledge of both international and domestic financial markets. He will be a great representative for the United States in international discussions on matters of financial services regulation and open investment. If confirmed, he will manage Treasury regulations affecting financial institutions, including systemic risk designations. He will also coordinate Treasury initiatives on financial education and overseeing the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program. And as if that were not enough, a critical part of Mr. Tarbert's job, and the reason for which his position was created by legislation passed in this Committee, is to marshal the procedures and processes of the multi-agency, Treasury-led Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or what we call ``CFIUS'', in a timely manner to protect our Nation from hostile foreign investment transactions designed to undermine the national security interests of the United States. Ms. Ricardel has extensive Government and private sector leadership experience in the national security arena necessary to lead the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. The core mission of BIS is to ensure that sensitive dual-use items do not find their way into the hands of dangerous countries, organizations, and individuals in such a manner that still ensures the United States retains its innovative and productive capacity. Every decision will call for a national security, foreign policy, and fundamental business decision affecting the bottom line of companies, U.S. exports, and American jobs. All four of these positions are important to maintaining critical United States law enforcement and national security interests, while also preserving vibrant financial markets and cross-border transactions that can contribute greatly to the economic growth of the United States. While many people may not have heard of the exact positions to which each of you have been nominated, these are critical and sensitive national security positions within the United States financial system. Some have argued that candidates for such positions must be able to balance these security interests with supporting an environment for flexible and open financial and commercial transactions. The United States is not in the business of balancing its national security interests against anyone or anything; it assures them. In that context, you are also charged with preserving the integrity of a uniquely American financial and commercial environment respected the world over for its access and its certainty. None of the candidates here will ever wake up in the morning asking themselves why they are going to work. There is too much at stake in the perennial war on terror and in protecting our national interests. Thank you very much for accepting these difficult challenges and for your service to our country. I urge my colleagues to confirm you without delay. At this time I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter into the record six letters in support of the nominees. Without objection. Senator Brown. STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today the Banking Committee is meeting to do something it rarely or never did over the last 2 years: to assess the qualifications of four nominees that the President has put forward for key national security roles in the Treasury and Commerce Departments. These include: Ms. Sigal Mandelker, to be Treasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes. Welcome. Mr. Marshall Billingslea, to serve as Treasury Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing. Welcome to you. Mr. Heath Tarbert, to be Treasury Assistant Secretary for International Markets. Welcome, Mr. Tarbert. And Ms. Mira Ricardel, to serve as Commerce Under Secretary for Export Administration. Welcome to the Committee. As you will introduce them, Mr. Chairman, I will not spend more time on their distinguished backgrounds. I will join you in thanking the nominees for their willingness to serve and in welcoming them and their family members to our Committee. I am pleased we appear to be returning to the Banking Committee's long tradition of giving Administration appointees full, fair, and prompt consideration. For the last 2 years, this Committee slow-walked, and more precisely in many cases stonewalled, the President's nominations for key positions in our jurisdiction. Perhaps the most reprehensible was Adam Szubin, who testified before one of our Subcommittees last week. He was denied a Committee vote for many months, then was never considered by the Senate--all this despite broad bipartisan support for him and the superb work he did in the terrorism and illicit finance arena at Treasury for many years. This Committee's dereliction of duty during that period was reprehensible. Considering the volatile situations in North Korea and Syria and Iran, and with non-State actors like ISIS, I am all for getting these important national security nominees in place. How fast we do so likely depends in part on how quickly Treasury satisfies a bipartisan request for certain financial information on the Russia investigation by the Intelligence Committee. I share Senator Warner's views on this. I hope that information is provided without further delay. As Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Crimes, Ms. Mandelker would oversee the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. With 700 employees, this office marshals Treasury's intelligence and enforcement functions. Its twin aims are to safeguard the financial system against illicit use and to combat threats from rogue Nations, terrorist facilitators, weapons of mass destruction proliferators, money launderers, and drug kingpins. It is also perhaps the most important role in the U.S. Government to ensure that economic measures like sanctions are applied effectively against our adversaries. Mr. Billingslea's role alongside Ms. Mandelker will also be critical. He has been selected for a position as the head of a unit that does outreach across all elements of the national security community, including law enforcement, regulatory, policy, diplomatic, and intelligence communities, and with the private sector and foreign Governments to identify and address illicit finance threats within the international finance system. Mr. Tarbert has been nominated to be Treasury Assistant Secretary for International Markets and Development. If confirmed, he would be responsible for leading Treasury's efforts related to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, as well as international financial services regulation, trade, development, technical assistance, and climate finance. CFIUS continues to play a vital role reviewing foreign investments that could threaten our national security. We should be concerned when investments come from entities with ties to the Chinese Government and State-owned enterprises. We have already seen attempts by foreign entities to acquire businesses and real estate of senior Administration officials. In addition, after the financial crisis, as economies around the world continue to recover, it is essential that Treasury engage with our international counterparts to conduct strong financial services oversight. I expect the U.S. will continue to pursue strong rules and not support a race to the bottom that put the world's financial institutions at risk. Finally, as Under Secretary for Export Administration, Ms. Ricardel would oversee the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security. BIS is a licensing, regulatory, and enforcement agency that works to ensure an effective export control and treaty compliance system and promotes U.S. technology leadership and a strong industrial base. Again, I welcome the nominees to the Committee. I look forward to hearing from them. Thank you. Chairman Crapo. Thank you very much, Senator Brown. And with that, I need to administer an oath, so would each of you please stand and raise your right hand? Do you swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Ms. Mandelker. I do. Ms. Ricardel. I do. Mr. Billingslea. I do. Mr. Tarbert. I do. Chairman Crapo. And do you agree to appear and testify before any duly constituted Committee of the senate? Ms. Mandelker. I do. Ms. Ricardel. I do. Mr. Billingslea. I do. Mr. Tarbert. I do. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. You may take your seats. Your written statements will each be made a part of the record, and as I believe you have been informed, I ask you to try to keep your oral comments today to 5 minutes. We have a lot of Senators, who I also remind to keep their questioning to 5 minutes. And before you begin your statements--we will go in the order that you are seated. Before you begin your statements, you are welcome to introduce anyone of your family who is here, if you would like, and we will start with you, Ms. Mandelker. Ms. Mandelker. Thank you, Chairman. I have a number of people here, my brother, my father, and my niece. Chairman Crapo. Thank you very much. We welcome you here. You have got to be very proud. Please proceed. Ms. Ricardel. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am honored to introduce my husband, Vincent; my mother, Brigitta; my brother and sister-in-law, and my aunt and uncle. And I am so honored to have their love and support and have them here today. Thank you. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Mr. Billingslea. Mr. Billingslea. Thank you, Chairman. I am joined by my wife, Karen, and my youngest daughter, Elsa, and my oldest daughter, Morgan; and my sister, who is in the very back. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Mr. Tarbert. Mr. Tarbert. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am joined by my wife, Kate; my 5-year-old son, Ben; my mother, Pat Tarbert; my brother, Colin Tarbert; and my sister-in-law, Bonnie Tarbert. Chairman Crapo. Well, thank you. And you are each honored by your family who are here to support you, and I know that they, as I just indicated, are all very proud of you. We appreciate, again, your willingness to be of service to your country. Let us start with the testimony then, and, Ms. Mandelker, please proceed. STATEMENT OF SIGAL P. MANDELKER, OF NEW YORK, TO BE UNDER SECRETARY FOR TERRORISM AND FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Ms. Mandelker. Thank you very much. Thank you, Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and Members of the Committee. It is a great honor to appear before you as the President's nominee to lead the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. I want to thank the President and the Secretary for their trust and confidence in me. I have had the opportunity to meet with so many of you over the last few weeks, and I want to thank you for the courtesies that you have shown me. And I also look forward to working very closely with this Committee if I am honored to be confirmed. I also want to say I am very grateful for the tremendous support of my family and friends, including those who traveled to attend this hearing. I want to recognize in particular two of my heroes and constant sources of inspiration: my father, Gershon Mandelker, who is here today, and my wonderfully lovely mother who passed away 12 years ago. Both of them were Holocaust survivors who spent part of their childhood hiding underground, in the forest, and elsewhere in constant fear for their lives as they tried to escape the Nazis. My dad tells one story about how he was hiding in a barn. The head of a village, a very courageous man, had agreed to hide my dad, my grandfather, and several others. And as they were hiding, a group of soldiers came to the barn because they wanted to see whether or not that was a good place to park their guns and their horses. And so my dad hid under a haystack, and he very distinctly remembers the soldiers coming in, walking around, looking, and then ultimately decided that that is not where they were going to put their horses. But he has a vivid memory of watching the boots of one of those soldiers. If my dad had so much as sneezed in that moment, I can assure you I would not be here today, and my dad would not be here proudly sitting beside me. I grew up hearing about these stories of my parents, their stories of survival and how they narrowly avoided death. Unfortunately, many members of my family did not survive. Three of my grandparents who were either killed or died as a result of the Holocaust. But I can say that with this history, my parents not only survived, but they went on to pursue successful careers in Pittsburgh. They gave us a very normal life, and they were incredibly positive role models. They raised my brother and me with enormous love and a deep appreciation for the opportunities that our great Nation provides and the knowledge that we should never take for granted our safety, security, and our freedom. I carry this legacy, which is an important one, with me always, and as I have told some of you, it is really what has motivated me to public service, for I think that the opportunity to make a difference is incredibly humbling, especially when we consider the kinds of threats that we face today. After 9/11, like so many other Americans, I wanted nothing more than to contribute to the response to this terrible attack on our Nation. After finishing my clerkship on the Supreme Court, I immediately went to work for the Justice Department in August of 2002, where I joined in its counterterrorism and national security mission in positions in both the Criminal Division and later the Deputy Attorney General's Office. With the Nation on high alert for follow-on attacks, I was privileged to work as part of the dedicated team that oversaw all of the country's counterterrorism and national security criminal cases, including those involving the illicit financing of terrorism. Among other positions that I held in the Government, I was also a counselor to the Secretary of Homeland Security, where I had a very similar focus. And then in 2006, I returned to the Justice Department to be Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal Division, where I supervised four major sections, again, touching on the many issues that I will be confronted with should I be confirmed, including just by way of example cybersecurity, human rights money laundering, among other cases. Then in 2009, I joined the private sector, where I gained valuable and practical insights into the compliance issues that financial institutions and other companies face on a regular basis. I am particularly honored to be nominated for this position, which serves such an important function in our national security, foreign policy, and economic apparatus. If confirmed, I will strategically and tactically marshal all of the tools of the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence and will constantly evaluate how to evolve those tools to meet new challenges, and to always be proactive, intelligence driven, and results oriented. I am also very much looking forward to leading the many talented and dedicated career professionals in the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. And, of course, I look forward to working both closely with this Committee and with the interagency to make sure that we are effectively executing those tools in order to meet the objectives that we set for ourselves and for the country. Thank you. Chairman Crapo. Thank you, Ms. Mandelker. Ms. Ricardel. STATEMENT OF MIRA RADIELOVIC RICARDEL, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE UNDER SECRETARY FOR EXPORT ADMINISTRATION, DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Ms. Ricardel. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Senator Brown, Senators of the Committee, it is a distinct privilege and truly humbling experience to come before this Committee to be considered for Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration. I am deeply honored to have been nominated by President Donald Trump and greatly appreciate the confidence that has been placed in me by the President and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross. When I served as legislative assistant to Republican Leader Bob Dole, I did not imagine that the future might hold this opportunity, that one day I would not be preparing questions but answering them. Perhaps my late father might have thought this possible, not only because of his bias toward his daughter, but because he was always optimistic about what was possible in this great Nation--a view that carried him from communist-controlled Croatia via Germany to the United States, with little more than optimism in his pockets. I wish to thank Senator Bob Dole for teaching me so much about leadership, integrity, and fairness. I learned hands-on that building bipartisan coalitions is essential to progress and reaching agreements. This lesson informed how I approached issues as a member of his staff and also how later I approached working within the U.S. Government interagency while serving at the Department of Defense. The ability to understand and balance the equities of U.S. agencies and drive toward solutions that strengthen U.S. national security is vital. The role of the Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration is consequential and one in which I will be able to leverage my experience and skills if confirmed. The Bureau of Industry and Security advances U.S. national security and economic objectives by ably managing and ensuring effective export control systems, supporting treaty compliance, and enforcing sanctions. The Bureau's responsibilities are executed in close cooperation with a wide range of departments and agencies, including the Departments of Treasury, Justice, State, Defense, and Homeland Security. The recent announcement by Secretary Ross of record criminal and civil penalties against ZTE Corporation is the culmination of 6 years of investigation and highlights the crucial functions of the Bureau's Office of Export Enforcement. Last year, the Bureau's Export Administration office processed nearly 33,000 license applications related to dual-use items and items that had previously been on the U.S. Munitions List. The U.S. retains jurisdiction over re-exports of U.S. origin goods abroad; this is an indispensable tool to address the potential diversion of items to our adversaries who might use them against U.S. military forces abroad or in the development of weapons of mass destruction. Important also is that the licenses processed by the Bureau of Industry and Security enable exports of U.S. goods, and these exports mean jobs for American workers. As a former employee of an aerospace company, I can appreciate the impact of exports on jobs. At the same time, the health of the U.S. defense industrial base is imperative, and in that regard, under Secretary Ross' initiative, the Bureau of Industry and Security has launched two investigations on steel and aluminum imports under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. In addition, the Bureau regularly conducts studies on other areas of the U.S. industrial base. Secretary Ross recently said, ``Under President Trump's leadership, we will be aggressively enforcing strong trade policies with the dual purpose of protecting national security and protecting American workers.'' If confirmed, I will act vigorously to enforce U.S. export controls, embargoes, and sanctions, as well as continuously promote and advance policies that support U.S. industries and technologies and the American workers who are the foundation of our industrial base. Mr. Chairman, Senator Brown, and Senators of this Committee, thank you for your consideration of my nomination. I would be pleased to answer any questions the Committee may have. Chairman Crapo. Thank you, Ms. Ricardel. Mr. Billingslea. STATEMENT OF MARSHALL BILLINGSLEA, OF VIRGINIA, TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR TERRORIST FINANCING, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Mr. Billingslea. Thank you. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and members of the Committee, I am honored to appear before you today as the President's nominee for Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing. Senators, at the outset, I thank my family--I introduced my wife, Karen, and my two daughters, Morgan and Elsa--for supporting my decision to accept the President's nomination. These positions require significant family sacrifice, and I could not undertake this without their love and their backing. Unfortunately, my mother and father could not be here today, but I am very happy that my sister, Rachel--who is a career Pentagon official--is present. Rachel and her husband, Craig, who is a chief warrant officer, have collectively served more than 5 years in Afghanistan and Iraq, both together and apart during their marriage, helping keep our Nation safe from the terrorist threat. They are, in my view, Senators, great Americans who have sacrificed much to protect our Nation. By way of background, Rachel and I were born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, as your constituents, Senator Shelby. Our father, Oliver, is the son of a cotton farmer and was, in fact, the first to graduate from college. Our mother, Nancy, Senator Brown, hails from Xenia, Ohio, where I am proud to say that today we have a very large extended family and do family reunions out there when we can. From our parents I learned the value of stoicism and hard work, and I am deeply grateful to them for the sacrifices that they made over the years that have allowed me to be here today. I have had the opportunity over the past weeks to meet with several Members of the Committee, and I greatly appreciate that chance and the opportunity to understand the issues that you feel are most important with respect to the Treasury Department and terrorist financing. And if confirmed, I look forward to working with all Members of the Committee, and with your staff, on this crucial national security issue. There are four brief points that I would like to stress for you this morning with regard to my nomination. First is that I understand the criticality of close, bipartisan working relationships both within the and with Congress. From 1995 to 2001, as the Senior Professional Staff Member for National Security Affairs on the Foreign Relations Committee, I drafted multiple pieces of sanctions legislation, most of which were subsequently enacted into law with overwhelming bipartisan support. The focus of these statutes was, and remains today, to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missile systems and to disrupt foreign terrorist and trafficking networks. Second, I appreciate how important are financial and economic tools in the fight against terrorism. After 9/11, I served as the Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict. Disruption of the terror network's financing operations featured heavily in our day-to- day operations and our planning. And, in fact, working very closely with multiple Treasury offices, this Committee had not yet created the position to which I have been nominated. That was done a few years later. I established the first DOD Counter Threat Finance cell, with a detailee from Treasury playing a critical role. Third, ``buy-in'' from friendly Nations is crucial to the work of the office. At NATO, from 2003 to 2006, I served as our Assistant Secretary General for Defense Investment, and my time at NATO taught me the importance of forging close working relationships with officials from across the Alliance. Many of these officials remain in office today overseas and I believe will be in a position to assist the United States in many of the various initiatives that are either underway or which need to be undertaken. Finally, disrupting terrorist finance and illicit trade requires working closely with the private sector, as the Chairman mentioned in his opening remarks. Since 2009, I have served as a managing director at Deloitte, where I lead the Federal Business Intelligence Services group. We perform due diligence into third parties on behalf of both Federal departments agencies--the counterintelligence community, for example--but also for commercial clients, and the purpose of this is to protect against doing business with entities accused of corruption, of narcotics trafficking, of money laundering, of child or slave labor activities, or other worrisome matters. So I bring close working relationships across the global financial services sector, and I will leverage those connections to advance our national security agenda. In conclusion, Chairman and Ranking Member Brown, I greatly appreciate the opportunity afforded by your Committee to appear before you today as your consider my nomination. Over the past 22 years, I have had the privilege of working closely with the Department of the Treasury on multiple terrorist financing and financial crimes issues, and I believe I bring a unique combination of both legislative as well as executive branch and private sector experience to the role. If confirmed by the Senate, I will work very closely with this Committee to drive the policies and actions necessary to disrupt illicit finance and terror networks. Thank you, sir. Chairman Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Billingslea. Mr. Tarbert. STATEMENT OF HEATH P. TARBERT, OF MARYLAND, TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY, INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND DEVELOPMENT, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY Mr. Tarbert. Chairman Crapo, Ranking Member Brown, and distinguished Members of the Committee, I am honored to appear before you today. I am humbled by the confidence the President has shown in me by nominating me to be the next Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for International Markets and Development. I appear before you today with full recognition of the serious responsibilities associated with the position. If confirmed as Assistant Secretary, I would lead nine of the Treasury Department's offices charged with protecting and supporting foreign investment in the United States, reducing global financial instability, fostering international economic development, and managing key global challenges. I believe that my professional background and desire to serve our country will enable me to perform this role and work to keep our country safe and prosperous. While growing up in Baltimore, my family emphasized hard work, education, and the importance of public service at every level of Government. Both of my grandfathers fought in World War II--one with the Army in Europe, one with the Navy in the Pacific. One of my uncles was a police officer, another a firefighter. My father went to night school to become an accountant and eventually served as Comptroller of the Maryland Port Administration and of the Baltimore County Community College System. Although my father passed away after a courageous battle with cancer, his commitment to public service remains a guiding example for me. Each of my adult guests today is or has been a public servant. My mother retired as a child support enforcement officer, my sister-in-law is a public school teacher, and my brother just completed a term as deputy mayor of Baltimore for economic and neighborhood development. Finally, my wife, Kate, and I met clerking for the U.S. Court of Appeals here in Washington. Now a full-time mom to our two young sons, she has served in the Justice Department and as a law clerk to the Chief Justice of the United States. I have been inspired by their dedication to public service as well. I myself have had the privilege of serving in all three branches of the Federal Government. One of my most enjoyable jobs in public service was working as Special Counsel to this Committee back in 2009 and 2010. During that period, I had the privilege of working closely with Banking Committee staff members and legislative assistants on both sides of the aisle on a number of important international economic issues. And it was especially an honor to serve under your leadership, Senator Shelby. Since leaving the Banking Committee staff, I have practiced as a regulatory compliance lawyer, with a chief focus on international markets. In this role, I have assisted public and private sector institutions from outside the United States make investments in our country that created jobs for working Americans and their families. I have also helped financial services companies around the world comply with regulatory and supervisory measures intended to make them safer and sounder, thereby reducing or eliminating the possibility of future taxpayer bailouts. In addition, I have designed compliance programs aimed at detecting and preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. If confirmed as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, I hope to work closely with this Committee, others in the Senate and House of Representatives, and my colleagues in the Administration to carry out my responsibilities. Thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today. I am happy to answer any questions you may have. Chairman Crapo. Thank you, Mr. Tarbert. For my 5 minutes of questioning, I would like to give each one of you about a minute to just respond briefly to me about what you see as your top one or two priorities in assuming office. What would you use your minute for to discuss this? We will start with you, Ms. Mandelker. Ms. Mandelker. Thank you, Chairman. I will try to fit it in in a minute. I will have, of course, many priorities. But first and foremost, I want to focus very immediately on the areas that pose the greatest threats. That is, of course, North Korea, Iran, ISIS, Syria, Russia. I will immediately ask for a briefing from the folks in the Intelligence Office that I will be supervising so I can understand where we are in intelligence in the area of threat finance. I will also immediately want to gather all folks from all of the components of TFI so I can understand, number one, what are we doing in any particular area, what do we propose to the interagency, what are our gaps, our vulnerabilities, and how can we increase pressure using the wide array of tools, not just sanctions, of course--FinCEN has a number of tools. TFFC is very engaged internationally. And I will want to put myself right in the middle of that so I can lead them in the right way and continue to think innovatively and strategically and tactically as to how we can further our national security interests. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Ms. Ricardel. Ms. Ricardel. Thank you. Through the use of effective export controls and enforcement, we need to be sure that we are preventing the export of technology and goods to terrorists and stemming the flow of weapons of mass destruction, while at the same time protecting U.S. critical technologies and competitiveness. I think it is very important as an early step to see whether there are sufficient resources allocated to do these important functions, to assess whether there are potential gaps that could be filled with stricter restrictions, for example, on the export of goods, at the same time assessing the state of the industrial base, getting up to speed on what the internal assessments are currently on critical areas. And I look forward to also consulting with the Committee on areas of concern, if confirmed, to see what will be on your priority list. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Mr. Billingslea. Mr. Billingslea. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was in the Pentagon the day they slammed the plane into the building, and I think if you had told me at the time that we would today and potentially my daughters would be facing the threat of terrorism, I am not sure I would have believed you at the time. The reason I have agreed to accept this nomination and come before you today is because I am absolutely committed. We live in a very dangerous world today, and I believe we have to apply every potential source of leverage to deal with both terrorist threats as well as State sponsors of terrorism, as well as Nation States who are engaged in unacceptable behaviors. And so I share Ms. Mandelker's priorities, and disrupting these networks will be my absolute and unrelenting focus, if confirmed. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Mr. Tarbert. Mr. Tarbert. If confirmed, Mr. Chairman, I believe my top priority would be to ensure that the Office of Investment Security and the CFIUS process more generally has the resources and tools it needs to perform the function that Congress intended it to. Chairman Crapo. All right. Thank you very much. In fact, you all kept within the time limits. Senator Brown, I am going to yield a minute back. Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since my time is short, I would appreciate a yes or no answer from each of you on a handful of questions. If you would like to expand your answer, feel free, but please do it in writing, if you would. And remember, you are under oath. I will start with you, Ms. Mandelker, and just work my way down. Do you commit to reply to every oversight or other letter and request for information from me and from all other Members of the Banking Committee in a timely manner? Ms. Mandelker. Yes, I do. Ms. Ricardel. Yes, I do. Mr. Billingslea. Yes, sir. Mr. Tarbert. Yes. Senator Brown. Thank you. Do you commit to alert the Committee of any attempt by the White House to interfere with, to stall, or to change responses from your Department for oversight information that has been requested by Congress? Do you commit to alert the Committee of any attempt like that? Ms. Mandelker. Well, Senator, I commit to working very closely with this Committee, and should any issue like that arise, I would think that we would have some consultation. Senator Brown. That is not quite a yes. Ms. Mandelker. Well, I would, of course, want to consult with the Department---- Senator Brown. If the White House tries to interfere or change responses by your Department, would you notify this Committee? Ms. Mandelker. Well, Senator, I would work very closely with this Committee on a wide range of issues. I would want to consult with the Secretary in any such case, and I will commit to doing that. Ms. Ricardel. Senator, I do not anticipate that this kind of an issue would come up, that there would be any interference in that way. I would execute, if confirmed, my duties within the authorities of the Bureau. Senator Brown. Mr. Billingslea. Mr. Billingslea. Senator, as the Under Secretary nominee has indicated, within those parameters, yes, sir. Mr. Tarbert. Again, within those parameters, yes, sir. Senator Brown. Also, I would appreciate a yes or no on this bit more complicated question but one answerable that way. Unlike past Administrations that you have worked in, senior Government officials in this Administration have not divested themselves of many of their assets, some overseas, some with international partners, some unclear as to who the ultimate beneficial owner of an interest might be. The question is: Do you think it would be in the interest of those officials as well as the offices you will head to undertake a process to ensure that foreign entanglements are benign with respect to the laws you will enforce on terrorism, on money laundering, on sanctions, on CFIUS, and the like? Ms. Mandelker. Ms. Mandelker. Senator, again, I would have to consult with the ethics officials at the Department and elsewhere. I do not think that we should--I do not have any issues of that sort, and I would agree that---- Senator Brown. But many in the Administration do, correct? Ms. Mandelker. I cannot--I cannot---- Senator Brown. But you know the answer to that. Ms. Mandelker. Well, I cannot weigh in on that question. I have not seen their financials, of course. Senator Brown. But you read a lot. OK. Ms. Ricardel. Senator, I can speak for myself. My ethics letter reflects that I am going to divest of any assets that I have that could pose a conflict of interest, and I do not have insights into other people's personal finances. Mr. Billingslea. Senator, as my Committee questionnaire indicates, I am divesting, including going above and beyond what the Office of Government Ethics required. Mr. Tarbert. Senator, I plan to fully comply with all applicable ethical laws and regulations, and I would assume other public officials will as well. Senator Brown. I think you know from my question I am not challenging or concerned with the ethics of the four of you. I am concerned with ethics of others in the Administration that you have all read widely about and, frankly, I think perhaps made some of you not so certain perhaps that you wanted to sign up with this Administration. I will leave it at that. Ms. Mandelker, I am sure you have read the papers today. Can you tell me if an allied Nation in the Middle East or elsewhere shares sensitive intelligence with us on condition that they will control the sharing or release of it, and the U.S. then shares that information without permission of the country that originated it, do you think that would harm our future ability to gather similar intelligence from that ally and from others because it would undermine their confidence in our willingness to protect such information? Ms. Mandelker. Senator, that is a difficult question for me to answer. I would have to understand the underlying facts and circumstances and speak with the individuals who are experts in how we do share information with other countries. Senator Brown. I am not asking what might have happened in the Oval Office when the U.S. President asked the American media to leave and stayed there with the old Soviet news agency TASS. I am not asking about the specifics because we do not know for sure yet exactly what was said. But I am asking if, in fact, an allied Nation which shared sensitive intelligence with us on the condition that we not share it or release it without their approval, if they did it, would that harm our future ability to get information and gather similar intelligence from that ally or other allies? Ms. Mandelker. Again, Senator, in the absence of understanding any particular set of facts and circumstances, it is difficult for me to answer that question. Of course, we should be careful in how we share information with our allies and elsewhere, but I cannot answer a hypothetical when I do not understand all the complexities that are involved. Senator Brown. All right. Thank you. Chairman Crapo. Senator Shelby. Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe this is a great group, the four of you eminently qualified for your jobs here. I have a few questions, and I will start with you, Ms. Mandelker. You have been nominated to be the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. That is at Treasury. Tell us and share it with the American people who are watching how important the war on terrorism--that we win this war, that we contain it and try to destroy it and the connection to financial intelligence. Ms. Mandelker. Thank you for that question, Senator. It is, of course, incredibly important. It is what I dedicated myself to when I joined the Justice Department in 2002. I think that the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence has tremendous tools which have been used very successfully since the office was stood up in 2004, and it is one that I would dedicate myself to every day. Senator Shelby. Ms. Ricardel, you have had great experience in the private sector but also starting out with the Majority Leader here in the U.S. Senate, Senator Dole. What do you believe will be your biggest challenge as Under Secretary of Commerce for Export Administration? Will it be protecting American business? Or what will it be? Ms. Ricardel. Thank you, Senator, and I appreciated the opportunity to meet with you the other day. I believe that strong national security requires a strong defense industrial base. So in a way, I do not see the question as either/or, protecting defense business or protecting our national security, because we need strong defense capabilities, and that is what our defense industry brings us with the right guidance. Senator Shelby. Mr. Billingslea, you bring broad experience into your nomination as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorist Financing. Of course, a lot of this overlaps financial intelligence and what we do with it. But terrorists cannot go very far in today's modern world without financing, can they? They have got to have it one or the other. So your role has got to be central to our fight against terrorism all over the world globally. Mr. Billingslea. Thank you, Senator. Yes, I believe very strongly in the position that this Committee and the Congress has established and its value in supporting the Under Secretary, particularly in the diplomatic arena, engaging with Nations across the spectrum. If I may just very quickly add that we have come a long way--I remember the very first time I heard of a hawala and tried to understand what that was back 15 years ago. Our country has come a very long way in our ability to combat this kind of illicit finance. Senator Shelby. But the challenge goes on. Mr. Billingslea. The challenge goes on. Senator Shelby. The terrorists are very resourceful and very smart in a lot of ways, are they not? Mr. Billingslea. They are thinking--they are very thinking and creative people. Senator Shelby. And they are thinking in tomorrow's world through the Internet and everything that goes with it. Mr. Billingslea. Yes, sir. Senator Shelby. And that is our challenge. Mr. Billingslea. Absolutely, sir. Senator Shelby. Mr. Tarbert, you are no stranger to this Committee as you worked here before and you did a lot of great work. We are glad to have you back. What do you believe is going to be your biggest challenge? Mr. Tarbert. If confirmed, I think the biggest challenge would be really making sure that no investment gets approved as part of the CFIUS process that has any unresolved national security concerns, so to really make sure that there are no unresolved national security concerns before CFIUS certifies it to Congress. Senator Shelby. How do you balance that with the concerns of not exporting things that are so important to our national security with ordinary commerce? Isn't that part of the---- Mr. Tarbert. The test right now focuses solely on national security, and so as I read the statute, it does not include considerations of commerce. But what I would say is that the very fact that CFIUS sits in the Treasury Department--the idea is we want to encourage foreign investment, and the only exception to that is where there is a national security issue. Senator Shelby. Do you believe that the CFIUS statute as now written, which we were all involved in on this Committee, is sufficient for your work? Mr. Tarbert. It is a great question, Senator Shelby. I understand there are discussions now about whether that is the case. There is also a GAO report due out. So, if confirmed, I would obviously want to ensure that the CFIUS process, first of all, is doing the job that Congress intended, but, second, whether there are any gaps. Senator Shelby. Would you work with this Committee on any deficiencies that are brought up and maybe we need to address? Mr. Tarbert. If confirmed, I absolutely would, Senator. Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Senator Reed. Senator Reed. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for your willingness to serve. I want to follow up with a variation on one of Senator Brown's questions, and I will go down the line. Are you aware of any formal or informal guidance from the White House that urges limiting or not responding to legitimate oversight letters from Members of Congress, particularly minority Members of Congress? We will begin with Ms. Mandelker. Ms. Mandelker. No, Senator, I am not. Senator Reed. Ma'am. Ms. Ricardel. No, sir, I am not. Mr. Billingslea. Senator, I am not. Senator Reed. Thank you. Mr. Tarbert. No, Senator Reed. Senator Reed. Thank you very much. Mr. Tarbert, in 2012, the U.S. Joint Economic Security Review Commission issued a report that essentially said a lot of the investment by Chinese companies is based on strategic rather than purely economic interests because of subsidies they receive from the Government, because many of them are entities of the Government in most respects. If this is the case, and if they are doing this, should we look again at our laws with respect to evaluating Chinese acquisitions of U.S. interests in U.S. companies? Mr. Tarbert. I think it is an excellent question, Senator. My understanding is that there are discussions now about pending legislation as well as a GAO report that is coming out, and I think one of the questions that was listed is the one that you are addressing. I do know that currently as part of the CFIUS process, which was required by this Committee in FINSA, State-owned enterprises automatically trigger a presumption of an investigation. But, if confirmed, I commit to working with this Committee to discuss this issue and others. Senator Reed. And you would sort of take the material that is being developed now and use that to advise us on statutory changes that might be necessary or you would use your current authority to try to resist these types of acquisitions? Mr. Tarbert. If confirmed, I would imagine I would do both. Senator Reed. Thank you. Ms. Mandelker, China is providing significant support to North Korea, and they are doing it through financial means; they are doing it through their banking system. How would you propose to disrupt this trade, which, if we do not, could lead us to a very serious confrontation on the peninsula? Ms. Mandelker. Thank you for that question, Senator. I share your concerns. I think it is very important to engage very proactively with China to curb the support that is going to North Korea. I note, of course, that Secretary Tillerson, the President, and others in the Administration have engaged in a very active dialog with the Chinese, and not just with China but also, of course, with other countries. In fact, over the weekend there was a call for all countries to enhance their sanctions regimes when it comes to curbing the North Korean threat. I think that we have to be very active in how we track, trace, and ultimately interdict illegal assets that are going to North Korea. We have to be very active in our enforcement of illicit actors that are violating our sanctions. We have to be very active in how we track down the intelligence, and we have to constantly consider what levers of pressure we are going to apply if other countries do not, in fact, abide by our call to further isolate North Korea. Senator Reed. Thank you very much. Ms. Ricardel, there have been changes recently in the items that can be sold, basically moving some items from the U.S. Munitions List, the State Department's, the Commerce- administered list. Do you have any comments on those changes and any perspective about how you would enforce them? Ms. Ricardel. Senator, thank you. I am aware of the things that have been moved from the U.S. Munitions List, and my understanding is that there is still a vigorous export control enforcement process, whether it is on the Munitions List or on the Commerce Control List. Certainly, dual-use technologies are often challenging, but that is why there are controls not just on what the end use is, but also end users. Senator Reed. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Senator Tillis. Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you all for being here. I appreciate the three of you that were able to come into my office, and I am sorry, Ms. Ricardel, we were not able to meet together. But Robert Wilkie speaks very highly of you, and his opinion means a lot to me. So I thank you for being here and congratulations to the family. Ms. Ricardel. Thank you, Senator. Senator Tillis. I have a general question, and it relates to the current--the person in an acting capacity--we have in acting capacity. We are looking to confirm people to move into the organization. Can you very quickly down the line describe why you think it is problematic to maybe delay the confirmations and what that would prevent the head of the organizations that you are going to be confirmed to, how that would affect the day-to-day operations, either morale or execution? Mr. Tarbert, in your particular case, acting on the recommendations that come from the GAO? So just down the line why you would emphasize the importance of an expedient confirmation in your roles? Ms. Mandelker. Senator, I know from my prior experience having worked in the Government that it is very important to have your political appointees confirmed. The authority that somebody speaks with once they have been confirmed by the Senate is much greater. Your ability to engage in the right way with the international community is very much heightened when you have a confirmed person in that position. And I think that the career professionals within any department are looking for direction and leadership, and they want to know what their next steps are, where is the office going to be taken under the leadership of the new appointee, and it is very important to have that person in there as quickly as possible so that they can carry on and get to the--I am sure they are all dedicated and working very hard, but they can get to the business of understanding what the direction is going to be. Senator Tillis. Ms. Ricardel. Ms. Ricardel. Thank you. I would agree with my colleague's assessment on the internal and external aspects of this. Also, policymaking tends not to move forward when you have people in an acting capacity. Senator Tillis. Is it fair to say that we have some open switches on policy that we need to move forward on? Ms. Ricardel. Yes, sir. Senator Tillis. And every day delayed is a delay in policy that has probably got bipartisan support? Ms. Ricardel. I would agree with that assessment. Senator Tillis. Thank you. Mr. Billingslea. Senator, on top of that, events are moving ahead, and we have a worsening situation in North Korea, to name just one flash point, where incoming Administrations are in the process of--you know, they always contend with new issues, and this Administration is going through a review on a variety of issues. To the extent that this Committee trusts our judgment, it might be better to have us involved in those discussions sooner rather than later. Mr. Tarbert. I will not repeat all the things that my colleagues said, all of which I think go to your question. Specifically with respect to CFIUS, Congress enacted FINSA in 2007 for the main reason of making sure that there was a Senate-confirmed appointee who would certify the transactions once approved. So that is an example of where specifically Congress had intended there to be a political appointee. Senator Tillis. So it sounds like to me consensus that a lot of--the threats are increasing every day, and you are going to be in very, very important roles that either affect our national security or homeland security or our economic relationships with other--in a global economy. So this delay, it seems to me, would not be healthy for the areas that you are being tasked with trying to improve our situation, our safety and security. I do not see anyone that wants to question that. I want to go to maybe a specific question, and, Heath, this is back to you, and it relates to CFIUS. You know, we are in an increasingly complex world where we want to attract global investment, but sometimes that global investment could wade into an area where we have to assess national security interests. How do we modernize or how do we get to a point--it could be about the data that a global investor may have access to. It could be about trade secrets, other things. How do you balance that and make sure that we have got a modern view of how that works? Because we are in a global data environment and economy so---- Mr. Tarbert. It is an excellent question, Senator. I probably do not have a fulsome answer for you now, but I think you raise an excellent point, which is that we want to make sure for those foreign investments that do not raise actual national security issues that they are certified in a fast process so we can have foreign investment in the United States that creates jobs for American workers and families. Then, of course, we want to make sure that for those transactions that do raise genuine national security issues, that we take the time we need to really evaluate them. Senator Tillis. Ms. Ricardel, I was going to ask you a similar question, but my time has expired, and I admire the way the Chair keeps us on time. Chairman Crapo. I appreciate it. Thank you. Senator Menendez. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The nominees we are considering today are critical components of our national security and foreign policy, particularly in combating terrorism and implementing what I consider to be a peaceful tool of foreign diplomacy, including sanctions. And I would agree with the answer you gave Senator Tillis, Ms. Ricardel, in that had we not held up Adam Szubin, that being Republicans holding up Adam Szubin, for a critical position, there is a difference between someone who is acting or someone who has the full authority of the position. And so I wish that my colleagues had had the same focus and attention and commitment as they seem to have now. But at least it is a good moment to move to the understanding of the importance of these positions. Ms. Mandelker, if you are confirmed, you will oversee a wide range of financial tools that the United States strategically employs to target the finances, assets, laundering office of terrorist networks, dictators, other actors who facilitate nefarious activities against U.S. interests. I have often been not only the advocate but the architect of those sanctions in Iran, Russia, and North Korea. And what I want to hear from you is: Are you committed to robustly enforcing the law in all of its elements as it relates to these sanctions, these different financial consequences that we create on actors that are adverse to the national interests and security of the United States? Ms. Mandelker. Absolutely, Senator. That is one of the primary reasons I took on this job, because I am committed to robustly enforcing those authorities. Senator Menendez. And you will not only be someone who will be an implementer of the sanctions that Congress passes into law or that the President by Executive action does, but also you will be at a table in interagency processes in which there will be a role for you to be an advocate. When it is appropriate, will you be an advocate when we are looking to have a peaceful diplomacy tool against an adversary who defies the national interests of the United States? Will you be an advocate of using these different tools, sanctions, financial limitations, and whatnot, in that context? Ms. Mandelker. Yes, Senator, one of my primary roles will be to be that advocate within the---- Senator Menendez. Can you commit to the Committee--the Office of Foreign Assets Control, which is an important office within the TFI, we have given it an overwhelming amount of work to do. They do exceptional work. I do not always agree with their decisions, but they do exceptional work. And so the question is--I am not sure that anybody has analyzed whether or not OFAC actually has the resources to do the work that is necessary to make sure that sanctions are enforced, because any law without enforcement is meaningless. Will you commit to the Committee upon confirmation to go ahead and review and understand whether they have the assets? And if they do, that is fine. But if they do not, that you will be an advocate for increasing their assets in order for us to see the law implemented? Ms. Mandelker. Yes, I will commit to doing that as well. Senator Menendez. Thank you very much. Mr. Tarbert, I am seriously concerned about--I want foreign investment in the United States, but I am seriously concerned when that foreign investment potentially undermines national security questions. The reality is with Russia we have seen escalated attacks on the United States, particularly in its cyberwarfare against the United States. I think that it would be naive to approach any potential acquisition, for example, by Russia of critical national security infrastructure when they have already demonstrated their affinity for executing cyberattacks to disrupt energy grids in Ukraine, using the Russian oil and gas industry to manipulate prices in Eastern European economies. We have seen that they are willing to do this in different parts of the world. Last year, due to increasing financial pressure as a result of Venezuela's financial crisis, PDVSA, the State-owned oil company, pledged nearly 50 percent of Citgo shares to Rosneft, which is a Russia State-owned oil company, in exchange for a loan. Not only do they have that 50 percent potentially if PDVSA defaults, the Venezuelan oil company, but they may have purchased additional shares on the open market, which puts them as a majority shareholder. They own Citgo in the United States which has 48 U.S. petroleum product terminals, three refineries in Texas, Louisiana, Illinois, nine pipelines throughout the country. Do you consider that possibility of Russia owning Citgo a clear element of what we should be looking at CFIUS to ensure that the national interests of the United States are not compromised? Mr. Tarbert. Senator, I will refrain from discussing any particular transaction, but what I would say is that, if confirmed, any covered transaction would be examined thoroughly for any national security concerns. Senator Menendez. Well, is this going to be the possibility of an instance of first impression, because we have already a foreign company, PDVSA, a Venezuela-owned company, owning Citgo. Now you would see the possibility of Russia owning that company as a result of a default of the debt obligation. And I would hope that if you are to be confirmed, you will make sure that we are ensuring that the critical infrastructure of the United States does not fall in the hands of a foreign Government that has shown its hostility to the United States. Mr. Tarbert. If confirmed, I would take all action as appropriate to ensure our national security interests are protected, including relying upon our intelligence community for reports on Nations that have hostile intentions. Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for your service and for your past service. You all have very impressive resumes. If you could answer my questions in 30 seconds or less, I would be grateful. We only have 5 minutes. Ms. Mandelker--am I saying that right? Ms. Mandelker. Yes. Senator Kennedy. Is Iran cheating with respect to our nuclear agreement? Ms. Mandelker. Well, Senator, as I am sure you know, there is an ongoing review that is underway within the Administration now to evaluate the JCPOA and our Iran policy. I am not part of that process at this point. I would look forward to learning more about the answer to your question, should I be confirmed. But I do not have--I am not privy to the intelligence today. I am very concerned about the activity that we are seeing in Iran. Senator Kennedy. OK. That was pretty evasive. That is good. Do you think the International Atomic Energy Agency is doing a good job in terms of transparency and telling us what is going on? Ms. Mandelker. Again, I am not privy to the intelligence. I am not in the Administration---- Senator Kennedy. I get it. I get it. Mr. Billingslea, does President Vladimir Putin have assets in the United States? Mr. Billingslea. Senator, I do not know that. Senator Kennedy. Who would know that in Government, either held in his name or in a nominee's name? Mr. Billingslea. That certainly is something that I would hope the intelligence community is investigating for the purpose of understanding where assets are held, not only in the United States but potentially in offshore accounts elsewhere in the world. Senator Kennedy. But let us start with the United States. You have had a lot of experience in Government. Do you believe that the U.S. Government has that information? Mr. Billingslea. I do not know if they have that information, Senator. Senator Kennedy. I know that, but I am asking you, based on your experience, if you think we likely do. Mr. Billingslea. I genuinely do not know. It depends on how clever he has been at hiding his assets. Senator Kennedy. All right. Well, let me ask you this: Tell me one more time where that information could be obtained if somebody had it. Mr. Billingslea. I would direct that question to Senator Coats, DNI Coats, the Director of National Intelligence. Senator Kennedy. OK. Mr. Tarbert, you have got a fine young man here. He has been very good. Can you give me your thoughts about Glass-Steagall? Mr. Tarbert. My understanding is that the Administration is considering a 21st century version of the Glass-Steagall Act. I do not have any insight into what that is. I know Members of this body have introduced legislation of perhaps a similar nature. I do not have any views at this point, but I look---- Senator Kennedy. You do not have any opinion at all about it? You have written extensively. What do you think of---- Mr. Tarbert. Well, my---- Senator Kennedy. Good idea or bad idea? I am not asking you about the Administration. I am asking you. Mr. Tarbert. What I would say is that I believe that Federal deposit insurance should not subsidize nonbanking activities. Now, that is the current law of the land. It should not be controversial. I know there is a debate as to whether it has, in fact, been achieved. Glass-Steagall is obviously a prophylactic measure to address that, but it is not the only measure. So I look forward to seeing--I am not sure in my position, if confirmed, I would have any role in domestic financial legislation. Senator Kennedy. I know, but I have read your resume. You have got deep experience in this. Ms. Ricardel--am I saying that right? Ms. Ricardel. Yes, Senator. Senator Kennedy. Could you give me your thoughts, if you have any, about the Belt and Road Initiative? Is it going to work? Is it worth the money? Is it something that we should be concerned about in terms of geopolitical effects? Ms. Ricardel. Senator, I have only read some of the news reports. I would certainly want to look into it further, if confirmed, and see what intelligence we have on what other internal information we may have on it. Senator Kennedy. Do you know if Vladimir Putin has assets in the United States? [Laughter.] Ms. Ricardel. No, sir, I do not. Senator Kennedy. Do you know who I could talk to? Ms. Ricardel. I think my colleague directing you to Director Coats---- Senator Kennedy. He was not asked that question---- Ms. Ricardel. ODNI Director Coats would probably be the right place to start. Senator Kennedy. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Senator Tester. Senator Warren. He has offered to let me go ahead. Chairman Crapo. Senator Warren. Senator Warren. Thank you, Senator Tester, and thank you, Senator Warner. I appreciate it. So there are many questions about disturbing ties between the Trump administration and the Russian Government, and thanks to pressure from Congress, the Administration is currently enforcing sanctions on Russia. But I remain concerned that Russian influence could cause President Trump to roll back these sanctions. Russia's behavior has not changed. In fact, last week, the Commander of Cyber Command publicly told the Armed Services Committee that he had seen no reduction in Russian cyberattacks. We know that Russia hacked into the American and French systems to try to influence the outcome of national elections. We also know that Russia is still illegally occupying Ukraine territory. Ms. Mandelker, as far as you know, based on public information, is Russia still engaging in cyberattacks and violating Ukraine's territory? Ms. Mandelker. Well, Senator, ODNI Coats testified about that last week. Senator Warren. So is your answer yes? Ms. Mandelker. According to his testimony, they are still engaging in problematic cyberactivity. I, of course, do not have access to---- Senator Warren. So the answer is yes---- Ms. Mandelker. ----the intelligence myself. Senator Warren. OK. The answer is yes? Ms. Mandelker. According to ODNI Coats---- Senator Warren. OK, according to all the information available. OK. So let me just ask then, should we roll back our existing Russia sanctions without meaningful changes in Russia's behavior? Ms. Mandelker. No, Senator, I do not think so. Secretary Tillerson has spoken to that particular issue, and I---- Senator Warren. So you will strongly support keeping those sanctions in place unless Russia changes its behavior? Ms. Mandelker. Yes. Senator Warren. Good. If you are confirmed to this job, we are going to expect you to be tough on Russia. The nuclear deal between the United States, five other world powers, and Iran imposed limits on Iran's nuclear program and placed it under rigorous monitoring and inspections. Iran receives relief from economic sanctions as long as it remains in compliance with the agreement. Now, Donald Trump threatened to rip up the Iran deal, but last month, the Trump administration certified that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal, which is required for Iran to get sanctions relief and to keep the agreement intact. Ms. Mandelker, if confirmed, you are going to be in charge of the Iran sanctions enforcement at Treasury. So do you agree with the Trump administration's recent conclusion that Iran is complying with the nuclear deal? Ms. Mandelker. Senator, I would defer to the Secretary of State on that. I do not have any reason to doubt it, but, of course, I am not in the Administration. I do not have access to---- Senator Warren. OK. But the Secretary of State has said, so you would at least presumptively say yes and agree? That is what you are telling me? Ms. Mandelker. Correct. Senator Warren. I just want to make sure. So we expect Iran to live up to its commitments in the nuclear agreement. My question is: Should the United States do the same? Ms. Mandelker. Well, Senator, as I think you know, the Administration is undertaking a 90-day review of the Iran policy and the JCPOA. As a general matter, I think the United States should live up to its commitments when it enters into international agreements. Senator Warren. And is there some reason that you think there should be an exception in the case of Iran, if Iran is living up to its part of the agreement, that the United States should somehow back away from its part of the agreement? Ms. Mandelker. Again, that very subject is part of the 90- day review, but as a general matter, to the extent that we have agreements, I think that the United States should live up to those agreements. Senator Warren. And that would also apply in the case of Iran? Ms. Mandelker. Yes. Senator Warren. All right. Thank you. You know, the Iran nuclear deal is not perfect, but it is still our only realistic option to peacefully prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. If the United States tears up the deal, we isolate ourselves instead of Iran, and we empower the Iranian hardliners who reject engagement with the West. I believe that makes the world less safe instead of more safe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you again, Senator Tester and Senator Warner. And I would note I finished a minute early. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. Senator Cotton. Senator Cotton. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for your testimony today and for your willingness to serve your country, once again in many cases, and thank you all to the family sitting behind you for supporting your family members for going back into Government. Ms. Mandelker, Senator Warren was just asking you about preserving Russian sanctions. Many of us over the last 2 or 4 years have advocated for even tougher sanctions against Russia. The Obama administration opposed those. Do you think there is room to add additional sanctions to Russia if the product review that is being undertaken now concludes that that would be in the United States' interests? Ms. Mandelker. Well, if the policy review that is being undertaken comes to that conclusion, of course, as the Under Secretary of the Treasury, if confirmed, it would be my responsibility to lay out those options. And, of course, there is always room for enhanced capabilities. Senator Cotton. Enhanced sanctions capabilities that the Obama administration refused to pursue for 8 years. Ms. Mandelker. Well, I cannot speak to the Obama administration, but I can assure you that I will lay out all of the potential options on the table. Senator Cotton. I can. Mr. Tarbert, I want to talk briefly about CFIUS and its role. What is its primary purpose, to promote investment into this country from abroad or to protect our security? Mr. Tarbert. To protect our security. Senator Cotton. When the call is close, do you view that the tie, so to speak, should go to protecting our security? Mr. Tarbert. The test by statute is no unresolved national security issues. So if there is a member agency that has a problem, then there is no tie. That trumps. Senator Cotton. It is an interesting statutory test, isn't it, that all issues have to be resolved in favor of protecting our security before you get to the actual business case for the investment? Mr. Tarbert. Yes, and I would say there is not even a business case for the investment. It is presumed---- Senator Cotton. But speaking colloquially. Mr. Tarbert. Yes, absolutely. Senator Cotton. Is there room or need for reforming the CFIUS statute and process? Mr. Tarbert. If confirmed, that is something I would like to consider and look into. I do not know whether statutory changes are warranted or whether it is a matter of regulatory change or even just simply a resource issue. But that is an issue that I commit to studying, if confirmed. Senator Cotton. Ms. Ricardel, you look like you might have something to add? Ms. Ricardel. No, I do not. I do think it is a very important statute, CFIUS. Commerce has an input into the process and there is a lot of legislative input and legislation regarding new ideas, which, if confirmed, I would look at closely. Senator Cotton. Thank you. I would simply say that while we want to promote investment in this country and there are many, many legitimate reasons why foreigners want to invest directly into the largest and most dynamic economy in the world, our foremost concern obviously has to be the protection of our national security. Ms. Mandelker, I want to speak in general about the offshore wealth protection and management industry. There are many countries, or you might call them ``statelets'', oftentimes in the Pacific or in the Caribbean or around the waters of Europe, that specialize in helping people hide or at least obscure the origins of certain kinds of wealth. Many times these are used by nefarious people for nefarious purposes--dictators and their families who are stealing national wealth, oligarchs, criminals, terrorists, deadbeat husbands who do not want to reveal assets to the wives they are about to divorce. But at the same time, there is a legitimate business purpose for American corporations in particular who are dealing in the global economy to create corporate entities overseas. How could we as a Congress balance those two competing interests by making sure that American businesses can remain competitive in the global market, but at the same time trying to get after some of the illicit monies that are being hidden in lands that oftentimes have more bank accounts than they have residents? Ms. Mandelker. Well, Senator, of course, my responsibility will be to make sure that we understand who the beneficial owners are, how can we identify who the illicit actors are. Of course, I would be happy to study that issue further. I think it is--you point out that it is an important balance, and I would want to review that with not just the Treasury Department. It is really a much wider question that would also go to the Justice Department and other agencies. Senator Cotton. It goes to Treasury and the IRS as well. It is a difficult question because American businesses do have their legitimate reasons to have dealings in some of these overseas territories. But at the same time, I think it is fair to say that there are a lot of nefarious characters around the world and some Americans here who are hiding assets from spouses about to be divorced, for instance, who are able to move billions and sometimes even trillions of dollars in aggregate around the world. And I think it is something that this Congress should address, and it is something that we need to address because we do not want them to take advantage of the U.S. financial system or to buildup the kind of entrenched domestic interests that you have seen now in some Western European capitals that influence the policy of those capitals toward certain countries. So thank you for that commitment. Thank you all again for your testimony and for your willingness to serve. Chairman Crapo. Thank you. And back to you, Senator Tester. Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you having this hearing today, and I appreciate how you run this Committee. We have got four appointees here today for important positions that appear to be well qualified, and I want to thank you for being willing to serve in these capacities. It has occurred to me this is not the first time we have had four well-qualified people. It may be the first time we have had four well qualified, by the way, because usually it is one at a time. But it does take me back to a time when I would wonder if we would have this hearing at all if we had a different President that had just fired the Director of the FBI apparently for doing an investigation, maybe another President or not, and a President who has just been accused of transferring top secret information to a foe of ours. And I just wonder if we would be having this hearing at all if it was on a different foot. But, nonetheless, I appreciate you guys coming forward and being willing to serve. I think your positions, as has been indicated earlier, are very, very important, and we need to take this seriously. I am going to start with you, Ms. Mandelker. First of all, I want to thank you for telling a little bit about your life story and your father's story. I was watching your father as you were telling that story, and it was etched on his face what was going through his mind, and so I appreciate that very much. As the Senator from North Dakota and I were visiting, this is a country of immigrants, and you have proven that, both you and Ms. Ricardel. The Ranking Member asked a question about an allied Nation, an ally of ours that had given us sensitive information, and that sensitive information was handed over to a foe, whether that would impact that ally of ours giving further information. I do not know the specifics of that question, but I thought it was pretty clear, and I do not think you gave him a clear answer, and so I am going to revisit it. If an ally of ours gives us sensitive information and that sensitive information was transferred to an enemy of ours and the ally's, do you think it would impact that ally giving us further sensitive information? Ms. Mandelker. Senator, I do not know the answer to that question. I think it would have to depend on the particular set of facts and circumstances. I think---- Senator Tester. Which is what you said before. Ms. Mandelker. I think---- Senator Tester. The question is: Wouldn't human nature dictate that, hell, no, they would not give us information again? Ms. Mandelker. Again, I think it depends on the complexities of the relationship, the type of information that you are--that was communicated, the assurances that had been given on either side. So it is difficult for me to answer a hypothetical without understanding all of the facts and circumstances. Of course, I agree that it is very important to safeguard the intelligence that we receive. Senator Tester. OK. This has not happened to me as a Ranking Member, but it has happened to many of our Ranking Members, and it is what the Ranking Member of this Committee said, that we ask people from the Administration for information, and they are either directed by somebody above them or they choose not to give information back. This is a question for all four of you. If we ask a question, either verbally or in writing, will you promise to get back to us? Ms. Mandelker. Yes. Ms. Ricardel. Yes, sir. Mr. Billingslea. Absolutely. Mr. Tarbert. Yes. Senator Tester. OK. Thank you. Going back on the Russia stuff for a second, Ms. Mandelker--and Senator Cotton talked about it for a little bit, and Senator Warren talked about it, too--it is apparent that Russian officials have been involved with Syrian leadership for some time. There have been innocent civilians killed in Syria due much, I think, because of that relationship. Do you think that that should require further sanctions on Russia, that relationship and what Syria has done because of that relationship? Ms. Mandelker. Well, Senator, I am, of course, just like you, very disturbed by what we are seeing in Syria, including the news that we heard yesterday. Whether or not we go the route of sanctions is a difficult and complex question, and---- Senator Tester. Wouldn't it be smarter to do that than put boots on the ground or drop bombs? Wouldn't that be the smart-- -- Ms. Mandelker. Well, going the non-kinetic way is obviously a more peaceful--is a more peaceful solution, but, again, it is difficult for me to address what are our options or what decisions we might make in any particular circumstance. Sanctions is one very important tool that we have to address behavior that we are concerned by. It is not the only tool, and we would want to consider it in light of all of the policy considerations that---- Senator Tester. But the sanctions are a tool that you are in charge of. Ms. Mandelker. That is right, Senator. Senator Tester. OK. Let us talk about the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba. Do you believe that embargo should be lifted? Ms. Mandelker. Senator, that is something that I would want to study, should I be confirmed, and carefully review within the Administration. I know that there is an ongoing policy review about Cuba that is---- Senator Tester. How about exemptions---- Ms. Mandelker. ----I do not want to prejudge that. Senator Tester. Would you agree there should be some exemptions? I am taking some of Warner's minute, by the way. Do you think there should be exemptions to that trade embargo? Ms. Mandelker. Again, it is something that I would commit to studying and to reviewing. I do not want to prejudge the outcome of that question before I have a chance to look into it further. Senator Tester. Thank you for being here. You are all really good. I would just hope for better answers because you guys know what you think. You are smart people. You are a hell of a lot smarter than the people up here. OK? Thank you very much. Chairman Crapo. Senator Warner. Senator Warner. I take exception to that. [Laughter.] Senator Tester. Sorry. Senator Warner. Ms. Mandelker, I appreciated the meeting we had on May 4th in my office, and as I said at that point, you have had some very strong recommendations, people that we mutually know. And echoing what Senator Tester said, I think your background shows that you are well suited for this position in the Administration. But as we discussed in my office, Senator Burr and I, in our role of leading the Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation, sent a letter to Treasury's Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Office on April 26th. In that letter we requested documentation from FinCEN that will be absolutely critical to the Russia investigation. Our asks include things like the FinCEN flash notices and the 314(a) requests. I know that we have received a preliminary response from Treasury that they are ``working on it.'' Well, I got to tell you, that is not good enough for an investigation that is so critical, that is dominating the news, that is dominating Americans' attention, that we are virtually a month later and we are getting a ``working on it.'' So as I told you in my office, I cannot support moving forward with your nomination until the questions that Chairman Burr and I get a full answer. This investigation, I believe, is the most important thing I will ever have taken on in my public life, and we are going to need the full cooperation of not just Treasury but all aspects of Government if it is appropriate for us to look into those areas. And, clearly, the follow-the-money route is one of the areas that is critically important. Mr. Billingslea, I understand that you were a member of the Trump transition team supporting national security. I also understand from press reports that you were instrumental in preparing Lieutenant General Flynn for a meeting with Russian ambassador Kislyak. In those same press reports, there was information about your efforts to ensure that General Flynn understood the risks of talking to Ambassador Kislyak and that you sought classified information about the Ambassador for General Flynn to ensure that he was fully aware of the risks he was taking. Now, I appreciate, again, your background as well. I think you are well qualified. I want to simply state for the record as well I appreciate the fact that you voluntarily came in and talked to Intelligence Committee staff yesterday, and I think that was a sign of good faith, and I appreciate your willingness to continue to cooperate if there is other information we need. So I want to ask all four of you, and recognizing that we are in this investigation going in areas that, frankly, are uncharted territory, we have access to raw intelligence that has never been provided before because the potential charges of collaboration or collusion between a foreign power and a campaign operation and potentially an Administration have never been explored before. It has taken us some time, but the intelligence community has cooperated in those efforts because I think they realize how serious it is. And, if anything, the attention and focus gets even hotter in light of some of the President's actions last week. So what I am asking all four of you, but particularly Ms. Mandelker and Mr. Billingslea, would be that, should you be confirmed, will you cooperate with the requests of the Intelligence Committee to provide information that is requested and do that in a timely manner and a complete manner? Ms. Mandelker. Yes. Mr. Billingslea. Yes, Senator. Ms. Ricardel. Yes, Senator. Mr. Tarbert. Yes, Senator. Senator Warner. Well, I think that is very important. You know, the sooner we can complete this process, the sooner we can either remove the cloud that hangs over this Administration or get to the bottom if there are circumstances that some of the press reports bear out to be true. And to do that, we are going to need everyone's cooperation. This is a really important time, a dangerous time, a challenging time. I think you have heard from both sides of the aisle real concerns about Russia and their attempts not only to intervene in our elections, the French elections, and I think you will see it in the German elections, their actions in Ukraine. And if there is ever a time that we must be vigilant, it is now. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Crapo. Thank you, Senator. Senator Cortez Masto. Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you, Mr. Chair. And thank you to all of you, and let me just say, first of all, thank you for taking the time to come visit with me. I really appreciate it. And welcome to all of your family who have been sitting here now for it seems like days. But we will end soon. Do not worry. Let me follow up with some of the questions, and let me start with Mr. Tarbert. If confirmed to the position for which you are nominated--and we have been talking about this. You will be leading the Treasury Department's work related to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. As it stands now, the public has no idea what President Trump's investments consist of because he will not release his tax returns, and meanwhile, we are reading in the papers that members of the President's extended family are going to China looking for investors in various business ventures and playing up their connections to the Oval Office. If confirmed, could President Trump and his family's vast global business entanglements complicate your efforts to lead the Treasury's work on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.? Mr. Tarbert. I do not believe so. If confirmed, I am committed to applying the law, and the law requires that for any covered transaction there be no national security concerns. Senator Cortez Masto. And how can we be sure about that transparency? How does the public know that you are making those decisions when it comes to our President and his interactions with foreign investments, including his family members? Mr. Tarbert. The CFIUS process, most of it is obviously classified, but FINSA has provisions whereby Congress and this Committee in particular can exercise oversight. Senator Cortez Masto. So let me ask you this: If it comes up that there is that entanglement, are you committed to ensuring that the public has a full airing and understanding of your decisions when it comes to whether the President's involvement or his family's involvement with foreign investments and likewise? Mr. Tarbert. I am committed to following all applicable laws and regulations and being as transparent as I can in compliance with those laws and regulations. Senator Cortez Masto. OK. Let me follow up on another thing we did not get a chance to talk about and I am not sure whether you are familiar with or not, which is MoneyGram. If confirmed to this position, you will be leading, again, the Committee on Foreign Investment, and as someone with a background in law enforcement, I know that working with money transfer companies is key to identifying, catching, and stopping illicit financing. If confirmed, how will you evaluate the proposed MoneyGram purchase by a company in part owned by Chinese State in terms of its impact on U.S. national security? Mr. Tarbert. Thank you, Senator. I am going to refrain from speaking about any particular case, but the general thrust of your question about money transmitters I think is an important one and also referencing a State-owned company. Right now, under the CFIUS process, a State-owned company automatically triggers in the investigation phase. So, if confirmed, I would use all available resources to ensure that there are no unresolved national security concerns. Senator Cortez Masto. OK. And them I am going to follow up with some similar line of questioning based on your previous experiences, some of the articles that you have written. You have written extensively on the Wall Street Reform Act's resolution planning provisions, including living wills. These documents require large financial companies to document how they could fail without harming Main Street. Some want to eliminate or weaken the act's provisions in this regard. What is your opinion? Mr. Tarbert. I think the resolution process--so the living wills that you referred to, under Title I, which requires large systemically important financial institutions or anyone caught under that to present a plan as to how they could be resolved under the Bankruptcy Code, I think that, at least from a personal standpoint, is a worthwhile exercise. Senator Cortez Masto. OK. Mr. Tarbert. Now, again, my position is--if confirmed, I would be potentially representing the U.S. at the international level, so I do not believe I would personally have a role in Dodd-Frank or legislation dealing with domestic finance. Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. I appreciate that. And thank you again. Good luck to all of you. And I appreciate you seriously taking the time to sit and visit with me. Chairman Crapo. Senator Heitkamp. Senator Heitkamp. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to all of you for your willingness to serve our country. Many of you have incredible resumes--all of you have incredible resumes. I think that it is not unfair to ask you this question: Who is your loyalty to? Once you are confirmed and if you are confirmed, who do you serve and who is your loyalty to? We will start with Ms. Mandelker. Ms. Mandelker. My loyalty is to the American people. Ms. Ricardel. My loyalty is also to the American people and to the laws that govern this country. Mr. Billingslea. Senator, my loyalty is both to the American people and to the Constitution. Mr. Tarbert. Yes, the Constitution and the American people. Senator Heitkamp. It is critically important to remember that. Sometimes when you are confirmed and people give you positions like this, there may come a time when you are asked to do something that is not in the interest of the American people, that is not in the interest of our checks and balances system in the Constitution, and that will, in fact, jeopardize our national security. And I think it is fair to ask that question today, and so I want to thank you all for the answer. I believe that you are earnest about this. But we all know that there is a slippery slope, and little compromises lead to big compromises. And it is critically important, hopefully--I do not mean to be lecturing here, but that you remember that as you serve once you are confirmed. I want to talk first, Ms. Mandelker, first off just tell you how moving your family's story is and how grateful we are, and I think I believe your answer a little bit more as a result of the challenges that your family has experienced. But I want to talk about a hearing that we had last week. We heard from two previous distinguished incumbents of the position that you are nominated to about both the value and the limitations of secondary sanctions. How would you go about thinking whether to apply this relatively blunt instrument? And what steps can Treasury take to ensure that sanctions advance tailored national security instruments without unleashing unintended consequences? And I would just tell you I think that when we are looking at this, this is going to become a critical piece, and it is very important that you be clear on how you see secondary sanctions. Ms. Mandelker. Thank you, Senator, for that question, and obviously, it is something that I have been thinking about. I had the opportunity to watch the testimony last week, which I thought was very useful. Both witnesses had excellent ideas, and I appreciate their testimony and their counsel. Issuing secondary sanctions is a blunt instrument. It is an instrument, of course, that worked. It was very impactful when it came to how we used it, how the U.S. Government used it in Iran. It is something that I think we have to consider car"
