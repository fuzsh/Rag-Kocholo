It's orders of magnitude faster than most competition, and customers love it. Fortune called us the \"Usain Bolt of cyber­security\" [1], and Forbes put us at #4 on the Cloud 100 list [2].\n\nThe former CIO of the US Air Force, said that Tanium is \"game-changing ... allowing a tremendous amount of automation and reduced workloads for our network operations people significantly, meaning things that used to take them months is now down to seconds, or minutes.\" [3] The USAF used Tanium to patch all of their systems for WannaCry in 41 minutes and consider any system without our software as \"high risk\". [4]\n\nFortune ranked us as one of the best medium-sized places to work [5] [6].\n\nBenefits include healthcare, 401k match, self-directed/unlimited vacation time (most folks take 4-5 weeks), paid time off for volunteering, parental leave, fertility/adoption benefits, and more.\n\nCompensation is near FAANG levels with strong base pay, large annual bonuses, and equity in the form of RSUs. The recruiting team can share more details there.\n\nWe get everyone together 2-3 times a year, and most teams do zoom calls for standup 2-3 times a week.\n\nWe have roles open in Engineering, Technical Account Management, Security, Sales, Legal, Marketing, Finance, HR, Accounting, and more. I called out a few interesting positions below.\n\nFeel free to ask me about anything, reply here or email nathan.dauber@[company site].\n\n--\n\nSenior Software Engineer - The core is mostly C++, and then JavaScript for the modules and admin interface (AngularJS/React/Node.js, with work in progress to switch to React).

As a TAM, you'd be expected to set up a home lab with a network of machines (or VMs) running our software, and you'd be primarily responsible for advising 2~5 customers on how best to use Tanium. However, TAMs come from all kinds of backgrounds including sysadmin, devops, or security, and really work together as a team to support each other and meet the needs of each customer.\n\nRemote or on site worldwide https://www.tanium.com/careers/?p=department&t=Technical%20A...

Hopefully I can attract you in a sufficient way with our tech stack! (see below). [NOTE: this is not a pie-in-the-sky venture, you would be joining a team who has a 1.5+year-old working product, with prospects of new greenfield products built around the first.]\n\nJob positions:\n\n- Build engineer: you are a Linux-er who has some past experience building deb or rpm packages, are excited about reproducible builds, and are willing to learn (if you don't already know) new things such as snap or flatpak. gitlabCI and/or githubActions is a plus. (Might do some DevOps work after we come out of stealth mode as well; with Pulumi and RedShift.)\n\n- C#/.NET developer: generics, LINQ, VisualStudio, EntityFramework et al are your bread and butter. You value the diversity that comes from learning other languages and tech-stacks but also the stability that a robust platform like .NET provides, which you based your career on. Desirable to be familiar with Xamarin, but not required. F# is a plus.\n\n- Rust developer: you dealt with C/C++/Objective-C in the past but are ready to move on. However, you're still not convinced about garbage collected languages, so you have been looking at Rust lately, or willing to learn it. You're not a smart-ass though, so you would be excited to expose your Rust code's API to be consumed by higher level languages.\n\n- FP developer: you value immutability and lack of side effects because you have lived the nightmares of race conditions and heisenbugs in your career. You're disgusted with most job positions out there because the tech-stack described in most of them don't look safe enough to be serious (sure they can build snapchats with them, but not robust software that would end up being used by NASA or Waymo). Desirable to be familiar with F#.\n\n- Desktop/mobile developer: you cringe at the idea of \"Electron apps\", because you think native frameworks like QT or gtk+ give much power and maintainability (plus, performance aside, javascript is a joke in any other aspect too). But you also understand why garbage-collected languages are safer and more productive than low-level ones, and there are many of these much more decent than JS. (gtk is preferred for this position at the moment; or someone willing to switch)\n\n- SmartContracts/blockchain developer: you've used/developed smart contracts in languages such as Ivy, MiniScript, or Solidity(EVM), or are willing to learn this technology. Desirable to have familiarity with atomic swaps, HTLCs or zero knowledge proofs. Excited about things like bitcoin, ethereum, mimblewimble/grin, DAI, etc\n\nImportant perk for all positions: all the code/scripts you'll write (being paid of course) will be opensource, at least for the first 2-3months.\n\nWrite me at andrew.forsure@gmail.com\n\nPS: Abstain from applying if you expect a lead/managerial role, because the team is not yet big enough to need extra leadership for now.\n\nPS II: In case you're only interested in joining part-time, note: I wouldn't find it acceptable if you join us to work remotely part-time while keeping your full-time job. Part-time only works with your own side-projects, or other additional part-time job (because resting is important).\n\nBeacon Biosignals | Lead Operations Engineer | Boston, MA | Onsite Available, Remote Friendly | Full Time\n\nOur super early-stage startup is seeking an individual to lead the development/operations of our AWS infrastructure, and along the way teach us all how to deliver more robust software.\n\nAbout Us:\n\nDespite its significant potential for improving patient outcomes, brain monitoring is still not easily accessible or interpretable in clinical settings. We're going to fix that, and we'd like you to help.\n\nWe're a semi-stealth-mode startup founded by numerical programmers, neuroscientists, and practicing neurologists who are committed to translating our best-of-breed clinical research from the lab into the ICU and ED. We're well-funded, well-connected, and own a well-labeled set of brain data amassed over the past decade at some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the world. This dataset is, as far as we know, the largest of its kind in existence. We intend to put it to good use.\n\nOur team is composed of neuro-experts, open-source enthusiasts, audio/DSP engineers, programming language nerds, and generally easy-going (but dedicated!) folks.\n\nAbout You:\n\n- You're excited to design a service architecture that orthogonalizes the critical feedback loops that entangle our code, data, models, and products.\n\n- You're tired of organizations treating DevOps like an individual role instead of a company-wide practice.\n\n- You're a networks/containers nerd who will turn us into networks/containers nerds.\n\n- You've witnessed the pains that result from fitting square AWS-provided-solution pegs into round in-house-problem holes. Conversely, you've also seen how NIH syndrome can drive teams down a rabbit hole whose endpoint is a shallow reproduction of an existing AWS solution that could've just been employed in the first place.\n\n- You are familiar with the many idiosyncrasies of storing, streaming, and analyzing large volumes of dense signal data in the cloud (e.g. audio, video, domain-specific sensor data, etc.).\n\n- You believe that diversity is an integral part of strong engineering culture, and that lack of diversity contributes to stagnation.\n\nOur data science team makes heavy use of the Julia language. This quarter, we're tackling model evaluation as a CI process, pushing >70TB of signal data (and our processes for manipulating it) into AWS, and developing a browser-based viewing/analysis application for our signal data. Come help us make the right decisions!\n\nContact jarrett@beacon.bio if interested.\n\nWeb3 Foundation | Site Reliability Engineer | Full-time, Zug Switzerland - ONSITE or REMOTE | https://polkadot.network/ Full posting at: https://web3.bamboohr.com/jobs/view.php?id=50\n\nAre you a software engineer who is passionate about automation and problem-solving? Do you have experience in on-call responses and distributed systems? Do you want to work on creating the Web 3.0 infrastructure? Are you excited about joining a startup?\n\nWe’re building the future of identity, privacy, financial markets and commerce through blockchains and other cryptographic technologies. At the core of this work is Polkadot - a platform that enables blockchains of all kinds to interact and stay secure. This is an opportunity to work at the forefront of technological development and join in shaping the future of society.\n\nWeb3 Foundation aims to ensure that crucial projects and networks are sufficiently reviewed and monitored, as well as any developers and users are aware of best security practices. The Site Reliability Team will be responsible for the initiatives that allow us to respond to incidents once the network is deployed.\n\nFor any questions just reach out at jobs@web3.foundation\n\nSee also other available roles at https://jobs.web3.foundation\n\nRoot Insurance Co| Columbus, OH / Chicago, IL | Full-time | Onsite preferable / limited remote possible (US only, select roles only)| $80k-$170k https://root.engineering/\n\nRoot is an auto insurance carrier, like GEICO and Progressive. We use data science to identify and insure good drivers, reducing insurance premiums for good drivers significantly as a result. We're a startup — we're 700+ people who have been working on this since March 2015. We've built an iOS and Android app that gathers data on how well people drive. We use that to set insurance prices. To build the best possible product and user experience, we went through the arduous process of starting an insurance carrier from scratch.\n\nWe're focused on becoming a national insurance carrier and are now live in 29 states.\n\nWe recently raised the largest VC round ever for an Ohio technology company ($523 million in funding to date.) We're planning on leveraging that momentum to continue scaling rapidly and build something truly unique in the insurance industry.

Whether you're just getting started out in software development or someone who is looking to lend your experience in leadership to a rapidly scaling engineering organization, we plan on doubling our engineering team in the next year alone.\n\nOur tech stack involves Ruby / Rails and Javascript / React Native. However, we're not only looking for people with experience in our stack but rather we're looking for experienced technologists with sound engineering fundamentals using any technology.\n\nWe're actively hiring in Columbus, OH and are also building an Engineering Team in Chicago, IL that will be working very closely with our telematics data. This team will play a major part in where we're headed, and we're searching for experienced Engineers who are looking to have a significant impact by building and leading a team from scratch specifically in Chicago.\n\nEmail us at enghiring@joinroot.com to apply and either Tim or Chris will respond to you promptly.\n\nFreeAgent, Edinburgh and REMOTE U.K.\n\nhttps://www.freeagent.com\n\nAt FreeAgent we help freelancers and small businesses be more successful by putting them in control of their company finances.\n\nWe have built an award-winning banking and accounting app that offers full end-to-end compliance, from time tracking to tax return filing.
