        "text": "Minsk (Belarusian: Мінск, Russian: Минск) is the capital and largest city of the Republic of Belarus. Its population is about two million people in 2021.\n\nFor many years after the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, Minsk and Belarus, in general, had a reputation of a Soviet experience park. In the late 2010s, this stereotype started losing its relevance: Minsk offers reliable and affordable public transport, plentiful hotels, convenient banking, and shopping and dining that international tourists will find familiar. The quality and number of sightseeing opportunities have improved remarkably too. Still, the Soviet past — Stalinist architecture and socialist street art, old-style canteens and department stores — exists alongside the renovated churches, fancy restaurants, hipster joints and tourist sightseeing traps. This makes Minsk an attractive destination for those who look for new experiences.\n\nMinsk is one of the oldest Belarusian cities. Its age is counted from 1067, when it was mentioned in a medieval chronicle for the first time. In the 13th century, Minsk peacefully joined the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. By the middle of the 16th century, it was an important economic and cultural centre in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. It suffered badly during the Russo-Polish War (1654–1667) and the Great Northern War (1700–1721). Minsk was annexed by Russia in 1793. It enjoyed a speedy development throughout the 19th century as one of the provincial centres of the Russian Empire. By the end of the 19th century, the city had over 90,000 inhabitants, with Jews constituting more than half of its population. Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians, Poles and Belarusians. Ethnic Belarusians dominated in rural areas on the country.\n\nIn the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement. The 1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the forerunner to the Soviet Communists, was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the Belarusian national revival, alongside Vilnius. The First World War devastated Minsk. By 1915, it was a battle-front city.\n\nThe first attempt at an independent Belarusian state, the Belarusian Democratic Republic, was made in Minsk in March 1918. In 1919, Minsk became the capital city of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic, BSSR, one of the founders of the Soviet Union (1922-1991). Minsk was occupied by Nazi Germany from 1941-1944. Before the Second World War, Minsk had a population of 300,000, but this had fallen to around 50,000 by 1944. After the war, Minsk was almost completely rebuilt. The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by Stalinist architecture, which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Many magnificent and precious buildings, including churches and synagogues, were lost in the post-war decades of disregard to the pre-Socialist past.\n\nMinsk is increasingly more confident in being the capital city of a country in the very centre of Europe. It is becoming better connected and more open, both economically and culturally. In return, it makes Minsk more attractive to all kinds of visitors, not only those who are after the quirkiest experiences.\n\nAverage temperatures are maximum 24°C, minimum 12°C in summer and maximum 3°C, minimum -7°C in winter. The best time to visit Minsk is from May to September when it is full of greenery. Summers are often hot and dry. Winters are freezing cold, but snow does not stay on the ground for long.\n\nIn addition to visa-free entry for Russians and many other citizens, passengers from 74 countries do not need a visa if flying to Minsk National Airport under certain conditions. For more information, see Belarus#Get_in.\n\nThe only Belarusian airline, Belavia, is based at the Minsk National Airport which had become an increasingly popular transit hub for travel between Ukraine, Russia, Caucasus, Central Asia and formerly also Europe. Also, a number of Russian airlines and few other airlines fly to Minsk daily or near daily. For transfer instructions, see the Airport website [dead link] (links in the left-hand menu). Due to sanctions, there are no direct flights to or from the European Union - the sole remaining practical connection is via Istanbul.\n\nThe airport is served by buses №300Э and private minivans №1400-ТК and №1430-ТК running 24/7 every 15 to 45 minutes (see timetable [dead link]) from the central coach terminals (Aŭtavakzal Centraĺny, Аўтавакзал Цэнтральны; also may be spelt Avtovokzal Tsentralnyi, from its Russian name). The bus stop is outside the arrivals sectors 5/6. The timetable is on display at the stop. Free wifi is available on all buses and minivans, however, you will have to be able to receive an SMS with the password.\n\nBefore boarding bus №300Э, purchase a ticket from a self-service kiosk at the bus stop (most international cards are accepted) or from the driver (Belarusian cash, cards are accepted on some buses). For minivans №1400-ТК and №1430-ТК, take any available seat and wait for the driver to collect cash payments just before departure. Cost of one-way travel is 2.9-4.00 rubles depending on the final destination (December 2019). Stowing luggage is free on minivans (limited space is available) and 0.40 rubles - on bus №300Э.\n\nOn the bus №300Э or minivan №1400-ТК routes, the first stop is in about 30 minutes at the Uručča, Уручча metro station. Change here to continue your journey by Minsk Metro (underground)[dead link]. Alternatively, continue to the final stop, Aŭtavakzal Centraĺny, Аўтавакзал Цэнтральны, located next to the main train station, Minsk Pasažyrski, Мінск Пасажырскі and metro station, Plošča Lienina, Плошча Леніна.\n\nThe minibus №1430-ТК runs less frequently (see schedule [dead link]) and takes a different route. It stops at the Mahilioŭskaja, Магілёўская metro station which is more convenient for those going to the Šabany, Шабаны, Aŭtazavod, Аўтазавод, Čyžoǔka, Чыжоўка and Sierabranka, Серабранка districts, and the stations along the Aŭtazavodskaja metro[dead link] line. Tickets can only be purchased from the driver - 3 rubles to the Mahilioŭskaja, Магілёўская metro station, 4 rubles - to the central coach terminals (December 2019). Luggage is free, but there is only limited space available.\n\nOn the way back to the airport, either depart from the central coach terminals (Aŭtavakzal Centraĺny, Аўтавакзал Цэнтральны) or from the Uručča, Уручча metro station. From the Aŭtavakzal Centraĺny, all buses and minivans for the airport depart every 15 minutes (less frequently during off-peak hours) from the platform 2 (August 2019). If departing from the Uručča, leave the metro station along the train arriving from the city centre; in the subway, turn right and right again at the very end to leave the subway. Tickets for bus №300Э can be purchased from the kiosk nearest to the exit from the subway or from the driver. The electronic screen at the stop shows the waiting time for buses №300Э. For minivans №1400-ТК, tickets can be purchased from the driver.\n\nMany taxi drivers offer their services in the Arrivals and just outside it. Their prices tend to be steep, but negotiable; always agree on the price in advance.\n\nTo reach the airport by car, leave the city by Praspiekt [Avenue] Niezaliežnasci | Праспект Незалежнасці and follow the highway.\n\nThe fastest train from Vilnius takes about 2½ hours and costs about US$10-15 one way. An overnight trip from Warsaw is about 10 hours departing from Zachodnia, Centralna and Wschodnia stations. There are also trains from Prague and other European cities. There are multiple trains from/to Moscow, including several overnight sleepers. Only Belarusian or Russian citizens can cross the Belarus-Russia land border by train or coach; holders of other passports must take a plane. For train times, prices and booking tickets for trips from or within Belarus use the Belarusian Railway[dead link] website.\n\nDriving in, while possible, requires knowledge of the border system. This is a border of European Union, so border controls are very strict. Crossing it can take 2 hours. They may check your bags. Without knowledge of Russian, Belarusian or Polish, this can be very hard. There may be a very long line of cars at a border crossing. However, if you have passport, visa and car registration papers prepared, act honest and helpful and arrives as a tourist in a personal car the border crossing can go very smoothly and be over within 45 minutes. There are may toll roads in Belarus, please be prepared to get on-board electronic unit and pay right from the start, so not to face heavy fines later on. Please check out information on toll roads at Beltoll's site [dead link].\n\nThe central area of Minsk is easily manageable on foot. Public transportation comprises buses, trams, trolleybuses, railway city lines and the Minsk metro (underground). Minsk public transport is cheap and reliable. For navigation, Google Maps does a good job.\n\nSingle trip tickets and margetic cards for uploading carnets and period passes can be purchased from metro ticket offices, Minsktrans[dead link] (state public transport company for Minsk) offices in front of most metro station exits and from Minsktrans[dead link] kiosks at many bus stops. There are a large number of carnet and pass combinations depending on the length of the intended stay and plans for travel. The metro-only magnetic card[dead link] costs 1 ruble (refundable) plus cost of travel; the Minsktrans magnetic card[dead link] costs 2.88 rubles (refundable) and is valid for metro, bus, trolleybus, tram and railway city lines (September 2019). For details, see the Minsk metro fairs guide in Belarusian and Russian.\n\nA single trip ticket for bus, tram or trolleybus is paper-based and costs 0.60 rubles if purchased from a ticket office or kiosk, 0.65 rubles if purchased from the driver (September 2019). Tickets have to be validated straight away. In metro, a single journey is 0.65 rubles (September 2019) paid by tokens bought at a window or self-service kiosk inside the station. Visa and MasterCard bank cards can be used for contactless pay-as-you-go payments. Magnetic cards with carnets or period passes have to be scanned upon boarding buses, trolleybuses and trams; if successful, the scanner displays Аплочана (Belarusian for paid). There is no need to scan cards at the end of the journey. Validators for paper tickets and scanners for cards are separate machines. In metro, scan a card at the gate to your right and enter the station.\n\nThere are a few express buses (their route number is followed by Э - for Belarusian Экспрэс) in Minsk. They are not covered by the majority of available period passes, but can be added for a small payment.\n\nPrivately-run minivans (their route numbers consist of four digits followed by letters, e.g. 1097-TK, displayed in the front and side windows of vehicles) often serve longer routes than city buses, trolleybuses and trams do. They are of good quality, safe and very quick. Minivans stop on request at regular bus or trolleybus stops and cost 1.00-1.50 rubles depending on the route. Period passes and carnets from Minsktrans are not valid on minivans. To catch one, stand at the edge of a bus stop and make a sign to the driver of the approaching vehicle; then take a seat and pass the money to the driver (via other passengers if necessary); change will be passed to you if applicable in the same manner. Ask to stop when approaching your stop.\n\nMinsk metro consists of two underground lines crossing at the very city centre, stations Kastryčnickaja and Kupalaǔskaja. On the metro map[dead link], the Maskoŭskaja line is in blue, it is often referred as the first line. It is the oldest line of the Minsk Metro. Its earliest stations, Instytut Kuĺtury to Uschod, each uniquely decorated, are listed objects reflecting the Soviet architectural tradition. The Aŭtazavodskaja line is in red, it is often referred to as the second line. Each station on maps has been assigned a number making navigation for tourists much easier, however, locals may not even be aware of that; they always call the stations by their proper names. Trains run every two to fifteen minutes depending on the time of the day. The first train in the morning departs the initial station at about 05:30, the last one at night at 0:40. If you travel with even a slightly large bag, you are likely to be stopped by the police present at all stations for scanning your luggage. In such situations, the police are polite and efficient most of the time. Travelling in metro while drunk is prohibited. Station staff and police will question anyone appearing unstable. Standard questions include the intended destination, address and whether one will be able to get there safely. Keep calm and polite; use taxi if in doubt.\n\nTaxis App-based taxi services - Yandex and Next Taxi[dead link] - are inexpensive and abundant most of the time; they are convenient if you don't speak Russian or Belarusian. Most locals also use telephones to call for a taxi which are then likely to arrive in just a few minutes. Stopping a taxi on the street is common. The driver must use a fare meter which may be a phone-based. If unsure, check how the fare will be determined beforehand. Drivers waiting for customers at the airport and train stations tend to ask for hugely inflated fares; always negotiate.\n\nThere are many bike sharing stations, even automated ones[dead link]. If you see a lonely orange bike or electric scooter with QR code, just scan it and explore the city.\n\nThe largest religious community in Minsk - as in the whole country - is the Belarusian Orthodox Church, part of the Russian Orthodox Church. A significant proportion of the population belongs to the Roman Catholic Church and various Protestant communities. Other religions have a much smaller presence. Over the centuries, other religions like Greek Catholics (Uniates) and Muslims (Belarusian Tatars, also known as Polish–Lithuanian or Lipka Tatars) have left a strong imprint on the city too. According to the 1897 census, 52% of Minsk's population were Jews; there were over 100 synagogues in Minsk then. During the Soviet era, many religious buildings were closed, demolished or used for other purposes. Since Belarus regained its independence in 1991, some religious buildings were returned to their communities; many others remain in use by state institutions.\n\nFootball: several Minsk teams play soccer in the Premier League, the country's top tier. The national team play at Dinamo Stadium, capacity 22,000, about 500 m south of city centre. That's also the home of top-tier club FC Minsk; other big club fixtures also occasionally use it. Other clubs in the city are Dinamo Minsk, Energetik-BGU (formerly Zvezda), and Isloch. The playing season is Mar-Nov.\n\nIce hockey: HC Dinamo Minsk play in KHL, the predominantly Russian league that also has teams from Beijing and Astana.\n\nTraditionally, tourists bring from Belarus linen goods, embroidery, souvenirs made of straw and leather, glass, ceramics and other artisanal items. Belarusian vodka has an excellent reputation; it can be purchased from airport duty-free shops. Zubroǔka (a Polish equivalent of Żubrówka) is a popular spirit originally created in Belarusian Brest. Sugar-coated cranberries, flat crisps (čypsy, чыпсы), zefir (a soft baked confectionery of apple puree and sugar), chocolate-glazed cheesecake desserts (hlazuravany syrok, глазураваны сырок) and rye bread are treated as Belarusian specialities; they are loved by locals and are widely available, also from airport shops.\n\nShopping malls mainly feature foreign brands. Local department stores – GUM, TSUM, Na Nemige, Univermag Belaruś etc. – stock a wider variety of the goods produced locally.\n\nDue to the common history, traditional Belarusian cuisine is similar to that of the rest of Eastern Europe but particularly Polish and Lithuanian. Soups, dumplings, baked potato, mushroom and meat dishes, pickled vegetables and salads are often on the menu. Beer and naliŭki (berries, fruits and various spices liquors) are traditional here. Minsk has a good selection of Belarusian traditional restaurants. Among others, Georgian and Central Asian restaurants have a good reputation.\n\nWhile meat has always been an integral part of traditional Belarusian meals, vegetarians and vegans are increasingly well served in Minsk. Belarus is a landlocked country; seawater fish is expensive.\n\nMost, if not all venues in Minsk accept bank cards even for small amounts. Tipping up to 10% for table service is common, but not compulsory. Many cafes and bars have tip cups; leaving tips there is not compulsory either.\n\nVegan food is still a novelty in Belarus, however there are a handful of reliable cafes in Minsk already.\n\nGetting decent coffee in Minsk is not difficult. In addition to local and international coffee and bakery chains (Paul, Thierry, Golden Coffee), there are plenty of independent coffee shops and stalls around the city, in shopping malls and museums. Many convenience stores and supermarkets offer coffee too. Most coffee shops close by 23:00.\n\nNowadays, beer and vodka are the most common traditional alcoholic drinks in Belarus. Samahonka (moonshine) is occasionally served in trendy bars, as well as in all venues with decent Belarusian cuisine. Some places may have naliŭki - liquors infused with local berries, fruits or spices like horseradish. Zubroǔka (Żubrówka in Poland) is native to Belarus too. Good wines are expensive in Belarus, but due to geopolitical reasons, the country is a good place to explore Georgian and Moldovan wines, as well as Armenian cognacs. Most, if not all venues in Minsk accept bank cards even for small amounts. Many cafes and bars without table service have tip cups; leaving tips there is not compulsory.\n\nCasino Royal\n\nCarat Casino\n\nUntil 2019, a major advantage of staying in hotels while visiting Belarus was a registration with the local police organised by hotels for their customers. This registration is still mandatory, but can be done online without hotels. Read more in the Belarus article.\n\nMany hostels are just apartment flats with bunk beds in all the rooms. Finding them and checking in many require a phone call and coordination and most apartments only have 1 or 2 bathrooms to be shared by all of the guests.\n\nMinsk is a safe and clean city. If you are in need of assistance, there is a strong police presence in the downtown area. Emergency medical help can be accessed 24/7, either in designated hospitals or by phone.\n\nAll Minsk Metro stations are equipped with security scanners and police are always present there. Passengers with large bags and, particularly, backpacks, are routinely asked to submit their belongings for scanning. The procedure is quick and the police are usually polite. Both the police and Metro staff keep an eye on not letting drunk passengers in, particularly in the evening. Even if you are tipsy, be prepared to answer about your destination station and address. Alternatively, use a taxi, buses, trolleybuses and trams.\n\nThe Belarusian law prohibits taking photographs of the government buildings. Locals tell stories of tourists approached by officials after attempting to photograph the monumental KGB headquarters on Praspiekt Niezaliežnasci.\n\nAttending political and any protests may not be safe for tourists. Even bystanders may be detained by uniformed and plain cloth police. The judge is likely to accept the police story.\n\nBelarus is safe for LGBT travellers most of the time. Belarusian law neither recognises nor bans same-sex relationships; it has some provision for transgender people. Homophobic and transphobic abuse is not recognised as a specific hate crime; any such incidents would be treated as generic hooliganism. This has its impact on society: most people would not mind having LGBT people around but would regard any explicit signs of affection disturbing. This may also lead to violence. In the past, there were reports of vigilante groups using dating apps; the police challenged those crimes. Taking reasonable precautions should be enough to stay safe.\n\nThe Belarusian law prohibits the distribution of pornography. While it is not used to routinely police people's belongings and video-streaming habits, there were odd cases of prosecuting Belarusian citizens for posting explicit content on social media and even in password-protected profiles.\n\nThe enforcement of road safety for pedestrians and drivers by the traffic police is often ruthless, so observing traffic lights and crossings are well-engraved in Belarusians' behaviour. As a rule, drivers always give the way to pedestrians crossing the road in the designated places.\n\nThere is a pharmacy in the basement level at the Central Railway Station. The pharmacy staff do not speak English so it's preferred to have a Russian or Belarusian speaker with you, or have something written in Cyrillic.\n\nTimetable of Catholic Masses in Minsk; Roman Catholic parishes in Minsk (scroll down)\n\nLanguage may be a barrier for tourists to a certain extent. Virtually all Belarusians speak or understand both Belarusian and Russian; the latter remains the default means of communication. Increasingly more young people speak English and many of them will be eager to practice it. The older generation is unlikely to understand English. It is wise for visitors to learn some key phrases in Russian or Belarusian. Also, being familiar with the Cyrillic alphabet used both by Belarusian and Russian is essential for travelling without a guide. Many street signs and notices in public transport in Minsk are transliterated into the Latin alphabet. A confusion may arise as names of landmarks, objects etc. may be transliterated either from Belarusian (as the current official practice requires, however it is not strictly enforced) or Russian; to add to the confusion, the old practice of translating geographical names still has a place. As the result, Плошча Перамогі (Площадь Победы in Russian) may be referred to in publications as Plošča Pieramohi (or Pieramohi Square, transliteration from Belarusian), Pobedy Square (transliteration from Russian) or Victory Square (direct translation). There is no an easy way to completely avoid this confusion, but be aware of the possibility that the same place can have a different name depending on the primary language of the speaker. There is more coverage of this issue in the Belarusian phrasebook and links from there.\n\nMost Belarusian trains are cheap, comfortable and reliable. Some destinations are served by high-speed services, but slow overnight sleepers are widely available as well. Minibuses (maršrutka in Belarusian, маршрутка) is the most common local and intercity transportation used by Belarusians. They are not always less comfortable, but quick and cheap. You can also rent a car."
