        "text": "Well, a Star War came out. How are we feeling, fam?\n\nI know, I know. There are a lot of feelings going around. And I have a lot of my own. People keep asking me what I thought of the movie because I seem to flip-flop by the hour, so, here is my attempt to search my feelings for what I know to be true.\n\nTwo years ago, when I walked out of The Last Jedi for the first time, I was more confused about my reaction than anything else, and I needed several viewings to reconcile with the fact that I actually really disliked – and felt personally betrayed by – the movie. With The Rise of Skywalker, I knew exactly how I felt about it while watching it, but it’s taken me a while to reconcile the fact that there are things I really dislike about it (and things that are honestly objectively bad about it) with the fact that I honestly, genuinely loved the movie.\n\nSo, for me, what it all comes down to is this: I believe it is possible to love a thing and also be intensely critical of it. In fact, I’d say that being critical of a piece of media is part and parcel of loving it. That’s what it means to be a fan; whether you’re a fan of Star Wars (OT, PT, ST, and/or everything in between), or simply a fan of movies in general. I also believe that not every story has to be a game-changing revelation or a complex and intricate work of art. Expensive, seven-course restaurant dinners are great. But home-cooked mac ‘n’ cheese can be great, too.\n\n–\n\nTaking a bird’s eye view of the sequel trilogy and the overarching filmmaking process involved therein, I see two glaring issues: One, a general lack of creative cohesion; and two, a more specific inability to narratively reckon with Carrie Fisher’s death.\n\nIn terms of creative cohesion, the problem is simple enough to express: Did anybody even bother writing a goddamn outline for this trilogy, like…at all? Without going into specific details – because if you’re reading this, you probably already have a list in your head – the amount of plot points that were set up in The Force Awakens and then brutally scoffed at in The Last Jedi, and then set up in The Last Jedi but blatantly brushed aside or straight-up contradicted in The Rise of Skywalker…it’s staggering, really. The metaphorical middle fingers thrown back and forth between J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson absolutely ruined any semblance of an arc for the sequel trilogy as a whole. It was not so much a baton-pass between the two directors as much as it was a vicious game of dodgeball. From a filmmaking perspective, that truly is a damn shame.\n\nOn the Carrie Fisher front: Fisher’s feminist impact within the science fiction/fantasy realm cannot be understated. If there was one single through-line that was supposed to play out across all three movies, it has been well documented that TFA was Han’s film, TLJ was Luke’s film, and TROS was supposed to be Leia’s film. But Carrie Fisher died before filming began on The Rise of Skywalker, so what do you do when the actor that embodies the character that represents the culmination of the entire Skywalker saga and the apotheosis of the sequel trilogy is unavailable to shoot her scenes?\n\nYou can…\n\na) Recast the role and proceed with the script as planned\n\nb) Kill off the character before the events of the new movie start or in the opening crawl, rewrite the script, and proceed from there\n\nc) Pigeonhole whatever previous footage you have of the actor in said role into the new movie and make whatever adjustments to the script to accommodate\n\nObviously, JJ went with option C. But from a narrative perspective (ie, setting aside the wishes of Fisher’s family for the sake of this hypothetical)…I honestly wish they had gone with A. At the time of Carrie Fisher’s death, it felt like sacrilege to imagine anyone else playing the role. But now that I’ve seen the final product and gotten a glimpse of what they were going for with the character, I wonder if the movie, the Star Wars saga, the character herself, and fans as a whole would have been better served if Disney had recast the role, worked some CGI wizardry, and then really leaned in to giving one of the most important characters in cinematic history the send-off she deserved. Instead, we got generic B-roll footage of Leia blandly uttering vague lines of dialogue that were clearly left on the cutting room floor for a reason while handing over a lightsaber every five minutes. And as it turns out, desperately trying to shape the heart and soul of your movie around generic B-roll footage doesn’t always work out for the best.\n\nIn terms of the more specific gripes I had with the movie:\n\nEditing\n\nFrankly speaking, the editing in this movie was noticeably bad. All due respect to the editors who were tasked with cutting and piecing together one of the largest blockbusters of the modern era within a truncated production schedule, but this viewing experience was pretty rough. Sitting through the movie, I felt like a significant amount of emotional resonance was lost simply because the scene cut away from a big moment before letting the characters – and the audience – sit with our feelings for a couple of seconds. In the first scene of the movie, Kylo Ren murders a couple dozen villagers and unlocks a Sith wayfinder and flies to Exegol and discovers Darth Sidious all in the span of, idk, five minutes?! Whew. When Rey tells Leia she’s going to pick up Luke’s search for the Sith wayfinder with or without Leia’s blessing because “it’s what you would have done,” it’s a beautiful and spunky speech that I specifically wanted to see Leia’s reaction to, but the scene immediately cuts away when Rey closes her mouth. (Which is certainly a problem tied to the above issue regarding Carrie Fisher and the lack of B-roll.) And when Kylo addresses his First Order Board of Trustees and force-chokes a dude straight up to the ceiling, the scene cuts away right as Kylo finishes speaking. What about the dude on the ceiling? Is he still there?? Did Kylo gently lower him back into his chair?? It was just bizarre.\n\nScore\n\nGonna probably have to change my name, address, and all my social media handles after posting this because I honestly did not love a lot of the musical decisions in this movie. Listen, I’m not a barbarian, I love every single character theme John Williams has ever developed for the Star Wars saga, and I have never before had an issue with “too much John Williams music.” But I think The Rise of Skywalker could have benefited from letting some scenes breath from a score perspective as well as from an editing perspective. Rey’s theme is beautiful, aching, and triumphant, but you don’t need to play it every time she appears on-screen. Kylo Ren’s theme is haunting, tragic, and terror-inducing, but you don’t need to play it every time he appears on-screen. Palpatine’s theme is…well, you get the point. Over-playing these musical cues takes away from the big, emotional heft of playing these themes when Rey has an especially triumphant moment, or when Kylo has an especially terrifying one. Think about the scene (honestly, probably my favorite capital “m” Moment in any Star Wars movie) at the end of The Force Awakens when Rey grabs Luke’s lightsaber out of mid-air. After refusing the call of the Force for the entire movie, she finally picks up the mantle of her destiny. That’s when you cue up the (Burning Homestead version of the) Force theme. Not every. single. time. Rey ignites her lightsaber.\n\nHaving said all that, I have obviously still been listening to the soundtrack on a loop since walking out of the movie, because John Williams is a god, etc, etc, and I can’t wait for someone smarter than me to parse out all of the intricate details of this latest score. #TheMaestro\n\nDialogue\n\nAgain, another issue that probably stems mostly from the Carrie Fisher conundrum, because so many of Rey’s lines were just her repeating things that Leia said in more specific language so that the audience wouldn’t notice how vague all of Leia’s lines really are. Honestly, I think the character with the best lines in the entire movie was…C-3PO! Every single line of his generated a full-audience laugh, except, of course, for those that made us all cry. (Too bad that one was in the trailer…and that its emotional resonance was undercut by R2-D2 restoring his memory at the end anyway.)\n\nResolution\n\nThe most unforgivable omission by the end of this movie was that we never. found out. What Finn was trying to say to Rey the whole movie?! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, but that’s not the type of mystery that keeps on giving, that’s a straight-up instance of terrible writing. You cannot leave something so specific and so centrally character-based unresolved by the end of the movie. For the record, in the (100% canon) Resistance Reborn book by Rebecca Roanhorse, Finn explicitly tells Poe that he and Rey are “just friends,” so he can NOT have wanted to tell her that he loves her. John Boyega himself confirmed this on Twitter, and J.J. Abrams specified in a Q&A that Finn was trying to tell her that he’s Force-sensitive.) But, like…did y’all just forget to spell that out in the actual movie?\n\nAnd then, of course, there was Maz Kanata in The Force Awakens saying that the story of how she came into possession of Luke’s lightsaber was “a good question for another time.” What’s the answer? When’s the time?!\n\nIt’s true. All of it.\n\n….Listen, I won’t dismiss the above complaints as mere quibbles. I think some of them are pretty major narrative issues. But it’s interesting to me that I, and all of the Star Wars fans in my immediate circle that I’ve spoken to, walked out of the movie feeling an incredible amount of joy and wonder. (Though it seems like most of my Twitter timeline had the opposite experience, and I fully recognize and respect that everyone has a different opinion. I’m just elaborating on mine!) Certainly, a lot of that comes down to how much mileage you have for what many would call “fan service.” I tend to have a very high tolerance (and appreciation) for fan service moments because, honestly, what would a property like Star Wars even mean without the fandom? Call it a “death of the author” type thing, but I truly believe that fans (and I’m not excluding those who worked on any of these films from that category!) are the lifeblood of a franchise. So, I don’t see anything inherently bad, even from a storytelling perspective, about putting things in a movie that are specifically geared towards making people happy. Making people happy is good. Escapism should be lauded. You know the quote: “The only people who inveigh against escape are jailers.”\n\nI mean, sure, if you have something enormously impactful to say about the nature of heroism or the idea of masks hiding childhood trauma, and you can somehow cram that into a Star Wars movie, wow, amazing, good job. (Alternatively, just watch HBO’s Watchmen.) But I think what it comes down to is this: I don’t need that in my Star Wars movie. In general, the best narratives give us what we need (catharsis) instead of (or in addition to) what we want. And by that metric, which I do ascribe to, I agree that The Rise of Skywalker gives us more of what we want than what we need. But, you know what? I like just getting what I want sometimes, too.\n\nWe need to talk about Rey…\n\nI have many, many issues with the way Rey’s character was treated in The Last Jedi (see: my TLJ article, linked up at the beginning of this post), so in my view, there was nowhere to go but up for her in TROS. And in terms of Rey’s parentage, it honestly makes no difference to me whether Rey is a Palpatine or whether she is truly “no one.” If you liked the reveal (as I did) in The Last Jedi that Rey’s parents were nobody of any significance, and that it doesn’t matter who your parents are…then you can stick with that mindset in TROS, since it doesn’t matter that Palpatine is her grandfather. Her arc is still the same; the belonging she seeks is not behind her, it is ahead of her. She needs to make a family for herself, and overcome the darkness within her. Check and check. (For a more eloquent and personal analysis of the beauty of Rey’s arc, check out this piece on the importance of found families by Kate Sánchez over at But Why Tho?.)\n\nThere were also some sweet callbacks in this movie to her character in TFA: When Rey wears the old-school X-Wing helmet while piloting Luke’s X-Wing on her way to confront her known destiny, it’s reminiscent of when scavenger Rey put on the old-school helmet while sitting outside her AT-AT home, pondering her yet-unknown destiny. And when Rey uses a piece of metal to slide down into the Lars homestead on Tatooine at the very end of the movie, it reminds us of the very first scene we meet Rey, when she slides down a sand dune on Jakku after digging through the ruins of the fallen Star Destroyer.\n\n(Um, okay. So. It’s impossible to talk about Rey’s arc without talking about The Kiss. To be quite blunt, I don’t want to talk about it because it represents the terrifying validation of all of my deepest fears. At least the movie made it easy enough to literally just blink at the right time and pretend it never happened!!!)\n\n…and also everyone else\n\nRose. Oh, Rose. Since it unfortunately does not go without saying, I obviously think Kelly Marie Tran is a delightful human being and that she deserves all of our love and respect. I also think that, through no fault of her own, her character in The Last Jedi is wildly underwritten and underserved.* So I was admittedly a bit gratified to see her sidelined in TROS, because I simply had no interest in spending time with what was initially presented as a dull and pointless character. Having said that, I absolutely believe that there is always a need for more diversity in Star Wars, and I’m disappointed in JJ and Chris Terrio for refusing to find a way to breathe more life into this character, and instead lazily and awkwardly sidelining her for the entirety of the movie. My dudes, your job is to make me care about her, not wave your hands and hope she disappears on her own.\n\nJannah and Zorii: I actually really liked the addition of these two characters. Their backstories and relevance to the narrative were simple but effective, both in the thematic, emotional sense and in the practical, plot-relevant sense. (And they both have ROCKIN’ costumes. Can’t wait to drool over those cosplays!) I’m seeing some chatter about Zorii’s existence essentially straightwashing Poe’s character, but, fam, come on. Have a little imagination! I’ve always seen Poe as the “will flirt with anything with a pulse” kind of a guy, so the notion of him having a past with Zorii didn’t bother me in the slightest.\n\nBut hey, now that I mention it, let’s talk about Poe Dameron, shall we?\n\nAfter the complete decimation of Poe’s character in The Last Jedi (I like the attempted arc of having Poe learn about ~leadership responsibility~, but do you really have to turn him into a complete idiot and an unlikeable misogynist in the process?), I was thrilled to see so much of him being an utter delight in The Rise of Skywalker – cracking jokes, being flirty, being lighthearted but also vulnerable, and actually moving the plot along rather than impeding it. Oscar Isaac is a venerated, veteran actor, and it shows. His facial expressions, his body language…he elevates the emotion of every scene he’s in, and every line he delivers is ripe with layers of meaning and oh my god can we just talk about Stormpilot already??\n\nGod bless Oscar Isaac forever and ever, this hero of a man, this pure and precious champion of all that is good and true in the world!!!\n\nWhat can be said about Oscar “Finnpoe rights” Isaac that hasn’t been said already? Oscar can’t stop, won’t stop talking about how he did his darndest with the material he was given to make his character as queer as humanly possible. And I’d argue that he absolutely succeeded. I mean, the glances of pure longing Poe gives Finn throughout the movie, the whole “jealous boyfriend” act? He didn’t have to sit so close to Finn when they’re flying around in the Millennium Falcon on their married space adventure at the beginning of the movie, he didn’t have to clutch Finn so damn tight when they hug after the final battle, tenderly cupping the back of his head and burying his face in Finn’s neck…but he goddamn well did. And I honestly wonder how much of Poe’s dialogue was thrown in by Oscar out of sheer defiance – when he says to Finn, “I can’t do this alone, I need you in command with me” before Finn can get a word out, Finn pauses briefly to acknowledge Poe’s statement before immediately launching into what he was going to say when they walked up to each other, which to me felt a little like John was just following the script while Oscar was legit throwing out a Finnpoe proposal before anyone could stop him…And the whole mystery of what Finn wanted to tell Rey might not have been such a glaring plothole if Oscar hadn’t kept bringing it up every five seconds whenever there was about to be a scene change…\n\nOkay, okay, now I’m sounding a bit like a raging conspiracy theorist. But what is undoubtedly neither a conspiracy nor a theory is that Oscar Isaac gave a very intentionally queer performance and that is beautiful and perfect. The end.\n\nThe other acting MVP is, without a doubt, Mr. Adam Driver. I’ll be honest: I didn’t give a damn about Kylo Ren going into this movie. My one main problem with The Force Awakens is that it sets up Kylo as the butt of a joke (“Do you talk first? Do I talk first?”) rather than as a truly terrifying villain – or even as a sad and murdery boy to be reckoned with. But Adam Driver’s (finally!) mask-less performance in The Rise of Skywalker – from the way his entire physical presence changes when he shifts from Kylo Ren to Ben Solo, to the way his voice cracks and his face crumbles when he says the word “Dad” – holy hell, did this guy deliver a performance for the ages. When Ben ignites that blue lightsaber to fight the Knights of Ren, I felt an unmistakable thrill of triumph. I didn’t want to care about Kylo Ren, but Adam Driver was out there giving that performance and having none of my bullshit.\n\nThings that made me fistpump and cry:\n\nHan’s exasperated “That’s not how the Force works!” line in The Force Awakens may have been one of the funniest lines of the sequel trilogy, but I’m officially going on record as being A-OK with Star Wars writers doing whatever the hell they want with “the Force.” It’s a mystical concept, okay? Force healing – sure! Force jumping – amazing! Force ghosts – can do all sorts of cool shit!! That Force bond chatroom thing Rian Johnson invented in TLJ – super cool! And I love that JJ made this last one a key element of TROS; the scene of Rey dropping her lightsaber into Ben’s hands through their Force bond was an incredibly satisfying payoff for that particular Force power and their connected character arcs as well.\n\nAnd look, you can call these Force powers “deus ex machina” conveniences all you want, but why stop there? Why not point out how unrealistic it is that every planet in the movie has a breathable atmosphere? Or wonder how Rey managed to find a dry cleaner to get all of that dirt and blood out of her white outfit before her visit to Tatooine at the end of the movie? You could go on forever. I mean, the Force is supposed to be the deus ex machina of the Star Wars universe. It is quite literally a god-like, spiritual power.\n\nSo, how ‘bout we finally check off all of those so-called fan-service moments that filled my heart with joy…\n\nMaz handing Leia’s medal from A New Hope over to Chewie? Wonderful. I cried.\n\nHan showing up in Ben’s memory? Heartbreaking. I cried.\n\nRey calling Leia “master”? Everything I could have ever wanted. I cried.\n\nForce Ghost Luke raising the X-Wing? Epic. I cried.\n\nRey shooting iconic Palpatine Force lightning from her hands? Fuck yeah. I screamed.\n\nThe revelation that Leia was secretly training to be a Jedi with Luke? EU perfection. I cried.\n\nHearing the voice of Ahsoka Tano, light of my life, on the big screen, in an actual live-action Star War? I missed it the first time because it was way too brief, but yeah, I caught it the second time and YEP, cried.\n\nChewie’s reaction to Leia’s death? Back up the fucking kleenex truck.\n\n–\n\nIntroducing Rey to the Force in The Last Jedi, Luke tells Rey to breathe, reach out, and tell him what she sees. When talking about The Rise of Skywalker, I’m tempted to echo Rey’s response: Light. Darkness. A balance.\n\nHmm. Maybe it was the perfect Star Wars movie after all…\n\n*My new hot take about The Last Jedi is that it shouldn’t have been a saga film at all, but rather a Rose Tico: A Star Wars Story situation, where we see this plucky new character, Rose, take Finn on a sidequest adventure to learn about greed and corruption across the galaxy. DJ’s character and the entire Canto Bight sequence could have been fleshed out into a full movie with colorful new characters and deeply relevant themes that I think I would have enjoyed immensely if it had not taken away from Rey’s more central journey.\n\nLost, Fringe, Doctor Who, Star Trek, The Flash, Harry Potter, Legends of Tomorrow, even Game of Thrones. Why do so many of the stories we love involve time travel?\n\nAny discussion of time travel stories would be lacking without a nod to what may be the most popular genre of the mainstream time travel narrative: romance.\n\nOn Fringe, “White Tulip” features a romance plot that fuels Alistair Peck’s desire to reunite with his dead fiancée. Audrey Niffenegger’s best-selling 2003 novel The Time Traveler’s Wife set the bar for 21st-century time travel romances, and indeed, the 2006 Doctor Who episode “The Girl in the Fireplace,” penned by current Doctor Who showrunner Steven Moffat, was directly inspired by Niffenegger’s tale of love and loss. Nearly every story ever told hinges on the theme of love, and time travel stories are no exception.\n\nNearly every story ever told hinges on the theme of love, and time travel stories are no exception.\n\n“At the end of the day, time travel is just a plot device— it’s never really about time travel, it’s about the characters and their relationships,” says Damon Lindelof, former showrunner for Lost (2004-2010). “So, even the best time travel stories, like The Terminator or Back to the Future— two very different kinds of time travel stories— are really about the same thing.”\n\nBack to the Future, that madcap adventure of Oedipal hijinks and science fiction shenanigans, grounds its tale in a twist on the typical love story— to fix his future, Marty McFly needs to get his parents to fall in love in the past— and is propelled by the none-too-subtle Huey Lewis and the News hit “The Power of Love.” Stripped down to its bare-bones narrative, The Terminator is about Kyle Reese traveling back in time and falling in love with Sarah Connor, Skynet be damned.\n\nThe TV show Lost, for all its metaphysical mysteries, is perhaps remembered most fondly for the romance between Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick) and Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger), a love story that reaches its pinnacle in the season four episode “The Constant.”The episode served up double helpings of brain-busting twists and heart-wrenching drama, epitomizing everything that was excellent about the show— and, indeed, everything that is so exhilarating about time travel tales.\n\nAs in X-Men: Days of Future Past— and, Lindelof says, inspired by Kurt Vonnegut‘s Slaughterhouse Five— “The Constant” uses the Brain Method of time travel, moving a person’s consciousness (rather than body) through time. Unlike in X-Men, this time travel is uncontrollable, unexpected, and ultimately fatal— as we observe in the case of poor George Minkowski, who is already at the late stages of the affliction when we meet him in this episode. (In true Lost fashion, the character is named after a notable figure— in this case, Hermann Minkowski, the super rad mathematician who actually coined the term “spacetime.”)\n\nTraveling from the mysterious island to an equally as mysterious freighter, Desmond begins experiencing “consciousness jumps” between 1996 (the past) and 2004 (the present). At the urging of scientist Daniel Faraday in 2004, Desmond sets out to find the younger Faraday at Oxford in 1996, who in turn tells Desmond to find a “constant”— something or someone familiar in both times. He settles on Penny, his former girlfriend, recalling the picture of him and Penny that his 2004 self had been studying on the way to the freighter. The photograph is the link between the two times, and Penny is his constant.\n\nThe only issue is that 1996 Penny has no desire to see or speak to Desmond. In fact, she wants nothing to do with him anymore. And she changed her number. And moved.\n\nWith the time jumps occurring more and more frequently, Desmond seeks out Penny’s (totally evil!!) father, Charles Widmore, who provides Penny’s address after a severe talking-to. He remarks— in a thoroughly disparaging tone indicative of how (un)successful he thinks Desmond is going to be— that what Desmond really wants is for Penny to give him another chance.\n\nOne of the most thrilling aspects of this episode is the breakneck speed of the plot, but this scene pauses the action for a concentrated meditation on Desmond’s personal regrets, specifically when it comes to Penny. When he arrives at her doorstep, she reacts in the manner predicted by her father, angrily telling Desmond that “it’s too late to change things.” But Desmond makes his case— without going to much into the whole “my head will explode because time travel” thing— and secures her phone number.\n\n“I won’t call for eight years,” he promises her. Indeed, eight years pass for her, but only seconds for Desmond (and us), as his consciousness is zapped back to his 2004 self, and, trembling, he dials the number from memory. Buoyed by an impeccably strong storyline leading up to the ensuing phone call, the scene is one that truly earns its emotional payoff— not least because of the way the story plays with our conceptions about the passage of time.\n\nFittingly, Penny and Desmond’s eventual connection all depends on an act of faith— Penny taking Desmond at his word, forgiving him, and trusting that he would call. Desmond, in turn, can do nothing after she slams the door in his face but hope that she, too, would keep her word.\n\n“At the heart of everything, long before Flight 815 crashed on that island, this love story powers the meta-narrative of ‘Lost,'” says Lindelof.\n\nThe time travel in this episode enables Desmond to exorcise his biggest regret by expressing his love for Penny at a time when the stakes could not be higher, as his own health deteriorates and the fate of his fellow castaways hangs in the balance. Having witnessed their fall-out in previous seasons, we find Desmond’s climactic reconnection with Penny enormously fulfilling on an emotional level. And in terms of the structure of the show, their relationship is what eventually enables Penny to provide rescue for the survivors of Oceanic flight 815.\n\nLindelof and his Lost co-writers spent close to a month crafting “The Constant,” an episode they knew would be key to the entire show because it distilled the overall Lost narrative down to the fate of a single relationship.\n\n“By the time ‘The Constant’ aired, the Desmond and Penny love story was repositioned as the essential love story of the entire series,” Lindelof says. “At the heart of everything, long before Flight 815 crashed on that island, this love story powers the meta-narrative of Lost. It wasn’t just an episode that was a fun little excursion from the main storytelling, it really plugged into and essentially rewrote and reframed the entire narrative of the series.”\n\n“The Constant” resonates so strongly because it is, at its heart, a love story, and one between two characters in whom audiences have been invested since their introduction. For Desmond, there is a supreme sense of catharsis because he has finally gotten what he needs: a reconciliation with a lost love.\n\n“This show is about loss,” Lindelof says, “and these two people have found each other again. There’s also this hopeful aspect to the way the episode ends, that even though Desmond ends up back on the island where he started, there’s a fundamental level of fulfillment that he accomplished his mission.”\n\nBelow, watch the fated phone call in action.

If you choose that option, hit me up, I have some questions…\n\nJust like the hooded Sith Lord looming over his six “Star Wars” films, George Lucas has built himself an empire. After writing and directing the acclaimed “THX-1138” (1971) and “American Graffiti” (1973), Lucas threw his heart and mind into “Star Wars,” the epic space opera which hit theaters in 1977 and would go on to redefine science fiction cinema for decades to come. Inspired by Akira Kurosawa’s fast-paced adventure movies and drawing heavily from Joseph Campbell’s conception of the monomyth, the original “Star Wars” trilogy blended visually stunning action sequences with mystical themes while endearing the public to swashbuckling heroes, lovable scoundrels and rebellious princesses. Of course, there are villains in this saga as well, and Lucas himself became one as despised as the dark Emperor himself after the release “Star Wars” prequels, starting with “The Phantom Menace” in 1999. The man who created “Star Wars” was now accused of ruining it all with half-baked origin stories, mind-numbing politicizing and cringe-inducing dialogue. Where was the magic of the original trilogy? These were not the prequels the fans were looking for.\n\nI was nine when “The Phantom Menace” was released. That year, I dressed up as Queen Amidala (Natalie Portman) for the Jewish holiday of Purim; pickings were slim back then as far as female Star Wars characters go. After hearing so much about the legendary original trilogy from my father, I was thrilled to finally have a trilogy of my own; as a result, I loved the movies on sight. Years later, when I realized how universally maligned the prequels were, pure nostalgia compelled me to their defense. But even from a critical perspective, taking a closer look at the prequel trilogy reveals a thematically layered, visually arresting, and compellingly tragic tale that doesn’t get the credit it deserves. The second of the prequels, “Attack of the Clones” (2002) marks the pinnacle of storytelling acumen as it reflects the larger whole, weaving together individual threads of cinematic achievement to display a tapestry as bold and spellbinding as the myth it encapsulates.\n\nMuch like the recently released and well-regarded “Episode VII: The Force Awakens,” “Attack of the Clones” takes its cues from the original trilogy, capitalizing on the nostalgia factor with specific callbacks to Episodes Four through Six: Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) enter a cantina on Coruscant reminiscent of the memorable site of the shooting spree between Han Solo and Greedo at Mos Eisley. While there, Obi-Wan’s cheeky use of the Jedi mind-trick— “You don’t want to sell me deathsticks,” he purrs to a skeevy-looking low-life— alludes to Alec Guinness’s original rendition of “These aren’t the droids you’re looking for” in “Episode IV: A New Hope.” Another line that has become a gleefully implemented running joke throughout the series— “I have a bad feeling about this”— is wryly uttered by Anakin as he, Padmé Amidala (Natalie Portman) and Obi-Wan face impending doom in a Geonosis battle arena. These meta-textual moments are pure, unadulterated fun—admit it, you cracked a grin— but they also serve to situate the film within the larger context of the George Lucas canon, feeding into the epic scope of a six-part story of the rise and fall of good and evil.\n\nTo express the integral connection between the two trilogies, Lucas meticulously designed the prequels to “rhyme” with the originals. In “Attack of the Clones,” this plays out in the cinematic mirroring of shots and sequences, as with Han hiding his Millennium Falcon on the side of the the larger Star Destroyer in “The Empire Strikes Back” and Obi-Wan pulling the same trick on the side of an asteroid. There is also a dismembered Skywalker scene, a blossoming romance, and a bounty hunter called Fett. The deliberate parallels— and there are many— link the films visually and thematically. Lucas certainly knew what he was doing, and a careful viewer of the prequels will pick up on these enticing, metaphorically significant cues.\n\n“Attack of the Clones” contains just enough politicizing to make the galaxy far, far away feel real, but it wisely fixates more intensely on the grander themes of good, evil, and the sliding scale between the two. The pulsating dramatic tension of the prequels hinges on the knowledge of what comes later, and the film capitalizes on this by building up the hubris of the Jedi in anticipation of their eventual— and inevitable— fall. While life in the Jedi Temple peacefully flourishes, Obi-Wan pokes around looking for the planet of Kamino— a stormy world signifying the upcoming unrest. The planet, however, evades his grasp, and the temple archivist declares with haughty finitude that “if an item does not appear in our records, it does not exist!”\n\nAt the beginning of the film, after Padmé is targeted for assassination, she correctly identifies the mastermind as Count Dooku, but the Jedi dismiss her with similarly misplaced confidence: “Count Dooku was once a Jedi,” Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) says. “He wouldn’t assassinate anyone.” Ki-Adi-Mundi (Silas Carson) agrees: “He’s a political idealist, not a murderer.” Even when Obi-Wan, captured and shackled, engages in conversation with Dooku himself, Obi-Wan refuses to believe Dooku’s tales about the rise of the nefarious Sith. Though the dark side clouds the Force, the narrative implications are clear: these esteemed Jedi Knights, keepers of the peace and guardians of the good, have become arrogant. In a manner befitting a Shakespearean tragedy, the heroes of the democratic republic are becoming the very cause of its downfall.\n\nThe prequel trilogy also inverts the traditional hero’s journey by placing Anakin Skywalker— destined to torment the galaxy as Darth Vader— as its protagonist, and “Attack of the Clones” features the incident that precipitated Anakin’s turn to the dark side: the capture and death of his mother. As Anakin converses with Padmé before racing off, the camera briefly pans to their silhouettes, where Darth Vader’s helmet is prominently profiled on Anakin’s head, a powerful image foreshadowing (quite literally) what’s to come. Upon discovering his mother’s fate, Anakin slaughters the entire village of raiders in a fit of rage, and Hayden Christensen sells every beat of visceral, emotional trauma as John William’s iconic “Imperial March” crescendos in the background. It’s one of the truly cathartic scenes depicting Anakin Skywalker’s descent, and from the camerawork to the acting, it’s orchestrated beautifully.\n\nWe can identify with Anakin’s journey because we feel that he is right to question the Jedi’s loftiness and stark emotional abstinence. Humans without feelings are more like particularly skilled droids, or clones. And it is Anakin, in a moment of omniscient wisdom, who lays out the paradox at the heart of the Jedi code. It is well known that attachment and possession are forbidden to a Jedi, he tells Padmé. However: “Compassion, which I would define as unconditional love, is essential to a Jedi’s life. So you might say that we are encouraged to love.” That Anakin is constantly chastised for embracing love— that is the true tragedy.\n\nOther characters also make the most of their moments in the spotlight, such as the late Christopher Lee, playing to his strengths as the deliciously diabolical Dooku, and the hapless droid C-3PO (voiced by Anthony Daniels), spouting punny one-liners and unintentional social commentary at every turn. (“You obviously still have a lot to learn about human behavior,” C-3PO tells R2-D2 as Padmé and Anakin hurry away. “If they had wanted our help, they would have asked for it!”) The character of Padmé may feel underdeveloped in the previous film and is egregiously mishandled in the subsequent one, but her role in “Attack of the Clones” is prominent and most reminiscent of that of her future daughter and feminist icon, Princess Leia. When Anakin interrupts her in political proceedings on her home planet, she firmly puts him in his place, and while the Galactic Senate defers in worshipful reverence to the Jedi, Padmé speaks up, holding her own as a sharp-minded politician who strives tirelessly to sustain democratic ideals. As the opposition leader against the shady “Separatists,” Padmé is a strong public figure, and she proves that she can go toe-to-toe on personal matters as well.\n\nBut the most complex relationship of the prequels is that of Anakin and Obi-Wan, as “Attack of the Clones” explores the deep connection that has emerged between stern master and wayward pupil, between father figure and prodigal son. Every interaction between the pair is laced with an undercurrent of gloom arising from the audience’s knowledge of Obi-Wan’s fate at the hand of Darth Vader in “A New Hope.” “Why do I get the feeling you’re going to be the death of me?” Obi-Wan jests at the beginning of “Attack of the Clones.” It’s a gem of a line, dripping with tragic irony. But it also reflects the easy rapport enjoyed by the two characters, and, indeed, by the two actors. McGregor and Christensen bring out the best in each other (unsurprising in a film otherwise riddled with CGI characters); both seem to truly enjoy trading dry quips and witty banter, and that boyish enthusiasm is contagious. I happen to enjoy Christensen’s monotone poutiness— Anakin is supposed to be a moody teenager, after all— and it balances well with Obi-Wan’s holier-than-thou snark. McGregor especially shines, fleshing out a character previously recognized more as an icon than a human being with hopes and fears of his own.\n\n“Attack of the Clones” showcases this legendary partnership at its apex, teasing a myriad off-screen adventures as well. Meanwhile, we witness the beginning of an insidious tension creeping into their relationship; an austere Obi-Wan forbids Anakin to form personal attachments, as is the Jedi way, even while he himself unwittingly fosters a closeness with Anakin. Obi-Wan also frequently berates Anakin for acting rashly, specifically when it comes to the protection of one Padmé Amidala. Yet it is Obi-Wan who instinctively hurls himself out of a window in order to catch a probe droid after Padmé’s life is threatened yet again. Though the two present vastly different exteriors, they are more alike than they might expect— hence the close, brotherly connection, and hence the heartbreak as their fates diverge.\n\nThe film’s score traces these transformations every step of the way. John Williams’s “Imperial March” hums ominously in the background whenever Anakin dips into the dark side, and it explodes triumphantly as the newly created Clone Army (later to turn on the Republic— another blurring of good and evil) marches onto the scene to close out the film. A new John Williams composition makes its debut as well, becoming an instant classic: “Across the Stars,” the hopeful yet mournful theme of Anakin and Padmé, the title alone alluding to the Romeo-and-Juliet tragedy of the star-crossed lovers. At the end of “Attack of the Clones,” “The Imperial March” bleeds into “Across the Stars” as scenes of the marching clones give way to Anakin and Padmé’s secret wedding. The stage is set in these two closing shots: the fall of democracy, the rise of evil, and the blossoming of a doomed love.\n\n“Attack of the Clones” was also notable for its pioneering special effects, and indeed, the dazzling visuals of this film still stand apart. Some of the CGI can be deemed excessive, but taken as a whole, it illustrates Lucas’s unparalleled penchant for world-building. Each alien rendered onscreen captivates the imagination, from Ki-Adi-Mundi’s enlarged cranium to Mas Amedda’s blue-skinned, quadra-horned visage. Each planet retains an infinite index of unique characteristics as well, from the opulent palaces of Naboo to the tech-noir metropolis of Coruscant— which serves as the setting for an exhilarating speeder chase— and Kamino, the water world on which Obi-Wan and bounty hunter Jango Fett engage in a rain-drenched, Mortal Kombat-style duel.\n\nFrom the cantina on Coruscant to— yes— the lake on Naboo, “Attack of the Clones” features some of the most compelling characters, tragic themes, and awe-inducing visuals and music the Star Wars universe has to offer. Search your feelings— you know it to be true. You only have to let go of your hate and embrace the emotional journey unfolding right in front of you.\n\n“Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” is a tale of two cities, a tale of two superheroes, and a tale of cinematic paradoxes. There is both clunky dialogue and profound expressions of ideology, story pacing problems and exceptional editing, flat characters and characters with dramatic arcs. And there is despair— lots of it— but also a glimmer of hope (just take a peek at the second half of the title). When the critical fire and brimstone clears, what is left very well may be a fascinating, finely-tuned film worth seeing and worth rooting for. Yes, hater in the front row: even Batfleck.\n\nFrom the interminable string of trailers, Snapchat filters, posters, and interviews with actors of other superhero franchises, every promotion for “Batman v. Superman” bills it as an epic showdown between two titans of comic book lore, akin to Marvel’s own upcoming “Captain America: Civil War.” But it’s not really about that fight— and least, not the physical one, though that sequence certainly does deliver on bone-rattling spectacle. Batman (Ben Affleck) and Superman (Henry Cavill) only start raining down blows on each other in the last third of the movie, and the fight dissipates rather suddenly (many would say too suddenly, but I was both moved and satisfied. More on that later). No, Zack Snyder’s unsurprisingly bleak yet surprisingly resonant film crackles with contemporary relevance, tapping into xenophobic fear-mongering and addressing moral and spiritual disillusionment. Perhaps I’m giving Snyder a bit too much credit— here’s the guy who said it was okay that Superman inadvertently razed half a city in this film’s precursor, 2013’s “Man of Steel,” because “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” destroyed an entire planet. (Um, Zack? Those billions of people in “Star Wars” were murdered by the bad guys.) But I won’t deny what’s right there on the screen, and even if the film fumbles with answers, it deserves praise, at least, for asking the pertinent questions.\n\n“Batman v. Superman” takes its comic book inspiration from Frank Miller’s seminal four-issue miniseries, “The Dark Knight Returns,” and the multi-arc Doomsday narrative, so fans of both can already guess at the film’s trajectory. (Given opening weekend box office grosses, though, knowing what’s going to happen isn’t exactly keeping fans away.) After an abridged but artful explanation of the Batman origin story, the film dives into the aforementioned destruction of Metropolis in “Man of Steel,” this time from the perspective of a horrified Bruce Wayne. Already we’re offered a salient (if unintended) bit of meta-commentary: for those of us who were deeply disturbed by the unchecked devastation at the end of “Man of Steel,” Batman’s got our back— and so begins his fervent mistrust of the mighty and seemingly impenetrable Superman. Though it may seem self-serving to begin a sequel with a sizzle-reel from the franchise’s previous film, it works here, framing “Batman v. Superman” as a feature-length response to its own controversy.\n\nThe plot, at times numbingly complicated and at others thinly underdeveloped, can be summed up like so: Batman and Superman disagree with the other’s dispensation of justice. Thanks to some prodding from Jesse Eisenberg’s “psychotic” Lex Luthor— and because this is a Zack Snyder superhero movie— their ideological spat naturally escalates to violence. Say what you will about Snyder’s philosophical motivations, but his lush visuals make movie-goers feel like they’re right beside the action rather than merely in front of it. The film’s score stands apart as well; collaborating with multi-instrumentalist Junkie XL, musical magician Hans Zimmer ratchets up the emotion of unfolding drama with an operatic, “Star Wars”-esque theme, while the hopeful, Smallville-evoking tune from “Man of Steel” seeps into the background of more tender moments. Wonder Woman’s electric war drum theme starts to feel a bit grating when it kicks in for the fifth time, but, hey, the first four cues were pretty epic, amiright? For Themyscira!\n\nWith the immediate introduction of so many larger-than-life figures and set pieces, the film stumbles a bit coming out of the gate. But in other ways, the editing masterfully evokes the parallel journeys of our two superheroes: a close-up of Clark’s iconic glasses transitions to a shot of Batman’s equally iconic “Batarang” gadget; Clark approaching a smoldering ruin near his Fortress of Solitude shifts to Bruce standing in the rubble of Wayne Manor; and Clark watching news footage of Batman’s crime-fighting antics is interspliced with Bruce doing his own digging on the Man of Steel. Unfortunately, other scenes are laid out like puzzle pieces that don’t quite fit together: a flashback here, a different flashback there, a convoluted dream sequence (or two…or three…), journeys from Nairobi to Metropolis and from the Indian Ocean to Gotham. Frankly, it’s exhausting. But perhaps there is a metaphor to be gleaned here, as Snyder’s scattered movie and broken superheroes reflect a contemporary society equally as shattered.\n\n“Batman v. Superman” was penned by Chris Terrio (an Oscar winner for “Argo”) and David S. Goyer, the latter of whom received a story credit for Christopher Nolan’s groundbreaking “Dark Knight” trilogy, the first hugely successful superhero franchise in the post 9/11 age (aside from Sam Raimi’s tonally different “Spider-Man”). This film falls far from the psycho-ethical thrill of “The Dark Knight,” which is arguably the best superhero movie of all time. But 15 years after 9/11, when terrorist attacks have become the numbing norm rather than a watershed event, Snyder’s film feels adroitly reflective of the state of our fractured world. These are conflicted heroes wrestling with the relation between power and morality, while humanity— through newscast-ready soundbites— debates the same. As Lex Luthor gleefully insists: “If God is all-powerful, He cannot be good. If God is good, He cannot be all-powerful.” Perhaps referring to Superman as “God” feels extreme; perhaps I occupy the niche spot in a bizarre Venn Diagram of people who are religious and intellectual and huge comic book nerds, but I actually do agonize over such matters, and it’s apparent that Snyder does too. Even so, let’s think things through from a practical standpoint: if an alien from Krypton were to land on our humble blue planet, people would react a lot like they do in “Batman v. Superman”—with equal parts Messianic reverence and fear. Snyder unashamedly feeds into the former; every time Superman is struck down or the Dark Knight rises, another Christ figure is displayed, and smoking crucifixes adorn the blazing aftermath of the climactic final battle. The entire film is a baptism by fire and water, and it’s both aesthetically and morally affecting.\n\nDisturbingly, however, Batman reacts to “the Superman problem” with fear. “He has the power to wipe out the entire human race,” Bruce Wayne says to his butler and confidante, Alfred (Jeremy Irons), “and if we believe there’s even a one percent chance that he is our enemy, we have to take it as an absolute certainty.” That’s the type of damning rhetoric we’ve been hearing from the Republican party. To make matters worse, Bruce consistently refers to Superman as an “alien,” which, although true in a literal sense, reveals an undercurrent of mistrust and hostility that shouldn’t exist in the souls of our supposed “heroes.” And yet, I still found the Batman arc compelling because of its resolution— Batman and Superman don’t, of course, go on brawling indefinitely, and though the reason for their sudden team-up can be viewed as contrived, it’s stirring because it promotes the commonality needed to breach the distance between two alleged “others.” Incredibly, Ben Affleck manages to sell this jaded, dangerously mistaken hero for the entire journey. Affleck’s tired eyes betray Batman’s wounded soul, and a defiled Robin suit hanging in the Batcave hints at a past tragedy that still haunts him. Chin up, Sadfleck: you done pretty good.\n\nWhat’s more, these heroes are facing villains that embody opposing reactions to this chaotic world: mindlessly destructive anarchy, as exhibited by the barely sentient Doomsday, and nihilistic glee, carried out by Eisenberg’s Lex Luthor. Though the villains represent intriguing prototypes of morality, the way each plays out in the film is, admittedly, pretty disastrous. The entire Doomsday plot brings nothing but befuddlement and a draining final act, and should have been cut outright. As for Luthor: Jesse Eisenberg seems to be making a career out of playing painfully awkward geniuses, and to his credit, many of his roles optimize that trait, from Mark Zuckerberg in “The Social Network” to David Lipsky in “The End of the Tour.” Here, Eisenberg embodies Superman’s archenemy like a Zuckerbergian Moriarty of the Andrew Scott variety infused (somewhat desperately) with a dash of Heath Ledger’s Joker. Naturally, it’s a total mess. Though he has a few good lines that resonate, most of his pontificating on the problem of evil lands with a resolute thump, and his invocations of— by my count— Lucifer, Jesus, Icarus and Prometheus serve more to confuse the audience than to illuminate age-old mythological truths. (Perhaps Luthor’s Prometheus shout-out—cheekily uttered while Clark, Bruce and Wonder Woman’s alter-ego, Diana Prince, are all sneaking around under his nose, not paying attention in the slightest to the madman with the mic— reflects a twisted motivation to “save mankind,” but the message is too far buried to count for much.)\n\nAnd then there’s Superman himself. Snyder backed himself into a corner with an uncharacteristically gritty portrayal of America’s ur-superhero in “Man of Steel,” forgoing truth, justice, and the American way for anguish and uncertainty. Like his Gotham-based counterpart, Superman does go through a drastic transformation over the course of “Batman v. Superman,” but Snyder’s iteration of the character is still the weak point of the budding DC cinematic universe. Superman should be the focal point, the beacon of light and hope and all that is good and true. But after “Batman v. Superman,” I have hope that Snyder is building towards a grand rebirth that will showcase a lighter hero. We just have to have a little faith.\n\n“Superman v. Batman” is undoubtedly a ponderous film. Tapping into culturally relevant paranoia as well as the nature of heroism, the film aims for the brilliance of Nolan’s “The Dark Knight” but falls towards the heavy-handedness of “The Dark Knight Rises”– which is, of course, impressive in its own right. “Batman v. Superman” is overstuffed on plot and rushed when it comes to introducing major game-changers, and the female characters don’t fare too well in terms of overturning decades of damsel in distress tropes. But there’s a lot to appreciate here, too. Snyder takes all of these characters so seriously that he entrusts them with the fundamental questions that plague the human race, and perhaps it’s too much, too soon. As Luthor would say, Snyder, like Icarus, flew too close to the sun. Luckily, he’s dealing with a mythic being who doesn’t need wax wings to fly. Godspeed, Mr. Snyder: The Justice League awaits."
