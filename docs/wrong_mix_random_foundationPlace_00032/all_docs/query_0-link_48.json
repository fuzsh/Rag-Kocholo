        "text": "This paper takes self-tracking culture as the subject matter and provides an example of systematic academic literature review that explores the relationship between culture and nature. It illustrates how the embedding trajectory of a technological artefact in the social sphere can be revealed by a categorization process that uses concepts from different knowledge fields (anthropology, psychology, system studies etc.). Moreover, it shows how the interactions between core values of late modernity and core values of modernity and pre-modernity allow the emergence of a conflicting social mechanism of the self-tracking culture. From object to practices, the cultural embedding process of self-tracking devices is described as a function of their hardware or software nature, their self or body focus, their private or collective degree of exposure and their pushed or imposed degree of autonomy. The underling cultural mechanism of the self-tracking culture is portrayed in terms of a balancing...\n\nThis paper critically assesses the discourse around the Quantified Self movement and self-tracking technologies. In particular, the author focuses on how self-tracking technologies and the accumulated data about the self can be positioned as technologies of the self, e.g. by revealing information about the self such that one can change one's behaviour, and technologies for the other, technologies that demand one to view the self through the eyes of a third party to adhere to a norm. The self-tracking technologies and the gathering and sharing of information appear to have blurred the boundaries between the self, the technologies of self-tracking, and other users and developers. On the one hand, the other users are seen as positive entities that support the development of the self, whereas on the other hand, other users are seen as opposing entities that normalize and subject the self through surveillance. The author argues that self-tracking technologies can provide insights into aspect of oneself and strengthen one's autonomy, but that the institutionalising of data gathering is exposing the user to the control of others and, thereby, control over one's self-disclosure is diminished. A case study of three self-tracking technologies (Fitbit, Runkeeper, and Dailymile) explicates this movement.\n\nSince the advent of the smartphone, users have become accustomed to alerts, notifications and reminders to interact with their internet-connected devices. But how do people make sense of prompts to exercise, eat or sleep? Digital self-tracking is a phenomenon that has grown substantially in recent years. However, despite some notable exceptions, there is still little sociological research into how users of wearable devices and apps subjectively experience self-tracking. This article draws on findings from a small qualitative study with 11 participants to reveal eminent themes in how users make sense of their self-tracking. Utilising and extending Lupton’s theorising of self-tracking, we argue for triple roles of self-tracking devices; ‘tool’, ‘toy’ and ‘tutor’. This trichotomy helps to characterise the use of self-tracking devices and apps, allowing us to reflect on the wider, ongoing implications of self-tracking.\n\nPersonal Informatics (PI), also known as Quantified Self (QS), is a school of thought which aims to use technology for acquiring and collecting data on different aspects of the daily lives of people. These data can be internal states (such as mood or glucose level in the blood) or indicators of performance (such as the kilometers run). Some research was conducted in order to discover the problems related to the usage of PI tools, although none investigated how common users use these tools for tracking their behavior. The goal of this paper is to provide some insights about challenges and open issues regarding the usage of PI tools from the point of view of a common user. To this aim, we provide a theoretical background of personal informatics and a brief review on the previous studies that have investigated the usage pattern of PI tools.\n\nOver the last 5 years, wearable technology – comprising devices whose embedded sensors and analytic algorithms can track, analyze and guide wearers' behavior – has increasingly captured the attention of venture capitalists, technology startups, established electronics companies and consumers. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted 2 years running at the Consumer Electronics Show and its Digital Health Summit, this article explores the vision of technologically assisted self-regulation that drives the design of wearable tracking technology. As key artifacts in a new cultural convergence of sensor technology and self-care that I call 'data for life', wearables are marketed as digital compasses whose continuous tracking capacities and big-data analytics can help consumers navigate the field of everyday choice making and better control how their bites, sips, steps and minutes of sleep add up to affect their health. By offering consumers a way to simultaneously embrace and outsource the task of lifestyle management, I argue, such products at once exemplify and short-circuit cultural ideals for individual responsibility and self-regulation.\n\nDiverse future scenarios are presented in the expectation that the so-called \" fourth industrial revolution \" will come up, and one of them is a hyper-connected society where technologies such as the internet of things, big data and artificial intelligence converge. We, however, have paid little attention to meaningful signs that can be found in practice, allowing our imagination to rely mainly on future societies predicted by technology visionaries. In this vein, this study explores the settings and practices of wearable self-tracking technologies, which attempt to make humans part of complex networks of hyper-connected society. It examines how our bodies and lives are (re)shaped in an age of hyper-connectivity by analyzing the practices of self-tracking technologies, which steadily and automatically transform users' everyday lives and bodily responses into a series of data. Drawing on the theory of Science and Technology Studies (STS), this article investigates how \" scripts, \" which were initially written to expect and define both humans' and nonhumans' actions and their relationships, have to be rewritten in different settings in which these technologies are situated. That is, the original scripts of these technologies written in well-known \" Quantified Self movement \" are transformed and re-inscribed in concrete settings such as digital healthcare and labor management. Consequently, in contrast to the first script which expected self-empowerment and self-improvement of users, new scripts are rewritten as a \" digital nudge, \" \" extreme Taylorism, \" and \" intimate surveillance \" in these settings. This article concludes that we need to sincerely ask and answer ethical questions concerning these technologies for their realized script to form the world in which we want to live. These efforts to incessantly raise and answer questions concerning decision-making authority, privacy, data ownership, security, and reliability in concrete settings will contribute to making the hyper-connected society that we want to live in."
