        "text": "'An extraordinarily important historical tool '\n\n- Jonathan Romain, The Guardian\n\n'This comprehensive dictionary can be recommended to anyone interested in the remarkable history of the Jews of Britain. Its editors are to be congratulated on a major achievement. The reading and research that have gone into this book have been formidable. The result is that the reader meets the whole spectrum of British Jewish contribution, through the centuries and across the length and breadth of the country. Jewish institutions - such as the Chief Rabbinate and the Board of Deputies of British Jews - and moments in Anglo-Jewish history, - such as the Battle of Cable Street - are also included, as are the cities and towns in which Jews lived, and to whose municipal life they contributed.'\n\n- Sir Martin Gilbert\n\n'In his introduction, the editor-in-chief, Professor William D Rubenstein, asks rhetorically whether a second edition of the volume will ever appear. I hope very much that it will... The Palgrave dictionary is a work of considerable scholarship and (I suspect) a labour of love.' - Geoffrey Alderman, The Jewish Chronicle online"
