        "text": "This paper concentrates on the forecasting performance of different GARCH models in five different stock indexes: Eurostoxx50, Nikkei, FTSE100, S&P500, and CAC. The models which are used to forecast volatility are GARCH(1,1), EGARCH, APARCH, CGARCH, and GJR. This paper will perform an in-sample estimation of these GARCH models and then will compare their out of sample forecasting performance. In addition to that we will perform Diebold-Mariano tests to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the models\n\nSUMMARYThis paper addresses the question of the selection of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (GARCH) models in terms of variance matrix forecasting accuracy, with a particular focus on relatively large‐scale problems. We consider 10 assets from the New York Stock Exchange and compare 125 models based 1‐, 5‐ and 20‐day‐ahead conditional variance forecasts over a period of 10 years using the model confidence set (MCS) and the superior predictive ability (SPA) tests. Model performance is evaluated using four statistical loss functions which account for different types and degrees of asymmetry with respect to over‐/under‐predictions. When considering the full sample, MCS results are strongly driven by short periods of high market instability during which multivariate GARCH models appear to be inaccurate. Over relatively unstable periods, i.e. the dot‐com bubble, the set of superior models is composed of sophisticated specifications such as orthogonal ...\n\nVolatility plays an important role in the field of financial econometrics as one of the risk indicators. Many various models address the problem of modeling the volatilities of financial asset returns. This study provides a new empirical performance comparison of the four different GARCH-type models, namely GARCH, GARCH-M, GJR-GARCH, and log-GARCH models based on simulated data and real data such as the DJIA, S&P 500, and S&P CNX Nifty indices on a daily period from January 2000 to December 2017. We also investigate the estimation results obtained using Solver’Excel and verify those results against the results obtained using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The simulation study showed that the GARCH model is outperformed by other models. Meanwhile, the empirical study provides evidence that the GJR-GARCH model provides the best fitting, followed by the GARCH-M, GARCH, and log-GARCH models. Furthermore, this study recommends the use of Excel’s Solver in practice when the parameter ...\n\nThe effect of misspecification of correct sampling probability distribution of Generalized Autoregressive Conditionally Heteroscedastic (GARCH) processes is considered. The three assumed distributions are the normal, Student t, and generalized error distributions. The GARCH process is sampled using one of the distributions and the model is estimated based on the three distributions in each sample. Parameter estimates and forecast performance are used to judge the estimated model for performance. The AR-GARCH-GED performed better on the three assumed distributions; even, when Student t distribution is assumed, AR-GARCH-Student t does not perform as the best model."
