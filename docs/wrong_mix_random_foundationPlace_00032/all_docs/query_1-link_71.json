        "text": "What is it like to live in Minsk? Would you recommend it? What is the city like?\n\nMinsk is a city you shoud visit, as the concept is very different from European cities, as Vilnius, Warsaw, Riga, Brussels, etc. I spent there 4 years, studying, living, exploring. It's kind of difficult to get used to people over there, as they never smile, never say \"hi\" to you in the store and only some of them speaks English, so probably it could be \"tough\" to live in Minsk, if you are foreigner.\n\nSource\n\nHow much does it cost to live in Minsk?\n\nDepends what kind of life would you like to live. There is a chance to spend about 200$ till... But for sure, if you want to travel and see different sides of Belarus, you may spend more. Minsk became an expensive city in the last 2-3 years. The rent is getting higher and higher. The prices for food also, but transportation is still cheap.\n\nIs it difficult to find accommodation in Minsk? Is there any advice you can give?\n\nYes, if your university wouldn't support your staying here in a dorm, it could be expensive. The price for the rent is about 400-500$ - I'm talking about the whole appartment. If you share, it's going to be less.\n\nIs it good to eat out in Minsk? Can you tell us your favourite spots?\n\nHmmm, it depedns. The prices are very nice during the lunch time, you may get good offers in such places as \"Il Patio\", \"Vasilki\". The food is also kind of \"heavy\" for your stomach, so don't forget to take a nap.\n\nIs the nightlife good in Minsk? Where is good to go?\n\nThe nighlife is absolutely different from West European countries. True, you have to take care of everything. Get ready to pay for each entrance about 10-15$. The bar is also expensive in there. So, pre-drinks are an essential part, if you want to go out.\n\nWhat advice would you give future students heading to Minsk?"
