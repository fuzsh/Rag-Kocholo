The value of the property of the railroads of the Southern Group, in the aggregate, has been found by the Commission, for the purposes of this procedure, to be $2,000,000,000 (the combined property accounts of the railroads as of December 31, 1919, composing this group being $2,183,923,124). granted by the Inter-State Commerce Commission under which While the increase granted the Southern District (25 per cent) is appar¬ An increase in rates has recently been the railroads will now operate. ently not proportionately as peat as in the Eastern (40 per cent) and in the Western (35 per cent) Dis¬ tricts, the Commission was of the opinion that such increase (25 per cent) would, under conditions obtaining at that time, result in rates that will yield a return of 6 per cent on the above-named aggregate value of the property of the carriers in this group.
