On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Moyon Villages. See also Communes of the Manche department References Former communes of Manche\n\n15824606\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushmataha%20Area%20Council\n\nPushmataha Area Council\n\nThe Pushmataha Area Council is part of the Boy Scouts of America. It renders service to Scout units in ten counties of North Mississippi, providing skills training and character development to boys and girls between the ages of 5 and 18. The council also serves boys and girls between the ages of 14 and 21 through Venturing Crews and Explorer posts. In 2007, 24 Eagle Scout ranks were earned in the Pushmataha Area Council, and 20 Scouts earned the God and Country Award. History The Pushmataha Area Council (#691) was established by the Boy Scouts of America in June, 1925. The council was originally named the East Mississippi Council (#691), but this name was changed in 1929 to honor Chief Pushmataha of the Choctaw tribe. Chief Pushmataha once told a group of chiefs that he was not born, but instead stepped, full grown and dressed for battle, from the split in a tree that had been struck by lightning. This story has been incorporated into the Pushmataha Area Council Shoulder Patch shown above. The patch shows a full-grown Pushmataha emerging from a tree struck by lightning. Camp Seminole has a sign on its grounds noting the tree from which Pushmataha supposedly appeared. In 1925, the headquarters of the council was in West Point, Mississippi, on Main Street. In 1960s, the council office was moved to its current location at 420 31st Avenue North, Columbus, Mississippi. The Pushmataha Area Council is one of the smallest Boy Scout councils in America. It is not unusual for other councils to have districts larger than the entire Pushmataha Area Council. In 1950, the council erected a miniature Statue of Liberty in the middle of downtown Columbus, Mississippi, as part of a national effort in the Boy Scouts to erect 200 of these statues. Fewer than 100 of these statues still exist, and even fewer exist intact. The Pushmataha Area Council statue is one of the few intact ones that exist today. When fully staffed with professionals, the Pushmataha Area Council has a Scout Executive, two District Executives, and a full-time Camp Ranger. One District Executive resigned in 2007, and the Executive Board of the council did not hire a replacement for the position. The Camp Ranger resigned in the spring of 2009, and the camp is currently (2010) served by a part-time, volunteer, interim Camp Ranger. The second District Executive resigned in the early fall of 2009, and the council Executive Board did not hire anyone fill that position. The Scout Executive announced in November, 2009 that he was resigning, and as of April, 2010, the Scout Executive position is still vacant. The BSA Regional Director is acting as the official Scout Executive for the council until one is hired. The Regional Director is in another state, and is not present to oversee day-to-day operations of the council. The council is being operated by a small corps of volunteers, and the 2010 FOS campaigns are being run by volunteers with no professional guidance or assistance. The Council President, George Purnell, has been in office for six years. All previous council presidents (1925–2004) served a maximum of three years. Districts When the council began, each town with a Scout troop was its own District. For example, troops in Columbus, Mississippi were in the Columbus District. Later the council evolved into having three districts, the Running Bear District, the Talking Warrior District, and the Tombigbee District. In 1990s, these three districts were reorganized to create two new districts, the Choctaw District and the Chickasaw District. The Choctaw District covers five counties: Clay, Lowndes, Oktibbeha, Webster, and Noxubee. The Chickasaw District also covers five counties: Monroe, Winston, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Calhoun. Events The Pushmataha Area Council hosts numerous events each year. These include: Eagle Recognition Banquet (early spring) Council Pinewood Derby (spring) Summer Camp (June) Cub Scout Day Camp (June) Webelos Resident Camp (June) Cub Scout Leader Specific Training (September — March) Boy Scout Leader Training (late fall) Wood Badge Training (bi-annually) MSU Scout Football Day (fall) MSU Scout Baseball Day (spring) Cub Scout Family Weekend (semi-annually) Tiger Leader Training (fall) Funding The Pushmataha Area Council is funded by donations made by civic organizations, businesses, and individuals. Several different United Way groups contribute to the council, and most United way funding has remained strong. United way of Oktibbeha County is an exception, as they have cut their funding to the council by over half in recent years. The Pushmataha Area Council is a 501(c) non-profit organization. Service Through the Cub Scouting, Boy Scouting, and Venturing programs, the Pushmataha Area Council serves youth ages 6 through 21. The council offers Learning for Life, a character education program used by local schools. Explorer posts in the council offer vocation-oriented experience to teenage boys and girls in the council's ten county area. Camp Seminole The original council camp was Camp Pine Springs, in Monroe County, located along the Buttahatchie River north of Columbus, Mississippi. Camp Palila, located in Louisville, Mississippi, became the council camp in 1953. Camp Palila served as the council camp for thirty years prior to 1980. The state of Mississippi had leased the land to the council, but the legislature failed to complete the new lease before the original lease ended. The land used for Camp Palila reverted to control of the state, and is now Legion State Park. The current council camp for the Pushmataha Area Council is Camp Seminole, about five miles north of Starkville, Mississippi. Camp Seminole hosts, among other activities, council summer camps, Cub Scout campouts, leadership training sessions, Wood Badge courses, and Order of the Arrow events. Camp Seminole was named for Seminole Manufacturing of Columbus, Mississippi, which donated significant financial support toward the camp's construction. History Camp Seminole was built on of land purchased by the Pushmataha Area Council in 1982. The need for building the camp came about when the lease on the previous council camp (Camp Palila) expired, and the Mississippi legislature did not renew the lease. A Brownsea-22 training course was held on the grounds of the new camp in 1982, before any structures or other improvements had been made. Several council camporees were conducted on the grounds before Camp Seminole was fully operational. In June 1986, Camp Seminole was declared officially \"open\" when the Pushmataha Area Council summer camp was held there for the first time. Facilities Camp Seminole has a dining hall that seats 200 people, a lake, nine camp sites, a C.O.P.E. Lodge, an activity field, a shooting sports arena, an obstacle course, numerous open shelters, an environmental center, the Chakchiuma Nature Trail, a trading post, and the Nita Chito Scout Museum. Roads on the camp are mainly of red clay gravel construction. Activities Camp Seminole is primarily a Boy Scout camp, and is used for camporees, summer camps, Scout leader training, Cub Scout campouts, and other Boy scout related events. The camp is also used to house Habitat for Humanity volunteers, for land navigation training by local National Guard and R.O.T.C. units, for Mississippi Hunter Safety Education Training, for Red Cross CPR and First Aid Training sessions, and other community and civic events. Topography The grounds of Camp Seminole average above sea level. Climate The climate at Camp Seminole is considered temperate. Winter temperatures rarely drop below freezing, and summer temperatures reach their peak in July and August, when it can reach 95-100 degrees Fahrenheit (35-38 degrees Celsius). The rainy season is early December through late March. Rainfall averages 62\" annually. Watonala Lodge The Order of the Arrow is represented by the Watonala Lodge. It supports the Scouting programs of the council through leadership, camping, and service. History On September 1, 1939, five adult Boy Scout leaders from the Pushmataha Area Council attended an Order of the Arrow Area Fellowship in Birmingham, Alabama, and learned about the purpose and mission of the Order. Upon returning to the Pushmataha Area Council, an application for a charter was submitted to the National Order of the Arrow office. The initial charter was issued in the latter part of September, 1939. When the initial charter was issued, it was issued in the name of the local council, as Pushmataha Lodge. In January, 1942, Pushmataha Lodge chose its Native American name, Watonala Lodge. In the Choctaw language, Watonala means \"white egret\", or \"white water bird\". The first lodge event was held in the spring of 1940 at the Natchez Trace Game Preserve, near Houston, Mississippi. Lodge membership began to grow, as new Arrowmen were inducted during each council camporee. Membership slowed considerably during World War II, but resumed its pre-war growth during the few years immediately following World War II. The founding of Watonala Lodge in 1939 is well documented, although there is an oral history that places the origin of the lodge ten years earlier, in 1929. Service Watonala Lodge devotes much of its service time to development and maintenance of their home camp, Camp Seminole, which is located five miles north of Starkville, Mississippi. The lodge also publishes an online \"Where To Go Camping Guide\" at www.Watonala.Org, aimed at helping other Boy Scouts and the general public find good places to camp, canoe, and hike. Memorabilia The dominant theme of most Watonala patches and memorabilia is its totem, the white egret. The totem is usually shown in profile, facing the viewer's left, and headed upward in flight. There are numerous variations of this design, with the totem image varying slightly with each new patch issue. The lodge issues a new lodge flap every two or three years, and sometimes issues specific patches for OA events, such as Conclave, National Order of the Arrow Conference (NOAC ), and service events. Compared to many OA lodges, Watonala Lodge has always been comparatively small in membership numbers. This is due largely to being in a rural council having only ten counties. Because of smaller membership, the quantity of Watonala memorabilia available is usually smaller than most OA lodges.

The group was led by singer Alex Ebert. The band's name is based on a story Ebert wrote in his youth, about a messianic figure named Edward Sharpe. Drawing from roots rock, folk, gospel, and psychedelic music, the band's image and sound evoke the hippie movement of the 1960s and 1970s. The group's first show was played July 18, 2007, at The Troubadour in West Hollywood, California. Their first studio album, Up from Below, was released on July 7, 2009, on Community Records and featured the popular single \"Home\". The group released their second full-length album, Here, on May 29, 2012, and third album, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, on July 23, 2013. Their fourth studio album, PersonA, was released in April 2016. Since its founding, the band underwent several alterations. Most notably, singer Jade Castrinos left the band in 2014. The band's current members are Nicolo Aglietti, Mark Noseworthy, Orpheo McCord, Josh Collazo, Christian Letts, Seth Ford-Young, Mitchell Yoshida, Crash Richard, Stewart Cole, and Alex Ebert. The band also operated Big Sun, a non-profit focused on funding and developing co-ops and land trusts in urban areas around the world. Big Sun donated $100,000 to, \"Avalon Village,\" in Highland Park, Michigan in 2016. History Origin and first studio album (Up from Below) After years of the Los Angeles party life and subsequent drug addiction, Ima Robot frontman Alex Ebert broke up with his girlfriend, moved out of his house, and spent time in rehabilitation. During this time, Ebert began to write a book about a messianic figure named Edward Sharpe who was \"sent down to Earth to kinda heal and save mankind, but he kept getting distracted by girls and falling in love.\" Ebert adopted the Sharpe persona as his alter ego. He said, \"I don't want to put too much weight on it, because in some ways it's just a name that I came up with. But I guess if I look deeper, I do feel like I had lost my identity in general. I really didn't know what was going on or who I was anymore. Adopting another name helped me open up an avenue to get back.\" Ebert began initial writing and recording completely alone, doing \"the horn lines with [his] mouth or a kazoo on the demos\" and \"all the background vocals layering ... pretending that there were people there.\" After meeting singer Jade Castrinos outside a Los Angeles cafe, Ebert and Castrinos started writing music together, and became a part of the art and music collective The Masses, which was partially started by some seed money from actor Heath Ledger. Their fledgling group eventually swelled to more than ten members, some of whom had been Alex's friends since he was young. In mid-2009, Ebert, Castrinos, and a group of musicians toured the country by bus as Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros. The first show they played in 2009 was at the Marfa Film Festival in Marfa, Texas. The band recorded their debut album, Up from Below, in Laurel Canyon. Produced by Nicolo Aglietti and Aaron Older, it was released on July 14, 2009. Up from Below is also the name of one of the songs in this album, in which Alex states \"I was only five/when my dad told me I'd die/I cried as he said son/ was nothing could be done\". Says Alexander, \"My dad would be doing therapy in his office upstairs and I'd hear screamings, because they'd be role-playing and he'd be acting as his patient's father and they'd get upset and hit him and all this stuff. When he wasn't working, I'd go up there to draw and one day the music he was playing, Beethoven I think, delivered to me the idea of life and death. The information was bequeathed to me by the music. It was sonic and emotional. I tapped my dad on the shoulder and asked him if I was going to die and he said, 'Yeah.'\" On April 12, 2009, the band released \"Desert Song\", a music video and the first of a 12-part feature-length musical called SALVO!. Part 2, \"Kisses Over Babylon\", was released November 24, 2009 through Spinner.com. Part 3, \"40 Day Dream\", was uploaded to YouTube by the band on May 19, 2011. Big Easy Express and second studio album (Here) In April 2011, the band joined Mumford & Sons and Old Crow Medicine Show on the Railroad Revival Tour. According to American Songwriter, the tour stopped in six cities, playing alternative venues such as an Austin, Texas high school where Mumford & Sons taught the marching band how to play their hit \"The Cave\". The tour was also the subject of Grammy-nominated director Emmett Malloy's latest documentary Big Easy Express, which strove to capture \"the pure joy of music\" through Americana folk imagery. The documentary went on to win in the category for Best Long Form Music Video at the 2013 Grammy Awards. In 2011, Railroad Revival Tour bands Mumford & Sons, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, and Old Crow Medicine Show together closed their shows at every stop with \"This Train\". The group's second album, Here, was released on May 29, 2012. Third studio album (Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros) The band's self-titled third studio album, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, was released in 2013. This was followed by tours of North America, UK, Europe, and Australia which included headlining concert dates as well as major festivals. The band became known for taking people onstage with them, including a former patient they had previously met in a hospital performance, and a disabled man in a wheelchair. Fourth studio album (PersonA) The band's fourth studio album, PersonA, was released April 15, 2016 through Community Music. Recording the music almost entirely in one room together in New Orleans, their approach was a far cry from their ramshackle, come-one-come-all production audible on recordings of their previous albums. In an in-depth interview with Transverso Media, Ebert explained his desire to evolve on PersonA, stating, \"In a lot of ways this album does things that are missing.\" He went on to discuss why the name Edward Sharpe is crossed out on the cover, saying, \"There was no character to begin with, so why not kill him? He never really was there. If anything, and at most, Edward Sharpe was a vehicle for me to get to slough off whatever I had become up until that point, and to get back to or sort of allow my pure self to come forth into sort of a clean slate.\" Members Alex Ebert – vocals, guitar, percussion, piano Nicolo Aglietti – guitar and co-producer; synthesizer, keyboards, vocals Stewart Cole – trumpet, percussion, keyboards, tenor ukulele, vocals Josh Collazo – drums, percussion, saxophone, vocals Orpheo McCord – drums, percussion, marimba, didgeridoo, vocals Christian Letts – guitar, vocals, mandolin Seth Ford-Young – bass, vocals Mark Noseworthy – guitar, vocals, banjo, mandolin, charango, ronroco Crash Richard – vocals, percussion As of marketing on the band's Facebook page in 2013: Mitchell Yoshida – piano, clavinet, vocals Additional, touring and/or recording personnel As listed in the iTunes LP for the most recent album, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros, 2013, or present tour: Aaron Arntz – piano; previously also clavinet, vocals as a main band member Aaron Embry – piano, organs; previously keyboards, piano, vocals, harmonica as a main band member Roger Joseph Manning Jr – piano Nathaniel Markman – fiddler Fred Bows – violin Susie Bows – violin Hippos August – humming, moaning, Surbahar Former personnel In addition to Arntz and Embry: Aaron Older – co-producer, bass, vocals, banjo, percussion Tay Strathairn – piano, harmonica, vocals Jade Castrinos – vocals, guitar, percussion, keyboard Nora Kirkpatrick – accordion, keyboard, vocals Past touring/ additional personnel Odessa Jorgensen – fiddle, vocals during 2012-2013 tour Anna Bulbrook – viola, vocals Tyler James – piano, vocals Felix Bloxsom – drums Adam Privitera – penny whistler Ryan Richter – guitar, lap steel Discography Studio albums EPs Here Comes EP (2009) Singles Notes Other charted songs References External links 2005 establishments in California American country rock groups American indie folk groups Dew Process artists Folk rock groups from California Grammy Award winners Musical groups established in 2005 Musical groups from Los Angeles Rough Trade Records artists Vagrant Records artists\n\n15824641\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colomby\n\nColomby\n\nColomby () is a commune in the Manche department in Normandy in north-western France.

The law was based upon the perceived cruelty to animals exhibited at western rodeos brought by promotions such as Tex Austin's 1924 \"King of the Rodeo\" exhibition at Wembley Stadium in 1924, the first such program in England. The act was repealed and replaced by the Animal Welfare Act 2006 and the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 respectively. Analysis The first section provided that roping any unbroken horse or untrained bull was illegal. This was followed by prohibitions on \"wrestling, fighting, or struggling with any untrained bull\", and on stimulating a horse or bull to buck. This last provision would exclude cinch straps specifically designed to irritate the animal or a strap cinched around its genitals. The prohibitions applied not only to the riders and the stock contractors preparing the animals, but to any promoter of the contests or exhibitions. The penalties were fines of up to 100 pounds, or up to three months in gaol, per violation. Geographic scope The last section of the act provided that it was not effective for Northern Ireland.

History Turku was the capital city of Finland during Finland's epoch as a part of Sweden, and Swedish theatre companies visited Finland during the 18th-century, the first of whom was the Stenborg Troupe in 1761 and the company of Carl Seuerling in the 1780s. There where however, no proper theatre building until the Bonuviers Teater was erected in the 1810s. When the old theatre was destroyed during the Great Fire of Turku in 1827, there was a need of a new theater house. 1839-1894 The theatre has been located in its present building since 1839, when it was opened by a local amateur society with the play Gubben i Bergsbygden the 21 January 1839. Later that same year, the theatre house was used by its first professional theatre company, that of Ulrik Torsslow, and its first professional concert singer, Betty Boije. In 1843, concerts by Johanna von Schoultz and Jenny Lind where both performed on its stage. Prior to 1894, the theatre did not have a permanent staff, as Finland did not have any native actors at this point, and during the 19th-century the theatre house was used by travelling theatre companies from Sweden. The most notable of these were the company of Pierre Deland, which visited the theatre regularly from 1840 to 1861, as well as the so called \"Finnish Company\" of Edvard Stjernström, which enjoyed theatre monopoly in Southern Finland in 1850-53. In the 1870s and 1880s, the famed Swedish company of Thérèse Elfforss frequnelty visited the theatre. The first native theatre company performed in the theatre was the company of August Westermark in 1872, though it was not to be until 1894, that the first performance was given by a permanent native ensemble at the theatre. Activity The theatre building is owned by Stiftelsen för Åbo Akademi and it is run by Åbo Svenska Teaterförening. The theatre has three formal stages; Stora Scenen, with 365 seats, Studioscenen with 136 seats, and Tiljan-scenen, with a maximum of one hundred seats, as well as local activity.

Rail service is available from Granville to Paris on a regular basis provided by SNCF, the French National Railway. The town is also the origin of the English language surname Dunville/Dumville (originally Donville), which is found throughout the UK and former British colonies. People descended from this Norman line can be found in concentrations around Toronto, Thunder Bay, Chicago, Detroit, St. Louis, and South Carolina.

Zweibrücken) is a type of German warmblood horse bred in Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland. Traditionally, the breeding of Zweibrücken was centered on the onetime Principal Stud of Zweibrücken but since 1977 has been under the jurisdiction of the Horse Breeders' Association of Rhineland-Palatinate-Saar (PRPS). The modern Zweibrücker is an elegant, large-framed, correct sport horse with powerful, elastic gaits suitable for dressage, show jumping, eventing and combined driving. State Stud of Zweibrücken The Rhineland-Palatinate state-owned stud facilities of Zweibrücken house the smallest number of state stallions in Germany, but the region's horse-breeding history is rich. The modern city of Zweibrücken, meaning \"two bridges\", was a county throughout the Middle Ages and then later on became a duchy of the Holy Roman Empire. The state stud was founded in 1755 by Duke Christian IV following a visit to England. While abroad he admired the refined, spirited English Thoroughbreds, as a breed less than 100 years old at the time. When Christian IV returned to Zweibrücken, he financed the establishment of \"royal facilities\" throughout the region, populating them with noble stallions and mares. Christian IV's successor, Charles II August, continued to improve horse-breeding in politically influential Zweibrücken by decreeing that the horses bred there ought to be \"good, handsome and useful\". This goal was achieved to the effect of gaining the admiration of the King of Prussia, who purchased over 150 Zweibrücken stallions. These sires were sent to the Principal Stud of Trakehnen where the Trakehner was bred for use by the Prussian nobles. In 1801, Zweibrücken was annexed by France, and the noble horses were moved to Rosiers aux Salines. However, Napoleon saw the stallion and mare herds at Zweibrücken Principal Stud re-established in 1806. The central facility and its many outposts and stallion depots were populated with more than 250 stallions and a herd of over 100 mares purchased from notable German breeding outfits, as well as fashionable Spanish horses and products of the formidable Austro-Hungarian empire. Less than a decade later, Zweibrücken was given to Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, and Zweibrücken was retitled in 1890 as the Principal Royal Bavarian State Stud. During this period, large numbers of Anglo-Normans - Thoroughbred-influenced agricultural horses from France - and Arabians were stationed in Zweibrücken. The first organized breeding of Anglo-Arabian horses occurred at Zweibrücken during this time period. The region became widely known for its refined cavalry horses which combined the size and speed of the Thoroughbred with the more tractable temperament of the Arabian. By 1900, the Principal Stud of Zweibrücken comprised more than 250 head of breeding stock and young horses, 74 of which were state-owned stallions. The first half of the 20th century was marked by increasing demands for a heavier all-purpose farm horse, which were used extensively in the first World War for pulling artillery wagons. Consequently, the refined riding horses were replaced by heavy warmbloods from Oldenburg. During World War II, the entire city was evacuated and the horses brought to Bavaria. Much of the city was destroyed, and the state stud facilities came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed German federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Nearly a quarter of the 58 stallions standing at Zweibrücken were draft horses. Zweibrücken lost the status of Principal Stud - which keeps a herd of mares in addition to standing stallions - in 1960. As the demand for an athletic riding horse blossomed, the draft horse stallions were replaced by Trakehners. From 1966 to 1976, Trakehner stallions comprised half the stallion roster. Unlike most of the State Studs of Germany, the period for which Zweibrücken stood heavy warmblood stallions was brief; the chief focus of this region has been steadily focused on an elegant riding horse since its construction. Gradually, sires from Hanoverian and Holsteiner bloodlines joined the noble Trakehners, accelerating the local horse-breeding efforts towards the production of a warmblood riding horse. Today many of the stallion depots and outposts lie in France, while others were purchased by separate entities. Most notable among these was the facility at Birkhausen, which was bought by the Trakehner verband and from which Abiza, dam of the Canadian-born Trakehner Abdullah, was sold. The grounds of the state stud host stallion parades and the month-long stallion performance test for the regional breeding association. Breeding Organized breeding through much of the history of Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland was managed by the State Stud. The Horse Breeders' Association of Rhineland-Palatinate-Saar (PRPS) was formed in 1977 and directs the breeding of almost all horse breeds within the region. The breed with the largest population within the studbooks is the German Riding or Sport Horse, called the Zweibrücker. The PRPS cooperates with similar associations in Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Saxony and Thuringia, collectively licensing and approving breeding stock. Like other German Warmbloods, the breeding of Zweibrücken is characterized by stringent inspection criteria. Foals do not receive their papers until they are presented at a local foal show, at which judges may exclude any foal if it is markedly off-type. Along with their papers, the foals receive a brand on the left hind leg, just behind the stifle. Foal inspections also give an early indication of the quality of the sire, as well as which mares match best with him. At the age of 3, fillies may be upgraded from the foal register to the herd book through a process called Stutbuchaufnahmen or \"Marebook Recording\". There are several levels of mare book based on the quality of the mare and the completeness of her pedigree, which allows mares of unorthodox breeding to eventually become part of the breeding program. To be written into the herd book and thereby have registered foals, the mare is evaluated on her conformation and gaits. Mares which fail to meet the criteria may be placed in a lower mare book, or be denied altogether. Only mares in the highest mare books can produce breeding stallion sons. While mares can be entered into the studbook at local shows, the process of having a young stallion approved for breeding is lengthy. Stallion candidates are often identified as foals, and at the age of 2 and a half the best colts attend the licensing in Munich, Bavaria. There they are evaluated along with stallion hopefuls - köraspirants - branded Bavarian Warmblood, Württemberger and Saxony-Thuringian, along with some representatives from other regions. As all of these regions have a common goal in warmblood breeding, they are judged to the same standard. They are evaluated in terms of their conformational correctness, type, gaits and ability free-jumping. The best young stallions receive a temporary license which is accepted by all of the south-German breeding associations. The stallion has a period of a few years during which he must prove himself in performance, and in this way he earns full approval. This process is common to all German Warmbloods, and is quite similar to the studbook selection process used for other Warmbloods, as well. Characteristics The best way to identify a Zweibrücker is by the brand on the left hind leg. It features the two bridges of the city of Zweibrücken topped by a representation of the duke's crown. Otherwise, it is not possible to distinguish a Zweibrücker from a German Warmblood bred elsewhere based solely on appearance. All German Warmblood registries exchange genetic material in an effort to continuously improve their own horses. Most Zweibrücken are middle-weight horses with \"old style\" examples heavier set than those deemed \"modern\" in type. The ideal height is 160 to 170 cm or 15.3 to 16.3hh at the age of 3, but deviations in either direction are not uncommon nor are they disqualifying. The most common colors are bay, chestnut, gray, and black, however several breeders of colored warmbloods have chosen to register their horses as Zweibrücken, so there are tobiano pintos and colors such as palomino, buckskin, and cremello. The Anglo-Arabian ancestry of the Zweibrücker is found primarily in what remains of its old female families. Today, the Horse Breeders' Association of Rhineland-Palatinate-Saar is known for its liberal pedigree policies, accepting breeding stock from most other warmblood studbooks which are members of the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses. The breeding objective, based on market demands, is currently a horse suitable for dressage, jumping, and eventing, though combined driving is also mentioned. In North America, the breeding objective includes suitability for show hunter competition, as well. Zweibrücken share the standard of German Riding or Sport Horse with their parallels in other regions. Ideally, the horse is characterized by a noble expression, with long-lined and correct conformation. The head is dry, expressive, and aesthetically appealing though need not have out of the ordinary refinement. The topline is long, generous, and slightly curved featuring a medium-length neck set on rather high, a stark, laid-back wither and long sloping shoulder. The loin is well-muscled, the croup is long, slightly tilted, and muscular. The horse stands on a foundation of dry, large joints and correct limbs ending in correct, hard hooves of sufficient size. In motion the gaits are correct - no deviations when viewed from the front or rear - and expansive with a pure rhythm and suggestive of great work ethic. The qualities of freedom, elasticity, and power are paramount. The walk swings through the neck and back, while the trot is cadenced and powerful. Suspension and elasticity are effects of the ability of the horse's joints to store energy and absorb shock, thus are influential in soundness. The canter is important as an indicator of jumping suitability, and should be cadenced, balanced and powerful. Zweibrücken, especially stallions, are typically evaluated over fences through free jumping, where the horse is let loose in a chute with specifically measured obstacles. This allows judges to draw conclusions about the horse's jumping abilities without pushing them too fast under saddle. Judges look for a horse which is capable of jumping, having an appearance of ease and confidence as he jumps, without any carelessness. The rhythm of the canter should remain unchanged while the horse adjusts his stride length to leave the ground from the correct place. The fore and hind limbs should be drawn up close to the body, which should pass close to the obstacle, while the spine forms a convex arc over the jump called \"bascule\". As part of the approval process, stallions and often mares are evaluated in controlled conditions on their personality traits or \"interior qualities\". This information allows breeders to choose mates properly. The horses with the best marks for interior qualities have kind, personable temperaments, are uncomplicated to ride, strong-nerved and reliable but alert and intelligent. Another quality, called \"rideability\", is a measure of how comfortable and simple the horse is to ride. High rideability is coveted by amateur riders in particular.

The first two seasons, comprising 52 episodes and half of the series' whole, were filmed in black and white. In 1954, series producer Whitney Ellsworth insisted on filming in color, as some home viewers were beginning to purchase color television sets. However, these episodes were still transmitted in black and white. Also beginning with season three, the series began to take on the lighthearted, whimsical tone of the Superman comic books of the 1950s. The villains were often caricatured, Runyonesque gangsters played with tongue in cheek. Violence on the show was toned down further. The only gunfire that occurred was aimed at Superman, and of course the bullets bounced off. Superman was less likely to engage in fisticuffs with the villains. On occasions when Superman did use physical force, he would take crooks out in a single karate-style chop or, if he happened to have two criminals in hand, banging their heads together. More often than not, the villains were likely to knock themselves out fleeing Superman. By then very popular to viewers, Jimmy Olsen was now being played as the show's comic foil to Superman. Many of the plots featured him and Lois Lane being captured, only to be rescued at the last minute by Superman. Scripts for the last season did not always hit the campy lows of the previous two years and reestablished a bit of the seriousness of the show, often with science fiction elements such as a Kryptonite-powered robot (a left-over prop from \"The Bowery Boys Meet the Monsters\"), atomic explosions, and impregnable metal cubes. In one of the last episodes, \"The Perils of Superman\" (a takeoff on The Perils of Pauline), there was indeed deadly peril straight out of the movie serials: Lois gagged and tied to a set of railroad tracks with a speeding train bearing down on her, Perry White nearly sawed in half while tied to a log, Jimmy in a runaway car headed for a cliff, and Clark Kent immersed in a vat of acid. This was one of three episodes directed by George Reeves himself in an attempt to inject some new life into the series. Noel Neill's hair was dyed a bright red for this season, though the color change was not apparent in the initial black-and-white broadcasts. Although Reeves's efforts did not save the series from cancellation, \"The Perils of Superman\" is regarded by some as one of the best episodes. The numbering scheme in the following list is derived from the purely consecutive numbering used in Superman: Serial to Cereal.

History On April 25, a British force under the command of the Royal Governor of the Province of New York, Major General William Tryon, landed between Fairfield and Norwalk in what is present-day Westport, and marched from there to Danbury. There, they destroyed Continental Army supplies after chasing off a small garrison of troops. Connecticut militia leaders Major General David Wooster, Brigadier General Gold S. Silliman, and Brigadier General Benedict Arnold raised a combined force of roughly 700 Continental Army regular and irregular local militia forces to oppose the British, but could not reach Danbury in time to prevent the destruction of the supplies. Instead, they set out to harass the British on their return to the coast. On April 27, the company led by Wooster twice attacked Tryon's rear guard during their march south. In the second encounter, Wooster was mortally wounded and died five days later. The main encounter then took place at Ridgefield, where several hundred militia under Arnold's command confronted the British and were driven away in a running battle down the town's main street, but not before inflicting casualties on the British. The expedition was a tactical success for the British forces, but their actions in pursuing the raid galvanized Patriot support in Connecticut. While the British again made raids on Connecticut's coastal communities, they made no more raids that penetrated far into the countryside. Background The state of Connecticut was not a scene of conflict during the first two years of the American Revolutionary War, even though the war had begun in neighboring Massachusetts in April 1775, and New York City had been taken by the British in the New York and New Jersey campaign in the fall of 1776. Major General William Howe commanded the British forces in New York, and he drafted a plan for 1777 in which the primary goal was to take the American capital at Philadelphia. Troops left to defend New York were to include a brigade of 3,000 provincial troops under the command of New York's former royal governor William Tryon, who was given a temporary promotion to \"major general of the provincials\" in spring 1777. Howe's plan included authorizing Tryon to operate on the Hudson River or to \"enter Connecticut as circumstances may point out.\" Tryon was given one of the early operations of the season, a raid against a Continental Army depot at Danbury, Connecticut. Howe had learned of the depot's existence through a spy working for British Indian agent Guy Johnson, and he had also met with some success in an earlier raid against the Continental Army outpost at Peekskill, New York. A fleet was assembled consisting of 12 transports, a hospital ship, and some small craft, all under the command of Captain Henry Duncan. The landing force consisted of 1,500 regulars drawn from the 4th, 15th, 23rd, 27th, 44th, and 64th regiments, 300 Loyalists from the Prince of Wales American Regiment led by Montfort Browne, and a small contingent of the 17th Light Dragoons, all led by Generals Sir William Erskine and James Agnew. Command of the entire operation was given to General Tryon, and the fleet sailed from New York on April 22, 1777. The Danbury depot had been established in 1776 by order of the Second Continental Congress, and it primarily served forces located in the Hudson River valley. In April 1777, the army began mustering regiments for that year's campaigns, and there were about 50 Continental Army soldiers and 100 local militia at Danbury under the command of Joseph Platt Cooke, a local resident and a colonel in the state militia. Danbury The British fleet was first spotted when it passed Norwalk. When the troops landed messengers were dispatched to warn Danbury and local militia leaders of the movements. Generals Wooster and Arnold were in New Haven when messengers reached them on April 26. Wooster immediately sent the local militia to Fairfield. When he and Arnold reached Fairfield, they learned that General Silliman had already departed for Redding, with orders that any militia raised should follow as rapidly as possible; they immediately moved in that direction. The forces assembled at Redding moved toward Danbury in a pouring rain, but had only reached Bethel, about short of Danbury by 11 pm, where they decided to spend the night rather than press on to Danbury with wet gunpowder. The forces consisted of about 500 regular militia members and about 200 volunteers.

It was published in 1980 by Feltrinelli and features a collection of six stories which are loosely related to one another: Postoristoro, Mimi e istrioni, Viaggio, Senso contrario, Altri libertini, and Autobahn. The stories present the lives and exploits of young men and women caught up in the 1980s, and Tondelli, through his writings, depicts their dreams, pains, emotional outbursts, ingenuity and, at times, their irreparable mistakes. The book received considerable attention upon publication and was censored by the authorities for obscenities only twenty days after its appearance in bookstores in Italy as it was being prepared for its third edition. While the book is a series of short stories, the author preferred to describe the work as a romanzo a episodi (serial novel), in order to emphasise the thread that connected all of the stories to each other.

Some segments are still in planning, but when finished it will be about in length. Two tunnels, about 0.6 mi (1 km) long each, in the towns of Yabucoa and Maunabo were completed in . It will connect the cities of Fajardo, Ceiba, Naguabo, Humacao, Yabucoa, Maunabo, Patillas, Arroyo, Guayama and Salinas, thus bordering the entire eastern and southeastern coasts of Puerto Rico. Its northern terminus is at PR-3 and PR-194 in Fajardo, and its south terminus is at PR-52 in Salinas. Route description The highway consists of five toll plazas; these are at Ceiba Norte, Humacao Norte, Humacao Sur (near Palmas del Mar), Guayama and Salinas. All toll plazas have AutoExpreso lanes. Three phases of the tollway have been completed: the first one was from Salinas to Guayama, which is about long (milepost 83 to 95 km), the second from Fajardo to Yabucoa at (This includes an incomplete bridge in Yabucoa that does not fall into the high-speed highway classification in the interstate system as it is only one lane per direction and will require the addition of an additional bridge or constructing a bridge over the existing bridge, as it lies in a main corn and plantain field.) Recently , between Yabucoa and Maunabo, includes the last tunnel, Vicente Morales, was opened in October 2008. The total constructed highway at this time is , leaving nearly to be constructed in Yabucoa (including the other additional tunnel) and from Maunabo to Guayama which is the longest to-be-built segment. The lanes in the Yabucoa segments were divided by painted yellow lines and no-passing zone boards, but a concrete median barrier had to be installed because some cars still passed others going slower, resulting in deadly head-on collisions; illegal night races also had deadly consequences. PR-53 is the tollway with the lowest traffic in Puerto Rico, and very few congestion jams have been reported. PR-53 does not enter highly populated towns (none of them are over 100,000; the largest are Fajardo, Humacao and Guayama) and is not close to increase its traffic due to the fact that most of the population in the east part of Puerto Rico live in the San Juan metro area, Caguas and Cayey, cities where PR-53 makes no appearance; and the main traffic in Humacao is mostly located on the PR-30 and PR-60 highways. The center/business area of Humacao is accessed via PR-30 and PR-60, not by PR-53. Because of this, PR-53 has no more than two lanes per direction in the constructed segments and will probably have no more than two lanes per direction in the entire length. PR-53 is also prone to flooding in the areas near Naguabo and Fajardo: during heavy rains, it is sometimes closed to traffic. There are current proposals to convert PR-3 from Rio Grande to Fajardo into a freeway to provide a controlled-access route between PR-53's northern terminus and the second phase of PR-66. At the rate of construction, the entire PR-53 corridor might be completed within the next ten years. The first segment of PR-53 was opened in 1994; from Fajardo to Ceiba, in 1994, and from Ceiba to Humacao, in 1997, except between exit 13 and 17 in summer 2002.

Its name is officially spelled Pouce Coupé River, but it is commonly written without the acute accent. Originating in Alberta's Saddle Hills County, it flows into British Columbia's Peace River Regional District, then returns in Alberta in Saddle Hill County, where it empties into the Peace River. The region of Pouce Coupe Prairie, from which the river and village of Pouce Coupe take their names, was called that for a Beaver Indian Chief named 'Pouscapee'. The first European settler in the region was Hector Tremblay, who built a cabin there in 1898. Tremblay, of French origin, translated 'Pouskapee's Prairie' into the nearest French words of similar sound (, meaning \"cut thumb\" or \"cut-off thumb\"). Course The Pouce Coupe originates in a small lake in northern Alberta, at an elevation of , in the Pouce Coupe Prairie of the southern Peace River Country, west of Spirit River and Woking, between Saddle Hills and Blueberry Hill. It flows west and receives the waters of Boone Creek before reaching the British Columbia–Alberta border. The river then turns northwest to the village of Pouce Coupe. The Pouce Coupe Regional Park is established on the banks of the river east of the village and Highway2, at the confluence with Bissette Creek. It receives the waters of Dawson Creek east of the city of Dawson Creek, then turns northeast, entering once again the province of Alberta, north of Highway 49. The course runs through a canyon that reaches depths of in this section. Ammonite fossils harvested from the geological formations opened in the canyon can be found in the Dawson Creek Northern Alberta Railways Park museum. The river continues north and empties into the Peace River, south of Highway 64, at an elevation of .

The Irish Abroad Unit is a dedicated Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs and coordinates the provision of services to Irish emigrants across the globe and administers financial support to organizations in the voluntary sector engaged in the delivery of services to Irish emigrants. Grants are extended to groups in the voluntary sector who provide advice and support to Irish people abroad, particularly those that help migrants access their rights and entitlements in their host countries. Priority is given to organizations that support the most vulnerable and marginalized, such as the older Irish community in Great Britain and undocumented Irish in the United States. Smaller grants have also been allocated to Irish groups in Australia, Canada, Argentina, South Africa, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Singapore, France and Mexico as well as to a number of organizations in Ireland who provide pre-departure information and also advice to those emigrants who may be considering returning to Ireland. In 2007, the Irish Abroad Unit awarded grants of €14.165 million to organizations in eleven different countries. Following increases in funding, the program has expanded to include a number of capital projects, as well as culture and heritage projects that support community networks and build on the interest of citizens abroad in their Irish heritage. In general, recipients of Emigrant Services funding are Irish community organizations who have a functioning board of management, show clear objectives and have an accounting framework in place. The payment of grants to individual Irish citizens’ resident abroad is beyond the remit of the Irish Abroad Unit.

Biography Born in Chicago, Yancey enlisted in the United States Navy in 1911 and was made a lieutenant during World War I. He left the Navy in 1921 and became a ship's officer for the Isthmian Steamship Company. With continued study, he achieved master mariner status and the title of Captain. Yancey joined the United States Coast Guard in April 1925 and became interested in aviation and the science of navigation then. His knowledge of air navigation put him in demand with pilots in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1927, he made his first transcontinental flight as co-pilot. History-making flights In 1929, Yancey and Roger Q. Williams made their historic flight from Old Orchard Beach, Maine to Rome. En route, their Bellanca monoplane \"The Pathfinder\", hit fog and was forced to fly blind for most of their first day. However, due to Yancey's navigational calculations, once able to see their way, the team found themselves still exactly on course. Their one emergency stop, in Santander, Spain, occurred thirty-one hours and thirty minutes into the flight. Upon arriving in Rome, Yancey and Williams were met with crowds \"almost as fervent\" as those greeting Lindbergh in Paris. In 1930, Yancey, William H. Alexander, and Zeh Bouck made the first-ever flight from New York to Bermuda in a Stinson monoplane equipped with pontoons. Forced down, the plane spent the night at sea but was able to take off again under its own power the next morning; the first plane ever to do so. The crew made the flight in about eight and a half hours of flying time. In 1938, Yancey flew with Richard Archbold to New Guinea for the American Museum of Natural History. Death, tributes, and legacy Yancey died unexpectedly of a cerebral hemorrhage at his home in Yonkers, New York. He was 44. In his lifetime, Yancey received decorations from Albert I of Belgium, Pope Pius XI, Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and Benito Mussolini. From the U.S. Navy, Yancey received a medal for his work on meteorology during World War I. Yancey was the author of several books on aviation including Aerial Navigation and Meteorology (1929). He frequently contributed stories about his flights to The New York Times, once sending a story via radio from 3,500 feet in the air. Yancey advocated making radio communication a regular function of flying. He advised that a radio operator be part of a flight crew so the pilot would not have to divide his attention while flying. Considered a celebrity for his accomplishments, in New York City Yancey's likeness was captured in caricature for Sardi's, the theater district restaurant. The picture is now part of the collection of the New York Public Library. Yancey is buried in Arlington National Cemetery.

Trappers traditionally move habitually along the route to set and check the traps, in so doing become skilled at traversing remote terrain, and become experts in the geography of the local area. Because of this traditional knowledge, traplines are not only of interest to trappers themselves but to researchers and others (governments, corporations) interested in local history, biology, and topography. The assignment of particular trapline territories to individuals in band societies was traditionally handled by group consensus, and occasionally violence and warfare. In the present-day trapline assignment is typically formalized and controlled by the state. Formalized trapline territory boundaries now form the basis for many major land-use projects in fur-rich regions. One of the entitlements that goes along with possessing a trap territory is the right to erect a trapper's cabin: a simple shelter in which a trapper can stay while moving around his territory. Trappers' cabins are a cultural icon of fur regions, and an important part of the national mythos of countries and regions such as Canada and Alaska, and among groups such as the Métis. Pre-treaty indigenous governance of trapping and other harvesting Before European colonisation, determining where a particular family or band could hunt, fish, and gather without encroaching on others to the point of over-harvesting was the main preoccupation of indigenous governance in the subarctic and other non-farming regions. Councils were convened to reconcile disputes and warfare was always a possibility. When European traders began exporting bulk amounts of fur to Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the trapping territories of the subarctic became much more commercially valuable and disputes intensified. Registered traplines In Canada formal trapping territories assigned by the state are typically called \"registered traplines\" (RTLs), though each province administers its own system; they have been common across Canada since the 1930s. Alberta's registered traplines were once exactly that: lines which followed a creek or other feature, but in the 1960s they were switched to a system of trapping territories. In British Columbia \"the registered trapline system continues to be the primary system for setting harvest guidelines and managing furbearing animals\". It is an offence to trap an animal on a registered trapline that does not belong to you in BC. Manitoba has had registered traplines since 1940; they were brought in at that time to stop a wave of new arrivals in Northern Manitoba from trapping out an area that was already overharvested by the local, mostly First Nations, population. The system is administered under the province's Wildlife Act. Lines cannot be sold, inherited, or handed down, but are awarded through a points system, where preference is given to people with a close family relationship to the previous lineholder, a history of using that trapline with the permission of the previous lienholder, and residency near the territory. Ontario has more than 2,800 registered traplines on Crown land. Since the 2001 Paix des braves agreement, trapline territories have been used as the basis for forestry and mining planning in the Eeyou Istchee territory, in Quebec. Indigenous land claims Indigenous peoples have not always welcomed the regulation of the fur industry by provincial authorities, and the assignment of trapping territories by the provincial Crown implies that the land is ultimately the property of the province, to be disposed of at its will, rather than subject to comanagement under the terms of the treaties. Furthermore, having to apply to provincial authorities to distribute traplines removes control of the process from local Indigenous forms of governance, and institutionalizes a non-Indigenous presence on traditional lands. Nevertheless, as registered traplines provide Aboriginal peoples with legal rights to a piece of land off-reserve, a potential economic livelihood, and a connection to a traditional lifestyle, registered traplines are considered of the utmost importance for many First Nations and Metis communities.

The band made its breakthrough in the metal scene with its 2002 album Cold Black Piece of Flesh. The second album Escaping the Stupor was released on Black Lotus Records. Their music combines melodic passages with old school death metal, and their lyrics deal with personal experiences and opinions from Christian point of view. Biography Sacrificium has its roots in a band called Hardway, formed by Sebastian Wagner and Oliver Tesch. Musically, the band was pop rock oriented. That changed in 1991, when the session drummer Markus Hauth took the direction more towards a hard rock sound. In 1992, Hardway performed at the reputive Steiger 14 club in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. The band name was changed to Corpus Christi (not to be confused with Corpus Christi from Ohio) in 1993 and they began playing thrash metal. The style developed to death metal, and in 1994, after recording a demo, the name was changed to Sacrificium. After a few line up changes in 1996, Sacrificium recorded its second demo and in 1998 another demo titled Mortal Fear was released. Although the demos were well-received, the vocalist Roman Wagner left Sacrificium in 2000. After that, the band played concerts with bands such as Extol, Dismember, Unleashed, The Black Dahlia Murder or My Darkest Hate. The second guitarist, Claudio Enzler, started performing vocals, and the guitarist position was taken by Ulrike Uhlmann. In 2002 Sacrificium was signed to Whirlwind Records, who published the band's debut Cold Black Piece of Flesh. The album caught the attention of the press, and received positive reviews. For example, Rock Hard gave it 7.5/10 in its February 2004 issue. Afterwards they toured Europe with the band Brain[Faq]. On November 28, 2005, Sacrificium released its second album Escaping the Stupor on the Greek metal label Black Lotus Records. The album features guest performances by Karl Walfridsson of Pantokrator and Simon Rosén of Crimson Moonlight. Escaping the Stupor was well-received: Rock Hard gave it 7.5/10, Legacy 10/15 and Metalnews.de 6/7. The band is currently working on new material and is updating its Facebook bulletin with pre-production demo takes and news. Founding guitarist Oliver Tesch left the band in 2012, and was replaced by Wolfgang Nillies. Guitarist Matthias Brandt and bass player Thorsten Brandt left the band on October 30, 2015 and have been replaced later on by Fred Berger and former member Ulrike Uhlmann. On January 6, 2019, it was announced that longtime drummer Mario Henning was departing from the band. They therefore had to cancel their Mexico tour which would have been in April 2019. At the same time the band announced to release an EP The Avowal of the Centurion in early 2019 and a full-length record in 2020. On March 16, 2019, it was announced that former bassist Thorsten Brandt would take over Henning's position on drums. On March 18, the band revealed that The Avowals of the Centurion would be released via Nordic Mission on April 19, 2019.

Elderly caregiving may consist of formal care and informal care. Formal care involves the services of community and medical partners, while informal care involves the support of family, friends, and local communities. In most mild-to-medium cases of dementia, the caregiver is a spouse or an adult child. Over a period of time, more professional care in the form of nursing and other supportive care may be required medically, whether at home or in a long-term care facility. There is evidence to show that case management can improve care for individuals with dementia and the experience of their caregivers. Furthermore, case management may reduce overall costs and institutional care in the medium term. Millions of people living in the United States take care of a friend or family member with Alzheimer’s disease or a related dementia. Family caregivers The role of family caregivers is becoming increasingly important; care in the familiar surroundings of home may delay the onset of some symptoms and postpone or eliminate the need for more professional and costly levels of care. However, home-based care may entail tremendous economic and emotional costs. Family caregivers often give up time from work and forego pay in order to spend an average of 47 hours per week with an affected loved one, especially if they cannot be left alone. In a 2006 survey of patients with long-term care insurance, the direct and indirect costs of caring for an Alzheimer's disease patient averaged $77,500 per year in the United States. Caregivers themselves are subject to an increased incidence of depression, anxiety, and, in some cases, physical health issues. According to UK-based research, almost two out of three caregivers of those with dementia feel lonely. Most of the caregivers in the study were family members or friends. Research shows that African Americans face a more significant burden in Alzheimer’s care management and will face more negative life changes and health outcomes due to providing care. African Americans are twice as likely to be diagnosed with dementia as other ethnic groups, and caregivers often materialize as secondary patients due to the severe impact of caregiving on their health and well-being. Additionally, according to the Alzheimer’s Association and NAC/AARP, 60% of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia caregivers are typically female and are 55 or older. This data emphasizes that African Americans are disproportionately affected by Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. In addition, the Hispanic population tends to experience a higher prevalence of caregiver burden. Hispanic/Latino family caregiving can differ significantly from other populations for various reasons. The majority of Hispanic/Latino family caregivers are women in their 40s who provide care for a parent-in-law or other older individuals in the household. They are less inclined to use professional caregiving services compared to other populations, even though their caregiving situations are often highly intensive. According to a study, 63% of Hispanic/Latino caregivers reported their situations as high-burden, whereas 51% of non-Hispanic/Latino caregivers were facing similarly challenging circumstances. Furthermore, a substantial number of Hispanic/Latino caregivers revealed limited support, placing them at a higher risk of experiencing burnout and distress. Additionally, existing studies lack a tailored and focused approach to the needs of Hispanic/Latino caregivers. According to a US study \"the transition to institutional care is particularly difficult for spouses, almost half of whom visit the patient daily and continue to provide help with physical care during their visits. Clinical interventions that better prepare the caregiver for a placement transition and treat their depression and anxiety following placement may be of great benefit to these individuals.\" Thommessen et al. found in a Norwegian study that the most common stressors reported were \"disorganization of household routines, difficulties with going away for holidays, restrictions on social life, and the disturbances of sleep...\" and that this was common to caregivers for dementia, stroke, and Parkinson's disease patients. In a Japanese study, Hirono et al. assessed that the patients' functional and neuropsychiatric impairments were the main patient factors that increased the caregiver's burden.\" Activities are important for the dementia patient because they keep their cognitive functioning. The caregiver should aid them in their activities but should not do it for them. An Italian study by Marvardi et al. found \"that patients' behavioral disturbances and disability were the major predictors of the time-dependent burden; the psychophysical burden was explained mainly by caregiver anxiety and depression.\" Caregivers may experience anticipatory grief and ambiguous loss, and research shows that African American caregivers are less likely to seek help for grief and depression than their Caucasian counterparts. Furthermore, physiological changes such as increased cortisol levels, the body’s primary stress hormone, contribute to impaired cognitive function, perpetuating the problem of Alzheimer’s disease within the African American community since stress is a known causal factor. While family caregivers often care for patients with dementia at home, they also provide a helpful function within nursing or residential aged care facilities. Caregivers of these patients in nursing homes with dementia usually do not have sufficient tools or clinical guidance for helping to manage multiple interventions, such as behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) and medication use. Nurses should provide information to the caregiver on how to take care of the dementia patient, so the caregiver does not neglect them. Respite or day care Caring for someone with dementia is accompanied by many emotional and physical challenges. Respite care is designed to give rest or relief to caregivers and can take place in many different settings, depending on the needs of those involved. Respite services are offered at adult daycare facilities, nursing homes, or in-home. There is a lack of evidence regarding the potential benefits or drawbacks of these interventions. Respite services provided to family members or friends caring for someone with dementia have positive effects such as stress reduction, increased time for relaxation, socialization, and focusing on personal tasks. Respite services provided by a nursing home (or other similar facility) might increase the likelihood of the patient being transferred into an institution, while early utilization of in-home help services can delay institutionalization. Environmental design Architects in designs for aging in place can consider the relationship of the built environment to the functioning and well-being of seniors and create safe and stimulating environments for dementia. The environment that a person with dementia lives in is very important. Nurses should help provide a healthy environment for people with dementia. A negative, frustrated atmosphere from the nurses could lead to emotional neglect for the patients. Nursing home managers do not understand how to take care of their dementia patients either, which could lead to a chaotic and hostile environment. The environment should be conducive to relaxation, stimulating, and engaging. This can result in to both the nurses and the residents being less stressed. Nurses who work in a calm environment have decreased stress levels. The environment in which those with dementia live should foster their ability to be participants and not just observers in their lives and include opportunities for independence. Their environment should allow them to keep their identity. Including things that are personal to them and that serve as reminders of their identity is important and meaningful. This personal environment should also be a place where, if needed, they can have privacy. The areas should also be well lit with minimal items on the ground to reduce the risk of falling or injury. The environment where those with dementia eat their meals should be inviting and foster conversation and socialization. Items designed specifically to help individuals with dementia can also be helpful, such as industrial designer Sha Yao's tableware, which has both a colorful and unique design that stimulates people with dementia and other features that address cognitive, motor, and physical impairments that often arise. Things to do for people with dementia would be: Try to keep a routine, such as bathing, dressing, and eating, at the same time each day. Help the person write down to-do lists, appointments, and events in a notebook or calendar. Plan activities that the person enjoys and try to do them at the same time each day. Consider a system or reminders for helping those who must take medications regularly. When dressing or bathing, allow the person to do as much as possible. Buy loose-fitting, comfortable, easy-to-use clothing, such as clothes with elastic waistbands, fabric fasteners, or large zipper pulls, instead of shoelaces, buttons, or buckles. Use a sturdy shower chair to support a person who is unsteady and to prevent falls. You can buy shower chairs at drug stores and medical supply stores. Be gentle and respectful. Tell the person what you are going to do, step by step, while you help them bathe or get dressed. Serve meals in a consistent, familiar place, and give the person enough time to eat. Communicating Caring for someone with dementia is especially challenging due to the fact that dementia patients soon lose the ability to speak or otherwise communicate and seem unable to understand what's said to them. Since dementia patients have trouble communicating their needs, this can be frustrating for the nurse. Nurses may have a hard time making relationships with their dementia patients because of the communication barrier. How the dementia patient feels is based on their social interactions, and they may feel neglected because of this barrier. Nurses feel pain and helplessness when caring for a dementia patient. Care approaches known variously as patient-centered care or comfort-centered care attempt to address the difficulty in communication between caregiver and patient. These terms are used in reference to all patient populations, not just dementia patients. To communicate with dementia patients who have lost their ability to communicate in traditional ways, nontraditional forms of communication are used. Paying attention to eye movements, facial expressions, and body movements can help caregivers understand them a little better. As each person is affected by dementia differently, a unique form of communication may need to be established. Nurses must use therapeutic communication while talking to patients. Therapeutic lying is a tool that nurses use to reassure patients that they are okay, and it's used in situations that would not harm the patient in any way. Even though they may be nonverbal, that does not always mean they no longer wish to participate in the world around them. Memory strategies Some studies have demonstrated emotional memory enhancement in Alzheimer's patients, suggesting that emotional memory enhancement might be used in the daily management of Alzheimer's patients. One study found that objects are recalled significantly better in Alzheimer's patients if they are presented as birthday presents. Assistive technology There is a lack of high-quality evidence to determine whether assistive technology effectively supports people with dementia to manage memory issues. Thus, it is not presently certain whether or not assistive technology is beneficial for memory problems. Psychological and psychosocial therapies Offering personally tailored activity sessions to people with dementia in long-term care homes may help manage challenging behavior. No evidence supports the idea that activities were better if they match the individual interests of people. At the same time, a program showed that si"
