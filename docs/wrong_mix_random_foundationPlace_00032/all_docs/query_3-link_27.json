Supplementary publications include: Presidential documents of the Hoover Administration (two volumes), Proclamations 1870-2037 and Executive Orders 5076-6070; Consolidated Indexes for 1936-1965; and Consolidated Tables for 1936-1965. [[Page vi]] EXPLANATION The Code of Federal Regulations is a codification of the general and permanent rules published in the Federal Register by the Executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government. The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows: Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1 The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. LEGAL STATUS The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule. To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, January 1, 2023), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule. EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text. OMB CONTROL NUMBERS The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request. [[Page vii]] Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000. ``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law. What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: (a) The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register. (b) The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. (c) The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51. What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010. CFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES A subject index to the Code of Federal Regulations is contained in a separate volume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR Index and Finding Aids. This volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR titles, chapters, subchapters, and parts and an alphabetical list of agencies publishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. An index to the text of ``Title 3--The President'' is carried within that volume. [[Page viii]] The Federal Register Index is issued monthly in cumulative form. This index is based on a consolidation of the ``Contents'' entries in the daily Federal Register. A List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA) is published monthly, keyed to the revision dates of the 50 CFR titles.

[[Page ix]] EXPLANATION OF THIS TITLE This volume of ``Title 3--The President'' contains a compilation of Presidential documents and a codification of regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. The 2022 Compilation contains the full text of those documents signed by the President that were required to be published in the Federal Register. Signature date rather than publication date is the criterion for inclusion. With each annual volume, the Presidential documents signed in the previous year become the new compilation. Chapter I contains regulations issued by the Executive Office of the President. This section is a true codification like other CFR volumes, in that its contents are organized by subject or regulatory area and are updated by individual issues of the Federal Register. Presidential documents in this volume may be cited ``3 CFR, 2022 Comp.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for Proclamation 10334 appearing on page 1 of this book, is ``3 CFR, 2022 Comp., p. 1.'' Chapter I entries may be cited ``3 CFR.'' Thus, the preferred abbreviated citation for section 100.1, appearing in chapter I of this book, is ``3 CFR 100.1.'' This book is one of the volumes in a series that began with Proclamation 2161 of March 19, 1936, and Executive Order 7316 of March 13, 1936, and that has been continued by means of annual compilations and periodic cumulations. The entire Title 3 series, as of January 1, 2023, is encompassed in the volumes listed on page iv. For readers interested in proclamations and Executive orders prior to 1936, there is a two-volume set entitled Proclamations and Executive Orders, Herbert Hoover (March 4, 1929, to March 4, 1933). Codified Presidential documents are published in the Codification of Presidential Proclamations and Executive Orders (April 13, 1945--January 20, 1989). Other public Presidential documents not required to be published in the Federal Register, such as speeches, messages to Congress, and statements, can be found in the Compilation of Presidential Documents and the Public Papers of the Presidents series. A selection of these Office of the Federal Register publications are available for sale from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Publishing Office, Washington, DC 20402. This book was prepared under the direction of John Hyrum Martinez, Director of the Publications and Services Division; Kimberly R. Tilliman, Supervisor of the Presidential and Legislative Publications Unit; and Lois M. Davis, Editor.

Our Founders enshrined the principle of religious freedom in the First Amendment to our Constitution, establishing it as a cornerstone of who we are as a Nation. Today, America remains a religiously diverse Nation--a land uniquely strengthened by the routine and extraordinary commingling of faiths and belief systems. On Religious Freedom Day, we recommit ourselves to the protection and advancement of this vital aspect of our American character--and to protecting the freedom of people of all faiths and none, both across our Nation and around the world. Our country's greatest strength is and always has been our diversity, including the multitude of faiths and beliefs practiced across our Nation. My Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal workforce by ensuring that it resembles the full breadth of our people by promoting diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility, including on the basis of religion. That is why I reestablished the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships to serve people in need by partnering with both religious and secular organizations. These public-private partnerships embody the American system of religious freedom and are effective--whether by working together to get people vaccinated against COVID-19, providing nutritious meals to children, or welcoming and resettling refugees to the United States. [[Page 2]] Everyone should feel safe when attending a religious service, school, a community center event, or while walking down the street wearing the symbols of their faith. To help ensure that everyone can practice their faith without fear, my Administration has implemented increased funding for the Department of Homeland Security's Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which makes funding available to threatened nonprofits-- including houses of worship and other religious affiliated entities--to improve their safety and security. I also signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which included the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act to provide tools that we know are effective in preventing and prosecuting hate crimes. We must constantly affirm that hate has no safe harbor in America. My Administration remains steadfast in our efforts to lead and advance human rights including the freedom of religion around the globe at a time when many people are subject to horrifying persecution for their faith and beliefs. In my life, faith has always been a beacon of hope and a calling to purpose, as it is for so many Americans, and I believe that protecting religious freedom is as important now as it has ever been. We must continue our work to ensure that people of all faiths--or none--are treated as full participants in society, equal in rights and dignity. We can only fully realize the freedom we wish for ourselves by helping to ensure liberty for all. On Religious Freedom Day, let us rededicate ourselves to these fundamental principles. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim January 16, 2022, as Religious Freedom Day. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10335 of January 14, 2022 Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation On a late summer day in 1963, Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., stood on the National Mall before hundreds of thousands of demonstrators who had gathered to march for freedom, justice, and equality. On that day, Dr. King shared a dream that has continued to inspire a Nation: To bring justice where there is injustice, freedom where there is oppression, peace where there is violence, and opportunity where there is poverty. Today, people of all backgrounds continue that march-- raising their voices to confront abuses of power, challenge hate and discrimination, protect the right to vote, and access quality jobs, health care, housing, and education. On this day, we reflect on the legacy of a man who issued a call to the conscience of our Nation and our world. [[Page 3]] Dr. King pushed us to see ourselves in one another, recognizing that we are ``caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny.'' He reminded us that we have a duty to uphold our founding ideals and work to perfect our Union. Through bus boycotts, restaurant sit-ins, freedom rides, and marches, the movement that Dr. King helped lead used non-violent protest and civil disobedience to advance the call for justice. He was jailed dozens of times for his efforts, but Dr. King's commitment to justice never wavered. From a Birmingham jail, he reminded us that ``human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability . . . injustice must be rooted out by strong, persistent, and determined action.'' Living up to his legacy, and what Dr. King believed our Nation could become requires more than just reflection--it requires action. We must protect the hard-fought gains he helped achieve and continue his unfinished struggle. That is why the Congress must pass Federal legislation to protect the right to vote--a right that is under attack by a sinister combination of voter suppression and election subversion. We must confront the scourge of racism and white supremacy--a stain on our Nation--and give hate no safe harbor in America. We must strive to achieve not just political equality but also economic justice so that workers can earn a decent living, students can learn safely, the sick can access health care, the poor can climb out of poverty, the elderly can age with dignity, and everyone in America can live without discrimination or fear. Just as in Dr. King's time, there are those who now say that change would be too disruptive and that these urgent needs can wait. But we must resist complacency, summon new resolve to advance the cause of freedom and opportunity, and do our part to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice. This is the cause of our time. We are at an inflection point in our history--in the midst of a battle for the very soul of our Nation. We all must find the courage to keep pushing forward in our struggle to realize Dr. King's dream for a freer, fairer, and more just society. We must keep the faith in that righteous cause--and in each other. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim Monday, January 17, 2022, as the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday. I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service projects in honor of Dr. King and to visit www.MLKDay.gov to find Martin Luther King, Jr., Day of Service projects across our country. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. [[Page 4]] Proclamation 10336 of January 31, 2022 American Heart Month, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Heart disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, claiming the lives of more than 650,000 people each year. During American Heart Month, we raise awareness of the risks of heart disease, remember those we have lost, and highlight steps we can all take to save the lives of countless loved ones and address the unequal burden of heart disease in high-risk communities. Through research and innovation, we have made considerable progress in recent years to advance our knowledge and treatment of heart disease. New technologies allow us to diagnose, prevent, and treat heart disease more rapidly and effectively than ever before. We also have a better understanding of heart disease risk factors, such as high blood pressure, bad cholesterol, smoking, being overweight or obese, and type 2 diabetes. Despite the significant progress we have made, heart disease continues to exact a heartbreaking toll--a burden disproportionately carried by Black and brown Americans, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and people who live in rural communities. Cardiovascular diseases--including heart conditions and strokes--are also a leading cause of pregnancy- related deaths, which are highest among women of color. Addressing these tragic disparities and improving heart health has never been more important, as people suffering from heart disease and related conditions are also at increased risk of severe illness and long-term effects from COVID-19. My Administration is committed to supporting Americans in their efforts to achieve better heart health, as well as closing the racial gaps in cardiovascular disease. That is why I have asked the Congress to launch a major new initiative--the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health, or ARPA-H--which would invest billions of dollars in preventing, detecting, and treating cancer, cardiovascular conditions, and other deadly diseases. My Administration is also working across Federal agencies to develop new programs to alleviate heart health disparities, including those that threaten maternal health. Engaging in regular physical activity, maintaining a healthy diet and weight, managing stress, avoiding smoking and vaping, and getting quality sleep each night can all reduce the risk of heart disease and help people live longer, healthier lives. While it is essential to see a health care professional if you have symptoms or risk factors related to heart disease, research shows that taking a little time each day to promote a healthy lifestyle can help improve your long-term heart health. On Friday, February 4th--National Wear Red Day--we honor those we have lost to heart disease and raise awareness of the actions we can all take to prevent it. The First Lady and I encourage all Americans to observe this important day. Continuing the fight against cardiovascular disease is crucial to improving our Nation's public health. During American Heart Month, we must recommit ourselves to ensuring a healthier future for all Americans. [[Page 5]] In acknowledgement of the importance of the ongoing fight against cardiovascular disease, the Congress, by Joint Resolution approved December 30, 1963, as amended (36 U.S.C. 101), has requested that the President issue an annual proclamation designating February as ``American Heart Month.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 2022 as American Heart Month, and I invite all Americans to participate in National Wear Red Day on February 4, 2022. I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and reaffirming our commitment to fighting cardiovascular disease. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10337 of January 31, 2022 National Black History Month, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Each February, National Black History Month serves as both a celebration and a powerful reminder that Black history is American history, Black culture is American culture, and Black stories are essential to the ongoing story of America--our faults, our struggles, our progress, and our aspirations. Shining a light on Black history today is as important to understanding ourselves and growing stronger as a Nation as it has ever been. That is why it is essential that we take time to celebrate the immeasurable contributions of Black Americans, honor the legacies and achievements of generations past, reckon with centuries of injustice, and confront those injustices that still fester today. Our Nation was founded on an idea: that all of us are created equal and deserve to be treated with equal dignity throughout our lives. It is a promise we have never fully lived up to but one that we have never, ever walked away from. The long shadows of slavery, Jim Crow, and redlining-- and the blight of systemic racism that still diminishes our Nation today--hold America back from reaching our full promise and potential. But by facing those tragedies openly and honestly and working together as one people to deliver on America's promise of equity and dignity for all, we become a stronger Nation--a more perfect version of ourselves. Across the generations, countless Black Americans have demonstrated profound moral courage and resilience to help shape our Nation for the better. Today, Black Americans lead industries and movements for change, serve our communities and our Nation at every level, and advance every field across the board, including arts and sciences, business and law, health and education, and many more. In the face of wounds and obstacles older than [[Page 6]] our Nation itself, Black Americans can be seen in every part of our society today, strengthening and uplifting all of America. Vice President Harris and I are deeply committed to advancing equity, racial justice, and opportunity for Black Americans as we continue striving to realize America's founding promise. That began by building a Federal Government that looks like America: including the first Black Secretary of Defense, the first Black woman to head the Office of Management and Budget, the first Black man to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, the first Black woman to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development in more than 40 years, the first Black chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisors, a Black Ambassador representing America at the United Nations, and the first Black and South Asian Vice President in our history. We have been proud to appoint accomplished Black Americans to serve in a vast array of roles across our Administration. I am prouder still to have already nominated eight Black women to serve as Federal appellate judges-- matching in just 1 year the total number of Black women who have ever served on Federal appeals courts. My Administration has worked hard to reverse decades of underinvestment in Black communities, schools, and businesses. Both the American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law are making historic investments in Black America--from vaccine shots in arms to checks in families' pockets and tax cuts for working families with children to a landmark $5.8 billion investment in and support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. And in my first year in office, the American Rescue Plan provided the full Child Tax Credit to the lower income families of more than 26 million children--who are disproportionately Black--and put us on a path to cut Black child poverty in half. As the Infrastructure Law continues to be implemented, we will expand on that progress. Lead service lines that have contaminated the water of too many homes and schools in Black communities will be removed and replaced. We will deliver high-speed internet to every community so that no Black family is left behind in the 21st century economy. Historic investments in public transportation will help more people in more neighborhoods get to where good jobs actually are quickly and safely. We will reconnect Black neighborhoods cut off from opportunity by highways that were built to brush them aside. Long-standing environmental injustices that have hit Black communities the hardest will be remediated. We will deliver major investments in Black entrepreneurs and small businesses--including making the Minority Business Development Agency permanent and seeding it with a record $110 million in new resources to help level the playing field for Black businesses. But this is only the start. To fulfill America's promise for all, we will work tirelessly in the year ahead to deliver on my Build Back Better agenda, bringing down the costs that families face on child care, housing, education, health care, prescription drugs, and so much more. We will continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic with equity at the center of our response. We will not rest until we have protected the foundation of our democracy: the sacred right to vote. And we will fight to keep dismantling all of those structural inequities that have served as barriers for Black families for generations. [[Page 7]] As we celebrate National Black History Month, let us all recommit ourselves to reach for that founding promise. Let us continue to fight for the equity, opportunity, and dignity to which every Black American is due in equal measure. Let us carry forward the work to build an America that is, in the beautiful words of the poet Amanda Gorman, ``Bruised, but whole--benevolent, but bold, fierce, and free.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2022 as National Black History Month. I call upon public officials, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10338 of January 31, 2022 National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation During National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we recommit ourselves to ensuring our society is one in which all young people can live fulfilling and productive lives free of violence and fear. Teen dating violence takes many forms, including physical or sexual assault, stalking, coercive and controlling behavior, emotional abuse, harassment, and exploitation. It can occur in person, online, or through various forms of technology. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention research shows that more than 8 percent of high school students in the United States reported experiencing physical or sexual dating violence over the course of a 1-year period, with young women and LGBTQI+ youth facing the highest rates. Young people who are survivors of teen dating violence can suffer from depression, substance abuse, risk of suicide, eating disorders, poor academic outcomes, unintended pregnancy, and other struggles. Sadly, survivors of teenage dating violence are more likely to be revictimized as adults. These effects are compounded for girls and young women of color, who are less often recognized as survivors of dating and sexual violence and face additional barriers to seeking help. My Administration is committed to supporting programs that are proven to help preteens and teens develop safe and healthy relationships. We have released a range of new resources to equip communities with effective tools to prevent and address teen dating violence. These tools will help teens stay safe online and when they use electronic devices; help colleges and universities respond effectively to dating violence, sexual assault, stalking [[Page 8]] and other forms of abuse; and provide resources and training programs that prevent abuse and promote healthy relationships. Information on these programs, as well as other resources, are available at VetoViolence.CDC.gov. We are also enforcing Title IX's protections for students on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation to support transgender students who experience higher rates of violence. During National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month, we recommit ourselves to ending this scourge of our society and providing our young people every chance to live the fulfilling and productive lives they deserve. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 2022 as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month. I call upon everyone to educate themselves and others about teen dating violence so that together we can stop it. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10339 of February 4, 2022 To Continue Facilitating Positive Adjustment to Competition From Imports of Certain Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells (Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products) By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation 1. On January 23, 2018, pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the ``Trade Act'') (19 U.S.C. 2253), the President issued Proclamation 9693, imposing a safeguard measure for a period of 4 years that included both a tariff-rate quota (TRQ) on imports of certain crystalline silicon photovoltaic (CSPV) cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, provided for in subheading 8541.40.6025 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), and an increase in duties (safeguard tariff) on imports of CSPV cells exceeding the TRQ and all imports of other CSPV products, including modules provided for in subheading 8541.40.6015 of the HTS. Proclamation 9693 exempted imports from certain designated beneficiary countries under the Generalized System of Preferences from the application of the safeguard measure. 2. Clause (4) and Annex I of Proclamation 9693 directed the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to establish procedures for interested persons to request the exclusion of particular products from the safeguard measure. These provisions also authorized the USTR, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, to determine whether a [[Page 9]] particular product should be excluded, and, upon publication of a determination in the Federal Register, to modify the HTS to implement such determination. Furthermore, they authorized the USTR to modify or to terminate such determinations. Effective June 13, 2019, the USTR excluded bifacial solar panels that absorb light and generate electricity on each side of the panel and that consist of only bifacial solar cells that absorb light and generate electricity on both sides of the cells (bifacial modules). Exclusion of Particular Products From the Solar Products Safeguard Measure, 84 FR 27684 (June 13, 2019). 3. On February 7, 2020, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) issued its report, pursuant to section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)), on the results of its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic solar industry (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry, No. TA-201-075 (Monitoring)). In its report, the USITC found that, following imposition of the safeguard measure, prices for CSPV cells and modules declined in a manner consistent with historical trends, but that prices were higher than they would have been without the safeguard measure. 4. On March 6, 2020, the USITC issued an additional report pursuant to a request from the USTR under section 204(a)(4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(4)), regarding the probable economic effect on the domestic CSPV cell and module manufacturing industry of modifying the safeguard measure to increase the level of the TRQ on CSPV cells from the current 2.5 gigawatts (GW) to 4.0, 5.0, or 6.0 GW (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products: Advice on the Probable Economic Effect of Certain Modifications to the Safeguard Measure, No. TA-201-075 (Modification)). In its report, the USITC advised that increasing the TRQ would help to continue growth in solar module production, but that expanded access to imported cells not subject to safeguard duties would put downward pressure on prices for cells made in the United States. 5. After taking into account the information provided in the USITC's reports, and after receiving a petition from a majority of the representatives of the domestic industry with respect to each of the following modifications, and under section 204(b)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)(B)), the President issued Proclamation 10101 on October 10, 2020, in which he determined that the domestic industry has begun to make a positive adjustment to import competition, as shown by the increases in domestic module production capacity, production, and market share. Proclamation 10101 also: (a) revoked the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard measure on the basis that it had impaired and was likely to continue to impair the effectiveness of the safeguard action; and (b) adjusted the safeguard tariff for the fourth year of the safeguard measure from 15 percent to 18 percent on the basis that the exclusion of bifacial modules from application of the safeguard tariffs had impaired the remedial effectiveness of the 4-year action proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, and to achieve the full remedial effect envisaged in that action. 6. On November 16, 2021, the United States Court of International Trade held in Solar Energy Industries Association et al. v. United States (SEIA) [[Page 10]] that the President acted outside of his statutory authority in issuing Proclamation 10101, and enjoined the Government from enforcing that proclamation. This injunction had the effect of reinstating the exclusion of bifacial modules from the safeguard tariffs and lowering the fourth year safeguard tariff to 15 percent. On January 14, 2022, the Government filed a notice of appeal of SEIA to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 7. On December 8, 2021, in response to petitions by representatives of the domestic industry, the USITC issued its determination and report pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), finding that safeguard action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition (USITC, Crystalline Silicon Photovoltaic Cells, Whether or Not Partially or Fully Assembled Into Other Products, Investigation No. TA-201-75 (Extension)). 8. Section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)) authorizes the President, after receiving an affirmative determination from the USITC pursuant to section 204(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(c)), to extend the effective period of any action taken under section 203 of the Trade Act if the President determines that the action continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury, and there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition. 9. After taking into account the information provided in the USITC's report and the information received from the public through the process published in the Federal Register on September 30, 2021 (86 FR 54279), pursuant to section 203(e)(1)(B) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)(B)), I have determined that the safeguard action on imports of CSPV cells, whether or not partially or fully assembled into other products, continues to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry, and that there is evidence that the domestic industry is making a positive adjustment to import competition. I have further determined to extend the safeguard measure proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, as modified by Proclamation 10101 (to the extent permitted by law), as follows: (a) continuation of the TRQ on imports of solar cells not partially or fully assembled into other products described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation for an additional period of 4 years, with unchanging within-quota quantities of 5.0 GW for each year and annual reductions in the rates of duty applicable to goods entered in excess of those quantities of cells in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to this proclamation; (b) continuation of the increase in duties on imports of modules described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation for an additional period of 4 years, with annual reductions in the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth years, as described in Annex I to this proclamation; and (c) exclusion of bifacial panels from the extension of duties proclaimed in this paragraph. 10. I have determined that an extension of this safeguard measure will provide greater economic and social benefits than costs. [[Page 11]] 11. As provided in Proclamation 9693, this safeguard measure shall continue to apply to imports from all countries, except as provided in clause (4) of this proclamation and paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9693. 12. Section 204(a)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(a)(2)) requires the USITC to issue a report on its monitoring of developments with respect to the domestic industry, including the progress and specific efforts made by workers and firms in the domestic industry to make a positive adjustment to import competition, no later than the midpoint of the period of the extension. After I receive that report, I will evaluate whether to reduce, modify, or terminate the safeguard measure pursuant to section 204(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2254(b)(1)). 13. As proclaimed in Proclamation 9693, the in-quota quantity in each year of the TRQ described in paragraph 9 of this proclamation shall be allocated among all countries except those countries the products of which are excluded from such TRQ pursuant to clause (4) of this proclamation or paragraph 10 of Proclamation 9693. 14. In order to address certain technical errors in the HTS, the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex II to this proclamation. 15. Section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including sections 203, 204, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that: (1) In order to extend the measure applicable to imports of CSPV cells, not partially or fully assembled into other products, described in paragraph 1 of this proclamation, subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS is modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation, subject to clauses (3) and (4) below. Any merchandise subject to the safeguard measure that is admitted into United States foreign trade zones on or after 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on February 7, 2022, must be admitted as ``privileged foreign status'' as defined in 19 CFR 146.41, and will be subject upon entry for consumption to any tariffs or quantitative restrictions related to the classification under the applicable HTS subheading. (2) Except as provided in clause (3) below, imports of CSPV products of World Trade Organization Member countries, as listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 to subchapter III of chapter 99 of the HTS (Note 18), shall continue to be excluded from the safeguard measure extended by this proclamation, and such imports shall not be counted toward the TRQ limits that trigger the over-quota rates of duties. (3) If, after the extension proclaimed herein is in effect, the USTR determines that: (a) the share of total imports of a country listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 exceeds 3 percent; [[Page 12]] (b) imports of the product from all listed countries with less than 3 percent import share collectively account for more than 9 percent of total imports of the product; or (c) a country listed in subdivision (b) of Note 18 is no longer a developing country for purposes of this proclamation; the USTR is authorized, upon publication of a notice in the Federal Register, to revise subdivision (b) of Note 18 to remove the relevant country from the list or suspend operation of that subdivision, as appropriate. (4) I instruct the USTR to enter into negotiations pursuant to section 203(f) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(f)) with Canada and Mexico. In the event that the USTR concludes an agreement that the USTR, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, determines will ensure that imports of Canada or Mexico do not undermine the effectiveness of the action extended through clause (1) of this proclamation, the USTR is authorized, upon publication of a notice in the Federal Register, to revise Note 18 to suspend application of that subdivision, in whole or in part, as appropriate, with respect to imports of Canada or Mexico. If the USTR subsequently determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of Energy, that such an agreement is not effective, the USTR is authorized, pursuant to section 203(f) of the Trade Act, by publication of a notice in the Federal Register, to revise Note 18 to terminate any previous suspension of the action with respect to imports of Canada or Mexico. (5) One year after the termination of the safeguard measure established in this proclamation, the U.S. note and tariff provisions established in Annex I to this proclamation shall be deleted from the HTS. (6) Any provision of previous proclamations and Executive Orders that is inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation is superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. [[Page 13]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TD09FE22.013 [[Page 14]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TD09FE22.014 [[Page 15]] [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TD09FE22.015 [[Page 16]] Proclamation 10340 of February 18, 2022 National Eating Disorders Awareness Week, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation National Eating Disorders Awareness Week provides an opportunity to draw attention to one of the most serious mental health conditions impacting the lives of Americans and their families today. Eating disorders-- including binge-eating, bulimia nervosa, and anorexia nervosa--affect people of all backgrounds and genders. Nearly 1 in 10 Americans are expected to develop an eating disorder in their lifetime. In recent years, there has been a troubling surge in eating disorders among children, older adults, military service members, and transgender individuals. When undiagnosed or untreated, eating disorders can have serious--even fatal--consequences, which is why improving mental health services and support is so important. The COVID-19 pandemic has been especially challenging for individuals with eating disorders. National eating disorder hotlines have seen a more than 70 percent spike in the volume of calls and chats since the pandemic started. Research shows that the number of hospitalizations for eating disorders has doubled during that same time period. Despite the fact that eating disorders have among the highest mortality rate of any mental illness, the shame and stigmatization of eating disorders often prevent people who are suffering from seeking help. That is why it is important to make more people aware that, with early detection and medical intervention, full recovery from an eating disorder is possible. My Administration is working to improve access to treatment, recovery, and social support for everyone currently living with an eating disorder as well as for their caregivers, families, and friends. Through the National Institute of Mental Health, we are working to develop better therapies and interventions. My Administration is also working to ensure that eating disorder care and treatment are treated the same as any other medical conditions by health insurance plans. Funding from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides health care providers, families, caregivers, and community members the tools, training, and resources to recognize the symptoms of an eating disorder so that referrals to specialty providers and treatment can be provided as early as possible. We are also working to increase access to mental health services and support for young people, who are uniquely vulnerable to eating disorders. The American Rescue Plan included $122 billion to help schools reopen safely, enabling them to support the mental health of their students. I have also called for doubling the number of school- based health counselors, social workers, and nurses. Together, these resources will be essential to addressing the mental health needs of our Nation's youth. To all those families who have watched a loved one face an eating disorder and to all those who are currently facing or recovering from an eating disorder--you are in our hearts and you are not alone. It is within our power to reduce the burden of eating disorders on the lives of Americans and [[Page 17]] their families. As we work toward these improvements, immediate assistance is available for those in need of help. The SAMHSA National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 is a confidential, free, 24-hour-a-day, 365- days-a-year information and referral service. For anyone experiencing a crisis, immediate help is also available by calling the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 21 through February 27, 2022, as National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. I encourage citizens, government agencies, private businesses, nonprofit organizations, and other interested groups to join in activities that will increase awareness of what Americans can do to prevent eating disorders and improve access to care and other support services for those currently living with an eating disorder. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10341 of February 18, 2022 Day of Remembrance of Japanese American Incarceration During World War II By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Eighty years ago, on February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, stripping people of Japanese descent of their civil rights. That order and the subsequent actions carried out by the Federal Government represent one of the most shameful chapters in our Nation's history. On this Day of Remembrance of Japanese American Incarceration During World War II, we acknowledge the unjust incarceration of some 120,000 Japanese Americans, approximately two- thirds of whom were born in the United States. Despite never being charged with a crime, and without due process, Japanese Americans were forcibly removed from their homes and communities and incarcerated, simply because of their heritage. For years, many Japanese Americans lived in harsh, overcrowded conditions, surrounded by barbed wire fences and armed guards. Not only did they lose their homes, businesses, property, and savings--they also lost their liberty, security, and the fundamental freedoms that belong to all Americans in equal measure. I have always believed that great nations do not ignore their most painful moments--they confront them with honesty and, in doing so, learn from them and grow stronger as a result. The incarceration of Japanese Americans 80 years ago is a reminder to us today of the tragic consequences we invite when we allow racism, fear, and xenophobia to fester. [[Page 18]] Today, we reaffirm the Federal Government's formal apology to Japanese Americans whose lives were irreparably harmed during this dark period of our history, and we solemnly reflect on our collective moral responsibility to ensure that our Nation never again engages in such un- American acts. We acknowledge the intergenerational trauma and loss that the incarceration of Japanese Americans has caused. We also uplift the courage and resilience of brave Japanese Americans who, despite being unjustly incarcerated, formed powerful communities and marshalled incredible dignity and strength. Many of those whose families were incarcerated volunteered or were drafted to serve in combat--courageously serving in the 100th Infantry Battalion, Military Intelligence Service, Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, Army Nurse Corps, and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team with unwavering patriotism. The all-Japanese American 100th Infantry Battalion and the 442nd Regimental Combat Team became two of the most decorated and distinguished military units in our Nation's history. Countless Japanese Americans carry forward this legacy of extraordinary service today, and their work to preserve the history of this period strengthens our Nation and our democracy. We reflect on the bravery of civil rights leaders like Fred Korematsu, Minoru Yasui, Gordon Hirabayashi, and Mitsuye Endo, and that of every Japanese American who organized and sought redress. Their efforts helped bring about the first Day of Remembrance, led President Jimmy Carter to sign the law creating the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians, and spurred President Ronald Reagan to sign the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provided monetary reparations to living survivors and an official apology to the Japanese American community. At the same time, we also acknowledge the painful reality that Japanese Latin Americans, who were taken from their Central and South American homes and incarcerated by the United States Government during World War II, were excluded from the Civil Liberties Act of 1988. Today, the National Park Service helps preserve several Japanese American incarceration camps. These tangible reminders of our history provide important spaces for reflection and learning about the injustices born of prejudice. Preserving incarceration sites as national parks and historic landmarks is proof of our Nation's commitment to facing the wrongs of our past, to healing the pain still felt by survivors and their descendants, and to ensuring that we always remember why it matters that we never stop fighting for equality and justice for all. My Administration is committed to maintaining these national parks and landmarks for future generations and to combating xenophobia, hate, and intolerance--including through the reestablished White House Initiative on Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders. In the words of Dr. Frank Kitamoto, who was incarcerated as a child, ``This is not just a Japanese American story but an American story with implications for the world.'' The words we use to describe the historical and present treatment of communities of color and other underserved communities have profound meaning. Today, we recognize that euphemistic terms that we have collectively used in the past--such as ``assembly centers,'' ``relocation,'' or ``internment''--do not adequately describe the injustice experienced by some 120,000 people; we recognize the forced removal and mass incarceration of [[Page 19]] Japanese Americans and others during World War II; and we reaffirm our commitment to Nidoto Nai Yoni, which translates to ``Let It Not Happen Again.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim February 19, 2022, as a Day of Remembrance of Japanese American Incarceration During World War II. I call upon the people of the United States to commemorate this injustice against civil liberties and civil rights during World War II; to honor the sacrifice of those who defended the democratic ideals of this Nation; and to commit together to eradicate systemic racism to heal generational trauma in our communities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10342 of February 28, 2022 American Red Cross Month, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Throughout our history, Americans have always stepped up for each other in moments of crisis. This spirit is woven into the fabric of our Nation, and for more than 140 years it has been exemplified by devoted employees, volunteers, and supporters of the American Red Cross. This month, we honor the American Red Cross and the selfless Americans who serve our communities in need across our country and around the world. Since its founding in 1881 by Clara Barton, a nurse and educator, the American Red Cross has carried out its noble mission of preventing and easing human suffering. Today, in big cities and small towns across the country, hundreds of thousands of Red Cross workers--more than 90 percent of whom are volunteers--continue to carry out that mission by selflessly giving blood, making donations, and teaching first aid in local communities. Support from the American Red Cross has provided hope to people in their darkest hours--in the face of armed conflict, climate-related disasters, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Red Cross volunteers are on the front lines of recovery, providing emergency shelter to families impacted by devastating floods, tornadoes, fires, and other disasters; donating lifesaving blood to meet the rising demand of hospital patients; supporting our Nation's service members, veterans, and their families; and providing medical care and essential resources to combat diseases worldwide. During American Red Cross Month, Americans who can are encouraged to answer the call to donate blood and serve communities in need. You are [[Page 20]] encouraged to learn more about eligibility and the steps involved to donating blood. Let us renew our commitment to Clara Barton's timeless ideal of caring for one another in times of hardship and uncertainty. Let us take part in this proud tradition of lending a helping hand to those in need. Let us live up to the duty of care we owe each other through acts of compassion every day. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America and Honorary Chair of the American Red Cross, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2022 as American Red Cross Month. I encourage all Americans to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities, and by supporting the work of service and relief organizations. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10343 of February 28, 2022 Irish-American Heritage Month, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation For centuries, Irish Americans have played a crucial role in helping define the soul of our Nation, and today, nearly 1 in 10 Americans proudly trace their roots back to the Emerald Isle. With hope and faith in their hearts, the first immigrants from Ireland crossed the Atlantic in search of liberty and opportunity. It was the dream of a better life that brought my ancestors--the Blewitts of County Mayo and the Finnegans of County Louth--and countless other Irish immigrants. Like so many Irish American families, my grandparents carried the spirit and memory of Ireland in their hearts--a pride and passion they instilled in their home in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Through the journeys of their own mothers and fathers and in the lessons they passed on to my mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, they joined Irish Americans in every corner of America in helping to write the next chapter of the American story. The story of Irish Americans has always been one of strength and perseverance through adversity. Many Irish immigrants arrived on America's shores to escape the Great Famine, only to face discrimination, prejudice, and poverty. Despite these hard times, they embraced their new homes in every corner of America--from the Atlantic to the Pacific, across the Midwest and through the Rocky Mountains--and helped build and fortify our Nation into what it is today. Irish Americans expanded the American middle class, building ladders of opportunity that future generations could climb. They became teachers, [[Page 21]] firefighters, police officers, labor leaders, farmers, business owners, and more. Along the way, Irish Americans contributed enormously to the American labor movement--championing safe working conditions, advocating for children's rights, and fighting racism, prejudice, and income inequality. They bravely answered the call to serve, defending our Union and its values in every battle. They continue to work on behalf of the American people as public servants--serving in the Congress, the Supreme Court, Federal agencies, the White House, and in State and local offices across the country. Irish Americans have enriched our culture and nourished our hearts and souls through the arts and humanities, earning recognition as Nobel and Pulitzer prize-winning poets and authors, award-winning musicians, storytellers, and dancers, and critically acclaimed actors. They have blessed our Nation with their indomitable spirit, faith, and love for family that has been passed down through the generations. This sense of community, hospitality, resilience, and passion are integral pieces of America's cultural tapestry. The United States and Ireland are deeply and forever intertwined: linked in memory and imagination--in joy, sorrow, and resilience--by our common love and common dreams. We share, in every heart, an unrelenting optimism--a flicker of hope that guides us through even the darkest of nights. As we celebrate Irish-American Heritage Month, let us honor the journey and contributions of Irish Americans who helped shape this land of opportunity and define what it means to be American. Let us reaffirm the legacy of friendship and strong family ties between the United States of America and Ireland--united by our common purpose, by our histories, and by our futures. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2022 as Irish-American Heritage Month. I call upon all Americans to celebrate the achievements and contributions of Irish Americans to our Nation with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10344 of February 28, 2022 National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Cancer is personal to nearly every family, including my own. Each year, more than 50,000 families across the country lose a loved one to colorectal cancer--the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of [[Page 22]] cancer deaths in America. The toll it exacts is immeasurable, but when we detect colorectal cancer early, we can save lives and deliver hope. During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, we raise awareness of this dreaded disease and renew our commitment to ending cancer as we know it. While anyone can be afflicted by colorectal cancer, we know that this illness strikes at a disproportionate rate among Black Americans as well as Americans over the age of 50. Getting regular screenings and identifying symptoms and risk factors are both pivotal to saving lives. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, symptoms such as blood in the stool, a change in bowel habits, stomach pain, bloating, cramps that do not go away, or weight loss without a known cause should be discussed with a health care provider. However, early stages of colorectal cancer often emerge without symptoms, and it is important to begin regular screenings starting at the age of 45. In addition, people who smoke, consume alcohol, or are obese are more likely to be diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Adopting healthy behaviors--including quitting the use of tobacco products, reducing alcohol consumption, and eating meals that include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains--can also reduce your risk. For more information on risk factors, please visit www.Cancer.gov. I believe that it is within our power to end cancer as we know it. That is why I have re-ignited the Cancer Moonshot and set new ambitious goals, to reduce the death rate from cancer by 50 percent over the next 25 years and to improve the lives of people and their families living with and surviving cancer. I have called on the Congress to create the Advanced Research Projects Agency for Health (ARPA-H), which will invest billions of dollars to advance breakthroughs in the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer and other deadly diseases. As we continue to pursue game-changing scientific breakthroughs, my Administration also remains steadfast in our commitment to increasing colorectal cancer screenings, follow-ups, and referrals, with a particular focus on underserved populations. On February 2, 2022, the First Lady and I launched a call to action on cancer screening and early detection. Our goal is to jumpstart progress on potentially life-saving screenings that far too many Americans have missed as a result of the pandemic and help ensure that everyone in the United States benefits equitably from the tools we have to detect and diagnose cancer. We are calling on every American to get back on track with their recommended screenings, including colorectal cancer screenings, and for the public and private sectors to increase access to early detection for individuals and communities. Ensuring that every American has access to quality, affordable health coverage is another critical way that we can win the fight against cancer. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, most health insurance plans must cover certain preventive services with no out-of-pocket costs. This coverage now includes colorectal cancer screenings for adults over the age of 45, making it easier to get colorectal cancer screenings and helping improve access to earlier treatment. Health coverage under the Affordable Care Act has never been more accessible and affordable than it is today, and I encourage all Americans to learn more by visiting www.HealthCare.gov. [[Page 23]] During National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month, I urge every American to exercise vigilance around their own health and the health of their loved ones. Early diagnosis and treatment save lives--and getting screened for colorectal cancer is vitally important as we continue our shared mission to end cancer as we know it. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2022 as National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. I encourage all citizens, government agencies, private businesses, non-profit organizations, and other groups to join in activities that will increase awareness and prevention of colorectal cancer. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10345 of February 28, 2022 Women's History Month, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Every March, Women's History Month provides an opportunity to honor the generations of trailblazing women and girls who have built our Nation, shaped our progress, and strengthened our character as a people. Throughout our history, despite hardship, exclusion, and discrimination, women have strived and sacrificed for equity and equality in communities across the country. Generations of Native American women were stewards of the land and continue to lead the fight for climate justice. Black women fought to end slavery, advocate for civil rights, and pass the Voting Rights Act. Suffragists helped pass the 19th Amendment to the Constitution so that no American could be denied a vote on the basis of sex. Standing on the shoulders of the heroines who came before them, today's women and girls continue to carry forward the mission of ensuring our daughters have the same opportunities as our sons. Women of the labor movement are achieving monumental reforms to help all workers secure the better pay, benefits, and safety they deserve. LGBTQI+ women and girls are leading the fight for justice, opportunity, and equality--especially for the transgender community. Women and girls continue to lead groundbreaking civil rights movements for social justice and freedom, so that everyone can realize the full promise of America. But despite the progress being made, women and girls--especially women and girls of color--still face systemic barriers to full participation and wider gaps in opportunity and equality. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed and exacerbated those disparities which have disproportionately impacted women's labor force participation, multiplied the burden on paid [[Page 24]] and unpaid caregivers, and increased rates of gender-based violence. The constitutional right to abortion established in Roe v. Wade is facing an unprecedented assault as States pass increasingly onerous restrictions to critical reproductive health care and bodily autonomy. Workers contend with gender and racial wage gaps that can amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars denied over the course of their lifetimes. The Congress sent the Equal Rights Amendment to the States for ratification 50 years ago and it is long past time that the principle of women's equality should be enshrined in our Constitution. My Administration has made this issue a top priority from day one. Through historic Executive actions, my Administration launched Government-wide efforts to advance gender equity and equality, racial equity, and LGBTQI+ equality. Through the American Rescue Plan, my Administration delivered immediate relief to women and families, funded domestic violence and sexual assault services, supported child care providers, and invested in care workers--who are disproportionately women of color. Through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we are working to ensure equitable access to good-paying jobs, particularly in sectors where women have historically been underrepresented. We have taken critical steps to end the scourge of gender-based violence and advocate for the long overdue reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act--legislation that I was proud to author and champion as a United States Senator. We are confronting the epidemic levels of violence that transgender women and girls continue to face. We are working to expand access to health care, including reproductive health care for all people regardless of their gender, race, ethnicity, income, or zip code. We are fighting to lower the costs of child care and provide access to free preschool for all three- and four-year olds. We issued a call to action to eliminate racial disparities in maternal health care, which disproportionately impact Black and Indigenous women. And my Administration established a Gender Equity and Equality Action Fund to advance the rights and economic security of women and girls around the world. This work is being led by the most diverse and gender-balanced Cabinet in American history, including the first woman--and woman of color--to serve as Vice President, Kamala Harris; the first women ever to serve as Treasury Secretary and Director of National Intelligence; the first Native American woman to serve as a Cabinet Secretary; women leading the Departments of Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, along with the Small Business Administration and the Office of Management and Budget; and women of color representing America on the world stage as United States Ambassador to the United Nations and the United States Trade Representative as well as leading my Council of Economic Advisers in the White House. In addition, I established the first White House Gender Policy Council to advance gender equity across the Federal Government and released the first-ever national gender strategy to support the full participation of all people--including women and girls--in the United States and around the world. This Women's History Month, as we reflect on the achievements of women and girls across the centuries and pay tribute to the pioneers who paved the way, let us recommit to the fight and help realize the deeply American vision of a more equal society where every person has a shot at pursuing [[Page 25]] the American dream. In doing so, we will advance economic growth, our health and safety, and the security of our Nation and the world. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2022 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month and to celebrate International Women's Day on March 8, 2022, with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. I also invite all Americans to visit www.WomensHistoryMonth.gov to learn more about the vital contribution of women to our Nation's history. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10346 of March 1, 2022 Read Across America Day, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Reading ignites imagination, insight, and inspiration. It nourishes a child's creativity and curiosity, and inspires a passion for lifelong learning. Books can challenge and inspire. They can teach important lessons, reveal new worlds, and enrich our understanding of our own--of different people, perspectives, and cultures. On Read Across America Day, we celebrate the joy of learning and give thanks to the parents, caregivers, educators, librarians, authors, and community members who invest in our Nation's children. For many young Americans, the path to literacy begins with treasured and timeless traditions: being read to at bedtime, gathering in classrooms for story time, and attending events at local libraries with family and friends. Children's classics such as Dr. Seuss' ``Green Eggs and Ham'' and ``Oh, the Places You'll Go!'' have inspired a passion for reading and endless creativity that spans generations. Today's stories and adventures are as diverse as the world in which we live, and by reading them, we come to more fully understand the vibrant diversity of our Nation--and the world. This is especially important as young people learn and grow and engage with their own sense of identity. Books build each child's sense of belonging and can help inculcate respect and empathy for others. The First Lady, a lifelong educator, has said, ``reading is the foundation of all education. It affects every aspect of our society.'' This has never been truer than today. It is one of the many reasons why my Administration is committed to advancing educational excellence for every child and literacy for every American. It is why I have proposed making 2 years of high-quality preschool available to every child in America. It is one of the reasons why safely reopening schools for in- person instruction was a priority for my Administration from day one--so that children could get back to learning in the classroom with their peers--and why the American Rescue Plan [[Page 26]] included $122 billion to keep schools open safely and help address the learning loss and mental health impacts of missing school. School districts across the country are already using these funds to support literacy efforts by updating curricula and hiring specialists. My Administration is also committed to supporting volunteer and literacy programs that help young people and adults master reading. This work is crucial, as half of adults in the United States are unable to read a book written for the eighth-grade level, and nearly a quarter of American adults have not read a book over the last year. I often say that children are the kite strings that keep our National ambitions aloft. On Read Across America Day, we dedicate ourselves to helping each new generation of readers and thinkers become the leaders who will write a more hopeful chapter in the American narrative and in the story of our shared world. As the great American writer Toni Morrison reminds us: ``If you find a book you really want to read but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 2, 2022, as Read Across America Day. I call upon children, families, educators, librarians, public officials, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10347 of March 4, 2022 National Consumer Protection Week, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation As our Nation recovers and our economy continues its historic growth following a global pandemic, it is important that consumers are fully informed about their rights and the potential risks in the marketplace. Hardworking American families deserve to feel secure in the knowledge that, as we build back better, we are building an economy based on principles of fairness, privacy, and equity. During National Consumer Protection Week, we recommit ourselves to those basic rights, to protecting consumers, to raising awareness about bad actors and deceptive practices in the marketplace, and to empowering people to make informed financial decisions so that our economy works for everyone. My Administration has zero tolerance for criminals who steal Americans' hard-earned dollars or abuse their personal information. Particularly in moments of crisis, like this pandemic, unscrupulous individuals have tried to take advantage of struggling Americans by price gouging, stealing money, [[Page 27]] harvesting personal information, and offering false hope for economic assistance, jobs, treatments, and cures. We are committed to halting these practices and protecting all consumers, including small businesses and gig workers, from fraud and unlawful business practices. Our Nation's consumer protection agencies--including the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and Consumer Product Safety Commission--work with the Department of Justice and law enforcement agencies nationwide to fight fraud, predatory practices, and data exploitation by abusers large and small. These agencies work every day to protect consumers and ensure product safety through investigations, law enforcement actions, and free, actionable, plain- language consumer education resources. Abusive practices have an especially harmful impact on communities of color, who are often targeted by bad actors. A report from the FTC-- Serving Communities of Color--found that people living in majority-Black and Latino communities were more likely to experience problems with credit bureaus, banks and lenders, and used car issues than those living in majority-white communities. That is why my Administration is reviving the Government's top consumer watchdog, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to address racial disparities in access to loans, capital, and credit, while protecting consumers in historically underserved communities. As a Nation, let us work together to create an environment that protects and educates American consumers and communities. This National Consumer Protection Week, and all year long, my Administration is committed to ensuring that every American has access to information that can help protect themselves and their communities. To learn more about these resources, please visit consumer.ftc.gov. To learn how to get involved with National Consumer Protection Week, you can visit ftc.gov/ncpw. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 6, 2022, through March 12, 2022, as National Consumer Protection Week. I call upon government officials, industry leaders, and advocates across the Nation to share information about consumer protection and provide our citizens with information about their rights as consumers. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10348 of March 14, 2022 National Equal Pay Day, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Equal pay is a matter of justice, fairness, and dignity--it is about living up to our values and who we are as a Nation. For over 25 years, Equal Pay [[Page 28]] Day has helped draw attention to gender-based pay disparities by highlighting how far into a new year a woman must work, on average, to earn what a man did in the previous year. This year, Equal Pay Day falls on March 15, the earliest we have ever marked the occasion. The earlier that Equal Pay Day arrives, the closer our Nation has come to achieving pay fairness. But while we should celebrate the progress we have made, as I have said in the past, we should not be satisfied until Equal Pay Day is no longer necessary at all. In 2020, the average woman working full-time, year-round, for wages or a salary earned 83 cents for every dollar paid to their average male counterpart. And once again, the disparities are even greater for Black, Native American, Latina, and certain subpopulations of Asian women when compared to white men. Disabled women also continue to experience significant disparities and make 80 cents for every dollar compared to men with disabilities. The pay gap reflects outright discrimination as well as barriers that women face in accessing good-paying jobs and meeting caregiving responsibilities--including a lack of affordable child care, paid family and medical leave, and fair and predictable scheduling--which often prevent women from joining and staying in the workforce. Over the course of a career, the pay gap can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost earnings, particularly for women of color, significantly impacting retirement savings and uniquely burdening households led by single mothers. The Biden-Harris Administration has moved quickly to deliver results for women and working families and to dismantle the barriers that women face in the workplace. In our first full year in office, we saw the largest calendar year decline in unemployment. We also saw the strongest economic growth in nearly 4 decades, rising wages, and an estimated nearly 40 percent decline in child poverty. We have turned the tide on women's labor force participation, which the COVID-19 pandemic had pushed to a more than 30-year low. In addition, my Administration has taken key steps to address pay discrimination, including issuing an Executive Order directing the Office of Personnel Management to take appropriate steps to advance equal pay at Federal agencies. And I have raised the minimum wage for Federal contractors, which has significantly benefitted women--especially women of color--who are disproportionately represented in minimum-wage and low-wage jobs. We can be proud of that progress--but there is more we need to do. My Administration is fighting to ensure that women have the free and fair choice to organize and collectively bargain for the wages and benefits they deserve and to access training for good-paying jobs in sectors where they have historically been underrepresented. We are working to eliminate anticompetitive barriers that keep women from bargaining for better pay and demanding dignity and respect in the workplace. I have continued to call on the Congress to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which would help mitigate sex-based pay discrimination while ensuring greater transparency and reporting of disparities in wages. And I am continuing to work with the Congress to pass critical legislation that would lower the cost of child care, elder care, home-based health care, and other major barriers to working [[Page 29]] families, while raising compensation for care workers, who are disproportionately women of color and who have been underpaid and undervalued for far too long. If we are going to continue our record-breaking recovery and build a truly strong and competitive economy for the future, we have to address the barriers that have long held women back from full participation and fair treatment in the workforce. The founding promise of our Nation is that all people are created equal--and my Administration is committed to ensuring that all Americans have a fair and equal opportunity to get ahead, so that one day soon we can render Equal Pay Day a relic of the past. NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 15, 2022, as National Equal Pay Day. I call upon all Americans to recognize the full value of women's skills and their significant contributions to the labor force, acknowledge the injustice of wage inequality, and join efforts to achieve equal pay. IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty- sixth. JOSEPH R. BIDEN, JR. Proclamation 10349 of March 18, 2022 National Poison Prevention Week, 2022 By the President of the United States of America A Proclamation Each year, more than 2 million poisoning cases are reported in the United States--some of which are tragically fatal, but many of which are preventable. While we have made great strides in the decades since National Poison Prevention Week was first observed 60 years ago-- including a decline in unintentional poisoning--poisoning remains a risk, especially for children and older Americans. During National Poison Prevention Week, we raise awareness about the dangers posed by poisonous substances, precautions people can take to prevent an incident, and how to respond in a poison emergency. Each year, an average of 31 children die from unintended poisonings at home, and an estimated 75,000 children under the age of five end up in hospital emergency departments from poisoning. Approximately 85 percent of unintentional poisonings take place in the home where medicines and harmful chemicals are stored. To prevent children from unintentionally ingesting poisonous household products, it is important to keep these products out of their sight and beyond their reach. Items such as hand sanitizer, laundry detergent, medications, coin cell batteries, cleaning products, and liquid nicotine should be stored in child-resistant packaging. Medications should be safely secured, [[Page 30]] and if unused, properly discarded. For elderly Americans--particularly those who may have become isolated due to the pandemic--it is important that household products are secured in their original packaging and that medications are clearly labeled to avoid accidental ingestion or the mistaking of medications. Health professionals working around the clock and responding to millions of calls each year at poison control centers are critical to our Nation's response. They not only help the public in need of assistance or information, they are also a tremendous asset to health care providers, health departments, law enforcement, and first responders. If you suspect that you or someone else has been poisoned, do not wait for signs of poisoning. Immediately call the Poison Control Help line at 800-222-1222. For more information, go to poisonhelp.hrsa.gov. Poison awareness, control, and education are essential to saving lives. During National Poison Prevention Week, we recommit to raising awareness about the dangers of accidental poisonings and taking the necessary precautions to prevent and respond quickly to these incidents and protect our loved ones. To encourage Americans to learn more about the dangers of unintentional poisonings and to take appropriate preventive measures, on September 26, 1961, the United States Congress, by joint resolution (75 Stat. 681), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of March each year as ``National Poison Prevention Week.'' NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 20 through March 26, 2022, to be National Poison Prevention Week. I call upon all Americans to observe this week by taking actions to safeguar"
