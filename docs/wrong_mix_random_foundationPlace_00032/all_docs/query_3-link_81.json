I am using LSNRCTL to see what my oracle is listening to. In NAT, I see that XE,XEXDB, XE_XEPT are running. It sees Port 8080 for the oracle database:\n\nWhereas, a bridged connection does not have XE, XEXDB, or XE_XPET running. Also I cannot see port 8080 which is needed to access the database.\n\nIs it possible to add XE, XEXDB, and XE_XPT to the bridged connection? Or change the HOST address for the bridged from 127.0.0.1 to its own ip addresss?\n\nThanks Nimit Shah Informatics Development Co op Sleep Medicine Epidemiology Brigham and Women's Hospital 221 Longwood Avenue Boston, MA 02115\n\nnshah11.partners\n\nNEXT EMAIL\n\nFrom: Viangteeravat, Dr Tee [tviangte.uthsc] Sent: Tuesday, October 18, 2011 9:15 AM To: Joseph.Bonner.hc.msu; i2b2 AUG Members Subject: RE: Epidemiology Study data put into i2b2\n\nHi Joe,\n\nHere is what I did for creating a low-level i2b2 ontology (e.g., demographic). Based on \"Data Installation Guide\" folder structure and information, Directory folder (Metadata), Schema (i2b2metadata), and Project (Demo), once successfully deployed tables for i2b2metadata schema, a low-level ontology tree can be created in i2b2 table to reflect question and answer (tree level 0, 1, or 2) and put the same reference into concept_dimension table (i.e., concept_cd, concept_path). The concept_cd will also have to put into \"observation_fact\" because this is what query will run against.\n\nThanks, Tee\n\nFrom: Natter, Marc [Marc.Natter.childrens.harvard] Sent: Monday, October 17, 2011 5:38 PM To: i2b2 AUG Members Subject: Re: Epidemiology Study data put into i2b2\n\nHi Joe,\n\nWe have done this for our registry efforts and are starting to do it for others. First step for us is constructing a low-level i2b2 ontology (which is just a question and answer ontology tree) based on the form. Then, depending upon the needs of the users, we map this low-level ontology into one or more higher level ontologies by putting the referencing terms in both the ontology cell tables and also the concept_dimension table.\n\nThe data we are using now is exported to us in CDISC ODM (PhaseForward InForm flavor) and we have an import pipeline built with help from Griffin Weber and his team that maps terms to our Q&A ontology and then uses XSLT to programmatically generate the SQL inserts needed for ETL into i2b2. It's a bit of a heavy-weight structure, but we are pulling in such data daily and serves our needs.\n\nSoon as we get it a bit more polished (few months?), we'll be open-sourcing it for others too.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nMarc\n\nFrom: Joseph Bonner <Joseph.Bonner.hc.msu<Joseph.Bonner.hc.msu> Date: Mon, 17 Oct 2011 16:28:37 -0400 To: \"i2b2 AUG Members<i2b2 AUG Members>\" <i2b2 AUG Members<i2b2 AUG Members> Subject: Epidemiology Study data put into i2b2\n\nWe have a large epidemiology study that we want to put into I2B2 to help investigators find new cohorts for analysis.

To change the target concept paths for various breakdowns, edit i2b2data.QT_BREAKDOWN_PATH.VALUE for each (this is why the counts were working for the demo data but not our data) I haven't seen a way to target more than one meta table with this, would you just duplicate a row with the same NAME but different VALUE?\n\n2.

I checked the Jira site and it doesn't show any activity on these issues except from the user community about 1 year ago so I am curious if the team has addressed them yet or not. They represent pretty serious issues in that fairly common usage scenarios will lead to incorrect counts. We are using version 1.4. Here are the issues:\n\nLEOPARD?21 – in the web client the <= and >= operators do not appear to be functioning properly, however the < and > operators do function as expected.\n\nLEOPARD?52 – when a saved query has query by value components and the saved query is executed, the query by value criteria are not applied to the query and erroneously high counts are returned. If the \"set value\" dialog is invoked for each of the parameters and then closed (no need to change anything) and the query is executed, then the correct values are returned.\n\nThese were reported almost a year ago and are (arguably) pretty serious so I am guessing they have been addressed, but I cannot tell from Jira if that's the case. There is a note that as of 1.6 RC2 in december 2010, LEOPARD?21 still was unresolved.\n\nCan anyone verify if these behaviors exist in 1.5 and 1.6? If so, is there a patch that can be applied to 1.4?

Also of note, I used a bridged connection so that I'd be able to connect to the web service (as NAT was giving me a strange 10.0.2.15 address that was unreachable).\n\nI'm running on a Mac OS X, using Virtual Box 4.1.4\n\nAny help would be appreciated, thanks!\n\nRemo Mueller\n\nNEXT EMAIL\n\nFrom: Murphy, Shawn N. Sent: Monday, October 03, 2011 8:53 PM To: Lusted, Jeff; i2b2 AUG Members Subject: RE: Optional columns on the patient_dimension...\n\nHi Jeff,\n\nAlthough the optional columns are allowed in 1.5.x, the query tools and metadata that utilize these columns are implemented starting in 1.6. Optional columns can also be returned in the PDO (other than just the hardcoded ones) starting in\n\n1.6.\n\nThanks, Shawn.\n\nFrom: Lusted, Jeff [jl99.leicester.ac.uk] Sent: Monday, October 03, 2011 6:43 AM To: i2b2 AUG Members Subject: Optional columns on the patient_dimension...\n\nHi Colleagues!\n\nWe here at Leicester have managed to install 1.5.2 on a test basis on two separate infrastructures (university and hospital) and in both have installed another project alongside the two demo projects.\n\nThe questions I have concern optional columns on the patient_dimension and visit_dimension. The docs say \"The patient_dimension table may have an unlimited number of optional columns and their data types and coding systems are specific to the local implementation.\" The patient_dimension for the two demo projects has the following optional columns:\n\nsex_cd, age_in_years_num language_cd race_ cd marital_Status_cd religion_cd zip_cd stateCityZip_Path\n\nSome of these seem to be related to choosing analysis items when making a query. What are the implications of changing the columns: eg: removing a column or changing the name of a column?\n\nI've done a grep of the source and it seems there are references within java code, javascript and some xsd files. For example:\n\n(a) edu.harvard.i2b2.crc.dao.pdo.TablePdoQueryPatientDao.java\n\n(b) Dem1Set_ctrlr.js and Dem2Set_ctrlr.js\n\n(c) i2b2_PDO.xsd and i2b2_PDO_fields.xsd\n\nI've not undertaken any searching within the workbench source yet.\n\nCan anyone give me an idea of what I'm letting myself in for if we change column details? How much local implementation is involved? How difficult does it make setting up numbers of different projects? Do all projects within a domain need to share the same patient_dimension details?\n\nI'm eager to hear your experiences.
