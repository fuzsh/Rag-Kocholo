What is it like to live in Minsk? Would you recommend it? What is the city like?

Minsk is a city you shoud visit, as the concept is very different from European cities, as Vilnius, Warsaw, Riga, Brussels, etc. I spent there 4 years, studying, living, exploring. It's kind of difficult to get used to people over there, as they never smile, never say "hi" to you in the store and only some of them speaks English, so probably it could be "tough" to live in Minsk, if you are foreigner.
