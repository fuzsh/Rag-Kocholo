Red Mitchell, then one of the most acclaimed young bassists on the West Coast, was a ubiquitous presence in the clubs and studios in the 1950s, lending his supple sound and phenomenal technique to the combos of Hampton Hawes, Shelly Manne, and André Previn as well as leading his own quartet, the group heard on this album. Note particularly his sensitive collaboration with the flutist and tenor saxophonist James Clay. Lorraine Geller’s inventive piano and the sensitive drumming of Billy Higgins (still prominent in Los Angeles jazz circles in 2000) round out this superb combo.
