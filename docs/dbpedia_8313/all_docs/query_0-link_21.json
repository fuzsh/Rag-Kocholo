        "text": "I saw a review of a Jim Hall / Red Mitchell recording in 'Jazz Junction' magazine. Title is \"Valse Hot - Sweet Basil, 1978\"\n\nWhat caught my attention was a mention that as well as an Audio CD you got a disc of '96k/24' files. So I decided to buy a copy out of curiosity.\n\nWhat I got was, indeed, two discs. One an Audio CD the other a data disc. The files are in fact 192k/24. So the review was incorrect. Curiously, the sleeve and printing on the disc are *also* wrong.\n\nThe sleeve says \"28BIT 96K\" which is clearly weird.\n\nThe disc has \"24 Bit / 96k\" on it, which is plausible, but wrong.\n\nThe disc seems to be produced by 'Artistshare' a crowdfunded setup. But the info I found on the web about this seems muddled.\n\nAnyone know of other labels/examples of a recording like this which gives you a disc of high res files? Something I wish more companies would do."
