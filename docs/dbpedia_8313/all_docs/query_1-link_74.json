        "text": "When you buy second hand vinyl records from Djungel & Jazz, you should always feel secure in our grade and comments of the product's condition. Normally we do not sell vinyl records where the grade of the media is below VG condition, however, we can sell sleeves with a slightly lower grade, with the argument that you don't listen to the sleeve.\n\nThe majority of our records are visually graded. In many cases, we also listen to the record, and you will find our verdict on the condition of the vinyl record in the comments. If necessary, we wash the disc in our ultrasonic washer and place it in a new antistatic inner sleeve.\n\nWe always try to mention the details and deviations that are essential to know about each individual vinyl record. Please read the comments for the rationale for our grading of the specific vinyl record.\n\nBelow is a brief explanation of how we grade vinyl records and record sleeves. Should a record be incorrectly graded by us, Djungel & Jazz offers a Grading Guarantee that allows you to return the record and receive a full refund. Please read more about our Grading Guarantee and how to proceed here."
