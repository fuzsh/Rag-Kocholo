Scrapple From the Apple\n\nRed Mitchell and Warne Marsh had a series of engagements in Scandinavia during April of 1980. On the 18th and 19th of April they were playing at the Fasching Club in Stockholm where these two CD’s were recorded. The combination of tenorsaxophone and bass were rare but it worked out very good. As Mitchell observed, a duo is the smallest group you can get. &quot;When I layed out it’s obvious that Warne doesn’t need a bass player.He can play all by himself, he can play all the chords, all the rhythms, he can play the bass lines and he certainly knows the melodies&quot;.",
