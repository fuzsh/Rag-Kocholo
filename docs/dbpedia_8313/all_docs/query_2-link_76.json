        "text": "A lyrical and sophisticated musician, Simon Woolf is widely considered to be one of the most fluent and creative jazz double bass players in Europe. He has enjoyed long associations with many leading US and UK jazz musicians, including US stars Benny Golson, Harry Allen, Grant Stewart, John Colianni, Ruby Braff, George van Eps and Howard Alden as well as leading UK musicians such as Bobby Wellins, Dave Cliff and Peter Jacobsen. The performance this evening is a revival of one of Simon’s favourite programmes, in honour of his “Number 1 bass playing hero”, Red Mitchell (whom Simon knew personally, having spent time with him in Stockholm years ago). In addition to his prowess on the bass, Red was also a songwriter & poet, and these works provide the basis of the repertoire this evening, which also features a vocalise performed by singer Imogen Ryall (The Cloggz). Saxophonist Olly Wilby, pianist Matyas Gayer and drummer Joe Edwards complete this talented quintet!\n\n“Woolf…a lyrical third voice” LondonJazz News; “Special mentions for Simon Woolf’s excellent bowed melody on ‘Spring is Here’….outstanding” Jazzwise; “Oliver Wilby’s tenor sax brought swinging life to Body And Soul” the Artbeat of Yorkshire"
