The current average age of NBA players is 26.2 years, but many of the greatest players began their careers when they were just 18 or 19 years old. While numerous players were drafted at this age, the 10 youngest NBA players of all time were only 18 years old during their first game. A few of them were drafted before their 18th birthday. Additionally, all of the players on this list were drafted straight out of high school, a practice which the NBA has prohibited since 2006. None of these players ever played college basketball and went straight to the pros. Some had short careers, while others became legends.
