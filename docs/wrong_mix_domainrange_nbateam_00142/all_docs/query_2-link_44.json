        "text": "Atlantic Division\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nKyrie Irving: Lead the NBA in scoring\n\nYou’ve got that #MambaMentality and always have — put yo’ money where yo’ mouth is and drop 30+ a night.\n\nGordon Hayward: Become LeBron James Lite\n\nThe Celtics need you to round-out your game — especially your playmaking and rebounding. Kyrie can’t do Kyrie things if he doesn’t have an elite wing player to cover up some of his deficiencies.\n\nDanny Ainge: Go get another superstar\n\nYou’ve been the mastermind of one of the greatest rebuilds in league history and still have a treasure chest of assets:\n\nJayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart\n\n2018 Lakers’ 1st round pick (if 2–5) or 2019 Kings’ 1st round pick (unprotected); future Grizzlies’ and Clippers’ 1st round picks (with some protections); and your own 1st round picks\n\nGo get the next young superstar that becomes available. Can you land a disgruntled unicorn like Anthony Davis or Kristaps Porzingis? Do you have the cojones to trade for a Paul George if things don’t go as smoothly as expected in OKC? If a deal doesn’t materialize then don’t be afraid to slightly overpay for some rebounding at the deadline — remember, the goal is to win titles in the end, not collect the shiniest assets.\n\nBrooklyn Nets\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nD’Angelo Russell: Grow up\n\nYou got the fresh start you needed — now it’s time to produce like a №2 pick is supposed to produce and lead like a point guard is supposed to lead.\n\nJeremy Lin: Grow an afro\n\nLet’s just be honest, let’s just be real — you’re a nice player, but you’re never going to come anywhere close to playing at the “Linsanity” level for an entire season. However, you are an afro away from conquering the hair game in its entirety.\n\nMikhail Prokhorov: Sell a stake of the team to an exciting owner\n\nYou sold everyone on being a badass Russian version of Mark Cuban. Instead, you’ve been about as interesting as Bob Dole.\n\nSell a stake of the team to someone who might actually bring some excitement to Brooklyn — how about Peter Chernin? Barstool Sports has taken the sports media world by storm and is headquartered in NYC. What a combo that could be — shady Russian billionaire plus a frat-star influencing sports blog. What could go wrong?\n\nNew York Knicks\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nKristaps Porzingis: GET OUT!\n\nDon’t waste anymore of your career with that crummy Knicks organization — it’s not worth it.\n\nTim Hardaway Jr.: Avoid being arrested for robbing the Knicks\n\nListen Junior, I know a thing or two about stealing money from storied franchises — hell, the Lakers paid me $48.5M over my final 2 years to be one of the least efficient players in NBA history. What you did this offseason — getting 4-years/$71M — was some Ocean’s 11-type shit.\n\nJoakim Noah: Play 50+ games & avoid getting arrested for robbing the Knicks\n\nYou’ve played only 75 games in the past 2 seasons and you hold the “Worst Contract in the NBA” Belt (although Chandler Parsons is lurking). The Mamba challenges you to earn your paycheck for at least one of the four years of the deal you signed last offseason.\n\nPhiladelphia 76ers\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nJoel Embiid: Play 55 games or date Rihanna\n\nIdeally, you could do both.\n\nMarkelle Fultz: Shut up and play\n\nYou talk an awful lot for a kid who couldn’t even lead the University of Washington to 10 wins last season. Enough of the proclamations about how good you are and how good the 76ers are about to be — shut up and show me!\n\nBen Simmons: Become the next Lamar Odom\n\nYou should be watching tape of my former teammate — one of the first great point forwards — Lamar Odom. Much like you, he was a 6'10 lefty with amazing vision, playmaking skills and flair for the spectacular.\n\nToronto Raptors\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nDeMar DeRozan: Make one 3-pointer a game\n\nI know I already gave you a challenge, but that wasn’t basketball-related. You’re a poor man’s version of me, DeMar, extend your range a bit and stuff all the basketball nerds into lockers by hitting some 3-pointers this season.\n\nBruno Caboclo: Arrive\n\nFour years ago, you were a surprise 1st Round Draft pick and Fran Fraschilla hilariously described you as being “two years away from being two years away”. Well, I’m not a mathematician, but this should be the year you start to show some promise.\n\nNorman Powell: Make a leap\n\nThe Raptors’ ceiling with its current roster is an Eastern Conference Finalist, at best. They need a player on their current roster to develop into a star and you’re the one — you’ve shown the ability to be a dependable 3 & D guy in the playoffs, but they need you to become more.\n\nCentral Division\n\nChicago Bulls\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nJerry Reinsdorf: Fire the entire front office\n\nFront Office leaders Gar Forman & John Paxson are a complete joke and should have been fired immediately at the end of the 2017 NBA Draft if not earlier. Here’s a cliff notes summary of their recent work:\n\nTraded Taj Gibson, Doug McDermott & a 2nd round pick for Cameron Payne — sources close to the team recently stated that it was clear after 2 practices that Payne wasn’t good enough to play in the NBA;\n\nTraded Jimmy Butler and the №16 pick for underwhelming rookie Kris Dunn, injured dunker Zach LaVine & the №7 pick — which became Lauri Markkanen (whom the Bulls picked instead of Malik Monk and Donovan Mitchell);\n\nPicked the steal of the draft — Jordan Bell — at №38 . . . only to sell the pick to the Warriors.\n\nHire Sam Hinke!\n\nKris Dunn: Do more of this\n\nDwyane Wade: Get your buyout and join the Cavs; not the Heat or Lakers\n\nI know your boy Udonis Haslem is telling you to come back to South Beach, but your boy LeBron could use some scoring pop off the bench this June. Don’t make us watch Iman Shumpert fire up contested long-2s — that’s your move, Dwyane!\n\nCleveland Cavaliers\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nLeBron James: Give us one more all-time season and post-season\n\nThe Warriors have a better roster than you. Durant is ready to usurp your title as the NBA’s best player. Giannis is knocking on the door. Your co-pilot Kyrie just bolted to your biggest rival in the East. What are you gonna do? Embrace the chaos, reach back and give us one more all-time 2018–19 — win the MVP and NBA Title.\n\nDan Gilbert: Go “All-In”\n\nIs the point of this game to win championships or be very good for a sustained period of time? Other franchises would tank for a decade to get a 1-year championship window like you have right now — go “All-In” this year and figure out the rest later. You’ll be kicking yourself years from now if you don’t.\n\nTy Lue: Become Erik Spoelstra; not Mike Brown\n\nYou’re a great “players’ coach”, ego manager and out-of-bounds play caller — can you develop into a tactician and player developer like Spoelstra? Or will the league figure you out like Brown.\n\nDetroit Pistons\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nAndre Drummond: Hit 50% of your free throws\n\nYour career is at a crossroads — you can up your free throw percentage by 10%–15% and become the next DeAndre Jordan or keep allowing this simple part of the game to haunt you and become the next Andris Biedrins. Please be take the route of the former.\n\nStan Van Gundy: Fire yourself as Team President, focus on coaching\n\nExcept for the Avery Bradley trade that fell into your lap this summer, you’re next best move as the team president was signing backup point guard Ish Smith last summer.\n\nReggie Jackson: Quit being a jackass\n\nYou’ve been given the keys to the car in Detroit, you’ve gotten paid, and you have a great coach — why are you still pissing off your teammates and coaches?\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nHerbert Simon: Get ready to clean house\n\nUnless Victor Oladipo and Domantas Sabonis are both much better than they’ve previously shown, Pacers’ front office botched the Paul George trade. Couple that with the firing of Frank Vogel, the hiring of Nate McMillan and other questionable signings (Monte Ellis, Al Jefferson, etc.), and you should be about ready to clean house with your front office.\n\nMyles Turner: Win the Most Improved Players Award\n\nMake a leap! Paul George is gone and you’re the team’s most promising player. Let’s see you get 18 points and 10 rebounds a night.\n\nGlenn Robinson III: Defend your Dunk Contest Championship\n\nIt’s not gonna get any better for y’all this season. Also, don’t be introduced as “#overlydedicated Glenn Robinson the third” ever again.\n\nMilwaukee Bucks\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo: Win MVP this season\n\nYou’re already the most valuable asset in the league (i.e., the highest trade value), but are you ready to throw your hat into the ring for best basketball player on the planet? Show your Uncle Mamba something special this year.\n\nJason Kidd: Unleash the Slenderman-ball lineup on the rest of the NBA\n\nHere’s the wingspans of some of your main rotation players: John Henson (7'5), Giannis & Thon Maker (7'3), Greg Monroe (7'2), Jabari Parker, Tony Snell & Mirza Teletovic (all 6'11), Khris Middleton and Malcom Brogdon (both 6'10). Figure out how to play the lankiest guys together (there’s some redundancy that needs to be worked out) and unnleash hell on offenses around the NBA this season!\n\nThon Maker: Earn your minutes\n\nThe Bucks gave you a whole lot of developmental minutes that you probably didn’t deserve last season. To your credit, you showed more promised than most expected. Reward the Bucks for investing in you.\n\nSoutheast Division\n\nAtlanta Hawks\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nDennis Schroder: Make the leap Kemba Walker made in his 5th season\n\nYour 4th season and Kemba’s 4th season were very similar — he dramatically improved his efficiency on long-range shooting in his 5th & 6th seasons, blossoming into an All-Star. Time for you to follow suit.\n\nJohn Collins: Do a whole lotta this all season\n\nTravis Schlenk: Keep Tanking\n\nDon’t half-ass your tanking or you’ll end up toiling in mediocrity like the Hornets for the next decade. Keep blowing it up, be horrible for a couple of years, get a superstar in the 2018 Draft and Trust the Process.\n\nCharlotte Hornets\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nKemba Walker: Make an All-NBA team\n\nYou surprised everyone by making the leap from scoring guard to lead guard and lead guard to All-Star guard — take another leap and become an All-NBA guard.\n\nMalik Monk: Win Rookie of the Year\n\nThere’s no way you should have fallen to the №11 pick — show those 10 teams how big of a mistake they made.\n\nDwight Howard: Stay out of the spotlight\n\nNo one really likes you — especially me.\n\nMiami Heat\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nDion Waiters: Never change\n\nJustise Winslow: Average 15 points per game\n\nYear 3 — time to add a new dimension to your game.\n\nPat Riley: Pull off one more epic deal\n\nYou have a lot of decent players and assets, an awesome organization, and a top-5 Head Coach — you just need that one superstar piece. Imagine what Coach Spo could do with one superstar after seeing what he did with a bunch of misfits last year?\n\nOrlando Magic\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nAaron Gordon: Emulate the other part of ‘Nique’s game\n\nFYI — Dominique Wilkins scored 26,668 points in his career — he was much more than the Human Highlight Film as a player. Become more than just a dunker.\n\nElfrid Payton: Make the All-Star Team or cut your hair\n\nC’mon man — you can’t have Sideshow Bob hair if you’re a below average player.\n\nJonathan Isaac: Don’t be a bust\n\nYou’re inconsistency in college, youth and the Magic’s lack of organizational direction doesn’t look too promising. Everything about you screams “Bust” — prove the haters wrong.\n\nWashington Wizards\n\nDear _______________: Kobe challenges you to__________________\n\nJohn Wall: Back it up\n\nYou recently called yourself the best two-way point guard in basketball — back that statement up. Your offensive game hit a Hall of Fame level last season, but your defense fell off a bit. You talked the talk, now walk the walk and put together an MVP-caliber season this year.\n\nBradley Beal: Give us Playoff Bradley Beal all year\n\nPlayoff Bradley Beal looked like prime-Ray Allen last spring. Regular season Bradley Beal was nice, but not nearly as impressive. Make a leap and give us the guy who dropped 38 in a Game 7 for an entire season.\n\nScott Brooks: Succeed where you failed in the past\n\nYou are one of the best young talent developers in the NBA — but your teams have mostly underwhelmed in the playoffs. Learn from your mistakes with Durant and Westbrook — e.g., a lack of offensive play-calling creativity — and help put Wall and Beal in the position to compete with the NBA’s best."
