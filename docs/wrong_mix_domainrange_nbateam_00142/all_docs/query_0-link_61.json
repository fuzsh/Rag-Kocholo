        "text": "OAKLAND — Mike Dunleavy returned to his old neighborhood Sunday night, played well and was greeted at every turn.\n\nWith undiluted scorn.\n\nContempt met him on every sidewalk, front porch and corner. It spewed forth from men and women and children and, I believe, a few pets.\n\nOne year after he was traded by the Warriors, Dunleavy showed up at Oracle Arena wearing an Indiana jersey, the crowd jumping him from the start of a 106-101 Warriors victory. They booed when he was introduced, when he touched the ball, when he dribbled or jogged or took a breath.\n\nDid Dunleavy deserve such treatment? Probably not.\n\nHe has never been caught slapping babies or cursing the elderly or kicking dogs. He’s an unexceptional basketball player, but Warriors fans have seen mediocrity in all sizes, shapes and colors.Dunleavy’s misdemeanor was spending 41/2 years with the Warriors and failing to meet the expectations that came with being drafted third overall in 2002.\n\nHis felonies? Acting as if he didn’t care and the fans don’t matter.\n\nNot very intelligent, especially of someone who attended Duke.\n\nBut that’s why Dunleavy felt the wrath of the fans. Troy Murphy, who was traded away with Dunleavy, got some too, but his was the much less vocal version that finds its way to collateral victims.\n\nDunleavy was the target.\n\nThis isn’t Philadelphia, where fans blistered the ears of Santa Claus. Nor is this Boston, where many Red Sox fans have spent 21 years detesting Bill Buckner. Fans here don’t ask much, especially if they know the athlete cares. If they can see he or she means well. We in the Bay Area are, for the most part, a forgiving people.\n\nBut don’t diss us.\n\nDon’t come in as a No.1 draft pick, stink it up, shrug your shoulders and roll your eyes at those who buy tickets. If you’re going to give uninspired performances and appear uninterested, you’d better produce at a spectacular level — a Barry Bonds level.\n\nBonds got away with being so detached because he was hitting home runs at an astonishing rate. It hardly mattered that he was routinely dismissive, much less a lightning rod for controversy.\n\nDunleavy didn’t do enough to grant him license to blow off local fans when he was here, then insult them when he got to Indiana, expressing delight about being traded to a place where “fans appreciate good basketball.”\n\nThis too easily plays into Mike’s bratty, mopey reputation. He may not fully deserve the rep, but he can’t seem to distance himself from it.\n\nWarriors fans booed Latrell Sprewell because he demonized himself by threatening teammates, fighting teammates and, eventually, attacking the head coach before he left town. Chris Webber was booed because he personified hope, then forced his way out of town. It was taken as a form of rejection.\n\nMany others have come and gone and returned to mixed reaction — or relative ambivalence. Antawn Jamison and Gilbert Arenas get mixed reactions, Joe Smith gets little reaction, Erick Dampier tends to get a small dose of disapproval.\n\nAdonal Foyle, by contrast, received a standing ovation upon returning to Oakland last month. After 10 years with the Warriors, he was waived in the offseason and signed by Orlando. When the Magic visited, Foyle was given a warm musical welcome and a video tribute.\n\nIt was an expression of appreciation for his contributions — not just to the community, where Foyle was a beacon of light, but to the team. He wasn’t a star, nor was he very talented — certainly not as skilled as Dunleavy. Foyle, however, radiated passion and spirit. Fans could see he cared, and how much.\n\nThat’s why A’s fans fell in love with Eric Byrnes, why Giants fans are going to love Aaron Rowand and why Warriors fans bonded with Jason Richardson, who also was blessed with extraordinary physical gifts.\n\nHere’s the rub: Dunleavy was greeted warmly in his debut, and the warmth dissipated over time. It was a case of fans wanting to love Mike, then being disappointed by his play, then hearing and seeing his listless responses to his own shortcomings.\n\nThat sent them over the edge. They were booing him before he was traded away.\n\nDunleavy acknowledged hearing the boos on Sunday. He insisted, naturally, that he didn’t care. He didn’t fight for himself, explain how hard he worked and how disappointed he was in the fans of Oakland.\n\nHe did, however, finish with 18 points, 10 rebounds and seven assists. Such performances were all too rare when he was here.\n\nHe’s better off now. So are the Warriors.\n\nMonte Poole can be reached at (510) 208-6461 or by e-mail at"
