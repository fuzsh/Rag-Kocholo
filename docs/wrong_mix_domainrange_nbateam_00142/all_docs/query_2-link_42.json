        "text": "One of the best forms of entertainment during this entertainment lull has been replays of old sporting event classics – I’ve found myself consuming World Series games, the Rumble in the Jungle, and especially some vintage NBA games.\n\nAnd given that we just watched an incredible decade of Warriors basketball, there have been plenty of great Warriors games to revisit. Late last month, I caught some of the Nuggets vs. Warriors 2013 playoff series – the first playoff run of this era and a thrilling upset. Here’s what stood out to me: Jarrett Jack! Playing crunch time and coming up huge! I mean, I remember loving that at the time, and fully admiring his contributions, but we’ve just become so accustomed to the core of the team as it looked from 2015 and beyond that I think the contributions of guys like Carl Landry and Jack in 2013 may have faded into the background a bit.\n\nThat got me thinking… who were the biggest contributors to this Warriors dynasty, from the early stages of growth to the current rebuild? Everything revolves around Steph Curry, who was drafted to the Warriors in 2009 and rebuilt the team around him in the years that followed. Since then, the Warriors have had 108 non-Steph players take the court, some as core members of the dynasty and others who were just passing through. So here they are, ranked from 108 to 1: the biggest contributors to Golden State Warriors success in the Steph Era. (Games numbers listed are regular season unless otherwise noted.)\n\nCups of Coffee\n\n108. Keith Benson - 3 games 2012. The only 3 games of his career, Benson had a 10-day contract at the end of the 2012 season.\n\n107. Coby Karl - 4 games 2010. Famed coach George Karl’s son had a 10-day contract and picked up the only start of his career in his final NBA appearance with the Dubs.\n\n106. Chasson Randle - 3 games 2020. Randle signed a 10-day with the Dubs right before the season shut down this year. He failed to record a FG but collected 5 points on FTs across 3 games.\n\n105. Malcolm Thomas - 5 games 2013. Thomas also failed to record a FG in his 10-day with the Warriors in March of 2013, then bounced around to four more teams for other brief stints.\n\n104. Zach Norvell - 3 games 2020. Norvell showed some promise in the preseason, and at age 22 still has a shot to catch and build a career somewhere in the league.\n\n103. Jeremy Pargo - 3 games 2020. After playing sparingly for 3 teams from 2011-13, Pargo played internationally in Italy, China, Israel and Russia before shining in the G-League and re-emerging with the tanking 2020 Warriors.\n\n102. Earl Barron - 2 games 2012. Barron actually appeared in the backend of rotations for 7 teams across 8 seasons in the league, but he only played 9 total minutes for the 2012 Dubs.\n\n101. Briante Weber - 7 games 2017. Weber is the only player in the bottom 10 who got a ring (presumably). Weber played for five teams across three seasons, including a few games with the dominant 2017 team during a February lull.\n\n100. Dwayne Jones - 2 games 2013 playoffs. Jones never appeared in the regular season for the Dubs, but appeared for some garbage time minutes (1:54 total) in the playoff series against Denver.\n\n99. Scott Machado - 5 games 2013 playoffs. Machado also never saw action in the regular season, but appeared throughout the 2013 playoff run as a back of the bench player. In the playoff game I mentioned in the intro to this piece, there was a prominent shot of him cheerfully talking with Steph Curry on the bench, so he must have been fairly amiable.\n\n98. Marcus Derrickson - 11 games 2019. Derrickson was on a two-way deal with the 2019 team and was up and down from the G-league for occasional appearances. He was waived by the Hawks this year but is still 22.\n\n97. Mickell Gladness - 18 games 2012. Gladness played a prominent role for the tanking 2012 Warriors, as he was signed with a month to go in the season. He started the last seven games of that season, secured a career high 14 points on the last day of the season, and then never made it back to the league.\n\n96. Chris Wright - 24 games 2012. Another 2012 tankathon contributor, Wright played sparingly as a 14th or 15th man throughout 2012, then played a whopping 46 minutes with 25 points in the season finale that year. He’d only play eight more games in the league after that.\n\n95. Nemanja Nedović - 24 games 2014. Nedovic was a total disappointment as a first-round pick, and a deep dive into the machinations of draft night suggests the Warriors could’ve held on to Andre Roberson instead. The Serbian guard never scored more than 5 points in a game and the Dubs declined to pick up his option and cut him before his second year.\n\nFootnotes\n\n94. Chris Boucher - 1 game 2018. Boucher was a two-way contract guy with Golden State and only ended up seeing 1 minute of action on the court. Since then, he’s shown some promise as a reserve bench player for Toronto and looks likely to be a rotation piece for them in the future.\n\n93. Raja Bell - 1 game 2010. Bell was a savvy veteran when he arrived with the Warriors in the deal that sent Stephen Jackson to Charlotte. But he needed wrist surgery and wasn’t expected to contribute. Nonetheless, with the Dubs down a few players after the trade, Bell suited up and played 23 minutes against the Celtics in November 2009, before shutting it down and getting the surgery.\n\n92. Dewayne Dedmon - 4 games 2014. Dedmon got his start with the Warriors, but was gone after a month of service time with 1 point scored across about 6 total minutes of action. He has now bounced around to a few teams and become a reliable big man.\n\n91. Dragan Bender - 9 games 2020. The former 4th overall pick completed two 10-day contracts with the Warriors at the end of this lost season. While certainly worth a look, Bender didn’t show much promise of reclamation during his time here.\n\n90. Cartier Martin - 10 games 2010. I remember I was in the building for Martin’s Warriors debut, because I remember not being able to figure out who he was. Getting cut after two 10-day contracts with the Dubs was the best thing that happened to his career, as he went on to sign with the Wizards and spent 3+ seasons as a key reserve for them.\n\n89. MarShon Brooks - 7 games 2014. Brooks arrived in the Jordan Crawford-for-Toney Douglas deal in January, then was included in the Kent Bazemore-for-Steve Blake deal a month later. In the meantime, he played 15 total minutes and scored 13 points with the Dubs.\n\n88. Charlie Bell - 19 games 2011. Bell arrived from Milwaukee in a deal for Corey Maggette, but didn’t see the court much before a DUI in February. He was waived with the amnesty provision after he showed up to his court hearing drunk. At the time, waiving Bell was criticized when they could have used the amnesty provision on Andris Biedrins, but Biedrins was involved as a dead contract in the Andre Iguodala deal so perhaps this was the right move after all.\n\n87. Kwame Brown - 9 games 2012. The former top pick in the draft, Brown was looking to shed his bust status when he signed a FA deal with the Warriors in 2011. But he only played until early January before shoulder surgery ended his season. He was then included in the Ellis-for-Bogut trade that spring as salary filler.\n\n86. Ish Smith - 6 games 2012. Smith has played for 11 total teams in his 10 year career, including a six-game stint with the Warriors in December 2011. He showed a few flashes of talent but was cut in mid-January of that year. Who knew then that he’d have a lengthy career and make more than $30 million in the NBA?\n\n85. Mychal Mulder - 7 games 2020. Among all the frantic signings the Warriors made in the aftermath of the 2020 trade deadline, Mulder seems like one that is likely to stick in the league. He averaged 11 points per game and was truly a major factor in wins over Philadelphia, Denver and Phoenix. Here’s hoping the Warriors find a way to keep him on the backend of the roster so this 7-game stretch doesn’t remain a footnote in the start of a decent career.\n\nRemember that Big Guy?\n\n84. Hilton Armstrong - 15 games 2014. First guy on this list who played real playoff minutes for the Dubs! Armstrong was initially called up from the D-league to join the big club because Festus Ezeli was still recovering from surgery and Jermaine O’Neal was banged up. He played some playoff minutes in the first-round loss to the Clippers because Andrew Bogut was also hurt. The former UConn star had a good run in what ended up being his final NBA season.\n\n83. Jeff Adrien - 23 games 2011. Speaking of former UConn stars, Adrien was an undrafted rookie who was waived after 15 appearances with the Dubs, then re-signed later in the campaign to finish off the year.\n\n82. Chris Hunter - 60 games 2010. The 6’11 center out of Michigan only played one year in the NBA and it was with the Dubs. Today he’s back with the Wolverines working for the basketball program.\n\n81. Ognjen Kuzmić - 37 games 2014-15. Kuz! It’s hard to complain about a late-2nd round pick that doesn’t pan out, so we won’t. Kuzmic picked up a double ring: with the Santa Cruz Warriors of the D-League, and the big club Warriors in 2015.\n\n80. Mikki Moore - 30 games 2010 & 2012. Moore had a decade-long career before arriving with the Warriors as a FA in 2009-10. He started 20 of the first 23 games of the season, then had surgery for bone spurs and was waived. He was then re-signed and finished his career with the Dubs by playing in the last seven games of the tankapalooza 2012 season.\n\n79. Dominic McGuire - 64 games 2012. The local favorite from Cal and Fresno State played double-digit minutes in almost every game of the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, averaging 3.5 points and 3.8 rebounds per game.\n\n78. Jeremy Tyler - 62 games 2012-13. We’re already at the seventh big man from the 2012 team alone on this list, and it hasn’t been a very impressive list. Tyler was a San Diego native but played internationally before he was drafted and traded to the Warriors in the 2011 draft. He showed tremendous strength and power as a rookie, but fell out of the rotation by his second year and was traded. Tyler was out of the NBA by 22 but is still playing professionally in Puerto Rico.\n\n77. Dan Gadzuric - 28 games 2011. Gadzuric arrived in Golden State in the Charlie Bell-for-Corey Maggette trade after a long career as a backup big in Milwaukee. But his higher impact on the Warriors came from how he left: Gadzuric was traded along with Brandan Wright in 2012 to the Nets for Troy Murphy (who was immediately bought out) and a future 2nd round pick that eventually became… Draymond Green!\n\n76. Jason Thompson - 28 games 2016. Thompson was a full-time starter for Sacramento through 2015, but ended up in Golden State via a series of complex trades when the Dubs shipped David Lee to Boston that offseason. There was an opening for Thompson to play minutes in Lee’s former rotation spot, but he didn’t seize the moment and was cut in February to make room for Anderson Varejao. After 7 years as a starting big, he was out of the league quickly after that subpar season.\n\n75. Alen Smailagić - 14 games 2020. Here’s hoping Smiley becomes a noteworthy contributor for the next phase of the Warriors. He has shown potential at times and clearly has the confidence to stick in the league, but at 19-years-old it’s impossible to say how he’ll look in his prime.\n\nRemember that Wing?\n\n74. Rodney Carney - 25 games 2011. The athletic wing Carney was a mid-first round pick by Philadelphia who got fans excited when he joined Golden State as a free agent, but he only lasted two plus months before getting cut. Two games with Memphis later, he was out of the league for good.\n\n73. Juan Toscano-Anderson - 13 games 2020. Like Smailagic above him, Toscano Anderson is just getting underway with his career. JTA has become a fan favorite already given his Oakland roots, so there’s hope among Dub Nation that he’ll stick around in some capacity next year.\n\n72. Devean George - 45 games 2010. The longtime Laker wing finished his career in Oakland in 2010 after being traded for Marco Belinelli. Famously, in the last game of that 2010 season, the Warriors had four players play the whole game: Steph Curry, Monta Ellis, Anthony Tolliver and Reggie Williams. George was the 5th guy on the court that day, playing all but five minutes in that game. And they won!\n\n71. Al Thornton - 22 games 2011. Count me among those truly surprised that Thornton didn’t stick in the league. He averaged double-digit points in his first three years in the league with the Clippers, and seemed like a sneaky good pickup by the Dubs when he was cut in Washington. Thornton finished out that season strong in a reserve role for the Warriors but only played internationally after that. He recently popped up in the Big 3.\n\n70. Omri Casspi - 53 games 2018. Casspi’s 3-point shootout with Steph made it seem like he’d be a perfect Warrior complimentary piece. But it sounds like he didn’t vibe with the group and was waived right at the end of the season to make room for Quinn Cook on the playoff roster.\n\n69. Richard Jefferson - 78 games 2012-13. RJ came over in a deal for Stephen Jackson in 2012, which also brought the Warriors the draft pick that became Festus Ezeli. He logged 22 games to close out that campaign and was back with the Dubs the following season, but in a much reduced role. Jefferson averaged only 10 minutes in the 2012-13 campaign, and might be best remembered for missing a few key free throws against the Spurs in the playoffs. Actually, at this point he’s probably best known for his resurgent play on the Cavs throughout the Golden State-Cleveland finals rivalry.\n\nRemember that Guard?\n\n68. Toney Douglas - 24 games 2014. Douglas seemed like a solid FA pickup in the 2013 offseason, filling the backup PG role vacated by Jarrett Jack. Douglas underperformed and was dealt midseason for Jordan Crawford who took over those minutes instead.\n\n67. Jeremy Lin - 29 games 2011. Much of the reason Linsanity was so miraculous in the spring of 2012 was because of how absolutely horrendous Lin had been up to that point. Lin didn’t just play sparingly with the Dubs in his rookie year, he shot dismal percentages. We were all initially excited to see the Palo Alto product make it onto the Warriors roster, but it was truly shocking to see his rise to fame that came after he left.\n\n66. Acie Law - 45 games 2010-11. Law will remain infamous in the minds of Warriors fans for getting closing minutes on Keith Smart’s Warriors over Steph Curry. Law was playing well at that time, but closing games over Steph was bizarre even at the time. Law had a short five game stint with the Dubs in 2009, then returned as a FA midway through 2010.\n\n65. Jacob Evans - 57 games 2019-20. Evans didn’t get much action in the 2018-19 season as the Dubs made a run to the finals, outside of garbage time and the occasional defensive lockdown possession. There was hope he’d play a bigger role in the 2020 season but it didn’t materialize and he was dealt to Minnesota in the Andrew Wiggins deal.\n\n64. Charles Jenkins - 98 games 2012-13. The Warriors 2nd round pick out of Hofstra was a true rotation piece as a rookie in 2012, averaging 17+ minutes per game. As the team improved and Jarrett Jack took most of the backup guard minutes, Jenkins’ time decreased and he was dealt at the 2013 deadline to get under the luxury tax. He has gone on to have a lengthy career in Europe.\n\n63. Ky Bowman - 45 games 2020. Bowman showed he belonged on the court as a fill-in once Curry went down this past season, and earned himself a 3-year (non-guaranteed) contract. I think most Warriors fans would be fully supportive of having Bowman around in 2021 and beyond as the third-string point guard, providing some energy off the bench.\n\n62. Jordan Poole - 57 games 2020. The Dubs first round draft pick last year picked up the pace toward the end of the season: in 13 games since February 5th he’s scored double digits in 12 of them, and the one he didn’t was the game when Steph returned. If Poole retains his shooting touch and offensive creativity he’ll be a fun bench piece for the Warriors moving forward.\n\nThe Search for a Starting Big\n\n61. Anderson Varejão - 36 games 2016-17. Varejao got the worst of both worlds in the Cavs vs. Warriors rivalry, losing both the 2015 and 2016 championships with each team. Fans will cringe at memories of Varejao playing in the 2016 finals, as he was a -9 in eight minutes played of Game 7, with three fouls. After 14 games of action in the following season, he was cut in favor of giving Briante Weber a look.\n\n60. Lou Amundson - 46 games 2011. Sweet Lou carved out a nice 10-year career with 10 different teams, including a stint with the Dubs in 2011. Amundson missed the first quarter of the season with a finger injury, but was impressive once he returned as a reserve big man. Following the lockout, he was traded in a savvy deal that brought Brandon Rush to town.\n\n59. Vladimir Radmanović - 107 games 2010-11. The Rad Man was a 6’10 wing who was probably ahead of his time. In the 2011 Warriors season he shot over 40% from 3-pt range, comparable to his prime years with the contending Lakers. For newer Dubs fans, one of his basketball-reference closest career comparisons is Jonas Jerebko, and I think that’s an accurate comparison.\n\n58. James Michael McAdoo - 108 games 2015-17. McAdoo was constantly bouncing back and forth from the G-League. And then all of a sudden, seemingly out of nowhere he was a prominent rotation player in the 2017 championship playoff run, playing 10+ minutes per game in some stretches as a rim runner. Beyond that, he saw plenty of garbage time action with the dominant Dubs teams who were frequently way ahead, so our memories of McAdoo are certainly fond.\n\n57. Anthony Tolliver - 44 games 2010. Tolliver played 30+ minutes on that bad 2010 Warriors team, averaging more than 12 points per game. He had brief NBA stints before that, but the Dubs were the team that gave Tolliver a real look, and he rose to the occasion. After that half-season in Golden State, he has gone on to build a 12-year career across 10 teams and has made more than $30 million in his career.\n\n56. Damian Jones - 49 games 2017-19. Jones was brought along slowly in his first two years in the league, picking up rings in the process while developing in 2017 and 2018. But when the Warriors started their youth movement among big men for the 2019 season, it would be up to Jones to run with the starters. That lasted for six weeks before Jones got hurt, missing the rest of the regular season. He returned in the conference finals for a few minutes, then made a cameo appearance against the Raptors in game 3 of the finals before getting traded in the offseason for…\n\n55. Omari Spellman - 49 games 2020. Spellman’s tenaciousness made a positive impression on Warriors fans last year, as he thrived as a scoring spark off the bench a la Mo Speights. He was unfortunately among those traded away for Andrew Wiggins, and at last check was toiling away with Minnesota’s G-league club. Dubs fans wouldn’t mind seeing a Spellman return down the line.\n\n54. Brandan Wright - 21 games 2011 (77 in previous decade). Wright was a lottery pick that the Warriors acquired on draft night in 2007 for Jason Richardson. For the purposes of this exercise, I’m only considering the time spent on the team during Steph’s reign, which for Wright was very brief. He missed the entire 09-10 season with a shoulder injury, and then was dealt to New Jersey in the 2011 deadline deal that returned the draft pick that became Draymond Green.\n\n53. Anthony Randolph - 33 games 2010 (63 in previous decade). Speaking of underperforming lanky Warriors big men… Randolph also made an appearance in that Nuggets vs. Warriors playoff series as a bench bigman. Randolph ended up as the primary young piece in a deal that landed the Warriors David Lee from the Knicks.\n\n52. Willie Cauley-Stein - 41 games 2020. Extra credit goes to WCS for taking less money to join the Warriors and be part of a culture of winning. Cauley-Stein started the year injured but looked strong once he debuted, solidifying a big man rotation albeit in a lost season. He was traded to Dallas and has a chance at his first playoff run if the season starts up again.\n\n51. Ekpe Udoh - 96 games 2011-12. Continuing a theme with the entries above… speaking of underperforming lanky Warriors big men? Udoh always had a strong defensive presence and was among the league leaders in blocks. The Dubs probably could have found better value with that 6th overall pick in 2010, but, like the other lottery picks of that era, Udoh was involved in a trade that would reshape the team for the dynastic run: he went to Milwaukee in the deal that brought Andrew Bogut to Oracle.\n\n50. Ronny Turiaf - 42 games 2010 (79 in previous decade). One of the other pieces given up in that David Lee trade was Turiaf, who gave the Dubs some much needed toughness in the middle, albeit with limited upside. In addition to playing 20+ minutes per game on some bad Warriors teams, he was a cheerleader of sorts and veteran leader even at a young age.\n\nYoung Guns & Hired Guns\n\n49. Alec Burks - 48 games 2020. Burks took full advantage of the scoring dearth left by Steph’s injury this season, as he ended up logging major minutes and averaging 16 PPG. If the season resumes, look for Burks to play a prominent bench role for the Sixers in the playoffs.\n\n48. Glenn Robinson - 48 games 2020. GRIII won over the fans in the Chase Center by playing tough defense every game & stating from the beginning that he was happy to be a Warriors and would love to return. He averaged the most points, minutes and rebounds with the Dubs and shot 40% from 3PT for the first time in his career. Based on his performances this year, it’s definitely still possible Robinson returns as a FA pickup in the offseason.\n\n47. Steve Blake - 28 games 2014. Ahh, those were the days, with the Warriors ascending and the Lakers trading off rotation players at the deadline. Blake went on to play ~20 minutes per game for the Dubs down the stretch as the backup PG and help secure the 6th seed. His scrappiness fit the team well and despite Kent Bazemore’s subsequent ascension as a starter-level player, this was a good trade.\n\n46. Jordan Crawford - 42 games 2014. Crawford was the other midseason acquisition in 2014, arriving in a multi-team deal for Toney Douglas. He became a spark plug of offense and essentially passed Blake on the depth chart by the playoffs. He also dropped 41 points in a meaningless game to wrap up the regular season vs. Denver.\n\n45. Marquese Chriss - 59 games 2020. The Chriss reclamation project was one of the best stories of the lost 2020 season. The core of the team encouraged management to keep Chriss around in training camp, and he proved them right, blossoming into a rim-running big that looks like he could be a starter in 2021. Moreover, Chriss may have successfully shed his bust label developed in Phoenix, and he’s still only 22 with room to grow.\n\n44. Damion Lee - 81 games 2019-20. Lee was a two-way player in the 2018-19 season, and did enough to prove that he wasn’t just around because of his relation to Steph. He can shoot! In 2019-20, he seized on the playing time openings and proved he’s a real asset in the NBA. Lee averaged 12.7 points and had moments where he was the go-to scorer for the Dubs throughout a game. Look for Lee to stick around for a while longer as a backup guard who earns his playing time.\n\nShoutout to the OGs & End-of-Decade Stars\n\n43. Kelenna Azubuike - 9 games 2010 (196 in previous decade). Kelenna is now fresh in Warriors’ fans' minds because he took over from Jim Barnett as the color commentator on TV broadcasts. He started as a rookie on the “We Believe” Warriors of 2006-07, and was in his 4th season when Steph arrived. Unfortunately, their run together only lasted nine games, as Azubuike injured his knee and missed the rest of that season. He returned to play for Dallas a year later but only played 3 more games.\n\n42. Stephen Jackson - 9 games 2010 (170 in previous decade). Jackson was obviously a star on the “We Believe” team, but like Azubuike only played nine games as a Warrior in the Curry era. Stack Jack was traded to Charlotte early on in the 2009-10 season after he requested a trade. Technically, Stack Jack made one more appearance in the Bay, when he was included in the Andrew Bogut-for-Monta Ellis deal from Milwaukee. The Dubs then shrewdly shipped him off to San Antonio for Richard Jefferson and the draft pick that would become Festus Ezeli.\n\n41. Andrew Wiggins - 12 games, 2020. I’m a big fan of the Wiggins trade and excited to see what he does as the 3rd/4th option on a good team. With only 12 games on the roster so far it would be hard to rate him much higher on this list, but the fanbase is definitely energized by his potential role on the team. Here’s a trivia question: Steph Curry was a 7th-overall pick, how many players has he played with that were drafted that high or higher? (Answer: 10. Durant, Livingston, Bogut, Cousins, D-Lo, Wiggins, Bender, Kwame, Cauley-Stein, Udoh)\n\n40. D'Angelo Russell - 33 games 2020. The Warriors did well to end up with Russell when Durant bolted for Brooklyn. D-Lo was an energetic scorer in a lost season and seemed to vibe well off the court with Dub Nation. The on-court fit with Curry and Klay wouldn’t have been ideal, so a swap for Wiggins and a very high draft pick could turn out to be much better value. Only time will tell. My D’Lo “Ice” bobblehead may seem like a very random keepsake within a few years.\n\n39. C.J. Watson - 65 games 2010 (109 in previous decade). Watson arrived in the 2007-08 season via 10-day contracts, but by the time Steph arrived for the 09-10 season, Watson was an established Warrior, averaging more than 10 points per game for his career high. He’s currently playing in the “Big 3” league, though the most notable discussion of Watson came recently when Conor McGregor wore his jersey to troll Floyd Mayweather (look it up!).\n\n38. Matt Barnes - 20 games 2017 (149 in previous decade). We all remember Barnes as a key contributor to the We Believe squad, but he also showed up for the final month of the 2017 season to fill in at the 3 when Kevin Durant got injured. He filled in admirably and then took a back seat when Durant returned, but still appeared periodically in the playoffs to pick up a well-deserved championship ring to close out his career.\n\n37. Corey Maggette - 70 games 2010 (51 in previous decade). Before the recent playoff run, seeing the Warriors sign legitimate free agents like Corey Maggette just never happened. In the aftermath of the We Believe team though, Golden State started to seem like more of a compelling organization. Maggette may have been an early-adopter to signing with the Dubs, paving the way for signings like David Lee, Shaun Livingston and Kevin Durant in the years to follow. He had averaged 22 PPG with the Clippers before signing, then averaged about 19 PPG in his two years with the Dubs.\n\n36. Anthony Morrow - 69 games 2010 (67 in previous decade). Morrow led the league in 3 PT shooting percentage (46.7%) as a rookie with the Dubs in 2008-09, and continued that sharpshooting throughout his career. Morrow averaged 13 PPG for the 09-10 team and was a classic Warriors-style player. Maybe Steph picked up some form tips in his early days from one of the team’s sharpest shooters?\n\n35. Reggie Williams - 104 games 2010-11. Did you remember that Reggie Williams averaged 15 points per game in 2009-10? Reggie Williams! In Steph’s rookie season, Williams was signed for the final third of the season and was immediately thrust into the rotation on a bad team, and into loyal Warriors fans’ hearts. Williams played 36+ minutes in the second game of his career, and played 40+ minutes in eight of his first 24 career games. He then gave it another go for the 2010-11 warriors, averaging 9 points in 20+ minutes per game as a bench scorer.\n\nFan Favorites\n\n34. Nate Robinson - 51 games 2012. Robinson signed a few weeks after the lockout season got underway, joining a Warriors team that was going nowhere fast and immediately sparking the offense. Nate played 30+ minutes in 3 of his first 4 games with the Dubs, and was good for at least one hot shooting night every few days to fire up the crowds while Steph Curry was out due to injury.\n\n33. Justin Holiday - 59 games 2015. Holiday had only played nine NBA games when he signed with the Dubs to fill out the roster in 2014-15. But by Christmas, he had established himself as a reliable bench contributor and we were all rooting for him as a completely unlikely contributor as the 11th man on a title team. Holiday has gone on to build a solid career as a reliable scoring threat and basically a full-time starter for the Bulls in the last two seasons before moving to Indiana’s bench this year.\n\n32. Patrick McCaw- 128 games 2017-18. Three-time world champion Patrick McCaw had a tumultuous end to his Warriors career, declining to sign a new deal in 2018 and eventually spending a week in Cleveland before settling with the Raptors. But in his two seasons with the Dubs, he got more run than you might remember. He averaged 15 minutes per game as a rookie and 17 minutes in year 2. In the 2017 playoffs, he played 34+ minutes in a first-round game and 26+ minutes and 18 points in the Western Conference finals! In 2018, he was just starting to establish himself as a key rotation piece before a scary injury against the Kings, then returned for limited minutes in the finals.\n\n31. Alfonzo McKinnie - 72 games 2019. In retrospect, it might have made more sense to keep Danuel House, or Kendrick Nunn, with the final roster spot in 2018-19, given what those other non-roster invitees went on to achieve in the subsequent seasons. But McKinnie was unquestionably an instant success with the Dubs, showing unexpected strength as a rebounder and as a wing shooter. McKinnie averaged 14 minutes per game and became a reliable part of the rotation, extending all the way into the finals. Coming in to 2020 he was expected to return and possibly start at the 3, but was cut in favor of Marquese Chriss.\n\n30. Jonas Jerebko - 73 games 2019. Jerebko delighted Dubs fans early on with a tip-in win at the buzzer in Utah, and continued to contribute throughout the 2018-19 campaign. He signed with a Euro League team after the season, so he may have decided to end his NBA career on a relative high note with a trip to the finals.\n\n29. Nick Young - 80 games 2018. Swaggy P! Signing Young with the mid-level exception for the 2017-18 season seemed like a luxury purchase. A team that already had nearly everything it needed in a ‘17 title run decided to add one more shooter to leverage the open space the Warriors offense created. Swaggy took that and ran with it, hitting six 3-pointers in his first game as a Warrior and never turning back. He played double digit minutes including in various playoff series and the finals, as Durant and Curry found plenty of opportunities to make use of Young’s shooting abilities. And his entertaining personality was a welcome sight that always kept fans guessing.\n\n28. Jordan Bell - 125 games 2018-19. Dubs fans were incredibly excited by Jordan Bell’s arrival as a second round pick in the 2017 draft. Bell’s athleticism jumped off the page and he brought a new energy to the team. He often ended up in Steve Kerr’s dog house for unforced mistakes, but he was undoubtedly an important cog in the rotation for the past two years. Bell played double digit minutes in the finals against the Cavs in 2018 and started Game 1 vs. Toronto last year.\n\n27. Eric Paschall - 60 games 2020. Paschall was the surprise of the 2019-20 season, quickly showing that he was a 2nd-round steal in the draft. Paschall led the team in points and games played and looks capable of being a solid defender as well. Fans are excited about having him as a rotation player for years to come.\n\n26. Kent Bazemore - 105 games 2013-14. Bazemore, admittedly, barely played for the Dubs, averaging 2.1 points per game in 5 minutes over his first two seasons in the league. But his role as bench cheerleader during those seasons is immortalized in highlights everywhere, and he is unquestionably a Warriors legend for that. Very glad that he went on to get paid handsomely, and if he becomes cheaper it’d be interesting to see if the Dubs target him with a mid-level or minimum contract to fill out the roster next year.\n\n25. DeMarcus Cousins - 30 games 2019. Boogie’s signing with the Dubs was a quintessential moment of the dynasty – a luxury signing of one of the best players in the league, with complete freedom to give him the time to rehab. He averaged 16+ points in his regular season action with the Dubs, then got hurt in the first round of the playoffs against the Clippers. Ironically, by the end of the finals, Cousins was one of the few healthy bodies remaining, and was a needed source of scoring and toughness to keep the Dubs alive. His double-double in Game 2 of the finals against Toronto was essential, and he played major crunch time minutes to secure a game 5 win after Durant got hurt.\n\n24. Quinn Cook - 107 games 2018-19. Cook started the 2017-18 season as a two-way player, and played only sparingly through the All-Star break that season. But with Steph injured down the stretch of that season, Cook played 30+ minutes down the stretch and forced the Dubs to cut Omri Casspi to keep him around on the playoff roster. He then went on to play significant minutes in the first two rounds of those playoffs before Steph returned to form. Cook returned in 2018-19 and was a reliable reserve, averaging 40% on 3-PT shots and scoring the 4th most points of anyone on the team, behind only Steph, Klay and Durant.\n\n23. Brandon Rush - 172 games 2012-13, 2015-16. Rush seemed like a perfect wing fit for the Warriors upon joining in the 2011-12 season. He shot 45% from 3PT range, 50% FG overall, and played in every game but one. However, the following year he blew out his ACL on the 2nd game of the season and ended up included as dead salary in the trade to acquire Andre Iguodala. Rush was back after one year though, re-signing for two more years. In the 2015 season he completely lost his shooting form and fell out of the rotation, but he was back to his normal self by 2016 as a 41% 3 PT shooter.\n\n22. Festus Ezeli - 170 games 2013, 2015-16. It is still crazy to me that Ezeli hasn’t played a minute in the NBA since the 2016 Finals. Knee problems caused him to never actually suit up for Portland and retire at age 27. Before that, he built up quite the storied career in just 3 seasons with the Dubs. Ezeli started half of the 2012-13 season at center as a rookie when Andrew Bogut was hurt, and even started some games alongside Bogut in the playoffs that year against a bulky Spurs team. He missed the following season due to injury, but was back as a contributor on the 2015 championship team, and despite some flubs in the 2016 finals he was an important presence on the roster.\n\n21. Dorell Wright - 143 games 2011-12. Wright was one of the only things to write home about on the 2010-11 Warriors. He led the league in 3 pointers (with only 194! Steph has topped that seven times since), and was top-10 in the league in steals and minutes played. That turned out to be the bright spot of his career; his minutes dropped on a stronger Dubs team the following season and then he was traded in a three-way deal for Jarrett Jack.\n\n20. Ian Clark - 143 games 2016-17. Dubs fans weren’t sure who would replace Justin Holiday’s end-of-the-bench minutes after the 2015 title, but Clark fit nicely into that role in 2015-16. And then on the 2016-17 team, he stepped his game up, nearly doubling his minutes and scoring. On a team that was arguably the most talented team of the century, the Warriors top six scorers were Curry, Durant, Thompson, Draymond, Iguodala… and Ian Clark.\n\n19. JaVale McGee - 142 games 2017-18. What a wild, enjoyable experience it was to have JaVale on the Dubs for two years. His above-the-rim game added a new element to the team, and he became the perfect dunking attacker for Draymond Green’s passing prowess. He shed his label as misfit and revitalized his career with the Dubs. Fans loved him. He only played 10 minutes per game, but did that consistently and it led to two titles.\n\n18. Zaza Pachulia - 139 games 2017-18. The yin to JaVale’s yang was Zaza, and together they formed a completely solid center rotation. Between the two of them they covered more than half the game at the 5, with the rest filled by smaller lineups with Draymond or David West. Zaza was the starter so he gets the nod over JaVale here -- he bought in and became the reliable big man they needed to replace Andrew Bogut. These days, Zaza is back with the Dubs working in the front office.\n\n17. Jermaine O'Neal - 44 games 2014. Here’s a great Sports Illustrated article that digs into O’Neals impact on the Warriors more than I can. His impact was much more than the half season of stats he accumulated as a reliable big man. JO believed in the Warriors and helped mentor guys like Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes to become the best they could be, and that drove them to a championship the following season.\n\n16. Carl Landry - 81 games 2013. Before O’Neal, there was Landry. The veteran big man providing much needed stability to the Warriors burgeoning young core. Landry played major minutes and sometimes even closed games for the 2013 team. He started off as the leading scorer in his first game as a Warrior, coming off the bench to outscore Curry, Thompson and All-Star David Lee. With Bogut hurt for much of the regular season, Landry was an essential big man and there’s no way the Dubs reach as high as the 6th seed without him. He was also huge in the playoff upset of Denver, scoring 19 and 17 points in games 3 and 4, and was in double figures in four of the six games against San Antonio.\n\n15. Jarrett Jack - 79 games 2013. Landry was an essential member of the 2013 team, but in many ways Jack was the closer of that team. Curry was clearly reaching an All-Star level by this time, but Jack had swagger, confidence and bravado that helped bring Curry to new levels. With the clock running down that season, the ball was often in Jack’s hands, and more often than not, he delivered. He was among the league’s best players off the bench that year, averaged 40% from 3 PT range, and his high assist numbers allowed Steph and Klay to flourish off the ball. Who can forget his dime to Draymond to beat the mighty LeBron-Wade Heat?\n\nThe Countdown Begins\n\n14. Andris Biedriņš - 192 games 2010-13 (318 in previous decade). Beans was essentially a lifelong Warrior – he played only six games for Utah after he was dealt in the Iguodala trade. On the “We Believe” teams, he was a valuable rim protector as the starting center. Right around the time Steph arrived, however, his free throw shooting fell off a cliff. That made it harder to play him big minutes, but at the end of the day, Andris played nine seasons as a Warrior and that’s an eternity in the modern NBA -- and that’s all before he was 27 years old! I loved that Steph gave him a tribute as one of the GOATs of Oracle.\n\n13. Kevon Looney - 224 games 2016-20. Looney’s career has been a roller coaster because of injuries. He only played a few games in his rookie year in 2016. In 2017, he started to get more action but missed the entire playoffs with an injury. And this past year in 2020 he missed at least two thirds of the season with various ailments. But it’s impossible to say that the Warriors win their championship in 2018 without Looney’s defensive contributions, especially in the 2018 conference finals against Houston. And in 2019, he played almost every game and was the most reliable big on the roster, and sucked it up through what looked like excruciating shoulder pain to play great minutes in the finals against Toronto. Here’s hoping he’s healthy again for next year.\n\n12. Leandro Barbosa - 134 games 2015-16. The Blur! Barbosa brought so much firepower to the offense on the 2014-15 championship team and again for the 73-9 team in 2015-16. Just as Steve Kerr arrived and encouraged more ball movement and a fast pace, the addition of Barbosa’s speed and herky-jerky offensive style became the perfect asset. He averaged 6.7 PPG in his two seasons with the Dubs and shot 37% from 3 PT, but I’ll most remember his ability to get to the basket and provide scoring for the bench units.\n\n11. Marreese Speights - 227 games 2014-16. Mo’ Buckets was the Warriors “stretch 5” on the ‘14, ‘15 and ‘16 teams, and if this were a ranking of purely fan adoration, Speights would be even higher. Speights only shot 33% from 3 PT range as a Warrior but he was very solid from the mid-range. If you chose to double-team Klay or Steph on a pick, that left Mo wide open for a jumper, and he seemingly knocked them all down. His most historical moment with the Dubs will probably end up being the end-of-game rebound against the Pelicans, dishing to Steph for the game winning 3 PT shot over Anthony Davis.\n\n10. Monta Ellis - 181 games 2010-12 (232 in previous decade). Monta is a Warriors, he’s always gonna be a Warriors. The fans nearly revolted when Monta was traded in the deal for Andrew Bogut -- put aside for a moment the fact that that trade worked out for the Dubs in the end, and realize that Ellis really captured the respect and adoration of Dub Nation. In Steph’s rookie year, Monta averaged 25.5 points, then 24.1 the following season. He led the league in minutes played both of those years and absolutely left it all on the court. Side note: Monta made nearly $100 million in his playing career, and because of the stretch provision, Monta’s still getting paid by the Pacers for another two years, so I think this all worked out for him too. And hey, if he hadn’t gotten hurt in his motorcycle accident in 2007-08, would the Dubs have been bad enough to get a high draft pick and select Curry? Monta was a Warriors legend.\n\n9. David West - 141 games 2017-18. West was a two-time all-star as Chris Paul’s running mate in New Orleans, then a key cog in the Indiana team that contended in the middle of the decade. So when he signed with the Dubs on a vet minimum deal, it was a steal of a deal. West respected the Warriors culture and was searching for a ring. And he got two of them! West’s minutes and stat contributions were often sparse (in his first year he only scored more than 10 points once in a game) but he made the most of his time on the court. Lineups with West in them had stellar numbers, and his leadership and toughness was well regarded.\n\n8. Harrison Barnes - 307 games 2013-16. Harry B’s resume: founding member of the death lineup, starter on a championship squad, first-team all-rookie, and every now and then would bust out a thunderous dunk to show off his crazy athleticism. Barnes’ best year came in 2015, when he played all 82 games and was a top-20 most efficient shooter in the league. He rarely turned the ball over, and for a high lottery pick he accepted his complementary role smoothly.\n\n7. David Lee - 327 games 2011-15. The original “D-Lee” was the first Warriors All-Star in nearly two decades. That’s right -- it was Lee who made the ASG in 2013 over Curry (Steph made it every year since until this year’s injury). But more importantly, it was Lee signing with the Dubs as a free agent in 2010 that raised expectations and gave the fanbase some hope. Lee was coming off an All-Star season with the Knicks where he averaged 20 and 11, then came west to boost a team that had Steph and little else to brag about. Over the next few years, he became a fan favorite, a team leader, a table mate with Steph on the plane, and of course a world champ. Despite getting usurped by Draymond in the lineup in 2015 due to injury, Lee recovered and played great minutes down the stretch and in the finals to earn his ring.\n\n6. Shaun Livingston - 367 games 2015-19. Livingston had bounced around the NBA following his knee injury, but looked revitalized in Brooklyn in 2014 and signed with the Dubs just in time for the championship run. He played the same consistent role every year for 5 years: 15-20 minutes per game off the bench, solid defense, and always good for a few smooth-looking baseline jumpers per game. On a team of shooters, he only hit three 3’s in five years, and one of them was an attempted alley-oop that went in. Instead he made a living making what seemed like every turnaround jumper. Livingston’s role in the recent dynasty will be one that’s very hard to replicate.\n\n5. Andrew Bogut - 247 games 2013-16, 19. Much of what the Warriors did within Steve Kerr’s offense isn’t possible without Bogut, who set the stage with monster screens and expert passing to get Steph and Klay open regularly. He arrived late in the 2012 season while injured, then missed more than half of the following year before regaining health in February of 2013. That year in the playoffs he was dominant, pulling down 21 rebounds in the series clincher against Denver. He got injured again and missed the 2014 playoffs which was a big reason why the Dubs couldn’t take down the Clippers that year. As noted he was a huge part of the flow of the offense in 2015, until game 4 of the Finals when the Death Lineup arrived in full force to take down the Cavs. In 2016, Bogut dropped slimmed down and was solid all year on the 73 win team, then got hurt in game 5 of the Finals which obviously left them shorthanded in that series loss. After bouncing around the league and retreating to Australia, Bogut came back to the Dubs for the last month of the 2019 season and even started a few games in the playoffs.\n\n4. Kevin Durant - 208 games 2017-19. Two-time finals MVP, sure-fire hall-of-famer, a complete game-changing player on both ends and obviously he totally reshaped the dynasty when he arrived for the 2017 season. There’s no question he was Curry’s best teammate, and is only this low because he was only around for the second half of the championship run. There are too many accolades from his Warriors reign to mention, but let’s take a quick retrospective on KD’s Dubs career: 52% FG, 38% 3PT, 88% FT, nearly 26 PPG, and noticeably better in all those categories in the playoffs, plus some career defining dagger 3 PT shots against Lebron. And of course, putting aside all the speculation and drama, he fought hard to come back for the finals against Toronto and looked incredible before he got hurt again. What a run it was.\n\n3. Andre Iguodala - 413 games 2014-19. The inspiration for this post was watching the 2013 playoff series vs. Denver, and it was frankly bizarre to watch Iguodala in a Denver jersey at that time. After watching him for six years on the Dubs he feels as core of a member of this group as any. In his first year, Iggy started every game he played, then moved to a bench role once Steve Kerr took the helm. That same year he became the finals MVP, minimizing Lebron’s impact in the finals. Iggy was the defensive wizard of the Dubs dynasty, the key cog of the Death Lineup and the Hamptons 5 that took them to new heights, not to mention the de facto backup point guard to start the offense and make key passes to the Splash Bros. Andre had his fair share of clutch moments too and will go down as a Warriors legend.\n\n2. Draymond Green - 576 games 2013-20. On the defensive side alone, Draymond is a one-time NBA defensive player of the year, five straight years of all-defense 1st or 2nd team, and is the active leader in “Defensive Box Plus/Minus” -- he’s also 4th all-time in that stat. He also spent three straight years in the top 10 of the league in assists, was a three-time all-star, and of course a three-time NBA champ. Dray’s court vision and situational awareness is at an impeccable level that allows him and the Dubs to switch defensively and cover lots of ground. His versatility to guard all five positions makes the death lineup possible, and his aggression balances out well with Steph and Klay’s playing styles and personalities. It is crazy to think that next year will be Draymond’s ninth season with the Dubs.\n\n1. Klay Thompson - 615 games 2012-19. Steph’s running mate and fellow Splash Brother Klay gets the top spot on this list. He has been the model of consistency throughout his career. Play two-thirds of the game, play incredible defense on the other team’s best guard, knock down 40% plus of your threes. He has the NBA record for most points in a quarter, the record for most three pointers in a game, most three pointers in a playoff game, and by the end of next season he may be in the top 10 all-time in 3’s. Memorably, he saved the Dubs from the jaws of defeat with an epic game 6 in OKC in 2016, and has dozens of other heroic playoff shooting moments. If Klay doesn’t get hurt in the final game last year against the Raptors, it seems likely they at least stretch that series to a 7th game. Beyond that, there’s China Klay, Rocco & Klay, Scaffolding Klay, Reporter Klay and more examples of how he endeared himself to fans."
