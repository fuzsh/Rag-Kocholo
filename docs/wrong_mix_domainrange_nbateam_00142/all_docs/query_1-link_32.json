PRESENT (LeBRON, KD, Warriors)\n\nMy specialty = attributes & tendencies\n\nI suck at sculpting faces, so most of them are from YouTube\n\n(Tgor, BryanDfor3, Thirty8Spesh - MrGriptight, freno, horusgrant, MJWizards, ...),\n\nthe rest are 'Head Presets' from the CAP menu.\n\nIf you want to know or see how I got my attributes and tendencies PM me and I can send you some .txt-files from a certain player, (they have additional info on how I 'calculated' all the ratings). I also have .txt-files from Rashidi's player ratings (2K2 -> 2K8) found on GameFAQ (I think) for anyone interested. Other attributes and tendencies are from SonicMage combined with 3 or 4 MyTeam players with simular playing style.\n\nLast edited by gu8lal8; 10-21-2017 at 06:04 AM.\n\nRookie\n\nOVR: 1\n\nJoin Date: Aug 2006\n\nLocation: Belgium - Europe\n\nRe: NBA 2K Completed Classic Teams\n\natlplayboy23 & STLRams updated the roster with vannwolfhawk playbooks\n\nNext update\n\nSpoiler\n\nHow to setup your Classic Teams MyLeague\n\nSpoiler\n\nThis year there is a 14 players minimum per team if you want to play a MyLeague, that is also the reason we didn't delete the cpu generated 'John Smiths' from the FA pool, that way you have low rated players to fill out teams that don't have 14 players.\n\nThis is why I advice everybody who starts/started a MyLeague with the classic teams to:\n\n1. use all user controlled teams and turn salary cap/trades/trade logic off\n\n2. turn team chemistry off, this will give you the feeling of dynamic ratings in MyLeague, every players overall rating will be different from game to game\n\n3. check every team that doesn't have this years 14 minimum required players because the cpu will automatically fill out teams with less than 14 players with a random FA from the rosters FA pool\n\n4. replace the random cpu signings with one of the low rated cpu generated 'John Smiths', pick one that will the lowest rated player on that team or give him a season ending injury, the idea is these players need to get 0 playing time\n\nAbout TENDENCIES\n\nSpoiler\n\nThey are still the same, but what I did do when I created a player is I kept backing in and out untill I got someone who played the position and second position I was looking for, so tendencies should be decent but still need alot of work(*) (I'm working on tendencies for created starters ATM), also with the new tendencies 2k added I still have to figure those out, I'll have to do some testing so it might take awhile...\n\nAt this point I think it's useless to determine detailed tendencies for players that barely got playing time (maybe edit their shot/freelance/defensive&foul tendencies using SonicMage's work), but to focus on starters and key bench players, for these guys I'm gonna try to determine every single tendency but like I said it's gonna be a long process and alot of testing, even watching CPU vs CPU 12min qtr games (IMO the best tendency test).\n\n(*) This is how tendencies are ATM for 2000-2016 created players, I don't know how MJWizards did his.\n\nNBA 2K17 Completed Classic Teams Project\n\nSpoiler\n\nNBA 2K17 Completed Classic Teams Project (PS4) by MJWizards (PS4) [Online ID: crazyh16]\n\nNBA 2K17 Historic Teams Expansion by gu8lal8 (PS4) [Online ID: GUMO73]\n\nBAMProctor and Yellowfeverpr like this.\n\nLast edited by gu8lal8; 06-02-2019 at 03:23 AM."
