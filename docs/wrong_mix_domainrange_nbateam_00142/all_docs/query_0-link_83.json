        "text": "Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports\n\nA good ol' fashioned skirmish broke out between the Indiana Pacers and Golden State Warriors on Tuesday night at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\n\nPacers center Roy Hibbert was ejected after throwing Warriors point guard Stephen Curry to the floor during the altercation in a contentious fourth quarter. Teammate David West also appeared to get physical with Curry.\n\nCurry, West, David Lee and Klay Thompson all received technicals.\n\nThe fight broke out when Hibbert and Lee got into a shoving match. It spilled over into the crowd on the sideline.\n\nMarc Spears of Yahoo! Sports noted:\n\nLooks like Hibbert started it all. Doesn't look good for Hibbert and West.\n\n— Marc J. Spears (@SpearsNBAYahoo) February 27, 2013\n\nMarcus Thompson of Bay Area News Group added:\n\nDavid West came very close to throwing a punch ... he at the very least mushed Andris' Biedrins\n\n— Marcus Thompson (@gswscribe) February 27, 2013\n\nThere will likely be suspensions and/or fines that result from the skirmish, particularly because it spilled over into the front row of the crowd.\n\nThe Pacers went on to win the game 108-97, holding off some pressure from Golden State led by Curry. The Pacers had a 10-point lead with six minutes, nine seconds remaining before the altercation.\n\nIndiana led the league in points allowed per game (89.4) headed into Tuesday's contest, boasting some physical frontcourt players like Hibbert and West. It got out of hand down the stretch, and the club is hoping there aren't significant penalties as the Pacers look to catch the Miami Heat for the Eastern Conference's No. 1 seed.\n\nThe Warriors' three-game winning streak was snapped in the loss."
