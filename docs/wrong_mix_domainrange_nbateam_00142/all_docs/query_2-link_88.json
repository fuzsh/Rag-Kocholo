        "text": "Tag Archives: nba\n\nA Simple Look at the Miami Heat (iSportsLife’s 100th Post)\n\nThe Miami Heat might be the team that is talked about the most, but it’s because they are an exceptional team to watch. This past season was their 25th in the league after being created as an expansion team in 1988. Since then, they have won the Championship three times, the Eastern Conference four times and the Southeast Division 10 times with a total of 6 coaches. With the 2012-13 season, they wrapped up their second straight NBA Championship (third straight trip to the Finals). Let’s take a closer look at this Miami Heat team and see how and why they are as successful as they are….You’re probably thinking, “Well, they are the Miami cHeat” and to you I say, “Stop it!”\n\nThe “Big Three”:\n\nDwyane Wade:\n\nThe Face of the Miami Heat. Besides Wade, the only other Miami Heat greats are Glen Rice, Tim Hardaway, Rony Seiklay, Steve Smith, Keith Askins, Grant Long, Eddie Jones, Alonzo Mourning, Shaquille O’Neal, Udonis Haslem. That might seem like a lot, but compared to the Lakers or Celtics who have always had greats, the list is pretty short. Nonetheless, none of the other Heat greats have achieved what Wade achieved in the ten years he has been in the league. Wade has seen and done it all; He has played among the likes of Gary Payton, James Posey, Alonzo Mourning, Shaq and even Michael Beasley, Michael Doleac, Wayne Siemen and even Yabhouka Diawara. Wade was one of the most explosive players a few years ago (went by the name of Flash, as dubbed by Shaq), but realized with his string of injuries, he was not going to win the ring by himself. Wade was also one of the reasons LeBron James and Chris Bosh took their talents to South Beach. Without Pat Riley drafting Wade, the Heat probably wouldn’t have 3 rings by now. Even if LeBron James stays in Miami longer than Wade, Mr. WOW or 3, whatever you want to call him, will always be the face of the Miami Heat.\n\nWhat’s Step: While Wade is constantly hampered by injuries, Heat fans can always expect him to bounce back better. Nonetheless, I think Wade should see the mystical doctor from Germany, who has gotten visits from multiple NBA players. Then, if he were to develop his midrange shot this summer, it would add to his arsenal plus it would help him stay healthy and help the with with LeBron down low.\n\nLeBron James:\n\nAfter enduring 7 longs years of achieving nothing, James realized the Cavs approach of one man ball was not going to beat the Big Three from Beantown. After taking his talents to South Beach, he has already racked up two MVPs, two Championship Rings, two Finals MVPs and multiple All Star appearances. Miami might be Dwyane Wade’s, but the Heat are LeBron’s team now. Wade gave up the driver’s seat to James, who has fully embraced the challenge. Even when the other players aren’t as helpful at times, James steps it up whether it’s by scoring, passing or making the right play. At the start of games, LeBron gets the ball. With the game on the line, LeBron gets the ball. LeBron is the Heat’s scorer, passer, rebounder, stealer, blocker as he can do it all. Without James, the Heat wouldn’t be a strong team. But, without the Heat, James wouldn’t be as amazing either. Obviously he can’t do it alone, but that’s where James shines bright. His chemistry and bond with Bosh and Wade are not measurable.\n\nWhat’s Next: Don’t change. 3-Peat. Another MVP.\n\nChris Bosh:\n\nOnce a double-double machine, Bosh sacrificed it all to be the third wheel of the Big Three. Even though Bosh is constantly getting mocked by the doubters, without him, the Heat wouldn’t go very far. Bosh’s style of play allows James and Wade to roam and choose where and how to play. Bosh can make the midrange shot and the occasional three pointer which allows Wade and James to drive in. Bosh is the perfect complementary piece to Wade and James. Looking back. if the Heat would have chose Boozer or Stoudamire instead of Bosh, it wouldn’t have looked pretty. Bosh is equally important as James or Wade on this team. Barring a trade or amnesty, I believe Bosh will retire a Heat and eventually end up among the Heat greats. Bosh also does the little things to help the Heat in big ways. Without his offensive rebound in Game 6, the Heat would not be back-to-back champions. Even though he didn’t score in game 7, his defense on the Spurs was pivotal in the win. Out of all the Heat players, I respect Bosh the most. He is constantly getting ridiculed, but even then he stands tall and proud.\n\nWhat’s Next: Stand tall and proud. Maybe, bulk up?\n\nThe Little 12:\n\nRest of the Starters:\n\nMario Chalmers:\n\nI wish I had the confidence of Rio. In all of the NBA, Mario might be the most confident player, but he is not cocky. But the confidence is warranted as he has always been a winner. He has won titles at the high school, college and professional levels. He has stepped it up when his team needed the most. His Jayhawks beat Derrick Rose’s Memphis Tigers as Chalmers hit the three pointer to sent the game to overtime. In the playoffs last year and this year, he has stepped it up when the Heat seem down. Drafted the same year as Michael Beasley, the Heat’s second pick of the 2008 draft, Rio has more hardware. Of course, Beasley has been a disappointment. But, Rio has certainly matured a lot more. Plus, he is the Big Three’s little brother as he is constantly taking their yelling.\n\nWhat’s Next: Try to stay consistent. Be Mario Chalmers, not Wario Chalmers.\n\nUdonis Haslem:\n\nMr. 305. Born and raised in Miami, attended the University of Florida, and now plays for the Miami Heat. As Wade is the face of the Miami Heat, Udonis is the heart and soul of the Heat. Even though Haslem averaged career lows in points, rebounds, blocks per game, his effort and hustle is his most important features. Haslem is willing to do the dirty work; he is willing to punch someone for his fellow teammates. His hustle, tenacity, grit on the court has definitely helped the Heat. Him and Shane Battier are constantly trying to draw charges.\n\nWhat’s Step: Try to get the midrange game going again.\n\nKey Players off the Bench:\n\nRay Allen:\n\nThe Miami Heat can thank Danny Ainge and Rajon Rondo for Jesus Shuttlesworth coming to South Beach. The “feud” between the Celtics point guard and Ray Allen ultimately led Allen to take his talents to South Beach. After years of shooting the three pointers for the Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle Supersonics, Boston Celtics, his biggest three pointer is the one that allowed him to get his second championship. Ray Allen opted in for another year in South Beach. While he wasn’t consistent, he stepped it up when the Heat needed him. The three point against the Spurs in game 6 with 5.2 seconds left was the cherry on the top. He was brought to Miami to hit these shots, and he certainly did.\n\nWhat’s Next: Keep making it rain.\n\nShane Battier:\n\nBattier is a player that every coach wishes he had. The glue guy for the Heat. Although he doesn’t do big things for the Heat, they don’t require him since they have the Big Three for big plays. But, Battier does all of the little things for the Heat. Whether it’s hustling for loose balls, defending taller or stronger guys, he does the little things which ultimately put the Heat in a position to win games. Battier was a wreck in the playoffs this year, but stepped it up in a big fashion in game seven. Yet, he still managed to affect games with his hustle and determination.\n\nWhat’s Next: Nothing. He’s doing all the right things.\n\nNorris Cole:\n\nHe’s been in the league for two years and already, he’s gotten two championships. Spoiled, much? Even though his playing time varies game to game, he always seems confident in his game. But his biggest contribution for the Heat is his defense and energy off the bench. While the other players seem tired and worn out, Cole brings a ton of energy while defending opposing guards.\n\nWhat’s Next: Make smart plays, take smart shots, make others better by making yourself better.\n\nChris Andersen:\n\nPossibly the greatest midseason pickup for last season, Andersen fit well with the Heat even with thousands of tattoos and his mohawk. Birdman (Birdman) was big during the playoffs, as he also brought energy and hustle to the Heat. I credit Cole and Andersen as the energizer bunnies of the Heat bench.\n\nWhat’s Next: Andersen re-signed with the Heat for one more year. He will continue to do what he does best, block shots, flap his arms and score/rebound.\n\nMike Miller:\n\nAiling Miller ALWAYS hits timely shots. Whether it’s a ton of three pointers against the Thunder in game 5 or one three pointer without his shoes against the Spurs, Miller knows when he has to rise to the challenge. This was exactly why he was signed in 2010 by Riley. While he doesn’t get much playing time, he is always ready to hit the three.\n\nWhat’s Next: A potential amnesty candidate. If he isn’t amnestied, he will play more as Wade will rest more to prep for the post-season.\n\nRole Players\n\nRashard Lewis:\n\nWhen he found out Ray Allen was going to the Heat, Lewis also packed his bags and came to the Heat. Even though he didn’t play much, he still contributed every now and then with his timely three pointers and rebounds.\n\nWhat’s Next: Lewis will be a bigger contributor to the Heat next season as they will look to rest Bosh and LeBron more as they get ready to three-peat.\n\nJames Jones:\n\nAnother Mr 305. Jones has a similar story to Udonis, except Jones doesn’t play as much. While he doesn’t play regular minutes, he is always ready. In blowouts, when Coach Spo puts him in the last 3 minutes of the game, he makes at least one three.\n\nWhat’s Next: Jones will stay with the Heat as long as possible. While he was ready to retire after the Heat beat the Thunder in 2012 Finals, he re-signed for a chance to repeat and now, he wants to three-peat.\n\nJoel Anthony:\n\nAnthony went from starting for the Heat to not playing at all. A great insurance policy if the Chris’s were to go down with an injury. Anthony’s defense is great while his offense….Well, his offense stinks.\n\nWhat’s Next: If Anthony is not amnestied, he will continue to come in when the Heat need his defense. Otherwise, he will keep the bench warm for the other players.\n\nVeteran:\n\nJuwan Howard:\n\nHoward was only brought for the his veteran mentality. He is one of the smartest, classiest guy in the league. As the only member of the Fab Five to win ring(s), it must feel great to be Juwan Howard.\n\nWhat’s Next: Howard could be brought back as the 15th man, but I think the Heat should sign him as an assistant coach or player mentor.\n\nRookie:\n\nJarvis Varnado:\n\nVarnado didn’t play much, but nonetheless it must have felt great to win a ring with the Heat. Varnado was a beast in college as he achieved a milestone only David Robinson has achieved before, 1000 points, 1000 rebounds and 500 blocks.\n\nWhat’s Next: Varnado is currently competing for the last spot on the roster. While he would be a great candidate, I don’t think the Heat will sign him since they will keep a roster spot open till midseason in case a veteran player gets released at the time.\n\nNBA’S WORST OF THE BEST – 3RD ROUND\n\nLast time we left off, we finished the second round games and the results are shown above.\n\nRecap: The Suns’ big three of Nash, Marion and Stoudamire easily beat the T-Mac and Yao Ming led Houston Rockets. Carmelo Anthony of the Nuggets went to work, but the one man wrecking crew in Denver could not beat the talented and deep Sacramento Kings. The Defensive minded Pacers lost to King James and his army. The balanced Pistons made quick work of the NY Knicks.\n\nSo, in the Eastern Conference Finals the Cavs face the Piston while on the Western Conference Finals, the Suns play the Kings. All teams are very talented and high scoring. It should be a good round. With the Big Five in Detroit matching up with the King James led Cavs while the Big Three in Phoenix against the balanced Kings team, let’s see who wins the match ups.\n\n2006-07 Phoenix Suns vs. 2001-02 Sacramento Kings:\n\nThird Round Match-up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Average Suns 107 106 100 93 84 101 109 100 Kings 94 100 104 107 102 99 99 101\n\n2009-10 Cleveland Cavaliers vs. 2005-06 Detroit Pistons:\n\nThird Round Match-up 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Average Pistons 97 87 94 80 82 81 112 90 Cavs 102 88 80 87 99 80 87 89\n\nNBA Expansion Crazy Ideas\n\nBefore I start, let me be clear. The things I am going to talk about, most likely won’t happen for a long time in the NBA. So, before you call me crazy, just remember these are all hypothetical situations.\n\nWith all the talk about Sacramento Kings moving to Seattle, the New Orleans Hornets becoming the New Orleans Pelicans and the Charlotte Bobcats going back to the Charlotte Hornets, it got me thinking what if the league added more teams? I know there probably will be one or two more teams added in the next five years. But, I’m not just talking about one or teams, I’m talking about adding 6 more teams. Currently, there are 30 teams in the NBA divided into two conferences and 6 divisions. Each division has 5 teams thus each conference has 15 teams. For the moment, the league set up is close to perfect with the exception of David Stern and the referees. However, as basketball gets bigger and gets globalized, there are going to be more athletes within and from other countries. The number of players in a team, at max is 15. In general, there can be 450 players in the NBA, given that every team has 15 players. But, if the league expanded to 36 teams, there would be 90 more players. Although that doesn’t sound like a lot, it would give more players the chance to play. I mean, there are tons of players still looking for a job, who could potentially play for these teams, such as Gilbert Arenas, Stephon Marbury, Larry Hughes, Mehmet Okur, Andres Nocioni, Al Thorton, Troy Murphy among a lot of others could aren’t in current teams that could still play. The biggest one being Allen Iverson.\n\nMy Plan:\n\nFirst, like I stated, I would add one more team to each division. But, before we can do that, we have to re align the league. I mean, Memphis and New Orleans are geographically on the East side of the USA but in the NBA world, they are in the Western Conference. So, my plans for re alignment are:\n\nFirst, the names of the divisions would be reconsidered. In the West, there would be Northwest, Pacific but Southwest would be changed to Midwest. While in the West, there would be Atlantic, Southeast and Central like currently.\n\nSecond, some teams would have to change divisions and even conferences.\n\nDallas, San Antonio, Houston would go from Southwest to Midwest\n\nDenver would go from Northwest to Pacific\n\nGolden State would go from Pacific to Northwest\n\nMemphis would go from the Western Conference (Southwest Division) to the Eastern Conference (Southeast Division)\n\nMinnesota would go from Northwest to Midwest\n\nNew Orleans would go from the Western Conference (Southwest Division) to the Eastern Conference (Southeast Division)\n\nOklahoma City would go from Northwest to Midwest\n\nSacramento would go from Pacific to Northwest\n\nToronto would go from Atlantic to Central\n\nWashington would go from Southeast to Atlantic\n\nAll the other teams would stay in the same division\n\nSecond, I would add teams to the divisions. But, since we aligned it already, the teams would have to be added to each division accordingly. The Southeast and Central Divisions already have 6 teams, after the re-alignment, thus we would not add any more teams there. There would have to be two teams added to the Northwest and Pacific divisions while one added to each Midwest and Atlantic divisions. So, the teams/cities I would add to the NBA are:\n\nSeattle and Vancouver to the Northwest Division. Las Vegas and San Jose to the Pacific Division. Montreal to the Atlantic Division. Omaha to the Midwest Division.\n\nCapacity Index for NBA Available Personal Income (billions of dollars) Rank Metro Area All Pro Teams Rating for NBA 2 Montreal 2 100 Sufficient $82.96 4 Las Vegas 0 100 Sufficient $69.32 9 San Jose 2 100 Sufficient $55.33 16 Seattle 2 100 Sufficient $38.58 20 Omaha 0 100 Sufficient $37.00 24 Vancouver 2 98 Borderline $33.29\n\nData from:\n\nhttp://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/scott-thomas/2011/08/22-markets-have-nba-potential.html?appSession=144118935680643&RecordID=&PageID=2&PrevPageID=&cpipage=3&CPISortType=&CPIorderBy=\n\nSeattle: In the year 2008, Clay Bennett and David Stern blatantly stole the Supersonics and relocated to Oklahoma City. Seattle fans are still fuming about this. And, to add salt to the wound, the OKC Thunder eventually reached the NBA Finals just 4 years after they relocated. The fans in Seattle certainly want a team. They almost got one this year with the turmoil in Sacramento, but that ultimately fell apart. Out of all the NBA cities, Seattle is and should be top priority if the NBA wants to restore its image. Plus, Chris Hansen and Steve Ballmer would be quite the owners. Potential Names: Seattle Supersonics. Can’t by anything else.\n\nLas Vegas/Anaheim: Las Vegas has always been linked with multiple relocation and expansion rumors. Of course, how could it not be? It’s the biggest city without a pro sports team. Plus, the NBA All Star Game has been played there multiple times, so we know it’s capable of having a team. After Seattle, Las Vegas should be the second priority for the NBA. However, the biggest downfall to this idea is that Las Vegas is the gambling capital of the USA. The players would be addicted to this lifestyle plus, the NBA fixing could be a major problem. A quick alternate for the Las Vegas idea is Anaheim. Although South Cali probably cannot hold any more NBA teams, and the Lakers wouldn’t reject this idea, Anaheim is a good destination with tons of basketball fans, and the rumor has always been there. But, in a perfect world, I’d pick Las Vegas over Anaheim. Potential Names: Las Vegas Bandits, Anaheim Royals,\n\nMontreal: The NBA will probably be globalized in fifty years, so why not start with America’s neighbor to the North? Montreal has big sports fans (in Alouettes fans, Canadien fans). Also, Montreal is the second biggest city in Canada. However, the biggest thing for a team here is the rivalry it would create between itself and Toronto Raptors. Canadians are nice people, but when it comes to sports, they can be the biggest of enemies. It would create a nice Canadian rivalry and NBA would become more popular in Canada. I don’t know why, maybe it’s due to the NHL, but the NBA isn’t as popular in Canada. Adding another team would help, especially with two teams in the East. Potential Names: Montreal Quebecois\n\nVancouver: Don’t worry Western Canadians, I didn’t forget you. Once upon a time, Vancouver had a NBA team called the Vancouver Grizzlies. However, not enough fan support was enough to get it relocated to Memphis. The End. But, seriously, Vancouver fans are passionate about sports (See Vancouver Riots after NHL Playoffs). A team in Vancouver would be great since it would get West Canada involved thus increasing value and income. Not to mention but a Seattle-Vancouver rivalry would be great. Potential Names: Vancouver Mounties, Vancouver Silverbacks,\n\nSan Jose/Riverside-San Bernardino/San Diego: What? Another team in California? In a study, it was shown all three of these locations were ready for an NBA team due to it’s market potential. While Riverside-San Bernardino is the most suitable economically, I fear that it would be to close to the LA Lakers and the LA Clippers. San Diego, on the other hand, wouldn’t be a terrible choice, I feel like San Jose would be the most suitable. It’s far away from the Clippers and Lakers. While it’s closer to the Warriors home, it would create a rivalry there also. Plus, San Jose already has a stadium in the HP Pavilion Arena. Fan support would be no worry, as the Sharks have shown that the San Jose-ans would definitely come watch. Potential Names: San Jose Shooters\n\nKansas City/Omaha/Pittsburgh: Out of all these, my pick would be Omaha. The biggest flaw wth that is that it would be a single market team. However, if that’s the worst, I would call that not too shabby. The biggest problem to the others is: Kansas City has huge interest in NCAA basketball, which could create a problem. With Pittsburgh, I have heard from many people that not enough people care about basketball there. While some people would want a NBA team, I do not think it would last very long. While Kansas City is the best, it already has the Royals and the Chiefs. If the NBA went to Omaha (where they have a relatively new stadium), it would boost NBA interest in the Midwest. Plus, Omaha is only a hour or two away from Kansas City, thus making it possible to go from one to another city. A while ago, they did try to split the games between the city which is a pretty reasonable idea, I do no think it’s feasible for the athletes. But, if there was enough interest between the cities to share the team benefit everyone, especially with the Basketball Hall of Fame being an hour away Kansas City. Potential Names: Pittsburgh Hornets, Kansas City Soul\n\nWest\n\nEast\n\nNorthwest\n\nPacific\n\nMidwest\n\nAtlantic\n\nSoutheast\n\nCentral\n\nPortland LA Clippers Minnesota Boston Miami Toronto GS LA Lakers OKC NY Knicks Orlando Cleveland Sacramento Denver Dallas Brooklyn Atlanta Chicago Utah Phoenix SA Philadelphia Memphis Milwaukee Seattle Las Vegas Houston Washington New Orleans Detroit Vancouver San Jose Omaha Montreal Charlotte Indiana\n\nSeason and Playoffs:\n\nAnother thing that would need to be changed is the number of games and playoffs. Let’s be honest, as fans, we look forward to the playoffs more than the regular season. Of course, the athletes would need the regular season and the league would need it to see who would make the playoffs. But, my solution would be making the season shorter. The amount of games in the regular season would be reduced from 82 to between 50 to 70. The best number would be 66 or 70. I got these two numbers from:\n\nLet’s take one team, say the Celtics. In their division, there are 5 other teams and they would play three times a year. So far, that’s 15 games. In their conference, not counting the teams in their divisions, there are 12 teams and they would play 2 games in a year. Thus, that 24 games plus the 15 division games, which makes 39 games. Now, as for the teams in the other conference, half of them would play each other twice while have would plays once thus the total conference games would add up to 27. That makes a grand total of 66. If that doesn’t satisfy people, we could add 4 more games against rivals around the league. So, the Celtics in addition to playing the 66 games would play 4 additional games against the Lakers, Heat, Bulls and Pistons. Of course, not all teams has 4 rivals but it shouldn’t be that hard to find.\n\nSince, we have pretty much changed everything about the NBA, let’s take it one step further. Let’s change the playoffs. First, the seeding would have to be changed. Since, there are now six teams in each division, the top two teams from each division would make the playoffs. In addition, I would add in a Wild Card race, similar to the NFL and MLB. The top two teams from the Wild Card would also make the playoffs. There would still be 8 teams on each conference to reach the playoffs. The actual format of the playoffs, for most parts, are pretty well done. Not much needs to be changed, except the Finals should switch back from the 2-3-2 style to the 2-2-1-1-1. If you have no idea what that means, stop, google it and then come back.\n\nSo, basically, if I was appointed NBA Commissioner, those are the things I would change. I realize, that most of it isn’t very practical in the moment, but I feel like the NBA would be more successful and logical. Some of the main problems for my changes are:\n\nNot enough talents to have 36 teams\n\nPeople aren’t happy with “Big Threes”, maybe this would help spread apart players; I know you can’t force players to take less money, but you could always change salary cap\n\nChange number of players on the roster from 15 to 12 or 13.\n\nThe small market teams would fizzle out very swiftly due to attendance problems\n\nIf you look at the cities I mentioned, the only one that could have this problem is Omaha, but there is not many professional NBA teams in the mid-USA section, besides OKC. I think it would be pretty well off.\n\nUltimately, I said this would be a crazy idea. It might not work for another 10, 20 or even 50 years. But, as the population of the world increases and more and more people start playing basketball, it’s a change that will be required. What do you think? What would you change about the NBA? Tell us below!\n\nAll Time Starting Five\n\nSomeone on a Facebook Sports Discussion group posted, “If you had the choice to choose your starting lineup for basketball who would you guys pick? This can be present day players or NBA legends.” and this got me thinking….Who would I pick? First of all, I needed to decide what kind of team I would want? For instance would I like all scorers, or all defensive or etc…. and I concluded that the best team would have to be an all around team. So, each player at each position can do anything like pass, rebound or score along with others.\n\nMy All Time First Starting Five:\n\nPG: Although there are many great point guards like John Stockton, Steve Nash or Jason Kidd, I’d pick Oscar Robertson over those guys. Why? Oscar averaged a triple double for a season, a record that no one has broken to this day. Going with my theme of an all around team, Oscar is one of the few all around point guards. Of course, Jason Kidd also has a ton of triple doubles, Robertson’s style of play intrigues me and Robertson’s win shares per 48 minutes is much higher than Kidd’s. Starting PG: Oscar Robertson\n\nSG: When you are the greatest of all time, you get to be included in basically every list out there. Thus, the shooting guard on my team would be Michael Jordan. I mean, do I really need to explain this one? Of course, I could have included Kobe instead, but once again Jordan’s stats are a little bit more all rounded than Kobe’s stats. Let the Jordan vs Kobe debate continue! Starting SG: Michael Jordan\n\nSF: By now, people are thinking, “What about Magic Johnson? He is much better than Oscar Robertson” and to them, I say, “Hold on!” Now, I know Magic played point guard, but bear with me here. Given his height, 6’8″, I think he would be perfectly capable of playing the small forward position. Another player with a gorgeous game and a beautiful all around game, Johnson would perfectly complement Oscar and MJ. His unselfishness and team play would benefit the team in every way possible. Starting SF: Magic Johnson\n\nPF: Of course, there are players like Charles Barkley, Karl Malone and Tim Duncan, but personally, I’m inserting LeBron James in the lineup. I like LeBron James’ all around game, even though the others might be better suited for this postion. Yes, LBJ is not as suited for this position as the others, but we have seen LBJ is capable of playing and guarding basically any position. Plus, LeBron James’ career isn’t done and he has already accomplish so much and has yet to achieve much more. This position is a toss up, but I’m going with LBJ. Starting PF: LeBron James\n\nC: This is probably the toughest position to pick with so many talented centers. That being said, I’d give the edge to Wilt Chamberlain. While Bill Russell and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have the rings, Wilt has the stats. Wilt’s career averages of 30 points per game and 22.9 rebounds per game are better than any other center. Wilt has also scored 100 points in a game, a record that hasn’t been broken yet. Given, that there were only 8 or 10 teams when Wilt played, but with those averages, he still makes my all time starting five. Starting C: Wilt Chamberlain\n\n6th Man: Bill Russell: 11 rings speaks for itself. Plus, when LeBron James can’t guard all the tall power forwards, I can slide Russell in and have the advantage of two tall dominant players at the 4 and 5 positions. 6th Man: Bill Russell\n\nCareer Stats:\n\nPosition Player G MP PTS TRB AST STL BLK FG% 3P% FT% WS WS/48 PG Oscar Robertson 1040 42.2 25.7 7.5 9.5 1.1 0.1 0.485 0.838 189.2 0.207 SG Michael Jordan 1072 38.3 30.1 6.2 5.3 2.3 0.8 0.497 0.327 0.835 214 0.25 SF Magic Johnson 906 36.7 19.5 7.2 11.2 1.9 0.4 0.52 0.303 0.848 155.8 0.225 PF LeBron James 765 39.7 27.6 7.3 6.9 1.7 0.8 0.49 0.337 0.747 152.6 0.241 C Wilt Chamberlain 1045 45.8 30.1 22.9 4.4 0.54 0.511 247.3 0.248 6th Bill Russell 1957 1969 963 42.3 15.1 23 4.3 0.44 0.561 163.5 0.193\n\nOf course, people are going to be like, “How could you miss this guy or that guy?” so, I made a second and third starting five, but I won’t explain why I picked them.

An interview where Iverson was asked about missing practice. Most people found it hilarious and are still making jokes about it even though it was over 10 years ago. After AI turned 38 yesterday (June 7th), I decided to scroll down the twitter page and see all the comments that people were making to wish the legend well. I was shocked to see the amount of references to the practice interview! During the interview, AI spoke about how silly it was to be talking about practice and about how his work in the game should be what they talk about, not about what happens when he misses one practice. It was the small things in AI’s career that have been blown out of proportion his entire life.\n\nWhen AI was entering the NBA, everyone saw him as the new ‘Bad Boy’ because of his tattoos, cornrows and vicious style of play from Georgetown. He was unfairly labelled the thug of the NBA unfairly due to his appearance. By that logic, if Patrick Ewing, Alonzo Mourning, or Dikembe Mutombo had the same appearance as AI, they would also be classified as thugs. AI played just as physical as each one of the three Hoya centers, but because he was smaller and had more tattoos he was seen this way.\n\nAllen Iverson was listed at 6 feet and 165lbs. This puts him at my height with about 10lbs extra. He was puny by NBA standards! Yet he managed to score 27ppg in his first 9 seasons in the league, which up until then had never happened. He was the first player under 6’3 to receive the NBA scoring title (which he won 4 times). His playoff scoring average is second only to the great Michael Jordan. Though he never won a championship, he gave one of the best Finals performances that we have seen. Taking the Kobe-Shaq Lakers and scoring 48 points in game 1! He also hit a crucial shot and did his famous “step-over” on Tyronn Lue. Everyone counted on them to be swept by the much bigger and stronger Lakers, but they gave them a tough series. He was constantly beaten up and was always injured because of his small stature going up against 265lb monsters down low. He played against a 300+lb Shaq in the Finals and gave him a fight.\n\nAllen Iverson was also an extremely underrated defender. He led the league in steals for 3 consecutive seasons and has a career average of 2.2 steals a game and was never named on to the NBA All-Defensive teams. At 6 feet, he was not going to send your shot back at you, but he was going to prevent the shot from going up in the first place. He was named Big East Defensive Player of the Year in the 2 years he spent at Georgetown, but he was never again commended for his defense. There are also circulating rumors that he was a ball hog, although he averaged over 6 assists for his career. Though he wasn’t the best shooter, he was definitely the greatest scorer after Michael Jordan.\n\nHere is a complete list of his career stats:\n\n914 games played\n\n901 games started\n\n41.1 mpg\n\n42.5 fg%\n\n31.3 3fg%\n\n78.0 ft%\n\n3.7 rbg\n\n6.2 apg\n\n2.2 spg\n\n0.2 bpg\n\n26.7 ppg\n\nThe following interview with Allen Iverson was conducted by Stephen A. Smith back in the 2005 off-season. I know it’s long, but it really gives an in-depth look at who Allen Iverson truly was and how great he really is.\n\nThe Man. The Myth. The Legend. James Blair.\n\nHey there sports fans! Welcome to the iSportsLife First Interview. If you are a admirer or a hater of the Heat, you are probably well aware of the fan who ran on to the court wearing a “We Miss You” shirt during the Cavs-Heat game. We got the chance to ask him a couple of questions about LeBron James, Miami Heat and of course, his infamous court run. Here is what he said:\n\n1. Brishank: What got you interested in Basketball/Cavaliers?\n\nJames Blair: When I was a 5th grader in elementary school, I was taken and got the chance to watch LeBron James play as a junior in high school. Ever since that moment he has been my inspiration and idol. That’s also the year I started playing competitive ball and then started following Cleveland sports all around after that!\n\n2. Brishank: I know when I lived in Ohio during 2008, people were big fans of LBJ. But, we saw Cleveland turn against him in 2010. The rest of the world saw what the media showed, jersey burnings, the legendary poster coming off, etc…. But, how was it internally after 2010? How were discussions with your friends and other Cavs Fans?\n\nJames: Majority of the people were extremely let down and heartbroken and that led to the majority of hate and bias towards LeBron, not just as an athlete but as a person which I think was unfair given the bigger picture of the situation. But, I respect everyone else’s opinion about HOW he went about doing it and if they dislike him for that reason they have that right. But, from my point of view, LeBron is a great guy on and off the court!\n\n3. Brishank: What was the main reason for the hate? Was it the way he left, the team he went to, the people he joined?\n\nJames: I would say the biggest reason was the [empty promise]. The fans and management put everything they had in LeBron James and looked at him to take us single-handedly to the promise land, and when he decided to leave it was big and [he didn’t even give us a warning].\n\n4. Brishank: In your opinion, is LeBron James better than Michael Jordan?\n\nJames: I personally deep down feel that LeBron is a better ALL-AROUND player than MJ. I could go on for days with why but I’ll leave it at that for now (haha).\n\n5. Brishank: What made you want to pull that stunt during the game? Did you talk to LeBron after the incident? What went through your mind during? What happened afterwards? Was it worth it?\n\nJames: I was going to run on a court/field something this year because it was something on my bucketlist. I’ve always wanted to do [something like that]. After A LOT of planning, I decided what a better way to do it than to do it at THE biggest game of the year for Cleveland sports teams and to accomplish some other things while I was at it. That was meeting and getting to talk directly to my idol and favorite athlete LeBron James and getting him to see the message directly. I was trying to get out the message that there are still fans here that care about you [LeBron James] and support you after everything! I also got to cross off getting arrested and spending a night in jail as well. [LOL] After the incident, LeBron tweeted me when I got out of jail and he also followed me on twitter! During the run and the moments leading up to it, I was extremely nervous!! I’m usually never nervous about anything in life but this was the first time I can honestly say I was sick to my stomach! When I actually made it past all the security and onto the floor I was stunned, I was frozen with shock and all I kept thinking was “wow, I really pulled this off, I made it, I made it”. Afterwards they took me to a holding cell under the arena and issued me a lifetime ban from the arena. Then, I awaited for two Cleveland City Police Officers to come escort me transport me to the jail where I would spend the next 23 hours! It was worth every second of it and I don’t regret a thing!\n\n6. Brishank: Would you ever want to be involved in the Sports world (such as GM, Owner, etc)?\n\nJames: That would be a dream. I’ve always dreamed about that and if I ever get that opportunity, it would be absolutely amazing and I’d take full advantage of it!\n\n7. Brishank: In my opinion, LeBron James is going to stay with Miami. He has Wade there, he likes it better than Cleveland. I don’t think he likes Dan Gilbert. In your opinion, do you think he will go back to the Cavs? Why?\n\nJames: I personally believe LeBron will return to Cleveland one day, and my biggest reason for this is who wouldn’t want to return and have their jersey retired at the place that drafted you and where you own virtually every record. But there are a lot of other reasons that allow some fans to think he will return. Regardless of where he is though, I’ll support him and hope he does the best!\n\n8. Brishank: Does LeBron deserve all the criticism he STILL gets, even after winning the ring?\n\nJames: No, I don’t believe he should. Especially after this year and what he has accomplished throughout his career!!\n\n9. Brishank: Besides LeBron, which other athletes do you like?\n\nJames: My second favorite NBA player is Chris Paul. Outside of the NBA, I am also a huge Floyd Mayweather fan!\n\n10. Brishank: Opinions on Dan Gilbert?\n\nJames: Personally he is an amazing business man in general. I don’t think him and the rest of the management did everything they should have during his 7 years with LeBron and the Cavs but that’s neither here nor there. I like his attitude going forward and I think he is gonna make the best moves every day to put the Cavs in a position to win!\n\n11. Brishank: Now that the Cavs JUST got the #1 Pick, who do you want in a Cavs uniform next season? Is the LBJ-Cavs reunion inevitable now? Will the fans accept him?\n\nJames: I feel like Otto Porter is a good choice but personally still believe Noels is the best athlete available in this poor draft class. I feel like if anything getting a number one pick can’t hurt the chance of a LBJ return!\n\n12. Brishank: How much hate did you receive for loving LeBron even after his departure from Cleveland?\n\nJames: A lot and I mean A LOT!! People who really KNEW me and my story behind everything understood my position. Before I ever knew sports I was introduced to LeBron and he was the one athlete that inspired me since the beginning and has been my idol! He got me interested in not just basketball but sports in general. That is why I am a LEBRON fan before anything else yet still a die-hard Cleveland fan! If that makes sense if not it doesn’t matter because its me. Hahahaha.\n\n13. Brishank: I like that attitude. You don’t need others to be happy for yourself to be happy. Do you think LeBron is a flopper?\n\nJames: I think there are times he does [exaggerates] but I wouldn’t classify him as a flopper. LeBron takes a lot of hits and fouls that normally would knock a player on their ass, but due to his size, the person dealing it usually seems to get it worse. HA!. But, I do feel on occasion LeBron has over exaggerated fouls but in the NBA, who doesn’t? haha.\n\n14. Brishank: When LeBron James initially said, “I’m taking my talents to South Beach”, what went through your head?\n\nJames: Initially like right away I was upset.. More for the fact that I wasn’t going to get to see my idol as much because he wouldn’t be playing for my home team anymore. After a day or two passed, I was happy for LeBron as he going to chase his dreams and I was ready to go along for the ride on his journey!\n\n15. Brishank: Are you cheering for the Heat or the Cavs?How many rings will LBJ end up with?\n\nJames: I will always root for all my Cleveland teams and hope they succeed! But I am a Heat fan and rooting LeBron on [to win many, many personal and team accolades] and witnessing history!\n\nThanks James Blair for being awesome and answering all of the questions! Thanks for reading sports fans! Hope to see you next time!\n\nHow Fans Have Ruined Sports\n\nLet’s take care of one thing first. Professional sports requires its viewers, its “fans”. Without its fans, sports would be nothing. It relies on sales of tickets, merchandise in addition to sponsorship and advertising. It falls into the category of entertainment, in which we value more than anything else. Professional sports, like the NBA, NFL, MLB, MLS, World Cup, Olympics, heavily rely upon fan support, sponsors, advertisements and other commercial deals or else it would not be a success. What I’m trying to say is even though fans are needed for the sports to stay alive, I think fan(atics) go a little too far when it comes to sports. Also, if you haven’t check out my post on How to Troll Sport Fans for Dummies, you can check it out here.\n\nFor the purpose of this article, let’s leave all bias at the door. Release all the negative energy you feel against a player, team or anything else in the sports world. Let the past stay in the past. Ignore all the hate you have and read on as we try to approach the hate from a logical viewpoint. Yes, I’m talking to the LeBron James haters, Kobe Bryant haters, Tim Tebow haters, Heat, Seahawks, Patriots haters. Let go of the hate and think about why you hate them. We need to take a step back and look at sports from a unbiased opinion. (Note: Examples from the Heat will be very prevalent in this article since they are the most scrutinized team in all of sports)\n\nThe first thing wrong with fans is the need to label bandwagon fans as fans of a particular team. You can’t label bandwagon fans as a specific team’s fan since they won’t be there after a while. For instance, take the Heat since they are the most hated in the NBA right now. Believe it or not, the Heat had fans before 2010. The attendance statistics show us that the Heat were in the top 15 nine out of the last 13 years (being in the Top 5 for six of the last 13 years). Even before LeBron James and Chris Bosh came to town, the Heat were a popular team. Thus, when the floodgates opened, the bandwagoners came but they are not TRUE Heat fans and will probably leave to another team, like the Celtics and causing people to call them Celtics fans. But, wait….You can’t be a Heat fan AND Celtics fan. So, my problem is with people needing to label bandwagon fans with team X’s fan. First of all, it gives a bad name to the actual fanbase. Let’s be honest, if the team had NO true fans, the team wouldn’t even exist. Secondly, it shuts down the real fans from expressing their opinions because they are quickly dismissed as bandwagon fans. So, instead of labeling bandwagon fans as a certain team’s fan, just call them bandwagon fans. Also, the bigger bandwagon fans are the opponents of the best team in the league. The fans hate the team so much, they jump team to team waiting for that one team to beat the best so they can start trolling again.\n\nSecondly, I’m getting annoyed at everyone blaming the referees and saying the league is fixed. Yes, there has been times where the referees have decided the outcome of a game but that doesn’t happen EVERY game. No matter who wins in a certain game, the losing team’s fans will say that the refs are fixing the games and that David Stern has been rigging the league forever. This is complete BS. Can’t you fans give credit where it is due? Can’t you accept defeat graciously? It makes me even more mad when the losing team shot more free throws and yet still manage to complain about the referees. Thin about it, if the NBA were rigged (for LeBron James as many say), would he not have won the ring in 2004 and every year after that? In addition, the teams in the Conference finals this year are 4 of the smaller NBA market teams. If you don’t believe me, check out this link. Plus, if you think YOU can get all the right calls, why don’t YOU go be a referee?\n\nThird, most sport fans tend to be hypocritical. For example, in the summer of 2010, fans of teams with tons of salary cap were doing everything and anything to help bring LeBron to the team. But, as LeBron chose the Heat, everywhere he played, he constantly goes booed. Even if he was putting up triple doubles or extraordinary numbers. Second example is when people say LeBron had to join the Heat to win a ring. Wait, I thought Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Phil Jackson? Oh wait, some people believe Scottie Pippen is better than LBJ. Wait, so why can’t LBJ join other players? If MJ had Phil Jackson, arguably one of the best coaches ever, LeBron has it harder. Erik Spoelstra is a great coach and no disrespect to him, but he is not Phil Jackson. Also, people blame LeBron James for joining the Heat yet the SAME people say, “Bosh is too soft, Wade and Allen are washed up and Wade can’t do anything without flopping.” Well, “sports fans” , which is it? Are the Heat good or do the Heat suck? Another case is when the Heat and the Bulls played during the Eastern Conference Semi-Finals. Remember, when the Joakim Noah got ejected and the lady gave Noah the finger? Well, the Bulls fans called Miami fans classless and a joke. But, soon when LeBron James got pushed by Nazr Mohammed, the Bulls fan gave Nazr a standing ovation. And when Heat fans called out the Bulls for being classless, they said LeBron deserved it. Wait, what did LeBron James do to you personally to deserve it? This brings me to my fourth point.\n\nFans can get pretty classless at times. I get it, there are rivalries and bad blood due to history, but that doesn’t change the fact that wishing an injury on another human is very, very classless. Yeah, some people might laugh at players getting injured, which I do not condone either, but that does not mean you should hope that Kobe tears his ACL or that someone fights Dwight Howard. Why can’t we just enjoy the game as it is? What is wishing an injury of NBA greats going to do? Prevent them from winning rings? I don’t know about you but I want to witness history being made. After all, my life is average, much like most NBA fans, so why can’t we watch others do things we can’t without being greedy or jealous?\n\nLast but not least, the whole rigged thing. It irks me. If it was truly rigged, Kobe would have 15 rings. MJ would have 16. LeBron would have 10 by now. In the playoffs, all the remaining teams are relatively smaller markets.\n\nIn addition, sports fans like to live in the past. They constantly talk about their Super Bowls from a decade or two ago, or the amazing World Series or their multiple championships from when no one was alive. We live in the present; How about we stop comparing the golden eras of the past, since we cannot time travel, and just enjoy what we have today? Why can’t we come together and enjoy Kobe’s clutchness before his retires, or Howard’s crazy antics?\n\nLastly, the need for sports fans to bash professionals athletes. Now, I don’t agree with these athletes getting paid more than Doctors or Surgeons, but the thing is athletes work just as hard. They have to keep up a strict diet, practice everyday play games; while their life seems easier than most people’s, you need to remember where they came from, and that everything they do is heavily scrutinized. There’s 300 to 500 professional NBA players, which is not a lot. I mean, why would you call KG a bum, or Kobe a rapist or LeBron a choke? If they were any of those, they wouldn’t be there. Even when we joke and say Luke Walton is the worst player, we are wrong. Yes, he might not be the best, but he had to do SOMETHING right to make it to the NBA. Same goes with baseball, football, hockey players. Even the worst ones had to do something right to make it, or else they wouldn’t even be there. Plus, I’m sure most of them have done more for charity than you will in your lifetime.\n\nThis is the last one, for sure. But, can we PLEASE stop including athletes’ private life into their sports life? Who cares what party Aaron Rodgers went to or that Tiger Woods cheated on his wife? That’s his PERSONAL issues and it does not affect the fans. Sure, it might take a toll on his image but, honestly, why would that affect his pro career? If you are going to discuss the performances of the athletes, do not include stories about their personal lives, unless it specifically affects you.\n\nI lied. This is the last one. Fans also feel the need to compare different players. While it’s okay to compare big name players like LBJ and Kobe, it gets annoying when people keep saying X is better than Y because of Z. It’s alright if the athletes are both still playing or both are retired but it is dumb if one of them is still playing because you don’t know where and how they will end their career.\n\nThe logical reasoning for most fans are thrown out the window when discussing sports. For instance: Big guy falls = he is a flopper; Someone defends Kobe/Tom Brady/Lebron/A-Rod equals being a “dickrider” ; someone you have never met or know about is rooting for a team? He must be a bandwagoner. But, you know what? Big guys fall when they don’t expect a push; defending a player against irrational comments isn’t “dickriding”, and you don’t have to know every stat or go to every game or name every past player to be a fan of a team.\n\nAnyway, before I ramble on further, I am going to end it there. Of course, there are tons of other things that fans do that annoys me. I don’t hate fans naturally, but if you are a hypocrite or don’t use logic when talking about sports, I come to dislike you. It’s especially strong when it comes to blaming the refs for everything (Of course, for you watching at home, it’s easier to tell if it was a travel or not). I don’t mind rivalry hate or hate if a player affected you personally, but when you hate someone for stupid reasons or no reason, that’s when you sound dumb. Most fans are logical and thorough, but some of them ruin the game. Let’s just take a step back, relax, take a moment to think why we hate an athlete or team and if it’s a dumb reason, let it go. 🙂\n\nHating – The Right Way\n\nLet’s be honest, we all hate an athlete or a team. For me, I don’t necessarily hate a certain team or player, but rather the fans of certain teams. I don’t dislike all of them but some of them need to stop being ignorant. I am a huge Heat fan. No, I am not a bandwagoner. I have liked the Heat since 2003, but if you don’t believe me, I don’t care. I am not going to sit here and prove to strangers that I am not a bandwagoner. Anyway, the only player I remember hating since I started watching basketball was LeBron James. Back when LeBron’s Cavaliers were at the top of the NBA standings, I admit I hated LeBron James. Why? It was because I was scared that he would stop the Heat from winning another championship after they won it in 2006. I hated to admit it at the time, but I was scared due to LeBron my team would not win a championship for a while. However, the Cavs did not work out exactly and LBJ joined the Miami Heat and I started to like him more and more. His playing style and level of play made me a bigger fan. I’m not a LeBron “dickrider” as the folks on ESPN like to call it; I just simply respect the fact that he is the best NBA player right now and has been for a while. But, that is all beside the point for this article. Over the years, I have picked up a few things on how to be a perfect “hater”. I hate saying “hater”, but there is nothing else that explain these type of people. When in doubt and if you want to be the best hater in the world, do the following:\n\nMake fun of the player’s family or friends or their background.\n\nIn LeBron James’ case, state some fact thing about Gloria James or Delonte West, or even both\n\nIn Kobe Bryant’s case, state something about his relationship with Vanessa Bryant\n\nBlame the referees.\n\nThis is possibly the oldest play in the book, “How to Troll: For Dummies”\n\nThis is a sport where one team wins and the other loses; the losing team’s fanbase never fails to complain about the referees even if they favored the losing team because apparently the NBA is rigged\n\nMany believe that the NBA is rigged thanks to David Stern to let LeBron James win multiple rings. But, wait, if that was the case, LeBron should have 9 rings by now. Oh WAIT…..\n\nMake fun of the player’s age\n\nBe sure to say they are washed up\n\nCall them a bum, fake, flopper, dramatic,\n\nApparently being in the NBA makes you a bum even though playing in the NBA is more than most people will accomplish (sports-wise)\n\nYou know what they say…. “You ain’t a NBA guru until you call out a NBA player for flopping :D”\n\nTalk about the player’s personal life while not reading the whole story to make up some BS….\n\nNever give credit where it’s due but instead try to talk down the opponent even if they are a LOT better\n\nBe hypocritical as much as you can:\n\nMichael Jordan didn’t need superstar teammates like Lebron James does. Oh, I guess Pippen and Rodman were just role players.\n\nBut, wait, I forgot many people believe Pippen was better than James.\n\nThe opponent won? They suck. The opponent lost? They suck.\n\nKings beat the Celtics? Duh, Celtics had no one except Pierce and Garnett. The Kings were SUPPOSED to win. They still suck though. Not like the Kings completely outplayed the Celtics.\n\nCeltics beat the Kings? Yeah, because the Kings suck.\n\nLive in the past:\n\nOh, Jordan took hundreds of hard fouls and didn’t complain about it like Queen James. The Piston Bad Boys would have fixed up LeBron James.\n\nOh, the Celtics have 17 rings. Even though I was alive for 1 of them, I will still talk about all 17 rings.\n\nMichael Jordan is the GOAT.\n\nYes. I agree, but I thought it was 2013 not 1995. Let’s enjoy the greatness that is in front of us instead of worshipping the past. I mean, we would love to go back to the past but sadly, we don’t have a time machine.\n\nWhen all else fails, be sure to blame the refs, blame David Stern and the fans. Even though the people don’t know how long others have been a fan of the team, troll them for being bandwagon fans.\n\nYou technically cannot label bandwagon fans as a particular team’s fan since they will move on anyway. For instance, Heat Fans can be Bandwagon fans but Bandwagon Fans cannot be Heat fans since they will be Laker fans in a couple of years. More on fans later.\n\nBonus: If all of the ones mentioned fail to make you the ultimate hater, here are some quick points to bring up: HGH, Make small things seem like big ones (Oh, I see Nate blocked LBJ, how many times has Nate won the MVP Award? Oh I see, Kobe got toyed around by Pablo Pirgioni, how many times has Pablo win the championship?), and last but not least, call the opponent or the team, cheater, comment on the schedule or the conference they play in and to put the cherry on top, wish an injury on the opposing player(s) and say that others laughed at their favorite player going down with an injury and they deserve it.\n\n(YES. THIS SHOULD BE READ WITH EXTREME SARCASM. IF I FORGOT ANY, BE SURE TO COMMENT THEM!)\n\nNBA Playoffs Conference Semifinals\n\nThe first round of the playoffs was quite boring. Besides some great plays, there wasn’t much excitement. However, the conference semi-finals, through 8 games, have been pretty close and amazing. Let’s take a closer look at all the teams and see who has the tools to win it all. The rankings are based on their win-loss.\n\n1. Miami Heat: Best Player in the League? Check. Best ex-Finals MVP Sidekick in the League? Check. Best Three Point Shooter in the History of the NBA? Check. Birdman? CAW CAW (that means Check in bird language). The 2012-13 Heat team has it all:\n\nBig Three: LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh (who can all easily shoot, rebound, pass, draw the double and triple teams)\n\nThree Point Shooters: Ray Allen, Mike Miller, Shane Battier, Mario Chalmers, James Jones, Rashard Lewis\n\nBigs: Chris Bosh, Joel Anthony, Udonis Haslem, Chris Andersen, Joel Anthony, Juwan Howard (although their rebounding is their weakest link, everyone has nicely stepped up)\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: Norris Cole, Chris Andersen\n\nDefense: This team is built around Riley’s defensive foundation\n\nVeteran: Juwan Howard, Ray Allen\n\nRookie: Jarvis Varnado, better than Eddy Curry\n\nDepth: Mike Miller, Rashard Lewis, James Jones would be starters, or at least get more minutes, in other teams\n\nCoach: Erik Spoelstra, known to take plays from various coaches has instilled the defense first mentality; He showed he could win without the Big Three against lower tier opponents.\n\nWeakness: Starting the game well\n\nOne Word to Describe Team: Two-Peat?\n\n2. OKC Thunder: Second Best Player in the League? Check.\n\nBig Three: Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, Serge Ibaka (has been reduced to the Big 2 with Westbrook’s season ending injury, but the injury has allowed Durant become LeBron-esque. His role to fill the gap left by Westbrook is being nicely fit). In addition, KD is not nice, but he is clutch.\n\nThree Point Shooters: Durant, Kevin Martin, Derek Fisher\n\nBigs: Serge Ibaka, Kendrick Perkins, Nick Collison, Hasheem Thabeet (ok, that last one is not very good)\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: Kevin Martin, as inconsistent as he is, has done a decent job of scoring with the lack of Westbrook\n\nDefense: Led by Thabo Shefolosha and Serge Ibaka, the Thunder have above average defense\n\nVeteran: Derek Fisher, Nick Collison\n\nRookie: Jeremy Lamb, Perry Jones\n\nDepth: Right now a little shorthanded with Westbrook’s injury forcing Reggie Jackson to start; their depth is the biggest problem\n\nCoach: Scott Brooks, took the Thunder to the Finals last year but I was disappointed by his choice to Hack-A-Sik in the first round.\n\nWeakness: Lack of Westbrook may hurt them in the WCF\n\nOne Word to Describe Team: Hungry\n\n3. SA Spurs: The Modern Eras Original Big Three? Check! One of the Best Coaches in the Game? Check. Even though the Spurs are old, they will not go down without a fight.\n\nBig Three: Tony Parker, Many Ginobili, Tim Duncan\n\nThree Point Shooters: Ginobili, Gary Neal, Matt Bonner, Danny Green (not the best, but all you need is the Red Mamba)\n\nBigs: Led by #21 Tim Duncan, Tiago Splitter, Matt Bonner, Boris Diaw and even Aron Baynes all play a different style of basketball but all are effective\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: Spurs are not a very high energy game. To be honest, their game is pretty boring but it’s high effective. Nonetheless, there is no high energy guy off the bench. All are savvy in their own ways.\n\nDefense: Tiago Splitter and Tim Duncan do an effective job\n\nVeteran: The whole team. DUH!\n\nRookie: Does Aron Baynes, a WSU Coug, count?\n\nDepth: With the addition of Tracy McGrady, this is a very deep team. Jokes aside, Spurs have consistently been a well oiled machine. Their depth only adds to this success.\n\nCoach: Simply said, Greg Popovich is one of the best in the game.\n\nWeakness: What else but age…\n\nOne Word to Describe Team: Effective\n\n4. Memphis Grizzlies\n\nBig Three: Tony Allen, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol\n\nThree Point Shooters: Tayshaun Prince, Jerryd Bayless\n\nBigs: The Grizzlies Twin Tower consisting of Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol is possibly the best big men combo in the league. Behind them are Ed Davis and Darrell Arthur.\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: Quincy Pondexter and Jerryd Bayless are a nice touch off the bench for the Grizzlies.\n\nDefense: Out of all the remaining teams in the playoffs, the Grizzlies arguably are the best defensive team. The tandem of Gasol and Randolph is great down low while in the backcourt Mike Conley and Tony Allen continue to harass the opponents.\n\nVeteran: Kenyon Dooling was a very nice pickup for Memphis\n\nRookie: Tony Wroten\n\nDepth: Much like the Nuggets trading away Carmelo Anthony, the Grizzlies trading Rudy Gay for multiple players has made them a better team and helped their depth by bringing in Ed Davis, Tayshaun Prince, Jon Leuer.\n\nCoach: Lionel Hollins, a savvy coach who has helped Memphis be a legit title contender\n\nWeakness: Inexperienced in the heart of the playoffs….if that makes sense\n\nOne Word to Describe Them: Reliant\n\n5. NY Knicks\n\nBig Three: JR Smith, Carmelo Anthony, Tyson Chandler\n\nThree Point Shooters: Like the Heat, Knicks are very deep in the three point shooters category which includes Jason Kidd, Raymond Felton, JR Smith, Iman Shumpert, Steve Novak, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Copeland\n\nBigs: Tyson Chandler, Amare Stoudamire, Kenyon Martin\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: 6th Man of the Year, JR Smith, Kenyon Martin, Steve Novak\n\nDefense: Although their playing style is similar to that when Mike D’Antoni was the coach, their defense has vastly improved; JR Smith and Raymond Felton have picked it up which only makes them stronger.\n\nVeterans: Quentin Richardson, Marcus Camby\n\nRookie: 35 year old, Pablo Prigioni\n\nDepth: With Amare Stoudamire’s injury, the depth has decreased but he is set to come back soon. Knicks are decently deep and most of their bench players can score more than 10 points in any given game.\n\nCoach: Mike Woodson aka Mike D’Antoni v2. While Mike D’Antoni has no defense, Mike Woodson’s style of play is similar but he actually has defense.\n\nWeakness: JR Smith’s shooting ways and Carmelo’s iso.\n\nOne Word To Describe Them: Streaky\n\n6. Indiana Pacers\n\nBig Three: Paul George, George Hill, David West\n\nThree Point Shooters: George Hill, Paul George, DJ Augustin, Danny Granger (if he comes back this season)\n\nBigs: Much like the Grizzlies duo, the Pacers duo is David West and Roy Hibbert. Imagine a 2v2 game consisting of Gasol and Randolph versus Hibbert and West. The former would win though.\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: Getting away from the Bobcats did wonders for Augustin. Others include Tyler Hansbrough, Sam Young, Gerald Green\n\nDefense: Similar to the Grizzlies since the Pacers also rely on their duo, but the Pacers do not have a defensive minded back court, but George has been nice on defense.\n\nVeterans: This team is pretty young so the veterans are David West and Ian Mahinmi\n\nRookie: Ben Hansbrough and Orlando Johnson\n\nDepth: Pretty thin at the SG position but if Granger were to come back George could easily play shooting guard with Granger playing small forward.\n\nCoach: Frank Vogel, a no-nonsense coach that has been very successful with this Indiana team\n\nWeakness: Similar to Grizzlies. Inexperienced as they go deeper into the playoffs.\n\nOne Word to Describe Them: Forceful\n\n7. GS Warriors\n\nBig Three: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Stephen Curry,\n\nThree Point Shooters: Curry, Thompson, Harrison Barnes, Jarrett Jack\n\nBigs: David Lee, injured and playing, Andrew Bogut, Andris Biedrins, Carl Landry, Draymond Green\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: Jarrett Jack has been huge for the Warriors this season, Carl Landry and Draymond Green have complemented Curry and Thompson well also.\n\nDefense: Out of all the teams remaining, possible the worst defensive teams as they have let their opponents score almost 105 points per game and only forced less than 14 turnovers per game. Nonetheless, if they want to win it all, they will have to crank it up on defense and not only look to outscore their opponents.\n\nVeterans: Jarrett Jack, Richard Jefferson\n\nRookie: Draymond Green and Harrison Barnes\n\nDepth: Warriors are a deep team all across the board but once again there defense is not too great\n\nCoach: Mark Jackson, I liked him as a TV analyst and I like him as a coach.\n\nWeakness: Young and Inexperienced.\n\nOne Word to Describe Them: Driven\n\n8. Chicago Bulls\n\nBig Three: Nate Robinson, Jimmy Butler, Joakim Noah\n\nThree Point Shooters: Nate Robinson, Marco Belinelli, Kirk Hinrich\n\nBigs: Joakim Noah, Taj Gibson, Carlos Boozer, Nazr Mohammed\n\nHigh Energy Guys off the Bench: When Derrick Rose was playing, Robinson held this title but with Robinson starting lately, Taj Gibson has been great off the bench.\n\nDefense: Well rounded defense in the front court with Noah, Gibson and Butler. Coach Thibs is a great defensive minded coach.\n\nVeterans: Hinrich and Richard Hamilton\n\nRookie: Jimmy Butler out of Marquette, doing a very well job on opposing small forwards.\n\nDepth: Not as they were a few years ago, nonetheless, very experienced team.\n\nCoach: Tom Thibodeau is a very great person and even better coach. If he had Derrick Rose, Bulls would be vying for the top seed in the East.\n\nWeakness: Lack of Derrick Rose\n\nOne Word to Describe Them: Desperate\n\nNBA Playoffs – Round 1 Preview and Predictions\n\nFirst off I would like to say that the prayers and best wishes of the iSportsLife team are with the people of Boston and anyone else who was affected by the horrible events of yesterdays bombings.\n\nAlso I would like to extend my condolences to the Summerall family. NFL HOF broadcaster Pat Summerall passed away today. He covered the NFL for 41 years.\n\nThe NBA Playoffs begin this weekend and we can’t wait! This years playoffs are definitely going to be special even in the first round!\n\nEastern Conference Standings*\n\nMiami Heat (65-16) – clinched number 1 in the East – homecourt throughout playoffs\n\nNew York Knicks (53-28) – clinched number 2 in the East\n\nIndiana Pacers (49-31) – clinched number 3 in the East\n\nBrooklyn Nets (48-33) – clinched number 4 in East\n\nAtlanta Hawks (44-36) – .5 game ahead of Bulls for number 5 spot in East – 2 games left (April 16 vs. Raptors, April 17 @ Knicks)\n\nChicago Bulls (44-37) – .5 game behind Hawks for number 5 spot in East – owns the tiebreaker (won season series 2-1) – 1 game left (April 17 vs Wizards)\n\nBoston Celtics (41-39) – clinched number 7 in East\n\nMilwaukee Bucks (37-44) – clinched number 8 in East\n\nRecap: For the Bulls to take over the number 5 spot: they need to beat Washington and have Atlanta lose 1 of their 2 games, or if the Bulls lose, then the Hawks have to lose both of their remaining games.\n\nPrediction: I think the Hawks will keep hold of the number 5 spot and the Bulls will stay in 6th.\n\nFirst Round Matchups:\n\nMiami Heat vs. Milwaukee Bucks – Miami has played some legendary basketball this year! They have shown that even without their Big 3, they would still be a playoff team! Last night they beat the Cavaliers without LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, Mario Chalmers, Shane Battier, and Udonis Haslem. They even started Juwan Howard! The Bucks have given Miami some good games though so it will be some fun. The backcourt duo of Jennings-Ellis is one of nightmares and the addition of JJ “Just Jumpers” Redick will definitely make it somewhat interesting. But in the end, they don’t have the talent level that Miami has and will ultimately lose.\n\nMiami in 5\n\nNew York Knicks vs. Boston Celtics – WOW!! This is definitely going to be a great series! The matchups across the board are great and I expect the Knicks to remember the early exit that Boston gave them in 2011. It will be interesting to see how the series turns out as the Celtics are still one of the better defending teams in the league, especially at the perimeter where the Knicks get most of their points from. In fact the Celtics have the 3rd best perimeter defense in the league only allowing 33.9% of them to go in! But the Knicks still have the advantage in my opinion. Carmelo Anthony has played at an élite level and JR Smith has actually been playing smart and on both ends of the court! If the Celtics had Rondo, I might change my mind, but until then I say Knicks win.\n\nKnicks in 6\n\nIndiana Pacers vs. Chicago Bulls – I don’t think I have ever seen a playoff series that will be this physical! Both teams are extremely aggressive and will pound away at each other for the entire series. Pacers have really stepped up because of the great play by Paul George and other great cast members who will be able to score inside and out. Meanwhile the Bulls have a great frontcourt in Deng, Boozer, and Noah who will be banging with anyone who gets in their way. The x-factors for this series comes down to 2 people: Roy Hibbert and Derrick Rose. Both of these players have the potential to send their team into the next round. If Roy Hibbert plays at the AllStar level that we have seen him play at, it will be a completely different series! Him and Noah are two defense first centers who can also score in a number of ways, but this season Hibbert seems to have forgotten how to play. Rose on the other hand may finally return and be just what his team needs. He is still an MVP and with his team playing this well without him, he should definitely be a huge addition to the Bulls chances! If Derrick Rose comes back, the Bulls win it. But as of right now, it seems like he is waiting until next season so I have to give this one to the Pacers.\n\nPacers in 7\n\nBrooklyn Nets vs Atlanta Hawks – This is 4v5 playoff situation that really seems one-sided to me… Brooklyn has killed it since the AllStar break and it has come down to the crazy play of Deron Williams and Brook Lopez. The Hawks will still have Al Horford and Josh Smith as a great tandem that will trouble the Nets from time-to-time, but then Smith will start shooting some jumpers and it will be over for them. Also, how do you think the Hawks fans will react to Joe Johnson playing against them in his first year out of ATL?\n\nNets in 6\n\nWestern Conference Standings*\n\nOklahoma City Thunder (60-21) – clinched number 1 in West\n\nSan Antonio Spurs (58-23) – clinched number 2 in West\n\nDenver Nuggets (56-25) – clinched homecourt in first round\n\nLos Angeles Clippers (54-26) – clinched at least number 4 in West – may or may not have homecourt in first round\n\nMemphis Grizzlies (55-26) – clinched number 5 in West – may or may not have homecourt in first round\n\nGolden State Warriors (46-35) – clinched playoff spot in West\n\nHouston Rockets (45-36) – clinched playoff spot in West\n\nLos Angeles Lakers (44-37) – .5 game ahead of Utah Jazz for number 8 spot – 1 game left (April 17 vs Houston)\n\nUtah Jazz (43-38) – .5 game behind Los Angeles Lakers for last playoff spot in West – owns the tiebreaker (won season series 2-1) – 1 game left (April 17 vs Grizzlies)\n\nRecap: Denver will clinch the number 3 seed if they win against Phoenix on Wednesday, or if the Clippers lose either of their two remaining games (tonight vs Portland, tomorrow @ Sacremento). The Clippers won`t fall below 4 because they have the division title but they will not have homecourt advantage if the Grizzlies have a better record than them. The Warriors will clinch the 6 spot if they beat the Trailblazers tomorrow, but if they lose and the Rockets beat the Lakers, they will end up in 7th and give up the 6th spot to Houston. Houston would end up in 8th if they lose to the Lakers. Now here is the part everyone is waiting for… The Lakers-Jazz drama! The Lakers will be in 8th if they lose to the Rockets and the Jazz lose too. They get the 7th spot if the beat the Rockets. They miss the playoffs if they lose to the Rockets and the Jazz beat the Grizzlies. So the Jazz essentially need to beat the Grizzlies and hope that the Lakers lose to get into the playoffs.\n\nPredictions: I say Denver finishes 3rd, the Clippers get homecourt advantage, Warriors get the 6 spot, Houston gets the 7th spot and Utah… makes the playoffs. Without Kobe, I don’t think the Lakers can pull it off.\n\nFirst Round Matchups:\n\nOklahoma City Thunder vs Utah Jazz – After a long and hard season for the Jazz, they are met by the defending Western Conference champs in the first round. Unfortunately for Utah, the frontcourt monsters of Al Jefferson, Paul Millsap, and Derrick Favors are not going to be enough to best Kevin Durant, Russell Westbrook, and Serge Ibaka. This series will be over before you know it.\n\nThunder in 4\n\nSan Antonio Spurs vs Houston Rockets – This matchup will be very interesting. The Spurs are one of the teams that have some very solid players in their starting 5 and on their bench but many of them are quite old. Houston has the younger and more energetic lineups. It will be interesting to see how the trio of Harden, Lin, and Asik match up against a well rested Spurs team that also signed Tracy McGrady earlier today. The Spurs will definitely take it though. Tim Duncan and Tony Parker didn’t come back to the playoffs to be upset again.\n\nSpurs in 6\n\nDenver Nuggets vs Golden State Warriors – The Warriors are one of the most exciting young teams in the league. The lights out shooters in Steph Curry and Klay Thompson in the backcourt accompanied by the frontcourt of AllStar David Lee, Andrew Bogut and the explosive rookie Harrison Barnes is scary. They have struggled a little later in the season but I do expect Stephen Curry’s playoff début to be a memorable one. The Nuggets have an automatic homecourt advantage living a mile high. But the loss of Danilo Gallinari and the injury to Kenneth Faried (day-to-day) may affect them in a negative way. They have been pretty strong without Danilo so far, but the Nuggets will need key players to step up on the offensive end if they want to beat the Warriors. In the end, I say the Warriors upset the Nuggets.\n\nWarriors in 6\n\nLos Angeles Clippers vs Memphis Grizzlies – This is going to be a fun series to watch. The Grizzlies have been playing very well as of late and the dynamic duo of Defensive Player of the Year candidate Marc Gasol and Zack Randolph vs the high-flying duo of Blake Griffin and a much improved Deandre Jordan will be scary to watch! I think this one will be the closest of any of the series in the first round with both teams playing hard in the paint. Grizzlies have the best defense in the NBA and the Clippers have one of the more potent offenses in the league. In the end; defense will win and with Vinny Del Negro as the Clippers coach, I don’t think that the Clippers have much of a chance.\n\nGrizzlies in 7\n\nAgree or disagree? Comment below!"
