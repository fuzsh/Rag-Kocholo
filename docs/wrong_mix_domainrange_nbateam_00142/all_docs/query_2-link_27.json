        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO — When this franchise relocated here from Philadelphia in 1962, it had the good sense to stuff Wilt Chamberlain in an extra-large suitcase and bring him along. He was only the most dominant force in the league, and therefore the face of the team and suddenly, the new city. He was, in the sense of impact, the Stephen Curry of his day, only slightly taller.\n\nHe was also a center, and with very few exceptions in the 60 seasons since then, that was the only time the Warriors threw the ball to the big man.\n\nChris Washburn, Adonal Foyle, Ekpe Udoh and Todd Fuller. They were taken by the Warriors in the Draft lottery, and soon left without leaving much of an impression, or a memory.\n\nRalph Sampson and DeMarcus Cousins. They were All-Stars and foundational pieces … for their previous teams. Once Warriors, they were older and just keeping the seat warm for the next guy.\n\nJaVale McGee, Andris Biedrins, Andrew Bogut, Zaza Pachulia, David West, Jordan Bell and Kevon Looney. These were recent centers during the Curry era, only because the position had to be filled — and the Warriors ran zero plays for any of them.\n\nOverall, aside from Hall of Famer Nate Thurmond, the quality of Warriors centers since Chamberlain could be described as decent at best, dreadful at worst, which brings us to the latest candidate to finally break the chain or become the next link.\n\nHere’s the issue: The Warriors just don’t know exactly where James Wiseman stands here in 2022-23, as he prepares to get a second chance to make a first impression.\n\nHe’s bringing the necessary ingredients: 7-foot size, hops, agility, youth (only 21), a willingness to learn, work ethic and — after a pair of injury interruptions — plenty of giddyup and anxiousness. Wiseman’s rosy personality is infectious and goes over well in the locker room and among the coaching staff.\n\nHe says: “I’m a competitive dude. I want to be out there. I want to make my mark, help my team win, be the best. That’s my approach.”\n\nOf course, until further notice, he remains a league mystery because he lacks a track record after just 43 games through two-plus seasons. As for what’s inside the crystal ball, he concedes: “That’s the unknown. I can’t answer that. I’m just going to do what I can.”\n\nWiseman played 39 games as the No. 2 overall pick in 2020 before knee surgery canceled his season early. Last season was a wash after a relapse convinced the Warriors to play it safe and shut him down. That’s a hard swallow for a young player trying to get traction, only to see a roundtrip to rehab and a seat on the bench in street clothes. It’s similar to what Zion Williamson went through in New Orleans and what rookie Chet Holmgren is going through now in Oklahoma City.\n\nI had a lot of hurt inside of me that was stealing my spirit over and over because I couldn’t play.”\n\n— Warriors center James Wiseman\n\nWilliamson and Holmgren, like Wiseman, were high Draft picks. The difference is Wiseman wasn’t slotted as a savior because the Warriors, then and now, are championship-built. If anything, Wiseman was a bonus: a lottery luxury that is rarely afforded to a consistent winner. In that sense, it was a perfect union: Wiseman could join a dynasty without any burden or pressure to produce right away (especially since big men typically take longer to develop).\n\nWhat made that situation even better for Wiseman’s development? After an NCAA probe limited his career at the University of Memphis to three games, he hadn’t played a full season of basketball since his senior year of high school. Still hasn’t, actually.\n\n“Crazy, I know,” he said.\n\nThe goal, then, was for Wiseman to gradually play his way into the rotation as a rookie and then, the starting lineup. Ideally, by now, he would be a major piece of the flow as the Warriors blend the new with the old. Except he finds himself back at the starting line, two years after being drafted.\n\nWiseman did play in the 2022 NBA Summer League and a stint in the NBA G League before this season’s tip. Both were necessary warmup acts. And what the Warriors have seen in the four games since his return gives them confidence.\n\n“He’s been much better this year than he was two years ago, and he should be,” said Warriors coach Steve Kerr. “He’s had a summer league, he’s had a training camp, he’s working every day and he’s healthy. He’s starting to feel a little more comfortable with his role.”\n\nHe did drop hints before the injury. Wiseman showed hustle, some scrap and decent instincts around the rim despite being inconsistent. His jumper is still under construction and Wiseman needs to get comfortable shooting beyond the paint. Also, for a big, getting 5.7 rebounds per game — his career average — is on the low end. Otherwise, Wiseman is good on the screen and roll and did average 11.5 ppg as a rookie on 51.9% shooting. By comparison, last season’s prized rookie big man, Evan Mobley of the Cleveland Cavaliers, averaged 15 ppg on 50.8% shooting with far more touches … and everyone raved.\n\nThe Warriors did have choices with the No. 2 pick and took Wiseman one slot ahead of the eventual Kia Rookie of the Year, LaMelo Ball. The thinking was Wiseman had just as much potential as Ball, he was the top-ranked player coming out of high school and the Warriors’ most obvious need was a big man (not a guard who wouldn’t start ahead of Curry or Klay Thompson).\n\nAll that stuff happened and it was out of my control. … But my adversity made me stronger as a person. I became a better person because of everything.”\n\n— James Wiseman\n\nStill, Wiseman found it tough to sit and watch while others in his Draft class gained experience, and also have a front-row seat at the Warriors’ 2022 championship climb without him.\n\nHe turned to writing — both in a diary and poetry — to pass the time and clear his mind.\n\n“I was just writing in my journal, writing down expressions and how I felt,” he said, “and I wasn’t feeling all that great. It was tough. I had a lot of hurt inside of me that was stealing my spirit over and over because I couldn’t play. I’d write poetry, watch film, write some more, watch more film and read a lot of books.”\n\nThe lack of action, both in college and the NBA, came at an obvious professional cost.\n\n“All that stuff happened and it was out of my control,” he said. “I think it delayed my development as a player. But my adversity made me stronger as a person. I became a better person because of everything.”\n\nWiseman is currently Looney’s backup and the Warriors are taking a gradual approach with him. He has a pair of upcoming games against the Miami Heat’s Bam Adebayo, starting Thursday (10 ET, NBA TV). He’s also fresh off matching up against two-time Kia MVP Nikola Jokic and the Phoenix Suns’ Deandre Ayton, another highly-drafted center whose development was gradual.\n\nThe Warriors hope to see defensive improvement from Wiseman, who has the size and length necessary for rim protection, but is in the process of piecing that all together.\n\n“He understands verticality and isn’t trying to block every shot now,” Kerr said. “He’s got so much physical ability. It’s all there for him to be an excellent defender. It’s fun to watch him progress.”\n\nThis is a crucial season if only because the Warriors need to put a price on him in the near future. He’ll become extension-eligible next summer. Of those taken in his Draft, at least six first-rounders can expect some action on that front: Ball, Anthony Edwards, Tyrese Haliburton, Saddiq Bey, Desmond Bane and Tyrese Maxey (and maybe Cole Anthony, too).\n\nWiseman can play his way into the mix if he works his way into the starting lineup and enhances his role, mainly on the glass and off screens. It’s unlikely he’ll see his number called often — there are too many scorers on this team for that — but becoming a big man who takes advantage of limited opportunities will help.\n\n“These first few games I’m trying to prove to myself that I can still play against NBA talent,” Wiseman said. “It’s about going out there and working hard every day. I’ll get to where I need to be.”\n\n* * *\n\nShaun Powell has covered the NBA for more than 25 years.
