        "text": "Teams have been adding players, subtracting players and seeking to find the right mix in efforts to reach the mountaintop and procure the Larry O'Brien trophy (at left).\n\nSide note: Is there a Bleacher Creature who can name who Larry O'Brien was and why the championship trophy is named after him? No Google allowed.\n\nAnyway, after seeing the many moves teams have made, I am going to look at six contenders who are very close, but still in need of that one player (whom I'll name) to push them over the top. These will not be the obvious \"trade Tim Duncan to the Knicks\" sort of moves (except one). They'll be more subtle, yet still critical to getting the ultimate trophy.\n\nHopefully, this will entertain you and show how close some teams are.\n\nChris Bosh cannot/will not do it. Udonis Haslem is not big enough. Zydrunas Ilgauskas is too old and slow, and no one else merits a mention.\n\nHowever, if Pat Riley could somehow get Golden State to give up Andris Biedrins, a legit 6'11\" center who does rebound, block shots, score a little inside and play with energy, then the Heat would be a lock to come out of the East.\n\nI don't know what pieces could be traded to accommodate his salary—upwards of $10 million per—but if Riley can get the Superfriends together, maybe he can pull this one off.\n\nAlternate: FA Center Sean Williams. He is playing overseas in China. I would have to think he would jump at the chance to play NBA ball and enjoy the game back here in the States.\n\nA young big (C/PF) is needed in Denver. The crew manning those spots need someone else who can come in, throw his body around, catch and give out some rebounds and elbows, and mix it up.\n\nIdeally, between Nene, Kenyon Martin, Chris Andersen and Al Harrington, one could say it's all there. And maybe it is, but I would feel a little more comfortable with one more quality big in there.\n\nI'm sorry, Shelden Williams, but you don't exactly fit what I have in mind.\n\nNow, Jason Maxiell of the Pistons does, though.\n\nHe is undersized at 6'7\", but as Glen Davis in Boston shows, if you play with enough force and strength, the lack of height can be minimized. In Davis' case, he uses his 280 lbs, in Maxiell's case, his 260 lbs are punctuated by his incredible athleticism.\n\nHe does not mind doing the dirty work for a few minutes, and his contract gives him some security. Now all the unnamed Denver GM has to do is parcel together a couple of contracts and a first-round pick—which would hopefully be low—to mitigate his cost.\n\nAlternate: FA Power Forward Louis Amundson. A two-year deal could probably keep this active big in his native Rocky Mountain region.\n\nKeep in mind: With Tiago Splitter and Antonio McDyess on the team, the center spot is well-manned, Duncan and DeJuan Blair have the PF positon on lock and Richard Jefferson is the SF for the team.\n\nEvery team has that point in the game, series, and season where a player that comes in and changes the flow is needed. A SF off the bench that posts up or a \"stretch\" big man that can stroke the jumper from outside: Those players can decide a key game or series.\n\nWith that in mind, I feel that Darrell Arthur, currently of the Grizzlies, would be perfect here. He has not been more than a small contributor in Memphis. Admittedly, I don't know if they would trade a young asset to a divisional foe, but Memphis has been known to make questionable deals.\n\nWith Arthur not exactly being a world-beater on Beale Street, perhaps the San Antonio brass can dangle Curtis Jerrells (PG), Garrett Temple (SG) and a first-round pick in front of Memphis.\n\nAlternate: Portland forward Dante Cunningham. He is an ideal tweener who, as the fifth forward on Portland's roster, could be obtained if Arthur cannot be.\n\nWilson Chandler could be just what the doctor ordered. The slasher deluxe from DePaul, would add the finisher that CJ Miles is sometimes, Andrei Kirilenko used to be, and no one else on the Jazz roster can be.\n\nHow could the Jazz pry Chandler from the Knicks? Let's start with a 2011 first-round pick. The Knicks will be in acquisition mode—gunning for Carmelo Anthony—ASAP, so moving another SF is not out of the question. At his salary, finding a match on the Jazz roster may result in moving C.J. Miles, perhaps Sundiata Gaines, and a future draft pick.\n\nBut it would be so worth it, as it gives the Jazz an ability they have not seen since the days of Darrell Griffith, Dr. Dunkenstein himself, a player who is a consistent threat to attack the basket at any point in the game.\n\nAlternate: Cleveland Cavalier small forward Jamario Moon. As he was an acquisition sought to appease a former player now residing in South Beach, a future draft pick may be the only thing needed to procure this dynamic jumping jack who also defends like a madman.\n\nA big problem was that aside from Dwight Howard, there was very little production from the frontcourt, and definitely little to no production from the wings, outside of the massive number of three pointers chucked from beyond the arc.\n\nEnter Mr. Carmelo Anthony. A 20-ppg scorer when he falls out of bed, he can end the struggles that the Magic endured against both the Lakers and Celtics. A post scorer on other SFs, and a fourth quarter producer—fifth in the NBA in fourth quarter scoring—Anthony can produce where Rashard Lewis and Vince Carter cannot.\n\nHe surely, along with Jameer Nelson and D. Howard, would give any team in the Finals reason to be concerned, eh?\n\nAlternate: N/A. Who else in the NBA can replicate what Anthony brings to the table? Maybe Danny Granger, but after the Darren Collison deal, I cannot see the Pacers moving him at all.\n\nThe problem is they've got a similar type of player from number 1 to 15. Not enough of their players do the dirty, old school kind of grunt work. Needless to say, the majority of all championship teams need a guy like that in the trenches. They traded that away with Eduardo Najera, not that he always delivered in that area, anyway.\n\nEnter one Reggie Evans. Not the most talented player by a long shot, but he does bring his hardhat, banging-in-the-low-post, almost dirty (ask Chris Kaman) type of power game. He can bring to the Mavs what Charles Oakley brought to the Bulls, Knicks and Raptors on a lower level, obviously.\n\nI would think that trading out DeShawn Stevenson could/should do the trick. Stevenson's production can be assumed by Rod Beaubois, once he returns from his foot injury playing for the French national team.\n\nAlternate: Cleveland Cavalier power forward Leon Powe. There appears to be a looming fire sale off of Lake Erie. The Mavs may be smart to inquire about his services, as his price tag (due to his low contract amount), would be less than Evans.\n\nThat didn't stop them from adding parts like Matt Barnes, Shaquille O'Neal, Jermaine O'Neal and Steve Blake, but the need was not necessarily there. Those moves will continue to allow them to be in front of all of the other NBA teams, come playoff time.\n\nThe 28 other teams in the league are trying to get to where these two are, and will be for the next couple of years. Everyone is playing catch up to them.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this brief show. As always, review, debate and enjoy!"
