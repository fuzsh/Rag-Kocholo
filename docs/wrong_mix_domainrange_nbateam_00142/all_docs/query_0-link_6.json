        "text": "Wes Goldberg: According to Warriors PR, James Wiseman is the third-youngest player ever to start for the Warriors. 1. Andris Biedrins (18 years, 352 days) 2. Anthony Randolph (19 years, 179 days) 3. James Wiseman (19 years, 266 days) That’s some company.\n\nBiedrins has played 505 games in the NBA with Warriors and 6 with Jazz averaging 6.3 points, 7 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game. His last year in the NBA was in 2013-2014. “I am staying in shape, nothing crazy, but I work out three-four times per week. It’s tough to say if I have put basketball aside. At the moment I don’t have wish to play. Maybe after half year or a year I will want to play, but not now”"
