        "text": "Each weekday morning, BDL serves up a handful of NBA-related stories to digest with your FrankenBerry.\n\nRusty Simmons, San Francisco Chronicle: \"Warriors coach Don Nelson couldn't help but deviate from his usual light and humorous interview before Monday night's 135-131 loss to New Orleans. The injury woes have gotten to the point that they're simply not funny anymore. 'If it wasn't for the tears,' Nelson said, 'I guess it would be funny.' That comment came following the Warriors' announcement that Andris Biedrins(notes) will have surgery to repair a tear in an abdominal muscle Tuesday, a procedure that will likely cost the center the rest of the season. The Warriors have already lost Kelenna Azubuike(notes) (knee) and Brandan Wright(notes) (shoulder) for the season. Biedrins, who is expected to miss four to six weeks, joins a group - Raja Bell(notes) (wrist), Vladimir Radmanovic(notes) (Achilles tendon) and Anthony Randolph(notes) (ankle) - that might be holding on to lost hope for a return.\"\n\nMike Wells, Indy Star: \"The trash talking started inside the Indiana Pacers' locker room shortly after college basketball began with Midnight Madness practices in October. The back-and-forth has continued all season and won't stop until somebody cuts down the nets at Lucas Oil Stadium on April 5. Brandon Rush(notes) thinks his Kansas Jayhawks will be hoisting the NCAA trophy for the second time in three seasons. Mike Dunleavy likes his Duke Blue Devils. And Danny Granger(notes) is pulling for his New Mexico Lobos. Tyler Hansbrough(notes) led North Carolina to the championship last season, but his Tar Heels have little hope of returning to defend their crown this year. 'The talking has been nonstop,' said point guard A.J. Price(notes), a rookie from Connecticut. 'Guys will let you know if they think your school is garbage. We've got a lot of guys that have played in the [NCAA] Tournament and reached the Final Four.' Ten Pacers reached at least the Sweet Sixteen. Seven made the Final Four and three cut down the nets.\"\n\nChris Tomasson, FanHouse: \"Brandon Roy is still thinking he could be a 2012 Olympian. So is his coach, and Portland's Nate McMillan just happens to be a USA Basketball assistant. Wanting to rest a surgically repaired left knee, Roy declined an offer last month to be on Team USA's roster, of which 27 players are in a pool to be selected for this year's World Championships in Turkey and the 2012 Olympics in London. But the Trail Blazers star said in an interview with FanHouse before Sunday's game against Denver he might welcome being a candidate for the 2012 Games if Team USA then needs a shooting guard. 'I still hope so,' Roy said of playing in the London Olympics. \"Besides winning the NBA championship, that also has been a dream of mine to have a gold medal. But I kind of had to choose right now (whether or not be on the roster). 'If there's a chance, I'm healthy and playing well and somebody can't play that year, you never know what happens. I would love to try to play. If they are looking for a reserve, I would raise my hand and say, \"Here I am.\" I would love to try then if the opportunity presents itself.'\"\n\nEddie Sefko, Dallas Morning News: \"The play of Roddy Beaubois this season and particularly of late has perked up the ears of the French Federation, which runs the French national basketball team that will compete in the World Championships this summer. Beaubois is from Guadeloupe, a French holding in the Caribbean, which makes him eligible for the French team, which already has five NBA players on it. However, San Antonio's Tony Parker(notes), out with a hand injury, has said he won't play this year. Could that open up a point guard spot for Beaubois? 'I got a call a few days ago, and they talked about coming here to talk about it,' he said Monday. 'We'll see when they come. But until then, I just try to focus on the season. If they come, we'll talk, and I will think about it.' Beaubois added that it would be 'an honor, for sure' to represent his country.\"\n\nBob Young, Arizona Republic: \"Leandro Barbosa, who had surgery on his right wrist six weeks ago, returned to practice, and {Alvin} Gentry hopes he'll be available to play against the Lakers. 'I'll speak with the trainers, but he'll do a little more contact stuff [Tuesday] and practice Thursday, and if everything is OK he should be ready to go, I would think.' Barbosa said his right arm is still 'a little weak' and there is some swelling, but he added that if he feels comfortable Thursday he likely will play Friday. 'I'm very hungry to come back and help my teammates,' he said. 'We'll see what happens.' \"\n\nBenjamin Hochman, Denver Post: \"The pain in Kenyon Martin's(notes) left knee was so bad Saturda, he couldn't play golf - 'that's my plant leg' - so the Nuggets forward spent the sunny day indoors, instead golfing on a Nintendo Wii video game. The pain has persisted, and now Martin will miss an undetermined amount of time while undergoing platelet rich plasma (PRP) therapy. He plans to return this season, although perhaps not until the NBA playoffs, the team announced Monday. Martin began the PRP therapy Monday. It's definitely a good news-bad news situation for the Nuggets (42-21), who rank third in the Western Conference. The good news is Martin won't require surgery on the knee, which is suffering from patella tendinitis. The bad news is the race in the West is tight and without Martin, the Nuggets will be without their 'defensive quarterback,' as coach George Karl calls him.\"\n\nJeff McDonald, San Antonio Express-News: \"Further examination of Tony Parker's injured shooting hand Monday revealed both the diagnosis and prognosis the Spurs had feared. Parker indeed has a non-displaced fracture of his fourth metacarpal and is expected to miss the next six weeks. Surgery will not be required. If he were to stick to that timeline precisely, Parker might return for the final three games of the regular season. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich, however, indicated the timeline might be fluid, depending upon how Parker's body responds. 'It might mean four to eight weeks,' Popovich said before Monday's 97-95 loss to the Cavaliers.\"\n\nChris Perkins, South Florida Sun-Sentinel: \"Former Heat guard Mike James(notes), who last month had his contract bought out and was then released by the Washington Wizards, said he would like to re-join the Heat. James, who played 93 games for the Heat over two seasons, from 2001 to 2003, is at home in Houston working out and hoping to be signed. James, who would be eligible for the playoff roster, said he would especially love to be in a playoff race. 'I want to get thrown in the fire, please,' he said Monday. 'Give me only three plays and if I don't do anything from there, if that's my only chance, I'll take that. Let me run with that right there.'\"\n\nESPN.com: \"Minnesota Timberwolves forward Ryan Hollins(notes) was ejected from the game against Dallas in the fourth quarter on Monday night after delivering a forearm to Dirk Nowitzki's(notes) head. After Nowitzki grabbed a rebound on the defensive end, Hollins threw his left forearm at Nowitzki's head, landing a glancing shot. Officials reviewed the play and assessed a Flagrant 2 foul, which brought the ejection.\"\n\nAP: \"Cavaliers forward Antawn Jamison(notes) [left] Cleveland's [Monday] game against San Antonio in the third quarter with stiffness behind his left knee. The Cavaliers provided a vague update on Jamison, who was recently acquired in a trade with Washington. Jamison did not appear to injure himself but walked gingerly to the locker room before being evaluated by Cleveland's medical staff.\""
