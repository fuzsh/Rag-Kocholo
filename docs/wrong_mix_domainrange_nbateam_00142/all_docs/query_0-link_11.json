        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS — The Golden State Warriors entered the fourth quarter Wednesday with a 14-point lead.\n\nThe Indiana Pacers were without starting point guard Jamaal Tinsley and All-Star power forward Jermaine O’Neal, and the rest of the team was stinking up Conseco Fieldhouse.\n\nThe Warriors had this game in the bag, right?\n\n“We fell apart at the end of the game,” forward Al Harrington said after totaling 22 points and six rebounds. “We were supposed to win this game, but we didn’t play the full 48 minutes. We did a great job in the first three quarters of hitting shots and building a lead. But we just fell apart. I didn’t think we’d be sitting in this locker room after the game with a loss.”\n\nBut they were.\n\nA 125-117 loss. A demoralizing, embarrassing loss.\n\nIt wasn’t so much that the Warriors, a contender in the Western Conference, were defeated by a struggling team from the lowly Eastern Conference. It was more how they lost, a tank job unbecoming a team that hasrepeatedly come through in the clutch this season.\n\nHow in the world can they get outscored 46-24 in the fourth quarter? Glad you asked.\n\nBoth teams took 22 shots. The Warriors made nine, the Pacers made 11. Two of the Warriors’ made baskets were from behind the arc. But Indiana knocked down seven 3-pointers, four by guard Kareem Rush. The Warriors missed 7 of 11 free throws. The Pacers made all 17 of theirs.\n\nThe Warriors totaled eight rebounds in the fourth quarter, four offensive. The Pacers had 18 rebounds, with five offensive boards leading to 12 second-chance points.\n\nAfter turning the ball over 22 times in the first three quarters, Indiana had just two in the final period. The Warriors, meanwhile, had three of their 11 turnovers in the fourth quarter, two coming at seemingly the worst possible time.\n\n“We were beaten by a better team in the fourth quarter,” said Warriors coach Don Nelson, whose team led by 17 in the third quarter.\n\nIndiana took just 5 minutes, 10 seconds to erase the Warriors’ 14-point lead entering the fourth. Forward Mike Dunleavy, who was jeered heavily in Oakland during the Warriors win on Sunday, converted a driving layup to cap a 13-3 Indiana run to start the quarter, forcing Nelson to call a timeout with his team ahead just 96-92 at the 8:36 mark.\n\nMonta Ellis turned over the ball out of the timeout, and Rush followed with a 3-pointer. Moments later, Rush connected from deep again, tying the game at 98 with 6:50 left. After a turnover by Warriors forward Stephen Jackson, Dunleavy found himself all alone for a 3-pointer. Nailed it.\n\nThe Pacers never trailed again.\n\n“We lost our concentration. Obviously, we didn’t play any defense,” said point guard Baron Davis, who finished with 24 points, seven assists, six rebounds, seven steals and two blocks before fouling out in the final minute.\n\n“Sometimes we just get frustrated, and it just snowballs. Tonight was one of those nights. All we had to do was go into that fourth quarter with a defensive mentality. It’s the worst feeling.”\n\nYou might say the Warriors had this coming. They’ve made a season of getting behind and rallying to victory, or building big leads and hanging on at the end. They came in 12-6 in games decided by single digits, and had eight wins when trailing after three.\n\nThe dangerous living caught up with them Wednesday. They now have been outscored in the fourth quarter in five of the last eight games. They are 4-4 in those games.\n\n“We’ve got to play a full game,” forward Matt Barnes said after one of his best games of the season with 18 points, nine rebounds and six assists in 35 minutes. “We haven’t been playing well for a while. We’ve been pulling games out at the end, and coach has been on us about it. Hopefully, this will be a wake-up call for us.”"
