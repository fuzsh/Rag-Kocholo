        "text": "They may travel on chartered jets, stay in the finest hotels and get $106 a day for food, but the Warriors suffer from some of the same problems as any frequent fliers: Colds. Disrupted sleep patterns. Time spent away from their homes.\n\nNot that they’re going to get a lot of sympathy for it.\n\nThe Warriors leave Monday morning for their last truly lengthy journey of the season, a five-game Eastern Conference tour with stops in Milwaukee, Chicago, New York, Washington, D.C., and Detroit before coming home.\n\nAnd while hitting that many cities in the span of eight days will be difficult, when an NBA team embarks on a road trip it travels in a style that most business travelers can only dream of.\n\nFlying high\n\nThe comfort begins at the airport, where the Warriors charter a specially retrofitted jet rather than dealing with the hassles of commercial air travel.\n\nTo get to any destination other than Sacramento, the Warriors fly on a Boeing 727 provided by Champion Air. The plane is configured with just 59 seats, less than half as many as it had when it was in commercial use by Northwest Airlines.\n\nMost NBA teams have similar arrangements, although Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, dissatisfied with the quality of food on charter planes, purchased a 757 for his team to use exclusively.\n\nOn the Warriors’ flights, the players’ section at the front of the plane houses the 18 largest seats. They can recline almost fully to make beds for the players.\n\n“It’s pretty nice,” Warriors center Andris Biedrins said. “It’s really got a lot of space, especially for the big guys. It’s got a lot of space to sit, and we can extend our legs. It’s pretty easy.”\n\nThere’s also a 3-seat couch on the plane that Troy Murphy used to sleep on, but equipment and travel manager Eric Housen has been able to reclaim that territory for himself now that Murphy is a member of the Indiana Pacers.\n\nTo avoid one more annoyance, the Warriors often undergo TSA screening at the arena. That allows the team’s bus to drive right onto the tarmac and drop the players off at the plane.\n\n“It’s the worst,” Warriors forward Al Harrington said of re-joining the ranks of “regular” fliers. “That’s when you know it’s officially summer, that first (commercial) plane ride.”\n\nHigh-end hotels\n\nThe pampering doesn’t stop with the plane. After hopping on a bus that greets the team on the tarmac at their destination airport, the players are whisked to their hotel. And the Warriors’ roster of accommodations reads like something straight off a movie star’s itinerary. Often, it’s a high-end chain such as Ritz-Carlton, or maybe a locally renowned boutique location.\n\nHousen will lay out nearly $1,000 in tips to a cadre of bellhops who swarm over the Warriors’ bags. Players stay one to a room, and some will see nothing but the inside of their beds for most of their stay.\n\n“It’s like a cocoon,” Warriors center Adonal Foyle said. “You come in at 3 in the morning (from a plane flight), or you go to practice, or you go to shootaround, and then you’re back in your room. It has to be a Herculean effort just to go and watch a movie.”\n\nSaid Biedrins: “The only thing you want to do is sit in your room or sleep, take a nap or something like that. You don’t want to go anywhere.”\n\nHeading out\n\nSome players do make like Hercules and pull themselves off the bed. After all, the $106 they get in per diem meal money isn’t going to spend itself.\n\nRookie guard Kelenna Azubuike said he may go out and do some sightseeing when the Warriors hit New York on Thursday. Foyle, the 10th-year veteran, has a plan for many cities; in New York, he’s going out to dinner with friends to discuss politics and in Washington, he wants to visit the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n\nAnd on evenings when the team doesn’t have a game, players will avail themselves of that city’s nightlife — up to a point, at least.\n\nBiedrins said the key is to achieve equilibrium between blowing off steam and staying out too late.\n\n“Everybody wants to go out and have fun or whatever, but you have to think about it professionally,” Biedrins said. “You have to rest. I remember my first year, too. It was just hard. The first couple of years, you just have to understand how the system works, when you can go out or when you need to rest, and all those type of things.”\n\nHarrington agrees, noting that it took him into his second season to find a sense of balance.\n\n“My first season, I didn’t really play and I was on a team full of old guys, so none of them really went out anyway,” said Harrington, who’s finishing his ninth year in the league. “But the next year, I was hanging out with Jalen Rose a little bit, and I just couldn’t do it.”\n\nNo curfew\n\nAlthough Warriors coach Don Nelson has used a curfew in the past, the Warriors do not have any set hour they need to be back at the hotel.\n\n“With the new travel arrangements, we leave right after the game, get in late into the (next) city, and most people have already done whatever they need to do to get down after a game,” Nelson said. “They’ve done that on the plane, so when we get in, most guys are tired and go to bed. They’re not going to go out. The bars are already closed.”\n\nThat being said, Nelson isn’t just going to let his players run wild.\n\n“I coach men, and I respect that fact,” Nelson said. “But if they abuse (the lack of a curfew), I’ll have one here. If I find out people are staying out late or something like that, it’s a totally different deal.”\n\nCatching Z’s\n\nWith so many creature comforts, the toughest part of the travel is catching up on shut-eye.\n\n“For me, it’s really tough to manage sleep,” Warriors forward Mickael Pietrus said. “Usually I fall asleep at 11 (p.m.), and I feel like I’m taking a nap on San Francisco time. Then I wake up and I don’t want to sleep anymore. Then comes an injury. That’s what I’m scared about: getting hurt because you don’t get enough sleep.”\n\nSaid Foyle: “I tell people that I don’t sleep for six months. I just take naps. … It’s really true. There’s just so many things that disrupt your patterns. Sleep is all about routine, and the NBA season is anything but. It’s routine in its chaos, not routine in its routine.”\n\nIf things are going badly on its home court, a team may need a road trip just to get away from the pressure of turning things around.\n\n“Sometimes you just want to relax and not be bothered,” Biedrins said. “Sometimes it’s really nice you can go somewhere and people don’t know who you are. That’s a good thing.”\n\nBut while the road represents an opportunity for anonymity, it also can be a dangerous place. With Saturday’s loss to the Clippers in Los Angeles, the Warriors are just 6-21 on the road, the second-worst record in the NBA.\n\n“There might be a tough crowd, you might have an off night, you might not be used to the rims,” Warriors guard Jason Richardson said. “It could be a number of things. But that’s what separates the good teams from the bad teams: Winning on the road. You’ve just got to find a way. You can’t make excuses.”\n\nBesides, who’s going to listen to them?"
