        "text": "OAKLAND — I can’t imagine trying to type this column without any feeling in my fingertips.\n\nOh, I’ve had chilly knuckles before and played through it, typos be damned. But, no feeling in the fingers? That’d be tough.\n\nThat’s how Stephen Jackson tried doing his job Sunday night for the Warriors. The results were nearly disastrous. Nearly, is the key word. The Warriors won. Jackson wasn’t the goat. And, as he put it, “My teammates carried me tonight.”\n\nI, along with 19,044 of my closest friends at Oracle Arena, knew Jackson had a cold shooting night. I just didn’t know how cold until after the Warriors escaped with a 106-101 win over the Indiana Pacers.\n\nHe woke up Sunday with flu-like symptoms. Like most viruses, things can get nasty. For Jackson, that meant losing his shooting touch, which, to begin with, hasn’t been too great this season.\n\n“I knew I wasn’t feeling well because my hands were freezing,” Jackson said. “That’s never happened to me before.”\n\nAnd it seemed he could never make a shot Sunday night. That put a crimp on the hyped reunion with his old team, who shipped Jackson to the Warriors last Jan. 17 as part of the eight-player trade that sparked the Warriors’ epic playoff run.\n\nSo, why in the heck, did he play a team-high 421/2 minutes when he made only 4-of-15 field-goal attempts AND was battling The Fingertip Flu?\n\n“We’re not very deep on our bench, and we need him because of his brain, because of his defensive presence,” Warriors coach Don Nelson said. “This team doesn’t function well unless he’s on the floor quite a bit.\n\n“Even in a bad performance, I think it’s important he’s on the floor.”\n\nHow bad was it? He was 3-of-11 in the first half.\n\nBut, as Nelson noted, the Warriors still needed him. And while Jackson’s fingers felt like they were on Mt. Everest, he at least didn’t experience a brain freeze.\n\nHe stopped shooting. Not altogether — he bricked a 3-point attempt in the final minute — but he slowed up enough to let the Warriors rally and take over down the stretch.\n\n“I couldn’t get a rhythm, so I just wanted to get the ball to Monta and (Baron Davis),” said Jackson, who had nine points, seven rebounds and three assists. “I just wanted to get rebounds and play defense.”\n\nEllis and Davis responded with magnificent fourth quarters, combining for 16 much-needed points that period. Ellis finished with 29 points, Davis with 27.\n\n“In the fourth quarter, I had the confidence to make the easy shots,” Ellis said.\n\nEasy? Like the spinning reverse layup? “Yeah, when you concentrate,” Ellis responded.\n\nHe and Davis were the heroes. They saved the Warriors from losing to Mike Dunleavy, their 2002 first-round draft bust. Dunleavy scored 18 points, and that’s also how many times the crowd yelled “Boo” at him in the first half. Jackson blew past Dunleavy for a nice dunk in the first quarter. But Jackson then fell into one of those reckless zones where he’ll keep shooting no matter how bad the last shot missed.\n\n“I’ve been known to hit a lot of clutch shots in my career,” said Jackson, who scored 33 points and made seven 3-pointers in last season’s series-clinching win over Dallas in the playoffs. “The way I look at it, the next one is going to fall. I know I’m not the best shooter in the league, but I’m confident I’ll hit the next shot.”\n\nThat confidence gave way to his fingers’ chill factor, however.\n\nHe even resorted to hot packs, rubbing his hands with those pads — typically used on players’ knees and legs — near the Warriors bench during breaks in the second half.\n\nDid that work? “It helped for a minute or so,” Jackson responded.\n\nWell, a minute or so after he used the hot pads late in the third quarter, he hit a jumper — his final bucket — to put the Warriors ahead 71-70. Beside the pads, he also constantly blew into his right hand while on the court.\n\nWhen he blew some hot air at a referee, he earned a technical foul with 8:08 remaining in the game. That wasn’t smart. But he didn’t get ejected, like the old Stack Jack might have.\n\nTeammate Al Harrington, who co-headlined the Jan. 17 deal with the Pacers, struggled, too. He made only 6-of-19 field-goal attempts, making him and Jackson a combined 10-for-34 from the field.\n\nWhen Jackson missed two free throws early in the third quarter, one fan shouted into the quiet arena: “God (dang) it, Jackson, what’s a matta with you?”\n\nTurns out Jackson was cold. Really cold.\n\nAnd Nelson’s insistence on keeping him out there showed you just how reliant they are on Jackson, in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health."
