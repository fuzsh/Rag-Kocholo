        "text": "The Detroit Pistons have entered their first significant week of individual workouts for prospects in the NBA Draft four weeks away, the coaching search is winding down (hopefully), and readers have retained an elevated curiosity about the impending summer of change in this week's version of \"Ask David\" about all things Piston.\n\nIt makes me wonder how curious you'd be if this team ever gets good.\n\nFor inclusion in next week's version, email your questions to dmayo@mlive.com and put \"Ask David\" in the subject line.\n\nAnd so we begin:\n\nQ: Hello David, I appreciate the continued coverage of the Pistons franchise. My question, will the draft prospects who conduct private workouts for the Pistons be made publically known? There's a lot of possibilities of who they may take with the No. 8 pick and maybe who they do and do not bring for workouts could give us fans a clearer outlook. -- Mark\n\nA: This week started the first big workout period for the Pistons, with clusters scheduled early and late in the week. Media are not permitted to watch the workouts and the practice facility is on privately owned property. Once or twice before the draft, the Pistons typically release lists of players who work out for them, but they usually only acknowledge lesser-known prospects. For potential lottery picks, the Pistons are more tight-lipped, but information about who works out for them usually leaks, whether from the prospects themselves, agents, or team or league sources.\n\nAnd sometimes, the workouts don't apply. Remember, last year, the Pistons didn't have Andre Drummond in for a pre-draft workout, and ended up doing the grill-and-drill with him in a secret session at a New York gym two nights before the draft, after Pistons president Joe Dumars learned he might slip to No. 9. He did, and the Pistons drafted him, though Dumars acknowledged he would have selected Drummond even if the 11th-hour workout couldn't be arranged.\n\nQ: Who are the soon-to-be free agents the Pistons might consider signing if they A) Draft a point guard; or, B) Don't draft a point guard? -- Gregory A. Bishop\n\nA: We've discussed free-agent possibilities extensively and I suspect the potential targets probably don't change much based on which of those draft variables happens. If the Pistons draft a point guard in the first round, the biggest impact in free agency would be how they approach their own free agents, Jose Calderon and Will Bynum. Given how unlikely it is that Chris Paul decides to sign with the Pistons as a free agent, that's probably the extent of the fallout. Drafting a wing probably would have a greater impact on how the Pistons pursue trades and external free agents.\n\nQ: Hey David, here are my questions. Please explain the NBA amnesty rule and sometimes why it is not a wise thing to do? Could you tell us the 2013-14 NBA salary cap and the luxury tax for going over it, and the teams that were over it this season, 2012-13? Finally, I see the Pistons have interviewed Adrian Griffin, any thoughts on Griffin getting the job? -- Jeff\n\nA: Amnesty is a one-time-only opportunity, under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement, whereby teams can waive a player and eliminate his salary from salary cap and luxury tax calculations, with specific restrictions. The team still has to pay the player's full contract, minus any amount the player receives from signing with another team. Only a player playing under a contract he signed with his current team before July 1, 2011 is eligible. The amnesty-eligible Pistons are Greg Monroe, who won't be amnestied, and Charlie Villanueva, who could be.\n\nWhen you amnesty a player, you're giving away money, except for teams in the worst luxury-tax situations, one of the few cases in which it should be used. It takes resolve by ownership in a business which typically is marginally profitable compared to however the owner makes his/her real money -- if profitable at all. The Pistons just got finished paying Rip Hamilton to play in Chicago, they'll pay Lawrence Frank $4 million next season not to coach, so the prospect of paying Villanueva $8.6 million not to play is a big bite. Probably won't happen. Why amnesty Villanueva when you can trade him or, at worst, his contract expires without any compensation after next season and some of that money can go toward Monroe's new contract? Amnesty only can be exercised in the seven-day period following the NBA moratorium, which is July 1-9 this year. So from July 10-16, during the first week teams can sign free agents, they also can exercise their amnesty privilege.\n\nPistons owner Tom Gores didn't fire Frank to hire Griffin. That's one of the trees. Over here, we have the forest, where just about everyone with a coaching vacancy figures to take Brian Shaw's temperature when the Indiana Pacers are eliminated by the Miami Heat, and when Shaw looks at his alternatives and the Pistons look at the associated cost, the most likely scenario still appears to be a decision between Nate McMillan or Maurice Cheeks.\n\nExplaining the luxury tax comes with two attendant problems. One, readers don't have the time. Two, I'll get it wrong at some point because I'm not an attorney. But to give an umbrella answer to your questions, the 2013-14 cap won't be set until July (it was $58.044 million the last two years but could exceed $59 million next season), and the more punitive luxury-tax measures which begin taking effect in 2013-14, plus the repeat-offender multipliers which take effect for 2014-15, were pushed by owners before and during the 2011 lockout and CBA talks. Small-market owners were insistent on closing the competitive gap with big-market owners and it had become clear that the old dollar-to-dollar tax rate wasn't deterring big-market teams from snubbing the NBA's soft salary cap. The new tax measures are designed to make teams like the Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers decide if they're willing to pay massive taxes for the super-rosters they have built, up to $4.75 for every $1 over the cap in the absolute worst situations for repeat offenders. The tax line at which teams start to pay into the tax fund hasn't been set yet for 2013-14. For more on the salary cap, check out Larry Coon's NBA Salary Cap FAQ, which provides detailed explanations of just about anything you possibly could want to know on the topic.\n\nQ: There is a rumor beginning to swirl that the Dallas Mavericks are looking to dump Shawn Marion and are offering the 13th pick to make the deal happen. Any news on whether they are offering the Pistons such an opportunity and if they would be actively courting it? -- Jay Wiseman\n\nA: Nope. But if the Mavs want Villanueva/Rodney Stuckey for the ugliest shot west of Joakim Noah, Dumars might listen.\n\nQ: Last time I wrote, I asked about free agents. This time, I am curious about that other way of getting solid talent on the Pistons, trades. I was curious, since I have heard Joe Dumars say that this was going to a possibility, what players out there are too expensive for a team, allowing us to trade with them and taking their high-priced talent off their hands? I'm curious if there is an opportunity similar to Rasheed Wallace, or James Harden, even a Rudy Gay-type trade? I would love to see an expensive All-Star come to us. Might be a pipe dream of mine having this happen but I was hoping you might toss out a couple. Thanks for your hard work. -- James\n\nA: This goes to Jeff's earlier question about which teams are in potential luxury-tax trouble. Brooklyn, Chicago, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami and New York are in the worst shape. They're the teams that are scheduled to pay tax rates in excess of the $1.50-to-$1 rate for the lightest offenders (those less than $5 million over the tax line, which last year was $70.3 million but will be calculated under a different formula beginning next season).\n\nThe Lakers are in the biggest trouble. If they re-sign Dwight Howard, their committed payroll next season will be in the $100 million range again, which will cost them $75 million or so in luxury tax. No matter how rich you are, no owner wants to see his $175 million roster lose to a $60 million roster. The best way to avoid that is to show a little fiscal responsibility. The Lakers probably will try to mitigate some of that financial hit by using amnesty on Pistons nemesis Metta World Peace, who could be available for a song if the Pistons dare whistle that tune with the former Ron Artest. ...\n\nThe Nets are perceived as the one team that doesn't care much about all this tax falderol. Mikhail Prokhorov throws money at his problems. The Brooklyn owner's willingness to spend to win makes him the biggest wild card in the league. He's also looking at a tax bill in excess of $30 million for the nearly $86 million payroll he is committed to paying next year, or almost the same amount as Miami. Chicago is only marginally into the second tax tier and given how good the Bulls were without Derrick Rose, probably will keep the top-paid players together. New York likewise is looking at a smaller tax hit and is less likely to cut salaries than to pay more, eat the tax, supplement its eight-figure superstars, and avoid getting overshadowed by the Nets.\n\nThe teams ripest to be plucked are Boston, which is looking at a $1.50-to-$1 tax rate (assuming no change in the tax line, which is not a safe assumption), has an aging roster, goes into 2013-14 with Rajon Rondo still recovering from a major knee injury, and almost certainly is in position to break up this group and retool; and Golden State, which also is in the $1.50-to-$1 tax rate and suddenly finds itself in the unfamiliar situation of trying to keep a good, young core together without outstripping its financial structure.\n\nTrading Paul Pierce and/or Kevin Garnett could factor into Boston's serious makeover needs. The Warriors already have $58 million, or essentially the entire value of a salary cap, committed to five players next season, Andrew Bogut, Andris Biedrins, Stephen Curry, David Lee and Richard Jefferson. They are fortunate to have some good players on extended rookie contracts but the Warriors have some serious decisions to make if they don't want to lose some valuable pieces without compensation.\n\nToronto also is in tax trouble, primarily because it has overcommitted to underachievers -- $23 million over the next two years to Andrea Bargnani and almost $14 million to Landry Fields -- and there aren't a lot of pickings on that scrap pile.\n\nIf you're looking for a big name in trade, those are good places to start.\n\nQ: Can an experienced guard coach like Brian Shaw or Nate McMillan help Brandon Knight to become a true number-one point guard and lower his turnovers? Is Michael Curry in the Pistons plans at all? -- Stuart Left\n\nA: The Pistons sure hope so, Stuart. Certainly, a coach of that nature could help get into Knight's head about his court vision, try to become his eyes, and figure out where the rewiring has to occur. All the combo-guard stuff aside, for Knight to maximize his career and his value to whichever team(s) he plays for, he has to play the point eventually. No on Curry.\n\n-- Have a Pistons-related question for MLive Media Group beat writer David Mayo?
