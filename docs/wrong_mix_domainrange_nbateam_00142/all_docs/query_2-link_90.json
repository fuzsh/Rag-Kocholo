        "text": "The Bucks, Bobcats, Raptors, Heat and Bulls are engaged in a game of musical chairs for the last 4 Eastern Conference Playoff spots. Starting next week I willÂ be posting playoff odds, but because of the John Salmons trade I think the Bucks have a great shot. The Bulls gained cap room in this trade, but they may have sacrificed a playoff spot.\n\nÂ Â Salmons has been great for the Bucks.Â With the Bucks his adjusted +/- Rating so far is 13 points better per 48 minutes than an average player. Even when Bogut or Jennings are out (the Bucks two other key players), the Bucks are better than average when Salmons is in. Here are some other key observations about the Bucks:\n\nBogut with a +6.5 point Adjusted +/- Rating ranks 36th in the NBA. His solid play is due to great defense (-6 Defense Rating). This means when Bogut is in the game Bucks give up 6 less points per game than they would if Bogut were replaced by an average NBA defender.\n\nJennings has an average points rating but ranks 36th in league in Impact, which measures how you change the chance of a team winning a game. Thus Jennings plays very well with the game on the line.\n\nThe Bucks are horrible when both Bogut and Ilyasova are out: 10 points worse than average.\n\nWhen resting and Bogut, Ilyasova and Gadzuric in is good: Bucks play 10 points better than average.\n\nWith Jennings out, Ridnour, Bogut, Ilyasova and Ridnour in is great: 17 points better than average.\n\nUsing this information to create lineups should really help the Bucks.\n\nLetâs close by looking at the Bucks best lineups (among those that play often).\n\nNote 1B is great for resting Bogut. Also note that the new lineup 7A with Salmons is great. Also unbelievably the only difference between 1A and 2A is Ilyasova in for Moute. Yet 2A appears to be 20 points per game better and plays less. Why? Playing 2A 189 minutes and 1A 108 minutes would surely have won the Bucks a few games and those games might be the difference between a playoff birthÂ and sitting at home in May.\n\nMILÂ Â Â Â Â Â 5.24 (Â Â Â 6.67Â Â -4.71Â -11.38Â Â 17.56Â Â Â 0.99Â Â Â 3.57)Â 189.08 minutesÂ Â 57 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 1 AÂ Â Â Â Â 4.82Â Â Â Â Â Â 19 $\n\nBellÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â BogutÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DelfinoÂ Â Â Â Â Â JenningsÂ Â Â Â Â Mbah a MouteÂ 25.36 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 398_MIL_2010\n\nMILÂ Â Â Â Â 25.98 (Â Â 10.20Â Â Â 3.19Â Â -7.01Â Â 27.19Â Â Â 1.55Â Â Â 2.54)Â 117.93 minutesÂ Â 48 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 2 AÂ Â Â Â 25.24Â Â Â Â Â Â 62 $\n\nBellÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â BogutÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DelfinoÂ Â Â Â Â Â IlyasovaÂ Â Â Â Â JenningsÂ Â Â Â Â 25.23 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 206_MIL_2010\n\nMILÂ Â Â Â Â Â 6.65 (Â Â Â 5.61Â Â Â 0.46Â Â -5.15Â Â 22.11Â Â Â 1.02Â Â Â 3.95)Â 101.89 minutesÂ Â 60 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 3 AÂ Â Â Â Â 5.18Â Â Â Â Â Â 11 $\n\nBellÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â BogutÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DelfinoÂ Â Â Â Â Â JenningsÂ Â Â Â Â WarrickÂ Â Â Â Â Â 26.20 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 16526_MIL_2010\n\nMILÂ Â Â Â Â Â 8.03 (Â Â Â 3.67Â Â -3.69Â Â -7.35Â Â 20.37Â Â Â 0.80Â Â Â 3.49)Â Â 97.93 minutesÂ Â 27 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 4 AÂ Â Â Â Â 7.35Â Â Â Â Â Â 15 $\n\nBogutÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DelfinoÂ Â Â Â Â Â IlyasovaÂ Â Â Â Â JenningsÂ Â Â Â Â Mbah a MouteÂ 23.73 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 460_MIL_2010\n\nMILÂ Â Â Â Â 27.81 (Â Â 15.98Â Â -1.79Â -17.77Â Â 40.81Â Â Â 2.25Â Â Â 6.11)Â Â 63.09 minutesÂ Â 23 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 7 AÂ Â Â Â 23.58Â Â Â Â Â Â 31 $\n\nBogutÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DelfinoÂ Â Â Â Â Â JenningsÂ Â Â Â Â Mbah a MouteÂ SalmonsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 25.21 yearsÂ Â Â Â 262540_MIL_2010\n\nMILÂ Â Â Â Â 10.28 (Â Â Â 8.32Â Â Â 2.18Â Â -6.15Â Â 19.42Â Â Â 1.19Â Â Â 1.86)Â Â 47.93 minutesÂ Â 15 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 1 BÂ Â Â Â Â 5.01Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5 $\n\nBellÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â DelfinoÂ Â Â Â Â Â GadzuricÂ Â Â Â Â IlyasovaÂ Â Â Â Â JenningsÂ Â Â Â Â 26.59 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 234_MIL_2010\n\nRecently the Kings have been in turmoil. Players have complained that Coach Paul Westphal plays inconsistent lineups.Â The Kings have played more different lineups (470) than any other team.\n\nÂ Â Iâd like to chime in with some analysis of the Kings. I am writing from Toluca Mexico (teaching operations research here this week). 75 degrees and sunny.\n\nÂ Â Â The Kings play 4 points worse than average for the season. The sad thing is they traded Rodriguez, who had played great. When Sergio was in the Kings were an amazing 9 points better than average(after adjusting for strength of opponents). When Sergio was out Kings played 7 points worse than average. Here are the lineups played most by the Kings. For example lineup 1A has played 100 minutes and plays 2 points worse than average.\n\nNote the 4 lineups that play the most are all worse than average! 2A-4A are poor.Â Â Â Â 4B-6B areÂ all above average;Â why not play them more!\n\nÂ Â Â Â ACTUALÂ Â Â THEORYÂ Â Â Â OFFÂ Â Â Â DEFÂ IMPACTÂ ZSCOREÂ Â SIGMAÂ Â Â Â PLAYING TIMEÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SIMPLEÂ Â Â Â Â Â ï¿½\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â -1.92 (Â Â -5.67Â Â -3.89Â Â Â 1.78Â Â -5.12Â Â -0.58Â Â Â 2.77)Â 100.01 minutesÂ Â 28 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 1 AÂ Â Â Â -2.40Â Â Â Â Â Â -5 $\n\nEvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â NocioniÂ Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â UdrihÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 24.60 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 12836_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â -9.24 (Â Â -7.78Â Â -4.29Â Â Â 3.49Â -15.91Â Â -1.02Â Â Â 2.25)Â Â 83.98 minutesÂ Â 18 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 2 AÂ Â Â Â -6.29Â Â Â Â Â -11 $\n\nEvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GreeneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â NocioniÂ Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â 23.47 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4660_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â -10.54 (Â Â -1.81Â Â -3.92Â Â -2.11Â Â Â 3.50Â Â -0.07Â Â Â 2.19)Â Â 83.08 minutesÂ Â 46 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 3 AÂ Â Â -13.87Â Â Â Â Â -24 $\n\nCasspiÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â EvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â UdrihÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 22.88 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 12326_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â -8.89 (Â Â -5.99Â Â -0.55Â Â Â 5.44Â Â 10.93Â Â -0.24Â Â Â 1.93)Â Â 73.86 minutesÂ Â 21 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 4 AÂ Â Â -12.35Â Â Â Â Â -19 $\n\nCasspiÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â EvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GreeneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â MartinÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 22.45 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 118_SAC_2010\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â ACTUALÂ Â Â THEORYÂ Â Â Â OFFÂ Â Â Â DEFÂ IMPACTÂ ZSCOREÂ Â SIGMAÂ Â Â Â PLAYING TIMEÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â SIMPLEÂ Â Â Â Â Â ï¿½\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.94 (Â Â -6.71Â Â -4.95Â Â Â 1.77Â -10.03Â Â -0.82Â Â Â 1.84)Â Â 56.86 minutesÂ Â 27 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 1 BÂ Â Â Â -2.53Â Â Â Â Â Â -3 $\n\nCasspiÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â EvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â MartinÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â 22.77 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4198_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â -5.86 (Â Â -2.48Â Â Â 1.33Â Â Â 3.81Â Â -1.12Â Â -0.24Â Â Â 2.12)Â Â 51.26 minutesÂ Â 19 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 2 BÂ Â Â Â -9.36Â Â Â Â Â -10 $\n\nCasspiÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â GreeneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â UdrihÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 23.20 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 12338_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â 16.82 (Â -10.58Â Â -4.92Â Â Â 5.65Â -18.65Â Â -1.32Â Â Â 2.09)Â Â 49.54 minutesÂ Â 17 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 3 BÂ Â Â Â 10.66Â Â Â Â Â Â 11 $\n\nEvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â MartinÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â NocioniÂ Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â 24.48 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4708_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â Â 3.35 (Â Â -2.23Â Â Â 1.44Â Â Â 3.67Â Â 34.53Â Â Â 0.67Â Â Â 2.35)Â Â 44.92 minutesÂ Â 26 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 4 BÂ Â Â Â Â 6.41Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 6 $\n\nCasspiÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â EvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â NocioniÂ Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â UdrihÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 24.57 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 12806_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.35 (Â Â -1.45Â Â -5.15Â Â -3.70Â Â -6.09Â Â -0.26Â Â Â 2.20)Â Â 43.03 minutesÂ Â 14 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 5 BÂ Â Â Â -4.46Â Â Â Â Â Â -4 $\n\nEvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GreeneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â UdrihÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 22.95 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 12340_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â Â 0.94 (Â Â Â 2.00Â Â Â 0.19Â Â -1.81Â Â 33.56Â Â Â 0.99Â Â Â 1.11)Â Â 40.66 minutesÂ Â 28 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 6 BÂ Â Â Â -3.54Â Â Â Â Â Â -3 $\n\nCasspiÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â EvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GreeneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â UdrihÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 22.92 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 12310_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â Â 2.27 (Â Â -3.92Â Â -4.32Â Â -0.40Â Â -7.29Â Â -0.51Â Â Â 1.73)Â Â 39.18 minutesÂ Â 15 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 7 BÂ Â Â Â Â 1.23Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1 $\n\nCasspiÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â EvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GreeneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â 21.76 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4150_SAC_2010\n\nSACÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1.87 (Â Â -6.36Â Â -6.18Â Â Â 0.18Â -19.62Â Â -1.01Â Â Â 1.90)Â Â 36.49 minutesÂ Â 15 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 8 BÂ Â Â Â Â 1.32Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1 $\n\nEvansÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â GreeneÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HawesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â MartinÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â ThompsonÂ Â Â Â Â 22.84 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 4212_SAC_2010\n\nSome more comments on what works and what does not work: All numbers are per 48 minutes and are adjusted for strength of opponents.\n\nSo far with Landry in Kings play 19 points worse than average.\n\nBrockman and Hawes in is poor: Kings play 20 points worse than average!\n\nThompson, Udrih, Casspi and Greene in with Hawes out is great: 71 minutes 16 points better than average\n\nNocioni, Udrih and Casspi in with Evans Brockman and Udoka out is great: 37 points better than average inÂ 106 minutes.\n\nEvans , Udoka and Udrih in with Casspi out is great: 13 points better than average in 130 minutes.\n\nBrockman and Evans in with Hawes out is good: In 288 minutes Kings play 9 points better than average.\n\nWith Rodriguez and Udrih out Kings are 8 points worse than average. But when Evans, Brockman and Casspi are in with these guys out Kings are fine: 5 points better than average,\n\nYou canât blame Westphal for trying to find something that works. Looking at this data should make it easier to find the right combinations.\n\nLast week I posted some suggested lineup changes for the struggling Celtics. In response to that post Crow made some great suggestions. He pointed out teams play several hundred lineups during the season but after a while good teams have a few (say 5-15) lineups that have shown themselves to be very effective. Why not cobble a rotation out of those few effective lineups? I really think this approach would improve the peformance of most teams. The reason why this approach has not caught on is that coaches usually think they know the “right matchups” based on who the opposition has put on the court.Â Why not make theÂ other team react to your teamâs strength?\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â I still think playing lineups that have proved their effectiveness makes sense, so here is a suggested rotation of lineups for the Magic.\n\nÂ Â Â Â Â These 6 lineups have played 17.65, 16.29, 15.38, 56.23, 20.58, and 27.26 points better than average, respectively. These lineups involve 11 players (all but Bass). For the season as a whole the Magic play 7 points better than average. How can they not play better if they primarily stuck to these lineups?. There are even 2 lineups that rest Dwight Howard well. Also, with this sequencing nobodyÂ plays in more than 3 consecutive lineups, so rest is accounted for.\n\n1.Â ORLÂ Â Â Â Â 17.65 (Â Â 14.63Â Â Â 4.88Â Â -9.76Â Â 27.91Â Â Â 1.76Â Â Â 6.87)Â 335.71 minutesÂ 111 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 1 AÂ Â Â Â 13.30Â Â Â Â Â Â 93 $\n\nBarnesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â CarterÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HowardÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â LewisÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â NelsonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 29.02 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1610_ORL_2010\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n2.Â ORLÂ Â Â Â Â 16.29 (Â Â -2.00Â Â Â 1.52Â Â Â 3.52Â Â -2.18Â Â -0.22Â Â Â 5.97)Â Â 74.48 minutesÂ Â 48 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 6 AÂ Â Â Â 24.49Â Â Â Â Â Â 38 $\n\nAndersonÂ Â Â Â Â GortatÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â PietrusÂ Â Â Â Â Â RedickÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â WilliamsÂ Â Â Â Â 27.01 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 14369_ORL_2010\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n3.Â ORLÂ Â Â Â Â 15.38 (Â Â 11.33Â Â Â 3.57Â Â -7.76Â Â 39.75Â Â Â 1.83Â Â Â 6.45)Â Â 31.80 minutesÂ Â 27 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 2 CÂ Â Â Â 12.07Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 8 $\n\nCarterÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HowardÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â LewisÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â RedickÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â WilliamsÂ Â Â Â Â 29.41 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â 12872_ORL_2010\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\nÂ\n\n4.Â ORLÂ Â Â Â Â 56.23 (Â Â 20.21Â Â 12.19Â Â -8.02Â Â 47.74Â Â Â 2.66Â Â Â 4.19)Â Â 63.29 minutesÂ Â 26 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 7 AÂ Â Â Â 55.36Â Â Â Â Â Â 73 $\n\nAndersonÂ Â Â Â Â BarnesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HowardÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â NelsonÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â RedickÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â 25.79\n\nyearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 5187_ORL_2010\n\nÂ\n\n5.Â ORLÂ Â Â Â Â 20.58 (Â Â 12.58Â Â Â 4.31Â Â -8.28Â Â 49.07Â Â Â 2.08Â Â Â 7.18)Â Â 28.99 minutesÂ Â 21 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 3 CÂ Â Â Â 18.21Â Â Â Â Â Â 11 $\n\nBarnesÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â CarterÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â HowardÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â A.

This is a great trade for the Mavs. The major players are Howard, Gooden, Butler and Haywood, so letâs focus on them.\n\nÂ Letâs first look at the Mavs big weakness: poor defense in the backcourt. Here are the Adjusted +/- Defensive Ratings for the Mavs Guards:\n\nTerry +8, Kidd +8, Barea +7, Beaubois +14.\n\nThis means, for example, if Beaubois plays 48 minutes in lieu of an average NBA defensive player we believe the Mavs would yield 14 more points per 48 minutes.\n\nThese are the worst defensive numbers for any backcourt in the league except for the Wizards:\n\nArenas +13, Foye +10, Young +4, Stevenson +8, Boykins +9.\n\nSo what do you do to mitigate the weakness of a bad defensive backcourt? Bring in a great defensive center who can cover up the guardsâ Â mistakes. Enter Brendon Haywood whose -16 Adjusted +/- Defense Rating is the leagueâs best. Haywood is weak offensively ( -9 Adjusted +/- Offense Rating), but he should be able to cover for many defensive lapsesÂ by the Mavs guards. If he does not work out, the Mavs do not have to resign him.\n\nÂ Â Caron Butler has a +3 Adjusted +/- Points Rating this year.Â Butler has a +2 Points Offense Rating and -1 Points defense Rating, so he is not a bad defender. Butlerâs contract does run through 2011, so the Mavs do need him to pan out.\n\nÂ Butlerâs current numbers are similar to Josh Howardâs past ratings. If Josh can regain his pre-injury form, the Butler for Howard portion of the trade is probably a wash.Â Â So unless Howard recaptures his old form, this part of the swap is great for the Mavs.\n\nÂ Â Â We also have an Impact Rating, that is based on how playerâs change the chance of their team winning,. For example, if you are down by 20Â points with 2 minutes to go and your team loses the game by only 5 your Adjusted +/- rating shoots up, but your Impact ratings isÂ hardly affected.Â Here are how the four players rank in Impact Rating among the 200 NBA players who have averaged at least 25 minutes per game.\n\nButler 43rd, Haywood 59th, Howard 83rd, Gooden 190th.\n\nAgain, by this metric the trade is a steal for the Mavs\n\nDrew Goodenâs Adjusted +/- rating this seasonÂ is -4 and the past 3 years he has averaged an Adjusted +/- of -6, so he will probably not help the Wizards much. Certainly the Haywood for Gooden part of the deal is a huge plus for the Mavs.Â\n\nÂ Â Of course, when players are traded, they often perform better or worse than expected. But as we said, the Mavs need to cover for their poor defensive guard play, and Haywood has done that with the Wizardâs poor defensive backcourt, so there is every reason to expect that his great defense will be lead to a revitalized Mavs defense.\n\nÂ We leave you with one final statistic:\n\nWhen Butler and Haywood are both in this year for the Wizards, the WizardsÂ play 2 points better than average. The rest of the season the Wizards play 13 points worse than average. So together Butler and Haywood can turn a poor team into an above average team.Â\n\nSince Christmas the Boston Celtics have played like an average NBA team (.65 points better than average). This will not satisfy fans of the sportsâ most storied franchise. Is there any hope for the Celtics to recapture their 2007-2008 level of greatness?\n\nÂ Â Â Â The first point to make is that KG in his current level of health is not having a big impact. Since Christmas with Pierce, Rondo, Ray Allen, and KG on the court the Celtics have played 6 points better than average. When Pierce, Rondo and Ray are on court with KG out the Celtics have played around the same: 5 points better than average. I am not a doctor, but KG 2010 is not playing at his past level. His Adjusted +/- this year is -3. During his last 5 seasons his Adjusted +/- averaged out to +11. Unless KG can regain his previous abilities, it will be tough for the Celtics to make the conference finals.\n\nÂ Still, there are ways for the Celtics to improve. Letâs partition all Celtic minutes played since Christmas based on which of Pierce, Rondo, and Ray Allen are on the court and see how things went:\n\nAll 3 in : 5 points better than average.\n\nPierce and Rondo in, Ray out- 20 points better than average.\n\nPierce and Allen in, Rondo out- 9 points better than average\n\nRondo and Allen in Pierce out-2 points worse than average\n\nAt most one of Rondo, Pierce andÂ Allen in-10 points worse than average.\n\nFrom these numbers it looks like when at least two of Pierce, Rondo, and Ray Allen are in the Celtics are ok. Having all 3 in does not make them that much better. Therefore, it looks like the Celtics would improve if they would rest Pierce, Rondo, and Ray Allen one at a time more often and lessen the time two or more of them are out.\n\nFor example, Pierce can be rested with\n\nBOSÂ Â Â Â Â 10.85 (Â Â Â 7.74Â Â -0.11Â Â -7.85Â Â Â 3.01Â Â Â 0.62Â Â Â 6.52)Â 110.14 minutesÂ Â 50 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 3 AÂ Â Â Â 14.38Â Â Â Â Â Â 33 $\n\nT. AllenÂ Â Â Â Â R. AllenÂ Â Â Â Â GarnettÂ Â Â Â Â Â PerkinsÂ Â Â Â Â Â RondoÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 29.01 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1299\n\nThis lineup plays 11 points better than average and rests Pierce.\n\nTo rest Ray Allen I would recommend\n\nBOSÂ Â Â Â Â 30.36 (Â Â -0.19Â Â -5.02Â Â -4.83Â -18.94Â Â -0.47Â Â Â 4.48)Â Â 22.60 minutesÂ Â 15 appearancesÂ Â Â Â 6 CÂ Â Â Â 29.73Â Â Â Â Â Â 14 $\n\nT. AllenÂ Â Â Â Â GarnettÂ Â Â Â Â Â PerkinsÂ Â Â Â Â Â PierceÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â RondoÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 28.56 yearsÂ Â Â Â Â Â 1809_BOS_2010\n\nThis lineup has played 30 points better than average.\n\nTo rest Rondo it appears that the quartet of Ray Allen, Wallace, House and Davis has played well recently (+58 rating in 15 minutes).\n\nAlso, the return of Marquis Daniels should create some lineups that can better rest Â Rondo or Ray Allen,\n\nIn summary, things can go better even if KGâs level of play does not improve. But without a return to KGâs past level of greatness, it looks like no Championship in Boston this season.\n\nBy the way, Ray Allen is mentioned in trade talk. His Adjusted +/- is +10 this season (despite a decline in box score stats), so trading Ray Allen would really reduce the Celtics level of performance during the rest of the season.\n\nIt is now unbelievably February. Through the lens of Adjusted +/-, letâs review the performance of each team in January. Note that an AdjustedÂ +/- of +10 means the player played 10 points better than average in January; An Offense rating of +5 means his team scores 5 more points per game than they would if an average offensive player replaced the player; a Defense rating of say -5 means his team gives up 5 fewer points per game than they would if an average defender replaced the player.\n\nAtlanta\n\nÂ Few Hawks did well. Joe Johnson played poorly (-13 Points rating) primarily due to poor defense (+10 rating). Rookie Jeff Teague showed improvement due to his great defense.\n\nBoston\n\nThe Celtics played poorly. Main culprits includeÂ KG (-11 points rating). KGâs Offense rating was a very poor -21. This means the Celtics offense ground to a jalt when KG was in. Glen Davis (-14 points rating) also played poorly.\n\nCharlotte\n\nNazr Mohammed played poorly (-8 points rating). Flip Murray (+11 Points), Gerald Wallace (+15 points) Steven Jackson (+8 points) keyed the Bobcats continued success.\n\nChicago\n\nLuol Deng (+16 Points rating) continued his great play.

Shaq has really improved. Through December his Points rating was -4 and in January it jumped to +4.\n\nDallas\n\nThe Mavs had a poor January due to poor defensive guard play.

James Singleton had a great Janauary (+16 rating, -11 Defense Rating).\n\nDenver\n\nÂ Â Â This team is totally keyed by the great play ofÂ Nene and Birdman, both of whom had a +23 Points rating in January. Billups and Melo are not nearly as important as the media believes.\n\nDetroit\n\nRodney Stuckey (+7 points rating) keyed their limited success. Ben Wallace (-14 Defense rating) has been a defensiveÂ pillar of strength.

Zach Randolph continued his great play (+10 Points Rating) while rookie Hasheem Thabeet slipped a bit( Points Rating of +9 through December and -1 in January).

Teams caught on to Frye and his points rating through December of +13 dropped to +2. Amare, Richardson, Hill, Dragic and Amundson had Points ratings for January between -9 and -11.

Amir Johnson (+20 Points Rating -23 Defense Rating) and Maro Bellinelli (+14 Points Rating) were amazing, Calderon (+11 Points Rating) and Bosh (+9 Points Rating )Â and Antoine Wright (+8 Points Rating) were also solid. Only rookie Demar DeRozan (-7 Points Rating) struggled.\n\nUtah\n\nThe Jazz had an excellent January sparked by Deron Williams (+17 Points rating). AK47, Boozer and Korver all had Points Ratings aroundÂ +10 for January, so they also played very well\n\nWashington\n\nDespite the off court turmoil, the Wizards kept soldiering on. Butler and Jamison (+5 Points Rating)Â were solid. Brendon Haywood (+11 Points Rating, -17 Defense Rating) has been great all season and gets no respect.
