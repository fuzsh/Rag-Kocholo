        "text": "Warriors center Andris Biedrins exercised his player option for next season. (Rocky Widner/NBAE/Getty Images)\n\nGolden State Warriors center Andris Biedrins will exercise his player option and return to the team for the 2013-14 season, reports Comcast SportsNet Northwest.\n\nBiedrins held a player option for next season that will pay him $9 million for the final year of his six-year, $54 million contract he signed in 2008. If he had declined, he would have become an unrestricted free agent this offseason.\n\nThe Warriors have around $75 million committed to salary next season. Forward Richard Jefferson has an $11 million option, with forward Carl Landry and guard Brandon Rush each having $4 million options.\n\nMore from CSNNW:\n\nThe punitive luxury tax system goes into effect and Carl Landry (player option), Jarrett Jack (free agent) are integral pieces the organization would hope to retain. Biedrins appeared in 53 games while starting nine of those contests during his 2012-13 campaign. He averaged 0.5 points, 2.9 rebounds and 0.8 blocks in 9.3 minutes per game."
