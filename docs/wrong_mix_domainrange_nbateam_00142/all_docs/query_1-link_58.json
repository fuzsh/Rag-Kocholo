Love my Suns, but I'm just not a fan of the way the game is played anymore.\n\nI'll happily go back and watch the entire 1993 finals and still be in awe. It's just the time frame of Hoops I most cherish - late 80's through to the early 2000's. The league for me, was incredible back then.\n\nUsed to love watching that 'plumber', Thunder Dan pull up from 35 feet, and that 'electrician', Sir Charles rumble through clogged lanes and dunk on folk.\n\njerwoods, midwestking100 and AIRJ23 like this.\n\nLast edited by daveberg; 07-11-2021 at 05:49 AM.\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: Apr 2021\n\nRe: NBA 2K21 Current & Next Gen - Classic & All-Time Team Rosters Errors & Feedback\n\nHaha well said. Rewatching the 93 Finals and I’m still glued to the tv. First two games of this year’s finals had all the excitement and sense of occasion as a pickup game.\n\n‘92 Dream Team never lost a game to Nigeria (or anyone) either (never let a team get closer than 32 points away).\n\nShiiii…. Craig Hodges still holds the 3 point contest record. Not bad for a locksmith. Usually I wouldn’t put much weight into a 3 point contest but considering today’s game literally is a 3 point contest, imagine the damage he could do today. Oh and he’s fundamentally sound as a library.\n\nSpecial shout-out to the two time champ Hakeem who is still the only player to achieve 200 steals and 200 blocks in one season. Not bad for a janitor.\n\nOr Wilt the Stilt having the best collective ATHLETIC figures of anyone in history (and arguably being the best athlete in history). 7’1, 48” vertical, 4.6 40 yard dash at 280 lbs, 600 lb bench press, dominated in nearly every single sport including volleyball. But yeah he’s a plumber and Nikola Jocik who has all the hops and speed of a stalled greyhound is an athletic superhuman. LOL. Wilt would probably break his own 100 point record today. The only person who could “guard” him is a ref.\n\nIt’s sad today’s generation who probably never even watched full Kobe games have to be convinced today’s game is the most ultimate example of how the game is played. NBA corporate really pulling the wool over eyes. Sad.\n\nNo coincidence that gen are the same group on 2K cultured into running zig zags, doing 22 second pointless dribble dances then shooting “LoGO sHoT” airballs then getting mad at teammates for not exclusively shooting tHrEeS when they’re not pulling up to brick a three on a wide open fast break instead of taking it to the rack.\n\nI’ll say it again; today’s NBA is broken. It needs an overhaul. Too bloated, needs to get back to basics.\n\nmidwestking100 likes this.\n\nLast edited by AIRJ23; 07-11-2021 at 07:21 AM."
