        "text": "Andris Biedrins was a young center who showed a decent amount of promise to be a double-double guy almost every night. The Golden State Warriors though it wise to lock him down for the future of their frontcourt, so they signed him to a six-year, $54 million contract in the summer of 2008.\n\nMaybe a few seasons ago it seemed like a great idea.\n\nHowever, even after a career year in 2008-2009, the seven-footer was hampered by injuries in the next two seasons and never seemed to find his stride afterward.\n\nThis past season was an all-time low for Biedrins, who logged just 15.7 minutes per game and posted horrendous averages of 1.7 points and 3.7 rebounds in that time.\n\nThe Warriors and their fans could clearly see that Biedrins was simply not turning a corner in his career and his confidence was all but gone.\n\nNow Biedrins is due $18 million in his remaining two years on his contract and the Warriors have to keep in mind the future and making the necessary cap room adjustments.\n\nWith Andrew Bogut and Richard Jefferson coming in with their expensive contracts as well, the Warriors may be forced to give up on the Andris Biedrins project if they hope to continue moving forward in their rebuilding process.\n\nThe question is, however, are there any teams out there in the NBA willing to take on expensive, damaged goods?\n\nIn short, the answer is yes.\n\nWhile Biedrins is by no means a productive big man at this stage in his career, centers are still coveted by a lot of teams in the league.\n\nTrue centers may still be one of the rarest positions in the NBA and if there's one thing that Biedrins has going for him, it's that he is, in fact, a true center.\n\nThis could be a selling point for the Warriors in addition to his age (26 years old) and what he has shown himself to be capable of when fully healthy.\n\nIt's a hard sell to convince any team, desperate or not, that a player who averaged 1.7 points last season is worth a spot on the benchâ€”let alone two years and $18 million.\n\nHowever, it's a sell that the Warriors may be forced to make. The good news for Golden State is that it may have some potential buyers.\n\nOne suitable candidate is the NBA's resident laughingstock, the Charlotte Bobcats.\n\nAfter finishing with the worst winning percentage of any team in NBA history last season, it's safe to say that the Bobcats wouldn't be too picky about who gets to suit up for them in Charlotte.\n\nThe Bobcats are clearly looking to rebuild and they have at least found some decent help at the big man position in B.J. Mullens and D.J. White, but their depth is still lacking.\n\nThe Bobcats would, of course, be taking a risk by using their cap space on acquiring Biedrins instead of signing more valuable free agents, but it could pay dividends for them.\n\nFor example, Charlotte was a little depleted at the backup center area since DeSagana Diop was filling that role and putting up even worse numbers than Biedrins in about the same amount of playing time.\n\nThe worst part is that Diop was getting paid just about $2 million less to be even worse than Biedrins on the worst team in the NBA.\n\nThis offseason, Diop has a player option to stay on the Bobcats and rake in another $7.3 million next season for essentially doing nothing.\n\nIf the Bobcats wanted to get rid of Diop and make a serious upgrade at the backup center, they could deal a future second-rounder for Biedrins, thus pushing Diop down on the depth chart with hopes that he would opt out of his last year.\n\nBiedrins still has the potential to return to the form of his past, but he won't be receiving enough minutes in Golden State to really figure his game out.\n\nAs a member of the Bobcats, Biedrins would most likely earn some decent playing time and his competition to beat out for the starting job, Mullens, isn't exactly an overwhelming obstacle.\n\nWhat it boils down to is that the Warriors will surely be looking to get rid of Biedrins for just about anyone or anything in hopes that his previous successes will be enough basis to take a two-year chance on the Latvian center."
