        "text": "The virtual reality (VR) industry owes much to the pioneering spirit of a movie professional named Mort Heilig. During the second half of the 1950s, he developed the “Sensorama,” nicknamed “the cinema of the future.” Finally patented in 1962, the device was an individual booth designed to immerse the user in one of the few films specially prepared for the equipment. Equipped with three-dimensional images, stereo sound, a chair that reacted to events on the screen, a device to reproduce specific smells, and even a fan, the Sensorama is considered one of the most important milestones in the history of virtual reality.\n\nThe 1960s also saw the preliminary work on Head Mounted Displays (HMDs). Fundamental for the illusion of virtual reality to be understood by the brain, this component reacts and syncs to the user’s head movements, changing the images according to where the user is facing. The first HMD ever connected to a computer was so heavy that it had to be attached to the ceiling. It was developed by a team led by Ivan Sutherland, one of the most important graphic computer pioneers and doctoral student of Claude Shannon, another key figure in the history of computation.\n\nThe illusion created by virtual reality derives from the way we perceive the world around us. If a particular set up can trick sight and hearing — our brain’s primary sources of information gathering — thus freeing us from the limitations imposed by screens (as in cinema or television), it may elicit in us the impression of being immersed in a new world — which may or may not be similar to our reality. VR glasses, for example, can carry us into this alternate universe, usually accompanied by headphones through which we may hear the sounds of this new setting.\n\nAs expected, the big tech companies are backing the expansion of both virtual reality and augmented reality application use, a strategy reinforced after Nintendo’s success with the game Pokémon Go. According to market research firm App Annie, Pokémon Go generated revenues of $600 million between July and September 2016. It should be noted that another extremely popular smartphone game, Candy Crush Saga, took more than twice as long to achieve this sum. Pokémon Go mixes geolocation (i.e. the real-time geographic location of a device) with augmented reality to capture digital creatures that pop up in the real world through the mobile phone screen.\n\nCurrently, several global technology companies have devices to access this market: Google, with Cardboard and Daydream; Samsung, with Gear VR; Facebook, through the July 2014 acquisition of Oculus VR for $2 billion; Microsoft, with HoloLens; Sony, with Playstation VR; and HTC, with Vive. Research firm International Data Corporation (IDC) estimates revenues from the virtual and augmented reality market will rise from about $5 billion in 2016 to over $160 billion in 2020. Intel is also positioning itself in the segment by developing technologies to enable information transmission and reception on wireless HMDs — a critical move for large-scale adoption of the technology — and to allow the experiencing of sporting events and live shows from a privileged point of view through VR.\n\nAccording to SuperData, a research company specializing in the gaming and interactive entertainment markets, in 2016 about one hundred million VR devices were sold — but the overwhelming majority was of the simplest and cheapest type, Google Cardboard. The product in question is essentially a cardboard box in which the smartphone must be docked horizontally, limiting the user’s field of vision and providing full immersion in the environment set up by a virtual reality app. With the increase in VR content available, we shall witness the steep rise in market penetration of more sophisticated equipment. This expansion will be our next topic. See you then."
