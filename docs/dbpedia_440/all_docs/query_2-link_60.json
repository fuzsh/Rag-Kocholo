        "text": "As World War II drew to a close, the United States embarked on Project Whirlwind.\n\nAt the time, “whirlwind” evoked images of fast, powerful, and unstoppable motion.\n\nWhirlwind was a US Navy research project in 1944 to develop a universal flight trainer using an analog computer.\n\nIn 1947, after recognizing its potential for national defense, the Whirlwind project was redirected to the US Air Force, where its focus shifted to the construction of a high-speed digital computer.\n\nComputing engineer Jay Forrester (1918 to 2016) led the development of the Whirlwind I digital computer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) servomechanisms laboratory in 1948.\n\nThe Whirlwind I computer became operational in 1951. It occupied over 2,000 square feet and could quickly process substantial amounts of data.\n\nThe computer’s visual output was viewed on a round cathode-ray tube (CRT), similar to those used on an oscilloscope.\n\nThe Whirlwind computer depended on 5,000 vacuum tubes acting as switches within its logic circuits for core functionality and performing calculations.\n\nHowever, a single faulty tube could cause errors or system-wide disruption.\n\nTo maintain operational reliability, the Whirlwind team designed circuitry to identify potentially failing vacuum tubes and replace them before they caused disruptions.\n\nThe Whirlwind I quickly performed computations by automatically executing stored program instructions.\n\nThe computer was used for air defense tracking and processed radar data at a speed of 50,000 operations per second.\n\nThe Whirlwind I pioneered magnetic-core memory, a technology where small ferrite rings resembling miniature donuts used magnetic polarities to represent binary data (ones and zeros).\n\nThis significantly increased speed and reliability compared to earlier vacuum tube memory, such as Williams-Kilburn tubes.\n\nThis innovation, magnetic-core memory, became the dominant form of random-access memory (RAM) in computers from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s.\n\nThe Whirlwind I computer consumed 100 kW of power and required a cooling system due to the heat generated by the vacuum tubes.\n\nThis digital computer introduced graphical output capabilities, allowing users to see computer-generated information in real time – a significant leap forward in human-machine interaction.\n\nDuring the 1950s, the Whirlwind project became a significant part of the US military’s multi-billion-dollar Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system project.\n\nMIT’s groundbreaking research on the Whirlwind I computer, especially its rapid computational and graphical visual data display, drove the specifications for SAGE.\n\nIBM was the primary contracted system builder for SAGE and worked directly with designs based on MIT’s work.\n\nOther company contracts for this massive air defense project included AT&T, Burroughs, Western Electric, and the RAND Corp.\n\nSAGE was a vast network of radar stations and command centers designed to counter potential bomber threats from the Soviet Union during the Cold War.\n\nThis complex system relied on large digital computers and associated networking equipment to coordinate data obtained from radar sites, producing a single unified image of the airspace over a wide area.\n\nSAGE computing centers were installed across the US, including in Minnesota.\n\nIn 1954, a $5 million, four-story windowless SAGE concrete blockhouse was constructed in Hermantown, MN, next to the Duluth airport to strengthen the nation’s air defense against trans-polar Soviet air attacks.\n\nThe SAGE network provided essential data and coordination for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD).\n\nThe blockhouse building, called Duluth SAGE Direction Center DC-10, became operational in 1959, and it housed the latest radar and computer technology.\n\nIt played a vital role in air defense operations while safeguarding the airspace in the northern region of the US.\n\nAt its peak, there were 29 SAGE building centers; however, all had been decommissioned by 1983.\n\nAfterward, the SAGE Direction Center DC-10 building was remodeled and given to the University of Minnesota Duluth in 1985.\n\nThe Whirlwind I computer led to the development of the experimental 1955 “Transistorized eXperimental” TX-0 computer, which evaluated the practicality of using transistor-based technology instead of vacuum tubes.\n\nThe TX-0 was followed by the TX-2, a research computer designed in 1956 by MIT physicist Wesley A. Clark (1927 to 2016) to explore advanced memory technologies and human-computer interaction.\n\nThe TX-2 transistorized computer used magnetic-core memory storage, a CRT display, and a light-pen stylus, offering users a new way to interact directly with a computer.\n\nMIT student Ivan Sutherland, while working with the TX-2, unlocked the field of computer graphics with his software program, Sketchpad.\n\nSutherland’s 1963 Ph. D. thesis, “Sketchpad, A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System,” introduced the foundation of object-oriented programming.\n\nThis software allowed users to draw, manipulate, and interact with complex shapes, designs, and objects directly on the computer screen using a light pen.\n\nThe TX-2’s light pen detected light emitted from the CRT screen, allowing users to point at and directly manipulate displayed objects.\n\nThe elements were responsive, laying the groundwork for modern graphical interaction.\n\nUsing the light pen, users could directly draw their ideas onto the screen using Sketchpad’s interactive visual elements instead of relying on text-based interfaces.\n\nOn Feb. 1, 1972, Sutherland was granted US Patent No. 3,639,736 for his invention.\n\nIvan Edward Sutherland, born May 16, 1938, is known as the “father of computer graphics” through his creation of Sketchpad."
