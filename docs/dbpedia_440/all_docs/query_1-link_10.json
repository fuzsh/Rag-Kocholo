In recent years, there has been an explosion of research and experiments that deal with creativity and A.I. Almost every week, there is a new bot that paints, writes stories, composes music, designs objects or builds houses: Artificial Intelligence systems performing creative tasks?\n\nOur research started by wondering about this phenomenon and playfully experimenting with it. This lead to an in-depth investigation, of what we call “CreativeAI”. This document is the first chapter of our adventure into CreativeAI, aiming at establishing a backstory and language we can use to talk about this intricate subject. Our initial intuition was, that creativity is a central force throughout human history — and is currently evolving in interesting ways. In our attempt to understand this phenomenon, we think about creativity and technology in a structured way. We focus on emerging creation patterns, Assisted Creation and Generative Creation, and argue that they are leading to the Democratization and Escalation of Creativity.\n\nThe goal of this project is to find a set of guiding principles, metaphors and ideas that inform the development of a CreativeAI praxis, new theories, experiments, and applications. To explore this space, we investigate history and technology, construct a narrative and develop a vision for a future where CreativeAI helps us raise the human potential.\n\nINDEX\n\nCreativity\n\nAssisted Creation\n\nGenerative Creation\n\nConclusion\n\nAuthors & Acknowledgments\n\nReferences\n\n>>>> Subscribe to our Newsletter <<<<\n\nInterested to help out bringing AI to studios and agencies in creative industries around the world? We’re hiring at http://join.creative.ai/\n\n1. Creativity\n\nIt is central to the human condition and takes many forms in our daily activities, yet defining creativity is challenging. This section provides a selective overview of historical, theoretical and technological metaphors for creativity, relevant for CreativeAI.\n\nAncient cultures lacked our concept of creativity, including thinkers of Ancient Greece, China, and India [1]. They viewed creativity as a form of discovery. The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery would dominate the west until the Renaissance. By the 18th century, mention of creativity became more frequent, linked with the concept of imagination [2]. In late 19th century, theorists such as Walls, Wertheimer, Helmholtz and Poincaré [3] began to reflect on and publish their creative processes, pioneering the scientific study of creativity.\n\nThe scientific study of creativity produced many theories, models and systems throughout the 20th century: philosophical, sociological, historical, technical and practical. While defining creativity in objective terms was and still is challenging, the systematic study of creativity and its enabling factors allowed industries such as advertising, architecture, design, fashion, film and music to adopt creative processes rapidly and reproduce them at scale.\n\nScience, technology and creativity have a long, intertwined history. Selecting which metaphors to explore is an important research decision. We explore three metaphors: Augmented Creativity, Computational Creativity and Creative Systems.\n\nAugmented Creativity\n\nIn “As We May Think” (1949), Vannevar Bush imagines the “memex”, a desk-like device where people could search through a library of articles through a series of switches [4]. While entirely mechanical, Bush describes a device that features hyperlinked text, aggregated notes and bookmarks all extending human capacity to research and process information: The web.\n\nThe article inspired a young Douglas Engelbart to quit his job and attend graduate school at UC Berkeley [5]. At Berkeley he wrote a paper, published in 1962 titled “Augmenting the Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework”. In it, Engelbart, influenced by Bush’s memex concept, wrote about a “writing machine [that] would permit you to use a new process of composing text (..) You can integrate your new ideas more easily, and thus harness your creativity more continuously (..) This will probably allow you to devise and use even-more complex procedures to better harness your talents…” [6].\n\nEngelbart did not only provide a vision of interacting with a computer system but he had a guiding philosophy [7]. He believed that computers can be used to create an extension for the ways we do thinking, representation and association in our minds [8]. Engelbart’s vision was not just to automate processes but to multiply the power of people and collaborators by creating systems that augment our intellect, humanity and creativity. His goal was to raise the human potential [9].\n\nIvan Sutherland, a student of Claude Shannon, who in turn was a student of Vannevar Bush, built a working system inspired by the Memex already in 1963. His seminal PhD project “Sketchpad” [10] is considered to be the ancestor of modern computer-aided design (CAD) programs [11]. It demonstrated the potential of interactive computer graphics for technical and creative purposes.\n\nOnly a few years later, Engelbart’s Stanford Augmentation Research Center (ARC), invented a range of technologies, still widely used today. Among them, video conferencing and the mouse [12]. Simultaneously, John McCarthy had founded the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (SAIL). McCarthy’s group wasn’t concerned with augmentation, but wanted to reproduce the human intelligence electronically [13]. Engelbart’s Center and McCarthy’s Laboratory brought together Ph.D.s, hardware and software hackers, and high school students, including Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs [14], to experiment collectively.\n\nWhen Xerox (a paper company) decided to fund its Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in 1970 [15], it quickly attracted ARC and SAIL veterans eager to work on personal computing, user interface design and graphics. This facility developed a number of innovations like ethernet and pioneered a new metaphor for doing creative work with computer systems: the Desktop. Soon after Xerox opened its center, a more informal but equally important outlet and movement emerged to explore computers: The Homebrew Computing Club. Homebrew attracted a mix of antiwar activists, makers and computer scientists. Ultimately, Dozens of companies, including Apple and Microsoft, and technologies such as the Personal Computer (PC) would come out the Homebrew movement [16].\n\nComputational Creativity\n\nAlready in 1950, Claude Shannon was able to approximate proper English grammar and generate new sentences using computational methods [17]. Such early research in “computational creativity” lead to an interdisciplinary dialog, exploring the use of computational approaches for creative problems.\n\nStarting the early 1960s, researchers at Bell Labs were pioneering the use of computers for creativity. In a series of breakthrough experiments, they generate graphics, animations and art [18] with early computer systems. One of the most active researchers was Michael Noll. In 1970, he made a call to action: “What we really need is a new breed of artist-computer scientist” [19]. Noll’s call was soon echoed by artists and musicians, such as Brian Eno. Already in 1975, Eno was using algorithmic and generative principles to compose music — later describing his work as “using the technology that was invented to make replicas to make originals” [20].\n\nA further milestone was set in 1979 by Benoit Mandelbrot [21] with the discovery of the Mandelbrot set. He was the first to use computer graphics to display fractal geometric images. By doing so, he was able to show how visual complexity can be created from simple rules. Fractals had a profound effect on our perception of creativity and machine. It led many to ask “can a computer/algorithm be creative?” and inspired scientists, artists and engineers to experiment with creativity.\n\nVideo games pioneered the industrial application of computational creativity. Around 1978, games started to make extensive use of procedural systems to define game maps and character behaviours [22]. Such methods allowed for the development of complex gameplay without having to spend excessive time creating games. Games such as Simcity [23] by Will Wright developed these concepts further with playful interactive simulations of complex systems.\n\nSince the 1980s, focused research in industry and academia has led to the formalisation of computational creativity as a scientific discipline [24]. At the same time, a wide range of fields — such as computer science, architecture and design — started intensely experimenting with computation creatively. Finding a single definition for computational creativity is challenging, yet many have tried. A currently often cited definition is: “create computations which — if they were made by humans — would be deemed creative” [25].\n\nToday, interest in creativity from an A.I perspective has begun to blossom, with yearly conferences, schools and PhD programs dedicated to computational creativity [26]. A steady surge of ideas and techniques, that are at least computationally creative in intention, have moved into the mainstream: A.I characters, artificial musicians, journalist bots, generative architecture and neural nets that “dream”. While such systems are nowhere near human capabilities, they are actively being used in culture, industry and academia to create outputs that are increasingly met with great curiosity by the public. In many areas, systems are making the leap from experimentation to production, leading to new creative processes and outputs.\n\nCreative Systems\n\nAfter World War II, the United States enjoyed a period of euphoria. The Allied Powers had triumphed — seemingly through science, technology and systems thinking. In this environment, the Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation organized a series of conferences from 1946 to 1953 “on the workings of the human mind” [27], later titled “Cybernetics”. The aim of the conferences was to promote meaningful communication across scientific disciplines and restore unity to science [28]. It included people like J.C.R. Licklider, Margaret Mead, Heinz von Foerster, John von Neumann, Claude Shannon and Norbert Wiener.\n\nInspired by the conference, in 1948 Wiener published his seminal work “Cybernetics: or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine” [29] and Shannon published “A Mathematical Theory of Communication” [30]. Such works laid the foundation for today’s information age by providing a scientific theory for concepts such as “information”, “communication”, “feedback” and “control”.\n\nWiener defined cybernetics as the science of adaptive, feedback-based control [31]. The name comes from the ancient greek word for steersman. Cybernetics takes the view that control in complex environments must be conversational. It requires not just action but also listening and adaptation: To steer a boat across a lake, you have to use your tiller and sails to adjust to changing winds and currents. The cybernetic model of control is circular, decisions depend not only on how well people carry out their intentions but also on how the environment responds.\n\nAn early link between Cybernetics and Creativity was made in 1968 with the exhibition “Cybernetic Serendipity”, at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London [32]. The show explored connections between creativity and technology. Artists such as Gordon Pask and Nam June Paik were using systems to generated music, poetry, movies, paintings and computer graphics [33].\n\nThis new spirit of creation was addressed by Buckminster Fuller in his notion of the “comprehensive designer”, which he describes as “an emerging synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist” [34].\n\nIn the following decades, cybernetic ideas would profoundly impact thinking in fields such as business, politics, art, design and architecture [35]. As Pask noted, “architects are first and foremost systems designers,” but they lack “an underpinning and unifying theory… Cybernetics is a discipline which fills the bill” [36]. By systematically integrating context and relationships, cybernetics pushed creation & design beyond its object-based approach.\n\nWhile cybernetics went out of fashion in the 1970s, its legacy lives on in fields such as Control Theory and Complex Systems Studies, Interaction Design and Design Thinking [37]. Today holistic approaches, that attempt to combine technological, human and social needs, are cited in many fields. Inspired by cybernetics, creative systems thinking has found “surprising” application in areas such as software (agile, open-source), management (Google 20% time), labour (Uber / Lyft) and resource allocation (algorithmic trading / amazon).\n\nExamples / Media\n\nThe following a selection of projects from Augmented Creativity, Computational Creativity and Creative Systems research.

In this process we investigated three metaphors for creativity: Augmented Creativity, Computational Creativity and Creative Systems. In the following sections, we consider how these metaphors have developed further and extrapolate two main categories of activity today: Assisted Creation and Generative Creation.\n\n2. Assisted Creation\n\nHumans have used tools to extend their creative capabilities since the stone age — adapting to changing needs. While mastering creative skills used to be attainable only for few, assistive systems are making creativity more accessible. This section presents three generations of assisted creation systems and explores how they democratise and escalate creativity.\n\nInspired by Engelbart’s vision from the 1960s, countless scientific papers and experiments explored how to assist humans to perform “creative” tasks — or as researcher Ben Shneiderman defined it, technologies that allow more people “to be more creative more of the time” [1]. Such research, coupled with the emerging PC revolution, allowed companies like Apple and Lotus to build early digital applications for creative tasks. Ultimately, this movement led to the founding of companies such as Autodesk (1979) [2] and Adobe (1982) [3], that exclusively focused on building tools and systems that enable creativity.\n\nIndustry pioneered the development of first generation assisted creation systems in the 1980s: Photoshop, Autocad, Pro-Tools, Word and many more. First generation systems mimic analogue tools with digital means [4]. The human’s full attention is required to drive the creative process: Feedback is slow and assistance limited. Yet, such tools allowed expert and non-experts alike to be more creative, which lead to a flood of new creative processes and outputs.\n\nThe camera Autofocus, invented by Leica in 1976 [5], is an early example of a second generation assisted creation system. In these systems, humans and machines negotiate the creative process through tight action-feedback loops. The machine is provided with greater agency so control can be shared. Decisions are made collaboratively with the system. Second generation systems are ubiquitous today. They are being used in production across cultures and industries.\n\nAutocorrect, invented in 1991 by Dean Hachamovitch at Microsoft [6], changed how millions of people write — Autotune, invented in 1998 by Andy Hildebrand at Exxon [7], transformed how music is made. The impact such systems had on creativity is hard to measure, yet clearly significant: By lowering the bar of mastery, assisted creation systems empowered experts and non-experts alike to shift their attention to higher level issues, perform complex creative tasks more reliably and experiment quickly. While such systems are not with out their risks and complications [8]- ultimately, they enable us to be more creative, more of the time.\n\nAssisted Creation 3.0\n\nSecond generation systems are often limited and limiting: Negotiation for control is blunt and interactions not fine grained. Due to such limitation, widely used tools such as autocomplete have a mixed reputation. A set of new ideas and techniques, coming from diverse research disciplines, promise to overcome previous limitations. We define them as Third generation assisted creation systems (AC 3.0). A shared vision is to design systems that negotiate the creative process in fine-grained conversations, augment creative capabilities and accelerate the skill acquisition time, from novice to expert. Third generation assisted creation principles are finding practical use across an expanding range of creative tasks.\n\nTo name a few examples:\n\nAssisted Drawing helps illustrators to draw, by correcting strokes.\n\nAssisted Writing helps authors to write, by improving text style.\n\nAssisted Video helps directors to edit, by fine-tuning movie cuts.\n\nAssisted Music helps musicians to make music, by suggesting ideas.\n\nDescribing the breadth of ongoing research in a few examples is challenging, as there are many ideas and domains to explore. To track assisted creation, we analyzed recent research publications across many organisations with the help of machine learning, graph theory and visualization. Judged on quantitative measures (publications and experiments), assisted creation research and use is on the rise across creative disciplines. Notably, Machine Learning (ML) and Human Computer Interaction (HCI) are contributing a steady stream of research, relevant for the design of assisted creation systems. Together, ML and HCI are providing us with a conceptual framework for machine intelligence in a human context.\n\nAlready in 2011 Rebecca Anne Fiebrink, HCI/ML researcher at Goldsmith University, fittingly asked: “Can we find a use for machine learning algorithms in unconventional contexts, such as the support of human creativity and discovery?“ [9]. In the years since, Fiebrink’s call has been taken up by a multidisciplinary community: a wide range of new ideas, theories, experiments, approaches and products are being explored and developed. Ongoing HCI/ML research offer us new possibilities and metaphors for the design of assisted creation systems.\n\nDemocratisation and Escalation\n\nBy researching Assisted Creation, we recognise emerging trends, with implications for creativity: 1. Assistive Creation Systems are making a wide range of creative skills more accessible. 2. Collaborative platforms, such as Online Video and Open Source, are making it easier to learn new creative skills. As these trends are increasingly converging, they are accelerating the skill acquisition time from novice to expert. This is leading to a phenomenon we have named “the democratisation of creativity”. We explore these trends further and extrapolate a vision.\n\nTREND 1: Creativity is becoming more accessible.\n\nWhile having a photo studio or music recording studio at home was but a dream for a 1980s creator, in today’s world it’s one click away. Such trends, observable for many creative tasks, are empowering non-experts and experts alike to be more creative, more of the time. One could say, the price of creation is falling. In this trajectory, a key challenge has been the “high barrier to entry” [10] for those without specific skills or talents. Today, Assisted creation systems are increasingly lowering this “high bar” by actively guiding creative processes and bootstrapping the learning of new skills.\n\nTREND 2: Collaboration is becoming more accessible.\n\nAlready in the 1960’s, Engelbart’s vision was not only about enhancing individuals: He wanted to augment the collective intelligence and creativity of groups, to improve collaboration and group problem-solving ability. With the rise of collaboration and social software, and a deeper theoretical understanding of how groups can use technology to self-organize and cooperate, systems are emerging that can make groups effectively more creative. A key notion is that creativity is a collective process that can be strengthened through technology, but goes beyond just technological means. Human capabilities and tool capabilities have to be raised in sync.\n\nThe escalation of creativity\n\nBy projecting these trends into the (near) future, we can start to imagine a scenario we call “the escalation of creativity”: a world where creativity is highly accessible and anyone can write at the level of Shakespeare, compose music on par with Bach, paint in the style of Van Gogh, be a master designer and discover new forms of creative expression. For a person who does not have a particular creative skill, gaining a new capability through assisted creation systems is highly empowering. If creative tasks can be master on-demand and access is democratically shared, age-old notions such as “expert” or “design” are bound to be redefined. Further, this escalation can lead us to scenarios such as using creativity as means of empathic communication — at scale.\n\nEven though such scenarios are currently fiction, thinking about the implications of the democratisation and escalation of creativity, influences today’s design decisions. Creating systems that are respectful of cultural practices, support different types of creativity, are responsive to human needs, provide feedback transparently and are ethically grounded is proving to be highly challenging already now.\n\nAutomation or Augmentation\n\nA first question we should ask ourselves when talking about the democratisation and escalation of creativity is “Are we designing tools that empower us or autopilots that replace us?”. Such questions have been negotiated in a global discussion, starting over 5000 years ago with the use of oxen in agriculture [11]. History shows us that any technology has feedback dynamics and momentum, or in the words of Marshall McLuhan: “First we shape our tools, thereafter they shape us” [12]. Nonetheless, we see technology not as a primary force of nature: Human decisions and actions play a key role — negotiated through culture, politics & power.\n\nA second question to address is “what does automation mean?”. Our current understanding of automation is heavily influenced by ideas from the industrial revolution: mass producing goods with mechanical butlers. While concerns about mass unemployment due to certain types of automation have to be taken serious, automation is not inherently bad; some “jobs” might be better left to machines, as they can be inhumane and wasteful of human potential. Shifting the discussion to one of human potential and capability — reflecting on our strengths and weaknesses, needs and dreams — allows us to reframe fears of automation as opportunities for augmentation.\n\nAugmentation is not the same as automation: Where automation promises to “free us from inhumane tasks”, augmentation aims at strengthening our capabilities. It is the notion of raising the collective human potential, not replacing it. To analyse this notion further, we refer to a framework introduced by NASA, for thinking about autonomy: The H-Metaphor [13]. It proposes to view our interactions with systems more as we do with horses, instead of butlers.\n\nThink of a rider on a horse: If a rider uses deliberate movements, the horse follows exactly. As the control becomes vaguer, the horse resorts to familiar behaviour patterns and takes over control. Being able to “loosen or tighten the reins” leads to smooth ebb and flow of control between human and horse, rather than instructions and responses. Considering feedback and control is key.\n\nHCI/ML Researcher Roderick Murray-Smith suggests using the H-Metaphor and control theory when thinking about interface dynamics. He predicts:\n\n“Future devices will be able to sense much more on and around them, offering us more ways to interact. We can use this to let go sometimes and be casual about our interactions” [14].\n\nHaving the ability to interact with systems casually, and let go of control at times, promises substantially improved forms of human-machine and human-human collaboration. By combining human intuition with machine intelligence, shared control principles lets us imagine new creative processes, not possible independently by either human or machine. Such principles promise to make creativity more accessible and raise our collective potential.\n\nWhile a range of dystopian outcomes can easily be imagined, we deliberately choose to explore a vision that focuses on opportunities, not fears. In order to prevent bleak future scenarios, complex metaphorical and ethical questions can not be an afterthought, but are an opportunity for collaborative exploration and a call to action for collective decision making.\n\nExamples / Media\n\nThe following is a selective overview of ongoing assisted creation research, experiments and products, across a range of creative tasks / disciplines.\n\nAssisted Photography\n\n1.

Generative Creation\n\nOur abilities to represent complex creative problems is increasing. A fundamental shift in perspective is allowing us to revisit many creative problems. The following section presents generative creation and explores how it democratises and escalates creativity.\n\nRepresentation has played a pivotal role throughout human history. Ever more detailed representational systems have allowed us to communicate complex phenomena in understandable terms — to organise information, manage problems and make informed decisions. Since the invention of writing, representational strategies have evolved substantially. From the inclusion of measurement in the early 16th century [1], to the adoption of perspective drawing in the Renaissance [2]: New forms of representation have lead to revolutions in science and technology.\n\nAbstraction strategies, such as drawing and writing, try to represent big ideas with highly limited means. They force humans to keep all the moving parts in their heads. As Matt Jezyk (Autodesk) suggests, such tools were invented in the age of documentation, where the bandwidth to represent problems was low [3]. Jezyk describes the 20th century as the age of optimization: New techniques, such as simulation expanded our representational bandwidth significantly and allowed many disciplines and industries to adopt reproducible abstraction methods at scale.\n\nHistorically, the use of simulations were largely isolated in different fields. 20th century studies of systems theory and cybernetics combined with the proliferation of computers led to a more unified, systematic perspective: the age of models. A Model is a high-bandwidth, computational representation of reality. The model represents the system — its characteristics and behaviors — whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time. This new representational paradigm does not rely on abstraction methods but tries to make “things that behave like the thing they represent”.\n\nModels give us an infrastructure for representing the overall problem. They help us to understand complex interconnected issues and develop a deeper understanding of inherent logic and relationships of parts. While modeling techniques go back till at least the early 1940s (Nuclear-bomb simulation) [4], it was the exclusive domain of experts and inhibitively expensive. Today, modeling and simulation methods are becoming highly accessible and cheap.\n\nWe argue that accessible modeling techniques are allowing us to negotiate a wide range of creative problems from a higher level perspective and create differently. We explore this emerging pattern — culture, technology and implications — and name it the generative age.\n\nThe Generative Age\n\nAlready in the 1960s, Engelbart pointed to the impact digital technologies have on our representational ability: “We can represent information structures within the computer that will generally be far too complex to study directly” [5] . A conceptual link between these new representational abilities and creativity was made in the early 2000s by designers like Patrik Schumacher, co-founder of Zaha Hadid Architects. He describes an “ontological shift”, from the platonic ideal shapes of the past 5000 years, to new computational “primitives“ [6].\n\nWhat he was alluding to, is a fundamental shift in perspective, from 3D to nD: While the renaissance age gave us the ability to represent reality from a three dimensional perspective (3D), the generative age enables us to represent (model) complexity and see (infer) reality from a probabilistic, or high dimensional perspective (nD). Inspired by such ideas, influential design manifestos [7], books [8], and software [9] were published, laying the foundation for a new movement: Generative Design.\n\nMichael Hansmeyer, an architect, describes Generative Design as “thinking about designing not the object but a process to generate objects” [10]. He is implying a shift from object to process — from certainty to probability — suggesting that instead of designing one “artefact”, we use computational models to design processes that generate infinite “artefacts”.\n\nEssentially, Generative Design is an umbrella term — describing ongoing research and developments in diverse fields, ranging from design, architecture, industrial design to machine learning. A shared vision is to empower human designers to explore a greater number of design possibilities from a new perspective and lower the time between intention and execution. In the generative age, the cost of creating diversity and complexity is falling. This allows us to create an order of magnitude more elaborate form and function. For example: bicycles that are mass-customizable to people’s individual taste, while using a fraction of the material traditionally required. While generative approaches are not constrained to any particular field, notably architecture and more recently design have been among the first disciplines to systematically take hold of these approaches, as illustrated in the following examples.\n\nWhile Generative Models have been used for creative applications since the 1970s (procedural game), recent research advances — driven notably by Machine Learning and Deep Learning — are leading to a quantitative and qualitative leap in generative modeling capabilities. Today, new models are released practically every week. Research projects with acronyms such as VAE [11], DRAW [12], VRNN [13], GAN [14], DCGAN [15], LAPGAN [16] and GRAN [17] are allowing us to model complexity with greater resolution and apply modelling techniques to a wider range of creative problems.\n\nThe application of generative machine learning models to creative tasks is a recent development, yet it is already leading to the discovery of new primitives for creation: Design building blocks that are applicable across many creative domains. Such creative generative models have been successfully used to generate fashion items, paintings, music, poems, song lyrics, journalistic news articles, furniture, image and video effects, industrial design, comics, illustrations and architecture, to name just a few of its applications. See “Examples” section for a selection of projects.\n\nGenerative models let us explore data in unprecedented ways. To give an example, imagine a chair: we can represent its characteristics, such as color, height or style, as dimensions in high-dimensional information spaces. This space can be filled with data about millions of chairs. Chairs with similar characteristics are mapped in vicinity of each other. This creates a chair model, which can be explored and visualized.\n\nSuch high-dimensional topologies allow us to easily retrieve information, explore data and ask questions about relationships, logic and meaning: e.g. “Show me all chairs that are red and tall”. Further, they allow us to make predictions and infer new characteristics: e.g. “Show me all chairs, that are similar to chair A and B but unlike chair C”. Finally, we can use high-dimensional spaces to generate new objects: e.g. “Make me a chair that resembles a car, and is comfortable to sit in”.\n\nGenerative models invite designers to play with data and generated infinite imaginative variations and solutions to creative problems. By having powerful tools to explore, optimise and test creative design ideas rapidly, we computationally maximise the opportunity for serendipity. While generative models can be used to perform classical creative tasks efficiently, additionally they open up a range of new creative capabilities, incomparable with classical methods.\n\nArtificial Serendipity: Systems that maximise the opportunity for serendipity.\n\nRecent advances in machine learning make it possible to include data from different “modalities” in a single model. It enables us to translate between modalities. The key insight is that all forms of information can be encoded in a shared information space. Early research into multimodality has lead to a set of widely adopted systems: “Auto Translate” [18] lets us translate from one language to another, “Speech2Text” [19] transcribes audio to text. Multi-modal machine learning is allowing for more complex scenarios, which go beyond simple translation of data: Generate Images from Text [20], Text from Videos [21], Music from Movement [22], 3D shapes from shopping data, etc. We call this:\n\nArtificial Synesthesia: Systems that enable inter-sensory experiences.\n\nDemocratisation and Escalation\n\nThe Generative age gives us a new canvas for creativity, which we have only just started to explore. While it is hard to predict where these developments will take us, emerging trends are worth investigating — as their impact can already be felt. By extrapolating these developments and thinking about their implications, we arrive at a scenario we call “the democratisation and escalation of creativity”.\n\nWe explore this notion further and describe four trends:\n\n1. Generative Perspective:\n\nFor the first time in human history, we can create from a blended, or generative perspective — as it mixes elements of the collective human perspective, machine perspective and individual perspective. It gives us the ability to transcend creative constraints, such as habit, socialisation and education, and create objects which are altogether new.\n\n2. Generative Predictions:\n\nTake the concept of recommendation, personalization and customisation and apply it to the creative process. The vision is to have systems that suggest potential next “actions”, allow people to casually adjust aspects of designs according to personal needs and histories, and enable us to playfully discover creativity.\n\n3. Generative Markets:\n\nIn the future, generative models might be shared in an open collaborative model marketplace (OCMM). While current marketplaces allow us to trade artefacts/products, generative markets will facilitate the sharing of recipes to create unlimited new artefacts. In essence, think of it as GitHub for open-source creativity.\n\n4. Generative Manufacturing: Emerging digital manufacturing techniques, such as 3D printing, combined with generative systems used to create physical objects. Early signs of such trends can be observed in things such as Shapeways, Kickstarter and the “maker movement”. It’s starting to redefine the relationship between creation, production and consumption.\n\nWhen projecting such scenarios even further into the future, we arrive at the realisation that Generative Creation has profound implications for fields like technology, manufacturing, resource allocation, economics and politics. Already today, Generative Creation methods are leading to the democratisation of creativity in many areas. By lowering the time between intention and realisation, Generative Creation is leading to an escalation of new “artefacts” — forms, functions and aesthetics. It allows us to explore what lies beyond the artefact.\n\nCombined with new manufacturing techniques, generative creation is redefining concepts such as production, consumption, labour and innovation. As current economic models are largely built around the notion of “artefacts”, a renegotiation of fundamentals is foreseeable. While predicting the future of the demo-cratisation and escalation of creativity is impossible, thinking about narrative, opportunities and implications, informs today’s decisions and visions. Or in the words of Robert Anton Wilson:\n\nExamples\n\nThe following is a selective overview of generative creation research, experiments and products, across a range of creative tasks / disciplines.\n\nGenerative Experiments\n\n1.

It led to an in-depth investigation into creativity, which reinforced our initial intuition that creativity is a central, evolving force throughout human history. New metaphors such as Augmented Creativity, Computational Creativity and Creative Systems allowed us to approach creativity from new perspectives and explore how it intersects with technology.\n\nDuring this journey, we have tried to think about creativity and technology in a structured way. This has allowed us to recognize, analyze and define emerging creation patterns. We focused on two general types: Assisted Creation and Generative Creation. Together, these patterns are leading to a vision we call the democratization and escalation of creativity: A world where creativity is highly accessible, through systems that empower us to create from new perspectives and raise the collective human potential. Through our research, we learned to appreciate creativity as an ever evolving, driving force of humanity and as a wide open frontier for interdisciplinary research and development.\n\nA primary goal of this research project was to find a set of guiding principles, metaphors and ideas, that inform the development of future theories, experiments, and applications. By combining different domains into one narrative, we formulate a new school, or praxis for creativity: CreativeAI. Its desire is to explore and celebrate creativity. Its goal is to develop systems that raise the human potential. Its belief is that addressing the “what” and “why” is as important as the “how”. Its conviction is that complex ethical questions are not an afterthought, but an opportunity to be creative collectively.\n\nFinally, CreativeAI is a question, rather than an answer. Its only demand is more collaboration and creativity. It is an invitation for play!\n\n“The creation of something new is not accomplished by the intellect but by the play instinct acting from inner necessity. The creative mind plays with the objects it loves” — Carl Jung\n\nInterested to help out bringing AI to studios and agencies in creative industries around the world?
