        "text": "Just over 150 apps are updated to run a rich experience on #visionpro, the rest will work as a window in 3D space. The first 10 hours of the device will be exciting, followed by a long wait for every new spatial experience. While there are many reasons for this ranging from new platform, programming effort, unsure of the market response, etc., by far the biggest reason for lack of apps is just the form factor. The new computing paradigm that spatial computers (including the Quest series) offers requires a niche skill - space design. This is incredibly hard since there are few people who do this well (and they are in the movie or game business). Today's apps have to deal with a small rectangle for user interface, but spatial computers make the entire field of view a computer screen with depth. It requires a fundamental rethink of using depth for user interaction. This is hard enough, but I need to program the entire thing - much much harder. We will see more apps coming to spatial computers over the next months and years, but the way these apps are created will change. Think no-code, genAI, creating in 3D, etc. as means of interacting new software platforms to create spatial apps. Think different?\n\nWe are in the paint-makers phase of computing. Before there were the great painters of history someone needed to invent the paint. They needed to work out how to create the palette of colours that the great artists would work with. The first painters were paint makers. They understood the technical details of colour on canvas - but they just hadn't learned how to use it to make great art. They didn't see what was possible with their humble colour tech - miraculous art needed more than just art supplies - it required the emergence of the artist. That's where coding is now. There is a widespread understanding of the tools, but code is still not yet considered an art. That will change. Just as painting, music, photography and cinematography all started as experimental technologies, and then blossomed into true art forms, code will experience that evolution too. Just as it was hard to imagine from the first flickering movie clips that there would be whole industries creating spectacular, widescreen technicolor visual tales - software will evolve from the current inhuman mechanistic model, into something truly human and beautiful - just don't count on the current technologists to get us there. They still think it's about the paint.\n\nI've been fortunate to witness the incredible evolution of technology in the digital realm. My journey began back in 1998 when I embarked on multimedia and animation training at C-Dac. Back then, I immersed myself in learning tools like 3D Studio R4 DOS, Softimage, Animate Pro, Photoshop, and Director, all running on humble hardware: Pentium 1, 64 MB RAM, and a 4 GB hard disk. The server space at the institution? A modest 35 GB. Since those early days, I've made it a point to stay abreast of the constant upgrades and advancements in both hardware and software, as well as the ever-evolving landscape of internet technology. The progress has far exceeded my initial expectations, unfolding at an unprecedented pace that has reshaped human interactions. Today, the idea of life without a mobile phone and internet is simply unimaginable. In this era of rapid technological evolution, awareness has surged, setting higher expectations and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. Even complex subjects are being transformed into engaging forms of entertainment and beyond. We find ourselves in the age of immersive technology, where everything can be categorized into three major segments: Entertainment, Edutainment, and Infotainment. And we're only witnessing the beginning of immersive experience technology, which will go beyond audio and video to integrate other sensory experiences. In the future, quantum computers and supercomputers will play pivotal roles in shaping this landscape. The development of apps and software has become remarkably accessible, with platforms like NSL (Natural Solution Language) no-code/low-code making it easier than ever. Furthermore, the integration of AI/ML has streamlined development processes, making them not only easier but also more effective. I'm grateful to have been part of this digital journey, and I invite you to share your thoughts and connect with me. Let's keep the conversation going as we explore the endless possibilities of technology together! #Technology #DigitalTransformation #AI #ML #ImmersiveTech #Innovation #EdTech #Entertainment #Infotainment #NSL #NoCode #LowCode #QuantumComputing #Supercomputing\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è EXCLUSIVE PIKA LABS TIP ‚ö†Ô∏è Discord user tekwitch was, to our knowledge, the first to truly establish such a high impact, novel approach to driving parallax movement using advanced prompt techniques. Sounds technical right? Put simply, this technique plays with the depth perception and how elements within the frame appear to behave, 3-dimensionally speaking, often coming towards the frame, rotating and more, even independently of one another. Considering Pika Labs is a free tool, this technique can be a powerful way to animate images beyond X and Y axes. Is it perfect? Can it compete with Runway 2.1? It's different, but that's not really the point. Pika is doing highly advanced work and the showcases they have been sharing of their upcoming tools and the integrations they are developing points to a very bright future. At this point, as Meta have shown with their 2-factor generative video creation, novel approaches and thinking to present and past challenges are what is capable of setting tools apart. With the available resources on GitHub and Hugging ü§ó Face, anyone with the right team of developers and creative thinkers can position themselves competitively in their own platform and tool design. In the Pika Labs Creation Jam channel, 'Stabilising volumes with /encrypt_image, tekwitch provided the following base prompt to play with: [using /encrypt add an image as message, then select prompt and-if you want to add a second image] (tekwitch:) Then add this prompt, and run the encryption: ```selfleveling: [subject context]. [further context setting]. speedrun sidescroller. outlined layers. tenement back alley glass canyon neon logoform cyberpunk background. charring, bilaterally symmetrical. [closing context identifiers]. dramatic lightwells behind -ar 9:16 -m 4 -neg nostalgic anamorphic, deforming, morphing, warping, destabilizing, crude, blurring, defocusing, decohering, acohering, misaligning, realigning, diffusing, diffusing, diffusing, occluding, spreading, diffusing, concept, speedpaint, sketchy, nonEuclidian, orthogonal, photobombing -camera rotate acw -- This prompt was adapted to the images used to create \"War Machine\". We have added our own 'context' brackets to tekwitch's original prompt so it is easier for you to play with. -- Here at #nextelligence we are EVERYWHERE. Jericho McClellan and I have our ears to the ground regarding the most cutting edge approaches to content creation using generative AI. -- What do you think of the technique? It's early days so what would you like to see moving forward? How can this tool or technique be used in ways it isn't already?
