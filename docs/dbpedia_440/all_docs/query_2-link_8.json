        "text": "Ivan Edward Sutherland is an American computer scientist and Internet pioneer, widely regarded as the \"father of computer graphics\". His early work in computer graphics as well as his teaching with David C. Evans in that subject at the University of Utah in the 1970s was pioneering in the field. Sutherland, Evans, and their students from that era invented several foundations of modern computer graphics.
