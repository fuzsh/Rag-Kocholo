Lick’s successor seemed the perfect man to manage this expanding program. Ivan Sutherland was a brilliant MIT graduate who happened to be serving with the Army as a first lieutenant. Only twenty-six, he had already amassed an enviable research record, the crowning achievement of which had been the development of the first interactive computer graphics program. Known as Sketchpad, the system allowed a user to draw highly detailed and complex drawings directly on a computer’s cathode-ray screen using a light pen and store them in memory.\n\n…\n\nThey could not have known that within a few short years Bob Taylor would outshine them both in his influence over computer research in the United States. The humble job of serving as deputy to a first lieutenant with a Pentagon staff appointment was about to set Bob Taylor on the path to his, and the computer’s, destiny. Ivan Sutherland spent scarcely eighteen months at IPTO. Late in 1965 Harvard offered him a tenured position. He was officially gone by June 1966 but unofficially much earlier. By January or February that year Taylor was already running IPTO all by himself. The apprenticeship had been short, but edifying enough.\n\n…\n\nThus was computing rendered more remote and intimidating than ever—a backwards trend exemplified in Clark’s view by the archetypal system at MIT: “That of a very large International Business Machine in a tightly sealed Computation Center: The computer not as tool, but as demigod.” What Clark found even more troubling was that subdividing the main processor, as time-sharing did, rendered impossible the sort of display-based research that Ivan Sutherland had achieved so spectacularly on the TX-2. No user of a time-shared computer could ever monopolize the processor long enough to drive a coherent visual display as Sutherland had. (Clark allowed the TX-2 to be shared, but only serially—you signed up for a block of time on it, but during that period the entire machine was yours.)\n\nBootstrapping: Douglas Engelbart, Coevolution, and the Origins of Personal Computing (Writing Science) by Thierry Bardini\n\nApple II, augmented reality, Bill Duvall, Charles Babbage, classic study, Compatible Time-Sharing System, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, conceptual framework, Donald Davies, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, Dynabook, experimental subject, Grace Hopper, hiring and firing, hypertext link, index card, information retrieval, invention of hypertext, Ivan Sutherland, Jaron Lanier, Jeff Rulifson, John von Neumann, knowledge worker, Leonard Kleinrock, Menlo Park, military-industrial complex, Mother of all demos, Multics, new economy, Norbert Wiener, Norman Mailer, packet switching, Project Xanadu, QWERTY keyboard, Ralph Waldo Emerson, RAND corporation, RFC: Request For Comment, Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, Silicon Valley, Steve Crocker, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Levy, Stewart Brand, stochastic process, Ted Nelson, the medium is the message, theory of mind, Turing test, unbiased observer, Vannevar Bush, Whole Earth Catalog, work culture\n\nAt the beginning of his tenure at the IPTO, Licklider formed an advisory committee composed of the representatives of the main funding institutions in- volved in computing at that time. One member was another young psycholo- gist, Robert Taylor, who was then heading a research program on computing at NASA.16 In 1964, Licklider resigned from ARPA in order to return to MIT and was replaced as director of the IPTO by Ivan Sutherland, at that time a 26- year-old army lieutenant at Fort Meade, Maryland. Taylor served as Suther- land's associate director until 1965, when Sutherland accepted a faculty posi- tion at Harvard. Thus, Taylor became the third director of the IPTO. 22 IntroductIon Over the next five years, the IPTO funded twenty or so large research proj- ects, mostly at u.s. universities. 17 Particularly heavy funding went to the computer science departments at MIT, Carnegie-Mellon University, and Stan- ford University, three departments still top-rated in computer science today.\n\n…\n\nWhat saved my program from extinction was the arrival of an out-of-the-blue support offer from Bob Taylor, who at that time was a psychologist working at NASA headquarters. 23 Thanks to Robert Taylor, NASA support started from midyear 1964 to mid- year 1965 at a level of about eighty-five thousand dollars. Taylor's support became even more important when he became Ivan Sutherland's second in 24 Introduction command at the IPTO in July 1964, and then when he took the direction of the IPTO, in June 1966. Engelbart's approach differed from Licklider's both essentially and prag- matically, despite the apparent agreement on the need do some kind of human- computer symbiosis.\n\n…\n\nIn this second subnetwork, the IPTO's three main research areas were in- vestigated by prestigious scientists such as John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Wesley Clark, Edward Fredkin, and younger members such as Ivan Suther- land. MIT also had operated an early time-sharing system since Decem- ber 1958,30 and Ivan Sutherland developed Sketchpad, the first graphics soft- ware, on the TX-2 computer. The research on artificial intelligence certainly gave strength to the East Coast subnetwork. Apart from the MIT-centered Boston community, it also included the Carnegie-Mellon University group led by Herbert Simon and Allen Newell (joined by Alan Perlis) after they had left RAND in the early 1960'S.3I Almost everybody in this community agreed on the necessity of time shar- ing as a preliminary step toward interactive computing.\n\nThe Dream Machine: J.C.R.

Now, Taylor knew full well that he didn't command the kind of automatic re- spect from the ARPA community that Sutherland had commanded. In their THE INTERGALACTIC NETWORK 263 eyes, Ivan Sutherland had been a technological genius-just the kind of man the agency needed in that position. But Taylor was, well, a psychologist. With no Ph.D. \"Can you imagine going from J. C. R. Licklider to Ivan Sutherland to . . . Bob Taylor?\" asks one PI, remembering his reaction at the time. No one said anything overt, of course, since Taylor did control the money- for the time being. No, they just conveyed an ineffable air of condescension, an unmistakable message that the community considered him to be a mere admin- istrator, a caretaker who was keeping the chair warm until a good technical per- son could be brought in.\n\n…\n\n\"Some of the pro- fessional bureaucrats were dumbfounded. They had a history of giving grants to individual people in twenty-thousand-dollar chunks. But Lick was talking about millions of dollars and whole teams of people. It was as though these folks had encountered this alien creature: friendly, but strange.\" Another participant, Ivan Sutherland, remembers his first meeting in 1964: \"These people met, period. The group had no charter, no responsibilities, no budget, no purpose-but it was a great thing. We would discuss what was important, what was current, and what was going on. Precisely because the group had no charter, it was a wonderful way of getting information flow between the agencies.\"\n\n…\n\nFortunately, one of ARPA's traditions was that outgoing office directors were allowed to recruit their own successors; all Lick had to do was to come up with an experienced, senior person with good credentials, and everybody would be happy. So Lick, characteristically, nominated a totally inexperienced and very junior candidate whose credentials were about the most awkward and inconven- ient conceivable in the Pentagon. He was a skinny, intense fellow named Ivan Sutherland. He was twenty-six years old. And at the time he was a first lieu- tenant in the army. It wasn't that he hadn't tried to find someone more senior, Lick protested in his 1988 interview; it was just that the answers he'd gotten ranged from \"No!\" to \"Hell, No!\" \"Most of my colleagues would much rather spend the government money doing research back in the lab than coast another year or two or three in Washington,\" he said.\n\nTools for Thought: The History and Future of Mind-Expanding Technology by Howard Rheingold\n\nAda Lovelace, Alan Turing: On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem, Bletchley Park, card file, cellular automata, Charles Babbage, Claude Shannon: information theory, combinatorial explosion, Compatible Time-Sharing System, computer age, Computer Lib, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, conceptual framework, Conway's Game of Life, Douglas Engelbart, Dynabook, experimental subject, Hacker Ethic, heat death of the universe, Howard Rheingold, human-factors engineering, interchangeable parts, invention of movable type, invention of the printing press, Ivan Sutherland, Jacquard loom, John von Neumann, knowledge worker, machine readable, Marshall McLuhan, Menlo Park, Neil Armstrong, Norbert Wiener, packet switching, pattern recognition, popular electronics, post-industrial society, Project Xanadu, RAND corporation, Robert Metcalfe, Silicon Valley, speech recognition, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Stewart Brand, Ted Nelson, telemarketer, The Home Computer Revolution, Turing machine, Turing test, Vannevar Bush, Von Neumann architecture\n\nClaude Shannon was a bona fide prodigy, twenty-two years old when he published (in 1937) the famous MIT master's thesis that linked electrical circuitry to logical formalisms. He was the peer of pioneers like Turing, Wiener, and von Neumann, the teacher of the first generation of artificial intelligence explorers like John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, and the mentor of Ivan Sutherland, who has been one of the most important contemporary infonaut-architects. When Shannon's papers establishing information theory were published in 1948, he was thirty-two. The impact on science of this man's career was incalculable for these two contributions alone, but he also wrote a pioneering article on the artificial intelligence question of game-playing machines, published in 1950.\n\n…\n\nHe doesn't like to teach. He doesn't like giving lectures. His lectures are jewels, all of them. They sound spontaneous, but in reality they are very, very carefully prepared. In the early sixties, one of the extremely few students Shannon personally took on, another MIT bred prodigy by the name of Ivan Sutherland, made quite a splash on the computer science scene. By the mid-1970s, Shannon, now in his sixties, had become a literal gray eminence. By the early 1980s, he still hadn't stopped thinking about things, and considering his track record, it isn't too farfetched to speculate that his most significant discoveries have yet to be published.\n\n…\n\nLicklider remembers the first official meeting on interactive graphics, where the first wave of preliminary research was presented and discussed in order to plan the assault on the main problem of getting information from the innards of the new computers to the surface of various kinds of display screens. It was at this meeting, Licklider recalls, that Ivan Sutherland first took the stage in a spectacular way. \"Sutherland was a graduate student at the time,\" Licklider remembers, \"and he hadn't been invited to give a paper.\" But because of the graphics program he was creating for his Ph.D. thesis, because he was a prot�g� of Claude Shannon, and because of the rumors that he was just the kind of prodigy ARPA was seeking, he was invited to the meeting.\n\nDawn of the New Everything: Encounters With Reality and Virtual Reality by Jaron Lanier\n\n4chan, air gap, augmented reality, back-to-the-land, Big Tech, Bill Atkinson, Buckminster Fuller, Burning Man, carbon footprint, cloud computing, collaborative editing, commoditize, Computer Lib, cosmological constant, creative destruction, crowdsourcing, deep learning, Donald Trump, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Hofstadter, El Camino Real, Elon Musk, fake news, Firefox, game design, general-purpose programming language, gig economy, Google Glasses, Grace Hopper, Gödel, Escher, Bach, Hacker Ethic, Hans Moravec, Howard Rheingold, hype cycle, impulse control, information asymmetry, intentional community, invisible hand, Ivan Sutherland, Jaron Lanier, John Gilmore, John Perry Barlow, John von Neumann, Kevin Kelly, Kickstarter, Kuiper Belt, lifelogging, mandelbrot fractal, Mark Zuckerberg, Marshall McLuhan, Menlo Park, military-industrial complex, Minecraft, Mitch Kapor, Mondo 2000, Mother of all demos, Murray Gell-Mann, Neal Stephenson, Netflix Prize, Network effects, new economy, Nick Bostrom, Norbert Wiener, Oculus Rift, pattern recognition, Paul Erdős, peak TV, Plato's cave, profit motive, Project Xanadu, quantum cryptography, Ray Kurzweil, reality distortion field, recommendation engine, Richard Feynman, Richard Stallman, Ronald Reagan, self-driving car, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley startup, Skinner box, Skype, Snapchat, stem cell, Stephen Hawking, Steve Bannon, Steve Jobs, Steven Levy, Stewart Brand, systems thinking, technoutopianism, Ted Nelson, telemarketer, telepresence, telepresence robot, Thorstein Veblen, Turing test, Vernor Vinge, Whole Earth Catalog, Whole Earth Review, WikiLeaks, wikimedia commons\n\nBurrowing in the back reaches of the library recalled my explorations of the shelf of books and records at my little school in Juárez so long ago. I wondered if I might find a new treat on a par with The Garden of Earthly Delights. Prize It was camouflaged, hidden in the most boring possible academic journal. I had finally stumbled upon Ivan Sutherland’s amazing work. These days, I am sometimes called the father of VR. My usual retort is that it depends on whether you believe the mother of VR. VR was actually birthed by a long parade of scientists and entrepreneurs. Ivan had started up the whole field of computer graphics with his 1963 PhD thesis, which was called Sketchpad.\n\n…\n\nIn cases like that, there is a discrete moment when an operator enters input data into the computer, such as an encrypted enemy message, and then runs the program, and then reads the output. Indeed, the formal definitions of computation from Turing and von Neumann were first expressed around this model of discrete input, processing, and output stages. But what if computers were running all the time, interacting with the world, embedded in the world? This is exactly what Ivan Sutherland had prototyped! “Cyber” comes from the Greek and is related to navigation. When you sail, you must constantly adjust to changes in wind and surf. In the same way, a computer would have sensors to measure the world and actuators to affect the world. A computer embedded in the world would be a little like a robotic sailor even if it was fixed in place.\n\n…\n\nMy first job interview was actually all the way up in pretty Marin County, over the Golden Gate Bridge. George Lucas was starting an organization to create digital effects for movies but also for video and audio editing, with ambitions to get into video games. You might think I was interested because of Star Wars, but no, it was because a student of my hero Ivan Sutherland, a fellow named Ed Catmull, had started these digital efforts. I entered a big, unmarked industrial building and was greeted by a giant painting of the Organ Mountains, the pinnacles I stared at so often as a child in New Mexico. How could this be? Turned out that one of the other prime digital gurus at the place was Alvy Ray Smith, another migrant from our corner of the desert.\n\nIntertwingled: The Work and Influence of Ted Nelson (History of Computing) by Douglas R. Dechow\n\n3D printing, Apple II, Bill Duvall, Brewster Kahle, Buckminster Fuller, Claude Shannon: information theory, cognitive dissonance, computer age, Computer Lib, conceptual framework, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, Dynabook, Edward Snowden, game design, HyperCard, hypertext link, Ian Bogost, information retrieval, Internet Archive, Ivan Sutherland, Jaron Lanier, knowledge worker, linked data, Marc Andreessen, Marshall McLuhan, Menlo Park, Mother of all demos, pre–internet, Project Xanadu, RAND corporation, semantic web, Silicon Valley, software studies, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Stewart Brand, Ted Nelson, TED Talk, The Home Computer Revolution, the medium is the message, Vannevar Bush, Wall-E, Whole Earth Catalog\n\nThat setup would have cost over two million dollars back then, and it wouldn’t have had a screen. Nelson believes he saw a screen in a manual at one point – as he told me in an email a couple of weeks ago, “I remember it very clearly. A round CRT and a flat desk surface, a light pen” (Nelson 2014, pers. comm.). This was apparently not Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad, which was built in 1963, and Nelson has been unable to find the image again in the IBM 7090 manual). In Possiplex, he writes:A few words, a few pictures of people at computer screens, and the understanding that computer prices would fall—these gave me all I needed to know, a crystal seed from which to conjure a whole universe [10, p. 100].\n\n…\n\nHe writes in Literary Machines that in 1967 “the idea of communicating between such consoles was beginning to get through to me, and the nagging issue of shared access began to grow on me” [9, p. 1/31]. It may have been growing on Nelson in 1967, but as I’ve said, the computing world really wasn’t about to swallow the idea of a global hypertext publishing system. Work had not even started on the ARPANET (though Ivan Sutherland and Bob Taylor had been thinking about it for some time). The computing establishment was still trying to grapple with the concept of a person sitting in front of a screen and exploring information in real-time after Doug’s mother of all demos in 1968. That demo took years—over 20 years—to filter through properly.\n\n…\n\nAn example that moved me as a boy was Wright’s legendary house, Fallingwater. In high school I was similarly moved by several electronic designs: heterodyning, the Theremin, and the Hammond Organ. In the computer field, I was greatly inspired by several different pieces of software and hardware: the APL computer programming language; the PDP-8 computer; Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad; Ken Knowlton’s L6 language; Nassi-Shneiderman diagrams; and Sinden’s film, Force, Mass and Motion. Their designers had all found simple constructs that generated all the results they wanted. This was a clear lesson for the design of software—finding the cleanest and most powerful constructs.\n\nHoward Rheingold by The Virtual Community Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier-Perseus Books (1993)\n\n\"hyperreality Baudrillard\"~20 OR \"Baudrillard hyperreality\", Alvin Toffler, Apple II, bread and circuses, Brewster Kahle, Buckminster Fuller, commoditize, conceptual framework, disinformation, Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life?, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, experimental subject, General Magic , George Gilder, global village, Gregor Mendel, Hacker Ethic, Haight Ashbury, Howard Rheingold, HyperCard, intentional community, Ivan Sutherland, John Gilmore, John Markoff, Kevin Kelly, knowledge worker, license plate recognition, loose coupling, Marshall McLuhan, megaproject, Menlo Park, meta-analysis, Mitch Kapor, Morris worm, multilevel marketing, packet switching, Panopticon Jeremy Bentham, profit motive, RAND corporation, Ray Oldenburg, rent control, RFC: Request For Comment, Ronald Reagan, Saturday Night Live, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Levy, Stewart Brand, technoutopianism, Ted Nelson, telepresence, The Great Good Place, The Hackers Conference, the strength of weak ties, urban decay, UUNET, Whole Earth Catalog, Whole Earth Review, young professional\n\nLicklider knew there was a whole subculture of unorthodox programming geniuses clustered at the new Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at MIT and graphics geniuses like Ivan Sutherland at Lincoln. There were others around the country, chafing to get their hands on the kind of computing resources that didn't exist in the punched card and mainframe era. They wanted to reinvent computing; the computer industry giants and the mainstream of computer science weren't interested in reinventing computing. So Licklider and his successors at ARPA, Robert Taylor and Ivan Sutherland (both in their twenties), started funding the young hackers--the original hackers, as chronicled in Steven Levy's book Hackers, not the ones who break into computer systems today.\n\n…\n\n\"I guess you could say I had a religious conversion,\" he said. 26-04-2012 21:43 howard rheingold's | the virtual community 8 de 43 http://www.rheingold.com/vc/book/3.html Licklider became involved himself with computer display technology at Lincoln Laboratory, an MIT facility that did top-secret work for the Department of Defense. The new computers and displays that the North American Defense Command required in the early 1960s needed work on the design of information displays. Out of that work, one of Licklider's junior researchers, a graduate student named Ivan Sutherland, created the field of computer graphics. Through Lincoln Laboratory, Licklider met the people who later hired him at ARPA. In October 1957, when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the people who were responsible for maintaining the state of the art in U.S. military technology were shocked into action.\n\n…\n\nThe earliest users of CMC systems also were the people who built the first CMC systems; as users as well as designers of this thinking tool, they were reluctant to build in features that took power away from individual users, so they designed a degree of user autonomy into the system that persists in the architecture of cyberspace today. At Lincoln Lab and the University of Utah, where Ivan Sutherland and a younger generation of crusaders such as Alan Kay ended up, interactive computer graphics was the quest. The jump from alphabetic printout to graphic screen display was a major leap in the evolution of the way computers are designed to be operated by people, the \"human-computer interface.\"\n\nWhat the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry by John Markoff\n\nAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, Apple II, back-to-the-land, beat the dealer, Bill Duvall, Bill Gates: Altair 8800, Buckminster Fuller, California gold rush, card file, computer age, Computer Lib, computer vision, conceptual framework, cuban missile crisis, different worldview, digital divide, Donald Knuth, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, Dynabook, Edward Thorp, El Camino Real, Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, Fairchild Semiconductor, General Magic , general-purpose programming language, Golden Gate Park, Hacker Ethic, Hans Moravec, hypertext link, informal economy, information retrieval, invention of the printing press, Ivan Sutherland, Jeff Rulifson, John Markoff, John Nash: game theory, John von Neumann, Kevin Kelly, knowledge worker, Lewis Mumford, Mahatma Gandhi, Menlo Park, military-industrial complex, Mother of all demos, Norbert Wiener, packet switching, Paul Terrell, popular electronics, punch-card reader, QWERTY keyboard, RAND corporation, RFC: Request For Comment, Richard Stallman, Robert X Cringely, Sand Hill Road, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley startup, South of Market, San Francisco, speech recognition, Steve Crocker, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Levy, Stewart Brand, technological determinism, Ted Nelson, The Hackers Conference, The Theory of the Leisure Class by Thorstein Veblen, Thorstein Veblen, Turing test, union organizing, Vannevar Bush, We are as Gods, Whole Earth Catalog, William Shockley: the traitorous eight\n\nOf all the issues facing the researchers who were trying to build a man-machine interface at the time—keyboards and commands and everything else—pointing at something on the screen was one of the most difficult. People had pointed at blips on a radar screen in the SAGE early-warning system using light guns, Ivan Sutherland had designed a remarkable graphics program that worked with a light pen, but a pointing device that would let the computer user easily specify where he wanted to do something on the screen had rarely been used with text before.14 When he returned to SRI, Engelbart gave English a copy of the sketch.\n\n…\n\nHe didn’t worry about the remarkably high expense of the systems he was developing because he knew that by the time they were really mastered, prices would have plunged.19 However, in the boom and bust research world that relied on military and NASA contracting dollars, Engelbart’s research projects were invariably at risk, often at the mercy of visionary backers like Taylor and Licklider. The Augment experiment went through a shaky review with NASA in 1967, and the entire project was in danger of losing its funding until Bob Taylor came to Engelbart’s aid again. Taylor had replaced Ivan Sutherland as director of the ARPA Information Processing Technology Office in 1966 and soon discovered that Engelbart’s project was having financial problems. During this period, Engelbart was barnstorming the country with a film that showed some of the possibilities of editing on a computer screen instead of on paper-based typewriter terminals.\n\n…\n\nMcCarthy had meanwhile become interested in some vexing issues in computer vision that would need to be solved if robots were to recognize and manipulate blocks successfully. In 1964, he had applied for a larger grant, which he received, and he even had the audacity to ask ARPA to allow him to hire an executive officer. By that time, Ivan Sutherland, the designer of the brilliant Sketchpad drawing system, had succeeded Licklider. He told McCarthy he thought the notion of an executive officer was a great idea. “You’re the only one of our investigators with a perfect record,” Sutherland said. “You have never turned in a quarterly progress report.”9 Sutherland had quickly realized that McCarthy had little interest in the management side of the SAIL project.\n\nWhere Wizards Stay Up Late: The Origins of the Internet by Katie Hafner, Matthew Lyon\n\nair freight, Bill Duvall, Charles Babbage, Compatible Time-Sharing System, computer age, conceptual framework, Donald Davies, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, fault tolerance, Hush-A-Phone, information retrieval, Ivan Sutherland, John Markoff, Kevin Kelly, Leonard Kleinrock, Marc Andreessen, Menlo Park, military-industrial complex, Multics, natural language processing, OSI model, packet switching, RAND corporation, RFC: Request For Comment, Robert Metcalfe, Ronald Reagan, seminal paper, Silicon Valley, Skinner box, speech recognition, Steve Crocker, Steven Levy, The Soul of a New Machine\n\nBut by the time he left in 1964, he had succeeded in shifting the agency’s emphasis in computing R&D from a command systems laboratory playing out war-game scenarios to advanced research in time-sharing systems, computer graphics, and improved computer languages. The name of the office, Command and Control Research, had changed to reflect that shift, becoming the Information Processing Techniques Office. Licklider chose his successor, a colleague named Ivan Sutherland, the world’s leading expert in computer graphics. In 1965 Sutherland hired a young hotshot named Bob Taylor, who would soon sit down in ARPA’s terminal room and wonder why, with so many computers, they were unable to communicate with one another. Taylor’s Idea Bob Taylor had started college in Dallas at the age of sixteen thinking he would follow his father’s footsteps and become a minister.\n\n…\n\nBut this small avant-garde of researchers concentrated at MIT and around Boston had begun working on making the computer an amplifier of human potential, an extension of the mind and body. Taylor was known for having a good bit of intuition himself. He was considered a farsighted program officer who had a knack for picking innovative winners—both projects and researchers. He joined ARPA in early 1965, following Licklider’s departure, to work as deputy to Ivan Sutherland, IPTO’s second director. Months later, in 1966, at the age of thirty-four, Taylor became the third director of IPTO, inheriting responsibility for the community and much of the vision—indeed the very office—established by Licklider. The only difference, which turned out to be crucial, was that ARPA—now headed by Charles Herzfeld, an Austrian physicist who had fled Europe during the war—was even faster and looser with its money than it had been during Ruina’s tenure.\n\n…\n\nAt each of the other sites, ARPA-sponsored research that would provide valuable resources to the network was already under way. Researchers at UCSB were working on interactive graphics. Utah researchers were also doing a lot of graphics work as well as investigating night vision for the military. Dave Evans, who, with Ivan Sutherland, later started Evans and Sutherland, a pioneering graphics company, was at Utah putting together a system that would take images and manipulate them with a computer. Evans and his group were also interested in whether the network could be used for more than just textual exchanges. Stanford Research Institute (later it severed its ties to Stanford and became just SRI) had been chosen as one of the first sites because Doug Engelbart, a scientist of extraordinary vision, worked there.\n\nComputer: A History of the Information Machine by Martin Campbell-Kelly, William Aspray, Nathan L.

Almost all the ideas in the modern computer interface emanated from two of the laboratories funded by ARPA’s Information Processing Techniques Office in the 1960s: a small human-factors research group at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and David Evans’s and Ivan Sutherland’s much larger graphics research group at the University of Utah. The Human Factors Research Center was founded at the SRI in 1963 under the leadership of Doug Engelbart, later regarded as the doyen of human-computer interaction. Since the mid-1950s, Engelbart had been struggling to get funding to develop a computer system that would act like a personal-information storage and retrieval machine—in effect replacing physical documents by electronic ones and enabling the use of advanced computer techniques for filing, searching, and communicating documents.\n\n…\n\nIt was a stunning presentation, and although the system was too expensive to be practical, “it made a profound impression on many of the people” who later developed the first commercial graphical user interface at the Xerox Corporation. The second key actors in the early GUI movement came from the University of Utah’s Computer Science Laboratory where, under the leadership of David Evans and Ivan Sutherland, many fundamental innovations were made in computer graphics. The Utah environment supported a graduate student named Alan Kay, who pursued a blue-sky research project that in 1969 would result in a highly influential computer science PhD thesis. Kay’s research was focused on a device, which he then called the Reactive Engine but later called the Dynabook, that would fulfill the personal-information needs of an individual.\n\n…\n\nArpanet would behave rather like a power grid in which lots of power plants worked in harmony to balance the load. In July 1964, when Licklider finished his two-year tenure as head of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), he had a powerful say in the appointment of his successors, who shared his vision and carried it forward. His immediate successor was Ivan Sutherland, an MIT-trained graphics expert, then at the University of Utah, who held the office for two years. He was followed by Robert Taylor, another MIT alumnus, who later became head of the Xerox PARC computer science program. Between 1963 and 1966 ARPA funded a number of small-scale research projects to explore the emerging technology of computer networking.\n\nExperience on Demand: What Virtual Reality Is, How It Works, and What It Can Do by Jeremy Bailenson\n\nApollo 11, Apple II, augmented reality, computer vision, deliberate practice, experimental subject, fake news, game design, Google Glasses, income inequality, Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), iterative process, Ivan Sutherland, Jaron Lanier, low earth orbit, Mark Zuckerberg, Marshall McLuhan, meta-analysis, Milgram experiment, Neal Stephenson, nuclear winter, ocean acidification, Oculus Rift, opioid epidemic / opioid crisis, overview effect, pill mill, randomized controlled trial, Silicon Valley, SimCity, Skinner box, Skype, Snapchat, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Pinker, TED Talk, telepresence, too big to fail, traumatic brain injury\n\nIn my last book, Infinite Reality, we had a chapter on VR Applications, and we didn’t even touch on the subject. I can’t speak for my esteemed coauthor Jim Blascovich, but it never would have occurred to me to have a chapter about movies or news pieces. When we think of the pioneers of VR from decades ago—Jaron Lanier, Ivan Sutherland, Tom Furness—nobody was talking about storytelling, or at least not as a centerpiece of their vision. It just didn’t seem like an obvious use case, likely because of the constraints we mention above. But the film and news industry are betting, heavily, that this medium is their future. I am skeptical about a lot of it.\n\n…\n\nWithout my having to pay any attention to my actions, let alone to type commands on a keyboard, my computer could change my gestures and other behaviors to imitate each student’s gestures and behavior. In effect, I can psychologically reduce the size of the class. Historically, one of the most successful uses of virtual reality has been to visualize factors that are impossible to see in the real world. Ivan Sutherland, in his landmark 1965 paper, “The Ultimate Display,” makes an early case for this use of VR. Sutherland points out that each of us, in our lifelong experience of the physical world, develops a set of expectations about its properties. From our senses and experience we can make predictions about how physical objects will behave with gravity, or react to each other, or appear from different perspectives.\n\nCreativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration by Ed Catmull, Amy Wallace\n\nAlbert Einstein, business climate, buy low sell high, complexity theory, fail fast, fear of failure, Golden Gate Park, iterative process, Ivan Sutherland, Johannes Kepler, Menlo Park, reality distortion field, rolodex, Rubik’s Cube, Sand Hill Road, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley startup, Steve Jobs, Wall-E\n\nFour years later, in 1969, I graduated from the University of Utah with two degrees, one in physics and the other in the emerging field of computer science. Applying to graduate school, my intention was to learn how to design computer languages. But soon after I matriculated, also at the U of U, I met a man who would encourage me to change course: one of the pioneers of interactive computer graphics, Ivan Sutherland. The field of computer graphics—in essence, the making of digital pictures out of numbers, or data, that can be manipulated by a machine—was in its infancy then, but Professor Sutherland was already a legend. Early in his career, he had devised something called Sketchpad, an ingenious computer program that allowed figures to be drawn, copied, moved, rotated, or resized, all while retaining their basic properties.\n\n…\n\nIf Pixar had never existed, they would never have been born. You can turn back the clock a bit more and say that those babies’ parents might never have met if John didn’t join the production of The Adventures of André and Wally B. or if Walt Disney had never existed or if I hadn’t been lucky enough to study under Ivan Sutherland at the University of Utah. Or turn back to 1957, when I was twelve years old, returning from vacation in Yellowstone Park with my family. My dad was driving our yellow Ford ’57 station wagon, my mom was in the passenger seat and my brothers and sisters and I were piled into the back. We were traveling up a winding canyon road with a steep cliff immediately to our right and no guardrail.\n\nSmart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution by Howard Rheingold\n\n\"hyperreality Baudrillard\"~20 OR \"Baudrillard hyperreality\", A Pattern Language, Alvin Toffler, AOL-Time Warner, augmented reality, barriers to entry, battle of ideas, Brewster Kahle, Burning Man, business climate, citizen journalism, computer vision, conceptual framework, creative destruction, Dennis Ritchie, digital divide, disinformation, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, experimental economics, experimental subject, Extropian, Free Software Foundation, Garrett Hardin, Hacker Ethic, Hedy Lamarr / George Antheil, Herman Kahn, history of Unix, hockey-stick growth, Howard Rheingold, invention of the telephone, inventory management, Ivan Sutherland, John Markoff, John von Neumann, Joi Ito, Joseph Schumpeter, Ken Thompson, Kevin Kelly, Lewis Mumford, Metcalfe's law, Metcalfe’s law, more computing power than Apollo, move 37, Multics, New Urbanism, Norbert Wiener, packet switching, PalmPilot, Panopticon Jeremy Bentham, pattern recognition, peer-to-peer, peer-to-peer model, pez dispenser, planetary scale, pre–internet, prisoner's dilemma, radical decentralization, RAND corporation, recommendation engine, Renaissance Technologies, RFID, Richard Stallman, Robert Metcalfe, Robert X Cringely, Ronald Coase, Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, seminal paper, SETI@home, sharing economy, Silicon Valley, skunkworks, slashdot, social intelligence, spectrum auction, Steven Levy, Stewart Brand, the Cathedral and the Bazaar, the scientific method, Tragedy of the Commons, transaction costs, ultimatum game, urban planning, web of trust, Whole Earth Review, Yochai Benkler, zero-sum game\n\n., visual, audio, and haptic interfaces to environments such as rooms, cars, and office desks) and Smart Clothes (i.e., wearable computers that sense and adapt to the user and their environment). We are using these perceptually-aware devices to explore applications in health care, entertainment, and collaborative work.16 “Bits and atoms” is a major theme at MIT’s Media Lab. Ivan Sutherland started it in 1965 with his dramatic statement that “the ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such room would be fatal.”17 While others at Media Lab work in the “Things That Think” or “Tangible Bits” programs—ways to create Sutherland’s chair, if not the hypothetical bullet—Pentland and his colleagues built the first smart room in 1991.18 Cooltown and Other Informated Places On a warm October day in 2001, I drove to the end of a country road.\n\n…\n\nFor example, imagine being able to enter an airport and see a virtual red carpet leading you right to your gate, look at the ground and see property lines or underground buried cables, walk along a nature trail and see virtual signs near plants and rocks.21 Spohrer raised the bar for technical difficulty by wanting to see the information in its context, overlaid on the real world. WorldBoard, Spohrer noted, combined, and extended the ideas of Ivan Sutherland, Warren Robinett, and Steven Feiner. Sutherland had invented computer-generated graphics in his MIT Ph.D. thesis in 1963.22 Computer graphics came a long way in forty years, from Sutherland’s first stick figure displays to today’s computer-generated feature films. Another prototype that Sutherland developed in the 1960s, the “head-mounted display,” took a less dramatic development path.23 Sutherland realized that synchronized computer displays, presented optically to each eye, yoked to a device for tracking the user’s location and position, could create a three-dimensional computer graphic either as an artificial world or as an overlay on the natural world.\n\nLoonshots: How to Nurture the Crazy Ideas That Win Wars, Cure Diseases, and Transform Industries by Safi Bahcall\n\naccounting loophole / creative accounting, Alan Greenspan, Albert Einstein, AOL-Time Warner, Apollo 11, Apollo 13, Apple II, Apple's 1984 Super Bowl advert, Astronomia nova, behavioural economics, Boeing 747, British Empire, Cass Sunstein, Charles Lindbergh, Clayton Christensen, cognitive bias, creative destruction, disruptive innovation, diversified portfolio, double helix, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, Dunbar number, Edmond Halley, Gary Taubes, Higgs boson, hypertext link, industrial research laboratory, invisible hand, Isaac Newton, Ivan Sutherland, Johannes Kepler, Jony Ive, knowledge economy, lone genius, Louis Pasteur, Mark Zuckerberg, Menlo Park, Mother of all demos, Murray Gell-Mann, PageRank, Peter Thiel, Philip Mirowski, Pierre-Simon Laplace, power law, prediction markets, pre–internet, Ralph Waldo Emerson, RAND corporation, random walk, reality distortion field, Richard Feynman, Richard Thaler, Sheryl Sandberg, side project, Silicon Valley, six sigma, stem cell, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, synthetic biology, the scientific method, The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith, The Wisdom of Crowds, Tim Cook: Apple, tulip mania, Wall-E, wikimedia commons, yield management\n\nIn the 1970s, a mob of young computer graphics pioneers flashed on the campus of the University of Utah: Jim Clark, who would go on to create Silicon Graphics; Nolan Bushnell, who would start Atari; John Warnock, who would create Adobe; and Alan Kay, who would help create the first graphics-enabled personal computer, the Alto, at Xerox. Joining them was Catmull, a mild-mannered Mormon graduate student who would cofound the greatest animated film company of his time. At Utah, Catmull created the 3D hand for a class project. He and his thesis advisor, a graphics pioneer named Ivan Sutherland, took it to Disney. Walt Disney had been a boyhood idol for Catmull, who had dreamed of becoming a Disney animator. Catmull approached the animation building like visiting a shrine. Disney, however, passed on his technology. And there would be no animation job offer for Catmull. Over the next decade, Disney, an empire built on animation, would dismiss a remarkable string of animation technologies invented by the Utah graphics alumni; just as Xerox, an empire built on office productivity, would dismiss a remarkable stream of loonshots that transformed office productivity, invented by its subsidiary Xerox PARC.\n\n…\n\nAs an offshoot, the seismology project revived, and subsequently validated, the theory of plate tectonics. That theory permanently changed geology. DARPA funded the creation of the first major computer graphics center. It chose the University of Utah. The group at Utah, described in chapter 5, was co-led by a former DARPA program manager, Ivan Sutherland. Sutherland supervised the computer graphics PhD thesis of Ed Catmull, the Pixar founder, who has said he was “profoundly influenced” by the DARPA model of nurturing creativity. DARPA funded another engineer, named Douglas Engelbart, who built the first computer mouse, the first bitmapped screens (early graphical interfaces), the first hypertext links, and demonstrated them in 1968 at what computer scientists now refer to as the “Mother of All Demos.”\n\nThe History of the Future: Oculus, Facebook, and the Revolution That Swept Virtual Reality by Blake J.

Heilig named his invention the Sensorama and shot, produced, and edited five films that it could play.3 In 1965, Ivan Sutherland, an associate professor of electrical engineering at Harvard, wrote a paper titled “The Ultimate Display.”4 In it, Sutherland explicated the possibility of using computer hardware to create a virtual world—rendered in real time—in which users could interact with objects in a realistic way. “With appropriate programming,” Sutherland explained, “such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.”\n\n…\n\nBut after assessing the HMDs currently on the market, Carmack wasn’t just disappointed by what was out there, he was flat out offended. In fact, with some of the headsets, the latency—meaning the lag between when someone tries to complete an action on-screen (like, say, firing a weapon) and when that action actually occurs—was actually a step back from the systems Ivan Sutherland built back in the ’60s! Granted, those Sutherland systems were ultra-expensive with low-latency CRT displays . . . but still! How could this be? Had VR really flamed out so badly in the ’90s that touching the technology was still perceived as toxic? As of late 2011, the most popular HMD was probably eMagin’s Z800 3-D visor, which cost about $900.\n\nTroublemakers: Silicon Valley's Coming of Age by Leslie Berlin\n\nAltaVista, Apple II, Arthur D.

Taylor joined ARPA’s Information Processing Techniques Office in 1965 as assistant director to Licklider’s successor, Ivan Sutherland, another leading proponent of interactive computing. Taylor and Sutherland worked closely together—they were the only people in the office, aside from a secretary—and Taylor enjoyed traveling to the many campuses where ARPA had funded the development of new computer science programs. Before 1960, there were no computer science departments.\n\n…\n\nHe was the only head of the Information Processing Techniques Office not to hold a doctorate and the only one to have taken the job without a significant record of contributions to the field. Taylor nonetheless says that for the entire time he was at ARPA, he had no sense of inferiority, even though he knew that he had not been the top choice to succeed Ivan Sutherland as director of the office.16 “There was not a one of them who I thought was smarter than me,” he says. (“I thought Lick was smarter than me,” he adds.) Taylor had graduated from high school at sixteen, had an IQ so high (154) it was written up in his small-town newspaper when he was a child, and finished college with a double major in psychology and math, as well as substantial course work in religion, English, and philosophy.17 He did not possess the principal investigators’ depth of computer science knowledge, but the breadth of Taylor’s mind was wide and his chutzpah, limitless.\n\nTotal Recall: How the E-Memory Revolution Will Change Everything by Gordon Bell, Jim Gemmell\n\nairport security, Albert Einstein, book scanning, cloud computing, Computing Machinery and Intelligence, conceptual framework, Douglas Engelbart, full text search, information retrieval, invention of writing, inventory management, Isaac Newton, Ivan Sutherland, John Markoff, language acquisition, lifelogging, Menlo Park, optical character recognition, pattern recognition, performance metric, RAND corporation, RFID, semantic web, Silicon Valley, Skype, social web, statistical model, Stephen Hawking, Steve Ballmer, Steve Bannon, Ted Nelson, telepresence, Turing test, Vannevar Bush, web application\n\nBefore we get to the effects Total Recall can have on work, health, learning, and our personal relationships, we need to take a deeper look at what science can tell us about the meeting of e-memory and bio-memory, that stuff that resides in our heads.

I can get up and tell them I run into Ivan about every five years, and we enjoy our conversations. Honestly, that was all that came to me. Then I entered Ivan’s name into the search window in MyLifeBits, and to my surprise and relief, I immediately recalled emotionally evocative and intellectually intriguing details I had completely forgotten.\n\nPaper Knowledge: Toward a Media History of Documents by Lisa Gitelman\n\nAlvin Toffler, An Inconvenient Truth, Andrew Keen, Charles Babbage, computer age, corporate governance, Dennis Ritchie, deskilling, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, East Village, en.wikipedia.org, information retrieval, Internet Archive, invention of movable type, Ivan Sutherland, Jaron Lanier, Ken Thompson, knowledge economy, Lewis Mumford, machine translation, Marshall McLuhan, Mikhail Gorbachev, military-industrial complex, national security letter, Neal Stephenson, On the Economy of Machinery and Manufactures, optical character recognition, profit motive, QR code, RAND corporation, RFC: Request For Comment, scientific management, Shoshana Zuboff, Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs, tacit knowledge, technological determinism, The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere, Turing test, WikiLeaks, Works Progress Administration\n\nIn contrast, Intrex and the Times Information Bank put a premium on documents, not just information, appropriating the logic of microform (and the logic of direct quotation) and delivering it to the electronic screen. Almost a decade before systems like these paired reference metadata and microfiche images on the same screen, another effort had arrived at screen-­based pages by an entirely different route. Instead of reference retrieval, Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad (created in 1963) aimed at what he called “man-­machine graphical communication.”27 A doctoral project created at mit , Sketchpad has been described as “the most important ancestor of today’s Computer Aided Design (cad )” as well as a key breakthrough in the history of computer graphics and the first—or at least an early—step on the path to object-­oriented programming and the graphical user interface.28 It ran on the tx -­2 computer with an oscilloscope cathode ray tube (crt ) display, and users interacted with graphics on the screen by means of a light pen, which they pointed at the screen while manipulating a set of buttons and switches on a keyboard and knobs on the monitor.\n\nThe Friendly Orange Glow: The Untold Story of the PLATO System and the Dawn of Cyberculture by Brian Dear\n\nair traffic controllers' union, AltaVista, Alvin Toffler, Apple II, Apple Newton, Buckminster Fuller, Charles Babbage, cloud computing, complexity theory, computer age, Computer Lib, conceptual framework, corporate social responsibility, disruptive innovation, Douglas Engelbart, Douglas Engelbart, Dynabook, Elon Musk, en.wikipedia.org, Fairchild Semiconductor, finite state, Future Shock, game design, Hacker News, Howard Rheingold, Ivan Sutherland, John Markoff, lateral thinking, linear programming, machine readable, Marc Andreessen, Marshall McLuhan, Menlo Park, Metcalfe’s law, Mitch Kapor, Mother of all demos, natural language processing, Neal Stephenson, Palm Treo, Plato's cave, pre–internet, publish or perish, Ralph Nader, Robert Metcalfe, Ronald Reagan, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley startup, Skinner box, Skype, software is eating the world, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Steven Levy, Stewart Brand, Ted Nelson, the medium is the message, The Soul of a New Machine, three-martini lunch, Watson beat the top human players on Jeopardy!, Whole Earth Catalog\n\nKay would later describe FLEX as “a small tabletop computer, and it didn’t have a very good user interface on it, and only after we had done a lot of it did we realize the user interface was really the critical part. We already had the idea that somehow the novice programmer should be able to program on it and it had an object-oriented language on the first one that I designed but not terribly well-integrated into the user interface.” Kay was influenced by the work of Ivan Sutherland, also at the University of Utah, who was a pioneer in computer graphics, as well as Douglas Engelbart, who had long ago abandoned his plasma storage device research to embark on research into user interfaces and online software for “human augmentation,” resulting in, among other things, the invention of the mouse.\n\n…\n\n“He mentioned one or two others who were also well regarded and had made their way in the computer community. And since I knew Dan from my Westinghouse days—I had worked at Westinghouse, as my first job in research was at Westinghouse. And Dan was one of the very well-respected Westinghouse fellows.” One of the other names Sproull mentioned was Ivan Sutherland, the wizard of interactive computer graphics. Goldman himself had come up with the idea of Pake, someone else he knew, because, it turns out, Goldman, Pake, and Alpert had all worked at Westinghouse at the same time, years earlier, when they were all still climbing up the ladder of their careers.\n\nThe New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story by Michael Lewis\n\nAlan Greenspan, Albert Einstein, Andy Kessler, Benchmark Capital, business climate, classic study, creative destruction, data acquisition, Fairchild Semiconductor, family office, high net worth, invention of the steam engine, invisible hand, Ivan Sutherland, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, Marc Andreessen, Mary Meeker, Menlo Park, PalmPilot, pre–internet, risk tolerance, Sand Hill Road, Silicon Valley, Silicon Valley startup, tech worker, the new new thing, Thorstein Veblen, wealth creators, Y2K\n\nThere were hints that between 1970 and 1978 Clark had married at least twice, sired at least two children, moved back and forth across the country at least three times, and held at least four different jobs, mainly at universities.

In 1978 he was fired for insubordination from a post at the New York Institute of Technology, at which point a wife, not his first, left him. \"I remember her saying that she couldn't live the way I lived anymore,\" he recalled when asked. \"She just wanted a more settled life.\" When he said this, he was standing outside of his house, near his hill.\n\nThe Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge by Vernor Vinge\n\nanthropic principle, Asilomar, back-to-the-land, dematerialisation, gravity well, invisible hand, Ivan Sutherland, low earth orbit, Machinery of Freedom by David Friedman, MITM: man-in-the-middle, source of truth, technological singularity, unbiased observer, Vernor Vinge\n\nIn 1963, just out of high school, during my first visit to Disneyland, it occurred to me that computers could be used to automate cartoon creation, putting—I thought—large-scale dramatic productions within the reach of individual artists. (Most of this has come to pass, though our largest projects still involve enormous teams of bright people.) The idea of computer animation was probably an independent insight, though I know now that people like Ivan Sutherland were already hard at work with real implementations! Years would pass before computers would be powerful enough to do high-quality motion imagery. That I got right! And this illustrates a subtle deficiency in the vision of this story (well, it’s subtle compared to the other deficiencies!). For years before the first computer-animated short features, people were talking about the possibilities.\n\nMasterminds of Programming: Conversations With the Creators of Major Programming Languages by Federico Biancuzzi, Shane Warden\n\nBenevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL), business intelligence, business logic, business process, cellular automata, cloud computing, cognitive load, commoditize, complexity theory, conceptual framework, continuous integration, data acquisition, Dennis Ritchie, domain-specific language, Douglas Hofstadter, Fellow of the Royal Society, finite state, Firefox, follow your passion, Frank Gehry, functional programming, general-purpose programming language, Guido van Rossum, higher-order functions, history of Unix, HyperCard, industrial research laboratory, information retrieval, information security, iterative process, Ivan Sutherland, John von Neumann, Ken Thompson, Larry Ellison, Larry Wall, linear programming, loose coupling, machine readable, machine translation, Mars Rover, millennium bug, Multics, NP-complete, Paul Graham, performance metric, Perl 6, QWERTY keyboard, RAND corporation, randomized controlled trial, Renaissance Technologies, Ruby on Rails, Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, seminal paper, Silicon Valley, slashdot, software as a service, software patent, sorting algorithm, SQL injection, Steve Jobs, traveling salesman, Turing complete, type inference, Valgrind, Von Neumann architecture, web application\n\nMaybe this is a good way to state the main problem facing the computing field: most of its practitioners have no understanding of computing history and so, as Toynbee said about world history, they are condemned to repeat the same mistakes. Unlike scientists and engineers who build upon past discoveries, too many computing practitioners treat each system or language as a new thing, unaware that similar things have been done before. At the first OOPSLA conference in 1986, the highlight was a presentation of Ivan Sutherland’s Sketchpad system invented in 1963. It incorporated some of the first OO ideas long before OO was invented, and did them better than most OO systems do now. It looked fresh in 1986 and still does over 20 years later. So why do we still have many graphical tools that are inferior to Sketchpad today?"
