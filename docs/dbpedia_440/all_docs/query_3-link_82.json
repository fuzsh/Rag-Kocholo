        "text": "In 1901 the young German inventor and businessman Justin Wilhelm Bamberger (born 20 August 1879 in Würzburg) moved from Cologne to Munich, where in 1902 he registered a company for office equipment, under his name, and also started a small repair shop that dealt with used typewriters. Presumably, he also sold the “Locke-Adder”, which he imported from the USA, then he decided to design his own calculating and typewriting devices. Starting in 1903 he brought out four simple calculators and two typewriters, which he produced, although in small quantities, in his factory (Präzisions-Maschinenfabrik Justin Wilhelm Bamberger & Co.).\n\nThe Universal Adder of Bamberger (see the nearby photo) was similar to George Fowler‘s Adding Machine from 1863 and to Locke Adder from 1901. It was patented in Germany (D.R.G.M. 195509 of 8 April 1903). Like Locke Adder, the Universal Calculator does not carry tens, it is only used to set amounts. A tens carry must be calculated mentally and also set. The device has dimensions of 38,8 x 11,3 x 1,8 cm, a weight of 530 g, and was in production from 1903 to 1914, with an initial price of 15 Marks.\n\nIn 1905 Bamberger improved the Universal Adder and launched “Omega” (see the nearby photo), with an initial price of 38 Marks. The device has dimensions of 39,2 x 11,5 x 2 cm, and a weight of 730 g. The Omega calculator (see the Usage Instruction of Omega) has hod-shaped number slides with punctiform elevations that the finger can grip. The result is shown under round windows. To the right of the input field, there is a hole for each position, into which a comma pen can be inserted. On the right side of the device, there is a holder for a notepad. On the cover of the box is inscribed a multiplication table with sliding elements. In the right part of the box is a compartment with a lid for storage (pen, etc.) The device does not have tens carry.\n\nIn May 1906 Bamberger announced a new portable and cheaper version of Universal Adder called the “Dux” calculator, with a price of 4.5 Marks. In June 1906, he launched a rather different calculating device—Bamberger Ideal (see the nearby photo), with a price of 25 Marks.\n\nThe Ideal calculator of Bamberger is a concentric toothed-disc adding machine with dimensions 2 x 11 x 15 cm, and a weight of 240 g. During the setting of the device, one of the six concentrically arranged number disks is moved with the setting pin, whereby one of the six buttons underneath the setting disk (for the digits 1–100000) the respective dial is released from the blockage. The black (outer) numbers apply to addition and the red (inner) numbers apply to subtraction. The device has tens carry, i.e. if “9” is exceeded, the tens are carried over to the next higher number disc (via an internal “carrier” tooth). Above the row of buttons on the left is a reset button, which is pulled to the right to reset, releasing the locks on the six dials; when the setting pin is actuated, all six number discs snap into the “0” position one after the other. The machine, which is very pretty thanks to the two-tone materials, is decorated with floral arabesques and a border.\n\nBamberger was a holder of quite a few patents in Germany, France, Great Britain, the USA, Switzerland, and Denmark, mainly in the area of typewriters, but also for calculating devices, a fountain pen, a vacuum cleaner, etc.\n\nIn late 1909 Bamberger’s last company (D.K.W. “Deutsche Klein Maschinenwerke Justin Wm. Bamberger & Co”), which produced his typewriters Liliput and Helios, went bankrupt, so he left Munich and moved to Berlin, where he founded “Helios-Schreibmaschinen-Gesellschaft” to sell his patented typewriter Helios, now produced by another company. It seems Bamberger was a good engineer, but a poor businessman because Helios had also become an economic failure for him. The last available information for Bamberger is from the middle of 1912 when he was the managing director of the “Allgemeine Spezialmaschinengesellschaft” in Hamburg, which manufactured vacuum cleaning machines (he had patents in this area, e.g. GB191126843).\n\nYou don’t have conversations with microprocessors. You tell them what to do, then helplessly watch the disaster when they take you literally!\n\nDavid Brin\n\nIt was during the Thanksgiving holiday of 1969 when the engineer Victor Dale Poor (1933-2012) and his fellow amateur radio colleague Harry Starck Pyle (1949-2013) produced the underlying architecture of the modern microprocessor on a living room floor. Several months ago, Pyle, still a student, was hired for a computer-related summer job by his mentor Poor, who was the executive of Maryland-based radio and telegraph equipment manufacturer Frederick Electronics, where developed the idea of adapting radioteletype (RTTY) machines to send data wirelessly.\n\nAs Poor and Pyle came up with the idea of a high-density integrated circuit that would be programmable, they offered this circuit design to various IC manufacturers but were turned down by all of them. The reason? The chip was too specialized and would never have enough widespread applicability to be financially worth developing.\n\nHaving failed to convince any IC manufacturer, but still believing in the concept Poor and Pyle pressed on and went looking for manufacturers who would have an application for the new chip. They found such a firm Computer Terminal Corporation (CTC), which made a variety of lower-cost computer terminals which were compatible with various computer companies and was involved also in the development of the first microprocessors in another way. CTC was interested in the chip because it presented a way to make one terminal that could be programmed to behave like and handle the protocols of a variety of different computer manufacturers. CTC agreed to pay two different chip makers (Intel and Texas Instruments) to produce the chip. Both chip makers decided to use a new technology, called PMOS, to produce the chip.\n\nBoth chip makers have encountered new technology problems with PMOS and have failed to meet the CTC deadline. So the contracts are canceled and CTC builds the chip via discrete TTL logic and puts it into a programmable desktop terminal, called the Datapoint 2200. The original instruction set architecture was developed by Poor and Pyle. The TTL design they ended up using was made by Gary Asbell. Jonathan Schmidt wrote the accompanying communications software.\n\nDatapoint 2200 was unveiled at the beginning of 1970 and was launched to the market in June. It becomes an extremely successful product and was manufactured as long as until 1979. So much so, that CTC changes its name to Datapoint Corporation. They go on to invent another new technology to connect all of their low-cost computers together. While the initial Datapoint 2200 did not have a microprocessor in it, it had the programmable equivalent of an Intel 8008 (built by discrete TTL logic) and it funded the initial development of the first microprocessor.\n\nThe Datapoint 2200 was a box with size 9 5/8” in height, 18 1/2” wide, 19 5/8” deep, and weight 47 pounds. It had a small built-in 7” x 3,5” CRT screen, which was of green&black monochrome type, and worked in text mode 12 x 80. It had full stroke keyboard+numeric keypad with an integrated programmable beeper. The external data and program storage were two read-write cassette decks for 130KB of mass storage. The internal memory of the first models was from 2 KB to 16 KB max. There was a run light and two other lights on the keyboard. The I/O ports were—RS 232, LAN connector, and printer (parallel data) connector.\n\nThe operating system was Datapoint O/S (cassette/storage drum-based O/S). When the machine halted, you could not tell where in the program it had done so. So you put in the O/S cassette and rebooted. You then did a memory dump and tried to deduce what had gone wrong. Primitive by today’s standards, it was the first computer on a desktop.\n\nThere was also an optional disk drive using Shugart 8″ floppies, single-sided, single-density. It was the first commercial computer to include them! A number of peripherals can be connected also: printer, tape device, 2 MB removable cartridge disk, card reader, etc. (see the Reference Manual of Datapoint).\n\nLanguages included Databus and Datashare (“COBOL-like” business computer languages, interpreted to allow multiple 80 character by 24-row dumb CRTs to share tiny partitions of RAM memory in the main system unit), a Basic interpreter, and an RPG II compiler (see the Programmers Manual of Datapoint).\n\nThe Datapoint 2200 was a real computer and it fits on a desk, but it certainly wasn’t priced for hobbyists, as it was sold for about $5000.\n\nWe’re fascinated with robots because they are reflections of ourselves.\n\nKen Goldberg\n\nThe brilliant electrochemical expert from the University of Washington, Thomas Ross, certainly was not the first and only man, who can be credited for creating a thinking machine. In fact, Ross got his original inspiration from the works of Clark Leonard Hull (1884-1952), an influential American psychologist, who studied logic and engineering and sought to explain learning and motivation by scientific laws of behavior, and his followers Nicolas Rashevsky (1899-1972), Robert G. Krueger and Harry D. Baernstein. In a 1929 article by Hull and Baernstein can be read:\n\nIf it were possible to construct non-living devices, perhaps even of inorganic materials, which would perform the essential functions of the conditioned reflex, we should be able to organize these units into systems, which would show true trial-and-error learning with intelligent selection and the elimination of errors, as well as other behavior ordinarily classed as psychic… Learning and thought are here conceived as by no means necessarily a function of living protoplasm any more than is aerial locomotion…\n\nIn the same 1929, Baernstein created a device, which was intended to simulate several features of conditioned reflex training. It was demonstrated at a Psychological Conference in Urbana, Illinois, and attracted wide interest, and the press referred to it as the mysterious mechanical brain.\n\nAt some time at the beginning of the 1930s Thomas Neil Ross (10 Aug 1909-12 Jan 2010) of Hoquiam, Washington, a junior student at the University of Washington, started his work on automata, which can be considered the first practical attempt to make a machine that would imitate a living creature in performance. These machines seem to have been suggested by the familiar test of animal intelligence in finding the way out of a maze. By trial and error, his maze-solver could learn to find its way to a correct goal on a system of toy-train tracks.\n\nIn 1933 Ross built a mechanical arm powered by an electrical engine that explored five parallel paths in a kind of vertical maze, searching one after the other from the entrance to the exit. The goal was to point out a solution to the maze. Rather complicated electrical circuits constituting the memory cells of this primitive robot were responsible for its performance. This device, as well as other ideas of Ross, were described in the article The Machines that Think for Scientific American from April 1933 (see the article of Thomas Ross in the April 1933 issue of Scientific American).\n\nIn early 1935 Ross shared his ideas with one of his professors at the University of Washington, psychologist Stevenson Smith (1883-1950), who used them to construct a robot, the so-called Robot Rat. It was a three-wheeled vehicle about 31 cm long and 22 cm wide, announced in several newspapers, let’s see the Time newspaper, Monday, 16 September 1935:\n\nIn Seattle last week Dr. Stevenson Smith, University of Washington psychology professor, delighted colleagues and students by showing them a complicated “mechanical rat” which he and a helper had worked five years to perfect. Living rats, especially white ones, are favorites with animal psychologists who teach them to traverse complex mazes bristling with blind alleys, studying the effect on maze-learning of food, light, electric shock, drugs, blasts of air.\n\nThe Stevenson rat is impervious to all such lures and hindrances. Resembling a three-wheeled roller skate loaded with small motors, electromagnets and switches, the robot is set on a track containing twelve forks at each of which a wrong turn leads to a dead-end. The robot is first set to take the turn to the right at every fork. When this proves to be wrong and results in a bump against the dead-end, the “rat” goes into reverse, backs up past the fork, goes forward again, taking the correct left turn. This resets the controls in such a way as to enable the “rat” on the second try to negotiate the maze from start to finish without a single error.\n\n“This machine,” said its inventor, “remembers what it has learned far better than any man or animal. No living organism can be depended upon to make no errors of this type after one trial.”\n\nLet’s see the Ogden Standard Examiner newspaper of 1 September 1935:\n\nHUMANS TAKE BACK SEAT TO MACHINE RATS\n\nPsychology Professor Says Memory of New Devices Exceeds Mankind\n\nSEATTLE, Aug. 31—”Mechanical rat,” described by Dr. Stevenson Smith, University of Washington psychology professor, as “able to remember what it has learned far better than any man or animal can remember,” was demonstrated here today.\n\n“No living organism could be depended upon to make no mistakes after one practice,” Dr. Smith said.\n\n“That is what this ‘rat’ can do”.\n\nDr. Smith then demonstrated the device, a small foot-long mechanism powered by a small electric motor, on three wheels, which groped its way through a maze of wooden tracks, across a long recitation room.\n\nThe first time it “failed,” but by bumping a protruding piece of metal into a bumper at the end of the wrong track, it “learned that it shouldn’t try that switch again. Under its own power after hitting the bumper, it retreated back beyond the switch, and “found” the other track and then proceeded forward.\n\nThe second time it was started at the beginning of the 40-foot maze, it moved across the room, making no mistakes.\n\nDr. Smith gave most of the credit for its development to Thomas Ross of McClips, Wash., a junior student at the university.\n\nPsychologists over the country have been working on the problem trying to develop such a device, Dr. Smith said.\n\n“What is its practical value?” he was asked.\n\n“We hardly know or foresee just now what can be done with it,” he replied.\n\n“I think, however, in studying the problem of learning, it will be useful to teach students some things and I also think it may teach psychologists some, too.”\n\nRoss published a description of this robot in a 1937 article in the Psychological Review magazine:\n\nThis machine runs through a twelve-unit, multiple-Y maze in which the twelve sections are so arranged that each has one blocked branch and one branch that opens into the stem of the next section. placed at the beginning of this maze and set in motion by connection to an electrical supply, the machine will begin rolling through the maze on its three wheels. Being constructed with a tendency to turn to the right, it will, on coming to the forking of the first Y-section, run down the right-hand passage. If this passage is blocked (by a vertical wall at the end) the machine will back out of that passage and turn to the left upon again starting forward. Since the maze is so arranged that one passage in each section is open, the left-hand passage will now lead directly to the beginning of the next section of the maze, at which point the machine will receive a ‘cue’ that it has entered a new section as it brushes its two metal ‘feelers’ against a pair of blocks set on the sides of the passage.\n\n(…) On being again started through the maze, the machine will go from beginning to end without entering any of the blind passages which it entered on the first trip through, and every time after will repeat the performance without ‘error’.\n\nThe automatic learning feature of the Robot Rat was based on a rotating disk, the so-called Memory Disk, see the nearby image.\n\nThe Memory Disk worked in this manner:\n\nBefore the robot entered the maze, all 12 tabs on the disk were raised, but the mechanism was designed so that when the robot took the dead-end path to the right, one of the tabs went down and a circuit was activated that prevented the car from turning right again at that particular split in the path. The robot’s successful and unsuccessful “trials”, its turn to the right and then to the left, was registered on the disk in the form of a pattern of 12 depressed and raised tabs. As the robot passed all twelve “Y”-sections of the maze, the disk went through a complete rotation and arrived back at its starting position, but now the 12 tabs were in a pattern, that prevented the robot from turning right. In other words, the correct path was imprinted in the robot’s memory disk, and afterward, the robot never made errors when going through the maze.\n\nThe danger of the past was that men became slaves. The danger of the future is that men may become robots.\n\nErich Fromm\n\nThe first robots that were programmed to “think” the way biological brains do and meant to have free will were built in the late 1940s by William Grey Walter (1910–1977)—an American-born British neurophysiologist, and cybernetician, who wanted to prove that rich connections between a small number of brain cells could give rise to very complex behaviors, essentially that the secret of how the brain worked lay in how it was wired up. We don’t know if Walter knew the pioneering work of Thomas Ross and Stevenson Smith, but his first robots looked quite similar to the Robot Rat of Smith.\n\nThe first two robots of Walter, so-called Elmer and Elsie (short for ELectroMEchanical Robot, Light-Sensitive) were often labeled as tortoises because of how they were shaped and the slow rate at which they moved. They were capable of phototaxis which is the movement that occurs in response to light stimulus. Constructed between 1948 and 1949 using war surplus materials and old alarm clocks, they had a single light or touch sensor hooked up to two different paths that ran two different motors acting as two separate neuron brains. The robots had a plastic shell that was phototropic in that it could follow light and act as a bumper sensor. Interestingly, Walter stressed the importance of using purely analog electronics to simulate brain processes at a time when his famous contemporaries Alan Turing, John von Neumann, and Norbert Wiener were all turning towards a view of mental processes in terms of digital computation.\n\nThe tortoises were three-wheel machines (which Walter called Machina Speculatrix, because “it explores its environment actively, persistently, systematically as most animals do”), designed to show the interaction between both light-sensitive and touch-sensitive control mechanisms which were basically two nerve cells with visual and tactile inputs. These systems interacted with the motor drive in such a way that the tortoises were actually finding their way around obstacles. They were allowed to randomly wander around the floor in no specific pattern and when they were presented with two light sources equally distanced from their sensor, they’d head towards whichever light they saw as a consistent part of the scanning process.\n\nIn one experiment a light was placed on the nose of one of the tortoises. It appeared that the robot was looking at itself in a mirror. Its light began flickering and the robot started shaking as if excited to see itself in the mirror. Walter argued that if this behavior were seen in an animal it “might be accepted as evidence of some degree of self-awareness.”\n\nWhen presented with certain stimuli, even outside of their programmed range of experience, the robots responded consistently, as if they had a personality. Naturally, they had their quirks and odd behaviors the way living things do. Using only two neurons they exhibited much of the same behaviors and oddities that any biological beings have.\n\nAfter building the tortoises, Walter added additional capabilities naming his new robot, Machina Docilis. Based on the same physical design, this robot included a Conditioned Reflex Analogue (CORA) which demonstrated simple Pavlovian learning. The new robot had three sensors: a sound detector, a light detector, and a bump switch. The CORA circuitry could be trained to establish learned connections between the three sensors and the motor drive oscillators. This resulted in an ability to learn different behaviors which were initiated by sounds, light, or the bumpers. This kind of circuitry is structurally very similar to neural circuitry most recently identified in marine snails.\n\nIt’s very satisfying to take a problem we thought difficult and find a simple solution. The best solutions are always simple.\n\nIvan Sutherland\n\nIvan Sutherland is considered by many to be the creator of Computer Graphics and an Internet pioneer. Starting with his Ph.D. thesis, named Sketchpad, which is one of the most influential computer programs ever written by an individual, Sutherland has contributed numerous ideas to the study of Computer Graphics and Computer Interaction. He introduced concepts such as 3-D computer modeling, visual simulations, computer-aided design (CAD), and virtual reality, to name but a few.\n\nIvan Edward Sutherland was born in Hastings, Nebraska on 16 May 1938. He was immersed in learning since he was young. His father, a Ph.D. in Civil Engineering (born in New Zealand), as well as his mother, a teacher (born 1901 in Scotland), led Sutherland to appreciate learning. His favorite subject in high school was geometry, saying that “…if I can picture possible solutions, I have a much better chance of finding the right one.” Sutherland has always described himself as a visual thinker, hence his interest in computer graphics.\n\nHis first computer experience was with the famous computer Simon of Edmund Berkeley. Ivan’s first big computer program was to make Simon divide. To make division possible, he added a conditional stop to Simon’s instruction set. This program was a great accomplishment, it was the longest program ever written for Simon, a total of eight pages of paper tape. Ivan and his brother Bert (William Robert Sutherland (1936–2020)) also became a famous computer scientist) even began visiting Berkeley in New York from their home in Scarsdale while Ivan was still in grade school, and were inspired to envision new avenues for programming.\n\nSutherland went on the study at Carnegie Mellon University, where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering and then went on to earn an M.S. also in Electrical Engineering from Caltech (California Institute of Technology). For his Ph.D., Sutherland went to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) where he studied under Claude Shannon and Marvin Minsky and developed his revolutionary thesis, Sketchpad: A Man-machine Graphical Communications System, the first Graphical User Interface.\n\nSketchpad was influenced by the conceptual Memex of Vannevar Bush, as it was envisioned in his fundamental paper “As We May Think”. Sketchpad, in turn, influenced Douglas Engelbart‘s NLS (oN-Line System).\n\nThe Sketchpad, completed in January 1963, ran on the Lincoln TX-2 computer, an innovative machine designed in the late 1950s by Wesley Clark (it had a large amount of memory for its time: a vacuum-tube-driven core of 64K words, a faster, transistor-driven core of 4K words, a paper-tape reader, and could also use magnetic tape as auxiliary storage.) TX-2 was an “online” computer (at that time most computers would run “batches” of jobs and were not interactive), used to investigate the use of Surface Barrier transistors for digital circuits. TX-2 included a nine-inch CRT and a light pen which first gave Sutherland his idea. He imagined that one should be able to draw on the computer. Sketchpad was able to do just this, creating highly precise drawings, and also introduced important innovations such as memory structures to store objects and the ability to zoom in and out.\n\nThe Sketchpad uses drawing as a novel communication medium for a computer. The system contains input, output, and computation programs that enable it to interpret information drawn directly on a computer display. It was a general-purpose system and has been used to draw electrical, mechanical, scientific, mathematical, and animated drawings. Sketchpad has shown the most usefulness as an aid to the understanding of processes, such as the notion of linkages, which can be described with pictures. Sketchpad also makes it easy to draw highly repetitive or highly accurate drawings and to change drawings previously drawn with it.\n\nA Sketchpad user sketches directly on a computer display with a “light pen.” The light pen is used both to position parts of the drawing on the display and to point to them to change them. A set of push buttons controls the changes to be made such as “erase”, “move”, etc.\n\nInformation sketched can include straight line segments and circular arcs. Arbitrary symbols may be defined from any collection of line segments, circle arcs, and previously defined symbols. A user may define and use as many symbols as he wishes. Any change in the definition of a symbol is at once seen wherever that symbol appears.\n\nSketchpad stores explicit information about the topology of a drawing. If the user moves one vertex of a polygon, both adjacent sides will be moved. If the user moves a symbol, all lines attached to that symbol will automatically move to stay attached to it. The topological connections of the drawing are automatically indicated by the user as he sketches. Since Sketchpad is able to accept topological information from a human being in a picture language perfectly natural to the human, it can be used as an input program for computation programs that require topological data, e.g., circuit simulators.\n\nSketchpad itself is able to move parts of the drawing around to meet new conditions which the user may apply to them. The user indicates conditions with the light pen and push buttons. For example, to make two lines parallel, he successively points to the lines with the light pen and presses a button. The conditions themselves are displayed on the drawing so that they may be erased or changed with the light pen language. Any combination of conditions can be defined as a composite condition and applied in one step.\n\nIt is easy to add entirely new types of conditions to Sketchpad’s vocabulary. Since the conditions can involve anything computable, Sketchpad can be used for a very wide range of problems. It has been used, for example, to find the distribution of forces in the members of truss bridges drawn with it.\n\nSketchpad drawings are stored in the computer in a specially designed “ring” structure. The ring structure features rapid processing of topological information with no searching at all. The basic operations used in Sketchpad for manipulating the ring structure are described.\n\nSutherland’s contribution is not the revolutionary Sketchpad, however. In 1964 he replaced Licklider as the head of the US Defense DARPA’s Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), the motive force of the Internet.\n\nIn 1968, together with his student Bob Sproull, Sutherland created the first virtual reality and augmented reality head-mounted display system, named The Sword of Damocles.\n\nAmong his students were the famous computer scientist Alan Kay, Henri Gouraud (who devised the Gouraud shading technique), Frank Crow, who developed antialiasing methods, etc.\n\nHis company Evans and Sutherland (founded together with his friend David Evans) has done pioneering work in the field of real-time hardware, accelerated 3D computer graphics, and printer languages. Former employees of the company included the future founders of Adobe—John Warnock (1940-1923) and Silicon Graphics—Jim Clark.\n\nSutherland received the Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery in 1988 for the invention of Sketchpad. He is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, as well as the National Academy of Sciences among many other major awards.\n\nWhen there’s a will to fail, obstacles can be found.\n\nJohn McCarthy\n\nIn 1950 the British company Ferranti Ltd., which produced the world’s first general-purpose commercial computer, the Ferranti Mark 1, had undertaken to display a computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain (a national exhibition and fair that reached millions of visitors throughout the United Kingdom in the summer of 1951). By late 1950, it became evident that this promise could not be fulfilled. Then John Bennett (1921-2010), an Australian scientist, who worked for Ferranti as a computer specialist, suggested that a machine to play the game of NIM (an ancient game of strategy) against all comers should be constructed with a versatile display to illustrate the algorithm and programming principles involved. The design was implemented by a Ferranti engineer, Raymond Stuart-Williams. The computer was called NIMROD and became the first digital computer designed specifically to play a game.\n\nBennett got the idea of a Nim-playing computer from the Nimatron, an electro-mechanical machine exhibited at the 1939-1940 World’s Fair in New York. Because of the number of vacuum tubes involved, NIMROD was huge—12 feet wide, 5 feet tall, and 9 feet deep, and its weight was three and a half tons. When the Festival of Britain ended, in October 1951, the computer was displayed at the Berlin Industrial Show, again with great success, demonstrated by Dietrich Prinz, a German-English IT pioneer who would succeed, in November of the same year, in realizing the first computer program playing chess. To help explain the NIMROD computer to the British public Ferranti published a pamphlet entitled Faster than Thought. The Ferranti Nimrod Digital Computer. Discovery magazine published an artist’s watercolor impression of the NIMROD in their March 1951 issue.\n\nLater John Bennett reminisced:\n\n“In its simplest form, two players with several piles of, say, matches play the game of Nim. The players move alternately, each removing one or more of the matches from any one pile. Whoever removes the last match wins.”\n\n“The machine was a great success but not quite in the way intended, as I discovered during my time as spruiker on the Festival stand. Most of the public was quite happy to gawk at the flashing lights and be impressed. A few took an interest in the algorithm and even persisted to the point of beating the machine at the game. Only occasionally did we receive any evidence that our real message about the basics of programming had been understood.”\n\nThe Nimrod computer did not use a Cathode-Ray Tube display but used a set of fixed lights that turned on and off for a visual to describe what was happening throughout the gameplay. The interesting thing about NIM is that there is a non-obvious strategy that will ensure a win, once it can be applied. Once one player is able to make a “safe” move, the other cannot and must leave it “unsafe”, so that the first can again make it “safe” next time. Furthermore, the strategy involves viewing the numbers of tokens as binary numbers, which makes it perfect for a computer algorithm. NIMROD was an entirely fixed program. Indeed it didn’t really have a “program” in the sense used today—just logic gates wired together to compute a suitable response to each gameplay.\n\nBiography of John Bennett\n\nJohn Makepeace Bennett was born on 31 July 1921 in the southern Queensland town of Warwick, Australia, the son of Albert John Bennett and Elsie Winifred (née Bourne) Bennett (1887-1962).\n\nJohn Bennett was educated at The Southport School, then he went to the University of Queensland to study civil engineering. From 1942 until 1946 he served in the RAAF, where he worked on a radar unit on the Wessel Islands and later worked in airfield construction. He then returned to the University of Queensland to study electrical and mechanical engineering and mathematics.\n\nIn 1947 Bennett went to Cambridge University to become Maurice Wilkes’ first research assistant as part of the team working to build EDSAC—this was the world’s first practical stored-program electronic computer and the world’s first computer in regular operation from 1949. He used EDSAC to carry out the first-ever structural engineering calculations on a computer as part of his Ph.D. From 1950 until 1955 he worked for Ferranti in Manchester and London as a computer specialist. Here he designed the instruction set for Ferranti Mark 1.\n\nIn 1956, Bennett returned to Australia to become a Numerical Analyst (and later Senior Numerical Analyst) at the Adolph Basser Laboratory of the University of Sydney. Until 1958 he taught associated courses in the use of computers. In 1958 he established a Postgraduate Diploma in Numerical Analysis and Computing which was later changed to the Postgraduate Diploma in Computer Science.\n\nIn 1961, Bennet became a Professor of Physics (Electronic Computing). In 1972 the Basser Computing Department was split into the Basser Department of Computer Science (for teaching and research) and the University Computer Centre. John Bennett was appointed head of the new Basser Department of Computer Science, but it was not until 1982 that John Bennett’s title was changed to Professor of Computer Science—a title which he held until his retirement.\n\nOn 26 January 1952, Bennett married Rosalind Mary Elkington (1926-) (who was also working at Ferranti). They had four children: Christopher John (1953-), Ann Margaret (1955-), Susan Elizabeth (1957-), and Jane Mary (1960-).\n\nIn 1986 Bennett, aged 65, retired with his wife to Sydney’s Northern Beaches. He died at home on 9 December 2010.\n\nI would rather have questions, that can’t be answered, than answers that can’t be questioned.\n\nRichard Feynman\n\nAt the beginning of 1951, the American inventor David Hammond Shepard (1923–2007) constructed the first workable optical character recognition device. On 1 March 1951, he applied for a patent, which was granted on 22 Dec 1954 (see US patent Nr. 2663758 for apparatus for reading). Strangely, in his patent, Shepard didn’t mention the pioneering work of Gustav Tauschek from the 1920s and his US patent (Patent Nr. 2026329), although he mentioned the later patent of Paul Handel (US patent Nr. 1915993).\n\nDavid Shepard was a very good US engineer, known not only for his early optical character recognition device, but first also for his voice recognition system, Farrington B numeric font used on credit cards, and high altitude wind power devices.\n\nIt was in late 1950, when Shepard, a cryptanalyst at the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA), the forerunner of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), started building “Gismo” in his spare time, in the attic of his home in Arlington, Virginia, with the help of a mechanically inclined colleague, Harvey Cook Jr. They needed almost a year (and some $4000) to build the prototype, and meanwhile, Shepard applied for a patent. The patent was granted to him, but it was assigned to the newly formed Intelligent Machines Research Corporation (IMR) (founded in 1952 by Shepard and his colleague from NSA William Lawless, Jr.), which delivered the world’s first dozen commercial Optical Character Recognition systems, to big companies such as AT&T, First National City Bank, Reader’s Digest, and several other major oil companies and banks.\n\nIBM obtained a license on IMR’s patents in 1953 and in 1955 contracted with IMR (and hired Shepard for a couple of years) to build a developmental system that was able to read constrained hand-printed numeric characters if reasonably well formed. However, IBM did not market this system. In 1959 IBM did market a system of its own, classifying it as an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, and the term OCR from then on has been standard in the industry for this technology.\n\nIMR went on to deliver the world’s first several commercially used systems, including one used by Readers Digest in its book subscription department. Readers Digest donated this system many years later to the Smithsonian, where it was once put on display. The second system was sold to the Standard Oil Company of California, as arranged by the Farrington Manufacturing Company, a leading company in the credit card business at that time, with many systems to read oil company credit cards to follow, one of which was also on display at the Smithsonian later on.\n\nIn 1959 Farrington acquired IMR, and the numeric font designed by Shepard, called Farrington 7B (recognition was more reliable on a simple and open font, so Shepard decided to create one, only for digits), has been standard for most of the well-known credit cards since that time. Shepard later left Farrington and founded Cognitronics Corporation in 1962.\n\n“Gismo” of Shepard was a machine to convert printed messages into machine language for processing by computer. It worked by scanning letters with a photoelectric eye and then recording what it had read on a mechanical card-punching machine. It scanned each letter and matched its impression with its built-in memory. Let’s see how the inventor described the device in his patent:\n\nThis invention relates to methods and apparatus for interpreting information and the like.\n\nBriefly, the invention relates to the so-called reading apparatus arranged to sense printed characters, punched openings, and the like and to recognize the identity of particular characters or other items passing before the sensing means so that these items may be reproduced in various for is of coding. For example, the invention may be embodied in a machine that will scan a printed page such as a typewritten page, and produce signals which will serve to interpret each character into any desired coding and medium for use at local or remote stations.\n\nWhile many arrangements are presently known for reading characters, none of the known arrangements serve adequately to read many varieties of printed characters, nor do known arrangements make adequate provision for the misalignment of characters or disfiguration of characters.\n\nThe invention provides apparatus which is capable of reading any sort of information that may be sensed such as printing or the like, and to do so even though the characters representing the information may be disfigured and/or incorrectly aligned. With this invention, it is also possible to distinguish among many more characters of an alphabet than is possible with known reading devices.\n\nAccordingly, an object of the invention is to provide improved methods and apparatus for reading and interpreting printed or other information into various media.\n\nA further object of the invention is to provide improved reading apparatus which is capable of distinguishing among a much larger number of characters than is possible with presently known equipment.\n\nA further object of the invention, when photoelectric scanning may be employed, is to provide an electric circuit arrangement to compensate for changes in the output of a photoelectric or another light-sensitive device.\n\nA further object of the invention is to provide methods and apparatus for reading wherein the matter to be read is continuously and rapidly scanned to accommodate a large number of indications which are then combined and analyzed to provide recognition…\n\nBiography of David Shepard\n\nDavid Hammond Shepard was born on 30 September 1923 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. He was the second son of Leonard Griffin Shepard II (1881-1937), and Elizabeth Strong Hammond Shepard (1891-1935), who married in 1919. His father was the son of Leonard G. Shepard I (1846-1895), a captain in the United States Revenue Cutter Service, who is recognized today as the first Commandant of the Coast Guard. David Shepard had an elder brother, Leonard Griffin Shepard III (1921-1944), who was killed as a Lieutenant in U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II.\n\nAfter the early death of his parents (Leonard died on 4 May 1927, and Elizabeth died on 26 June 1935) David was raised by his uncle, the brother of his mother—Laurens Hammond (1895–1973), who was appointed as his guardian. Laurens Hammond was a very interesting figure himself. Born in Evanston, Illinois, on 11 January 1895 to William Andrew and Idea Louise Strong Hammond, Laurens showed his great technical prowess from an early age. His father, William, took his own life in January 1897, ostensibly due to the failure of the First National Bank of Illinois, which he had founded. Upon her husband’s death, Idea, who was an artist, relocated to France with the children (besides Laurens, she had 3 daughters: Eunice, Louise, and Elizabeth) to further her studies, and the family spent the next eleven years in France and Germany. When they returned to Evanston in 1909, Laurens, then 14, was fluent in French and German, and while in Europe, he had already designed a system for automatic transmission for automobiles. His first patent, in 1912, was for a barometer. Hammond studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University, where he graduated with honors in 1916. After taking part in WWI, he became chief engineer for a manufacturer of marine engines in Detroit. In 1919, he invented a silent spring-driven clock. This invention brought him enough money to rent his own space in New York, where he continued his remarkable carrier as an inventor.\n\nIn 1922, Hammond invented the Teleview system of shutter glasses in association with 3-D films. In 1928 his work on the synchronous motor led him to set up the Hammond Clock Company, in Chicago. Demand was high and the business soon grew into a large factory. He was responsible for a number of other inventions, such as an electric bridge table. In 1933, Hammond bought a used piano and discarded everything apart from the keyboard action. Using the keyboard as a controller, he experimented with different sound-generating methods, finally settling on one, the tonewheel generator. Thanks to his prior manufacturing and engineering experience, the tonewheel generator was extremely well-engineered by the time the “Hammond Organ” finally went into production in 1935. Tonewheel organs are still in regular use in the 21st century, which is a testament to the quality of the design and execution of the product. Hammond was awarded the Franklin Institute’s John Price Wetherill Medal in 1940 for the invention of the Hammond electric organ.\n\nDavid Shepard followed the steps of his uncle and studied for two years (1941-1943) electrical engineering at Cornell University, but was called to the US Army. He majored in 1945 as a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at the University of Michigan and then earned a Master’s Degree in Mathematics at Michigan in 1947. While serving in the Army during World War II (1943-1946) he worked for the Armed Forces Security Agency on cryptanalysis, breaking Japanese codes. After the war, he worked on other codes for the Agency until 1952, when he founded a company to manufacture his patented OCR device—Intelligent Machines Research Corporation (IMR).\n\nFarmington Manufacturing Company bought IMR in 1959, and Shepard was Vice president of Research and Development for two years. He started a new company in 1961, named Cognitronics Corporation, where he developed the conversation machine which became the first commercial device to give telephone callers access to computer data by means of their own voices, using speech recognition. The first words recognized were “yes” and “no”. This later developed into a more accurate method of optical character recognition, OCR, using lasers. David made an appearance on a 1959 episode of the TV game show, “I’ve Got A Secret”, in New York City, to demonstrate his OCR invention that could read and write (the video is available on YouTube).\n\nStarting in 1980, convinced that the world needed a new energy source and that high-altitude wind energy had the potential of being that source, Shepard began researching potential methods of capturing this energy as well as conducting wind tunnel and open-air tests on various approaches, including a test of a rising and descending kite in a Nevada desert location. Later he founded Sky WindPower Corporation with Australian Bryan William Roberts of the University of Sydney.\n\nShepard was a Charter Member of the TAWPI Hall of Fame, a Life Senior Member of the IEEE, an ACM member present at its founding at Aberdeen in 1947, and a member of the AIAA and AGU. He was a holder of 28 US patents.\n\nDavid Shepard was married twice. From his first marriage (on 13 June 1947) with Elaine Raiss Shepard (1925-1973), his fellow student at Michigan University, he had a daughter, Paula, and a son, Leonard Griffin Shepard IV. After the death of Elaine in 1973 he married Marilyn Joyce Ralph Shepard (1923–2014).\n\nDavid Hammond Shepard died at 84, on 24 November 2007, in San Diego, of bronchiectasis.\n\nBut there’s a big difference between “impossible” and “hard to imagine”. The first is about it; the second is about you!\n\nMarvin Minsky\n\nThe American mathematician Marvin Lee Minsky (1927–2016) was a founding figure in the area of artificial intelligence (AI). He is the author of several important texts concerning AI and philosophy, and built, in 1951, the first randomly wired neural network learning machine (SNARC), the confocal microscope (1957), the first head-mounted graphical display (1963), robotic devices (1963, 1967), and a musical synthesizer (1970).\n\nSNARC\n\nStochastic Neural Analog Reinforcement Calculator (SNARC) was a neural net machine, considered one of the first attempts in the field of artificial intelligence, a device that emulated the complex web of nerves in the human brain to learn from its own mistakes. In the summer of 1951, prompted by a letter from Minsky, the American psychologist, and founder of cognitive science George Armitage Miller (1920-2012) gathered the funding for the project from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research with the work to be carried out by Minsky, who was then a graduate student in mathematics at Princeton University.\n\nThe SNARC machine itself is a randomly connected network of approximately 40 Hebb synapses. These synapses each have a memory that holds the probability that the signal comes in one input and another signal will come out of the output. There is a probability knob that goes from 0 to 1 that shows this probability of the signals propagating. If the probability signal gets through, a capacitor remembers this function and engages a “clutch”. At this point, the operator will press a button to give a reward to the machine, then a large motor starts and there is a chain that goes to all 40 synapse machines, checking if the clutch is engaged or not. As the capacitor can only “remember” for a certain amount of time, the chain only catches the most recent updates of the probabilities.\n\nThe neural net idea was unique in that it did not require programmers to specify every line of code, but could be “grown” and trained in an organic way. In 1969 Minsky, along with Seymour Papert, wrote the book Perceptrons, the first systematic study of parallelism in computation and a classical work on threshold automata networks.\n\nBiography of Marvin Minsky\n\nMarvin Lee Minsky was born on 9 August 1927 in New York City, to the Jewish family of Dr. Henry Minsky (1895-1954) and Fannie Judith (nee Reiser) Minsky (1902-1985), whose families were natives of Russian Empire. Henry was an eye surgeon, who was chief of ophthalmology at Mount Sinai Hospital, and Fannie was an artist, social activist, and Zionist. Marvin had an elder sister, Charlotte (1925-1983).\n\nMarvin had prodigious intellectual gifts and was educated in progressive schools in New York, where he attended the Ethical Culture School in Manhattan, Fieldston School in Riverdale, Bronx High School of Science, and later the Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. After serving in the US Navy in the Second World War (1944-45), he earned a degree in mathematics in 1950 from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, then in 1954 got his doctorate on learning machines, at Princeton University in New Jersey. When Minsky finished his Ph.D., the eminent mathematicians John von Neumann, Norbert Wiener, and Claude Shannon all recommended him for appointment as a junior fellow at Harvard.\n\nWhen his Harvard fellowship ended in 1958, Minsky accepted an appointment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he would remain on faculty for the rest of his life. In his first year at MIT, Minsky founded the AI Lab, which quickly became a leading center for artificial Intelligence research. The lab popularized the idea of the digital sharing of information, giving rise to the open-source movement. The lab conducted much of the initial work on the ARPANET, which ultimately evolved into the Internet of today.\n\nMarvin Minsky was the recipient of numerous honors and awards, among them the Turing Award, the IEEE Computer Society’s Computer Pioneer Award, and the Franklin Institute’s Benjamin Franklin Medal.\n\nOn 30 July 1952, Minsky married Gloria Anna Rudisch (1926-), a prominent Boston pediatrician, and they had three children—the twins Henry and Juliana, and Margaret. Gloria recalled her first conversation with Marvin: “He said he wanted to know about how the brain worked. I thought he is either very wise or very dumb. Fortunately, it turned out to be the former.” Minsky and his wife often welcomed students into their home, where several pianos stood as a reminder that Minsky was a musical prodigy, able to improvise fugues in the baroque style of J.S. Bach.\n\nIn 1985, Minsky published a book, The Society of Mind, stating that intelligence emerges from the cooperative behavior of multiple agents, none of which is intelligent. Then, in 2006, Minsky published The Emotion Machine, in which he noted, that concepts such as intelligence are ‘suitcase words’, into which one can stuff multiple meanings. He wrote that our resourceful intelligence arises from multiple ways of thinking on multiple levels, and from multiple ways of representing knowledge. Minsky argued that “somewhere down the line, some computers will become more intelligent than most people,” but that it was very hard to predict how fast progress would be. He cautioned that an artificial superintelligence designed to solve an innocuous mathematical problem might decide to assume control of Earth’s resources to build supercomputers to help achieve its goal, but believed that such negative scenarios are “hard to take seriously” because he felt confident that AI would go through a lot of testing before being deployed.\n\nMarvin Minsky died on 24 January 2016 of a cerebral hemorrhage in Boston, Massachusetts, at the age of 88.\n\nThe sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence.\n\nJean Baudrillard\n\nThe first artificial intelligence program (the first program especially engineered to mimic the problem-solving skills of a human being) was created in 1955-56 by Herbert Simon, Allen Newell, and John Shaw.\n\nHerbert Alexander Simon (1916–2001), a Nobel Prize (in Economics) winner from 1978, was an American political scientist, economist, sociologist, and psychologist, whose research ranged across the fields of cognitive psychology, cognitive science, computer science, public administration, economics, management, philosophy of science, sociology, and political science. With almost a thousand highly cited publications, he was one of the most influential social scientists of the XX century.\n\nSimon was consulting RAND Corporation in the early 1950s, and while seeing there a printer typing out a map, using ordinary letters, digits, and punctuation as symbols, he realized that a machine that could manipulate symbols could just as well simulate decision-making and possibly even the process of human thought.\n\nThe program that printed the map had been written by Allen Newell (1927-1992), a RAND Corporation scientist studying logistics and organization theory. For Newell, the decisive moment was in 1954 he watched a presentation on pattern matching and suddenly understood how the interaction of simple, programmable units could accomplish complex behavior, including the intelligent behavior of human beings.\n\nNewell and Simon began to talk about the possibility of teaching machines to think. Their first project was a program that could prove mathematical theorems like the ones used in Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica. Newell enlisted the help of a mathematician and computer programmer from RAND, John Clifford “Cliff” Shaw (1922–1991), to develop the program.\n\nIn the summer of 1956, John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, and Claude Shannon organized a conference at Dartmouth College on the subject of what they called “artificial intelligence” (a term coined by McCarthy for the occasion). Simon and Newell proudly presented the group with their Logic Theorist and were somewhat surprised when the program received a lukewarm reception. Later on, Simon confides: They didn’t want to hear from us, and we sure didn’t want to hear from them: we had something to show them! … In a way it was ironic because we already had done the first example of what they were after; and second, they didn’t pay much attention to it.\n\nCliff Shaw coded the Logic Theorist using an early version of IPL (Information Processing Language) programming language, running on a computer of RAND’s Santa Monica research facility.\n\nThe Logic Theorist established the field of heuristic programming and soon proved 38 of the first 52 theorems in chapter 2 of the Principia Mathematica. The proof of one of the theorems was surprisingly more elegant than the proof produced laboriously by hand by Russell and Whitehead. Simon was able to show the new proof to Bertrand Russell himself who responded with delight.\n\nA detailed description of the Logic Theorist can be found in a RAND memorandum from June 1963."
