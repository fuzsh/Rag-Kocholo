Should they also quantize time? Most hardware systems quantize time by driving all parts with a rhythmic global clock. Many programming systems quantize time by doing tasks as a sequence of steps. Avoiding the step-wise thinking encouraged by quantized time may be the key to parallelism in both hardware and software.\n\nBiography\n\nIvan Sutherland received a Ph.D. degree from MIT in 1963, He is a member of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering. He was the 1988 recipient of the Turing award and the 2012 recipient of the Kyoto Prize in Advanced Technology. Dr. Sutherland is author of over 60 patents, as well as numerous papers. He makes his home in Portland where he works at Portland State University (PSU) in the Asynchronous Research Center (ARC) that he founded with his wife, Marly Roncken, in 2008., powered by Concept3D Event Calendar Software",
