Caltech\n\nB.S. Carnegie Institute of Technology\n\nResearch Interests:\n\nDesign of self-timed and asynchronous circuits, systems, design methods, and design tools\n\nProfile:\n\nIvan E. Sutherland (M’62) received his B.S. degree from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, his M.S. degree from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, and his Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1963, all in electrical engineering. He holds honorary degrees from Harvard University, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Utah. He joined Sun in 1990 as a Sun Fellow, Sun’s highest technical rank. He leads a small group working on asynchronous systems; his group develops asynchronous circuit methodologies and design techniques for fast CMOS circuits and applies them to new hardware architectures. His book, Logical Effort, published in 1999 with joint authors Sproull and Harris, describes the mathematics of designing fast circuits. His 1963 MIT Ph.D., Sketchpad, is very widely known, as is his early work on what is now known as Virtual Reality. He is author of 36 patents, as well as numerous publications and lectures. Dr. Sutherland’s honors include the Turing Award, Kyoto Award and the Von Neumann Award. He is a Fellow of the ACM and a member of both the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences\n\nProfessional Affiliations:\n\nAssociation for Computing Machinery Fellow\n\nMember, United States National Academy of Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Engineering member\n\nAwards and Recognition:\n\n2012 Kyoto Prize in the category of advanced technology\n\n2016 National Inventors Hall of Fame Inductee\n\n1998[9] IEEE John von Neumann Medal\n\n1996 The Franklin Institute's Certificate of Merit\n\n1994 Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF Pioneer Award\n\n1993 ACM Software System Award\n\n1988 Turing Award\n\n1986 IEEE Emanuel R. Piore Award\n\n1972 National Academy of Engineering First Zworykin Award\n\n1996 CyberEdge Journal Virtual Reality Pioneer Award\n\nSelected Publications:"
