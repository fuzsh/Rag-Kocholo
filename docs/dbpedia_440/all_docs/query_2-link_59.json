SPLASH is an annual conference that embraces all aspects of software construction and delivery, and that joins all factions of programming technologies. Since 2010 SPLASH is the umbrella for OOPSLA and Onward!. This year it features a third technical track, Wavefront, designed to publish innovative work closely related to advanced development and production software. SPLASH takes on the notable track record of OOPSLA as a premier forum for software innovation, while broadening the scope of the confer ...",

        "text": "Bio:\n\nIvan E. Sutherland (M’62) received his B.S. degree from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, his M.S. degree from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, and his Ph.D. degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, in 1963, all in electrical engineering. He holds honorary degrees from Harvard University, the University of North Carolina, and the University of Utah. He joined Sun in 1990 as a Sun Fellow, Sun’s highest technical rank. He leads a small group working on asynchronous systems; his group develops asynchronous circuit methodologies and design techniques for fast CMOS circuits and applies them to new hardware architectures. His book, Logical Effort, published in 1999 with joint authors Sproull and Harris, describes the mathematics of designing fast circuits. His 1963 MIT Ph.D., Sketchpad, is very widely known, as is his early work on what is now known as Virtual Reality. He is author of 36 patents, as well as numerous publications and lectures. Dr. Sutherland’s honors include the Turing Award, Kyoto Award and the Von Neumann Award. He is a Fellow of the ACM and a member of both the National Academy of Engineering and the National Academy of Sciences"
