        "text": "The Holy Grail of number theory It is said that there is no formula for the occurrence of prime numbers. On the other hand, in science, a formula is a concise way of expressing information symbolically. It is unclear to me whether my conjecture meets the definition of the formula: 1. There exists a prime number p > 3 such that p = 6a¬±1 ‚â† (6b¬±1)( 6c¬±1), where a, b, and c are natural numbers. Yesterday I asked our conscript researcher to prove it and today the proof was ready (I didn‚Äôt find an error, someone else could). Do you know any mathematicians or mathematical researchers that would like to have a brief discussion about the idea? I haven't found it in the literature, so there's a small chance it's new. I would appreciate the help. #primenumber #conjecture #formula\n\nI literally do feel it. Stream-of-consciousness (continuum* delivery of uncountable flux) conceptualization (migration of plausible thought into active thought) of the \"{\" as opening an argument causes the \"{\" that can cleanly be drawn when looking at my right profile, around my occipital bump, to crush inward into my head. All the vasodilation that has been operative to keep my conception of a \"set,\" the base conception I then start internally partitioning, I suppose, to define particular sets, when thinking about mathematics, falls inwards. And it takes an unbelievable amount of time to restore it, especially that given how I type, which further streams that uncountable flux (*) into a computer, where it then gets /locked/. No wonder I feel crazy stuff all the time. I need to be really, really careful with what, exactly, I type. *This is why the continuum hypothesis proof matters.\n\nThe nonverbal and unquantifiable information is often called quality; the verbal and quantifiable information is often called quantity. Science requires the understanding of both qualitative and quantitative understanding. Many a scientist tend to think that being scientific means little qualitative information and almost only quantitative information. Surely, this brings a false sense of superiority, but it hinders first and foremost the understanding of nature of the scientist, and then the masses. The reason why quantum mechanics and general relativity are so difficult to understand, is the heavy reliance on matrices, i.e. tensors. Equations are there to bring us qualitative understandings, not to intimidate the masses, especially girls, from studying it. After all, most scientists obsessed with linear algebra remember those equations by heart, just like little girls doing good at arts subjects in high school.\n\nMeet Dr Peter van der Kamp, Senior Lecturer in Mathematics. ‚ÄúIn my research I am an explorer, turning stones to find beauty, or what could be a new species in the mathematical universe. When I teach, I want to express beauty through mathematics,‚Äù Dr van der Kamp says. In addition to being an academic, Dr van der Kamp is also an artist who creates images from mathematical equations. ‚ÄúMy art is important because it speaks louder than formulas. Each piece carries layers of meaning, each colour and curve is determined by numbers, and each piece tells a story,‚Äù he says. The artwork Dr van der Kamp is holding is titled 'Consideration'. A 200-year-old theory of Lagrange multipliers has been used to find three concentric circles that touch the parabola, a u-shaped symmetrical curve. ‚ÄúThis piece is dedicated to my father,\" he explains. \"It holds specific meanings for me. His approach to life, and art, is quite considerate. Most considerations are internal, but their manifestation will be presented beautifully. Life itself is optimisation and freedom is when you can create your own objective function and constraints.\" Find out more. #LaTrobeComputingEngineeringandMathematicalSciences #Mathematics #MathematicalArt\n\nHappy National Mathematics Day! This day is celebrated on the birth anniversary of legendary mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan. Ramanujan, a self-taught genius, used to amaze colleagues with his intuition. Legend has it that he found connections between numbers and the mathematical cosmos that others couldn‚Äôt even fathom. He once said his formulas came to him in dreams‚Äîtalk about a mathematical dreamland! Despite facing challenges, Ramanujan produced over 3900 results in his short life, uncovering new realms of number theory. His notebooks are like treasure maps to mathematical wonders! Let‚Äôs toast to Ramanujan, the maestro of math, and sprinkle a bit of his dreamy magic in our own calculations today! #NationalMathematicsDay #RamanujanMagic\n\nWhat the mathematician #TerenceTao says about #Rigor_and_Intuition? The point of rigour is not to destroy all intuition; instead, it should be used to destroy bad intuition while clarifying and elevating good intuition. It is only with a combination of both rigorous formalism and good intuition that one can tackle complex mathematical problems; one needs the former to correctly deal with the fine details, and the latter to correctly deal with the big picture. Without one or the other, you will spend a lot of time blundering around in the dark (which can be instructive, but is highly inefficient). So once you are fully comfortable with rigorous mathematical thinking, you should revisit your intuitions on the subject and use your new thinking skills to test and refine these intuitions rather than discard them. #mathematics #mathematicseducation\n\nAs a mathematician, this is mind blowing!! Try it yourself. Get a calculator ‚àö2 then cube the answer, divide by 2, then cube the answer, divide by 2, repeat to infinity and it will give you the same number. üò≥ü§î However, any number greater than ‚àö2 the limit as the repetitions increases gets infinitesimally large and any number less than ‚àö2 gets infinitesimally small. Terrence Howard goes on how to explain how bankers use similar kinds of anomalies in mathematics to make money from thin air. Pretty cool. \"I have spent 45 years trying to figure out how the universe really works....we are abandoning the models of black holes and dark matter.. for an electric model of the universe....I think it should be explored!\"üëèüôå Full revolutionary lecture. üëá https://lnkd.in/gYZVytDE There are ideas that when explored will change our world. üß° Below is the direct link to my website with my in-depth articles & email list sign up üëâ https://lnkd.in/gDMu9iEn\n\nDoes using a calculator make a mathematician less of a mathematician? Does it make your opinion of them lessen? Does it make you think they aren't a \"real\" mathematician? Or... do you think it helps them to focus on the creative side of math? Do you consider that maybe multiplying 658 with 762 is better done by a computer? Do you ever stop and wonder if maybe the rote is less important than the creative? Have you ever wondered what renowned mathematicians of old would have been able to accomplish if they didn't need to stop and calculate the square root of 134891034? My takeaways? 1. The fundamental rote \"thinking\" stuff that makes up any profession is critical AND can likely be done better, faster, and more reliably by a computer than a human. 2. The fundamental rote \"thinking\" stuff done by hand takes so much time and creative energy... both of which would be far better applied to other avenues. 3. Conformity will no longer bring value as a professional in the coming future. Do you disagree?"
