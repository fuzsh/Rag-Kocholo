        "text": "Title\n\nDevelopment of Computer Graphics and Visualization Techniques, 1965-1978\n\nCitation\n\nIn 1965, the University of Utah established a Center of Excellence for computer graphics research with Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) funding. In 1968, two professors founded the pioneering graphics hardware company Evans & Sutherland; by 1978, fundamental rendering and visualization techniques disclosed in doctoral dissertations included the Warnock algorithm, Gouraud shading, the Catmull-Rom spline, and the Blinn-Phong reflection model. Alumni-founded companies include Atari, Silicon Graphics, Adobe, Pixar, and Netscape.\n\nStreet address(es) and GPS coordinates of the Milestone Plaque Sites\n\nSite 1: 50 Central Campus Dr, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 US (GPS: 40.768052, -111.846582)\n\nSite 2: Pixar Animation Studios, 1200 Park Ave., Emeryville, CA 94608 US (37.8326714, -122.2836945)\n\nSite 3: Computer History Museum, 1401 N.

Edwin Catmull and Alan Kay, and faculty Dr. Ivan Sutherland), and the Kyoto Prize (alumnus Dr. Alan Kay and faculty Dr. Ivan Sutherland)\n\nseveral important companies were formed by both faculty and alumni which helped to create new industries, including Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp. (created by faculty members Evans and Sutherland in 1968, and whose hardware was used by Utah faculty, students, and alumni), Pixar (Dr. Edwin Catmull in 1986), Adobe (Dr. John Warnock in 1982), Atari (EE Bachelors grad Nolan Bushnell in 1972), and Silicon Graphics (1982) and Netscape (1994) (both by Dr. James Clark)\n\nIvan Sutherland and Sketchpad\n\nIvan Sutherland’s 1963 ground-breaking MIT PhD dissertation Sketchpad: A Man-Machine Graphical Communication System described his geometrical design program and the world's first graphical user interface (GUI). The widespread impact of Sketchpad led to Sutherland's serving as Director of ARPA’s IPTO from 1964-66, which allowed him to direct $15 million annually to sponsor computer research projects at universities, research centers, and elsewhere across the U.S.\n\nThe Importance of Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp.\n\nDavid Evans and Ivan Sutherland both knew of each other, leading Sutherland to accept Evans' invitation to join the Univ. of Utah faculty in the newly-established computer science division of its Electrical Engineering Department. This quickly led to the 1968 founding on the university campus of Evans & Sutherland (“E&S”), a very early company dedicated to the design and creation of hardware necessary to enable development of new computer graphics techniques.\n\nE&S hardware supported the computer graphics work being developed by students and staff, and its initial place of business was on property owned by the university. Sutherland's presence also helped ensure a continued flow of ARPA funding to the university. Univ. of Utah alumni were amongst the E&S employees, including Drs. John Warnock, Edwin Catmull, and James Clark.\n\nAll of this created a first-of-its-kind environment for Utah students to be able to develop seminal rendering and visualization techniques, and these were described in their PhD dissertations (e.g., the Warnock algorithm, Gouraud shading, the Catmull-Rom spline, and the Blinn-Phong reflection model) and in their subsequent endeavors (e.g., the Catmull-Clark surface patch, and the rendering equation by James Kajiya while he was a Cal Tech professor).\n\nARPA Funding for the University of Utah\n\nChapter 4 in Wayne Carlson's History of Computer Graphics and Animation book shows how Evans was asked to establish a computer graphics program at the Univ. of Utah, and how it had received a large ARPA (later called DARPA) grant with which to work: \"The University of Utah established one of the pioneer, and certainly one of the most influential computer graphics programs in the country when they asked David Evans (who joined Utah in 1965) to establish a program that could advance the state of the art in this new field in 1968. The computer science department had received a large Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) grant ($5M/year for 3 years) which resulted in the work of many faculty and graduate students who have pushed the CGI discipline to where it is today. ... Evans joined with Ivan Sutherland, who developed Sketchpad at MIT.\"\n\nUniv. of California Prof. Jacob Gaboury, whose 2021 MIT Press book Image Objects: An Archaeology of Computer Graphics is cited herein, clarified two of Carlson's statements: (1) re: Evans having \"joined Utah in 1965\": Evans was hired by the Univ. of Utah in 1965, and joined the faculty in January 1966, and (2) re: the \"$5M/year for 3 years\" grant: this was actually a grant of $5 million which was provided at a rate of approx. $1.3 million/year over a 4-year period.\n\nDavid Evans' Important Role\n\nWhile Evans is often overshadowed by the more well-known Ivan Sutherland, Evans' importance cannot be overstated. Through Evans, the Univ. of Utah received a grant of $5M to build a Center of Excellence for computer graphics research from ARPA's Information Processing Technology Office Director Bob Taylor in 1965 (see Taylor's Computer History Museum Oral History at p. 16). Evans secured this ARPA grant \"immediately following\" his 1965 hiring by Utah (see Gaboury's book at p. 19). Alan Kay \"wandered off to graduate school at the University of Utah, which he ended up considering 'the best luck I ever had.' The computer science pioneer David Evans was building there the best graphics program in the country\" (see Isaacson's The Innovators at p. 283). Evans and Sutherland \"were magnets for bright students with diverse interests, and they led us with a light touch\" (see Catmull's Creativity, Inc. at p. 12).\n\nThe Importance of University of Utah Faculty in Areas Including Audio\n\nAn excellent overview of the University of Utah's impact on CG is in the Utah Computer History Project document.\n\nInnovation at the Univ. of Utah in 1968 was not limited to computer graphics - it extended to other media as well. In 1968, Thomas G. Stockham, Jr. joined the Electrical Engineering faculty where he would also make major contributions: as PhD advisor to R. Rom and J. Kajiya, as one of six technical experts to determine the cause of the famous 18 1/2 minute gap on a crucial Watergate tape, and as an innovator in digital audio editing as recognized by his 1998 Academy Award (a Scientific and Engineering Award). The climate created by so much talent also influenced Nolan Bushnell, who was an undergraduate Electrical Engineering student and alumnus.\n\nAn exemplary example of the Univ. of Utah faculty is Prof. Richard Riesenfeld, who joined the faculty in 1972 a year before his Syracuse Univ. PhD dissertation was completed, taught there for his entire career of 47 years, and became Professor Emeritus in 2019. The 1975 PhD dissertation of Martin Newell cites Riesenfeld's 1973 paper Applications of B-spline Approximation to Geometric problems of Computer-Aided Design, and also cites papers by numerous other professors (incl. Sutherland) and fellow students and alumni (incl. Warnock, Gouraud, Phong, and Catmull). Riesenfeld continued to publish until as late as 2013 with A B-spline-like basis for the Powell-Sabin 12-split based on simplex splines. Thus, the computer graphics field was advanced dramatically by both faculty and students at the Univ. of Utah.\n\nACM SIGGRAPH Background on the Univ. of Utah’s Importance\n\nThe ACM SIGGRAPH Steven Anson Coons Award is the highest award in computer graphics. The description of why David Evans was the 1989 awardee (https://www.siggraph.org/1989-steven-anson-coons-award-david-evans/) details the merits of this Milestone:\n\n[David Evans’] early foray into computer graphics subsequently led to the golden era of computer graphics at the University of Utah and the founding of the Evans and Sutherland Computer Company in Salt Lake City. Dr. Evans returned home to Utah to build up the Computer Science Department of the University of Utah. There he assembled faculty including such well known individuals as Ivan Sutherland, the first recipient of the Coons Award, and Thomas G. Stockham.\n\nSteven Coons was a visiting faculty member at Utah in 1973. William Newman, co-author with Robert Sproull of the well-known textbook, spent several years there. Newman said: “He (Evans) had a particular style of running a department that I now think of as magical, in the sense that everything one could wish for seemed to arrive almost without asking.”\n\nThe period from 1967 through at least 1975 was an extraordinary time for computer graphics at Utah. There was a rare confluence of faculty, students, staff, facilities and resources to support vision research and hard work that produced remarkable developments in computer graphics. This research was responsible for the birth of continuous-tone computer graphics as we know it today. An amazing constellation of students passed through the University of Utah and their names are to be found throughout the publications of SIGGRAPH and other graphics journals. Among them were Jim Blinn and Jim Clark, previous Achievement Award winners, and this year’s Achievement Award Winner John Warnock. Many of his students have remarked that it was David Evans’ vision and his commitment to them that made their work possible. His guidance and advice were influential in giving them a sense of self-realization.\n\nBeyond his abilities as an educator are his achievements in the business world. With Ivan Sutherland he founded the Evans and Sutherland Computer Corporation to produce premier computer graphics display equipment. A large part of this company’s business concerns real time simulation of scenes associated with aircraft flying and automobiles driving. These real time simulators are a partial expression of David Evans’ wish to contribute to all manner of simulation. He has been known to say that engineering design is just another form of simulation of the products to be built.\n\nAnne Exline’s 1990 article in IEEE Potentials titled Computer Graphics succinctly addresses the topic of the historical significance of the work done at the Univ. of Utah as follows:\n\nIvan Sutherland and David Evans, the “godfathers” of computer graphics, gravitated to the University of Utah. (David Evans had defined the principle of incremental computing, i.e., using computations for one pixel to define adjacent pixels.) Why? Because one of the main organizations funding computer graphics research at that time was the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). And many of the advances in graphics technology occurred at the University of Utah under their sponsorship. As a result, the group of graphics pioneers that located there is still referred to as the “Utah Mafia.” In 1971, Henri Gouraud developed an algorithm to smooth out color changes between adjacent polygons, which is still used and referred to as Gouraud shading. Bui Tuong-Phong, in 1975, devised the modeling to define the plastic-looking objects which is today known as Phong shading. Ed Catmull developed the principle of texture mapping.\n\nDr. Alvy Ray Smith, who co-founded Pixar with Dr. Edwin Catmull, wrote the 2021 book A Biography of the Pixel, whose Fig. 7.12 (titled “Digital Movies Epoch 2: 1965-2000”) on pp. 332-333 provides an overview of important people at various universities, companies and governmental organizations who were critical to development of computer graphics technology and techniques that led to the first fully computer-animated feature-length motion pictures, including the first of these in 1995: Toy Story. This Fig. 7.12 includes members of the “Utah Mafia” at the Univ. of Utah, as they were called by Exline in her book as quoted above. Smith’s book chronicles the maturation of rendering and visualization techniques for which the university’s doctoral students played an essential role. Approximately one quarter of all the names of contributors in this Fig. 7.12 have roots in the Univ. of Utah, as shown in the flow of people from “E&S 1968” in this figure.\n\nUtah Grads Have Had an Impact on CAD, and on Animation in Medical Applications\n\nDistinguished Utah graduates have also produced technology enabling modern CAD products such as the popular engineering products SOLIDWORKS and AutoCAD Rivet, and animation techniques used well beyond just motion pictures such as medical applications as shown by Christopher Ray Johnson’s 1988 dissertation.\n\nGouraud Shading\n\nSmith’s book describes the genesis of a fundamental “shading” technique at the Univ. of Utah in his “Shading Gets More Realistic” section on pp. 341-343 and Figs. 7.18 and 7.19. Smith discusses how in 1971 the Frenchman Henri Gouraud devised an interpolation scheme that produced continuous shading of surfaces, a method which became known as “Gouraud shading” and which remains a fundamental technique to this day. This method was set forth in the Gouraud’s ARPA-funded 1971 Univ. of Utah PhD dissertation. Gouraud shading was followed shortly thereafter by Phong shading, developed by Bui Tuong Phong in his 1974 Univ. of Utah PhD dissertation, which allowed for smoother shading techniques, but whixh required greater computational resources. Both methods are described on pp. 96-100, and in figures 3.6-3.7, of Gaboury's book.\n\nIn Isabelle Bellin’s Computer-Generated Images: Palm of Longevity for Gouraud’s Shading, the author quotes Henri Gouraud: \"It must be said that the University of Utah, and in particular our department, was a real nursery of researchers in image synthesis.\" Bellin described one aspect of Gouraud’s work on shading: “Moreover, to explore the limits of his technique, Henri Gouraud did not hesitate to take his wife as a model! ‘What could be more complicated to reproduce than a face?’ he retorts. One evening, she agreed to serve science: he painted lines on her face in black pencil, measured the vertices of the polygons and entered everything into the computer. The images of Sylvie Gouraud's face, shaped by the computer according to the shading of her husband, have been published in many magazines and have featured prominently at the Museum of Computer Science in Boston (Mountain View today).” This famous photo (the Computer History Museum's Catalog No. 102724490) allows Gouraud’s mathematical algorithm to be visualized as a compelling work of art.\n\nCatmull-Rom spline\n\nA spline is a mathematical function defined piecewise by polynomials. The Catmull-Rom spline was first described in an appendix of Catmull’s 1974 Univ. of Utah doctoral dissertation, and it is illustrated and discussed in Smith’s book on pp. 239-240. Edwin Catmull and Raphael Rom received their PhDs from the Univ. of Utah in 1974 and 1975, respectively, with Catmull's receiving ARPA funding.\n\nBlinn-Phong reflection model\n\nThis is a 1977 James Blinn modification of the Phong reflection model, which is also sometimes referred to as the \"modified Phong reflection model.\" It is the default shading model used in the Open Graphics Library (aka OpenGL), a widely-used API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. Phong and Blinn received their PhDs from the Univ. of Utah in 1973 and 1978, respectively, with Phong's receiving ARPA funding.\n\nWarnock algorithm\n\nThis is a hidden surface determination algorithm invented by John Warnock which solves the problem of rendering a complicated image by recursive subdivision of a scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. It was first described in John Warnock’s 1969 ARPA-funded Univ. of Utah PhD dissertation titled \"A Hidden Surface Algorithm for Computer Generated Halftone Pictures\". The history of the hidden surface problem is the subject of Chapter 1 of Gaboury’s book, and Warnock’s algorithm is described on pp. 48-49 and in Figure 1.8 therein.\n\nRendering equation\n\nThis is an equation which quickly became integral to computer graphics after it was introduced at the 1986 SIGGRAPH conference by both a Cornell Univ. team led by David Immel, and by Cal Tech’s James Kajiya in a paper titled The Rendering Equation. Kajiya received his Utah PhD in 1979. See also Tomas Akenine-Moller, et al., Real-Time Rendering, 4th Edition, 2018, CRC Press, at p. 437.\n\nHonors received by some of those discussed herein are as follows:\n\nDr. Ivan Sutherland:\n\n1972: National Academy of Engineering: First Valdimir K.

This Milestone shows the amazing way in which U.S. government funding in the wake of the Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik in 1957 led to research and development in this arena at various universities and other institutions across the U.S., and this had a dramatic impact on advances in computer graphics hardware and software which made use of that hardware. Smith’s book on p. 256 describes that “the first documented computer animations appeared on Whirlwind at MIT in 1951, funded by the Air Force” and that its immediate successor Sage Computer received government funding that was “comparable in size and cost to the Manhattan or Apollo Projects.”\n\nSmith’s book on p. 254 describes the founding of the U.S. government’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). On pp. 293-294, Smith discusses ARPA’s funding of computer graphics development starting in the early 1960s with its formation of the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO), and how Bob Taylor’s work there led to his founding the famous Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The above-referenced Fig. 7.12 in Smith’s book shows how Xerox PARC played an important role in computer graphics development. Gaboury's book also describes the ARPA funding of the Univ. of Utah program, which was awarded a $5 million grant from ARPA’s Information Processing Techniques office in 1965 for research into “man-machine graphical communication,” which was responsible for funding much of the early research at Utah.\n\nThe linkage of the Whirlwind and Sage computers and ARPA funding to Dr. Ivan Sutherland’s 1962-63 development of his famous Sketchpad geometrical design program for his 1963 PhD thesis at MIT is shown in Fig. 6.13 (titled “Early Computer Graphics: Second Stage of Epoch 1, 1950s-60s”) on pp. 250-251 of Smith’s book. Sutherland is known as “the father of computer graphics“ because of Sketchpad, as discussed on pp. 275-277 of Smith’s book, and Smith at p. 287 delineates how Sketchpad was absolutely unique: \"What Sutherland accomplished with Sketchpad was the first interactively rendered computer graphics.\"\n\n“Sketchpad … made it possible to create graphic images directly on a display screen by using a hand-held object such as a lightpen. It was the first program that allowed the creation of graphic images directly on a display screen rather than by entering codes and formulas into the computer through a keyboard. Sketchpad provided the foundation for what would become the Graphical User Interface, which is ubiquitous today, having brought to large numbers of discretionary uses the power and utility of the desktop computer.” (From https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/ivan-sutherland)\n\nIn 1968, computer graphics was a very rudimentary area. As techniques and hardware matured over the subsequent decades, lifelike computer animation of three-dimensional imagery in films, games, flight simulators, and computer-aided design were all made possible by a combination of software and hardware. An early example of this maturation was the Evans & Sutherland Computer Corp. progenitor of the GPU (graphics processing unit) for its CT5 flight simulator in the 1980 timeframe, although E&S had been working on specialized hardware for computer graphics since 1969 with the release of their first Line Drawing System, the LDS-1. Chapter 5 of Gaboury's book discusses the development of the GPU concept and its origins at E&S, as well as discussion on pp. 179-181 of the first modern GPU: the 1979 proof-of-concept \"Geometry Engine\" designed by Utah PhD alumnus James Clark.\n\nSutherland served as Director of ARPA’s IPTO from 1964-66, and he ensured that the Univ. of Utah would continue to receive ARPA funding when he joined the faculty in 1968. The fact that the Univ. of Utah received significant ARPA funding with very little interference regarding how the funding was spent is discussed by Dr. Catmull on p. 10 of his Computer History Museum Oral History.\n\nAn interview with Univ. of California Prof. Jacob Gaboury about his book was recorded by the Univ. of California’s “Berkeley Book Chat” series. In this interview, Dr. Gaboury described that funding for the work by Evans and Sutherland came from the Department of Defense (DoD), but that defense interest in funding graphics eventually dried up with the passage of the Mansfield Amendment in 1972.\n\nSmith’s book at pp. 351-378 describes how Alexander Schure provided significant personal funding for computer graphics development work done by Smith, Catmull, Jim Clark and others at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) from 1974-79. Smith’s book at pp. 423-425 describes how Pixar was co-founded by Smith and Catmull in 1986 based on technology spun off from George Lucas’ Lucasfilm, and how funding from Steve Jobs led to Toy Story in 1995 being the first feature-length computer-animated film.\n\nFeatures that set this work apart from similar achievements\n\nThe Univ. of Utah’s incredible productivity from the time of Sutherland joining the faculty until at least the early 1990s was the subject of a Harvard Business School case study by H. Kent Bowen & Courtney Purrington: University of Utah and the Computer Graphics Revolution (March 19, 2007).\n\nAs a group, the Univ. of Utah contributed more to the field of knowledge in computer graphics than any of their contemporaries, and that fact is made most apparent both in successful business applications and in the body of awards garnered.
