        "text": "What is this #paradox anyway? Human brain is said to be the most powerful computer in the world. It can do most of things combine where brain of other species took years to master. Leave these, look at the changes, technologically, that we see around. It's human intelligence behind advancing the world this far in last couple of centuries. Not going in deep with all the capabilities but you got it what am I trying to put in here. Yet for normal people, #productivity gurus and experts suggest us to \"trick\" our brains using \"hacks.\" As in it's a child with superpower abilities, but child, so it can be manuvered easily. More #funny, we talk about tricking our mind, using our mind, and the thought to trick our mind struck to our mind by our mind itself. It plans to cheat on itself. See how easy it is to manipulate the most powerful machine to hack itself, for good or for bad even. Now just see this, if you have come down till here reading this piece, you are most likely to leave at least a like or some reaction. Cz your mind don't want to get your 'effort' or reading it go waste and reacting to the post will make you feel a part of it. How cool is this! #human #brain #intelligence\n\nThe last months we have been working on something cool: The Bias Checker. To combine &samhoud's knowledge on the behaviour of people and the power of AI we have developed this tool to quickly check bias'es in any given text, speech, vacancy or web text. Biases and blindspots can be a problem to create diverse organisations, especially when leaders are not aware of them. The tool pretty magically shows them. So give it a try at https://www.samhoud.ai :) Let me know if it helps you to find some unexpected biasses! Kudos to Remy Middelhoff, Hugo Philips and Daan den Otter for taking this from a small internal experiment to something now publicly available! #artificialintelligence #ai #biases #behaviour #psychology\n\nThe best part about the work we do is supporting passionate, curious founders who are solving problems they know inside and out. üî¶ That's why we'd like to take a moment to highlight Joel Reji and Heimdall ML ü§ñ Machine Learning is all the rage right now, but it's a fairly daunting subject for those who do not come from technical backgrounds. üí° But, what if anyone could drag and drop a dataset, point to the field they'd like to make predictions on, and then start making predictions right away? Enter Heimdall, helping folks harness the power of ML to build and deploy accurate models without any infrastructure complexity. üèóÔ∏è Need to structure your data to enable analysis or forecasting? Heimdall has you covered there, too. üëâ We invite you to try it out yourself -- it's free (for now) and incredibly powerful! #venturebuilding #venturestudio #innovation #machinelearning #ML"
