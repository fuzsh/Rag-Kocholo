It cut five days off of our old book closing time!\n\nFinance Manager\n\nStatewide Materials\n\nMy old month-end process was a nightmare. I was always chasing people down for receipts, and it took at least a week, if not more. I am thrilled about our new process! Since switching to Center, the time spent to close the books takes ONE DAY.\n\nFinance Director\n\nMuseum of Glass"
