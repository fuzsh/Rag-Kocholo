        "text": "The Media Sources pane on the left is the place where you access your local collection as well as other services: Local Music on top, which is the primary interface to your local collection and connected media such as mp3 players and CDs.\n\nThere is a section for all Internet Services that you have enabled. Here, you can browse listings of radio stations and podcasts; listen/subscribe to them, interact with your last.fm account, purchase music from online stores such as Magnatune and download independent artists' music from Jamendo and more.\n\nThe Playlists section allows you to create and manage Dynamic Playlists, access your Saved Playlists as well as the Automatic Playlist Generator.\n\nThe Files section displays an integrated file browser and the Podcasts section will let you access your podcast subscriptions. This is where all the information is displayed. The central pane contains applets that dynamically change to display context information about the track that is currently playing.\n\nYou can see the rating, score and play count of the Current Track applet or the last played tracks if nothing is playing, the Lyrics of the song and the Wikipedia page on the artist.\n\nMore applets can be added, removed or rearranged using the settings icon on the Applet Bar at the bottom of the pane. Amarok has the most configurable playlist of any music player in existence. It puts the power in your hands to shape the playlist any way you see fit.\n\nTo start you off, there are three pre-configured playlist layouts that you can use as starting points to create the layout that fits your flow the best. You can generate playlist dynamically with various bias or use the Automatic Playlist Generator, shuffle, play at random or repeat, queue tracks and save the existing playlists for later use. Amarok can support most popular formats for music files.\n\nThe actual list of formats depends on the codecs installed and the Phonon audio backend in use on your system.\n\nThere is also support for traditional playlists — you can create, save and load all the playlists you want. Amarok opens the gateway to a rich multimedia experience on the Internet.\n\nSporting interfaces to services such as Ampache music servers and mp3tunes lockers, it allows you to listen to your music from anywhere in the world.\n\nYou can sample and buy music from Magnatune.\n\nUsing the Jamendo service, you can listen to and download music from independent artists who can be supported by your donations.\n\nWith integrated last.fm functionality, you can scrobble your tracks, use last.fm features like statistics, charts and subscribers can listen to radio streams customized to your music taste — all from Amarok.\n\nDepending on your region, you may have access to the Amazon MP3 music store.\n\nAnd that is just the beginning — you can add even more Internet services using the Script Manager.\n\nYou can show your love for the songs by rating them. Amarok supports ½⋅✩ ratings, too. In addition, Amarok can calculate a score (a sort of guessed rating) depending on metrics such as how often you listen to or skip a song. This is an innovative interface that offers contextual options (such as the ones you see in a right-click menu) that you can \"drop\" a song into. Grab a track and see the Pop-Up Dropper appear in the context view pane! The currently loaded playlist is highly configurable and can show information about the songs in any form you like. If you are used to the Spreadsheet View found in Amarok 1.x series and other music players, you can have that, too! The Playlist View also allows you to save or export the current playlist."
