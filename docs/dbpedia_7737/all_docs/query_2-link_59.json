        "text": "I run Music Player Daemon on an old Apple Cube with a couple of big harddisks in software RAID1 with all my cd's in flac format.\n\nTo control the daemon I have hooked up mpc-commands to various F-keys in XEmacs on my desktop machine. Occationally I start the gmpc.\n\nI've written a very rudimentary iPod touch friendly web-frontend that uses mpc to get information and send commands.\n\nOh, and a simple commandline utility that transfers a music file to the jukebox and queues it for immediate play (i.e. for ad-hoc downloaded podcasts etc.)\n\nSo far I miss two things:\n\nRandom play of albums instead of tracks\n\nWhen putting a cd in, check if it already exists on the harddisk, if so, queue the album for immediate play and eject the cd. If not, transfer the cd to the harddisk and play it. (Basically combined \"play by inserting cd\"/\"rip inserted cd's\".\n\nHaven't gotten around to solving those two yet.\n\nWhen I'm not using Spotify (and on a Windows machine) I always use MediaMonkey to manage my music collection. It sports an impressive list of features (in my opinion of course). I really like the interface for looking up album art and the way you can specify alternative filename schemes when you sync with something.\n\nIt has so many awesome features and is also able to use Winamp plugins.\n\nFeatures from the MediaMonkey website:\n\nOrganize music and edit tags in your audio library with a powerful, intuitive interface.\n\nAutomatically lookup and tag Album Art and other metadata.\n\nManage 50,000+ files in your music collection without bogging down.\n\nManage all genres of audio: Rock, Classical, Audiobooks, Comedy, Podcasts, etc.\n\nPlay MP3s and other audio formats, and never again worry about varying volume.\n\nRecord CDs and convert MP3s, M4A, OGG, FLAC and WMA files etc. into other formats.\n\nCreate playlists and let Auto-DJ & Party Mode take care of your party.\n\nSync iPhones, iPods, & MP3 players, converting & leveling tracks on-the-fly.\n\nI finally switched to iTunes on windows when I got an iPhone a year or so ago. I don't know what took me so long: once you get it set up and running, it beats the pants off either Windows Media Player or Winamp. Better searching, playlist creation, cover art, you name it.\n\nAnd iTunes with the iPhone remote app is just killer.\n\nWindows: I use Windows/Vista Media Center most of the time, but Media Player to do CD ripping.\n\nOSX: I use iTunes.\n\nLinux: Rhythmbox.\n\nWhatever is default is fine. Other than installing iTunes for Windows so I can sync my iPhone on my HTPC, which also holds the media/music library, I don't install 3rd party software for music playback.\n\nI also use Last.fm instead of Pandora, because it just works better for me.\n\nI used to be a 'use whatever the default player is' type, but I have just discovered Quod Libet and I really like it. It's main mission in life is to make tag-oriented orgainzation of your music library a breeze. What it lacks in flashy UI, it makes up for in speed and search. It will expose tags in you music files you never knew you had, and let you perform regular expression searches on them.\n\nIt's GTK+ based and coded in Python, which means it can (possibly) run just about anywhere. This is the best cross-platform solution I have found yet. Finally! I have a player I enjoy on both linux & windows."
