        "text": "The amaroK team would like to announce the immediate release of version 1.3 of the innovative amaroK Live CD. This complete operating system is a unique collaboration between Free Software and Open Music that runs entirely from a single CD. The live CD comes with a fully functional copy of the amaroK music player bundled with tracks from Magnatune, the German artists Paniq & Snooze and the Norwegian performer Ugress.\n\namaroK Live 1.3\n\nBased upon the KDE-centric PCLinuxOS, amaroK Live is not a complete Live CD distribution as much as it is a demonstration of an extremely cool audio player. This combination reinforces the concept that amaroK Live 1.3 is the perfect collaboration between Free Software and Free Music (free as in freedom). Music selections on the CD span many genres, from Electronica to Rock, Jazz and Classical.\n\nThe tracks contributed by Magnatune are graciously licensed to us under the attribution/non-commercial/share-alike (by-nc-sa) version of the Creative Commons license, so these specific music tracks are both free in the sense of freedom and free in the sense of no cost. Magnatune is a revolutionary concept founded in 2003 as an independent, online record label that hand selects its own artists, sells its catalogue of music through online downloads and print-on-demand CDs and licenses music for commercial and non-commercial use.\n\nThe other tracks found on the CD can also be legally shared for non-commercial purposes.\n\nScreenshots of amaroK Live 1.3 can be found on the amaroK Live website.\n\nAbout Magnatune:\n\nFounded in 2003, Magnatune is an independent, online record label that hand selects its own artists, sells its catalogue of music through online downloads and print-on-demand CDs and also licenses music for commercial and non-commercial use.\n\nBased on the principle that \"We are not evil,\" the company offers fair-trade music to consumers by equally sharing all revenue from the sale of albums with artists and allowing artists to retain full rights to their music. All music can be previewed free of charge with a \"try before you buy\" philosophy. Customers can also choose how much they want to pay for the music with pricing ranging from $5-18 for a downloadable album or print-on-demand CD.\n\nAbout amaroK:\n\namaroK is a music player for KDE with an intuitive interface. amaroK makes playing the music you love easier than ever before - and looks good doing it. It is Free Software, licensed under the GNU General Public License and is available for most GNU/Linux distributions.\n\nSince amaroK can use many different engines to decode and output, it can be used in just about any desktop environment. Xine is the default engine, but Arts, GStreamer and Real/HelixPlayer are all options, including the Network Multimedia framework (NMM)."
