Nearly any open source program you use that can play a sequence of video images accompanied by sound is probably using FFmpeg to do so. It can decode the most prominent multimedia formats ever created, whether open or proprietary, and can encode to the most important formats as well. As a novelty, FFmpeg can also decode a vast array of impossibly obscure multimedia formats and remains essential for legacy multimedia files (no codec is too old or obscure for this project). Anecdotally, FFmpeg just might be the leading multimedia processing library in existence, as many proprietary applications use it as well (as permitted by the LGPL license). There are many stealth uses as well. YouTube does not advertise how their backend conversion software operates. However, independent, empirical research has demonstrated that YouTube uses FFmpeg to convert videos.\n\nProjects\n\nAMR decoder and encoder\n\nby Robert Henry Winston Swain, mentored by Benjamin Larsson\n\nVC-1\n\nby Kostyantin Sergiyovich Shishkov, mentored by Michael Melanson\n\nEAC3 Decoder\n\nby Kartikey M BHatt, mentored by Benjamin Larsson\n\nThe FreeBSD Project\n\nHomepage: http://www.FreeBSD.org\n\nPreferred License: New BSD license\n\nThe FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly nit organization. The FreeBSD Project began 15 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work at Berkeley CSRG with open source revision history going back 30 years to 1978. There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce servers for experimental and third party development (this is also where our summer of code students have worked in previous years). We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, blogs, irc channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary, and allows students to build up and package complete modified FreeBSD operating system CDs/DVDs to distribute as ISOs for testing, for example. Relevance to Google : Google has many tens of thousands of FreeBSD-based devices helping to run its production networks (Juniper, Force10, NetApp, etc..), MacOS X laptops, and the occasional FreeBSD network monitoring or test server. Research in FreeBSD security, networking, and other areas has also regularly been adopted recently and throughout its 30 year history to other open source systems. The most recent example from this month is perhaps the JEMalloc allocator which was introduced in FreeBSD 2 years ago and has recently been imported into the Firefox browser, also widely used at Google. This is an exciting time for FreeBSD as Cisco, Juniper, NetApp, Force10, and many other embedded networking device companies are moving towards FreeBSD (Cisco) or upgrading to more modern FreeBSD releases (6.0/7.0 for all the rest). We are also seeing these companies hire open source liaisons and making a concerted effort to contribute more code back.\n\nProjects\n\nIPv6 stack vulnerabilities.\n\nby Clement Lecigne, mentored by George Neville-Neil\n\nNss-LDAP importing and nsswitch subsystem improvement\n\nby Michael Bushkov, mentored by Hajimu UMEMOTO\n\nIntegrated SNMP monitoring\n\nby Shteryana Sotirova Shopova, mentored by Bjoern Alexander Zeeb\n\nImproving FreeBSD Ports Collection\n\nby Gábor Kövesdán, mentored by Erwin Lansing\n\nIntegrate Xen Support to FreeBSD\n\nby Yuan, Jue, mentored by Kip Macy\n\nK - The Kernel meta-language\n\nby Spencer Whitman, mentored by Poul-Henning Kamp\n\nStudy, analyze and improve the interrupt handling infrastructure in FreeBSD\n\nby Paolo Pisati, mentored by John Baldwin\n\nSyncing with the 4Front Technologies OSS v4 API\n\nby Ryan Beasley, mentored by Alexander Leidinger\n\nBundled PXE Installer\n\nby Markus Boelter, mentored by Paul Saab\n\nFreeBSD GEOM Storage Virtualisation Layer (gvirstor)\n\nby Ivan Voras, mentored by Pawel Jakub Dawidek\n\nJail Resource Limits etc.\n\nby Christopher Jones, mentored by Kip Macy\n\nby Dongmei Liu, mentored by Christian S.J.

At over ten years old, its history merges itself with the development of a Free Desktop Environment, having first provided the basis for projects such as gtk+, gutemprint and other graphic programs. It is a free program distributed under the GPLv2 suitable for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring. It is usually pre-installed in all major Desktop GNU/Linux distributions and available in other Platforms such as Microsoft's Windows. GIMP is a Free Software, high-end photo manipulation application that supports creating original art from images; a high-end application for producing icons, graphical elements of web pages and art for user interface elements and also works as a platform for programming cutting-edge image processing algorithms, by scientists and artists. With the advent and spreading of digital pictures and imagery, being able to edit and change photos in a computer became a major task on the daily usage of personal computers. Everyone having at home tools far more powerful than those available to professional photographers for decades. Most pictures hardware do offer a gratis program with basic picture manipulation facilities - but one of the main purposes of Free Software is exactly to end the artificial restrictions of features and capabilities of any software. Therefore, GIMP provides a fully featured image manipulation environment available for everyone, and we have a goal of making it each time richer. Currently, GIMP is undergoing a deep change in its rendering core, which is being replaced by the Generic Graphics Library - GEGL. GEGL while being developed by members of the GIMP team and community and is also a modular and independent graph based image processing framework, with bindings to other languages. It aims to provide GIMP with a lot of currently missing high-end features such as non-destructive editing, deep color depth support, HDR, and macro recording.\n\nProjects\n\nRuby-Gimp scripting.\n\nby Scott Lembcke, mentored by Kevin Cozens\n\nNew/Extended Brush System\n\nby Philip Lafleur, mentored by Sven Neumann\n\nProposal for wavelets-based imaging applications in GIMP\n\nby Divyanshu Vats, mentored by Simon Budig\n\nProposal for implementing vector layers in the GIMP\n\nby Hendrik Boom, mentored by Simon Budig\n\nVanishing point cloning\n\nby Pedro Alonso, mentored by Manish Singh\n\nHealing Brush\n\nby Kevin Sookocheff, mentored by Manish Singh\n\nProject Looking Glass\n\nHomepage: https://java.net/projects/lg3d-core/\n\nPreferred License: GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nProject Looking Glass is based on Java technology and explores bringing a richer user experience to the desktop and applications via 3D windowing and visualization capabilities.

We develop a lot of different kinds of open source project: everything from the world's most advanced low-cost amateur rockets and law-enforcement communication systems to web toolkits and programming environments. We specialize in open source projects with an academic component, and those that are off the beaten path. We think we've been an academic leader in the R&D side of free and open source software. For example, the components of the X Window System developed by PSU students, faculty and friends touch users of the free desktop every day. Our location in Portland, Oregon gives us access to a large pool of top-quality open source developers, and they have been very good to us in helping to mentor our students. For Summer of Code, we are looking for developers in Portland and from around the globe who are excited about an open source project that has an academic bent, or that doesn't fit well with any other Summer of Code organization.\n\nProjects\n\nSpace Programming\n\nby Dawn Thomas, mentored by Kristen Carlson Accardi\n\nModular Javascript User Interface Components and a Web of Portable Data\n\nby Eric Hanson, mentored by Barton Christopher Massey\n\nA Threaded Network Monitoring System Architecture\n\nby shane matthews, mentored by Jim Binkley\n\nRuby Central\n\nHomepage: http://rubycentral.org/\n\nPreferred License: Apache License, 2.0\n\nRuby Central organizes national and international Ruby related activities.

Unlike most other build tools that invent their own mini-language or wedge a scripting language onto some other configuration file syntax, SCons configuration files are actually Python scripts. The flexibility of Python scripting makes it possible to solve complicated build problems in surprisingly small amounts of maintainable code. Its portability (the only requirement is Python 1.5.2 or later), cross-platform features (extensive support for languages and compilers), and reliability (MD5 file signatures, cache) make it an incomparable tool not only for build masters but also for many free software projects. SCons has been an active project since its founding in 2001. SCons now averages about 7000 downloads per month and has active user and development mailing lists with membership of approximately 450 and 150, respectively, and average monthly traffic of 275 and 100 messages, respectively. The SCons Foundation was organized in 2003 to hold the copyrights of the SCons source code, and to provide a legal entity for any other organizational necessities (e.g., receiving donations). The Foundation is a Delaware non-profit corporation, but does not currently have 501(c)(3) status.\n\nProjects\n\nPackaging and Dependency Management for SCons\n\nby Philipp Scholl, mentored by Stefan Seefeld\n\nThe Shmoo Group\n\nHomepage: http://www.shmoo.com/\n\nPreferred License: New BSD license\n\nThe Shmoo Group is a not-for profit group of security, crypto, and privacy professionals.\n\nProjects\n\nGPGreasemonkey\n\nby Kerry McKay, mentored by Bruce Potter\n\nSOC application for Online access to Rainbowtables\n\nby Keith Larrimore, mentored by Michael Gady\n\nFirekeeper - browser level Intrusion Detection System\n\nby Jan Wrobel, mentored by Len Sassaman\n\nby Sören Bleikertz, mentored by Pravir Chandra\n\nopenSUSE\n\nHomepage: http://www.opensuse.org/\n\nPreferred License: Apache License, 2.0\n\nopenSUSE is a community distribution sponsored by Novell to promote the use of Linux everywhere. openSUSE delivers everything that Linux developers and enthusiasts need to get started with Linux.

We are focusing on delivering to our users quality open source software with a strong emphasis on ease of use. We are mainly maintaining WinLibre (open source software distribution for windows) and MacLibre (open source software distribution for Mac OS X). The Winlibre distribution provides a collection of first-class open-source software bundled in a easy single installer & updater. Through time and thanks to the former editions of the Google Summer Of Code, the Winlibre project has evolved and created other sub-projects to fill gaps in the open-source desktop software offering.

Xen is supported in OpenSolaris, and supports fully virtualized OSes (Windows, legacy Linux) using Intel(r) VT and AMD(r)-V hardware virtualization technologies. The XenSource GSC projects will develop components for the OSS Xen hypervisor, which will (subject to open source acceptance) be added to the Xen code base. Xen is undeniably the hottest open source project right now, and we are somewhat swamped by high quality candidates.
