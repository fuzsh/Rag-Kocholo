It also counts 0011 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence 0012 the version number 2.1.] 0013 0014 Preamble 0015 0016 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your 0017 freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public 0018 Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 0019 free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. 0020 0021 This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some 0022 specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the 0023 Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You 0024 can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether 0025 this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better 0026 strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations 0027 below. 0028 0029 When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, 0030 not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that 0031 you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 0032 for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get 0033 it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of 0034 it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do 0035 these things. 0036 0037 To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid 0038 distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these 0039 rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for 0040 you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it. 0041 0042 For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis 0043 or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave 0044 you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source 0045 code. If you link other code with the library, you must provide 0046 complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them 0047 with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling 0048 it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 0049 0050 We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the 0051 library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal 0052 permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. 0053 0054 To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that 0055 there is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is 0056 modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know 0057 that what they have is not the original version, so that the original 0058 author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be 0059 introduced by others. 0060 0061 Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of 0062 any free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot 0063 effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a 0064 restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that 0065 any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be 0066 consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license. 0067 0068 Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the 0069 ordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser 0070 General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and 0071 is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use 0072 this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those 0073 libraries into non-free programs. 0074 0075 When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using 0076 a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a 0077 combined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary 0078 General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the 0079 entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General 0080 Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with 0081 the library. 0082 0083 We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it 0084 does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General 0085 Public License. It also provides other free software developers Less 0086 of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages 0087 are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many 0088 libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain 0089 special circumstances. 0090 0091 For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to 0092 encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it 0093 becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must 0094 be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free 0095 library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this 0096 case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free 0097 software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. 0098 0099 In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free 0100 programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of 0101 free software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in 0102 non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU 0103 operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating 0104 system. 0105 0106 Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the 0107 users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is 0108 linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run 0109 that program using a modified version of the Library. 0110 0111 The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 0112 modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a 0113 \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The 0114 former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must 0115 be combined with the library in order to run. 0116 0117 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE 0118 TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0119 0120 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other 0121 program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or 0122 other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of 0123 this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). 0124 Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". 0125 0126 A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data 0127 prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs 0128 (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. 0129 0130 The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work 0131 which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the 0132 Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under 0133 copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a 0134 portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated 0135 straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is 0136 included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) 0137 0138 \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for 0139 making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means 0140 all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated 0141 interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 0142 compilation and installation of the library. 0143 0144 Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 0145 covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of 0146 running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from 0147 such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based 0148 on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for 0149 writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does 0150 and what the program that uses the Library does. 0151 0152 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's 0153 complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that 0154 you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an 0155 appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact 0156 all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 0157 warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the 0158 Library. 0159 0160 You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, 0161 and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a 0162 fee. 0163 0164 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion 0165 of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and 0166 distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 0167 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: 0168 0169 a) The modified work must itself be a software library. 0170 0171 b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices 0172 stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. 0173 0174 c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no 0175 charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. 0176 0177 d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a 0178 table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses 0179 the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility 0180 is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, 0181 in the event an application does not supply such function or 0182 table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of 0183 its purpose remains meaningful. 0184 0185 (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has 0186 a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the 0187 application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any 0188 application-supplied function or table used by this function must 0189 be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square 0190 root function must still compute square roots.) 0191 0192 These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 0193 identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, 0194 and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 0195 themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 0196 sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 0197 distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based 0198 on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 0199 this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the 0200 entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote 0201 it. 0202 0203 Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 0204 your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 0205 exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 0206 collective works based on the Library. 0207 0208 In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library 0209 with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of 0210 a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under 0211 the scope of this License. 0212 0213 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public 0214 License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do 0215 this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so 0216 that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, 0217 instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the 0218 ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify 0219 that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in 0220 these notices. 0221 0222 Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for 0223 that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all 0224 subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. 0225 0226 This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of 0227 the Library into a program that is not a library. 0228 0229 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or 0230 derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form 0231 under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany 0232 it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which 0233 must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 0234 medium customarily used for software interchange. 0235 0236 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy 0237 from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the 0238 source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to 0239 distribute the source code, even though third parties are not 0240 compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 0241 0242 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the 0243 Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or 0244 linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a 0245 work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and 0246 therefore falls outside the scope of this License. 0247 0248 However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library 0249 creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it 0250 contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the 0251 library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. 0252 Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. 0253 0254 When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file 0255 that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a 0256 derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 0257 Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be 0258 linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The 0259 threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. 0260 0261 If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data 0262 structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline 0263 functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object 0264 file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative 0265 work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the 0266 Library will still fall under Section 6.) 0267 0268 Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may 0269 distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 0270 Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, 0271 whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 0272 0273 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or 0274 link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a 0275 work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work 0276 under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit 0277 modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse 0278 engineering for debugging such modifications. 0279 0280 You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the 0281 Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by 0282 this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work 0283 during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the 0284 copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference 0285 directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one 0286 of these things: 0287 0288 a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding 0289 machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever 0290 changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under 0291 Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked 0292 with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that 0293 uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the 0294 user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified 0295 executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood 0296 that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the 0297 Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application 0298 to use the modified definitions.) 0299 0300 b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the 0301 Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a 0302 copy of the library already present on the user's computer system, 0303 rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2) 0304 will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if 0305 the user installs one, as long as the modified version is 0306 interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. 0307 0308 c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least 0309 three years, to give the same user the materials specified in 0310 Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of 0311 performing this distribution. 0312 0313 d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy 0314 from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above 0315 specified materials from the same place. 0316 0317 e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these 0318 materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. 0319 0320 For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the 0321 Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for 0322 reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, 0323 the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is 0324 normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 0325 components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 0326 which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies 0327 the executable. 0328 0329 It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license 0330 restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally 0331 accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot 0332 use both them and the Library together in an executable that you 0333 distribute. 0334 0335 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the 0336 Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library 0337 facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined 0338 library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on 0339 the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise 0340 permitted, and provided that you do these two things: 0341 0342 a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work 0343 based on the Library, uncombined with any other library 0344 facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the 0345 Sections above. 0346 0347 b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact 0348 that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining 0349 where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 0350 0351 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute 0352 the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any 0353 attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or 0354 distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your 0355 rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, 0356 or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 0357 terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 0358 0359 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 0360 signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 0361 distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are 0362 prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 0363 modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the 0364 Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and 0365 all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying 0366 the Library or works based on it. 0367 0368 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the 0369 Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 0370 original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library 0371 subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further 0372 restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 0373 You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with 0374 this License. 0375 0376 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 0377 infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 0378 conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 0379 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 0380 excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot 0381 distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this 0382 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you 0383 may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent 0384 license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by 0385 all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then 0386 the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to 0387 refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. 0388 0389 If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under 0390 any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to 0391 apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other 0392 circumstances. 0393 0394 It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 0395 patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 0396 such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 0397 integrity of the free software distribution system which is 0398 implemented by public license practices. Many people have made 0399 generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 0400 through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 0401 system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 0402 to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 0403 impose that choice. 0404 0405 This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to 0406 be a consequence of the rest of this License. 0407 0408 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in 0409 certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 0410 original copyright holder who places the Library under this License 0411 may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 0412 countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among 0413 countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates 0414 the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 0415 0416 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new 0417 versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 0418 Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, 0419 but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. 0420 0421 Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library 0422 specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and 0423 \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and 0424 conditions either of that version or of any later version published by 0425 the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a 0426 license version number, you may choose any version ever published by 0427 the Free Software Foundation. 0428 0429 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free 0430 programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, 0431 write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is 0432 copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free 0433 Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our 0434 decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status 0435 of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing 0436 and reuse of software generally. 0437 0438 NO WARRANTY 0439 0440 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO 0441 WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 0442 EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR 0443 OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY 0444 KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 0445 IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 0446 PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 0447 LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME 0448 THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 0449 0450 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN 0451 WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY 0452 AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU 0453 FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR 0454 CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE 0455 LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 0456 RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A 0457 FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF 0458 SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH 0459 DAMAGES. 0460 0461 END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS 0462 0463 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries 0464 0465 If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest 0466 possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that 0467 everyone can redistribute and change.
