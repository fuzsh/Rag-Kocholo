        "text": "I finally pulled the trigger and bought a librem5. I got the phone today and the first thing I did was update the software via the update mechanism in the settings-about-software updates. The software updated and ask that I reboot which I did. Once the software was updated, I went into the puri store to look at the available apps but there does not seem to be any apps. The is one app under developer (playhouse) and then all the other categories are boxes with three dots in them. There are a few apps on the main page but nothing in any of the categories (create, work, play, socialize, learn, and develop). Anyone else having this issue?\n\nWelcome to the crowd of Librem 5 owners, @jmtk! Thanks for your questions and remarks. I think these are very valuable to get insight in the first experience of new Librem 5 users.\n\nI noticed that the PureOS (GNOME Software) app also hangs sometimes. I believe that the behavior will be way better in future versions.\n\nYou can use the apt command line tool to install all kind of extra applications.\n\nAnd you can also install flatpaks from Flathub. Note that you first have to do some setup to be able to use Flathub.\n\nSee also: Tips & Tricks · Wiki · Librem5 / Librem 5 Community Wiki · GitLab\n\nI think that, by default, the store only shows apps that have been officially made adaptable to the mobile screen.You can enable “Show Incompatible Applications” in the store Preferences to list more… some of which may actually have been built to adapt to screen size by the app developers, although not “officially” by Purism.\n\nYou can also search for any app in the PureOS repository (which includes not just mobile-adaptive apps) by using the magnifying glass/search function in the store. Some of those might work on the L5 with some slight adjustment to scale. It can be hit or miss, but I’ve found quite a few usable apps there. Some of them are demonstrated in this thread: List of Apps that fit and function well [Post them here.]\n\nP.S. If flathub is installed, you will also see flatpaks when using the search function in the store."
