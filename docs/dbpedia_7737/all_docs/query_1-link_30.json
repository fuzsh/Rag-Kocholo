Full text search applications let you find your data by content rather than by external attributes (like a file name). More specifically, they will let you specify words (terms) that should or should not appear in the text you are looking for, and return a list of matching documents, ordered so that the most relevant documents will appear first.\n\nYou do not need to remember in what file or email message you stored a given piece of information. You just ask for related terms, and Recoll will return a list of documents where those terms are prominent, in a similar way to Internet search engines.\n\nRecoll uses the Xapian information retrieval library as its storage and retrieval engine.

It cuts FLV files and adds cue Points (onCuePoint). A debug command shows the inside of a FLV file and the print command gives meta data information in XML or YAML format.\n\nWhat is CuePoint:\n\nA cue point is a point at which the video player dispatches a cuePoint event while a video file plays. You can add cue points to an FLV file at times that you want an action to occur for another element on the web page. Cue points allow you to receive control in your ActionScript code to synchronize points in your FLV file with other actions on the web page.\n\nFLVTool2 Features\n\n* Batch processing\n\n* Directory recursion\n\n* Command chaining\n\n* FLV files cutting\n\n* onCuePoint tag insertation via XML file\n\n* Custom onMetaData key-value pairs\n\n* Meta data printout in XML or YAML\n\n* Simulation mode\n\n* Runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX\n\n* Ideal for serverside automatic meta data injection\n\nRead more\n\nMetadata Injector for FLV Video Files - Flvmeta\n\nThe information that composes an FLV file is the data, and the metadata is information about that video. The length of the video (duration), the number of frames per second that the video displays (frame rate), and the number of kilobytes of data transferred per second when the video plays (video and audio data rates, where applicable) are all examples of video metadata. Additionally, the codec used to encode the video is also available.\n\nImportance of FLV Metadata\n\nMost FLV players read the metadata first to know the duration of the video file. After that it initializes or synchronizes the video file with its timeline or seekbar. If there is no metadata the seekbar will not progress with the video. Secondly, for more intelligent FLV players that serve the video or rather buffer the video dynamically, depending on the user’s internet speed, the FLV players read the FLV video bitrate from the FLV metadata and then sets the buffer accordingly.\n\nRead more\n\nShares Files Using HTTP Protocol - Qweborf\n\nTransferring files from one computer to another on a network isn't always a straightforward task.

It can enable writing on the server, webdav and authentication.\n\nQweborf Installation:\n\nOpen the terminal and type following command to install Qweborf:\n\nsudo apt-get install qweborf\n\nRead more\n\nMultiple GNOME Terminals in one Window - Terminator\n\nTerminator, multiple terminals in one window. The goal of this project is to produce a useful tool for arranging terminals. It is inspired by programs such as gnome-multi-term, quadkonsole, etc. in that the main focus is arranging terminals in grids (tabs is the most common default method, which Terminator also supports).\n\nTerminator gives the possibility of having multiples terminal within the same window. As such, it makes it easier to handle multiple terminal sessions as for instance, working in one console and monitoring another one without constantly switching from a window to another.\n\nTerminator Features:\n\n* Arrange terminals in a grid\n\n* Tabs\n\n* Drag and drop re-ordering of terminals\n\n* Lots of keyboard shortcuts\n\n* Save multiple layouts and profiles via GUI preferences editor\n\n* Simultaneous typing to arbitrary groups of terminals\n\nRead more\n\nSecure Proxy to Surf the Web Anonymously on Linux - Anon-Proxy\n\nAnon-Proxy contains the JAP client which acts as a local proxy between your browser and the insecure Internet. All requests for web pages are handled by JAP and are encrypted several times. The encrypted messages are sent through a chain of intermediate servers (named Mixes) to the final destination on the Internet.\n\nMultiple layers of encryption protect all messages. A Mix collects messages in a batch, totally changes their appearance (removes one layer of encryption) and forwards them all at the same time, but in a different order. An adversary may observe all communication links, however he cannot determine a relation between incoming and outgoing packets. A surfer remains anonymous within the group of all users of the service.\n\nDemonstrably, the Anon-Proxy protects your privacy as long as the Mix works correctly. Each message passes through several Mixes and the entire chain of Mixes has to be corrupt to successfully observe the user's activities. The chaining effectively prevents single Mixes from observing. This is the meaning of strong anonymity: Even the anonymity service itself cannot spy on its users.\n\nRead more\n\nBlock Brute-Force Attempts on Ubuntu Linux - Fail2Ban\n\nFail2ban operates by blocking selected IP addresses that may belong to hosts that are trying to breach the system's security. It determines the hosts to be blocked by monitoring log files (e.g. /var/log/pwdfail, /var/log/auth.log, etc.) and bans any host IP that makes too many login attempts or performs any other unwanted action within a time frame defined by the administrator.\n\nFail2ban is typically set up to unban a blocked host within a certain period, so as to not \"lock out\" any genuine connections that may have been temporarily misconfigured. However, an unban time of several minutes is usually enough to stop a network connection being flooded by malicious connections, as well as reducing the likelihood of a successful dictionary attack.\n\nFail2ban can perform multiple actions whenever an abusive IP is detected: update Netfilter/iptables firewall rules, or alternatively TCP Wrapper's hosts.deny table, to reject an abuser's IP address; email notifications; or any user-defined action that can be carried out by a Python script. The standard configuration ships with filters for Apache, Lighttpd, sshd, vsftpd, qmail, Postfix and Courier Mail Server.\n\nRead more\n\nHardening Ubuntu Linux using Bastille Linux\n\nThe Bastille Hardening program \"locks down\" an operating system, proactively configuring the system for increased security and decreasing its susceptibility to compromise. Bastille can also assess a system's current state of hardening, granular reporting on each of the security settings with which it works.\n\nBastille currently supports the Red Hat (Fedora Core, Enterprise, and Numbered/Classic), SUSE, Debian, Gentoo, and Mandrake distributions, along with HP-UX. Bastille's focuses on letting the system's user/administrator choose exactly how to harden the operating system. In its default hardening mode, it interactively asks the user questions, explains the topics of those questions, and builds a policy based on the user's answers. It then applies the policy to the system. In its assessment mode, it builds a report intended to teach the user about available security settings as well as inform the user as to which settings have been tightened.\n\nRead more\n\nHow to Change the Network MAC Address on Ubuntu Linux - macchanger\n\nA Media Access Control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces for communications on the physical network segment. MAC addresses are used for numerous network technologies. Logically, MAC addresses are used in the Media Access Control protocol sub-layer of the OSI reference model.\n\nMAC addresses are most often assigned by the manufacturer of a network interface card (NIC) and are stored in its hardware, the card's read-only memory, or some other firmware mechanism. If assigned by the manufacturer, a MAC address usually encodes the manufacturer's registered identification number and may be referred to as the burned-in address. It may also be known as an Ethernet hardware address (EHA), hardware address or physical address. A network node may have multiple NICs and will then have one unique MAC address per NIC.\n\nMACChanger is a GNU/Linux utility for viewing/manipulating the MAC addresses of network interfaces. It can set specific, random, vendor-based (with a 6600+ vendor list), and device-type-based MACs.\n\nRead more\n\nA Fast Web Server Log Analyzer - Visitors\n\nVisitors is a very fast web log analyzer for Linux, Windows, and other Unix-like operating systems.

Unlike cross-site scripting vulnerabilities that are ultimately directed at your site’s visitors, SQL injection is an attack on the site itself—in particular its database. The goal of SQL injection is to insert arbitrary data, most often a database query, into a string that’s eventually executed by the database. The insidious query may attempt any number of actions, from retrieving alternate data, to modifying or removing information from the database.\n\nTheMole is an automatic SQL Injection exploitation tool. Only by providing a vulnerable URL and a valid string on the site it can detect the injection and exploit it, either by using the union technique or a boolean query based technique.\n\nTheMole Features\n\n* Support for injections using Mysql, SQL Server, Postgres and Oracle databases.\n\n* Command line interface. Different commands trigger different actions.\n\n* Auto-completion for commands, command arguments and database, table and columns names.\n\n* Support for query filters, in order to bypass certain IPS/IDS rules using generic filters, and the possibility of creating new ones easily.\n\n* Developed in python 3.\n\nRead more\n\nBasic Ubuntu System Security Checks - CheckSecurity\n\nThe checksecurity command runs a small collection of simple system checks which are designed to catch a few common security issues.\n\nThe checksecurity command scans the mounted files systems (subject to the filter defined in /etc/checksecurity.conf) and compares the list of setuid programs to the list created on the previous run. Any changes are printed to standard output. Also, it generates a list of nfs and afs filesystems that are mounted insecurely (i.e. they are missing the nodev and either the noexec or nosuid flags).\n\nchecksecurity is run by cron on a daily basis, and the output stored in /var/log/setuid/setuid.changes.\n\nChecksecurity Installation:\n\nUnder Ubuntu Linux, open the terminal and type following command to install checksecurity:\n\nsudo apt-get install checksecurity\n\nRead more\n\nGUI Tool to build Firewall on Ubuntu Linux - Firestarter\n\nFirestarter is a firewall tool for Linux, and uses GNOME.

If no arguments or just -p is given, ionice will query the current io scheduling class and priority for that process.\n\nA process can be in one of three scheduling classes:\n\nIdle\n\nA program running with idle io priority will only get disk time when no other program has asked for disk io for a defined grace period. The impact of idle io processes on normal system activity should be zero. This scheduling class does not take a priority argument. This scheduling class is permitted for an ordinary user (since kernel 2.6.25).\n\nBest effort\n\nThis is the effective scheduling class for any process that has not asked for a specific io priority. This class takes a priority argument from 0-7, with lower number being higher priority. Programs running at the same best effort priority are served in a round-robin fashion.\n\nRead more\n\nReplicate the Installed Application Across Different Computers - OneConf\n\nOneConf enables you to save and replicate some data in between all your computers like the list of installed applications and some settings.

Its primary aim is to provide a safe way to store passwords in a file on disk while having a small footprint, and compiling and running under today's most popular Unix Systems.\n\nYAPET does not impose a limit of password records per file and the number of files the passwords are stored in, although YAPET is only able to display password records of one file at a time. For convenience, YAPET provides a search function for password records of the currently displayed password file.\n\nThe password records are protected by a master password. The master password is used to encrypt and decrypt the password records.\n\nYAPET relies on OpenSSL for encrypting and decrypting password records. The cipher for encryption and decryption is Blowfish with a 448 bits key.\n\nRead more\n\nopenSUSE 12.1 Released\n\nopenSUSE 12.1\n\nThis release represents more than eight months of work by international community.\n\nAwesome improvements include the latest GNOME 3.2 desktop as well as the newest from KDE, XFCE and LXDE; your ownCloud made easy with mirall; Snapper-shots of your file system; and much, much more.\n\nDesktops:\n\nopenSUSE 12.1 comes with the new GNOME Shell 3.2.\n\nNotifications are much nicer, you can now configure your online accounts in one place and Shell handles multiple-screen setups better.\n\nAmong the features is color management, something GNOME shares with KDE where openSUSE is the first to integrate the Oyranos color management system.

Reports include:\n\n* General Statistics, bandwidth etc.\n\n* Top Visitors\n\n* Requested files\n\n* Requested static files, images, swf, js, etc.\n\n* Referrers URLs\n\n* 404 or Not Found\n\n* Operating Systems\n\n* Browsers and Spiders\n\n* Hosts, Reverse DNS, IP Location\n\n* HTTP Status Codes\n\n* Referring Sites\n\n* Keyphrases\n\n* Different Color Schemes\n\n* Unlimited log file size\n\nRead more\n\nMultimedia (MP3, MPEG-4, AVI, DiVX, etc.) support in Ubuntu 11.10 (Oneiric Ocelot)\n\nWhy doesn’t Ubuntu support MP3 ‘out of the box’?\n\nUbuntu cannot include support for MP3 or DVD video playback or recording. MP3 formats are patented, and the patent holders have not provided the necessary licenses. Ubuntu also excludes other multimedia software due to patent, copyright, or license restrictions, such as Adobe Flash Player and RealNetworks RealPlayer.\n\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t play .mp3 files in Ubuntu , it just takes a bit of work (not much).\n\nFollow these instructions to get mp3 and other multimedia support on your Ubuntu 11.10.\n\nRead more\n\nTool for Detecting Memory Management Problems in Programs - Valgrind\n\nValgrind is a powerful tool for detecting memory management problems in programs. The kinds of problems it can detect are often very difficult to find by other means and often cause difficult to diagnose crashes. Valgrind can be used with existing executables without recompiling or relinking, although the output it produces will be much more useful if you have compiled with the -g flag.\n\nValgrind Capabilities\n\nValgrind is basically an x86 emulator that checks all reads and writes of memory, intercepts all calls to allocate and deallocate memory. The memcheck tool of valgrind (which is the main tool and the only one covered in this chapter) can detect the following:\n\n* Use of uninitialized memory\n\n* Reading/writing memory after it has been free'd\n\n* Reading/writing off the end of malloc'd blocks\n\n* Reading/writing inappropriate areas below the stack.\n\n* Memory leaks\n\n* Mismatched use of malloc/new/new[] vs free/delete/delete[]\n\n* Overlapping src and dst pointers in memcpy() and related functions\n\n* Doubly freed memory\n\n* Passing unaddressable bytes to a system call\n\nRead more\n\nGraphical CD/DVD Image (ISO file) Editor - ISO Master\n\nISO Master is an easy to use GUI CD image editor for Linux, BSD, and Windows. Basically, you can use this program to extract files from an ISO, add files to an ISO, and create bootable ISOs, all in a graphical user interface.\n\nISO Master can open both ISO and NRG files, but can only save as ISO. It is based on bkisofs, a library for reading, modifying, and writing ISO images.\n\nISO Master features:\n\n* Display file/directory contents of the image and filesystem in two panels and be able to navigate them.\n\n* Display file sizes for files on image/filesystem.\n\n* Sort by name or by size\n\n* Select any number of items in the file browsers.\n\n* Extract selected from image to the filesystem\n\n* Delete selected from image.\n\nRead more\n\nWindows FAT16 / FAT32 FileSystem Resizer - Fatresize\n\nFatresize is a command line tool for non-destructive resizing of MS Windows FAT16 / FAT32 file systems.

If omitted, mkdosfs automatically determines the file system size.\n\nRead more\n\nHow To Setup Streaming Music Server - Zeya\n\nZeya is a lightweight music streamer. It's written in Python and Javascript which means it does not require as much resources as Java based streamers would need. Zeya uses about 10-20MB ram idle. When there is music streamed from the server to you there is a trans-coding process which uses also a tad of ram, but don't expect it to hit above the 80MB ram.\n\nTo play music from your server you need a browser which supports HTML5. The browsers which are known to work with Zeya are:\n\n* Mozilla Firefox 3.5 or later\n\n* Google Chrome or Chromium\n\n* Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8 on Windows with the Google Chrome Frame plugin\n\nThe client runs in any browser that supports a certain subset of the HTML 5 technologies— no Flash needed. No Silverlight, no applets, no plugins, no external players.\n\nRead more\n\nHTML Syntax Checker and Reformatter - Tidy\n\nWhen editing HTML it's easy to make mistakes. Wouldn't it be nice if there was a simple way to fix these mistakes automatically and tidy up sloppy editing into nicely layed out markup? Well now there is! Dave Raggett's HTML TIDY is a free utility for doing just that. It also works great on the atrociously hard to read markup generated by specialized HTML editors and conversion tools, and can help you identify where you need to pay further attention on making your pages more accessible to people with disabilities.\n\nTidy is able to fix up a wide range of problems and to bring to your attention things that you need to work on yourself. Each item found is listed with the line number and column so that you can see where the problem lies in your markup. Tidy won't generate a cleaned up version when there are problems that it can't be sure of how to handle. These are logged as \"errors\" rather than \"warnings\".\n\nRead more\n\nLarge-Scale File Distribution Application - Zsync\n\nZsync is a file transfer program. It allows you to download a file from a remote server, where you have a copy of an older version of the file on your computer already. zsync downloads only the new parts of the file. It uses the same algorithm as rsync. However, where rsync is designed for synchronizing data from one computer to another within an organization, zsync is designed for file distribution, with one file on a server to be distributed to thousands of down-loaders. zsync requires no special server software just a web server to host the files and imposes no extra load on the server, making it ideal for large scale file distribution.\n\nAdvantages of zsync\n\nzsync fills a gap in the technology available for large-scale file distribution. Three key points explain why zsync provides a genuinely new technique for file distribution:\n\n* Client-side rsync: zsync uses the rsync algorithm, but runs it on the client side, thus avoiding the high server load associated with rsync.\n\n* Rsync over HTTP: zsync provides transfers that are nearly as efficient as rsync -z or cvsup, without the need to run a special server application. All that is needed is an HTTP/1.1-compliant web server. So it works through firewalls and on shared hosting accounts, and gives less security worries.\n\n* Handling for compressed files: rsync is ineffective on compressed files, unless they are compressed with a patched version of gzip. zsync has special handling for gzipped files, which enables update transfers of files which are distributed in compressed form.\n\nRead more\n\nLoad / Performance Testing Web Application - Httperf\n\nHttperf is a tool for measuring web server performance. It provides a flexible facility for generating various HTTP workloads and for measuring server performance.\n\nThe focus of httperf is not on implementing one particular benchmark but on providing a robust, high-performance tool that facilitates the construction of both micro- and macro-level benchmarks. The three distinguishing characteristics of httperf are its ...\n\n* Robustness, which includes the ability to generate and sustain server overload\n\n* Support for the HTTP/1.1 and SSL protocols\n\n* Extensibility to new workload generators and performance measurements.\n\nThe purpose of httperf is to help answer a number of complex or otherwise hard to investigate questions. For instance, it is usually desirable when designing and programming a website to be interested in how well it will perform under a variety of circumstances. When investigating whether or not to invest in faster equipment, many people want to know the limits to which their current hardware can perform. This is what httperf is designed to help answer.\n\nRead more\n\nTesting Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability - XSSer\n\nCross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in Web applications that enables attackers to inject client-side script into Web pages viewed by other users.\n\nA cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 80% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. Their effect may range from a petty nuisance to a significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.\n\nXSSer is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting XSS injections against different applications.\n\nIt contains several options to try to bypass certain filters, and various special techniques of code injection.\n\nXSSer Features\n\n* Added “final remote injections” option\n\n* Cross Flash Attack!\n\n* Cross Frame Scripting\n\n* Data Control Protocol Injections\n\n* Base64 (rfc2397) PoC\n\n* OnMouseMove PoC\n\n* Browser launcher\n\n* New options menu\n\n* Pre-check system\n\n* Crawler spidering clones\n\n* More advanced statistics system\n\n* “Mana” ouput results\n\nRead more\n\nInstall Many Linux Distributions from one disk - NetbootCD\n\nNetbootCD is a GNU/Linux live CD based on Tiny Core Linux. The live CD allows the user to download and run one of several Linux netboot installers, which can install a full GNU/Linux system with only a hard drive and Internet connection.\n\nSeveral of the distributions supported by NetbootCD are prerelease distributions (such as Debian testing) or development distributions (openSUSE Factory, Fedora Rawhide, Debian sid.) Because NetbootCD downloads the latest installer, which in turn downloads the latest system components, you can install a fully up-to-date system without burning a new CD.\n\nRead more\n\nHow to Hide data (Steganography) into MP3 file - mp3stego\n\nSteganography is the art and science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of the message, a form of security through obscurity\n\nMP3Stego will hide information in MP3 files during the compression process. The data is first compressed, encrypted and then hidden in the MP3 bit stream. Although MP3Stego has been written with steganographic applications in mind it might be used as a copyright marking system for MP3 files (weak but still much better than the MPEG copyright flag defined by the standard). Any opponent can uncompress the bit stream and recompress it; this will delete the hidden information – actually this is the only attack we know yet – but at the expense of severe quality loss.\n\nRead more\n\nGenerate and/or Encrypt Passwords - makepasswd\n\nmakepasswd generates true random passwords by using the /dev/urandom feature of Linux, with the emphasis on security over pronounceability. It can also encrypt plaintext passwords given on the command line.\n\nmakepasswd Installation:\n\nOpen the terminal and type following command to install makepasswd:\n\nsudo apt-get install makepasswd\n\nAfter successful installation you can use the makepasswd using following command, here I am generating 10 diffferent passwd having character length 10\n\nFor more detail options type command makepasswd --help or check the man pages\n\nRead more\n\nSetting up SSH keys for Secure Password-less SSH Login\n\nOpenSSH is a FREE version of the SSH connectivity tools that technical users of the Internet rely on. Users of telnet, rlogin, and ftp may not realize that their password is transmitted across the Internet unencrypted, but it is. OpenSSH encrypts all traffic (including passwords) to effectively eliminate eavesdropping, connection hijacking, and other attacks. Additionally, OpenSSH provides secure tunneling capabilities and several authentication methods, and supports all SSH protocol versions.\n\nThe OpenSSH suite replaces rlogin and telnet with the ssh program, rcp with scp, and ftp with sftp. Also included is sshd (the server side of the package), and the other utilities like ssh-add, ssh-agent, ssh-keysign, ssh-keyscan, ssh-keygen and sftp-server.\n\nIf you manage more than one or two hosts, you likely have to type the same password too often. This can get quite annoying. SSH allows you to setup a public and private keypair. Using these keys, you can connect to any host which has the public key, from any host which has the private key.\n\nRead more\n\nGraphical grub2 Configuration Manager - Grub Customizer\n\nThe goal of Grub Customizer is to create a complete and intuitive graphical grub2/burg configuration interface. The main feature is the boot entry list configuration - but not simply by modified the grub.cfg: to keep the dynamical configuration, this application will only edit the script order and generate proxies (script output filter), if required. To get more information about how it works, look here: https://answers.launchpad.net/grub-customizer/+faq/1355.\n\nVersion 2.0 introduces the ability to change the grub2/burg setting like the default entry, timeouts, menu visibility, screen resolution, background image and colors (grub2 only) and much more.\n\nSince version 1.5 you can use it to repair and configure grub2/burg using a live cd (and Grub Customizer, which has to be installed as usual at the live system before using it). All the required partitions will be automatically mounted when choosing the root partition and some sub partitions on the \"partition chooser\" (a dialog which pops up, when you start Grub Customizer inside a live system).\n\nRead more\n\nTool to Audit Web Application Security - Lilith\n\nLiLith is a tool written in Perl to audit web applications. This tool analyses webpages and looks for html <form> tags , which often refer to dynamic pages that might be subject to SQL injection or other flaws.\n\nHow the entire \"scanning\" process works is different from so called \"CGI scanners\", such as nikto and n-stealth. This program will surf to a website and crawls through all the links, just as a user would to. On any possible input field, such as text boxes, page id's, ... LiLith will attempt to inject any characters that might have a special meaning for any underlying technology, such as SQL.\n\nAny Web applications scanner can never perform a full 100% correct audit. Therefore, a manual re-check is necessary. Hence, be aware that Lilith might come up with several false positives.\n\nRead more\n\nHack Into Wi-Fi (WEP and WPA Encrypted) Networks - Wifite\n\nAuthor is NOT responsible for any damage or illegal actions caused by the use of this program.\n\nUse on your own risk!\n\nWifite is made to attack multiple WEP and WPA encrypted networks at the same time. this tool is customizable to be automated with only a few arguments. wifite can be trusted to run without supervision.\n\nWifite features:\n\n* Sorts targets by power (in dB); cracks closest access points first\n\n* Automatically deauths clients of hidden networks to decloak SSIDs\n\n* Numerous filters to specify exactly what to attack (wep/wpa/both, above certain signal strengths, channels, etc)\n\n* Customizable settings (timeouts, packets/sec, channel, change mac address, ignore fake-auth, etc)\n\n* \"anonymous\" feature; changes MAC to a random address before attacking, then changes back when attacks are complete\n\n* all WPA handshakes are backed up to wifite.py's current directory\n\n* Smart WPA deauthentication -- cycles between all clients and broadcast deauths\n\n* Stop any attack with Ctrl+C -- options: continue, move onto next target, skip to cracking, or exit\n\n* Switching WEP attack methods does not reset IVs\n\n* Intel 4965 chipset fake-authentication support; uses wpa_supplicant workaround\n\n* SKA support (untested)\n\n* Displays session summary at exit; shows any cracked keys\n\n* All passwords saved to log.txt\n\n* built-in updater: ./wifite.py -upgrade\n\nRead more\n\nCreate and Manage Encrypted Folder (EncFS) in Ubuntu with Cryptkeeper\n\nEncFS creates a virtual encrypted filesystem which stores encrypted data in the rootdir directory and makes the unencrypted data visible at the mountPoint directory. The user must supply a password which is used to (indirectly) encrypt both filenames and file contents.\n\nIf EncFS is unable to find a supported filesystem at the specified rootdir, then the user will be asked if they wish to create a new encrypted filesystem at the specified location. Options will be presented to the user allowing some control over the algorithms to use. As EncFS matures, there may be an increasing number of choices.\n\nEncFS offers several advantages over other disk encryption software simply because each file is stored individually as an encrypted file somewhere else in the host's directory tree.\n\nRead more\n\nSecuring Service using TCP_WRAPPERS\n\nUsing TCP_WRAPPERS makes securing your servers against outside intrusion is a lot simpler and painless. TCP_WRAPPERS is controlled from two files:\n\n/etc/hosts.allow\n\n/etc/hosts.deny\n\nhosts.allow is checked first, and the rules are checked from first to last. If it finds a rule that explicitly allows you in (i.e., a rule allowing your host, domain, subnet mask, etc.) it lets you connect to the service. If it fails to find any rules that pertain to you in hosts.allow, it then goes to check hosts.deny for a rule denying you entry.\n\nRead more\n\nLimiting Linux System Users - limits.conf\n\nAlmost all Linux distributions ship with PAM support making it universally available. PAM limits provide a single standardized interface to setting user limits, instead of having to write complex shell configuration files (such as /etc/profile) you simply edit the \"limits.conf\" file. As well applying limits selectively through the command shell is very difficult, whereas with PAM applying limits globally, on groups or on individual users is quite simple. To enable PAM limits you need to add a line such as:\n\nsession required /lib/security/pam_limits.so\n\nto the appropriate Pam configuration file (/etc/pam.d/sshd). You can then define limits, typically these are in \"/etc/security/limits.conf\" or a similar location. Because most of these limits are enforced by the shell the system cannot log all violations of limits (you will be notified in syslog when a user exceeds the number of times they are allowed to login, however you will not receive a warning if the user tries to use more disk space then they are allowed to).\n\nRead more\n\nGUI Toolkit for Database Developers and Administrator - TOra\n\nTOra is an open-source multi-platform database management GUI that supports accessing most of the common database platforms in use, including Oracle, MySQL, and Postgres, as well as limited support for any target that can be accessed through Qt's ODBC support.

It takes the URL of a program and runs it (downloading it first if necessary). Any dependencies of the program are fetched in the same way. The user controls which version of the program and its dependencies to use.\n\nZero Install is a decentralised installation system (there is no central repository; all packages are identified by URLs), loosely-coupled (if different programs require different versions of a library then both versions are installed in parallel, without conflicts), and has an emphasis on security (all package descriptions are GPG-signed, and contain cryptographic hashes of the contents of each version). Each version of each program is stored in its own sub-directory within the Zero Install cache (nothing is installed to directories outside of the cache, such as /usr/bin) and no code from the package is run during install or uninstall. The system can automatically check for updates when software is run.\n\nRead more\n\nGUI Tool to dump (clone/image) Files, Disks, Partitions - Gdiskdump\n\ndd is a common Unix program whose primary purpose is the low-level copying and conversion of raw data. dd is an application that will \"convert and copy a file\" dd can also be used to copy regions of raw device files, e.g. backing up the boot sector of a hard disk, or to read fixed amounts of data from special files like /dev/zero or /dev/random.\n\nThe dd utility copies the specified input file to the specified output with possible conversions. The standard input and output are used by default. The input and output block sizes may be specified to take advantage of raw physical I/O. Sizes are specified in bytes; a number may end with k, b, or w to specify multiplication by 1024, 512, or 2, respectively\n\nThere is a command line involved in using dd command and if you are afraid of using command line or you are just a normal desktop user you can use the GUI version of the dd command know as - Gdiskdump\n\nRead more\n\nInstallation and Configuration of Apache Traffic Server under Ubuntu\n\nGlobal data networking has become part of everyday life: internet users request billions of documents and terabytes of data, on a daily basis, to and from all parts of the world.

Unity debuted in the netbook edition of Ubuntu 10.10. It is designed to make more efficient use of space given the limited screen size of netbooks, including, for example, a vertical application switcher called the launcher. Unlike GNOME, KDE Software Compilation, or Xfce, Unity is not a collection of applications but designed to be used with existing GTK+ programs.\n\nUbuntu has traditionally used the full GNOME desktop environment; founder Mark Shuttleworth cited philosophical differences with the GNOME team over the user experience to explain why Ubuntu would use Unity as the default desktop instead of GNOME Shell, beginning April 2011, with Ubuntu Natty Narwhal (11.04).\n\nRead more\n\nRecover deleted files using Foremost\n\nForemost is a console program to recover files based on their headers, footers, and internal data structures.
