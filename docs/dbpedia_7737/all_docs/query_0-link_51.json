        "text": "This page is for good quality software on GNU/Linux platforms based on the contributions of wiki users. If you saw something that looked really nice on /g/ or /tech/, and were interested, take a look at what anons generally use.\n\nIf you're looking for alternatives to specific Windows or OSX software, take a look at switching.software, linuxalt.com and alternativeto.net.\n\nIt should be noted that a lot of this software is portable to BSD, and should be included in the ports tree of your preferred operating system.\n\nWhat does /g/ use?\n\nDistro: See Babbies First Linux\n\nWeb Browser: See Web browsers\n\nIRC: Weechat or Irssi.\n\nVoIP: Mumble, maybe Tox sometimes.\n\nMedia Player: mpv.\n\nMusic player: mpv, MPD and ncmpcpp, or ncmpc, or cmus.\n\nImage Viewer: feh, sxiv, or viu.\n\nTerminal Emulator: rxvt-unicode or st.\n\nFile Manager: none or Ranger or Vifm.\n\nDocument Reader: zathura.\n\nText Editor: Vim or something Vim based, GNU Emacs.\n\nAlso check out the \"What does /g/ use?\" category of this wiki.\n\nCommunications\n\nWeb browsers\n\nFor more detailed information, see Web browsers.\n\nChromium\n\nChromium is the developer version of Google Chrome. Its tracking features can be easily disabled. Although it is open source software, its code is not as well audited as Firefox because its source tree is an unreadable 4GiB clusterfuck of mental illness. There is also Ungoogled Chromium which attempts to rip out most of the google botnet.\n\nBrave\n\nBrave is an open source fork of Chromium focused on privacy and speed. It has a built in ad and tracker blocker as well as a controversial cryptocurrency reward program with their own currency Basic Attention Token (BAT). The devs have been caught doing shady stuff in the past, and are still spying on their users.\n\nFirefox\n\nFirefox is free software developed by Mozilla. It is highly extensible via addons and included as the default browser in many GNU/Linux distributions. It is often criticized on /g/ and /tech/ as \"SJWfox\" because of some Mozilla developers outspoken campaigns on social and political issues.\n\nGNU IceCat\n\nGNU IceCat is a Richard Stallman approved rebrand of Firefox maintained by the GNU Project. It removes all trademarked artwork and adds some privacy protection features.\n\nParabola Iceweasel\n\nParabola Iceweasel is an FSF approved rebrand of Firefox maintained by Parabola GNU/Linux-libre. It removes all nonfree features such as DRM and trademarked artwork. Iceweasel is basically GNU IceCat, but actually maintained, and without pre-installed extensions that break 90% of all websites.\n\nIridium\n\nIridium is a FLOSS fork of Chromium stripped of as many botnet and proprietary \"features\" as possible. It used to phone home to Iridium's servers for development purposes, but it no longer does that. It does phone home to Google servers, though. Nonetheless, it is still as fast as a Chromium fork is expected. Use at your own risk.\n\nMidori\n\nMidori is a fast, lightweight, LGPL licensed browser using the WebKit rendering engine. It is the default browser in Artix, Elementary OS, Raspbian and Trisquel Mini.\n\nNetSurf\n\nNetSurf is a fast, lightweight browser that uses GTK and its own rendering engine, with optional JavaScript support via the duktape engine.\n\nDillo\n\nDillo is an even faster, more lightweight browser running on FLTK using its own rendering engine, with limited (but improving) CSS support and no JavaScript support.\n\nOpera\n\nOpera is a proprietary web browser that has pioneered open web standards for over two decades. It is notable for being the first web browser to sport a tabbed interface. It is developed and maintained by Opera Software and recently is just a proprietary version of chromium.\n\nOtter Browser\n\nOtter Browser is a FOSS web browser that aims to recreate the best aspects of the classic Opera (12.x) UI using Qt5.\n\nPale Moon\n\nPale Moon is a fork of Firefox under a proprietary open source license. It has a familiar UI without the \"Australis\" redesign.\n\nQupZilla\n\nQupZilla is a FOSS web browser, built on the Qt and QtWebEngine (based on Chromium's rendering engine) frameworks. It supports extensions, ships out of the box with AdBlock, Mouse Gestures, GreaseMonkey, Speed Dial, Click2Flash, and more. It provides seamless integration with most desktop environments, and has several other distinguishing features. QupZilla is licensed under GPLv3.\n\nSeaMonkey\n\nSeaMonkey is a continuation of the Mozilla suite. Unlike most modern web browsers, it is an Internet suite, complete with bundled programs for email, IRC, and web design. It is compatible with most Firefox add-ons.\n\nSurf\n\nSurf is a lightweight browser created by the Suckeless project. It uses the glib webkit. Most settings can not be changed after you compile, and the majority of setting change from default requires you to implement them into your makefile.\n\nTor Browser\n\nTor Browser (formerly known as Tor Browser Bundle) is a package of a modified Firefox extended support release, NoScript, Tor, TorButton and TorLauncher. It automatically routes traffic through the Tor network and deletes history and cookies when closed.\n\nEmail clients\n\nClaws Mail\n\nClaws Mail is an email client (and news reader), based on GTK+. The appearance and interface are designed to be familiar to new users coming from other popular email clients, as well as experienced users. Almost all commands are accessible with the keyboard.\n\nSylpheed\n\nSylpheed is a lightweight e-mail client based on GTK+2. Claws Mail was forked from Sylpheed; however, Sylpheed still retains an extremely simple and minimalist appearance and configuration.\n\nEvolution\n\nEvolution is a personal information management application that provides integrated mail, calendaring and address book functionality.\n\nKMail\n\nKMail is the email component of Kontact, the integrated personal information manager from KDE.\n\nThunderbird\n\nThunderbird is an email client based upon the Gecko rendering engine. Like its sibling Firefox, it offers the user extensive customization options via third-party add-ons.\n\nTerminal\n\nAlpine is a fast, easy to use email client that is suitable for both the inexperienced email user as well as for the most demanding of power users. Alpine is based on the Pine® Message System. It is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\nMutt's initial interface was based largely on the ELM mail client. To a large extent, Mutt is still very ELM-like in presentation of information in menus (and in fact, ELM users will find it quite painless to switch as the default key bindings are identical).

On average Reaver will recover the target AP's plain text WPA/WPA2 passphrase in four to ten hours, depending on the AP. In practice, it will generally take half this time to guess the correct WPS pin and recover the passphrase.\n\nPassword managers\n\nKeePassXC\n\nKeePassXC is a fork from the cross platform password manager KeePassX. Since KeePassX suffers from slow development and rarely gets updated, KeePassXC should be preferred. It is published under the GNU GPL. Its file format is compatible with KeePass2 and KeePassX.\n\nTerminal\n\npass is a CLI password manager. It encrypts all of your passwords with GnuPG in the ~/.password_store file. One disadvantage is that it doesn't encrypt the folders it's in, meaning that if you store a password in privatewebsite.com/username, an attacker will know you have an account on privatewebsite.com - this shouldn't be an issue if your /home is encrypted and the computer is turned off. Overall it's very convienent, easy to use, safe, and utilizes the UNIX Philiosophy.
