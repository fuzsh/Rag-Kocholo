Qt is most notably used in KDE, Opera, Google Earth, Skype,\n\nQtopia, Photoshop Elements, VirtualBox and OPIE. It is produced by the\n\nNorwegian company Trolltech. Nokia acquired Trolltech on January 28,\n\n2008.[2][3]\n\nQt uses C++ with several non-standard extensions implemented by an\n\nadditional pre-processor that generates standard C++ code before\n\ncompilation. Qt can also be used in several other programming\n\nlanguages; bindings exist for Ada (QtAda),[4] C# (Qyoto/Kimono),[5]\n\nJava (Qt Jambi),[6] Pascal, Perl, PHP (PHP-Qt), Ruby (RubyQt), and\n\nPython (PyQt). It runs on all major platforms, and has extensive\n\ninternationalization support. Non-GUI features include SQL database\n\naccess, XML parsing, thread management, network support and a unified\n\ncross-platform API for file handling.\n\nContents\n\n[hide]\n\n* 1 Varieties\n\n* 2 Current\n\n* 3 History\n\n* 4 Design\n\no 4.1 Use of native UI-rendering APIs\n\no 4.2 Meta object compiler\n\no 4.3 QtScript ECMAScript interpreter\n\n* 5 Applications built using Qt\n\n* 6 See also\n\n* 7 References\n\n* 8 External links\n\n[edit] Varieties\n\nQt is released by Trolltech on the following platforms:\n\n* Qt/X11 – Qt for X Window System (Unix / Linux)\n\n* Qt/Mac – Qt for Apple Mac OS X\n\n* Qt/Windows – Qt for Microsoft Windows\n\n* Qt/Embedded – Qt for embedded platforms (PDA, Smartphone, etc.)\n\n* Qt/WinCE – Qt for Windows CE[7]\n\n* Qt Jambi – Qt for Java\n\nQt is also available for embedded devices as Qtopia.\n\nThere are four editions of Qt available on each of these platforms,\n\nnamely:\n\n* Qt Console – edition for non-GUI development\n\n* Qt Desktop Light – entry level GUI edition, stripped of network\n\nand database support\n\n* Qt Desktop – complete edition\n\n* Qt Open Source Edition – \"complete\" edition, with some\n\nexceptions,[8] for free software/open source developers\n\nQt is available under a dual license, the GPL v2 or v3 with special\n\nexception[9] and a proprietary commercial license on all supported\n\nplatforms. The commercial license allows the final application to be\n\nlicensed under various free software/open source licenses such as the\n\nLGPL or the Artistic License, or a proprietary software license.\n\nAll editions support a wide range of compilers, including the GCC C++\n\ncompiler and the Visual Studio suite.\n\n[edit] Current\n\nTrolltech released Qt 4 on June 28, 2005 and introduced five new\n\ntechnologies in the framework:\n\n* Tulip A set of template container classes.\n\n* Interview A model/view architecture for item views.\n\n* Arthur A 2D painting framework.\n\n* Scribe A Unicode text renderer with a public API for performing\n\nlow-level text layout.\n\n* MainWindow A modern action-based main window, toolbar, menu, and\n\ndocking architecture.\n\nQt 4.1, released on December 19, 2005, introduced integrated SVG Tiny\n\nsupport, a PDF backend to Qt's printing system, and a few other\n\nfeatures.\n\nQt 4.2, released on October 4, 2006, introduced Windows Vista support,\n\nintroduced native CSS support for widget styling, as well as the\n\nQGraphicsView framework for efficient rendering of thousands of 2D\n\nobjects onscreen, to replace Qt 3.x's QCanvas class.\n\nQt 4.3, released on May 30, 2007, improved Windows Vista support,\n\nimproved OpenGL engine, SVG file generation, added QtScript\n\n(ECMAScript scripting engine based on QSA).[10]\n\nQt 4.4, released on May 6, 2008. Features included are improved\n\nmultimedia support using Phonon, enhanced XML support, a concurrency\n\nframework to ease the development of multi-threaded applications, an\n\nIPC framework with a focus on shared memory, and WebKit integration.\n\n[edit] History\n\nHaavard Nord and Eirik Chambe-Eng (the original developers of Qt and\n\nthe CEO and President, respectively, of Trolltech) began development\n\nof \"Qt\" in 1991, three years before the company was incorporated as\n\nQuasar Technologies, then changed the name to Troll Tech, and then to\n\nTrolltech.\n\nThe toolkit was called Qt because the letter Q looked appealing in\n\nHaavard's Emacs font, and \"t\" was inspired by Xt, the X toolkit.[11]\n\nControversy erupted around 1998 when it became clear that KDE was\n\ngoing to become one of the leading desktop environments for Linux. As\n\nKDE was based on Qt, many people in the free software movement worried\n\nthat an essential piece of one of their major operating systems would\n\nbe proprietary.\n\nThis gave rise to two efforts: the Harmony toolkit, which sought to\n\nduplicate the Qt Toolkit under a free software license, and the GNOME\n\ndesktop, which intended to supplant KDE entirely. The GNOME Desktop\n\nuses the GTK+ toolkit, which was originally written for the GIMP, and\n\nprimarily uses the C programming language.\n\nUntil version 1.45, source code for Qt was released under the FreeQt\n\nlicense — which was viewed as not compliant with the open source\n\nprinciple by the Open Source Initiative and the free software\n\ndefinition by Free Software Foundation, because while the source was\n\navailable it did not allow the redistribution of modified versions.\n\nWith the release of version 2.0 of the toolkit, the license was\n\nchanged to the Q Public License (QPL), a free software license but one\n\nregarded by the Free Software Foundation as incompatible with the GPL.\n\nCompromises were sought between KDE and Trolltech whereby Qt would not\n\nbe able to fall under a more restrictive license than the QPL, even if\n\nTrolltech was bought out or went bankrupt. This led to the creation of\n\nthe KDE Free Qt foundation, which guarantees that Qt would fall under\n\na BSD-style license should no free software/open source version of Qt\n\nbe released during 12 months.\n\nThe first two versions of Qt had only two flavours: Qt/X11 for Unix\n\nand Qt/Windows for the Windows platform. The Windows platform was only\n\navailable under the proprietary license which meant free/open source\n\napplications written in Qt for X11 could not be ported to Windows\n\nwithout purchasing the QPL edition. In the end of 2001, Trolltech\n\nreleased Qt 3.0 which added support for the Mac OS X platform. The Mac\n\nOS X support was available only in the proprietary license, until June\n\n2003, where Trolltech released Qt 3.2 with Mac OS X support available\n\nunder the GPL.\n\nIn 2002 members of the KDE on Cygwin project began porting the GPL\n\nlicensed Qt/X11 code base to Windows.[12] This was in response to\n\nTrolltech's refusal to license Qt/Windows under the GPL on the grounds\n\nthat Windows was not a free software/open source platform.[13][14] The\n\nproject achieved reasonable success although it never reached\n\nproduction quality.\n\nThis was resolved when Trolltech released Qt/Windows 4 under the GPL\n\nin June 2005. Qt 4 now supports the same set of platforms in the free\n\nsoftware/open source editions as in the proprietary edition, so it is\n\nnow possible to create GPL-licensed free/open source applications\n\nusing Qt on all supported platforms.\n\n[edit] Design\n\nThe innovation of Qt when it was first released relied on a few key\n\nconcepts.\n\n[edit] Use of native UI-rendering APIs\n\nQt used to emulate the native look of its intended platforms, which\n\noccasionally led to slight discrepancies where that emulation wasn't\n\nperfect. Recent versions of Qt use the native APIs of the different\n\nplatforms to draw the Qt controls, and so do not suffer from such\n\nissues. (See also wxWidgets, which relies on native APIs for most\n\nwidget functionality.)\n\n[edit] Meta object compiler\n\nKnown as the moc, this is a tool that is run on the sources of a Qt\n\nprogram prior to compiling it. The tool will generate \"Meta\n\nInformation\" about the classes used in the program. This meta\n\ninformation is used by Qt to provide programming features not\n\navailable in C++: The signal/slot system, introspection and\n\nasynchronous function calls.\n\nThe use of an additional tool has been criticized for making Qt\n\nprogramming different from pure C++ programming. In particular, the\n\nchoice of an implementation based on macros has been criticized for\n\nits absence of type safety and pollution of the namespace. This is\n\nviewed by Trolltech as a necessary trade-off to provide introspection\n\nand the dynamically generated slot and signal mechanism.\n\n[edit] QtScript ECMAScript interpreter\n\nQt Script for Applications is a cross-platform toolkit that allows\n\ndevelopers to make their Qt/C++ applications scriptable using an\n\ninterpreted scripting language: Qt Script (based on ECMAScript/\n\nJavaScript).\n\nFrom Qt 4.3.0 onward, the scripting API [15], which is based on QSA\n\n[16] is integrated as a core part of Qt and is no longer a separate\n\nlibrary.\n\n[edit] Applications built using Qt\n\nPopular examples of applications which use Qt include:\n\n* Adobe Photoshop Album, an image organizing application\n\n* Doxygen, an API document generator\n\n* Google Earth, a 3D map program\n\n* KDE, a popular desktop environment for Unix-like operating\n\nsystems\n\no KDELibs, a library base for many KDE applications\n\nincluding Amarok, K3b, KDevelop and KOffice\n\n* Last.fm Player, the desktop client for the popular internet\n\nradio and music community website.\n\n* Launchy, the open source keystroke launcher for Windows.\n\n* LMMS, a free open source sequencer and software synthesis\n\npackage.\n\n* LyX, a GUI frontend to LaTeX\n\n* Mathematica, Linux version uses Qt for the GUI front-end.\n\n* Mixxx, cross-platform open source DJ mixing software.\n\n* Motorola A760, uses Qt/Embedded in its UI\n\n* MythTV, an open source digital video recorder\n\n* Opera, a web browser\n\n* Psi, an instant messaging client for XMPP\n\n* Scribus, a desktop publishing application\n\n* Skype, a P2P VOIP application\n\n* TOra, a database administration tool[17]\n\n* VirtualBox, a PC virtualization application\n\n* VisIt, an interactive parallel visualization tool for viewing\n\nscientific data\n\n* VisTrails, a scientific workflow management and visualization\n\nsystem\n\n* Xconfig, Linux Kernel configuration tool\n\n* VLC Media Player, an open source media player, Qt frontend since\n\nversion 0.9\n\n[edit] See also\n\nFree software portal\n\n* GTK+\n\n* Widget toolkit\n\n* wxWidgets\n\n[edit] References\n\n1. ^ Interview with Trolltech president Eirik Eng on dot.kde.org\n\n2. ^ News release announcing Nokia's offer to acquire Qt-developer\n\nTrolltech\n\n3. ^ \"Nokia to acquire Trolltech to accelerate software\n\nstrategy\" (in en) (2008-01-28).
