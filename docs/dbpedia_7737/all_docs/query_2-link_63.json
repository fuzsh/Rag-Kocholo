Also refers to the output of such a program, which can be called a patch (since the output can be applied with the Unix program patch).\n\ndigiKam: an image organizer and editor that uses the KDE Platform. It runs on most known desktop environments and window managers, supports all major image file formats, and can organize collections of photographs in directory-based albums, or dynamic albums by date, timeline, or tags. Users can also add captions and ratings to their images, search through them and save searches for later use. With the plugins one can also export albums to 23hq, Facebook, Flickr, Gallery2, Google Earth's KML files, SmugMug, Piwigo, and Simpleviewer, or burn them onto a CD, or create a web gallery.\n\nDistributed repository: A peer-to-peer approach to sharing and maintaining code or other collaborative work, in contrast to the client-server approach of centralized systems. Rather than a single, central repository on which clients synchronize, each peer's working copy of the codebase is a separate repository bound by a web of trust.\n\nDistribution (Distro): a selection of packages that make up a working software system, and provided together to the user. Often applied to the GNU/Linux system in particular.\n\nDocs: documentation, an essential part of the development process.\n\nE\n\nEBN: English Breakfast Network, a site dedicated to the contemplation of tea, KDE API Documentation Validation, User Documentation Validation, Source Code Checking, omphaloskepsis, and star-gazing.\n\nEclipse: A multi-language software development environment comprising an integrated development environment (IDE) and an extensible plug-in system.

The KDE e.V. is a registered non-profit organization that represents the KDE Community in legal and financial matters.\n\nF\n\nForum: An online discussion site where people can hold conversations by posting messages. They differ from chat rooms in that messages are archived. A discussion forum is hierarchical or tree-like in structure: a forum can contain a number of subforums, each of which may have several topics. Within a forum's topic, each new discussion started is called a thread, and can be replied to by anyone who wishes to.\n\nFOSS: Free and open-source software (F/OSS, FOSS) or free/libre/open-source software (FLOSS, FL/OSS) is software that is liberally licensed to grant users the right to use, study, share, change, and improve its design through access to its source code.\n\nFramework: An abstraction in which software providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by user code, thus providing application specific software. It is a collection of software libraries providing a defined application programming interface (API).\n\nFrameworks: Beginning with KDE Frameworks 5.0, KDE has a roadmap for the next major releast of KDE's libraries and runtime requirements, with an emphasis is on modularity, dependency clarity, simplification and increasing quality.\n\nFreenode: An IRC network used to discuss peer-directed projects.\n\nG\n\nGDB: GNU Debugger, usually called just GDB and named gdb as an executable file.

Project Neon is such a project for KDE.\n\nO\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP): a programming paradigm using objects â data structures consisting of data fields and methods together with their interactions â to design applications and computer programs.\n\nOcular: KDE's universal document viewer based on KPDF.\n\nOperators (IRCops): Channel operators have powers over the IRC channel, including moderating or kicking out disruptive users. IRCops or sysops control the IRC server, so they control the channels as well as having control over who can participate. On most systems, ops are identified with a symbol next to their nicks, but Freenode discourages ops from appearing as such unless they have work to do in the channel.\n\nP\n\nPackage, packaging: There are two types of packages that may be downloaded from the KDE FTP site: binary packages (rpms, debs, and the like) and source packages. Binary packages are compiled (\"runnable\") versions of KDE SC that are built to run on a specific OS or distribution. Source packages are the raw code that makes up KDE SC, and need to be compiled before they can be used. KDE software packages available from the distributions may be slightly different from the pure KDE source packages.\n\nPastebin: a web application that allows users to upload snippets of text, usually samples of source code, for public viewing.Use is encouraged in IRC channels, where pasting large amounts of text is considered bad etiquette.

The tools may be used in a chain, so that the output of each tool becomes the input for the next, but the term is used widely to refer to any set of linked development tools.\n\nToolkit: set of basic building units for graphical user interfaces. KDE SC uses the Qt toolkit.\n\nTrunk: the unnamed branch (version) of a file tree under revision control. The trunk (or master) is usually meant to be the base of a project on which development progresses.\n\nU\n\nUnit tests: method by which individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application. In object-oriented programming a unit is usually an interface, such as a class.\n\nUsability: ease of use and learnability of a human-made object, in this case, our software.\n\nUserbase: KDE's user documentation wiki.\n\nV\n\nValgrind: GPL licensed programming tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling. The name valgrind comes from the main entrance to Valhalla in Norse mythology.\n\nVariable: symbolic name given to some known or unknown quantity or information, for the purpose of allowing the name to be used independently of the information it represents. A variable name in computer source code is usually associated with a data storage location and thus also its contents, and these may change during the course of program execution.\n\nVersion control: Revision control, also known as version control and source control (and an aspect of software configuration management or SCM), is the management of changes to documents, programs, and other information stored as computer files. It is most commonly used in software development, where a team of people may change the same files. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the \"revision number\", \"revision level\", or simply \"revision\".\n\nW\n\nWidget: element of a graphical user interface (GUI) that displays an information arrangement changeable by the user, such as a window or a text box. The defining characteristic of a widget is to provide a single interaction point for the direct manipulation of a given kind of data. In other words, widgets are basic visual building blocks which, combined in an application, hold all the data processed by the application and the available interactions on this data.\n\nWiki: website that allows the creation and editing of any number of interlinked web pages via a web browser using a simplified markup language or a WYSIWYG text editor. Wikis are typically powered by wiki software and are often used collaboratively by multiple users.\n\nWord processor: computer application used for the production (including composition, editing, formatting, and possibly printing) of any sort of printable material.\n\nX\n\nX, X window system: computer software system and network protocol that provides a basis for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and rich input device capability for networked computers. It creates a hardware abstraction layer where software is written to use a generalized set of commands, allowing for device independence and reuse of programs on any computer that implements X. X.Org serves as the canonical implementation of X, and is what KDE SC uses.\n\nY"
