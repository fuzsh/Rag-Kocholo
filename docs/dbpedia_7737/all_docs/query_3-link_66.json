        "text": "Context: The way public organizations produce, acquire, use, and commercialize software is changing as a result of open source software (OSS). Because of the numerous benefits provided by open source software, public organizations began to use it to meet their demands. As a result, governments implement various measures to encourage and facilitate OSS use. A variety of factors continue to influence the choice to implement OSS, which can have a positive or negative impact on the adoption process. Objective: The study’s purpose is to explore the most critical factors that may influence the open source software adoption process, which are drawn from chosen case studies from various domains in public organizations. Based on their findings, the authors produced a guideline to tell prospective adopters about the most crucial factors that they may confront during the adoption process. Method: Authors chose a handful of publications that address three public domains: healthcare, municipal g...\n\nPurpose. In this paper we investigate the importance of factors for the adoption of Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) in the public sector. We evaluate how different factors impact during the initiation and implementation phases of the adoption process. Design/Methodology/Approach. For this study we base the methodological approach on two exploratory case studies with a contrasting result logic. We build a multi-level framework grounded both on literature review, and feedback from stakeholders. We then apply the framework to two case studies to better frame the findings. We consider phases of adoption (initiation, implementation) and the levels of adoption (technological, organizational, environmental, individual). Findings. In the case studies, we found the importance of a strong and decision-centric management board to give the impulse for the initiation phase of the process. As perceived by the stakeholders, a strong governmental support is of paramount importance to increase the adoption at the public level, although in the case studies examined the initiation stage started from the impulse of a championing management. Both case studies passed the initiation phase successfully. Continuous employees’ training, organizational objectives consensus, and business process reengineering have been found important for the implementation phase. In the case study in which these factors were not in place, the implementation phase of adoption failed. Environmental factors - although relevant for the initiation of the adoption process - are less significant during the actual implementation of the adoption process, as the contrasting result logic from the case studies shows. Research Limitations/Implications. the study refers to two public organizations in a specific environmental setting. No causality among factors has been inferred. Quantitative objective data has been used to determine the successfulness of adoption, for qualitative data multiple sources have been used when possible to limit threats to validity. Practical implications. The framework can be used by stakeholders in public organizations to better frame their adoption strategies and to compare results across institutions. Lessons leant from the case studies can be useful to drive future adoptions of FLOSS."
