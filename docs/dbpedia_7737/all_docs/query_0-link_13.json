If you're looking to play your music, burn CDs for friends or sync up to your portable music player, Amarok is the one program you need.\n\nAmarok is not the only free software music manager. Rhythmbox is common if you're running GNOME, and like everyone else in the gang, he has many friends who do the same thing in a slightly different way — working together for free software.\n\nDownload Amarok\n\nDownload Amarok\n\nAmarok website\n\nAmarok at Wikipedia\n\nFind more audio applications in the Free Software Directory\n\nПрочитайте эту страницу на русском языке."
