        "text": "Summary. The methodical adoption of F/OSS in SMEs raises critical problems related to issues such as technology, organization, culture and business model choices. In this paper, we describe Polaris4OS, a successful experience of F/OSS adoption among CEOs, managers and developers of ICT companies. The lack of F/OSS culture has been identified as the most critical obstacle for the exploitation of the new opportunities offered by the F/OSS communities.\n\nABSTRACT This chapter explores the concept of patchwork prototyping: the combining of open source software applications to rapidly create a rudimentary but fully functional prototype that can be used and hence evaluated in real-life situations.\n\nABSTRACT This chapter explores the motivations and methods for mining (collecting, aggregating, distributing, and analyzing) data about free/libre open source software (FLOSS) projects. It ���rst explores why there is a need for this type of data. Then the chapter outlines the current state-of-the art in collecting and using quantitative data about FLOSS project, focusing especially on the three main types of FLOSS data that have been gathered to date: data from large forges, data from small project sets, and survey data."
