        "text": "Since my dream of a native OS X port of Amarok seems unlikely I've taken to exploring other options. Today I ran across Jajuk, a cross-platform, Java-based music jukebox. Jajuk is a Free Software published under GPL license and requires Java 1.5.\n\nJajuk has been around a while, but they recently upgraded to version 1.3 which utilizes mPlayer to add more supported music formats. Because I don't have mPlayer installed, I wasn't able to test that feature, but MP3 files play fine without any extra work.\n\nJajuk has some nice features and mirrors Amarok fairly closely. Highlights include:\n\nOgg, ID3 V1 and V2 support\n\nDockable perspectives and views\n\nWikipedia view displays artist discography\n\nVisual catalog of all albums by covers\n\nDynamic playlist creation by drag and drop\n\nConfigurable cross-fade\n\nRecursive play/repeat/shuffle/push in directories/sub-directories or by genre/artist/albums…\n\nBest Of smart function to play your favorite tracks\n\nJajuk recommends using Java 1.5, but I got it to run using 1.4, though it did flicker occasionally so if you want to test it on OS X without upgrading Java it's possible, though for long term usage I'd recommend you upgrade to Java 1.5.\n\nJajuk had no trouble scanning my library and in fact it was able to do so in just over 5 minutes which isn't bad for 65 gigs worth of music, the same task in iTunes takes at least double that.\n\nI had no trouble fetching cover art or CDDB info and the in-app Wikipedia lookup was surprisingly fast. There's also a nice graphical breakdown of your music based on tags that lets you see some aggregated metadata about your music collection (see screenshot below).\n\nI'll admit that I don't really like Java apps, but Jajuk bucks the trend of the previous Java apps I've used by managing to be both fast and stable.\n\nBecause it's Java-based you can test out Jajuk in your browser if you'd like to use it without downloading.\n\nLCD, IPS, OLED, and Quantum Dots: All the Confusing Display Terms, Explained\n\nShopping for monitors can feel like swimming through alphabet soup. Learn what all these technical acronyms mean before you buy.\n\nThe 30 Best Movies on Max (aka HBO Max) Right Now\n\nLove Lies Bleeding, Dune: Part Two, and Beetlejuice are just a few of the movies you should be watching on Max this month.\n\nYou Won’t Believe What Car Headlights Have in Store\n\nNew technology and a drive toward electrified powertrains have converged to create a flashy new car-lighting landscape. What comes next could be an international light language.\n\nWhat Are Color Gamuts and Color Spaces in TVs and Monitors, and Do They Matter?\n\nIf you’re confused by all the jargon used to describe your new monitor, don’t worry. We’ve got you (and your color gamut) covered.\n\nDating Apps Are Dehumanizing. Let’s Try Something New\n\nThis week on Gadget Lab, we talk about the arrival of Date Like Goblins and chart the rise of niche, interest-specific platforms for online dating.\n\nGoogle Search Is an Illegal Monopoly, US Judge Rules\n\nNearly a year after the US government took Google to trial, a judge has found that the tech giant violated antitrust laws. A new trial will determine how Google should be penalized.\n\nElon Musk’s X Is Leaving San Francisco\n\nThe office closure marks the end of an era for the site formerly known as Twitter.\n\nPack Your Bags With 8 Great Deals from Patagonia's Past-Season Sale\n\nYou still need a duffel bag and warm hoody on that last Labor Day trip. Pick one up for 40 percent off."
