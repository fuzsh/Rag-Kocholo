        "text": "Amarok\n\nHide your private Files and APPs with a single click.\n\nNew in version 0.9.2\n\nv0.9.2\n\n- Allow disabling the hide or unhide toast notifications (#172)\n\n- Fix file hiding crash on OxygenOS 11 (#171)\n\n- Reorganize the settings categories\n\n- Translation updates (see GitHub for the full list)\n\nAmarok is an Android application which enables you to hide your private files & apps with just one click. Often, we resort to complex encryptors to secure our files and apps, aiming to shield them from prying eyes. These encryptors, while effective, tend to be slow and resource-intensive, making the encryption of large files such as videos and music a daunting task. Despite their robust security, these methods are often overkill for the average user who simply wish to keep their private files and apps out of unintentional reach. Amarok is designed to be a light-weight hider. It disguises file names and headers, causing them to seem \"corrupted\" and unopenable. Amarok also deactivates applications, rendering them invisible in the launcher and system menu.Features\n\nUser-Friendly: Easily hide files and applications with a single click.\n\nRapid and Efficient Large File Hiding: Hides by altering only file name and signature, unaffected by file size.\n\nRoot-Free Application Hiding: Makes apps vanish from the launcher. Compatible with Root, Shizuku, Dhizuku, and DSM modes.\n\nPanic button: Use a floating button to quickly hide applications and files in urgent scenarios.\n\nQuick Settings Tile: A control center toggle for immediate hiding, bypassing the need to launch the app.\n\nApp Lock: Secure Amarok access with a password or fingerprint.\n\nPleasant Interface: Clean Material3 design.\n\nPlease be aware that Amarok is not an encryption software, but rather a tool for hiding things. We strongly advise against using Amarok to protect confidential files and applications.\n\nVersions\n\nAlthough APK downloads are available below to give you the choice, you should be aware that by installing that way you will not receive update notifications and it's a less secure way to download.
