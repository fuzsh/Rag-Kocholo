It is intended to be used as a component of a media player program such as amaroK, and is not generally useful when manually invoked. In particular, moodbar cannot directly render its results to an image.\n\nOPTIONS\n\nThese programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes ('--'). A summary of options is included below. -? --help Show summary of options. -o --output Set output file. --help-all Show a list of all options. --help-gst Show a list of gstreamer options.\n\nAUTHOR\n\nThis manual page was written by Bryan Donlan <bdonlan@gmail.com> for the Debian system (but may be used by others).
