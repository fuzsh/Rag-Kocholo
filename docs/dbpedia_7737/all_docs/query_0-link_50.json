We explain what Clementine is and point you to the official download.\n\nWhat is Clementine?\n\nClementine or more correctly as Clementine Media Player, is an open source music player with media library features available for Windows, Mac OS X, and UNIX-based operating systems. Originally launched in early 2010, Clementine was a fork of version 1.4 of Amarok, another open source music player; version 2 of the software was widely panned and Clementine was created in response to the criticism. As an open source software, Clementine is licensed under the GNU GPL (General Public License).\n\nAmong Clementineâ€™s many features is its ability to tap into and stream from Internet radio stations such as Soundcloud, Last.fm, Spotify, and Grooveshark, with support for additional services in the future (it could even play songs a user has uploaded to a cloud-based syncing service such as Google Drive), and stream (or create) podcasts. Alongside its support for popular audio formats it can also play audio CDs, create intelligent playlists with extra features and functionality, and transfer to and from iPod, iPhone, or any portable music player connected via USB. Clementine can also be remote-controlled from an Android device or a Wiimote.\n\nDownload Clementine from the developer\n\nFile.org does not provide software hosting. We send you directly to the developer's site, to make sure you download the latest, original version of the program.\n\nDownload Clementine (external link)\n\nFile types supported by Clementine\n\nAbout file types supported by Clementine\n\nFile.org aims to be the go-to resource for file type- and related software information. We spend countless hours researching various file formats and software that can open, convert, create or otherwise work with those files.\n\nIf you have additional information about which types of files Clementine can process, please do get in touch - we would love hearing from you."
