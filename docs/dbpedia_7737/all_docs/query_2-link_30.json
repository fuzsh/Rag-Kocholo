        "text": "About & Features\n\nClementine is a modern music player and library organizer\n\nClementine is a multiplatform music player. It is inspired by Amarok 1.4, focusing on a fast and easy-to-use interface for searching and playing your music.\n\nClementine Remote\n\nControl Clementine remotely from your Android phone\n\nScreenshots\n\nNews\n\nVersion 1.3.1 released - Tuesday, April 19, 2016\n\nFixes a bug where ratings are deleted when upgrading from older versions.\n\nVersion 0.4 released - Tuesday, June 29, 2010\n\nThis release features tabbed playlists, playlist search, projectM visualisations, Magnatune integration, ReplayGain volume normalisation and music transcoding. We've fixed loads of bugs too - searching large libraries is now much faster, playback is much more reliable on Windows, character encoding problems are fixed, and remote playlists should load correctly all the time.\n\nVersion 0.3 released - Saturday, May 8, 2010\n\nIn this release we've switched to GStreamer on all platforms, meaning the analyzer and crossfading between tracks will now work on Windows. New features include an equalizer, more library grouping options, a nicer OSD, remote control from command-line and MPRIS, and easier tag editing.\n\nVersion 0.2 released - Tuesday, March 23, 2010\n\nIt's been just over a month since we released the first version of Clementine. This new version features album cover-art, better \"Various Artists\" detection, support for loading playlists, and much more."
