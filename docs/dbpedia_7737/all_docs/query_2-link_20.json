        "text": "Expanding on the work started in Amarok 1.4.4 with the integration of the Magnatune.com music store, Amarok 2 explores the possibilities for integrating and collaborating with online music services, in particular the ones who license their content under a Creative Commons license. This integration makes a lot of sense as it directly benefits both the users of Amarok as well as the online services, and hence their artists.\n\nThis talk will cover some of the general ideas behind the integration, how it is being accomplished at a technical level, and what the future plans and possibilities are. Of course the talk will also include a live demo of the current state of Amarok 2."
