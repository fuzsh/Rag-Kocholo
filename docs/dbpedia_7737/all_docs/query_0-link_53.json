We're looking for people not only interested in the cutting edge of the distribution of television programmes over the internet to our audience, but also component technologies encouraging reuse, and collaborative system, specifically interested in using our Kamaelia (mainly python) & Dirac (mainly C++) open source projects. Kamaelia is a research tool for producing anything from PVRs, collaborative whiteboards, games through to streaming servers making parallelism simple through a component approach. Dirac is a next generation wavelet based video codec. The BBC also has a number of other open source projects - which can be found at http://www.bbc.co.uk/opensource/. <P>Kamaelia's aim is to make it easier and more fun to make software, quickly and maintainably in a way that makes concurrency (eg multicore) easy and fun to work with. The more code that is multicore friendly, the easier we make it for everyone.

It is one of the most successful and sustained cross-platform open source games ever with an active developer, administrative, and player community. There have been more than a million downloads in the last five years alone and our user base presently consists of more than 200 players online at any time of day or night. The project has actually become more popular over the years as we continue to improve and enhance the game. BZFlag has been under active development since 1992. Our organization is presently comprised of a rather disparate group of individuals that work on BZFlag because they love the game and the community that surrounds it. There are presently 71 individuals entrusted with access to BZFlag core resources including 46 individuals that have committed source code modifications over the project's life span. Our developer base presently consists of 9 documented core developers that have made extensive contributions to the game and remained active over many years, along with about a dozen apprentice-level developers that are coming up in the ranks, and about two dozen peripheral/casual developers, extension developers, and web integration programmers. Additionally, there are several dozen trusted staffers, server operators, and graphic artists that assist in the day-to-day operations needed by the game for keeping servers up and running, providing server list services, designing artwork, providing network statistics, image hosting, web hosting, and much more. All of our project developers almost exclusively collaborate on the #bzflag Freenode IRC channel, which is the central hub for most of our development discussions, decision planning meetings, game operations, and network infrastructure administration. We operate via a benevolent dictatorship combined with a meritocracy that strives for consensus between the core developers and other involved community members. Extensive discussions are held for any changes to BZFlag that affect the game's traditional \"spirit\", mood of gameplay, tone of the user environment, and types of interactions possible in the game. These discussions also include considerations whenever there are new features being added such as new flags, enhanced graphics, or changes to the gameplay. We also serve as a support arm to our user community assisting them with anything from how to get started playing to providing assistance with setting up their own server or even helping them write their own new extensions to the game. From IRC, we administer network operations for the approximate 18638 registered player base and for the tens of thousands of unregistered players that engage in more than 10000 daily player sessions across more than 250 public servers. As we are a globally distributed network-oriented game, we also maintain the public server listings, provide player tracking, network statistics, global authentication, user and group management, abuse and ban controls, player conflict resolution, competitive league management, and user community support.\n\nProjects\n\nProposal for the Development of a Graphical BZW 2.0 Editor\n\nby Jude Nelson, mentored by David Trowbridge\n\nRandom level generator plugin for BZFlag\n\nby Kornel Kisielewicz, mentored by Daniel Remenak\n\nHeadless client w/ RoboCode & scripting (for AI)\n\nby Jørgen Pedersen Tjernø, mentored by Christopher Sean Morrison\n\nBazaar\n\nHomepage: http://bazaar-vcs.org/\n\nPreferred License: GNU GPL\n\nBazaar is a free decentralized revision control system.

Moreover, these deep structural similarities can be exploited to transfer methods of analysis and understanding from one field to another. In addition to developing deeper understandings of specific systems, interdisciplinary approaches should help elucidate the general structure and behavior of complex systems, and move us toward a deeper appreciation of the general nature of such systems.\n\nProjects\n\nGridSweeper Extension & Completion\n\nby Ed Baskerville, mentored by Rick Riolo\n\nI-SPOC\n\nby Michael J Bommarito II, mentored by Scott E Page\n\nSeeding the I-SPOC\n\nby Ryan Henderson, mentored by Scott E Page\n\nI-SPOC: Initial Testing and Example SPOCs\n\nby Lucas Teague Cook, mentored by Scott E Page\n\nI-SPOC\n\nby Terrence Charles Stewart, mentored by Rick Riolo\n\nUrbance: An agent-based approach to Architectural Design\n\nby Dawn Thomas, mentored by Rick Riolo\n\nDaisy CMS\n\nHomepage: www.daisycms.org\n\nPreferred License: Apache License, 2.0\n\nDaisy is an open source, Java-based content management system with a two-tier architecture: a Wiki-like editing/management front-end, and a standalone repository server.

Nearly any open source program you use that can play a sequence of video images accompanied by sound is probably using FFmpeg to do so. It can decode the most prominent multimedia formats ever created, whether open or proprietary, and can encode to the most important formats as well. As a novelty, FFmpeg can also decode a vast array of impossibly obscure multimedia formats and remains essential for legacy multimedia files (no codec is too old or obscure for this project). Anecdotally, FFmpeg just might be the leading multimedia processing library in existence, as many proprietary applications use it as well (as permitted by the LGPL license). There are many stealth uses as well. YouTube does not advertise how their backend conversion software operates. However, independent, empirical research has demonstrated that YouTube uses FFmpeg to convert videos.\n\nProjects\n\nRV40 decoder\n\nby Kostyantin Sergiyovich Shishkov, mentored by Michael Melanson\n\nMatroska Muxer for libavformat\n\nby David Robert Conrad, mentored by Aurelien Jacobs\n\nVideo Filter API\n\nby Robert Bingham, mentored by Benjamin Larsson\n\nE-AC3 Decoder\n\nby Bartlomiej Wolowiec, mentored by Justin Ben Ruggles\n\nThe JPEG2000 deocder and encoder\n\nby Kamil Nowosad, mentored by Loren Merritt\n\nDirac encoder and decoder\n\nby Marco Gerards, mentored by Luca Ugo Maria Barbato\n\nApplying for the soc programme of ffmpeg\n\nby Xiaohui Sun, mentored by Baptiste Coudurier\n\nQCELP decoder\n\nby Reynaldo H.

The FreeBSD Project began 15 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work at Berkeley CSRG with open source revision history going back 30 years to 1978. There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce servers for experimental and third party development (this is also where our summer of code students have worked in previous years). We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, blogs, irc channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary, and allows students to build up and package complete modified FreeBSD operating system CDs/DVDs to distribute as ISOs for testing, for example. Relevance to Google : Google has many tens of thousands of FreeBSD-based devices helping to run its production networks (Juniper, Force10, NetApp, etc..), MacOS X laptops, and the occasional FreeBSD network monitoring or test server. Research in FreeBSD security, networking, and other areas has also regularly been adopted recently and throughout its 30 year history to other open source systems. The most recent example from this month is perhaps the JEMalloc allocator which was introduced in FreeBSD 2 years ago and has recently been imported into the Firefox browser, also widely used at Google. This is an exciting time for FreeBSD as Cisco, Juniper, NetApp, Force10, and many other embedded networking device companies are moving towards FreeBSD (Cisco) or upgrading to more modern FreeBSD releases (6.0/7.0 for all the rest). We are also seeing these companies hire open source liaisons and making a concerted effort to contribute more code back.\n\nProjects\n\nby Andrew Turner, mentored by Joe Marcus Clarke\n\nMulticast DNS responder (BSD-licensed)\n\nby Fredrik Lindberg, mentored by Bruce M.

The tools are designed to work on Linux and other unices. Some of the tools share a link library, and some are stand-alone. In general, users invoke the programs individually from the unix command line (or a desktop icon). However, we are currently developing a \"project manager\" which will tie many of the tools into a common entry point. Amongst the tools in the project are: gschem -- a program used to draw schematic diagrams of circuits. pcb -- a program used to design PCBs (printed circuit boards). gerbv -- a program used to view and validate PCBs. Gnucap -- a program used to analyze and simulate analog circuits (equivalent to SPICE). Icarus Verilog -- a program used in design and analysis of logic circuits. gwave -- a program used to view the output of Gnucap, ngspice, and other circuit simulators. In all, the gEDA Project encompasses around 18 programs which may be used in electronic design.

The current core development group consists of five people, with a further 10-20 people contributing source code, plugins, and other add-ons on a regular basis. The community on www.geeklog.net hovers at around 150 active users, i.e. those that log into the site and participate in discussions. We also have some active international communities in Japan, Germany, Poland, and France. The Japanese community even published a book about Geeklog. While Geeklog may be one of the lesser known CMS, it does power a few high-profile sites, e.g. Groklaw. We also know that it is used quite a bit in company intranets and as a web application framework.\n\nProjects\n\nInstallation Wizard for Geeklog\n\nby Matt West, mentored by Dirk Haun\n\nConfiguration GUI and DB Configuration Backend\n\nby Aaron Blankstein, mentored by Blaine Lang\n\nArticle plugin\n\nby Damien Hodgkin, mentored by Tony Bibbs\n\nWeb services API for Geeklog\n\nby Ramnath R Iyer, mentored by Dirk Haun\n\nGenMAPP\n\nHomepage: http://www.genmapp.org/\n\nPreferred License: Apache License, 2.0\n\nWe are an academically based organization that develops and supports GenMAPP (Gene Map Annotator and Pathway Profiler), a visualization and analysis tool for biological data.

Our research activities are concentrated mainly in digital signal processing, audio engineering, and psycho acoustics, eg. projects in analysis and syntheses of sound and loudness perception. An additional project is the publication series 'Contributions to Electronic Music'. IEM provides technology and know-how to composers and musicians in the creation and realization of their works. Since 1990, IEM has collaborated with guest artists in the production and performance of more than 80 new compositions. In this process, many international partnerships have been established. At IEM, compositions students are trained in musical acoustics, sound synthesis, algorithmic composition, and real-time systems. We have also established an audio engineering curriculum in collaboration with the Technical University in Graz.

We provide several features unique or uncommon amongst wikis: * Rather than inventing yet another simplistic, linear revision control system, ikiwiki uses a standard version control system such as Subversion or Git. You can edit a wiki by committing to your repository, as well as through a traditional web interface. This makes ikiwiki ideal for collaborative software development; just keep your wiki in version control next to your software. You can also take advantage of the features of these systems; for instance, you can keep a local branch of your wiki via Git. * You can turn any set of pages into an inline news feed, complete with RSS and Atom support. You can run your weblog on ikiwiki (and many people do), run a Planet-like aggregator for external feeds, or keep a TODO and bug list with tags for completed items. * ikiwiki provides a wiki compiler, designed to transform your wiki content into a set of static pages. You can then serve these pages as static content. ikiwiki will not fall over during a Slashdotting, because page views don't require the ikiwiki CGI; as long as Apache can keep up, your site will survive. Furthermore, you can choose whether you want to run the ikiwiki CGI for web edits or only handle commits to the underlying version control system; you can even run ikiwiki privately and just manually copy the content to another server. So if you want to put a wiki up on a server without installing any software on that server, try ikiwiki.\n\nProjects\n\nlatex plugin input/output for ikiwiki\n\nby Patrick Winnertz, mentored by Joey Hess\n\nImplement File Upload Functionality and Image Gallery Creation\n\nby Ben Coffey, mentored by Alexander Wirt\n\nWiki WYSIWYG Editor\n\nby Taylor Killian, mentored by Joey Hess\n\nCreating a gallery of a bunch of images\n\nby Arpit Jain, mentored by Alexander Wirt\n\nInkscape\n\nHomepage: http://www.inkscape.org\n\nPreferred License: GNU General Public License (GPL)\n\nThe Inkscape project develops the inkscape SVG editor, one of the best open source drawing programs available for Linux, OSX, Windows, and other platforms.\n\nProjects\n\nText Improvements\n\nby Gail Carmichael, mentored by Richard Hughes\n\nNative PDF import capability based on libpoppler\n\nby Miklós Bálint Erdélyi, mentored by bulia byak\n\nLive path effects in Inkscape\n\nby Johan Engelen, mentored by Aaron Spike\n\n3D box tool for Inkscape\n\nby Maximilian Albert, mentored by bulia byak\n\nUI for SVG Filter Effects\n\nby Nicholas Bishop, mentored by MenTaLguY\n\nRaster Functionality in Inkscape\n\nby Christopher Brown, mentored by Theodore J.
