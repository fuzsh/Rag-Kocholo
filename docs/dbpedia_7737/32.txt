Hello music lovers, I hope some of you find this little project I have been working on helpful. I feel it’s awkward to listen to music from a web browser but I want to share music with my friends on SoundCloud, so I wrote a script to stream from SoundCloud with Amarok:

kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=168467

This is free software under the GNU General Public License (verison 3).

Log in to your account by going to Tools > Log in/out of SoundCloud. RESTART AMAROK AFTER LOGGING IN. You will then see information from your account when the search bar is blank.

Favorite tracks (when logged in) by going to Tools > Favorite/unfavorite Current Track on SoundCloud

Follow artists (when logged in) by going to Tools > Follow/unfollow Current Artist on SoundCloud

Search for an artist entering their name in the search bar

Search for a track by entering 'track ’ in the search bar before the track name

Search for a playlist by entering 'playlist ’ in the search bar before the playlist name

Search for a group by entering 'group ’ in the search bar before the group name

If using Amarok 2.8-git, then you can drag & drop users and groups from the collection tree to the search bar. Doing this in Amarok 2.8 will cause the collection tree to go blank, although you can keep using the script by clearing the search bar
