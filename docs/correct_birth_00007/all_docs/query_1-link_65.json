        "text": "movie news\n\nHoboken is a lot of things, but it is first and foremost, according to the world, Frank Sinatra’s birthplace. It’s impossible to walk through town without feeling the spirit of Ol’ Blue Eyes crooning over your shoulder: there are statues, there are murals, there are parks, and even restaurants named and adorned in his honor. We’re not in the business of absolutes, but we’d guess his mugshot is framed in at least one home on every street. With biopics being the “it” genre of movies this year, it was only a matter of time before a Frank Sinatra biopic emerged in the headlines. The day has finally come, friends. Martin Scorsese is rumored to be directing the project, with Leonardo DiCaprio potentially portraying Sinatra. We have so many questions, but first — the details. Read on to learn more about the Frank Sinatra biopic, rumored to star Leonardo DiCaprio, directed by Martin Scorsese.\n\nPhoto Credit (from left to right): Creative Commons 1, Creative Commons 2, Creative Commons 2\n\nWhat We Know\n\nOn April 17th, Variety reported that Martin Scorsese, despite his age of 81, plans to shoot two films back-to-back: one of those films being a Frank Sinatra biopic.\n\nRead More: The Bear Star, Jeremy Allen White, To Play Bruce Springsteen In Upcoming Film\n\nAccording to the outlet, Scorsese has recruited frequent collaborator Leonardo DiCaprio to portray Frank Sinatra. DiCaprio recently starred in Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, which racked up 10 nominations at this year’s Oscars.\n\nJennifer Lawrence is also slated to appear in the film as Frank Sinatra’s second wife, actress Ava Gardener. Per Variety, Sony is said to be the lead contender for producing the project, though Apple has expressed interest, too.\n\nIt’s worth noting that Tina Sinatra, Frank Sinatra’s daughter, controls Frank Sinatra’s estate and “hasn’t yet given her blessing to the film,” per Variety. That hasn’t stopped Scorsese from drawing up his plans.\n\nWith such preliminary details, it’s unclear what period of Sinatra’s life the movie will center around. Leonardo DiCaprio is 49, but we won’t make this a conversation about Leonardo DiCaprio and age.\n\nThe Sinatra Story\n\nIf you’re not up to date on your Hoboken trivia, Frank Sinatra was born in a cold water flat in Hoboken on December 12th, 1915. (PS: A cold water flat is an apartment without running hot water — common at the time.) He lived in Hoboken until he was 24, when he moved out in 1939 after marrying his first wife, Nancy. The rest, of course, is history: Frank Sinatra went on to become one of the most legendary entertainers of the 20th century.\n\nGiven the ol’ crooner spent a quarter of his life in Hoboken, it’s not unreasonable to assume that the Mile Square City might just make a cameo in the upcoming biopic — especially considering the slew of movies currently using Hudson County as their soundstage. If Martin Scorsese really wants to keep it true-to-tale, we’ve got a few local recommendations that Frank Sinatra was known to frequent, and you can see that list here.\n\nSee More: Montclair on Film — A Rundown of the Movies With Scenes Filmed in Town"
