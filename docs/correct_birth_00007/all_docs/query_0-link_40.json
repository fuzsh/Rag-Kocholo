        "text": "Luck be a lady tonight…Frank Sinatra, renowned American jazz singer, actor, producer {and Hoboken native!} turns 100 this weekend. Hoboken lives and breathes everything Sinatra because Old Blue Eyes’ early success and remarkable career was shaped by his hometown. Hoboken is celebrating his 100th year and commemorating the star in a major way this weekend. There are several exciting and entertaining events going on for people of all ages to celebrate Sinatra and his place in history, and Sinatra fans have a variety of events to choose from. We’ve rounded up 13 of our favorite ways to celebrate Frank Sinatra this weekend:\n\n1. Visit Sinatra’s Hoboken Birthplace\n\nSinatra was born in the upstairs tenement at 415 Monroe Street in Hoboken on December 12, 1915. Though the building itself burned down in 1967, the bronze Frank Sinatra star lies on the sidewalk outside Old Blue Eyes’ place of birth today. This landmark is a remarkable sight to see due to its sheer history, so make sure to snap a photo!\n\n2. Celebrate Sinatra’s Centennial Birthday Party {at Stevens}\n\nHoboken will celebrate Sinatra’s 100th on Saturday December 12 overlooking the New York City skyline at Steven’s Institute of Technology. Sinatra’s music and memory will be celebrated from 7-11 p.m. in the Bissinger Room. Tickets are for sale online while they last, so purchase them today, for this celebration of a lifetime is not something you want to miss!\n\n3. Visit the Scenic Frank Sinatra Park\n\nThe Frank Sinatra Park is a beautiful waterfront park located between 4th and 5th Street Sinatra Drive in Hoboken. It is a waterfront park offering a kayak launch, soccer field, an amphitheater and breathtaking views of Manhattan. Take a stroll and listen to some Sinatra along the way to commemorate one of the most influential artists of the 20th century. You can fly to the moon {or at least see it and New York, New York [see what we did there] from the waterfront}.\n\n4. Have Dinner at Leo’s Grandevous\n\nOne of Frank Sinatra’s favorite hangouts was Leo’s Grandevous, one of Hoboken’s oldest family owned restaurants. Sinatra and Leo were great friends, and his music has been playing in the restaurant since. Nick DePalma is the current owner and Grace Scianalepore manages the tavern, and both are Leo’s grandchildren. Grab a delicious bite and listen to some of the best tunes in history at Leo’s {located at 200 Grand Street} here in Hoboken. Their food is delicious!\n\n5. Eat at Piccolo’s\n\nHome to more Sinatra memorabilia than we know what to do with is Piccolo’s cheesesteak joint, one of Sinatra’s other favorite Hoboken spots to eat back in his day. Established in 1955, Piccolo’s has quality food, friendly clientele, and a blast from the past of old-school Hoboken. Their jukebox is loaded with every Sinatra hit you can think of, so stop by 92 Clinton Street to enjoy fabulous food and music. You know they’ll be playing it!\n\n6. Hoboken Historical Museum’s Sinatra Birthday Celebration & Plaque Dedication\n\nJoin fellow Sinatra fans for free on Saturday December 12 for the dedication of a new Hollywood Boulevard-style plaque. The event will begin at noon and the dedication will be at 1p.m., taking place at the Hoboken Historical Museum {1031 Hudson Street}. In addition, representatives at the Hoboken Post Office have created a special postage stamp and birthday cancellation mark, and will be present to help you send a personalized letter to a fellow Sinatra fanatic on his birthday. Contact the Hoboken Historical Museum at (201) 656-2240 for more information.\n\nREAD: Everything You Need to Know About the Hoboken Historical Museum\n\n7. “Frank Sinatra: The Man, the Voice and the Fans” Exhibit\n\nIn August, the Hoboken Historical Museum opened the “Frank Sinatra: The Man, The Voice and The Fans” commemorative exhibit for the public through July 2016. The gallery consists of photos, videos and displays from Sinatra’s life in Hoboken and monumental career for spectators of all ages. The exhibit is open for viewing Tuesday through Thursday from 2-7 p.m., Fridays from 1-5 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 12-5 p.m. Adults tickets are $4 and kid’s entry is free. Check out the museum’s website for more details.\n\n8. David Lehman’s Talk\n\nDavid Lehman, renowned poet, critic, editor of The Best American Series and fellow Sinatra admirer will be at the Hoboken Historical Museum on Sunday December 13. Lehman will discuss his latest book “Sinatra’s Century: One Hundred Notes on the Man and His World” and why Sinatra inspired him to write this fantastic piece. The event will begin promptly at 4pm at the museum. A great way to spend a Sunday!\n\n9. Take the “Sinatra Self-Guided Walking Tour”\n\nThe Hoboken Historical Museum has crafted the Frank Sinatra Self-Guided Walking Tour, which takes people through Sinatra’s beloved hometown, visiting each one of his favorite spots. His birthplace on Monroe Street where his sidewalk star lies is one of the more than two-dozen stops on the itinerary, of which include places where he performed in addition to his favorite eateries and beyond.\n\n10.

Eat at Blue Eyes’ Restaurant\n\nThe waterfront restaurant named after the namesake will have live music and a Sinatra Performance on Sat! They will also have a set menu for $38.95 {plus tax}, so it will be delicious AND fun. While it’s a newer restaurant that opened last year, the authentic Italian cuisine is out-of-this-world YUM.\n\n12.
