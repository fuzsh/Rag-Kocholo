        "text": "The bronze star that was outside the crooner's boyhood home is now embedded in a wall at the new condo building, for tourists and fans.\n\nHOBOKEN, NJ — A developer did it his way recently, erecting a five-story condominium building at the Hoboken address where famous crooner Frank Sinatra spent his childhood. The new luxury \"Frank's Place\" condominiums pay tribute to the singer with a bronze star embedded in the outside wall (it used to be in the sidewalk), and artistic tributes inside.\n\nBack in 1967, Sinatra's childhood home at 415 Monroe St. — on the west side of town, 15 blocks from the waterfront — was destroyed in a fatal fire. The site remained empty for decades, owned by a retired police officer who used it for parking. At one point, in 1996, a local businessman and fan placed the bronze star in the sidewalk in appreciation of singer. Tourists have stopped off while visiting the mile-square city for its waterfront views and history.\n\nNow the bronze star has ascended a bit higher, although not quite to the moon.\n\nThe developer, Red Bridge Homes, has paid tribute to the singer in other spots in the new building. There's a portrait of Ol' Blue Eyes on a wall inside, and the corridor to the elevator is designated \"My Way.\"\n\nIf you want to see the star\n\nTourists wishing to see the bronze star can take a half-mile walk east from the Hoboken train terminal, approximately 15 blocks, or walk about a quarter mile west from the Hudson Bergen Light Rail Second Street station. Along the way, they'll see hallmarks of the close-knit Italian families who've lived in that area for decades, including small churches, social clubs, and some revered Italian delis.\n\nCondos in the new building have recently sold for more than $1.2 million.\n\nA sign on the windows last month said that three of the seven condos were still available.\n\nThe developer says: \"Built from concrete and steel, these 3- and 4-bedroom homes range in size from 1,198 to nearly 2,000 square feet and include on-site parking.\"\n\nYou can see interiors and a video here.\n\nGot news?
