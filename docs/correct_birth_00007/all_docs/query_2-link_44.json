        "text": "Arts & Entertainment | Hoboken (1915 – 1998)\n\nBorn in Hoboken in 1915, Francis Albert Sinatra became one of New Jersey’s best known celebrities. Singing on radio, records, film, television, and concert stages the world over, “Ol’ Blue Eyes” brought style, sophistication, and unprecedented attention to the finest standards in the Great American Songbook. And, it all began with a four-cent ferry ride from New Jersey to New York City. Sinatra is considered by many as the finest male popular song vocalist of all time, but his list of accomplishments goes well beyond. A believer entertainer for six decades, Sinatra achievements earned him three Oscars, two Golden Globes, 10 personal Grammys (and a total of 21 including those for his albums), an Emmy, a Cecil B. DeMille Award, a Peabody, and he was recognized at the Kennedy Center Honore in 1983. These are only a sampling of the awards and honors that suggest the prominence this New Jersey native son achieved in music, film, television and business. A generous charitable contributor, he was the recipient of the prestigious Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award by the Motion Picture Society of America 1971. The Hoboken post office was renamed in his honor in 2002 He was and remains the single most influential vocalist in the history of American popular music."
