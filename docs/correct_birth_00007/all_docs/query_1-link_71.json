        "text": "By The Associated Press\n\nToday is Saturday, Dec. 12, the 346th day of 2015. There are 19 days left in the year.\n\nToday’s Highlight in History:\n\nOn Dec. 12, 1915, singer-actor Frank Sinatra was born Francis Albert Sinatra in Hoboken, New Jersey.\n\nOn this date:\n\nIn 1787, Pennsylvania became the second state to ratify the U.S. Constitution.\n\nIn 1870, Joseph H. Rainey of South Carolina became the first black lawmaker sworn into the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nIn 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt nominated Oscar Straus to be secretary of Commerce and Labor; Straus became the first Jewish Cabinet member.\n\nIn 1911, Britain’s King George V announced during a visit to India that the capital would be transferred from Calcutta to Delhi.\n\nIn 1917, Father Edward Flanagan founded Boys Town outside Omaha, Nebraska.\n\nIn 1925, the first motel – the Motel Inn – opened in San Luis Obispo, California.\n\nIn 1937, Japanese aircraft sank the U.S. gunboat Panay on China’s Yangtze River. (Japan apologized, and paid $2.2 million in reparations.)\n\nIn 1946, a United Nations committee voted to accept a six-block tract of Manhattan real estate offered as a gift by John D. Rockefeller Jr. to be the site of the U.N.’s headquarters.\n\nIn 1963, Kenya became independent of Britain.\n\nIn 1975, Sara Jane Moore asked a federal court in San Francisco to allow her to plead guilty to trying to kill President Gerald R. Ford. (After the judge ruled Moore competent to change her plea, she was sentenced to life. Moore was released on parole on New Year’s Eve 2007 after serving 32 years behind bars.)\n\nIn 1985, 248 American soldiers and eight crew members were killed when an Arrow Air charter crashed after takeoff from Gander, Newfoundland.\n\nIn 2000, George W. Bush became president-elect as a divided U.S. Supreme Court reversed a state court decision for recounts in Florida’s contested election.\n\nTen years ago: California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger refused to block the imminent execution of Stanley Tookie Williams, rejecting the notion that the founder of the murderous Crips gang had atoned for his crimes and found redemption on death row."
