Prior to World War II, singers are typically used to draw attention to the bands, not the other way around. When the war breaks out, it becomes too costly to take full orchestras out on the road and, with Sinatra kept out of service due to a birth injury, the crooner's career explodes on the home front. \"Frank contributed to the death knell of the big bands,\" explains Charles Pignone, Senior Vice President of Frank Sinatra Enterprises. \"He was the first singer that really came out of the bands into prominence.\" Sinatra inks a deal with Columbia Records and becomes a huge idol among the teenage bobby soxers of the 1940's with a series of lush hits arranged by Axel Stordahl. A career lull in the early '50s necessitates a move to Las Vegas, where Sinatra and his Rat Pack pals take over the casino scene with their impromptu live shows. By 1953, the singer's career is officially revitalized on the big screen when he earns an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in From Here To Eternity. A new deal at Capitol Records pairs Sinatra with arranger Nelson Riddle results in a series of concept albums, starting with the introspective In The Wee Small Hours (1955) – often cited as one of the very first concept albums - that boasts the crooner's maturing sound and solidifies his reputation as a master interpreter. Shortly after the release of the chart-topping Nice 'N Easy in 1960, Sinatra starts his own label, Reprise Records, and over the next two decades releases some of the most enduring hits of his career, including \"That's Life,\" \"Strangers In The Night,\" \"My Way,\" and \"New York, New York.\" At the time of his death from a heart attack in 1998, Sinatra leaves a legacy of 59 studio albums, 2 live albums, 297 singles, and dozens of film roles. Artists from various genres cite the crooner as a major influence - from Motown stars Stevie Wonder and Gladys Knight, country singers Willie Nelson and George Strait, rock icons Chrissie Hynde and Bono, rap moguls Jay-Z and Sean Combs, pop stars Robbie Williams and Lady Gaga, and modern-day contemporaries Michael Buble and Harry Connick, Jr. - proving his legacy knows no bounds.\n\nCategories\n\nBirths"
