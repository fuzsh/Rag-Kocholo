        "text": "FRANK SINATRA, the legendary singer, actor and entertainer, was born in 1915, and raised in Hoboken, New Jersey. Sinatra was gifted, generous, wounded and dangerous — an innovator, and a survivor. He learned how to make his voice both tender and tough and helped millions of Italian-Americans feel proud of who they were.\n\nSinatra was the son of Martin Sinatra, a quiet Hoboken fireman and boxer, and Dolly Sinatra, a talented, gutsy, headstrong woman who ran the house, was an important figure in ward politics, and wanted the world for her only child. She adored him and also tried to control him. Boxing gyms in those days were run by the Irish and when Martin Sinatra boxed, he found it useful to call himself “Marty O’Brien.”\n\nBut the Sinatras and many other Italians resented this playacting, this pretending not to be Italian. Frank was raised with a sense that the world was tilted against Italians, and you don’t accept that, you fight it. There were a lot of Italian mobsters around in Sinatra’s childhood and he admired them. As stubborn and loud as he could be in certain moods, around mob guys he was quiet, observing. Bing Crosby was another influence on Sinatra for the relaxed way he had, crooning instead of shouting. Sinatra’s singing had in it both toughness and restraint. Frank liked to dress well, and his friends sometimes called him “Slacksy O’Brien” for the fancy pants he wore and “Slats” because he was so thin.\n\nFrank joined a singing group called “The Hoboken Four” and in 1935 they won first prize in a nationally syndicated show called the Major Bowes Amateur Hour. The places to sing in Hoboken then were joints like The Crystal, Tutty’s, and The Cat’s Meow — saloons, ballrooms and social clubs that would pay a local group a few bucks for live entertainment. In 1936, Frank was thrilled to have a 15-minute radio show on a local station, WAAT. By 1939, Frank was singing in Tommy Dorsey’s band. He rose as a crooner beloved by women, with a voice of gentle yearning. He was a teen idol but there were a lot of Italian crooners in those days: Jerry Vale, Vic Damone, Jimmy Roselli. Frank Sinatra hadn’t yet established himself as one of the greats.\n\nOn February 4th, 1939, he married Nancy Barbato at Our Lady of Sorrows Catholic church in Jersey City. They’d been dating for seven years. Their oldest two children, Nancy, Jr. and Frank, Jr., were born while the family lived in a small Jersey City apartment. Later, a third child was born, Tina. Nancy was a sweet, intelligent woman, and an excellent cook. She adored Frank and he relied on her constancy.\n\nIn the 1940’s, Frank moved the family out to Los Angeles, wanting to get into movies. Sinatra had a sharp eye for talent and hypocrisy, and a tendency to be overly blunt about the second-rate people who clung to their positions in Hollywood: the B actors and actresses, the children of the famous, the minor English aristocrats.\n\nAs soon as he got out on the road, Sinatra saw how badly black performers were treated. Early on, when it did his career no favors, he was an outspoken advocate for equal rights for “Negroes.” And not just in theory — he would walk into a club and demand that his black friends or colleagues be served at the bar. In 1968, when Martin Luther King was shot and killed, Frank Sinatra cried.\n\nIn 1945, Frank had his first real movie role, in the romantic musical comedy “Anchors Away.” He played Gene Kelly’s buddy, two likeable sailors out to have a good time in Hollywood. He danced a little and smiled a lot. When that movie was popular, Hollywood cast Kelly and Sinatra in “On the Town” (1949) skirt-chasing sailors again, now on leave in New York City. The movie’s opening song “New York, New York” became a mainstay of Sinatra’s concerts.\n\nIn 1950, Sinatra’s career took a dive. He lost his voice, and lost his recording contract. In 1951, Mitch Miller got Sinatra and Dagmar, a blond bombshell from West Virginia, to duet on the novelty song “Mama Will Bark.” It’s painful to listen to that song, to realize how far Sinatra had fallen. Also in 1951, he and Nancy divorced, after Frank’s affair with Ava Gardner became public. But Frank and Nancy remained quite friendly.\n\nFrank was very loyal — and insisted on loyalty in return. People stayed Frank’s friends for years. Bill Miller, for instance, was playing the piano at the Desert Inn in Vegas in 1951 when Sinatra came by and asked if Miller wanted to play with him. Miller said simply “Yeah” — and he played with Sinatra until Miller was 91 years old and had to be brought to the piano in a wheelchair. When there were hundreds of “better” piano players eager to play in Sinatra’s band, Sinatra stuck with Bill Miller — because Miller had been faithful when Sinatra was down.\n\nAnyway, piano-playing technique wasn’t the most important thing to Sinatra. He admired Bill Miller’s perfect sense for how a tinkling piano sounds in a saloon, as Sinatra would sing:\n\n“It’s quarter to three\n\nThere’s no one in the place except you and me\n\nSo, set’em up, Joe\n\nI got a little story\n\nI think you oughta know…’\n\nHis flame Ava Gardner helped him get a part in the film “From Here to Eternity” and Sinatra made the most of it; he won the 1953 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. By 1953, his voice had recovered, too and he released “Songs for Young Lovers” and in 1954 “Swing Easy.” But things were not swinging with Frank and Ava. His best arranger, Nelson Riddle, once said: “Ava taught him how to sing a torch song. She taught him the hard way.”\n\nSinatra and Ava Gardner kept in touch through the years but whenever Frank saw Ava he was desperate to get back with her, and she could feel it — and taste it, if she let him kiss her. Ava thought of Frank Sinatra as a gifted, wayward son, a man to be kind to, but wary of. Ava never doubted she’d done the right thing breaking up with this tormented guy. Whereas, to Sinatra, Ava was the love of his life, his grand passion, the one who got away. The two of them splitting up never made sense to him. It was wrong; it was unfair. Deep in her heart, he was sure Ava still loved him. And Frank had a lot of charm, a lot of friends, a lot of talent, time and money to invest. Somehow, Frank was sure he’d find a way to get Ava back, in love with him again.\n\nIn 1955, Sinatra released a great album: “In the Wee Small Hours.” Only the title song was new, but Sinatra made all of the songs his. In an era when people focused on making singles, Sinatra crafted an entire album on the theme of lost love. His band called it “The Ava Album” and Sinatra poured into it all of the passion he had for Ava, but gave it the fidelity and respect that he couldn’t give Ava. If his voice was not exactly right, he stopped and the others waited until he was ready.\n\nThey were night sessions in an intimate little studio, that began at 8 p.m. and went until Sinatra said they were done. He was a romantic and a night owl and he made every member of the band feel the importance of what they were doing. So much talent, so beautifully crafted and restrained. Listening to “In the Wee Small Hours” at night can create a mood that lingers for days.\n\nAnd Sinatra’s next album, “Only the Lonely” (1958) was even better. “Only the Lonely”, “What’s New?” and “Blues in the Night” are some of the greatest unrequited love songs ever recorded. “One For My Baby” which Sinatra had recorded twice before, he returned to for a third go, and did it better. Sinatra stretched out the “o” in “lonely,” or “cold” to make it lonelier, colder. He stretched out the “e” in “me” to make it more personal. He was a master of tone and pace and phrasing, and he had that gorgeous voice, and you heard the record and were actually glad to be unhappy. As Sinatra liked to say: “When you’re sad, there’s a song that does your crying for you.”\n\nSinatra was good friends with the comedian Don Rickles, and loved his insult humor. One night Rickles came over to Sinatra in a restaurant and begged him, very seriously, to come over to Don’s table and say hello. Rickles said he had a chick that he just had to impress and she didn’t believe Rickles when he said Frank Sinatra was a friend.\n\nSo later in the evening, Sinatra got up and went over to the table. “Hi, Don” he said with a warm smile.\n\n“Can’t you see I’m eating, Frank!” said Rickles. “Come on, get out of here!” Sinatra walked away, doubled over in laughter.\n\nSinatra needed a rhythm section — not just on stage but in life. Ava Gardner meant the most to him, but Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Jimmy Van Heusen… When Frank was tanned and happy, holding court in a place he felt at ease, looking forward, instinctive, into everything that was happening, you had to be happy right along with him. Lauren Bacall adored his phone calls, that amazing voice expressing so much humor, sensitivity, and concern.\n\nBut when Frank was angry, he made everyone around him miserable. When he got mean-drunk, even good friends learned to leave him alone. Harry Belafonte remembers Sinatra at the baccarat table in a casino: “Frank would start out cool, though even then you sensed his lethal edge.” Lauren Bacall felt Sinatra wanted her to keep him off-balance. Sometimes in one of those moods, Sinatra would pop somebody in a nightclub or on the sidewalk, and the tabloids would run their grainy photos and the columnists would slam Sinatra as a bad influence on American youth.\n\nSinatra fell out of fashion for his liberal views on race, his cruelties to women and to reporters. Dorothy Kilgallen was one columnist who seemed to take special pleasure in slamming Frank Sinatra in her column. In return, Sinatra called Kilgallen “the chinless wonder.”\n\nSinatra liked John Kennedy, and was proud of having helped him get elected President in 1960. But Sinatra couldn’t stand Robert Kennedy, and it was mutual. And when Sinatra’s mob ties became more public, the Kennedys distanced themselves from Sinatra, and Frank was furious — he made it a point to always go TOWARD his friends when they got in trouble, offering protection and reassurance. But, of course, Frank didn’t have to run for re-election.\n\nAround 1963, Frank Sinatra Jr., at 19, decided to try to make it as a professional singer. Only a few months into his career he was kidnapped, and some creeps spread the word that it was a stunt, staged to promote Frank Jr.’s career. He was held for four days before being released. It was a scary time for the whole Sinatra family — the dark side of fame and fortune.\n\nIn 1965, Sinatra cut “September of My Years” his last great album. With the world going crazy for the Beatles and rock’n’roll, Sinatra took an Ervin Drake song done by the Kingston Trio called “It Was A Very Good Year” and made it a classic. Frank’s voice sounded older but it fit the music, fit the theme. The arrangement and the musicians around him were sterling, and that great voice did the rest.\n\nSinatra met Mia Farrow and in 1966 impulsively asked her to marry him. Frank was 52, and Mia was 23. What the hell’s going on, said some of Frank’s best friends. Who is this dame? Why tie the knot? Frank’s mother Dolly said: ‘She’s so skinny, she looks like she’s going to blow away.’ Frank and Mia’s marriage was strange from the first. The singer was 52 years old and remembered the bread lines of the Great Depression, and remembered being poor himself. The actress was 23, and had never suffered a day of poverty or seen the country suffer. Mia acted like a hippie and to Frank hippies were the scourge of the earth. Plus, Frank could see hypocrisy a mile away and he saw Mia talking all this hippy shit about ‘not striving, just being’ — yet here she was reading movie scripts 12 hours a day, always calling her agent and plotting her career.\n\nOne reason Frank wanted to marry Mia was to show her the ropes, help her understand the country and how it worked, introduce her to some people… When they met, there were stars in her eyes, and she said she liked politics and wanted to learn about it. Frank was disappointed when she’d say: ‘I give my opinion, you give yours. If we agree, great. If not, that’s cool.’ She liked all this psychobabble abut all opinions being equally valid.\n\nFrank was all through having children. Why would he want more children? He had Nancy and Tina and Frank, Jr. — and Frank Jr. had just been kidnapped three years before. Frank didn’t want any more Sinatra children having to grow up in the shadow of that kidnapping. But Mia badly wanted to have children.\n\nAnd Mia didn’t eat! Not even good Italian food! It was just plain screwy. How can you keep up your strength if you don’t eat? And doesn’t it taste good? Doesn’t it smell good? The feeling around a big dinner table was always something Frank loved: the kids all wolfing it down with greedy smiles, the jokes, everyone having fun. A sense of plenty, a chance to be generous to others who didn’t have it so good, maybe bring someone to the table whose career was in the toilet through no fault of his own, or a couple of people who hadn’t been lucky enough to have been born Italian.\n\nAnd then there was drugs. Mia was no pothead — Frank had had her checked out by people who knew. But she was very tolerant of marijuana, and even some of the harder stuff that was coming along behind it. One thing Frank knew for sure: pot was softening up America, and hard drugs could ruin America if we didn’t wake up and stop it. Frank and Mia couldn’t agree about music, either. Frank loved his jazz, his Billie Holiday, his Puccini and Tony Bennett records. Mia liked — the Beatles! Four long-haired guys from England who pushed Frank and his friends off the pop charts and went around boasting that their songs were drug-inspired.\n\nTo top it off, Frank figured he knew a lot more about movies than Mia did, and more than a lot of the so-called Hollywood sophisticates did. So while Mia was excited about starring in a weirdo flick called “Rosemary’s Baby” about the devil walking the earth, Frank knew he was making a much better movie, the one the American people would love. Frank’s film was called “The Detective” and it was about tough good guys fighting tough bad guys. But when the two movies were released, “The Detective” bombed and “Rosemary’s Baby” became a runaway hit. Mia should have known to not mention that, but instead she tried to comfort Frank which only made him feel like a charity case. Very soon after that, the marriage was over.\n\nAs time went on, Sinatra become popular again — this time with a more conservative and male crowd. They loved it when he sang “My Way” — no song ever expressed quite so well that stubborn masculine insistence that we don’t need help or sympathy.\n\nFrank Sinatra was a neat freak who might trash a hotel room if he felt disrespected by management or by a woman. He was a masterful singer about gentle, unrequited yearning but a man with a ferocious sexual appetite. Sinatra was a wonderful, loyal friend: generous with his time, his money, his good humor. But he could cut an old friend out of his life for making a single mistake. He held grudges, proudly. He cultivated his grudges.\n\nFrank Sinatra went on “The Larry King Show” at the end of Sinatra’s life, and gave a good interview — but what stayed with Larry King, what moved and depressed King was Sinatra saying, “All my friends are gone.” It seemed to King an incredibly sad statement.\n\nIn 1993, Linda Ronstadt jumped at the chance to sing with Frank. She knew his voice was in decline and asked Rosemary Clooney about him, and Clooney said: “Darling, he’s still dangerous.” Sinatra and Ronstadt sang a duet: “ Moonlight in Vermont.” Ronstadt said later that Frank’s voice had clearly lost something — “but I was astounded at how much story he could still deliver and how much color was there.”\n\nFrank continued singing concerts even when he couldn’t always remember the words to songs he’d been singing for 40 years, and relied on a TelePrompter for the lyrics. It was very hard to leave the stage. Tom Dreesen, an actor and comedian who was a protégé of Sinatra and often traveled with him, used to wonder when “Mr. S.” would stop performing. One night, Sinatra completely forgot the words to a song and kept muttering into the microphone: “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.” The orchestra stopped playing. The huge arena fell into an eerie silence, except for these plaintive apologies from a man who was used to strutting the stage.\n\nThen from somewhere high up in the arena, one guy yelled out “It’s okay, Frank. We love you!” and started to clap. People around him joined him in clapping and pretty soon the whole area was roaring. When the crowd finally settled down again, Sinatra went ripping into his next song, “Mack the Knife,” and Dreesen said he’d never heard Sinatra better, all the nuance was there, and all the notes hit just right. Between songs, Sinatra looked up at the balcony and said “I love you, too, pal.”\n\nHe went on singing concerts for two more years after that. The crowds were forgiving if he flubbed some lyrics. They had come not to judge whether he was in top form or not, but to say goodbye. Don Rickles kidded him about his forgetting (“Frank’s got Sicilian Alzheimer’s. He’s forgotten everything but the grudges.”)\n\nOn May 14, 1998, Sinatra died of a heart attack, at the age of 82. His last words were: “I’m losing.” At the church funeral in Los Angeles, television trucks were there. Cameras were everywhere, and reporters on rooftops, looking down on it all. Sinatra’s family and friends like Kirk Douglas and Don Rickles arrived at the church. A crowd of protesters gathered on the other side of the street, angry with Frank about various things, and determined to mar his funeral.\n\nAs the funeral service ended, Bruce Springsteen stood for a moment with Jack Nicholson on the steps of the church. Nicholson turned to Springsteen and said simply of Sinatra: “King of New Jersey.”\n\nThere were no trust funds set up for Sinatra’s children. It was a rich estate, but not super rich. His daughter Nancy decided that was better; it meant that her dad had given most of his money away, often to show business friends who’d badly needed it. Frank Jr. continued touring the world singing his father’s songs but never had a hit record, a hit movie or a hit TV show, and would say: “To my way of thinking, that means success has not been achieved.”\n\nThe apartment house at 415 Monroe Street where Sinatra was born burned down in 1967. The house next door, #417, once a candy store, is now a Sinatra museum. Hoboken has a Frank Sinatra Park on the waterfront, and every summer since 2007 there’s been an amateur singing contest in the park, modeled on “American Idol” — called “Sinatra Idol” in which contestants sing only Sinatra songs.\n\nSinatra has been remembered by hundreds of friends and written about by writers of the caliber of Pete Hamill and Gay Talese. All of them turn over corners of the man. No one knew him all.\n\nSinatra’s producer Jack Schlatter said Sinatra’s two favorite words were “Jack” and “Daniels” — and his two LEAST favorite words were: “Take two.”"
