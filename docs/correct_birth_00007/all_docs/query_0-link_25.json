        "text": "Before singer Frank Sinatra became a global household name, he was a local boy from a small New Jersey town across the river from Manhattan.\n\nIn that town — Hoboken — a street is named after him, and to celebrate Sinatra’s 100th birthday anniversary, Hoboken’s museum has him on proud display.\n\nRobert Foster, Executive Director of the Hoboken Historical Museum, said fans visit from as far away as Brazil and France who used to listen to Sinatra on the radio when they were growing up.\n\n“They always love the message of his music, they always felt connected to his voice,” he said.\n\nA part of the exhibit is dedicated to Sinatra’s fans. In the times predating the Internet and social media, Sinatra admirers wrote letters to each other and to the singer, and even dedicated poems to him. They did not care that Sinatra never graduated from high school, that he lacked a music education, and could not read music.\n\nAn immigrant story\n\nSinatra’s velvety baritone brought him glamour and fame in New York and Hollywood, where he won numerous Grammys and an Oscar. His success is an immigrant story.\n\n“He was growing up Italian at a time when Italians were still new to this country,” said Forster. “So, he would talk about discrimination against Italians.”"
