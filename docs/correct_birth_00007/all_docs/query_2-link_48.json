        "text": "(1915–98). The term bobby-soxers was first used in 1943–44 to identify the young audiences who sighed, squealed, sobbed, and swooned over Frankie Boy—the original teen idol. Part of Frank Sinatra’s appeal then was his vulnerable, slouchy look, and part was his way of caressing a lyric. He bent his voice like a trombone to develop an intimate style of provocative slurs and eccentric phrasing. Known to different generations as The Voice, Ol’ Blue Eyes, and Chairman of the Board, he was a superstar for more than five decades.\n\nFrancis Albert Sinatra was born on Dec. 12, 1915, in Hoboken, N.J., the only child of Martin Sinatra and Natalie (Garavante) Sinatra, both native Italians. Sinatra briefly worked as a copy boy for a local newspaper before he decided to pursue a singing career. He began singing in amateur shows in 1933 and formed a musical group, the Hoboken Four. By 1938 Sinatra was touring with a traveling radio show and performing at clubs and roadhouses. Bandleader Harry James discovered Sinatra’s act at the Rustic Cabin in New Jersey in 1939. Their best recording together, “All or Nothing at All”, did not become a hit until after the singer’s solo career took off four years later.\n\nDuring 1940–42 Sinatra developed his style with trombonist Tommy Dorsey’s band. As a gifted interpreter of popular standards, Sinatra was highly sensitive to the lyrics of the songs he sang. Exquisitely long phrases and delicate nuance of emotion distinguished his trademark style. Sinatra’s popularity grew with such hits as “I’ll Never Smile Again”, “Night and Day”, “This Love of Mine”, and “There Are Such Things”. Once drawing mainly young audiences, Sinatra gained a cross-generational following through an engagement with the Benny Goodman orchestra at New York City’s Paramount Theater in 1942–43. These landmark performances marked the launch of Sinatra’s career as a solo artist. From 1943 to 1945 Sinatra was the lead singer on the radio program Your Hit Parade and began recording for Columbia Records.\n\nSinatra made his motion-picture debut in the 1943 musical Higher and Higher. He would go on to play diverse roles in more than 50 films. He won his first Academy award in 1945 for the patriotic short subject The House I Live In. Suffering from severely damaged vocal chords, Sinatra hit a low point in his career in the early 1950s. From Here to Eternity (1953), based on James Jones’s best-selling novel about United States servicemen in Hawaii on the eve of World War II, brought Sinatra an Oscar for best supporting actor and helped revitalize his slumping career. He was nominated for best actor for The Man with the Golden Arm (1955). Other films included Suddenly (1954), Pal Joey (1957), The Manchurian Candidate (1962), The Detective (1968), and The First Deadly Sin (1980). Throughout the 1960s Sinatra made comedies with fellow members of the high-living show-business clique nicknamed the Rat Pack, which included Dean Martin and Sammy Davis, Jr. These films included Ocean’s Eleven (1960) and Robin and the Seven Hoods (1964). Sinatra also made numerous appearances on television.\n\nAfter his first marriage, to childhood sweetheart Nancy Barbato, ended in divorce, Sinatra married actress Ava Gardner in 1951. The marriage was tempestuous, and they separated and eventually divorced in 1957. Sinatra staged a comeback as a recording artist in 1953 when he left Columbia Records for Capitol Records and began collaborating with conductor-arranger Nelson Riddle. Riddle’s up-tempo arrangements showcased Sinatra’s new “swinging” style, which was both more aggressive and alluring. Up against immensely popular rock and roll musicians of the era, Sinatra scored hits with the albums In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin’ Lovers (1956), and Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely (1958). Come Dance With Me! (1959) won Sinatra his first Grammy awards, for album of the year and best male vocal performance.\n\nIn 1960 Sinatra founded the record label Reprise Records. His singing style continued to evolve, growing brasher and punchier. The album September of My Years (1965) won Grammy awards for album of the year and best male vocal performance. In 1966 A Man and His Music was voted album of the year, and “Strangers in the Night” became a number-one single. With hit songs such as “That’s Life” (1966) and “My Way” (1969), Sinatra drew sold-out crowds to Madison Square Garden and the Forum in Los Angeles, Calif. He also performed in Las Vegas, Nev., as did his fellow Rat Packers. Actress Mia Farrow and Sinatra were married in 1966; they divorced two years later."
