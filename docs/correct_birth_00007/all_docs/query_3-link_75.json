        "text": "Frank Sinatra is, of course, a treasure to generations of New Jerseyans who beam over being born in the same state as Ol’ Blue Eyes, a Hoboken native.\n\nMy relationship to Sinatra is a bit different — though perhaps no less intimate. As a teenager growing up in Damascus, Syria — 6,000 miles from the Chairman’s stomping grounds — his music was my refuge, a lens into another world not so stifled by an authoritarian regime and lack of liberties. Through classics like “Come Fly with Me,” “I’ve Got you Under my Skin,” and “The Way you Look Tonight,” I was able to escape to a place that was more serene and fun."
