Frank Sinatra's hometown in New Jersey honored the music icon with a brand-new statue.\n\nThe life-size bronze statue of the Hollywood legend was unveiled by Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla Sunday afternoon at the Sinatra Park Amphitheater.\n\n\"It is truly a great honor to unveil this ode to Hoboken's own Frank Sinatra,\" Mayor Bhalla said. \"This will not only memorialize him, but also the impact he has had on the City of Hoboken, its residents, and American society.\n\nThe statue is courtesy of sculptor Carolyn Palmer, who has also created statues of Lucille Ball, Eleanor and Franklin Roosevelt and several popes.\n\n\"It is truly an honor to try and capture the magic of Sinatra,\" Palmer said. \"His music and work is so inspiring and lives on. Having been loved by everyone, this sculpture means the world to me.\"\n\nThe monumental figure is depicted in a three-piece suit leaning against a flickering lamp post with his hat tipped to one side.\n\nThose who look closely will also see Sinatra wearing his pinky ring, as Sinatra's daughter Tina Sinatra, sent one of her father's rings to Palmer to incorporate in the sculpture.\n\nJoe Piscipo emceed the ceremony.\n\nALSO READ | Exclusive: Sade goes one-on-one with Dr. Jill Biden during first holiday season as First Lady\n\nIt also featured a performance by the Frank Sinatra School of the Arts.\n\nSunday would have been Sinatra's 106th birthday.\n\n----------\n\n* Get Eyewitness News Delivered\n\n* More New Jersey news\n\n* Send us a news tip\n\n* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts\n\n* Follow us on YouTube"
