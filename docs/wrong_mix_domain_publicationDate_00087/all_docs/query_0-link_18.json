        "text": "Book Review: An Incomplete Education — Liberal Arts with Snark\n\nIt says “Book Reviews” in the header of Wickersham’s Conscience, but it turns out to have been over a year since WC wrote a blog post reviewing a book. WC apologizes for the oversight. An Incomplete Education, by Judy Jones and William Wilson, is in its Third Edition, and now runs to some 700 pages.…\n\nYou’ll get pie in the sky when you die\n\nFor this Labor Day, WC offers a re-post of an August 2011 blog post. A book review of a biography of Joe Hill, a martyr of the early days of the labor movement.The first song WC learned to play on the harmonica was “I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night,” the labor organizing anthem…\n\nAn Exaltation of Larks, by James Lipton (Updated)\n\nA very good friend of WC’s recently offered some mild criticism of collective nouns, specifically “a murder of crows.” WC’s friend offered the criticism in the context of his excellent photos of American Crows with shadows suggesting prison bars. WC determined to respond with a discussion of the definitive treatment of collective nouns, James Lipton’s…\n\nReview: Existence, by David Brin\n\nWC likes much of David Brin’s writing, both his science fiction and his non-fiction. But sometimes even the best author produces a clunker. This is a review WC wrote for Amazon back in 2012.1 WC offers this review because, as a reader who stumbled on it points out, it’s a decent example of WC’s approach…\n\nReview: A Life with Footnotes, by Rob Wilkins\n\nFor more than 15 years, Rob Wilkins worked as the late Sir Terry Pratchett’s personal assistant. Outside of Pratchett’s immediate family, no one knew Sir Terry better. More than seven years after Pratchett’s death in 2015, Wilkins has finished the autobiography that Pratchett started and didn’t or couldn’t complete. The last hundred pages are wrenching,…\n\nTwo Approaches to Teaching Geology\n\nWC has read two lay geology books recently, and the contrast in their approaches to the rocky science is itself instructive. Both are fine examples of cogent, readable explanation of geology, in this case the geology of the Great Basin. The first is Frank DeCourten’s The Great Basin Seafloor, which is a geologic history of…\n\nOh God. Another Dinner with Rodin: Journey to the Abyss, Part 2\n\nClear back in June 2012, WC posted a partial review of an edited collection of Harry Kessler’s diaries, translated from the German by Laird Easton, the author of a 2002 Kessler biography. Easton assembled and translated a large selection of those diaries to English, titling them Journey to the Abyss: The Diaries of Count Harry…\n\nRemembering Molly Ivins (1944-2007)\n\n(This is a part of an eclectic, sometime series on writers and artists WC has known and doesn’t want forgotten. The first post in this series was on Steve Goodman. The second was on Sir Terry Pratchett. WC has also written about Laura Nyro, Bill Berry, Jo Ann Wold and Boudleaux and Felice Bryant. Here’s…\n\nRevisiting Earthsea\n\nEarthsea is the world invented by the late Ursula K. LeGuin. Across five decades, five novels and a volume of short stories and essays, she created one of the most memorable, self-consistent and vivid imaginary universes in literature. LeGuin, in her lifetime, earned eight Hugos, six Nebulas, and twenty-two Locus Awards, and in 2003 became the second woman…\n\nWC’s Summer Reading List\n\nFor WC and, WC suspects, most of his readers, these are not happy times. Between the lunatics running the asylum, the baking hot consequences of climate change, Putin’s vanity war in Ukraine and the latest surge of the pandemic, it might just be time to escape into a good book. WC has some recommendations, none…\n\nRemembering SFBC\n\nTechnically, the Science Fiction Book Club is still around, even if it’s a pitiful, feeble shell of what it was. But WC is getting ahead of his story. In 1976, in response to a mail solicitation (“Get Three Books for Free!”), WC joined the Science Fiction Book Club. It was owned by Doubleday then, but…\n\nBook Review: The Boat of a Million Years, by Poul Anderson\n\nPoul Anderson (1926-2001) was one of science fiction and fantasy’s best known, most-honored and most-prolific authors. Across his dozens of books he wrote well, if not wonderfully, and created characters that were credible, flawed, struggling and endlessly inventive. Today he would be regarded as more than a little sexist, but he did write novels and…\n\nBook Review: The Well At the World’s End, by William Morris\n\nWilliam Morris (1834-1896) is almost unknown today. A polymath, maybe the last Renaissance Man, he was a painter, a philosopher, a poet, a politician, a translator, an interior architect, a graphics designer and a novelist. It wasn’t just that he did all these things; it’s that he was terrific at all of them. As just…\n\nBook Review: The Magic of Terry Pratchett, by Marc Burrows\n\nWC has a sad. Not just because his favorite writer and candidate for Best Human on the Planet died back in 2015, and WC is still grieving. After all, Sir Terry Pratchett left us some 60-plus books. Not just because of how Sir Terry died, robbed by post-cortical atrophy – a variety of dementia –…\n\nBook Review: In Wild Trust, by Jeff Fair and Larry Aumiller\n\n1995 was the luckiest year in WC’s life. Not only did Mrs. WC agree to marry and in fact tie the knot with WC; we also won a permit to view the bears at McNeil River. McNeil River State Game Sanctuary hosts the largest gathering of brown bears in North America. As many as 80…\n\nBook Review: Bag Man, by Rachel Maddow and Michael Yarvitz\n\nLaw school in 1973, Criminal Procedure class, taught by Prof. Fred “Freddy the Cop” Inbau. Near the end of one day’s class, a student asked, “Prof. Inbau, is Agnew guilty?” Inbau: “You should know by now that ‘Guilty’ is a decision for the finder of fact. I will say that the evidence against Agnew is…\n\nBook Review: Alaska in the Progressive Age, by Thomas Alton\n\nThe late Ernest Gruening, former Alaska territorial governor, former U.S. Senator and a prolific author, wrote one of the first histories of Alaska. He broke the volume into periods. Those periods included: “The Era of Total Neglect (1867-1884),” “The Era of Flagrant Neglect (1884-1898),” “The Era of Mild But Enlightened Interest (1898-1912)” and “The Era…\n\nWelcome to Mordor!\n\nSince Mordor was opened to tourism in February 2020 – the arrival of COVID-19 was likely but not certainly a coincidence – it’s become a popular destination for those folks wanting to escape from the pandemic and yet be reasonably safe from infection by the virus. Mordor, of course, is all about social distancing. WC…\n\nThis Guy Named Paarfi\n\nSteven Brust is one of WC’s very favorite authors. He might be the best fantasy writer in the genre today; certainly among the most durable. His first novel, Jhereg, came out in 1983. About a third of Brust’s work is written in the style of Alexander Dumas. And the plots of those novels loosely follow some…\n\nDealing with Quarantine: Brewer’s Dictionary\n\nThe late Terry Pratchett wrote the Foreword to the 16th Edition of Brewer’s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable. He said, It was my introduction to mythology and ancient history and a lot more, too, because Brewer’s is a serendipitous (see page 1063) book. In other words, you might not find what you are looking for, but…\n\nThe 110th Anniversary of Mark Twain’s Death\n\nSamuel Langhorne Clemens, a/k/a Mark Twain, had a huge influence on WC as a young man. In particular his later works, stuff like The Mysterious Stranger, “The Man Who Corrupted Hadleyburg,” Letters from Earth and A Pen Warmed Up in Hell have an obvious impact on WC’s writing even today. Twain’s critical essay on James Fenimore Cooper, “Cooper’s Literary…\n\nDealing with Quarantine: Project Gutenberg\n\nIdaho Governor Brad “Do” Little has put the State of Idaho into collective quarantine. We are to stay in our homes, for the most part, for the next 21 days. For those of WC’s friends who are similarly locked down, WC will be offering tips for coping. Here’s the first: If you enjoy reading books,…\n\nWC’s Writing Had Had the That That Problem\n\nIt’s been aeons since WC did a genuine book review. After all, it says “Reviews” on the masthead. So WC will review four books here. WC’s writing teachers – you may be surprised that WC had had writing teachers – taught him not to use “that that” and “had had.” Even if Abraham Lincoln, in…\n\nNotes on John McPhee\n\nJohn McPhee is, by a wide margin, WC’s favorite non-fiction writer. McPhee’s last book, The Patch, and his recent essay in the New Yorker are both collections of fragments, work he started and never finished, ideas he played with and could never turn into a compete work, ideas that he never got around to. The fragments are fascinating…\n\nKafka, the Lost Doll and the Little Girl\n\nIn undergraduate school, WC was for a time fascinated – infatuated, really – with the works of Franz Kafka. It doesn’t take long to read all of Kafka’s works – five fairly short novels and a couple of short story collections – but they leave an impression, and appealed to WC’s sensibilities at the time.…\n\nBook Review: The Patch, John McPhee\n\nJohn MacPhee is WC’s favorite non-fiction writer, as WC has likely said too often in this blog. He’s 88 years old now, with some 36 books published (all of them still in print). WC owns all of them. They overfill a shelf. The Patch, his latest, is something of an experiment. The first third, titled…\n\nExtraordinary Proof for an Extraordinary Claim\n\nIf there is one single book you should read in the run-up to the 2020 elections, it’s probably Nancy MacLean’s Democracy in Chains. Be prepared to be very, very angry, because MacLean, an historian and the William H. Chafe Professor of History and Public Policy at Duke University, documents the history, philosophy and details of the…\n\nBook Review: The Ugly American, Eugene Burdick and William Lederer (1958)\n\nThere’s a reason for two book reviews in one week. We’ll get to that later. But The Ugly American is a seminal and hugely influential work of fictionalized reporting that still deserves your attention fifty-one years after its publication. Co-written by by Eugene Burdick and William Lederer it tells the story, in a series of linked vignettes,…\n\nBook Review: The Face in the Frost (Updated)\n\nThe Face in the Frost, John Bellairs ISBN 158754105X (2000) Magic Mirrors, John Bellairs (Edited by Ann Broomhead and Timothy Szczesuil) NESFA Press, iSBN 978-1-886778-67-2 (12009) This is fantasy reduced to its purest form. From a laugh out loud first few pages you are plunged into nightmare and horror through to a purely satisfying ending. In…"
