        "text": "Billionaire Google co-founder Sergey Brin and a host of bros celebrated illusionist David Blaine’s 50 birthday in Las Vegas.\n\nA source tells us Brin, Woody Harrelson, music manager Guy Oseary, Edward Norton, “Borat” star Sacha Baron Cohen and “Free Solo” rock climber Alex Honnold surprised the magician at his “In Spades” show at Resorts World Theater, where he closed the night by holding his breath for 14 minutes.\n\nAfterwards, a re-oxygenated Blaine and his posse headed over to hotspot Catch at the Aria Resort & Casino, where he was surprised by 50 more friends.\n\n“They were in a private dining room,” says a spy, who tells us a “loud version of ‘Happy Birthday’ could be heard through the restaurant.”\n\nBlaine and Brin are longtime pals: Back in 2016, Blaine performed at Google’s elite tech “Camp.” Page Six reported on the session, which had the audience grossed out when he swallowed a live frog, spit it up, then re-swallowed the creature.\n\nThe illusionist is known for his death-defying tricks.\n\nIn March, Blaine was injured during a stunt in his show that features an 80-foot drop into a a bunch of cardboard boxes. He dislocated his arm.\n\n“Mr. Blaine was treated by doctors from the audience on stage in front of the assembled crowd, where they successfully relocated his right arm, as he experienced extreme pain and discomfort,” World Resorts said in a statement.\n\n“After a short delay, Blaine was able to continue with the show, in pain, but in good humor,” the statement said."
