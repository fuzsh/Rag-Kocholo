        "text": "Now available in two versions —\n\na special limited collectable hardcover and an e-book!\n\nSubterranean Press, 2021\n\nscroll down to preview the Table of Contents, read sample stories, and order The Best of David Brin\n\nfilm & media queries\n\nVince Gerardis\n\nCreated-By Agency\n\nemail: rightsqueries@gmail.com (with cc: to DAVID BRIN at books@davidbrin.com)\n\nthe best of Brin's worlds\n\nDavid Brin has thrilled readers in almost thirty languages by presenting vastly imaginative — and well-grounded — challenges set in times that might yet come... along with a sometimes razor-thin hope weâll persevere. In this major retrospective collection of shorter work, gathered from across an extraordinary career spanning decades, youâll find wonder via David Brinâs unparalleled talent at imagination, extrapolation, hard headed optimism, and plain old fun.\n\nHere, you will find âThe Crystal Spheres,â the Hugo Award winning short story that first brought Brin wide acclaim, posing one more — colorfully strange — answer to: âAre we alone in the universe?â Other tales explore a universe of possibilities ... such as when a hero climbs an impossible mountain to confront Fate itself, in âThe Loom of Thessaly,â or when world powers battle over a Vegas magicianâs knack for prediction, in âThe Tell.â Or uncovering ancient terrors long-buried under an urban landfill (âDetritus Affectedâ), or when a mother in labor fights to save her child from an invention gone-wrong (âDr. Pakâs Preschoolâ).\n\nBefore The Postman won awards as a novel and became a major motion picture, that tale of a storyteller reviving dreams of a better world originated in the Hugo-nominated novella thatâs included here. Confronting one of the oldest challenges in modern SF — âWhat if the Nazis won?â — Brin presents an unexpected answer in âThor Meets Captain America.â And his penchant for offering I-hadnât-thought-of-that! answers, as well as questions, erupts in âStones of Significance,â a post-Singularity world where human identity can and will survive technological evolution.\n\ntable of contents\n\nHere, in more than twenty stories representing the best work of a masterful writer, readers will find an entire orchard of ideas, rooted in guarded optimism and stretching skyward towards a multitude of possible worlds.\n\nIntroduction by Catherine Asaro\n\nLift your gaze!\n\nInsistence of Vision\n\nThe Crystal Spheres\n\nThe Loom of Thessaly\n\nTransition Generation\n\nItâs alive! So be wary.\n\nThe Giving Plague\n\nChrysalis\n\nDr. Pakâs Preschool\n\nPiecework\n\nPersevere! (Tales of the Coss)\n\nThe Logs\n\nTumbledowns of Cleopatra Abyss\n\nThings may just get weird.\n\nDetritus Affected\n\nMars Opposition\n\nToujours Voir\n\nThe River of Time\n\nLight. Let it shine!\n\nThe Tell\n\nThe Avalon Probes\n\nThe Escape\n\nPrevailing... despite everything...\n\nThe Postman\n\nA Need for Heroes\n\nThor Meets Captain America\n\nAnd good news may get... complicated...\n\nStones of Significance\n\nReality Check\n\nnovels\n\nDavid Brin's science fiction novels have been New York Times Bestsellers, winning multiple Hugo, Nebula and other awards. At least a dozen have been translated into more than twenty languages. They range from bold and prophetic explorations of our near-future to Brin's Uplift series, envisioning galactic issues of sapience and destiny (and star-faring dolphins!). Learn More\n\nshorter fiction\n\nShort stories and novellas have different rhythms and artistic flavor, and Brin's short stories and novellas, several of which earned Hugo and other awards, exploit that difference to explore a wider range of real and vividly speculative ideas. Many have been selected for anthologies and reprints, and most have been published in anthology form. Learn More\n\nContrary Brin blog\n\nSince 2004, David Brin has maintained a blog about science, technology, science fiction, books, and the future — themes his science fiction and nonfiction writings continue to explore. Learn More\n\nsocial media influencer\n\nWho could've predicted that social media — indeed, all of our online society — would play such an important role in the 21st Century — restoring the voices of advisors and influencers! Lively and intelligent comments spill over onto Brin's social media pages. Learn More\n\nscientist\n\nDavid Brin's Ph.D in Physics from the University of California at San Diego (the lab of nobelist Hannes Alfven) followed a masters in optics and an undergraduate degree in astrophysics from Caltech. Every science show that depicts a comet now portrays the model developed in Brin's PhD research. Learn More\n\ntransparency expert\n\nBrin's non-fiction book, The Transparent Society: Will Technology Force Us to Choose Between Freedom and Privacy?, continues to receive acclaim for its accuracy in predicting 21st Century concerns about online security, secrecy, accountability and privacy. Learn More\n\nspeaker & consultant\n\nBrin speaks plausibly and entertainingly about trends in technology and society to audiences willing to confront the challenges that our rambunctious civilization will face in the decades ahead. He also talks about the field of science fiction, especially in relation to his own novels and stories. To date he has presented at more than 200 meetings, conferences, corporate retreats and other gatherings.Learn More\n\nfuture/tech advisor\n\nBrin advises corporations and governmental and private defense- and security-related agencies about information-age issues, scientific trends, future social and political trends, and education. Urban Developer Magazine named him one of four World's Best Futurists, and he was cited as one of the top 10 writers the AI elite follow. Past consultations include Google, Microsoft, Procter & Gamble, and many others. Learn More"
