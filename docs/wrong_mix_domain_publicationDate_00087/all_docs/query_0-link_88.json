        "text": "by Jon Gordon ISBN: 0470888547, Hardcover- $12.07 BUY\n\nBestselling author Jon Gordon returns with his most inspiring book yet-filled with powerful lessons and the greatest success strategies of all.\n\nMichael wakes up in the hospital with a bandage on his head and fear in his heart. The stress of building a growing business, with his wife Sarah, caused him to collapse while on a morning jog. When Michael finds out the man who saved his life is a Carpenter he visits him and quickly learns that he is more than just a Carpenter; he is also a builder of lives, careers, people, and teams.\n\nAs the Carpenter shares his wisdom, Michael attempts to save his business in the face of adversity, rejection, fear, and failure. Along the way he learns that there's no such thing as an overnight success but there are timeless principles to help you stand out, excel, and make an impact on people and the world.\n\nby Bruce Schneier ISBN: 0393244814, Hardcover- $15.37 BUY\n\nYour cell phone provider tracks your location and knows who's with you. Your online and in-store purchasing patterns are recorded, and reveal if you're unemployed, sick, or pregnant. Your e-mails and texts expose your intimate and casual friends. Google knows what you're thinking because it saves your private searches. Facebook can determine your sexual orientation without you ever mentioning it.\n\nThe powers that surveil us do more than simply store this information. Corporations use surveillance to manipulate not only the news articles and advertisements we each see, but also the prices we're offered. Governments use surveillance to discriminate, censor, chill free speech, and put people in danger worldwide. And both sides share this information with each other or, even worse, lose it to cybercriminals in huge data breaches.\n\n...In Data and Goliath, security expert Bruce Schneier offers another path, one that values both security and privacy. He shows us exactly what we can do to reform our government surveillance programs and shake up surveillance-based business models, while also providing tips for you to protect your privacy every day. You'll never look at your phone, your computer, your credit cards, or even your car in the same way again.\n\nby Greg O'Brien ISBN: 0991340108, Paperback- $13.65 BUY\n\nThis is a book about living with Alzheimer's, not dying with it. It is a book about hope, faith, and humor - a prescription far more powerful than the conventional medication available today to fight this disease.\n\nAlzheimer's is the sixth leading cause of death in the U.S. and the only one of these diseases on the rise. More than 5 million Americans have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's or a related dementia; about 35 million people worldwide.\n\nGreg O'Brien, an award-winning investigative reporter, has been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's and is one of those faceless numbers. Acting on long-term memory and skill coupled with well-developed journalistic grit, O'Brien decided to tackle the disease and his imminent decline by writing frankly about the journey. O'Brien is a master storyteller. His story is naked, wrenching, and soul searching for a generation and their loved ones about to cross the threshold of this death in slow motion. On Pluto: Inside the Mind of Alzheimer's is a trail-blazing roadmap for a generation - both a \"how to\" for fighting a disease, and a \"how not\" to give up!\n\nby Tim Higgins (Author) ISBN: 0972002189, Paperback- $16.42 BUY\n\nEvery year the cost of college goes up, and every year families struggle harder to meet these rising costs. Pay for College without Sacrificing Your Retirement offers help for taking on the double challenge of paying for your children's college education and saving for your retirement. It shows how to maximize your resources, evaluate colleges and financial aid opportunities, avoid crushing student debt, make the tax system work for you, and save for retirement.\n\nOffers essential information for families at all income levels: * financial aid and figuring your \"expected family contribution\" * academic, athletic, and need-based scholarships * tax-sheltered savings plans such as 529s * business assets, loans, home equity, and retirement savings * potential help from grandparents * how to choose the best college for the money.\n\nby Peter Thiel, Blake Masters ISBN: 0804139296, Hardcover- $15.52 BUY\n\nThiel begins with the contrarian premise that we live in an age of technological stagnation, even if we're too distracted by shiny mobile devices to notice. Information technology has improved rapidly, but there is no reason why progress should be limited to computers or Silicon Valley. Progress can be achieved in any industry or area of business. It comes from the most important skill that every leader must master: learning to think for yourself.\n\nDoing what someone else already knows how to do takes the world from 1 to n, adding more of something familiar. But when you do something new, you go from 0 to 1. The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Larry Page or Sergey Brin won't make a search engine. Tomorrow's champions will not win by competing ruthlessly in today's marketplace. They will escape competition altogether, because their businesses will be unique.\n\nZero to One presents at once an optimistic view of the future of progress in America and a new way of thinking about innovation: it starts by learning to ask the questions that lead you to find value in unexpected places.\n\nby Michael E. Gerber ISBN: 0887307280, Paperback- $11.86 BUY\n\nMichael Gerber dispels the myths surrounding starting your own business and shows how commonplace assumptions can get in the way of running a business. He walks you through the steps in the life of a business from entrepreneurial infancy, through adolescent growing pains, to the mature entrepreneurial perspective, the guiding light of all businesses that succeed. He then shows how to apply the lessons of franchising to any business whether or not it is a franchise. Finally, Gerber draws the vital, often overlooked distinction between working on your business and working in your business. After you have read The E-Myth Revisited, you will truly be able to grow your business in a predictable and productive way.\n\nby Judy Robinett ISBN: 0071830731, Hardcover- $19.08 BUY\n\nAs anyone in business knows, strategic planning is critical to achieving long-term success. In How to Be a Power Connector, super-networker Judy Robinett argues that strategic relationship planning should be your top priority.\n\nWhen you combine your specific skills and talents with a clear, workable path for creating and managing your relationships, nothing will stop you from meeting your goals. With high-value connections, you'll tap into a dynamic \"power grid\" of influence guaranteed to accelerate your personal and professional success.\n\nRobinett uses her decades of experience connecting the world's highest achievers with one another to help you build high-value relationships. She reveals all the secrets of her trade, including proven ways to:\n\n-Find and enter the best network \"ecosystem\" to meet your goals\n\n-Reach even the most unreachable people quickly and effectively\n\n-Get anyone's contact information within 30 seconds\n\n-Create a \"3-D connection\" that adds value to multiple people at the same time\n\n-Access key influencers through industry and community events\n\n-Subtly seed conversation with information about interests and needs\n\n-Use social media to your best advantage\n\nby Keith Ferrazzi, Tahl Raz ISBN: 0385346654, Hardcover- $20.53 BUY\n\nThe bestselling business classic on the power of relationships, updated with in-depth advice for making connections in the digital world.\n\nDo you want to get ahead in life? Climb the ladder to personal success?\n\nThe secret, master networker Keith Ferrazzi claims, is in reaching out to other people. As Ferrazzi discovered in early life, what distinguishes highly successful people from everyone else is the way they use the power of relationships-so that everyone wins.\n\nIn Never Eat Alone, Ferrazzi lays out the specific steps-and inner mindset-he uses to reach out to connect with the thousands of colleagues, friends, and associates on his contacts list, people he has helped and who have helped him. And in the time since Never Eat Alone was published in 2005, the rise of social media and new, collaborative management styles have only made Ferrazzi's advice more essential for anyone hoping to get ahead in business.\n\nby John C. Bogle ISBN: 0470102101, Hardcover- $16.07 BUY\n\nTo learn how to make index investing work for you, there's no better mentor than legendary mutual fund industry veteran John C. Bogle. Over the course of his long career, Bogle-founder of the Vanguard Group and creator of the world's first index mutual fund-has relied primarily on index investing to help Vanguard's clients build substantial wealth. Now, with The Little Book of Common Sense Investing, he wants to help you do the same.\n\nFilled with in-depth insights and practical advice, The Little Book of Common Sense Investing will show you how to incorporate this proven investment strategy into your portfolio. It will also change the very way you think about investing. Successful investing is not easy. (It requires discipline and patience.) But it is simple. For it's all about common sense.\n\nby Charles D. Ellis, Alicia H. Munnell, Andrew D. Eschtruth ISBN: 0190218894, Hardcover- $22.31 BUY\n\nFalling Short is grounded in sound research yet written in a highly accessible style. The authors provide a vivid picture of the retirement crisis in America. They offer the necessary context for understanding the nature and size of the retirement income shortfall, which is caused by both increasing income needs-due to longer lifespans and rising health costs-and decreasing support from Social Security and employer-sponsored pension plans.\n\nThe solutions are to work longer and save more by building on the existing retirement system. To work longer, individuals should plan to stay in the labor force until age 70 if possible. To save more, policymakers should shore up Social Security's long-term finances; make all 401(k) plans fully automatic, with workers allowed to opt out; and ensure that everyone has access to a retirement savings plan. Individuals should also recognize that their house is a source of saving, which they can tap in retirement through downsizing or a reverse mortgage.\n\nby Carol Pepper, Carol Pepper ISBN: 1250035481, Paperback- $22.99 BUY\n\nBy two leading financial experts: an essential guide for every woman who wants to build, preserve, and enjoy her wealth.\n\nWomen control more than half of all wealth in the U .S., and in 2011 held the majority of jobs in the workforce. As women's earnings, freedom and influence increase, the old sequential patterns of education, marriage, motherhood, and retirement no longer apply. A woman may set up a foundation in her twenties when she sells her first company, support her family as the primary breadwinner in her thirties, start a new career in her sixties and remarry in her seventies. Today women cycle repeatedly but not in any traditional order through these stages: wealth building, romance and marriage, motherhood, power, crisis and loss, retirement, legacy building. In The Seven Pearls of Financial Wisdom, experts Carol Pepper and Camilla Webster offer women one invaluable pearl of wisdom for each of these key areas, helping them move beyond outdated financial-planning ideas to enjoy their power, transforming both their money and their lives.\n\nby Lynnette Khalfani-Cox ISBN: 1932450122, Paperback- $15.95 BUY\n\nWe all know that college is expensive. But what about the years before you-or your children-arrive at the college of your dreams?

College Secrets for Teens also reveals: 40 free pre-college programs at top U.S. schools, 30+ elite schools that pay for you to visit them, 8 methods to pay nothing for college applications, 10 foolish ways students pick the wrong colleges, 5 critical rules to choose the best college for you, Insider advice on getting in to your first-choice college or university - and much, much more!\n\nCollege Secrets for Teens is the book every 7th through 12th grader needs to have!\n\nby William B. Moran ISBN: 145750992X, Paperback- $14.99 BUY\n\nOnly in the world of major league baseball could an ordinary man like John Meek find himself with the extraordinary opportunity to fulfill his childhood dreams. At 45 years old, a serious car accident left him with a freakishly deformed right arm . . . and an unexpected ability to throw pitches that no one had ever seen before. Unable to resist a spring amateur-day tryout for the Baltimore Orioles, Meek appears on the mound in Florida and puts away seasoned pros, one after the other. From that point on, Meek's middle-class existence evaporates into the rarified atmosphere of major league baseball. What follows is a season worthy of baseball's legend-rich history . . . a season of tension, challenges and changes for Meek, his family, teammates, and fans. It's a season that climaxes just the way you hope it will . . . or does it? No true baseball fan will want to miss this One Season.\n\nby Willliam B. Moran ISBN: 1457540126, Hardcover- $24.95 BUY\n\nDr. Robert Zemanovic, a geneticist at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, has a secret. After years of private research, conducted out of his home laboratory, the doctor has discovered the mutation that causes homosexuality, the gay gene. Aware of the cultural shock and controversy attendant to his research, he keeps his efforts a complete secret from everyone, including his own family. But all that secrecy can no longer be contained when he begins the next phase of his research - gene therapy on volunteers to correct their sexual orientation. With the initial group of 12 volunteers showing up at his home for treatment of the condition, his spouse demands an accounting of his activity. Cornered, the doctor reluctantly reveals the nature of his work, a disclosure which starts unintended consequences in motion, creating major problems at home, his place of employment, and for his volunteers, all leading to an unexpected, dramatic ending.\n\nWilliam B. Moran, author of The End of Gay, is a federal administrative law judge. Over the past 21 years, he has presided in cases involving many government agencies. These have included cases brought by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Internal Revenue Service, the Patent and Trademark Office, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms, the Department of Agriculture, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, among other agencies. Some of Judge Moran's cases have been noted in the New York Times, USA Today and the Washington Post. Raised in Arlington, Massachusetts, he has a Juris Doctor degree from Suffolk University Law School and a Master of Laws degree from Georgetown Law. Among his nonacademic achievements, he has qualified for, and competed in, ten Boston Marathons. This is his third novel, following the publication of ALJ, involving corruption with Social Security Disability claims, and One Season, A Baseball Tale, a whimsical story about a middle aged lawyer who discovers he can pitch in the big leagues.\n\nby Joshua Adam Eldredge ISBN: 1517130840, Paperback- $14.99 BUY\n\nApocalyptical horror fiction\n\n\"This book is the first in a series intended to reveal the truth about humanity, from our creation to our present state of corruption and dissonance. One of the goals is to present the terrifying weaponry developed by the shadow government of the United States, and the horrible people that hold total control over it without having to answer to anyone.\"\n\nJoshua Adam Eldredge is a native of Barnstable, Massachusetts. With a vested interest in many alternative avenues of life, he explores all matters of the occult. He holds a B.F.A which he received at Framingham State University in 2004. He currently owns and operates a construction company, JAE Building Inc., servicing all of Cape Cod.\n\nby Cheryl Kain ISBN: B00BOGRHFU, Paperback- $9.99 BUY\n\nKINDLE Version\n\nFollowing her mother's death, the author composes a series of letters to her. The letters reveal her struggle with the different facets of grief, and her belief that her mother's love continues on after death.\n\nAn accomplished singer who performed the national anthem at Fenway Park and Dodger Stadium, Cheryl was adopted at four months old. Wanting to spend time with her mother while mom was still healthy, Cheryl made the difficult decision to uproot herself by moving to small-town life on Cape Cod, leaving behind her friends and work in Los Angeles.\n\nby John F. Love ISBN: 0553347594, Paperback- $14.19 BUY\n\nMcDonald's: it is the world's premier entrepreneurial success story, a company whose growth worldwide continues to be astonishing. In tough financial times, McDonald's proved that ingenuity, trial and error, and gut instinct were the keys to building a service business the entire world has come to admire. In the years since McDonald's: Behind The Arches was first published, McDonald's has been a trendsetter in advertising, focusing on different ethnic groups as well as the physically disabled.\n\nMcDonald's created McJobs, a program that employs both mentally challenged adults and senior citizens. And because its franchisees have their fingers on the pulse of the marketplace, McDonald's has evolved successfully with the health food revolution, launching dozens of new products and moving toward environmentally-safe packaging and recyclable goods. Inspiring, informative, and filled with behind the scenes stories, this remarkable saga offers an irresistible look inside a great American business success.\n\nby Fred Crawford ISBN: 0609810014, Paperback- $14.81 BUY\n\nEx*cel*lence (n.) 1. The clearly false and destructive theory that a company ought to be great at everything it does. 2. A mistaken goal in which the predictable outcome is that the company ends up world-class at nothing-not well-differentiated and therefore not thought of by consumers at the moment of need.\n\nBased on exhaustive research, The Myth of Excellence provides conclusive evidence of the futility of trying to be excellent in all aspects of a commercial transaction-price, product, access, experience, and service. Instead, the strategy for your products and services should be to dominate on one element, differentiate on a second, and be at industry par (i.e., average) on the rest. Yes, it is okay to be average as long as your customers know specifically where and how you are superior and world-class.\n\nby Paco Underhill ISBN: 1416595244, Paperback- $9.55 BUY\n\nRevolutionary retail guru Paco Underhill is back with a completely revised edition of his classic, witty bestselling book on our ever-evolving consumer culture-full of fresh observations and important lessons from the cutting edge of retail such as Internet behemoths Amazon and iTunes as well as the globalization of retail in the world's emerging markets.\n\nNew material includes:\n\n* The latest trends in online retail - what retailers are doing right and what they're doing wrong - and how nearly every Internet retailer from iTunes to Amazon can drastically improve how it serves its customers.\n\n* A guided tour of the most innovative stores, malls and retail environments around the world - almost all of which are springing up in countries where prosperity is new. An enormous indoor ski slope attracts shoppers to a mall in Dubai; an uber luxurious Sao Paolo department store provides its customers with personal shoppers; a mall in South Africa has a wave pool for surfing.\n\nThe new Why We Buy is an essential guide - it offers advice on how to keep your changing customers and entice new and eager ones."
