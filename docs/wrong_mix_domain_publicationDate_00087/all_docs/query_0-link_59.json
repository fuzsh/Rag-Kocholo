        "text": "📆 Just over a year ago 💔 Cancer claimed another one of life’s good’ens, and we lost a special man 🥹 A father, a father in law and a gramps 💙 He was full of life, kind, happy go lucky and had a bucket list of things that he never got to experience 🎪 One of them was to climb the o2 🎉 Today is his birthday, he loved get togethers, especially with family ✔️ So today in his memory, we came together and ticked this one off the list for him 🙏🏼 The world changes from year to year, our lives change day to day, but the memories we carry, stay with us forever\n\n🎉 Yesterday marked my 7th anniversary at Positive Lending 🚘 Just over 7 years ago I was sat in Fleet services with my then manager and still good friend Jaxon Stevens CeMAP about to meet Positive’s owner Paul McGonigle 🫱🏼🫲🏽 To cut a long story short, 45 minutes later I was sold, we were shaking hands and I accepted the job 🤩 And I haven’t looked back since 🌍 A lot has changed since I joined, major world, industry and personal events 👨🏼🦳 And I’m definitely a lot greyer 👊🏼 But the consistent is I have a job I enjoy, I work with some fantastic people in an amazing industry and most importantly the company ethos and culture I signed up to 7 years ago has remained consistent and committed to being the very best 💙 Thank you to everyone for their congratulatory comments and the overwhelming amount of kind messages sliding into my DMs 🥰 And a big thank you to everyone past and present who have made the past 7 years at Positive Lending so enjoyable\n\n🤩 When you get to work with inspirational and genuinely good people 😍 Work doesn’t feel like work ⛳️ Yesterday’s ‘work’ included spending the afternoon rallying around Rockliffe Hall Hotel, Golf & Spa Resort with my sidekicks Julia Smith DipFA, Carron Wilson, Catherine Gamble and Craig Chandler 👀 Dodging bunkers, avoiding flying golf balls, losing some cargo overboard and very nearly losing Catherine Gamble (but did you die) 😂 🍺 We hand delivered snacks and refreshments to the competing golfers courtesy of Positive Lending 🍫 💰 All in aid of supporting Julia’s event and raising just shy of £5,000 for the The Openwork Partnership Foundation, taking the total to £21,000 over the last 4 years ⭐️ 🙌🏼 Not bad for a days ‘work’\n\n🤥 The stages of crocs denial 🚫 Me. Crocs. NOT.A.CHANCE! 🪴 Ok. Maybe for the garden only 🛒 Easy to slip on, might just pop to the shops in them 👖 I know what will go well with this outfit, my crocs 👀 🎨 Might need to get some more colours 🐊 Becomes an ambassador for crocs 😂 💚 I’m converted, they’re just so comfortable ❓ Over to you…to croc or not to croc\n\n🤷🏻♂️ I’m always baffled 🥱 That even after a broken nights sleep 🤩 How excited this little guy is to get out of bed so (very) early each morning 🫢 And then I remember… 💙 He’s going to spend his day playing 🧸, napping 💤, eating 🥞, drinking 🍼 and being waited on hand and foot 😂 I’d be pretty excited too ☕️ I on the other hand am excited for coffee\n\n🔟 Meanwhile at number 10 Downing Street 🤫 Don’t really get involved with sharing politics 🤓 I’m not well enough informed 🤡 And arguing with the local political expert clown from Facebook isn’t the best use of my time 🤩 But sometimes the internet just comes up gold 😂 And this is too good not to share\n\n🌦️ The imperfectly perfect British summertime ☔️ April showers in July 🍗 BBQ’ing in heavy downpours 💨 Gazebo flying across the garden 🎈 Balloon arch fighting the elements 💥 Balloons popping at random 😂 Impossible to get the perfect photo with everyone smiling and looking in the right direction 🎂 In between all the imperfections, we had the perfect day celebrating Tommy’s birthday 💙 And are now proud owners of a beautiful 1 year old 🎉 Happy birthday Tommy"
