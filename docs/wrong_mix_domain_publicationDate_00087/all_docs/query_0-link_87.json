Annie Proulx\n\nInvisible Cities, Italo Calvino\n\nGilead, Marilynne Robinson\n\nSundiver, David Brin\n\nIt started out with me raiding my dad’s sci-fi book collection, and deciding to read every Heinlein book I hadn’t read. Of course, I had to re-read The Moon is a Harsh Mistress while I was at it, one of my absolute favorites. Of those new to me, Double Star was the best. The tale of a down on his luck actor who takes a gig impersonating the kidnapped President of Mars, and gets involved in all sorts of political intrigue. Hilarious at times, a really fun book. Didn’t hurt that I was listening to a great audiobook performance by Tom Weiner.\n\nReading Heinlein got me back into sci-fi but also just reading in general and I decided to start using my longer drive to work to listen to audiobooks and put a dent in my reading list backlog. While searching for new books to read I saw the Ursula LeGuin books on a couple lists. They were very good intelligently written sci-fi that I really enjoyed.\n\nI picked up a copy of As I Lay Dying at a used bookstore, that got me reading more Faulkner and before I knew it, I was crossing a host of southern gothic novels off my list.\n\nFinally I decided to focus on two lists. The Hugo Award winning novels (sci-fi) and the Pulitzer Prize winning novels, adding in pre-requisites as needed, follow-ups where wanted.\n\nNotable mentions: The Flannery O’Connor short stories are biting and brutal and great. The Sheltering Sky had an incredible sense of place in the Sahara and a tragic story arc. Redshirts was a lot of fun. The Rabbit novels just plain sad.\n\nAncillary Justice, another sci-fi was set in an alien culture with no gender pronouns in their language, so the author used ‘she/her’ for every single character, even after describing a character as male (for the few characters who even had their gender mentioned at all). A very interesting read, to almost completely drop gender as a character attribute.\n\nThe Three Body Problem, first Chinese novel to win the Hugo Award was thought provoking and unique, read it on my trip to Hong Kong.\n\nA Confederacy of Dunces, which won the Pulitzer posthumously in 1981 is an incredible work. Strange, satirical, hilarious throughout. Ignatius J. Riley is quite a character.\n\nFinally, I borrowed my friend’s copy of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. Incredibly sad, very funny, I enjoyed all the comic and sci-fi references throughout.\n\nThis year I’m going to keep working on the Hugos and Pulitzers. Looking forward to reading A Visit from the Goon Squad by Jenifer Egan, that I got for Christmas."
