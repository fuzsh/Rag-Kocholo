        "text": "What is Harley Reading?\n\nJump to the reviews\n\nIn order to read well, it is important to read widely. This is easy for me to say, but how do you know which books to choose for yourself? In the earlier parts of this guide, I made two suggestions.\n\nFirst, if you do not already have a library card, please get one. Then spend some time browsing the shelves. Be curious. Pick up books that are strange to you and read a bit to see what you think. Looking for ideas that pique your interest is a wonderful way to find new and exciting books to read.\n\nThe second suggestion is to identify authors and books that have proven to be of enduring value, and sample what they have to offer. There are, of course, many such authors and many such books, and no one is smart enough to make a definitive list. Still, it's nice to have some suggestions, and if you look in the resource section I mentioned above, you will find two short lists that can get you started.\n\nA third idea, which I want to talk about now, is to get ideas by looking at what other people are reading.\n\nOne of the most interesting things about reading is that it is an intensely personal experience. In fact, it may be the most personal human experience there is. Certainly, there are no two people who have the exact same taste in books. Even between longtime spouses, it is common to find that the husband and wife have vastly different reading preferences. For this reason, it is particularly unsatisfying to have someone else choose books for you to read. (Think back to your high school English classes.)\n\nHowever, this does not mean that you should never ask other people to recommend books. I remember one day in the ninth grade, being in the library talking to a friend of mine named Joe Halpern. Joe was widely considered to be The Smartest Guy in the School. (I'm sure you know the type.)\n\n\"Joe,\" I said, \"can you recommend anything good to read?\"\n\nJoe looked at the bookshelf in front of us, reached up, and pulled down a book by P.G. Wodehouse. To this day, I consider Joe's suggestion to be one of the most important favors anyone has ever done for me.\n\nSo in the same spirit, I offer you my personal reading list: the books I am reading now or have read in the recent past. My hope is that this list will give you ideas for your own reading. Perhaps, if you are lucky, one of these books will open a new and satisfying world for you, just as Joe's suggestion did for me so many years ago.\n\nI have arranged the list below so that the books I have read most recently are at the top. I did this so that when you visit again, you can see what's new by looking at the top of the list.\n\nAs you look at the list, you will see my opinion of the writing (excellent, good, fair, or poor), and whether or not the book is worth reading. I will also tell you where I got the book: from my personal collection, from a friend, or from the library. (You will notice that the library is an important place for me.)\n\nBy the way, would you like to find out what happened to Joe?\n\n— the reviews —\n\nAuthor: Robert Heinlein\n\nWriting: Excellent\n\nWorth reading?
