David Brin's OUT OF TIME series

Would you want to be Yanked out of time... if it meant you could help save the future?

All our best efforts in the difficult 21st century bore fruit, and in the 24th century, people live in the very opposite of a dystopia. Only now their near-utopia is in desperate peril. Suddenly, they need heroes with grit and determination, who can teach them how to face trouble and prevail. So they reach back through time to fetch such heroes...

... but only teenagers can survive the journey from our present to the future! So the heroes they bring forward must be youths from eras teeming with troubled hope — teens from today and from deeper in the past — who are "yanked" to an uncertain tomorrow, where only their courage and savvy innovation can save the day.

Vivid Tomorrows

Can science fiction — especially sci-fi cinema — save the world? It already has, many times. And itâs not been all dire warnings. While optimism is much harder to dramatize than apocalypse, both large and small screens have also encouraged millions to lift their gaze, contemplating how we might get better, incrementally, or else raise grandchildren worthy of the stars. Come along with legendary science fiction author and astrophysicist David Brin on a quirky quest for unusual insights into the power of forward-looking media.
