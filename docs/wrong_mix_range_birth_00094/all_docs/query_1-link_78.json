        "text": "English (Yorkshire and Lancashire): from Middle English s(c)hawe, s(c)haghe âsmall wood, grove, thicketâ (Old English sceaga). The surname may be topographic, for someone who lived in or by a small wood, or habitational, for someone from any of the many places so named. Shaw and Shawe are most frequent in Lancashire and Yorkshire, where Shaw in Oldham (Lancashire) may be a principal source of the surname. The English and Lowland Scottish surname was also established in Ireland in the 17th century."
