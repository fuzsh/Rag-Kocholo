        "text": "1. He hated the name George and always preferred to be called simply Bernard Shaw.\n\n2. He is the only person to have won both a Nobel Prize (for Literature in 1925) and an Oscar (for the screenplay of his play Pygmalion in 1938).\n\n3. Born in Dublin he began work aged 15 as a junior clerk in a Dublin estate agency at a salary of £18 a year.\n\n4. He later described the work as a “damnable waste of human life”.\n\n5. Throughout his life he campaigned strongly for both socialism and alphabet reform...\n\n6. ...his new alphabet was designed to eliminate inconsistencies in English spelling. He left a large amount of money to promote his new alphabet but it never became popular.\n\n7. He was a lifelong vegetarian and opposed British involvement in the First World War.\n\n8. Because of his anti-war pamphlets and speeches he was expelled from the Dramatists’ Club."
