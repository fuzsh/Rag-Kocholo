        "text": "George Bernard Shaw was born in Dublin of Protestant stock in 1856. During Shaw’s fifty-eight year career he wrote novels, short stories and several reviews, essays and prefaces. Shaw’s early writings were based on the unrealistic Victorian ideas and written as a comedy that made fun of romance during that time period. Like many other Irish writers, Bernard Shaw contributed highly to English literature and drama with writings such as Pygmalion, a play that was based on a part of his life and written as a comedy but received as a love story.\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw was born on the twenty-six day of July in 1856. “Bernard Shaw was the third child and only son of George Carr Shaw and Lucinda Elizabeth (Gurly) Shaw” (Carr 7). “Bernard Shaw had …show more content…\n\nShaw would live with his Mother and Lee for the ten years.\n\nBernard Shaw romance many women with romantic letters. “Shaw was introduced to Charlotte Payne-Townsend, a green-eyed Irish millionaire, through friends” (Carr 9). On June 1, 1898 Charlotte bought a marriage license and they were married on the West Strand Registry Office. Shaw and Charlotte where married for many years. Charlotte died as age eighty-six. After her death, when Shaw found her diaries and letters to T.E. Lawrence, he said, “Of all the women I have known (and I have known many) I knew Charlotte least of all” (Carr 9).\n\n“Bernard Shaw had no systematic education, but he worked at self-improvement, learned shorthand, drawing lesions, studied languages and took boxing lessons at London Athletic Club as a feature to his public image” (Morgan 103). “Shaw became a vegetarian in 1881 in the hope of curing his chronic migraine headaches” (Morgan 102). In meeting William Archer, a man of deep social and ethical convictions, well established as a critic and becoming known translator and champion of Ibsen, enable him to win fame and earn a regular living as a journalist, and then led him on into his career as a playwright.\n\nBernard Shaw wrote Pygmalion in 1913 and it tells a story about how a professor in phonetics makes a bet with his close friend Colonel Pickering that he can teach a low class"
