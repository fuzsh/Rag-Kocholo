His engaging style fuses tradition and innovation to create moments of beauty that “effectively carry out a dialogue between the [music] and the modern listener.” (Choral Journal)\n\nPrior to his work as a full-time composer, his experience as an educator at the elementary, middle school, high school, and university levels – as well as a church music director – infuses his works with “an intimate knowledge of the human voice” and a “rare sensitivity to the capabilities of a choral ensemble.” This, combined with his degrees in music education and a doctorate in choral conducting, have grounded his style in tradition, which blend with his modern sensibilities to “inform the thoughts and aspirations of the people and the time” (Choral Scholar) and to create “tender harmonies and a palette of glowing vocal and instrumental colors.” (Gramophone)\n\nDriven by a desire to support hardworking directors who work to bring out the best in their ensembles, Trotta has developed keynotes that connect conductors to the educational and artistic goals that drew them to the profession in the first place. “Your Perfect Choir,” “Developing Artistry,” and “Empowering Ensembles” create experiences that connect people to the power of music and its ability transcend barriers and teach us more about each other and ourselves.\n\nAn ardent advocate for under-resourced and overworked arts organizations, Trotta has pioneered the development of the consortium model of commissioning. As a result, the opportunity to premiere a major work for choir and orchestra is now within reach for more choirs than ever before. The Carnegie Hall premiere of the inaugural work, Seven Last Words, was heralded as a “modern classic.” Passionate about removing barriers to new music and artistic excellence, Trotta’s “Win a Free Commission” initiative allows any choir the opportunity to have a work written for them at no cost to the ensemble.\n\nRecently, Dr. Trotta has had world premieres commissioned for conventions at TMEA (Texas Music Educators Association) and ACDA (American Choral Directors Association), in addition to being invited to conduct premieres of commissioned major works at Stern Auditorium / Perelman Stage at Carnegie Hall, and at St. Paul’s Papal Basilica in Rome.\n\nHis works are published through JW Pepper, Carl Fischer, ECS Publishing, MorningStar Music, Hal Leonard, Choristers Guild, BriLee Music, Shawnee Press, Alliance Music, GIA, Kjos, Colla Voce, and Walton Music.\n\nRead reviews of his works in Choral Journal, Choral Scholar, and Gramophone, or watch his Inside Voice interview with JW Pepper.\n\nRecordings can be found on iTunes for the following works: For a Breath of Ecstasy, Light Shines in the Darkness, Seven Last Words, Totus Tuus and Gloria.\n\nWhen he is not traveling for guest conducting and composer residencies, Dr. Trotta spends his time at the beach in Bay Head, New Jersey, where he lives with his wife Rachel.\n\nYou can connect with Michael John Trotta at www.mjtrotta.com\n\n+ Read Bio\n\nCailin Marcel Manson, baritone and conductor, a Philadelphia native, has toured as a soloist and master teacher at major concert venues throughout the United States, Europe and Asia with many organizations, including the Radio-Sinfonieorchester Stuttgart, SWR Sinfonieorchester, Taipei Philharmonic, Bayerische Staatsoper - Münchner Opernfestspiele, Choral Arts Society of Philadelphia, Chamber Orchestra of Philadelphia, Teatro La Fenice, Teatro San Carlo, Konservatorium Oslo, and the Conservatoire de Luxembourg.\n\nHe has also been a guest cantor and soloist at some of the world’s most famous churches and cathedrals, including Notre Dame, Sacré-Coeur, and La Madeleine in Paris, San Marco in Venice, Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, San Salvatore in Montalcino, Santa Maria Maggiore and San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome, Thomaskirche and Nikolaikirche in Leipzig, and Wieskirche in Steingaden.\n\nCailin has held positions as Music Director of the Vorarlberger Musikfest, Music Director and Conductor Laureate of the Chamber Symphony of Atlantic City, Artistic Director and Conductor of the Montgomery County Youth Orchestra, Chair of Vocal Studies at the Hazleton Conservatory for the Performing Arts, Director of Music at The Putney School, and as Music Director of the Bennington County Choral Society.
