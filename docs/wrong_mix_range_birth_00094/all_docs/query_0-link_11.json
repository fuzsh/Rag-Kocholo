Almost a million men returns from fronts of WWI to the country, the unemployment increases, as well as business strikes and general demoralization. General call for a strike is thankfully ignored by Bata workers, but there is also a growing violence among the people and a threat of the Left. Tomáš Baťa sees that he will have to engage in politics as well.\n\nEgypt declared independence from Britain, but UK does not want to loose any rights in the Suez Canal. In New York the first night of Charlie Chaplin’s movie “The Gold-rush” takes place and Josif Vissarinovič Stalin became to the Secretary General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Russia on Lenin’s advice\n\nInflation has reduced purchasing power of exports to almost half level, while increasing bank debt vice versa. Tomáš Baťa decides to risk and to the amazement of experts, reduces the price of shoes on 50 percent. Full stores are sold out. The participants of the Conference of the Czechoslovak Manufactuirers’ Association could not do more more than an eternal appeals to the Government and the Minister of Finance. Bata, who risked so much, – wins.\n\nBenito Mussolini began his “March to Rome”. As a result Italian government resigns and fascists occupy Rome. Albert Einstein received the Nobel Prize in Physics.

He manages to shape Tomas brilliant ideas into quite precise directives and plans. Only now his system allowwing employees’ financial participation (not only on the loss but also on the gain of the workshop) is being born. The Tomas Bata slogan – “I was looking for a way that would enable to work automatically as sunset and sundown – seems to be carried out.\n\nCzech writer Josef Škvorecký was born and the first night of the opera “The Cunning Little Vixen” by Leos Janacek took place in Brno.
