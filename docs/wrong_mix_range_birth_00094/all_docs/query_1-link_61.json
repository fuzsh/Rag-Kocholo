The Works of Bernard Shaw. London: Constable & Co., [1930-1938].\n\nFirst collected edition. One of 1,000 numbered copies (this copy being No. 501), out of a total edition of 1,025 copies. Thirty-three octavo volumes (9 1/8 x 6 inches; 232 x 153 mm.).\n\nOriginal jade green cloth lettered in gilt on spines. Top edge gilt. A fine set of the best edition of Shaw’s works.

Three additional volumes were published, one on 7 June 1934 and two on 1 July 1938. Volume I is the first publication of Shaw’s first novel, Immaturity, written in 1879 (see Laurence).\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw (1856-1950), Irish dramatist, critic, and social reformer. “Political and economic socialism, a new religion of creative evolution, antivivisection, vegetarianism, and spelling reform were a few of his causes…[Shaw] began to write for the stage in 1885. With most of his early plays either banned by the censor or refused production, Shaw sought a reading audience with his first published collection, Plays Pleasant and Unpleasant (1898)…Shaw wrote his best plays prior to, during, and shortly after World War I. They include Man and Superman [1905], John Bull’s Other Island (written [1904] at the request of William Butler Yeats for the Irish Literary Theatre), Major Barbara [1905], Fanny’s First Play (1912), Androcles and the Lion (1912), Pygmalion [1913], Heartbreak House [written 1913, produced 1920], Back to Methuselah [1921], and Saint Joan [1923]. He received the Nobel Prize in literature in 1925…Shaw wrote many essays on socialism, politics, and economics and one longer work, The Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism (1928)” (Benét’s Reader’s Encyclopedia).\n\nLaurence A198a."
