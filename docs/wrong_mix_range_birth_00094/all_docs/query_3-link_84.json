        "text": "At the age of fifteen he went to work as a junior clerk. In 1876 he went to London, joining his sister and mother, who created career as a music teacher. Shaw began his literary career by writing music and drama criticism and novels including the semi-autographical Immaturity without much success. He joined in 1884 the Fabian Society, a middle-class socialist group. He served on its executive committee from 1885 to 1911. As a public speaker Shaw gained a status of one of the most sought-after orators in England. From 1895 to 1898 Shaw became a drama critic for the Saturday Review. These articles were later collected in Our Theatres in the Nineties (1932).\n\nShaw lived the end of his life as an international celebrity, travelling the world, continually involved in local international politics. He continued to write thousands of letters and over a dozen more plays. He visited the S.U. at the invitation of Stalin and he went briefly to the U.S. at the invitation of William Randolph Hearst."
