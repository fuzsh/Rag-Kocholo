        "text": "(July 26, 1856 – November 2nd, 1950)\n\nBiography\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw was born on July 26 1856 in Dublin Ireland the son of a civil servant. Although he was best known for drama, he was also proficient in the areas of journalism, music and literary criticism. He began his literary career as a novelist. Shaw’s works concerned themselves mostly with prevailing social problems, specifically with what he saw as the exploitation of the working middle class. Shaw attended various schools throughout his youth but always harboured an animosity towards schools and teachers. He is quoted as saying that “Schools and schoolmasters, as we have them today, are not popular as places of education and teachers, but rather prisons and turnkeys in which children are kept to prevent them disturbing and chaperoning their parents”.\n\nIn his personal life, Shaw was an avid Socialist and a member of the Fabian society. In 1898 he married fellow Fabian member and Irish heiress Charlotte Payne-Townsend. He was the first person to be awarded the Nobel prize for Literature as well as an Oscar (for his work on Pygmalion, which was an adaptation of his play of the same name). He wrote 60 plays, most of which deal with social themes such as marriage, religion, class government and health care. Two of his greatest influences were Henrik Ibsen and Henry Fielding. Ibsen’s plays and Fielding’s expulsion from playwriting inspired him to write his own plays on the social injustices of the world around him, including the late nineteenth century censorship of plays, continued from Prime Minister Walpole’s rein in the mid 1740s. The Lord Chamberlain’s Examiner of Plays especially irked him:\n\n“A gentleman who robs, insults, and suppresses me as irresistibly as if he were the Tsar of Russia and I the meanest of his subjects… But I must submit [my play] in order to obtain from him an insolent and insufferable document, which I cannot read without boiling of the blood, certifying that in his opinion — his opinion!– my play ‘does not in its general tendency contain anything immoral or otherwise improper for the stage,’ and that the Lord Chamberlain therefore ‘allows’ its performance (confound his impudence!).” (Mainly xv)\n\nGeorge Bernard Shaw died at the age of 94 due to injuries incurred from falling while pruning a tree.\n\nListen to an Interview with George Bernard Shaw from 1937.\n\nIf you would like to know what Shaw thought about something, the NYTimes has an archive of Shaw: his quotes, his opinions, pictures, etc.\n\nWorks\n\nShort Stories\n\nThe Black Girl in Search of God\n\nThe Miraculous Revenge\n\nNovels\n\nImmaturity\n\nCashel Byron’s Profession\n\nThe Unsocial Socialist\n\nThe Irrational Knot\n\nLove Among the Artists\n\nPlays (In chronological order)\n\nPlays Unpleasant\n\nWidowers’ Houses\n\nThe Philanderer\n\nMrs. Warren’s Profession\n\nTo read the script with the Author’s Apology, click HERE.\n\nPlays Pleasant\n\nArms and the Man\n\nCandida\n\nThe Man of Destiny\n\nYou Can Never Tell\n\nThree Plays for Puritans\n\nThe Devil’s Disciple\n\nCaesar and Cleopatra\n\nCaptain Brassbound’s Conversion\n\nThe Admirable Bashville\n\nMan and Superman\n\nJohn Bull’s Other Island\n\nHow He Lied to Her Husband\n\nMajor Barbara\n\nThe Doctor’s Dilemma\n\nGetting Married\n\nThe Glimpse of Reality\n\nThe Fascinating Foundling\n\nPress Cuttings\n\nMisalliance\n\nAnnajanska, The Bolshevik Empress\n\nThe Dark Lady of the Sonnets\n\nFanny’s First Play\n\nOverruled\n\nAndrocles and the Lion\n\nPygmalion\n\nThe Great Catherine\n\nThe Inca of Perusalem\n\nO’Flaherty VC\n\nAugustus Does His Bit\n\nHeartbreak House\n\nBack to Methuselah\n\nSaint Joan\n\nIn the Beginning\n\nThe Gospel of the Brothers Barnabus\n\nThe Thing Happens\n\nTragedy of an Elderly Gentleman\n\nAs Far as Thought Can Reach\n\nThe Apple Cart\n\nToo True to be Good\n\nOn the Rocks\n\nThe Six of Calias\n\nThe Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles\n\nThe Shewing Up of Blanco Posnet\n\nThe Millionaires\n\nGeneva\n\nIn Good King Charles Golden Days\n\nBouyant Billions\n\nShakes Versus Shav\n\nEssays\n\nThe Quintessence of Ibenism\n\nThe Perfect Wagnerite, Commentary on the Ring\n\nMaxims for Revolutionists\n\nPreface to Major Barabara\n\nHow to Write a Popular Play\n\nTreatise on Parents and Children\n\nCommon Sense about the War\n\nThe Intelligent Woman’s Guide to Socialism and Capitalism\n\nDictators-Let Us Have More of Them\n\n“Shaw’s Music: The Complete Musical Criticism of Bernard Shaw in Three Volumes”\n\n“Shaw on Shakespeare: An Anthology of Bernard Shaw’s Writings”\n\nTo see a selection of Shaw’s Essays courtesy of Brown University, click HERE.\n\nReturn to Drama in the Twentieth Century\n\nReferences\n\nShaw, Bernard (1914). //Misalliance, the Dark Lady of the Sonnets, and Fanny’s First Play.
