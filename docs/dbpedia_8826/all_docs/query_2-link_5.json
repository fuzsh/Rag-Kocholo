        "text": "Barcelona, situated in the northeast of the Iberian Peninsula, is the second-largest city in Spain. The city is flanked by the Collserola desert to the west, the rivers Llobregat (to the south) and BÃ©sos (to the north) and the Mediterranean Sea to the east. It looks back on a long and rich history, and exhibits an impressive architectonic heritage, a pleasant climate and an excellent cultural (ludica?) offering. These and others appeals have transformed Barcelona into the third-most visited city in Europe (more than 8 million tourists in 2013), only surpassed by London and Paris. It is no wonder that the service sector is the main economic driver of the city (employing 87.7 % of its population).\n\nIn 2010 the Barcelona city council initiated the Barcelona Interculturality Plan within the framework of the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue (2008) that generated fundamental courses of action like confidence, mutual acknowledgement, effective communication, dialogue and debate, education and exchange, pacific mediation in conflicts and cooperation and coexistence. Innovative programs like the Anti-Rumours project were born then, too.\n\nPresently, Barcelona can count with numerous NGOs and foundations that promote the intercultural perspective. A remarkable example is SAIER (Immigrant, Emigrant and Refugee Service) which offers information and counselling on immigration, emigration, asylum and voluntary repatriation."
