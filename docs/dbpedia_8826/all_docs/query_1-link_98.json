Often it will be a project manager, and one or more artistic directors in charge of your project. These will be the main contacts with whom you will exchange. From then on, they will be at your service, and will listen to your needs while taking into account the specifications carried out throughout your contract.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nWhat is a record label?\n\nA record company is a company that serves the artists and musicians they have “signed” and helps them produce, publish, and distribute their musical works. Do not mix up record company and label. A record company wears several hats. It manufactures, distributes, and promotes the productions of musicians/artists. A record company intervenes from the conception to the marketing of tracks. The company is divided into several departments that exploit all facets of the music industry, in order to make its artists profitable.\n\nWhat are the risks of signing to a record label?\n\nSigning to a record label can have some risks, including the possibility of losing creative control, being financially exploited, and being dropped by the label. However, you could be able to mitigate those risks by doing your research and negotiating your terms the right way.\n\nHow do I find a record label in Barcelona?\n\nTo find a record company in Barcelona, there exist directories that list all the record companies in Barcelona and abroad. These directories often allow you to filter and search by city name. Then you have to get the contact of the person in charge of signatures. It always depends on the size of the record company, but you have to aim for the position of talent scout or A&R.\n\nHow to get spotted by a record company in Barcelona?\n\nTo catch the eye of a label or a record company in Barcelona, you have first and foremost to find a way to get your music listened to. To achieve this, there are different channels you can use: emails, word of mouth, concerts/events, relationships&mldr; There is no precise process. A confirmed artist can be spotted just like a âbedroom producerâ who never released a track before. When you want to be detected, you must not neglect your image, a label will always prefer an artist with an assertive and original image, rather than someone without distinctive traits.\n\nHow to sign in a record label in Barcelona?\n\nSigning with a label or record company is an opportunity not to be missed. There are different ways to catch the eye of a music company in Barcelona and move towards a legal contract. You should be aware that this is often quite a long process for a record company, a signature is never immediate. There is no precise rule for signing on a label. More than anything, it is necessary that your music interests the record company, that it fits to its identity.\n\nHow does the relationship between record companies and artists work?\n\nOnce you have signed with a record company, you will have dedicated people to work with.
