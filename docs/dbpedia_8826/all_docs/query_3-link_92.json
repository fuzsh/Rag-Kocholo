        "text": "Big guide: We are traveling to Barcelona with children. I will advise, everything you need to know! (2024)\n\nI used to fly to Barcelona on my own. I've been here since we had kids we fly together with the whole family: me, my wife Radka and our two children, Malvínka and Tim.\n\nWe have been traveling with our children from a really early age, and I would say traveling even longer distances they manage quite well, if we can entertain them and make the journey itself somehow interesting for them.\n\nIn Barcelona with Malvínka nearby Forum Park.\n\nPeople often ask how small children manage the journey, but given that z You can get from the Czech Republic to Barcelona in just over two hours, not much to deal with. If your kids are a bit used to traveling, I think they'll be fine with flying, even if they're very young. For those of us, the route Prague – Barcelona is more tolerable than traveling by car on the D1 from Prague to visit my parents in Moravia...\n\nI wrote all the observations in this article after one of our vacations in Barcelona, ​​when the older one was 3 years old and the younger one was 10 months old. This is just so that you have an idea and can put the given information into context better.\n\nWhat can you find in this article?\n\nThis article is really long – if there is a specific topic that interests you about traveling to Barcelona with children, jump straight to it:\n\nWhy go to Barcelona with children?\n\nWhen to fly to Barcelona with children?\n\nWhat do you need to know about buying a ticket when you fly with your family?\n\nStaying at the airport with children\n\nTraveling by plane with a child\n\nTravel from the airport to the center of Barcelona with children\n\nWhich ticket to choose when traveling to Barcelona with children?\n\nWhere to stay with children in Barcelona?\n\nWhat to see, experience and do on holiday in Barcelona with children?\n\nMore tips for traveling with children\n\nWhy go to Barcelona with children?\n\nIf you asked me why you should fly to Barcelona with your children, I wouldn't hesitate long and pour out a few positives:\n\nIn the city center, everything is relatively close to each other - you don't have to walk and travel for a long time to see and experience something\n\nThere's always something to do in Barcelona - it's here lots of monuments, museums, parks or attractions...\n\nThe sea is within walking distance from the center - and children love the sea! Mostly.\n\nThere are a lot of parks where you can clean up with the children during the hottest days\n\nIndeed, in every neighborhood you will find several playgrounds.\n\nPublic transport in the city it is (with a few exceptions) wheelchair-accessible, so you can easily bring a stroller with you\n\nLocals have a very positive attitude towards children and \"they are not a problem for them\"\n\nIf you forget something at home, even for very small children, it is not a problem to jump to the store and buy it again. Which is not the case with other, e.g. more exotic destinations.\n\nWhen to fly to Barcelona with children?\n\nThe recommendation regarding the date of the visit is not much different from what I mention in mine ebook about holidays in Barcelona: Barcelona is perfectly accessible all year round and I personally think that you can best enjoy the city with your family right at the beginning or end of the season.\n\nThe weather here during this period will be tolerable and you will meet far fewer tourists than in the main holiday months. We go here every year in April or May. It is not yet suitable for a big swim in the sea, but we are happy to sacrifice that for the fact that the city is not so full of tourists...\n\nMine can also tell you more about when to go here weather article. In it, among other things, you will find the average temperatures in individual months, so you can get a better idea, because he has no idea to describe it in detail here again...\n\nChildren can have fun on Barcelona's beaches even outside the swimming season...\n\nTo sum it up: if you don't really need to swim in the sea, the off-season is better for you both financially and considering the amount of people in town. If, on the other hand, you want to swim and would like to enjoy the sun and the sea, you have to prepare for higher prices and more people.\n\nWhat to know before buying a ticket when flying with your family?\n\nBuying a ticket when you fly to Barcelona with children is exactly the same as when you fly without children. But there are a few small things, which are good to know and pay attention to:\n\nThe cheapest flights are morning and evening. In the case of buying tickets for the whole family, you will certainly save a few thousand, but if you have very small children, I would think twice if departing at night is worth the possible disruption of their biorhythm and well-being.\n\nChildren under 2 fly free or at a fraction of the price on most airlines. Enjoy it while you can. The child is not entitled to its own seat and must be strapped in on your lap, but it's nothing you can't handle.\n\nEven if the child will not be more than 2 years old at the time of the trip and you will not pay anything for his transportation, he needs to get his own ticket. Basically, it is supposed to sit on your lap, but it is possible to have it in a car seat (for an extra charge, see below).\n\nIf you have a child older than 2 years, the price of the ticket will usually be the same when traveling to Barcelona as it is for you. I recommend keeping track of cheap and discounted tickets and following the available dates rather than subjecting your visit to the city to when you have free time.\n\nIf you're flying with your family, you're sure to lug a lot of stuff. Do not at all costs try to take everything on board with you in hand luggage and pay for checked baggage as normal. You can even have a pram or cot transported for free (see below).\n\nBe careful where you sit. Some low-cost airlines can move you to different seats on the plane without blinking an eye, even within one order, so it's better to pay a few euros extra for seat selection to be sure that you will all sit together. If you buy your ticket from an agent and not directly from the airline, there may be problems with seat selection. Therefore - unless there is a major difference in price - I always book tickets directly with the airline.\n\nIf you are flexible about the deadline, it's worth watching for discounted tickets. A flight from Prague to Barcelona in the off-season can cost less than CZK 1000 per person, so for a family of four, you would pay CZK 4 for a return trip, which is a really great offer. (Cheap flights to Barcelona are offered by low-cost airlines such as Ryanair or Wizzair or Vueling).\n\nHow about transporting a stroller and other baby equipment?\n\nYou can have a stroller on board\n\nIf you have a child under 2 years old in a stroller, you can transport the stroller free of charge as checked baggage or take it with you on board the plane. When checking in, you only need to report this item and you will receive a sticker on the stroller. Then you proceed normally through all the checks to the gate you fly from. After check-in, you leave the stroller just before entering the plane, by its door. You'll also find it there once you exit. If it happens that he is not there, you will find him on the baggage belt or at the oversized baggage claim.\n\nIn addition to a stroller, what other baby equipment can you transport by plane for free?\n\nDepending on who you are flying with, the conditions for transporting other children's equipment also differ. E.g. Ryanair or Vueling allows free check-in and transport of a total of two pieces of children's luggage. You can take, for example, a cot or a car seat with you to Barcelona. Again - there is no need to report anything in advance, just arrive on time for check-in. I definitely recommend researching the terms and conditions of a specific carrier or calling customer support to find out how things are.\n\nChurros you can enjoy in Barcelona even if you have a child on your shoulders :-)\n\nWith children at the airport\n\nOnce you and your kids arrive at the airport, find the departure board and find out which counter will be checking in for your flight. All you have to do is present your ID card or passport together with your ticket at the counter. Here, the attendant will give you your boarding pass and weigh and tag your luggage.\n\nThat way, you can leave all your luggage at check-in that you won't be taking on board with you. You can check in the mentioned pram, car seat, cot or other baby equipment here free of charge (it depends on the airline). Even if you want to take the stroller with you on board, you must take a sticker with information about the destination on it here.\n\nWith your boarding pass in hand, you can proceed to the security check.\n\nWhat about food and drink for children at the security checkpoint?\n\nI recommend keeping all food and drinks for children separate in a separate bag from your other belongings. You will facilitate and speed up the inspection. It is because baby food is not subject to the standard limits regarding the transport of liquids. You can simply have, for example, food and drink for children in a volume larger than 100 ml and they do not have to be in separate bags. However, you must have all other children's items such as hygiene and cosmetics (pastes, creams, gels,...) in containers of max. 100 ml in a resealable plastic bag.\n\nHow does the actual security check with the child take place?\n\nDuring the security check, you have to put all your hand-on items in the carrier on the belt and, if you have a stroller with you, take everything out of it and put it on the belt for inspection. Then just go through the safety frame: if your child can walk, he should go through on his own. Otherwise, you will go through the frame first and only then will you return for the child and walk through again with him in your arms. If you are flying alone without a partner, the child will be looked after and held by the attendant.\n\nThen just collect all your things and head towards the appropriate departure gate - behind security you'll find the boards with the departure gate numbers, so just search for your flight and you're good to go.\n\nMy tip for Václav Havel Prague Airport\n\nIf you are flying from Prague, I highly recommend spending the time waiting for the plane in a room for families with children. It is located on the 3rd floor of Terminal 2 and, in addition to a few emergency toys, you will find a changing table, a microwave or comfortable chairs, which will make waiting for the plane with children a little more bearable than at the departure gate...\n\nWhat advantages do families with children have when starting?\n\nAir travel with children also has one nice advantage: many companies (e.g. Iberia, Vueling,...) offer priority boarding especially for families with children. So while others will have to stand in line and wait to get on the plane, you can go straight inside and start getting comfortable on the plane.\n\nWhen flying home from Barcelona, ​​don't hesitate to use the priority lane for families with children at the security check: you don't have to wait in a long line with other passengers, and there's also a playpen where you can put your child while preparing things for inspection.\n\nWith a child on board the plane\n\nThe flight from Prague to Barcelona is short, but don't forget that the child will need to be entertained on board somehow. Therefore, take with you at least two favorite books, several smaller toys or tablets with games or movies.\n\nAlso, don't forget that really small children can have earaches due to pressure changes during takeoff and landing. It is therefore good to prepare for it. in small children, breast-feeding, a pacifier, or something to drink can help against ear pain. Candies or chewing gum can help older children.\n\nFamily trip by plane to Barcelona\n\nIf you see that the child does not tolerate the flight and makes it known loudly to everyone around, try asking the flight attendant, I wonder if you could take a seat somewhere where you will have more peace, you will not be stressed about it and you will not disturb other fellow travelers. Sometimes some seats are unoccupied and in most cases this can be arranged without any problem.\n\nIf you need to feed the baby during the flight, again it is not a problem to arrange with the flight attendants and have your food heated in the microwave. Older children will certainly not disdain food that you prepared at home or bought at the airport. The flight lasts only two hours, but children can sometimes be unpredictable in this regard - even if they ate just before the flight, they will easily demand something else to eat after boarding the plane :-) That's why I personally prefer to have supplies ready than to buy overpriced and not very nutritionally nutritious food on board.\n\nA lot of parents also don't know that airplanes tend to have some of the toilets changing table. You can usually find it in the back of the plane. If you need to use it during the flight, don't hesitate.\n\nThe flight from Prague to Barcelona flies by quickly, you don't have to worry about that. When planning, I recommend not to underestimate the time needed to get out of the airport and transportation to the city. We are usually the last to leave the plane. On the one hand, because we don't want to squeeze with others on the way out, and on the other hand, because you don't gain much by leaving early. You'll have to wait at baggage claim anyway, so why stress about leaving the plane 10 minutes early or late?\n\nWhat do you need to know about transporting children under 2 years old on an airplane?\n\nAs I wrote above, a child under 2 years old has a free ticket, or they pay about 10% of the price of a normal ticket. The disadvantage is that he is not entitled to his own seat, cabin baggage or refreshments during the flight. You can only transport a small child on your lap or in a car seat.\n\nTransporting a child on your lap\n\nIf you want to have a baby on your lap, you can't just hold it or have it in a carrier or a sling. To transport it, you will receive a special belt from the flight attendant to attach it to your belt. If you have never flown like this, do not hesitate to listen to the instructions and let yourself be shown how to use the belt. It may take a while to pin the first time, but once you've done it a few times, the whole process won't take you more than 15 seconds. The need to use this belt is the same as for adults: if the light above the seat indicates the need to fasten the seat belt, both you and the child must wear it.\n\nTransporting a child in a car seat\n\nTo ensure greater comfort and protection, I recommend taking a car seat with you on board. You then normally buckle up on the seat next to you. However, it should be taken into account that the price of a ticket for a child will be higher than in the previous case. You pay about 75% of the normal price for a ticket for a child with a car seat. All seats that you take with you on the plane must be approved for this type of transport. In this case, it is not only about safety factors, but also about dimensions, where its width must not exceed 42 cm. Otherwise, the seat might not fit in the seat…\n\nTravel with children from the airport to the center of Barcelona\n\nOnce you have all the transported items with you, you can go to the means of transport that will take you to the center. There are many transport options to the center of Barcelona, for a family with children, I recommend narrowing down the choice to a train, airbus or subway. The individual options are roughly the same in terms of time - the journey usually takes 30-40 minutes. What differs are the intervals of the individual connections and the prices.\n\nTransport by train\n\nThe train journey is comfortable and with a T-casual ticket the cheapest ever. We use the train quite often. But what you have to catch are the departures: The train runs between the center and the airport throughout the day at half-hourly intervals. This means that if you miss one connection, the next one will be in half an hour at the earliest. Which wouldn't be a problem if there was something to do in the \"departure hall\". Quotation marks are appropriate because there are really only two platforms, a couple of ticket machines and a small bistro. Nothing more. And going back to the airport would be pointless.\n\nThe destination station when using the train is usually Barcelona-Sants or Passeig de Gràcia, from where you can conveniently connect to another type of transport. More information about train travel.\n\nYou can shorten the wait for the train from the airport in the only bistro that is right next to the platform...\n\nTransportation by airbus\n\nA better, but slightly more expensive, option to get to the center is the aerobus. This is an airport bus that stops right in front of the airport building and takes you right to the city center (Pl. Espanya or Pl. Catalunya). A return ticket costs a little over €10, children under 4 pay nothing. The advantage of the aerobus is that these lines run from the airport throughout the day at 5-10 minute intervals. This should be your choice if you arrive in the evening or even at night and need to get to your place of residence really quickly. More information about airbus transport.\n\nTransportation by subway\n\nThe last option is the subway. This will get you to the center the fastest, in about 25 minutes. But its downside is that the L9 line here does not go through the tightest center and you will most likely have to transfer once or twice to get where you need to go. And I also see as a disadvantage that you cannot use regular public transport tickets for the airport metro - you need to buy a special \"airport ticket\". If you decide to use it, children under 4 pay nothing, just like in the case of the aerobus. More information about metro transport.\n\nOf course, you can also get to the center from the airport by regular bus. But the one for a family with children is not very comfortable and the journey can be unnecessarily long. There is also an option taxi, but if you have more children and you don't have a car seat with you, I wouldn't risk it. In any case, if you are interested in the transport to the center from the airport in detail, take a look my ebook. There you will find significantly more information - it includes, for example, the operating hours of individual means of transport, exact prices and places to buy tickets...\n\nSnapshot from a train trip in Barcelona\n\nWhich ticket to choose for traveling around the city?\n\nOne of the most frequent questions that other parents ask me is about which ticket to choose for traveling around the city.\n\nI usually tell them that it is it depends on several factors:\n\nHow long will you be in town?\n\nWhat do you want to see?\n\nWhere will you stay?\n\nHow much are you or are you not used to walking?\n\nAlone center of Barcelona it is relatively compact and all distances can be covered relatively well on foot, even with smaller children or with a stroller. However, on the second breath, I add that I think that during your stay there will not be a situation where you would be without public transport completely bypassed. In short, you will have to buy a ticket.\n\nBarcelona's public transport is almost completely barrier-free - you won't have a problem with a stroller at most stations\n\nIn general, it makes sense for tourists to think about the ticket T-casual (10 rides, non-portable), T-familiar (8 rides, portable) or one of tourist cards. General overview of all public transport tickets in Barcelona can be found in a separate article.\n\nIt really depends a lot on what program you will have and how much you will probably want to use the transport. My experience is that if you have small children under 4 years old and you don't live far from the center, you can get by just fine with T-casual. We used 10 of these tickets during our last 3-day stay in Barcelona. Although it is true that we also walked a lot...\n\nIf you have older children, it's really up to you to decide which one will be better in the end T-casual or one of the tourist cards. They often include public transport and many other benefits. It is, for example, very interesting for families with children Barcelona Card Family, where the price also includes admission to the most popular attractions for families with children.\n\nOtherwise, there is no such thing as a family or group ticket for public transport in Barcelona.\n\nHow old do children need a separate ticket?\n\nIf your children are under 4 years old, they can use all public transport for free. This also applies if they have a stroller, nothing has to be paid for it here. If children are older, they must have their own ticket. Unfortunately, there is no difference between child and adult fares, so the price for anyone older than 4 years will be the same...\n\nWhat about pushchairs on public transport in Barcelona?\n\nYou can easily use the local public transport even if you have the smallest children. Prams, baby carriers or scarves are perfectly fine here and the locals are used to it. The transport system here is largely barrier-free and almost all stations have lifts. The exception is about 15 stations out of 160 (I have attached a map at your ebook). I recommend studying it and if you have a stroller, avoid stops and stations without elevators. There are few of them, but they also include entrances to some large stations such as Passeig de Gracia.\n\nIf you're traveling on the subway, most normal strollers can be pushed through the turnstile. Although it is often just like that, it is possible. If you don't want to or it's not possible, use the elevator or the special entrance for wheelchair users, which is always sometimes at the entrance and which is wider.\n\nAccommodation in Barcelona with children\n\nI have all the essential information about accommodation again your ebook, here I will give just a few basic tips that you should know when choosing a hotel, guesthouse or apartment during your vacation in Barcelona.\n\nDo not really underestimate the location where you will live. With children, I strongly recommend a place from which you will not have to commute or commute for a long time to the center or to selected monuments. Accommodation outside the center or outside the city only if you are very limited by budget or the offer of accommodation facilities.\n\nPersonally, we like to stay with our children anywhere on the axis Barceloneta – They will go crazy. The advantage is mainly that it is a short distance from the sea and not the busiest center. Last time we were in Hotel Princess Barcelona, which had a large one right next to it shopping center Diagonal Mar (or slightly more distant Westfield Glories), the Museum of Natural Sciences (NAT), a large playground and the beach was less than a 10-minute walk away.\n\nIf you are staying in a hotel, choose the one with breakfast or pay extra for it. So you can start each day together without stressing about what the children will eat :-)\n\nWhen booking hotel accommodation, don't forget to write somewhere in the notes that you will be with children and that you have, for example, any specific requirements - e.g. that you want a cot. In most larger hotels this is not a problem.\n\nYou can comfortably stay in one room with really small children. Sometimes it is difficult to book it through some reservation services, because hotels will refuse to put more people in one room than 2 adults and one child. The solution is to order it online and mention the existence of the second child at check-in. We do it that way and there is no problem with it - one child in the crib, the other on the bed with us. Or you can contact the hotel directly and try to order by e-mail or phone.\n\nA family with older children should always look for a suite (suite type), which contains multiple rooms within a single room or connected rooms.\n\nIf you can't fit in one room, agree with the hotel that you want at least rooms with children next to each other.\n\nWith children, it is also worth looking at hotel apartments, which they have a kitchen with a fridge or at least a minibar. Yogurts or other food that you need to keep cold can be hidden there.\n\nIf you plan to take a stroller with you, ask yourself whether the accommodation facility has an elevator, or think about whether you can manage the logistics without it. Most Barcelona apartments in buildings (especially in the center) do not have elevators and only have narrow corridors with very steep stairs. It can be done, but it's a stretch.\n\nIf you have a large family or want to save on accommodation and eating out, instead of a hotel, look for an apartment or apartment via Airbnb.\n\nIf you choose Airbnb, thoroughly research the property, look at the description, amenities and read reviews to see if the place is suitable for children.\n\nBarcelona hotel tips for families\n\nBelow are some recommendations for family hotels and hostels.\n\nMH Apartments – nice apartments in several locations around Barcelona: Gracia, Lyceum, Avenue, Tetouan, Sagrada Familia, etc.\n\nNovotel Barcelona City – super hotel with plenty of double and family rooms\n\nGrand Central Hotel – hotel for more demanding clients in gothic quarter with a large selection of apartments and rooms for families (yes, there is an infinity pool on the roof...)\n\nAparthotel Arai – a smaller but tastefully furnished hotel in the city center\n\nEurostars Grand Marina – a large hotel right next to the harbor and a short distance from the famous La Rambla\n\nPetit Palace Hotel – a small boutique hotel right in the center of Barcelona\n\nHotel Regina – a stylish hotel in the district Eixample, not far from sights like Casa Batllo or Casa Mila\n\nHostal Benidorm – a cheaper hotel for the undemanding in the center\n\nIf you haven't chosen from the hotels above, simply drive through Booking (for hotels, apartments or hostels) or perhaps airbnb (for private accommodation).\n\nWhat to see and do in Barcelona with children?\n\nIf you decide to go to Barcelona with children, be prepared to accomplish significantly less than if you were there alone. This is especially true if you have smaller children like us. But I suppose you know that any detailed plan with children usually fails in the end... ;)\n\nThis is also the reason why we don't spend much time exploring the city together with them. We usually have it one bigger goal for the morning, the other for the afternoon and everything we come across along the way gets in between.\n\nIn Barcelona, ​​you can find a playground or park on almost every corner...\n\nIf you are going on holiday to Barcelona, there's no point stressing about arriving an hour late. This is exactly why we prefer to fly here for longer stays rather than shorter ones. (Really, you won't get much done here with the kids in two or three days).\n\nWhat must you visit with children?\n\nOn this site you will only find a list of places that you must not miss with children. We checked them all for you with our children :-)\n\nAquarium – this is a certainty for both young and old who love the sea and all kinds of creatures that live in it. The aquarium is open all year round from 9.30:21.00 a.m. to XNUMX:XNUMX p.m. and you will find hundreds of animals and plants in it, from the smallest crustaceans to large sand sharks. The most popular part of the aquarium is the long glass tunnel, through which you can walk and admire the view of the sea life around you. Part of the Barcelona aquarium is fully interactive and is intended for the smallest children - they can learn more about the workings of the seas and their inhabitants by means of touch, sounds and special images. Buy tickets online because there are huge queues, especially in high season.\n\nBig Fun Museum - not far from of La Rambla is this unique museum of illusions that will be loved by young and old... Ideal for incredible photos, for example for your Instagram :-)\n\nBotanical gardens on Motjuïc – if you are going to the Montjuiïc hill, you must not miss this place.

Right next to the playground is a booth with a tiny bistro where you can have a coffee.

This 60 meter high column standing by the harbor at the end of the famous La Rambla offers all visitors a breathtaking panoramic view of the city and the adjacent port. If you're worried that the children won't climb up, you don't have to - there's an elevator in the middle of the monument that takes you up to the top for the price of a ticket, from where there's a nice view of port and surroundings.\n\nSwimming in the sea – from the center, it's a short walk to the sea, so if you're heading here in season, pack your swimsuit and explore the beaches here.\n\nLego Store Barcelona – all kids love Lego! This is one of the must stops if you are wandering around the shopping streets of Passeig de Gràcia. In addition to a large number of Lego kits, you will find large models of existing Barcelona landmarks such as Sagrada Família. Even if you don't plan to buy anything, this place is worth a visit with kids.\n\nMagic fountain - Singing Fountain on the hill of Montjuïc belongs to the proven Barcelona classics. I recommend going here with older children, as the individual shows don't start until after dark, so that the resulting effect is as great as possible. In the period from November to March, the first performance is at 7 in the evening, in the period from April to October, then from 9 in the evening. From this hour on, every half hour the fountain offers all newcomers a spectacular performance combining water, light and music.\n\nMuseum of Music – more than 500 musical instruments in this museum will especially delight parents with children who prefer classical music...\n\nMaritime Museum – not far from La Rambla you will find a maritime museum with a lot of beautiful exhibits and there is even a schooner moored not far from the museum, from which you can take a look as part of the entrance fee.\n\nMuseum of Natural Sciences (NAT) – if your children are close to nature, you simply cannot miss this museum.\n\nCosmocaixa Science Museum – this museum will be loved by both young and old. Something like iQlandia or Brno's Vida. If you decide to go to Tibidabo (see below), you must not miss the science museum called Cosmocaixa along the way - this is an eo experience that you should not miss! This is not a boring tour where you and your children have to stand quietly and listen to someone, quite the opposite - it is an interactive exhibition where it is highly recommended to touch things, examine them, play with them and find out how they work.\n\nA park with a labyrinth in the Horta district – mazes are loved by young and old alike! If you go to the Horta district, you must not miss the local labyrinth park. You can get lost in it for tens of minutes, and if you have a bad sense of direction, you can stay here much longer :-)\n\nSpanish Village or Poble Espanyol, which will introduce you to what ordinary Spanish life looks like - it is an open-air museum where you can find demonstrations of crafts, cultural performances or shops\n\nBoat trip – Golondrinas boats moor at the very end of La Rambla street; treat yourself to a drive along the harbor or out to sea.\n\nTibidabo Amusement Park – this is one of the \"must do\" things when visiting Barcelona: take the cable car to the theme park and then enjoy some of the many attractions; Tibidabo is the name of a hill rising just above Barcelona. But don't be fooled - you don't have to leave the city for it, as it is easily accessible by public transport. Thanks to this, I would compare it to Prague's Petřín. But the views it offers are incomparably better. Your children will be most interested in the old but stylish amusement park here. It offers several attractions, while the vast majority of them will entertain children aged 5-12. You will find a roller coaster, a house of horrors, Viking and pirate ships, trampolines, merry-go-rounds, all kinds of trains and other great attractions.\n\nAmusement park PortAventura – if you have more time to visit Spain and you like to travel, do not hesitate to go to the town of Salou, where there is an amazing amusement park called PortAventura.\n\nZoo – do your children like animals? Then you must not miss the city zoo, which is located not far from the local one city ​​park (which is also worth a visit!). The local zoo boasts a large collection of mammals (monkeys, hippos, wolves, anteaters, gazelles,...), birds (flamingos, penguins, parrots,...), amphibians and reptiles. One of the most popular animals here are the dolphins, whose show you can watch several times a day. However, I recommend coming as soon as possible - in the peak season, you can wait in line for a ticket for up to 3 hours.\n\nDo you need a babysitter in Barcelona? No problem!\n\nIf for any reason you need babysitting in Barcelona, ​​you can use it Nanny Line services. I have no personal experience with it and discovered it more or less by accident. So if anyone has used it, let me know how it went and what it was like...\n\nMy 3 tips for traveling with children\n\nTip 1: Less is more\n\nDo you know what the most common mistake of first-time parents who travel is? He tries to think of all the cases that may arise on the way. The size of the luggage can be a good indication of how often the family travels... :-)\n\nNo, seriously now – try to pack as little as possible for the trip and take only the most important things. The reason is simple: every kilo counts when traveling by air, and don't forget that sooner or later you will most likely have to carry a child in addition to your suitcase. (Yes, even the one that can walk).\n\nBarcelona is not a jungle, it is a modern metropolis, so if you accidentally don't take something (or forget something at home), it's no problem to run into one of the shopping centers and buy it there. This applies to everything from diapers to baby food to clothing.\n\nDon't want to haul baby stuff? Use rental companies\n\nIf you have small children, you tend to take more with you on the trip rather than less. One of the ways to lighten your luggage is to use one of the rental shops for children's items in Barcelona. Whether it's a pram, cot, bath tub or even toys, everything can be ordered online and then delivered directly to the hotel during your stay. It's not the cheapest issue (stroller approx. from 25 euro/day), but if you don't want to deal with all that, or you forget something important, it's not that bad.\n\nBackpack Baby\n\nWhen we flew to Barcelona with the then one-year-old Malvínka, we unwisely decided that we would not take the stroller with us. Why - we have a baby carrier! But you can't tell a child, and about the third day after she was chained to one of us every day, she started to make it clear that she didn't like it. Considering that we were in Barcelona for 2 weeks at the time, after calculating the rental fee, we preferred to run to the first store and there we bought a nice Nuna carriage at a discount of about 80 euros. From that day on, she mainly drove here and she and we enjoyed exploring the city more.\n\nTip 2: Have enough time for everything\n\nFor some it may be banality, for others it's an obvious thing, but today and every day I meet many families with children who fail in the very basic organization of time.\n\nIn short, traveling with children is completely different from traveling alone. What takes you an hour might take two or three with children. Parents who are going to Barcelona and want to do 5-6 sights in a day often write to me on the website and ask if it is realistic. It isn't. If you love yourself and your children and don't want to sprint from one thing to another and not have anything in the city in the end...\n\nIn practice, this also means that you they started packing earlier than the day before the flight. To arrive at the airport well in advance, because you have to check in your luggage, go through security (where you will have to take EVERYTHING out of the stroller), buy food and drink, and board the plane itself.\n\nExpect something to go wrong: the bus to the airport misses you, you miss the subway transfer or that you simply stay longer at the security check. You certainly don't want to miss a plane for a few minutes.\n\nWhen we were in Barcelona for the first time with our Malvínka, we wanted to take the train from the airport to the center. We had an arrival flight sometime around 9:XNUMX in the evening, the train left at XNUMX, we thought we would manage everything nicely. The first delay awaited us at baggage claim. The second came shortly after we reached the platform and got stuck buying a train ticket. I kept my eyes on the train clock showing the departure and tried to slow down the time. In vain. The train left right in front of us and the next one left in half an hour. We were all quite tired, especially our little one, who let us and the whole neighborhood know it loudly. And not only until the arrival of the train, but also during the next trip to the city. Quite a stress. I would rather reach for this story today in such a situation taxi or airbus, which costs more than the train, but runs more often and the journey is faster...\n\nTip 3: Talk to the children about the journey\n\nFor some, it's something they do normally, for others it can save their nerves. Tell the children where you are going, how the trip will go, what awaits them at the airport during check-in, during checks, on the plane, etc. When they understand everything before the trip, they will ask less questions when you need to solve logistics or other things.\n\nAnd that's all!
