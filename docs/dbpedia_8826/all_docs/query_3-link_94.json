        "text": "As I reflect on the racism and discrimination that influential figures like Dianne Abbott have faced, I find myself feeling disgusted, though not shocked. It doesn't get any less infuriating to witness the deep-rooted biases and systemic barriers that Black women continue to encounter. Just because it comes from a party that has faces like ours it doesn't make it ok. It is gaslighting at another level. The reality is, these experiences of racism and discrimination are not new. They have been ingrained in our societies for far too long. However, we must acknowledge and address them head-on because it is 2024 and we are still having the same damn conversations. In the UK, studies by the Runnymede Trust reveal the disproportionate levels of racial discrimination faced by Black women in various aspects of their lives. These findings serve as a wake-up call, reminding us of the urgent need to dismantle the structures that perpetuate such inequality. Today, let's channel our disgust and frustration into action. Let's amplify the voices of Black women, listen to their experiences, and uplift their stories. We must create safe and inclusive spaces where their talents, contributions, and perspectives are not only recognised but celebrated and appreciated. We need to be standing against racism and anti-Blackness and work towards a more just and equitable society.\n\n\"Many Black women in positions of leadership earnestly believe that they cannot afford the luxury of a more integral moral ecology because they are being made to choose between their livelihoods and their ideals.\" It is imperative that we make professional space for Black women to share their collective abuse. I can only hope to be of support as I continue to advocate for those who work directly and indirectly with me. I live at the intersection of anti-Black maleness in a field that views my peers as vectors and villains while Black women live in a wholly different place where they are expected to bring #BlackGirlMagic to fix decades-long internal abuses without support to dismantle to status quo. And if they ever do that nearly impossible work, they will pay a dear price...often with public admonition. To address these issues takes transparency and higher levels of support. It was nothing but shocking to see first-hand the professional abuses that a Black woman in leadership faced at an org that I led. 1) Staff openly questioning her academic credentials (read: Black women don't/can't earn doctorate degrees) 2) One individual stating that they did not want to report to her but to a white leader who didn't even have her skill set (read: I prefer reporting to someone who looks like me) 3) A Black woman peer who sent numerous threatening text messages if she preformed corrective action on her due to her egregious and demeaning behavior with staff and peers (read: Not all skin folk are kin folk) 4) A white man who was being investigated for improper behavior who was immediately terminated for attempting to destroy evidence who then became verbally & physically aggressive which led to her locking herself into an office and having to call the police (read: Black women must already know their place on society's Privilege Flag Pole) 5) Being told by staff that she should not have called the police and that she must have done something wrong to make the white terminated employee so upset (read: Be prepared to die and then have people say you were complicit in your own death) Too many Black women have these and worse experiences on a habitual basis. Systemic violence is putting your head in the sand and hoping that well-meaning \"Allies\" who have no history of openly supporting Black women will suddenly do so when faced with their daily realities. We must do better. #iSupportBeverly #TrustBlackWomen\n\nThe world continuously fails to recognize the value and humanity of Black women. It's disheartening to navigate through the constant barrage of misogynoir saturating social media platforms. Whether it's contentious debates over the worth of figures like Amanda Seales, or the callous exchanges among rappers regarding their impact on Black women and girls, the exhaustion is palpable. These pervasive stereotypes surrounding Black women's bodies persist both within and outside our community. As Professor William 'Lez' Henry astutely notes, our reality is often depicted as \"‘othered’, dehumanized, subjugated, and misrepresented.\" The array of caricatures—from the Jezebel to the Sapphire, the Angry Black Woman to the Mammy—have shaped harmful narratives that influence how people perceive and engage with us. It's not surprising, then, that incidents like Drew Barrymore's recent misstep, wherein she invoked the Mammy trope, occur. This mistake is particularly galling considering the Mammy stereotype has historically served the interests of mainstream white America, from the era of enslavement to the present day. Black women continually pour our love and labor into the world, yet too often, it remains unreciprocated. We're exhausted from constantly juggling roles and expectations, only to find that our efforts are undervalued and overlooked. As a Black woman who invested time and energy in crafting this message, I implore you to reciprocate this appreciation by acknowledging the struggles we face and actively working towards a more equitable and inclusive world.\n\nYou want to know what happens when you put Black women in positions of Power without addressing the systems of oppression and racism in which they navigate? Claudine Gay. In these positions we have responsibility, but rarely do we have Authority and true support. We may have allies who show up when it’s aesthetically pleasing or self serving. But in times of conflict, we rarely have accomplices who are willing to do what’s right. To disrupt systems, policies, and narratives they benefit from. The closed door support means NOTHING! Why am I only talking about Black women when it happens to others? Let’s not forget, in order to get in these positions where we are the FIRST and ONLY (which is often unsafe for us), we have endured and navigated terrian you couldn’t imagined. We’ve out performed, out produced and sacrificed far more than our predecessors…only to sit under a lens of zero tolerance and scrutiny. When I say I specialize in organizational wellness THIS is why. This is trauma and organizations and institutions have a role in dismantling the systems that maintain it.\n\nConfronting Misogyny and Racism: The Unacceptable Reality for High-Profile Black Women Recent revelations regarding the racist remarks by Frank Hester, the Tory Party's largest donor, are deeply troubling. Persistent Attacks: The vile and baseless hatred aimed at Diane Abbott, the pioneering Black female MP, is utterly reprehensible. A woman of grace, she has tirelessly served her electorate. There is a disturbing pattern in the way affluent, middle-aged white men perpetuate toxic rhetoric against prominent black women like Diane Abbott, laying bare the deep-rooted misogyny and racism. The Disturbing Silence: Equally troubling is the Conservative Party's tepid response. As of this writing, they have failed to categorise the incident as racist, merely deeming it \"unacceptable.\" This lack of accountability is disheartening. Addressing Racism: Educate: We must promote education and raise awareness on systemic racism and unconscious bias. Advocate: It's crucial to speak out against discrimination and demand accountability from our leaders. Support: Let's stand in solidarity with those facing prejudice, amplifying their voices and experiences. We must amplify the voices of black women leaders and ensure they are not just heard but truly respected. They deserve to navigate their careers without fear of hatred or violence. Commending Diane Abbott's Resilience: Diane Abbott's unwavering resilience in the face of relentless attacks is commendable. Her courage serves as a beacon for the ongoing fight for equality and justice. However, it's important to remember that she is human. Perceiving black women as eternally strong does not justify the abysmal treatment they endure, especially from privileged white men. A Call for Accountability: It is imperative for Hester, who perpetuated hate and discrimination against Diane Abbott, to face consequences. We must demand better from our leaders and our society. Let's stand united against misogyny and racism, creating a world where every individual is valued and respected. 🌟✊"
