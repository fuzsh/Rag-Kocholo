        "text": "TRAVEL - 02 WangMingru & 27 Rao Yujie\n\nHi. We are students of English at Fujian University of Technology in China. In class, our teacher introduced us to the beautiful city of Barcelona and watched a video about Barcelona's scenic architecture, tourism and culture. Through the video, I learned that Barcelona is a world-renowned Mediterranean scenic tourist destination and a world-renowned historical and cultural city. I also saw that it is the most famous tourist destination in Spain, with its pleasant climate, beautiful scenery and monuments, as well as the \"Pearl of the Iberian Peninsula\". Everything there is artistic, the graffiti on the streets, the street food, the magnificent Romanesque buildings, and so on. Even the people of Barcelona say that \"art and life are inseparable\". Barcelona is full of art, and we are looking forward to it. We will come and see the beautiful city of Barcelona for ourselves some time.\n\nTravel - linjie212,xiaopan206,ruihan231\n\nThere's nowhere in the world like Barcelona. This city is magnetic. Food, Art, beaches, streets, buildings, and so on. Barcelona is all-inclusive. Summer is the best season to visit Barcelona because many festivals are celebrated in the summer, such as the European Music Festival. Barcelona is deeply proud of its Catalan heritage, which captivates me! Spaniards are elegant, even if they dress casually. Convenient traffic, a beautiful environment, and qualified talents are the advantages of Barcelona. As far as we know, if we have not seen the church of Barcelona, the trip to Barcelona is not complete. Therefore, this church also attracts us. Hopefully, after COVID-19 is over, we will be able to stroll through the streets of Barcelona and visit these famous churches.\n\ntravel - Yang Yinuo114 Chen Xin121 Zhou Yushu 123\n\nHello, we are students from China. After browsing your website, we are interested in Barcelona. According to the information we got, Barcelona is also world famous because of Gaudi. We are very eager to have the opportunity to learn about the works left by this architectural genius, such as the famous architecture like Casa Vicens, Palau Guell, and Casa Milá. Can you offer us some suggestions for visiting these architectures? In addition, we have seen that Barcelona has a lot of delicious food and the island is surrounded by seawater, so we bet there are many desirable seafood dishes. Besides, we saw some flamenco dancing performances, which were very energetic. We hope that you will let us know about this kind of performance with Spanish passion and national spirit. I hope that we will be able to visit Barcelona after the epidemic is over.\n\nTavel - Yang Yinuo114 Zhou Yushu123 Chen Xin 121\n\nHello, we are students from China.

After browsing this website, we are particularly interested in Barcelona! Life in this city is really rich! In Barcelona, we can enjoy all kinds of Mediterranean cuisine and visit the art museum during the day. At night, the nightlife in Barcelona also attracts us. We can go to the bar to drink and listen to wonderful music, and we can dance in the discotheque. There are many special cultures that we really want to experience. We look forward to being here in person one day!\n\nTravel - Linjie212 xiaopan206 ruihan231\n\nThere's nowhere in the world like Barcelona. This city is magnetic.

We knew a little bit about Barcelona before. After your introduction, we have a better idea of it. Thanks to your website for giving us so many tips on visiting Barcelona. This guide is really useful for us. We have bookmarked this site and we hope we can use your guide on the day we go. We are looking forward to going to Barcelona.\n\ncomment - 08 Liu si qing 16 Wu seng ping 28 Jia mao zhen\n\nHello, everyone! Through this website, we have a simple and profound understanding of Barcelona. Barcelona has a long coastline. It has launched a \"smoke-free beach\" policy, which will better protect the environment. Besides, Catalan National Art Museum leaves a deep impression on us. There are the Renaissance and Baroque collections which attract us very much. Last but not least, music is everywhere. The Palace of Music has a stunning ornate appearance. There is a rule that photos cannot be taken during the performance. If you want to take pictures, you can do so before or after the performance. We are looking forward to going there one day.\n\ncomment - 08 Liu si qing 16 Wu sen ping 28 jia mao zhen\n\nHello, everyone!

We find the same rules in many religious places in the world.\n\nHave a good stay in Catalonia,\n\nArchitecture - Zheng Jiayi216, Lai Xinying227\n\nHi, we are Chinese students, after browsing this website, we have a further understanding of Barcelona and are deeply attracted by the ancient gorgeous architectural style of Barcelona. When we know that there are many famous artists in Barcelona, we are surprised by this kind of strong artistic atmosphere. I hope one day we can come to Barcelona and experience this atmosphere.\n\nBy the way, we think many of the buildings in Barcelona have some religious elements, such as Barcelona Cathedral. However we are not very clear about religion, we wonder if there are any taboos when visiting?\n\nTravel - Jianing224&Xiaoni226\n\nCosta Dorada, with its distinctive character and historical interest, is a place that I am longing for. The towns here have vineyards, olive groves, and even vegetable gardens that I would love to experience for myself. In addition, as far as we know, Barcelona has pickpockets, so the safety problem is one of our concerns. Besides, we are students who travel. The price is also something we need to consider. We are looking forward to the day of our trip to Barcelona.\n\nliving in Barca - zee\n\ni am planning to live in this city ;)))\n\n@jen harper - Barcelona.com\n\nHola jen harper,\n\nBarcelona is a city where people love to walk. The historical centre is not too extensive, you can visit it at any age without any problem. Of course, renting a segway or a bike makes it easier to get around.\n\nYou can find some on this page of our website:\n\nhttps://www.barcelona.com/barcelona_city_tours/bike-tours-rentals/\n\nHave a good journey!\n\nElder tourists - jen harper\n\nHow hard is the walking for elderly? Are there Segways or such to aid people?\n\nthnks - all\n\nfrom indonesia. just need visas europe . last week just trip asian. januari hope getting visas. i love BARCA\n\nVERY HONEST TAXI DRIVER - Donna Lee\n\nWe had a great 2 week vacation in Spain but on our last night in Barcelona, we panicked when we realized that we left our luggage in the trunk of the taxi. Somehow I knew that the cab driver was a good man but we still prayed fervently that he will bring us back our luggage.\n\nABDEL came back in 40 minutes!!! He sure reinstored our faith in the goodness of mankind. We commend ABDEL for his honesty. His cell is 691 073 391. May Abdel be blessed for his honesty.\n\nI love tapas! - frank\n\ncan't wait to taste tapas and local natural wine... yeahhh coming soon!\n\nfood out let - jade\n\npls some can tell about the food outlet that available in this area when going baceolan i min tourism attraction too\n\nbarcelona - kamila\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fj3MdixcAjQ\n\nBarcelona- top attractions\n\naccess for disabled - abegail\n\nI have hopes of holidaying in Barcelona this summer, but have concerns about how disabled friendly the city is? any guidance will be welcome\n\nStatue of Pablo Casals - Carol Wilson\n\nOn my recent visit to Barcelona, I was disappointed to see that the statue of Pablo Casals near Placa de Francesc Macia has been vandalised. The cello bow has been broken off. Hope it gets fixed soon.\n\nbarcelona is safe - sheraz\n\nHi, to everyone coming to barcelona must keep in mind that barcelona is very safe city. means there is no chance of armed robbery or snatching. but to be honest pick pockiting is a common issue for those who come out of the bars really drunk and lost and it is always up to you to take care of your belongings especially in central area and las ramblas. in subways again u have such issues because pickpockets move on groups, they don't attack on you but always look for a chance to steel. A little care and nothing happens. I m living in barcelona since 2004 and I never get robbed.\n\nconfused - james franco\n\nHi, I just came back from a 6 days holiday in Barcelona 2 weeks ago. I am a 29 years old solo female traveller from Singapore. I agree that pickpocket is an issue in Barcelona. however, I would also like to add on that this is also an issue in many other countries, not just Barcelona alone.\n\nI was pretty scared at first but I did not let it stop me from going there. Barcelona is a very beautiful city with interesting cultures and delicious food. It is very convenient to explore as you can literally walk anywhere without getting lost.\n\nJust bring common sense along and carry your bag in front of you at all times. Do not bring too much cash and keep the cash separately.\n\nI did not face any problems or seen any crimes there. I can say Barcelona is a pretty safe city, and I am going back again in February 2015.\n\nbeautiful city - ronald\n\ni have been to Barcelona a few times ,,, it changes with the years, but retains its beauty. never had a problem with any of the citizens and i did most of my touring on foot. my hats off to the city of Barcelona\n\nPickpockets - BarceLover\n\nHi, I just came back from a 6 days holiday in Barcelona 2 weeks ago.

I can say Barcelona is a pretty safe city, and I am going back again in February 2015.\n\nPickpockets - Nancy D.\n\nHi,\n\nPickpockets are an issue in Barcelona, but the police, as Tony suggested, are part of the problem. It is actually the Spanish Laws that need to be changed. Unless a thief is caught with more than €480 in cash on them, it is not consider a felony or major crime. So, within a matter of hours the thief is back on the streets.\n\nThere are lots of uncover policeman now working all parts of the city, security cameras in Metro stations and on platforms and in particular a strong police presence at the most visited sites.\n\nIt is Barcelona's interest to clean up this issue and there is no one who would like that more than the locals. After all, tourism is one of the biggest economic motors of this beautiful seaside city.\n\nBarcelona Travel Video - Jay Ellard\n\nI have just been to the beautiful city and have created a modern cinematic video of the wonderful place. The video shows the most popular places in Barcelona and some of the quiet spots. Here is the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktArVmzb38U\n\ntransfer - Les\n\nDoes any one know if there is a bus service from the Pier to the Airport? Or, if there is any kind of service for transfer with a couple of suitcases?\n\nPickpockets - tony\n\nBarcelona is one of the world's great cities, it has wonderful sights & a vibrant culture, great food & drink. It's a shame it's so corrupt ! 40 years ago, I went to\n\nBarcelona & was warned about pickpockets on Las Ramblas & now after all these years it's worse than ever, not good for the city's reputation. How can this problem still exist ?? the police MUST be part of the problem, & getting a kickback from the thieves, because if they wanted the thefts to stop, they would crack down & stop, but no, the pickpockets flourish year after year, praying on tourists & locals alike, on the streets & even in the Gaudi Cathedral\n\nShame on you.....Clean up the problem !!\n\nStreet Art in Barcelona - Unknown\n\nDetails about street art in Barcelona. A different way of seeing this amazing city:\n\nhttp://vimeo.com/60149775\n\nnew luggage storage near Barcelona´s Port - Amparo\n\nthere is a new luggage storage called Hastavuelo in the World Trade Center, near Barcelona´s Port. Opened everyday from 9 am to 8pm. We offer airport delivery too, so if you want to visit Barcelona without worrying about your suitcases that´s the place!!\n\nstore your luggage - Alicia\n\nHi everyone,\n\nIf you need to store your luggage while you're spending some time in Barcelona, you can leave it in City Lockers, we're in Francesc Pujols, 7 Street, near Portal de l' Àngel. We open from 9 a.m until 9 p.m on Monday to monday. Come to visit us!\n\nabout keeping luggage - LOCKER BARCELONA\n\nHello Maria, there is a left luggage place at plaza catalunya (downtown) close to the main transport stations. Is located at ESTRUC 36 street, is a safety blue and green local named Locker Barcelona, check their web so, you could ask for information. :)\n\nInformation about keeping luggage - Maria\n\nDear all,\n\nI am a tourist from Macedonia, coming to Spain this July. I will be touring Spain by bus. So, I'd like to ask you if there is a place in Barcelona to store your luggage. Since i'm staying several hours in Barcelona, sightseeing, I 'll need some safe place to store my suitcases. Does the bus station of any other place offer such services? And what are the fees per hour?\n\nThank you in advance\n\nBest tapas in Barcelona! - EleanorP\n\nHello,\n\nWe have just returned home from a evening with 'Papa Serra'. He runs cooking classes and tours of la boqueria and we joined an evening course which lasted for about 4 hours - a great evening activity. We enjoyed the tour and the class, and all the wine tasting! But the highlight was a tapa we learnt to make - chicken poached in a saffron liquid and then mixed with pine nuts and raisins and wrapped in greens. It was absolutely delicious and definitely not something we've seen in any of the tapas bars in barcelona. I would recommend the classes to anyone that loves food and wants a fun night of cooking, eating and drinking. I think they have a website but i'm not sure. Enjoy!"
