        "text": "In a previous article we already gave you all the details about the limitations established in the low emissions zone (ZBE) that definitively entered into force on September 15.\n\nIn that case, it was limited access for the most polluting vehicles, without a label, to this ZBE that includes practically the entire city of Barcelona, except for the Rondas, the Zona Franca and the areas of Tibidabo, Les Planes and Vallvidrera. This limitation is only in force from Monday to Friday from 7 in the morning to 8 at night.\n\nAs we explained in that article, vehicles without an environmental label are the following:\n\nPetrol cars registered before January 2000 (Euro 3 standard)\n\nDiesel passenger cars registered before the Euro 4 standard (years 2005 and 2006)\n\nMotorcycles and mopeds registered before January 2003 (Euro 2 standard)\n\nWe also explain that for goods and people transport vehicles (N1, ; N2, N3, M2 and M3) a moratorium was established that gave a few months to adapt to companies and the self-employed: until July 1, 2021, in the case of small trucks and coaches, or until January 1, 2022, in the case of buses and large coaches.\n\nIn case of driving through the ZBE with a vehicle that is prohibited from access, it carries penalties of up to 1,803 euros, so take this information into account.\n\nConsult the rest of the details, exceptions and authorizations of a day of the limitation, already in force, since September 15, in our article Does the limitation of circulation affect you for the most polluting vehicles in Barcelona and other cities? .\n\nThe Metropolitan Area of Barcelona, the AMB, after the implementation of these limitations for the most polluting vehicles, plans to extend these limitations to vehicles labeled with the yellow B environmental label. In this way, the AMB continues with its crusade to reduce pollution in the city of Barcelona, which seriously affects the health of its citizens.\n\nThe date that has been set for this extension is January 2022, as stated in the Metropolitan Mobility Plan Urban 2019-2024. Although this date seems the most likely for its entry into force, it is not yet firm, since it must be approved by the different municipalities that are part of the so-called Low Emissions Zone (Barcelona, L'Hospitalet, Esplugues, Cornellà and Sant Adrià) .\n\nThe vehicles that will be affected by this limitation, those with type\n\nB environmental adhesive, are the following:\n\nDiesel vehicles registered between 2006 and 2013\n\n< li>Petrol vehicles registered between 2000 and 2006\n\nCurrently, these vehicles account for a third of the vehicles in Barcelona, although it is expected that, in January 2022, when it would come into force, this percentage will have considerably reduced. In the same way that happened with the restriction of vehicles already in force, when it was announced in 2017, vehicles without a label accounted for 20%, and when it came into force in September 2020 they already accounted for only 3% of the total number of registered vehicles. in Barcelona.\n\nMost likely, for LEZ residents, this limitation will not apply until January 2024 and the January 2022 date will only apply to vehicles owned by non-residents within the zone.\n\nIt is also very likely that when these new limitations are approved, new moratoria will be established for the transport of goods and people, in the same way that they were established in the current limitations.\n\nOn the other hand, It is not ruled out that the criteria that determine which environmental label certain vehicles have are modified, and gasoline vehicles may be left out of these limitations, focusing the limitations only on diesel vehicles."
