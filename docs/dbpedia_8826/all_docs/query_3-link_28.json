Barcelona boasts an unrivalled event calendar! Take a look at its cultural agenda and make sure not to miss a thing.\n\nThe biggest sporting events\n\nIf you are a sports lover, you're in luck. Barcelona hosts a long list of sporting events throughout the year. Football, basketball, tennis, water sports... The list goes on.\n\nIn March, it is home to the Zurich Barcelona Marathon, one of Europe's most important marathons. Fancy participating?\n\nIn June, the region is host to the Spanish Formula 1 Grand Prix. In 2024, the Formula 1 Barcelona Fan Festival will be held for the first time, with an exhibition of single-seaters, entertainment screens, concerts and a live demonstration by drivers in the city.\n\nThe festive season also sees a peak in sporting events. The Cursa dels Nassos, the Copa Nadal or the Reyes International Hockey Tournament are just a few of the sporting events held in the city in December and January.\n\nDiscover the city's sports calendar and experience it for yourself with Renfe.\n\nNear Barcelona\n\nHow about heading out of the city for the day? Discover places including Sitges and its amazing beaches or make the most of your time and visit Salou and PortAventura World. A great time is guaranteed. What's more, make the most of the Renfe - PortAventura combined ticket.\n\nIf you are a nature lover, then we suggest you head to Montseny Natural Park, a spectacular Biosphere Reserve spanning more than 50,000 hectares that boasts stunning landscapes. You can get there by Rodalies de Catalunya with the Montseny Natural Park combined ticket. The ticket includes both the train journey and the bus that takes you from the train station to the park itself. Experience it for yourself!\n\nBarcelona is the right choice for you\n\nLooking for a different plan? How about a little wine tourism? Whether you are a wine lover or simply want to discover more about Barcelona's wines, the city gives you the opportunity to taste the best wines of the area. There is an almost infinite variety of wines, with a different wine for everyone: whites, reds, rosés, from the sea, from the mountains or even Cava, the famous sparkling white wine.\n\nYou will be able to participate in wine tasting events, visit wineries, go on different routes and enjoy plans related to wine that will surely leave you with a smooth and nice after taste. Cheers!\n\nYou cannot miss it\n\nFollow in the footsteps of Antoni Gaudí across Barcelona. Beyond its architectural flagship, the Sagrada Familia, most of its creations in the city will transport you to imaginary worlds that deserve their recognition as a World Heritage Site, declared by Unesco and Casa Vicens, one of his first works. Its legacy will not leave you indifferent either, you only have to see the facade and interior of the Palau de la Música Catalana de Domenech and Montaner to be blown away by the vivid tones that its stained glass windows project.\n\nPerhaps, because of that magical footprint that Gaudí left on Barcelona, it is also known as the city of dragons. If you look closely, you will surely find scales and claws in more than one corner of its streets.\n\nAlthough Gaudí was not the only one to leave a modernist footprint on Barcelona. The Recinto Modernista de Sant Pau by architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner, is another of the city's prized jewels.\n\nBarcelona's cosmopolitan history pays testament to its Roman past, as well as a Cathedral that has inspired novels and medieval castles with captivating views. Its streets are bursting with life, from Calle Verdi, where visitors can sample homemade vermouth or buy something vintage, to Paseo de Gracia, the Gothic Quarter or Las Ramblas. Don't forget to walk into the La Boqueria market to enjoy the many smells and flavours of the sea and land. Its cultural agenda, including museums, exhibitions, shows and theatres, is almost endless. Spaces such as the Liceu, the Palau de la Música Catalana or L'Auditori await.\n\nEvery last corner of Barcelona deserves to be discovered, as the city's ten districts all have something to offer: gastronomic routes, shopping areas, monuments, the list goes on. Discover Barcelona district by district!"
