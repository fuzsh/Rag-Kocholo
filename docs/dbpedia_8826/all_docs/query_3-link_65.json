        "text": "How can you tell if a street vendor in Barcelona is illegal or not?\n\nIllegal sellers are going to be present in any high-traffic tourist area. One Barcelona attraction that is particularly crowded with illegal sellers with a huge variety of random tchotchkes is Park Guell.\n\nOne way to tell if a seller is illegal is if all of their goods are spread out on a blanket. In Barcelona, illegal street sellers are known as manteros, which translates to blanketman.\n\nThis illegal street selling is also often referred to as top manta, because the goods are presented on top of a blanket.\n\nThe blanket usually has strings at each corner so that the manteros can grab all four corner strings quickly and run from the police carrying this huge blanket bag of counterfeit goods.\n\nWhy are unlicensed street vendors in Barcelona a problem?\n\nLooking out for yourself in this situation, know that you’re getting shitty, counterfeit goods.\n\nThe sellers are typically illegal immigrants, meaning they don’t pay taxes. This causes unfair competition with local shops that are run by legal residents in the community who are selling legal goods and bearing tax burdens.\n\nIllegal street sellers are often selling goods that were made while engaging in other criminal activity, like illegal factories that are not licensed by the real brand owners. This is just my opinion, but I can’t imagine that the working conditions in those factories are up to any kind of humanitarian or ethical standards.\n\nThe manteros take up a large part of pedestrian walkways, so there are frequent problems with tourists disturbing their blankets. This can easily spark a conflict and has led to violence in the past.\n\nWhat do you think? Is this an opportunity for the local government to find ways to help illegal street vendors by creating some kind of permitting and taxation system? Are manteros dangerous? Or do you agree with those who are compassionately questioning if it’s a crime for someone to try to make a living- criminally?\n\nDisclaimer: Tourism ethics are layered and complex. Buying anything anywhere can have inadvertent social, economic, environmental, and humanitarian consequences. For example, consumerism in general destroys the environment. However, consumerism also creates demand that supplies jobs. There are always trade offs to consider in an intelligent ethical discussion about tourism and consumerism. This article is specific to the unauthorized sellers in Barcelona.\n\nSarah is the passionate solo female travel blogger behind Wait, Where is She?
