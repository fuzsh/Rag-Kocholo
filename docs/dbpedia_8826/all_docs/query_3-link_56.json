        "text": "EAT\n\n1. The Venue Steakhouse\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Allergens were clearly marked on the menu. Jon, who helped us, was very knowledgeable about the ingredients in each and every dish. This was an amazing dinner!”\n\n@mayakonoff who manages peanut, tree nut, egg, and sesame allergies\n\n2. Billy Brunch\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Very well-labeled menu for allergens with every item saying if it contained nuts, dairy, eggs, etc. I told the waitress I had a peanut allergy and she said she would tell the kitchen and write it down. She then came back out to our table later and said that she double-checked with the chef and I would be all safe! Really appreciated that and had a great brunch!”\n\n@elliegust who manages a peanut allergy\n\n3. Belushi’s Barcelona\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Spoke very good Spanish and English. I alerted them that I had an allergy and they were very understanding. I ordered the Mexican salad and asked for no ranch dressing, substitute guacamole! Yum!”\n\n@alexajordan who manages tree nut, milk, and fruit allergies\n\n4. Blu Bar\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“This is a wonderful neighborhood bar and casual restaurant with vegan and vegetarian dishes that are delicious!”\n\n@dsp500 who manages egg and chicken allergies\n\n5. Bodegueta\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“My son felt very comfortable with Robert, who waited on us. They reviewed what he could have and placed the order. The food was great for all.”\n\n@bman who manages peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies\n\n6. Brunch & Cake\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Their menu isn’t adjustable, which meant that there were few options for me, but they have a grid with every allergen in their food on the menu. I have an egg and wheat allergy, which makes breakfast nearly impossible, but they had a fruit bowl and make your own salad options. They also had some good vegan options.”\n\n@smmoline who manages tree nut, egg, shellfish, wheat, sesame, vegetable, and fruit allergies\n\n7. Gonzalez & Co Gràcia\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Staff only spoke Spanish. Will provide an allergy menu upon request.”\n\n@nixole who manages peanut, tree nut, egg, shellfish, and sesame allergies\n\n8. Ciudad Condal\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“I went here twice on my trip in Barcelona, as it had amazing tapas and they were also very good with my nut allergy. The waitstaff was able to tell me after I gave them a card with the nuts I was allergic to which tapas that I was interested in contained nuts. They even customized one to come without sauce so I could still enjoy it!”\n\n@ginag who manages tree nut allergies\n\n9. Terrazza Ravello\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“They pointed us in the right direction of what was safe to eat and what wasn’t… super appreciative of being able to use our chef’s card to show the chef!”\n\n@eem who manages peanut, tree nut, fish, sesame, and legume allergies\n\n10. El Árbol – Aribau\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“My favorite place in Barcelona to get a safe brunch! The food is always delicious and quick. The staff knows what they are doing. I’ve even taken out from here a few times!”\n\n@jessiegraber who manages celiac\n\n11. El Xampanyet\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Small, overwhelming place so was nervous at first. However, the owner (Lori), introduces herself personally to every table. She knew exactly what was in every tapa (even unexpected hazelnuts in pasta) and when the waiters brought out the different tapas, they were able to show me which I could eat and could not eat.”\n\n@izzytri12 who manages tree nut, salmon, and sesame allergies\n\n12. ELJ APO NÉS\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“They are always really nice and they try to adapt all of their meals according to the allergies one may have.”\n\n@ortegaapaulaa who manages peanut, tree nut, milk, egg, shellfish, and fruit allergies\n\n13. Federal Café\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Many options for breakfast (including wheat and egg-free options) and they list their allergens on the menu.”\n\n@smmoline who manages tree nut, egg, shellfish, wheat, sesame, vegetable, and fruit allergies\n\n14. Granja Petitbo\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Good food and causal environment. Menu is marked with allergens. However, not a big menu—so not lots of options.”\n\n@scm who manages peanut, tree nut, and seed allergies\n\n15. Obama\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Great tapas and a menu which uses the standard Spanish allergen labeling protocols. Hardly any nuts on the menu limit cross-contamination potential. Thanks, Obama!”\n\n@wgrusk who manages peanut and tree nut allergies\n\n16. PÖTSTOT\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“A totally gluten-free and vegan restaurant. Everything was INCREDIBLE and the service was amazing. Highly highly recommend.”\n\n@celiactivist who manages celiac and an oat allergy\n\n17. Pulpería A Gudiña\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“This is an octopus place! Yum yum yum! Just octopus and potatoes (and wine), a bit of a walk from the main hotel area but definitely worth it! It’s a small place with an open kitchen so you can watch the octopus being prepared! They were very accommodating and this was possibly my favorite meal while in Spain.”\n\n@allergytravelr who manages celiac and peanut, tree nut, milk, soy, shellfish, wheat, fruit, and grain allergies\n\n18. SANTAGLORIA\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Food is great and they are very allergy-friendly. The workers, however, only speak Catalan and Spanish!”\n\n@therealolivier who manages peanut, tree nut, milk, and egg allergies\n\n19. Taller de Tapas\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“By far the best menu system for identifying which dishes contain allergens that I have ever seen. You can select what you’re allergic to and either sort by what you CAN eat, or simply leave it as is and see which dishes contain allergens (and even whether you can order it without them). I wish every restaurant on Earth used this system.”\n\n@dpappalardo357 who manages peanut and tree nut allergies\n\n20. Tapas 24\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Talk to staff about allergies and they will point you to the best menu options!”\n\n@scm who manages peanut, tree nut, and seed allergies\n\n21. Boca Grande\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Amazing menu with primarily nut-free menu, lots of meats and cheeses, but not used to serving people with allergies. Ask to talk to chef to confirm.”\n\n@laurasum who manages peanut and tree nut allergies\n\n22. Via Napoli Restaurant Pizzeria\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Great pizza and allergy-friendly! Well-labeled menu for allergens. Told waiter that I had a peanut allergy and he said I would be fine.”\n\n@elliegust who manages a peanut allergy\n\n23. 216 Grammi Vila Olimpica\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Gave my chef card to my waiter when I ordered. The manager came back out with my card a few minutes later to tell me that my original order would not be safe. He then went through the menu with me to find something that would be safe and I ended up with a delicious meal!”\n\n@mayakonoff who manages peanut, tree nut, egg, and sesame allergies\n\n24. MOLO 39 Palau De Mar\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Waitstaff was helpful in using the chef’s card to let us know what was safe!”\n\n@eem who manages peanut, tree nut, fish, sesame, and legume allergies\n\n25. Restaurant Italià Rossini\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“They double checked ingredients in the food with us and it was an easy experience. Super touristy, but food was good and appreciated their attention to allergies.”\n\n@eem who manages peanut, tree nut, fish, sesame, and legume allergies\n\n26. Cecconi’s Barcelona\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Completely nut-free kitchen! Brought my allergy cards and was understood immediately!”\n\n@gabbylevinson who manages peanut, tree nut, and peach allergies\n\n27. Casa Angela\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Told the waiter I had a peanut allergy and he said I would be fine with all of the tapas that we ordered. Great food and very helpful waiters!”\n\n@elliegust who manages a peanut allergy\n\n28. Chocofiro\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“I ordered a wonderful marisco paella. Absolutely delicious and the menu had everything clearly labeled.”\n\n@therealolivier who manages peanut, tree nut, milk, and egg allergies\n\n29. La Taqueria\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Tacos were okay, one sauce had peanuts in it but they removed it from the table immediately. Guac and chips were 10/10!”\n\n@emmafarinaccia who manages peanut and tree nut allergies\n\n30. Enigma 23 Brunch\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Not the best food, but was safe! Told the waitress I had a peanut allergy and she wrote it down for the kitchen. Good service and good with allergies!”\n\n@elliegust who manages a peanut allergy\n\nTREAT\n\n1. Chök The Chocolate Kitchen\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“This location of Chok is 100% gluten-free. They have tons of gluten-free pastries and they are delicious! Very rich and decadent but so yummy.”\n\n@celiactivist who manages celiac and an oat allergy\n\n2. Dino Gelateria\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Every gelato flavor is labeled with all the allergens it does not contain (6 dairy-free flavors).”\n\n@morganromo who manages tree nut, milk, and seed allergies\n\n3. Jansana Gluten Free Bakery\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“Unbelievable gluten-free bakery! They were so helpful with my huge list of allergies and found options. I was so happy that I could have a REAL donut and a delicious pastry with rice milk cream inside. Absolutely amazing experience. I bought 3 donuts to-go!”\n\n@plantivore who manages celiac and peanut, hazelnut, milk, soy, wheat, flax, and corn allergies\n\nSTAY\n\n1. Mercer Hotel Barcelona\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“The hotel staff does an excellent job with food allergies. Our son has a life-threatening peanut and tree nut allergy and had wonderful meals prepared by the chef. The gourmet breakfast was delicious and they even offered a nut-free pastry and bread basket for us. We ate at the best tapas bars and local restaurants. The concierge made all of our dining reservations for us and informed the chefs in advance about our son’s allergy. We carried a restaurant card to confirm that they understood the allergy. Highly recommend!”\n\n@eliseo who manages peanut, tree nut, and shellfish allergies\n\n2. Hotel Arts Barcelona\n\nLocation: Barcelona\n\n“We had a lovely stay here. The hotel is near the marina area, which isn’t our favorite area in the city, but has a nice pool area (and a bonus for any Marriott Bonvoy members). The hotel took the allergies very seriously. We only had breakfast at the hotel. Just a note that they told us no bread products or pancakes were safe. They originally told us the cereal was also not safe and we requested to see the box and sure enough it was fine… so they definitely kept us safe but we also had to push a little to ask for things that we thought would be safe but they thought weren’t without checking.”"
