With a promising new perspective of life itself, and a new appreciation of the world I can say it was the best experience so far. I spent my spring semester in Barcelona, living in a student residence. I recommend student residence living because you will be able to meet locals, practice the language, and feel less alone because of the easily accessible common spaces that is always filled with residents. Study abroad will also introduce you to a new education format than your home university.\n\nThe trips and gatherings offered through ISA was beyond helpful, and it was where I made some life long friends with great memories.\n\nWhat is your advice to future travelers on this program?\n\nTake a deep breath, look around, be open, travel and embrace public transport! Of course, life is still going to come into play, and not all times are going to be easy, and not all days are going to be 100%, and you will want to go home. Take it day by day, and plan things to look forward to! Culture shock is real, and bound to happen when you are taken out of your comfort zone. However, be persistent and remember why you wanted to take on this journey in the first place. Most likely, you will be able to feel a beautiful and fulfilling transition in yourself because of your freshly gained perspective of the world. Also- try all the foods, drinks, be friendly, and bring a digital camera! You will want to make a scrap book of your moments abroad.\n\nPros\n\nFood\n\nNew people with different cultures\n\nEveryday feels brand new!\n\nCons\n\nCash exchanges\n\nLonger Classes\n\nLanguage barrier\n\n2 people found this review helpful.\n\nRyan\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nISA Barcelona\n\nI went abroad on a four week intensive program in Barcelona with ISA, and it was wonderful. Regarding ISA, they are organized and very personable. Using their site and portal was also so simple. The process seemed to be as easy as possible. On the trip they had three ALL inclusive trips provided and they were all so much fun. I met so many new friends and professors through this program. The courses were also challenging but fun; you could tell the teachers were into their content. The experiences I had were endless, and I would 100% recommend this trip to any college student looking to improve their Spanish drastically.\n\nWhat was the most unfamiliar thing you ate?\n\nRabbit!

Upon arrival, ISA made sure we were set up with everything we could possibly need. They made sure we knew what to do in any situation we might find ourselves in and gave us resources I would not have otherwise known about. The ISA team was extremely helpful in communicating with the university I was enrolled in and making sure I had access to classes that UCLA would award me credit for. They were quick to respond to my emails and always available to answer any questions I had throughout my time. I would definitely recommend ISA to any student looking to go abroad and I would not change a thing about my experience!\n\n27 people found this review helpful.\n\nAdriel\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nStudying Abroad in Barcelona\n\nStudying abroad has been a transformative experience that opened my eyes to new cultures and perspectives on a new continent. One significant advantage of studying abroad in Spain was the opportunity to practice my secondary language, Spanish. Proficiency in another language is highly advantageous in cybersecurity - my current major. During my internship, which occurred immediately after I returned from Spain, I learned that working in cybersecurity occasionally requires you to work in an international setting where multilingual communication is often necessary. Although most Spaniards speak Catalan, I was still able to communicate with them in Spanish. I challenged myself to do so every day, even though many Catalonians understood English enough to speak with tourists. This practice greatly increased my proficiency in Spanish and will enable me to communicate effectively with diverse teams and stakeholders across different regions in my future career. Beyond academics, my time in Spain helped me grow personally and foster independence and self-reliance. These qualities, although not solely beneficial in cybersecurity, are universally valuable in any professional setting. I stepped out of my comfort zone and did my best to adapt to local norms. Among many things, this involved learning the local public transportation system (which to say I used frequently would be an understatement) and ensuring the safety of myself and my peers. I learned how locals dressed, acted, and protected themselves in the busy city. Additionally, I was offered numerous opportunities to learn about the culture and had the privilege of making lifelong friends with people from various corners of the United States and Europe. While exploring Europe, I visited three different countries including Spain, France, and Andorra. I ventured to monasteries nestled in the mountains, marveled at awe-inspiring churches and Basilicas (including, but not limited to the Sagrada Familia), viewed historical landmarks in and outside of Barcelona, indulged in regional cuisine, explored remote beaches, journeyed through caves and coastal cities, and, of course, experienced the vibrant and exciting nightlife the city is famous for! I am profoundly grateful for the support that made this journey possible and will carry the lessons and experiences I had with me forever.\n\nWhat was the most surprising thing you saw or did?\n\nThe most surprising thing I saw in Barcelona was during a memorable evening at a restaurant while celebrating a friend's birthday. To my astonishment, Lionel Messi and his family walked in. The restaurant section we were in was relatively small, placing us only a few meters away from him and his family. Surprisingly, I hadn't recognized Messi until that moment, but the excitement among my friends was clear. The experience turned out to be extraordinary. I enjoyed a delicious Spanish meal near one of the greatest footballers of all time, adding an unexpected and unforgettable twist to our celebratory evening.\n\nPros\n\nPublic transportation made it easy to travel all around the city\n\nWe were in close proximity to a supermarket and were able to cook our own food. Groceries were very cheap too!\n\nMy school was gorgeous and our classroom had a very open-air feel to it.\n\nCons\n\nThe lack of air conditions made sleeping stuffy during the warmer nights of the summer.\n\n32 people found this review helpful.\n\nIsabella\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nGetting out of my Comfort Zone\n\nBefore I left for Spain I was a ball of nervous but excited energy. I found out I was the only student from my university participating in the program, and I had been placed in an apartment with 5 other girls! As a more introverted person, this made me extremely nervous. In reality, these girls and this experience would change my life. Barcelona is an amazing city. It has great food, and easy public transit as well as a great mix of history and fun. I learned so much about Catalonia and its rich history, and participated in a lot of independent travel. Barcelona gave me the best months of my life. I enjoyed exploring every inch of the city and cant wait to go back someday.\n\nWhat was the most unfamiliar thing you ate?\n\nI tried arros negre or \"black rice\", a staple of Catalonia! It was similar to paella but the rice is turned black with fish ink! It is topped with seafood and is the perfect savory dish! I definitely recommend taking advantage of the seafood offerings in Barcelona!\n\nPros\n\nExtremely walkable\n\nTravel hub\n\nGreat food\n\nCons\n\nExpensive\n\nNo Air Conditioner\n\nNo dryers\n\n37 people found this review helpful.\n\nMaryann\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nBest time of life!!\n\nI decided to go abroad for a whole semester and didn’t really know a ton of people from my school going. Definitely was nervous and excited at first but ended up meeting so many friends and we still get together and go on trips! Barcelona is definitely the place to be, its beauty, nightlife, and culture is something everyone should experience. We also got to travel just about every weekend but loved our time in Barcelona so much! I wouldn’t be the person I am today with out experiencing a whole semester of learning, laughing and truly living. Best time of my life.\n\nIf you did this all over again, what's one thing you would change?\n\nMight be silly but I wouldn’t pack as much!! The shopping is amazing and in most areas cheaper. So instead of worrying and overpacking things I don’t need, I’d bring a half empty suitcase and just wait to see what I really end up needing.\n\nAnd explore more of Barcelona and go up the coast of Spain!!\n\nPros\n\nMeeting new friends\n\nAmazing night life\n\nAbility to travel for long weekend trips!\n\nCons\n\nWish I knew more about the city in the early weeks but thats what exploring is for\n\nLosing a phone and the difficulty of getting a new one\n\nThat it went by so fast :(\n\n42 people found this review helpful.\n\nEthan\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nMy time in Barcelona\n\nIt was simply the best time of my life. Finally got the opportunity to visit so many places in Europe. I got to learn & expand my knowledge of spanish as well. Being able to travel relatively cheaply is awesome as well. The BCN airport is super easy to get to & always has flights to anywhere. The schooling was great as well. Most of the professors speak great english & are super useful for anything! The Barcelona metro system is great as well. It really can get you anywhere. The tourist attractions in Barcelona are second to none.\n\nIf you did this all over again, what's one thing you would change?\n\nMake use of every minute of free time. Explore more.\n\nPros\n\nSafety\n\nSpanish\n\nTransit\n\nCons\n\nDirty\n\nCrowded\n\nExpensive\n\n39 people found this review helpful.\n\nDylan\n\n5/5\n\n Yes, I recommend this program\n\nThe Best Decision of My College Career\n\nInternational Studies Abroad went over the top with my program. They felt like my far away-from-home family. The staff and the students were very supportive and friendly. Everyone was happy to be there and wanted to share whatever knowledge they had. Everything was planned out great and they were on top of everything. There isn't much at all I would recommend changing out the program. They were there for me and made sure I was having the best time I could be having. They were able to show us around the city and help get us settled in for our new life for the next 4 months.\n\nWhat was the most unfamiliar thing you ate?\n\nI was on a weekend trip to a small town in Germany called Hannover. I went to this restaurant where they had Kebaps. Which is a popular dish in Europe. Except everything on the menu was in German. I didn't know what anything was. So I decided to order the thing that had the longest name. And I'm not sure what it was, but it was the best food I have ever eaten in my life. It was like some kind of chili in a bowl with bread as the base. I don't even know how to describe it haha.\n\nPros\n\nMade sure I was always doing alright\n\nGave plenty of notice before any event we did\n\nWent out of their way to immerse us into the culture as much as possible\n\nCons\n\nI wish they told me my host mom only spoke spanish\n\nI wish I was kinda taught how to navigate the city\n\n42 people found this review helpful.\n\nQuestions & Answers\n\nAlumni Interviews\n\nThese are in-depth Q&A sessions with verified alumni.\n\nKelsey Fortier\n\nAs a senior from the University of Michigan, Kelsey will be graduating with an Environmental Science degree. She is from Grand Haven, Michigan, a small town on Lake Michigan. Her favorite dance move is a combination of the shopping cart and the sprinkler.\n\nWhy did you pick this program?\n\nKelsey: I picked ISA Barcelona for a multitude of reasons. I wanted to live in a vibrant city, but also have access to mountains and water, and Barcelona had that perfect combination. ISA was one of the companies that stood out to me when I was doing research of programs because of everything they included and because of how genuinely nice and helpful they were.\n\nWhat do you wish someone had told you before you went abroad?\n\nKelsey: I wish someone had told me to travel less while I was in Barcelona because there's time to travel before or after. While, I was there, I wish I would have spent more weekends taking in all of Barcelona instead of leaving every weekend. I think I would have discovered much more about the city.\n\nWhat is the most important thing you learned abroad?\n\nKelsey: The most important thing I learned abroad was to be open. When you're in a new place with new people there are so many moments where you might feel uncomfortable, but I learned those situations were actually the most rewarding. If you're open to these experiences, you learn so much about yourself, the city/town you're in, and the people you're with. I think it's one of those life lessons you can only learn while you're abroad.\n\nWhat do you tell your friends who are thinking about going abroad?\n\nKelsey: You NEED to go!!! There is no better time to go another place and study. I know money can be a really big concern when thinking about studying abroad, but you're young and it's just you (you don't have a spouse or kids). There won't be as many opportunities in your life to do something like this.\n\nI also tell them that I learned more studying abroad, in school and in life, than I have here at my university. I learned lessons that I will remember for the rest of my life, in comparison to memorizing facts for test and forgetting them the next day.\n\nWhat's your favorite story to tell about your time abroad?\n\nKelsey: Someone ask me for directions once, but they only spoke Italian, Norwegian, and very little English. So I tried, knowing English, a little Spanish, and tiny tiny amount of Norwegian, to give them directions. The conversation was a bit chaotic and quite funny. It made me appreciate the beauty of being able to communicate despite speaking different languages.\n\nStaff Interviews\n\nThese are in-depth Q&A sessions with program leaders.\n\nAbby Zelenka\n\nJob Title\n\nStudent Services Advisor\n\nOriginally from Boston, Abby graduated from the University of New Hampshire with a Bachelors of Arts in Spanish. Her junior year she studied abroad with ISA in Valparaiso, Chile and returned to campus her senior year as a Global Ambassador encouraging her classmates to explore the world. She hopes to use her experience and stories to help encourage and advise potential students.\n\nWhat is your favorite travel memory?\n\nMy favorite travel memory, hmmm. There are so many! The one that stands out specifically was the morning of my friend and my first weekend trip. With our bus leaving the station at 5am, we knew we had to get to the bus station and just assumed that we would be able to pick up a taxi on the road. Well, there were no taxis/colectivos to be seen. We lived close to a gas station and headed there to see if anyone could bring us. In a panic with the time pushing closer to 5, we were running out of options. One man pulled up in a van and when I asked him, panicked if he would bring us. He happened to be a security guard at the bus station and so we hopped into the back of his van. We realized at that time that he was our only option no matter how sketchy it was. Everything worked out for the best, but we made sure to always have a way to the bus station from then on!\n\nWhich destination is most underrated? Conversely, which is most overrated?\n\nI may be biased, but I would say that Valparaiso and Vina del Mar is the most underrated program here at ISA. The on site staff is amazing and there is so much to explore throughout the city! It's the perfect jumping off point to explore the rest of Chile, Patagonia, Argentina, and Peru. The most overrated program I would have to say Barcelona. Students get it stuck in their mind that they're just going to go abroad and party the whole time. Yes, that can be the case for some, but Barcelona is so much more than just partying. I can't say that the city itself is overrated, but the idea of this crazy party city is overrated.\n\nView Entire Interview\n\nWhat do you believe to be the biggest factor in being a successful company?\n\nPassion is the one thing that can truly change the game for a company. Anyone can have a product and try to sell it, but when the people involved are inherently passionate about what they are providing and are meaning to do good and change the world, that is when an inspiring/successful company is born.\n\nHow have you changed/grown since working for your current company?\n\nI have definitely grown since working for ISA. I started here in Austin in December 2014 and it has been a huge life changing experience for me! I pushed myself out of my comfort zone, (quite like you do when you travel) and I have made a life for myself here. Before moving to Austin I worked as a Montessori teacher and needless to say, it was a HUGE change for me to move to an office setting. Professionally, I have carried along my flexibility from to classroom to the office.\n\nWhat unique qualities does your company possess?\n\nI believe that everyone who works at ISA is passionate about study abroad, and we all want to share our stories and make it possible for others to explore and experience the same thing! The on site staff that we have across the world loves what they do and they share that pride with the students who come in every program.\n\nDescribe a time when you felt especially proud to be part of your current team.\n\nThis last summer we had the AC go out on us during a Friday. We had been chugging away at our calls list and were so close to finishing up. Through the sweltering heat, we finished all call list and it felt so good to just finish it working through when others had left. It might have helped that we had an industrial fan blowing on us...\n\nAbout ISA (International Studies Abroad)\n\nAs a leader in international education for over thirty years, ISA is dedicated to providing university and college level students the opportunity to discover, learn, and enjoy a way of life other than their own.
