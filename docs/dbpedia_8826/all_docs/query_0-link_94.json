The Catalan club and the American mark have a valid agreement until 2028, signed in 2016 by the that then president of the Barça, Josep Maria Bartomeu, but from the Barcelona entity are not of the all satisfied.\n\nIn the dispatches culés explore all the formulas that can be possible to treat to increase his ordinary income and one of these roads that sige on the table is the one of the sponsorship of the T-shirt.

The first already 'fichó' to Neymar, whereas New Balance was until does very little with the Liverpool and now announced an agreement with Endrick, the forward fichado by the Real Madrid. Clubs of entity as I Carry or Lille also have joined to the quoted mark, although they also have lost other important names like Rome and Athletic Club.\n\nThe Barça has some questions that resolve with Nike\n\nIt remains clear equally that for the Barça would be very complicated to break a business little more than four years more with Nike, although yes that in the Barcelona club neither walk of the all satisfied with some situations associated to quality in some processes, designs or service to the players. Of equal way the information aims that from the American mark have a feeling seemed in by the occasions in which the team culé delays with some decisions or terms."
