        "text": "Dear friends, family and fellow drifters,\n\nI have some personal news that I wanted to share with you, a sort of quick life update‚Ä¶\n\nIt‚Äôs not ‚Äúbig‚Äù or ‚Äúimportant‚Äù news in the grand scheme of things, but it‚Äôs something I wanted to mention in an effort to stay closer to those of you who have followed my story since I first moved to Barcelona to pursue my dream of becoming a travel writer/photographer/blogger.\n\nWell, the news is that I no longer live in Barcelona, and that I have moved to Gij√≥n in Asturias (northern Spain), where my novia Rosana is from.\n\nWhy?\n\nFor many reasons.\n\nAs is true of everyone who goes to Barcelona, I was shaken by a thunderously passionate romance, with the Mediterranean way of life, with the beaches, mountains, climate, architecture, food and people.\n\nI‚Äôve said it many times before, but there‚Äôs something so rousing about living in a place that‚Äôs so universally adored. Barcelona is one of those places where you rarely wonder whether the grass is greener elsewhere.\n\nIt‚Äôs a haven for dreamers, a place people go to escape the ‚Äúnorms‚Äù of society and design their own perfect life. I was, am, one of those people and I like to think of mine as a success story.\n\nThen and Now\n\nWhen I left the security of my digital marketing agency job in London all those years ago, ravenous for a chance to work for myself and live a life of creativity, tapas and vino, Barcelona seemed like an obvious and even sensible choice.\n\nThe rent was less than half what I had grown accustomed to in London (this is definitely not the case anymore), and with the pound being so strong against the euro (also something of a distant memory), I was confident I could make some sort of living as a freelance writer, which is fundamentally what I am, with only a few UK-based clients.\n\nMy life in Barcelona gave me so much so quickly, from unforgettable friends and memories to a new perspective on life. It has also been something of a muse, spurring me on to carve a career as a travel writer/photographer. I still can‚Äôt believe I did it, that I am doing it.\n\nThe Course of Love\n\nWhat‚Äôs more, Barcelona gave me Rosana, my strong, beautiful, inspiring and ridiculously intelligent Asturian girlfriend.\n\nAs with all love stories, our relationship has changed the course of our lives in the most unexpected of ways. Rosana lived in Barcelona for over 10 years and knew it infinitely better than I ever will. If anything, it was harder for her to leave than for me.\n\nAnd whatever her dreams may have been when she moved to the big city all those years ago, I doubt very much that she ever imagined she‚Äôd be returning home to Asturias a decade later with a scatterbrained, vino-guzzling Welshman in tow. Poor girl.\n\nA Natural Paradise\n\nWe visited Asturias multiple times over the years we lived together in Barcelona and with each visit I grew increasingly fond of the region (and ‚ÄúGreen Spain‚Äù as a whole, which also includes the Basque Country, Cantabria and Galicia).\n\nAsturias is often referred to as a ‚Äònatural paradise‚Äô and offers pretty much everything I could wish for: the dramatic Picos de Europa (a staggeringly beautiful mountain range), a unique cultural identity coloured by its Celtic roots and wildly pristine beaches with world-class surf conditions (this is actually one of the main reasons I‚Äôm so excited about our move here).\n\nAnd of course it‚Äôs one of the best places to eat and drink on Earth. And did I mention how amazing the surf is here?\n\nLike Barcelona, Asturias is another one of those places where the locals can‚Äôt quite believe their luck, a place no one ever wants to leave.\n\nOh, and the cost of living here is almost half what it is in Barcelona, which is something we value greatly as we move into the next stage of our lives.\n\nAs I write this post, my 35th birthday looms large on the horizon. We both have a thousand things we want to do, see and achieve before we start a family, but there‚Äôs no question that it makes more sense for us to be here, in a more affordable city and close to Rosana‚Äôs family, if and when we start making moves.\n\nGoing to Gij√≥n (Pronounced ‚ÄòHe-Hon‚Äô)\n\nWe weren‚Äôt sure whether we wanted to move to Oviedo (the capital of Asturias) or Gij√≥n (the largest city in Asturias), but it hasn‚Äôt taken us long to fall completely in love with Gij√≥n.\n\nIt‚Äôs a ridiculously handsome oceanfront city, a city packed with buzzy cider bars (the local tipple of choice), cafes and fishing-village-vibes, with surfers and cyclists and professional terrace-loiterers.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt matter what time of day or week it is, every bar and restaurant is constantly overflowing with people. I‚Äôm sure the free tapas you get with every drink has something to do with it. And what people the Asturians are, too ‚Äì so genuinely warm and welcoming.\n\nIt‚Äôs not the most beautiful city you‚Äôll ever visit. It doesn‚Äôt quite have the crumbling old world charm of cities like Rome or Barcelona, but it is an incredibly colourful and well maintained city, a city with a deep and alluring sense of character.\n\nThere‚Äôs a certain nostalgia about it, as if it were built from scratch in the late 70s or 80s and never touched again. And it‚Äôs all so beautifully preserved. Living in Gij√≥n is like living back in the good ol‚Äô days.\n\nI feel isolated, protected even, from the political and environmental troubles that face our planet (not that I don‚Äôt still worry about it all obsessively).\n\nMy Very Own ‚ÄòNew World‚Äô\n\nMost impressively of all, Gij√≥n is almost unknown by people outside of Spain. I don‚Äôt know about you, but ‚ÄúGij√≥n‚Äù is not a place I had ever heard of before meeting Rosana.\n\nEver since I was young, I always dreamed of absconding to a remote village somewhere in Europe, somewhere off the map, somewhere that had yet to be discovered. My very own little hideaway.\n\nAsturias may be a long way from being an undiscovered or unknown village, but it is a bonafide hidden gem in comparison to Barcelona.\n\nOur new home doesn‚Äôt boast the icons of Barcelona, there are no Gaud√≠ masterpieces or Picasso museums, but it has pretty much everything else I/we want and need at this point of our lives.\n\nLuckily, with my ‚Äújob‚Äù as a Spain-specialist travel blogger, I‚Äôll still be in Barcelona on a fairly regular basis anyway, and also exploring the rest of this magnanimous country I am fortunate enough to call home.\n\nSo stay tuned for more of my overly-sentimental travel journals‚Ä¶ from Gij√≥n and beyond.\n\nSaludos,\n\nBen\n\nWhat do you think?
