Best things to do in Barcelona city.\n\nTop 20 Things to do in Barcelona Spain - Attractions & Landmarks\n\nWhat to do in Barcelona city? Barcelona in Spain is a city full of museums, parks, Antoni GaudÃ­ landmarks and other highlights. Barcelona city offers more than just the attractions and famous sights such as the Sagrada Familia, Park Guell and Camp Nou. During your Barcelona visit, these are the top 20 of the most famous and most popular Barcelona tourist attractions. Click one of the best must-see highlights for more information on this unique sightseeing, museum, landmark or attraction. What to do in Barcelona?\n\n1. Top attraction: Sagrada Familia\n\nThe absolute number 1 attraction in Barcelona Spain is the Sagrada Familia; the holy cathedral designed by Antoni GaudÃ­. The unfinished church will probably be completed in 2026 and has to be part of your city break. You can even ascend the towers for an amazing view. Important: Be sure that you always buy your tickets for the Sagrada Familia at least several days in advance!\n\nBarcelona Pass: Do you want to visit the Sagrada Familia and Park GÃ¼ell? Save time and money with the 'Barcelona Pass', so you don't have to worry about the main attractions anymore.\n\n2. Visit Park GÃ¼ell\n\nPark Guell is the famous park with mosaic benches and the salamander. This Park Guell is a sightseeing must-see when visiting Barcelona. However, only a limited number of visitors are admitted every hour. Warning: The park used to be free, but now you have to purchase your tickets in advance. Buy this well in advance during the high season, because tickets sell out quickly\n\n3. Camp Nou Stadium of FC Barcelona\n\nVisit the FC Barcelona Camp Nou stadium. Book this Camp Nou Experience tour and see the dressing rooms, trophies and all the parts of the stadium, or attend one of Barca's matches. The Camp Nou stadium is a must see for every football lover. Until 2026, Camp Nou will undergo a massive renovation and will play matches in the Olympic Stadium on MontjuÃ¯c. However, the FC Barcelona museum can still be visited.\n\n4. Casa BatllÃ³, must see of GaudÃ¬\n\nCasa BatllÃ³ is a building with apartments designed by Antoni GaudÃ­, completely in the style of Catalan Modernism. The shapes of the house are based on the legend of George and the dragon. You will be amazed at the many beautiful details, colors and mosaics. In this article an overview of all buildings of Gaudi in Barcelona city, but for me personally Casa BatllÃ³ is the most beautiful house of Antoni GaudÃ­. More info how to visit 'Casa BatllÃ³'.\n\nBarcelona Attraction Tickets\n\n5. Casa MilÃ (La Pedrera)\n\nAnother beautiful building and a striking example of modernist architecture designed by Antoni GaudÃ­ is Casa MilÃ , also known as 'La Pedrera'. Translated, this means the 'quarry', named after the rugged appearance of the complex. La Pedrera is celebrated for its undulating stone facade, wrought iron balconies resembling seaweed, surreal rooftop sculptures and the view at the roof terrace. More info 'Casa MilÃ (La Pedrera)'.\n\n6. Picasso Museum of Barcelona\n\nThe museum of Pablo Picasso is located in the district El Born. The Museu Picasso has over 4,000 works of art (paintings, sculptures, ceramics, and sketches) by the painter Pablo Picasso who spent an important part of his life in this city. Among the museum's highlights are iconic pieces like \"Harlequin\" and \"Woman with Raised Arms,\" as well as lesser-known gems that offer glimpses into Picasso's personal and artistic journey. More info how to visit the 'Picasso Museum'.\n\n7. Sights of the Gothic quarter\n\nThe Barri GÃ²tic is the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona's historical city centre, with the Barcelona cathedral and famous squares such as PlaÃ§a Reial and PlaÃ§a Sant Jaume. Wander the small, picturesque streets in the historical city centre near the Rambas. A fun activity in the Gothic Quarter is this Tapas Walking Tour with local tapas and wines, combined with fascinating stories. Read more about what to do in Barcelona's 'Barri GÃ²tic'?\n\n8.

Read more about all tourist attractions on the MontjuÃ¯c hill.\n\n9. Palau de la MÃºsica Catalana\n\nThe Palau de la MÃºsica in the style of Catalan Modernism is one of the most beautiful concert buildings in the world. Visit a concert or book this tour through this amazing Modernist palace of music. It's a masterpiece of modernist architecture and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The concert hall, is breathtaking with its stained glass windows and colorful columns. Designed by architect LluÃ­s DomÃ¨nech i Montaner, it was built between 1905 and 1908. More info about how to visit 'Palau de la MÃºsica'.\n\n10. Tourist spot: Las Ramblas\n\nLas Ramblas is the busiest street in Barcelona Spain with its flower stalls, plane trees, street musicians and living statues. Las Ramblas is the most touristy place in the city and the spot to get souvenirs. One of the most crowded places to visit in Barcelona and notorious for its pickpockets. If you like more authentic places, this is probably on your list of things not to do in Barcelona.\n\n11. Highlights: Boqueria Market\n\nMercat de la Boqueria, or the Mercat de Sant Josep, is the colourful produce market on the Ramblas. The Boqueria market is the perfect place to start the day by tasting and experiencing Catalan flavours and smells. More info for visiting the Barcelona highlight of 'Mercat de la Boqueria'.\n\nFun activity: Last time I visited the market with this amazing market tour where a chef will take you to the market, you will get a paella workshop and also taste different tapas.\n\n12. Unique landmark: Hospital de Sant Pau\n\nThe 'Hospital de la Santa Creu i de Sant Pau' is the former hospital of Barcelona and was beautifully designed by the architect LluÃ­s DomÃ¨nech i Montane and is one of the prime examples of Catalan modernist architecture. With its main building and many colorful and richly decorated pavilions, the former complex of Hospital de Sant Pau is one of my favorite (less touristy) spots in Barcelona Spain. More info 'Hospital de Sant Pau'.\n\n13. Barcelona sightseeing by bike\n\nOne of the best things to do in Barcelona is to discover the Barcelona tourist attractions is by bike. Barcelona city has an extensive network of cycle paths, certainly also along the beach. Rent a bike yourself or even better, join this bike tour with an inspiring guide and discover the best parts of the city (Tip: do the bike tour on the first day of your city trip so that you get to know the city).

Cable Car to MontjuÃ¯c Castle\n\nAt the top of MontjuÃ¯c mountain is the Castell de MontjuÃ¯c, the 18th century fortress with a brutal history. The best way to reach the top is with the TelefÃ¨ric de MontjuÃ¯c, the funicular to the castle where you will enjoy one of the most beautiful views of Barcelona.\n\nBest deal: Barcelona City Pass\n\nWarning: Unfortunately, a number of attractions in Barcelona are so popular that you must purchase tickets well in advance to ensure you can visit them (in high season sometimes even two weeks in advance!). These are the two highlights: Sagrada Familia and Park GÃ¼ell. You can buy individual Sagrada Familia tickets or Park GÃ¼ell tickets, but with the popular Barcelona Pass you have all the tickets in one purchase.
