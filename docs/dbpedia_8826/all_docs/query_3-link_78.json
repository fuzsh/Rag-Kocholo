        "text": "Yes you can travel from Nice to Barcelona by train.\n\nThe best info site for train travel is \"The Man in Seat 61\". He even has a section specifically about that route.\n\nTo save me typing, just read this: https://www.seat61.com/international-trains/trains-from-Nice.htm#Nice-Barcelona\n\n\"do we need a euro rail pass?\" - No!, that comment shouts \"I am a train newbie\". For trains you buy tickets, from A to B just like other modes of transport. In many cases they are much cheaper bought in advance. Passes are only of use if you are doing a lot of trips, and often even then it is still cheaper to buy tickets for each train in advance.\n\nThe aforementioned \"Man in Seat 61\" site explains all.\n\nEdit: and it is much too early to buy tickets for next June. Normally 2-3 months in advance maximum.\n\nIf you look for 2-3 months from now (Feb-Mar) you will get an idea of times and costs.\n\nThe train from Nice to Barcelona takes 9-1/2 hours. I'd consider that totally out of the question for you, because it represents a huge percentage of the time you have to (potentially) sightsee in France. You need to fly.\n\nIn addition, allow me to say that I would find two days in southern France wildly frustrating and would never recommend that someone go there for such a short time. There are so many attractive places to see, even if you focus (as you must) only on the Riviera and don't try to get to Provence. Two days, with the first day probably sleep-deprived and jetlagged, gives you about one real day. Maybe you'll have time to see two tiny places if you basically ignore Nice itself.\n\nSo if you cannot add a few days to allow for more time in France, I urge you to skip it altogether and see things the tour misses in Spain. The tour gives you just one full day in Barcelona plus a few hours on arrival day. I say Barcelona needs at least four days, or three if you don't mind constantly looking at your watch as you run from sight to sight. The tour doesn't go to Girona, which has a lovely, walled medieval historic district, two interesting churches, a good art museum, etc. It's worth more than a full day. Art fans might want to push on to Figueres to see the Dali Theatre-Museum, but with limited time I'd stick to Girona.\n\nOK, back to the idea of a quick look at southern France...\n\nThere are many, many lovely spots along the Riviera. I imagine we each have our favorites. I'd suggest starting with a look at Rick's guide book focusing on southern France, which I understand has a lot more detail than the big \"France\" guide book.\n\nTell us your priorities and suggestions will probably flow.\n\nAre you interested in art? If yes, Nice, St-Paul-de-Vence, Antibes and Biot are among the places with worthwhile museums; Nice has at least 6.\n\nMarkets? Some cities and towns have a great weekly (or more frequent) market. What days of the week will you be in the area?\n\nPicturesque coastal towns? The TER (local train) runs frequently and stops just about everywhere except St-Tropez.\n\nHill towns? It takes longer to get to these, which will be a consideration for you, but you could squeeze in one.\n\nHow do you feel about cities vs. towns? Is tiny better rather than larger?\n\nHow do you feel about crowds? Some of the most picturesque spots get slammed with day-trippers so that you're likely to feel like part of a mob during your visit. The hill town of St-Paul-de-Vence felt like that for me, as did the historic core of Menton.\n\nI haven't been to Monaco, but I have noticed--after reading a huge number of posts on this forum--that it is no one's favorite place, and most folks don't much recommend it. I spent two weeks in Nice and didn't bother going to Monaco, so I don't have a personal opinion about it.\n\nIf you're driving up from Barcelona, you won't want to go too far or else you'll spend all your time inside the car. The small coastal town of Collioure (pop. 2800), while touristy, is very picturesque. It's the first place you come to that folks seem to recommend, and I liked it myself. ViaMichelin estimates the driving time at about 2-1/4 hours each way. Remember the time you'll waste dealing with a rental-car agency, though. There are public-transit options that wouldn't take an awful lot longer; all require at least one transfer and some involve a bus.\n\nInland from Collioure is the small town of Ceret (pop. 7700), a much less touristy destination. Maybe 30 minutes from Collioure.\n\nSkipping past Perpignan (interesting but not especially lovely) the next obvious destination would be Narbonne, which is considerably larger than Collioure at about 53,000 people. ViaMichelin estimates 2 hr. 45 min. straight to Narbonne, or you can get there by fast train in about 2 hours.\n\nIf you hang a left at Narbonne you will end up in Carcassonne, where I've never been. VM estimates about 3 hr. 10 min. from Barcelona. The consensus is that you need to spend the night in Carcassonne to see it when the leagues of day-trippers have gone home.\n\nThe good news is that ViaMichelin indicates three possible routes to Carcassonne, so you could do a loop trip if you have a car, though it would take considerably longer than traveling out and back on the same route. The second path would take you near (through??) the Pyrenees, passing the very pretty hill town of Puigcerda. Note that this valley, the Cerdanya, can be very hot in the summer. The third path would take you through Ripoll (interesting church) and Vic (I think worthwhile, but I haven't been there).\n\nI am not suggesting that you try to see Collioure, Ceret, Narbonne and Puigcerda (or Ripoll/Vic) if you have only about 48 hours available, but you can use ViaMichelin.com to play around with the options for various stops along the way.\n\nParking is likely to be an issue at all the potential destinations, and you could easily have quite a walk from your parking place to the historic area you want to see. Traffic could slow you down as well."
