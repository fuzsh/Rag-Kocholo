The works were completed in 2010.\n\n2005\n\nThe Nativity façade and crypt are named UNESCO world heritage.\n\n2010\n\nOn 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the Basilica for religious worship and designated it a minor basilica.\n\n2011\n\n2010 Barcelona City Award in Architecture and Urban Planning goes to the Temple nave.\n\n2012\n\nJordi Faulí takes over from Jordi Bonet as head architect and site manager for the works on the Temple of the Sagrada Família, which carry on according to Antoni Gaudí’s plans.\n\n2016\n\nConstruction begins on the towers of the Evangelists, the Virgin Mary and Jesus Christ.\n\nWork is completed on the western sacristy and the cloister of Our Lady of Dolours.\n\n2018\n\nJuly 2018 The Cross is placed on top of the pediment of the Passion façade.\n\n2019\n\nThe first stone panels arrive for the tower of Jesus Christ, the tower of the Evangelists and the tower of the Virgin Mary and they start to take shape.\n\n2020\n\nFebruary 2020 The tower of Jesus Christ and the tower of the Virgin Mary surpass the height of the towers on the Passion and Nativity façades.\n\nMarch 2020 The Junta Constructora de la Sagrada Família stops construction due to the Covid-19 healthcare emergency.\n\nOctober 2020 Work resumes, focusing on completing the tower of the Virgin Mary, with all the levels of panels in place and only the elements of the 25-metre pinnacle remaining, which will be crowned with a shining twelve-pointed star.\n\n2021\n\nIn 2021 all efforts focus on finishing the tower of the Virgin Mary, the Basilica’s second tallest at 138 metres.\n\nIn April 2021, construction began on the shaft, the middle part of the pinnacle of the tower of the Virgin Mary, which is 18 metre tall and starts from six legs and ends in three arms that hold up the luminous star. During this month, the formwork and reinforcement for the lower third of the shaft was put in place, a piece measuring 10.8 metres tall that clearly changes the city's skyline, since it raises the tower to a height of 127 metres. It is the longest piece (10.80 metres) that has been raised so far on the Sagrada Família.\n\nIn July 2021, the shaft was covered with trencadís mosaic. The lower part of the shaft is now in place. The upper and lower part of the shaft are covered with artistic ceramic stoneware trencadís mosaic in colours ranging from blue to white with a few scattered pieces of golden Venetian mosaic.\n\nIn September 2021, the upper third of the shaft of the tower of the Virgin Mary was put in place. With the upper third of the tower of the Virgin Mary put in place, the tower reaches 134 metres.\n\nOn November 9, the twelve wrought-iron stars that top the crown on the tower of the Virgin Mary were placed.\n\nOn November 29, the Sagrada Família lifted the star of the Virgin Mary into place. This was a historic moment, as it is the final piece of the tower and changes the Barcelona skyline.\n\nOn 8 December 2021, the Sagrada Família inaugurated the tower of the Virgin Mary with a mass as the central event and, afterwards, the blessing of the tower and the first lighting of the star on the second-tallest tower, which is now complete.\n\n2022\n\nIn 2022, two of the four towers of the Evangelists were completed: Luke and Mark. The tower of Jesus Christ gained two levels, taking it up to the eighth out of twelve in total, standing at 125.85 metres. On 16 December 2022, the pinnacles of the towers of the Evangelists Luke and Mark will be lit for the first time. These are two of the four towers of the Evangelists that are part of the central group of towers.\n\n2023\n\nOn 12 November 2023 the Sagrada Família inaugurated the four the towers of the Evangelists, with the central event of the mass and the subsequent blessing and lighting up for the first time. As part of the central group of towers, the four towers of the Evangelists surround the tower of Jesus Christ and are the Temple’s third tallest, standing 135 metres tall. Together with the tower of the Virgin Mary, five of the six central towers have been completed. The central tower of Jesus Christ is scheduled for completion in 2026."
