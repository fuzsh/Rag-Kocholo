        "text": "Page Content\n\nThis page will give you a day's walking literary to see the best of the heart of Barcelona city centre. I spent a day walking around Barcelona doing all of the things that I feel make up a perfect day in the city centre. I walked from the Old Town's El Born district, along the Ramblas to the Boqueria Food Market, then on to El Raval and up to Passeig de GrÃ cia - covering a large percentage of Barcelona's city centre.\n\nThere are two ways to use this guide to Barcelona City Centre. Either you can follow the links on this page to the exact location you are interested in or you can follow the link to El Born. At the foot of all pages in this area guide you will find a link to the next area.\n\nI have covered some of the essential sights, smells and sounds for a first time tourist to the city, as well as some more local gems that can be found off Barcelona's beaten track.\n\nClick the links below each heading to read about my experience of each area in the city centre.\n\nBarcelona is one of the top city break destinations in Europe. This is probably largely due to its mix of sunshine, sights and culture, with the added bonus of beaches on your doorstep. With a weekend break to the city you only have limited time to enjoy its highlights. Of course, you are likely to already know about sights such as the Ramblas and the Sagrada FamÃ­lia. However, I feel that a truly \"Barcelona\" experience would not be the same without a morning coffee in a sunny plaza or a long lunch in a local restaurant. These moments are just as important as visits to the major sights - especially if you are coming back on your second or third visit.\n\nEl Born - Part of the 'Old Town' in Barcelona City Centre\n\nPasseig del Born\n\nTourists to Barcelona are always keen to visit what is known as the 'Old Town' ('Ciutat Vella'). What you may not know is that this part of town is made up of areas ('barrios') other than the Gothic Quarter. My favourite barrio in the Old Town is El Born. This is the area closest to the port and is slightly less touristy and perhaps more affluent than the Gothic Quarter.\n\nFollow my guided walk around El Born neighbourhood and discover some recommended places that are slightly off the beaten track\n\nPlaÃ§a St Jaume - A Square at the heart of the Gothic Quarter in Barcelona City Centre\n\nIt is a ten-minute stroll from El Born to the Ramblas. If you go up Calle Argenteria you can cross Via Laietana and head up Calle Jaume I and take in PlaÃ§a St Jaume on your way to the Ramblas. This is the home of Barcelona's town hall. I love walking through this grand and busy square. During my tour it looked particularly beautiful in the early afternoon sunshine.\n\nLas Ramblas - Barcelona's Most Famous Street in the City Centre\n\nA classic Ramblas street performer\n\nLas Ramblas is one of Barcelona's most famous tourist attractions. Some people love it, some people don't. But one thing is for sure - no trip to the city centre would be the same without it. This large street runs from the port to PlaÃ§a de Catalunya - right through the heart of the city centre.\n\nA Ramblas flower stall\n\nAs you stroll up the pedestrianized centre of the street take some time to enjoy the many and varied street performers. Human statues are omnipresent, however there are also people displaying capoeira, break dancing or playing music. There are also stalls lining the street. From the port upwards artists and caricaturists lead to flower shops and then on to small pet shops - be warned that animal lovers may not be too impressed with the conditions at these stalls.\n\nBoqueria Food Market - Barcelona's Largest Food Market in Barcelona City Centre\n\nNo trip to Barcelona would be complete without a trip around one of Europe's most famous food markets. This is a place to whet your appetite before lunch, with an awe-inspiring selection of stalls selling all foods, including the weird and wonderful.\n\nFor more information on what is available at the Boqueria Food Market please see my detailed tour of the Boqueria, with some advice on some of the less well-known places to visit\n\nMenu del Dia (Set Menu) - A way to enjoy Lunch in the City Centre\n\nRumour has it that the concept of the Menu del Dia is, in fact, the law in Spain. This comes from the notion that every man (or hungry woman) deserves at least one affordable meal each day. For this reason, at Spanish lunchtimes (normally around 13:00 - 15:00) nearly all restaurants offer a set meal. This typically consists of three courses, bread and a drink - all at a reasonable price.\n\nRaval - Part of the 'Old Town' in the City Centre\n\nMetro: Liceu (Green Line, L3) and Universitat (Red Line, L1)\n\nAfter a three-course lunch you are likely to want to take a walk. Behind the Boqueria you will find the area of El Raval. This area forms one of the parts of the Old Town. It could be said to be the naughty younger brother of the El Born area - it is louder, dirtier and rougher around the edges, but a lot of fun.\n\nFor more information on the area of El Raval please see A Guide to the El Raval Neighbourhood in Barcelona - A Local Expert recommends some places that are off the beaten track.\n\nPlaÃ§a de Catalunya - A Square at the Heart of Barcelona's City Centre\n\nPlaÃ§a de Catalunya\n\nA walk down Calle Tallers will deliver you back to the top of the Ramblas - where the street meets PlaÃ§a de Catalunya. This is one of Barcelona's largest squares and is the gateway to uptown Barcelona. Conveniently, it is the home of Barcelona's main Tourist Information centre - definitely worth a visit with any questions that you might have. I have always found them to be helpful and efficient.\n\nTourist Information\n\nPlaÃ§a de Catalunya, 17\n\n08002 Barcelona, EspaÃ±a.\n\nOpening Time:\n\nMonth Day Time January - December Monday - Sunday 08:30 - 20:30\n\nClosed: 01 January and 25 December\n\nHow to get to Tourist Information Office in PlaÃ§a de Catalunya\n\nMetro: Catalunya (Green Line, L3) and (Red Line, L1)\n\nHop on hop off sightseeing tourist bus stop\n\nNearest stop for Tourist Information Office in PlaÃ§a de Catalunya is \"PlaÃ§a de Catalunya\" with the \"hop on hop off\" sightseeing bus\n\nPublic bus\n\nPlaÃ§a Catalunya: 24, 41, 42, 55, 67, 68, H16, AerobÃºs\n\nCar parking\n\nLuggage Storage\n\nPasseig de GrÃ cia - A Shopping and Culture Street in Barcelona's City Centre\n\nLoewe on Passeig de GrÃ cia\n\nPasseig de GrÃ cia is a wide and glamorous street leading off from PlaÃ§a de Catalunya. It is a beautiful place to take an afternoon stroll down its tree-lined pavements, past the designer shops and cafÃ©s. During my visit the sun began to set, casting a soft early evening light over the old and ornate buildings.\n\nFollow my guided walk around Passeig de GrÃ cia and discover some recommended places that are slightly off the beaten track\n\nDinner in the City Centre\n\nTapaÃ§ 24\n\nTapaÃ§ 24 - A Tapas Bar on Passeig de GrÃ cia in the City Centre.\n\nHaving enjoyed a three-course Menu del Dia at lunchtime, I often find that evening time provides an opportunity to enjoy some tapas. As these are smaller dishes that are shared they can be as light or as filling as you wish.\n\nOn Passeig de GrÃ cia my favourite tapas bar is TapaÃ§ 24. This laid back restaurant is the creation of Carles Abellan - a famous Spanish chef. It is a way to sample typically Catalan Spanish tapas prepared to a high standard.\n\nTapaÃ§ 24\n\nCarrer Diputacio, 269\n\n08007 Barcelona, EspaÃ±a.\n\nTel: +34 93 488 0977\n\nOpening Times:\n\nMonday - Sunday: 09:00 - 00:00 Midnight\n\nOnce the day is over and it's time to rest your weary head and your full belly, take a stroll through Barcelona's streets and enjoy how they twinkle in the night-time. That's if you're not planning to hit the bars and clubs, of course! Barcelona city centre has something to offer everyone."
