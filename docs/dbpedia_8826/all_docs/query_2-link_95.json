        "text": "The Barcelona Card is the official tourist pass of Barcelona. It looks like a credit card, is incredibly easy to purchase and helps travelers save time and money during their holiday.\n\nThe Barcelona Card is a 3-in-1 transport card, museum pass and discount card.\n\nHolders of the Barcelona Card enjoy unlimited free travel by public transport, free entry to Barcelona´s best museums, 70+ deals and discounts on visits, tours, entertainment, shopping, dining and nightlife.\n\nNot only does this coveted card get you through the door to great Barcelona attractions, it can also help you skip the queues entirely at many of Barcelona´s most popular sights - saving valuable time on a tightly packed trip.\n\nPlus the card comes with a handy city guide available in six different languages outlining all the great deals included (think Gaudí's monuments, the Sagrada Família and Camp Nou).\n\nIn all, the card boasts over €320 in savings for those dedicated travelers who really work it.\n\nGetting your hands on a Barcelona Card is pretty straightforward: cards can be purchased at tourist information offices in Barcelona (full price) or online (discount) prior to your trip.\n\nThe card is activated on the first use, so no need to worry about the card expiring before you arrive in Barcelona.\n\nUse the booking form on the left to place a quick, secure order. After purchase, a voucher will be emailed to the given address and is ready to be printed and exchanged for the physical card.\n\nThere are multiple sites in Barcelona where you can trade in the voucher for the freshly minted Barcelona Card, including Barcelona Airport and Plaça Catalunya (see the full list here).\n\nExplore beautiful Barcelona on a budget - all it takes is one little card!\n\nUsing the Barcelona Card is quite easy as well: the card is activated when you first use it, for example on public transport or at the entrance of one of the participating attractions.\n\nKeep in mind that the Barcelona Card is valid for consecutive days - not 24-hour periods. For example, if you activate a 5-Day Barcelona Card on Monday at noon, it will expire on Friday at midnight.\n\nNow go take the Barcelona Card challenge and see how many unforgettable attractions you can hit before you card expires!\n\nRead more: discounts - prices - frequently asked questions"
