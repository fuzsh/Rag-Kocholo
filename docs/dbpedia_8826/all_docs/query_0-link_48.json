        "text": "Founded in 1318, the Archives of the Crown of Aragon served as a centralised deposit system for the administrative, economic and political memory of the Crown of Aragon's monarchy.\n\nOver the following centuries, the archives drew their stocks from the documents that were generated by the administrative apparatus of the state and other entities, allowing us today to reconstruct the history of the region and of great events in European history.\n\nIt is one of the largest and most important documentary collections of medieval Europe, and also of modern and contemporary times.\n\nFind out more about the selection of the site from the panel's report."
