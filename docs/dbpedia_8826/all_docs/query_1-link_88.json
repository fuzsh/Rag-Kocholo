A pause, allowing us to look back and appreciate the last ten years. We want this label to pay tribute to previous editions. In order to do so, we decided to reprint the nine labels that have been created up to now. We have made the labels seem like a birthday present, covering them with removable ink. In this way, the label is hidden, and you won’t know which label you have received until you scratch off the top layer. To add an extra twist, the tenth label is gold and features a prize.”\n\n2019 Edition"
