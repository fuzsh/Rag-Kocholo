        "text": "Visiting Barcelona with kids? Any parent (including myself) must plan a holiday very differently from those kids and carefree visitors.\n\nOn a city visit, you want to balance culture, museums and highlights with a good peppering of fun and interest for the little ones.\n\nNothing could be worse than spending all that money and having your children moaning about how boring everything is!\n\nAs an experienced family guide and parent living in Barcelona, I am here to make your life a little easier.\n\nIs Barcelona child-friendly? The answer is YES! And here is the most complete list of things to do with kids in Barcelona that you will find.\n\nOne big word of advice: don’t try to cram too much in as your offspring will get grumpy, tired and rebel. Balance a museum morning with a fun afternoon activity like beach and ice cream (great bribes for good morning behaviour).\n\nScroll down, see what activities might suit your family’s interest and have a great holiday. At the end of the article, you can also find some info on the useful Barcelona Family Card.\n\nThis post was updated in January 2024\n\n1- Park Güell\n\nDesigned by Antoni Gaudí, the architect really let his imagination run away with him on this one.\n\nIt has gingerbread-like houses at the main entrance, colourful broken tile mosaics decorating walls and seats, playful curvy lines and cool walkways to go under and over.\n\nIts high location makes for great views looking down into Barcelona.\n\nThis park is a great way to fit in a cultural visit that will not bore the kids. They can run skip jump around this architectural marvel.\n\nThe park’s most spectacular part is the Monumental Zone and panoramic areas, which require an entrance ticket.\n\nI strongly advise booking your tickets at least a few days in advance as they do sell out in high season.\n\nOUR TIP: It is super-hot in the summer and I always advise families to go first thing in the morning before the heat builds up. There are also children’s playgrounds and a picnic area within the monumental zone. The nearest entrance would be the side entrance on Olot Street.\n\nAddress: Carrer d’Olot, 1\n\nBUY TICKETS for Park Güell\n\n2- Cosmocaixa (Science Museum)\n\nI always love visiting science museums and you just can’t go wrong with kids in tow in this one.\n\nThe building itself is vast with many floors closed off or not exhibiting.\n\nFrom experience, my advice is to go down 5 floors via the beautiful spiral ramp (kids love it), and you will find the main exhibits. Here there are lots of fun things to engage all.\n\nYou can explore the Amazon rainforest, well a fraction of it anyway. Start by looking through the glass windows at the fish, turtles and waterlogged underneath the forest.\n\nGo through the dark educational tunnel underneath the trees (kids love this part, it is a little scary) and come up into the humid habitat itself.\n\nThere are even some native birds flying around for that touch of authenticity.\n\nThen there is the typical “touch the buttons and learn” section. Scientific experiments show you the theory behind everyday patterns of the world.\n\nFrom wave simulations to sandstorm dune makers, it is an interactive way for kids to learn.\n\nA section on geology helps them understand volcanoes and different types of rock.\n\nThere is even a reconstructed research hut from the Spanish base of Juan Carlos I in Antarctica.\n\nThat area is fleshed out with photos, explanations of the fragile ecosystem and cute model penguins which my son loves!\n\nCheck out what temporary shows are there, I have never been let down by one yet. There are also workshops, activities and a planetarium. These all cost extra but are worth researching to see which might appeal to your family.\n\nOUR TIP: The museum is free for kids under 16. If you are going to buy The Barcelona Card you can also enter free of charge to this attraction.\n\nAddress: Carrer d’Isaac Newton, 26\n\nBUY TICKETS for CosmoCaixa Barcelona\n\n3- Montjuïc Magic Fountain\n\nThe Magic Fountain is currently not running due to the drought in Barcelona.\n\nSeriously, a big must while here for the whole clan!\n\nIt’s got dancing water, lights, an amazing setting and is mesmerizing for any age group.\n\nThe show runs every 15 minutes and in between, you can climb stairs to get a great view of the city at night.\n\nIt is well connected by metro, train and bus and is a great free activity for the family.\n\nThe only downside is the large crowds and the late hour for sleep-starved kids.\n\nBe sure to check out the timetable as it varies a lot throughout the year and sometimes it is closed for maintenance.\n\nOUR TIP: If you don’t mind the later schedule, make sure you arrive when there is no daylight left as you will not get the full-colour impact from the fountain.\n\nAddress: Plaça de Carles Buïgas, 1\n\n4- Tibidabo Amusement Park\n\nThis is the classic family funfair of Barcelona with the oldest ride dating back to 1928.\n\nPerched on top of Tibidabo Hill, the views of Barcelona alone are spectacular. The Art Nouveau church beside the funfair is worth a peek before entering the main attraction.\n\nWhile it is no Disneyland, the park is a fun day out for all and only a 30-minute bus ride from the centre.\n\nYour entrance ticket allows free access to all the rides which are colour-coded for age-appropriate.\n\nAs the park is built on a slope there are quite a few levels to go up and down but lifts are available for those who still have kids in buggies.\n\nAs well as stomach-turning rides, you can find 3-D movies, a magic mirror maze and the beautiful Automat Museum (not to be missed).\n\nThere are basic eateries there (a little overpriced) or you can bring, as most locals do, a packed lunch.\n\nOUR TIP: The park is quite exposed and can be extremely hot in the middle of the day in the summer months. Bring lots of water, suntan lotion and sun hats for the family. The queue for the 1928 aeroplane ride moves very slowly and is not very spectacular. I found it was not worth the wait with a bored child, but it’s a classic with locals so they will do it, more for tradition’s sake.\n\nAddress: Plaça del Tibidabo, 3-4\n\nBUY TICKETS for Tibidabo Amusement Park\n\n5- Barcelona Aquarium\n\nWe all know that fish reside in aquariums and this is no different in Barcelona’s one.\n\nAs well as exotic fish, turtles, frogs and fossils on display there are also penguins, sharks and stingrays with timed feedings so visitors can catch all the action.\n\nI went here for my son’s birthday and was impressed by how much there was for kids to see and do.\n\nThere were lots of interactive exhibits where children could press buttons, climb through tubes, go down slides and let off steam in an educational way.\n\nA nice touch is a playground outside on the second floor where you can sip your coffee and eat your sandwich while keeping an eye on your hyperactive little charges.\n\nOne of the highlights is the Oceanarium with its automatic walkway through a large glass tube 80 metres long.\n\nAs you look through the glass it truly feels like you are in the deep depths viewing all the fish action. This includes being eyed up by a few impressive-looking sharks.\n\nOUR TIP: Sharks are only fed by divers on Tuesdays and Fridays so this is a good day to visit and catch a lot of the feedings for the various residents. Arrive inside before 11.30 as this is the first meal of the day starting with the penguins.\n\nAddress: Moll d’Espanya del Port Vell, s/n\n\nBUY TICKETS for Barcelona Aquarium\n\n6- Casa Batlló\n\nWho doesn’t like that great legend of Saint George and the dragon?\n\nIf it appeals to your bunch, then definitely visit this magical building. Casa Batlló is an architectural highlight that kids and adults alike can enjoy.\n\nIt is an apartment block designed by Gaudí and I have never met one kid who didn’t want to set up home here!\n\nThe basement has been recently recycled into two immersive rooms the Gaudí dome and Gaudí cube. Full of high-tech screens and gadgetry you enter an entirely different dimension. Kids LOVE IT!\n\nThe original Gaudí house itself displays colourful tiles, curved walls, a mushroom fireplace, turtle-inspired windows, a rib cage attic spiral staircase… the list goes on.\n\nThe kids will be given a pretty cool interactive screen where animations appear and old photos show you how the rooms used to look.\n\nYou will wander up to the attic and roof to meet guardian chimneys and a dragon roof!\n\nFor an extra charge, you can cram into the top balcony for a unique family portrait.\n\nThe visit ends, of course, in the souvenir shop of the building.\n\nOUR TIP: This house can get very cramped during busy periods so light permitting I recommend going early evening as the crowds drop drastically. Buy tickets online as not only you will skip the lines, but they are a lot cheaper than at the door.\n\nAddress: Passeig de Gràcia, 43\n\nBUY TICKETS for Casa Batlló\n\n7- Kids & Family Gothic Quarter Walking Tour\n\nThis was a tour I created a few years back and it is geared towards the whole family with a focus on children.\n\nIn this 2.5-hour fun-filled walk you visit a candy shop, hear Catalan stories, meet the giants, sing songs, do role play and laugh a lot.\n\nI have personally trained a handful of child-friendly guides who come carrying props and give out little workbooks with crayons for the children to complete during the walk.\n\nMy idea is an educational tour where children learn about Catalan history and traditions through play.\n\nThe walk is through the heart of the medieval city and takes in the Gothic Quarter highlights such as the King’s Square, government buildings, Roman ruins and Barcelona’s Cathedral.\n\nSo, parents, the pressure is off you to entertain the younger ones. Follow the guides and learn alongside your engaged children.\n\nThe scheduled tour is offered at 10 am every Saturday from April to October. In the Summer months, there is an extra tour on Wednesdays.\n\nIf there is no tour scheduled during your time in the city, or if you prefer a more personalized experience, it is also offered as a private kids’ tour all year round.\n\nOUR TIP: This tour is a great introduction to Barcelona and families usually regret doing it at the end of their visit. If you can time this action-packed activity for the beginning of your stay all the better.\n\nAddress: Plaça de l’Angel, 12\n\nBUY TICKETS for Kids & Family Gothic Quarter Walking Tour\n\nBUY TICKETS for Kids & Family Gothic Quarter Private Walking Tour\n\n8- Chocolate Museum\n\nIf your family has a sweet tooth you might be interested in this visit.\n\nThis is a nice little filler in a museum that provides insight into the world of chocolate.\n\nIt is not too big and 45 minutes to an hour is ample time to go through the building.\n\nIn that time, you will see cool chocolate sculptures (some a little old!) and learn the origin of chocolate and how Europe received and modified this new taste from the Americas.\n\nYou can round off the visit by trying some hot chocolate which is super yummy in their cafe.\n\nThere is also a gift shop so some tasty souvenirs for the folks back home are also an option.\n\nCheck out their workshops and family activities on their page and for an extra charge, your family could be elbow-deep in chocolate making!\n\nOUR TIP: The museum visit is not an expensive venture, but you can do it for free if you have purchased The Barcelona Card or the Barcelona Family Card.\n\nAddress: Carrer del Comerç, 36\n\nBUY TICKETS for Museu de la Xocolata\n\n9- Chocolate with churros\n\nA classic in Spain and I have never met a child who did not enjoy this calorie-ridden treat.\n\nClassic churros are sweet fried dough topped with sugar and served with a thick dipping chocolate sauce.\n\nIf you find thick custard or caramel or chocolate-filled churros, these are called porras.\n\nIf you want to step back in time with the kids go to Granja Viader, a classic of Barcelona.\n\nLocated a turn away from La Rambla, inside you will be greeted by waiters with dicky bows, café style marble tables and a little deli counter if you feel the need to buy ham or cheese. It has remained in the same family since it opened in 1910.\n\nIf your kids prefer something lighter they can try Cacaolat, a chocolate milkshake-like drink that was created here and now you can find in all bars and supermarkets in the country.\n\nOUR TIP: If planning a churros and chocolate stop with the kids, be aware that it is not a lunchtime custom. Most of these establishments will close for lunch. It is a morning or evening treat for the locals.\n\nAddress: Carrer d’en Xuclà, 4\n\nWebsite for Granja Viader\n\n10- Barcelona Zoo\n\nFancy a bit of Animal adventure while in Barcelona? Our zoo is located bang in the centre, on the outer edges of the old quarter.\n\nIts handy position makes it an easy bribe for the kids after a morning of historical sightseeing.\n\nThe easy layout of the zoo provides a pleasant walk around the enclosures. The explanations of each animal are nicely worded for the kids and focus on issues like extinction and conservation.\n\nAs well as the enclosures, children love the more interactive spaces such as the farm, pony rides, elephant training area and large playgrounds.\n\nYou might also be lucky enough to fit in feeding time with the very cute penguins.\n\nFor a few extra euros, an electric train ride can take you through most of the grounds! My son loved it (it was a super hot day that day!).\n\nAnd for kids that speak Spanish, check out their website for educational activities you can book online.\n\nOUR TIP: While there are restaurants inside the zoo complex, I would opt to bring the kids’ favourite: a picnic! There are wooden benches and tables set up for this purpose. Santa Caterina market is not so far away so a quick shop before your visit can provide you with a delightful feast for lunch. Entrance to the zoo is free with the Barcelona Family Card!\n\nAddress: Parc de la Ciutadella s/n\n\nBUY TICKETS for Barcelona Zoo\n\n11- Labyrinth Park\n\nStep back in time to the 18th century and visit the very splendid landscaped garden of a marquis.\n\nA bit off the beaten track but definitely an escape from the crowds, it is a great place to get in that tranquil family time.\n\nDonated to the city council by the Davalls, it has been open to the public since 1971 for a nominal entrance fee.\n\nThe highlight for kids is a nearly 2-metre-high maze where many fun games of hide-and-seek can be played.\n\nThere are small temples and pavilions and statues of Roman gods and mythological figures dotted throughout the park.\n\nAnd what is a magnificent garden without swans? You will find them paddling along the private canal linking water sources to pools and a waterfall.\n\nThe fantastic sprawling gardens that include a lot of trees will give you a sense of walking through a romantic forest.\n\nOUR TIP: Sundays and Wednesdays are free entry so it might save you a little to visit. They have started limiting the number of people on the free days so I would recommend coming on a Wednesday. Don’t plan this as a picnic destination as they do not allow you to bring food inside.\n\nAddress: Passeig dels Castanyers, 1\n\nWebsite for Parc del Laberint d’Horta\n\n12- Museu Blau (Natural History Museum)\n\nFirstly, the building that holds this Natural History Museum is just cool, with its triangular corners and pitch-black interior walls (eerily lit up).\n\nInside, there are many intriguing animations projected on the walls and floors helping to illustrate the evolution of Earth.\n\nThere are fossils, stones, skeletons, photos, and texture grids on display in glass cases but the most captivating for the young ones would be the real stuffed animals.\n\nThis old collection was re-housed here a few years back and also includes a wide array of exotic creepy crawlies for an added element of fun.\n\nThe museum descriptions can be a little dry so, as a parent, you may have to spice that up a little for your offspring.\n\nFor the toddlers, there is a special room where they can touch and examine all objects on show from pine cones to animal fur to test tubes to rocks.\n\nMy son had the best time ever here (tantrums leaving, of course) but please be aware it is only a 30-minute time allowance inside. You need to check out the timetable for this space as it is not accessible all the time.\n\nThis museum is not an expensive one but, if you don’t mind the local family crowds (kids might even make new friends), Sunday after 3 pm is a free entrance as well as all day on the first Sunday of the month.\n\nOUR TIP: There are a few excellent playgrounds behind the museum for the kids to let off steam after their visit. The first one to the side is for older kids, across from that is quite a high climbing frame with an impressive slide to get down. A 30-second extra walk brings you to the playground for toddlers.\n\nAddress: Plaza Leonardo da Vinci, 4-6\n\nBUY TICKETS for Museu de Cièncias Naturals de Barcelona\n\n13- Barcelona Beaches\n\nWhat kid doesn’t like the beach? One advantage of Barcelona as a family destination is that it is located bang on the Mediterranean coastline.\n\nIt’s the perfect bribe for a morning of good behaviour from your little ones.\n\nIn high season you can rent loungers with umbrellas and don’t be surprised to find a lot of touts selling cold beverages as well as ladies offering messages.\n\nThere are xiringuitos (outdoor bars located on the sand) where you can sit in comfort sipping a cold beverage while your children play. Be aware that prices are high here!\n\nYou can bring ping-pong gear or volleyballs and take advantage of the free playing facilities.\n\nRenting bikes to cycle from one end to the other can also be a nice thing to do.\n\nBarcelona city beaches can get pretty crowded in the summer with tourists and locals alike. Skip the weekend to avoid crowds.\n\nThe two quieter city beaches I recommend are Nova Icaria and Bogatell. Beaches near the Barceloneta neighbourhood just get too crazy busy.\n\nIf this sounds like too much hustle and bustle for your taste, you can find quieter more picturesque beaches outside Barcelona.\n\nOUR TIP: Don’t bring too many valuables with you and always keep an eye on your belongings. The beaches are a favourite hangout for the pickpockets of the city.\n\n14- Barcelona Bosc Urbà\n\nGet rid of all that pent-up energy and let the kids loose to climb to their heart’s content in an urban forest adventure course.\n\nLocated close to the Natural History Museum, it could be a nice balance between a museum visit and physical activity.\n\nMade out of concrete, metal and wire ropes, from the outside it looks like an unfinished petrol station.\n\nWho would guess it is an assault course with different levels to suit kids and adults from the age of 8 and up?\n\nThey have also recently added a jumping zone with giant balls and net slides for kids of 5 and up.\n\nWhile not strictly a cultural activity the advantage is that all children and teenagers will enjoy it.\n\nExpect to be equipped with hard helmets and harnesses, and don’t think about how far down the ground is on the higher levels. The staff will be on hand to help you out.\n\nOUR TIP: It usually closes for periods during winter for renovations so check their website closely to make sure it will be open. Arrive early to allow the time it will take to get around the circuits.\n\nAddress: Parc del Forum\n\nBUY TICKETS for Barcelona Bosc Urbà\n\n15- Montjuïc Cable Cars\n\nKids usually love heights and what better activity for the whole family to enjoy than a nice cable car ride to view the city from above?\n\nHere in Barcelona, we have 2 different cable car experiences, both located on Montjuïc mountain.\n\nPort Cable car (Telefèric del Port)\n\nThis is an 8-minute trip one way that leaves from the port to bring you to Mirador del Mar, a viewpoint located halfway up the mountain of Montjuïc.\n\nIt is a spectacularly high ride (70-90 metres) with great views over the port.\n\nThe cable towers date from the 1930s and give that sense of early 20th-century sightseeing.\n\nThe drawback is long queues and cramped cable cars (standing only) so you might not get a window view.\n\nYou can grab a cold drink at the spectacular terrace of the restaurant where the cable car ends. The views are great but the food is average so I would just stick to beverages here.\n\nMontjuïc Cable Car (Telefèric de Montjuïc)\n\nMore modern and cheaper is the Telèferic de Montjuïc.\n\nIts cable towers are not as high but it brings you to the fort at the top of the mountain so the views are just as spectacular.\n\nThere are 4 seats inside so you get to sit and enjoy the experience while not feeling crammed in. If there are less than 4 in your group, they will not make you share the ride with a stranger either.\n\nLines move quickly so you will not be waiting long, although the trip is a little shorter (around 5 minutes one way).\n\nYou can catch the funicular from Paral·lel metro station that will take you to the start of the ride.\n\nFinish off with a wander around the defensive castle at the top, again, affording great vistas of Barcelona.\n\nOUR TIP: Check out buying tickets online as at various times they offer a 10% discount for purchases over the web.\n\nBUY TICKETS for Telefèric de Montuïc\n\nBUY TICKETS for Telefèric del Port\n\n16- Hill of Montjuïc & Castle\n\nMontjuïc mountain looms over the city of Barcelona providing a welcome break from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nIt has many parks and Botanical Gardens, our 1992 Olympic Stadium, Art galleries and, at the very top, a defensive castle.\n\nWhat a great way to fire up any child’s imagination.\n\nIts roots are a 17th-century fort but it has been expanded over the years which means lots of nooks and crannies for the kids to explore.\n\nIt has great panoramic views of the city and kids can’t get enough of peering down from the defensive walls.\n\nThe visitors centre gives great insight into the interesting castle’s past and temporary exhibitions come and go.\n\nFees are reasonable and guided tours don’t cost that much (offered twice a day in English).\n\nOUR TIP: After the visit, walk towards the cable cars and follow the steps down. Within five minutes you’ll arrive at some really high slides that provide great thrills for the kids. It is free too! We often sit at a bar terrace just beside the slides and have a hard-earned beer while the kids go berserk on the slides!\n\nAddress: Ctra. de Montjuïc, 66\n\nBUY TICKETS for Montjuïc Castle\n\n17- Gaudí Experiència 4D\n\nHaven’t had time to prep the kids about Gaudí before leaving home? This place might be a fun solution for everyone!\n\nA stone’s throw away from Park Güell, it is an easy site to combine with the park visit.\n\nIt is not a place you will spend a long time in, so kids won’t be dragging their heels.\n\nThe exhibition space has interactive touch screens, models and, of course, a 4D film experience.\n\nThese are all interesting ways to get into the mindset and inspirations of this great man.\n\nOUR TIP: It is a handy attraction to combine with Park Güell. However, they open later than the park and close earlier so check the timetables carefully.\n\nAddress: Carrer de Larrard, 41\n\nBUY TICKETS for Gaudí Experiència 4D\n\n18- Mosaiccos\n\nThis is a really fun way to learn the trencadís mosaic method that Gaudí used in his architecture.\n\nThe whole experience is set in a small workshop that runs classes plus you get to bring the pieces you made home.\n\nIt is a nice downtime for the kids and a great bonding time for the whole family.\n\nI always recommend combining this on the same day as a Gaudí site so you can experience firsthand the skill and scale of the craftwork used in his buildings.\n\nLocated in the heart of the city you will not be plodding to the outskirts for this Art class.\n\nOUR TIP: If you are interested in this class, then definitely bring the kids to see the outside of Casa Batlló or Park Güell. These are the finest examples of mosaics being optimised in Gaudí’s work.\n\nAddress: Carrer dels Assaonadors, 10\n\nWebsite for Mosaiccos\n\n19- Barcelona Festivals\n\nHere we love holidays, and local neighbourhoods always have a few festivities a year.\n\nThese festivals are a great fun time for local families and, as a visitor, you should take advantage of all the fun free activities available.\n\nIt is a fantastic way to experience Catalan culture and traditions.\n\nLocal giant dolls will be paraded, sardanes danced, human castles built, concerts, parades… the list goes on.\n\nBarcelona’s main festival is La Mercè, on September 24th, where you will find the most spectacular events. However, these neighbourhood parties can be found throughout the summer with little research.\n\nOUR TIP: Not sure where to find info on local festivals? Our blog posts about what to do in various months of the year include festivals that are around that month.\n\n20- Giants Museum (La Casa dels Entremesos)\n\nThis local cultural centre is a big hit for adults and kids alike on our family tours.\n\nIn Barcelona we have the tradition of parading giants during festivals… and what an amazing sight it is.\n\nWalking mannequins stretch up to 5 metres high with eye-catching costumes each with an individual dance to perform.\n\nSome of these mammoth figurines live in this building alongside models of beasts and giant heads (on our tours we even allow the little ones to try them on).\n\nVideos run continually from screens on the walls illustrating all these figures in action during the festivals and make a fun wander around for young and old.\n\nPartly funded by donations, please don’t forget to leave a little something in the wooden coin box at reception as there is no entrance fee for this kids’ attraction.\n\nOUR TIP: At Christmas, there is a wonderful exhibition of hand-made mini-scenes, some showing the birth and others illustrating stories from Jesus’s childhood. It is an enchanting show but often missed by visitors as you have to head up the easily missed stairs to the second floor to catch it.\n\nAddress: Plaça de les Beates, 2\n\nWebsite for La Casa dels Entremesos\n\n21- Hop on Hop off bus\n\nFirst day in Barcelona and the kids are tired? Don’t want to walk anywhere? The hop-on hop-off bus is a great way to make the first-day fun while still seeing quite a bit of the city.\n\nChildren love the open-top bus with the wind in their hair and it also gives us parents an idea of the urban layout of the city.\n\nYou will get an overview of the main monuments and decide as a family what buildings you would like to go back to explore.\n\nMake sure you wear sunhats, and sunshades, and smear on that suntan lotion so there are no red faces by the end of the day.\n\nBarcelona has two companies: Barcelona Bus Turístic and Barcelona City Tour which provide the same concept and, more or less, the same routes.\n\nThe buses are clean and frequent, and the staff is friendly.\n\nYou can buy discounted family tickets and for a few euros can extend the daily ticket to last for 2 days.\n\nThere are combination tickets available that include major sites in Barcelona so compare all the offers against your plans before buying anything.\n\nThere is even an app to help organise the day, something kids will love to get involved with!\n\nOUR TIP: The only disadvantage of the tourist bus is the long queues to get on the ride at the main monuments. Not all stops are in the shade. My advice is to stay on the bus as much as possible and use it as an overview of the city, not as a form of transport.\n\nBUY TICKETS for Barcelona Bus Turístic\n\n22- Maritime Museum\n\nThis is a favourite for Catalan families and makes for a great museum visit.\n\nThe building itself is an old medieval shipbuilding yard (14th century) and it’s just beautiful and huge.\n\nThere are cool scale models of ships throughout the centuries, ancient maps that show peculiar versions of landmasses, morbid descriptions of life at sea and an interactive area with screens to help keep those little fingers occupied while learning.\n\nThe crowning glory is a life-size reconstruction of a 16th-century Spanish Armada flagship that is located at the heart of the museum. Children love it and you can even go up and wander around its deck.\n\nBecause of its vast size it also hosts travelling exhibitions of international fame. It could appeal to your young ones or not. Be aware that it is a separate entrance fee.\n\nOUR TIP: This is one of those museums that are free on Sunday afternoon (that’s when I visit). They have a coffee shop there too with a big outdoor patio where the kids vent off a little steam.\n\nAddress: Av. de les Drassanes, s/n\n\nBUY TICKETS for Museu Marítim de Barcelona\n\n23- Ciutadella Park\n\nI absolutely love this park and have spent many happy picnics here with my family.\n\nIt was built to house the Universal Exhibition of 1888 and still retains that spectacular splendour of the 19th century.\n\nThe centrepiece is the amazing fountain topped by a gold Aurora in her chariot announcing the sun’s arrival and, underneath in stone, the Birth of Venus.\n\nYou can climb to the top of the fountain (kids love this) and get great views down below.\n\nI always bring a few seeds along for my son to feed the ducks and geese that reside in the artificial lake at the front.\n\nA stone’s throw away from the fountain is a life-size woolly mammoth sculpture that children adore climbing on his trunk to get a Kodak moment.\n\nThere were supposed to be more life-size pre-historic animal figurines around the park but this is the only one constructed from this failed project. Be gentle with him as he is over 100 years old!\n\nYou can rent boats to paddle around another artificial lake in the centre although it is not a terribly big or deep lake!\n\nRickshaw-like bikes can be hired where a family of four can have fun pedalling around the park.\n\nThere always seems to be someone earning an extra buck by making gigantic bubbles out of 2 sticks, string and soapy water.\n\nApart from all this, there is just a great vibe in the park with plenty of shaded green areas to picnic in or play games.\n\nIt also houses the Catalan parliament, various botanic greenhouses (not open to the public) and, more exciting for kids, the zoo of Barcelona.\n\nOUR TIP: If you are a fan of ping-pong, bring some rackets with balls and take advantage of the free playing tables.\n\nAddress: Parc de la Ciutadella\n\n24- Museum of Illusions\n\nLocated in the heart of El Raval, this museum will be a sure hit with the kids.\n\nOn a visit with my sister and her little ones, we could not stop laughing and even my one-year-old son got involved in posing.\n\nHow does it work? Well, scenes are painted realistically on floors and walls and you simply insert yourself into the mural and get a member of your crew to take a photo with their camera.\n\nSome of the paintings relate to Barcelona (we helped build Sagrada Familia in one composition) and others are just a good laugh.\n\nWe got about 45-50 minutes of fun out of the visit as it is quite a small space and it might feel a bit squashy if there are a lot of visitors.\n\nOUR TIP: It is now under the umbrella of the Big Fun Museum (see below) and with a combined ticket to both attractions you can get a nice discount. Please remember that it is not in the same location as the Big Fun Museum (only a 5-minute walk away). This is not very clear on their website.\n\nAddress: Carrer del Pintor Fortuny, 17\n\nBUY TICKETS for Museum of Illusions\n\n25- Big Fun Museum\n\nThink that the Museum of Illusions is a great option for your family? Why not combine it with the Big Fun museum off Las Ramblas?\n\nThey are run by the same company and they offer good combo deals for the family.\n\nIt is more of the fun illusions but, in this museum, they use more 3-D props rather than 2-D paintings.\n\nThere is an upside-down house, giant’s home, world of sweets and so on.\n\nIt is definitely a place to hang out with the kids and just horse around having fun!\n\nOUR TIP: This museum is just across from the Boqueria Food Market so you could combine it with a fun visit for lunch. The bustling market has lots of cool food stands as well as tiny restaurants with seating. Kids love it!\n\nAddress: La Rambla, 88\n\nBUY TICKETS for Big Fun Museum\n\n26- Wax Museum\n\nThis beautiful old building in La Rambla houses some great adventures for your family to explore! It has undergone a facelift during the pandemic and you can really tell the difference.\n\nUp until recent times, it was focused on reproductions of famous historical Spanish people. However, after the renovation, you can find anyone there, from Picasso to The Beatles or even a full Star Wars dedicated room.\n\nWonder from theme room to theme room learning about famous Catalans, facing death with the pirates, getting lost in space and much more!\n\nLike most wax museums it’s geared towards older kids who would recognise more of the famous people and film sets on show.\n\nSome of the highlights for kids are the horror and fantasy section and the submarine cabin. They can feel like Captain Nemo for a few minutes.\n\nFor a small additional fee, you can visit the museum workshop! I definitely recommend it for a behind-the-scenes look at the artistry and craftwork of the wax mannequins on display.\n\nOUR TIP: After your visit, have a refreshment at El Bosc de Les Fades, the bar next door that is part of the museum. The young ones will love exploring all the different corners while you sip on a glass of wine.\n\nAddress: La Rambla, 6\n\nBUY TICKETS for the Wax Museum\n\n27- El Bosc de Les Fades\n\nIf any of you read the Enchanted Wood series as a child, then this is the place for you.\n\nHead off Las Ramblas in the direction of the Wax Museum and you’ll discover the Forest of the Fairies.\n\nNow, this is actually a cafe and bar, a fun family-friendly bar with a difference.\n\nThe moment you walk in you realise you are no longer in the city but rather in a forest complete with gnarled trees, mischievous gnomes, stars and rivers.\n\nThe kids will love exploring the space from corner to corner and be so surprised when suddenly all the lights flash and it starts to rain!\n\nThis is definitely a treat for the young and the young at heart.\n\nOUR TIP: Go in the late afternoon as you’ll have a better chance of getting a table. It can get very busy.\n\nAddress: Passatge de la Banca, 7\n\nWebsite for El Bosc de les Fades\n\n28- El Rei de la Màgia\n\nImagine rich red velvet curtains against black painted walls, old wooden glass counters and a shopkeeper with a sense of the dramatic.\n\nAll these you will find in El Rei de la Màgia and more.\n\nBoasting to be the oldest magician’s shop in Europe, your children will not be disappointed.\n\nWhen I visited with my niece and sister, we explained our budget and the age of my little charge and the owner did the rest.\n\nShe performed a variety of suitable tricks which were highly entertaining.\n\nOur little budding magician picked her favourite and was quickly whisked behind the curtain and shown the mechanics of the magic item.\n\nIt was a lovely experience with a small family company and worth a visit while here in Barcelona\n\nOUR TIP: If you haven’t had time to catch a glance at the Giants in the city, this establishment has its own sitting in the shop, which they bring out for the parades. They also have a display of Giant heads for sale.\n\nAddress: Carrer de la Princesa, 11\n\nWebsite for El Rei de la Màgia\n\n29- Las Golondrinas boat trip\n\nWhat kid doesn’t like a boat ride? Take in Barcelona harbour and shoreline on these very reasonably priced small ferries!\n\nThere are 2 tours available: one of the harbour (45 min) and the other with harbour and shoreline (1 hour). I recommend the second tour as you would certainly get more bang for your buck.\n\nAfter a stroll down Las Ramblas toward the harbour, you can buy tickets and set off on your adventure sea voyage. The great thing about this excursion is there is something in it for everyone.\n\nWhy not grab a drink or ice cream from the bar as you take in the sights?\n\nDon’t forget to bring your camera with you and if you are super lucky you could spot the occasional friendly dolphin!\n\nOUR TIP: The evening tours are a little more special as they cast a golden light on the ocean views. This is one of the free activities included in the Barcelona Family Card.\n\nAddress: Moll de les Drassanes, 2\n\nBUY TICKETS for Las Golondrinas\n\n30- Illa Fantasia\n\nSummer temperatures can get quite high in Barcelona making children quite sluggish and grumpy.\n\nOne way to cool down is to head to Barcelona’s biggest water park.\n\nBoasting over 22 water slides, toboggans, wave machines, swimming pools and more, it makes for a fun day trip for the kids.\n\nIt is outside the city centre and connected by train, not by metro (you can still use a transport pass in this zone).\n\nThere is a free shuttle bus that collects you from the station to the park so you need to spend at least half a day here to make the trip worthwhile.\n\nIt opens from June through to September when the temperatures are quite high so don’t plan this for a family Easter or a Christmas visit.\n\nOUR TIP: July and August get super busy with local families, so, if you are visiting then, be aware there will be queues for the more popular attractions. Try to go on a weekday as weekends will always be busier.\n\nAddress: Finca Mas Brassó\n\nBUY TICKETS for Illa Fantasia\n\n31- Columbus Monument\n\nIf high vantage points thrill you and small spaces don’t bother you or the kids, then the Columbus Monument is a must.\n\nIt was constructed for the Universal Exhibition of 1888 and took 6 years to build.\n\nThere is much discussion as to which way Columbus is pointing. Some say the New World, others his home city of Genoa. Interestingly, he is actually pointing north, in the direction of Algeria.\n\nThe monument stands within a curious little roundabout surrounded by many lanes of traffic. At the base, you’ll find a gift shop and some information.\n\nThe real treat, however, is in the form of the lift that will take you to the top of the monument.\n\nIt is 63 meters up and the lift opens its doors onto a small observational platform that only fits a handful of people at a time. Here the views are incredible and kids will adore this experience.\n\nOUR TIP: Barcelona Tourist Office sometimes offers discounted tickets online so it is worth checking their page to save a few pennies! Find the link below.\n\nAddress: Plaça Portal de la pau, s/n\n\nBUY TICKETS for Columbus Monument\n\n32- IceBarcelona\n\nIf the heat is getting to the whole family, a cooling drink in Barcelona’s ice bar might be a fun idea.\n\nThe temperatures are at a cool 12 degrees and warm coats are provided for everyone as part of the entrance fee.\n\nYou will also be given a free drink in an ice glass while you view the cool 80’s sculptures on show within the bar.\n\nIf the temperatures get too cold for you they do have a lovely sit-down terrace in the sun also!\n\nIt is located in Port Olympic so swimming and the beach can go hand in hand with this site.\n\nThe downside is that it works out quite pricey just for 1 drink and the bar is not actually that big.\n\nOUR TIP: While the bar provides coats, it does not provide shoes. Make sure you bring more than summer flip-flops if you don’t want frostbite on the little toes.\n\nAddress: Carrer de Ramon Trias Fargas, 2\n\nBUY TICKETS for IceBarcelona\n\n33- Camp Nou Stadium & Barça Museum\n\nThe stadium is currently closed for renovations but you can still visit the FC Barcelona Museum and the construction viewpoint.\n\nA must for those football-crazy kids.\n\nThe World-famous stadium was constructed in the 1950s and today seats nearly 100,000 spectators.\n\nBarça’s football team is one of the best in the world and seeing a match here is always an experience.\n\nAlas, sometimes schedule, availability of tickets and price might not be feasible. Don’t despair, you can still visit the grounds and museum all year round.\n\nThey offer many different tours and packages and they are not cheap.\n\nThe basic ticket is the entrance to the stadium and exhibition space.\n\nYou can get more expensive packets that give you more access to private areas like the changing rooms etc.\n\nOUR TIP: Always check their website for timings as it is a functioning stadium so they close their doors for different events such as a match!\n\nAddress: Carrer d’Arístides Maillol, 12\n\nBUY TICKETS for Barça Stadium Tour & Museum\n\nFor soccer fans, watching the likes of Messi doing their thing live on a football field is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.\n\nIf your children follow football, this will probably be the highlight of their trip.\n\nCamp Nou holds 100,000 people so, as you can imagine, the type of seats (and prices) vary enormously.\n\nIf you are planning to see a big game (against Real Madrid or a Champions match, for example), try to buy the tickets as soon as you can. Even that could prove quite difficult.\n\nYou can always try to get some with illegal re-sellers around the stadium but I strongly advise against this. Not only the price will be astronomical but you might end up with a fake ticket.\n\nOUR TIP: Barcelona not only has one football team. Try to catch an R.C.D. Espanyol match. Don’t think that this is a third-division unknown team though. It plays in the National league together with the big teams like F.C. Barcelona or Athletic of Bilbao. Tickets will be cheaper and the atmosphere great!\n\nBUY TICKETS for F.C. Barcelona matches\n\nBUY TICKETS for R.C.D. Espanyol matches\n\n35- Lock-Clock escape room\n\nWhat a great invention for family fun!\n\nEscape rooms follow various themes (like being in prison or a jungle) and by solving different clues you must get out.\n\nDepending on the place, you could get costumes, actors could be participating… It all depends on the venue.\n\nIt has become the rage here in Barcelona with countless game rooms springing up everywhere.\n\nIt is definitely worth researching which themes suit your family and which are child-appropriate.\n\nThe experience I like is Clock-Lock, as it was the only one I could find that had a Gaudí mystery, which is a great learning experience.\n\nThey also have an adventure that is geared towards young children which is not so easy to find in most game rooms.\n\nOUR TIP: Another option if you have teenagers is to check out our online mystery game: Gaudí’s Best-Kept Secret. This would be an activity to do before you visit the city. As a family, you can learn a lot about the architect in a fun and exciting way.\n\nAddress: Passatge del Patriarca, 4-10, Local D\n\nBUY TICKETS for Lock-Clock Escape Room\n\n36- Excursions in a kayak\n\nAlways a hit with the kids is the beach and swimming.\n\nWhy not take it a step further and add a kayak or a snorkel combined with the breathtaking beauty of Costa Brava?\n\nThis beautifully craggy coastline with clear blue water starts about half an hour’s drive north of Barcelona and can provide a great break from city sightseeing.\n\nYou could do it yourself by renting a car and hiring kayaks in your chosen town along the coast.\n\nHowever, if it is just a day trip, lots of tour companies take the hassle out of planning.\n\nI personally recommend the local company Excursions Barcelona. Stevie, the owner, is very personable and cares a great deal about his client’s satisfaction.\n\nThey are well-established and have been up and running for a few years now. Highly recommended.\n\nOUR TIP: My advice is to plan it for the middle of your stay. It will give variety to the holiday so you don’t overload the kids with too much city in one go.\n\nAddress: Plaça d’Antonio López\n\nBUY TICKETS for Kayaking with Excursions Barcelona\n\nBarcelona for kids with the Barcelona Family Card\n\nIf you are planning to stay between 3 to 5 days and fit in a lot of kid’s attractions, then it might make sense to purchase the Barcelona Family Card.\n\nThis pass has just been launched by the tourist board and gets you free entry into the following family favourites:\n\nBarcelona Aquarium\n\nPoble Espanyol\n\nBarcelona Zoo\n\nLas Golondrinas boat trip\n\nSant Pau Recinte Modernista\n\nScience Museum (Cosmocaixa)\n\nChocolate Museum\n\nWax Museum\n\nColumbus Monument\n\nAs well as that, it offers a 20% discount for other kid-friendly activities:\n\nTibidabo Amusement Park\n\nMosaiccos workshop\n\nCatalunya en miniatura\n\nPort Aventura World\n\nMarineland\n\nUnlimited free public transport is also included in the ticket which can be quite handy in Barcelona.\n\nThese are the prices depending on the duration you choose (children’s price applies to 4 to 12 years old):\n\n72 hours (adult/child): €70/€55\n\n96 hours (adult/child): €80/€60\n\n120 hours (adult/child): €90/€65\n\nBUY BARCELONA FAMILY CARD\n\nIt is a very good deal if you fit in the pricey attractions like the Zoo or the Aquarium.\n\nJust check your schedule and see what economically works for you.\n\nThe Barcelona Family Card is available online and activates once you enter your first attraction.\n\nEach family member gets their own smart card which means you are not overpaying if you are a single parent or small family.\n\nOUR TIP: this is a brand-new project so keep checking what new family-friendly activities are being included as the popularity of this ticket grows.\n\nI hope this post has helped you a little bit in planning your family holiday in Barcelona.
