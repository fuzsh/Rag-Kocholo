        "text": "U.S.-born Mexico international Julián Araujo is closing in on a transfer from Barcelona to English Premier League side Bournemouth, a source confirmed to ESPN.\n\nThe 22-year-old was unable to secure a place in Barcelona's first team for the upcoming season and was informed that they would seek a transfer before the end of the summer transfer window.\n\nBarcelona are willing to accept a proposal of €10 million (near $11 million) including €7 million fixed and €3 million in variables. The LaLiga giants are also seeking to insure a percentage of any future transfer of Araujo from Bournemouth.\n\nA possible buyback clause, which currently isn't a priority, may be included.\n\nTransferring Araujo would mean an economic boost and small relief on the path to financial fair play for Barcelona.\n\nAraujo was also reportedly on the radar of Sevilla -- now led by former Las Palmas coach Francisco Garcia Pimienta -- although it's unlikely that they would be willing to pay the amount that Barcelona are aiming for. The relationship between both teams is also strained.\n\nAfter being signed by Barcelona for €5 million ($5.46 million) from the LA Galaxy in 2023, Araujo made 25 appearances on loan with Las Palmas last season."
