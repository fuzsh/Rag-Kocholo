        "text": "La Sagrada Familia (“The Sacred Family”) is arguably one of Gaudí’s most famous and impressive works, even though it is still not yet completed. Work began in 1882 and continues to this day, so expect some scaffolding, and lots of other visitors, but don’t be dismayed: The site remains an incredible monument worth visiting. As with much of Gaudí’s work, the beauty lies in the almost hidden details, so keep your head on a swivel! Remember to admire the building from a distance as well. From across the lake, the Nativity facade stares out at Barcelona in all its Gothic glory, and it makes a perfect picture. Photo by jacinta lluch valero/Flickr.\n\nAn astounding feat by the genius/insanity of Gaudi, La Sagrada Familia was a truly absolute reminder of the power of a goal and persistent dedication. While it’s not due to be completed until 2026 (when, I hope, my yet-to-exist-kids will be able to check out the basilica in all its glory), the structure and interior of the church is magnificent–and, as my brother puts it, “majestic.” In summer, I recommend visiting in the early afternoon when the sun is still shining enough to pierce the stained glass, but not enough to make your back drip. The audio guide, however cheesy the headset, provides an amazing way to immerse oneself in the history and insanity of the church. The way the light filters through the stained glass; the echo of the acoustic reverberation of the many languages spoken inside its walls; the forest-like structure of the main room; the plethora of angles and shapes and colours–I’m hard-pressed to believe that Gaudi was anything but a visionary. It’s a sight you must see for yourself.\n\nStep in from the busy street. Breathe in the dim light of Gaudí’s Sagrada Família as your eyes become accustomed to the change. Commenced in 1882, this edifice was less than a quarter finished when Gaudí was struck by a street car and killed in 1926 at the age of 73. The continuance of its construction relies on private donations. But, it is a beautiful break during the day, especially by bike. More than just his burial site, the Sagrada Família, the large Roman Catholic church in Barcelona, Spain is Antoni Gaudí i Cornet’s unfinished masterpiece. The Spanish Catalan architect from Rues became involved in 1883 and transformed it with the influence of the curvilinear Art Nouveau forms he is so well-known for today into a church building of which it is almost impossible to find its like in the entire history of art. Enter from the hustle and bustle of the Barcelona streets into its grand, vaulted space and become immediately whisked away to another dimension, one of the symmetrical grandeur and awe-inspiring brilliance. On the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaudí is said to have remarked: “My client is not in a hurry.” And once you’ve stepped inside his imagination, you won’t be either.\n\nTemple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família, or more commonly known as La Sagrada Familia is a really famous Roman Catholic church nestled in the heart of Barcelona. The grandeur of the architecture and historical significance truly make this a national marvel and one of Barcelona’s most visited sites. As always, there was still a lot of construction, but through it all, you could still see the immense beauty and intricate details of the edifice. I was mostly interested in the site because it was developed by one of my favorite artists, Antoni Gaudí; he never ceases to amaze. The building has many facades and each one holds a different symbolic and historical significance, so you should try to make it around the entire complex. Since construction is expected to continue until 2030 (as I was told by one of the guides), it is advisable to call beforehand and make sure the museum is open to the public on that day. I was told that with the construction, their opening hours are erratic and they will without notice shut down the church. Another thing I recommend is viewing it at night when all the lights are lit and the structure is glowing along the beautiful Barcelona skyline.\n\nLa Sagrada Familia is Gaudi’s masterpiece...a towering cathedral that captures the beauty of nature from the depths of the sea to the forest treetops. If you get there early in the morning, right when the doors oen, you should have the space to yourself for a little while before the crowds come pouring in. Purchase access to the towers and take the elevators up right away to avoid lines and catch a breath-taking view of Barcelona. Explore the inside and two facades, and marvel at how the white stone interior is brought to life by the colorful stained-glass windows.\n\nAntoni Gaudí and his unfinished masterpiece has ruined architecture and design for me forever. The Sagrada Familia is, by far, the most impressive building I have stepped foot in during my lifetime. I won’t spend much time writing about this place, as the building clearly speaks for itself. If the allure of Barcelona alone isn’t enough to drive you to Spain, then perhaps the appeal of stepping into the living embodiment of Tim Burton’s dreams will help you along. Simply the most awe-inspiring building ever erected.\n\nOne of my favorite things to visit in Barcelona is the world-famous Sagrada Familia. I especially love paying for a ticket to go up in the church’s many towers for a unique view of the inside of the church and a bird’s-eye view of Barcelona like this one. I loved the contrast here between the very old, weathered church and the very new, modern city. La Sagrada Familia is a true architectural and cultural masterpiece that’s not to be missed on any trip to Barcelona.\n\nOne of my favorite things to visit in Barcelona is the world-famous Sagrada Familia.

I took this shot from the top of one of the church’s towers looking straight down the tower at the street below - the people looked like little ants.

You could spend a whole day in the church and still not see all the beautiful details it has to offer. I especially like this colorful chandelier hanging over the altar. The bright lanterns aren’t something you would normally expect to find in a church, but then again this isn’t just any church.

You could spend all day in the church and still not see all of the amazing architectural details both inside and outside the church.

One of my favorite things about the church is this gilded dome - I love the way the light practically glows when it reflects off the gold leaf. La Sagrada Familia is a true architectural and cultural masterpiece that’s not to be missed on any trip to Barcelona.\n\nAfter finishing a lovely walking tour with Runner Bean Tours (highly recommended!), myself and a couple of girls I met in the group decided to check out the Sagrada Familia. We took the elevator up one of the towers (sadly, I can’t remember which one) and, on our way back down, passed one of the sections of the church that was still under construction. This was one of my favourite pictures from that rest stop. I felt as though I was on top of the world and in another world, all at the same time.\n\nReading about and seeing photographs of La Familia Sagrada cannot not even begin to help one grasp the awesome splendor of this cathedral. It truly is beyond description AND the very long wait in line. Hire a guide so you can skip that part - it might be worth the expense if you’re sort of time. In October, off season, the wait was about 1 & 1/2 hours. If one waits to visit until 2015 the cathedral might even be completed.\n\nAs an American, it’s impossible to travel throughout Europe without the mouth-dropping “Ohhhh”. When you’re less than 150 years old, as we are here in Colorado, you simply don’t see breathtaking architecture that makes you look back to your roots with wonder. You expect to be completely blown away by things that are hundreds of years old. Yet in Barcelona, it isn’t the ancient architecture that stops you in your tracks; it’s something a mere hundred years old. La Sagrada Familia is at the top of every tourist to-do list you’ll find for the Barcelona area. And with good reason. As you circle it from the outside, not only is it astonishing to think of how someone had the dream for something so amazing, it’s equally surprising to think of how many people it has taken to create it. And while the outside can take your breath away, it’s the inside that really pushes you over the top. Every corner has something to marvel at. The height of every column leaves you stretching just a little more to take it all in. And though you’ll undoubtedly click the shutter on your camera again and again, nothing allows you to take away the feeling you will have as you stand there gazing up awe.\n\nHere I worked for 2.5 years before I quit to be a fulltime city tourguide. It’s been a privilege to see it growing: when I arrived they were just starting to rise the columns, and you could still see the sky from inside. Now that the inside is finish, it’s so amazing!). You’ve never seen anything like this, and I don’t allow any client to tell me that they don’t want to see visit one more church: it’s not like any other church! And they all agree with me as soon as they go inside. I still get the chills every time I look up!\n\nAntoni Gaudi was a man well ahead of his time! His creative mind gave life to this remarkable cathedral, though that term doesn’t do the building justice. Before visiting Spain I read a review that said not to bother going inside, the wait for tickets was long and it was the outside that was the most impressive; that is the most inaccurate review I have ever read. You can purchase your ticket on-line the day before to avoid the long lines and make sure you include a trip up to the top of one of the towers for an amazing view! I have seen my fair share of cathedrals and churches around the world and this is the only one that made me cry from the sheer beauty of it. The fairly simple design of the interior and the tall, thin columns create an almost ethereal feeling. The stained glass windows in the shape of flowers filled with geometric glass pieces were a welcome change from the religious iconography normally found in churches. I find it almost impossible to describe this building or the feeling it gives to those who take the time to really feel what it has to say. Not to be missed if you’re in Barcelona!\n\nOf course if you’re going to Barcelona you already know about Sagarda Familia. Quick important tip though... do not, repeat do not!!! wait in line...buy to tickets through ATM at La Caixa ..it can only be done from this bank but there are a ton of locations throughout the city. You can buy a times entry. It is a must! You’ll thank me later."
