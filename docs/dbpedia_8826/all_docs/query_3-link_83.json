        "text": "If you are a native English speaker, learning the language of Catalan isn’t an easy task. Plentiful resources exist for Spanish speakers to educate themselves, but when it comes to learning directly from English, your options are scarce.\n\nSome of these topics may prove to be extremely simple to you. If this is the case, I encourage you to skip ahead.\n\nMy goal is for this to serve as a resource for people who are learning Catalan. I have tried to do a real ‘deep dive’ in the language before, and since realised that instead, I want to learn Catalan fast. There’s so much that is taught in classes that is irrelevant to day to day life, and yet so much seems to get skimmed over.\n\nBy publishing this work before it is ‘complete’; while in the act of learning Catalan myself, I hope to capture the simple things that many polyglots gloss over, and document helpful resources that I find along the way.\n\nAs a result you may want to check back every so often to get the latest updates and resources.\n\nMotivation\n\nAs a mono-lingual Australian, I was faced with a few options when I moved to Andorra:\n\nlearn Spanish,\n\nlearn Catalan,\n\nlearn Spanish, then Catalan, or\n\nbe confused about everything and live in an English bubble.\n\nNumber 4 wasn’t one I was willing to entertain. Many have argued that “you only need Spanish”, and they are true. I could get away with it. But seeing as I am a guest in this country, I want to show respect to it’s people.\n\nOutside of Andorra, a good deal of my life takes part in Catalonia too. I often find myself in the Spanish provinces of Barcelona, Girona, Lleida and Tarragona.\n\nI want to reach B1 proficiency in Catalan.\n\nWhy Learn to Speak Catalan vs Spanish?\n\nIf you are reading this while planning to visit or start a life in Andorra, know that language here is a mixed bag. Due to the high percentage of immigrants living here, it’s not uncommon to find yourself speaking with someone who can only speak French, or Spanish, or even Russian.\n\nBarcelona is the same. Lots of workers come to the city from elsewhere in Europe, and for practicality’s sake, they’ll usually pick up Spanish unless they want to work with the Catalan government (Generalitat de Catalunya) or similar work in the provinces.\n\nAs a result, trying to learn Catalan in Barcelona can be tricky, as the locals will revert back to Spanish as soon as your show your inexperience.\n\nBut when you’re in a location where Catalan is proudly spoken, the true benefit comes out.\n\nWith the ability to speak some limited Catalan, my experience shows me that respect is reciprocal. Where I could easily be dismissed as yet another tourist, as soon as I start with some Catalan, I’m met with a smile.\n\nLanguage Fundamentals\n\nWhat you’re about to read below is more for myself, because apparently I didn’t pay much attention in school.\n\nWe need to identify some basic fundamentals of all languages before we learn about how they work in Catalan.\n\nThey all get more complicated than this, but my goal is to keep this as simple as possible.\n\nAdjectives\n\nWords that describe nouns.\n\nExamples:\n\nJase drives a cool car.\n\nMy new bike is lighter than the one I had before.\n\nThere were twenty one children in Emily’s class.\n\nAdverbs\n\nWords that (mostly) describe adjectives or verbs.\n\nExamples:\n\nJase drove his car quickly.\n\nChristopher’s new bike is very light.\n\nEmily listened to her teacher attentively.\n\nNouns\n\nNaming words.\n\nExamples:\n\nHis name was Jase Rodley.\n\nIf he was the boss everything would be different.\n\nMy sister helped me with the homework task.\n\nA child laughed loudly.\n\nLet’s meet at Fàbrica Moritz in Barcelona.\n\nVerbs\n\nWords that describe what the subject is doing and feeling.\n\nExamples:\n\nJase drove his car quickly.\n\nChristoper pedalled his new bike.\n\nAllison was proud of her daughter.\n\nVerb Conjugations\n\nThe changing of verbs to show the subject as a different person or number of people, tense, and more.\n\nExamples of the verb to be:\n\nI am\n\nyou are\n\nhe/she/it is\n\nwe (plural/a group which I am part of) are\n\nyou (plural/a group which I am not part of, but you are) are\n\nthey (plural/a group which neither of us are part of) are\n\nCatalan Alphabet & Pronunciations\n\nIf you’re going to speak Catalan, you need to learn how to pronounce some letters. The good news here is, Catalan is very literal, there aren’t any silent letters so you can read the words out loud as they are written.\n\nDepending on where you are from, you may be used to being ‘lazy’ with your pronunciations. As an Aussie, I grew up with a lot of slang and or slurred words. Travel has taught me to speak very ‘clean’ or ‘tight’ English, which enables English as second language speakers to understand me more easily.\n\nThese same clear pronunciations help a lot when it comes to learning correct pronunciation in Catalan.\n\nHowever there are some different sounds than you may be used to. I will use some examples below to try and make them obvious. The bolded part of each word is the emphasis I’m trying to convey.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAs you can see, most of these sounds are very familiar.\n\nPronunciation of Letter Combinations\n\nWhere it gets a bit more complex is in letter combinations;\n\ngu\n\nig\n\nll\n\nl·l\n\nix\n\nny\n\nqu\n\nrr\n\nss\n\ntx\n\nSorry, I ran out of time. More details coming soon!\n\nColloquial Terms\n\nComing very soon:\n\nNumbers\n\nDays\n\nMonths\n\nTime\n\nSeasons\n\nProximity (tall/high, in front of, behind, etc)\n\nCatalan Noun Tricks\n\nI’ll find out what the academic term is for these in the future, but for now there are some tricks you can use for nouns. The core part of the word is the same in both Catalan and English, but the ending of the word is different.\n\nYou do this by replacing:\n\n-ance with -ància\n\nimportance becomes importància\n\n-ence with -ència\n\ndifference becomes diferència\n\n-sion with -sió\n\nconclusion becomes conclusió\n\n-ty with -tat\n\nliberty becomes llibertat\n\n-tion with -ció\n\ncoordination becomes coordinació\n\nThis won’t work in every single situation, so you won’t learn perfect Catalan by using these rules, but it can help to grow your vocabulary quickly if you just want to be able to speak the language day to day like I do.\n\nCatalan Verb Conjugations\n\nIn Catalan verb conjugations primarily relate to 6 different subjects:\n\njo (I)\n\ntu (you)\n\nell/ella (he, her)\n\nnosaltres (we, a group which I am part of)\n\nvosaltres (you, a group which I am not part of)\n\nells/elles (they, a group which neither of us are part of)\n\nThese three conjugations are used in 3 different forms:\n\n-ar\n\n-er, -re\n\n-ir\n\nHere are some examples:\n\nCatalan Words You Already Know\n\nMore info coming soon, but for now:\n\n-ant words\n\nabundant\n\narrogant\n\nbrilliant\n\ndistant\n\nelegant\n\nimportant\n\nirrelevant\n\nradiant\n\nrelevant\n\nreluctant\n\nvigilant\n\n-ent words\n\nabsent\n\naffluent\n\ndecadent\n\nequivalent\n\nfrequent\n\nintelligent\n\npatient\n\npermanent\n\npresent\n\nsilent\n\nviolent\n\nCatalan Learning Resources\n\nCultura.ad\n\nenciclopèdia.cat\n\nExercisis de catala\n\nGalí\n\nIntercat\n\nOptimot\n\nI find this useful for getting a better understanding of a word when other translation tools are ambiguous. Seeing it used in context makes the true meaning more obvious.\n\nPractical Guide to English Usage\n\nmay sound odd, but this is written specifically for Catalan speakers, so it’s helpful to read this while taking an opposing perspective.\n\nVerbs.cat\n\nWiktionary Frequency Lists\n\nWikitravel Phrase Book\n\nPlease Leave a Comment!\n\nIf you see something here that is wrong, please tell me! I’m learning and I want to know if my understanding of something is incorrect.\n\nAlso, if a certain strategy or resource has really helped you, please share. The longer the resource list we can create for English speakers who want to speak Catalan well, the faster we can all reach “fluency”!"
