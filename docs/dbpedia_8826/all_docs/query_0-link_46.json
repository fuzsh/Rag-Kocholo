Essences with its own identity, entirely manufactured in Barcelona by true artisans.\n\nSiblings, with a common vision and an unconditional love for their city, founded Carner Barcelona in 2010.\n\nDescendants from a long family of Spanish leather artisans, Sara and Joaquim learned from an early age the importance of quality craftsmanship and the value of local work. They have proudly instilled these values in Carner Barcelona.\n\nThe creative process, the design and the manufacture of our perfumes take place in Barcelona.\n\nWe rely on the experience and dedication of our local suppliers so that our fragrances are filled with the Mediterranean culture that we want to evoke.\n\nPerfumes created with the most refined ingredients that evolve on the skin throughout the day, revealing all its facets.\n\nWood, a classic Mediterranean material, noble and warm, is the DNA of the brand. It is visually represented in the sustainable solid caps of Carner bottles.\n\nThe elegant glass bottle is an ode to the contemporary spirit of Barcelona. Its clean and minimalist form represents the simplicity and effortless attitude of living on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nEach perfume box has a special message engraved on the inside that evokes the unique emotion of each fragrance."
