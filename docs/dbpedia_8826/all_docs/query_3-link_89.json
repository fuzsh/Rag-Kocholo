        "text": "Barcelona is one of the most visited destinations in Spain and Europe. Its detailed and unique architecture, vibrant atmosphere, and culture make it a bucket list city.\n\nIf you’re learning Spanish or simply want to know how to pronounce Barcelona correctly among Spaniards, in this guide, you’ll learn the correct pronunciation, the nicknames of Barcelona because the city is called other ways too, and some essential Catalan words to help you navigate through the city.\n\nThis post contains affiliate links, and as an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases.

This helps me keep the content up to date and make other improvements to the blog.\n\nBarcelona pronunciation guide\n\nFirstly, Barcelona isn’t the most difficult city to say in Spanish, so that’s a good start. You can’t compare the pronunciation of Barcelona with Valladolid and Badajoz pronunciations.\n\nIf you want to pronounce Barcelona as a Spaniard, you will attempt to make the “C” sound which can be similar to “the” in English. Therefore, you would say “Bar-the-lo-na”.\n\nHowever, Barcelona is pronounced differently in Catalan. If you want to say it as a Catalan person, you don’t need to attempt to make the “C” sound, which might be easier for you. The Catalan pronunciation would be “Bar-se-lo-na”. You’ll probably come across many Andalusians who say it the way Catalans say it.\n\nOn another note, it’s good to know that the letters B and V are used interchangeably by many Spaniards. The sound of both letters is so similar that it’s hard to tell the difference. This is why how you say the letter B shouldn’t concern you much.\n\nWhen it comes to spelling, it’s essential to know which Spanish words are written with B or V.\n\nCheck out this video for a pronunciation guide from a Spaniard:\n\nBarcelona pronunciation by Cristina Reina\n\nEtymology: what does Barcelona mean?\n\nAre you wondering what the word Barcelona means?\n\nWell, there are many theories behind the name Barcelona, but the truth is that none of these have been verified.\n\nSome sources suggest that the name of the city originated after Hamilcar Barca, a Carthaginian general who founded the city before the 3rd century B.C. At the same time, others believe that the name comes from an ancient coin inscription.\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, Barcelona was known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona.\n\nThe nicknames of Barcelona\n\nYou’ll be surprised to hear that Barcelona has a few names or nicknames.\n\nOne of the nicknames of Barcelona is Barca, and this is probably the most known name internationally because of football. Barcelona football club is colloquially called Barca.\n\nAnother variation of Barcelona is Barna, a common way to call the locals.\n\nLast but not least, BCN refers to Barcelona’s main airport (Barcelona-El Prat Airport), but other people use it as an abbreviation for Barcelona too.\n\n8 Essential words in Catalan\n\nCatalan, alongside Spanish, is the official language of Barcelona and the county of Catalonia. This language isn’t only spoken in Catalonia but also in the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands, Andorra, some parts of Southern France and Sicily.\n\nDuring your time in Barcelona, you’ll hear Catalan most time, with the exception of Spaniards from other parts of the country that are on a trip to Barcelona.\n\nIf you plan to visit or live in Barcelona, knowing some essential words in Catalan is a good idea.\n\nHere is a list of basic words you might want to use to impress the locals:\n\nHello – Hola\n\nGood morning – Bon dia\n\nGood afternoon – Bon tarda\n\nGood evening – Bona nit\n\nThank you – Gracies or merci\n\nPlease – Si us plau\n\nNice to meet you – Moit de gust\n\nBye – Adeu\n\nInteresting things to know about Catalan\n\n➢ The Catalan language has more similarities with Italian and French than with Spanish.\n\n➢ Catalan has several dialects: Alguerese, Balearic, Valencian and more.\n\n➢ Nearly 9 million people speak Catalan, and Spain is where the language prevails.\n\n➢ Catalan wasn’t always recognised as a language and was banned during the Spanish War and Franco’s dictatorship. Catalan officially became a language in 1979.\n\nFrequently asked questions about Barcelona pronunciation\n\nConclusion on how to pronounce Barcelona\n\nPronouncing Barcelona isn’t as difficult as pronouncing other cities in Spain, but if you remember to pronounce it as “Bar-the-lo-na” or “Bar-se-lo-na”, you won’t have any problems.\n\nDo you have any questions about Spanish?
