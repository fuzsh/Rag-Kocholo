        "text": "To those who are here because they‚Äôre coming to our 2024 wedding outside of Barcelona ‚Äî this is for you! ü§ç And to those who stumbled across it because they also want to know everything they need to know about Barcelona ‚Äî this is for you, too.\n\nWhatever your reason, I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre here. I‚Äôm going to try my best to introduce Barcelona and Spain for anyone who‚Äôs visiting for the first time.\n\nBasic Facts About Barcelona and Spain\n\nAll of Spain* is in the Central European Time zone (UTC/GMT+1) or Central European Summer Time zone (UTC/GMT+2) during Daylight Savings Time, aka most of the year. This means that Spain is 7 hours ahead of where I live, in Missouri.\n\n*The Canary Islands, which are part of Spain, are on a different time zone, one hour behind.\n\nSpain is part of the European Union and uses the euro (‚Ç¨) as its currency, like many other EU countries. In the early 2010s, the exchange rate between euros and USD wasn‚Äôt very good, but it‚Äôs a lot better now. With any currency, it‚Äôs tempting (but often dangerous) to think of it as a 1:1 exchange between the two, but in the case of euros to dollars, it won‚Äôt get you in too much trouble for small purchases.\n\nBarcelona is the second-largest city in Spain after Madrid, the country‚Äôs capital city, with a metro population of about 5 million people.\n\nSimilar to how the U.S. is divided into states, Spain is divided into 17 ‚Äúautonomous regions.‚Äù Barcelona is located in the autonomous region of Catalonia, and it‚Äôs also Catalonia‚Äôs capital. However, Catalonia‚Äôs relationship with Spain is one that has been complicated for more than 300 years.\n\nHistorical/Political Context of Barcelona and Catalonia\n\nWhen you‚Äôre a tourist, it‚Äôs always a good idea to have a basic understanding of the historical, social, and political factors at play in the place you‚Äôre visiting. I feel like it helps you to broaden your horizons and experience a place more fully when you have context for what‚Äôs going on around you. So let me do my best to explain a little bit about what‚Äôs going on in Barcelona and Catalonia as a whole.\n\nTo make a long story short(er) ‚Äî Catalonia has long wanted independence from Spain, to become its own country. In the past, Catalonia was an independent state. And not only do they have their own culture and history, they also speak their own language ‚Äî Catalan. While Catalonians also speak perfect Spanish, in the company of their local friends and family, they much prefer to speak Catalan. And when you‚Äôre out and about in Barcelona or Catalonia, you‚Äôll likely see signs in Catalan first, then Spanish.\n\nOne major development in the last few years was a Catalan independence referendum, held on October 1, 2017. The vote for independence passed with 92% approval, but the Spanish central government had declared the referendum was ‚Äúunconstitutional‚Äù several weeks before it took place. As the vote went ahead, there were countless videos of police brutality inflicted on voters at the polls, as well as many reports of widespread voter suppression.\n\nAll this to say‚Ä¶ despite the vote, Catalonia has not become independent, even 6 years later. However, when you visit Barcelona, you will likely see several symbols in support of Catalan independence. The Estalada flag shows support for the Catalan independence movement, and the yellow ribbon shows support for the movement‚Äôs political prisoners.\n\nHow Much Time Do You Need in Barcelona?\n\nBarcelona has so much to see and do! For that reason, I‚Äôd say you need a minimum of three days in order to make the most of your time there.\n\nKeep in mind that many flights from the U.S., for example, arrive early in the morning around 7 or 8 a.m. local time. Which, if you‚Äôre accustomed to a U.S. time zone, is anywhere from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. In other words, you‚Äôre most likely going to be exhausted the first day you‚Äôre there, even if you grab a couple of hours of sleep on the overnight flight. So in that case, you might want four days.\n\nHow To Get From Barcelona Airport to the City\n\nBarcelona has a great public transportation system that is fairly easy to navigate, even if you‚Äôve never been there before. The metro (subway) even goes directly to and from the airport. Be sure to download the app ‚ÄúCitymapper‚Äù to help you plan your journeys. It‚Äôs one of my favorite apps ever.\n\nWhen arriving in Barcelona, follow the signs for the metro (the symbol is an M in a diamond). Once you‚Äôre there, you‚Äôll need to buy a metro ticket from one of the machines ‚Äî it‚Äôs ‚Ç¨5 for trips to/from the airport.\n\nAnother newer option is to take the airport bus, or Aerob√∫s shuttle, from the airport to the city. When we used it in October 2023, it was about ‚Ç¨6 per person and took us to Barcelona‚Äôs city center in just over half an hour. There‚Äôs no need to buy a ticket in advance, as you can pay with credit card or tap-to-pay when boarding. Even if the bus doesn‚Äôt get you exactly where you need to go, you‚Äôll likely be near a metro station where you can buy a ticket to continue your journey.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt want to deal with the metro or a bus, you could also take a taxi. It‚Äôs probably best to pre-book a service, which I‚Äôve done a few times in other cities, and then you get someone standing in arrivals with a little iPad with your name waiting for you.\n\nUber is also an option, but I don‚Äôt really recommend it. The last time we tried to use it in Barcelona was around Christmas, and it was kind of weird. Like, if you requested a ride, you had to wait 15-30 minutes before it would actually make the request to a driver. I‚Äôm pretty sure it has to do with the ongoing legal battles between Uber and the government.\n\nSo, if you‚Äôre planning to use Uber, don‚Äôt forget to request it at least 15 minutes before you‚Äôre ready to be picked up.\n\nThings To Do in Barcelona\n\nBarcelona is a super vibrant city with lots to do ‚Äî especially when it comes to art and culture.\n\nThe number one thing you need to do in Barcelona is visit the iconic Sagrada Famil√≠a church. I‚Äôve probably been to 100 churches around Europe, and this is by far the most impressive and the most unique! While it‚Äôs stunning enough from the outside, the inside is guaranteed to take your breath away. (Don‚Äôt look at too many pictures before you go, so you can be surprised.)\n\nThe Sagrada Famil√≠a has been under construction since 1882, and it‚Äôs finally scheduled to be completed in 2026 ‚Äî to mark the 100-year anniversary of its famed architect, Antoni Gaud√≠, who is buried in the basilica‚Äôs crypt.\n\nYou can book your tickets through Sagrada Famil√≠a‚Äôs website, or you can choose a guided tour. Whatever you decide, make sure to buy your tickets in advance so you don‚Äôt have to wait in line or risk it selling out.\n\nGaud√≠‚Äôs architectural masterpieces are all over Barcelona, and I recommend doing as many of them as you can! Parc G√ºell is another can‚Äôt-miss sight, and it‚Äôs one of the most photogenic spots in the whole city. While it can get pretty crowded, especially in the summer, getting there early in the morning can help quell some of the crowds. Buying tickets in advance for Parc G√ºell is key, too.\n\nWhen walking along the Passeig de Gr√†cia, Barcelona‚Äôs most famous shopping street, you‚Äôll likely come across Casa Battl√≥ and La Pedrera ‚Äì Casa Mil√†, two more Gaud√≠ creations. Casa Battl√≥ is like a fun house, as you take a audio-guided tour with a tablet that allows you to learn the history of the house, while using virtual reality to help you understand Gaud√≠‚Äôs designs. And I‚Äôve actually never been on the inside of La Pedrera, so let me know if you check it out, and what it‚Äôs like!\n\nBesides all the Gaud√≠ stuff, Barcelona has even more to do. The Gothic Quarter is one of my favorite places to wander, with its tiny shops and narrow streets where you never know what‚Äôs going to be around the corner. Nearby, you‚Äôll find the Barcelona Cathedral, which is much more traditional than the Sagrada Famil√≠a but still pretty, both inside and outside.\n\nAnd with Barcelona‚Äôs location on the Mediterranean Sea, you could go to the beach! Barceloneta Beach is the one I‚Äôm most familiar with, but there are plenty of great beaches all along the coast.\n\nI could probably spend forever talking about things to do in Barcelona, so here are a few more things you can check out if you‚Äôve got space in your itinerary:\n\nMercado de La Boqueria\n\nPicasso Museum\n\nCamp Nou (home of FC Barcelona)\n\nPla√ßa d‚ÄôEspanya\n\nParc de la Ciutadella\n\nFind more things to do in Barcelona.\n\nWhere To Stay in Barcelona\n\nBarcelona has plenty of hotels and Airbnbs, so you‚Äôre sure to find something that meets your needs and budget. (You‚Äôll probably be surprised how inexpensive it will be!)\n\nIdeally, you‚Äôll want to stay somewhere fairly central that will help you get to the things you want to do, and the places you want to go, without too much time spent commuting. Here are some of the best neighborhoods for tourist stuff:\n\nLa Barceloneta\n\nEl Born\n\nEixample\n\nGothic Quarter\n\nEl Raval\n\nHonestly, you can stay anywhere, especially if you‚Äôre not too far from a metro stop.\n\nFood & Drink in Barcelona\n\nMealtimes in Spain and Barcelona are a lot different from what most Americans are used to. Lunch is usually between 1-3 p.m., and dinner isn‚Äôt until 9 p.m. or later. Here are some of my best tips about food and drink in Spain and Barcelona:\n\nTypical Spanish breakfasts\n\nMy favorite typical Spanish breakfast to tell people about is called pan con tomate ‚Äî bread with tomato ‚Äî and you can find it all over Spain. It‚Äôs basically some toast with some sort of fresh tomato puree, which varies based on where you are in the country, along with some olive oil and salt.\n\nI don‚Äôt like tomatoes, so I always order pan con mantequilla y mermelada ‚Äî bread with butter and jam, usually peach or strawberry.\n\nAdd a caf√© con leche, which is espresso with scalded milk, and your total breakfast price for one person is probably about ‚Ç¨3 or less. You also need to make sure you try some fresh zumo de naranja, orange juice, at some point. Cafes usually have a big machine where they squeeze it right in front of you!\n\nThe best meal deals\n\nDuring the work week, you‚Äôll probably see chalkboards outside of restaurants that say ‚ÄúMenu del D√≠a,‚Äù listing a set menu for a certain price, usually between ‚Ç¨8-14. For that price, you typically get to choose a starter, a main dish, a drink (beer or wine), and a dessert or coffee. Sometimes your drink of choice ends up being a whole bottle of wine instead of a glass ‚Äî it just depends on if you end up in a little family run place (full bottle: likely) or if you‚Äôre at a more tourist-centric place (full bottle: unlikely).\n\nFor dessert, be sure to try Crema Catalana at least once! It‚Äôs like a Catalan version of cr√®me brulee, and it is goooood.\n\nMy food recommendations\n\nHere are some of my favorite Spanish foods you should try. A lot of these are tapas btw.\n\nPatatas bravas: Potato wedges with tomato sauce. (They kinda sound like French fries, and they‚Äôre kinda not French fries?) Or, patatas bravas con alioli, which is like a garlic aioli.\n\nCroquetas: Croquettes filled with ham, cheese, etc.\n\nPaella: Obviously, paella! You can typically get it as a starter item on menus del d√≠a on Thursdays.\n\nPimientos de padr√≥n: Little shriveled, salty green peppers\n\nQueso de cabra: Literally anything with goat cheese is amazing. Especially if it comes with honey, balsamic, or some other type of tasty drizzle.\n\nTostadas de anchoa: Matt wanted me to add this one. It‚Äôs little toasts with anchovies on them. I think they‚Äôre decent, he loves them.\n\nChurros: Spanish churros aren‚Äôt sweet like Mexican churros ‚Äî they‚Äôre essentially just fried dough. But they‚Äôre still tasty, especially if you order them with chocolate!\n\nA secret about Sangria\n\nIf you like sangria, do not order it in Spain!\n\nInstead, order ‚Äútinto de verano,‚Äù which basically means ‚Äúsummer wine.‚Äù\n\nIt‚Äôs pretty much the exact same thing as sangria, meaning it‚Äôs red wine with fizzy lemonade and maybe even some orange or lemon slices. But instead of getting charged ‚Ç¨5-6 for it, you‚Äôll pay ‚Ç¨2-3. You‚Äôre welcome. üôÇ\n\nA few last things you really need to know about eating out in Spain\n\nGoing out to eat in Spain is much different from going out to eat in the U.S.\n\nFirst, waiters are not attentive. They don‚Äôt have to be‚Ä¶ because they‚Äôre not living off your tips. Yes, that‚Äôs one awesome thing about restaurants in Spain ‚Äî you don‚Äôt have to tip. Ever! But because of that, you have to expect a different level of service.\n\nWaiters are not going to come check on you every two minutes. They‚Äôre also not trying to turn your table over the second you get your food. They‚Äôre getting paid the same no matter how long you stay. Which means, when you‚Äôre ready to leave, you need to flag them down and ask for the check by saying ‚Äúla cuenta, por favor.‚Äù Please go into every interaction with your waiter knowing this, and don‚Äôt be upset by slow or non-existent service. It‚Äôs just different here!\n\nThe other great monetary advantage about going out to eat in Spain is that the tax is already included on the prices you see on the menu. So if you and your companion each order a menu del d√≠a, and each one is ‚Ç¨10, your check at the end of the meal will be ‚Ç¨20.\n\nPublic Transport in Barcelona\n\nThe metro will likely take you to most of the things you‚Äôll want to do. For exploring the city, I recommend buying a ticket called ‚ÄúT-casual‚Äù from one of the machines in the metro stations. This is good for 10 trips and only costs about ‚Ç¨11, and it works for both the metro and the bus. (Don‚Äôt be afraid of taking the bus! Citymapper will also help with that, as well as give you transit maps for the city.)\n\nMobile/tap-to-pay payment typically works on the bus, but it‚Äôs a good idea to either have cash if you end up outside the Barcelona ‚Äúproper‚Äù city limits, where buses aren‚Äôt equipped for digital payment. For the metro, you‚Äôll always need to buy a ticket (either a single or the T-casual) at one of the machines, but you can use a credit card.\n\nSafety in Barcelona\n\nAs with any tourist destination, you‚Äôll want to keep an eye on your belongings and watch out for pickpockets. Especially in crowded areas like Las Ramblas. Try your best not to *act* like a tourist ‚Äî everyone will probably know you are one, but don‚Äôt be obnoxious and you won‚Äôt make yourself an easy target.\n\nThere‚Äôs no need to carry your passport around with you on a daily basis, so don‚Äôt keep it with you. Keep it somewhere safe in your hotel or Airbnb. Also, you don‚Äôt really need to carry a lot of cash with you either! Having a bit of cash on you is usually a good idea in case you find yourself somewhere that doesn‚Äôt accept credit cards ‚Äî but that‚Äôs really rare. Recently, I haven‚Äôt even been carrying my wallet with me, because in Spain‚Äôs big cities, almost everywhere has Apple Pay/Google Pay, so we only need our phones. (Unless you‚Äôre taking the bus and are outside Barcelona proper.)\n\nBesides petty crime, you‚Äôre going to be pretty safe in Barcelona. (Safer than any school, grocery store, or movie theater in the U.S., I daresay.) The only other thing you might need to watch out for would be protests, which are somewhat common and usually not violent, but as a rule of thumb it‚Äôs best not to get involved.\n\nA few more random tips that didn‚Äôt fit anywhere else\n\nMoney:\n\nTake out a bit of cash at the airport when you arrive, but not more than ‚Ç¨100 because I really don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll need to use that much cash. Also, use the ATMs instead of the currency exchange desk.\n\nDefinitely set up Apple Pay or Google Pay on your phone if you haven‚Äôt already.\n\nPay with your credit card as much as you can, especially if you can earn points! (Be sure your card doesn‚Äôt have foreign transaction fees.) If the screen ever asks you whether you want to pay in euros or dollars, choose euros. You‚Äôll get a better exchange rate.\n\nIf you‚Äôre not sure whether a place accepts cards, just ask ‚Äútarjeta?‚Äù (Tar-hey-ta?) Cash is ‚Äúefectivo.‚Äù (Eh-fect-ee-vo)\n\nFood & drink:\n\nYou can drink the tap water in Spain, though it doesn‚Äôt always taste good. Barcelona‚Äôs is pretty decent.\n\nIf you order water at a restaurant, they will bring you a bottle that you have to pay for. If you just want free tap water, ask for ‚Äúagua de grifo‚Äù (agua de gree-fo).\n\nWhen you go to a restaurant, you typically seat yourself and wait for a waiter to come attend you.\n\nDomestic stuff:\n\nIf you‚Äôre staying in an Airbnb with a washing machine, it‚Äôs probably not going to have a dryer. They‚Äôre not very common in Spain. Instead, you‚Äôll have to hang dry your clothes.\n\nSome Airbnbs or homestays won‚Äôt have air conditioning, so if that‚Äôs important to you, be sure to add that as a search filter.\n\nIf you use your hairdryers or straighteners from the U.S., they might get fried. That‚Äôs because the U.S. uses 120 volt power, and Spain uses 230 volts. Look for dual-voltage travel versions of those electronics you can‚Äôt live without.\n\nThings like your phone charger and computer should be fine, though.\n\nYou‚Äôll need some outlet converters. Spain uses socket Type C, like much of Europe.\n\nI hope this gives you a great start for your Barcelona trip!
