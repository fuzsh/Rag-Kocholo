Former Top Gear presenter Beki Adam is to stand as an MP at the next election.

Adam is to challenge the Conservatives' Mid Sussex MP Sir Nicholas Soames as an independent parliamentary candidate, The Argus reports.

The 48-year-old appeared on Top Gear between 1988 and 1990.

In an eventful career, Adam went from presenting the show to leading a drug legalisation protest by selling cannabis cakes from a Brighton coffee shop in 1992, to becoming a Buddhist monk in the late '90s.

She will also compete with Labour candidate Greg Mountain, UKIP's Tony Brothers, Green Miranda Diboll and Liberal Democrat Daisy Cooper for the seat.

Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson recently criticised a Liverpool newspaper after it published an article condemning him for comments he made about the city.
