        "text": "Terms and Conditions of Sale\n\nThe buyer’s premium is subject to all lots in this auction, being 18%+GST (19.8% total), as outlined in Section 5A below.\n\nThe terms and conditions of sale listed here contain the policies of Donington Auctions Pty Ltd (referred to as Donington). They are the terms on which Donington and the Seller contract with the Buyer. They may be amended by printed Saleroom Notices or oral announcements made before and during the sale. By bidding at auction you agree to be bound by these terms.\n\n1. Background to the Terms used in these Conditions\n\nThe conditions that are listed below contain terms that are used regularly and may need explanation. They are as follows:\n\n“the Buyer” means the person with the highest bid accepted by the Auctioneer\n\n“the Lot” means any item depicted within the sale for auction and in particular the item or items described against any lot number in the catalogue.\n\n“the Hammer price” means the amount of the highest bid accepted by the auctioneer in relation to a lot\n\n“the Buyers Premium” means the charge payable by the Buyer to the auction house as a percentage of the hammer price.\n\n“the Reserve” means the lowest amount at which Donington has agreed with the Seller that the lot can be sold.\n\n“Forgery” means an item constituting an imitation originally conceived and executed as a whole, with a fraudulent intention to deceive as to authorship, origin, age, period, culture or source, where the correct description as to such matters is not reflected by the description in the catalogue. Accordingly no lot shall be capable of being a forgery by reason of any damage or restoration work of any kind (Including re-painting).\n\n“the insured value” means the amount that Donington in its absolute discretion from time to time shall consider the value for which a lot should be covered for insurance (whether or not insurance is arranged by Donington.)\n\nAll values expressed in Donington Auctions Pty Ltd catalogues (in any format) are in Australian Dollars (AU$). All bids, “hammer price”, “reserves”, “Buyers Premium” and other expressions of value are understood by all parties to be in Australian Dollars (AU$) unless otherwise specified.\n\n2. Donington Auctions as Agent\n\nExcept as otherwise stated Donington Auctions Pty Ltd acts as agent for the Seller. The contract for the sale of the property is therefore made between the Seller and the Buyer.\n\n3. Before the Sale\n\nA) EXAMINATION OF PROPERTY\n\nProspective Buyers are strongly advised to examine in person any property in which they are interested before the Auction takes place. Neither Donington nor the Seller provides any guarantee in relation to the nature of the property apart from the Limited warranty in the paragraph below. The property is otherwise sold “AS IS”\n\nB) CATALOGUE AND OTHER DESCRIPTIONS\n\nAll statements by Donington in the catalogue entry for the property or in the condition report, or made orally or in writing elsewhere, are statements of opinion and are not to be relied upon as statements of fact. Such statements do not constitute a representation, warranty or assumption of liability by Donington of any kind. References in the catalogue entry to the condition report to damage or restoration are for guidance only and should be evaluated by personal inspection by the bidder or a knowledgeable representative. The absence of such a reference does not imply that an item is free from defects or restoration, nor does a reference to particular defects imply the absence of any others. Estimates of the selling price should not be relied on as a statement that this is the price at which the item will sell or it’s value for any other purpose. Neither Donington nor The Seller is responsible for any errors or omissions in the catalogue or any supplemental material.\n\nImages are measured height by width (sight size). Illustrations are provided only as a guide and should not be relied upon as a true representation of colour or condition. Images are not shown at a standard scale. Mention is rarely made of frames (which may be provided as supplementary images on the website) which do not form part of the lot as described in the printed catalogue.\n\nAn item bought “on Extension” must be paid for in full before it will be released to the purchaser or his/her agreed expertising committee or specialist. Payments received for such items will be held “in trust” for up to 90 days or earlier, if the issue of authenticity has been resolved more quickly. Extensions must be requested before the auction.\n\nForeign buyers should note that all transactions are in Australian dollars so there may be a small exchange rate risk. The costs associated with acquiring a good certificate will be carried by the purchaser. If the item turns out to be forged or otherwise incorrectly described, all reasonable costs will be borne by the vendor.\n\nC) BUYERS RESPONSIBILITY\n\nAll property is sold “as is” without representation or warranty of any kind by Donington or the Seller. Buyers are responsible for satisfying themselves concerning the condition of the property and the matters referred to in the catalogue by requesting a condition report No lot to be rejected if, subsequent to the sale, it has been immersed in liquid or treated by any other process unless the Auctioneer’s permission to subject the lot to such immersion or treatment has first been obtained in writing.\n\nD) MOTOR CARS & MOTORCYCLES\n\nUsed motor cars bought at public auction are NOT covered by a Statutory Warranty under section 54 of the Motor Car Trader Act 1986. This is also applicable for motorcycles and commercial vehicles. The trader, Donington Auctions Pty Ltd, has no duty under the Motor Car Trader Act 1986 to repair or make good any defects after delivery. There is NO cooling off period offered for motor cars or motorcycles bought at public auction.\n\nIf the used car is being sold registered and is no more than 10 years old and has been driven less than 160,000 km, it is automatically covered by the Statutory Warranty under section 54 of the Motor Car Trader Act 1986 for the first 3 months or 5,000 km after delivery, whichever occurs first.\n\nRoadworthy certificates will be supplied only if the used car or motorcycles is being sold currently registered. If the vehicle is being sold unregistered then NO Roadworthy will be provided. Each vehicle offered by Donington at auction will mention in the lot description which is applicable.\n\nBuyers are specifically warned that any vehicle sold may well have parts replaced and paint renewed or be made up of parts from other vehicles the condition of which may be difficult to establish. Donington has to rely on information as to date, condition and authenticity provided by the seller, and cannot undertake a level of inspection of the vehicle to establish whether or not the vehicle corresponds to any relative description of condition in the catalogue. It is the responsibility of the Buyer to carry out such inspections as the Buyer thinks necessary.\n\n4. At the Sale\n\nA) REFUSAL OF ADMISSION\n\nDonington reserves the right at our complete discretion to refuse admission to the auction premises or participation in any auction and to reject any bid.\n\nB) REGISTRATION BEFORE BIDDING\n\nAny prospective new buyer must complete and sign a registration form and provide photo-identification before bidding. Donington may request bank, trade or other financial references to substantiate this registration.\n\nC) BIDDING AS A PRINCIPAL\n\nWhen making a bid, a bidder is accepting personal liability to pay the purchase price including the buyers premium and all applicable taxes, plus all other applicable charges, unless it has been explicitly agreed in writing with Donington before the commencement of the sale that the bidder is acting as agent on behalf of an identified third party acceptable to Donington and that Donington will only look to the principal for payment.\n\nD) INTERNATIONAL REGISTRATIONS\n\nAll International clients not known to Donington will be required to scan or fax through an accredited form of photo identification and pay a deposit at our discretion in cleared funds into Donington’s account at least 24 hours before the commencement of the auction. Bids will not be accepted without this deposit. Donington also reserves the right to request any additional forms of identification prior to registering an overseas bid. This deposit can be made using a credit card, however the balance of any purchase price in excess of $5,000 can not be charged to this card without prior arrangement. This deposit is redeemable against any auction purchase.\n\nE) ABSENTEE BIDS\n\nDonington will use reasonable efforts to execute written bids delivered to us AT LEAST 24 Hours before the sale for the convenience of those clients who are unable to attend the auction in person. If we receive identical written bids on a particular lot, and at the auction these are the highest bids on that lot, then the lot will be sold to the person whose written bid was received and accepted first. Execution of written bids is a free service undertaken subject to other commitments at the time of the sale and we do not accept liability for failing to execute a written bid or for errors or omissions which may arise. It is the bidder’s responsibility to check with Terms and Conditions of Sale Donington after the auction if they were successful. Unlimited or “Buy” bids will not be accepted.\n\nF) TELEPHONE BIDS\n\nPriority will be given to overseas and interstate bidders. Please refer to the catalogue for the Telephone Bids form. Arrangements for this service must be confirmed AT LEAST 24 HOURS PRIOR to the auction commencing. Donington accepts no responsibility whatsoever for any errors or failure to execute bids.

When bidding online the buyer agrees to be bound by all terms and conditions listed here by Donington. Donington accepts no responsibility for any errors, failure to execute bids or any other miscommunications regarding this process. It is the online bidder’s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of the relevant information regarding bids, lot numbers and contact details.\n\nH) RESERVES\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all lots are offered subject to a reserve, which is the confidential minimum price below which the Lot will not be sold. The reserve will not exceed the low estimate printed in the catalogue. The auctioneer may open the bidding on any Lot below the reserve by placing a bid on behalf of the Seller. The auctioneer may continue to bid on behalf of seller up to the amount of the reserve, either by placing consecutive bids or by placing bids in response to other bidders.\n\nI) AUCTIONEERS DISCRETION\n\nThe Auctioneer has the right at his absolute and sole discretion to refuse any bid, to advance the bidding in such a manner as he may decide, to withdraw or divide any lot, to combine any two or more lots and, in the case or error or dispute and whether during or after the sale, to determine the successful bidder, to continue the bidding, to cancel the sale or to reoffer and resell the item in dispute. If any dispute arises after the sale, then Donington’s sale record is conclusive.\n\nJ) SUCCESSFUL BID AND PASSING OF RISK\n\nSubject to the auctioneer’s discretion, the highest bidder accepted by the auctioneer will be the buyer and the striking of his hammer marks the acceptance of the highest bid and the conclusion of a contract for sale between the Seller and the Buyer. Risk and responsibility for the lot (including frames or glass where relevant) passes immediately to the Buyer.\n\nK) INDICATIVE BIDDING STEPS, ETC.\n\nDonington reserves the right to refuse any bid, withdraw any lot from sale, to place a reserve on any lot and to advance the bidding according to the following:\n\nIncrement Amount\n\nDollar Range\n\n$20\n\n$0–$500\n\n$50\n\n$500–$1,000\n\n$100\n\n$1,000–$2,000\n\n$200\n\n$2,000–$5,000\n\n$500\n\n$5,000–$10,000\n\n$1,000\n\n$10,000–$20,000\n\n$2,000\n\n$20,000–$50,000\n\n$5,000\n\n$50,000–$100,000\n\n$10,000\n\n$100,000–$200,000\n\n$20,000\n\n$200,000–$500,000\n\n$50,000\n\n500,000–$1,000,000\n\nAbsentee bids must follow these increments and any bids that don’t follow the steps will be rounded up to the nearest acceptable bid.\n\n5.

Extent of Donington Auctions Liability\n\nDonington agrees to refund the purchase price in the circumstances of the Limited Warranty set out in paragraph 7 below. Apart from that, neither the Seller nor we, nor any of our employees or agents are responsible for the correctness of any statement of whatever kind concerning any lot, whether written or oral, nor for any other errors or omissions in description or for any faults or defects in any lots. Except as stated in paragraph 7 below, neither the Seller ourselves, our officers, agents or employees give any representation warranty or guarantee or assume any liability of any kind in respect of any lot with regard to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, description, size, quality, condition, attribution, authenticity, rarity, importance, medium, provenance, exhibition history, literature or historical relevance. Except as required by local law any warranty of any kind is excluded by this paragraph.\n\n7. Limited Warranty\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this paragraph, the Seller warrants for the period of thirty days from the date of the sale that any property described in this catalogue (noting such description may be amended by any saleroom notice or announcement) which is stated without qualification to be the work of a named author or authorship is authentic and not a forgery. The term “Author” or “authorship” refers to the creator of the property or to the period, culture, source, or origin as the case may be, with which the creation of such property is identified in the catalogue.\n\nThe warranty is subject to the following:\n\nit does not apply where a) the catalogue description or saleroom notice corresponded to the generally accepted opinion of scholars and experts at the date of the sale or fairly indicated that there was a conflict of opinions, or b) correct identification of a lot can be demonstrated only by means of a scientific process not generally accepted for use until after publication of the catalogue or a process which at the date of the publication of the catalogue was unreasonably expensive or impractical or likely to have caused damage to the property.\n\nthe benefits of the warranty are not assignable and shall apply only to the original buyer of the lot as shown on the invoice originally issued by Donington when the lot was sold at Auction.\n\nthe Original Buyer must have remained the owner of the lot without disposing of any interest in it to any third party\n\nThe Buyer’s sole and exclusive remedy against the Seller in place of any other remedy which might be available, is the cancellation of the sale and the refund of the original purchase price paid for the lot less the buyers premium which is non refundable.

Severability\n\nIf any part of these Conditions of Sale is found by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, that part shall be discounted and the rest of the Conditions shall continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\n9. Copyright\n\nThe copyright of all images, illustrations and written material produced by Donington relating to a lot including the contents of this catalogue, is and shall remain the property at all times of Donington and shall not be used by the Buyer, nor by anyone else without our prior written consent. Donington and the Seller make no representation or warranty that the Buyer of a property will acquire any copyright or other reproduction rights in it.\n\n10. Law and Jurisdiction\n\nThese terms and conditions and any matters concerned with the foregoing fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the state in which the auction is held.\n\n11. Pre-Sale Estimates\n\nDonington publishes with each catalogue our opinion as to the estimated price range for each lot. These estimates are approximate prices only and are not intended to be definitive. They are prepared well in advance of the sale and may be subject to revision. Interested parties should contact Donington prior to auction for updated pre-sale estimates and starting prices.\n\n12. Sale results\n\nDonington will provide auction results, which will be available as soon as possible after the sale. Results will include buyer’s premium. These results will be posted at www.doningtonauctions.com.au\n\n3. Goods and Service Tax\n\nIn accordance with A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 Donington Auctions will collect on behalf of the Australian tax office (ATO) a Goods and Service Tax (GST) of 10% on all applicable transactions.\n\nGST is applicable on the hammer price in the case where the seller is selling property that is owned by an entity registered for GST. GST is also applicable on the hammer price in the case where the seller is not an Australian resident. These lots are denoted by a dagger symbol † placed next to the estimate.\n\nGST is also applicable on the buyer’s premium.\n\nOverseas buyers and buyers non-resident in Australia will not be charged GST on both hammer price and premiums under the following conditions:\n\n1. The items are exported through a Donington approved freight company including Australia Post\n\n2. The items are exported within 60 days of the date of the sale.\n\nThe invoice supplied by Donington for purchases will be regarded as a Tax invoice for GST purposes.\n\n14. Resale Royalty Scheme\n\nUnder the legal obligations of the Resale Royalty Scheme for Visual Artists Act 2009, sellers must provide the following information to comply with the act:\n\n• was the artwork acquired after 8 June 2010?\n\n• is the sale/reserve price (including GST) $1,000 or more?\n\n• is the artist from Australia or a country listed in the Regulations to the Act?\n\n• is the artist alive, or deceased less than 70 years?\n\nThe seller:\n\nacknowledges that he or she understands his or her legal obligations under the Resale Royalty for Visual Artists Act 2009 (the Act);\n\nundertakes to comply with all requirements of the Act, including by providing its agent, the company, with accurate information sufficient for compliance with sections 28 and 29 of the Act;\n\nundertakes to indemnify the company for any loss incurred by the company as a result of the vendor’s failure to comply with any of the vendor’s legal obligations under the Act; and\n\nacknowledges that if he or she fails to comply with any of his or her legal obligations under the Act, the company may provide the vendor’s name and contact details to Copyright Agency Limited (CAL).\n\nLots subject to payment of the Resale Royalty Scheme will be denoted by the §. The Australian Resale Royalty is a flat rate of 5% on the hammer price (including GST). The Australian Resale Royalty is payable by the buyer in addition to the buyer’s premium plus any applicable GST.\n\n15. Jewels & Watches\n\nGEMSTONES\n\nGemstones have historically been subjected to a variety of treatments to enhance their appearance. Sapphire and rubies are routinely heat treated to improve their colour and clarity, similarly emeralds are frequently treated with oils or resin for the same purpose.\n\nOther treatments such as staining or dyeing, irradiation, filling or coating may have been used on other precious and semi-precious gemstones and organic material. These treatments may be permanent, whilst others may need special care to preserve their appearance. Buyers should assume that each lot has been subject to some form of treatment and that the estimates reflect this.\n\nA number of laboratories issue certificates that give detailed descriptions of gemstones, and in the event that Donington has been supplied with or obtained certificates for any lot, this shall be noted in the catalogue. However, as there may not be consensus between different laboratories on the degree, or types of treatment of the gemstones, Donington supplies these without warranty. Buyers should assume that all gemstones sold by Donington may have been subjected to such treatments, and that the catalogue estimates reflect this.\n\nPEARLS\n\nPearls, like gemstones, are also subject to various treatments. Buyers should assume that any pearls sold by Donington may have been subjected to such treatments, and that the catalogue estimates reflect this.\n\nWATCHES\n\nPlease note: All watches sold by Donington are sold on an “as is” basis. Donington makes no representation or warranty that any watch is in working order. Many watches have been repaired over their lifetime and may contain non-original parts. The absence of any reference to the condition of a watch does not imply that the lot is in good condition and without defects, repairs or restorations. Buyers should be aware that a general service, change of battery or further repair work, for which the Buyer is solely responsible for, may be necessary.\n\nESTIMATED WEIGHTS\n\nIf a stone has a known weight, it has been weighed out of the mount. If a stone has an estimated weight, it is an approximate weight only and has been measured by us in the mount and is a statement of opinion only. The information is given as a guide only and Buyers should satisfy themselves with regard to this information as to its accuracy."
