        "text": "Adam Torres (born Gracie) (1996-2013) was a Senior (Grade 12) at Degrassi Community School. He was a transgender boy. He was the son of Audra Torres and Omar Torres. He and his brother Drew Torres transferred to Degrassi due to the excessive bullying Adam endured at his old school for being transgender. After being outed by Bianca DeSousa, he is again the victim of transphobia, although he eventually earns respect and admiration from his classmates. As a trans man, finding love is difficult for Adam. After many attempts at romance, he finds love with Becky Baker, despite their opposing beliefs. During summer break, Adam is involved in a car accident after texting Becky while driving and later passes away during surgery.\n\nAdam was known for his wit, kindness, honesty, humour, and his fierce loyalty to his friends. He was best friends with Eli Goldsworthy and Clare Edwards, as well as Dave Turner and his brother Drew, and good friends with Bianca DeSousa and Connor DeLaurier. Additional friends of his were Imogen Moreno, Mike Dallas, Jenna Middleton, Katie Matlin, Zig Novak, Alli Bhandari, and Maya Matlin. Adam formerly dated Fiona Coyne and Missy Parker, and Becky. He had conflicts with Mark Fitzgerald and Luke Baker. Adam was a member of the band WhisperHug. He was labelled as \"Sensitive Emo Guy\" in Season 13A. He was portrayed by Jordan Todosey.\n\nCharacter History\n\nSeason 10\n\nIn I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself (1), Adam, a new sophomore at Degrassi, is first seen as one of the many contestants who are trying to win backstage passes to the Dead Hand concert by keeping one hand on a red truck. Being the only two left with their hands on the red truck, Adam and Eli come to the agreement that they can split the tickets, each getting half of the tickets. This sparks a friendship between them. After they get the tickets, Sav asks them both to help unload the truck, but Adam isn't able to hold a stereo system and drops it, busting the truck's tail light. Adam, looking afraid, looks at the tail light in horror. Later in the episode, Eli fixes the tail light, and Sav is grateful. Sav says, \"I can't believe you got it in there!\" with Adam responding, \"Hah, that's what my ex-girlfriend said.\" Eli then tells him that that is gross. Sav tries to see if the tail light works, and as it turns on Adam yells, \"Booyah!\" with Eli asking, \"Who are you?\" Adam looks down, sheepishly. Adam and Eli then tell Sav th\n\ney need a ride to the concert, and they should take Sav's dad's truck. Sav tells them that he will try and convince his dad. Now at The Dot, Adam and Eli are told by Sav that his dad said no, but that he will take the car to the concert anyway. In I Just Don't Know What To Do With Myself (2), Sav, Eli, and Adam gather near the J.T. Yorke Memorial to find ideas on how to keep Sav's parents busy while they're at the concert. He offers them two Bollywood show tickets as an apology. His mother tells his father that Sav is being \"sincere,\" and that he's honestly sorry and she does trust him. At first his father feels he is up to something, but accepts the tickets. When Sav goes out to pick up Eli and Adam, he seems unsure about going to the concert, thinking about what his mother said about how she really \"trusts\"\n\nhim. Both Adam and Eli admit that they'd never take a chance to steal their parents car to go to a concert. They are about to leave until they hear the band is going to do an encore. After the encore, Sav rushes to the car, bringing Bianca because she is too drunk to drive. While driving home, Eli mentions they won't be able to make it on time. At first, Sav says he's not going to speed, but does anyway since he only has twelve minutes. The police start following him, and pull him over. Officer Turner comes to the car and says that the car has been stolen. Sav returns home and gets a lecture from his father. The next day at school, Adam and Eli go up to him and Sav apologizes for ruining their night. Adam insists that they should all play music one day, and tells Sav that he should tell his dad that he just has an emergency student council meeting. Sav remarks that he should just stick with being truthful for awhile, and Eli and Adam agree. In the last scene, Adam tells Sav tha is him and Eli's hero.\n\nIn Try Honesty (1), Adam becomes a victim of Fitz's bullying after Eli confronts Fitz in the parking lot for breaking a skull piece off of the hood of his car. The reason why Adam becomes a target is because he stands by Eli's side and sticks up for his friend. Fitz asks, \"What the hell are you looking at?\" to which Adam responds, \"I'm trying to figure that out.\"\n\nLater after class is over in school, Fitz is picking on Adam once again. He shoves Adam against a locker, and nearly punches him in the face after Adam remarks to him that he stinks. However, Eli defends Adam and stops Fitz from punching him. Later in the episode, Adam is confused when Eli tells him he was hit with a low blow by Fitz, making Eli confused when he doesn't understand the reference. As a quick save, Adam says, \"Aw man... I hate it when that happens... hurts so bad.\" Eli looks confused, but keeps talking. He helps Eli pick out photographs of high profile criminals from an \"FBI Most Wanted\" database in order to forge Fitz a fake ID as a 'peace treaty,' so as to give Fitz the identity of a criminal. Eli comments on Adam's uncanny ability to compare the facial features of the criminals with those of Fitz, saying that he is really good at it, to which Adam nervously refutes, \"No, I'm not.\" Adam quickly changes the subject and picks the photograph for Fitz's fake ID.\n\nIn You Don't Know My Name (2), Adam is seen tutoring his stepbrother, Drew, and giving him girl advice. At first Adam is giving him essay advice, and in the end he is giving him advice on getting Alli. Adam helps Drew untie his football shoes, and in order to help his brother, he tells Alli to go meet Jenna in the photo booth, but it's really Drew inside.\n\nMy Body Is A Cage (1)'s main plot centres around Adam trying to navigate school life while not outing himself. He tells Eli that he thinks Bianca DeSousa is hot, to which Eli comments, \"Sure, in a scary SUV-hit-and-run-club-district kind of way.\"\n\nAdam tries to flirt with Bianca, which is interrupted when he suddenly rushes off to his locker to grab tampons, because he notices his period coming on. While trying to discreetly carry them off, he bumps into Clare and drops his tampons. To avoid suspicion from Owen and Fitz who walk by, he hands them to Clare (faking being disgusted), who pretends they are hers.\n\nBack home, he is in the bathroom, looking at himself in the mirror. He turns to the side to see if his breasts are getting bigger, revealing that he is an FTM; Female-to-Male Transgender. He wraps them in gauze and starts to put his shirt on when Drew knocks on the door. Drew jokes about how he didn't take as long when he was a girl, making Adam open the door. Drew asks whether or not Adam thinks Clare told anyone about the tampon situation, and he replies \"Maybe Eli,...\". Then Audra Torres, his mom, calls upstairs for the two to get ready, but she accidentally calls Adam \"she\". Adam yells \"Pronoun problems? Still mom?\" Audra apologizes and calls them down again. Adam looks in the mirror one last time and winks at himself as he leaves. Later Adam is walking by the outdoor lunch area where he hears Clare telling Eli about Adam having tampons the previous day.\n\nAdam walks over to the picnic table and explains how he was born in a girl's body, and how he's an FTM. Eli finds this extremely cool and jokes about whether or not this means he can \"rip one\" in front to him. Adam replies \"Eli, I'd be insulted if you didn't.\" The trio laughs and enjoy the rest of their lunch.\n\nAdam tries to flirt with Bianca a second time, which seems to work out well, until she makes physical contact with his chest. Bianca chases Adam and rips open his shirt to reveal a medical bandage around his chest, thus forcefully outing him to her. When Adam tries to use the men's restroom, Fitz and Owen follow him in and harass him, which ends with Adam being thrown against a glass door.\n\nWhen Drew sees what happened to Adam, he gets upset and tries to fight Fitz. Fitz beats up Drew, while Owen holds Adam back. Adam is last seen asking if Drew is okay.\n\nMy Body Is A Cage (2) starts with Drew, Adam, and Mrs. Torres sitting in the principal's office with Mr. Simpson, after the events of the last episode. Mrs. Torres demands that Adam be transferred to another school and rants on about how transgender students in high school get death threats and are assaulted. Mr. Simpson informs them that Fitz and Owen had been suspended, Adam would be forced to walk to class with a teacher, and Adam would need to use the handicap bathroom. Adam is being walked down the hall by a teacher and being gawked at. The teacher allows him to sit down with Clare and Eli, who seem to not have a problem with Adam being transgender. Adam informs Clare and Eli that his family has never really accepted him, and that he's going to have to change back to \"Gracie\" during his grandmother's visit. Adam arrives at remedial gym, where Bianca, the one who outed Adam, is telling about how she accidentally touched Adam's breasts to listeners. Adam approaches Bianca and asks her if she'll still be his dance partner. Bianca denies being a lesbian, and Adam says neither is he and that they both need partners, to which Bianca says that Adam needs therapy and threatens Adam, walking away. The gym teacher approaches Adam and asks him who his partner is. Adam lies and says that his ankle hurts and the teacher lets him sit out. Adam is then seen with his mother shopping. He picks out a plaid guys' shirt and asks if he can wear that to dinner, Mrs. Torres shakes her head and picks out a white girls' shirt. Adam says that he's thought about \"introducing Adam to Grams.\" Mrs. Torres responds that if that's the case, Adam shouldn't come to dinner. Mrs. Torres admits that she's scared Adam will start hurting himself again and Adam denies doing it in a long time. At dinner, Grams, Mrs. Torres, Mr. Torres, and Drew are all looking at the menu. Grams asks where \"Gracie\" is and Mrs. Torres lies and says that \"Gracie\" had other appointments. Adam suddenly appears, dressed as \"Gracie.\" Everyone, aside from the unknowing Grams, is shocked. Grams shows everybody pictures of young Drew and a young Adam as Gracie. \"Gracie\" announces that he has something to say, but Mrs. Torres begs \"Gracie\" not to say anything. Grams gives \"Gracie\" a questioning look and \"Gracie\" says that he's taking ballroom dancing class. Adam is sitting alone in his room, looking at his arm, which is covered in burn marks. Drew knocks on the door and asks to be let in.\n\nAdam ignores him and unwraps the bandages he used to hide his breasts. As Gracie, Adam appears at remedial gym class and Bianca makes a snide comment. The teacher sends her to the principal's office. After class, \"Gracie\" is sitting outside, lighting a hair clip with a lighter and burning himself when Clare walks by and sees what \"Gracie\" is doing. \"Gracie\" quickly throws the clip on the table and presses his hand against his newly acquired burn mark and the previous ones. \"Gracie\" says that if he's \"Gracie\", everything's easier. Clare comforts him and says that he doesn't have to be Gracie if it doesn't make him happy. \"Gracie\"\n\nsays that it makes everyone else happier, so he has to change. Clare tells \"Gracie\" that he doesn't need to change, everyone else does. Clare escorts Gracie, now deciding to go back to Adam, back inside. Adam, dressed as a guy, gets into his mother's car and asks what she sees: a boy or a girl. Mrs. Torres admits that she sees him as a girl. Adam begs for his mother to see him as her son, not her daughter. Adam is then seen lighting a bonfire with Eli and Clare when Drew, along with Mrs. and Mr. Torres, appear. Drew is carrying Gracie's clothes and they burn the shirt and pants. Mrs. Torres hands Adam a picture of a young Gracie holding a book, and Adam is reluctant to burn it, saying that it's still him.\n\nIn Still Fighting It (1), Clare is seen confiding in Adam that she likes Eli, and she suspects he feels the same about her, but they need to take the next step. Adam tells her he feels the same way. Eli interrupts them, with the play they are going to film, Romeo & Juliet. Adam is then seen walking in a park-like setting with Eli and Clare. Clare says she'll play Juliet, and asks Eli and Adam who'll play Romeo. Eli is quick to step up to the role, while Adam rolls his eyes, Eli then makes an excuse to cover up his need to play Romeo, to which Adam responds \"Yeah, what are you not the expert on?\" The would-be couple sit on the bench, discussing the play, while Adam sets up the video equipment. Eli and Clare have having a moment, when they agree a kiss could work for their video project, which Adam interrupts,with the line \"That's cute.\" After the kiss Eli and Clare share, Adam can be seen rolling his eyes, definitely feeling like a 'third wheel'. The next day in English, Clare is beaming, and happily tells Adam that she believes that her and Eli took that 'next step' they needed. When Eli begins giving Clare the cold shoulder, Adam asks Clare what she did, and even sniffs her. They both look at Eli, confused.\n\nIn Still Fighting It (2), Clare is seen talking to Adam how it is unacceptable that he missed there presentation day for there film project, even though he's been giving her the cold shoulder. Clare then asks to get Adam to investigate for her, which Adam complains about going from third wheel to go-between, although, he does give in. Adam is seen later, against lockers with Eli, reading comic books. Adam leads to conversation into Clare, asking the reasons for Eli distance. Adam tells him he should tell her about \"you know.\" Eli counters, saying, \"She doesn't need to know.\" Adam, over exaggerating, mentions \"she's dying\" which gets a cold look from Eli in return, and quickly rewords it to \"hurting really bad.\" Eli mentions some feelings for Clare, and how its better this way for her, Adam tries to convince him otherwise, but Eli seems to be done with the topic, and tells him to read his comic book. Later, Clare is talking to Adam by his locker, saying after the project, she can try and move on. Adam tries to convince her to give Eli time, knowing Eli's true feelings. This intrigues Clare, figuring out Adam did some investigating after all. Adam doesn't tell her much, so Clare asks him for Eli's address, Adam refuses at first, until Clare takes his Goon comic hostage, and Adam caves. Adam is then seen with Clare and Eli when showing there real film project to Ms. Dawes . He interrupts the conversation, noticing there speaking again, but, as soon as things get personal between Eli and Clare, and awkward for Adam, he exits the room. In Purple Pills (1), Adam makes plans with Eli at The Dot, to hang out after school. He tells Eli that he ordered a pay per view movie, and Eli jokes around saying he doesn't want to watch that kind of stuff, but Adam tells him he's gross and that it's a movie on kung-fu. Fitz comes in and starts to bust them, but Eli tells him to get lost. After Eli tells him that he can't because he has to stay home and study. Adam is upset because he was hoping to do something, but just ignores it. After, school he goes back to The Dot and sees Eli and Clare on having a study hangout. Eli is embarrassed and he explains everything. Adam is pissed off, and tries to ignore him. Eli and Clare then offer for him to tag along, but Adam tells them he won't because he's not going to be a third wheel again. At school the next day\n\nAdam ignores Eli and Clare's seating area, and listens to Fitz when he asks if Adam wants to sit across from him. Adam is confused that Fitz was an enemy and now he's trying to be a friend. Fitz also says it's a free country and Adam can do whatever he wants. They eat lunch and have a friendly conversation, and when Eli confronts Adam, Adam basically makes fun of Eli and makes him leave pissed off. At The Dot after school, Eli confronts Adam about him hanging out with the bully, Fitz. Adam tells him he's tired of being pitied and being the third wheel. He makes Eli feel bad and give up to say that he pitied him. Adam ignores Eli and Clare and continues to hang with Fitz.\n\nIn Purple Pills (2), Fitz and Adam are working out, where Adam is not able to lift the weights, and then says he wants to fight somebody. So Fitz invited Bianca to fight him because Fitz says no guy is going to want to punch a girl, but Adam says he is not a girl and runs off. Later he punches Fitz in the stomach, then throws him to the ground, and says he will fight him later. Eli tries to pry him off of Fitz, but he says he can fight his own battles.\n\nAdam's friends, Eli and Clare try to convince him to not show up but he does anyway. Later Eli shows up to the fight and says he won't leave his side. Fitz shows up and Adam starts pushing Fitz. Eli tells Adam to take it easy, which results in him getting punched in the mouth by Fitz. Inside, Clare lights a stink bomb inside a golf ball to make the smoke alarm go off causing them to evacuate the school and break up the fight. Though technically, Adam did win by kicking Fitz in his private parts.

Adam catches Fiona after school, dubbing her with the nickname, 'Princess Fiona' which\n\nFiona isn't taken too. Adam tells Fiona about Drew, how great he is, being the brother-turned-wingman.

Drew replies with \"So?\" and Adam says, \"So maybe I should go out with her.\" They begin an argument about why Fiona wouldn't date him, and Drew claims it's because she wouldn't want someone who isn't physically a guy. Adam grabs his backpack and storms off leaving Drew in the gym. Fiona later follows Adam out of the school and tells him that they snuck some from the food drive.

While not even Luke's comments, attempting to reveal Adam's transgender status, work at all.\n\nIn Building A Mystery (2), Becky doesn't want to keep Adam a secret, so she decides to tell her parents that he's transgender. She prepares for the awkward conversation with Adam and Jenna posing as her parents, before she can actually talk to them. They seem understanding. The next day, Adam comes over and Becky's father hands him a pamphlet to \"fix\" him. He tries to persuade Adam, believing him to be confused, and wanting the best for his daughter. Adam leaves, offended, and Becky scolds her father. The next day, she confronts Adam and informs him of her recent decision; She will be taking her parents offer, believing herself to be confused, and ends her relationship with Adam. As Adam slams his locker in sadness and anger, Becky cries while walking off, apparently regretting her decision.\n\nIn Doll Parts (1), Adam tries out for the boys volleyball team, but Audra doesn't want him to. When Adam asks her if he can take testosterone pills to increase his muscle build and lower the pitch of his voice, she tells him no. When the time comes that he needs her signature for the team, he finds her crying while holding Drew's shirt. Adam comforts her, but during this, promises not to join the volleyball team. Still wanting to join, Adam must forge her signature.\n\nIn Doll Parts (2), Adam makes the volleyball team, but at practice, he is hit in the face by a volleyball, which causes his nose to badly bruise and bleed. Coach Armstrong asks Adam if he wants to call home, but Adam avoids this since he forged his mother's signature to get onto the team. Later, Adam is hiding from Becky so that she wouldn't see his nose, and he talks with Eli, who urges him to go to a doctor. Later at home, Audra comes home and reveals to Adam that she knows about him joining the volleyball team because Coach Armstrong called home to check up on him. Adam tells her that he was going to ask if he could join, but she was crying over Drew, and he didn't want to further upset her. His mother approaches Adam again later, and it turns out she is fine with him joining the team. She tells him that she is proud of the man he is becoming, and thinks it is time that they start talking to a doctor about having Adam to start taking testosterone. Adam is overjoyed upon hearing this and hugs his mother.\n\nIn Tonight, Tonight, Adam hits it off with Missy, another musician at the Battle of the Bands, who can be seen checking him out at the beginning of the episode and slips him a piece of paper saying, \"Call me maybe?\" with her phone number on it. Adam is concerned at first about calling Missy but Dave dials the number she gave Adam and gives the phone to him. After Adam hangs up the phone after leaving a voicemail, he says really loudly while Becky is in the room that he \"really hates\" her when she tries to make conversation with him and is coldly rebuffed by him. Despite saying how he is over her and hates her, Adam can still be seen giving her lingering looks throughout the episode, even admitting that while he thought they were done, his \"heart is telling him to give her another chance\". During a heated make out with Missy in a dressing room in a clothing store, she finds a cucumber in his pants that falls out when she begins to grab at him. Adam flees in humiliation only to be followed out by Missy. Once she catches up with him, he tells her that he is transgender. Missy is completely fine about this, having grown up with an open minded family. She later on asking what song they will do in Battle of the Bands. Adam tells her they are doing the song Superman.\n\nLater on while he and Missy are getting lunch, Becky is dropped off outside the restaurant by her father while he finds a parking space. She calls out his name and walks over to him. Adam mutters, \"You have got to be kidding me!\" and asks if she's stalking him. She states that she is getting dinner with her dad who is parking the car. Adam sarcastically tells her to \"hide\" so she isn't seen with an \"abomination.\" Becky responds, \"Don't say that! Did you read my email?\" Adam tells her he didn't read it, and tells her to go \"far, far away\" and walks away. However, Becky begins pouring out her heart and says, \"it's not working, the therapy. It doesn't cure feelings. Sitting there everyday only reminds me that I like boys.\" She takes a deep breath in and continues, \"and you're a boy - between the ears where it matters.\" Then a bit louder she tells him, \"and no therapy will ever change that! That's what my email says, that's what I've been trying to tell you.\" Missy approaches them and Becky looks at her clearly worried. Missy asks if she's a friend of his and Becky waits, staring at him for his answer. He responds, \"No one important.\" Becky is stunned and, while obviously fighting tears, she walks away. As he Missy sit and begin eating, Adam looks at Becky as she leaves.\n\nThings get messy later at the contest and Missy's band begins playing Superman. Adam admits he told her the song they were using, but he insists Missy wouldn't steal their song. Adam is bluntly told that he got played. He realizes Missy was just using him so they can do their song and win the contest. When he confronts her about it between performances, she openly admits she played him, but that he \"seemed like a nice guy.\" When her ex boyfriend/bandmate makes a transphobic comment about his cucumber incident, it leads Adam to bust him up and punch him in the face, getting his team disqualified for the violence when he is caught by Bullfrog. He seeks help from a celebrity judge who he can relate to who is Chaz Bono, a real life Female to Male transgender, about letting WhisperHug back in.\n\nAdam tells Chaz about his situation, to which Chaz points out that being made fun of does not leave any good reason to start a fight. He also tells Chaz about the cucumber incident. Chaz requests the name of \"the girl he did all this for\" and Adam tells him her name is Becky. He admits that he thought he could move on from her by going for another girl, even though they would be perfect if she did not want to keep them a secret from her disapproving parents. Chaz tells him that it happens, but when Adam asks if girl situations ever get easier, Chaz says that every relationship has its own set of obstacles to face, but the important thing is that he and Becky love each other, and if her parents take longer to get on board, she is not to blame. Adam, feeling inspired, says that he is his idol. However, Chaz says it is more of the other way around because he is in high school and is this far along, but he also tells him to \"try not to fight.\" He then agrees to try and convince Bullfrog to let WhisperHug back in the competition.\n\nAdam soon confirms that the band can play - just without him. Asking if he was okay with his forced absence in the performance, Adam says, \"If you can believe it, I made another huge mistake today and I have to go make it right.\" He then grabs his things and leaves to go see Becky at her house after checking that her family is gone. Becky, clearly surprised to see him, asks what he was doing there. Adam says he doesn't want to get her in trouble and intends to make it a quick visit. He explains that he finally understands if she wants to keep him a secret as she's come such a long way for him, it was okay if it took other people longer. He adds on that he knows it'll be \"messy\" but that they need to try to be together or \"they'll never know.\" He asks, \"Try with me?\" Becky smiles at him brightly, confirming her answer, just as her father comes home, who demands to know what was going on. Becky takes Adam hands and says to her father, \"I love Adam.\" Adam and Becky then smile at each other.\n\nAdam is then seen walking into the party with Becky. He introduces her and is happy when hearing the band won third place. He tells Becky, \"I can't believe I just walked into a party with you.\" She says, \"I can't believe I just walked out on my dad with you.\" When he states he clearly wasn't happy with it, she says she has faith that one day her parents will come around. His brother then comes up and snags him away for a moment as she leaves to go mingle with her friends. Drew jokingly calls him a player - calling his luck on his jacket - as Adam clarifies he had to \"mess up with one girl to get to the right one\" and Drew says \"been there, bro.\" Adam is then asked to be his best man at Drew's wedding to which he near tearfully agrees. He enjoys the rest of the party as he and Becky share a kiss, earning \"awes\" from their friends who watch with bright smiles. Adam says to her, \"I didn't know you were one for public displays of affection.\" She responds, \"I have nothing to be ashamed of,\" then smiles as the two go on to dance.\n\nIn Degrassi: Las Vegas, he is seen playing a game on his iPad with Imogen while Drew, Bianca, and Fiona practice for the wedding ceremony. He and Drew go their house to get Drew's suit and other items they need for the trip. Audra walks in and says it's a nice surprise to see Drew. They both lie to her and say they're going camping when they're actually going to Las Vegas. On the plane, Adam, Drew, Fiona, and Imogen discuss what Drew could do for his wedding vows. He reminds of Drew of past family weddings and how their uncle had his best man sing with him. Drew comments about how Adam isn't able to sing and Adam jokingly says he won't be his best man if he says things like that. Adam then watches Drew's confrontation with Katie and keeps quiet about it.\n\nHe attends Drew's bachelor party along with Jake and Mo. When Drew asks the guys to share a memory they had with him, Adam reminds him of the time when Drew brought dog treats to school when he was eight years old as a snack. He then watches Drew on stage with a stripper. The next day before the wedding, he is seen Skyping with Becky and tells her that there were girls at the bachelor (referring to the strippers) and tells her how much he misses her. At the wedding, he is scolded by Audra for lying to her about where he was going to be. Later, he is seen helping Drew perform I Can't Help Falling in Love With You and plays the bass. He is also seen at Drew and Bianca's bachelor party along with Becky, Fiona, Imogen, Audra, and Omar.\n\nSeason 13\n\nIn Summertime, Adam is seen attending a camp meeting with the workers, obviously upset, when Imogen plops down next to him. She asks him what was wrong, being able to tell he is upset, and he reveals that Becky, his girlfriend, is leaving for Florida the next day. When Imogen assumes the two are naturally breaking up, Adam says that they aren't, calling his relationship with Becky \"rock solid,\" referring to her relationship with Fiona as an example. Imogen says they actually broke up and Adam sympathizes with her, though still worried about his future with Becky, including the guys who may be all over while she is away. He says he doesn't want to be that \"crazy, jealous guy who asks a bazillion questions.\" Imogen offers to do the job herself, if he decides to be her \"camp bestie\" and Adam agrees to it, relieved.\n\nAdam is next seen at a concert alongside Becky and Imogen. Imogen asks if she is going to be lifeguarding all summer, Becky says she hopes to. Imogen asks her if she is going to be having female co-workers and Becky admits that the majority of her co-workers are actually guys whom she describes as \"so funny\". This detail obviously makes Adam uncomfortable, causing him to say that they \"aren't as funny as [he] is\" and Imogen quickly fakes that she sprained her ankle. Adam goes to get her some ice, unaware of the girls' chat regarding Imogen's possible crush on him. When he returns, Becky gives him a long and overly passionate kiss. Surprised, Adam asks what that was that was for and Becky coyly suggests they go \"somewhere private.\" Assuming Imogen said something to put Becky into her current mood, Adam excitedly thanks Imogen for \"whatever it is that she said\" and calling her \"the best.\" He walks off with Becky into the crowd, presumably to make out, as Imogen looks down sadly.\n\nAdam is then seen once again making out with Becky as Drew and another counselor see them while going over a check list. Drew smacks Adam on the back of his head and reminds him that the campers were arriving soon. Adam says that Becky was leaving for Florida and Drew gives him five more minutes and winks at him. Becky and Adam attempt to resume their make out session when Imogen interrupts their moment, reminding him that they had to attend to the kids who are about to arrive. However, Becky tells Adam she has to talk to him. With Imogen leaving, Becky finally confides with him about her suspicions that Imogen likes him and doesn't want him to spend anymore time with her. Adam assumes Becky doesn't trust him and Becky insists it's not him that she doesn't trust, but still has him promise to stay away from Imogen. Despite being hesitant, he agrees to spend less time with Imogen and leaves to assume camp duties. Becky gives him one last lingering look, obviously fearful for the worst, as Adam is obviously unsettled about the whole matter himself. Drew partners him up with Imogen to be counselors for the Iguana's group. Adam attempts to switch co-counselors, but Drew is too busy to hear him complain and he meets up with Imogen. He says they have \"one small problem\" and Imogen immediately says it's Becky. Adam tells her that Becky thinks she has a crush on him and Imogen insists there has to be something she can do to fix it; Adam suggests getting different counselor partners and convince Drew they couldn't work together. His idea clearly upsets her and they agree to talk about it later.\n\nDuring the first activity to remember names with the kids, going around in a circle saying your name and something you like, Imogen skips Adam during the game. When a fellow girl camper points this out, Imogen claims to have never heard of him and continue with the next camper. Adam calls her rude and Imogen begins to childishly repeat what Adam says, resulting in the two swatting each other, calling each other a jerk and Adam pulling Imogen's hair. Drew breaks the two up and sends them outside the school to settle the fight out.\n\nOnce outside, the two briefly fight even more when Adam now thinks she must be out to break up his relationship. Imogen insists that isn't her intention and Adam demands to know why she doesn't want to switch partners then if that isn't the case. Imogen reveals she doesn't want to switch groups since she doesn't make friends easily and \"wrecks everything she touches\" and just simply likes him as a person. Feeling sympathetic, Adam suggests they can be \"secret friends\", but pretend to hate each other for Becky's sake. This including to remain co-counselors. Imogen is ecstatic and the two begin to go inside to assure Drew they can work together. As they get up, Imogen says that she hopes that Becky realizes how lucky she is to have him as a boyfriend. Adam has a quick worried look on his face and says he agrees.\n\nIn All I Wanna Do, Adam visits Clare in the hospital. She is happy to see him. He mistakenly reveals that Eli sent out an email with six tips upon how to act when visiting Clare. Clare says she is tired, so Adam leaves. After Clare shaves her hair off, Adam and Drew come to visit her. Adam brings Imogen to Pick out a wig for Clare because she doesn't want Eli to see her like that.\n\nIn My Own Worst Enemy, he is seen running Sports Day at the day camp and is very happy to see that Clare's there. When Clare vomits during the race, he tells everyone to take a water break.\n\nIn About a Girl, Adam prepares for a FaceTime date with Becky. Drew goes for a slice of pizza that Adam ordered, but is rebuffed by Adam telling him that it is for his date with Becky and that he ordered a pizza to her house too. Adam and Becky connect on FaceTime and chat briefly, only to be interrupted by Todd, who's holding the box of pizza while eating a slice. Becky says that Todd is there to pick her up for church group which will take place on his yacht. Becky blows Adam a kiss and leaves the computer, and Todd says \"Don't worry man, I'll take care of her.\" Drew asks for a slice of pizza, saying that Todd got one. Adam replies \"Who the hell is Todd?\" to which Drew says while eating \"I think that's the guy stealing your girlfriend.\"\n\nAdam is at the Degrassi Summer Day Camp looking through pictures of Becky and Todd that Becky posted on Hastygram. Adam is interrupted by his camper, Colton, who starts looking at the photos with him. They then go to try to set up wood for a camp fire, but Adam becomes distracted when his phone vibrates alerting him that more pictures were posted. Adam realizes that Colton has disappeared and runs away to search for him. Adam is yelling for Colton in the foyer, when Drew approaches. Adam admits that he can't find Colton which upsets Drew. They argue briefly, but stop when they hear a child yelling. Adam and Drew find Colton with Dallas, who takes Colton to the nurse after he says he bumped his head. Drew tells Adam to go to the resource center, while he talks to Mr. Simpson. Adam expresses concern about losing his job saying that \"It's the only thing keeping me from going totally insane over Becky.\" Drew understands and assures Adam that he will tell Simpson that it was an honest mistake, but makes Adam swear that there will be no more phone, Hastygram, or Becky.\n\nImogen walks into the resource center and finds Adam on FaceRange looking at Becky's page which is full of pictures of her and Todd. Adam says that he wishes he could delete the photos, in which Imogen asks if he knows her password. Adam then logs in to Becky's page and chats with Todd appear. Adam searches his name in their chats, but no results come up. Drew comes in and tells Adam that he still has a job, but that he's on probation. Drew leaves and Adam cryptically says that he's \"gonna send this Todd a message.\" Adam, Imogen, Drew, and Dallas are in the gym. Drew and Dallas are hula hooping, while Adam is on his laptop, and Imogen is sitting next to him. Adam has decided that he is going to impersonate Becky on her FaceRange and tell Todd that she's not interested. Imogen disagrees with the plan, but Dallas and Drew think that it's a good idea as long as he can make it sound like Becky and that he deletes the message immediately after. Adam writes \"I have a boyfriend named Adam, but I don't mention him much because I know you like me. But I'm totally in love with him. You need to stay away from me. Please respect my choice.\" Imogen insists that it's not going to work and that she's going to find out when Todd asks her about it. Adam quickly adds on to the message \"Please never speak to me again. P.S. Wear a shirt.\" Adam wants to celebrate and offers to buy pizza. They leave for the Torres house.\n\nBack at the Torres house, Drew, Dallas, and Imogen are in the basement, and Adam comes down with pizza. A cell phone goes off, and Dallas pulls out his phone. He says \"Damn it's not me. Fifty texts to Alli; Not one back.\" Adam checks his phone and gasps. The message says \"Hey Adam, my plans fell through, so call me when you can.\" Adam, excited, leaves the room and immediately calls Becky. Becky says that someone accessed her FaceRange account from Toronto. Adam lies, and says that it was probably nothing. Becky then reveals that Todd got a message from her account that she didn't send and that she knows it was Adam. Adam admits that it was him, but is angry that she is hanging out with him. Becky insists that he is just a friend, to which Adam replies \"For now.\" Becky asks what that's supposed to mean. Adam says that he is trying to get with her. Becky says that she's not interested in Todd, and that he should have just spoken to her, like she did to him about Imogen. She says that she would never cheat, and is hurt that he would think she would. Adam, upset, insists that they forget about it, put it behind them, and laugh it off. He says \"Becky, please, I love you.\" Becky replies \"There's no love without trust, Adam. If you won't talk to me, then you obviously don't trust me. I think I need some time to think about all this.\" Adam tells Becky to please wait, but she says \"I'm sorry\" and hangs up.\n\nIn Cannonball, Adam tries to make up with Becky and, taking some advice from Drew, sends her 'apology roses'. He receives a package back from her and is excited. However, he is disappointed to open the box and to find the roses he had sent to her. Drew and Dallas urge him to get over Becky, saying it likely she is over him and moving on in her life. Dallas, offering advice, suggests he hook up with Imogen to get over her. Adam insists, \"I don't want to get over Becky. I love her.\" However, Dallas insists she is over him and urges him to do the same. Imogen smiles and waves at him and Adam plasters on a smile and waves back, contemplating his choices. Taking Dallas up on his advice, Adam tries to develop a chemistry with Imogen as a distraction from his constant thoughts surrounding Becky. This includes giving her flowers and complimenting her on her looks. Soon he is shortly distracted when the two take cover from the rain in the back of a van. With sudden sexual tension when Imogen takes her shirt off to change, Adam kisses her and the two begin to make out.\n\nThe moment is killed when Drew walks in on the two and awkwardly takes chocolate, marshmallows and graham crackers for s'mores for the campers. As he closes the door, he mutters, \"Definitely over Becky\". Suddenly struck with realization that the hook up did nothing to help him get over Becky, Adam stares as Imogen leaves the car to attend her camp counselor duties. Adam passes by Drew and says he's just going to turn in. Drew says he is going to miss the campfire sing along, but Adam complains that he feels like he's going to puke. Drew thinks he just ate some of Dallas' food, known to be bad, but Adam brings up it is about his kiss with Imogen. Drew asks what the problem is since they were both consenting adults who are single. Adam tells him Dallas told him that hooking up with Imogen was supposed to help him forget about Becky, but now all he can do is think about her. Drew says that since they were together for awhile, it is going to be a longer process to get over her. Adam again firmly declares that he doesn't want to get over her. Drew tells him he can skip the bonfire, to avoid Imogen and to call Becky when they get home. Adam says he can't wait that long to talk to her, but Drew says he doesn't have a choice since there isn't cell service for miles. As he walks away, Adam takes out his cell phone and checks for the cell service. Determined to talk to Becky again, he snatches the counselor's car keys and takes off for a drive to receive cell service.\n\nDuring the drive, Adam receives a text message from Becky reading, \"Adam. I'm sorry. We should talk\". Relieved, he keeps driving as he texts back to her, \"I <3 u Becky.\" However, he fails to see the car driving up near him and ultimately crashes into a tree as he swerves to avoid it.\n\nIn Honey, he is shown to be in the hospital after crashing his car into a tree; a multitude of wounds appear on his face. The hospital informs the Torres family that Adam will be undergoing a major surgery. His family has faith in his survival; however, at the episode's end, we see Drew and Dallas together at the hospital, conversing among themselves. Both Audra and Omar appear in the room, their faces delineating solemn, dejected sentiments. Drew asks if Adam is okay, but he soon realizes the truth when the aforementioned couple fail to respond: Adam is dead.\n\nMentions\n\nDegrassi\n\nSeason 13\n\nIn This Is How We Do It, he is mentioned by Drew when he was talking to Dallas.

Of course I fall for the most beautiful girl in 12th grade, out of my league is an understatement. I mean look what happened with Bianca, I put myself out there only to be called a freak. What if this girl feels the same way? I-I don't want to get hurt like that again. Maybe mom's right, I should lay low. But I keep having dream where she runs up to me and I hold her and she says \"Adam, you're the guy I never knew I always wanted\" and then Fiona kisses me, doesn't care that I'm transgender. Then I wake up, just a dream.\" (Degrassi mini, Love Is)\n\nSav: \"Dude I can't believe you got it in there!\"\n\nAdam: \"Ha, that's what my ex-girlfriend said!\" (awkward silence) \"...What?\"\n\nEli: \"Gross.\"\n\n(To Clare about Eli): \"Behind the face of even the sweetest, most emo guy in the world lurks a caveman.\"\n\nAdam: \"Booyah!\"\n\nSav: \"Dude, booyah?\"\n\nEli: \"Who are you?\"\n\nAdam: \"Sorry.\"\n\nFitz: (with Adam staring at him) \"What the hell are you looking at?\"\n\nAdam: \"I'm still trying to figure that out...\"\n\nClare: \"Why do you have tampons?\"\n\nFitz: \"Hey Adam, drop something?\"\n\nAdam: \"Clare, pick up your stuff.

SURPRISE!\"\n\n(To Bianca about her locker): \"Is there a section in there dedicated to hair mousse?\"\n\n(To Clare): \"It's official...

That's a limited edition!\"\n\nClare: \"And it's about to get even more limited.\"\n\n(To Dave): \"You have the brain of a scarecrow and the heart of a tinman.\"\n\nDave: \"I would just follow the sign on the door.\"\n\nAdam: \"Yeah, well 50 years ago that sign would have said whites only.\"\n\nDave: \"That's different! That's racism.\"\n\nAdam: \"Okay maybe it's not exactly the same, but still, you discriminate against me based on something I didn't choose and can't change. It's the way I am, Dave.\"\n\n(To Drew): \"Since those gang members went Grand Theft Auto on your butt!\"\n\n(To Drew): \"Drew, I'm sorry you're such a WIMP!\"\n\nDave: \"If Sadie asks, you and I have a date tonight.\"\n\nAdam: \"I have absolutely nothing to wear.\"\n\nDave: \"They started out as chicks?

I really really like you.\"\n\nAdam: \"I'm sensing a ‘but you’re transgender.' I should have known better than to fall for you.\"\n\nBecky: \"You fell for me?\"\n\nAdam: \"First time I met you.\"\n\n(To Becky): \"Stop... go back to the part where you asked me to be your boyfriend.\"\n\n(To Becky when he notices her parents at the auction): \"Need me to stay?
