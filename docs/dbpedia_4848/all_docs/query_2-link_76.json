        "text": "Originally posted by Rob Semmeling\n\nA 917 tucked away in a French barn for some 30 years...you couldn't make this stuff up, could you!?\n\nThis vaguely reminds me of one time I went for a drive through the Ardennes on a hot summer day, about two or three years ago. I passed through this quiet little village somewhere off in the country, when suddenly I saw a Porsche 906 parked on a little porch - no pun intended! So I turned around and went to take a look.\n\nIndeed it was a genuine Carrera 6, neatly parked next to another Porsche - a 2.8 RSR I later found out - just outside a small garage. You know, the kind of garage sometimes seen on old photo's: wooden doors, racing posters on the walls, some tools lying around, that kind of stuff.\n\nThen I looked a bit closer, and there it was: in that unmistakable blue & orange livery...a 917! Quietly sitting there in this small, picturesque garage in some tiny Belgium country village - you just don't expect to find such a car there! Maybe 30 years ago when they raced at nearby Spa, but not anymore! The best thing was the doors were open and nobody was around...\n\nAnyway, turned out it was the workshop of MEC Auto, a company that restores and maintains racing cars for many customers. They are regulars at historic events.\n\nNot quite as sensational as the '24' in a French barn, but that doesn't matter: it made a good day even better.\n\nOriginally posted by rhegra\n\n..yes I know, Pedro, but if you look at the paint scheme around the headlights and the plexi-cover of the headlights with its black edges (and especially the angular course at the outside corner of the left cover), there are some close similarities. And not all the paintings are the same at these spots at the Gulf-cars if you take a closer look. I don't think also that the as very clever known businessman Siffert \"forgot\" his car in France. Otherwise: what car they used at the funeral in Fribourg? Let's try to find an answer...\n\nBest regards, Christian"
