Twenty-five years of artistic growth through the mediums of oil, ink, acrylics, collage and watercolor led her to take a major step into printmaking in 1983. The technical challenge of this medium, combined with her already well-defined skill as a professional artist, provided a positive avenue for printmaking as a full time career.\n\nIn 1987 Beki and her husband relocated to the Pacific Northwest and from her studio in Washington's Northern Puget Sound, she has been devoted full time to the developments of her prints and further refine her skills in her beloved medium- watercolor.\n\nBeki's style provides a contemporary look to familiar subjects that brings a unique life and spirit to each piece she produces. Every work of art or print receives her special imprint...a small red dot that precedes her signature."
