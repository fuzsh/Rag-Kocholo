        "text": "Now available in paperback, Here‚Äôs to Us reunites #1 New York Times bestselling authors Becky Albertalli (Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda) and Adam Silvera (They Both Die at the End) to continue the story of Arthur and Ben, two very different boys readers first fell for in the blockbuster What If It‚Äôs Us.\n\nBen survived freshman year of college, but he‚Äôs feeling more stuck than ever. His classes are a slog, his part-time job working with his father is even worse, and his best friend Dylan‚Äôs been acting weird. Ben‚Äôs only real bright spot is his writing partner Mario, who‚Äôs been giving him a lot of Spanish lessons and even more kisses. Mario‚Äôs big Hollywood dreams make Ben start to dream bigger‚Äîand the choices he makes now could be the key to reshaping his future. So why can‚Äôt he stop thinking about a certain boy from his past?\n\nArthur is back in New York City for the first time in two years, ready to take the theater world by a storm as the world‚Äôs best‚Ä¶. intern to the assistant of an off-Broadway director. Of course, it sucks to be spending the summer apart from his sweet, reliable boyfriend, Mikey, but he knows their relationship is strong enough to weather the distance. Which is why it‚Äôs no big deal when his ex-boyfriend Ben stumbles back into the picture. And it‚Äôs definitely fine that Ben‚Äôs happy with some mystery boy. First loves are special, but it‚Äôs way too late for what- ifs. Right?\n\nEven as the boys try to shake off the past, they keep running into each other in the present. Is this the universe trying to tell them there‚Äôs a do-over in their future?\n\nüíï cute MC interactions\n\n‚ùé nothing really new progression of the first plot\n\nüï∫üèΩquirky, diverse supporting characters\n\nI love Becky Albertalli (Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda) and Adam Silvera (They Both Die at the End). I loved the first book in this series: What If It‚Äôs Us?. I am sad to say I was a little underwhelmed by this second installment. That‚Äôs not to say it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant read‚Ä¶ how could it not be from two such power-house authors? But I guess I expected something as hard-hitting and engaging as I‚Äôve come to expect from Silvera in particular.\n\nHere‚Äôs To Us is a follow-up to the novel that introduced us to two teen boys: Arthur and Ben. After the most amazing meet-cute, the hunt begins! It‚Äôs a hopeful story, diverse, adorable, and fun.\n\nWhen the second novel began, I was a little confused. Granted, it‚Äôs been a while since I read the first book, but it took me a few moments to get on track with time passing. For some reason, in my mind, Ben and Arthur were together at the end of the previous book. Looking back, I see now that was wrong. And it‚Äôs realistic. Let‚Äôs face it, we meet people when we‚Äôre teens and they aren‚Äôt necessarily souls who stay in our lives permanently.\n\nHere‚Äôs To Us is about change and moving on. Ben and Arthur have both moved on to new relationships. Their friends are changing and growing as their lives expand. Arthur and Ben are both facing situations that are forcing them to make decisions regarding their futures. Moving? Maybe, Continuing to date something? Maybe. Harboring feelings for that meet-cute guy they met at the post office? Maybe.\n\nI enjoyed the interactions between the main characters and their friends. There were some quirky, lovely moments with Dylan in particular. I was glad to see him back! Ben and Arthur seemed very much the same characters they were in the first novel. They had grown a little but seemed to be sitting in the same places. I think there wasn‚Äôt enough forward movement for me at the beginning of this novel‚Ä¶ then the pace switched to high speed in the last 20% of the book.\n\nNot my favorite written by either author but it‚Äôs a decent read. I‚Äôm sure that most people will enjoy this‚Ä¶ especially if they enjoyed the first novel"
