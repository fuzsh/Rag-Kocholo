        "text": "Mark Gary Adams passed away on November 6, 2023, just ten days shy of his 70th birthday. He would do anything to get out of celebrating his birthday!\n\nMark was born November 16, 1953 to Gary and Carol Adams. He graduated from Cottonwood High School. He served a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints in the Northern States Mission, serving mainly in Wisconsin and Minnesota, which is how he became a lifelong Packers fan.\n\nHe graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Electrical Engineering and followed his father and grandfather’s footsteps in a career with Rocky Mountain Power.\n\nMark met and courted Janice Hinton at a singles ward in Salt Lake. They played racquetball for their first date and Janice beat Mark soundly. For their second date, Mark took Janice sailing and she got really sick. The rest, as they say, was history. Mark and Janice were sealed in the Salt Lake temple on December 15, 1978 and enjoyed 34 years together until Janice passed away in 2012.\n\nMark and Janice loved children. Unable to have children of their own, they became strong advocates of adoption, fostering and helping within their community. They were called on a service mission to chair the adoption program for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. They served for 5 years advocating for adoption legislation and policy. In time, they were blessed through adoption, to welcome two children, Andrew (1988) and Beki (1990), who were the center of their world. Between 2012 and 2017, he welcomed 4 grandchildren, who he spoiled tremendously!\n\nAfter 40 years working with system planning for electric grids and high transmission at Rocky Mountain Power, Mark retired in 2017 and focused full time on his hobbies and service. He was an avid collector. He loved to collect rocks, coins, stamps, and books. He was knowledgeable in each of his areas of expertise and loved to show his collections. He read at least 2 books a month and belonged to Metal Detecting and Rock Hounding clubs. He could instantly identify any rock and made sure we never took Schist for Granite.\n\nMark loved to travel and his fridge is full of magnets from all the places he’d been.\n\nMark was involved in Boy Scouts for over 40 years. He also served as a family history consultant and loved genealogy. Mark served as an ordinance worker in the Bountiful Temple for over ten years. At the time of his passing he was serving at the Utah State Prison, providing support, instruction, and Sunday School lessons to inmates.\n\nHe was preceded by his parents Gary and Carol Adams, wife Janice Hinton Adams, and son Andrew Thomas Adams.\n\nHe is survived by siblings Lou Ann Adams Butler of Murray, Kathleen Adams Richards (Gary) of Sugar Land, Texas, Kristine Adams Cross (Jeff) of Sandy, and Steven Arthur Adams (Patti) of Henderson, Nevada, his daughter Beki Adams of Idaho Falls, Idaho, and grandchildren Hazle and Janice Brown of Idaho Falls, Idaho, and Cole and Harpper Adams of Portland, Oregon.\n\nMark was beloved of so many people in his community. His passing has left a hole in our hearts and he will be sorely missed. In lieu of flowers, please reach out to someone today and let them know that you love them.\n\n“Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungered, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink? When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee? Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee? And the King shall answer and say unto him, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.” Matthew 25: 37-40\n\nFuneral services will be held Tuesday November 14, 2023 at 11:00 a.m. at the Kaysville Stake Center, 615 N. Flint St., Kaysville, Utah. Friends may visit with family Monday November 13 from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Lindquist’s Kaysville Mortuary, 400 N. Main St., Kaysville, Utah and Tuesday from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. at the church prior to the service.\n\nInterment, Kaysville City Cemetery.\n\nServices will be live-streamed and may be viewed at www.lindquistmortuary.com by scrolling to the bottom of Mark’s obituary page."
