Moreover, one in five women are turning to telehealth for the care they need.\n\nCNN: Monthly Abortions Continue To Trend Up In The US In 2024, New Report Shows\n\nDespite restrictions and bans that have taken effect in the two years since the US Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision revoked the federal right to an abortion, the average number of abortions provided each month in the United States continues to rise, a new report shows. (McPhillips, 8/7)\n\nBloomberg: 1 In 5 US Abortions Are Now Through Telehealth\n\nMore women in the US are seeking abortion care through telehealth than before the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, according to a new report. One in five clinician-provided abortions performed in the first quarter of 2024 were obtained through telehealth services, the analysis from abortion advocacy group the Society of Family Planning showed. That contrasts with the second quarter of 2022, during which only one in 20 abortions were obtained through telehealth. (Ceron, 8/7)\n\nNPR: Meet The People Sending Abortion Pills To Places With Bans\n\nThe packages, no bigger than a hardcover book, line the walls of the nondescript office near Boston. It's not an Etsy retailer or a Poshmark seller or, as the nearby post office workers believe, a thriving jewelry business. These boxes contain abortion pills. \"Welcome to modern abortion care,\" says Angel Foster, as she holds up a box for mailing. Foster, who has an M.D. degree, leads operations at what's known as the MAP, a Massachusetts telehealth provider sending pills to people who live in states that ban or restrict abortion. (Nadworny, 8/7)\n\nAbortion updates from Illinois, Florida, and Ohio —\n\nCapitol News Illinois: Illinois Expands Reproductive Health Care Protections\n\nGov. JB Pritzker signed multiple bills expanding reproductive rights in Illinois on Wednesday, including codifying a federal law that allows medical professionals to perform an abortion in response to a clinical emergency. (Raju, 8/8)\n\nSalon: The Fallout Of Florida’s Abortion Ban Has Been \"Chaos,\" Experts Say\n\nTwo months after going into effect, there has been a 575% increase in Floridians calling the National Abortion Federation hotline. “What we've seen in the aftermath of this ban is just devastation and chaos, and it has really impacted the lives of Floridians but also has expanded its impact throughout the southeast,” Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation, told Salon in a phone interview. “We have seen a dramatic increase in people being forced to travel outside of Florida, outside of the Southeast, and having to travel further distances to access the essential health care that they need.” (Karlis, 8/8)\n\nOhio Capital Journal: Ohio Among States Spending Millions On Anti-Abortion Centers Since Dobbs, Study Finds\n\nNew data studying state funding for anti-abortion centers showed Ohio provided more than $22 million to groups in the state since the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 Dobbs decision overturned national abortion rights. Since 2013, the state has fed more than $35.5 million to anti-abortion funding, according to Equity Forward’s newest study of state-by-state funding for centers who are also called “crisis pregnancy centers,” and are often religiously affiliated facilities that provide services like ultrasounds and pregnancy tests, but have also reportedly provided outdated or debunked information about pregnancy. (Tebben, 8/8)\n\nCDC Updates Guidance On Addressing Pain Control Before IUD Insertion\n\nAs The New York Times reported, it's the first time federal health officials have recommended that doctors should counsel women before the procedure, which some say can be excruciating. It might lead to doctors using anesthetics more often.\n\nThe New York Times: Health Officials Urge Doctors To Address IUD Insertion Pain\n\nIn recent years, the process of getting an intrauterine device, or IUD, has become infamous on social media. Videos of women writhing and crying while the T-shaped contraceptive device is inserted have become macabre online staples. “Unless you’re living under a rock, you’re aware of the issue,” said Dr. Beverly Gray, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University. Doctors have been accused of ignoring the discomfort. For the first time, federal health officials recommended on Tuesday that physicians counsel women about pain management before the procedure. (Rosenbluth, 8/7)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal: Doctors Can Now Save Very Premature Babies. Most Hospitals Don’t Try.\n\nAfter her water broke early, doctors told Fatima Goines to prepare for her newborn’s death. Goines was 22 weeks into her pregnancy, just past the halfway mark. Doctors at Methodist Hospital in suburban Minneapolis said they couldn’t save such a premature baby and that no hospital could. They told her that once the baby girl was born, Goines could hold her until the infant died. (Whyte, 8/7)\n\nNorth Carolina Health News: Pharmacists Take On A Larger Role In Providing Access To Contraception\n\nTypically, there have been many steps to getting contraception: Scheduling a doctor’s appointment and waiting what can often be months until the next available appointment. Arranging for time off work, transportation and even child care to make it to the appointment just to get a prescription for birth control. Then there’s going to a pharmacy to pick up the medication. It doesn’t have to be this way anymore. (Crumpler, 8/8)\n\nOn period poverty —\n\nThe New York Times: Trump Campaign Criticizes Walz For State Law Providing Tampons In Schools\n\nAs part of their effort to portray Tim Walz, the new Democratic vice-presidential candidate, as a far-left liberal, the Trump campaign attacked the Minnesota governor on Tuesday for signing a bill last year that provides access to menstrual products for transgender students. At issue is broadly inclusive language in the law, which states that products like pads, tampons and other products used for menstruation “must be available to all menstruating students in restrooms regularly used by students in grades 4 to 12.” Republican state lawmakers in Minnesota had tried — and failed — to amend that bill so that it would apply only to “female restrooms,” though some Republicans went on to vote for the final version of the bill. (Cameron, 8/6)\n\nWMAR: Baltimore Non-Profits Help With Period Poverty\n\nRobin Neumann, aka 'The Period Lady', started a mission to end period poverty in Baltimore city and county schools. She says she has seen firsthand how much the price of menstrual products can take a toll on a family, especially when choosing between products or groceries, which have also increased in price. Neumann supplies period products in over 20 Baltimore City and County schools. (Wright, 8/6)\n\nStudy Is First Proof That Covid Sets Off Reaction That Leads To MIS-C\n\nThe study on multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, was published Wednesday in the journal Nature. Meanwhile, covid is surging in at least 84 countries despite an incorrect assumption from some people that the pandemic is over. Plus: More dengue in Hawaii.\n\nThe New York Times: What Causes Dangerous Inflammation In Children With Covid?\n\nWhen exposed to a virus, the human body marshals the immune system to fend off the intruder. Sometimes, the defense goes awry, and the body mistakenly turns against itself instead of the attacker. This sort of friendly fire drives multi-inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a mysterious condition that in rare cases strikes children who have had a severe bout of Covid-19, according to a new study. (Mandavilli, 8/7)\n\nMore on the spread of covid —\n\nThe Washington Post: Summer Covid Surge Hits At Least 84 Countries And Continues To Climb\n\nA summer covid wave — and the accompanying fevers, coughs and general misery — continues to wash over the Americas and parts of Asia and Europe, including the Paris Olympics, offering the latest evidence that the coronavirus moves in ways distinct from other respiratory ailments. The World Health Organization said this week that the virus is increasing in at least 84 countries despite perceptions that the pathogen is a remnant of the past. Disease trackers sounded alarms that diminished testing and low vaccination rates could provide fertile terrain for more dangerous viral variants to take hold. (Malhi, Ortega and Keating, 8/7)\n\nNewsweek: COVID Map Shows Highest Rates Across US As New Variant Rises\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released an updated map highlighting which states have been the hardest hit. (Dwan, 8/7)\n\nCentral Florida Public Media: Amid A COVID Summer Spike, Why Are So Few Floridians Getting The Vaccine?\n\nAs the number of COVID-19 cases rises in Florida, vaccination rates lag behind, and that is concerning health experts. In 2021, the first full year a COVID-19 vaccine was available, 15 million Floridians received a vaccine. But this year, a little over 400,000 have received a booster, despite the virus's summer spike. (Pedersen, 8/7)\n\nThe New York Times: Why The Dutch Field Hockey Team Isn’t Shaking Hands At The Olympics\n\nAfter two pandemic-disrupted Olympics, most teams haven’t given Covid a second thought in Paris. The one from the Netherlands is the exception. (Smith, Minsberg and Vrentas, 8/8)\n\nIn other outbreaks and health threats —\n\nHawaii News Now: Dengue Case Found On Maui Prompts Response From Vector Control Teams\n\nThe Department of Health has confirmed a travel-related case of the dengue virus in Hana, Maui. Officials say vector control teams are responding after highly dense populations of mosquitoes were found around the home and surrounding area.

(Facher, 8/7)\n\nIn other pharmaceutical and tech news —\n\nReuters: Third Trial Over Zantac Cancer Claims Ends With Hung Jury\n\nThe third trial over claims that discontinued heartburn drug Zantac ended in a mistrial on Wednesday when jurors could not agree about whether pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim was responsible for an Illinois man's cancer. Martin Gross alleged in his lawsuit in state court in Chicago that he developed prostate cancer from a carcinogenic contaminant called NDMA found in the drug. His lawyer, Sean Grimsley, said he would take his case to trial again. (Pierson, 8/7)\n\nAP: After Baby's Death, Kentucky Parents Sue Infant Formula Maker At Center Of 2022 Crisis\n\nThe parents of a Kentucky baby who died last fall after drinking bacteria-tainted infant formula are the latest to sue Abbott Nutrition, the manufacturer at the heart of a 2022 crisis that left millions of Americans scrambling to feed their children. Willow Jade Dellaquila, of Carrollton, Kentucky, was 13 days old when she died on Nov. 5, 2023. She was infected with cronobacter sakazakii, a dangerous germ traced to a can of Similac Total Comfort powdered formula used in the baby’s bottles, records show. (Aleccia, 8/7)\n\nCBS News: Doctors Optimistic About Results From New Alzheimer's Drug Infusions\n\nOn Wednesday, Independence Health System held a press conference at the Westmoreland Hospital in Greensburg to give people who may be diagnosed with or already have Alzheimer's disease new hope and a positive path forward.

(DeRose, 8/7)\n\nCBS News: AI Technology Could Help Detect Eye Conditions In Children\n\nSmartphones could help identify eye disorders in children. In a new study published in JAMA Network Open, researchers in China examined more than 1,400 facial photographs from nearly 500 children and developed an artificial intelligence model that can accurately detect three common pediatric eye conditions: myopia or nearsightedness, strabismus or \"crossed eyes\", and ptosis or drooping of the upper eyelid. (Marshall, 8/7)\n\nStat: CMS Finalizes Medicare Coverage Rule For Breakthrough Devices\n\nThe Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has finalized its rule easing reimbursement for medical device makers. Called Transitional Coverage for Emerging Technologies, the program gives device makers with products deemed “breakthrough” technology by the Food and Drug Administration a quicker way to secure Medicare coverage. The agency first introduced the rule last June. (Lawrence, 8/7)\n\nOn weight loss drugs —\n\nReuters: US Patients Take Wegovy Obesity Drug For Around Six Months, Novo Nordisk Says\n\nU.S. patients are on average staying on Novo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss medication for just six months, an executive said on Wednesday, attributing the short time to the low availability of the wildly popular drug. (8/7)\n\nThe New York Times: More People Are Overdosing on Ozempic Alternatives\n\nThree hours after Becky Cheairs injected herself with the first dose of compounded semaglutide, she started to vomit. Crouched over the toilet, reeling from nausea, she thought there was no way she would make it on the R.V. trip from Arkansas to San Antonio she had planned that weekend. She was right: She spent the next day throwing up at least once an hour. Like many others, Ms. Cheairs, 66, had taken the drug to lose weight. But she hadn’t taken the brand-name products Ozempic or Wegovy, which come in pens pre-filled with a specific dose. (Blum, 8/6)\n\nKFF Health News: How Little Denmark Got Homegrown Giant Novo Nordisk To Lower Ozempic Prices\n\nOn May 13, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) published an open letter to Novo Nordisk on the front page of a leading Danish newspaper, urging the hometown company to live up to its altruistic standards by lowering U.S. prices for its blockbuster diabetes and weight loss drugs. What Sanders didn’t realize was that Denmark, a country of 6 million, was enduring its own crisis over how to pay for the Novo Nordisk drugs Ozempic and Wegovy. (Allen, 8/8)\n\nL.A. Care Health Plan Streamlines Preauthorization Process\n\nThe insurer has removed about 14,000 billing codes that would require prior authorization, including for lab tests and specialty care visits. Also in health industry news: the No Surprises Act, McLaren Health Care cyberattack, VillageMD, and more.\n\nModern Healthcare: L.A. Care Health Plan Cuts Some Prior Authorization Requirements\n\nL.A. Care Health Plan has cut 24% of its prior authorization requirements in what the insurance company characterized as an effort to lighten administrative burdens for providers, reduce discharge times and avoid care delays. Some specialty care visits, laboratory tests, medical equipment and catheter supplies will no longer require prior authorization, the insurer said in a news release Wednesday. (DeSilva, 8/7)\n\nModern Healthcare: What The No Surprises Act Ruling Means For Providers, Insurers\n\nProviders notched another win in the legal battle over the No Surprises Act, forcing regulators to rework how the law is implemented. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit on Friday upheld a lower court ruling and voided parts of the law related to settling out-of-network reimbursement disputes, since the process skewed negotiations in insurers’ favor. (Kacik, 8/7)\n\nAxios: Insurers’ Big Profits Stem From Care Delivery, Not Core Business\n\nFor insurers like UnitedHealth Group and Cigna, the road to ever-larger profits increasingly leads through anything but health insurance. (Reed, 8/8)\n\nMore health industry news —\n\nCBS News: McLaren Health Care Confirms Criminal Cyber Attack Caused Disruptions To IT, Phone Systems\n\nMcLaren Health Care confirmed on Wednesday that a criminal cyber attack caused disruptions to information technology and phone systems reported on Tuesday.

The proposed transaction, which requires the execution of a definitive agreement and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in several months and would transition Upland, Pennsylvania-based Crozer to nonprofit status, Esposito said in a statement. Financial details were not disclosed. (Hudson, 8/7)\n\nThe Boston Globe: Among Massachusetts Hospitals, The Gap Between Rich And Poor Widens\n\nThe latest state review of hospital payment data, released this month by the Center for Health Information and Analysis, underscores a persistent gap in the fortunes of acute care facilities. Community hospitals that see a high proportion of people with public insurance commanded prices that are 7 percent below the state average. It’s a twofold problem: Those insurance programs — such as Medicaid and Medicare — pay below-market rates. On top of that, private payers such as Blue Cross Blue Shield, Tufts, and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care pay less to community hospitals than they do academic facilities. (Lee, 8/7)\n\nModern Healthcare: Walgreens May Sell Entire VillageMD Stake\n\nWalgreens is considering selling its entire majority stake in primary care provider VillageMD, a move that would be a dramatic about-face from its previous commitment to the care model. The company is evaluating \"a variety of options\" in light of \"VillageMD’s substantial ongoing and expected future cash requirements,\" Walgreens said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Wednesday. Options include selling all or part of its stake in VillageMD, a restructuring or other opportunities, the company said. (Hudson, 8/7)\n\nCalifornians Face Long Wait Times When Calling Medi-Cal, Analysis Finds\n\nResearchers found that it takes almost an hour to get someone on the line. However, one public social services official says their figures show shorter wait times. Elsewhere, Delaware has new laws governing mental health care for youth, and Iowa hasn't issued gun permits for school employees.\n\nLos Angeles Times: Phoning For Medi-Cal Help? You May Face Hourlong Waits And Hang-Ups\n\nWhen Californians phone for help with their Medicaid coverage, they routinely face waits of nearly an hour — and are regularly disconnected without reaching anyone, researchers found in a newly released analysis. An audit released Wednesday by the Children’s Partnership, an advocacy group focused on child health, found the average wait when researchers phoned in dozens of counties was 55 minutes. More than half of children in California rely on Medi-Cal — the California Medicaid program — for their health insurance coverage, including 1.4 million children 5 and under. (Alpert Reyes and Gold, 8/7)\n\nKFF Health News: The Politics Holding Back Medicaid Expansion In Some Southern States\n\nFor Roderick Givens, a radiation oncologist, the expansion of Medicaid isn’t just a policy issue. He practices medicine in a rural area in the Mississippi Delta and he sees daily how Medicaid coverage could help his uninsured patients. “I can’t tell you the number of patients who I see who come in with advanced disease, who have full-time jobs,” Givens said. “They haven’t seen a physician in years. They can’t afford it. They don’t have coverage.” (Hawkins, 8/8)\n\nMore health news from California and Delaware —\n\nSouthern California News Group: Lawmaker Wants To Ban California Schools From Serving Food With Red 40, Other Dyes\n\nA state lawmaker from the San Fernando Valley has resumed his push for a bill that would ban public schools in California from serving food or beverages containing synthetic food dyes such as Red 40 that child health advocates say can harm developing brains and cause neurobehavioral problems.

John Carney signed two pieces of legislation on Wednesday that support student mental health in schools.

This unit will lower the ratio of students to counselors and make mental health services a lot more accessible. The second law will expand the reimbursement of school-based behavioral health services through Medicaid.

Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a law in April allowing school staff to get a professional permit to carry a firearm on school property. School boards get to decide if staff can be armed at school.

Among its Republican supporters, Rep. Dean Urdahl remarked, “Just talking with my wife and family members, they felt like it was an important issue I should support.” And it really should be that simple. Policies that address the economic burden of menstruation, and that acknowledge the educational value of treating period products as basic school supplies, have proven to be a popular and common sense reform—at home and abroad.
