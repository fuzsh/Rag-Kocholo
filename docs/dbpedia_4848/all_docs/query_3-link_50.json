        "text": "To say I’ve been excited about the release of What If It’s Us is truly an understatement…the way I received my ARC can attest to that. Imagine this: you’re at Book Con 2018 at the Epic Reads Plinko line with 150 other people who are also trying to get this one book. You go up…and you don’t get it but then your husband goes up, gets the “Your Choice” square and then you start screaming “What If It’s Us!” and cuddle the book for about 10 minutes afterwards. I’m not even over exaggerating. AND THEN something even more amazing happens and you run into Adam and Becky on the exhibitor floor when they were on their way to their signing session and got them to sign your copy! I swear I almost burst out of my skin with excitement and probably looked like a complete idiot.\n\nWhat If It’s us is a book about two gay teens: Arthur and Ben. Arthur is a short, Broadway fanatic who is in New York for the summer doing an internship…and he’s never had a boyfriend before. Ben is a Puerto Rican kid born and raised in New York who just broke up with his boyfriend Hudson. They meet at the post office and their relationship starts to blossom. They get separated but eventually find each other and learn more about themselves, together.\n\nWriting:\n\nFrom the way these characters were written, my guess is that Arthur’s POV was written by Becky and Ben’s POV was written by Adam. Even though these two authors have completely different writing styles, they blended incredibly well together and sometimes I would forget whose POV I was in. Ben was more cynical while Arthur was a ball of energy who was sometimes very immature and lost in the game of love.\n\nI thought that they both wrote the teenage characters very well and had a lot of different types of people in this story. You had Ben who was Puerto Rican but didn’t fit into that group because of his light skin and lack of language skills in Spanish, you had Arthur who was privileged and needed to be taught to think before you speak, you had Hudson (Ben’s ex-boyfriend) who was effeminate and was made fun of for it. It’s really great that all these characters each have something different to give and they all learn from each other.\n\nThe flow of the story fit very well and I really appreciated that there was an epilogue set 15 months after that summer. It gave you a glimpse into the future but also let you, as the reader, create your own ending.\n\nCharacters:\n\nBen was fantastic! He was nerdy and down to earth and I absolutely adored him. I liked seeing him interact with his family and Dylan (his best friend). His family seems really sweet and welcoming and I would love to go to a family dinner. He had a natural progression from Hudson to Arthur as well. The authors didn’t try to rush the relationship, they made sure that Ben was feeling lost and wasn’t sure of his feelings in the beginning because he just ended things with Hudson two weeks before meeting Arthur.\n\nI liked that he struggled in school and wasn’t automatically the smartest and hottest guy in New York. He had his flaws and they were obviously shown. He was also a writer who enjoyed fanfiction and makes nerdy jokes. I would definitely want to be friends with Ben.\n\nArthur was also a great character but sometimes he frustrated me or made me want to crawl into a hole because he was so ridiculous. He loves theater, especially Hamilton and his love goes far beyond just listening to the soundtrack over and over again. He said things that were offensive sometimes and only caught himself doing it half the time (Ben called him out on it the other half).\n\nI thought that he was incredibly immature in some moments. For example, when Ben entered the Hamilton lottery and won but couldn’t get the tickets because they were late. Arthur through a temper tantrum like a five year old and made Ben feel bad because he was late meeting up with Arthur. He has a lot of growth to go through but it seems like he was much better in the epilogue.\n\nI appreciated that they didn’t have sex automatically, but instead Arthur (who had never done it before) got nervous and couldn’t do it. Sex isn’t something that everyone takes lightly…every person is different and sometimes the time just isn’t right. Instead, they got to be together on Arthur’s last night in New York. Ben was very sweet to Arthur and made sure he felt comfortable the whole time.\n\nDylan, Ben’s best friend is a really great friend. He has his flaws but is always there for Ben and vice versa. I really enjoyed his character and seeing his relationship with his girlfriend evolve too. It was really great seeing a gay male character be friends with a straight male character without there being any romantic feelings or prejudice involved. He made me laugh out loud while reading a lot of the time and I enjoyed his personality very much.\n\nStory Line:\n\nThe story line was very cute. It’s about teenagers trying to navigate the waters of love and relationships in every sense of the word. There are romantic relationships, friendships as well as family relationships that these characters deal with. There are so many elements to this story but they connect very well and don’t overwhelm you as you’re reading.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this book. I couldn’t stop smiling the whole way through even though some parts just made me cringe (it’s all Arthur’s fault really). I think this is definitely one of my top reads of 2018 already! It was real and complex and not everything tied up nicely at the end.\n\nWhat If It’s Us by Adam Silvera and Becky Albertalli comes out on October 9, 2018.
