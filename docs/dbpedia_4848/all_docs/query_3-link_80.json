        "text": "My rating: 3.5 of 5 stars\n\nReceived: ARC\n\nPublication Date: December 28, 2021\n\nPublisher: Quill Tree Books\n\nPoint of View: First Person (Ben & Arthur)\n\nGenres & Themes: Young Adult, LGBTQ+, Contemporary,\n\nBLURB:\n\nBen has spent his first year of college working on his fantasy manuscript with his writing partner Mario, who is a great Spanish tutor, and an even better kisser. So why can’t he stop thinking about the fact that Arthur’s back in town two years after they called it quits?\n\nArthur is in New York for a dream internship on Broadway, with a boyfriend back at home that he couldn’t be happier with. But when he comes upon Ben cuddled up with a mystery boy, he starts to wonder if his feelings for Ben ever truly went away.\n\nEven as the boys try to focus on their futures, they can’t seem to help running into each other in the present. Is the universe forcing them to question if they’re actually meant to be?\n\nPossibly not. After all, things didn’t work the first time around.\n\nPossibly yes. After all, the sparks are still flying.\n\nSometimes you just have to take a leap of faith and raise a glass.\n\nHere’s to celebrating old friends!\n\nHere’s to embracing new beginnings!\n\nHere’s to believing in second chances!\n\nREVIEW:\n\nTwo years ago we got the beginning of Arthur and Ben. Two years ago, we left them with a happy for now, and a rather ambiguous ending. They stayed friends but with a feeling that their paths might cross in the future. That perhaps their time hadn’t been then, but that one day when they were no longer teens, and living in different states, and with more maturity, they’d find each other again and give it another go.\n\nThe only time New York kept us apart was when I was here and he wasn’t.\n\nQuote from Here’s To Us uncorrected proof.\n\nHonestly, I’m not a fan of HFN or ambiguous endings, especially when that type of ending is then given a sequel. One wherein you find out that the couple broke up or haven’t talked in years, or that they’re dating other people. So when Here’s To Us was announced I thought we would get the ending we deserved, the ending that Arthur and Ben deserved, but then the synopsis came out and literally the reason I hate sequels when the ending is HFN was the literal plot…I almost didn’t read it. Though What If It’s Us had its faults and I tend to be apprehensive about anything Adam Silvera writes (Silvera’s modus operandi is sad endings, and I stay clear of that in fiction), I still hoped that I enjoyed this one.\n\nLet me go into this mini-rant about sequels (and trilogies) about couples, and I swear this all relates. Statistically, sequels tend to be less read than the first book in anything. Logically, those who tend to read sequels are fans of the first, or readers of the first installment. Follow my thinking here. So, let’s say we go through an entire romance book or rather we follow a couple through the first. Typically, they end up together, but let’s say that they don’t, so then we get a sequel and you’re happy because surely no one will write a sequel only for them to not end up together a second time, right? Or let’s say you have then end up together in two installments only for them to not end up together in third? Make it make sense.\n\nIn Here’s To Us, the plot should make you brace yourself. It has been two years since Ben and Arthur met that summer in New York. Two years and they’re no longer together. Ben is still writing his wizard book, working at his dad’s place, and dating Mario, his writing partner (not to be confused as his boyfriend, though). Back in Georgia, Arthur has just booked a summer internship in New York with a somewhat famous director (he’s famous in his circle, though), and he’s dating Mikey. Now, Arthur is back where he and Ben started. But both of them are not the same boys that met and fell for each other years ago. Now, they have new amazing guys who might lead them further away from each other.\n\nFor the longest time, I struggled with this book. Not in reading it but enjoying it. And then I hit the 60 percent mark and stopped thinking of this book as a romance, and merely thought of it as contemporary and that seemed to shift things around. I can’t say that I loved this book, but I think there’s going to be an audience for it. Some will love it, and maybe those that hated the first one will like this more. Or maybe you’ll lose the magic you felt reading the first one. Or you’ll enjoy it as the contemporary it is meant to be.\n\nI’m one of those that actually enjoyed the first one. I sometimes read because the things that happened in the book are so improbable that that’s what makes it so enjoyable. I rooted for Ben and Arthur, which is why I wanted to read this book. Then I read it, and for the longest time, I couldn’t see this having a good ending. If it weren’t for the last 20 percent, I think I would have given this a solid 3 stars, with an out of sight, out of mind mentality (meaning I would never think about it again, except when thinking how some sequels shouldn’t be written).\n\nThe thing is that Mario and Mikey (was it deliberate to have M names for the new love interests?) were genuinely great guys. I didn’t want to root for their relationships to sour because they’re great guys. At the same time, Ben and Arthur kept thinking about the other when talking about their new guys. EXCEPT. That like in What If It’s Us, I felt that Arthur loved Ben more than Ben loved Arthur. That there could be a second chance, but ultimately it would come down to Ben and if he actually loved/still loved Arthur, because he literally would think about Arthur but Mario always tail ended the thoughts surrounding him.\n\nI don’t know, even now, if I genuinely enjoyed this book. This installment takes a closer look at a romance that started when the two guys were sixteen and had quite a magical start, but can such a relationship survive? If it didn’t, can there be a time where they have grown up a bit, have seen and dated other people, but still love each other and come back when it’s their time? When I think of it like that, there’s definitely space for such a story, and it’s a more realistic (though like in the first this is filled with references—so if you didn’t like that the first time around, I warned you and stop complaining—and there are still “universe” happenings) take on their relationship. But, if you go in for the romance, as I did in the beginning, then you might feel frustrated and a bit disappointed with the amount of Arthur and Ben together (by themselves with no other friend or love interest). Literally, I had a note that read, “Imagine wanting a sequel to a couple and all you get is waxing poetry to another love interest.”\n\nThere’s plenty that I liked and I think works realistically (for example Ben’s manuscript), and other stuff that is just fun. Some things aren’t things that I particularly had a problem but they really put things into perspective. For example, Ben has this decision later on in the book and it really made me shake my head. He literally was about to do something with literally no cushion other than a guy he wasn’t sure how he felt. It really puts into perspective when you’re grown and think that thankfully your parents can support you. I liked how both kept thinking how mature they were from when they were 16, but it really shows that they are still teens with some of their decisions. But as I said, the last 20 percent make up for a lot. At least for me. Not enough to make me love it, as I once did with the first book, but at least enough to not delete this series from my head."
