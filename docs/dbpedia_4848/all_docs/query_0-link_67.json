        "text": ".\n\n.\n\nDestroy All Lines, David Roy Williams & Double J Presents\n\nTISM\n\nDEATH TO ART TOUR\n\nFIRST HEADLINE TOUR IN 20 YEARS\n\nWITH AN UNBELIEVABLE LINE-UP OF SPECIAL GUESTS\n\nESKIMO JOE\n\nMACHINE GUN FELLATIO\n\nBEN LEE\n\nTHE MAVIS’S\n\nTISM\n\nannounce new album\n\nDEATH TO ART\n\nout Friday October 4\n\nNew single/video\n\nDEATH TO ART\n\nOut Now\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAustralia, this is serious. After teasing a new album and flaunting their wares onstage at Good Things Festival in 2022, today TISM return armed with a tantalising trifecta, locking in their first headline run since 2004 this October and November, unveiling a brand new single and video, and confirming the upcoming release of their new studio album. With all three announcements sharing the same name, Death To Art, the upcoming Death To Art Tour is also bound to go down in Australian music history, with TISM set to be joined by fellow Aussie icons ESKIMO JOE, MACHINE GUN FELLATIO, BEN LEE and THE MAVIS’S.\n\nWith four of the country’s most iconic acts teaming up for the Death To Art Tour, this historic run of shows will kick off on Sunday 20 October in Brisbane, before heading to Melbourne on Saturday 9 November, and closing out in Sydney on Friday 29 November. Not only marking the extremely anticipated first headline performances in over two decades for TISM, the Death To Art Tour will also see fellow sonic scoundrels MACHINE GUN FELLATIO reform for the first time in 19 years, as well as THE MAVIS’S reforming for the first time in six years.\n\nReleasing a brand new single I’ve Gone Hillsong in 2022, the group’s first new material in close to 20 years, TISM also teased at the time an album which did not exist. Fast-forward to 2024, and TISM have since released a new EP, 2023’s The “C” Word, complete with caterwauling commentary and chaotic charisma. And, as of today, the beloved unruly collective have ventured into a brand new chapter, unleashing the title track single and video from their forthcoming full length album Death To Art, officially due out on October 4.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTISM have retained their anonymous and cult-like status since first forming back in the early 1980s. Laced with nihilistic humour and gleeful sarcasm, as well as a razor-sharp penchant for hybrid dance, pop and rock, TISM may have kept their identities a secret all this time, but their impact on the Australian musical landscape remains undeniable.\n\nWith six studio albums under their balaclavas, including their 1988 debut Great Truck’ Songs of the Renaissance and 2004’s The White Albun, TISM have also released multiple live and compilation albums and EPs over the years, spawning enduring fan-favourites, including ‘(He’ll Never Be An) Ol’ Man River’ and ‘Greg! The Stop Sign!!’, millions of streams, and also snagging the seal of approval from longtime fan, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. And as any fan who has ever attended a live show will attest to, there really isn’t anything quite in this universe like a TISM performance, whether clad in their balaclava best or attaching giant balloons to their jumpsuits as seen at their illustrious appearances at Good Things Festival in 2022 alongside Bring Me The Horizon, Deftones and many more.\n\nOnce dubbed “the most dangerous band in Australia”, MACHINE GUN FELLATIO have remained as one of the country’s most prolific acts; a fact made even more impressive since they broke up back in 2005. In 2024, the group’s live shows are still being talked about, with their touring history spanning two Big Day Out appearances, sold out shows in the UK and the USA, tours alongside Robbie Williams, Kiss, Primus and Duran Duran, and plenty of hedonistic headline shows packed to the rafters. With singles that dominated the airwaves, including ‘Pussytown’ and ‘The Girl Of My Dreams (Is Giving Me Nightmares)’ and an ARIA Award in their wake, MGF band members Pinky and Chit Chat also helped to pen The Whitlam’s hit 1997 single ‘No Aphrodisiac’. Calling it a day back in 2005, MACHINE GUN FELLATIO are roaring back and re-forming for three special shows with their friends, heroes, and fellow rascals, TISM.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nFrom humble beginnings in Fremantle through to commanding 35 ARIA Award nominations, repeated triple j Hottest 100 appearances, an international fanbase, and six studio albums, indie rockers ESKIMO JOE are undoubtedly one of Australia’s most beloved acts; and this trio certainly aren’t slowing down anytime soon. Recently releasing a brand new single The First Time, ESKIMO JOE also appeared at the 2023 edition of Good Things Festival alongside Fall Out Boy, Limp Bizkit, Devo and many, many more, performing to packed and adoring crowds that spurred them to release new music. From their 2001 debut album Girl through to their breakout albums, 2004’s A Song Is A City and 2006’s platinum Black Fingernails, Red Wine, ESKIMO JOE have also snagged eight ARIA Award wins and multiple nominations, all while continuously charming audiences across the globe with their dynamic live show.\n\nDiscovered in his teens during the 90s as part of the Aussie lofi punk act Noise Addict, BEN LEE’s prolific career has been nothing short of astonishing. Turning his gaze to a solo career in the mid 90s, BEN LEE has established himself as one of Australia’s bona fide finest, whether penning chart-smashing hits (‘Cigarettes Will Kill You’, ‘Gamble Everything For Love’ and ‘Catch My Disease’), instrumental albums (Ayahuasca: Welcome to the Work) or children’s albums (Ben Lee Sings Songs About Islam For The Whole Family). Entertaining and unpredictable, BEN LEE has collaborated with Josh Radnor, Ben Folds, Ben Kweller, and Sara Silverman, won four ARIA Awards along with multiple nominations, prime time performances, including at the 2006 Commonwealth Games closing ceremony and on Australia’s The Masked Singer, and he continues to tour extensively after decades of wowing crowds across the world.\n\nForming in Ballarat as a fun, DIY project in the late 80s, THE MAVIS’S quickly became fan favourites of the 90s Aussie music scene. Spearheaded by siblings Matt Doll and Beki Colada, and an array of shiny clothes and coloured hair, the band cemented their place in musical history with their 1998 synth-laden track ‘Cry’ – which became one of the most played Australian songs that same year. The group featured on triple j’s Hottest 100 three times (‘Thunder’ in 1996, ‘Naughty Boy’ in 1997 and ‘Cry’ in 1998), performed on the 90s TV institutions Hey Hey It’s Saturday and Recovery, releasing three studio albums, earned multiple ARIA Award nominations, and toured alongside the likes of Green Day and Kylie Minogue amongst many others. Officially disbanding in 2001, THE MAVIS’S briefly reunited in 2018 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of Pink Pills, with 2024 marking their first live shows in six years.\n\nIn 2024, Australian music history will be made. Don’t miss this unbelievable lineup of Aussie icons all in one space this October and November.\n\nEarly bird pre-sale tickets on sale: Friday 9 August @ 9am local time\n\nTo Gain Early Ticket Access Register Here\n\nGeneral tickets on sale: Tuesday 13 August @ 9am local time\n\nTickets from destroyalllines.com\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDestroy All Lines, David Roy Williams & Double J Presents\n\nTISM\n\nDEATH TO ART TOUR\n\nFIRST HEADLINE TOUR IN 20 YEARS\n\nWITH AN UNBELIEVEABLE LINE-UP OF SPECIAL GUESTS\n\nESKIMO JOE\n\nMACHINE GUN FELLATIO\n\nBEN LEE\n\nTHE MAVIS’S\n\nSUNDAY 20 OCTOBER – RIVERSTAGE, BRISBANE\n\nSATURDAY 9 NOVEMBER – SIDNEY MYER MUSIC BOWL.

Because around here my focus is on being a conduit for providing greater outcomes that people come here for. My day to day “work” is living in the moment, and I love helping others concentrate on finding their connection to themselves through their experiences.\n\nWhy start a music environment? The truth is I love music, I love writing, and I love life. I work with musicians every day, and I feel certain that I will be until they put me in the ground. I have been managing people in businesses of some sort for over thirty five years so along the way I have developed some “wisdom” from my regular and constant “observations”.\n\nAmnplify your experience. That is what we want you to do here, and if you want to let me know why you do, or don’t, shoot me a message on Facebook.\n\nHope you enjoy yourself here and find something that hits you somewhere.\n\nAugust 8th, 2024||\n\nRelated Posts"
