        "text": "What should I call you?\n\nCall me Becky! But my last name is pronounced like “Albert tallied the votes.”\n\nWait, you wrote a book? Where can I get it?\n\nI did! I’ve written a few! My first book, Simon Vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda, released in April 2015. My second book, The Upside of Unrequited, released in April 2017. My third book, Leah on the Offbeat, released in April of 2018. My fourth book (co-written with Adam Silvera) is called What If It’s Us, and it released in October of 2018. My fifth book (cowritten with Aisha Saeed) is called Yes No Maybe So, and it released on February 4th, 2020. My sixth book is called Love, Creekwood and it released on June 30th, 2020. My seventh book is called Kate In Waiting and it released on April 20th, 2021. My eighth book is called Here’s To Us (cowritten with Adam Silvera) and it released on October 5th, 2021. My ninth book is called Imogen, Obviously and it will be released on May 2nd, 2023. There are lots of ways to get them.\n\nYou may be able to find them in your local bookstore (especially indies) or your local library.\n\nOr you can order them online! Some of my favorite bookstores with online ordering options are:\n\nPowells in Portland, OR\n\nInkwood Books in Tampa, FL\n\nCharis Books & More in Atlanta, GA\n\nKepler’s Books in Menlo Park, CA\n\nAvid Bookshop in Athens, GA\n\nPolitics and Prose in Washington, DC\n\nLittle Shop of Stories in Atlanta, GA\n\nYou can also get them from:\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes and Noble\n\nBooks a Million\n\niBooks\n\nBookshop\n\nOr directly from HarperCollins\n\nAnd if you live outside the United States, I highly recommend Book Depository.\n\nWhat formats are available for your books?\n\nIn the US and Canada, SIMON, UPSIDE, LEAH, WIIU, YNMS, LOVE, CREEKWOOD, HTU, and KATE IN WAITING are available in hardcover, paperback, e-book, and audiobook. Simon’s audiobook is voiced by Michael Crouch. Upside’s audiobook is voiced by Arielle DeLisle. Leah’s audiobook is voiced by Shannon Purser. What If It’s Us and Here’s To Us are voiced by Noah Galvin and Froy Gutierrez. Yes No Maybe So is voiced by Michael Crouch and Tiya Sircar. Kate In Waiting is voiced by Bebe Wood. All of my currently published books are available in paperback and audio in the UK, Australia, and NZ (Simonverse – Penguin UK, WIIU and YNMS—Simon and Schuster UK). SIMON also has a special edition hardcover available, along with a paperback movie tie-in edition, and an Epic Reads Special Edition. A special edition boxed set of SIMON, UPSIDE, and LEAH paperbacks is also available in the US and Canada.\n\nMy books have been translated into lots of languages, including French, Spanish, Portuguese (with separate editions for Portugal and Brazil), Thai, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Taiwanese, Indonesian, Polish, Czech, German, Italian, Hungarian, Finnish, Vietnamese, Hebrew, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Romanian, Estonian, Slovakian, Russian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Chinese (Simplified Characters), Chinese (Complex Characters), and Serbian! Stay up to date on upcoming translations here.\n\nCan I order a signed book?\n\nI’m so happy to announce that you can order signed, personalized copies of all of my books from Bookmiser, in Marietta, GA! Scroll down on their homepage until you see the graphic with my book covers. When you click on it, it will download a form for you to fill out, along with instructions for submitting the form via email (you can also call). Signed copies of What If It’s Us and Yes No Maybe So will be personalized by me, and may not include Adam or Aisha’s signatures. Bookmiser can ship internationally, though there is an extra shipping fee, to be determined based on package weight and country.\n\nSometimes I sign stock at Little Shop of Stories or Charis Books and More (keep an eye on my Instagram page).\n\nYou can also keep an eye on my events page – often bookstores are able to hold books to be signed/personalized at my events, and then shipped out later!\n\nHow did you become an author?\n\nI’m still scratching my head and asking myself that question. In a nutshell, I used to be a clinical psychologist, but I left that job when my older son was born in 2012. When he was tiny, I decided to write the book I’d always told myself I’d write.\n\nThat book turned out to be SIMON!\n\nTo learn more about my specific becoming-an-author story, check out Summer Heacock’s beautiful blog for the very first interview I ever gave as an author (but ignore the parts about my second book. The details TOTALLY changed.)\n\nTo learn more about how you can become a traditionally published author, I recommend this incredible guest post by Delilah Dawson on Chuck Wendig’s blog, terribleminds.\n\nAlso, read literally everything on Dahlia Adler’s blog, The Daily Dahlia. She’s amazing – and her books are, too.\n\nCan you read my manuscript?\n\nI’m so sorry – I truly can’t (unless you are one of my existing critique partners or I specifically offer to read it).\n\nBut I found my amazing critique partners through Absolute Write and my local writers’ organization.\n\nIf you’re able to pay, you can also find really wonderful freelance editors to help with your manuscript. I highly recommend two of my favorite authors, Katherine Locke and Laura Silverman. Another really cool option: Laura has a Patreon offering a monthly newsletter with writing and publishing advice. Learn more about it here!\n\nCan you blurb my book?\n\nThis question is always a giant compliment! I do read, love, and blurb a lot of new releases. Right now, I am absolutely full for 2023 books (note: if we’ve discussed this and I’ve agreed to blurb your book, you are still on my list!). If your book comes out in 2024 or later, please (PLEASE) ask early. Due to my own deadlines and prior commitments, it is almost impossible for me to blurb a book on short notice. And thank you so, so much for understanding if I’m unable to blurb your book. I do try to read and help promote as many new releases as I possibly can, even if I’m unable to provide a cover quote. If you are an author asking directly, I strongly prefer blurb requests to come in through my assistant, Matthew Eppard (albertalli.requests@gmail.com). If your agent or editor is inquiring, please go through my agent, Holly Root (holly@rootliterary.com), or Holly’s assistant, Alyssa Moore (alyssa@rootliterary.com). This helps me stay organized, since I typically get several requests per week across multiple platforms. Requests sent via social media DM make it hard for me to stay organized — I much prefer these requests to come via email.\n\nWhat’s your favorite kind of Oreo?\n\nDouble Stuf or Classic.\n\nBut you’ll still respect me if I like Golden Oreos, right?\n\nNo.\n\nWhat was your inspiration for Simon Vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda?\n\nInspiration can be complicated—this post is my best attempt to explain it.\n\nBut you worked with LGBTQIAP+ kids and teens as a psychologist, right? Is Simon based on them?\n\nI did work a lot with LGBTQ teens and adults, as well as gender nonconforming children. However, Simon is not based on anyone I’ve worked with in a clinical capacity. I’m painstakingly careful to ensure that none of my characters are based on former clients. Like all practicing and formerly practicing clinical psychologists, I take therapist-client confidentiality extremely seriously.\n\nAre you planning on practicing psychology again at some point? And would you consider being my therapist?\n\nI’m not sure if I’ll go back to psychology in the near future. Unfortunately, if I know you as a reader or member of the writing community, I can’t be your therapist (this would be an ethical violation on my part).\n\nI’m feeling depressed and have been having thoughts of suicide. I know you were a psychologist. Can you help me?\n\nI’m so sorry you’re going through this. Unfortunately, legally and ethically, I am not allowed to take on a therapeutic role with my readers and friends. But I care about you deeply. Please reach out to your friends, family, teachers, or other supportive adults in your life (or your therapist, if you have one!).\n\nThe number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255. Do not hesitate to call, 24/7. Do not feel like your feelings are not significant or important enough.\n\nIf you’re more comfortable texting, contact the Crisis Text Line by texting “HOME” to 741741.\n\nI also highly recommend downloading the free notOK app if it’s currently available in your country. This app serves as a digital panic button, sending an immediate request for help to a small circle of trusted contacts.\n\nAnd if you’re an LGBTQIAP+ person between the ages of 13 and 24, The Trevor Project offers many wonderful resources. The number for their 24/7 suicide lifeline is 866-488-7386\n\nCan you give me advice on coming out?\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, but you can read more about my experience here.\n\nThe Trevor Project has a great resource for this.\n\nFor advice on navigating LGBTQIAP+ issues in school, I recommend GLSEN.\n\nIf you’re a parent or an ally of an LGBTQIAP+ kid or teen, consider becoming involved in PFLAG.\n\nWhat are your pronouns?\n\nShe/her\n\nIn what order should I read your books?\n\nMy first three books and my novella are part of the same universe, so if you want to experience the full story chronologically, you should read SIMON VS THE HOMO SAPIENS AGENDA, then THE UPSIDE OF UNREQUITED, then LEAH ON THE OFFBEAT, then Love, Creekwood. That said, The Upside of Unrequited takes place in a different setting, and can easily exist as a standalone story (meaning: it will make total sense if you read it on its own, and also, you do not need to read it to understand Leah On the Offbeat and Love, Creekwood). You can read Leah On the Offbeat and Love, Creekwood on their own, but I think you’ll get more out of them if you read Simon vs the Homo Sapiens Agenda first (or at least see Love, Simon)(but seriously, IMO, Leah is much more exciting if you read Simon Vs first).\n\nWHAT IF IT’S US, YES NO MAYBE SO, and KATE IN WAITING are completely separate from the Simonverse (and previous books by Adam Silvera and Aisha Saeed) so it doesn’t matter when you read them in relation to our backlists. IMOGEN, OBVIOUSLY fully functions as a standalone, too, but there’s a Simonverse reference for eagle-eyed readers.\n\nCan you tell me about Love, Simon?\n\nYes! Simon was recently adapted into the film LOVE, SIMON, which was released widely in theaters on March 16th, 2018. It is currently available to purchase electronically, as a DVD, blue-ray, or 4K. Target also released a special edition DVD that includes exclusive bonus Simon/Blue emails by me (these emails pick up right after the bonus emails in the Simon Vs. Special Edition Hardcover).\n\nThe film was directed by Greg Berlanti, distributed by Fox 2000, and produced by Temple Hill Entertainment. Fox 2000 and Temple Hill recently collaborated on The Fault in Our Stars and Paper Towns. Isaac Klausner, Marty Bowen, and Wyck Godfrey from Temple Hill are producing, along with Pouya Shahbazian (Divergent) and Chris McEwen from New Leaf Literary.\n\nThe script was written by Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger. They’re the writers and showrunners for This Is Us.\n\nThe film stars Nick Robinson as Simon, Jennifer Garner and Josh Duhamel as his parents, Talitha Bateman as Nora, Alexandra Shipp as Abby, Katherine Langford as Leah, Logan Miller as Martin, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Nick, Keiynan Lonsdale as Bram, Miles Heizer as Cal, Tony Hale as the assistant principal, Natasha Rothwell as Ms. Albright, and more!\n\nLove, Simon won Choice Movie-Comedy in the 2018 Teen Choice Awards, and Nick Robinson was chosen as the Choice Breakout Movie Star. Nick Robinson and Keiynan Lonsdale won Best Kiss at the 2018 MTV Movie and TV Awards. Love, Simon is also Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nYou can read my FAQ here, or check the film’s IMDB page here.\n\nWhat can you tell me about Love, Victor (the Love, Simon Hulu spinoff)?\n\nA television spinoff to the Love, Simon film is available now on Hulu and Disney+ in the US and Disney+ Star internationally. The spinoff stars Michael Cimino as Victor, a new student at Creekwood High School. Victor is navigating coming out as gay, and he reaches out to Creekwood alum Simon Spier for help. The series also stars Ana Ortiz and James Martinez as Victor’s parents and Isabella Ferreira and Mateo Fernandez as his siblings. Rachel Naomi Hilson, Bebe Wood, George Sear, Mason Gooding, Anthony Turpel, Anthony Kevan, and Ava Capri all play fellow Creekwood students in Victor’s orbit.\n\nThe spinoff is executive produced by Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger (who adapted the Love, Simon movie screenplay), along with Brian Tanen, Jason Ensler, Isaac Klausner, Wyck Godfrey, Marty Bowen, Adam Fishbach, and Pouya Shahbazian. Amy York Rubin directed the first episode, and Pilar Boehm and Adam Londy co-executive produce. Greg Berlanti is not involved in the spinoff, but Nick Robinson (Simon Spier in Love, Simon) narrates the series and serve as a producer.\n\nThe series ran for three seasons and all of them are available now.\n\nCAN YOU PLEASE TURN ONE OF YOUR OTHER BOOKS INTO A MOVIE OR A TV SHOW?\n\nFilm/TV stuff is happening behind the scenes for a few of my other books, but I’m unable to reveal more information at the moment. Thank you so much for bearing with me!\n\nThat said, like most authors, I have no control over whether my books are optioned and greenlit for film. Rights to LEAH ON THE OFFBEAT belong to Disney, since they own all film and theatrical rights to the LOVE, SIMON characters. Whether a LOVE, SIMON sequel gets made is entirely up to them.\n\nWill you adapt SIMON VS/LOVE, SIMON into a musical? Or can I be involved in adapting it?\n\nAll theatrical rights – stage and film – are owned by Disney.\n\nWill you be my pen pal?\n\nThis is a tough one for me. I love my readers so much. Believe me when I say that I absolutely love hearing from you, with all my heart.\n\nHowever, I get a lot of messages in the vein of what Simon might write to Blue. They are so charming and lovely, but I’m afraid I’m unable to maintain an online friendship with that level of back-and-forth intimacy. Realistically, I’m a super-stressed author with a lot of deadlines and two very young kids. It kills me that I’m unable to connect with you in this way, but there are simply too many potential pen pals!\n\n(Man, I hope you guys somehow connect with each other, though. I’m not kidding when I say you are the actual smartest, funniest, most wonderful human beings.)\n\nOkay, but I can still email you, right?\n\nIf you need something from me, please email my assistant, Matthew, at albertalli.requests@gmail.com.\n\nCan I DM you?\n\nOf course! But…realistically, unless we are mutuals, I am typically unable to reply. I do NOT run my Twitter account, nor do I check my Twitter DMs. I am absolutely baffled by Facebook Messenger, and will often not see messages for months (even from close friends and family members – seriously, what is up with Facebook Messenger??). I basically never check Tumblr or Goodreads. I do run my own Instagram, but I am unable to reply to DMs I receive there unless they are from people I already know and/or follow. Thank you so much for understanding!\n\nWill you or your publisher send me a review copy of your book?\n\nMy publisher and I are no longer able to send review copies of any of my currently published books. For upcoming releases, electronic copies of my books can usually be requested on Edelweiss. You can inquire by emailing my assistant, Matthew Eppard, at albertalli.requests@gmail.com. Please include as much information as possible about any social media and in-person platforms you have (this will help my publisher determine how to allocate their limited number of review copies). Please also include your mailing address and whether or not you would be open to reading an electronic copy of the book. We will forward all requests to my team at HarperCollins. Please note that Matthew and I do not make the decisions about who receives review copies – we’re simply compiling inquiries to forward to our team. Due to the high number of email requests, Matthew will be unable to reply directly to inquiries – but we will forward your request! Thank you so much for understanding.\n\nWould you mind sending me a free signed copy?\n\nI get this question VERY frequently, usually from readers who have already purchased my book and would like to use the extra for a giveaway. I can’t tell you how much I appreciate you for purchasing, reading, and wanting to promote my books. However, the truth is, like most authors, I get a very limited number of extra copies. Mine have been gone for months (mostly donated to schools, libraries, and LGBTQIAP+ organizations, or used for my own giveaways). At this point, any copies I give away for any reason have to be purchased out of my pocket. I wish I could afford to do this for my readers, but I’m afraid there are a lot of you (and I’m so grateful for that)!\n\nThat being said, if you are inquiring on behalf of a school, library, or other organization (ESPECIALLY if your organization specifically supports LGBTQIAP+ youth), please get in touch. I can’t guarantee I’ll be able to donate, but I will always try to make exceptions for these cases. You can reach me at albertalli.requests@gmail.com\n\nI also periodically run giveaways for signed books and other cool prizes, so keep an eye on my instagram page!\n\nI’d like to donate money to support LGBTQIAP+ youth! Do you have any favorite organizations?\n\nYou are awesome for considering this, and I do have a few favorites! I really love The Trevor Project (donate here) and GLSEN (donate here).\n\nCan I send you a letter in the mail? If so, where should I send it?\n\nI’m in the process of updating this – stay tuned!!\n\nCan I send you my book so you can sign it and send it back to me?\n\nI’m so sorry – I’m unable to do that.\n\nDo you do school visits?\n\nWhen I can! Please feel free to email me to inquire about my rates: albertalli.requests@gmail.com\n\nWill you be doing any events or signings soon?\n\nYes! More info coming soon. Keep an eye on my Instagram for more information in the future.\n\nI’m working on a school project about you or one of your books. Can you help me?\n\nI’m so sorry – I am unable to help with school projects (though I’m incredibly flattered that you want to do a project about me). Fortunately, if you’re willing to do a little research, most of the questions I’ve gotten from students have been answered in places online. I recommend searching the phrase: “Becky Albertalli interviews.” I’ve been giving interviews about my books for a few years, so your chances of finding the information you’re looking for are very good.\n\nWill you do an interview or guest post for my blog?\n\nI’m honored that you want to feature me! Realistically, this depends on my schedule, but you can always feel free to reach out to me via email and ask. albertalli.requests@gmail.com\n\nDo you mind if I write fanfiction about your characters? Or draw fanart? Or compile edits or playlists?\n\nI do NOT mind, and you are literally my favorite people. I’m a huge supporter of Simon fan stuff (I read the fanfic! I have framed Simon fanart from readers in my room!).\n\nIf you’re looking to find these things online, one of the best places to start is the creeksecrets tumblr! This is a reader-created site with lots of cool Simon art, gossip, and so many lovely spoilers! I also recommend checking out the Simon tag of Ao3 for some absolutely beautiful reader-created content.\n\nWould you consider writing a POV character who comes from <particular underrepresented community>?\n\nIt’s so important to me to strive toward inclusive books with thoughtful representation.\n\nThere are some experiences I feel I’m not able to authentically and accurately represent\n\n(particularly in cases where there are very few mainstream books about a particular\n\nmarginalized experience/intersecting marginalized experiences). The good news is that sometimes the book you’re looking for already exists. My favorite website is Dahlia Adler’s LGBTQReads. It’s so comprehensive and well-organized – a true lifesaver!\n\nUh, Becky? It’s actually just called “Tumblr,” not “the Tumblr.”\n\nYes. I know. One or two or a million people have mentioned this.\n\nSimon and his friends refer to creeksecrets as “the Tumblr” because they’re referring to a specific Tumblr page, as opposed to ALL of Tumblr. Imagine how much less of an impact Martin would have if he posted his bullshit to the big, wide abyss of Tumblr. “The Tumblr” is a specific community for Simon’s high school.\n\nKind of like how my moms’ group has a Facebook group, but we don’t refer to it as “Takoma Mamas.” We just call it the Facebook group. (I know this example doesn’t help make the case that I’m young and cool, but you get it, right?).\n\nThat being said, if it doesn’t work for you as a reader, that’s totally fine."
