        "text": "Overview\n\nWhat If It’s Us is a 2019 young adult coming-of-age novel by Becky Albertalli and Adam Silvera. It is set in New York and centers on the chance encounter between Arthur and Ben. Both authors’ debut novels came out in the same week, and their interactions led to the creation of this novel. Albertalli’s novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda (2015) was adapted into the film Love, Simon and won the William C. Morris Award from the American Library Association. She has also written six other novels, including three in the “Simonverse.” Silvera is most known for They Both Die at the End (2017) and its prequel, The First to Die at the End (2022). They Both Die at the End was a New York Times bestseller and received starred reviews from Booklist, Publishers Weekly, and Kirkus Reviews. In 2021, it also received the Flicker Tale Children’s Book Award for Older Readers. What If It’s Us has a sequel, titled Here’s To Us, written in 2021.\n\nThis guide refers to the first edition published by HarperTeen, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers, in 2018.\n\nContent Warning: The source material features depictions of threats levied against gay teenagers.\n\nPlot Summary\n\nTold in alternating chapters between Arthur Seuss and Ben Alejo’s perspectives, the novel opens on July 9 in New York City. In the city for the summer from Georgia, Arthur runs an errand for his internship at his mother’s law firm when he spots an attractive boy going into the post office. The boy is holding a box and soon reveals it’s full of his ex-boyfriend’s possessions. Arthur suggests that the universe wanted them to meet so that Arthur could tell him to throw it out. A flash mob breaks out, and the other boy disappears without Arthur catching his name.\n\nAfter the post office, Ben goes to his friend Dylan’s house to discuss Ben’s ex, Hudson. Dylan confesses that he’s met a new girl, though Ben is skeptical since Dylan has a history of moving quickly through girls.\n\nMeanwhile, Arthur starts to try to find Ben. He has a piece of the shipping label from Ben’s box and thinks his name might be Hudson. His group chat with his friends is active as he recounts his attempts to find the cute boy, but his friend Ethan won’t return the texts sent exclusively to him.\n\nBen is in summer school and so is his ex. When he tries to make conversation with him, Hudson ignores Ben.\n\nBoth Arthur and Ben check the Missed Connections page on Craigslist to see if they each posted something about the other. At Panera, however, on July 11, Arthur spots a Hudson and gets a last name, wondering if this is the mysterious boy’s ex. Soon, Arthur’s friend Jessie finds Hudson on Instagram. Remembering that the other boy was wearing a shirt from a local coffee shop, Arthur resolves to put up a flyer, and soon after, Ben emails him, and they make plans to go on a date.\n\nTheir first date is at Dave & Buster’s, though Arthur quickly senses that Ben isn’t having a good time. He confesses that he is preoccupied, and they agree to go out again for a “do-over.” Arthur plans it this time, and they go to a fancy restaurant, which also makes Ben uncomfortable because his parents aren’t very wealthy. They try another do-over and go for a walk in Central Park, but Hudson comes up in conversation, and Arthur is frustrated. However, they go for a fourth do-over at karaoke, and Arthur has his first kiss. They agree to a second date.\n\nArthur tells Ben about his love of the play Hamilton, and Ben shares that he is writing a novel. Arthur asks to read it, and Ben sends it to him. On another date, they cuddle on the train, but a man tells them to stop and threatens Ben, since he doesn’t think two boys should do that in a public place. This scares Arthur, since he always thought New York would be accepting of his sexual orientation. Shaken, he allows Ben to bring him home, where Ben meets his parents for the first time. In return, Ben’s family invites Arthur for dinner the next day. Arthur still does not know that Hudson is in summer school with Ben, so Ben tries telling him but fails.\n\nShortly after, Ben enters the Hamilton lottery and wins, but he arrives too late to pick up his tickets, frustrating Arthur since he is never on time. Ben vows to do better. When they are next alone at Ben’s apartment, they start to have sex but stop because Arthur is not ready.\n\nTwo days later, at summer school, Hudson asks Ben if they can talk, and Ben agrees to meet him after class. However, Arthur is waiting outside to surprise Ben, and he is shocked when Hudson comes over. He accuses Ben of cheating on him with Hudson and breaks up with him. On his way home, Arthur is FaceTimed by his friends, who reveal they are dating but have kept it secret for two months. Arthur hangs up.\n\nArthur pretends to be sick so he doesn’t have to go to work, and his mother tries to comfort him. When he accuses her of keeping her and his dad’s impending divorce from him, she calls his dad, and they explain that they aren’t getting divorced. They suggest that maybe he should also let Ben explain.\n\nBen is similarly miserable and says, in front of Dylan’s new girlfriend, that no relationship lasts. He yells at Dylan for always putting his significant others first and leaves. Ben ends up meeting up with Hudson and Dylan’s ex-girlfriend Harriett, who listen to him talk about Arthur. He’s starting to feel like he has friends outside of Dylan again, though he is confident they will reconcile.\n\nOn August 4—Arthur’s birthday—Dylan’s girlfriend calls Ben and says Dylan is in the hospital. Ben rushes there, but the subway ceases to a halt while he’s on it. Panicked, he texts Arthur because he wants to hear from him, and Arthur comforts him until he gets to the hospital. When he arrives, Dylan is okay; it was just a panic attack. He tells Ben to get Arthur, but Arthur is already waiting in the lobby for him.\n\nBack together, Arthur and Ben go back to Arthur’s apartment, where his parents are both out of town for work. However, Arthur’s dad calls with a surprise, and Arthur’s friends from home are in town for the night. They have a birthday party for Arthur. The next night, Arthur and Ben sleep together. Ben also calls for a meeting with Harriett, Hudson, and Dylan so that they can reconcile. He knows it’s not perfect, but it’s a start.\n\nArthur helps Ben study for his final summer school exam. He doesn’t want to go home. They finally discuss what happens after Arthur leaves and agree to break up. The next day, Arthur’s last in New York, Ben leaves him a series of clues around the city, bringing him back to the post office where they first met. They agree to stay in touch, and Ben gives him a “best friend box” (414).\n\nIn the Epilogue, Arthur ends up going to Wesleyan University. He is more confident and has relationships of varying seriousness with several boys. Having passed his summer school exam and proceeded to college the following year, Ben does not date anyone else but posts his novel online. He is grateful for Arthur’s encouragement, as the two have stayed close via phone calls. He wonders what the future holds for them."
