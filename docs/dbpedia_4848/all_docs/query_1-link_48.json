        "text": "How do you keep things fresh at events? Whether you're the event organizer, attending, or, like us, filming. What are some ways you keep things from feeling stale? We've been collaborating with the Napa Chamber of Commerce for just shy of 8 years now. They are without a doubt some of the most fantastic people and it's been a privilege to work with them to tell stories about the Napa Business community. Over the next little while we're going to share videos we've made together. I hope you'll watch, enjoy, and maybe drop us a note or two about your experiences with all these great people in our little town.
