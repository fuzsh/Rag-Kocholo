        "text": "A new series of Top Gear will get underway on Sunday 17 February at 8pm, with Matt LeBlanc, Chris Harris and Rory Reid primed for five hour-long episodes. LeBlanc has confirmed that series 26 will be his last, with Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff and Take Me Out presenter Paddy McGuinness in the driving seat for the next series, likely to hit our screens in 2020. Here, we introduce the new presenters and take you through a gallery of previous hosts, including Noel Edmonds, Jeremy Clarkson and Chris Evans.\n\nHere, we introduce the latest presenters and look back at over 40 years of the BBC’s premier motoring show.\n\nAndrew Flintoff\n\nAshes winner Andrew ‘Freddie’ Flintoff said: “It’s not often you have the chance to do both of your dream jobs, but I’m now lucky enough to say I will have.\n\n“I’ve always been passionate about cars and I’m so excited to be joining the Top Gear team.”\n\nPaddy McGuinness\n\nComedian Paddy McGuinness said: “To be hosting a show I’ve watched and loved from being a small boy is beyond exciting. Top Gear fans worldwide are a passionate bunch and I consider myself one of them.\n\n“Now’s let’s start up this Great British machine and see what I can do.”\n\nIn the meantime, here are some presenters from Top Gear’s past.\n\nAngela Rippon – 1977 – 1979\n\nBack in 1977, Angela Rippon was a broadcaster and motoring correspondent for the AA. Hard to believe now, but back then, Top Gear was a monthly 30-minute show, broadcast only in the Midlands. The BBC liked what they saw and moved the regional show to the network in 1978. Angela Rippon takes the honour of being the very first presenter of Top Gear.\n\nBarrie Gill – 1978 – 1979\n\nBarrie Gill was a motor racing commentator for BBC Grandstand and presenter of Top Gear between 1978 and 1979. Sadly, Barrie died in 2003.\n\nNoel Edmonds – 1979 – 1980\n\nNoel Edmonds arrived in 1979 and subsequently replaced Angela Rippon as the main presenter in 1980. It’s worth checking out his review of the Fiat Strada, which was so critical, it led to Fiat threatening to sue the BBC. Remember, this was 1980 BC – Before Clarkson.\n\nJudith Jackson – 1979 – 1982\n\nJudith Jackson also arrived in 1979 and went on to feature in a total of 16 episodes until 1982. But that’s nothing compared to the next female presenter on our list…\n\nSue Baker – 1980 – 1991\n\nSue Baker presented well over 100 episodes of Top Gear between 1980 and 1991, driving hundreds of cars in the process. Today, Sue remains at the forefront of motoring journalism.\n\nFrank Page – 1980 – 1988\n\nThis was a golden era for Top Gear in its original format. Back then, the likes of Sue Baker, Frank Page and the following two presenters were household names in Britain…\n\nChris Goffey – 1981 – 1997\n\nTake Chris Goffey, a seasoned pro with a style very much in keeping with the tone of the original format. Sky News approached Chris Goffey for his views of the ‘fracas’ involving a certain Jeremy Clarkson.\n\nWilliam Woollard – 1981 – 1991\n\nAh, one of the all-time greats of Top Gear. To many, William Woollard was the very best Top Gear presenter of all-time, complete with famous one-foot-on-the-bumper pose. He arrived in 1981, having made his name on the popular Tomorrow’s World.\n\nTom Boswell – 1981 – 1990\n\nTom Boswell presented two episodes in 1981 and 1982, before appearing in 20 episodes between 1988 and 1990, specialising in safety and motorcycles. He died in 1990.\n\nPeter Burgess – 1985 – 1986\n\nPeter Burgess is one of our own, being chairman of Motoring Research, as well as contributing to MSN. Peter appeared in seven episodes between 1985 and 1986.\n\nRussell Bray – 1986\n\nMotoring journalist Russell Bray presented three episodes of Top Gear in 1986, referencing it on his LinkedIn profile as ‘brief presenting stint on Top Gear (who hasn’t) an eon ago while a junior journo’. Back in the days when a ‘tache was required for aspiring motoring journos.\n\nMalcolm Wilson – 1986 – 1994\n\nMalcolm Wilson is a former world rally driver and head of the Ford World Rally Team. He also appeared in 14 episodes of Top Gear between 1986 and 1994.\n\nTony Mason – 1986 – 1998\n\nFormer rally co-driver Tony Mason was also a regular presenter on Top Gear, often wheeled out to remote forests to deliver rally reports in the dead of night. Tony appeared in 128 episodes between 1986 and 1998.\n\nTiff Needell – 1987 – 2001\n\nFormer F1 driver Tiff Needell burst onto the scene in 1987, closely followed by a cloud of tyre smoke. When Top Gear was cancelled in 2001, Tiff jumped ship to present Fifth Gear on Channel 5. But that wasn’t before he was able to deliver a memorable feature involving the Ford Puma and Messrs Clarkson and Willson.\n\nJon Bentley – 1988 – 1997\n\nJon Bentley is perhaps best known for presenting The Gadget Show, but he was also a presenter of Top Gear between 1988 and 1997. He’s also a former Top Gear presenter and series editor.\n\nBeki Adam – 1988 – 1990\n\nToday, Beki Adam runs a small business in Sussex and stood for parliament as an independent in the 2015 General Election. Back in the late 80s, Beki also enjoyed a short run on Top Gear. On her YouTube channel, Beki mentions a disagreement about a poncho, with the producers believing she should wear a Puffa jacket. As you can see, Beki won the argument.\n\nJeremy Clarkson – 1988 – 2000 and 2002 – 2015\n\nWithout question the most famous Top Gear presenter… in the world. Clarkson’s first stint on Top Gear began in 1988 and continued until 2000. In the early days, his hair was big and he spoke in a classic BBC style. As the years went by, he became more outspoken and helped to transform the show into a global phenomenon.\n\nQuentin Willson – 1991 – 2000\n\nIn the early 90s, Quentin Willson was quite the star on Top Gear, famously appearing alongside Clarkson and Needell. He quit in 2002 and recently appeared alongside Jodie Kidd in The Classic Car Show.\n\nNicky Fox – 1991 – 1992\n\nHands up if you remember Nicky Fox? Nicky appeared in six episodes between 1991 and 1992. Not to be confused with Sam Fox. We don’t think she ever presented Top Gear.\n\nJanet Trewin – 1991 – 1995\n\nAnother name you may have forgotten, although Janet Trewin did present a total of nine episodes in the early 90s. Today, Janet works as a freelance reporter, presenter, producer and presenter. She was also the first female presenter for Radio 1’s Newsbeat. We bet you didn’t know that.\n\nSteve Berry – 1993 – 1999\n\nSteve Berry is a broadcaster and presenter with a long and varied career in television and radio. Steve presented Top Gear between 1993 and 1999, as well as the short-lived Top Gear Radio Show on BBC Radio Five Live.\n\nMichele Newman – 1993 – 1998\n\nMichele Newman arrived from a career in local news and presented Top Gear between 1993 and 1998. She later went on to co-present Pulling Power on ITV, where she appeared alongside the likes of James Allen and Mike Rutherford.\n\nRussell Bulgin – 1994\n\nRussell Bulgin was one of the best motoring writers of all-time. Most people will have forgotten that he also appeared in three episodes of Top Gear in 1994.\n\nAndy Wilman – 1994 – 2001\n\nYes, that Andy Wiman. Today, Wilman is best known for being the show’s executive producer and the man credited with re-inventing and reinvigorating Top Gear. He also appeared in a total of 36 episodes between 1994 and 2001.\n\nVicki Butler-Henderson – 1994 – 2001\n\nVicki Butler-Henderson was another Top Gear presenter who would jump ship to Channel 5. But that wasn’t before she presented 108 episodes between the years of 1994 and 2001. Today, Vicki can still be seen on television, with Fifth Gear currently showing on Quest.\n\nJulia Bradbury – 1998 – 1999\n\nThe late 90s and early 00s saw a period in which Top Gear experimented with a number of different presenters. Julia Bradbury arrived in 1998, but didn’t hang about too long. Later, Julia would go on to present Watchdog and Countryfile, but that’s not before she went topless in front of James May…\n\nKate Humble – 1999 – 2000\n\nYes, Kate Humble really did spend some time presenting Top Gear. In fact, Kate appeared in 31 episodes between 1999 and 2000.\n\nJames May – 1999 and 2003 – 2015\n\nJames May appeared alongside Julia Bradbury in 1999 and famously sported a much shorter haircut. He returned in 2003 to help front the show with Jeremy Clarkson and Richard Hammond. From that point on, there was no stopping them. At least there wasn’t until the steak incident…\n\nBrendan Coogan – 1999\n\nSteve Coogan is often linked with the Top Gear job, but his brother actually got there first. He appeared in 1999, before a drink-driving conviction cut short his Top Gear career. He also appeared on Men & Motors, former home of Richard Hammond.\n\nAdrian Simpson – 2000 – 2001\n\nBlimey, Adrian Simpson presented a total of 35 episodes in 2000 and 2001 and was one of the last presenters to appear before Top Gear settled on the three amigos. A case of what might have been for Adrian?\n\nJason Barlow – 2000 – 2002\n\nMotoring journalist Jason Barlow appeared on the show between 2000 and 2002. Top Gear was officially cancelled in 2001, but Jason Barlow presented a one-off show from the 2002 Birmingham Motor Show. Other TV highlights include Channel Four’s Driven and BBC2’s Wrong Car, Right Car.\n\nJason Dawe – 2002\n\nJason Dawe presented Top Gear for a single series in 2002. Positioned very much as the used car specialist, Jason was being primed as the third piece in the Top Gear jigsaw. It didn’t work out for Jason and he was replaced by James May for the 2003 season.\n\nRichard Hammond – 2002 – 2015\n\nRichard Hammond enjoyed a career on BBC local radio and Men & Motors before making his Top Gear debut in 2002. He was ever-present before the actions of Clarkson prompted a move to Amazon Prime.\n\nThe Stig – 2002 – present\n\nYes, it’s The Stig. Can we really call a mute and faceless racing driver a presenter? Well he has been a permanent fixture of Top Gear since 2002, so we can’t leave him out. Perry McCarthy was outed as the original black Stig and Ben Collins took over in 2003. The current Stig – introduced in 2010 – has so far managed to remain anonymous.\n\nChris Evans – 2016\n\nChris Evans was the much-hyped marquee signing following the incident with the steak, but things didn’t go entirely according to plan. He quit after one disastrous series, with the show recording its lowest audience figures since the return of Clarkson in 2002.\n\nMatt LeBlanc – 2016 – 2019\n\nIn 2016, the American actor best known for playing the role of Joey Tribbiani in Friends became the first non-British host of Top Gear. Following Chris Evans’ departure, LeBlanc became the show’s anchorman, although he doesn’t look anything like Ron Burgundy. LeBlanc will leave the show in 2019.\n\nChris Harris – 2016 – present\n\nChris Harris is well-known to car enthusiasts, having written for a number of magazines and appeared in hundreds of YouTube videos, notching up millions of views.\n\nRory Reid – 2016 – present\n\nRory Reid made his debut presenting the online spin-off show, Extra Gear, before becoming a Top Gear presenter in series 24.\n\nSabine Schmitz – 2016 – present\n\nSabine is a German racer who grew up just 300m from the Nürburgring and cut her TV presenting teeth on German TV. The ‘Queen of the Nürburgring made regular appearances on Top Gear before becoming a presenter following the departure of Clarkson, Hammond and May.\n\nEddie Jordan – 2016 – present\n\nEddie Jordan is the former racing driver and F1 team owner with a penchant for brightly-coloured trousers. He also plays in a band called Eddie & The Robbers, named after a remark Bernie Ecclestone once made about the Irishman."
