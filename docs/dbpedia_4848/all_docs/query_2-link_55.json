Please forgive any errors.)\n\nMelanie Cofield\n\nGood morning, everyone. My name is Melanie Cofield, and I am a white queer woman with short grayish brown hair, wearing glasses, and a blue button -up shirt. My pronouns are she /they. I welcome this opportunity to share a bit about my experience participating in First UU Small Group Ministries.\n\nI’ll start by sharing a little of my background. Due to experiences of judgment and exclusion in churches of my youth, I have been long estranged from organized religion. During the COVID pandemic, I found welcome, comfort, hope, and peace in the online services provided by First UU of Austin. And I joined as a member with my wife in 2022.\n\nAs someone working in higher education my entire career, and relatively new to Unitarian Universalism, a logical first step for me as a new church member was to learn more about the foundations of this religious tradition.\n\nI attended a membership information class and someone mentioned the opportunity to join a wellspring group focused on the six UU sources. So I signed up excited about a new learning adventure. Now I expected to learn about the history and foundations of Unitarian Universalism But I was surprised and moved to learn so much about myself and to connect so deeply with my fellow wellspring group members.\n\nMy spiritual life has been firmly grounded in a primal reverence for nature since childhood. And it has been a solitary, private, and somewhat haphazard pursuit for most of my years. Participating in wellspring groups has helped me deepen and fine-tune my spirituality and expand my spiritual circle. Put another way in borrowing the pragmatic motto of Unitarian Minister Reverend Mary Safford of the Iowa Sisterhood in the late 1800s, I’m learning to lengthen the cord and strengthen the stakes. Let me share some highlights from my Wellspring takeaways with you in hopes that it will inspire you to consider participation in the future. I’m pursuing deep reflection and practicing deep listening. I’m developing intentional spiritual practices. I have found a vocabulary for alter articulating my spirituality.\n\nI’m reconnecting with my creativity And I’ve both recognized and discovered new sources of wisdom and inspiration that feed my soul. I’m slowly but tangibly letting go of self -consciousness and self -doubt in my spiritual endeavors.\n\nAnd I’m moving from an exclusively solo spirituality to one based on trust and connection and community. Finally, I found space to build resilience and hope in a chaotic and despairing world. After joining that first Wellspring Sources group, I wasn’t ready for the experience to end, so I lengthened my cord and volunteered to co-facilitate a Wellspring Deep Questions program focused on the eight principles of Unitarian Universalism.\n\nThis coming year, I’m delighted to continue serving the first UU community by co-facilitating and exploring a new program in the Wellspring Curriculum called Love at the Center, UU Values and Covenants. My experience has been profound and I encourage others to explore the gift of these small group ministries offered by First UU and consider participating. We hope to see you there. Thank you for listening and have a wonderful day.\n\nJim Scott\n\nGood morning. My name is John Scott and I’m a relatively new member here. My pronouns are he /him. I started attending here about two and a half years ago online, shortly after my father died. And I very unexpectedly, found myself, after about 30 years of not going to church, feeling like I wanted to belong to something like a church. So I started kind of looking around, seeing what was available, and what might feel welcoming to me, and gradually found my way here. So after attending online for several months, I began to feel ready to meet people and kind of be more engaged with the community.\n\nAnd I love being a student. It’s one of my favorite things. So I thought, well, I’ll look for adult education opportunities. And I went online on the website and found my way to adult education and the Wellspring program. And it just sounded perfect for me, especially because when I was clicking around on the website, I found something that looked a lot like a syllabus. And there was like a reading list and homework assignments, and I thought, you know, this is for me. So I signed up. I signed up for Wellspring. And Two years later here. I am talking about wellspring This year we’re offering love at the center, and that’s the one that Melanie was just talking about That’s a foundational course for people who have not taken a wellspring program before so it’s For everyone in other words and plus it’s brand new so even if you have taken wellspring before You might just be interested in that because it’s new.\n\nBut then there’s also a second program called Spiritual Practices, and this one is for people who have already taken Wellspring in the past, a Wellspring Sources program. So I know there’s a group that’s just finishing Wellspring Sources. There are people that have taken it in years past, and this Spiritual Practices program would be especially for you because it’s one of the second year programs that we offer through Wellspring.\n\nSo just a little bit about how the groups work. We meet here twice a month in the church in the classrooms. It’ll be first and third Wednesday evenings from 7 to 9 p .m. We put the chairs in a little circle, put a stool in the middle with a candle on it as our chalice, do a brief check -in with each other just to see how we’re doing that day, how our spiritual practice is going. And then we spend most of the time reflecting on questions together. So about two weeks before we meet, the facilitators send out an email with things, and little video clips to watch, and about five or six questions to review. And for me, it would only take me maybe an hour, hour and a half over that two week period to do the homework and make notes in my journal about the reflection question.\n\nSo it’s a little bit of homework, but it didn’t feel like overly burdensome at all. And then when we’re together, twice a month, we go through those questions one at a time using Parker Palmer’s Circles of Trust. So I brought Parker Palmer’s book. It’s a really good process where when someone shares what they’ve reflected on, the rest of the group just holds that in sacred silence, just kind of deep listening. And the basic guideline is that there’s no fixing, no changing, no advising, and no setting each other straight.\n\nSo it’s not like a normal conversation. You’re deeply listening to each other, deeply sharing from your heart, and I really found this to be so helpful and nourishing. And it’s a great way to learn how to just be present with each other, which is ultimately maybe the most valuable thing we can offer to each other, is just being present with each other. So after that first year of Wellspring Sources, and Melanie was one of my colleagues, the group decided to stay together for a whole second year and do the Deep Questions program, which we just just a couple of months ago. So I think that speaks to how meaningful we all found the experience that we really bonded and we wanted to stay together a whole second year. And I just wanna give a brief shout out to my wellspring siblings, ’cause now I think of them as my siblings. So Jenny, I saw Jenny over there, and Carrie, Amy, and Melanie, Sharon, Stephanie, Aaron, AJ, and Eric. So they’re my siblings now and I look forward to having more siblings after this coming year from Wellspring. There are descriptions that I brought. If you like the syllabus like I do, I brought some of those so you can find me and I’d be happy to share those. And they will also be on the website. If you go to learning and and adults, you’ll find information about Wellspring.\n\nToni Wegner\n\nGood morning. I’m Toni. I use she /her pronouns. I’m on the other side of middle age and I’m wearing a summery dress and sensible shoes. Regardless of what my record may suggest I did not join this church just to be on committees. I’m delighted to be here today because small group ministries are what nourish my soul.\n\nI spent two years in wellspring up until the pandemic and I highly recommend the program for those who can make the time of commitment. I continue to zoom the spiritual advisor I had during that program. She was a lifeline during the pandemic and currently in my transition to retirement. I participated in Chalice Circles for a couple of years before Wellspring and for the past two years.\n\nWe currently use the Soul Matters curriculum which has themes each month that tie into the themes for the sermons and into RE, themes like renewal, mystery, generosity, heritage. We get a package of materials two to four weeks in advance that have readings and quotes, video links, spiritual You can pick you pick one spiritual exercise and one question to talk about when the chalice circle meets once a month And you can even make up your own question It’s very flexible with lots of options to choose from and you can spend as little or as much time on the packet As you’d like so there doesn’t have to be a big-time commitment It’s a fun and interesting curriculum that challenges you to think and to feel, I personally was definitely on the shorter time commitment end.\n\nThe group I met with was on Zoom, which I found very convenient, but other groups meet in person, which also have positives. Many of the activities have been creative and interesting, like identifying a family memento that has a hold on you or realizing your mother saved nothing, taking a weird walk, doing something generous while remaining anonymous, making a list of delights in your life, taking quizzes on our political misperceptions, or exploring how each of the homes you lived in has shaped and helped create you. I came away from each of the exercises and questions with insights about myself, some positive or comforting, others not so much, but always feeling like I had a better understanding of why I am the way I am.\n\nIn the chalice circle, after an opening reading and check-in, each person has the opportunity to talk about the exercise they did and the question they answered. This is completely without interruption, usually three to four minutes each, so very similar format to Wellspring. After everyone has had a chance to share, there’s a brief period for responses and reflections, again following Parker Palmer’s no fixing, saving, advising, or setting each other straight.\n\nHere’s what I loved. I loved that even at this age I am learning things about myself that feel important, that I can talk about things that I have ever talked about with anyone else in my life, with full confidence of confidentiality, that all of us share things that make us vulnerable, and in doing so, we form a deep bond. And that I feel a deeper connection to members of the first UU community than I would have ever felt through coffee hour or committees. We had an end of year child event in June where people from all the different childless circles got together to share reflections on the program.\n\nAnd having gone through the program, I felt a bond with many of these people, even though I had never met some of them before. People overwhelmingly enjoyed the curriculum, which has something for everyone. There were also lots of positive comments about the value of having uninterrupted time to talk with others listening, the practice of deep listening, and the bonding that comes from this depth of sharing.\n\nI’m really glad that our church offers these small group ministries and hope that everyone looking to make connections or go deeper will consider signing up this year. You commit a couple of hours a month and you get a lot of nourishment for that. For those who are skeptical, as most you use are, I hope you’ll consider participating in a taste of soul after church on August 4th or 11th to let you see what this experience will be like.\n\nCheck the newsletter for more information. Finally, I haven’t mentioned yet that I was a co-facilitator last year and will be one again this year. Why do I co-facilitate? Well, pragmatically, the more facilitators we have, the more spaces available for people to participate. Also, you get to pick when and where the group will meet, so that’s kind of a plus, hence online. There’s a really good two -hour online training and opportunities to meet with other facilitators and other than that facilitating takes like less than 15 minutes a month more than participating. So you can facilitate even if it’s your first chalice circle. And I was a co-facilitator getting to work with and to know my co-facilitator has been a highlight of my last year, so please consider it. I hope that I get to know you better in a chalice circle someday.\n\nExtinguishing the Chalice\n\nWe extinguish this flame, but not the light of truth, the warmth of community, or the fire of commitment. These we hold in our hearts until we are together again.\n\nBenediction\n\nAs we go back out into our world today, may we carry with us the love of this, our beloved religious community.\n\nMay we center our lives in love, just as we center our faith in love. May the melody flowing through our souls be a river of love that carries us forward until next we gather our spirits again.\n\nAmen and Blessed Be. Go in peace.\n\nSERMON INDEX\n\nMost sermons during the past 24 years are available online through this website.

Michelle LaGrave and Guest Speakers\n\nJuly 21, 2024\n\nFirst UU Church of Austin\n\n4700 Grover Ave., Austin, TX 78756\n\nwww.austinuu.org\n\nWho is Reproductive Justice for? Why does it matter to you if you don’t have a uterus, or you are a woman past reproductive age? We will hear from four speakers who are committed to the fight for Reproductive Justice, including abortion health care but also much more. What does Reproductive Justice mean to all of us?” How can we engage and live our UU faith to build the Beloved Community?\n\nChalice Lighting\n\nThis is the flame we hold in our hearts as we strive for justice for everyone. This is the light we shine upon systems of oppression until they are no more. This is the warmth that we share with one another as our struggle becomes our salvation.\n\nCall to Worship\n\nTHE RIGHT TO CHOOSE\n\nby Elizabeth Mount\n\nTo begin, to start, to create, to undertake,\n\nTo grow, to promise, to increase, to generate.\n\nAll these are our birthright.\n\nAs we are created, so may we create.\n\nThe ability and the choice to create is sacred.\n\nTo withdraw that chance from any person without their permission\n\nWould be a violent act, the cutting off of life itself.\n\nAnd yet, as precious is the right to simply not.\n\nTo end, to terminate, to stop, to discontinue,\n\nTo rest, to hibernate, to impede, to prevent.\n\nThese, too, are our birthright.\n\nFor without consent, our ability to create\n\nbecomes not a blessing, but a burden and an imposition.\n\nWithout space for a “no,” there can be no trustworthy “yes.”\n\nToday, we come to this holy place and time,\n\nReady to invoke the divine, to make space for the sacred,\n\nTo co-create community once again.\n\nThis too is a choice,\n\nyou cannot, you may not,\n\nbe coerced into relationship with the holy or with one another.\n\nI invite you, I ask you to join us.\n\nI respect it if you will not, today, or ever.\n\nMore sacred than any other individual need, is Choice,\n\nThe right to know oneself.\n\nThe right to know what you are ready for,\n\nwhat you need, to stretch when you can,\n\nto pause when you will,\n\nto know your body, your mind, your spirit better than anyone else.\n\nAnd ultimately,\n\nto be trusted with the responsibility of your own living.\n\nAffirming Our Mission\n\nTogether we nourish souls, transform lives, and do justice to build the Beloved Community.\n\nReading\n\nREVOLUTIONARIES ARE EVERYDAY PEOPLE\n\nBy Linci Comy\n\nThe whole point about revolution\n\nIs seeing the things that are intolerable\n\nAnd insisting on making change\n\nAnd it takes everyday people to do that\n\nThe people in power, they don’t want change\n\nThey don’t want to see it\n\nIt’s the everyday people\n\nThat are the revolutionaries\n\nYou don’t wake up one day and\n\nSuddenly have this revolutionary fervor\n\nThat you’re going to turn the world upside down\n\nOne day you wake up and realize\n\nThat you’re just not going to do\n\nThe same thing again and again and again and\n\nExpect a different outcome\n\nAnd that you’re going to start to feel in your soul\n\nWhat place you want to live in\n\nWhere you want to be\n\nAnd you’re going to start to create that\n\nWith your community\n\nSo revolutionary fervor is really just that\n\nGreat space of change\n\nAnd transition\n\nThat we learn to feel\n\nRevolutionary people\n\nThat’s just the We\n\nWe the people\n\nThat’s the revolutionary you see\n\nSo welcome to the world\n\nJust open your eyes\n\nAnd revolution grows\n\nThat’s how we change\n\nEverything we know\n\nCentering\n\nHOLDING REALITY AND POSSIBILITY TOGETHER\n\nby Sam Trumbore\n\nWhat an unearned blessing to delight in the calming peace of this space;\n\nto hear the bird’s [robin’s] song again at daybreak;\n\nto feel the warmth in this room,\n\nand to enjoy the promise of summer [almost] upon us.\n\nEach moment of wakefulness has so many gifts that offer energy and delight.\n\nYet, too often they seem unavailable\n\nas the weight of our troubles press down on us.\n\nThe threats to our well being, real or exaggerated,\n\nfeel like mosquitoes in the night looking for a place to land.\n\nMinds become captive to rising flood waters: forceful, murky, threatening and ominous.\n\nEven in moments of great danger, the direction of attention is a choice.\n\nFear can dominate the mind, binding it like a straitjacket.\n\nOr love can unbind it and open it to resource and opportunity.\n\nThe soil of the mind can be watered with kindness.\n\nThe thorns can be removed one by one to appreciate the buds ready to flower.\n\nGreat possibilities await us even if all we can see is the cliff before us.\n\nThe grandeur of life, of which we are a part,\n\nscatters rainbows in every direction, even as the deluge approaches.\n\nHolding reality and possibility together is the holy, hope-filled work of humanity\n\nIf … we choose it, again and again, in love.\n\nSermon\n\nElizabeth Gray, Reproductive Justice Social Action Chair\n\nPeople ask me: why are you so passionate about Repro Justice? They assume I’ve had an abortion, and this is personal. Well, no, I haven’t had an abortion. Although unintended pregnancies are very common, I’ve been fortunate: I haven’t had birth control fail, I haven’t been the victim of coercion, I haven’t been impregnated by rape or incest. But mostly: I got a late start.\n\nSo no, I haven’t had an abortion, but I’m passionate about this topic because I’ve experienced reproductive freedom. I know what a difference it made in my life, and I cannot fathom that we would not demand the same for all people.\n\nOne of the four tenets of repro justice: I have been able to choose to have children, and how many to have. And, a second tenet of repro justice, I’ve been able to raise those children in a safe and sustainable environment. That’s reproductive freedom.\n\nA third tenet of reproductive justice is the right to choose NOT to have children. And I know that if I HAD experienced an unwanted pregnancy, I would have been able to get an abortion. I had access to the procedure: the money, child care, ability to take time off, transportation,-everything you need to access this health care.\n\nThe last tenet of reproductive justice is the human right to maintain personal bodily autonomy. Now, that one strikes home. Pregnancy is not health neutral. Birth can be brutal and physically damaging. I experienced birth trauma with my first child, and I was left with a lifelong daily reminder, pelvic organ prolapse. I am by no means alone in this: I know that statistically, I share that that condition to at least some extent with half the women in this room who have given birth. Urinary incontinence, anybody?\n\nIn addition, during the labor and delivery I was subjected to medical procedures I did not want, and for three days after my son was born, I had a screaming baby I was determined to breast feed, but no breast milk. That wasn’t resolved until I was rushed to the hospital with post-partum hemorrhage due to, it was discovered, my placenta still abnormally attached to the uterine wall-no breast milk because my body thought I was still pregnant–I would have died without blood transfusions and medical intervention.\n\nThe birth of my second child also involved a life-threatening condition. My son Patrick, a very active child, was also evidently active in the womb: so much so that he wound the umbilical cord around his chest and was lodged sideways in my uterus. This is known as a transverse lie, and going into labor leads to serious complications-up to and including death of the mother or fetus. So I had a C-section, although that was also higher risk due to the position of the baby.\n\nDoes any of this sound familiar? The two years since Dobbs has been like a nationwide seminar in obstetrical emergencies. Well, even with those unexpectedly difficult encounters, I experienced reproductive freedom. I told my husband I was done having children, and it was abstinence or a vasectomy. He chose the latter, and I am not making this up: his urologist was Dr. Dick Chopp.\n\nSo no, I didn’t have an abortion, but I have experienced reproductive freedom, and everything that I am today – my whole life – is defined by that. Pregnancy, gestation, birth, lactation, and parenting – let’s not forget parenting – are all life- altering events. They have physical, emotional, and economic consequences. They are risks that require consent. No person should be forced into bearing a child they do not want.\n\nI hope my story illustrates that Repro Justice is not only for people who have had — or will need-an abortion. Repro Justice is for All. Of. Us. For women who may not ever experience an unwanted pregnancy, but still have to deal with other aspects of sexual health and self-determination, for trans folks who want to make choices about their bodies, for people with disabilities who have a right to desire, intimacy, and sexual pleasure. For women who have children, and the people who parent them. And for men. Today, in this service, RJ is about men too. First, it is personal for men. You men all know and likely love someone who had a baby or wants to have a baby or might get pregnant. You care about them; it affects you when they are denied their human rights.\n\nSecond, your body may not be under attack, but you deserve the right to control the future of your family. Just b/c the govt. isn’t controlling your body as a man, doesn’t mean the govt. isn’t also controlling you. What’s next? What other of your freedoms are at risk? You should get to make your own decisions. You are a stakeholder.\n\nAnd third, for the white men here or listening online: do you believe that you have an obligation to speak up on racism? For straight men, do you believe you have an obligation to speak up on homophobia? Yes, well, then this is the same thing. If one of us is oppressed, all of us are oppressed. Silence is consent. You need to be an ally.\n\nWe need to hear from men. We need to hear their personal stories about reproductive rights and justice and freedom. We need to hear them speak out publicly to call out bad actors, to refute the lies and misogyny pervading our society right now. We need them to speak up privately, with friends and family, to normalize discussion about reproductive health, reinforcing the behavior that we do say the word abortion. And menstruation. And infertility. And all the words we have stigmatized and silenced because they deal with reproduction and reproductive health.\n\nThis service is giving all of us the chance to step up. We have invited three people today to tell their stories of Reproductive Justice. First is Samuel Franco, Austin-based member of Men4Choice, a national organization dedicated to mobilizing male allies into the fight for self-determination and full control over our bodies.\n\nThen we will hear from Kelenne Blake, executive director of Black Mamas, ATX, the community partner the Reproductive Justice team here has chosen to support as part of our mission.\n\nAnd finally, Toga Pendrake, a member of our Repro Justice team, will read the anonymous account of a man in this congregation who works with a community network providing abortion medication to people in states with abortion bans. Thank you.\n\nSamuel Franco, Men4Choice\n\nMy name is Samuel Franco my pronouns are he/him and I’m here to speak on men for choice and thank you for saying those words because it is extremely important that we have male allies in this fight.\n\nI’ll start by telling you a little story my story Many years ago when I was a much younger man I had an abortion and I say those words not to take anything away from women or people who can get pregnant but to stand in solidarity with those that can get pregnant, and to normalize the conversation, to accept the fact that the role that men play in this conversation.\n\nMany years ago, when I was finishing up grad school, I met a young lady who was also finishing her studies in El Paso. That’s where I’m from. And we took a liking to each other, and we knew we were both going to leave El Paso afterwards. Well, shortly about two weeks after getting to Tulsa, Oklahoma, where I had moved to, she called me up and let me know that she was pregnant. So I rushed back to El Paso, not telling anybody in my family, no friends, nothing. Just me and her.\n\nGrowing up a Latino Catholic on the border, abortion is not something we talked about. It’s pretty much stigmatized. So we spent the weekend discussing our lives, our hopes, our dreams, where we were at, what we were going to do, and knowing that we weren’t going to be together, and what was best for us and best for that potential child. And we decided that was best for that potential child was not having that child. And that was best for us at that time. So Monday we went to the clinic and did what we had to do.\n\nI tell you this story because I was reminded of it a couple of years ago after Dobbs. And I was sitting there looking at social media and I saw all these protests and I thought to myself, wait a minute, why wasn’t I there? And then I remembered, “Oh, because I’m a heterosexual cisgendered male, and those algorithms are not for me.” Right?\n\nAnd so then I started looking around, and I thought to myself, “There’s got to be more men like me.” And that’s when I was introduced to Men4Choice. And so I want to talk to you a little bit about Men4Choice today. Men for choice was founded in 2015 with a mission to activate, educate, and mobilize male allies in the movement for reproductive rights.\n\nRecognizing that too many men have remained passive in this critical issue, Men For Choice aims to change that by engaging men as active partners and allies. The organization believes that reproductive freedom is a fundamental right and that everyone should have the autonomy to make decisions about their own bodies without interference. Men4Choice is unique in their strategic focus on young men, particularly those aged 18 through 25, through initiatives like their youth fellowship program. This program is designed to build a pipeline of well -trained allies who can influence and support reproductive rights both now and in the future.\n\nBy educating young men on the realities and impacts of reproductive laws, Men4Choice equips them with the knowledge and tools needed to become effective advocates. Their work is crucial for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, engaging men in the fight for reproductive rights helps dismantle the deeply ingrained misogyny and sexism that often drive restrictive laws and policies. By changing the culture from within, Men4Choice aims to create a more equitable society where everyone’s rights are respected.\n\nSecondly, the organization amplifies the voices and efforts of women and those directly affected by anti-choice legislation, providing much needed support and solidarity. Men4Choice has made significant strides by organizing educational events, mobilizing volunteers for on-the-ground actions, and running impactful digital campaigns. In conclusion, the work of Men4Choice is vital not only for financing reproductive rights, but also for fostering a culture of equity and respect.\n\nBy bringing men into the fold as allies, they help to build a stronger, more inclusive movement that can effectively challenge and change oppressive systems. I encourage everyone to learn more about men for choice and consider you can contribute to this essential cause.\n\nThank you\n\nKelenne Blake, Black Mamas ATX\n\nGood morning, everyone. My name is Kelene Blake. My voice is a little bit unusual, but maybe only a couple of people might recognize that. And I’m the executive director of Black Mamas ATX. So I’m gonna be a little softer than usual today, but I wanted to talk about reproductive justice from my perspective as a black woman who works in this field.\n\nNow specifically, pointed out so well, there are four parts to reproductive justice.\n\nThe ability to maintain bodily autonomy, that is huge.\n\nThe ability to have children,\n\nNot have children,\n\nAnd if you do have children, to be able to raise those children in safe and sustainable communities.\n\nThese are things that black women have been systematically deprived of from the inception of the United States project that we’re existing in. And what is interesting is that reproductive justice has been created by a black woman. And I first learned about reproductive justice not in birth and not related to abortion, But since the Supreme Court rolled back abortion rights, I’ve heard a lot more in, you know, communities that are not mine and specifically focused on abortion and that is really important. It has been an important catalyst for this change and for the awareness of this concept. However, this is a whole concept, and so I’m going to talk about some of the other aspects of it as well.\n\nSo, I learned about this first, when I would say about eight years ago, maybe not about a decade ago, when The black community in particular was coming to grips with how prevalent, or how, not really how prevalent, but how traumatic police brutality was becoming in our community, and how often we were literally seeing modern day lynchings of black community members through social media.\n\nHow does reproductive justice come in there? How did I first learn about it then? One studies show, especially from that time, one of the first things that a lot of people, you know, hear when they find out they’re pregnant, you know, they’re like, “Oh, is it a boy or a girl?” That’s the first thing they want to ask, right, or, you know, they’re excited, they’re enthusiastic. Black women asked often, is it a boy or a girl? And if they found out it was a boy, their hearts would sink. Because – Trayvon Martin – because of the many black boys and men that were experiencing state-sanctioned violence.\n\nNot to say black women were not, but as always, black women’s stories are not highlighted. But yes, so in this concept, the idea of safe, sustainable communities in which to raise your back boys and girls, is really important. No aspect of justice work is siloed or separate from the other aspects. It all is intertwined. And so it is really important to see this very necessary and valuable push to regain abortion rights in conjunction with all the other fights for justice and freedom and liberation of all the very different groups needing those same things.\n\nThe work that I do, we specifically work with folks who are pregnant and we provide doula support because If I’m going to be really honest, it feels very dangerous to be a pregnant black woman in a hospital giving birth or even with a midwife giving birth that that midwife is not black or birth center are any of these spaces and so Working with a doula you have someone who’s yes, they’re coaching you as the pregnant person through the birth But they’re also advocating for you and helping to prevent any dangers. And that is why they make such a difference.\n\nBut then, as part of reproductive justice, as part of helping black women and birthing folks survive and thrive, we also have to look at access to mental health support. We also have to help people pay their bills and rent. Last month, we had a mom who was about to be evicted with a newborn baby, and we had to work to get her into a space, so she has her own space to live. We have countless moms, and it’s increasing every month, who literally, their lights are getting shut off. They’re worried about their water getting shut off, right? And they’re pregnant and postpartum and have these newborns. This is part of that safe, sustainable community. We are having to build it kind of offline with our work as a small non-profit. But we need to be — we’re just plugging the gaps where we can.\n\nThis needs to be something that is accessible to everyone, everywhere, whether or not they know about Black Mamas ATX or one of our doulas could serve them. So that is my take on how we are working towards reproductive justice. We are in support of our brothers and sisters who are doing the hard and scary work of addressing abortion rights in Texas.\n\nThat is frightening. And whenever y’all need us, call us and we will be there to support you. I also want to be able to call you because there’s the everyday parts of it that’s happening as well that’s not as loud and not as not as I would say in the zeitgeist of the conversation you know so that is what I wanted to raise today as part of reproductive justice.\n\nThank you for hearing me out thank you for your attention and your kind faces as I’m up here a little nervous, but really appreciating your ear.\n\nToga Pendrake\n\nText unavailable at the writer’s request.\n\nExtinguishing the Chalice\n\nWe extinguish this flame, but not the light of truth, the warmth of community, or the fire of commitment. These we hold in our hearts until we are together again.\n\nBenediction\n\nGo in peace, with Love in your hearts, kindness on your lips, and compassion at your fingertips, blessing all others as you, yourselves, are now blessed.\n\nAmen and Blessed Be.\n\nSERMON INDEX\n\nMost sermons during the past 24 years are available online through this website.

Florence Caplow and Rev. Chris Jimmerson\n\nJuly 14, 2024\n\nFirst UU Church of Austin\n\n4700 Grover Ave., Austin, TX 78756\n\nwww.austinuu.org\n\nHow do we take care of ourselves in tough times, whether those tough times are personal or societal? How do we continue to show up for what we believe in when it is so easy to lose heart? In this service, our guest speaker Rev. Florence Caplow will share stories and practices from the Buddhist tradition for resilience and renewal in tough times.\n\nChalice Lighting\n\nThis is the flame we hold in our hearts as we strive for justice for everyone. This is the light we shine upon systems of oppression until they are no more. This is the warmth that we share with one another as our struggle becomes our salvation.\n\nAffirming Our Mission\n\nTogether we nourish souls, transform lives, and do justice to build the Beloved Community.\n\nReading\n\nWhen the The Vietnamese refugee boats met with storms or pirates if everyone panicked, all would be lost. But if even one person on the boat remained calm and centered, it was enough. It showed the way for everyone to survive. I am inviting you to go deeper, to learn and to practice so that you become someone who has a great capacity for being solid, calm, and without fear. Because our society needs people like you who have these qualities. And your children, our children, need people like you in order to go on, in order to become solid and calm and without fear.\n\n– Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nSermon\n\n(NOTE: This is an ai generated transcript. Please forgive any errors.)\n\nAlmost all of the people I know, It seems, are talking about this particular moment in our history and whether its challenges are unprecedented or not. On hiking trails and cafes, on a phone with each other, we are talking about this. Maybe you are too. Maybe you’re feeling dread or fear or confusion. How could this be happening? I know that you in Texas have weathered literally just this week both extraordinary heat and an unprecedented hurricane that caused massive power outages in your state that are continuing. And then there is the looming hurricane in our country, this upcoming election with all its uncertainties and even terrors. I personally am of the view that both climate change and what is happening politically, not just here, but around the world is indeed unprecedented.\n\nFor quite a while now, my own personal spiritual vow is to help in whatever way I can when the storms that seem to be on the way break over our heads.\n\nHow, how do we live in this time, engaged, brave, and like the person in the boat that Thich Nhat Hanh wrote about, tall enough somehow to help everyone around us survive. This is not about turning away or turning inward, but about each of us building our own capacity, both for societal challenges and for the challenges in our own lives, in our own communities, our own personal hurricanes.\n\nToday, I’d like to offer some possible ways, simple ways, as both a UU minister and a Buddhist teacher. And although these ways are informed by my Buddhist training, you do not have to be any kind of Buddhist to engage in them.\n\nMany centuries ago, a Zen student in China asked their teacher, “What is the fundamental teaching?”\n\nAnd the teacher replied, “An appropriate response.”\n\nWhat is the appropriate response right now in these strange and scary times? Well, I can’t tell you. It’s really for you to find out. But I don’t think it is turning away or tuning out with the latest Netflix series, although that can be a helpful break, nor do I think it is drowning in fear or anger. I think at times like these spiritual practices are essential so that we can engage.\n\nNow, I don’t really believe in giving advice, because honestly, who actually follows advice. But I’m going to break my own rule this morning and offer a little advice. Five spiritual practices for tough times. As you listen, see which one where maybe several of them really speaks to you. Even one of them could make a difference. Or consider what is already a spiritual practice for you, perhaps one you hadn’t even thought of as a spiritual practice.\n\nThe five spiritual practices I’d like to share this morning, very simple practices, are: pausing, appreciating, not knowing, staying together, and feeling your feet, with a little bonus practice at the end.\n\nSo first, and I think most importantly, find a way, or ways, to pause, to slow down, to rest, to feed your spirit. Many of us, maybe all of us, are moving so fast and so frantically, either in an attempt to survive economically or to address the wrongs around us, that spiritual practices become an afterthought or luxury. And the more we panic, speaking for myself, the more it may seem like we simply don’t have the time for spiritual practices.\n\nPlease don’t think of them as an afterthought. Think of them whatever they are or could be for you as a foundation, as essential in these times as drinking enough water. Maybe some of you feel like you’re running a And in a marathon, although honestly, I have never participated in a marathon, but this is what I hear you need to be sure to get enough water and pace yourself. Same with mountaineering, which I have done. Rest breaks are absolutely essential. When you get up into the high elevations for mountaineering, you actually have to rest with every step.\n\nAnd I’m more than half convinced that there are people out there who are trying to get us to never rest, never stop surfing of the net so that we won’t stop and think what is happening. Sometimes those of us who are Activists feel that we can’t rest, that the problems are so dire, we need to be doing whatever we can 24 /7. For you, us in that category, or anyone who overworks, I want to offer these provocative words by the late Trappist monk and writer, Thomas Merton.\n\nThere is a pervasive form of contemporary violence to which the idealist (that’s us) most easily sickens activism and overwork. The rush and pressure of modern life are a form, perhaps the most common form, of its innate violence. To allow oneself to be carried away by a multitude of conflicting concerns, to surrender to too many demands, to commit oneself to too many projects, to want to help everyone in everything, is to succumb to violence. It kills the root of inner wisdom which makes work fruitful.”\n\nOr as the Black activist and founder of NAP Ministry, Trisha Hershey writes,\n\n“Consider rest a radical act. Walk in the woods, cuddle with your loved one, or a dog, or a cat. Drink a cup of tea, Go to church on Sunday, go on retreat. Take a moment to breathe with awareness, just right now. Take in an in-breath, in an out-breath. And know that you are not turning away from the troubles of the world. You are strengthening yourself for the journey and the struggle.”\n\nIt’s said that Gandhi used to meditate for an hour a day but one day there was a big political action coming up and his followers said today is so busy that we won’t be meditating, right? Gandhi said today is so busy we will be meditating for two hours.\n\nMaybe you’re saying to yourself I can’t meditate. That’s just not my thing and certainly not for two hours. I am here to tell you that there is such a thing as homeopathic meditation. Even a moment of presence goes a very long way. Even a breath can be a moment of Sabbath and pause. It doesn’t take any special equipment. You always have it with you. It’s always available, even one breath.\n\nSo my first piece of advice to summarize, find a way, find ways to slow down and be present, whatever you call it. I promise you that your adrenal glands will thank you if no one else does. and probably others will thank you as well.\n\nAdvice number two, Appreciating. The harder and uglier things get, the more important this simple practice becomes. Yes, you have a right to some happiness, even when things are falling apart. The intentional practice of gratitude, of gratefulness, of appreciation, has been shown scientifically to increase baseline happiness, reduce pain and depression, lower stress, and improve sleep.\n\nThink about it, if we had a drug that did that with no side effects, it would be a runaway bestseller. And there are a thousand ways to practice this, or as Rumi said, to kneel and kiss the ground. But like most practices, it does not have to be elaborate. Two of the easiest practices are Sabering and Awe.\n\nSabering is to fully experience small pleasures and comforts like your morning coffee with tea or how it feels to get into bed after a long day to really notice and experience those things. And awe is our response to something vast or amazing, something seen, heard, or experienced. Awe can also arise from witnessing human kindness or greatness or courage.\n\nI am currently visiting a little town in the Roaring Fork Valley of western Colorado where I served as a minister a number of years ago, and all around me are mountain landscapes that easily evoke awe. And last night, I went to a performance at the Aspen Music Festival. And I heard a British cellist, Stephen Isserlis, play a long, long, long lost Haydn concerto for cello. As soon as he started to play, The grace of his playing, his ease brought me into intense presence, and his very obvious bliss and joy in the music as he played was contagious. I experienced bliss too and awe.\n\nBut appreciation doesn’t need to be so special. One of my favorite quotes is from the Reverend Howard Thurman, the founder of the first intentionally interracial church in America, the church for the fellowship of all peoples in San Francisco. And this is from his Thanksgiving prayer, which starts with these words.\n\nToday, I make my sacrament of Thanksgiving. I begin with the simple things of my days, fresh air to breathe, cool water to drink, the taste, the food, the protection of houses and clothes, the comforts of home. For all these, I make an act of Thanksgiving this day.\n\nAdvice number three, and this may seem strange to a bunch of UUs, but is it the heart of Zen and very helpful in hard times? Practice not knowing. What do I mean by that? Well, most of the time, we are so sure we know, and it certainly seems like a lot of people online or on the news programs know something as well. But our thoughts and their thoughts about the world and where it’s going can literally, literally drive us crazy, but they are just thoughts. And when we realize this, we can act with greater peace.\n\nThich Nhat Hanh used to tell his students to ask themselves always, “Am I sure, for instance, perhaps like you, I am sometimes filled with dread about our collective future?”\n\nBut the reality is, I don’t know the future. And no one does, not even the wisest pundit writing in the most prestigious publication, apologies to any pundits in the sanctuary. I can ask myself, am I sure, and then still act for what I believe in without being certain of the outcome? Give it to try. Practice.\n\nAnd this really comes from my UU tradition. Remember to stay together. Remember that you are not alone. What brought me to UU ministry was witnessing and being a beneficiary of the tremendous care and love even for strangers that can be expressed in a UU congregation. What actually brought me to UU ministry was stumbling into a congregation in Flagstaff, Arizona, sad and unwell and being embraced almost before they knew my name.\n\nCome to think of it, I experienced awe when that happened too. There is so much power and encouragement that comes from showing up for each other, Acting for the world standing in a picket line or marching for justice not alone, but together This is one of the many reasons that I think Progressive faith communities will matter all the more in the coming years Despite what the pundits say. We need each other. We can’t do this alone.\n\nI want to share a poem that has been important to me since my teen years, written by the great Zen beat poet Gary Snyder in 1959.\n\nFOR THE CHILDREN\n\nthe rising hills, the slopes,\n\nthe statistics\n\nlie before us,\n\nthe steep climb\n\nof everything going up\n\nup, as we all\n\ngo down.\n\nIn the next century,\n\nor the one beyond that,\n\nthey say\n\nour valleys, pastures,\n\nwe can meet there in peace\n\nif we make it.\n\nTo climb these coming crests,\n\none word to you,\n\nto you and your children.\n\nStay together.\n\nLearn the flowers. Go light.\n\nStay together. Learn the flowers. Go light.\n\nNumber five, the simplest of all. Pay attention to your feet. Pay attention to them right now. See how they are beneath you in contact with the floor connected to the earth. We spend so much time up in our heads. Meanwhile, our humble feet are supporting us all the time. To feel your feet is to feel your foundation, to quite literally ground yourself. Whether you’re standing in a grocery line, having an argument with your partner, or facing a line of oncoming police in a direct action, feeling your feet will bring you into your body, and in contact with the earth, which is always there, always supporting you, and which receives us all in the end.\n\nAnd on a lighter note, a little bonus advice. I promised you a bonus, from the great satirist Kurt Vonnegut. His last words of advice, who knows if anyone listened, to an audience in 2007. “And how should we behave during this apocalypse? We should be unusually kind to one another, certainly. But we should also stop being so serious. Jokes help a lot. And get a dog if you don’t already have one.”\n\nSo if one of these spiritual practices spoke to you, I invite you to bring it more fully into your life.\n\nAnd just to review, here are some simple spiritual practices for these tough times.\n\nPause\n\nAppreciate\n\nPractice not knowing\n\nStay together\n\nFeel your feet\n\nAnd don’t forget to laugh now and again.\n\nExtinguishing the Chalice\n\nWe extinguish this flame, but not the light of truth, the warmth of community, or the fire of commitment. These we hold in our hearts until we are together again.\n\nBenediction\n\nYou are not alone. You have generations of ancestors at your back. You have the blessings of interdependence and community. You have the great trees of the forest and steadfast allies. You have the turning of the seasons and the renewal of life as your music. You have the vast sky of emptiness to hold all things graciously. Now it is time to step forward, bringing your equanimity and courage, wisdom and compassion to the world,\n\n– Janet Cornfield\n\nSERMON INDEX\n\nMost sermons during the past 24 years are available online through this website.

So we are getting biblical this morning. One of the preachers mentioned Lot’s wife and shared that she is the most referenced woman from the scriptures in poetry, I think it was.\n\nLot’s wife has been sitting with me for months patiently waiting for her turn to teach us. Of course, it is Lot’s wife who is unnamed in the scriptures, but who in the Midrash, the wisdom of rabbis that supplements the Torah, is named as Edith. She is the one who breaks God’s instruction not to look back as she is fleeing from her home, which is being spectacularly destroyed, fleeing with her husband and their children who would leave, and for this she instantly becomes a pillar of salt.\n\nNow, that story begins with God expressing that there has been such an outcry from people that they cannot ignore that the twin cities of Sodom and Gomorrah had fallen into sinfulness, with the greatest sin, perhaps, being breaking the commandment to welcome the stranger, to love our neighbors, to be hospitable.\n\nTo assess the situation there, God sends two emissaries to the city, two of the same who had just visited Abraham and Sarah, who despite their ages are promised their own child. Abraham, just informed that he would be the father of nations despite being ancient, is told by God that Sodom is sinful, so they are preparing to make their way to Sodom, where one of Abraham’s nephews, Lot, lives.\n\nAbraham pleads with God, “What if there are 50 good people. What if there are only 45? Maybe there are only 40. What if there are only 30, 30 good people in the city? What if there are only 20? What if there are only 10. What if there are only 10 good people? And God says he will not destroy the city if 10 are good.\n\nThey arrive and Lot who has been at the gate welcomes them into his home. Initially the angels decline but Lot urges them to stay with him. They eat well, and as night falls, the home is surrounded by the men of the town, demanding that the two be sent out. Lot begs them to behave and offers his daughters instead, and the crowd gets angrier. They only stop banging at the door when the angels strike them blind, and they can no longer find it.\n\nThis story is often misconstrued as one condemning homosexuality, but it is not about that at all. It is about the inhospitality of the residents who have wealth and food in abundance. And somehow this has made them cruel instead of generous. It has become the practice of the men of the city to violently assault their visitors, which is why people cried out to God for help. And so God decides that the city must be destroyed.\n\nLot and his family are given little time to collect their things and make their way out before God unleashes their destruction, sulfur and fire, which leads to explosions and more. God warns them not to look back or there will be consequences. But Lot’s wife cannot help herself, it seems.\n\nSo this raises a few questions. I’ve been spending some time with Krista Tippett and her philosophy of asking good questions. And so we begin with what other reason could there be that she would look back knowing that it would be her end. It is natural for us to look back as we leave. We remember in those moments what was, has been, the promises we once felt held by. We think about the community that we had or dreamed of having, our roots, the places we loved, and for Lot’s wife, that perhaps her children also loved.\n\nIt is deeply human to recognize that places become homes, that our relationships with places and people are what shape and make our lives. Maybe she was looking back to see if her daughters who had chosen to stay with their husbands had changed their minds. How do you not look back and remember your hopes, the people who loved you into yourself, the memory of firsts and lasts and everything in between?\n\nAs I left Pennsylvania to take my position in Tarpon Springs, I looked back as we drove across the Susquehanna River for the last time, wanting to have my last memory of the place not to be one of pain, but of beauty.\n\nPerhaps Lot’s wife was looking back to help her accept that this city was worthy of such destruction. Given how natural of an instinct turning back would be, It seems cruel to believe that God would want to punish anyone already facing such a terrible situation.\n\nSo this is the second question. Why would God make such an instruction? In general, the God of the Hebrew Bible isn’t the warmer and fuzzier God we get to know once Jesus enters the picture. But God is also not unreasonable or punishing for the sake of being punishing. So what would inspire them to make this instruction?\n\nGiven the context of the rest of the scriptures, my interpretation is because sometimes we humans have a tendency to hold on too tightly to the past, even at the expense of our present and future. We continue to act in the ways we have acted, even when doing so keeps us locked in cycles of creating harm to ourselves. God’s attempt at going scorched earth in these cities of licentiousness is to try to create a blank slate to give the people a chance to begin again, to build something new and one would expect or at least hope better.\n\nIn order to do that, not only does Lot’s family, the ones who are to survive, that they need to be far away, they need to be moving in the direction of forward with their hearts and minds as well as with their bodies. Turning back slows us down and risks us getting stuck, whether physically or emotionally. As if looking back might cause us to freeze. As if turning Lot’s wife into a pillar of salt was just an affirmation of her own unwillingness or unpreparedness to make space for the future or even the present.\n\nThe third question is why salt? Why does she turn into a pillar of salt? The Midrash says that Lot’s wife went to other homes in Sodom asking for salt so that she could share that she had guests for the evening. This is not part of the scriptures though, and the text itself does not offer any insight into the question. What we do know is that salt is a component of tears. Being turned into a pillar of salt may be a way to convey tears of loss. Salt is also highly soluble in water that is when wet salt will melt away. And land that is saturated with salt cannot grow anything. Salt is a cleanser, a purifying agent, a sanctifier.\n\nPerhaps being made a pillar of salt which will not last as a monument to the past for long and will become a stain upon the earth as a patch where nothing will grow is what God is trying to warn against, that if there can be no good or healthy growth, there will be no growth at all. Without a future, the past will also be lost because there is no one left to carry it.\n\nOr to quote from Paul Razor in a 2010 UU World article, “Nearly a Century ago, the Reverend Louis B. Fisher, the Dean of the Universalist Seminary at St. Lawrence University, described Universalists are often asked to tell where they stand. The only true answer is that we do not stand at all. We move.” Razor continues, “Yet there are times when the opposite is true. When the realities are so daunting that we freeze up playing out Dean Fisher’s aphorism in reverse, we do not move, we stand. And more, when we decide to go it alone, to look backward more than we are willing to move forward, we lose ourselves. We wander into a wilderness of our own making and without companions, surrounded by what seeks to separate us from one another.\n\nLot’s wife is a warning to us that where we travel, we must go together if we are to have any hope. To reference another scriptural story, the one about Moses leading the people from Egypt. Too often we focus on the 40 years wandering the desert. And with good reason, we understand that hardship. But in doing so, we overlook the effort that it takes to leave Egypt at all. Some people protest. The journey will be hard. And is being a slave really so bad when you know how the system works?\n\nThey clung to their horrendous conditions because they were familiar. The past can feel like a warm comforter on a cold day. Cause sometimes we humans have a tendency to hold on too tightly to the past, even at the expense of our present and future. We continue to act in ways that we have acted, even when doing so keeps us locked in cycles of creating harm to ourselves.\n\nCommunities, including congregations that are not moving or resting actively are dying, resting from the lens of doing appropriate care, of catching our breath, of meditating to bring us calm or to help us dream. Of taking the time to ask the hard questions, these are all active resting. Refusing to engage in these practices like refusing to do the work to move forward is an indication of unease of this, we become like Lot’s wife, frozen in time.\n\nThe thing is that generosity is not just about money, or your time, talent, and treasures we so often say. It’s about all of that and more, about the ways that we are open to curiosity, hospitality, care. The ways we think about not just this moment, but about this moment in the context of what has been and what will yet be, yet to be possible based on what we do today.\n\nGenerosity is temporal this way, it extends from before all the way to beyond. It’s also a conversation that we have, both with the past and the future to give direction to the present. It’s a conversation we have with all that is possible now. Perhaps we are like children who created Roxaboxen, whose imaginations inspire them to create homes and neighborhoods out of boxes, stones, glass, cactus, and other odds and ends. The present offers different possibilities to us just as the future does if we let it.\n\nGenerosity is about reaching beyond ourselves into the future, doing just a little bit more than is necessary to make other things possible. We need to be generous in holding space for dreaming, for others dreams that we alone cannot imagine, but that will save us nonetheless. We need to look forward at least as much as we are looking back. Are we reaching forward for the generosity the future is trying to extend to us?\n\nHow do we hold space in this moment to honor the past, to name what it has given us, and to allow the future to also be possible? A healthy past wants us to let go and grow forward. When Lot’s wife looked back, she was holding herself back from being able to hold space for other possibilities in that moment.\n\nWhen I left Pennsylvania, I was already making space in my heart and mind for Florida for a couple of months. My looking back was a last goodbye, an act of closure. Our minds sometimes imagine us living in the future or our hearts and minds may try to convince us that we live in the past. We know how that turned out though.We can only ever live in this moment in the present.\n\nOur own imaginations as we age may become less inspired, less curious, less interesting. Imagination is something that we have to practice. And congregations have to practice this together. And every time someone comes or goes, we have to rework the possibilities we have been imagining to make space for everyone, to practice a generosity of spirit.\n\nAnd we can if we choose to do so. Choose to make a little more space. Choose to be a little bit more flexible. Choose to dream a little bigger. Choose to lean in a little more. May we choose to do the next right thing, the next caring thing, the next thing worth doing for the tomorrow we hope to build.\n\nExtinguishing the Chalice\n\nWe extinguish this flame, but not the light of truth, the warmth of community, or the fire of commitment. These we hold in our hearts until we are together again.\n\nBenediction\n\nFrom THE GIFT OF FAITH\n\nJeanne Harrison Nieuwejaar\n\nIn the lore of ancient China, there is a story of a philosopher who was asked, “Where is the road called Hope?”\n\nHe replied, “It does not exist, but as people move upon it, it comes into being.”\n\nI invite you to continue moving forward on this path, this journey called hope, together in Unitarian Universalism with me.\n\nSERMON INDEX\n\nMost sermons during the past 24 years are available online through this website.

Chris Jimmerson and AJ Juraska\n\nJune 30, 2024\n\nFirst UU Church of Austin\n\n4700 Grover Ave., Austin, TX 78756\n\nwww.austinuu.org\n\nSo often, we recoil against overly literal interpretations of the bible that at best seem irrational and at worst harmful. What if rather than a “literal- factual” understanding of biblical scripture, we embraced scholar and theologian Marcus Borg’s “historical-metaphorical” approach instead? Might then the bible become poetry of love and justice?\n\nChalice Lighting\n\nThis is the flame we hold in our hearts as we strive for justice for everyone. This is the light we shine upon systems of oppression until they are no more. This is the warmth that we share with one another as our struggle becomes our salvation.\n\nCall to Worship\n\nREADING THE BIBLE AGAIN FOR THE FIRST TIME;\n\nTAKING THE BIBLE SERIOUSLY BUT NOT LITERALLY\n\nby Marcus J Borg\n\n“… stories can be true without being literally and factually true … A metaphorical approach to the bible thus emphasizes metaphors and their associations … metaphors can be profoundly true, even though they are not literally true. Metaphor is poetry plus, not factuality minus.”\n\nAffirming Our Mission\n\nTogether we nourish souls, transform lives, and do justice to build the Beloved Community.\n\nReading\n\n“The Bible is like Santa Claus and sex. Children hear about it on the playground or on the street, whether or not their parents discuss it with them. And as an adult, if you don’t enjoy it and wish to abstain, you can successfully avoid it only by taking extreme measures such as total social deprivation or profound isolation.\n\nThe Bible is holy scripture because it is the living document and foundation of many important faiths, including Unitarian Universalist. To abandon the Bible would mean alienation from one of the world’s most important influences on religious thought-liberal and otherwise …. Our concept of respect for the web of existence, for instance, emanates from a stream of thought that flows through the Psalms and the Prophets from that same God of Genesis who declared the goodness of creation.”\n\n– Rev. David McFarland\n\nSermon\n\nAJ Juraska’s Homily\n\nI just finished my first year of seminary. If you had told me five years ago I would be in seminary, I would have been shocked. Even more so by the fact that I am attending a Christian seminary.\n\nI wanted to attend a Christian seminary in part because I knew that whether I end up being a chaplain, a parish minister, or working on social justice issues, living in Texas means that I will be exposed to Christian viewpoints and references to the Bible. The more I learn about the Bible, the more I realize that the Bible is hidden in plain sight all around us – in song lyrics, art, writing, common sayings, and so much more. The song we heard earlier, Turn Turn Turn by Pete Seager, is from Ecclesiastes Chapter 3. While working on this homily, I learned that Emily Dickenson’s works reference the Bible.\n\nA part of me also hoped that, by going to a Christian seminary maybe I would find myself identifying as a Christian again. I grew up in a Christian church and I miss some of the magic I found there, and the belonging in having a shared text. Being a UU can be hard in that way. When I used to play roller derby I would often get asked “but where is the ball.” I think the equivalent in UUism is “where is the central text that you all read and agree on.”\n\nAs it turns out, though, even the Christians don’t agree on a central text. Catholics include different books of the bible than Protestants. So we’re not even all reading the same Bible. It took hundreds of years after Jesus’ death before there was even a semblance of agreement on what books to include, and the order to read them in.\n\nThe books of the Bible were written in a time and a place. As my New Testament professor says, some of what we are reading is essentially someone else’s mail. Paul is writing to early Christian churches to try to guide them in how to be successful in this new endeavor, especially at a time when Christians were persecuted and there was debate over who could be included in this new church.\n\nSo why should we read something written nearly two thousand years ago that has context and meaning for a time so long in the past? Unitarian Universalist Minister John A Buehrens answers us in his book Understanding the Bible: An Introduction for Skeptics, Seekers, and Religious Liberals. He says, “Progressive people simply cede their power to opponents when they leave interpretation of our religious heritage, or the meaning of our nation, or authentic ‘family values,’ to the reactionaries, the chauvinists, and the bigots.” He goes on to say that if we reject the Bible, it, quote “doesn’t mean that it ever goes away. Rather it simply means that it ends up only in the hands and on the lips of others – often reactionary others-where it can and will be used against you.”\n\nBuehrens is right. Louisiana just passed a law requiring public school classrooms to display the ten commandments. Texas tried to pass a similar bill last session, and we can bet it will be on the docket again come next year’s session. We can shout about separation of church and state all we want, but the Bible isn’t going to leave our political dialogue any time soon.\n\nWhile the ten commandments are a part of the bible, they are cherry-picked, in that, according to Jewish tradition, there are actually 613 commandments or mitsvot in the Bible. Most of these mitsvot cannot be followed for a variety of reasons, including that they require being in the temple which was destroyed.\n\nOne of the big questions in the early Christian church was whether the early Christians needed to follow the law, in other words the commandments. The New Testament in part is grappling with this question, and there are different interpretations of whether the Jews and the Gentiles, the Christians who do not have Jewish heritage, need to follow the law.\n\nLaws to post the ten commandments might still get passed, but imagine if more teachers knew this context, and could explain that the ten commandments are just a selection of the 613 laws that one ancient group thought were appropriate for governing themselves.\n\nFor all my humanist friends in the audience, I promise we haven’t forgotten about you. In fact, Buehrens calls himself a Biblical humanist. He points out that one can have a foundation in the Bible without believing it reveals something about the supernatural.\n\nThe Bible has a lot for us to learn. I took a class on the book of Judges last semester, and I’m taking a class on Revelation in the fall (fun fact, it’s Revelation without an S at the end, not Revelations as I know I had said my whole life). Judges is one of the harsher books in the Bible, with lots of violence including some of the most horrific violence against women in the text. Through analyzing the book, I came to learn all the ways it can be read, including as a feminist piece, one that in talking about violence against women is in fact speaking out against it. It can also be read as a tract against kingship, and many parts of the Bible are speaking out against empire.\n\nLike much of the Bible, Revelation chapter 13 was written in a way that people of that time and place would have understood, but we do not if we try to read it literally. It talks about beasts but is in fact coded writing against the Roman empire. This is the chapter that includes a reference to 666, or 616 in some of the manuscripts. 666 and 616 are actually codes for Emperor Nero, not a literal devil.\n\nSo where do we go from here? I don’t have all the answers, and I know Rev. Chris has some more to share with us as well. I don’t necessarily recommend trying to sit down and read the whole Bible. I do recommend looking at a study bible and learning how to use the footnotes and references. If you’d like to learn more about how to do that, I’ll be teaching a workshop called Reclaiming the Bible on July 14th from 1-3pm here in the church. We’ll go over how to look up passages and the meanings behind them using study bibles and other reference tools. An announcement will be going out soon about that workshop if you are interested.\n\nThere are also great books like John A Buehrens’s book, which I have here if you’re here in person and would like to look at it. I also have a few other books up here that you’re welcome to look through after the service. If you want to take a deeper dive, you can audit a class at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary or another seminary. There will be a class in the fall on the Hebrew Bible taught by one of my favorite professors that is mostly asynchronous, for example.\n\nThe Bible that I have discovered in seminary is not the one that I was taught as a child growing up in a Christian church. It is both more violent and more beautiful and poetic than the stories of Adam and Eve, Noah, and Jesus from my childhood had led me to believe. If you find yourself afraid of or unsure about the Christian Bible, know that you are not alone. There are many of us who share those concerns.\n\nI know that many come here with religious trauma from Christianity and the Bible. If engaging with the Bible is painful for you, honor that. No one should have to engage with religious or spiritual practices that cause harm. I am still on my own journey when it comes to the Bible. I have discovered some verses that I really like, such as James chapter 2 which talks about how faith without works is dead, or James chapter 5 which warns rich oppressors that God sees the harm they have caused. I have yet to draw the spiritual comfort from the Bible that I see so many others have-something a part of me wishes I had too.\n\nI’m grateful for the UU value of pluralism, which celebrates diverse theology and honors that we can draw from more than one source of spiritual wisdom. The Christian Bible is one source of spiritual wisdom, but it is not the only source, and I appreciate the opportunity to explore all these wisdom traditions in this religious community. Thank you.\n\nRev. Chris Jimmerson’s Homily\n\n“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”\n\nThat’s the Gospel of John chapter 3, verse 16 of the New testament.\n\nKing James Version. Don’t you just love the King James language? “Believeth.” “Begotten.”\n\nSome of you have heard me talk before about how I was raised as a Southern Baptist and said I wanted to be a minister when I was a very young child, even preached sermons into the cassette tape recorder my parents had given me.\n\nOne such “baby” sermon was based upon that bible verse.\n\nIt is amazing to me that all of these years later and having rejected the fundamentalist religion of my childhood, I can still remember John 3: 16 word for word. King James version, no less.\n\nHere’s why I think that matters.\n\nRegardless of our religious upbringing, despite a culture that has gown more and more secular over time, the words and images and metaphors of our largely bible-based religious history have become embedded within our our cultural symbols, mythologies, values, rituals, traditions – indeed the very language with which we think and communicate, and therefore imbedded within our individual subconsciouses as well.\n\nSo, as our reading earlier describes, the bible is still pervasive in our society, and is a large a part of our Unitarian Universalist liberal religious heritage.\n\nSo to though, are more fundamentalist interpretations of the bible, like that of my Southern Baptist childhood, also imbedded within our cultural landscape.\n\nAnd so part of my spiritual journey through adulthood has been to reclaim the biblical narratives that got so implanted into my formational inner psyche in ways that parallel my evolving values and understandings of life.\n\nI have learned to reinterpret and re-embrace the sacred texts of my younger self – like that one from John 3:16.\n\nMore on that shortly!\n\nMarcus J. Borg, author of our Call to Worship earlier, urges us to read the bible as poetry plus rather than factuality minus.\n\nInstead of interpreting the bible as literally and factually true, we may find greater wisdom if we mine it for historical and metaphorical truths.\n\nSo, if for example we take the well known story of Noah and the flood, and has so often been done, try to accept it as literally true, we are forced to either reject it entirely as defying rational belief or to read it as a fantastical tale of an angry and vengeful God extinguishing almost all life on earth, as retribution for the wickedness of humankind.\n\nBut, if we understand that historically, civilizations that predated the origins of the Noah story had similar mythology about floods – floods that were both terribly destructive but also in some way washed cleaned the world and created circumstances through which new life might arise, then, then, we might come to understand the Noah story in a quite different way, metaphorically.\n\nBrothers were killing brothers. Injustice prevailed. Violence had grown rampant.\n\nHumans were engaging in physical relations with the angels.\n\nWe were filled with hubris and disregard for our fellow humans. We had moved away from love and justice.\n\nAnd so, symbolically, the story may be seen as humankind cleansing itself of these violations of our deepest, most life-giving and fulfilling values and rebirthing a rootedness in love and justice.\n\nGod, then, becomes a profound inner calling toward our deepest values that move us toward thriving and fulfillment.\n\nAnd over and over again throughout the bible, a literal-factual approach, too often leads to using the bible to inflict a vengeful God upon other people we don’t like or want to dominate.\n\nBut if we move instead toward this historical-metaphorical approach, then over and over again, we find story after story in the bible that becomes a poetry of love and justice – over and over again, a calling to cleanse ourselves of greed, violence, and injustice – over and over again a fervent cry for living lives of love and justice.\n\nAnd I think developing our ability to return the bible to its poetic grounding in love and justice is vital for at least two reasons:\n\nThe first is that, as already mentioned, the bible is a fundamental part of Unitarian Universalist heritage. If we throw it out, we lose a rich metaphorical inspiration for many of our most cherished concepts and values.\n\nThe second though, it that we are seeing in this country an eruption of mostly white, Christian Nationalism that would brandish literalistic interpretations of this scared text to banish love and justice for all but themselves and turn our government into a white, Christofacist patriarchy.\n\nAnd lest we think that is hyperbole, just consider that Louisiana has made in mandatory to post the ten commandments in every school classroom, and Oklahoma has just required that the bible be taught in every classroom.\n\nI can only cringe at what literalistic, fundamentalist take on the bible will get taught.\n\nI want to ask them just how they plan to teach commandments such as “Thou shall not commit adultery” or “Thous shalt not covet thy neighbors wife … nor his manservant.”\n\nI know I’m always telling my neighbors, “don’t you go coveting my manservant.”\n\nOnce again, gotta love the King James.\n\nThe editor and chief of Christianity Today recently told of several pastors relating to him how after preaching about the sermon on the mount, several of their church goers complained that it was too “woke”.\n\nAnd that returns me to the Christ story encapsulated by John 3:16 with which we began.\n\nYou see my beloveds, we have to be able to counter these selectively factual, fundamentalist readings of the bible with our own metaphorical perspective, proclaiming love and justice.\n\nWe have to proclaim and reclaim Jesus as the preacher of that sermon on the mount where he declared:\n\nBlessed are the poor in spirit, the meek, those who mourn, those who hunger, the merciful, the pure in heart, the peace makers, those who are persecuted for righteousness.\n\nJesus was no blond haired, blue eyed, white, Christian nationalist warrior. He was a dark skinned, ultra woke, anti-empire, champion for love and justice, who over-turned the tables of the money changers in the temple, expressed a preference for the poor, and disenfranchised and hung out with prostitutes, tax collectors and the chronically unemployed, also know as his disciples.\n\nFor me, John 3:16 is a poem about a love so powerful, so selfless and boundless that we’re willing to give all of ourselves all we have begotten to create love and justice for all in our world so that humankind may flourish and thrive.\n\nAnd that, is our life everlasting. Amen.\n\nExtinguishing the Chalice\n\nWe extinguish this flame, but not the light of truth, the warmth of community, or the fire of commitment. These we hold in our hearts until we are together again.\n\nBenediction\n\nAnd now, as we go out into our world today, may we see the poetry in our lives.\n\nMay we find the holy metaphors in all of the sacred texts of our tradition.\n\nMay we encounter the sacred in all that surrounds us.\n\nMay center ourselves in love and justice.\n\nMay the congregation say, “Amen” and “blessed be”.\n\nGo in peace.\n\nSERMON INDEX\n\nMost sermons during the past 24 years are available online through this website.
