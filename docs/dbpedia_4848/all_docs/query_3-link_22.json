        "text": "I never intended to be a yoga teacher. I decided to enter teacher training because I love yoga & wanted to get a deeper understanding of it & was struggling to do so in a regular class. It wasn’t until l was pretty far into the training that my goal shifted a bit. Looking back I’m not even 100% sure why. I think I feel strongly about the benefits yoga can have for every person. Whether it’s physical benefits from a fitness perspective, flexibility to improve day to day movement to help relieve anxiety. Whatever someone’s goal or current struggle with their mind or body, I believe with my whole heart yoga will help.\n\nI have two…\n\n1. Leave your ego behind. Pay attention each day to what feels ok for your body. One day the right choice is to keep finding your edge & challenge yourself, but the next class it’s to back off & show your body grace. It’s your practice, no one else’s. No one is watching what you can do or judging how well you are doing it. Just focus on yourself each time you are on you mat & what the right choices are for your body in that moment.\n\n2. Try an inversion. It’s empowering!\n\nJoin us in wishing a VERY Happy Birthday to Instructor Matt Dressler!! We hope you get to enjoy this beautiful day celebrating with those you love! Thank you for always being ready to lend a helping hand around the studio, we appreciate all that you've done and continue to do for us.
