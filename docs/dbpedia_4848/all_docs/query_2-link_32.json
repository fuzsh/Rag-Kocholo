        "text": "Artist Adam Hudson, also known as The Knotty Guy, is a Tsimshian Native Alaskan. He was born and raised in Metlakatla and now lives in Ketchikan. Adam’s passion for the ancient maritime art of marlinspike seamanship – the art of seamanship that includes the tying of knots, splicing, working with cable or rope, as well as making decorative items from rope – keeps him busy when he’s not at sea.\n\nAdam started working with rope in 2014 when his daughter asked him to teach her how to make a paracord bracelet. He learned how to make a bracelet so he could show her and continued to be fascinated with creating useful items with rope and knots. His creations are both aesthetic and functional."
