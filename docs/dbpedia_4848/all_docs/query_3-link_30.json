In addition to touring internationally as a stand-up comedian, Becky was named a JFL Montreal New Face of Comedy where her standout multi-character performance landed her a sketch show development deal and a number of voiceover jobs with DreamWorks, Nickelodeon, and Netflix.\n\nCurrently, Becky voices “Parker J. Cloud,” an exuberant former raincloud on a mission to brighten up everyone’s day, in Nickelodeon’s animated series Middlemost Post. She was also a season regular on MTV’s Wild ’N Out with Nick Cannon where she also put out a Wild ’N Out Stand Up Special. Other appearances include Netflix’s The G Word with Adam Conover. Hulu’s Coming to the Stage, MTV’s Acting Out, ABC’s The Bachelor, and Kevin Hart’s sketch series Writer’s Room.\n\nAs a writer, Becky has written for Comedy Central’s Not Safe, Snoop Dogg’s Joker’s Wild, and FunnyOrDie.\n\nFor more information on Becky’s tour and projects go-to: www.beckyrobinsonthegreat.com.\n\nKNOW BEFORE YOU GO!
