        "text": "Fandom: The Sorcerer's Apprentice / Supernatural\n\nAuthor: Night's Fang (Inked Insanity)\n\nDisclaimer: I do not own Supernatural. Or The Sorcerer's Apprentice\n\nA/N: Written for technicallysane's various prompts, on the Alphabet Fic Meme\n\nPrompt: Soulmates\n\nCharacters/Pairings: Dave/Becky/Adam. Balthazar Blake, Castiel, Balthazar (SPN).\n\nRating: PG\n\nWarnings: AU-ish.\n\n“So let me get this straight, we're destined to be together?” Dave asks staring anyway that's away from Adam, who looks rather uncomfortable from where he's been bound to the couch so that he won't attempt violence, and Becky who seems to be trying to untie him. Which basically means he's left staring from the weird guy in the tan trench coat to Balthazar, to the other guy with the glass of whiskey in his hand, who is snickering away to glory about the whole turn of events.\n\nAt least Balthazar has the grace to look equally flabbergasted as Dave feels, and sympathetic to his plight for once. Not that Adam isn't a nice guy, or anything like that. Adam is perfectly nice and cool to hang out with for a supposed dangerous demon that Horvath summoned to get revenge on Dave. (Or rather as exact wording went, from the most dangerous place, which of course meant the Cage, which is exactly how Adam got out, and not an actual crazy evil demon. It would also explain why Dave was alive. Adam had a small list of people and angels he wanted to kill. The rest of the world got to see his snarky hippie love side.) But the thing is Adam is a guy, and while Dave has nothing against guys who go for other guys, he isn't one of them. Also, he has a girlfriend. A pretty girlfriend. One he's been crazy about since he was a kid. He's perfectly happy with his love life the way it is, without a cupid driven arranged marriage ruining it, because God – who's AWOL apparently – didn't want there to be more descendants of Merlin, or a bastard Winchester lineage.\n\nSpeaking about Becky... “I have a girlfriend!”\n\n“Yes, it seems that destiny has been altered to include her as your soulmate too.”\n\nWhat.\n\nWhat?\n\nSo wait, he's destined to share his incredibly hot girlfriend with the guy who was supposed to kill him? What is his life.\n\nWhy do these kinds of things happen to him, Dave wonders burying his face into his hands.\n\nOf course none of the wise adults stay to actually answer that question, because when Dave looks up again, the only people left in the room, are Adam, Becky and him. The two angels probably high tailed it before Adam could actually get loose and attempt to kill them. Balthazar, hopefully has gone after them.\n\nAdam who has finally managed to get free, and seems a little calmer – though that might be thanks to Becky – speaks up from the couch after a moment, “So how much booze should I order, for us to get over this? And I don't do exotic honeymoons. Or tuxedos.”\n\nDave can't help crack a smile, and Becky is all out laughing, as she hands Adam the phone. At least, Dave thinks, watching Adam order them take out and alcohol while Becky throws in suggestions, that he lucked out in terms of soulmates. After all, it could've been much worse.\n\nPrompt: Aftermath\n\nCharacters/Pairings: Michael!Dave/Demon!Adam. Dave/Adam. Hints of Michael/Adam.\n\nRating: NC-17\n\nWarnings: AU. Mentions of gore, and sex.\n\nIt amuses Michael, how easily the boy gave him consent. All he had to do was promise him Adam back, and David Stutler was begging Michael to use him as a vessel. It's the easiest deal Michael has ever made. Merlinian magic swirls through his body mixing with his grace adding to his power, and Michael smiles as he settles himself into this new vessel. It's not as perfect a fit as Dean would have been, or as good a fit as Adam was, but the added magical ability this boy possesses more than makes up for it.\n\nMore than that, Adam is so receptive to him in this vessel. He keens and moans under Michael's touches, white eyes looking heady with lust. He whispers threats, screams curses, and gnashes his teeth when Michael brings him down to his knees and pulls his hair. He smiles like a knife as he cuts through the various legions of angels who come after them, when Michael cleanses Heaven. And he\n\nkisses with a reverence that Michael knows is meant for the soul inside this body, not him, but he's still the one who enjoys it.\n\nBecoming a demon after being pulled into Hell for a second time has only added to the beauty of Adam's soul. The taint has made Adam more endearing, lovely with his jagged edges, and twisted morals, and eroded humanity. He has no qualms, no inhibitions any more. The boy is willing to go to any lengths to protect Dave, and hence, protect Michael.\n\nInside him, Dave screams, and curses when Michael kisses the taste or sulphur and blood off Adam's smile, for a job well done as they stand amidst the bodies of more errant disobedient angels. Michael will fuck him here later, hard and rough, in the blood on the ground. He'll leave bruises, and he knows Adam will love it because the demon he's become mixes pain with pleasure, and the humanity left in Adam will pretend it's Dave and give in.\n\nYou wanted him back boy. He's back and he's ours. You just never said you wanted him back human.\n\nPrompt: Vegas\n\nCharacters/Pairings: Dave/Adam.\n\nRating: NC-17\n\nWarnings: AU. Smut-ish.\n\nThe thing is Adam wasn't really drunk. He'd decided when they went to the bar that the fun of being drunk wasn't worth the hangover. Or worth forgetting the possible blackmail material he could gather on a drunk Dave. (They were in Vegas after all. Dave had to get drunk on pure principle. Adam was going to make sure of it.) He'd taken his drinks slow all evening. So tipsy maybe. Or rather enough alcohol in his system to make his a little more loose-limbed, relaxed, and uninhibited; but not drunk. Dave of course hadn't known and Adam wasn't not too keen on telling him.\n\nIt's not that he wanted to lie to Dave; playing drunk was just fun, since it got Dave flustered, and it also got Dave to fuss over Adam. And he got to invade Dave's personal space, with the sureity that they'd laugh it off in the morning and no feelings would be hurt. (Other than Dave's patented pouts, but those were cute so they didn't count. Yes, Adam was whipped. He knew. Shut up.) It's something he'd never have done stone cold sober, because it's too fucking awkward. Especially when they were both pretending that there's no elephant taking up the space of the whole room with 'Unresolved sexual tension' written in red all over it. Yeah they're that bad. When Adam wasn't busy being in awkward land, he was shaking his head and pitying himself.\n\n(Dave is hot. Of course he wants to tap that.)\n\nBut then somewhere between proving to Dave that yes, he could take off his own shirt, and laughing as they nearly tripped on the way to the bed, Dave had kissed him. Adam had wasted no time in kissing back. Or deepening it. Or pushing Dave onto his bed and divesting the\n\nMerlianian's shirt. Even though there was a good chance the initial kiss had been innocent.\n\nAnd maybe, Adam realised, he was probably a little past tipsy or drunk after all, since normally he'd stop right there. And probably Dave was drunk too, because he hadn't stopped Adam. He'd actually let Adam kiss down his neck over his chest, and he'd moaned arching into Adam grinding their hips together. And fuck if that wasn't the hottest thing ever, seeing Dave that way. A dirty fantasy Adam didn't even know he had. That was also what most likely made Adam stop bothering about using his brain.\n\nWhich in hindsight sucked when you remembered it the morning after. As awesome it was – and it was awesome, Adam's probably going to be jacking off for the next few months pretending it's Dave's hands on him; and as much as he likes the feel of Dave against him, he's worried about the inevitable freak out that's definitely coming once Dave wakes up. Judging by the shifting and stirring, and mumbling that's in twelve seconds.\n\n“Morning,” Dave mumbles, once he finally gets his bearings, turning on his back, smiling unsurely. Adam mentally has to smack himself for finding it cute when he should be worrying about other things.\n\n“Morning, “ Adam mumbles back, waiting for the other shoe to drop, before deciding he might as well do it himself. There' no ignoring how they're both naked and how the room smells of sex. And waiting for Dave to mention it is just being mean to the poor guy. “So, um, last night.”\n\n“Yeah about that,” Dave laughs nervously, glancing down at their bodies. Adam wishes they were covered to ease the blow, but one of them seemed to have kicked off the sheets in the night. Adam's betting it's him. He can't stand heat. “Um...”\n\n“Yeah, we did,” because one of them has to be blunt about it. And it seems that Adam has to be the one who does that. Joy.\n\n“We should probably start investing in condoms, then.” Dave's smile turns crooked. Adam has to just simply stare dumbly.\n\n“...”\n\n“Right?”\n\n“...”\n\n“Adam?”\n\nAdam shakes his head as what Dave said finally gets digested. Then grinning, because if that means what it thinks he means.... Well Adam is one very, very happy camper. “That's kind of obvious, Harry Potter.”\n\nDave rolls his eyes as he gets out of bed, and unintentionally giving Adam a very spectacular view in the morning light.\n\nAdam might just love Vegas.\n\nPrompt: Eclipse\n\nCharacters/Pairings: Dave/Adam.\n\nRating: PG\n\nWarnings: AU.\n\nThey don't count their anniversaries in years, but full Lunar Eclipses. It's a stupidly silly nerdy thing that they do, because as Adam likes to put it, they are super special unique good looking snowflakes, and they can. Dave of course translates it for the normal people as: “We met in a weird way on a full lunar eclipse, and are sentimental.” Adam likes his reason better. Plus it's more fun to keep track of milestones that way.\n\n(Okay maybe they do count in years too, but that's for the plebians out there.)\n\nThe main thing is they met during an eclipse, and this is how it goes.\n\nIt's supposed to be a full moon, but the sky is dark and empty save for a few stars when Adam first stumbles into Dave. Literally stumbles. One moment he remembers being in the Cage, Michael's and Lucifer's grace burning him inside out, with only their sub and super sonic voices and Sam's screams to keep him company. The next he was in a clearing trapped in a circle of fire being given instructions from a bald scary looking man – Adam couldn't really make out what they were, his ears were still ringing from the sound. The next he's falling onto a lanky guy in some huge ass basement. He'd have actually fallen onto the floor, but thankfully Lanky Guy [“Lanky Guy? You suck. Why do you always have to tell the story anyway?” “Oh stop being such a drama queen about it.”] breaks his fall. Then proceeds to flip his shit in a way that's so cartoonishly comical, Adam cannot stop laughing. [“I did not look like a cartoon!” “You did, dude. And like you pouting\n\nactually works, and will make me retract that statement Dave.” “I hate you.” “I love you too.” “Children!” “Sorry Becky.”] Even if it means bad things for his poor stomach, and he's puking out bile onto the floor five minutes later.\n\nLater he finds out that Lanky Guy is actually called Dave. And he is a sorcerer. (No seriously, a sorcerer. It's something tamer compared to ghouls, and monsters, and demons, and angels, but Adam can't help but laugh, because when he thinks or sorcerers he thinks “Harry Potter”. Dave of course pouts at that – still does whenever Adam narrates the story and mentions this – but that just makes it funnier.) And apparently Adam, who is supposed to be a demon now [“Seriously what bullshit is that?” “Adam, behave.”] – get this - was summoned from Hell by Dave's Teacher's Arch-Rival to kill Dave. No seriously, this is actually the whole story. And Adam is laughing too hard,\n\nbecause seriously, after everything he's gone through, it is the funniest shit he's ever heard.\n\n(Safe to say he doesn't kill Dave. That's just stupid. Though, he does insist on finding the guy who got him out of hell to thank him for that. Adam might not be a murderer or a demon but at least he has enough manners to say a thank you. [“No Adam, you're just crazy.” “Am Not.”])\n\nAs far as first impressions and meetings go, it's definitely something to remember.\n\nSafe to say, Adam ends up staying, and the rest is history."
