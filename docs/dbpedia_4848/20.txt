Toronto based photographer Derek Hui captured the raw and natural beauty of Beki Adams at Wilhelmina London shot at Barbican Centre, London, UK. Make-Up done by Rajan Wadhera.

“This was my first time ever in London, and oh man did I fall in love with it. I was in town for Wireless Festival to take some photos and to support a friend of mine who was performing at the festival but I knew before my week long trip ended I wanted to let the city influence me to capture something different than my usual work. I was looking through instagram to see which model I could connect with and as soon as I discovered Beki’s page I knew I had to reach out and photograph her. In terms of photography and art, she definitely has a very editorial look to her face and features, however if we’re talking on a “what home feels like”-vibe there was something very Toronto about her. I felt as if she could be another beautiful girl in the Queen West district of Toronto, one you would find at an underground event partying away a Thursday night. We decided to shoot at the Barbican Centre, a building in London that the city has a very love/hate relationship with in terms of it’s architecture – however it was really different than what I would find at home. We ran around searching for good light, some privacy, and had a blast. There’s a bunch of 35mm disposable camera film I need to develop, but in terms of digital, I think I was able to capture a bit of London mixed with some Toronto vibes.”
