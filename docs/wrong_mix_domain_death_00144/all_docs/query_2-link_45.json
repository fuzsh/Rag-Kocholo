        "text": "Clark Gable - Actor’s Biography\n\nClark Gable (Cadiz, Ohio, USA, February 1, 1901 - Los Angeles, California, USA, November 16, 1960)\n\nClark Gable is probably the most famous film Romeo from the golden age of Hollywood. He will always remain in our memory as Rhett Butler from Gone with the Wind (1939), even though he never cared for that film much himself. He got interested in acting as a young man and tried to act in the theater while earning money at other jobs. In Portland, he joined a theatre group led by Josephine Dillon, who became his mentor and first wife in 1924. Together they went to Hollywood, but after several small roles, Gable was discouraged and decided to try his luck in New York. There he became friends with the actor Lionel Barrymore who encouraged him to act in the theatre. After several successful roles, Gable had still managed to get only very little work due to the recession and moved back to Hollywood with his second wife Ria Langham. Following his role in the theatre play The Last Mile he signed a contract with MGM. After doing several silent films in 1931, he had his first credited role in a sound film The Painted Desert (1931). Then he had a supporting role in A Free Soul (1931), after which he began playing leading roles opposite actresses such as Joan Crawford (Dance, Fools, Dance; Laughing Sinners; Possessed, 1931), Barbara Stanwyck (Night Nurse, 1931), Greta Garbo (Susan Lenox - Her Fall and Rise, 1931), Jean Harlow (Red Dust, 1932, Hold Your Man, 1933), Carole Lombard (No Man of Her Own, 1932). Just before and during the filming of Dancing Lady (1933) he was hospitalized due to severe tooth problems and most of his teeth had to be removed. He had to recover for a long time and the shooting of the film suffered. Therefore, MGM’s boss Louis B. Mayer decided to deny Gable two weeks’ pay and tensions arose on both sides. To teach Gable a lesson, Mayer “loaned” him to the poorer studio Columbia Pictures and Gable made the comedy Dogodilo se jedne noći (It Happened One Night, 1934), directed by Frank Capra, which brought him an Oscar for Best Actor (Claudette Colbert won an Oscar as Best Actress, Capra as Best Director, screenwriter Robert Riskin for Best Adapted Screenplay and the film itself as Best Film). Afterwards, the studio doubled his pay and he starred in many famous films opposite great actresses. One of his most famous films is Mutiny on the Bounty (1935), but four years later, he starred in Gone with the Wind (1939), which brought him global fame. In 1942, he experienced a great personal tragedy when his wife, actress Carole Lombard, died in a plane crash together with her mother. A few months later, a devastated Gable volunteered to join the army where he spent the next two years. After the war, he returned to making films and starred in Victor Fleming’s Adventure (1945). Because he never attained his previous heights of glory and being dissatisfied with the roles the studio gave him, he decided to reject many offers for television. In 1954, he cancelled his contract with MGM and became an independent actor. In that period he starred in Mogambo (1953) by John Ford, Run Silent Run Deep (1958) by Robert Wiese and Misfits (1961) by John Houston, which was his last film and, according to many, his best role ever. He died of a heart attack soon after the film was finished.\n\nFilmography:\n\nThe Misfits (1961)\n\nIt Started in Naples (1960)\n\nBut Not for Me (1959)\n\nTeacher's Pet (1958)\n\nRun Silent Run Deep (1958)\n\nBand of Angels (1957)\n\nThe King and Four Queens (1956)\n\nThe Tall Men (1955)\n\nSoldier of Fortune (1955)\n\nBetrayed (1954)\n\nMogambo (1953)\n\nNever Let Me Go (1953)\n\nLone Star (1952)\n\nAcross the Wide Missouri (1951)\n\nTo Please a Lady (1950)\n\nKey to the City (1950)\n\nAny Number Can Play (1949)\n\nCommand Decision (1948)\n\nHomecoming (1948)\n\nThe Hucksters (1947)\n\nAdventure (1945)\n\nSomewhere I'll Find You (1942)\n\nHonky Tonk (1941)\n\nThey Met in Bombay (1941)\n\nComrade X (1940)\n\nBoom Town (1940)\n\nStrange Cargo (1940)\n\nGone with the Wind (1939)\n\nIdiot's Delight (1939)\n\nToo Hot to Handle (1938)\n\nTest Pilot (1938)\n\nSaratoga (1937)\n\nParnell (1937)\n\nLove on the Run (1936)\n\nCain and Mabel (1936)\n\nSan Francisco (1936)\n\nWife vs. Secretary (1936)\n\nMutiny on the Bounty (1935)\n\nChina Seas (1935)\n\nThe Call of the Wild (1935)\n\nAfter Office Hours (1935)\n\nForsaking All Others (1934)\n\nChained (1934)\n\nManhattan Melodrama (1934)\n\nMen in White (1934)\n\nIt Happened One Night (1934)\n\nDancing Lady (1933)\n\nNight Flight (1933)\n\nHold Your Man (1933)\n\nThe White Sister (1933)\n\nStrange Interlude (1932)\n\nNo Man of Her Own (1932)\n\nRed Dust (1932)\n\nPolly of the Circus (1932)\n\nHell Divers (1931)\n\nPossessed (1931)\n\nSusan Lenox (1931)\n\nSporting Blood (1931)\n\nNight Nurse (1931)\n\nA Free Soul (1931)\n\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\n\nThe Secret Six (1931)\n\nThe Finger Points (1931)\n\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\n\nThe Easiest Way (1931)\n\nThe Painted Desert (1931)\n\nNorth Star (1925)\n\nThe Plastic Age (1925) (unaccredited)\n\nThe Merry Widow (1925) (unaccredited)\n\nWhat Price Gloria?
