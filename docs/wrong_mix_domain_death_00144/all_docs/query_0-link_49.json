        "text": "The Beverly Hills Hotel is arguably one of the most famous hotels in the world. Built in 1912, the Dorchester Collection property has hosted royalty, acted as the backdrop to some infamous Rat-Pack-era parties, served as a hideout for stars like Lauren Bacall and John Lennon, and remains a popular spot for Hollywood’s elite to this day. And one man knows all its secrets.\n\nHaving held the position since 2011, Edward Mady, the Regional Director of West Coast USA and General Manager of the hotel, has not only been privy to wild stories of the past, but also experienced the wacky requests of today’s rich and famous. And now that the landmark inn is undergoing a restoration of its secluded private bungalows, which were first introduced in 1915 and were once the temporary homes of Marilyn Monroe and Howard Hughes, we thought there was no better time to grill Mady on some of the wildest things that have happened at the hotel.\n\nWhen it comes to historic happenings, Mady has heard his fair share of scandalous tidbits. “Famous writer Gore Vidal’s mother had an affair with Clark Gable in Bungalow 1 and Robert Kennedy’s children learned of his assassination in Bungalow 3,” Mady tells Condé Nast Traveler. “And when the reclusive Howard Hughes used to stay at the hotel, he rented several bungalows at a time to best maintain his privacy and requested that roast beef sandwiches be left at night in the fork of a nearby tree.”\n\nAt a property like The Beverly Hills Hotel, Mady says, the unique requests are endless. But what are some of the most memorable highlights from his tenure at the property? “One guest wanted us to create a Broadway-theatre style make-up mirror with those big round bulbs around the perimeter...in the shape of a butterfly and have it installed in her suite,” he says. “Another guest wanted a large disco ball complete with special lighting above the bed in a guest room, so we called in an engineer to make it happen.”\n\nSome requests were a bit tamer, though still as luxurious, like when Mady had to arrange for a jewelry store to bring over a million dollars’ worth of watches to a guest or when he helped plan a several million-dollar wedding in the Crystal Ballroom. “We handle anything from last minute helicopter rides to renting the latest luxury sports car that meets the exact specifications of a guest,” he says. “White Ferrari with a gold steering wheel anyone?”\n\nSome wishes, on the other hand, were a bit odder. “On one occasion, we had to dress an entire guest room floor with white pillowcases and have them laid over every inch of the space,” he said. “And this was after the guests had checked in!”\n\nAt times, Mady admits, the demands can be “difficult,” but he feels lucky to be in his position. And while famous faces may come and go, the over-the-top requests, it seems, show no sign of diminishing. “If it’s legal and ethical, we can pretty much do anything for our guests,” says Mady."
