At the time of his death, he was filming his show “Cheaters” in Dallas.\n\nSources told TMZ that crew members were concerned about his drug use, even bringing it to the show's creator Bobby Goldstein's attention. Goldstein, who never saw him under the influence of drugs, claimed that Gable told him there was nothing to be concerned about.\n\nClark Gable’s Grandson Dead at 30\n\nView Story"
