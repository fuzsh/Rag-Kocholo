        "text": "Actor and television personality Clark Gable III attempted to parlay his famous name into a career in front of the cameras before his untimely death at the age of 30 in 2019. Born Clark James Gable on September 20, 1988 in Malibu, California, he was the grandson of iconic Hollywood star Clark Gable and son of his only male child, John Clark Gable. His parents split two years after Gable was born, and with his sister, fellow aspiring actor Kayley Gable, was raised by their mother, hair stylist Tracy Yarro, who later married Jason Scheff, a former bassist for the veteran rock band Chicago. Gable began his career in front of the cameras as a child model, and after studying acting at the New York Film Academy, dabbled in various industries, including technology and fashion, while attempting to follow in his father and grandfather's footsteps as an actor. His screen debut came in a low-budget thriller, \"Ordinary Madness,\" in 2001, and he made occasional appearances in independent features before earning his most substantial showcase with the syndicated reality series \"Cheaters\" (2000-), which he hosted for three seasons. In 2019, Gable appeared to be in the process of relaunching his acting career with a slew of acting projects, but the burst of momentum was cut short in February of that year when he was found unresponsive in his home in Dallas, Texas. He died at an area hospital on February 22, 2019 of unspecified causes."
