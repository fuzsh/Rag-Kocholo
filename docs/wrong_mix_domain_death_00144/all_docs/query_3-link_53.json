He is remembered as the man who made the pencil mustache de rigueur and crippled the undershirt business when he bared his chest in It Happened One Night. For many, Gable still represents the ultimate in American masculinity—a man's man and a woman's ideal. The consummate product of the studio system, Gable's screen image was created by MGM publicity executive Howard Strickling who capitalized on Gable's natural assets and his actual background as a laborer. He was to become a symbol of the uncommon common man.\n\nGable's impressive size projected an enormous physical strength; he could challenge any man and dominate any woman. The ever present wink in his eye transmitted a roguish charm, a casual self-confidence, and an innate sense of humor. But it was what Joan Crawford described as his \"sheer animal magic,\" his magnetic and overt virility, which separated him from the rest, even offscreen; a recent tell-all by Judy Lewis, the daughter of Loretta Young, revealed the long-kept secret of a Gable/Young love affair that spawned Lewis herself. Gable's only acknowledged child, John Clark Gable, the result of his union with Kay Speckles, was born shortly after Gable died.\n\nHailed as Valentino with a voice, Clark Gable embodied sex appeal. It was his \"you'll take it and like it\" attitude towards Norma Shearer in A Free Soul that catapulted the 30-year-old actor into stardom and kept him among the top ten box-office stars for the next 12 years (1932–43); by 1939 he was earning $5,000 per week.\n\nGable signed the first in a series of long-term contracts with MGM in December 1930 and worked for the studio until he began freelancing in 1954. The vast majority of his Metro assignments were star vehicles (Chained, Saratoga, Test Pilot, and Honky Tonk). These were pictures whose commercial success depended almost entirely on his name and that of the studio's top leading ladies, particularly Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, Myrna Loy, and Lana Turner. In these films, Gable played the same role time and time again—a roué with a heart of gold.\n\nDuring the 1930s his occasional opportunities to do something beyond formula material were more often fortuitous than calculated. His casting in a comedy on \"Poverty Row\" (Columbia's It Happened One Night) was designed as a punishment for uncooperative behavior; Call of the Wild was another loan-out; Mutiny on the Bounty and San Francisco were both films Gable himself resisted doing.\n\nThe undisputed pinnacle of his career was his role as Rhett Butler in Gone with the Wind, another part he initially resisted. Assisted by one of his favorite directors, Victor Fleming, Gable created perhaps the most popular romantic figure of the twentieth century. Offscreen, Gable lived out the myth of the great lover by marrying actress Carole Lombard. Her unexpected death in 1942 drastically changed the actor's attitude towards his life and his work. He turned his back on Hollywood and joined the Army Air Corps. After a two-year absence from the screen, Gable returned with a new seriousness. Personal grief and depression, combined with the onset of middle age, deeply affected his on-screen persona. For many, the motion picture business seemed frivolous after the war; Gable concurred. Even the now-famous slogan for his first postwar film (Adventure), \"Gable's Back and Garson's Got Him!,\" struck the actor as frivolous.\n\nDespite the relative infrequency of his screen appearances, Gable reclaimed his top ten box-office status in 1947, 1948, and 1949. His enormous popularity began to wane only in the last decade of his life, although he continued to remain a star, his name well above the title in such pictures as The Tall Men, Band of Angels, and The King and Four Queens, a title obviously geared towards him.\n\nHis career culminated with an impressive tour-de-force performance as the mustanger Gay Langland in John Huston's The Misfits, which he considered the best of his career, even though he never lived to see the completed film. Three days after the picture wrapped, he died of a heart attack, which, some maintained, was brought on by the strain of doing his own stunt work at Huston's urging during the film's climactic mustang roundup. It was Gable himself who insisted on doing many of his own stunts for the required close-ups. But, contrary to rumor, the real rough-and-tumble action was carried out in long shot by Gable's double, a professional stuntman. This final performance, delivered with remarkable sensitivity and conviction, stands as a tribute, not only to a great star but to the accomplished actor Gable was not always given credit for being.\n\n—Joanne L.
