        "text": "Judy Lewis, 76, of Palm Springs, California died on Friday, November 25, at Waverly Heights, Gladwyne, PA after a courageous battle with cancer. A long-time resident of Los Angeles, she was the loving mother of Maria T. Dagit, mother-in-law to Daniel C. Dagit, Jr. grandmother to Michael and Gregory, devoted sister and dear friend to many. Judy was born on November 6, 1935 in Venice, California, the daughter of actress Loretta Young and Clark Gable who co-starred in “Call of the Wild.” She was raised in Los Angeles by her mother and lived in the Los Angeles area for most of her life. Judy achieved success in two very different career paths in her lifetime. In the theatre and television industries, Judy spent many years both in front of and behind the camera. Her acting credits include: Mary Mary on Broadway, and featured parts on the daytime serials General Hospital, Kitty Foyle, The Brighter Day, and The Doctors. She is best known for her longest running role as Susan Ames Dunbar on The Secret Storm (1964-1971). Judy had guest-starring roles on The Blue Angels, The Outlaws, Airport 1975, The Streets of San Francisco and Police Woman. Behind the camera, she applied her talents, experience and skill when she produced the soap opera, Texas, a spin-off of Another World. Additionally, her script work on Search for Tomorrow was recognized with a Writer’s Guild award. In 1994, Judy wrote the bestselling autobiography, Uncommon Knowledge. During the 1980’s, Judy fulfilled her life-long dream by earning her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Clinical Psychology from Antioch University. Her advocacy for children’s rights culminated in working for California Foster Care and St. Anne’s Hospital, counseling teenagers. In the early 1990’s Judy received her marriage and family/child counseling license (MFCC) and began her career as a practicing psychotherapist in Los Angeles, a vocation she pursued until her recent illness. Above all else, Judy cherished her time spent in the Philadelphia suburbs and the New Jersey Shore with her daughter, Maria Tinney Dagit, Maria’s husband, Dan and her two grandsons, Michael and Gregory. She played an active and vital role in their lives. In addition to her immediate family, Judy is survived by her half-brothers, Christopher and Peter Lewis; her half-brother John Clark Gable; and her partner, Steve Rowland; along with many nieces, nephews and loving cousins. Judy was cherished by countless friends and will be truly missed by all those who knew and loved her. Family and friends are invited to share in a Memorial mass celebrating Judy’s life on Saturday, December 3, 2011 at 11:30 AM at Saint John Vianney Church, Gladwyne, PA. Relatives will be receiving visitors at 11:00AM at the Church. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to: The Waverly Heights Employee Appreciation Fund, c/o Victoria West, 1400 Waverly Road, Gladwyne, PA 19035 or to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, 555 North Lane Suite 5010, Conshohocken, PA 19428.
