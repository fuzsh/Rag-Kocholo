Marilyn & Clark starred together in The Misfits, the last completed film for both of them. As a child Norma Jeane would fantasize that he was her father.\n\nMarilyn spoke about her time working with Gable on the set of The Misfits:\n\n“The place was full of so-called men, but Clark was the only one who brought a chair for me between takes. He never got angry with me once for blowing a line or being late or anything — he was a gentlemen. The best.”"
