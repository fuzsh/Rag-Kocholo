        "text": "Clark Gable was born in a small Ohio mining town and never finished high school. Stage struck as a young man, he did menial jobs while working his way up to movie stardom-his most famous role was in \"Gone with the Wind.\" He married 5 times. During WWII, he enlisted in the Army Air Corps, flew a few combat missions as a gunner and won the Distinguished Service Cross. Personally, he was intermittently obese, a drinker, smoker, hypertensive and predictably in 1960, he suffered an acute myocardial infarction. His clinical course was benign until the 10th hospital day, when he died suddenly. No resuscitation was attempted. At the time of his death, preventive cardiology, mouth-to-mouth ventilation, closed chest cardiac massage, defibrillation and coronary care units were in their infancy. The history of these and subsequent therapeutic practices are reviewed, but Gable died a bit too early for their application."
