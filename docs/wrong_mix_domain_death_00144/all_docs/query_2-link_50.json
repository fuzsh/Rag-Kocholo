        "text": "When something is good, really good, it can be hard to imagine better. After an extensive, multi-million dollar renaissance, The Inn at Death Valley is now better than ever. Offering guests unprecedented service and luxury at our natural oasis in the middle of Death Valley National Park has always been our calling card, but our extensive changes have elevated the experience to new heights. While improvements have been made to everything from the floors (new saltillo tile) to the ceiling, we are most proud of these innovations:\n\nA New First Impression\n\nRoll up the landscaped drive and enjoy the expansive view of Death Valley National Park, the towering date palms and bubbling fountain that springs forth from the natural oasis. What was once only hardscape has been transformed into a lush and inviting experience.\n\nRefined Relaxation\n\nThe lounge, lobby, and bar area have all received extensive updates including new furnishings, a completely new bar, and historic paintings that help tell the story of the first pioneers that graced our oasis. In addition to the bar and lounge area, we are pleased to introduce the Inn’s Library, the ideal place to lose yourself in your favorite novel (or borrow one of ours) while taking in astounding views.\n\nRefreshed Rooms\n\nOld-school ambience marries modern style and amenities. You’ll be tempted to settle in but, there is so much more to savor.\n\nCasitas\n\nDiscover unmatched privacy and luxury in the shadow of the Oasis Gardens’ date palms. Enjoy your favorite cocktail while you hear the wind rustle through the palms overhead.\n\nSame Spring-Fed Pool, Enhanced Poolside Services\n\nThe historic, tiled pool is a welcome throwback. Soak in the spring-fed waters, sample the treatments offered in the new and nurturing spa, and seek midday shade under the cabanas. If so inclined, step into the state-of-the-art fitness center and keep your fitness goals on track.\n\nThe Inn isn’t your cookie-cutter hotel of today. This classic beauty has many different types of rooms based on the location of the room within the hillside lodge.\n\nStandard King Rooms\n\nOur Standard Rooms take advantage of the views over the Oasis Garden, desert vistas or Panamint Mountains and have a king bed. All rooms have a 3/4-bath with a shower only. These rooms may be located in either the Main Tower, or on the Terrace Level above the pool.\n\nDeluxe King Rooms\n\nThe Deluxe King rooms are slightly larger rooms that take advantage of views over the oasis garden, desert vistas, or Panamint Mountains. These rooms feature 1 King bed, 3/4 bath with shower and a decorative fireplace.\n\nStandard Hillside Room – King\n\nOur Standard Hillside Rooms are ideal for intimate weekend stays. These non-view rooms feature a king bed with a 3/4 bath with a shower only.\n\nSuites\n\nOur one-bedroom suites include a king-sized bed, and the added space of an attached living room for entertaining or relaxing. All suites have a 3/4 bath with a shower only.\n\nPool Bungalow\n\nOur Pool Bungalow gives you the luxury of being just steps away from our spring-fed swimming pool, as well as a splendid view of the Death Valley desert. This stand-alone room also includes a queen bed and 3/4 bath with shower only. The solid stone walls sourced from the surrounding desert and vaulted ceiling offer a unique lodging experience.\n\nCasitas\n\nLocated in the shadow of the Oasis Gardens’ date palms, the Inn’s Casitas offer unparalleled privacy and luxury within easy walking distance of the Inn pool. Each Casita comes with a golf cart for guests to use to get around the property (cars cannot get down to these rooms) as well as room options with either 1 King bed or 2 Queen beds. In addition to the main sleeping quarters, each Casita also has a living room with a sleeper sofa as well as a wet bar – perfect for fixing your cocktail of choice while you hear the wind rustle through the palms overhead.\n\nAccessible Rooms\n\nAccessible rooms with roll-in showers are available.

Please call (760) 786-2345 ext 120 to reserve your relaxation experience.\n\nSauna (Inn guests only)\n\nSpring-fed swimming pools at both the Inn and Ranch\n\nAn Oasis in the Desert\n\nLike many great national park hotels, the historic AAA Four Diamond Inn at Death Valley was financed and built by a company in an industry not directly related to hospitality. Unlike the great lodges built by the railroads in several of our famous parks, however, the Inn was built by a mining company.\n\nIn the 1920s, the Pacific Coast Borax Company followed the lead of the successful Palm Springs Desert Inn and entered the tourism business by building a magnificent Inn for guests to enjoy the rare beauty of Death Valley.\n\nThe historic Inn at Death Valley was built in 1927 by the Pacific Coast Borax Company as a means to save their newly built Death Valley Railroad.\n\nThe Inn opened for business on February 1, 1927 with 12 guest rooms, a dining room and lobby area. Room rates were $10 per night and included meals.\n\nOver the following eight years additions were constructed and improvements made. In 1928, construction crews added 10 guest rooms, and in 1929 the Travertine Springs were tapped for electricity and water for a new swimming pool. The spring water is still used for irrigating the Inn’s gardens and flow-through pool. More rooms were constructed until the Inn reached 66 rooms in 1935.\n\nThe Inn was designed by prominent Los Angeles architect Albert C. Martin and landscape architect Daniel Hull. Martin’s work includes the first theater owned by Sid Grauman, of Grauman’s Chinese Theater fame, as well as the Los Angeles City Hall. Hull designed the master-planned Grand Canyon Village, Old Faithful Lodge and several structures in Rocky Mountain National Park and Yosemite National Park, including the iconic Ahwahnee Hotel.\n\nThe 66-room, AAA Four Diamond Inn sits sprawled across a low hill at the mouth of Furnace Creek Wash and features spectacular views of Death Valley and the Panamint Mountains to the west. The Inn opened in 1927 and was finished in 1935.\n\nSurrounded by mountain ranges, Death Valley features a startling variety of desert environments: pristine sand dunes, huge alluvial fans, eerie salt formations and painted canyons. Its mountainsides and rock formations are a geologist’s fantasy come true. The clear desert air highlights nature’s art at every turn, from the glittering saltpan basin to the snow-capped Panamint Range high above Death Valley’s floor. Ancient peoples inhabited the area when the valley floor was a huge lake. The passage of time has turned this lake into the lowest, saltiest place in the Northern Hemisphere. To some, the newly named Death Valley was an obstacle in the path toward the California gold fields. To others, it promised riches beyond belief in ore and minerals. In 1933, in recognition of its striking wild beauty, this unique desert wilderness was designated a National Monument. Today it is a National Park.\n\nThe Inn’s location was well chosen but rather conspicuous. As the National Park Service reports, in less skilled hands the Inn could have been a visual imposition on the otherwise natural landscape, but Martin and Hull created a masterpiece in harmony with history and scenery. Their design incorporated red tile roofs, stucco exteriors, archways, arcades and a tower all inspired by the old Spanish Missions on the California Coast.\n\nThe Inn’s wings wrap around a lovely garden of palms and flowing water, a nod to both mission courtyards and the Hollywood image of a fantasy desert oasis. The lower levels constructed of local stone seem to be a natural extension of the alluvial fan pouring out of Furnace Creek Wash. The colors of golden stucco, russet roof tiles and turquoise window trim all match the badlands at Zabriskie Point and Artists Drive.\n\nRates\n\nYour deposit guarantees the first night’s room rate.
