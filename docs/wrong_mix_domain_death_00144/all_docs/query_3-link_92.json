        "text": "12/6/2010\n\nI never met Clark Gable but I lived in San Gabriel where Clark Gable and wife lived in about two acres of land. The acreage is gone but the house is still there and has visiting hours. I was in grammer school and passed by there everyday. It seemed like a big jungle to me with all the trees and bushes.\n\nI never met Clark Gable but one of my fondest teen-age memories is when we passed each other on the escalator at the old Broadway Hollywood Department Store at the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street. He was 57 or 58 at the time and yes, he really was that good looking even at that time of his life. Never spoke a word to him but seeing him that one time has provided a memory that has lasted over half a century.\n\nOther people with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame connected to Gable? Just about anybody who worked at the same time. Carole Lombard, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, Spencer Tracy, Charles Laughton, Franchot Tone, Bette Davis, Norma Shearer, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly and Marilyn Monroe, just to mention a few.\n\nAnother place that was important to Gable outside of Hollywood was the ranch that he and Lombard owned in Encino in the San Fernando Valley, about twenty miles from Hollywood. They are not to be considered as \"Valley Gentry\". They actually worked the ranch as much as they made movies. The house is still there.\n\nDoes Gable deserve a star on the Walk of Fame? Does that question need to be asked?\n\nI never met him but I would loved to have been in his presence once. All of the other stars should have some connection with him. They could have learned something. All of the world should be important to him. He was important and admired by all who saw him. He should have the biggest star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame."
