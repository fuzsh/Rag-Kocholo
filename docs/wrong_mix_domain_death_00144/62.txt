Clark Gable III, the grandson of Hollywood legend Clark Gable, died in Dallas, Texas in February.

His body was found by a friend inside his Dallas home at about 8 a.m., Feb. 22, according to police.

Gable died as a result of the combined toxic effects of fentanyl, oxycodone and alprazolam, The Dallas County Medical Examiner said.

The 30-year-old was the latest host of the Dallas-based television show, "Cheaters," which features people suspected of infidelity. He is survived by his fianc√©e and their infant daughter.

News about his death was posted on the show's Facebook page Friday afternoon.[[506233971,C]]

He was Clark Gable's only grandson.

Gable's death was the latest in a national opioid crisis that the Centers for Disease Control says claimed 48,000 lives in 2017. The manufacturer of Oxycodone last month agreed to pay $270 million to settle one of thousands of lawsuits blaming it in the crisis.
