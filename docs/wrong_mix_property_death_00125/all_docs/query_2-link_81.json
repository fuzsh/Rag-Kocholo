He worked for McKim, Mead & White and Bertram Grovesnor Goodhue from 1916 to 1923. His brother-in-law was married to John D. Rockefeller Jr's daughter, Abigail, and Harrison served as a designer and architectural adviser for Nelson Rockefeller, notably when Rockefeller was governor of New York.\n\nHarrison started his professional career with the firm of Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray, participating in the construction of Rockefeller Center. In 1931-1932, Harrison joined with Max Abramowitz before Abramowitz left for France, returning in 1934. In 1935, Harrison formed a partnership with J. Andre Fouilhoux. In 1941 Abramowitz became a partner and the firm was known as Harrison, Fouilhoux and Abramovitz until Fouilhoux's death in 1945. The firm became known as Harrison & Abramowitz from 1945-1976, during which time it designed scores of university and corporate buildings, including Time Life (1959) and Socony- Mobil (1956).\n\nAmong Harrison's most noted projects are the Metropolitan Opera House at the Lincoln Center and the Empire State Plaza in Albany; Director of Planning on the United Nations complex, which was built on property contributed by the Rockefeller family; master planner and supervising architect for the World's Fairs of 1939 (with Fouilhoux) and 1964 and LaGuardia and Idlewild (now JFK) airport.\n\nHarrison was a member of the US Commission of Fine Arts from 1955 to 1959. In 1967, Harrison received the AIA Gold Medal. Harrison's architectural drawings and archives are held by the Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library at Columbia University. Harrison was married to Ellen Hunt Milton in 1926. They had a daughter, Sarah, and lived in Manhattan NY and Seal Harbor ME.

Frequent visitors and guests included Nelson Rockefeller, Robert Moses, Marc Chagall, and Corbusier.\n\nShortly after purchasing the property in 1931, Harrison bought the Aluminaire House designed by Albert Frey and A. Lawrence Kocher and relocated it to the property. Aluminaire will be reassembled in Palm Springs in 2021. Photos by Javier Haddad.

Nelson Rockefeller hired Harrison in 1948 to create the International Basic Economy Corporation in order to build profitable housing projects in Latin America. After visiting several areas Harrison returned to New York and began working out the details of a simple box plan. The experiments eventually became the IBEC Method and one of the first housing projects was started in San Juan. Villa Las Lomas was a 1500 home project that began in 1954. With the method Harrison put together, they were able to construct 6 homes a day, two basic models with 3 different facades. IBEC followed this with similar developments in Chile, Peru, and Iran.
