Rockefeller drops out of high school two months shy of commencement. He enters a professional school, where he studies double-entry bookkeeping, penmanship, banking, and commercial law.\n\nSeptember 26, 1855\n\nAt 16, Rockefeller gets his first job, working for Hewitt & Tuttle, commission merchants and produce shippers. He would celebrate \"job day\" the rest of his life.\n\nRockefeller starts keeping careful accounts of his finances in Ledger A, where he meticulously notes every receipt, expenditure and charitable donation.\n\n1859\n\nCharles Darwin's On the Origin of Species is published.

The war at first disrupts industry, but ultimately it will accelerate economic development in the North, contributing to Rockefeller's meteoric ascent.\n\n1863\n\nAt 24, Rockefeller gets involved in the oil business, along with partners Maurice Clark and Samuel Andrews. Andrews, Clark & Co. builds a refinery in The Flats, Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area, which will soon be linked to the East Coast hubs by the Atlantic and Great Western Railroad.\n\nSeptember 8, 1864\n\nRockefeller marries Laura Celestia (\"Cettie\") Spelman in a small, private ceremony, following a nine-year courtship.\n\n1865\n\nAt 25, Rockefeller buys out his partners and founds Rockefeller & Andrews, Cleveland's largest refinery.\n\nLaura gives birth to the Rockefellers' first child, Elizabeth (\"Bessie\").\n\n1868\n\nRockefeller strikes a major deal with a railroad, guaranteeing a certain volume of shipments in exchange for rebates.

Following the so-called \"Cleveland Massacre,\" Rockefeller owns 22 of the 26 refineries in town.\n\nLaura gives birth to Edith.\n\nSeptember 18, 1873\n\n\"Black Thursday.\" The stock exchange crash sets off a depression that will last six years.

Just as electricity is starting to replace kerosene as an illuminant, gasoline enters the scene, creating a rising demand for oil.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., starts working at 26 Broadway. During the first few years, his role there will be marginal and ill defined.\n\nStandard Oil contributes $250,000 to Republican William McKinley's presidential campaign against Democrat William Jennings Bryan, a supporter of antitrust legislation. The candidates' opposing views about trusts polarize public opinion on the issue.\n\n1898\n\nBetween 1898 and 1902, many follow the Rockefeller business model; 198 trusts are created in coal, sugar, and other industries.\n\n1901\n\nJ. P. Morgan purchases Carnegie Steel from Andrew Carnegie, leading to the creation of U.S. Steel, the first billion-dollar corporation and a landmark in business consolidation.\n\nRockefeller Institute for Medical Research is created.

III.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller, Sr.'s, father, Bill Rockefeller, dies at age 96.\n\nPresident Roosevelt's attacks on Rockefeller and Standard Oil escalate.

Rockefeller, Sr.'s, eldest daughter Bessie dies at age 40.\n\n1907\n\nThe U.S. government has seven different suits pending against Standard Oil.
