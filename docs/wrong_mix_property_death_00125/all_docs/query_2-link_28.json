        "text": "Laura Spelman Rockefeller (born September 9, 1839, Wadsworth, Ohio, U.S.—died March 12, 1915, Pocantico Hills, New York) was an American educator and philanthropist who was the wife of John D. Rockefeller of the famed Rockefeller family.\n\nBoth of Spelman’s parents were active in social causes; her father, a wealthy businessman, was an abolitionist involved in the Underground Railroad, and her mother supported the temperance movement. In 1859 Laura began working as a teacher in Cleveland, and three years later she became an assistant principal. In 1862 she began a relationship with Rockefeller, a former classmate, and the couple shared a strong involvement in the church. They married in 1864 and eventually had four daughters, one of whom died very young, and a son, John D. Rockefeller, Jr."
