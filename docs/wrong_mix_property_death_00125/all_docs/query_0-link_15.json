        "text": "When Nelson A. Rockefeller became New York governor in 1959, he only had a few hours to move into the Executive Mansion in Albany before guests would arrive for his inaugural dinner party. As Alfred H. Barr, Jr.–a Rockefeller family friend and the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA)–recalled, Rockefeller hastily, yet meticulously set up some of his favorite art pieces to be out on display, transforming the straitlaced Victorian politician residence into an energetic contemporary art gallery.[1] A cubist painting by Georges Braque hung above a sitting room fireplace, flanked by a Paul Klee. On a coffee table stood an abstract sculpture by Lynn Chadwick. As official guests entered the mansion for a formal inaugural reception, they were surrounded by walls of breakthrough contemporary art. Rockefeller's art collection, much like himself, always seemed to turn heads and intrigue onlookers.\n\nnar_1.png\n\nNelson A. Rockefeller's love for art, and especially for contemporary art, originated with his mother, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. She displayed her eclectic collection on the seventh floor of the Rockefeller home where Nelson grew up, and during his time at Dartmouth, she granted Nelson an art collecting allowance to cultivate his independent passion for collecting.[2] As much as Abby Aldrich Rockefeller appreciated art for her own private contemplation, she also believed in making art accessible to the public. Identifying a need for an institution that challenged the classical canon of art, in 1929, she co-founded and served on the first board of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), where Nelson would later find himself.[3] Recalling her philosophy that art \"makes one more sane and sympathetic, more observant and understanding,\" Nelson credited his mother for nourishing his creativity and spirit through art.[4]\n\nnar_2.png\n\nInspired by his mother's comparable passion for art and propelled by his own curiosity and creativity, Rockefeller's art collection included works from many different times and places. Particularly during his years in political office, Rockefeller had a personal affinity towards works of abstract expressionism, a post-World War II art movement that developed out of New York City. The busy, provocative works of Pablo Picasso and Jackson Pollock reflected Rockefeller's equally exuberant personality. Simultaneously, he also collected folk art of North and Central America, the sculpture of Africa and Southeast Asia, Japanese prints, and porcelain out of eighteenth- century Europe. Towards the later end of his life, after the American pop art movement reached its peak in the mid-1960's, Rockefeller commissioned Andy Warhol to create portraits of his wife, Happy Rockefeller, and of himself.[5]\n\nnar_3.png\n\nAs much as art collecting was a personal passion of his, Nelson A. Rockefeller also believed in bringing art to the public. He began shaping the art world when he was only twenty-one as a member of the MoMA's first Junior Advisory Committee, a museum of which he would later become President and a key donor.[6] After his son, Michael C. Rockefeller, vanished tragically on an expedition to New Guinea, Nelson founded New York's Museum of Primitive Art, now recognized as the Michael C. Rockefeller Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.[7] As governor of New York, he established the New York State Council for the Arts: the first state government agency to provide arts subsidies and the model for the National Endowment for the Arts.[8]\n\nnar_4.png\n\nAs with the artists he loved, Rockefeller was a visionary; only he painted with his policies and leadership. Known for his autonomy, conviction, and unyielding efforts at solving problems with policy, Rockefeller was confident in and driven by achieving his goals. Writer Francine du Plessix Gray called him \"the highest man in public office to be a champion of the avant-garde.\"[9]\n\nListed below are forty-one artworks that originally comprised a small fraction of Nelson A. Rockefeller's expansive art collection. While most of Rockefeller's collection lives in private collections or as a part of the Rockefeller family's Kykuit Estate Heritage Trust, the pieces listed are all works that now belong to art museums open to the public, including some in our very own Hood Museum!
