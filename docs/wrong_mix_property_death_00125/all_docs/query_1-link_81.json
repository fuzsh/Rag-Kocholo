        "text": "High society fixture Mark Rockefeller is divorcing his wife of 22 years, Renee Rockefeller.\n\nMark — a fourth-generation member of the Rockefeller family and son of former US Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, who worked under President Gerald Ford — filed for divorce in New York Supreme Court on Thursday. The divorce is uncontested.\n\nMark, 53, and Renee, 50, who are regulars on the gala scene in New York, married in 1988 and have four children. They have a lavish home on Park Avenue, plus an estate near Jackson Hole, Wyoming.\n\nIt is not clear how much Mark is worth, but the Rockefeller family is said to have a fortune of $11 billion, split between 174 members, according to Forbes.\n\nIt is believed the couple separated around two years ago, but have remained friends, quietly hashing out the terms of their divorce.\n\nA source said, “This divorce has been going on for years. This is just the first filing. Renee and Mark are friends and have even been spending the COVID lockdown together with their kids and the rest of the family at the Rockefeller family estate in Westchester.”\n\nAnother source said, “The Rockefellers still have substantial wealth. Mark is fairly political and has talked about running for local office.” He has also served as an associate in the acquisition finance group at Chase Securities and was elected chairman of the non-profit organization Historic Hudson Valley.\n\nRenee is a lawyer and was, until recently, an associate at New York firm Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft. She is currently on the board of directors of public art organization Creative Time.\n\nShe has, however, been through some bumpy times as of late. Page Six revealed in February 2018 she was allegedly caught shoplifting a pair of earrings at a store in the Four Seasons Hotel in Punta Mita, Mexico. She strongly denied stealing, saying the claim was “false”.\n\nOur source said she was stopped by security guards and forced to hand the earrings back, but she was not arrested. She was on a trip with pals including Tory Burch, Monique Lhuillier and Jamie Tisch to celebrate Tisch’s birthday.\n\nAlso, in August 2018 she was pulled over by cops in the Hamptons for using her cell phone while driving her car. She was given a 5-point ticket and paid a fine.\n\nAndrea Vacca is representing Mark Rockefeller in the divorce. She told us, “There is nothing to say. They want to keep this private.” Renee Rockefeller is represented by attorney MaryEllen Linnehan, who was not available for comment.\n\nAdditional reporting by Priscilla DeGregory"
