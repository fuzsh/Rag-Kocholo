        "text": "Introduction\n\nThis manual offers a list of VSL Percussion instruments that can be triggered in Sibelius with help of the VE Percussion and VE SY-Percussion (SY-Player)sound sets and all supported articulations. It is for users who have at least one of the following libraries licensed:\n\nPercussion (sound set VE Percussion)\n\nElements (sound set VE Percussion)\n\nPercussion Single Instruments (Celesta, Glockenspiel, Vibraphone, Xylophone, Marimbaphone, Tamtams & Gongs, Bells, Exotic Percussion, Cymbals, Drums and Toms, Timpani) (sound set VE Percussion)\n\nElements Single Instruments (XXL Tamtam, Glass instruments, Lithophone, Bass Waterphone) (sound set VE Percussion)\n\nSynchron Percussion I-III (collection or single groups) (sound set VE SY-Percussion (SY-Player))\n\nSYNCHRON-ized Percussion (sound set VE SYzd Percussion)\n\nSYNCHRON-ized Elements (sound sets VE SY-Percussion (SY-Player) and VE SYzd Percussion)\n\nThe usage of two or three of the percussion sound sets together in one Sibelius playback configuration may bring erratic results.\n\nHow to trigger articulations with the Sound Sets VE Percussion and VE SYzd Percussion\n\nWhich presets to load\n\nVienna Instruments version: The articulation changes only work correctly with the VI presets from the folder Sibelius/Percussion/â¦ loaded.\n\nSYNCHRON-ized version: VelXF rolls presets are recommended.\n\nWhen using the Percussion sound set, make sure that you also import the \"Vienna Symphonic Library\" House Style. In the Import House Style menu at least keep Playback dictionary and Instrument definitions selected. Lots of instruments will not work properly or only with some articulations if you donât import the House Style.\n\nPlease note that because of the big variety of instruments and articulations not every available sound can be covered with these sound sets. Donât worry though, you will get pretty much all the important ones and even will be able to change beaters with commands from your score.\n\nTimpani A+B\n\nUse the Sibelius instrument and the Manual Sound Sets Program \"Timpani\".\n\nThe Timpani automatically switch between left and right hand hits.\n\nSingle hits: Triggered by default.\n\nSecco: Triggered with the staccato mark or one of the following Technique text commands: \"mute\", \"damp\", \"secco\".

Therefore the Sibelius instrument \"Unpitched Percussion by pitch\" from the \"Vienna Symphonic Library\" House Style and the Manual Sound Sets program with the same name are needed. This works with any Vienna Instruments or Synchron Player preset. The samples can then be triggered by entering the pitch they are mapped to.\n\nIf keyswitches are needed for articulation changes, those switches must be entered as notes or MIDI commands. To keep the layout clean, these keyswitches can be added to Voice 2 (or 3) and get hidden."
