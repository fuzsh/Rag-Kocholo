        "text": "I dunno - the jazz combo & big band charts I'm looking at online are pretty detailed. I think you're underestimating the use of charts in certain genres. Rock ain't a genre where chart is needed for drummer, but I see lots of music stands and charts used by drummer in jazz. But small combos where they've been playing together or it's a loose group I don't see them. Lots of entrance requirements I see for college level jazz majors say something like \"Students will be required to sight read a big-band chart, a rhythm sheet and/or a lead sheet.\" I guess they're evaluated on how well they read the music.\n\nA rhythm sheet and a lead sheet is what I was talking about. It's _extremely_ rare to have a drumset \"groove\" notated at all. Pro-level charts for a big band will say something like \"up tempo swing\", or \"medium latin\", with slash notation showing the form. The only actual notes written on the chart are the unison figures and ensemble hits that the drummer needs to set up. And that's if there is a rhythm chart at all -- 50% of the time, I was playing from lead trumpet charts.\n\nHigh school jazz band charts are the only ones I've seen where parts are actually written, and even on those, experienced players know to all-but-ignore those parts.\n\nI have a degree in jazz performance and have played in big bands across the US and Europe (including both at Birdland and Lincoln Center), so please believe me when I tell you I know what I'm talking about.\n\nThis is what a professional \"drum\" chart for a big band would look like:\n\nHere's another type of drum chart. This gives a bit more indication of what you're playing, but even the composer arranger wouldn't expect you to play exactly what's on the chart -- it's a stylistic guideline and just the way for the composer to express the most basic parts of the style -- driving quarter pulse and a baio pattern on the kick. If you showed up and played this as written, you would not be doing your job\n\nThis next one is a bad chart. This is what you get in low-level high school \"jazz ensemble\" or \"stage band\" charts. Playing it as written gives a hackneyed performance. It's unnecessary verbose, but still not correct. Don't write charts like this.\n\n(and btw -- the backbeats on this song should definitely be rimshots, but as you can see, they're not notated as such, even on this ridiculous chart)\n\nI'm also not thinking rimshots on back beat in rock etc. on 2&4 are all that important.\n\nAs you've been told by multiple experienced pros in this thread: that's not correct. Rimshots on the backbeat is a FUNDAMENTAL part of correctly playing rock music\n\nI honestly can't tell on recordings if it's a rim shot.\n\nIn 9 times out of 10, it's a rimshot\n\nMaybe they're not all that necessary. In jazz I hear them distinctly as accents, but in rock grooves I'm not able to tell. Since this thread started it got me thinking and Googling but man what you're saying are rim shots I can't tell from just the player hitting a snare in center of head. If I gotta look at what their left hand is doing to tell, well then, that speaks to just how important it is on that money groove for the audience/ hi-fi listener.\n\nDo you have an example of a recording where you can't tell if it's a rimshot? To my ears, everything you've discussed (Mustang Sally, as an example), it's crystal clear that those are rimshots, even just from listening to the track.\n\nA rhythm sheet and a lead sheet is what I was talking about.

It's just a back beat sounds different different snares different tunings different drummers. I've been looking at some rock videos and the dudes playing trad grip a lot of them seem to rest the tip on the drumhead with their hand way high and that ain't no rim shot. But maybe those are the dudes who came from a jazz background. I don't know. Just not ready to accept the premise that rimshots on backbeat are required to play rock correctly. I'm in my late 60's I grew up with that stuff I played in bands in 60's and 70's in the SF Valley and no one every talked about it like you do. Nobody ever came up to the young pimple-faced Bones in 1972 after I played a gig on my tiger striped stencil kit and a worn out head on my '67 Acro and said \"hey man you're doing it all wrong you didn't play rimshots on the 2&4 which is the fundamental way to play rock\" lol. It's just rock, man. Chill."
