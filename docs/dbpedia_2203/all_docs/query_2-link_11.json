        "text": "The How To\n\nThe rimshot is actually a variation of the inward k snare. So, make sure that you have a good inward k before you begin to learn this sound. A lot of people have acquired this sound merely by playing around a little with the tongue once they learnt the inward k snare. However, some might not have done so. Now, the rimshot is extremely useful while doing extremely technical routines, to the extent that a quick rimshot even enhances the technicality of certain beats. Thus, it's a very useful sound for a beatboxer to have in his/her arsenal. Let's get right to the steps:\n\nFirst and foremost, do the inward k snare a few times to get a feel of your tongue positioning. This is important since the position of the tongue at the beginning of the inward k snare is where we want to focus on.\n\nWhile, doing the inward k snare there is an airy sound which follows. What you have to do is reduce that airy sound to exactly 0. Yes, don't use your lungs or your breath while doing the inward k snare. Just use your tongue muscles and throat muscles to drop the middle portion of your tongue (like you did in the inward k). To make it easier, when you seal of your throat with the back part of your tongue, you keep it in that position continuously. You just need to put pressjure from your throat and the tongue to force the middle part of the tongue to drop down.\n\nWhen you finally get the previous step, try to keep on doing it until your muscles get strong enough to produce a loud and crisp sound.\n\nSome Further Detail"
