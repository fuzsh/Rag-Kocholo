One thing that’s bothering me is that I don't have a good sample of those typical rim shots/ clap snare-sounds. Analyzing some Liquidtunes I found out that fundamental peaks way higher than those neuro pitchup snare you find in a lot of sample […]",

        "text": "What is Sample Genie?\n\nWe are a specialist platform designed to help people learn how to make underground D&B through sample packs and tutorials plus other useful information & opportunities.\n\nWhat do I get as a member?\n\nYou can either join as a free member or a full member. Each month we give away a small folder of samples to free members, these are helpful little layers and sounds as well as the odd VSTi patch.\n\nHowever full members get a new folder of around 80 cutting edge samples each month + a fresh tutorial from one of the team. Inside the site there is also a special forum that members use to exchange ideas, and a place where we post exclusive artist Q&A’s and other bonus material.\n\nHow do I sign up?\n\nYou just click the ‘Full membership’ tab at the top and follow the instructions, you’ll be prompted to create a new account and also a subscription via PayPal.\n\nDo I need a PayPal account to set up a membership?\n\nAlthough it’s helpful for you to be able to see your membership inside your paypal account, you can do it without one (CLICK HERE) provided you have a debit / credit card. When setting up the subscription, you can choose ‘Set up without paypal account’ which means you can do it with just a card. This can then only be managed from within your Sample Genie account.\n\nHow does Billing work?\n\nWhen you first sign up, you pay the current months fee on the spot, this gives you access to the latest sample pack and tutorial library. After this you are rebilled on the last day of each month moving forward. This recurring rebilling is for the next months content. So essentially you pay for the forthcoming month a day in advance.\n\nWhen I sign up do I have access to all of the previous tutorials?\n\nover\n\nWhen you sign up, you have instant access to stream every single Sample Genie monthly video form the last 11 years. That’s over 400 videos from 63 artists.\n\nIf I leave and then come back do I get to still see videos from previous months when I was a full member?\n\nYes, videos that were available then will become re-available again.\n\nHow do I cancel?\n\nReally easy, you just go to account> subscription and cancel from there. You will still have access to the current month’s content, but no further re billing will occur after this.\n\nAre older sample packs available to buy?\n\nNot at the moment, we keep things fresh and changing each month and don’t redistribute past monthly sample packs. Once they are gone – they are gone."
