        "text": "Sound\n\nAcoustic Drum Sounds\n\nDRUMITY offers an enormous selection of acoustic sounds. 133 acoustic bass drums, 164 snares with five articulations (rimshot, open hit, shallow rimshot, side stick, shallow hit). Toms and cymbals are also represented in more than ample selection. The sound list can be found in the manual.\n\nThere are 15 articulations for hi-hats, which are run with the MIDI Controller 4. Their threshold values can be adjusted in the PC Editor and app. The âsmooth layer crossoverâ ensures perfect transitions.\n\nElectronic Drum Sounds\n\nDo you need the hip e-drum sounds of the TR-808 or CR-78 for your production? The sounds and beats of these drum computers influenced electronic dance music and were also employed by pop music giants like Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel and Marvin Gaye (âSexual Healingâ) with great success. DRUMITY incorporates these legendary original sounds, but also offers modified e-drum sounds, such as closed and half open TR-808 hi-hats.\n\nPercussion Sounds\n\nDRUMITY is a distinguished global player: it contains percussion instruments from Latin America, India, TÃ¼rkiye, Africa, and Asia. Classical orchestra percussion, from the triangle and gong to the large, 36-inch Grand Casa, is as integral to the drum expanderâs repertoire as the equally large selection of world percussion.\n\nThere are 180 samples of the conga, along with its close relatives the tumba (low) and quinto (high). These include the various hand techniques (articulations) used to play the instruments, without which an authentic sound wouldnât be possible. Conga, tumba and quinto are available in 9 articulations: open, open short, slap, mute, slap mute, thumb, rim mute, dynamic open to slap, and dynamic open to mute.\n\nUp to 20 different articulations are available for exotic percussion instruments like the Turkish bass darbuka. Percussion sounds use a âsmooth muteâ mode. Open, long samples are stopped by muting the slap sample.\n\nMallets, Pianos, Synths...\n\nDRUMITY offers 150 programs with chromatic instruments in addition to purely percussive sounds: marimba, grand piano, synthesizer, chromatic tabla, hang, gamelan, steel drums, bianzhong.\n\nApp for iOS and Google Android\n\nThe app V3 DRUM CONTROL, designed exclusively for tablets, is compatible with iOS and Android systems. The app is available for download in your online app store. The V3 BLUETOOTH RECEIVER, available for 90 euros, is required for wireless data transfer between the app and your DRUMITY sound expander.\n\nThe app and PC Editor control up to 38 notes and 100 sound banks. Up to 300 drumkits can be saved in the app. Sound, volume, room, reverb, pan, tuning and audio-out are all adjustable parameters.\n\nAll information about the app can be found here.\n\nHardware\n\nHardware\n\nDRUMITY has 256-voice polyphony and a 4GB internal flash memory. The sound expander offers 2 stereo outputs: Stereo main is connected to 2 resonance processors that can enhance each sound with room and reverb; aux-out can be set to either stereo or dual mono mode.\n\nTrigger Input\n\nThe assignment of trigger note numbers in DRUMITY is fixed. You must use Note 36 for the bass drum. Hi-hat articulations are controlled by the standard hi-hat controller CC4. The transitions between hi-hat 100% open, 75% open, 50% open, and 25% open are adjusted by 4 values in the PC Editor and the app. The hi-hat note numbers must be set according to the table of assigned numbers.\n\nThere are 2 options for the âcymbal chokeâ: a Key-Aftertouch-Message, which is standard with most e-drums, or with a second trigger. A cymbal crash stops with a hit on a second trigger.\n\nLayer Trigger\n\nSounds on the Various 1 and 2 triggers can be routed to Note 38/Snare or 36/Bass Drum using the \"Link-Snare\" and \"Link-Bassdrum\" parameters. If you set e.g. claps here, both the snare and this instrument will sound when the snare 38 is triggered.\n\nLatency\n\nA technical trick prevents any latency when using the app. The sound triggers are directly connected to MIDI-IN at the same time the app sends control signals through USB-IN."
