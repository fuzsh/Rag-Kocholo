        "text": "909-inspired analog rimshot and clave generator with state variable filter\n\nLike the other Mutant Drums, the Rimshot is capable of going above and beyond vanilla sounds. Expressive CV options, an external input and a multi-mode analog filter let you create unique percussion sounds in your modular synthesizer.\n\nRimshot or clave - take your pick.\n\nTriple-oscillator analog rimshot core inspired by the legendary 909\n\nThree modes of percussion synthesis: rimshot HI (classic), rimshot LO and clave (CLV)\n\nVoltage control of one of the oscillators' pitch\n\nExternal input to the filter lets you blend in other signal sources - wavetables and noise make for interesting percussion!\n\nRimshot DRIVE control acts as a volume and overdrive control for the rimshot generator\n\nCoupled to an analog multi-mode filter\n\nBandpass, highpass and lowpass modes\n\nSelf-oscillation of the filter plays nicely when mixed in with the rimshot generator\n\nResonance clipping enabled by default. Feature can be disabled with a switch on the back of the module\n\nVoltage controlled cutoff\n\nAdjustable resonance\n\nModulation options sculpt the shape of your percussion\n\nThe MOD DECAY envelope controls the duration of the Rimshot\n\nAn internal modulation bus routes MOD DECAY to the filter's cutoff (adjust amount with the VCF MOD control) - perfect for percussive sweeps on the filter when self-oscillating\n\nDesigned for the contemporary modular synthesizer\n\nEurorack-compatible control voltage inputs (0 to 5V for full modulation) with bipolar attenuverters\n\nA practical analog trigger circuit allows activation of the Rimshot from many signal sources (anything with a positive-going edge lasting 2ms or longer). Most electronic drum pads can also directly trigger the Mutant Rimshot.\n\nAn accent input accepts analog voltage control (0 to 5V will fully modulate the volume from low to high)"
