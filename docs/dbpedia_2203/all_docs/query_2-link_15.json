But it's interesting they don't tackle rimshots:\n\n\"We've analysed and synthesized timpani, kick drums, snare drums, cymbals, hi-hats, bells, cowbells and claves, and that's enough to get anyone started. Sure, we could go on to recreate toms, rimshots, hand claps, congas, and any number of other percussion instruments, but many of these use the principles we have already discussed.\"\n\nhttps://www.soundonsound.com/techniques/synthesizing-cowbells-claves\n\nThat was exactly my first try after studying the schematics, but it seems like I wasn't patient enough yesterday.\n\nGave it another try and whoops ... the second version is even closer I think!\n\nSee\n\nTrack 1 is what I did yesterday and Track 2 has the updated rim shot.\n\nI Guess the SoS guys have elegantly avoided doing the rim shot because they've found that talking about theory is easier üòÅ\n\nBTW, the amp env hold time is a critical element too, although it's only a few milliseconds."
