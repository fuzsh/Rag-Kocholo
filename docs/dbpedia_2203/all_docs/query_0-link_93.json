I promptly returned to my pint forgetting about the idea.\n\nIn a moment of bordem the idea returned to me this weekend, and then I remembered we now have the <audio> tag (actually we've had it for over 18 months).\n\nNow the bookmarklet is no code at all!\n\nDrag the bookmarklet up to your bookmark bar, and if the browser supports HTML5, then you can fire off a rimshot or 'wah-wah-wahh' next time you near something daft in the office!\n\nRimshot\n\nWah-wah-wahh\n\nI'm running the sound files off of a Google code project, so if you want some other daft sound, ping me and we'll add it in (or if you have better sound files)."
