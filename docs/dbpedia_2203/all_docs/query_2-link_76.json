Then add a “ssshh” sound together while sucking the air in.\n\nPush the pressure between your tongue and your mouth while trying to make the rim shot sound, and try to make it shorter.\n\nTry to add the rim shot sound to 2 more phares to make a rhythm. You can try a kick sound (poop) and high hot sound (psst) plus the rim shot sound all together.\n\nZipper sound is also produced by sucking the air and using the Monalisa Smile. Make sure that your lips are vibrating when you make the sound.\n\nTry making the zipper sound short just like the rim shot sound.\n\nTry putting the zipper sound along with the other beat box sound.\n\nPractice repeating the sounds and do any variations of the sounds whichever order you are comfortable.\n\nNow try to make the beat box rhythm on a didgeridoo.\n\nKeep practicing.\n\nGive it a try, let us know how you go and if you get stuck, post a question in the comments section below"
