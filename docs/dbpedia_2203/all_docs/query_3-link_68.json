If you have full Kontakt, then you'll have the Kontakt Factory Library. If you open that, then go to the \"Band\" folder, then \"Drum Kits\", there's a kit in there called \"Central Stage Kit\" that has a nice ringy snare similar to that.\n\nAs far as other purchases go, I'd heartily recommend a Kontakt library called \"Realidrums\". It has loads of snare options (as well as all the other parts of the kit.). Lots of awesome tight snappy snares in that library.\n\nAnother suggestion would be the \"Metal Foundry\" SDX expansion for Superior Drummer 3\n\n(edited to add: a cool way of getting extra \"ringyness\" out of a snare is to use a transient plugin on the snare channel. For example, NI's \"Transient Master\" plugin with the \"Drum Crusher\" preset )\n\nRegular acoustic snare as claimed above. Now materials make the difference.\n\nBy having BFD3 and by not knowing about drums, it helped me to better understand a bit about drums and the snare sounds for instance. By auditioning the several snare types you get a better idea. So I'm probably wrong but I think that is a Metal Snare (material, not wood nor acrylic here) and dimensions are probably 6.5\" x 14\" with mesh on. Look for \"Black Beauty\" (Metallica's Black album snare, and hundreds of others) another one can be a Copper Top, a metal snare that is 5\"x14\".\n\nCheck this video on metal snare hits and see if you find a similar one for reference. Because a direct hit vs a rim shot vs an edge hit sound different too."
