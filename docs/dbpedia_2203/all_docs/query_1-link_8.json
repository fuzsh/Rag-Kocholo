        "text": "Hi Jef, I just meant circle-X for cross-stick (which is fairly common usage) to be able to distinguish between the (non cross-stick) hit on rim, which you also use.\n\nBy \"circle with two slashes,\" I mean a circle bisected by two vertical lines -- as opposed to the single line you are using for a single-stick rimshot.
