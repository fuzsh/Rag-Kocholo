        "text": "This is probably something I should have figured out a couple of decades ago, but lately I have been thinking about whether I should be using rimshots more. I am NOT talking about using them in un-mic'ed situations to cut through loud amps at high volumes. I almost always play with a mic on the snare at least. In the few instances where there are no mics on the drums, it's a low volume kinda deal and rimshots wouldn't be appropriate. But lately, I have been wondering about whether to use them on backbeats more often.\n\nMany players (including studio players) talk of hitting a rimshot on every backbeat. I have always played backbeats without the rim and used the rimshot only as an accent in certain fills or in a part of the song that needs to be louder than the rest. I have always viewed the rimshot as primarily a way of acheiving greater volume, not greater tone.\n\nPart of this is that I don't care for the nearfield sound of the rimshot generally, although I realize it sounds much different out front. But if mics are being used (and I hit plenty hard already) there is no need for me to generate extra volume out front, so is the sound \"better\" through the mics with a rimshot? If you do use a rimshot on every 2 and 4, for example, how do you bring the dynamic up a notch for a fill if you are already slamming out rimshots every time you hit the snare?\n\nMy view on songs with the rim shot on 2&4 throughout, are usually songs with minimal fills. It's the drive that is most important thus a few crashes and 4 on the floor is generally the modus operandi. I don't view the rimshot as a way to be louder, or a fuller tone, even though you can achive both with it, you should be using all of the snare and not just one aspect of it (rimshots) to get the colors you need. If louder and fuller are what is required, then maybe a bigger/deeper/more sensitive snare is the tool that is needed and then your rimshot will be that much more! \"This snare goes to 11. It's rimshot is one louder!\"\n\nSee this as example:\n\nhttp://www.drummerworld.com/Videos/tommyclufetosamericanwitch.html\n\nHope this helps.\n\nAlso repeated rimshots all night would do your wrist in fairly quickly. Not to mention your sticks.\n\nIn my ears, rimshots are not so much about increased volume as they are about increased frequency response. A center hit will give you a more limited frequency response, and (if you're recording) the EQ meter spectrum analyzer will show a smoother and more singular bump. With a rimshot, you may see a wider and more jagged freq response. The wider response helps you hedge your bets that the snare drum sound will not be masked by another instrument that typically or occasionally inhabits a similar frequency range. I think this is why you'll see drummers in mic'd settings still using rimshots if there's a lot of other amplified instrument sounds too; and sound engineers and FOH engineers in those situations preferring it.\n\nI usually use rimshots for backbeats, even at low volumes, but I start with a low stick height and try to keep them as controlled and consistent as possible. I don't try to increase the volume of the snare drum during fills, but it might still happen sometimes because the stick height often increases during fills.\n\nIn my ears, rimshots are not so much about increased volume as they are about increased frequency response.

I don't try to increase the volume of the snare drum during fills, but it might still happen sometimes because the stick height often increases during fills.\n\nMakes sense to me. Good point by you and others about playing softer rim shots. I tend to only use a hard rim shot or a hard non-rimshot hit for backbeats. I need to experiment with with trying to hit backbeats with the rim to get those extra frequencies, but maybe not hitting as hard overall on those strokes. That would still leave me with another level to go up to for fills. Not all fills need to be at a greater volume, of course, but I hate when I see a drummer slamming out 2 and 4 and then it gets weaker sounding when they go for a fill or play something more intricate. I think Stan Lynch said something in an interview years ago that affected my thinking on this, where he said that he plays at about 80% while keeping time so that he can bring it up to 100% when playing a fill.\n\nI like using rimshots and even in lower volume music, like jazz, I use 'em a bit. I feel like I can play 'em so that they aren't always loud, just another flavor- a kind of \"english\" that I put on a particular hit when want a certain kind of accent. I like playing funky backbeat kind of stuff in a way where I'm alternating between buzzed ghost notes, full hits and then for the real accents, rimshots. To me, that kind of alteration gives the beat a bit more definition that it might otherwise have. I'll consciously play some things without any rimshots too as I like to vary the textures from song to song- rather than coming up with some overall approach that I get locked into for everything.\n\nAlso, rimshots on the toms are cool too. I just do 'em on my rack tom and not even really all that much, though I like the idea of it and it seems that there are certain drummers, like Billy Martin who seem to do that a lot. Any kind of technique where you can throw in another sound... another variation is cool with me. In that way you can really get just a few drums to \"talk\" instead of needing to have a really large kit with lots of toms to get some tonal variations (not that there's anything wrong with that). The players that I tend to be most impressed with more often than not play small kits, but seem to have the ability to get lots and lots of different sounds happening on them.... Rimshots are an ingredient in that.\n\nA latin drummer, on Youtube, was explaining a BossaNova beat.\n\nHe said when you play the snare drum, with the stick flat on the snare, making contact with the rim, the end of the stick should never be positioned between the lugs. Does it really make a difference in the sound?\n\nWell... I'd call that sort of thing a cross stick rather than a rim shot. I personally haven't noticed much of a difference between over the lug and not. A much bigger thing is where on the stick you hit it. There's a sweet spot and too far or not far enough up the stick is dead sounding. That much is pretty obvious to anyone who does much cross stick. If you hit it in the wrong spot, you know and make an adjustment...\n\nActually, I prefer to cross stick between the lugs as that's where I get the best sound; a nice, chunky 'thwack'. And I agree that the distance the stick extends past the rim is critical.\n\nI always turn the stick around when doing these, placing the tip on the head and using the fat part of the stick across the rim. This gives me the best and loudest sound.\n\nIf I need to switch back and forth between cross sticking and normal snare hits I just play the tune using the butt end of the stick from beginning to end. Not a problem...\n\n>>> A much bigger thing is where on the stick you hit it. There's a sweet spot and too far or not far enough up the stick is dead sounding.

If you hit it in the wrong spot, you know and make an adjustment...\n\nThink of that sweet spot when you hit two claves together (and cupping your hand just so for the nice resonance).\n\nI'm also trying to be more aware of consistently using rimshots on backbeats. It makes for a, well, shotgun backbeat - authoritative. But I find that sometimes I'm not happy with the tuning of my snare and I'll back off. I might get a honk or ring that bugs me. My problem I suppose. Think I'll jump to the tuning thread now :-/\n\nTimely thread. Never been all that razor sharp on rimshots, which is something I've been more aware of lately and trying to work on. I'm not an aggressive hitter. It's a hell of a lot easier to get consistency by taking ownership with a nice solid thwack. Quieter, more feel-oriented songs typically involve a more reserved stroke. A missed rimshot results in a conspicuous space/click. With more minimal and gentler playing, precision becomes especially important. One of my old snare stands only extends a certain height, which screws me up. I always seem to end up with the wrong snare stand when I need the good rimshot contact too. If only I could get 'er up a half inch...\n\n...that's what she said."
