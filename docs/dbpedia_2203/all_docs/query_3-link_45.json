If it’s not visible you need to go to the Show menu above and check Velocity Gate to make it visible.\n\nWith that box visible, select the “rim click” articulation in the Articulations drop down list, and set the gate to 1 to 40.\n\nThen select the x stick and set gate to 41 to 126, and last select rimshot and set gate to 127 to 127.\n\nThis requires all the used articulations to be gathered in the same instrument to be able to split like this to one MIDI note.\n\nReply back here if you can’t make it work!"
