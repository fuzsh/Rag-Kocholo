        "text": "I often wonder why I like certain snare drums and crash cymbals so much and why others turn me off so badly. Or more specifically, what exactly am I hearing that evokes those reactions.\n\nFor snare drums, I usually play rimshots, which means the hoops and shell are responsible for a lot of the sound. So what would the frequency response chart look like from a rimshot on a snare that I really like? What are the different frequencies--and their relative intensities--that are produced by the rimshot? And conversely, what would the frequency responses look like for drums that I don't like? Would the frequencies for a cheap steel snare be concentrated more narrowly than the frequencies of a high-end brass or wood snare?\n\nSame thing for a few of my crash cymbals. Would the frequency response from a good whack tell me an interesting story? Would the frequency response chart from one of my favorite cymbals have more frequencies than a cymbal that I don't like? Or might it just be the blending of various frequencies in a more harmonious pattern that sounds so good? Would cymbals with a narrow range of frequencies cut through the loud music better than cymbals with a wide range of frequencies? (and on and on...)\n\nWouldn't it be interesting if every snare drum reviewed in Modern Drummer had a frequency response chart using certain default criteria--same heads, tensioning, stick weight, etc. It would be nice to see which drums had a fat bottom end along with a nice high crack. Or which drums were mostly midrange, etc. Same thing for cymbals.\n\nOf course, there's no substitute for actually playing the drum or cymbal. But in today's drum market with zillions of product lines and insane levels of specialization, it's often difficult or impossible to play the drum or cymbal ahead of time that you are interested in buying.\n\nI'm sure there are a lot of reasons why measuring frequency responses wouldn't be practical. It might be that a chart will tell you the frequencies produced but not help you pick out a good-sounding drum. (Maybe what looks good on paper won't necessarily translate to good sound.) But then again, a lot of the descriptors we use in the drum world aren't always so helpful either: wet, round, fat, thin, dry, boxy, etc.\n\nBut bottom line, even if seeing frequency responses for various instruments wouldn't be a reliable indicator of sound quality, it sure would be interesting.\n\nCheers, Tom N\n\nI owned and operated a small music store for awhile and being a drummer I was forced to learn as much as I could about many other instruments. Guitars and amps were high on my research list. When I was studying material relating to guitar amplifiers I came across an interesting article that was written by an audiophile/sound engineer who was dealing with the subject of; the sound quality produced by tubes (in a guitar amplifier) as opposed to transistors. The part of the article that may have some bearing on your question was a set of oscilloscope graphics depicting the sound waves produced by a tube amp and a transistor amp.\n\nHistorically, tube amps have always been prized for their FAT and rich sound. As opposed to (early) all transistor amps that had a rep for sounding harsh and thin. It turns out that the tube amps were producing 'round' sine waves, while the transistor amps produced a 'square' sine wave. What it translates out to is; square sine waves impact the ear as 'harsh' or 'thin' while the round sine waves of the tube amp impact the ear as 'warm, fat' tones. I have a feeling certain materials/metals used to make drums produce rounder, fatter sound waves than others. Drums that produce a square-ish wave would (naturally) sound harsh. That's the experiment. Record a drum that sounds good to you and one that sounds bad, run both signals through an oscilloscope and see if the square wave/round wave theory holds up.\n\nReally interesting question, Tom. I'd like to know myself just out of curiosity.\n\nJohn\n\nYou could do this with just about any modern recording software...Pro Tools, Cubase, Sonar, etc. The trouble is, as you mentioned, is the consistency. Unless you somehow were to create a robotic arm, a la mythbusters, it'd be tough to keep the consistency. That's why frequency response charts that ship with things like microphones, etc. are sent a few different sine waves...1K, etc. They're then usually sent some sort of random noise, pink, white or whatever. Then you can definitely take this chart and know how to use the mic...or it can point you in the right direction.\n\nThat is an interesting topic on the drums. Come to think of it, who cares if the hits are harder, drums tuned different, different heads, etc. Tune the drum the best you can with the head combination that sounds the best and record it. Do you like the sound? Compare that chart to others and, as you say, are there similarities?\n\nInteresting. But then again...the room plays such a critical part in drum sound. You might love a certain drum in the room you're in there and hate it at a gig. I call that the Guitar Center Factor. So, what sounds great that day, in that room, on that particular song, might not work or sound good in another setting.\n\nm"
