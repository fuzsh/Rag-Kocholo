It lacks any kid of body and snap that you would want.\n\nIf you're enjoying that more than a regular snare I would go back and look at how you processed your snare bus, cause you should be able to get a pretty good snare with a small handful of tweaking.\n\nOnly if I want that sort of sound?\n\nI don't know what you're asking.

It's very often used in actual drumming.\n\nI use both.

Always.\n\ni agree with this but i do also feel what hes saying in that if im using the rim shot sound as the main snare its probably because i dont like the snare sample or am not giving it a chance with processing. i may try to combine both! i just felt that the rim shot kind of had that metal \"pop\" so to speak.\n\nTry increasing the attack on the compressor. I go as high as 100ms on very 'natural' sounding snares and it tends to slightly even-out rim-shots with open hits.\n\nGive it a go, see if you like it. Ratio has to be 3:0 or more and threshold low enough to cause a 4-6db reduction.\n\nTry increasing the attack on the compressor.

If you are using superior drummer chances are you are also using a compressor, so it's not very hard to get good cracking snares with the regular hits, which will have a lot more low end and body to them.\n\nBut still this only applies to this particular program, rimshots are absolutely essential in \"heavy\" drumming in general.\n\nGlenn Fricker said in one of his YouTube videos that he'll often ask drummers to use rimshots as their main snare hit. Something about better attack, I think?\n\nYou could always program your drums with normal hits and then blend in rimshots with a lower velocity to fill out the sound."
