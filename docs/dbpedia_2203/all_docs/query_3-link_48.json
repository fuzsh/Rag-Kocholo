        "text": "TD-17 Version 2: Highly Rated, Now Updated\n\nSince its launch, the TD-17 series has powered the progress of drummers everywhere. And now, the journey continues with 20 additional preset kits and 26 pre-loaded samples that you can use in your custom kits. Reverb and Kit Comp effects have also been added, along with 11 more MFX types for shaping drum tones. And with integrated support for Roland Cloud content, you can expand your playing experience with a growing selection of sounds, samples, and custom kits from top V-Drums artists.\n\nThe TD-17 Version 2 update is a free download for current TD-17 module owners.\n\nGreat Sounds Lead to Great Performances\n\nThe TD-17’s sound engine delivers a superior drumming experience, thanks to its advanced Prismatic Sound Modeling technology. Just like acoustic drums, you can play with wide dynamic range and dramatic tonal changes depending on where and how hard you strike the pad. From rimshots, rolls, flams, and ghost notes on the snare to natural hi-hat transitions, dramatic crash hits, sustained cymbal swells, and more, every nuance is detailed, accurate, and ultra-smooth.\n\nFind the Perfect Kit for the Music You Play\n\nThe TD-17 module includes 70 premium-quality preset kits for a range of professional musical scenarios. Experience the warm vibes of “Acoustic,” or play on a small stage with the tight “Shallow Mini” kit. Rock heavy in the wide-open expanse of “Arena Stage,” or go for maximum recording clarity with the clean and defined “BigWoodShell” kit. And that’s just a start—whatever music drives your passion, the TD-17 will help you get there.\n\nDownload Extra Kits from Roland Cloud\n\nYou’re not just limited to the preset kits inside the TD-17 module. Explore an ever-growing range of artist kits at Roland Cloud, including signature setups from pro drummers like Anika Nilles, Craig Blundell, Kaz Rodriguez, and more. Once you have a free Roland Cloud account, download the kits that appeal to you and dig in.\n\nCreate Your Very Own Signature Drum Kit\n\nThe TD-17 is filled with tools to build signature drum sounds like today’s pro drummers. Create big, rich snares and kicks by layering different sounds together, each with their own attack characteristics, ambience, and more. Then go further with onboard pitch control, EQ, and an endless range of creative effects.\n\nBluetooth Audio Streaming\n\nPush your drumming further by playing along with your favorite bands—including your own. Wirelessly stream songs and backing tracks through the TD-17 module from your smartphone via Bluetooth audio. And working with video lessons has never been easier. Just place your smartphone on the module’s panel and monitor the video and kit audio through headphones or monitors.\n\nGet to Know Your Gig Venue Before You Arrive\n\nBefore the gig, the TD-17 helps you become familiar with the acoustics of the performance venue. With the realistic ambience effect and newly added reverb, you can simulate any space to get used to the sound—all from the comfort of your home.\n\nImport Samples and Sound Just Like the Record\n\nFor some performances, you simply have to use a specific sound. With the TD-17 module, you can import and trigger original single-shot drum hits or introduce audio loops, sequences, and more. Better still, imported samples can be mixed and layered with internal TD-17 sounds to build any kit you can imagine.\n\nThe Essential Tools to Improve Your Drumming\n\nFirst things first: drummers should be able to keep a solid beat before moving on to the exciting stuff. But mastering the basics can be exciting too, as it builds a solid foundation for growing as a musician. The TD-17 module includes a Coach mode to sharpen your skills with daily practice tools, complete with progress tracking that motivates you to improve. Play through warm-ups, develop your sense of groove, tempo, and timing, and even work on your stamina.\n\nRecord. Listen. Learn.\n\nListening back to your drumming is one of the best ways to improve. The TD-17 module has an onboard recorder that lets you hear and evaluate what you actually played—not what you thought you played. Record solo sessions or drum along with the TD-17 demo songs, audio stored on an SD card, or music streamed from your phone. Along with self-evaluation, it’s an easy way to capture high-quality audio for YouTube performance videos.\n\nEasily Track Drums in Your DAW\n\nRecording acoustic drums can be quite difficult—often needing lots of equipment and expertise—but the TD-17 makes recording at home easy. Connect the module to your computer with a single USB cable and record a stereo audio drum track directly into your DAW. You can also record MIDI through the same USB cable or via the dedicated MIDI output.\n\nHave Fun Improving with Melodics"
