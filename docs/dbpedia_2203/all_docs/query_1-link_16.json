        "text": "As with mastering any technique, you need to practice ... a lot.\n\nThat said, I would also suggest you try changing the angle of the snare drum a little bit. Try a few different angles to see if you can find one that results in hitting the perfect rimshot more reliably. For instance, if you are consistently hitting only the rim, then it may help to position the drum so that the head is angled slightly more toward your body than you currently have it positioned.\n\nTo answer your additional question, about whether the stroke should be different: speaking from personal experience, I would say yes. When I execute a rimshot, I tend to use more elbow movement than normal, and less wrist movement (although, not necessarily keeping my wrist static). For one thing, this gives a lower overall pivot and it also increases the power of the stroke (I like to play my rimshots nice and loud).\n\nAs a jazz drummer I normally do the stick on stick cheat.\n\nWhen doing an actual rimshot, I usually change from traditional to matched. I find it much easier to get a solid rimshot because you can push downward with the force of your wrist. One main thing I would suggest: It is much better to hit the drum than the rim, so if you're going to over shoot, make sure its toward the drum and not the rim!\n\nIt also helps me to keep the snare drum generally low. After you practice it enough, you will be able to feel the angle on the way down, and you will feel yourself minutely correcting the angles and you will be able to hit 9/10 before you know it. I still miss sometimes; it happens! Just remember to hit more toward the drum if you're unsure or maybe do a cheat.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nAlso: it should feel slightly different than a regular stroke. I normally stick rimshots (don't rebound), so I also feel that extra force from controlling the rebound. This is speaking in drumset terms by the way, orchestral/drumline/drumset rimshots are excecuted differently based on needs. Orchestral rimshots should feel lighter and you should glide with the rebound, and hit with a bit less of the stick over the drum. In drumline, since you use bigger sticks and rimshots are usually intertwined with other figures, they shouldn't feel much different from a regular stroke. When I was in drumline, I would pull back a bit just to keep myself in line as to where regular strokes and rimshots fall. For drumset, you're looking for power most of the time, so you should do just that, hit harder and with more of the stick!\n\nLetting your arm drop a bit down and pulling it inward can line up your stroke such that the head of the stick strikes the drum head just before the shoulder strikes the rim. If these two impacts happen very close to each other you get a great rimshot with the overtones of the shell speaking through the head of the drum.\n\nPractice is, of course, absolutely necessary - but it does not have to be boring. Set up a drum or a rimmed pad and go nuts with rolls and rim shots. A good rimshot happens with the relaxation of the arm, not a forceful redirection - the stick, rim, and head will all play a part in the sound. This is why having fun with it is the best way to get it nailed down."
