        "text": "Keep Your Drums from Going Flat\n\nChronic rimshotter? Heavy hitter? If you're tired of your snare, toms, and kick drum de-tuning through heavy use and abuse, then Rimshot-Locs are for you. These steel tension rod locks are quick to install and built to last a lifetime. Just tune your drum to its desired tension, apply counterpressure with Rimshot-Locs, and that's it — your tuning stays rock solid, and you're free to hit as hard you like. This is especially critical in a recording environment, where a de-tuned snare can not only mean the difference between a seamless drum comp and an obvious one, but can render your EQ and processing work ineffective.\n\nNote: Smaller drums with triple-flanged hoops and shorter, unthreaded shoulders will generally use RSL-Mini. Larger toms and bass drums with deep die-cast hoops or long tension rod shoulders will generally use RSL-1 for shoulders up to 1⁄2\" in length; RSL-2 works for shoulders up to 3⁄4\" in length.\n\nWhy Rimshot-Locs?\n\nThere are dozens of drum tension stabilizers on the market today. What Sweetwater likes about Rimshot-Locs are their rugged craftsmanship, clever engineering, and proven design. Stabler tuning means less time spent tuning up between songs, and none of the rattling, splatting, and head breakage you get from flattening. Even better, Rimshot-Locs release without special tools — just de-tune to release the locks, tune up to your desired pitch, and re-tighten Rimshot-Locs to enjoy the same rock-solid tuning stability.\n\nWhat Makes Our Sales Engineers Great?\n\nSweetwater Sales Engineers are a world-class team of experts dedicated to you.
