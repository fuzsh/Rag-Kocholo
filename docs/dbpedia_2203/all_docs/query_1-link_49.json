        "text": "Recently when writing drumline music in MuseScore, I noticed a couple things that I'd like to bring up for discussion to possibly be added.\n\nSpecifically, 6 tenor drums. I am used to writing for 6 (4 + 2 Spocks) instead of the default 5 (4 + 1 Spock). However, there is no sound I can use for another spock, but it would be nice to have another one for multiple uses. Example:\n\nAlso, tenor drum rim shots. While there are for snares, there are none for tenors. Every once and a while I find myself using these for drum features, but I never seem to use the mute feature.\n\nAnother thing I'd like is the use of a unison bass drum hit with only one note, preferably the middle line. Basically so you don't have to click every single drum into the staff, instead just click the middle line and have the big \"BOOM\" that all five would make (or the click from the rims). Another picture example:\n\nMuch like above, I'd also kinda like bass drum rim shots. Not many times are these used, but it is a nice feat."
