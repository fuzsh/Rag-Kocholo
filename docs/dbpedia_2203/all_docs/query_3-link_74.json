        "text": "If you are reading this article, then you are likely considering a drum set for either yourself, or your child. Great! I also gather you either don’t live on a rural property, or that you like your neighbours. Even if you hate your neighbours, you should probably love your hearing - and/or the hearing of your child - so this article can hopefully prepare you for what is an awesome instrument to learn - and provide some advice on how to protect your child’s ears as well.\n\nSo how loud is a drum set? The short answer is loud - drum kits typically range somewhere between 90 and 130 decibels, but averages 119dB. From experience, I also know that the bigger your child becomes, the closer to 130 db this will be. The longer answer is, it depends on where you are sitting. The loudest parts of a drum kit - the snare drum (90 - 125 db), and cymbals (100 - 115 db) - are also the highest pitched. This means their volume drops dramatically through walls, and/or with some well placed sound proofing.\n\nTo put that into perspective, if you are sitting at the drum kit a tom drum is about the same volume as a Boeing 737 a few minutes before landing, or a motorcycle idling 3 meters away. Whereas a cymbal is closer to a chainsaw, a thunderclap, or an oxygen torch.\n\nThis changes dramatically once you close the door to the music room. In fact, in our house the sound of a cymbal falls below 80dB in the next room. At that point, the bass drum has barely changed though, and remains closer to 90dB. From outside the house, you can still certainly hear everything, but cymbals, the snare, and toms are well below the neighborhood friendly 70dB mark. Great! this means we don’t need to worry about our neighbours suffering any long term hearing loss. The bass, however, is still a wall vibrating/picture frame dropping 90dB. As my kids say “Sorry Kerrie” (our neighbour closest to the firing line).\n\nWhy can you hear the bass drum from far away?\n\nThe Bass drum, while less noisy, about 105 decibels, tends to be the part of the kit that travels the furthest. This is why it tends to make neighbours the saddest - and the science behind this is quite interesting. I’ve done my best to summarise in a kid-friendly way below for those that are interested.\n\nSound is a pressure wave, or in its simplest description - the vibration of molecules. With drumming, this vibration starts when you hit the drumhead, or cymbal. This then pushes the air molecules around the cymbal or drum head at different wavelengths. It is these wavelengths that eventually hit your eardrum.\n\nSound waves are described by their Frequency, which is a measurement of how many waves there are per second. Higher frequencies (where there are more waves per second) produce higher pitched sounds, while lower frequencies (where there are less waves per second) produce lower pitched sounds.\n\nThe reason why my son’s bass drum can be heard from the top of the street, has to do with what “stops” these frequencies - or in the case of the bass drum, not stopping them.\n\nThere are two primary ways sound waves are stopped, attenuation, and reflection. Attenuation in simple terms is the loss of wave intensity (amplitude) through different mediums. Sound waves can travel through solids like metal, liquids like water, and gases like air. But they can’t travel through empty space which has nothing, not even air, in it. That’s why in outer space, there is no sound at all!\n\nDepending on the material, the absorption of sound waves changes, and different materials will absorb different frequencies better than others. The rule to remember though is that low frequencies are not absorbed as well as high frequencies, in ANY medium. This means low frequencies will travel farther because they do not lose as much energy when travelling through things like walls, rocks, or air. Incidentally this is also why radio waves can travel much further than say your 5G networks - and why 4G/5G towers need to be so much closer together. The higher the frequency, the more easily absorbed the wavelength is into things like buildings.\n\nReflection refers to how different sounds bounce off materials and objects. Sound waves can reflect off surfaces. We hear sound reflections as echoes. Hard smooth surfaces are really good at reflecting sounds – this is why empty rooms produce lots of echoes, and is also why we add funny shaped foam squares on the walls of studios - after all there is nothing worse than an echoey recording studio. Reflection, like attenuation is very frequency dependent. High frequencies are better reflected whereas low frequencies are able to pass through many objects.\n\nThis is why we can hear my son’s bass drum from the train station, but not hear the snare or cymbals until we get to the driveway.\n\nDrum Volume and Your Child’s Hearing\n\nWhen the human ear perceives any sound around 120 decibels, it can result in pain or significant discomfort. At this volume, you are almost guaranteeing some form of hearing loss, especially when exposed for long periods, or over multiple sessions. The most dangerous to young child’s hearing though is prolonged and unprotected exposure to higher pitched sounds - like the snare or cymbals described above.\n\nThe reason why this is especially critical in young children is that their ears, while not necessarily more sensitive to loud sounds, are more susceptible to ear damage primarily because their skulls are thinner and less developed than those of an adult.This development does not finish until late teens, to early 20’s.\n\nMost Occupational Health and Safety boards suggest an 85 dB threshold to avoid long term hearing issues, and young drummers are at an even higher risk if they do not take the correct precautions. I cannot emphasize this enough - Your child will start damaging their hearing within minutes or seconds of exposure to an acoustic drum kit, and a number of studies have shown that a significant number of professional drummers experience tinnitus (ringing in their ears).\n\nThis can easily be prevented with a number of noise reduction devices. For children though, I only recommend two options Noise Reduction Ear Muffs, and Drummer Headphones.\n\nFoam ear plugs are just not suitable for young children - as they are prone to falling out, and you cannot ever be sure that your child has put them in correctly. We learnt this lesson at the Formula One Grand Prix.. nothing but annoying.\n\nI would also caution against noise cancelling headphones. While we do use these ourselves, we have done a significant amount of testing and research to see what works well. Even within brands, you will have a great deal of variation between sound cancellation. We find the Bose QC35s, and the Sennheiser Momentum Over Ear headphones do the best job, but they are expensive. We do not use these for their digital noise cancelling (although the Sennheisers do a good job when jamming), but rather as passive headphones that just happen to block-out a lot of the higher-end frequencies. We also use these headphones in the audio purest sense, for listening to music.\n\nFor drumming though, I would not recommend you start with these. Instead I would pay the $100 to get a pair of Drummer Headphones, or a $20 pair of noise reduction ear muffs.\n\nNoise Reduction Ear Muffs\n\nPros :\n\nInexpensive (~$20)\n\nAvailable in child sizes\n\nCons:\n\nNot headphones (not electronic)\n\nSometimes bulky\n\nEasy and comfortable to wear\n\nPay attention to sizing\n\nDo not confuse these with noise cancelling headphones, or even just plain headphones. These noise reduction ear muffs are essentially the same type of headset worn by gardeners, machinery operators, and anyone who is frequently exposed to high volume environments.\n\nThese aren’t headphones in that they don’t have speakers or can’t be plugged in, but are singular in function: they provide safe and effective noise reduction at a relatively low price. They do a really good job of knocking down the higher end frequencies, that are typically associated with hearing loss. These noise cancelling ear muffs also come in various ratings, so be careful to balance protection with sound quality. In our experience you will need a class 4 rating ear muff.\n\nThis option is great if whoever will be wearing them doesn’t have to listen to music or a metronome through the headphones. They can also be great for kids who aren’t comfortable with putting foam ear plugs into their ears.\n\nDrummer Headphones or Earphones\n\nPros\n\nHearing protection and headphones in one!\n\nUnder $100\n\nEasy and comfortable to wear\n\nCons\n\nMore expensive than basic solutions\n\nMay be too large for kids\n\nThese solutions have always been my favorite recommendation BY FAR! Why? Well, for starters, they are purpose-made and encompass both great noise reduction and typically OK sounding headphones. These are by no means as good as my Sennheisers, but certainly do the job.\n\nDrummer Headphones allow young drummers to protect their ears while still being able to hear a metronome, or their favorite tunes through their headphones. We use this feature a great deal, in fact this is how we record our drum covers and typically jam out. (I will write a post on how we mix microphones and music soon).\n\nThe only real downside that we have found with Drummer Headphones, is that they are not designed for younger children, and thus do not have the same level of adjustment as say our Bose or Sennheisers. Now my son is 11, we can plan to re-invest in a pair of Vic Firth Drummer Headphones each - and move our good Bose and Sennheisers back upstairs for use as intended by the manufacturer.\n\nEducate Your Child about Hearing Safety\n\nEducation plays a huge role in protecting your child’s hearing. You need to stress the importance of always wearing their hearing protection - right from the very first lesson. This means more than just talking with them about the long-term effects of loud volume on the ears, but also modelling behaviour. Your drum teacher should also be strict on the use of ear protection, and also model best practice.\n\nThe act of putting ear protection on should just become a part of a pre-practice/pre-jamming ritual. We for one leave the headphones on the hi-hats. Why? Because good luck “forgetting” if they are the first thing you see."
