If you think about it, a regular head hit on a snare drum is an acceptable, we'll call it a \"medium\" volume, just for reference. And a rim click or rim hit is pretty quiet compared to the \"medium\" volume of a snare hit. So how come, especially on marching snares, a rimshot is so much louder?",

        "text": "Originally Posted by N2Bluz\n\nI'm gonna say its because you're making the head, rim & shell (all 3) vibrate at the same time....like a shock wave. There is also no (or very little) sustain. You're not allowing the head to set up any vibration waves due to the stick contacting the rim at the same time. Basically, you're creating a short but high pressure shock wave in the entire drum. Striking only the head displaces a large volume of air, but the pressure waves are allowed to bounce between the top & bottom heads and the heads absorb this energy and disperse it in the form of wave patterns within the head. Striking only the rim creates waves in the shell, which obviously can not displace much volume of air or sustain wave patterns because its rigid. Striking both simultaneously displace a high volume of air and also inhibit the resonant waves that would be absorbed by the head.\n\nThat's my hypothesis anyway..."
