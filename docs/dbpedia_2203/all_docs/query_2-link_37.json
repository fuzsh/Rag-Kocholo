        "text": "Most of the live cover bands I hear the rimshots are piercing. It's annoying. Sounds awful. And rimshots recorded (like if they're rimshots on recorded Mustang Sally) they sound like a fat wet ringing snare to me so if they're rim shots or not it didn't matter. You can overthink it. When all of that classic rock was being created and us \"kids\" were covering it in LA this never came up. We're living in a different age now I guess where everything is overanalyzed. Me I just listen and enjoy. And occasionally play and have fun behind my kit without worrying about things like this. I only notice it if some dude or dudette is playing piercingly loud rimshots on 2&4 every song. I either gotta move to a different place in the venue or leave.\n\nIt's kinda like the proper way to stick the hats on swing grooves and remembering to start opening hats up on the second stroke and not hitting the hats closed on the second stroke. And not playing with edge of the stick on the hats. But I often forget I get to groovin' and playing and everyone is having fun. Heck at some local venues with backline kits there are so many wood shavings around the hats from the other players it's like a sawmill back there lol.\n\nGreat thread here it made me do a lot of research and Googling. If nothing else I have a greater appreciation for rim shots and will probably practice them more.\n\nRim shots are just another tool in the box, learn what they can and can't do and pull them out when the situation calls for it. I'm not sure I understand the fairly passionate stand against them that I have read lately. They are a requirement in many styles and create a specific sound that is not reproduced with any other stroke. I can't agree with the \"they sound thin\" opinions, at least for me anyway. I can make a huge sound with rim shots and I don't play loud at all. Again, for me, they are less about taking a heart felt position and just another tool we have available as needed.\n\nRim shots are just another tool in the box, learn what they can and can't do and pull them out when the situation calls for it.

Again, for me, they are less about taking a heart felt position and just another tool we have available as needed.\n\nYeah, if you find a gig I can play too loud for it, haha. When I played kit with my college drumline, my not-thin-at-all backbeat was clearly audible over them and the guitars. No snare mic (though my secret weapon was a 15\" supralite with a cast marching hoop and a sexy 12mil starfire batter with an aquarian reinforcement dot).\n\nSHOTS!!!!!!\n\nI'm also not thinking rimshots on back beat in rock etc. on 2&4 are all that important. I honestly can't tell on recordings if it's a rim shot.\n\nI can usually tell. Rimshots are crucial for the sound of most contemporary rock, RnB, metal, country, fusion etc, etc.\n\nIn jazz the snare is less important than the ride cymbal. In jazz players explore a whole heap of different timbres in every single piece. In most other genres the timbre is set at the beginning of the song and stays constant throughout.\n\nYou don't have a drummer playing centre hits in a ballad and throw in random rimshots, likewise you don't get a drummer playing with Bryan Adams or Pink randomly switch between rimshots and centre hits.\n\nMost of the live cover bands I hear the rimshots are piercing. It's annoying. Sounds awful. And rimshots recorded (like if they're rimshots on recorded Mustang Sally) they sound like a fat wet ringing snare to me so if they're rim shots or not it didn't matter. You can overthink it. When all of that classic rock was being created and us \"kids\" were covering it in LA this never came up. We're living in a different age now I guess where everything is overanalyzed.\n\nNope, we're living in an age where people want to be more professional. So if the song (or genre) requires the sound of rimshot backbeats, anyone with a detailed professional attitude will play the rimshots. Likewise centre hits. If I'm playing a 70's soul or disco cover 9/10 I'm not playing rimshots, as that is not the sound on the record.\n\nYou seem to argue because YOU can't hear the difference, the difference is unimportant. It is!\n\nYou can't 'over think it' - you are either respecting the genre or the original performance (if it's a cover) or you are not.\n\nJohn Bonham, who is widely regarded as one of the best sounding drummers of all time, played 90% rimshots, with mostly only the ghost notes as centre hits.\n\nI used to have trouble playing rimhsots quietly and evenly without tensing up at the elbow/upper arm (biceps and triceps). One aspect was I learned about rimshots around the same time I learned to do the Moeller whip, so I always did a whip when bringing down the wrist/stick for the rs, which of course makes it louder than, as Mark demonstrates, when you just lower your wrist, but play more from the wrist.\n\nNext thing I wanted to learn (in jazz context) was the quiet rimshot Tony Williams used in the 60s, which meant even the stick tip shouldn't be high before the stroke. I'm now rather flexible, I love some loud, ringy backbeats, but I always make sure to wear hearing protection when playing rimshots, any volume.\n\nI'm actually very hesitant to use loud rimshots these days; I damaged my left ear playing backbeat rimshots on a high-pitched drum a few years ago, and I also got feedback from other (jazz) musicians with tinnitus that I should avoid rimshots on gigs they lead, whcih is fine with me. I think in Pop/Rock, the lower-pitched snare movement after the 90s with their typical high-pitched crack has made it a lot easier on everybody's ear. Same with darker/thinner cymbals.\n\nI still like other sounds as well, but it's a stretch for me; the below example, I used high-reduction earmuffs (kit seen in the pic btw, just a shallower snare).\n\nI tend to rimshot for about 90% of the gigs I do, but tonight I seemed to gravitate towards no rimshot back beats for almost all the gig. They sounded really full and seemed to balance well with the sound of the rest of the kit and the band in general. Sometimes rimshots can be quite sharp sounding.\n\nJust wondering if many here play mostly no-rimshots for 2 and 4 for backbeat pop/classic rock ?\n\nIt's all about dynamics. Rim shots should never be the default, but they can be quite effective when \"more is more.\" I've always taught my students to develop a strong backbeat without necessarily resorting to rim shots. But the ability to play consistent rim shots is a skill that should also be developed. I once had a student who was incapable of playing a back beat without rim shots and when I advised him to expand his technique by developing a full back beat otherwise, he looked at me like I was crazy. A couple of months later he lost his gig because his band mates tired of the incessant rim shots. Flexibility and style awareness are the hallmarks of good drumming.\n\nI tend to rimshot for about 90% of the gigs I do, but tonight I seemed to gravitate towards no rimshot back beats for almost all the gig.
