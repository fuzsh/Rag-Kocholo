        "text": "For many people, it is Stanbridge Drum Company Hardwood Hoops that instantly identify our snare drums by sight and sound. Widely regarded as the finest wood hoops available, our Hardwood Hoops are constructed using fingerjointed blocks of exotic and domestic wood for maximum durability. They produce a fat, organic cross-stick and rimshot sound, while also contributing a tonality to the open voice of the drum. Because of the great amount of time and effort involved in handcrafting these hoops, I only produce them as components of our own complete instruments at this time. Please check out the slideshow for more information on our great sounding and beautiful hoops."
