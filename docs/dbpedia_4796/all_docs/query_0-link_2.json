        "text": "Redemptive Movie Reviews\n\nWhy do the great stories we find in movies seem to stir us and resonate with us so deeply? Because they are all sourced from the one great story. The larger story. Our story.\n\nThe giants of culture have been borrowing our story for years in the films they direct and produce. By identifying the redemptive stories embedded in all those great films, we feel like we are taking it back, one review at a time.\n\nIf These Walls Could Sing\n\nI love musical documentaries and this one about Abbey Road Studios almost 90-year history definitely caught my attention. I loved the vision of the property being completely superseded by what actually happened there. While the Beatles' work there is best known, the nine-decade history had recordings done by great artists of every era. While not as captivating as the one on the Muscle Shoals recording studio, it was a worthwhile musical journey of really great music.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 88%/NR%\n\n(NR)\n\nThe Painter and the Thief\n\nIn maybe the most improbable redemptive story of all time, this celebrated documentary completely caught me off guard. What happens when two valuable paintings of an artist are stolen in plain sight at a gallery in Oslo? In this one, the artist ends up meeting one of the career criminals involved in the crime. They go on an incredible journey together that brings healing and hope to both their lives. Not always a comfortable watch, but it is an incredible and riveting true story.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/85%\n\n(NR)\n\nThe Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse\n\nThe best word I can use to describe this 38-minute animated short based the best selling book is “magical”. The austerity, simplicity, pacing, and thoughtfulness of the animation and storytelling was incredible. My tribe usually doesn’t like to use this word, but it was an incredibly “zen” experience. Watched it alone, with family, and even in some leadership environments. Every time it opens up incredible conversations.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 78%/73%\n\n(TVG)\n\nRatatouille\n\nA family favorite at the Schroller house. A rat is an unlikely hero in the food-themed period animated film. An inspired story where gifting and desire can overcome any obstacle on the route to success. The kind of stories we all need to be watching more. One of the few movies that is enjoyable for all ages in the household without boring or irritating anyone. Love this one. Hard for a family film to be this well-reviewed by critics.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/87%\n\n(G)\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox\n\nThe only film my kids were able to watch from my favorite director, Wes Anderson. This adaptation of the famous Roald Dahl book by the same name is such a fun movie. The stop-action animation is a little jaunty until you get used to it, but you’ll end up falling in love with the hero and his eclectic tribe of animal cohorts. Love conquers all and the good guys win over the bad. Another family favorite.\n\nIMDB 7.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/85%\n\n(PG)\n\nThe Social Dilemma\n\nHopefully, you have already seen this film. I believe it is a must-watch for anyone in this season of the human story, especially those with kids. The impact and directional fortitude behind social media is far worse than you realized and the folks who actually created all of it are gathered here to tell you so. This was like a train wreck that I couldn’t look away from. A hard, but necessary watch.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/83%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nA Star is Born\n\nThis remake of several previous editions is my favorite. And while Bradley Cooper pulled off his singing better than Lady Gaga did her acting, they both did surprisingly well. Great new original music in this bittersweet love story that ends in an unexpected way. I didn’t expect to like it and originally watched it for my wife, but I really enjoyed the story. There is a rags-to-riches story, weighed down by a bit of tragedy, but a great story well told.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 90%/80%\n\n(R)\n\nMy Octopus Teacher\n\nMy initial interest had to do with the fact that it was filmed in the frigid waters off the coast of the Western Cape of South Africa, but this film drew me in immediately. A career photographer on the verge of burnout and breakdown takes to the seas on the coast near his home and finds a very unlikely teacher and a lot of healing. Very unorthodox and unexpected, but a very redeeming story.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/91%\n\n(TV-G)\n\nBillie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry\n\nI was not really a fan of her or her music, but I have definitely turned the corner on her as a person and an artist. At the heart of this story is a shockingly normal family. A very talented and musical one that raised their kids in a very unconventional way, but might surprise you at how familiar some of this seems. You essentially have a story of parents who deeply love their freakishly talented children, Billie and her brother Finneas. Raising any teenager is hard, but when their life is so public and their inner thoughts so accessible, far harder still.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/95%\n\n(R)\n\nJiro Dreams of Sushi\n\nWhat does the pursuit of excellence look like? It might come in the form of 85-year-old Jiro Ono who runs what many believe to be the best sushi restaurant in the world. His almost tyranny of excellence is awe-inspiring and also a bit tragic when you realize his 60-year-old son has been apprenticing him for 40 years but has not been trusted to take over the reins for his elderly father. But there is some surprise redemption in this story. Excellence does come at a cost, but worth the price of admission. Classic documentary.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 99%/91%\n\n(PG)\n\nOcean’s Eleven\n\nWatered down in my subconscious by all the less-quality sequels, a rewatch of this movie immediately brought me back to how fun this ensemble story was. Humor, suspense, great dialogue, and not-good guys sticking it to the really not-good guys. Super fun storytelling, well-paced, and incredibly well cast. I had a great time seeing this one again and I bet you will as well.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 83%/80%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent\n\nThere wasn’t anything about another Nicolas Cage vehicle that would have interested me, but I kept hearing good things about this movie. The premise of a has-been actor (which hits really close to home for Nic) cashing in on his celebrity in a story that turns into an international crime caper was a surprisingly fun ride. I ended up enjoying this way more than I expected and actually really like Nic in the film. No deep hidden messages here, but a lot of fun.\n\nIMDB 7.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 87%/87%\n\n(R)\n\nTicket to Paradise\n\nMy wife was super excited about this one and I likely wouldn’t have seen it otherwise. I kept thinking, “This could have been so good.”, but it just wasn’t. Contrived, unimaginative, formulaic, and just a little too mean-spirited. But it did have a very redemptive ending despite all the efforts of some very broken parents. I reserved my opinion thinking that I was just expecting too much from a traditional ROMCOM, but turns out my wife was pretty disappointed also. But at 88% Rotten Tomatoes, apparently, we were in the minority. You may love this one. We didn’t.\n\nIMDB 6.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 57%/88%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nWelcome to Wrexham\n\nNever saw this coming. What felt like a superficial land grab for attention actually turned into a delightful journey. When movie stars Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney announced they were buying a lower-level English Soccer club, it wouldn’t have surprised anyone if it just turned out to be a publicity stunt. But this show is about a people, a place, and a 150-year history of a small town in Wales's undying devotion to the sport. It is also the journey of two new owners learning to love all of it as well. A delightful journey that I was completely gobsmacked by.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 90%/97%\n\n(TV-MA)\n\nCauseway\n\nA kind and thoughtful look into the PTSD journey of a returning soldier. This is a condition that I was aware of and didn’t really understand the practical complexities of, but this gave me so much more insight. This one really takes its’ time and tells the story more through reaction and experience than the spoken word. This a beautiful portrayal by Jennifer Lawrence who is quietly becoming one of the best of her generation. Two sad and lonely people help each other heal.\n\nIMDB 6.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/77%\n\n(R)\n\nThe Greatest Beer Run Ever\n\nThe trailer drew me in, but I was second-guessing the decision to watch pretty early into this one. But it just continued to sneak up on me and surprise me. Chickie Donohue almost felt like a caricature of a human being, but his earnestness and innocence propel the story. It is that same nature that makes this true story even possible. What seems like the worst idea ever actually wins over everyone he encounters and helps him fulfill a journey that should have been dead on arrival, both literally and figuratively. There is definitely some commentary on the Vietnam War that some of you may not appreciate. You’ve been warned!\n\nIMDB 6.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 42%/91%\n\n(R)\n\nMagnus\n\nA delightful documentary about Magnus Carlson who became a chess grandmaster at the ripe age of 13 and a world champion before his 23rd birthday. It is a crown he hasn’t relinquished since he first won it in 2013. He displaced a prior champion of 7 years that had a vocabulary-like knowledge of every chess game ever played and many felt was unbeatable. Instead of some of the awkward and eccentric champions prior, Magnus is close to his family, has great camaraderie with a normal group of friends, and even became a fashion model. #redemptivemovies\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 81%/75%\n\n(NR)\n\nDeep in the Heart: A Texas Wildlife Story\n\nConfession, if my future son-in-law’s brother wasn’t the editor of this film, I would have never probably seen it, but I am glad I did. As beautifully filmed as all those incredible National Geographic documentaries about Africa and other exotic places - but this one is all about Texas. Through its stunning cinematography and Matthew McConaughey’s narration, a redemptive hope for restoring the wilds of Texas emerges.\n\nIMDB 8.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes NA/100%\n\n(NR)\n\nThe Batman\n\nA Batman for the present age? It seemed right vs. wrong wasn’t always clear, the world felt gritty and compromised, and our protagonist didn’t seem like he even wanted the job of superhero. Okay, spoiler alert (but no big surprise), the good guys win, but it doesn’t feel nearly as satisfying as it usually does when superheroes end up on top. I was hoping the redemptive perspective might be that they don’t make another one like this, but the reviews tell me I may have to skip the next one!\n\nIMDB 7.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/87%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nAmerican Underdog\n\nThis one has such a tried and true Disney formulaic-ness about it that it almost didn’t seem real. But the story was true and sort of serves as a “rest of the story” for those who grew up in the era when Kurt Warner was a successful professional quarterback. A football version of “The Rookie” where the impossible becomes the stuff of a fairy tale. I am surprised the critics were as kind because this one had the feel of a less quality made Christian film, but it was good, redemptive, and appropriate for the family.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 75%/98%\n\n(PG)\n\nCyrano\n\nA beautiful retelling of a classic story, but this one has a protagonist that doesn’t possess an exaggerated nose but is vertically challenged. A musical romance based on a classic literary work has many ways it could have gone wrong, but I really enjoyed this movie. Maybe not being a classically good-looking guy who is decent with words, but still gets the girl, felt a little more familiar to me than most. Not sure that the average moviegoer will enjoy this one, but I did. It got better reviews than I expected!\n\nIMDB 6.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/86%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nNo Time to Die\n\nThis last installment of the Daniel Craig version of James Bond didn’t disappoint. At this point in this well-established franchise, you pretty much know what you are getting into when you sit down for a viewing. While there is a large dose of what you’ve come to expect, there is also a humanity in the story and its surprising conclusion. Those elements restored the franchise. A good Bond film and a large bucket of popcorn are what a good movie escape is all about.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 84%/88%\n\nPG-13\n\nRiding Giants\n\nWhile this surf documentary is about the history of big wave surfing, its’ most controversial spokesman experiences incredible redemption and transformation in the film’s most poignant moment. The stuff of transformation includes risk, overcoming your fear, redeeming all your life experiences, and leaning into the strength of a good community. Love this film and in particular, Laird Hamilton’s story.\n\nIMDB\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/94%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nElvis\n\nI wasn’t a fan of this guy going into the film and the movie didn’t really change my mind. While it did focus on his roots and earlier years, it wasn’t the origin story I was hoping for. His desire to rescue his family was noble, but the manipulation of those around him, his financial misappropriations, and how he anesthetized his pain were pretty tragic. Even though pretty whitewashed, there is much redemptive perspective here. Unless you're really a fan, I’d probably skip this one.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 77%/94%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nTop Gun: Maverick\n\nI’ve never seen a movie so ridiculously hyped that lived up to the expectations. Tied itself to the original story, but didn’t feel contrived. Was clearly rooted in the other film, but improved on the classic in every category. What a great movie theater experience is supposed to be. Great fun, music, performances, and even thrills. Definitely try to catch this one before it leaves the theater. Relationships, lives, and stories all get redeemed in the end.\n\nIMDB 8.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/99%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nCha Cha Real Smooth\n\nSomething about this one kept me from clicking on it until a close friend suggested that I would really love it, and I did. Though there was some heartache, it was so well portrayed that it felt realistic and even familiar. The music was great, the performances fantastic, and the filmmakers seemed to focus on the noblest and redemptive portion of every character. Life and love are hard, but everyone and everything can get better. Really enjoyed this movie.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86%/58%\n\n(R)\n\nDream Horse\n\nOkay, so this plays a little bit like an international version of a Lifetime flick. It could also have come straight out of Disney, but it is not quite shiny enough and lighthearted for them. Based on a true story, this won’t wow, but will definitely warm your heart. Good Sunday afternoon bad weather day watch. Takes its’ time but is full of home, the power of relationship, and redemption. A feel-good movie that also gets good reviews from the critics is a feat unto itself.\n\nIMDB 6.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 89%/97%\n\n(PG)\n\nThe Unforgivable\n\nThis story has a very redemptive turn, but it comes at the end of a very long and difficult journey. It might be hard for some of you to make the trip. But I think it is a tour de force performance for Sandra Bullock. It has an incredible plot twist that lies at the end of a hard, but beautiful picture of the depths of truly sacrificial love. Everyone has a story and there is always more than meets the eye.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 38%/74%\n\n(R)\n\nLost City\n\nNo surprises; you could literally write the script as it unfolds, but still a very nice antidote to these headier days. Doesn’t take itself too seriously and has strong influences from Jewel of the Nile, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the Miss Congeniality films. You definitely need to turn off your inner film critic, but it is worth the ride if you are willing to do so. Good classic summer popcorn film. Probably wouldn’t watch it again, but enjoyed the single watching.\n\nIMDB 6.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 79%/83%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nFree Guy\n\nAlmost as fast-moving as the immersive video game environment that the story is set within. Lots of laughs, unexpected turns, and Ryan Reynolds playing, well, Ryan Reynolds. If you are getting a little tire of that character (I am), it might be a bit of a hard watch. But I looked past that irritation and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Laughed out loud a few times and smiled a lot. Follows a fairly formulaic narrative, but is redemptive nonetheless. Some potty humor probably precludes it from younger viewers, but subtle and quick-moving enough that they may not get the jokes. #redemptivemovies IMDB 7.1 Rotten Tomatoes 80%/94% (PG-13)\n\nBeing the Ricardos\n\nI heard some of the Oscar buzz around this for Nicole Kidman as Lucille Ball, but what got me to tune in is the screenplay credit for Aaron Sorkin. He is responsible for some truly great films and his quick sharp dialogue never disappoints. Art blurs the line with life and the desire to write a redemptive story through both. A bit of a prohibitive tale at times, but Nicole does an incredible job portraying this powerful woman who was a force to be reckoned with at a time when women didn’t have a lot of power or influence. #redemptivemovies\n\nIMDB 6.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 67%/75%\n\n(R)\n\nBelfast\n\nThis is the day in the life of an Irish family affected by the conflict unfolding around them and requiring their participation. Stay in the war-town land you love with everyone you know or leave for higher and safer ground? A heart-wrenching decision. Beautiful told and filmed. Where your story ends up is rooted in where it begins. Along the way are choices to be made that wildly affect the outcome. This one will force you to wrestle with decisions ahead of you. Deserves every ounce of the press it has received.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86%/92%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nthe Adam Project\n\nI am always a sucker for parent-child stories, but this is one of the freshest takes I have ever seen on that idea. Borrowing directly from Field of Dreams, Good Will Hunting, About Time, Back to the Future, Disney’s the Kid, and many other family favorites, it was as much fun to try to catch all the homages as it was to go along for the ride of this fun film. A little contrived, but very redemptive, the less than overwhelming response from critics was not a surprise. A few strong words and some comedic violence keep it from making it a great family film, but it hits that mark otherwise.\n\nIMDB 6.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 68%/75%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nRescue\n\nA breathtaking true story that will have you on the edge of your seat until the end…even if you already know the outcomes. While it does address the rescue attempt of the Wild Boars youth soccer team in Thailand, possibly the most inspiring aspect of the film is the story of its’ unlikely heroes. Four nerdy reclusive underwater cave diving hobbyists step in where the nation, rescue teams, and military forces numbering in thousands, fail. Incredible ride!\n\nIMDB 8.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/99%\n\n(PG)\n\nDon’t Look Up\n\nOkay, this one isn’t redemptive at all, directly anyway. This movie confirms what we already knew, in times of tragedy, the last place we can turn for hope is the educational industrial complex, the ineptitude of our political system, or even our traditional news outlets. Where does our hope come from? None of these! The only redemptive perspective is that it might cause us to look past the hopelessness of anything other than our God. Don’t watch this. Wished I hadn’t.\n\nIMDB 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 56%/78%\n\n(R)\n\nChernobyl\n\nOne of the highest-rated and powerfully filmed docu-series of all time. This disaster, 35 years in our rear window, has unfortunately taught us very little. This should be a tale that is redeeming itself on almost an annual basis as subsequent tragedies unfold in our modern world. The reaction of this horrible chapter in our global history was to try to cover it up, downplay its impact, close ranks around protecting the government and the ruling party, and then figure out who to blame. A chilling recreation of a story we should all do well to never forget.\n\nIMDB 9.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/98%\n\n(TV-MA)\n\nSound of Metal\n\nRuben’s entire life revolves around music. His girlfriend is the singer in his band and his entire identity and career revolves around his ability as a drummer. But Ruben has a serious problem, he is losing his hearing; completely and rapidly. This sometimes tough watch is one of the more beautiful stories I’ve seen in quite some time. (Maybe the fact that I am a former drummer who’s experienced some hearing loss maybe has something to do with it!) Ruben realizes that sometimes you have to lose the thing you love in order to find the life you really want.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/90%\n\n(R)\n\nFundamentals of Caring\n\nDefinitely not one for the kids. This gritty tale of desperation finds an unorthodox but redemptive conclusion. A lost caregiver signs up for a young man with cerebral palsy who hates his life and everyone who cares for him. This story definitely assaulted some of my sensibilities, but the transformative journey of the main characters made it worth the ride for me. Maybe not for everyone. You’ll know pretty quickly into this one if it is for you or not!\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 77%/83%\n\n(TV-MA)\n\nLove and Monsters\n\nFunny, adventurous, and hopelessly romantic, this movie somehow made it to release during all the chaos of movie offerings in 2020. This one is a little young and formulaic, but a nice ride nonetheless. Probably a better fit for the teenage crowd than adults or younger kids. Sometimes you have to risk your life and go on a dangerous adventure in order to realize how good you have things back home!\n\nIMDB 7.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/89%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nWe Were Soldiers\n\nWhile this movie played on a lot of the cliches of many military films, it differentiates itself in some very important ways. It works hard at showing the challenges and humanity of the soldiers on both sides of the war. It celebrates valor, heroism, and loyalty. It shows the sacrifice that soldiers have to make, and how difficult balancing their career and life can be. There are some traditional values on full display that were a great reminder.\n\nIMDB 7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 63%/84%\n\n(R)\n\nQueen’s Gambit\n\nThe life of this orphan chess genius is not always easy to watch. Like many of us, she finds different ways to medicate her pain. But also like all of us, if we are willing to accept the helping hands available, all have plenty of opportunities to transcend our pain. Masterful storytelling, cinematography, and the use of color, music, and setting to tell a great story. You will never find chess so interesting or be as captivated by the story of a flawed heroine as you will find this incredible series. Redemption all over that will leave you cheering with a lump in your throat by the end.\n\nIMDB 8.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/94%\n\n(TV-MA)\n\nLand\n\nAfter a painful and tragic loss of life, Edee relocates to a cabin in the beautiful but unforgiving Rockies. She is completely ill-prepared and is essentially going to this stark environment to be alone and die. This is the story of discovering the value of life through staring directly into the face of death. This one was at times beautiful and bleak, but ultimately a reminder of the gift that every day and every relationship can hold.\n\nIMDB 6.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 70%/84%\n\nPG-13\n\nKing Richard\n\nThe amazing true story of the “creation” of the Williams sisters. In Richard’s eyes, he wasn’t raising the Tiger Woods of tennis, he was raising two of them. In a prohibitive tale for all leaders, his fierce determination and stubbornness that allowed him to take his daughters on an unprecedented and miraculous journey was the same stuff that almost undermined all the success they had found. It exposes both racism and the established class system in the sport of tennis, but this was an inspiring tale and a story for our time.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 91%/98%\n\nPG-13\n\nFree Burma Rangers\n\nThis extraordinary documentary stirred me like no other film I have seen in years. It rests on a set of governing principles that are foundational to everything we do in coaching. We are all uniquely gifted with resources, relationships, and skills. The glory of God is most apparent when we are offering our lives in the service of others through that gifting. There is some portion of the world needing the transformative love of the Father and that is our only weapon against the world’s oppression. The decisions we make about offering our lives should inspire generations.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes NR%/92%\n\n(NR)\n\n100 Foot Wave\n\nWhat happens when a somewhat obscure big wave surfer discovers the largest wave in the world? He literally reinvents the sport in order to ride that wave. He tells everyone he knows about this magical wave that breaks right on top of the shore; 3 times as deep as the Grand Canyon just below the surface of the water. They all ignore him until one viral video awakens the world to the majesty of this wave just off the coast of Portugal. To watch this very broken man discover, freely share, and then be left behind by the thing he discovered is an incredible journey.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes NA/100%\n\n(TV-14)\n\nAmerican Folk\n\nWhile not reviewed as well as the very similar “Once”, I really enjoyed this one. It has the 9/11 terrorist attacks as a quiet but clear backdrop to the story. Like “Once”, the main characters are musicians, not actors. That makes the music great and the acting just serviceable, but the director allowed this one to really take its time. It focuses on the relationships and enduring quality of the people as they make their way across the U.S. for very important, but different destinies. These kinds of indie films don’t tie the story up with a bow like most major market films. This slow and easy film was a comfortable ride that left me thinking well beyond the credits.\n\nIMDB 6.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 77%/67%\n\n(PG)\n\nKnives Out\n\nOne of the best-reviewed movies of 2019 and it is easy to see why. A phenomenal cast, great screenplay, and loads of entertainment and suspense. It is full of twists, plot turns, and misdirections. It will keep you guessing until the end of the movie. A reminder that movies can be smart, entertaining, and not completely assault your sensibilities. We really enjoyed this one.\n\nIMDB 7.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/92%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nMan in the Field: The Life and Art of Jim Denevan\n\nThis one is very fresh off the farm and no one has really rated it, but I had been hearing about it for quite some time. I was riveted. What do you call a man who does gourmet pop-up meals for hundreds in all 50 states and 18 different countries and does sand drawings visible from satellite images that wash away in hours in the tide? Some people think he is an alien! He is certainly a genius that has overcome an incredible history of family mental illness. The imagery is staggering and the heart behind the “events” was staggering. Loved this film.\n\nIMDB NR\n\nRotten Tomatoes NA/NA\n\n(NR)\n\nThe Starling\n\nStill can’t figure out why the critics hated this movie so much, but we really enjoyed the film. Maybe it was the slower paced sweet sentimentality of the film as it dealt with some very challenging issues. Critics hate “nice”. Given the state of affairs swirling all around us, a kind and gentle treatment of challenging issues was a nice respite in a film. The reality is that we all deal with trauma in different ways, but that there is hope for all of us. I love Chris O’Dowd and I am learning to like Melissa McCarthy, the film’s two leads. Lots of redemption here.\n\nIMDB 6.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 20%/73%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Mitchells vs. the Machines\n\nCritics are loving this film and it is easy to see why. It sort of has everything, but unfortunately for me, sometimes feels like it has too much. My teenagers enjoyed this one a whole lot more than I did. It moved so quickly with so much heightened visual stimulation that it felt like a string of Tik Tok videos woven together. But all that adventure, color, and sound was also accompanied by some beautiful messages about the value of family and the love of a parent and child. In the end, the love of a family conquers all!\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/89%\n\n(PG)\n\nBILL NYE: SCIENCE GUY\n\nIt isn’t easy being a poster child for anything, including science. Love by most, really disliked by others, Bill has had a fascinating journey from television personality to political activist. Celebrated for making science cool but also strongly maligned for his lack of pedigree by that same community. A science father to many young people, but never married or a father due to a hereditary genetic abnormality that he was afraid to replicate. The documentary spent a lot of time focused on his feud with Ken Ham of the Creation Museum which was interesting and amusing.\n\nIMDB 6.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 100%/70%\n\n(NR)\n\nONE NIGHT IN MIAMI\n\nThis is the fictional story of Muhammed Ali, Malcolm X, Sam Cooke, and Jim Brown spending one evening together discussing their various roles and positions regarding the civil rights movement. Even the greatest leaders have to wrestle with their own motivations and humanity. Watching people with power weigh with the privilege and responsibility of their influence challenges everyone who witnesses. It is never as easy as it looks.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 98%/82\n\n(R)\n\nTime Well Spent\n\nThis was an obscure little documentary that I almost accidentally began to watch. A surfing documentary described as uplifting and inspiring was a pretty easy choice for me. Four young orphan surfers from opposite corners of the globe are invited on the kind of epic global surfing journey they have only seen in their favorite movies. The boys not only get the chance to surf in some exotic locales, but get to help people in familiar and far worse circumstances. They find life, love, relationships, and hope. Their lives will never be the same. Really enjoyed this one.\n\nIMDB 8.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes NA%/NA%\n\n(NR)\n\nBlue Miracle\n\nA little grittier than your typical Disney film, but feeling very familiar with other stories produced by them. I would call this one a solid double, maybe a triple if you are in the right mood. A washed-up fisherman and some desperate orphans find their stories inextricably intertwined in this based-on-a-true-story family find. Hard to find a good story that you can watch with kids. This one fits the bill and finds some nice redemption for all in the end.\n\nIMDB 6.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 70%/71%\n\n(PG)\n\nDazed and Confused\n\nNot exactly a redemptive movie, but a spot-on depiction of my high school and hometown. Maybe my older sister’s circa high school and hometown, but very familiar. The music is 70’s rock and roll and every main character had a version of them represented in my high school. The role that launched Matthew McConaughey’s career and where he uttered the iconic “Alright, alright, alright.” The story of one wild night at the conclusion of a school year.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 92%/90%\n\n(R)\n\nIt’s Kind of a Funny Story\n\nNot sure how I missed this one for ten years, but our family really enjoyed this movie. It contains redemptive turns all over the place. Several key characters go on transformational journeys during the 100 minutes of this really entertaining ride. Everyone has a much more challenging story than meets the eye and sometimes we need to understand how tough things are for others in order to realize how good things really are. A couple of scenes became immediate favorites. Left a huge smile on my face.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 58%/65%\n\nPG-13\n\nCoda\n\nCoda feels trapped by her circumstance. Born into a poor fishing family in Massachusetts, she rises at 3:00 AM to ply the family trade before she heads off to school where she mostly sleeps and doesn’t “do school well”. But she isn’t even trapped by the financial vagaries of her family, she is the only speaking member of her otherwise all deaf family. She is their life interpreter even as that responsibility is keeping her from living the life she most desires. Her gift for singing is at first a revelation to everyone and possibly a means of escape. Avoids every trope a movie like this could find. Delightful and surprising at every turn.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/95%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nthe Trial of the Chicago 7\n\nSome critics hated this film because they felt it glossed over some of the uglier and more controversial aspects of this difficult time in American history. While it clearly had an opinion, it also presented the story openly enough to show that this is not as black and white as people like to remember the story. There were heroes and villains on both sides and deciding who is right and who is wrong is not that easy. This celebrated movie is worth watching.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 90%/91%\n\n(R)\n\nHamilton\n\nAfter hearing about this genre-busting Broadway for years, it finally made it to film. I loved every minute of watching this with my wife and daughters. Great storytelling, incredible music, and an experience that pretty much defies explanation. Lin-Manuel Miranda is the genius behind this production and deserves all the acclaim he has received. One of the rare things that actually exceeds the hype of the great things you’ve heard. Loved this film and have enjoyed the music ever since.\n\nIMDB 8.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 98%/90%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nNomadland\n\nThis movie has and will continue to win many awards. A modern version of the great American stories like “Grapes of Wrath” or the songs of Arlo Guthrie. This haunting story is playing out for an increasing tribe of people in our country and is both thought-provoking and haunting. Francis McDormand offers a MasterClass in acting with vulnerability and understatement. You won’t stop thinking about this one for a long time. It doesn’t have a traditionally redemptive ending, but I was changed through the watching.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 94%/79%\n\n(R)\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nTold through the vehicle of a grandfather’s reading a story to a grandson, this one is great fun and a favorite of many. This may be the highest-rated romantic comedy of all time and is filled with heroes, villains, and the rescue of a princess. Great fun for most of the family, this one will leave a smile on your face and have your family quoting lines for years.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/94%\n\n(PG)\n\nWe are Marshall\n\nIt was only a matter of time before this tragic and inspiring story made it to film. A plane crash carrying virtually every member of the Marshall University football team and coaching staff is the most tragic event in the history of sports in the U.S. The story of how the students of the university rallied together and how a football team came together in the aftermath is truly inspiring. While it’s not the quality of filming and storytelling that puts this in the pantheon of great sports movies, it was a good film with a very redemptive outcome.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 48%/79%\n\n(PG)\n\nArgo\n\nA CIA agent (Ben Affleck) goes undercover as a Hollywood producer looking for a location for an upcoming film. His real mission is to try to rescue six Americans in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis involving Americans in 1979. Known as the “Canadian Caper”, this true story is an invigorating and edge-of-your-seat ride. We all have a decent understanding of the U.S. hostage crisis, but this subplot was completely unknown to me and made for a great watch.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/90%\n\n(R)\n\nHunt for the Wilderpeople\n\nThis New Zealand film fits in a very narrow vein of humor that will either make you love this film or not be able to get through very much of the footage. I happen to love the director Taika Waititi and this type of humor and really enjoyed this ride. A young orphan boy finds a very unlikely parent in Sam Neill and goes on a crazy adventure while being pursued by the hilarious Rachel House as a local authority. One of my son’s favorite movies. Incredibly highly rated for a comedy.\n\nIMDB 7.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/91%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nBrené Brown: the Call to Courage\n\nThe Ted Talk superstar, author, and much sought-after speaker finally made her way to Netflix. As a clinical social worker, she approaches topics like courage, vulnerability, and shame like the subject matter expert that she is. But her warmth, sense of humor, and great storytelling draw you in and require that you self-reflect on everything she is talking about. This is a call to a more courageous and impactful life. Something we all need a little more of!\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 80%/NA\n\n(NR)\n\nSky Ladder\n\nWhile this documentary is not rated, it would likely be given an “R” rating if it were assigned for some images later on in the film. That is a bit of a shame because this explosion artist’s ability to paint canvases in the sky with fireworks and create large-scale images with ignited gunpowder is amazing to witness. But it is his largest installation, the 500-meter lighted recreation of Jacob’s ladder connecting the earth to heaven, that is the centerpiece of the film. Really inspiring to watch.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 100%/83%\n\n(NR)\n\nIntouchables\n\nI had a close friend talk about their love of this movie for so long, that I had to finally give a viewing. Typically not a fan of foreign films with subtitles, this one was worth putting up with that inconvenience. As a foreign film, it is less abrupt and clumsy as its American remake “The Upside” with Kevin Hart, but it is a way better film. Funny, heartwarming, and inspirational. There are a couple of scenes in this movie that you’ll never forget and will likely become one of your favorites of all time.\n\nIMDB 8.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 75%/93%\n\n(R)\n\nMinari\n\nLike a great Terrance Malick film, this one is beautiful, evocative, and leaves plenty of room for interpretation. It also requires that you continue to process the film well after viewing. This one is a beautiful immigrant story that is full of all the hope and challenges that typically accompany them.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 98%/92%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nWhile You Were Sleeping\n\nOne of our favorite rom-coms of all time. It is quiet, sweet, and full of redemptive perspective. Lucy works at a toll booth for the Chicago “L” commuter train who harbors a secret crush for a man who passes by every day. Their lives magically intertwine and Lucy realizes what she always wanted but not with the person she dreamed. This is a fun and kind watch without any trauma or drama. A perfect antidote to our times.\n\nIMDB 6.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 80%/79%\n\n(PG)\n\nDan in Real Life\n\nOne of my closest friend’s favorite family movies has now become one of mine. It is the source of frequently quoted one-liners and even dance parties in his home and it is easy to see why. This one is a mature and tenderhearted comedy that avoids most of the tropes and cliches of romantic comedies. Dan is a struggling single parent with three kids and is an incredibly endearing protagonist. Probably not for your younger ones, but a great watch.\n\nIMDB 6.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 64%/69%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nAkeelah & the Bee\n\nEverybody loves an underdog story and this is certainly one of them. Akeelah finds none of the traditional champions you would expect a child to find in their home or close relations. She had gifting normally not associated with her South LA circumstances. But her fearlessness, drive, and the mentoring and encouragement of some special people help her rise above her circumstance to accomplish the remarkable. Great family movie.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/81%\n\n(PG)\n\nRudy\n\nRudy is undaunted by his size, his circumstance, and the incredulousness of everyone he knows. He is going to go to Notre Dame and run onto the field as part of the Fighting Irish Football team. He doesn’t have any money, academic qualification, or athletic ability. His dream couldn’t feel any more improbable. This true story is one of the most celebrated along all the great stories in sports. It is rated PG and viewable for most members of the family.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 78%/90%\n\n(PG)\n\nUnbroken\n\nThe okay movie from the unbelievable book. If you are a reader, don’t miss the experience of this incredible true story of Louis Zamperini. There is so much incredible narrative that this could have filled an entire season of a TV drama or at least a trilogy of feature films. If you read, please go grab a copy of this book. If not, you will get to experience a small snapshot of one of the greatest stories ever told. The book was an emotional rollercoaster that had me page-turning like no other book ever has. Not easy to watch, but worth the ride. Some very difficult imagery is not suitable for the kids in this one.\n\nIMDB 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 50%/70%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nPursuit of Happyness\n\nOne of the best movies I will probably never watch again. It is the incredible true story of a single father who claws his way from homelessness to huge financial success. The perilousness of this father’s journey to protect his child made it a very hard viewing for this father. Several scenes are burned deeply into my consciousness and stir emotion even as I think of them now. So glad I experienced and know this incredible story of overcoming and redemption. This is a precarious journey that you will never forget.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 67%/87%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nInvincible\n\nVincent Papale has never known darker times. It is 1978 and he has lost his job and his wife has just left him. He is a broken man that decides to risk all on a one-in-a-million shot at walking on to his favorite Philadelphia Eagles. A new coach has initiated a stunt to win over the local fans by letting one of their own put a uniform on with the rest of the pros. It is a harder, more adult PG film that you are probably used to in that rating of film, but a great story. It starts off very, very gritty and discouraging, but is worth the ride. Thoroughly enjoyed this film with a very convincing portrayal by Mark Wahlberg.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 72%/73%\n\n(PG)\n\nThe King’s Speech\n\nKing George must ascend the throne and offer his country a strong voice of authority in its’ most troubled hour. The problem is that he stutters horribly and has a confidence that is equally fractured. He meets an unconventional Australian actor that he believes is a medically trained speech therapist. His unorthodox methods not only restore the King’s voice but his confidence as well in just the nick of time. Lots of language peppers this rated R film, but the relationship between Lionel the therapist and King George is powerful. The King’s journey is truly inspiring. Love this film.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 94%/92%\n\n(R)\n\nNews of the World\n\nA minister ends up doing the horrifying things that many soldiers have to endure during the Civil War. He believes the hardship and treachery he is experiencing in his life is a punishment from God for all he did. The only thing standing between the rescue of a young orphan girl is the forgiveness he doesn’t feel he deserves. A beautifully redemptive story that takes a challenging 1870’s Texas journey to achieve.\n\nIMDB 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86%/89%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Midnight Sky\n\nOkay, so things are bleak in this dystopian story about people trying to escape earth to flee a global-wide pandemic. The critics aren’t wrong. But the way things are trending, it didn’t feel too far-fetched! I am not sure I would wholeheartedly recommend this one, but it was nice to see a new feature film given the dearth of releases of late. This one goes out with more of a whimper than a bang, but it was redemptive nonetheless.\n\nIMDB 5.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 52%/26%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nMagnus\n\nA delightful documentary about Magnus Carlson who became a chess grandmaster at the ripe age of 13 and a world champion before his 23rd birthday. It is a crown he hasn’t relinquished since he first won it in 2013. He displaced a prior champion of 7 years that had a vocabulary-like knowledge of every chess game ever played and many felt was unbeatable. Instead of some of the awkward and eccentric champions prior, Magnus is close to his family, has great camaraderie with a normal group of friends, and even became a fashion model.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 81%/75%\n\n(NR)\n\nMulan (2020)\n\nYet another live-action remake of a Disney classic. While it wasn’t reviewed well, we really enjoyed this retelling of the beloved animated film. Yifei Liu is fantastic in the title role as a girl who disguises her gender in order to save her family and their family honor. We loved the extended fight scenes and all the crouching-tiger-hidden-dragon-type special effects. We felt this packed the same emotional redemptive punch of the animated classic.\n\nIMDB 5.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 73%/49%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart\n\nA redemptive story littered with tragedy. Many of us remember them as a punchline lampooned on Saturday Night Live and one of the unfortunate targets of the “disco sucks” movement. What you might not know is that their success on the “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack was a highlight of only one of three very successful and distinct careers. Didn’t really know much or really care about the brothers Gibb before this one, but you can now consider me a fan.\n\nIMDB 8.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/95%\n\n(TV-MA)\n\nOn the Rocks\n\nA funny and entertaining film borne of one of the more dysfunctional father/daughter relationships ever. Bill Murray pulls off his typical magic and plays the difficult-to-pull-off endearing rogue role to perfection. Murray projects his rakish behavior on his son-in-law, but the story ends up being a fun ride where love conquers all. Based on the reviews, the critics loved this one a lot more than the public, but we really enjoyed it. Not too deep or much of a profound message, but a lot of fun.\n\nIMDB 6.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86%/50%\n\n(R)\n\nSaving Private Ryan\n\nI’ll never forget watching the powerful reenactment of the Normandy invasion near in this film. I can still hear the muffled cries of the elderly sitting around us who must have known and lost people in that bloody landing. A powerful story of heroism that grabs you from the first few moments and doesn’t let you go for the ensuing two hours. This is a difficult watch, but a must-see for any American in order to understand and feel the cost of freedom. One of Steven Spielberg’s finest. Probably the best film about WWII ever made.\n\nMDB 8.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/95%\n\n(R)\n\nThe Help\n\nSkeeter Stone has returned to her life In 1960’s Mississippi. She turns her world upside down when she decides to interview the black women who have served the elite of local society. Although initially guarded , she earns their trust, collects the stories, and helps form an empowering community among the women. The story shows some of the ugly underbellies of 60’s southern racism but has a hilarious (and a bit disgusting) redemptive turn that you will never forget. The movie is based on the best selling novel. A movie about a time long ago that is still powerful in this season.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 76%/89%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nJoy\n\nJoy has forgone her own life and dreams in order to play a sad and unhealthy role in the care of her very dysfunctional family. But Joy has an incredible entrepreneurial ability as an inventor and an even more incredible perseverance necessary for success. Her family life is not very pretty and her path to success is just as gritty, but this true story is inspiring and turns her eventual incredible success into a movement of empowerment for other women of similar circumstances. I was surprised by how much I loved it, but the reviews clearly indicate that everyone else did as well.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/94%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nGood Will Hunting\n\nWill Hunting is a genius and a janitor that roams the halls of MIT at night. His solving of “unsolvable” problems left on chalkboards by professors at this Ivy league school draw the attention of officials. His fighting draws a similar level of attention from the law. His court appointed counseling as a result of his fighting lead him into an intense encounter with a psychiatrist played by Robin Williams. More than counseling, what he really needs is the ability to forgive himself for the blame he carried for the abuse he experienced in his youth. This one is really rough, but inspiring and powerfully redemptive. This film written by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, led to Oscars and launched the career of them both. Obviously not for the kids.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/94%\n\n(R)\n\nBuena Vista Social Club\n\nThis award-winning film is a winner for anyone who loves great music and redemptive stories. World-class Cuban singers and musicians disappear into obscurity in Castro’s Cuba. They go from performing at the Copacabana in New York City to shining shoes and cutting hair. Ry Cooder, the American musician and record producer, decides to make a trip to Cuba, regather these forgotten musical treasures, record some music, and reintroduce them to the world. A beautifully redemptive story that takes these performers full circle and left a lump in my throat.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 91%/90%\n\n(G)\n\nThe Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley\n\nA fascinating prohibitive tale for our times. The incredible story of the making of America’s youngest female billionaires and the incredible fraud perpetrated through her company Theranos. Not your typical redemptive turn in a film, but the best part of this true story is the complete crumbling of an empire built on hubris, narcissism, and deceit. The ability of a leader to ignore all truth and logic in pursuit of personal success is pretty chilling. A great watch for any leader.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 78%/72%\n\n(TV-14)\n\nLong Time Coming: A 1955 Baseball Story\n\nLittle League was nationally segregated in 1955, but Florida was still dragging its’ feet a bit. An all-black team wins by default all the way to the state tournament without ever playing a game. An all-white team, minus one coach who refused to participate, played this historical game. Over 60 years later, the players on both sides decide to gather again. Discouragement turns to great hope and this turns into one of the most hopeful movies on race I have seen. The redemption journey several men take and the staggering impromptu scene of healing at the end, make this a necessary ride for the whole family.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 71%/67%\n\n(NR)\n\nBoys State\n\nAn annual gathering of 1,000 high school boys in Texas, designed to replicate the state government, felt like some sort of SNL parody at the outset of the film. Turns out it is a cultural phenomenon that occurs in many of the other states in the union as well. This documentary is fun, youthful, and full of the hopefulness found only in youth. But this whimsical piece of art imitates life in ways that sheds light on the ridiculousness of our nation’s political system. The serious interest in politics of so many youths is inspiring in one way, but the main winners being mocked and the losers celebrated feels all too familiar to the way things play out in our national press.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 94%/NA\n\n(PG-13)\n\nHoles\n\nThe best selling book by Louis Sachar has become a movie! Stanley Yelnats IV looks to be the next in the long line fulfilling the 100-year curse of his family. After being charged with a crime he didn’t commit, he gets sentenced to Camp Green Lake to be rehabilitated with a rogue’s gallery of other boys. But Stanley transcends his circumstance to break the family curse and bring restoration to his other favorite inmate at Camp Green Lake. Very family appropriate and a family favorite with our clan.\n\nIMDB 7.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 78%/76%\n\n(PG)\n\nVast of Night\n\nYou are either going to really love this one or barely remember it after you see it, but given the lack of new film available in this season, I found this one a very enjoyable ride. It has the small town eerie sensibility of a twilight zone episode or an old radio drama but uses some incredibly innovative camera work to develop a sense of movement and momentum. While decidedly low budget, its’ success on a shoestring harkens the arrival of a whole new breed of filmmakers and auteurs. It has a little language, but it is appropriate for anyone in your family who was okay with “Stranger Things”.\n\nIMDB 6.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 92%/63%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nAugust Rush\n\nA child believed by his mother to have died in childbirth spends his life in an orphanage never losing hope that he will be reunited with his parents. What he doesn’t know is that his parents, both musicians never spent more than one night together. The boy, Evan, has a natural musical gift and can hear music wherever he is. Convinced his parents are in New York City and that they will find him, he “follows the music” to the city in hopes of reconciling with them. It is a harrowing journey with a redemptive end.\n\nIMDB 7.5 Rotten\n\nTomatoes 36%/82%\n\n(PG)\n\nOctober Sky\n\nThe true story of a group of young boys in small coal who become fascinated by the space race with the Russians. When they break ranks with their intended future to enter a science fair and dream of a career outside of the coal mines, it inspires many but antagonizes some of the most important people in their lives. This feel-good story will take you and your entire family on a great ride. There is beautiful redemption along the way that will put a lump in your throat. A family favorite.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes\n\n91%/88% (PG)\n\nA River Runs Through It\n\n“Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it…I am haunted by waters.” Some of the more iconic phrases from a film from the writing of Norm Maclean. Like in most families, some children seem to model the life/values while others seem to push away from them. This journey for the Maclean brothers is bittersweet, but there is something simple, nostalgic, and beautiful about how their story is told. You want to know them, experience their lives, and certainly fish the waters of the Big Black Foot River (whether you like to fish or not).\n\nIMDB 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 80%/83%\n\n(PG)\n\nO Brother, Where Art Thou\n\nIf you are fans of the Coen Brothers (Fargo, Big Lebowski, Raising Arizona) you will likely love this one. Great music, an incredible cast, whimsical dark comedy, and George Clooney’s comic sensibility on full display. Although it is often applied in darker, more desperate narratives, the Coen brothers' brilliant storytelling has never been more fun. A classic road picture where a handful of characters overcome tremendous obstacles to find their own strange measure of redemption. Laugh out loud funny. (If you enjoy this unique sense of humor!)\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 77%/89%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nMully\n\nOne of the more hopeful and invigorating documentaries we have seen in a really long time. “Rags to riches” is a very familiar movie trope, but this one plays out very differently than most. A 7-year old Kenyan orphan somehow survives and claws his way to wild financial success. A chance encounter requires he reevaluate his life and walk away from the life and motivations that got him there. His deep journey into serving children who suffered a similar fate as his own nearly bankrupts him. What he ultimately realizes is that the entrepreneurial surviving spirit that produces the wealth he rejected is actually the answer to multiplying the missional impact of his life.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes NR/95%\n\n(TV-PG)\n\nThe Last Black Man in San Francisco\n\nOkay, this one is a little art-house-like, but it is beautifully acted, well-scripted, and plays like a love letter cinematically to San Francisco. It is beautiful, poignant, and unfolds like a modern fairy tale. It is the common quest for identity and a sense of home that goes places you don’t expect and delivers a powerful punch in an unexpected direction. Finding out who we really are is always a better ending than the things we delude ourselves into believing, but are not. Definitely not for the kids, but if you are really into good film making, you’ll probably love this one.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/84%\n\n(R)\n\nFading West\n\nWhat happens when five best friends united by their love of surfing start a rock band? In this documentary about the band “Switchfoot” you see an honest behind look at what it looks like to wrestle with fame and role of husband/father. Journey with five incredible people who want to change the world through their music as they travel to some of the most beautiful beaches in world on tour with their surfboards in hand. A sweet and touching sojourn with some great music and lots of beauty.\n\nIMDB 8.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes NA/86%\n\n(NR)\n\nSame Kind of Different as Me\n\nSometimes, there are valid reasons why the critics hate a movie when the public wildly disagrees. But more often than not, it is because the movie is overtly hopeful, redemptive, and paints Christianity in a positive light. That certainly was the case with this film. A rare find of a film that takes on more challenging issues like homelessness, racism, and cancer, while still being family friendly (at least for your older kids). This one will and should provoke some good conversation in the family. We somehow missed it when it was first released, but it made for great family watching.\n\nIMDB 6.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 33%/86%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nLittle Women\n\nMy wife and daughters caught this during the Christmas break, but I didn’t catch it until it was available for stream. The four sisters immediately elicited comparisons to my four daughters. A classic story, brought to screen many times, finds perhaps its best rendition. The brilliant filmmaker Greta Gerwig brings a balance to the story that celebrates the unique qualities of each character while still delivering the story well.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 95%/92%\n\n(PG)\n\nLive the Stream: The Story of Joe Humphreys\n\nI don’t think I quit smiling throughout this whole film. So unexpected and full of life. Not only is he the best fly fisherman in the world, he is an author, advocate, and evangelist for the sport and the environment. One of the most infectious lives you will ever witness in a documentary. He still makes an annual trek to Arkansas to try to catch an elusive world record 20 pounder at 90 years of age. Magical.\n\nIMDB 9.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes NA/NA\n\n(NR)\n\nSuper 8\n\nI don’t know how we missed this one when it was first brought to screen almost a decade ago, but it was a fun Saturday afternoon watch on a rainy day. It feels like a mash-up between The Goonies, Stranger Things, and ET. It has all the storytelling you expect from Stephen Spielberg and the explosive action of a J.J. Abrams film (since they were both involved). Despite the adolescent cast, it is a true PG-13 with lots of violence, language, and themes, but for your older teens, it is an enjoyable ride.\n\nIMDB 7.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 81%/75%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nSoul Surfer\n\nIt was impossible to avoid this true story of the 13-year old champion female surfer who lost her arm to a shark attack. Bethany Hamilton’s journey is one of the best your family will ever watch together. Partly because so many movies of this type are not family-friendly, but also because her faith is given a lot of the credit for her ability to make the journey. An incredibly redemptive story that continues to inspire as this woman uses the platform of her tragedy, her restoration, and her gifting to change lives.\n\nIMDB 7.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 45%/75%\n\n(PG)\n\nJust Mercy: A Story of Justice and Redemption\n\nBased on the book by the Christian author, Bryan Stevenson, the movie focuses on one of the many true stories captured in the book. It turns out that Equal Justice Initiative featured in the movie has played a part in overturning over 140 death row convictions. This isn’t getting guilty people off death row, but getting wrongly convicted people off death row and out of jail. This a necessary story of redemption that all Christians should watch with an unblinking eye.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 83%/99%\n\n(PG-13)\n\na walk to remember\n\nFor a Christian film, this one is full of great music and good performances. It shows how staying true to who you are can be a painful adolescent journey, but the only one that stands a chance to change lives. A pure and innocent heart can change the lives of even those that seem the most unredeemable. This is a must watch for adolescents and teenagers wading into the minefield of the culture. Sweet and heartbreaking, but full of redemption.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 27%/78%\n\n(PG)\n\nHoneyland\n\nThis is a rare look at the edge of the world that Westerners rarely see and likely don’t know exists. At first, it was hard to watch and wrap my mind around the level of poverty and the desperate nature of Hatidze’s survival. But this last female beekeeper in Europe, as she is referred to, carries an uncommon dignity in her struggle. This documentary, set in Macedonia, takes an unblinking look at her life of tragedy and heroic overcoming. I haven’t stopped thinking about this one. Beautiful and haunting.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 99%/87%\n\n(NR)\n\nAmerican Factory\n\nAn abandoned auto plant in Ohio is given a second chance by a Chinese glassmaker. It is challenging to watch the incredible clash of cultures happen in our increasingly global economy. The distribution of wealth is on full display as formerly middle-class American auto workers have to adjust to wages comparable to McDonald's workers offered by a Chinese billionaire. Set your politics aside and take a good hard look at how our world is changing.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/79%\n\n(TV-14)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\n\nBe warned. While it is one of Quentin Tarantino’s least violent movies, it is still a Quentin Tarantino movie. But the one real violent scene is a rewriting of history. And what if that rewritten version had some of history’s real baddies getting back what they perpetrated in real life? That is the movie's surprising turn. Beautifully acted, incredibly scripted, and full of great music. This one makes fun of Hollywood far more than it celebrates it and Brad Pitt turns in his finest acting performance. Definitely not for the kids or for the faint of heart.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/70%\n\n(R)\n\nLOVe and Mercy\n\nThe line between genius and crazy turns out to be pretty thin. And for one of the greatest songwriters of his generation, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, his genius comes from spending times on both sides. In this true story, you see how the abusive control of a father and desire for power of an abusive therapist almost destroys a man’s genius and his life. A beautiful story where love, friendship, and brotherhood ultimately prevail.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 90%/85%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Way Back\n\n(First of all, if you haven’t heard the version of “Heavenly Father” by Bon Iver and the Staves featured in the trailer, you should check it out here.) The real redemptive story doesn’t always come from winning the big game in a sports based film. Sometimes, the most redemptive part of a good story is someone winning their life back. This one, from the director/producer who brought us Warrior is similarly raw and satisfying. Not for the kids, mostly for language.\n\nIMDB 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/85%\n\n(R)\n\nA MARRIAGE STORY\n\nAs a child of divorce, I really hate divorce. The redemptive experience of this movie is that it might cause you to be less selfish, learn to overlook your differences, and not let this become your marriage story. When love starts to fail in this one, it seems like everyone from therapist to friends seems to just encourage the breakdown. Lawyering up seems to be the nail in the coffin. Beautifully acted but a prohibitive tale that many of us need to see.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 95%/85%\n\n(R)\n\nJOJO RABBIT\n\nPossibly one of my favorite films of all time. Young JoJo, who doesn’t really understand the horrors of the Nazi regime, is training to be a soldier at the age of 10. He is accompanied on his journey with a sanitized version of an idiotic Hitler as an imaginary friend. While JoJo personally experiences some of the horrors of the Nazis, he escapes with much of his innocence intact, a more tender heart, and a desire to love. The last scene is one of the sweetest endings to a film ever. Laugh out loud funny and worthy of several viewings.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 80%/95%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nPeanut Butter Falcon\n\nThe trailer quotes a movie reviewer that called it “The sweetest damn film of the decade.” I couldn’t have said it any better myself. In this parable of the “Wizard of Oz”, we find three characters looking for a heart, a brain, and their courage. Their journey not only redeems the characters lives, but actor Shia LaBeouf attributes the movie to saving his. One of the most heart-warming films I have seen in years. Don’t miss this one.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 96%/96%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Martian\n\nAstronaut Mark Watney is left for dead on Mars as the rest of his team narrowly escapes the planet. He has to learn to survive on 31 days worth of provisions with an estimated 4 years until he can be rescued. He says he is going to have to “science the $#(! out of it” in order to survive. A tale of the indomitable spirit of man and the willingness of others to risk their lives for the ones they love. Suspenseful and entertaining tale of redemption.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 91%/91%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Natural\n\nRoy Hobbs gets lost from baseball after “some mistakes you pay for the rest of your life”. He magically reappears as a middle-aged man to lead an improbable charge to the World Series with a losing team. Not only has he rediscovered his swing from his youth, but the love of his life as well. This one is magical and has plenty of redemption to go around for everyone. Doesn’t hurt, but you don’t have to be a baseball fan to love this one.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 82%/88%\n\n(PG)\n\nBraveheart\n\nWilliam Wallace was a man of peace that was drawn into war to protect the people of Scotland from the tyranny of England. The loss of everyone he loved set the table for him to form rebel force to take on the mighty English army. Along the way, he inspires all his people, gave his life, and left a legacy that inspired the world well beyond his death. There are incredible parallels to the life of Christ in his story.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 77%/85%\n\n(R)\n\n1917\n\nWar is hell and the first World War was no different. In the same way, you may be experienced war for the first time through the lens of Steven Spielberg’s epic recreation of the invasion on Normandy in Saving Private Ryan, you get at taste of WWI in this one. The main difference is that director Sam Mendez has the advantage of technology over 20 years newer. It gives you the feeling of being in a video game. It is a redemptive story that is longer on technological wizardry than heart, but worth the ride.\n\nIMDB 8.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 89%/92%\n\n(R)\n\nStar Wars: The Rise of Skywalker\n\nThis final episode in the vaunted series had everything you would pretty much expect. All the old gang appears in one way or another, there is a final battle, and the good guys prevail when all hope is lost. But there is something much larger going on here, something mythic and parable like. The First Order is our spiritual enemy, the final battle feels like Armageddon, and in the end, the garden gets restored. Sound familiar. It should. That’s our story.\n\nIMDB 6.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 57%/the 86%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nFord v Ferrari\n\nThe mostly true story of how one entrepreneurial cowboy, Carroll Shelby, and a racing purist, Ken Miles, took on the vaunted Ford Motor Company, Enzo Ferrari, and Le Mans…and won. A beautiful story of two men pressing through fear to find transformation in their industry and their own lives. One of the most fun movie experiences I have had in years. This is why we fell in love with movies. Take your family’s slow car this one or you might get in trouble on the way home.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 92%/98%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\n\nThis one really caught me by surprise. I though I knew what I was getting after I had seen the documentary, “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” last year. Rather than a movie about the life of Mr. Rogers, it is the true story about the affect of this incredible man’s life on an angry and cynical journalist, Tom Junod. This one will stay with you long after you see it, in the best of ways, and cause you to think about living a better life.\n\nIMDB 7.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 95%/91%\n\n(PG)\n\nThe Darkest Hour\n\nWith Hitler rampaging across Europe, the newly elected Prime Minister of England, Winston Churchill, must convince his countries leaders to not negotiate but stand in the face of tyranny. One of 2017's most redemptive films was also one of my favorites.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/83%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nMcfarland, usa\n\nThis is one of those great redemptive stories that you can also watch with the older kids. A coach getting a final chance, Kevin Costner, gives the local migrant working children their best chance at a better life by starting a cross-country team. While trying to change their lives his life gets changed in the process.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 80%/88%\n\n(PG)\n\nlion\n\nThe true story of a 5-year old Indian boy who gets separated from his family on the streets of Calcutta, gets rescued through adoption by an Australian family, and then as a young adult goes on an unlikely journey to find his way home. A beautiful story of restoration and the power of a family's love.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86%/91%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nthe company men\n\nIt isn't until Bobby Walker loses everything that he values (title, income, car, status) that he finally realizes what really matters. Once he finds out that what he values doesn't have anything to do with his job, he is able to go back to a similar role, but as a different and better man. He shows us that the necessary restoration of a person's life often comes on the other side of our most challenging seasons.\n\nIMDB 6.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 67%/55%\n\n(R)\n\nMaudie\n\nThe true story of a folk artist from Nova Scotia who takes a job as a housekeeper to survive. The awakened glory she finds in her painting not only changes her life, but gives her the confidence and currency to change the life of the man she works for and eventually marries. A beautiful story of restoration and the uncovering of a person's glory.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 89%/89%\n\n(R)\n\nwe bought a zoo\n\nFrom a desire to start over after the loss of his wife, adventure writer Benjamin Mee moves his two children to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo. A beautiful story of healing and restoration for Mee’s family, the zoo, and many others. Based on the true story of a zoological park in Devon, England. Appropriate for most of the family.\n\nIMDB 7.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 66%/71%\n\n(PG)\n\nAbout Time\n\nThe men in Tim’s family have an incredible secret; they can travel back to any point in their life. While time travel is a tried-and-true movie technique, this story takes a uniquely redemptive turn. At first Tim goes back to right the wrong of things in the past. But what Tim ultimately realizes is that he lives every day as if he were living it over again, there is no need to travel back in time at all. A great lesson for all of us.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 68%/81%\n\n(R)\n\nThe Secret Life of Walter Mitty\n\nWalter lives a very tedious professional and personal life and compensates by regularly daydreaming a more significant story. One small decision leads him on a life-changing adventure that leads him to life, love, and becoming a completely different man. One of the more uplifting and inspiring films in recent years.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 51%/70%\n\n(PG)\n\nThe Queen of Katwe\n\nPhiona sells corn on the streets of rural Uganda when she discovers the game of chess at 10 years of age. A natural aptitude and the love and dedication of a coach help her develop into a champion and escape the impoverished conditions of her life. Queen is the powerful true story of overcoming unbelievable obstacles to find a better life. This one is from Disney and for the whole family.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/87%\n\n(PG)\n\nThe Greatest Showman\n\nP. T. Barnum is a serial entrepreneur in all the best and worst of ways. He is a man of compromised character who wants worldly riches and personal acclaim. This whitewashed Disney-like depiction, however, is a family friendly joy-ride from start to finish. An overriding theme of finding purpose and value in someone despite their limitations is the prevailing theme. I dare you to watch it and try to get the songs out of your head.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 55%/88%\n\n(PG)\n\nisle of dogs\n\nFrom the incredible mind of Wes Anderson comes a stop action masterpiece that is as entertaining as it is visually stunning. Despite the fantastical tale that provides backdrop to the story, the tale really is about a boy, the love of his lost dog, and his heroic quest to locate him. If you are a West Anderson fan, you’ve likely already seen it. If you haven’t, take the chance.\n\nIMDB 8.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 91%/88%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nSalmon Fishing in the Yemen\n\nA sadly overlooked tale about a Scottish ichthyologist and lover of salmon fishing who encounters a visionary sheik with a similar love and desire to bring the sport to the most unlikely of places - the deserts of Yemen. Though the tale is around the mission of bringing this project to fruition, it is really a story about a person really stuck finding faith, love, and a life worth living. If you loved Walter Mitty, you’ll really enjoy this one. Great date night movie.\n\nIMDB 6.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 68%/64%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nWarrior\n\nOkay, it is a cage fighting movie. Expect some violence and language and other adult themes. But also one of the most inspiring films you will ever see. Against impossible odds, the restoration of a broken relationship between two brothers literally takes center stage. The improbable tale about cage fighting that had my wife in tears and me choking them back in the unforgettable final scene.\n\nIMDB 8.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 88%/93%\n\n(R)\n\nSeabiscuit\n\nWhat happens when an undersized horse, an oversized jockey, a broken-hearted owner, and a crackpot trainer get together? Movie magic. The incredible true story of how three people and a horse cooperated in the restoration of one another and the inspiration of everyone in Depression era America. “You know, you can’t throw a whole life away just because it is banged up a little bit.”\n\nIMDB 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 77%/76%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Astronaut Farmer\n\nBased on the true story of a man in Texas who planned to launch himself into orbit. This is well before some well-known billionaires decided to throw their hat in the same ring. Farmer still carries the childhood belief that he can be anything he wants to be. For him, that is an astronaut. Okay, so I can’t really recommend you watch the movie, it is pretty mediocre, but the trailer is fantastic. The adult realization of a childhood dream is beautifully redemptive, for all of us. “You are a fabulous father. You’ve got your family dreaming together.”\n\nIMDB 6.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 58%/49%\n\n(PG)\n\nMoneyball\n\nOakland A’s GM, Billy Beane has a problem. The budget he has to field a team is only a fraction of the teams he is competing against. But he makes a huge bet on Peter Brand’s mathematical approach by building a team with lower cost players to replace superstars in the aggregate. While thumbing his nose at 100 years of baseball tradition, his 2002 team wins 100 games, just misses the world series, and sets an American league record with 20 consecutive wins.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 94%/86%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nSaving Mr. Banks\n\nPamela Travers is terrified of Walt Disney making her beloved “Mary Poppins” into a whimsical cartoon like other Disney movies she’s seen. She completely resists every attempt by Walt to win her over until Walt realizes something very important: treating the story well means treating Pamela’s own life story well. Rewriting a redemptive perspective on “Mary Poppins” is actually a work of healing in Pamela’s life. An incredible true story.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 78%/84%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nMolly’s Game\n\nThis is the true story of how Molly Bloom’s career-ending crash in the U.S. Olympic trials triggered a series of events that led her to run the world’s most exclusive high-stakes poker game for a decade in Los Angeles and New York City. It definitely has some language and one pretty violent scene, but the redemptive climax of the movie involving Molly’s father is one of the best I’ve ever seen in a film. Extraordinary picture of how the father’s love can overwhelm anything.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 82%/84%\n\n(R)\n\nThe Hundred-foot Journey\n\nWe all eventually learn that the success that the world offers doesn’t hold a candle to the fulfillment we find in love, family, and home. Hassan Kadam has to travel from complete obscurity to the pinnacle of culinary success in order to learn this simple lesson. A delightful family film that will leave you soul satisfied and possible searching for some good Indian food.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 69%/81%\n\n(PG)\n\nGifted\n\nWhen Frank Adler promises to give his niece a normal upbringing, he has no idea what challenges he will face once her abilities as a mathematical prodigy are revealed. A beautiful film about how the love of a parental role model can conquer anything. The scene where Frank teaches her about what it was like when she was born is one of the most touching scenes I have seen in a film in a long time.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 73%/85%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nSafety Not Guaranteed\n\nOne of those small independent films that almost no one saw. A quirky caper with a truly odd-ball protagonist and a good ensemble cast of some really flawed people that all find a way to endear themselves by the end of the film. The film rests on this newspaper ad: “WANTED: Someone to back in time with me. This is not a joke. You’ll get paid after we get back. Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed. I have only done it once before.” Great surprise ending to this one.\n\nIMDB 7.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 90%/80%\n\n(R)\n\nMillion Dollar Arm\n\nA nice little Disney film based on the true story of a down-on-his-luck professional sports agent who thinks that the most popular sport in one of the most populous countries in the world might be the source of the next great baseball player. The transformation of our protagonist from selfish opportunist to loving father figure makes for great viewing for the family.\n\nMDB 7.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 64%/68%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nChef\n\nSometimes you have to lose a career to gain a life. Great father/son film where a man leaves the limelight at the top of his career to start over in the most humbling of positions. Fantastic ensemble cast where the love of great food and family take center stage. Definitely not for the kids, but a real fun ride with a great redemptive turn.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 87%/85%\n\n(R)\n\nDunkirk\n\nOne of the most famous stories of WWII comes for film in extraordinary fashion. One story told in three separate chronologies (one week, one day, one hour) that all weave together cohesively into one story in the end. From the austere landscapes, the pervasive sense of desperation, and eerily droning soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, this one never lets you get too comfortable in your seat. A beautiful picture of how an army of ordinary people stepped into the extraordinary.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 92%/81%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nColumbus\n\nIf you don’t need a lot of action, adventure, or even dialogue and you love modernist architecture, this might be the film for you. The buildings, bridges, and other structures take center stage as two young people befriend one another through their different relationships with both architecture and family. Sometimes there is hope to be found in even the most challenging circumstances.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 98%/80%\n\n(NR)\n\nCinderella Man\n\nJames Braddock is a boxer down on his luck like every other Depression era American. Despite being banned from boxing due to some injury-related performances in the ring, he gets a back-door opportunity to fight again. This time, he is not only fighting for the health and safety of his family, but for the hopes and dreams of every other man in America. When his wife, Mae, comes to see him before his biggest fight, it may be my favorite movie scene of all time. It always wrecks me. This true story is one of the more inspiring tales you will ever see.\n\nIMDB 8.0\n\nRotten Tomatoes 81%/90%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nDreamer: Inspired by a True Story\n\nThis family friendly movie features a young Dakota Fanning as Cale Crane, who believes a broken down disappointment of a horse, “Sonador”, deserves a second chance. While it appears she is rescuing and restoring a lost horse, she is really doing the same thing for someone far more important, her father. Maybe this father of four daughters is just a sucker for father/daughter films, but I think this one deserves a few viewings.\n\nIMDB 6.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 64%/78%\n\n(PG)\n\nBuck\n\nThe documentary about the man who inspired 1998’s Horse Whisperer with Robert Redford. Buck Brannaman redeemed years of his own child abuse into helping people with horse problems actually realize that they really have horses with people problems. This one will inspired you and leave you thinking about it long after watching.\n\nIMDB 7.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86%/86%\n\n(PG)\n\nThe Greatest Game Ever Played\n\n20 year old Francis Ouimet doesn’t know that golf is an elitist sport not intended for his kind. He just knows that he loves the game and seems to posses God-given gifting for the sport. This true story about the winner of the 1913 U.S. Open is a little slow moving, but is inspiring and appropriate for the whole family. Packed with much deeper themes of restoration that most would imagine, Francis ends up not only redeeming his own story, but that of his hero, pro golf champion, Harry Vardon who overcame similar obstacles, and most importantly, his own father.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 63%/82%\n\n(PG)\n\nWalk the Line\n\nJoaquin Phoenix’s portrayal of the tortured, but redeemed Johnny Cash was so good that it inspired a whole new generation of fans for the deceased singer. Like any great biopic, the original story of this incredible singer brings understanding and tremendous empathy to his very public challenging journey. Reese Witherspoon’s Academy Award winning depiction of June Carter Cash is inspiring. The tough love she showed Johnny was the key ingredient in his redemption as she heroically fought for his heart.\n\nIMDB 7.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 83%/90%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nMay it Last: A Portrait of the Avett Brothers\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with the Avett Brothers or their music, this documentary about their musical journey and their lives will make you an instant fan. As the celebrated producer Rick Rubin says in the movie, “It seemed that just being around them would make life matter.” The good heartedness of Seth and Scott Avett and the cultivated love and community of everyone in their lives is contagious. Getting to witness the weight of translated pain into beautiful music, is one of the more touching things I have seen in film.\n\nIMDB 8.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 89%/97%\n\n(NR)\n\nSearching for Bobby Fischer\n\nWhat are parents supposed to do when extraordinary gifting and ability is revealed in their child? That is precisely the dilemma of Josh Waitzkin’s parents. A well-meaning father wants to develop the child’s genius while a good-hearted mother wants to protect the innocence of her child’s good heart. Watch childlike goodness challenge the sensibilities of everyone and change them all for the better. Every parent should watch this one.\n\nIMDB 8.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 100%/86%\n\n(PG)\n\nWhiplash\n\nThe unrealized dreams of some can often motivate them to help others realize theirs. But when the pain of those lost dreams doesn’t find much healing or redemption, that desire to help others can look pretty brutal. One of the more difficult movies for me to watch had me celebrating and enjoying the redemption the story found all the more. It is riveting and powerful and worth the ride. The culminating scene toward the end is unbelievable. (Full disclosure, my own time spent pounding the skins may have jaundiced my view of this one!) This incredibly well reviewed film from 2014 won three Oscars and probably deserved more.\n\nIMDB 8.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 94%/94%\n\n(R)\n\nFever Pitch\n\nOkay, there aren’t a lot of RomComs (romantic comedies) that can really qualify as redemptive, but this one hits the mark. Not only is it a movie about relationships that won’t make you blush, it is a story about two half-hearted people both becoming more fully alive. Ben has an unhealthy obsession with the Boston Red Sox that keeps him from love and life. Lindsey has a similar fixation with her career that keeps her from the same. Their interest in one another causes both their established kingdoms to crumble for the sake of finding a more balanced better way to live where everything fits, but in proper proportion. Great date movie for the both of you.\n\nIMDB 6.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 65%/60%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nSpare Parts\n\nThe true story of how four poor hispanic high school students in Arizona form a robotics club with their substitute teacher who is a recently laid off engineer. With only 800 dollars, some used car parts, and other inexpensive spare parts, they take on returning champ MIT and many other prestigious university team’s with college students and budgets more than ten times the size of theirs. More importantly they overcome lower expectations from their neighborhood and families, inspire everyone, and change the course of all their futures.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 55%/82%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nMomentum Generation\n\nSaw this one at the Aspen Film Festival in very limited release. A women recovering from a recent divorce purchases a home on the North Shore of Oahu to start a new life for her and two teenage boys. Their home soon houses a surrogate family for a couple of dozen boys with broken stories and big dreams of becoming professional surfers. An older surfer becomes a surrogate dad and this little “family” launches some of surfing’s greatest (Rob Machado, Tom Dorian, Kelly Slater, etc.). When fame, success, and money start to break down the “family”system, the boys all go their separate ways. In a beautiful redemptive turn, the most successful among them, Kelly Slater, restores relationships with all the guys, creates a “family” text and starts an annual “family” reunion they attend.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 100%/100%\n\n(TV-14)\n\nHenry Poole is Here\n\nWhat would you do if you found out you only had a few weeks to live? Well, Henry decided to drop out, return to his childhood neighborhood and anesthetize the pain until the inevitable occurs. When a simulacra (religious imagery in natural phenomena) appears on the side of his house, people in the neighborhood start making a pilgrimage to his backyard. A slow and thoughtful, but beautiful story of redemption where someone expecting death actually discovers life, love, and maybe even a little faith.\n\nIMDB 6.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 39%/52%\n\n(PG)\n\nKings of Summer\n\nThis fantastic coming of age film is one of my favorite of the last few years. Three young boys seeking the natural independence that adolescence requires, embark on starting a new life and a new home. With salvaged materials from construction projects, they create a semi-permanent home and organize under their own rules and laws. Along the way, they encounter danger, love, broken hearts, and the breakdown in friendships. A near tragedy with a snake has them rejoining their former lives and restoring the broken relationships with their families and each other.\n\nIMDB 7.2\n\nRotten Tomatoes 75%/77%\n\n(R)\n\nThe Way, Way Back\n\nFourteen year old Duncan’s life sucks and having to spend the summer at the beach house of his mom’s new boyfriend. His desire to escape the house, the boyfriend, and some unsettling things going on there, leads him to the local waterpark. At a time when Duncan feels like he has lost his place in the world, the park offers work, community, and beautiful relationship with a father figure played by the fantastic academy award winning Sam Rockwell. Duncan’s new identity and confidence not only changes his life, but helps rescues several others in the process, including his mom.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 85%/84%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nField of Dreams\n\nRay Kinsella thinks the voice he is following is all about the restoration of Terence Mann, Shoeless Joe, and Dr. Moonlight Graham. He thinks he is supposed to mend their broken stories of an abbreviated association with baseball. But the journey Ray is taking is about something much deeper, the inexplicable restoration of his relationship with his father. It is that story, that reminds us of something deep and true for all of us; we were created for complete and perfect restoration with our Father. This one is a top five all time.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 86%/86%\n\n(PG)\n\nWon’t You Be My Neighbor\n\nWhat if it turned out that the stereotypically nicest and most passive seeming man, was action a warrior with the heart of a lion? And what if so fiercely lived out his faith through the loving of God’s children that nearly everyone who encountered him was changed by the experience? That is the “rest of the story” of Fred Rogers (Mr. Rogers) beautifully told through this award winning documentary celebrating his life. This one will make every the stoic among us feeling emotion and more alive through the watching. Check out the nosebleed levels on these ratings.\n\nIMDB 8.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 99%/96%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nIncredibles 2\n\nIt took 14 years to bring this sequel to market because director, Brad Bird, didn’t want to make the typical “money grab” parlaying the success of a film with a quick sequel, but waited until the right story emerged to follow up the first one…and it shows. This one packs a serious combination of doing the right thing, caring for others, and the love of family. Despite all their incredible gifts and powers this superhero family defeats the ultimate enemy by succeeding as a family through the love of one another. Great one for the whole family.\n\nIMDB 7.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/87%\n\n(PG)\n\nUp\n\nThe 2009 animated feature from the folks at Pixar may have the most beautiful and poignant picture of both the joy and heartbreak of marriage ever captured on film. And that is just in the first 10 minutes! The rest of the film is about fulfilling the dreams of a lost loved one. In the process of that huge adventure, a wounded heart is restored, a man finds a new reason to live, and a young boy finds the father figure that he desperately needs. Probably saw this one already, but watch with a redemptive lens and it will blow your socks off.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 98%/90%\n\n(PG)\n\nSilver Linings Playbook\n\nBreakout performances for Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence are just part of the incredible ensemble cast. This hilarious and poignant movie answers the question: What happens when two really broken people meet? Pat (Cooper) thinks that the path to happiness will come from restoring the life before his bipolar disorder and resulting violence had him institutionalized. The plan to restore his old life is beautifully disrupted when Tiffany (Lawrence) shows up and helps him write a different, but better story. Definitely not for the kids to watch, but a very redemptive movie with a happy ending.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 92%/86%\n\n(R)\n\nElf\n\nWhat makes a holiday film an enduring classic? The Hallmark channel is working overtime this time of year to figure out that formula, but it is very rare that a new Christmas movie becomes a classic. What if someone made a movie where the hero was the very epitome of light coming into the darkness of the world? What if he personified light and in him were no darkness at all? What if his very presence changed the lives of everyone around him? Maybe “Elf” became an instant classic becomes it so beautifully pointed back the one we are supposed to celebrating.\n\nIMDB 6.9\n\nRotten Tomatoes 83%/78%\n\n(PG)\n\nGran Torino\n\nWhat happens when an angry former auto worker who has just lost his wife has an asian family move into the house next door? Well first, a lot of anger and repressed racism, but then our protagonist (Clint Eastwood) experiences an aesthetic conversion of the heart. What ensues is one of the most heroic and messianic figures ever put on film. A beautiful picture of a man laying down his life for others. Very rough, but worth the ride.\n\nIMDB 8.1\n\nRotten Tomatoes 80%/90%\n\n(R)\n\nHidden Figures\n\nThere isn’t a more controversial topic in the country than race. And let’s face it, some of the history around this topic is pretty ugly. Some of the movies that have dealt with this topic have been appropriately horrifying. What I most appreciate about this movie is that it introduces in the issue in a way that still felt appropriate for my children. This is an inspiring movie where racism is overcome due to the necessity of the space race and the incredible mind of a female African-American.\n\nIMDB 7.8\n\nRotten Tomatoes 93%/93%\n\n(PG)\n\nBatman Begins\n\nI am not particularly a fan of the whole comic book genre of Marvel the DC universes. Based on box office, pretty much everyone else in the world disagrees. What I did love about this one was the incredible telling of the origin story. We all come from somewhere and are a product of that journey we have taken. This one shows that trauma can be redeemed and that the final crucial stage in being forgiven is forgiving yourself.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 84%/94%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nShawshank Redemption\n\nRed is an institutional man. His only reality is what is contained within the walls of Shawshank. Andy Dufresne begins planning his life beyond from his first day in the prison. While this movie contains many of the things a typical prison movie does (definitely not for the kids) it is actually one of the most profound cinematic expressions of freedom ever filmed. That is why it is the highest rated film of all time on IMDB. One of the greatest films of all time on almost everybody’s list.\n\nIMDB 9.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 91%/98%\n\n(R)\n\nFree Solo\n\nAlex Honnold may have just completed the most audacious athletic feat in the history of the world. His 9 year journey into climbing the 3,200 feet of El Capitan in Yosemite Valley with any ropes, harness, or anything else other than his hands, was so audacious that no one else had ever considered it before or since. A staggering achievement that will have you asking many questions as you hold your breath along with everyone else watching this staggering achievement.\n\nIMDB 8.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 98%/94% (8.2)\n\n(PG-13)\n\nGreen Book\n\nWhat do you do if you are a classically trained African American pianist in the 60’s? You decide to take a tour of the deep South…and bring along a mafia tough guy to be your bodyguard. Beautiful story of how two men overcome hatred, anger, and fear to find a deep and loving lifetime friendship. This one has some adult themes and is definitely not for the kids, but this is a challenging watch that will confirm why it was the most decorated film at the last Oscars.\n\nIMDB 8.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 78%/92%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nInstant Family\n\nPete and Ellie have pretty much a perfect apart from one thing. Ellie starts to realize she experiencing a void that can only be filled by children. Entering into the local foster to adopt program turns out to be the most heartbreaking and fulfilling experiences of their lives. While there is lot of the filming played for comic intent, you also get to see the heartbreak and restoration of adults, children, and pretty much anyone who serves witness to their story. While it may look like a typical Disney rom-com, it comes by its’ PG-13 honestly. Not for the kids.\n\nIMDB 7.4\n\nRotten Tomatoes 82%/81%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nThe Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\n\nBased on a true story, this is the tale of a poor farmer named Trywell who has an enduring faith and big dreams for his land and family in dusty Malawi. When his hope begins to fade with each subsequent setback, he finally bets all on his sons dreams and ingenious plan to restore the farmland by “making the rain”. While there are some mature themes dealt with, it is relatively family friendly for all but younger children. An inspiring true story of hope and redemption.\n\nIMDB 7.5\n\nRotten Tomatoes 84%/94%\n\n(TV-PG)\n\nThe Descendants\n\nMatt King has been made trustee of the estate that holds his family’s 25,000 acres of undeveloped land on Kauai. While the family’s extensive descendants want to sell the land before the trust ends in seven years, Matt is distracted by a much bigger problem. HIs wife’s coma related to an accident associated with an affair, has his immediate family and his relationship with his daughters in a shamble. The redemptive story he is finding its his daughters helps him redeem his role as trustee. Great film that very few have seen.\n\nIMDB 7.3\n\nRotten Tomatoes 89%/79%\n\n(R)\n\nThe Blind Side\n\nLeigh Anne Tuohy is both big-hearted and ferocious. She steps into the story of a homeless boy who is trying to survive a broken family situation with drug-addicted mom. This true story is about a life that would have been likely lost or discarded, but became a successful college and pro football career. Funny, heart-warming, and a very redemptive story. For most of the family.\n\nIMDB 7.7\n\nRotten Tomatoes 66%/85%\n\n(PG-13)\n\nSpider Man: Into the Spider-Verse\n\nTurns out there quite a few Spider Men of different varieties and from different dimensions. Most notably, young teen Miles Morales who is trying to figure out his superhero body at the same time that his friends at school are trying to figure out their human ones. I am neither a fan of comics or super-hero movies, but this genre altering film not only offers mind-bending animation, but a lot of redemption as well (plus a great soundtrack). The best reviewed movie of 2018.\n\nIMDB 8.6\n\nRotten Tomatoes 97%/94%\n\n(PG)\n\nApollo 13\n\nThis true story immortalized the words “Houston, we have a problem.” This is one of those classics you probably can’t even remember seeing, but should probably see again. Edge of seat suspense, great story telling, with the entire NASA space program and several lives hanging in the balance. Not for the younger kids, but a great historical film worth rewatching.
