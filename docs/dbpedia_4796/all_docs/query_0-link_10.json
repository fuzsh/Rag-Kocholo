        "text": "PREFACE\n\nKu Pa'a, Incorporated, of Honolulu, Hawaii, and The Peabody Museum of Salem, Massachusetts, have undertaken to publish the journals of Stephen Reynolds. The project is part of the objective of the two organizations to make available to the public documents in Hawaiian history. In this category the Reynolds journals represent one of the most comprehensive records, 1823 through 1855, of a resident of Hawaii.\n\nIn preparing this edition, the editor has received help from many persons. Most important has been the assistance of Donald Angus. He has provided photographic copies of items in his own collection. He has also made available the extensive research materials he has gathered from repositories in many places in the world for his own library. Because of his generosity, I have been able to include illustrative material that presents a new look at the port of Honolulu and its environs. Where he has not owned an item specifically, he has given me information that has led me to its discovery.\n\nThere have been previous efforts to work on the journals. Donald Angus was instrumental in securing the assistance of Alan S. Davis to collect a grant fund to have the journals rendered into typescript. The late Ernest $. Dodge, director of Peabody Museum, and the late David A. Ward, professor of journalism at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, worked on the editing of the document. Ward gathered a wealth of material identifying persons, places and events in the work. He donated his extensive notes to the Hawaiian Historical Society where they are available for reference at the societyâs library in Honolulu.\n\nJohn Dominis Holt has worked extensively on the preparation of the manuscript, Cy Timberlake of the Bishop Museum Library has been very helpful with the illustrations, and Gerald Ida has prepared the material for the index. Barbara Dunn of the Hawaiian Historical Society Library, Mary Jane Knight of the Hawaiian Mission Childrenâs Society Library, Susan Shaner of the Archives of Hawaii, and Peter Fetchko, director, and his staff at The Peabody Museum of Salem have all been of assistance. David Forbes has also given information from his knowledge of the journals and the history of the times.\n\nPauline N. King\n\nvii\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe importance of the journals of Stephen Reynolds cannot be overestimated. They are the primary source of our information of the merchant point of view of the period 1823 to 1855. Taken together with other merchant journals, with missionary accounts, with visiting naval officers and observers and with whatever Hawaiian sources are available, they give us a comprehensive picture of Honolulu from 1823 through the 1840s. The journals continue until 1855. But Reynolds was experiencing periodic bouts of illness and business reversals and his journals from that period become more interesting for their revelation of the trials of the individual than for general news.\n\nReynolds wrote about business dealings in sandalwood and whaling, the trips of transpacific and inter-island ships and the men and women involved in trade in Hawai'i and the Pacific. He also recorded social and political occurrences with short, penetrating comments. The immediacy of his daily jottings is particularly powerful when he notes an event one day and retracts it two or three days later. We know, then, not only what happened but what some persons in the community believed happened on occasion. His personal sufferings also became a part of the history of the time as he is part of that history.\n\nThe period of his writing is also of special importance. It is a time of dramatic change in Honolulu with a colorful cast of characters acting in exaggerated contrast. Chiefs, merchants and missionaries operate according to their own predilections, creating the tension which gives substance to action. And Reynolds was either a participant or an observer. Note the early entry when he writes on page two, âgreat stir among the chiefs about the king going to England.\" And his attendance at church meetings twice or three times of a Sunday.\n\nWithout these journals, we would have to rely more heavily on the works of the missionaries as the primary source of information of the period which is without official records (these begin in the 1840s). While missionary sources are important, any emphasis on one view alone gives a biased point to any question. For example, the school examinations of the people after instruction by the American Protestant missionaries were lauded in missionary accounts. It is Reynolds who points out that the 'students,â the people, had to travel great distances for several days to attend at the examination places. The exercise could be seen as more arduous on the people than it was worth. As proof, Reynolds claimed that Hawaiians complained to him about the situation.\n\nIt is his ability to recognize Hawaiian attitudes and customs that adds another value to his journals. Where others write of chiefs and the people, Reynolds usually gives a name to the chief and an identity to the people. For example, he notes the deaths of the chiefs Keeaumoku and Kaumuali'i. Then he describes their funerals and the behavior of their Hawaiian dependents. He describes a great community fishing expedition and a hula contest between two women. He tells too, the curious story of the rumor that the bodies of King Kamehameha II and Queen Kamamalu and the Chief Kahalai'a were to be taken from their graves at night and transported to the island of Hawai'i for burial there.\n\nReynolds was particularly close to the Caucasian-Hawaiian community. His wife was a member and he was especially fond of the Caucasian-Hawaiian students who attended the Oahu Charity School. His record offsets the critical, even slanderous, accounts of their lives given by missionaries.\n\nviii\n\nHeretofore, the journals have been available only to those scholars who have been able to read the material at The Peabody Museum of Salem or on microfilm at the library of the Hawaiian Mission Childrenâs Society. This exclusiveness has prevented many students of Hawaiian history and culture from utilizing the text which might significantly alter their own work. The present publication begins to rectify this situation.\n\nAcquisition\n\nThe journals were acquired by the Peabody Museum of Salem from the heirs of Reynolds just before a fire destroyed the home where they had been stored. The circumstances have been determined by records and verbal communications and are as follows: some of the Reynolds collection of journals, paintings and artifacts were placed on loan at Peabody in the summer of 1917 by Arthur Wilmarth. He was a grandson of Reynolds, being the son of Matilda Euela Reynolds Wilmarth. Matilda had died in the summer of 1916 in West Boxford and her home there was sold. |\n\nPart of the collection remained in the old Reynolds home in West Boxford, the same home to which Reynolds returned in 1856. His niece Matilda Lund lived in the home. On July 3, 1926, Stephen W. Phillips and Ernest S$. Dodge visited Matilda and persuaded her to give up the rest of the collection, including a feather cape. Reluctantly, she parted with the objects; the next day the Reynolds home was destroyed by fire. By 1932 the collection had been sold to Phillips by the Wilmarths and he donated it to Peabody Museum.\n\nTwo volumes, for the years 1826 through 1829 and 1838 through 1842, were not included in the original loan and gift. They were, however, donated to Peabody in 1964 by William P. Alexander, DeWitt Alexander and Mrs. Gordon Smith. The Reynolds Collection, then, includes nine journal books, a portrait of Stephen by John Mix Stanley and a collection of artifacts he took back to Massachusetts with him in 1856.\n\nStyle\n\nThe style adopted for the editing of the journals has been one which follows as closely as possible the original script. Spelling is kept as is except where the script is not clear, then the correct form is used.\n\nHis style is kept with the frequent use of dashes and dots, casual sentence structure and lack of capitals and other punctuation. The entries are, after all, daily jottings from the mind of an active participant in the life of Honolulu. What punctuation there is, including exclamation points, italics and capitals, is kept as found.\n\nSome few changes have been adopted. All letters above the line have been dropped to the line. This has been done without an apostrophe unless clarity demands punctuation. Thus Capt becomes Capt but Co# becomes Coâa. Marginalia have been placed in brackets within the paragraph with the words âIn marginâ preceding.\n\nBlank spaces are indicated by a long line in the text. An illegible word is indicated by brackets around the word âillegible.\"\n\nNames are kept as found even when Reynolds spells a name several different ways. This is especially true of Hawaiian names. Reynolds spells these pho-\n\nix\n\nnetically and sometimes with many variations and nicknames. Thus, Kuakini is John Adams; Kalanimoku is Krymoku, Billy Pitt, William Pitt; Ka'ahumanu is Kahumanah, Kahoomanoo; Ke'eaumoku is Governor Cox; Kaikio'ewa is Kaikiave and Kakeiaua; Kekuanao'a is Tuanoa; and the like. Reynolds wrote at a time when the Hawaiian alphabet was being formed and a standard orthography in the process of being established. Thus the way in which Reynolds spelt names and Hawaiian words is also part of the historical record. At the first reference to a Hawaiian name, the modern form is is placed in brackets. The index identifies the various spellings.\n\nBiography\n\nStephen Reynolds was born in Andover, Massachusetts, November 18, 1782, the eldest of twelve children of Enos and Sara Runnels. Soon after that date, Enos moved to West Boxford where he rebuilt his fatherâs home and where direct descendants lived until it burned down in 1926. Enos changed the spelling of the family name to âReynolds.\"\n\nStephen appears in the records in 1810 when he shipped as an able-bodied seaman on the brig New Hazard on a three-year trading trip to the Pacific northwest, the Hawaiian Islands and Canton, China. By 1817 he was on board the ship Ida, probably as an officer on a trip to the Pacific northwest and the western coast of the Americas.\n\nIn 1823, he came to Honolulu to reside. Perhaps his one-month visit on the New Hazard had helped attract him to the Islands. No doubt the breaking of the Rapu system by Kamehameha II in 1819 helped influence his decision. For after 1819, foreign residents in the kingdom were not obligated to live under the Hawaiian kapu system.\n\nRecords place his arrival in May and his occupation as a clerk for the Honolulu merchant William French. By 1829, he was prepared to open his own business as a dealer in sandalwood and as a general merchandise merchant in the Pacific trade, dealing in clothing, foodstuffs, wine and liquor, lumber, furs, horses and hides.\n\nAs he settled on land, Reynolds set up domestic arrangements with Winshipa Harbottle, a Caucasian-Hawaiian. He had two children by her, ason, William Pitt Reynolds, born February 13, 1827, and a daughter, Maria Harriet, born August 19, 1828. Maria died in November and Winshipa followed in May. In August Reynolds married Susan Jackson, the Hawatian-Caucasian daughter of Sally and Edward Jackson, in a ceremony performed by the Reverend Hiram Bingham. By Susan he had five children: Matilda Euela, born October 8, 1830; Evaline, born December 25, 1831; John Rice, born November 21, 1833; Harriette, born August 27, 1835; and Edward Jackson, born August 28, 1838.\n\nReynolds sent all of his children back to West Boxford to his sisters for their education. His objective seems to have been to give them the best opportunity he could afford. When he sent William Pitt off at the age of three, he wrote in his journal:\n\nPoor boy, you launch out into the world at an early period without any friends to aid, advise or protect you. And still more that you were born of a female of the Sandwich Islands, which will always be a mark against you. Such is the ingratitude of the World. I send you to America that you may learn enough to be a good and\n\nx\n\nuseful member of Society, and make a living in the world. In doing this I do my duty to you — do your duty to yourself.\n\nAs each child reached the age of three, Reynolds sent him or her to Massachusetts. The separations were wrenching ones for Susan. She was able to delay the separation from the youngest, Edward Jackson, for six years. Yet then Reynolds sent the boy off, apparently against the wishes of his mother and by subterfuge.\n\nStephen also felt their loss, for his journal entries record his feelings when he received news or miniature portraits of them. Perhaps his later involvement in the lives of the students of the Oahu Charity School fulfilled his parental longings. Whatever the attitude of the parents, the separation effectively detached their children from their birthplace. William Pitt apparently died before his father. Evaline died in West Boxford February 19, 1856. Matilda Euela married Henry Dane Wilmarth of Taunton and Boston and died in West Boxford in 1916. Harriet married Roger Sherman Littlefield of Randolph, Massachusetts, and died there in 1861. John Rice died in San Francisco, California, in April of 1855 and Edward Jackson died in Honolulu in 1868. However far away the two young men were from Massachusetts, their identification remained with that part of the world. For their names appear with their fatherâs on his granite headstone in the West Boxford cemetery.\n\nReynolds returned to West Boxford in the spring of 1856, after he had been in poor health for several years. By 1851 he was writing of his symptoms and his entries recorded many occasions when he felt very ill. In 1854 he went to California for some months for his health. He had become so erratic, however, in his behavior, that one of his creditors brought him to court and on August 15, 1855, he was found by a jury of twleve of the most important businessmen in Honolulu to be âa lunatic and of unsound mind with occasional lucid intervals, that he was incapable of the government of himself or the management of his lands, tenements, goods and chattels. . \"â His affairs, all property real and personal, were placed in the hands of a committee of two businessmen, Asher B. Bates and Benjamin Pittman, who were also old friends of Reynolds. At this time, his sister Rebecca traveled to Honolulu, took her brother and what was left of his possessions back to the family home where he died July 17, 1857, to buried in the West Boxford cemetery.\n\nRecently, David Ward speculated that Reynolds was suffering from lead poisoning which was being transmitted through the water he was drinking. His symptoms of weariness, listlessness, swollen face and the like seemed to indicate that this may have been the cause of his illness.\n\nReynolds was one of Honoluluâs most prominent businessmen. He prospered in his activities, improving his store from a grass edifice to a structure two stories high of coral on the mauka or upland side of Merchant Street near Nu'uanu Street. He bought the sugar plantation of Hali'imaile on Maui and property in Honolulu and Hilo. He had a branch store in Kahului, Maui. He was a self-taught medic and lawyer, at times the harbor master and pilot for Honolulu harbor, the consul for Bremen and vice consul for Hamburg. He was one of the first members of the first Masonic Lodge in Hawaii, Le Progres de lâOceanie. He was one of the early organizers of the Oahu Charity School established for the education of the children of foreign residents, especially the Hawaiian-Caucasian population. He remained on the board of trustees of the\n\nxi\n\nschool and was one of its most generous supporters.\n\nHe was also a unique character in dress and habits. He wore distinctive clothing described as Byronesque with a broad-brimmed Panama hat, full-collared white cotton shirt, nankeen trousers and a light box coat, white stockings and pumps, looking, it was said, âaltogether quite outre.\"â\n\nHe had built a spacious coral stone house for himself with a large room which he dedicated to dancing classes which he held weekly for the students from the school. He played the violin during these sessions and also taught the different dance steps. This interest occupied his time increasingly in the 1840s and after.\n\nIt was during this time that the painter of American Indians, John Mix Stanley, arrived in Honolulu. Reynolds befriended him and commissioned his own portrait and that of several of his favorite pupils. Some of the paintings adorned the walls of the ballroom in his home. Through his influence, Stanley received many commissions for portraits, including that of Kamehameha III and Queen Kalama.\n\nWealthy, prominent, popular, Reynolds had reached a distinguished place in Honolulu society by the 1840s. Besides friends in the business community, he at first was on reasonably good terms with the American Protestant Missionaries. He attended meeting on Sunday, often at both the Hawaiian and English services. He spent evening socials with them. But soon the differences of opinion on social, political and economic issues divided him from the American missionary set. Upon the arrival of Catholic missionaries, he and others encouraged their settlement and he began to attend their services. He was well acquainted with the Hawaiian chiefs, friendly with the Hawaiian people and closely associated with the Caucasian-Hawaiian group.\n\nBy 1851, he was beginning to complain of illness and had âfound cook had drawn water with a white lead keg; water tasted it very strongly. . . \"â With his increasing problems of health, he was unable to care for his business affairs adequately. In 1854 his Kahului store burned to the ground with a $7,000 loss and he was unable to recoup from that disaster. By the time the committee of trustees took on the responsibilities of guiding his business in 1855, he was in considerable debt.\n\nThus we find Bates and Pittman gradually liquidating his assets; the property in Hilo, including a lease on a wharf lot, the sugar plantation at Hali'imaile, the Honolulu lots. Susan was given an interest in the White Swan Hotel in lieu of a dower share in his estate.\n\nThere appears to have been some stress now in the family. Reynoldsâsister Rebecca had come out to Honolulu to be with him in his illness. In January of 1856 Susan applied to the court to be named guardian for her four living children. The next month Rebecca countered with a petition for her guardianship. The court awarded Rebecca the position in regard to the two minor children, Harriette and Edward Jackson.\n\nRebecca and Stephen left Honolulu in May with all his possessions which remained portable. After his death, his will was probated in Honolulu. Susan had married again to a man named Kahananui. She soon complained that she had been duped in her share of the estate and her settlement of her dower right. Perhaps she was right; the White Swan Hotel may have been the only solid asset of a lifetime of entrepreneurship.\n\nxii\n\nHonolulu in the 1820s\n\nBy the time Reynolds settled in Honolulu in 1823, it had become an urban cosmopolitan center for the Hawaiian Kingdom. By then it was the commercial hub for the ships in the transpacific trade, the political meeting place for the chiefs and chiefesses, and the central location from which religious and educational innovations emanated. The town was small, extending barely four blocks in from the waterfront and about four blocks paralleling it. Structures were primarily of thatch with wood and stone only gradually being adopted as these exotic materials became available. Facilities were primitive, streets dusty or muddy as the weather determined. The population numbered about 3,000 to 4,000 native Hawaiians with more than one hundred foreign residents.\n\nIf the town was modest in size and primitive in construction and material appointments, the interplay of human relations was not. Hawaiian chiefs and chiefesses, merchants and traders, missionaries; all looked at issues and events from their own perspective. While sometimes a consensus developed, more often each group followed its own self interest which only partly coincided with that of another. Thus the community was often the scene of conflict or confrontation of one group or another, with the great chiefs and chiefesses siding with one or the other or splitting their adherence between the two opposing groups. On each issue, at each event, the reaction in the town reflected ardently held opinions.\n\nAmong the groups who reacted most frequently in opposition to each other were the merchants and the missionaries. The enclave of resident traders had been established in Honolulu since the time of Kamehameha I. After 1819 and the breaking of the kapu system, the resident foreign community grew. Pursuing business, they desired to have a minimum of interference from the government of the chiefs and the least restriction on their personal behavior.\n\nAmericans were prominent among the merchants but there was also a considerable number of Englishmen as well as a number of Europeans. Reynolds, of course, belonged to the American group as did William French, for whom he worked. John Coffin Jones, Jr., was a prominent member of the American group. Agent of the Boston house of Marshall and Wildes, he was also agent for commerce and seamen of the United States.\n\nBesides the resident merchants, there was a constant arrival and departure of sea captains and their crews. Some of these men set up semi-permanent headquarters in Honolulu. Obviously their connections and interests coincided most often with the resident merchants.\n\nBy 1823, the American Protestant missionaries were firmly established in the islands. The Honolulu station was led by the powerful Reverend Hiram Bingham. Gradually their influence over the chiefs and chiefesses grew stronger. Late in 1825, many of the most important Hawaiian leaders became members of the Church. From then on, more and more suggestions of the missionaries were adopted by the chiefs and chiefesses and it was apparent that their influence was great.\n\nBetween the two groups, the Hawaiian chiefs and chiefesses reacted on the occasion. An extraordinary class of persons, they were all of high rank, held positions of responsibility, were large landowners, and were closely related to each other. They were in fact all of the great Pi'ilani genealogy of Maui. The chiefs Kalanimoku, Boki, Hoapili, Ke'eaumoku, and Kuakini held office as pre-\n\nxiii\n\nmier and governors. The chiefesses Ka'ahumanu, Pi'ia or Namahana, Kaheiheimalie and Kekauluohi were kuhina nui and regent, wives of great chiefs, large landowners and commanders of large numbers of dependents. These chiefs and chiefesses were, then, in control of the available labor force.\n\nIn the 1820s there appeared to be a disagreement among this group in regard to their attitude toward the merchants and missionaries. A group around Boki, governor of O'ahu, generally sided with the merchants and wished that foreigners would solve their problems among themselves. A group around Kalanimoku and Ka'ahumanu began to be more receptive to missionary influence and to be willing to establish general rules and laws to which all people in Hawaii were to adhere.\n\nAt this time the monarch was less important because Kamehameha II had gone to England and died, his brother and heir Kauikeaouli was very young and the chiefs and chiefesses were the dominant politicians.\n\nDiplomats also added to the complexity of Honoluluâs interest groups. John Coffin Jones was not a diplomat but often took on the role of one and iterpreted United States policy in regard to Hawaii as he saw it. In 1825, Richard Charlton arrived as Britainâs consul general. Of a choleric temperament, he usually expressed his ideas in aggressive language, sometimes in violent action. He was a bitter opponent of the American missionaries.\n\nArriving periodically were the warships of Pacific powers. The commanding naval officer played an important role in mediating the problems of the nationals of his country. He usually also advised the chiefs and chiefesses on the conduct of government and society in âcivilized countries.â In the 1820s, the visits of Lord Byron in HMS Blonde, of Lieutenant John Percival in the USS Dolphin and Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones in the USS Peacock were important events in the history of the town.\n\nFinally in the 1820s, the arrival of a second mission, the French Catholics, created another source of agreement and opposition in the community. Many merchants befriended the Catholics, notably John Coffin Jones and Stephen Reynolds. They were accused of doing so because of their antagonism to the American Protestant Mission. They may well have based their support on religious belief.\n\nWhat were some of the most important of the issues and events of the 1820s?\n\nOne which provoked the most intense feelings was that of the personal behavior of individuals. Keeping of the Sabbath, betting in any form, prostitution, seemingly vulgar acts; all ruffled the quiet of the community. The missionaries had influenced pious Hawaiians to keep the Sabbath strictly. Some missionaries and Hawaiians interpreted this to mean that activities should be restricted beginning as early as Saturday afternoon in preparation for Sunday. Thus, an incident occurred during Lord Byron's visit. He came to return the remains of Kamehameha II and Queen Kamamalu and the party of Hawaiians who accompanied the king to England.\n\nOn a Saturday night he planned an exhibition of phantasmagoria and his eveningâs entertainment conflicted with the Reverend Hiram Binghamâs plan for the celebration of the Sabbath. Bingham influenced many of the great chiefs with their people to avoid the theatrical performance and to attend prayer meeting instead. As object lesson at Sunday service, the preacher took the sermon from âGod is angry with the wicked every day,â and related the damnation\n\nxiv\n\nof all. Commented Reynolds, âNatives say they do not want to be told so, if it be so.â Journal, May 29, 1825)\n\nGambling was indulged in by Hawaiians and resident foreigners, usually for a modest sum. Billiards and ninepins, horse and boat races, card games; all gave the opportunity for a bet. To the missionaries gambling was a scandal to religion and they likened the practice to thievery. Both Hawaiians and resident foreigners found this label offensive.\n\nAs ameasure to stop prostitution, the Hawaiian government promulgated an edict which prevented women from going out to ships in the ports of the islands. Hoapili, the governor of Maui, enforced the law strictly at Lahaina. Ka'ahumanu as regent and kuhina nui was very supportive of the new law. Boki as governor of O'ahu was more amenable in regard to the port of Honolulu. The issue became a reality when ships arrived in the islands and found the formerly free ports closed to them as regards the company of women. Many of the sea Captains reacted violently. Two notorious incidents concerned Lieutenant John Percival who came in January of 1826 and Captain John Buckle of the Daniel, who was in Lahaina in October of 1825.\n\nLt. Percival objected strenuously at Honolulu to the imposition against women on board ships. In making his arguments to Ka'ahumanu, he blamed the American missionaries for the new rules. As a result, the seamen from his ship, with his knowledge, went ashore to attack Hawaiian chiefs and the Reverend Bingham. A riot ensued in which property was destroyed and casualties resulted. Governor Boki allowed women to go aboard the Dolphin. In missionary accounts, Percival is a villain painted only in black. To Reynolds, Percival was not an admirable man nor the reputation of the United States Navy advanced by the conduct of the men of the Dolpin. He depicted Percival as violently assaulting individuals, speaking in harsh and crude language, discussing sexual behavior in gross terms, overcharging sea captains for presumed services, and creating an atmosphere of tension and potential violence. Noted Reynolds, âterrible times.â (Journal, February 20, 1826)\n\nCaptain John Buckle, an Englishman in the whaleship Daniel, was also violently opposed to the interdiction on women when he sailed into Lahaina in 1825. He allowed his crew to threaten the life of the American missionary, the Reverend William Richards. Subsequently, there appeared in the New York Observer an article Richards wrote about the Lahaina incident and a statement by Richards that previously Buckle had brought a Hawaiian girl from a chiefess and had taken her on board his ship.\n\nWhen Buckle heard of the article he went to the British consul, Charlton, to sue Richards for libel. The basis for the claim of Charlton and Buckle was that English law stated that any English subject who transported slaves on the high seas was deemed a pirate. Thus, Richards and missionaries had charged Buckle with a serious crime equivalent to piracy.\n\nThe chiefs became involved when Charlton appealed to Boki. According to Samuel Kamakau, the chiefs split in their support of Richards, Boki and his supporters being willing to imprison Richards in the Fort while Ka'ahumanu and the other chiefs defended Richards. After a council of chiefs had met, Ka'ahumanu announced that Richards was not guilty of the charge. Reynolds indicates that he did not believe the charge against Buckle of buying a girl. (Jjournal, August 4, 1827)\n\nAnother important issue which agitated the community was the subject\n\nxv\n\nof law. The necessity for the promulgation of general laws for the community arose directly from the contact among foreign residents, transient visitors and Hawaiians. Often the issue in question related only to foreigners. Boki was amenable to settlement of foreign contests by foreigners. There had been notices published relating to the behavior of seamen on shore and the regulation of the port of Honolulu. But by 1825 the chiefs began to consider a more comprehensive set of laws. The intention had been discussed with Lord Byron in a council meeting with him. From then on the subject continued to confront the chiefs. What laws should be promulgated? After the religious conversion of many of the chiefs, a suggestion surfaced that the Ten Commandments be made the basis for law in Hawai'i. They were translated into Hawaiian, printed and circulated. Who initiated the move is in dispute, resident foreigners accusing the missionaries and missionaries protesting that they followed the request of the chiefs. By the end of 1827, the first code of laws — three, against murder, theft and adultery — was promulgated, less than the missionaries hoped for, more than the merchants wanted.\n\nIn October of 1826 Captain Thomas ap Catesby Jones arrived in the USS Peacock. He played an important role in settling the sandalwood debts owed to Americans by the chiefs. While he was in Honolulu, the chiefs agreed to settle the claims of Americans. In order to liquidate the debts, they imposed taxes on the people to be paid in goods, money or sandalwood. The problem was not easily solved and the debts continued to plague the relationships between the chiefs and the merchants for many years.\n\nMany lesser issues agitated the small community of Honolulu. One concerned a potential direct confrontation between merchant and missionary. Betwen October and December of 1826, the missionaries decided to deny that they advised the chiefs about government and commerce and they published a circular on the subject. In it residents and shipmasters were challenged to prove otherwise. A council was to be convened to hear witnesses on the subject. Such a meeting was held in December when testimony was to be given. But the missionaries would not take verbal complaints and the merchants and others were not willing to give written depositions. The meeting was dissolved without any complaints recorded. (Journal, October 27, November 1, December 8, 1826)\n\nThe arrival of the French Catholic missionaries of the Society of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary caused mutual recriminations to surface. It was said that foreign residents who befriended the Catholics were to be harrassed by the government. The merchants had invited them in, it was said, and hotly denied. Protestant and Catholic partisans remained at odds thoughout the century.\n\nBut for the merchant, and thus for Reynolds, the one reality was trade, the arrival and departure of ships, the condition of the port of Honolulu and the environment most conducive to a commercial enterprise.\n\nNov. 1-8] 3\n\n1823\n\nSaturday November 1st\n\nPleasant morning.
