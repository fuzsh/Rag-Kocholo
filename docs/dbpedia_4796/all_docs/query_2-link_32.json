        "text": "HONOLULU—Hawaii pays tribute this month to one of England's greatest maritime explorers. He was known to the natives as the god “Lono” and to his men and historians as Capt. James Cook.\n\nCaptain Cook discovered the Hawaiian Islands, which he named the Sandwich Islands, in 1778 while sailing from Tahiti to the mainland of northwest America. He died in 1779 at Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii, after angry natives attacked the British as their ships lay at anchor.\n\nFor many years, the only tribute paid to Captain Cook was an occasional wreath at his monument in Kealakekua. There were some, however, who felt the vanquished explorer deserved better treatment. As a result, there will be a five‐day festival on the island of Kauai, starting April 29.\n\nIt was on the island of Kauai, nicknamed the Garden Isle, that Captain Cook first went ashore in 1778. He landed at Waimea, on the south coast, and spent two weeks taking on water and provisions. A re‐enactment of his landing is part of the Kauai Discovery Festival.\n\nThe first day of the celebration will include a torchlight ceremony at awesome Fern Grotto. This is a mammoth cave on the banks of the Wailua River, and its roof and walls are hung with millions of fern plants.\n\nFerns grow well on Kauai, which receives more rainfall than any of the other major islands. Its Mount Waialeale is said to be the world's wettest spot, with an annual average of 40 feet of rainfall.\n\nBut visitors do not have to worry about that kind of rainfall at Fern Grotto. It is usually clear and sunny weather there.\n\nOn April 30, the Discovery Festival shifts to nearby Kalapaki Beach, which fronts on picturesque Nawiliwili Bay. A Royal Court will greet the “King and Queen” of Aloha Week as they arrive at Kala‐ paki aboard an outrigger canoe.\n\nThe original site of Captain Cook's landing, Waimea, steps into the spotlight on May 2, when natives in canoes will paddle out to greet a reproduction of the Englishman's ship, Discoverer. On shore, there will be ancient Hawaiian games and hula dancing by island maidens.\n\nFollowing closely after the Kauai celebration will be a second festival honoring Captain Cook. This will be on the island of Hawaii, one hour by air from Honolulu.\n\nThe residents of the fishing village‐resort of Kailua‐Kona will hold their own celebration, starting with commemorative services at Captain Cook's monument at Kealakekua Bay. The services will be held May 7, and will be followed by “grog” parties at Kailua‐Kona's resort hotels. Gov. John A. Burns will be on hand to welcome visitors and the local citizenry.\n\nA pageant Will be staged at Hale Halawai, the village Meeting Hall, on May 8, and there also will be exhibitions of native arts and crafts and tours of historical sites.\n\nCanoe races will be held in Kailua Bay on May 9, as well as a children's fishing derby and a treasure hunt ashore. A big luau and ball will be held that evening as the final activity of the Captain Cook celebration.\n\nThe Captain Cook Discovery Festival celebrations on the two islands are within easy reach of Honolulu by way of commercial or chartered airplane. Tour service by bus or limousine is available from the Outer Islands' airports. All arrangements can be made through travel agents in Honolulu.\n\nThe Kauai celebration comes during Lei Day, an annual event that has been celebrated throughout Hawaii for more than 30 years. This is the day when Hawaiians seek out their brightest blossoms, weaving them into garlands to wear with their even‐brighter aloha shirts or muumuus. An exhibit of the most outstanding leis will be held at the Waikiki Shell in Kapiolani Park.\n\nA hula festival and lei contest will be held at Hilo, on the north coast of the island of Hawaii, and most of the schools throughout the state will hold lei‐judging contests.\n\nIn June, Hawaii will honor the memory of the man who, in the words of a survivor of the Cook expedition, had the “most savage face” of any seen by the British. The face belonged to Kamehameha I, whose name means “Lonely One” in Hawaiian.\n\nKamehameha Day, June 11, is one for which the members of the proud Hawaiian societies prepare with loving care. Kamehameha was the founder of the Hawaiian kingdom.\n\nHis gilded statue, which faces Iolani Palace, former home of the monarchy, is traditionally decked with long plumeria leis on June 11. Also, Hawaiian societies stage a mile‐long parade in honor of their great leader.\n\nThe Hawaiians, many wearing brilliant capes and headdress, march or ride from the edge of Waikiki to the palace grounds, where their leaders pay tribute to Kamehameha in speeches. On the grounds of the nearby Kawaiahao Church, a “poi luncheon,” featuring the choicest of Hawaiian foods, is held for the marchers.\n\nThe Royal Hawaiian Hotel in Waikiki will be the scene that evening of the annual Holoku Ball, where Kamaaians (old timers) and Hawaiians dance as they once did in the days of the monarchy. Visitors also are welcomed at this big social event, and can compete for prizes offered for the best contemporary and period fashions.\n\nOne of the growing tourist attractions here is the recently opened Hawaiian Sea Life Park at Makapuu Point, about a 30minute drive from Waikiki. It has one of the largest exhibits of marine life in the world.\n\nIn May, it will have four different kinds of whales. The live whales—a pilot, false killer, pygmy killer and pygmy sperm whale—will be put through their paces in the big outdoor “Whaler's Cove.” The cove contains a reproduction of the whaling ship Essex, which was sunk by a whale in 1819.\n\nThe cove now contains several trained Hawaiian porpoises. On command, they leap out of the water and spin crazily on their tails. They also do a hula dance."
