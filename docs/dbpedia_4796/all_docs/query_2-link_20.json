        "text": "Port of Honolulu, .\n\nJohn Coffin Jones, Jr. (also known in Hawaiian documents as John Aluli) was appointed Agent for Commerce and Seamen on September 19, 1820. He began to serve in October of 1820, at the port of Honolulu. The post of commercial agent was raised to consul effective July 5, 1844, and held by Peter A. Brinsmade, who had already been appointed commercial agent on April 13, 1838.\n\nElevation of the U.S. Representative to the Kingdom of Hawaii to Minister, .\n\nThe first U.S. Minister Resident to the Kingdom of Hawaii was James McBride, who presented his credentials on June 19, 1863. The first U.S. Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Kingdom of Hawaii was John L. Stevens, who presented his credentials on September 8, 1890.\n\nCessation of Relations and Closure of the American Legation, .\n\nHawaiian independence ended with the formal U.S. annexation of Hawaii on August 12, 1898, following the Senate passage of a joint Congressional resolution on July 6, which was signed by U.S. President William McKinley the next day. Owing to U.S. annexation of Hawaii, the legation ceased to exist on August 12, 1898. Harold Sewall, the last Envoy Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, became Special Agent.\n\nTreaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation Between the United States and the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), .\n\nOn December 23, 1826, the U.S. signed articles of arrangement in the typical form of a treaty of friendship, commerce, and navigation with the Kingdom of Hawaii in Honolulu, which confirmed the peace and friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The agreement was signed by the captain of the U.S. sloop of war Peacock Thomas ap Catesby Jones, who was appointed by the U.S., and Guardians of Kauikeaouli, King of the Sandwich Islands: Elisabeta Kaahumanu, the Queen Regent; Karaimoku, the Prime Minister; Boki, Governor of Oahu and personal guardian of the King; Howapili, guardian of Nahienaena, sister of the King; and Lidia Namahana, who was a dowager queen of Kamehameha I. This was the first treaty that the Kingdom of Hawaii signed with any foreign power. It was never ratified by Congress, although both countries acted in accordance with its articles.\n\nTreaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation and Extradition, .\n\nOn December 20, 1849, the U.S. and the Kingdom of Hawaii signed a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation and Extradition. The treaty, negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John M. Clayton and the Hawaiian special Commissioner to the Government of the United States James Jackson Jarves, was signed in Washington, D.C.\n\nTreaty of Reciprocity, .\n\nOn January 30, 1875, United States Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and the Kingdom of Hawaiiâ€™s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States Elisha H. Allen signed a Treaty of Reciprocity. This treaty provided for duty-free import of Hawaiian agricultural products into the United States. Conversely, the Kingdom of Hawaii allowed U.S. agricultural products and manufactured goods to enter Hawaiian ports duty-free. This treaty was originally intended to last for a duration of seven years.\n\nWhaling Industry.\n\nBy the 1820s, the U.S. whaling industry established itself in the Hawaiian Islands, as there were greater numbers of whales to be found in the Pacific than the Atlantic Ocean. By the 1860s, however, the whaling industry on the whole was in decline, which meant that there were fewer American vessels scouting the oceans for whales and less need for American whaling vessel depots in Hawaii. The decline of the U.S. whaling industry in the Hawaiian Islands coincided with the discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania, and the start of the first age of oil. Also, by the latter half of the nineteenth century, whale bones were no longer used as widely in manufactured goods (such as corsets) thanks to the invention of steel during the Second Industrial Revolution (1870-1914).\n\nSugar Trade.\n\nThe climate and soil of the Hawaiian Islands were ideal for producing sugar cane; thus an entire industry was encouraged by American commercial trade in the Hawaiian Islands. This was especially so after the demise of the whaling industry in the 1860s; by the 1870s the sugar cane industry started to supplant it as one of the more profitable commercial trades between the U.S. and the Hawaiian Islands. Of note, from the late 1860s through the 1898 U.S. annexation of Hawaii, there was a significant inflow of Japanese workers into the Hawaiian Islands to work the sugar cane fields."
