        "text": "Honolulu, Oahu - Waikiki\n\nEmbrace a tropical state of mind on this uplifting encounter with the best Hawaii has to offer. Your first brush with traditional Hawaiian hospitality begins this evening when you join your Travel Director and fellow travellers for a local-style Welcome Reception.\n\nPearl Harbour & Honolulu\n\nToday we will visit Pearl Harbour National Monument and the USS Arizona Memorial as well as drive through the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Also today in downtown Honolulu we will see Iolani Palace, the King Kamehameha I Statue and State Capitol Building. The rest of the afternoon is free.\n\nOahu - Kona - Keauhou Bay\n\nThe next stop on our island hop through Hawaii is the Big Island. Following a flight, enjoy an orientation tour of the lively seaside village of Kailua-Kona, once the holiday playground of Hawaiian royalty. Breathe in the rich aromas of coffee during a visit to a local coffee plantation with a Local Specialist. Then, meet another Local Specialist at your oceanside resort, whose Manta Ray Learning Centre we will have an opportunity to explore before indulging in rich island flavours at Rays on the Bay.\n\nKona\n\nTake a moment and savour the calming sounds of the sea as you decide how best to indulge in a free day to explore Kona's beautiful landscapes. Relax in sun-kissed surrounds or ask your Travel Director for suggestions on how to tackle the great outdoors.\n\nKeahou Bay - Hawaii Volcanoes National Park - Hilo - Maui\n\nToday we arrive at Punalu'u Beach Park, famous for its black sand and Hawaiian green sea turtles which swim off the coast on the black sand to sun. Then journey to the UNESCO-listed Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and gain a deeper understanding of how the molten earth has shaped these volcanic islands. After, enjoy lunch at a historic plantation. Later, travel to Hilo where you board your flight to Maui.\n\nMaui\n\nPrepare for a full day of sightseeing on the Valley Isle, travelling along the tropical coast to the Maui Ocean Center. Meet the centre's conservation naturalists who will reveal secrets of the underwater wonderland that preserves and protects such species as Pacific corals, Hawaiian green sea turtles and sharks. We leave the coast behind and journey deep into the countryside to visit a local farm and 'Make a Difference' as you learn about the sustainable agriculture on the island. 'Connect with a Local' and toast to a traditional 'Be My Guest' lunch serving up Hawaiian specialties made with the freshest local ingredients. Spend the evening at leisure.\n\nMaui - Kauai\n\nA leisurely start to your day will see you eventually board a short flight to the natural wonderland of Kauai. Set your watch to island time and get settled in at your beachfront hotel.\n\nKauai and Waimea Canyon State Park\n\nDrive through the island's famous Tunnel of Trees and continue to Waimea Canyon State Park, one of the Hawaiian Islands most awe-inspiring sites. Dubbed the \"Grand Canyon of the Pacific\" you will drive all the way up the canyon. The result of thousands of years of erosion, the canyon walls offer a canvas of brilliant shades of red, brown, green, blue, gray and purple, with shadows and light producing a never-ending show.\n\nKauai\n\nEnjoy a free day discovering Kauai and its many natural wonders. Consider a helicopter flight over the Na Pali Coast and Manawaiopuna Falls or immerse yourself in the laidback lifestyle of the locals. Our island hop through Hawaii almost at its end, we join our Travel Director and travel companions for a Farewell Dinner.\n\nHow to book\n\nVarious departure dates throughout 2024 & 2025 - call or e-mail us for current availability.\n\nPlease call us on (01892) 779900 or email This email address is being protected from spambots.
