        "text": "“Sissy is not a name,” said Mr Gradgrind. “Don’t call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia.”\n\n“It’s father as calls me Sissy, sir,” returned the young girl, in a trembling voice and with another curtsey\n\n“Then he as no business to do it,” said Mr Gradgrind. “Tell him he mustn’t. Cecilia Jupe. Let me see.

Hoofs hard but requiring to be shod with iron. Age known by marks in mouth.” …\n\n“Now girl number twenty,” said Mr Gradgrind, “you know what a horse is.”\n\nShe curtsied again, and would have blushed deeper, if she could have blushed deeper than she had blushed all of this time …"
