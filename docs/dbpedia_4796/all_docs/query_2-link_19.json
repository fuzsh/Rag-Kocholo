        "text": "Northernmost populated island of the Hawaiian archipelago\n\nFor the Childish Gambino EP, see STN MTN / Kauai.\n\nNot to be confused with Kawaii.\n\nKauaʻi (Hawaiian: [kɐwˈwɐʔi]), anglicized as Kauai[a] ( KOW-eye[3] or kah-WAH-ee),[4] is one of the main Hawaiian Islands.\n\nIt has an area of 562.3 square miles (1,456.4 km2), making it the fourth-largest of the islands and the 21st-largest island in the United States.[5] Kauaʻi lies 73 miles (117 km) northwest of Oʻahu, across the Kauaʻi Channel. The island's 2020 population was 73,298.[6]\n\nStyling itself the \"Garden Isle\", Kauaʻi is the site of Waimea Canyon State Park and Na Pali Coast State Park. It forms the bulk of Kauai County, which also includes the small nearby islands of Kaʻula, Lehua, and Niʻihau.\n\nEtymology and language\n\n[edit]\n\nHawaiian narrative derives the name's origin from the legend of Hawaiʻiloa, the Polynesian navigator credited with discovering the Hawaiian Islands. The story relates that he named the island after a favorite son; a possible translation of Kauaʻi is \"place around the neck\", describing how a father would carry his child. Another possible translation is \"food season\".[7]\n\nKauaʻi was known for its distinct dialect of the Hawaiian language, which still survives on Niʻihau. While the dominant dialect is based on that of Hawaiʻi island, which has no [t] sound, the Kauaʻi dialect had this sound. This happened because the Kauaʻi dialect had retained the old Polynesian /t/ sound, replaced in the \"standard\" Hawaiʻi dialect by [k]. This difference applies to all words with these sounds, so the Kauaian name for Kauaʻi was pronounced \"Tauaʻi\", and Kapaʻa was pronounced \"Tapaʻa\".\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nPolynesian inhabitants settled on the island centuries before others arrived, as shown by excavations dating from 200 to 600 CE.[8] These first inhabitants, originally from the Marquesas Islands, lived undisturbed for around five centuries until a second wave arrived by sea-canoe from Tahiti.[9][10] Many Hawaiian traditions and belief structures derive from the culture that arrived with these Tahitians.[9]\n\nIn 1778, Captain James Cook arrived at Waimea Bay, the first European known to have reached the Hawaiian islands.[11] He named the archipelago the \"Sandwich Isles\" after his patron, the 6th Earl of Sandwich, George Montagu.[12]\n\nDuring the reign of King Kamehameha, Kauaʻi and Niʻihau joined his Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, the last to do so. Their ruler, Kaumualiʻi, resisted Kamehameha for years. Kamehameha twice prepared a huge armada of ships and canoes to take the islands by force, and twice failed, once because of a storm, and once because of an epidemic.[citation needed] But in the face of the threat of a further invasion, Kaumualiʻi decided to join the kingdom without bloodshed, and became Kamehameha's vassal in 1810. He ceded the island to the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi upon his death in 1824.[12]\n\nSchäffer affair\n\n[edit]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Schäffer affair.\n\nThe Schäffer affair was a controversial diplomatic incident caused by Georg Anton Schäffer, a German physician who attempted to seize the Kingdom of Hawaii for the Russian Empire. After two years, his scheme failed and he returned to Germany.\n\nPlantations\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the 1830s till the mid-20th century, sugarcane plantations were Kauaʻi's most important industry. In 1835, the first sugarcane plantation was founded on Kauaʻi, and for the next century the industry dominated Hawaiʻi's economy.[13] Kauaʻi's last sugarcane plantation, the 118-year-old Gay & Robinson Plantation, stopped planting sugar in 2008.[14]\n\nOld Sugar Mill of Koloa\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1835, Old Koloa Town opened a sugar mill.[12] From 1906 to 1934 the office of County Clerk was held by John Mahiʻai Kāneakua, who had been active in attempts to restore Queen Liliuokalani to the throne after the U.S. takeover of Hawaiʻi in 1893.[15]\n\nValdemar Knudsen\n\n[edit]\n\nValdemar Emil Knudsen was a Norwegian who arrived on Kauai in 1857. Knudsen, or \"Kanuka\", originally managed Grove Farm in Koloa. He later sought a warmer land and purchased the leases to Mana and Kekaha, where he became a successful sugarcane plantation owner. He settled in Waiawa, between Mana and Kekaha, immediately across the channel from Niʻihau Island.[16] His son, Eric Alfred Knudsen, was born in Waiawa.\n\nKnudsen was appointed land administrator by King Kamehameha for an area covering 400 km2, and was given the title konohiki as well as a position as a noble under the king. Knudsen, who spoke fluent Hawaiian, later became an elected representative and an influential politician.[17]\n\nKnudsen lends his name to the Knudsen Gap, a narrow pass between Hã’upu Ridge and the Kahili Ridge. Its primary function was as a sugar farm.[18][19]\n\nHurricane Iniki\n\n[edit]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Hurricane Iniki.\n\nHurricane Iniki ( ee-NEE-kee; Hawaiian: ʻiniki meaning \"strong and piercing wind\") was a hurricane that struck the island of Kauaʻi on September 11, 1992. It was the most powerful hurricane to strike Hawaiʻi in recorded history, and the only hurricane to directly affect the state during the 1992 Pacific hurricane season.[20] Forming on September 5, 1992, during the strong 1990–1995 El Niño, Iniki was one of eleven Central Pacific tropical cyclones during that season. It attained tropical storm status on September 8 and intensified into a hurricane the next day. After abruptly turning north, Iniki struck Kauaʻi at peak intensity; it had winds of 145 mph and reached Category 4 status on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale.\n\nMark Zuckerberg\n\n[edit]\n\nThis section is an excerpt from Mark Zuckerberg § Hawaiian land ownership.\n\nIn 2014 Zuckerberg purchased 700 acres of land on the Hawaiian island of Kauaʻi. In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight \"quiet title and partition\" lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to claim small tracts of land that they owned within his acreage.[21] Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a Facebook post, stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their \"fair share\".[21] When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits. Zuckerberg stated that he regretted not taking the time to understand the process and its history before moving ahead.[22][23]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nThe five-million-year-old island, the oldest of the main islands (Niʻihau is older), was formed volcanically as the Pacific Plate passed over the Hawaii hotspot.[24] It consists of an eroded shield volcano with a 9.3–12.4 mi (15.0–20.0 km) diameter summit caldera and two flanking calderas. Rejuvenation of the volcano 0.6–1.40 million years ago left lava flows and cones over the eastern two-thirds of the island.[25]\n\nKauaʻi's highest peak is Kawaikini, at 5,243 ft (1,598 m).[26] The second-highest is Mount Waiʻaleʻale, near the center of the island, 5,148 ft (1,569 m) above sea level. One of the wettest spots on earth, with an annual average rainfall of 460 in (38.3 ft; 11.7 m), is on the east side of Mount Waiʻaleʻale. The rain has eroded deep valleys in the central mountains, carving out canyons with many scenic waterfalls. On the west side of the island, Waimea town is at the mouth of the Waimea River, whose flow formed Waimea Canyon, one of the world's most scenic canyons, which is part of Waimea Canyon State Park. At three thousand ft (910 m) deep, Waimea Canyon is often called \"The Grand Canyon of the Pacific\". Kokeo Point lies on the island's south side.[citation needed] The Na Pali Coast is an isolated center for recreation, including kayaking along the beaches and hiking on the trail along the coastal cliffs.[27] The headlands Kamala Point, Kawai Point, Kawelikoa Point, Kuahonu Point, Paoʻa Point, and Molehu Point are on the southeast of the island; Makaokahaʻi Point and Weli Point are in the south.\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nKauaʻi's climate is tropical, with generally humid and stable conditions year-round, although infrequent storms cause severe flooding. At the lower elevations, the annual precipitation varies from an average of about 50 in (130 cm) on the windward (northeastern) shore to less than 20 in (51 cm) on the (southwestern) leeward side of the island. The average temperature in Lihu'e, the county seat, ranges from 78 °F (26 °C) in February to 85 °F (29 °C) in August and September.\n\nKauaʻi's mountainous regions offer cooler temperatures in contrast to the warm coastal areas. At Kōkeʻe State Park, 3,200–4,200 ft (980–1,280 m) ASL, day temperatures vary from an average of 45 °F (7 °C) in January to 68 °F (20 °C) in July. In the winter, temperatures have been known to drop down to the 30s and 40s at the park, which holds an unofficial record low of 29 °F (−2 °C), recorded in February 1986 at Kanaloahuluhulu Meadow.\n\nPrecipitation in Kauaʻi's mountainous regions averages 50–100 in (1,300–2,500 mm) annually. About ten mi (16 km) southeast of Kōkeʻe state park, at an elevation of 5,075 ft (1,547 m), is the Mt. Waiʻaleʻale rain gauge.[29] Mt. Waiʻaleʻale is often cited as the wettest spot on earth, although this has been disputed. Based on data for the period from 1931 through 1960, the average yearly precipitation was 460 in (11,700 mm) (U.S. Environmental Science Services Administration, 1968). Between 1949 and 2004, the average yearly precipitation at Mt. Waiʻaleʻale was 374 in (9,500 mm).[30]\n\nKauaʻi also holds a record in hourly precipitation. During a storm on January 24–25, 1956, a rain gauge at Kauaʻi's former Kilauea Sugar Plantation recorded a record twelve in (305 mm) of precipitation in just 60 minutes. The value for one hour is an underestimate, since the rain gauge overflowed, which may have resulted in an error by as much as 1 in (25 mm).[31] An accurate measurement may have exceeded Holt, Missouri's world-record rainfall of 12 in (300 mm) in 42 minutes on June 22, 1947.[32]\n\nTime zone\n\n[edit]\n\nHawaii Standard Time (UTC−10:00) is observed on Kauaʻi year-round. When mainland states are on daylight saving time, for example, the time on Kauaʻi is three hours behind the West Coast of the United States and six hours behind the East Coast.[33]\n\nRiver system\n\n[edit]\n\nWaimea River 35.7 km (22.2 mi)\n\nHanalei River 26.5 km (16.5 mi)\n\nHanapēpē River 24.2 km (15.0 mi)\n\nWainiha River 24 km (15 mi)\n\nWailua River 23.4 km (14.5 mi)\n\nMakaweli River 23.2 km (14.4 mi)\n\nHuleia River 21.4 km (13.3 mi)\n\nKalihiwai River 20 km (12 mi)\n\nAnahola River 19.4 km (12.1 mi)\n\nLumahaʻi River 16 km (9.9 mi)\n\nKōʻula River 14.8 km (9.2 mi)\n\nOlokele River 14.4 km (8.9 mi)\n\nKilauea Stream 13.4 km (8.3 mi)\n\nWaikomo Stream 9.8 km (6.1 mi)\n\nWaterfalls\n\n[edit]\n\nHalii Falls\n\nHanakapiai Falls\n\nHinalele Falls\n\nKalihiwai Falls\n\nKilauea Falls\n\nManawaiopuna Falls\n\nOpaekaa Falls\n\nWaialae Falls\n\nWailua Falls\n\nWaipoo Falls\n\nWaipoo Falls at Waimea Canyon State Park\n\nEconomy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Economic history of Kauaʻi\n\nTourism is Kauaʻi's largest industry. In 2007, 1,271,000 people visited. The two largest groups were from the continental United States (84% of all visitors) and Japan (3%).[34] As of 2003, approximately 27,000 jobs existed on Kauaʻi. The largest sector was accommodation/food services (26%, 6,800 jobs), followed by government (15%) and retail (14.5%), with agriculture accounting for 2.9% (780 jobs) and educational services providing 0.7% (183 jobs).[35] The visitors' industry accounted for one third of Kauaʻi's income.[35] Employment is dominated by small businesses, with 87% of all non-farm businesses having fewer than 20 employees.[35] As of 2003, Kauaʻi's poverty rate was 10.5%, compared to the mainland at 10.7%.[35]\n\nAs of 2014, the median home price was about $400,000.\n\nLand in Kauaʻi is very fertile; farmers raise many varieties of fruit and other crops. Guava, coffee, sugarcane, mango, banana, papaya, avocado, star fruit, kava, noni and pineapple are all cultivated on the island, but most agricultural land is used for raising cattle.[34]\n\nKauaʻi is home to the U.S. Navy's \"Barking Sands\" Pacific Missile Range Facility, on the western shore.\n\nMF and HF (\"shortwave\") radio station WWVH, sister station to WWV and low frequency WWVB in Fort Collins, Colorado, is on the west coast of Kauaʻi, about 3 mi (5 km) south of Barking Sands. WWVH, WWV and WWVB are operated by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology, broadcasting standard time and frequency information to the public.\n\nEnergy\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Kauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative\n\nKauaʻi Island Utility Cooperative (KIUC) is a not-for-profit electric utility cooperative headquartered in Līhuʻe, which provides electricity for the island. It has 24,000 member-owners who elect a nine-member board of directors.[36]\n\nIn the 1970s, Kauaʻi burned sugarcane waste to supply most[37] of its electricity.[37]\n\nBy 2008, transition of energy sources and growth in generating capacity had occurred, with most of Kauaʻi's electricity produced by imported liquid petroleum. In 2006 and 2007, the inputs cost $69.3 million and $83 million, respectively.[38] By 2011, 92% of KIUC's power came from diesel.[39]\n\nBy 2017, KIUC's fuel mix was 56% fossil fuels, 9% hydroelectric, 12% biomass and 23% solar. KIUC integrated large-scale solar into its grid so that, during sunny daylight hours, 97% or more of its generation came from renewable sources. KIUC offers $1,000 rebates to residential customers who have solar water heating systems installed on their homes.[40]\n\nIn 2017, KIUC opened a Tesla Energy 13 MW / 52 MWh battery next to the 12 MW Kapaia solar plant[41] for 13.9¢/kWh.[39] In December 2018, KIUC opened an AES Distributed Energy project for 20 MW solar with 20 MW / 100 MWh batteries priced at 11.1¢/kWh.[42]\n\nTowns and communities\n\n[edit]\n\nLīhuʻe, on the island's southeastern coast, is the seat of Kauaʻi County and the island's second-largest town. Kapaʻa, on the \"Coconut Coast\" (site of an old coconut plantation) about 6 mi (9.7 km) north of Līhuʻe, has a population of over 10,000, or about 50% greater than Līhuʻe. Princeville, on the island's north side, was once the capital of Kauaʻi.\n\nCommunities on Kauaʻi range in population from the roughly 10,000 people in Kapaʻa to tiny hamlets. Below are the larger or more notable of those from the northernmost end of Hawaii Route 560 to the western terminus of Hawaii Route 50:[citation needed]\n\nKauai towns and villages by population Name population Haʻena State Park 550 Wainiha 419 Hanalei 450 Princeville 2,158 Kalihiwai 428 Kilauea 3,014 Anahola 2,311 Kapaʻa 11,652 Wailua 2,359 Hanamāʻulu 4,994 Līhuʻe 8,004 Wailua Homesteads 5,863 Puhi 3,380 Poʻipū 1,299 Kōloa 2,231 Lāwaʻi 2,578 Kalāheo 4,996 ʻEleʻele 2,515 Hanapēpe 2,678 Kaumakani 749 Waimea 2,057 Kekaha 3,715 Pakala 294 Kealia 103\n\nHanalei town with a view of Mt.
