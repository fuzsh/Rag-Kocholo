        "text": "+ Summary\n\nHawaii is known around the world as a paradise—an ideal location for exotic vacations in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. However, before 1778, it was a hierarchical, independent nation full of indigenous, self-sufficient, Native Hawaiians that dwelled in harmony with their families, their islands, and their culture. From the arrival of foreigners on the Hawaiian islands up until the present day, the Native Hawaiian culture and population has been largely suppressed and has struggled to survive, nearly becoming extinct. This is due to the integration of Western influences through missionary work, the spread of foreign diseases, the introduction of a capitalist economy, and the illegal annexation of Hawaii by the United States Government in 1898. Because of this, the native language has been almost completely lost, the native population has shrunk and has suffered higher rates of illness, poverty, and homelessness, and Hawaiians have had to constantly fight for the sovereignty of their culture. However, cultural revival is currently underway from a recent resurrection of Hawaii’s preservation and celebration of traditional practices.\n\n+ Key Takeaways\n\nThe United States illegally annexed Hawaii, once a separate and sovereign nation, in 1886.\n\nAfter annexation, Hawaiian cultural practices declined in observance due to Western rule and influence over their land.\n\nNative Hawaiians lost their homes, health, resources, and people as capitalism, expensive healthcare, new laws, and foreign disease overwhelmed their land and culture.\n\nToday, Native Hawaiians have become a minority population in Hawaii, are in the worst state of health out of all the residents of Hawaii, and still lack affordable housing.\n\nThough Hawaiian culture has begun to slowly recover, the federal and state government must take further action to facilitate and improve living conditions for Native Hawaiians if their culture should ever regain the mass observance and recognition it once possessed.\n\n+ Key Terms\n\nAli’i - The highest social class in Hawaii, composed of the highest ranking chiefs and royalty that ruled over their respective islands or portions of islands.1\n\nKonohiki - A subset of chiefs or landlords who served under the ali’i class.2\n\nKamehameha I - First king of the Kingdom of Hawaii who united all of the islands into one island kingdom with the help of European weapons and military expertise.3\n\nQueen Liliuokalani - The last monarchical ruler of Hawaii until she was dethroned by the U.S. government in 1893.4\n\nKuleana Act - The Kuleana Act established a legal system of land ownership, gave Native Hawaiians claim to the land they lived on and legalized the purchase of those lands by foreigners. The passing of this act caused many Hawaiians to lose their homes which has led to the massive amount of homeless Native Hawaiians in Hawaii today.5\n\nOffice of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) - A public agency with the responsibility of improving the well-being of Native Hawaiians.6\n\nWhen foreign missionaries, specifically American Protestant missionaries, arrived in Hawaii in the 1820s, they used their strong influence over the ali’i and village people to promote their religious and Western ideals over native belief and culture. Though the missionaries intended to help them remain a sovereign nation, their close bond with the locals inevitably gave the American government leeway towards annexation.30 Though missionaries did help preserve the Hawaiian culture in some ways, their influence was detrimental to many foundational Hawaiian practices.31 32 For example, claiming the hula promoted “lasciviousness,” many prominent US missionaries were committed to its abolishment.33 In 1830, the dance was eradicated by Ka’ahumanu, wife of Kamehameha I, after she converted to Christianity and was convinced by missionaries to deem hula unlawful.34 Once a deeply religious and important cultural tradition, hula dancing became discouraged until 1886 when King Kalakaua, a firm believer in hula revival, was crowned. He appointed hula performers to take part in his coronation.35\n\nConfusion arose as konohiki began to sell land to foreigners that natives still lived on. In order to more clearly explain the exact meaning of “the rights of native tenants” clause, the Kuleana Act was passed in 1850. This act established a legal system of land ownership, gave Native Hawaiians claim to the land they lived on, and legalized the purchase of those lands by foreigners. The problem that surfaced with the act is that many natives who lived by tradition were unaware that they legally possessed land until they received compensation from its purchase by foreigners.47 After discovering that they had land and that it was being acquired by someone else, they only had 20 days to respond or it would turn into a costly legal battle that many natives couldn’t afford.48 The increase in foreign newcomers and the introduction of Western economic ideals to Hawaii led to the loss of ancestral land with deep cultural ties that Hawaiians have yet to gain back.49\n\nDue to the heavy influence from missionaries and other foreigners, the culture, the language, and many other native practices were discouraged. This caused a near extinction of the Hawaiian language, which began in 1896 after the overthrow of the throne. The Hawaiian language was banned from being taught in schools and was also discouraged from being spoken at home.55 In 1906, the Programme for Patriotic Exercises in the Public Schools began. This program was intended to Americanize the Hawaiian children, and they would be severely punished if they spoke Hawaiian at school.56 Consequently, in 1985, only 32 individuals on the island of Ni’ihau could speak the language fluently, when just a little over 200 years earlier, Hawaiian was the only language known and spoken by Hawaiian natives.57 Hawaiian Pidgin was also created by immigrants on plantations and ranches as early as the 1800s, which altered the Hawaiian language as well.58\n\nBecause of this, along with the fatal effect of foreign antibodies of Western diseases, Hawaiians today suffer the consequences.62 Native Hawaiians are two times more likely than the standard US population to develop Type 2 Diabetes,63 are eight times more likely to die from diabetes compared to non-Hawaiians,64 and five times more likely to die from heart disease compared to non-Hawaiians.65 They also have the second highest mortality rate in the US for all cancers (after male African Americans and female Alaskan natives).66 According to a report by the Office of Hawaiian Affairs in 2017, “Today, Native Hawaiians are perhaps the single racial group with the highest health risk in the State of Hawai‘i. This risk stems from high economic and cultural stress, lifestyle and risk behaviors, and late or lack of access to health care.”67\n\nDue to the effects of the Kuleana Act, Hawaiians have been wrongfully stripped of lands that belong to them, catching them in a poverty cycle because they are unable to access the resources that would allow them to escape poverty. In an attempt to mitigate the consequences of the Kuleana Act, the Hawaiian Homelands Commission Act (HHCA) was signed into law in 1921.68 Its purpose is to “enable Native Hawaiians to return to their lands in order to fully support self-sufficiency for Native Hawaiians and the self-determination of Native Hawaiians in the administration of this Act, and the preservation of the values, traditions and culture of Native Hawaiians.”69 It legally set aside approximately 200,000 acres on several Hawaiian islands for natives who were descendants of the indigenous people that lived on Hawaii before 1778 and are at least 50% Hawaiian.70 However, in 2016, only a little over 6,000 households resided in the Hawaiian homeland and 14,350 were on the waiting list for a lease.71 Of the Native Hawaiian households surveyed in a different report, 12,755 were living on Hawaiian Homestead Land in 2019, though this is still only 11% of the Native Hawaiian population.72\n\nThis indicates that many Native Hawaiians are still being deprived of their lands—a vital aspect of their culture, as it connects them to their ancestors—which leads to a perpetuation of their impoverished state. For example, Native Hawaiians make up 42% of the state’s homeless population (7,921 people total), have lower incomes, and have higher rates of poverty.73 And due to higher living costs in Hawaii, Native Hawaiians also face a higher cost burden rate at 40%, surpassing the national rate of 36%, which forces them to “cope with this challenge through extended family-living or overcrowding, taking on additional jobs, or moving to less expensive areas farther from employment.”74 Due to the fact that Native Hawaiians haven’t regained their ancestral land, they continue to face difficulty in accessing housing that would allow them to escape the poverty cycle.\n\nThe Hawaiian language, which was predicted to become extinct by the year 2000, survived because of various efforts from different groups. Larry Kimura and other Hawaiian language activists worked hard to record and radio broadcast the last native speakers in an effort to share and teach it to more natives.91 Punana Leo schools and Hawaiian immersion programs were established to teach the language as well as instill Hawaiian cultural values in Hawaii’s youth.92 Hawaiian became one of Hawaii’s official state languages in 1978 and now The University of Hawaii offers a bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD program in Hawaiian language.93 Though Hawaii has experienced a drastic decrease in the practice and influence of its culture in the past, these efforts for cultural revival are providing renewed hope that practices and customs once discouraged or forbidden can be openly spread and shared.\n\nWhile this wide dispersal of cultural practices has helped revive Native Hawaiian culture, in order to fully revive Hawaiian tradition and restore natives’ levels of health, financial status, and living conditions, proper policies and legislative measures need to be established. Currently, Hawaii’s state government and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) is working to improve the conditions of Native Hawaiians in the areas of “aina (land), culture, economic sufficiency, education, governance, and health.” However, more direct action must take place in order to disseminate the Hawaiian homestead land awards in a more efficient manner, as well as lower the eligible blood quantum to increase acceptable eligibility for land awards.94 While different organizations are striving to make affordable housing more of a reality in Hawaii, progress is slow and unproductive.95 If Native Hawaiians could regain their “sense of place” with resettlement on their ancestral lands, it is predicted that their quality of life would improve and their culture would flourish.\n\nKing Kamehameha III once declared, “Ua mau ke ea o ka aina, i ka pono,” which means “the life of the land is preserved in righteousness,” which later became Hawaii’s state motto.96 While many scholars and historians have interpreted the hidden meaning of this phrase in various ways, George S. Kanahele explained it by saying, “Perhaps the most important thing Hawaiians can do collectively to maintain their sense of place (culture) is to realize that, because our people were here first, we of today have the primary responsibilities for preserving and enriching the life of the land.”97 Hawaiian culture will survive and hopefully continue to thrive because of the combined efforts of the Hawaiian people and other people from distant lands."
