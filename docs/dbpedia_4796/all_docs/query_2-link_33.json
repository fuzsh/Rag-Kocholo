        "text": "On a standard map of the United States, Hawaii sits in the bottom left corner in a box next to Alaska. It would seem that the islands are as close to the Southwest as Cuba is to Florida. These maps obscure the fact that the distance between Los Angeles and Honolulu is roughly the same distance as L.A.to New York City. The sense of closeness modern American maps imply has been carefully created. Hawaii was once an independent kingdom in the Pacific, far from the reaches of the fledgling republic of the United States of America. Today, Hawaii is the 50th state, as American as it is exotic. Our current president, Barack Obama, was born there. Today, the status of its statehood is rarely questioned by those in the continental United States, but it was a long, complex road that changed a Pacific kingdom into the Aloha State.\n\nThe Hawaiian Kingdom (1810-1893)\n\nIn January 1778, during the second year of the American Revolution, a British explorer, Captain James Cook, landed on the Pacific island of Kauai. The British Admiralty and the British Royal Society sponsored Cooks exploration of the previously Spanish dominated Pacific. He famously probed the major islands of Australia and New Zealand, which later enabled the British settler societies to colonize the South Pacific. He named the contemporary Hawaiian islands the Sandwich Islands, after the Earl of Sandwich.\n\nThe islands were not empty. In fact, Cook encountered a well-developed society.\n\nThe present-day Hawaiian Island were first settled by Polynesian seafarers over a thousand years before Cooks arrival. These Polynesian explorers first settled on the coasts, and then moved further inland as the population increased. When Cook arrived, it is estimated that somewhere between 200,000 and 1,000,000 people lived theretoday Hawaiis population is just 1,374,810.\n\nAncient Hawaiian society developed into a caste society, comparable to Indias. A land tenure system existed in the islands that looked much like the feudal system in Medieval Europe. Farming was integral to Hawaii. The people grew crops including sweet potatoes, yams, and bananas, and kept livestock. A complex legal system existed based on religious taboos, known as kapu. One of the most serious kapu was that men and women were not allowed to eat together. Breaking this law was punishable by death.\n\nCaptain Cook died on the island of Hawaii, just a year after his arrival. Cook attempted to take Kalaniopuu, the King of the island of Hawaii, hostage as collateral for a stolen boat. A Hawaiian chief killed Cook in retaliation.\n\nEuropean contact coincided with a fierce struggle for power in the islands. There were four dominant chiefdoms that vied for power over the islands: the Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, and Kauai. Chief Kamehameha managed to conquer all islands except for Niihau and Kauai. He gained control of the remaining islands through diplomacy by 1810.\n\nKamehameha (1810-1819) proclaimed himself king of the Hawaiian Islands, ending feudalistic chiefdoms. With his rule, Hawaii became a constitutional monarchy, modeled after Europe. Although he accepted many western customs, he maintained kapu, the religious laws that governed Hawaiian society.\n\nThe British Empire, which would battle to hold its imperial ties in North America during the War of 1812, considered the islands to be a British protectorate. As King Kamehameha was able to rule a united Hawaiian kingdom, the British crown recognized Kamehameha as the legitimate ruler with the hope that he would maintain order and allow the British to use the islands in their increasing Pacific trade networks with China.\n\nLearn more about ancient Hawaiian culture here\n\nRead The Hawaiian Kingdom by Ralph S. Kuykendall here\n\nRead the British Consul General in Hawaiis biography of a nation: Manley Hopkins, Hawaii: The Past, Present, and Future of its Island Kingdom (London: Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1862)\n\nIn 1819, King Kamehameha died from an unknown illness. After his death, his son Liholiho, or King Kamehameha II (1819-1824) came to power. But, when Liholiho arrived to take power, he discovered that Kamehamehas favorite wife, Queen Kaahumanu, had already done so herself. She boldly invited Liholiho to a feast in which men and women would dine together, violating kapu.\n\nShortly thereafter, Queen Kaahumanu and King Kamehameha II officially ended kapu. In doing so, they ended the old religion that had governed life in the islands, just months before the arrival of American protestant missionaries. Christianity allowed Kaahumanu to restore order in the islands in the midst of the chaos from the end of kapu. Throughout the remainder of the nineteenth century, missionaries radically changed Hawaii. The introduction of Christianity meant outlawing many tenets of Hawaiian culture including hula and traditional healing. The Hawaiian people had lost their faith, traditions, and quite literally themselves. Much like Native Americans on theU.S.mainland, the native population in Hawaii dwindled rapidly due to the introduction of new diseases such as smallpox. In the midst of this chaos, missionaries offered hope through Christianity and western civilization. Furthermore, they provided Hawaiians with written language and by the 1830s,Hawaii held the highest literacy rate in the world.\n\nBy the time Queen Kaahumanu died in 1832, Hawaii was a Christian nation. Foreigners from Europe and the United States began to settle in the islands at a rapid rate. At a time of rapid territorial expansion, the islands were a hot commodity for these imperial powers. There were lucrative opportunities for trade in Hawaii from sandalwood to whaling. Foreign powers found it easy to influence the monarchy, weak from loss of population. In 1839, the French forced Kamehameha III to sign the Edict of Toleration, in which the Hawaiian government and allowed the establishment of a Hawaiian Catholic Church and ended the persecution of Catholics that had begun at the behest of Protestant missionaries.\n\nIn 1843, the British, under Captain Lord George Paulet, occupied the Hawaiian Islands for five months because of a land dispute involving a Briton, Richard Charlton. Hawaiian sovereignty was restored by Rear Admiral Richard Thomas five months later, who renounced the actions of Charlton and Paulet. In 1849, the French arrived in Honolulu with ten demands for the monarchy, including an end to continued persecution of Catholics and high tariffs on French goods. When these demands were not met in a timely fashion, the French invaded Honolulu and captured the city. They left one month later, after raiding government buildings and other property in Honolulu.\n\nIn the face of increasing European interest in the islands, Kamehameha III decided to solicit protection from the United States. On March 10, 1851, the King formally applied to the United States Congress to become a protectorate of the United States. Hawaii did not become a protectorate of the United States in 1851, but the seeds were sown for the relationship of dependence that would color the remaining years of the Hawaiian monarchy.\n\nRead the debate transcript from in the U.S. Senate about the Paulet Affair here\n\nRead An Unpublished Chapter of Hawaiian History Harpers New Monthly Magazine 67, (1883): 511-520.\n\nThe Business of American Missionaries\n\nKamehameha III filled his cabinet with foreign-born ministers who advised him on how to rule the islands. In 1848, the Mahele divided Hawaiian lands into private property for the first time. In 1850, the Alien Land Ownership Act allowed for foreign ownership of Hawaiian lands. Because of Hawaiian unfamiliarity with private property, higher classes and foreigners were easily able to obtain much of the land in the islands, leaving many native Hawaiians landless. Much of the available land was bought up by Protestant missionaries and their descendants.\n\nAmerican missionary families, over the years, became extremely successful businessmen. While the whaling industry declined, these missionaries-turned-entrepreneurs found great success in the creation of vast sugar plantations in the islands. Soon, the need for labor surpassed the number of available workers. Immigrants from Japan,China, the Philippines,Korea,Portugal, and other nations came to Hawaii to labor on these booming plantations. This sparked the creation of an extremely diverse population inHawaii. Meanwhile, a new class of wealthy, white planters emerged in Hawaii alongside the growing immigrant population.\n\nBy the 1850s, three-fourths of all business in Hawaii was controlled by American businessmen, and the primary export market was to Americas Pacific Coast. These missionary families acquired great wealth, and then great political power, even forming their own political partythe Missionary Party. With perceived instability on the part of the Hawaiian monarchy, these families began to push for annexation in order to ensure protection from the United States.\n\nIn 1854, the United States made its first attempt to annex the Hawaiian Islands.\n\nThe treaty was negotiated between U.S. Commissioner David L. Gregg and Hawaiian Minister of Foreign Affairs Robert Crichton Wyllie. For King Kamehameha III, annexation would further ensure Hawaiis security, much like the protectorate had. Negotiations were underway when King Kamehameha III died in December of 1854. His heir, Kamehameha IV, ended all negotiations with Gregg, in effect killing any possible annexation treaty.\n\nRead Hawaiian-born missionary descendant William De Witt Alexanders take on the Uncompleted Treaty of Annexation of 1854, including text of the treaty in the appendix here\n\nHowever, the Missionary Party continued to push for greater ties. During the Civil War, demand for sugar increased as a result of the blockade from the Confederate states that had provided it previously. American planters in Hawaii saw that they were perfectly poised to fill the market, but did not like the high tariff rates they encountered. The Reciprocity Treaty of 1875 allowed for duty-free importation of Hawaiian sugar. In exchange, the United States was granted land for a naval base, which eventually became Pearl Harbor.\n\nThe wealth gained from this new treaty was largely concentrated in the hands of a few of the corporations descended from missionary families, known as The Big Five. These corporationsCastle & Cooke, Alexander & Baldwin, C. Brewer & Co., American Factors, and Theo H. Davies & Co.not only controlled the sugar industry, but had a hand in most of Hawaiis economic matters. Furthermore, these elites enjoyed a close relationship with the Hawaiian monarchyone they would betray when that relationship was no longer profitable.\n\nAn early annexation debate in the New York Tribune: Annexation of the Sandwich Islands, New York Tribune (July 20, 1854), 4.\n\nRead instructions given to diplomatic representatives of the United States in the Hawaiian Islands (1881-1893)\n\nRead instructions given to naval officers of the United States with reference to affairs in the Hawaiian Islands (1881-1893)\n\nThe End of the Hawaiian Monarchy (1887-1893)\n\nKing Kalakaua (1874-1891) began his reign as a friend to the United States. He negotiated the aforementioned Reciprocity Treaty. In 1881, he became the first king to travel around the world, leaving his sister, Liliuokalani to rule as regent in his absence. During Kalakauas reign, he also built the iconic Iolani Palace, which still stands today.\n\nThe Missionary Party was unhappy with Kalakauas rule, most importantly his spending. Those who favored annexation joined together in a group called the Hawaiian League. In 1887, the League forced Kalakaua at gunpoint to sign a new constitution that virtually stripped the monarchy of its power. Known as the Bayonet Constitution because of the manner in which King Kalakaua was forced to sign it, the new constitution further consolidated power in the hands of wealthy elites.\n\nQueen Liliuokalani, the last monarch of the Hawaiian Kingdom, came to power in 1891 after her brother Kalakaua died of illness in San Francisco.\n\nThe situation in Hawaii worsened drastically towards the end of the nineteenth century due to the 1890 Tariff Act, also known as the McKinley Tariff. In 1891, just before the tariff went into effect, 274,982,295 pounds of sugar was transported from Hawaii to the United States while Hawaii exported only 285 pounds to the rest of the world. The new tariff effectively ended the advantageous position American sugar planters had enjoyed under the Reciprocity Treaty. The effect of this economic downturn was felt by all Hawaiian residents. In the face of this crisis, in 1893 Queen Liliuokalani attempted to promulgate a new constitution, one that would place more power with the monarchy instead of the American and European-dominated legislature.\n\nIn response, members of the Missionary Party formed the Committee of Safety, a group committed to the end of the Hawaiian monarchy and U.S.annexation (which would eliminate all tariffs on sugar exports to the continental United States). Their plan to overthrow the monarchy was set into action on January 17, 1893. Committee members enlisted the Honolulu Rifles, an armed regiment of non-Hawaiians, to depose the Queen. U.S. Government Minister John L. Stevens simultaneously solicited the U.S.government for further protection, claiming that American lives were in danger. U.S. Marines soon joined the coup, leading to Queen Liliuokalanis surrender.\n\nQueen Liliuokalani surrendered that day, but did not give up the fight for her kingdom:"
