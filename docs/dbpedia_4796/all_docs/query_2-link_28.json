        "text": "THE FIRST PRINTED MAP OF HAWAII\n\nThe first map of Hawai’i is often credited to Captain James Cook because he was in charge of the expedition that produced it. The official map is attributed to Lt. Henry Roberts, who prepared for publication all of the maps appearing in the three-volume narrative detailing the adventures of Cook’s final voyage.\n\nThe large inset of “Karakakooa Bay” represents the Kealakekua Bay on the island of Hawaii the scene of Cook’s first landing and also the scene of his death. The tracks of Cook’s ships are shown by the dashed and solid lines. The longitudes in the bottom and top borders are numbered continuously in an eastward direction from Greenwich; the longitudes shown on this map can be converted to the modern format by subtracting the value of 360.\n\nAlthough best known for his later involvement in the famous mutiny on the Bounty, Bligh earlier sailed with Cook. He was an outstanding seaman and accomplished chart maker. Only twenty-one when selected by Cook as master for his flagship, the Resolution, Bligh performed many critical duties aboard ship, one of which was to assist in the making of the charts and harbor plans. After the publication of the official narrative of Cook’s third voyage, Bligh privately challenged the assertion that Roberts drew the maps that accompanied the volumes, claiming credit himself for many of the maps, particularly the plan of Kealakekua Bay and much of the larger map of the “Sandwich Islands.”\n\nGEORGE VANCOUVER\n\nThe third major expedition to Hawaii was led by the English explorer Capt. George Vancouver, who visited the islands between 1792 and 1794. He had traveled to the Pacific with Capt. Cook on both the 2nd and 3rd voyages. Vancouver was one of the most qualified and experienced English officers. He sailed to the Pacific with the specific purpose of settling a dispute in Nootka Sound and finishing what Cook had started …searching for the elusive Northwest Passage.\n\nHis was the only expedition to completely circumnavigate all the islands of the chain. Vancouver’s voyage resulted in the first published map of Hawaii depicting the islands in their entirety. This landmark work, credited to Joseph Baker, is one of the most significant maps in Hawaiian history.\n\nThe Vancouver – Baker chart remained the basic map of Hawai’i for nearly 80 years, though some of the errors found were corrected by later map makers.\n\nAdditionally, Vancouver introduced cattle to Hawaii and is responsible for a political relationship between Hawaii and England which led the Kingdom of Hawaii to make its own flag and to insert the Union Jack in the upper corner. Hawaii was never under British rule, though it was for some years a British protectorate.\n\nThe flag of Hawaii originated with the Hawaiian Kingdom and continues to this day as a state flag. It incorporates elements of the British Union Jack and the American Stars and Stripes.\n\nThe flag of Hawaii originated with the Hawaiian Kingdom and continues to this day as a state flag. It incorporates elements of the British Union Jack and the American Stars and Stripes\n\nHawaii began as an independent kingdom. It became a protectorate, republic, territory and finally the 50th state of the United States. It is the only state flag of the United States to have been flown under so many forms of government and the only American flag to feature the Union Flag of the United Kingdom, as part of its design. This is a holdover from the period 1794-to 1843 when Hawaii was a British protectorate.\n\nThe field of the flag is composed of eight red, white and blue horizontal stripes symbolizing the eight major islands (Niihau, Kauai, Oahu, Molokai, Lanai, Maui Kahoolawe and the Big Island of Hawaii). A ninth stripe was once included representing the island of Nihoa.\n\nThere are various accounts of the early history of the flag. One relates how King Kamehameha I flew a British flag, probably a Red Ensign, given to him by British explorer Captain George Vancouver as a token of friendship with King George III.\n\nSubsequent visits reported seeing the flag flying from places of honor. An adviser to Kamehameha noted that the British flag could draw Hawaii into international conflict, as his kingdom might be seen as an ally of the United Kingdom, and he subsequently lowered it.\n\nAnother story reports that in order to placate American interests during the War of 1812, a flag of the United States was raised over the king’s home only to be removed when British officers in the court of Kamehameha strongly objected to it. This version would explain why the resulting flag deliberately combined the flags of both countries. In 1816, Kamehameha commissioned his own flag to avoid conflict and the current flag of Hawaii was born. It continues in use today as the flag of the 50th state.\n\nNA MOKUPUNI O HAWAII NEI BY SAMUEL KALAMA. ONE OF THE FIRST MAPS MADE IN HAWAII, IN HAWAIIAN BY A NATIVE HAWAIIAN ENGRAVER WHO HAD LEARNED HIS CRAFT FROM AMERICAN MISSIONARIES. IT WAS PUBLISHED IN 1838. (CLICK ON THE MAP TO ORDER)\n\nProtestant missionaries from the United States arrived in Hawaii on March 30, 1820, after a five-month voyage from Boston aboard the Thaddeus. The “Pioneer Company” of missionaries brought the institution of Christianity to the islands. They arrived at a very fortunate time, just weeks after the Hawaiians had overthrown their old system of beliefs which had many rituals the worship of idols and prohibitions known as kapu.\n\nThe missionaries were practical people. They believed that teaching the native population to read and write was necessary was to further their Christian goals. To this end schools were built, teachers trained, and printing presses established. The intent was to make the Hawaiians capable of reading the Bible. As their schools progressed a need arose for books and maps.\n\nThe missionaries responded first by hand copying them from various sources. Later, the art of copperplate engraving and printing was taught to Hawaiian students so that maps could be engraved and printed in their native language. These maps, now extremely rare, were provided to schools throughout the islands.\n\nThe most significant development in the effort to provide maps for the geographic education of the Hawaiians began in the mid-1830s at the Lahainaluna an early missionary school on Maui. The task of building and operating the school was assigned to Lorrin Andrews, a missionary who had arrived in 1828 and served in the town of Lahaina. Andrews was educated at Jefferson College in Pennsylvania and at the Princeton Theological Seminary. He established a press at Lahainaluna to satisfy the demand for educational materials.\n\nThe early presses printed literally millions of pages including the first newspaper in the islands, Ka Lama Hawaii. Andrews also translated and published numerous school books including religious treatises, geographies, and mathematical texts.\n\nThis Pacific centered double hemisphere map was produced at Lahainaluna on the island of Maui by Hawaiian students. The diagram on the right of the map shows the relative heights of major mountains.\n\nNO PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF LAND IN THE KINGDOM\n\nIn old Hawaii there was no diverse ownership of land, the kings of the Kamehameha dynasty owned it all. They awarded custody of lands to their loyal chiefs-known as ali’i. Island kingdoms (mokupuni) were divided into districts (moku) which were further parceled into minor chiefdoms (ahupua’a). Parcels claimed by the royalty but where ordinary native people lived and worked were known as kuleana lands.\n\nTypically ahupua’a were in a roughly triangular shape extending from the high forested mountains to offshore fishing grounds at sea level with the point at the mountain and the widest part at the shore. These pie shaped pieces provided the residents with access to the resources of all elevations without crossing borders.\n\nWithin each ahupua’a were ‘ili, or smaller holdings, each typically worked by one extended family. Throughout the Hawaiian Islands, the names of moku and some ahupua’a are preserved to this day as geographic areas.\n\nEven lands controlled by the chiefly class did not pass by inheritance; what the crown gave, it could also take back or reassign to others. Because land was immortal and humans mortal, the idea that humans could own land was something that neither the kings or the commoners understood. Their attitude was one of territorial caretaking rather than ownership. It was said that land could not belong to man because man belonged to the land.\n\nIn his 1840 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii, Kamehameha III stated that although his father was founder of the kingdom, the land “was not his own private property. It belonged to the chiefs and people in common, of whom Kamehameha I was the head, and had the management of the landed property.”\n\nTHE GREAT MAHELE OF 1848\n\nAs the century progressed people of many nationalities settled in Hawaii and as the Western population grew it and became influential and out spoken in calling for an end to the semi-feudal land ownership system.\n\nIn 1848 Kamehameha III and 245 chiefs met to divide the Hawaii lands among themselves. They hoped to have a land system that gave a wider ownership base but still kept Hawaiian lands out of the hands of foreign owners. Sixty percent of the land was allocated as the Hawaiian crown lands. Thirty-nine percent was given to the chiefs and the remaining one percent was to go to the common people. This land division was called the Great Mahele.\n\nTwo years later in 1850 two more important laws were passed. One allowed aliens to own land in the Kingdom, and the other permitted Hawaiians who had formerly worked kuleana lands to claim it as their own homesteads if they followed certain procedures. Unfortunately very few Hawaiians understood the new land ownership system or the real value of the lands. They were persuaded that if they allowed foreign ownership that it would encourage foreign investment, which indeed it did. Large tracts of land were soon purchased and leased to non-Hawaiians mainly for agricultural purposes and the framework of what became Hawaii’s sugar and pineapple plantation system was laid.\n\nBecause Hawaiians were not inclined to work on the plantations the owners of these vast operations imported foreign labor from Japan, China, the Philippines and Canary Islands to work in the fields. Thus the framework of a new power system primarily owned by American merchants was established and the composition of the population changed drastically as wave after wave of foreign workers arrived in Hawaii\n\nTHE HAWAIIAN GOVERNMENT SURVEY\n\nDuring the Kingdom of Hawai’i legislative session of 1868, Curtis Jere Lyons, the representative from North Kohala, addressed the subject of the real estate problem facing the Kingdom of Hawaii. Lyons proposed that an official government surveyor be hired to try to resolve the numerous inaccuracies introduced by the insufficient surveying during the Mahele.\n\nWilliam DeWitt Alexander was born in Honolulu on April 2, 1833 a little less than a year after his parents, William Patterson and Mary Ann McKinney Alexander arrived in Hawaii with a company of Protestant missionaries under the auspices of American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM) based in Boston. After a brief stint in the Marquesas Islands and an unsuccessful attempt to establish a mission station, the family was transferred to Lahainaluna, Maui in 1843. Nine year old William was sent to Honolulu where he was placed in the first class of Punahou School.\n\nThere he immediately demonstrated his intellectual abilities and was frequently called on to instruct his peers in Latin. In 1849 he completed his course of study at Punahou and sailed around Cape Horn to the United States to attend Yale University in 1850. Alexander, despite illness, excelled at Yale. He was selected Phi Beta Kappa and joined the elite Skull and Bones club.\n\nHe graduated in 1855 with honors. After a year as headmaster at a secondary school in Indiana, he went to earn a masters degree from Yale in 1858. A class in surveying during his junior year at Yale gave Alexander the basic skills to create one of the greatest maps of Haleakala ever created.\n\nAlexander’s map of Haleakala was the first to document how dramatically magnetic north can vary within a fairly short distance. It demonstrated Alexander’s mastery of the basic principles needed to run a surveying operation. Indeed, it was probably the most scientific land survey of Hawaii to that date.\n\nIn the fall of 1870, W.D. Alexander was formally appointed Surveyor General of the Kingdom of Hawaii. Despite the challenges of creating a new surveying and mapping agency from scratch, Alexander had a clear vision for the agency which was described in a letter to his superior April 4, 1874 where he states, “Our survey differs from similar European operations in not being military or a purely scientific and topographical survey, but a survey of the landed property of the kingdom. It, however, resembles those surveys and the U.S. Coast Survey in being founded on accurate trigonometrical and astronomical measurements.”\n\nAt the time of the establishment of the Hawaiian Government Survey, the United States had not yet created the U.S. Geological Survey, which would become America’s first truly national mapping agency. Although mapping was an important component of the General Land Office, it was limited to the portions of the country using the Public Land Survey System.\n\nThe oldest mapping operation in America, the Coast Survey, charted only the shorelines and nearby waters to aid navigators. The only well-developed mapping agencies in existence were in Europe.\n\nYet Alexander recognized that those agencies were not good models for Hawaii. As he noted, European agencies were producing detailed maps for military purposes. With no history of warfare with neighboring nations, Hawaii had no need to produce maps to plan defensive systems or launch offensive campaigns.\n\nScientific mapping especially in the form of geologic mapping was also taking hold in Europe, but Hawaii with virtually no mineral resources, had no need of mapping to assist a mining industry. Though several nations in Europe were developing large-scale topographic mapping, the cost of such detailed mapping was more than Hawaii could afford.\n\nAlexander was thus steered a course that fit within a limited budget and would contribute directly to the welfare of the nation. He was intent on mapping the lands and documenting the boundaries of the property that constituted the Kingdom of Hawaii. Alexander thought such a survey was much needed in order to determine what Government lands remained unsold.\n\nAlexander also warned that there had never been a uniform system of surveying the kuleanas. The work had been done in a hasty and fragmentary manner by incompetent surveyors. He suggested that both, for the good of the people and the information of the government to make a thorough examination of all the original surveys.\n\nUpon completion he suggested marking the principal corners in a permanent manner. He further argued that the private surveying profession would also benefit from the agency’s work. The government district maps would provide future surveyors with clear land coordinates.\n\nAlexander also felt that all information in the Survey Office should be accessible under proper regulations to members of the profession, and in return copies of all boundary surveys both public and private should be deposited with the office.\n\nAlexander thought he should represent an exact delineation for the shore line and the more important topographical features of the country. (However, he did not propose to make a regular topographical survey of the country or to run lines of level, except for some special object; although it is intended to measure the heights of all the prominent stations.) He also declined to make a general hydrographical survey of the depth of water and the character of the bottom of the sea around each island. There were numerous reasons Hawaii needed a government survey agency and it was quite fortunate to find a man with such a clear well-defined vision of what the agency could contribute to government and society. (Moffatt – Fitzpatrick quote)\n\nThe first major map published by the Hawaiian Government Survey was prepared especially for the Hawaiian exhibit at the International Exhibition of Arts, Manufactures and Products of the Soil and Mine, which opened in Philadelphia in the spring of 1876, celebrating the 100th anniversary of American independence, it was more commonly known as the Centennial Exhibition.\n\nIn size, design, and execution it compared favorably with the best wall maps displayed there. Its design and scope were undoubtedly decided by Surveyor General, W.D. Alexander, with the manuscript compiled by Curtis Lyons, who was responsible for most of the drafting for the government survey at that time. H.Giles is credited with the final execution.\n\nAt a scale of 30,000 feet to the inch, the map said Alexander, “will do this country no little credit at the Centennial.” Alexander also noted that the map was an impressive four feet high by six feet wide. As it turned out, however, the printed map was published at approximately thirty-five inches in height by fifty-five inches in width, or 75 percent of the actual size Alexander had intended, a reduction that may have been made for reasons of cost or expediency. Certainly publishing a map at the intended size would have been a monumental task; even at the final size it was a significantly large map for the time period.\n\nThe change in size also changed the scale, from 30,000 feet to the inch, or 1:360,000 to 40,000 feet to the inch, or 1:480,000. Regrettably, when the scale statement was printed, it kept Alexander’s planned scale of 30,000 feet to the inch rather than showing the actual scale. Such an error would have been difficult to catch without having a representative of the Hawaiian Government Survey in attendance at the printer’s plant. As the agency’s first formal production, the map remains a remarkable achievement despite the error.\n\nAn examination of the Centennial map reveals that it deliberately departs from the policy and intent of the Hawaiian Government Survey. Unlike the agency’s other maps, it is not a map of the landed property of the kingdom and was not meant for a technical audience.\n\nAlexander thus chose to highlight the main topographical features rather than information on land titles or land divisions. Those features are more accurately placed than ever before, and the kingdom’s towns and major plantations and ranches are named.\n\nAlexander took extra pains to portray information not normally found on a map of this type, by indicating the extent of many of the major forested areas on Hawaii and Maui and delineating historic lava flows. However, at this stage in the life of the government survey, only Oahu had been completely surveyed and was thus correctly drawn. In the coming years, the agency would improve the shape of the individual islands as accurate surveys were completed, but the Centennial map remained the basic map of the Kingdom until 1901.\n\nThe map’s design contained a number of interesting aspects, the compass cartouche, for instance, appears to link Hawai’i with the American mainland. Considering the map’s debut at a centennial celebration for the United States, one might wonder if this placement was intentional. Also notable are the insets in the lower left corner of plan views of Haleakala, Moku’aweoweo, and Kilauea. Since the map held a prominent place in the Hawai’i exhibit at the exposition, the inclusion of these craters reflects the pride Hawaiians took in their volcanoes.\n\nBy highlighting volcanoes and lava flows, the kingdom may have been playing to the nascent tourist industry. It is interesting to note, for example, that all the crater plans are drawn at the same scale of approximately one mile to the inch. On either side of the map’s title is a representation of the main building of the exposition drawn at the same scale. At more than a quarter mile long, the exposition building was monumental for its time. The judicious placement of the crater insets seems almost a subtle taunt from across the Pacific; “If you think this building is grand you should see our volcanoes”\n\nOVERTHROW OF THE KINGDOM, ANNEXATION AND MAPS\n\nDespite the high caliber of mapping produced by the Hawaiian Government Survey during the late 1800’s, commonly available maps of the world or of the Pacific Ocean presented a serious distortion of Hawaii’s position, particularly in relation to Asia.\n\nThe popular phrase “Hawaii, crossroads of the Pacific” is because of the many maps that suggest that Hawaii lies at the intersection of the most direct trade and travel routes between Asia and the Americas. At least until recent times, this was a false assumption. The very fact that so many of the early explorers failed to find the Hawaiian Islands indicates that it was not on the main sea routes of earlier times.\n\nBut leading up to the overthrow of the Kingdom by American mercantile interests in 1893 it became popular to put an emphasis on the supposed “strategic” defensive and commercial positioning of Hawaii. This was one of several factors that contributed to the American take over and encouraged early expansionist ideas.\n\nNew found opportunity for financially successful commercial ventures may have also been a catalyst. The Reciprocity Treaty of 1876 caused one of the major changes of the use of Hawaiian lands. This agreement allowed Hawaiian Sugar to enter the United States without tariffs which encouraged expansion of sugar plantations, consequently creating an exportable cash crop to.\n\nIn January 1893 the Queen Liliuokalani was overthrown and the Republic of Hawaii was formed. The following year, the Republic of Hawaii offered to be annexed by the United States. After an investigation of the overthrow, the Senate voted to accept the annexation. However, President Grover Cleveland vetoed the annexation offer, and since there were not enough votes to override the veto, the annexation offer died.\n\nAt the time of these hearings, a 43 page document was printed by the U.S. Government Printing Office for the Department of the Army, entitled The Hawaiian Islands; Report on the Physical Features, Ports of landing, Supplies, Climate, Diseases, Etc. Compiled from the Best Available Sources for the Information of the Army. The first page of the report says. “The strategic value of the islands and their geographical position are indicated on chart titled Naval Chart of the Pacific and Western Atlantic”.\n\nDuring this period the implied strategic value of the Hawaiian Islands is often indicated by the use of straight lines representing the sailing routes from the Pacific Northwest to Australia and New Zealand and from Panama to major ports in Asia, all leading to Hawaii. These maps clearly intended to show that all major trade routes in the Pacific passed through or very near Hawaii.\n\nThe authors of the report to Congress were far from alone in their apparent belief in Hawaii’s value to the United States. Many Mainland Americans ardently supported the idea of Hawaiian annexation and used maps to further their views.\n\nPhiladelphia publishers Linton & Garragues issued a map in February 1893 one month after the overthrow that fits this mold. Signed by some of the leading men in the take over it contained an inflammatory text depicting the native people as heathens and baby eaters. It also shows the arrows seeming to place Hawaii at the hub of the Pacific.\n\nIn 1898 the United States entered into the Spanish-American War, attacking and capturing the Philippines and Guam, two Spanish possessions in the Pacific Ocean. At this point, the annexation offer by The Republic of Hawai’i was revisited, again winning Senate approval. This time, the new Republican president, William McKinley, signed the bill and Hawaii officially became a U.S. Territory.\n\nOVERTHROW OF KINGDOM BRINGS END TO SURVEY OFFICE\n\nThe Hawaiian Government Survey existed for 28 years. Its demise came with Hawaii’s annexation by the United States in 1898. At the time of annexation Hawai’i was more precisely mapped than any other territorial acquisition and even than most states at the time. Whether for small scale mapping of the Kingdom as a whole, medium scale mapping of individual islands, detailed mapping at the city level, or property level surveys and plots, the work of the Hawaiian Government Survey was more than adequate for the American government to begin administering the new Territory of Hawaii often abbreviated T.H.\n\nBy November 1898, scarcely more than two months after formal annexation, the first chart of the Territory of Hawaii was published. It was created specifically to aid in commercial navigation, simply used information that had already been compiled by the Hawaiian Government Survey. The chart reflects the government survey’s accuracy in mapping the geography of the principal islands.\n\nA lack of funds led Alexander to print his maps using the then emerging lithographic process for producing maps. Though the result may not have been always as beautiful as the maps produced by European mapping agencies that still used copperplate engraving, the litho maps could be made more quickly and at a much lower cost and their quality would prove to be as high as that of any maps produced on the Mainland United States.\n\nIn years of existence prior to the Hawaiian Government Survey produced a body of high level sophisticated scientific maps. W.D. Alexander and his staff built a mapping agency that operated to the same standards of quality as any of the premier national mapping agencies elsewhere in the world. Through the introduction and development of modern survey techniques, the agency painstakingly crafted an approach to mapping that was best suited to the needs of Hawaii at the time.\n\nThanks to their wisdom and skill in defining and implementing their own program, the team of surveyors and draftsmen of the Hawaiian Government Survey helped to preserve the geography and many valuable aspects of the history of the Kingdom of Hawai’i.\n\nOVERTHROW OF KINGDOM BRINGS END TO SURVEY OFFICE\n\nThe Hawaiian Government Survey existed for 28 years.

W.D. Alexander and his staff built a mapping agency that operated to the same standards of quality as any of the premier national mapping agencies elsewhere in the world. Through the introduction and development of modern survey techniques, the agency painstakingly crafted an approach to mapping that was best suited to the needs of Hawaii at the time.\n\nThanks to their wisdom and skill in defining and implementing their own program, the team of surveyors and draftsmen of the Hawaiian Government Survey helped to preserve the geography and many valuable aspects of the history of the Kingdom of Hawai’i."
