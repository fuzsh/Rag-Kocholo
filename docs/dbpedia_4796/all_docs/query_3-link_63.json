        "text": "Take two young women with a passion for the iconic American Mustang, both looking for a grand adventure, add four American Mustangs and a curious wild-born molly Mulestang, and you have the ingredients for the “Mustang Discovery Ride.”\n\nPresented by the Mustang Heritage Foundation, the Mustang Discovery Ride will take us on a journey across the United States aboard American Mustangs traveling the American Discovery Trail. Riders, Hannah Catalino and Lisanne Fear, will cover 12 states in 12 months, coast to coast, from Delaware to California, with the assistance of a support crew. Both riders are trainers who have taken part in the Mustang Heritage Foundation Trainer Incentive Program (TIP). Hannah travels the world as a Mustang Ambassador and trainer doing “Wild Horse Workshops” & Liberty Training Clinics.\n\nThey rode out from Delaware’s historic Cape Henlopen State Park on September 28, 2021, to a beautiful rendition of the National Anthem sung by the Chattanooga Girls Leadership Academy Choir from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Working with the Academy’s co-founder, Dr. Sue Anne Wells, the Mustang Leadership Partners provide Mustangs for the school’s equine program. For the past six years, girls from the program have been part of the EQUUS Film & Arts Fest with a series of “Mustang” themed music videos. This year’s entry is a moving piece called “Go Change the World” written by Dr. Sue Anne Wells.\n\nFrom Delaware, the riders headed west through Maryland, helping to celebrate the State’s “Horse Month” as proclaimed by Governor, Larry Hogan. While there, the team worked with Ross Peddicord of the Maryland Horse Industry Board and the Maryland Horse Council. Then, the riders headed West into the Washington, D.C. area on October 12, 2021 to bring awareness to the American Discovery Trail and the HR4878 National Discovery Trail Act currently before Congress.\n\nAlso on October 12, Meadowbrook Stables, the oldest urban riding school in the United States, hosted a “Meet the Mustangs” event. The team was also joined by Operation Wild Horse Veterans’ Program founders and directors Jim Welch and Patti Gruber to ride through Rock Creek Park to the National Mall and then back to Meadowbrook Stables.\n\nNext, onto Mt. Airy, Maryland for a stop at Paradise Stables on October 14 to host a “secret” Mustang documentary film premiere (opening Nationwide October 15) with local Mustang eventer and SBF Mustang Eventing owner, Ann Hanlin. Paradise Stables will also host a “Meet the Mustangs” event that weekend. Both events are in partnership with the Maryland Horse Council. The riders will complete their time in Maryland at a “Wild Horse Workshop & Liberty Training Clinic” hosted by, Patricia Milligan, founder of Fox Lea Mini Horse Rescue and host of the Tiny Horse Talk Podcast.\n\nThe next month of their adventure leads into West Virginia, and from there, further west until the weather gets too extreme and the footing dangerous. When the weather puts the journey on hold, the team will spend their time conducting trainings and hosting clinics. As the weather improves, the ride will continue west into 2022. The EQUUS Film Fest will post monthly AHP updates for locations and events in each state along the route. And throughout it all, Lisanne will journal their adventures, so stay tuned for more stories from the Mustang riders on the American Discovery Trail!\n\nOthers are invited to join the ride as the team travels across the country.\n\nCan’t join the ride? Join on social media:\n\n@mustangdiscovery on Instagram\n\n@mustangdiscoveryride on Facebook\n\n#5000miles5000mustangs, #mustang_discovery_ride, #discoverblk, #equusfilmfest, #equustv\n\nThere will also be a weekly docu-series podcast and documentary created as the journey progresses. A team of photojournalists and videographers are joining the trip, each giving their own creative perspective on the ride. The team is also working with EQUUS TV to provide coverage and updates on the ride. Field correspondent, Jacqueline Taylor, is covering the coast-to-coast journey.\n\nEQUUS Film & Arts Fest is partnering with the Mustang Discovery Ride to bring this story to the world as part of the EQUUS Equine Enrichment Program. Joining Mustang Leadership Partners and the Chattanooga Girls Leadership Academy, they will bring this journey into the classroom and beyond. Plans are underway to Zoom the coverage into classrooms in the US, India, and Mongolia, with more locations added as the program expands.\n\nEQUUS Film Fest will provide home-based support and management. J A Media Productions, Julianne Neal, will assist the team on the development of the documentary, podcast, and docu-series.\n\nSave the dates! EQUUS Film & Arts Fest 2021 will take place LIVE and VIRTUALLLY on November 12 – 21, with a special Thanksgiving weekend event.
