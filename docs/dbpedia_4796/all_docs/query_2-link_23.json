        "text": "A View of Pre-Contact History: A Turning Point in Time\n\nHEIAU/PIKO/FLAGSTAFF\n\nFrom Cook’s arrival in 1778 and before, this structure was sett back upon a grassy knoll which, when magnified showed the stone structure of what descendant, Aunty Aletha consistently referred to as a heiau & piko. The subject of how and when it became a modern adapted flagstaff is interesting with various cultural perspectives and uses.\n\nKing Kaumualiʻi was one of the first Mōʻī born into the expanding world with foreign arrivals to Hawaiiʻs shores. As Mōʻī, like those before him, one of his responsibilities was to maintain traditional cultural practices and protocols, while incorporating innovation. We know through chants that lepa/kalepa, (flags) made of tapa tied on a stick were used to designate a KAPU, (off limits) area. Aunty Aletha and other practitioners still use these at ceremonial sites today. More about the modern adaptation below, when foreign captains: American, English, Russian and others expanded the practice with Kaumualiʻi as a way of greeting and communication with what country/ship was visiting.\n\nWhen Cook arrived, he was greeted by Chiefess Kamakahelei and husband, Kaʻeokulani, brother of Maui King Kahekili. Vancouver, on this journey would visit later several times as captain of his own ship and recognized in the young heir apparent, Kaumualiʻi , an intelligence and curiosity that would greatly serve him as King in a changing world.\n\nFrom Aunty Aletha Kaohi”s Collection of Storyboards at the West Kauai Heritage Center, Waimea, Kauai. https://www.westkauaivisitorcenter.org/\n\nThere are many perspectives as to why Kauaʻi was never conquered or ravaged, as happened to other islands when conquered by Kamehameha and united under one King & Kingdom. You will find perspectives, related facts, evidence in stories throughout this website and elsewhere. The final fact was, that a Peace Treaty was signed in 1810 attesting to the agreement wherein Kaumualiʻi would continue to rule independently a Tributary Monarch, and upon his death would pass his reign to (our)/Kamehamehaʻs son, Lioliho- but not the personal property of King and chiefs.\n\nDespite several trials, threats, non-compliance of terms, (whatever exactly they were); this agreement was honored and never broken until after the deaths of Kamehameha and Kaumualiʻi. Besides, the weather, plague, vow of Peace from Kukonʻaʻs time strong prayers/powers that Kamakahelei possessed and passed on, what else was an aspect of that destiny?\n\nIt is often said that Kamehameha became less inclined toward war in his older years; remember the Law of the Splintered Paddle? And Kaumualiʻi always chose Peace, as did his Mother, Chiefess Kamakahelei, who raised him. Unlike Kamehameha and others; his godly patron was not Ku, or Kukailimoku, the warrior; but he was more aligned with Lono, champion of Agriculture, peace and prosperity.\n\nHaving seen a digital, typed copy of certification relating to the Peace Treaty of 1810, it seemed surprisingly genteel and accommodating, rather than restrictive, perhaps due to the foreigners involved in composition- nonetheless, quite mild. It read something to the effect:\n\n1.Certifies-By earnest request of King Tamoomao and particular desire of King Tamoree, I,(John Winship) brought Kaumualiʻi with chiefs family& friends to the current residence of King Kamehameha to settle a long dispute and end all war and commotion in the islands.\n\n2. They were politely received and entertained, and differeneces were mutually and amicably adjusted between both Kings.\n\n3. Tamoomao promises never to visit or invade Atooi or Onehow with military or hostile intentions and also promises to exert himself if necessary to maintain Tamoree on the islands of Atooi & Onehow if necessary.\n\n4. Witnessed: Thomas Robinson Signed Jonn Winship, Francis de Paula Marin Singed Tameamea (his mark)\n\nSigned sealed and delivered in presence of Thomas Robinson, Francis de Paula Marin. March 20, 1819,\n\nAmerican Alliances support Kaumualiʻi as an Independent Monarch and Trade Partner\n\nFrom as early as 1814, during the tenure of American shipping friends, the heiau/flaggstaff and significance was expanded to bear flags of visiting ships, and was centrally located fronting at least 3 hale for King Kaumuali’i and storage houses for American traders from the ship, Atahualpa. Some of the crew was left behind on Kauaʻi to guard the skins in hale built by kanaka, directed by Kaumualiʻi. They had an up close and personal view of interactions and left a shipʻs log telling many tales of personal and political intrigue. Depending on cultural perspective, different interpretations may be imagined. Danger lurked as British warships were prowling the waters between islands ready to capture American ships during and after the war of 1812. Rumors of shifting alliances among Kaumualiʻiʻs chiefs were worrisome; and word spread of the threat of Kamehameha readying for an attack on Kauaʻi, since recent tribute had not been paid. All of this cast an air of concern and imminent danger in the tumultuous waters around Kauaʻi.\n\nSELECTED ATAHUALPA LOG NOTES\n\nJournal of Residence, Waimea, Kauai-1814-Listed as Ship Log of the Atahualpa. (Anonymous)\n\nTues 8th Feb–…Erected a Flag staff in front of the House for the purpose of displaying the Flag which his [donors?] presented him with (the King) as a token of Respect for his full & faithful adherence to his engagements & for his friendship & protection which he has shown for Americans at this place.\n\nWed. 9th Feb-…At 9 am saw a ship to the Windward part of the Islands which proved to be the Charon Capt. Isaac Whittemore last from the coast of California. Capt. W. informed us that it was reported at that place, that a Negotiation between America & Gt. Britain was about taking place, he also confirmed the account of the capture of the Ship Mercury by Don Nicolass commander of the Flora, that the Mercury was armed by the Spaniards & intended for to cruise for smugglers on that coast.\n\nThurs 10th...Sent a man to the King to inform him that they made but very little progress on the Houses & requesting him to send more men.\n\nFri 11th-…At 10 am one of the Kings men arrived with orders for all the men in the place to assist in building the Houses.\n\nSat 12th-…Capt. Whittemore on shore about 90 Kannackers at work upon the Houses.\n\nSun 13th-10am the King & suite arrived at 3pm went on board of the Ship Charon, rec’d a salute of 3 guns.\n\nMon 14th-…rec’d a visit from the King and prime Minister.\n\nSat 19th- The natives employ’d bringing down Sandal Wood to go on board the Pennsylvania Packet which is bound for China- Capt. Whittemore landed his Furs & stored them in my Houses.\n\nSun 1st April– This day a council of war was held at the House (at which all the nobility attended) for the purpose of adopting some effectual means, for the present & Future safety of this Island from the invasion of Tamahamaah King of Owhyhee. The plan adopted was to send all the men from this Island which belonged to the Windward Islands & to keep themselves in constant readiness for defense. Capts. Davis, Winship & Whittemore at the same time proffered their friendship & protection as far as lay in their powers, at all times. Thinking it not only requisite for the safety of their property, but Justice to Tamaree, the King for his friendly disposition & protection for Americans.\n\nTues 16th-…The Natives employed in building a stone store House for the King.\n\nWeds 17th-…Last night there was an attempt made by some incendiary to set fire to the King’s House but fortunately was discovered but made his escape before the man on Guard to obtain assistance. Strong suspicions are entertained that the prime Minister was accessory to the plan which should it be the case I am in hopes that he will be removed from office as there is no doubt but this Man is friendly displaced towards Tamahamaha King of the Windward Islands & hopes by his unremitted attention, to gain that ascendancy over this King that shall enable him to bring Tamaree into subjection to Tamahaamaha which however he will not be able to effect so long as American Ships remain about the Islands as they at all times will protect him against any invasion which may be attempted by the King of the Other Isles.\n\nTues 15th June-…At 6PM we were inofrme’d by a friendly native of this place that during the Night it was intended by a band of Tamahawnalany’s, the head chief, to set-fire to our houses & in the confusion for them to single out their Victim & put to Death evry white man belonging to the House, but we are in hopes from our timely information of this to be able to adopt some plan which will prevent the execution of this plan for a few days in which time the Ship Charon will be able to get to this place from which we may expect evry protection. We were also informed That a great proportion of the Natives of this place were disaffected to the King & it is now evident that the stratagem which has been carried on by Tamahamaah King of Owhyhee through the head chief, upon the King, will have this desired effect of bringing this Island in subjection to him. Through the night kept a guard of Six men about the House.\n\nMon 7thFeb …The Natives hauled the Seine & caught about 50 Fish of different kinds.\n\nTues 8 March-The Natives hauled the Seine caught about 5000 Fish of different kinds\n\nSun 13th- The natives hauled the Seine caught about 3 Barrels of Fish of different kinds.\n\nShortly thereafter, the ship, Atahualpa was purchased by the Russian American Co and renamed the Bering, which crashed on areef in Waimea Bay in Jan, 1815.\n\nFor further reading on this topic, see: A New Vie of Kauaʻi as “Separate Kingdom”. https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/5014585.pdf\n\nIn 1816-17, Schaeffer & Russian interests arrived back in Hawaii to reclaim salvage from the Bering and establish friendly trade & provisioning relationships. He spent the first several months trying to woo King Kamehameha and his man John Olomana Young, eventually receiving access through the intercession of Queens Kaʻahumau and Keopulani. After gaining permission to build a storehouse in Honolulu, he soon broke the three kapus imposed by the King and was chased off the island and headed for Kauaʻi, hoping to have more success. Once on Kauaʻi, Schaeffer acting without authority from Tzar Alexander or Gov Baranov and attempted to take control under the guise as a “protectorate alliance”. This may have tempted Kaumualiʻi who was concerned by the possibility of an attack from Kamehameha. However, Schaefer was not able to get Russian/RAC support for ships and amunition promised the King, for exclusive sandalwood trade and true colors and personal motives became apparent.\n\nHe did however, design the new fort in a Italienette(not russian) style, and oversaw the initial layout. The heiʻau/piko/flagstaff would become central within the fort walls, as the structure and purpose expanded to welcome and include foreign ideas and dignitaries.\n\nKing Kaumualiʻi and his chiefs directed the construction from Sept 1816 to itʻs completion with at least 1000 Kanaka, including approximately 300 womeen and three Queens who wished to add their mana to new structure which would serve as the Hawaiian political, commercial and community center for Kauaʻi. Below, Queen Kekaihaʻakulou, (Deborah Kupule) gives honi to Schaeffer for his design and direction of new structure while two attending koa stand guard.\n\nArtwork: Brook Parker; hawaiianatart.org.\n\nSchaeffer was expelled from Kaua’i a year after his arrival by both Kings: Kaumuali’i & Kamehameha in a leaky ship which sunk in Honolulu harbor on July 4, 1817. He escaped to Canton on another ship, eventually returning to Sitka and Russia. He made a vainglorious attempt, motivated by personal greed to gain support for the alliance/protectorate/rulership- (coup) on Kauaʻi with Tzar Alexander in Russia, and also Governor Baranov, RAC-Sitka who sent him only to retrieve salvage and make friendly trading relations. He was utterly disavowed by Tzar Alexander, who refused to see Schaeffer. Baranov sent him a more friendly response in a letter received in February, telling him it was not the right timing; and he should leave Kauaʻi immediately. Baranov later followed up with a letter of apology to King Kamehameha for the trouble Schaeffer created in overstepping his bounds.\n\nExcerpt of translated letter dated receipt Fe. 1817 fromGov.Baranov to George Schaeffer on Kauaʻi.\n\n“…But all my experience here in the Pacific tells me notto sanction your attempt to transfer our Company’s long relationship of alliance with King Kamehameha to his Kauaian tributary, Kaumuali’i. I know that Kamehameha is the greater man. He has the greater power there and he will triumph in the struggle of wills. He is, I know buying all the sailing ships he can, so that the addition of the Avon to Kaumuali’i’s fleet will inevitably be of consequence only to our pocketbook. That is why I will not allow your purchase of it. I can only hope that you have not by now so aggravated Kamehameha by your support of his tributary that he becomes hardened against us either as a Russian company or as a Russian nation… Kamehameha has seperately communicated to me that he considers you to have overatepped your instructions from me– which is true, and that he does not blame me in this. And indeed I forgive you for overstepping your instructions, having heard the story of your time there from people who know it well. My sincere advice to you is to leave Kaua’i as soon as you receive this letter, avoiding any contact with Kamehameha or his chiefs or his American trading partners.\n\nLocal villagers and Missionary reports confirmed that Kaumualiʻi built and ruled the Hawaiian Fort; a Russian trader who made repeated stops on Kauai, attested to the same. Dr. Mills also strongly supports this fact based on absolutely no archaeological evidence of anything Russian being found anywhere at the site.\n\nFort Construction, Changes and Improvements"
