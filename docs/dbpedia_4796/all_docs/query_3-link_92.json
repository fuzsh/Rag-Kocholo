These classes will be held separate from the US National Halter Futurity classes and will be adjudicated by a separate panel of judges. Be sure to renominate your horse(s) in the Canadian National Halter Futurity Program so they will be eligible to be shown in 2024.\n\nHALTER FUTURITY RENOMINATIONS\n\nHalter Futurity Renominations must be postmarked/electronic transaction dated by December 31, 2023. Horses that have not been renominated for 2023 are postmarked/electronic transaction dated after December 31st and by March 31st will be assessed a $100 late fee per horse/per country.\n\nYou can renew on-line or by submitting the completed form with payment to AHA via fax, US Mail or email (pdf format) to info.comp@arabianhorses.org You may also contact the AHA office at 303-696-4500, option 1 and renew over the phone.\n\nClick here for instructions on how to renew online.\n\nHorses that are not renominated in the US and/or Canadian Halter Futurity are automatically dropped from the program. However, horses can be reinstated by paying the appropriate fees.\n\nHorses that are not reinstated into the program by the original close of entries for that show will be notified and will be given seven (7) days to buy back into the program. Horses that are not reinstated within the seven (7) days of notification of payment for reinstatement will remain dropped from the Halter Futurity Program. The horse will not be allowed to be reinstated into the program and will not be eligible to show in the Halter Futurity Class(es).\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL HALTER FUTURITY PROGRAM\n\nDue to the Canadian National Show being suspended indefinitely, it was determined that the Canadian Halter Futurity Program be suspended at this time. This program will be reviewed on an annual basis.\n\nThe 2024 Canadian Halter Futurity classes will be held at the 2024 US National Championship Show. These will be held as separate classes from the US National Halter Futurity Classes and adjudicated by a separate panel of judges."
