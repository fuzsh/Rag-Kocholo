        "text": "The story of Pele and her sister Hiiaka stands at the fountain-head of Hawaiian myth and is the matrix from which the unwritten literature of Hawaii drew its life-blood. The material for the elaboration of this story has, in part, been found in serial contributions to the Hawaiian newspapers during the last few decades; in part, gathered by interviews with the men and women of the older regime, in whose memory it has been stored and, again, in part, it has been supplied by papers solicited from intelligent Hawaiians. The information contained in the notes has been extracted by viva voce appeal to Hawaiians themselves. These last two sources of information will soon be no longer available.\n\nMerely as a story, this myth of Pele and her kindred may be deemed to have no compelling merit that should attract one to its reading. The cycle of world-myth already gathered from the rising to the setting of the sun, from the north pole to the south pole, is quite vast enough, and far in excess of the power of any one scholar to master and digest. It contains enough pretty stories, in all conscience, to satisfy the demands of the whole raft of storiologists and penny-a-liners, ever on the alert to cram the public with new sensations, without making it necessary to levy upon Hawaii for her little contribution.\n\nIt is not from a disposition to pander to any such appetite that the writer has drudged through many long years in collecting and giving literary shape to the material herein presented. The people who settled the Hawaiian group of islands are recognized as having occupied a unique station, one so far removed from the center and vortex of Polynesian activity as to enable them to cast a highly important side-light on many of the problems yet unsolved, that are of interest to ethnologists and philologists and that still enshroud the Polynesian race.\n\nHawaii rejoiced in a Kamehameha, who, with a strong hand, welded its discordant political elements into one body and made of it a nation. But it was denied a Homer capable of voicing its greatest epic in one song. The myth of the volcanic queen, like every other important Hawaiian myth, has been handled by many poets and raconteurs, each from his own point of view, influenced, no doubt, by local environment; but there never stood [VI]forth one singer with the supreme power to symphonize the jarring notes and combine them into one concordant whole. This fact is a tribute to the independent attitude of Hawaii’s geographical units as well as to its scattered minstrelsy.\n\nThis book does not offer itself as a complete history of Pele; it does not even assume to present all the oli, mele, and pule that deal with the great name of Pele. There were important events in her life that will receive but incidental mention. Of such is the story of Pele’s relations with the swine-god Kama-pua’a. As indicated in the title, the author confines his attention almost wholly to the story of Pele’s relations with Prince Lohiau of Haena, in which the girl Hiiaka became involved as an accessory.\n\nIt was inevitable that such a myth as that of Pele should draw to it and, like an ocean-reef, become the stranding ground of a great mass of flotsam and jetsam poetry and story. Especially was this true of those passional fragments of Hawaiian mele and oli, which, without this, would not easily have found a concrete object to which they might attach themselves.\n\nIt matters not whether the poet-philosopher, deep pondering on the hot things of love, hit upon Pele as the most striking and appropriate character to serve his purpose and to wear his garment of passionate song and story, or, whether his mind, working more objectively, took Nature’s suggestion and came to realize that, in the wild play of the volcanic forces, he had exemplified before him a mighty parable of tempestuous love. Certain it is that the volcano was antecedent to the poet and his musings, and it seems more reasonable to suppose that from it came the first suggestion and that his mind, as by a flash of inspiration, began its subjective work as the result of what he saw going on before his eyes.\n\nThe Hawaiian to whose memory was committed the keeping of an old time mele regarded it as a sacred trust, to be transmitted in its integrity; and he was inclined to look upon every different and contradictory version of that mele as, in a sense, an infringement of his preserve, a desecration of that sacred thing which had been entrusted to him. It resulted from this that such a thing as a company of haku-mele (poets or song-makers) conferring together for the purpose of settling upon one authoritative version of a historic mele was an impossibility.\n\nIt is a misfortune when the myth-cycle of any people or country is invaded for exploitation by that class of writers whose sole object is to pander, or cater—to use a softer term—to the public [VII]taste for novelty and sensation, before that cycle has been canvassed and reported upon by students who approach it in a truthful yet sympathetic spirit. In other words: plain exposition should come before sensational exploitation. To reverse the order would be as undesirable as to have Münchausen gain the ear of the public before Mungo Park, Livingston, Stanley, Cook, or Vancouver had blazed the way and taken their observations.\n\nFortunately for Hawaii, the spirit of the times has set its face like a flint against this sort of sensation-mongering, and if a Münchausen were now to claim the public ear he would have the searchlight of scientific investigation turned upon him as pitilessly as it was done in the case of an alleged claim to the discovery of the north pole.\n\nIt is a satisfaction to the author, after having accomplished his pioneer work of opening up a new domain, to bid the public enter in and enjoy the delicious lehua parks once claimed by the girl Hiiaka as her own; and he can assure them that there yet remain many coverts that are full of charm which are to this day unravaged by the fires of Pele.\n\nThanks, many thanks, are due from the author—and from us all—to the men and women of Hawaiian birth whose tenacious memories have served as the custodians of the material herein set forth, but who have ungrudgingly made us welcome to these remainder biscuits of mythological song and story, which, but for them, would have been swallowed up in the grave, unvoiced and unrecorded.\n\nN. B. EMERSON. [IX]\n\nAccording to Hawaiian myth, Pele, the volcanic fire-queen and the chief architect of the Hawaiian group, was a foreigner, born in the mystical land of Kuai-he-lani, a land not rooted and anchored to one spot, but that floated free like the Fata Morgana, and that showed itself at times to the eyes of mystics, poets and seers, a garden land, clad with the living glory of trees and habitations—a vision to warm the imagination. The region was known as Kahiki (Kukulu o Kahiki), a name that connotes Java and that is associated with the Asiatic cradle of the Polynesian race.\n\nPele’s mother was Haumea, a name that crops up as an ancestor in the hoary antiquity of the Hawaiian people, and she was reputed to be the daughter of Kane-hoa-lani.\n\nPele was ambitious from childhood and from the earliest age made it her practice to stick close to her mother’s fireplace in company with the fire-keeper Lono-makua, ever watchful of his actions, studious of his methods—an apprenticeship well fitted to serve her in good stead such time as she was to become Hawaii’s volcanic fire-queen. This conduct drew upon Pele the suspicion and illwill of her elder sister Na-maka-o-ka-ha’i, a sea-goddess, who, fathoming the latent ambition of Pele, could not fail to perceive that its attainment would result in great commotion and disturbance in their home-land.\n\nHer fears and prognostications proved true. Namaka, returning from one of her expeditions across the sea, found that Pele, taking advantage of her absence, had erupted a fiery deluge and smothered a portion of the home-land with aä.\n\nIt would have gone hard with Pele; but mother Haumea bade her take refuge in the fold (pola) of Ka-moho-alii’s malo. Now this elder brother of Pele was a deity of great power and authority, a terrible character, hedged about with tabus that restricted and made difficult the approach of his enemies. Such a refuge could only be temporary, and safety was to be assured only by Pele’s removal from her home in the South land, and that meant flight. It was accomplished in the famed mythical canoe Honua-i-a-kea.\n\nThe company was a distinguished one, including such godlike beings as Ka-moho-alii, Kane-apua, Kane-milo-hai and many [X]other relations of Pele, the youngest, but not the least important, of whom was the girl Hiiaka, destined to be the heroine of the story here unfolded and of whom it was said that she was born into the world as a clot of blood out of the posterior fontanelle (nunoi) of her mother Haumea, the other sisters having been delivered through the natural passage.\n\nThe sailing course taken by Pele’s company brought them to some point northwest of Hawaii, along that line of islets, reefs, and shoals which tail off from Hawaii as does the train of a comet from its nucleus. At Moku-papápa Pele located her brother Kane-milo-hai, as if to hold the place for her or to build it up into fitness for human residence, for it was little more than a reef. Her next stop was at the little rock of Nihoa that lifts its head some eight hundred feet above the ocean. Here she made trial with the divining rod Paoa, but the result being unfavorable, she passed on to the insignificant islet of Lehua which clings like a limpet to the flank of Niihau. In spite of its smallness and unfitness for residence, Pele was moved to crown the rock with a wreath of kau-no’a, while Hiiaka contributed a chaplet of lehua which she took from her own neck, thus christening it for all time. The poet details the itinerary of the voyage in the following graphic lines:\n\nKe Kaao a Pele i Haawi ia Ka-moho-alii i ka Haalele ana ia Kahiki\n\nKu makou e hele me ku’u mau poki’i aloha,\n\nKa aina a makou i ike ole ai malalo aku nei,\n\nA’e makou me ku’u poki’i, kau i ka wa’a;\n\nNo’iau ka hoe a Ka-moho-alii;\n\nA’ea’e, kau i ka nalu—\n\nHe nalu haki kakala,\n\nHe nalu e imi ana i ka aina e hiki aku ai.\n\nO Nihoa ka aina a makou i pae mua aku ai:\n\nLele a’e nei makou, kau i uka o Nihoa.\n\nO ka hana no a ko’u poki’i, a Kane-apua,\n\nO ka hooili i ka ihu o ka wa’a a nou i ke kai:\n\nWaiho anei o Ka-moho-alii ia Kane-apua i uka o Nihoa.\n\nNo’iau ka hoe a Ka-moho-alii\n\nA pae i ka aina i kapa ia o Lehua.\n\n[XI]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nPele’s Account to Ka-moho-alii of the Departure from Kahiki\n\nWe stood to sail with my kindred beloved\n\nTo an unknown land below the horizon;\n\nWe boarded—my kinsmen and I—our craft,\n\nOur pilot well skilled, Ka-moho-alii.\n\nOur craft o’ermounted and mastered the waves;\n\nThe sea was rough and choppy, but the waves\n\nBore us surely on to our destined shore—\n\nThe rock Nihoa, the first land we touched;\n\nGladly we landed and climbed up its cliffs.\n\nFault of the youngster, Kane-apua,\n\nHe loaded the bow till it ducked in the waves;\n\nKa-moho-alii marooned the lad,\n\nLeft the boy on the islet Nihoa\n\nAnd, pilot well skilled, he sailed away\n\nTill we found the land we christened Lehua.\n\nWhen they had crowned the desolate rock with song and wreath, Ka-moho-alii would have steered for Niihau, but Pele, in a spasm of tenderness that smiles like an oasis in her life, exclaimed, “How I pity our little brother who journeyed with us till now!” At this Ka-moho-alii turned the prow of the canoe in the direction of Nihoa and they rescued Kane-apua from his seagirt prison. Let the poet tell the story:\n\nHui1 iho nei ka wa’a a Ka-moho-alii\n\nE kii ana i ko lakou pokii, ia Kane-apua, i Nihoa.\n\nPili aku nei ka wa’a o Ka-moho-alii i uka nei o Nihoa,\n\nKahea aku nei i ko lakou pokii, ia Kane-apua,\n\nE kau aku ma ka pola o ka wa’a.\n\nHui iho nei ka ihu o ka wa’a o Ka-moho-alii—\n\nHe wa’a e holo ana i Niihau,\n\nKau aku nei o Ka-moho-alii i ka laau, he paoa,2 [XII]\n\nE imi ana i ko lakou aina e noho ai, o Kauai:\n\nAole na’e i loa’a.\n\nKau mai la o Ka-moho-alii i ka laau, he paoa;\n\nO Ahu3 ka aina.\n\nIa ka ana iho nei o lakou i Alia-pa’akai,\n\nAole na’e he aina.\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nKa-moho-alii turned his canoe\n\nTo rescue lad Kane from Nihoa.\n\nAnon the craft lies off Nihoa’s coast;\n\nThey shout to the lad, to Kane-apua,\n\nCome aboard, rest with us on the pola.4\n\nKa-moho-alii turns now his prow,\n\nHe will steer for the fertile Niihau.\n\nHe sets out the wizard staff Paoa,\n\nTo test if Kauai’s to be their home;\n\nBut they found it not there.\n\nOnce more the captain sails on with the rod,\n\nTo try if Oahu’s the wished for land:\n\nThey thrust in the staff at Salt Lake Crater,\n\nBut that proved not the land of their promise.\n\nArrived at Oahu, Ka-moho-alii, who still had Pele in his keeping, left the canoe in charge of Holoholo-kai and, with the rest of the party, continued the journey by land. The witchery of the Paoa was appealed to from time to time, as at Alia-pa’akai, Puowaena (Punchbowl Hill), Leahi (Diamond Head), and lastly at Makapu’u Point, but nowhere with a satisfactory response. (The words of Pele in the second verse of the kaao next to be given lead one to infer that she must for a time have entertained the thought that they had found the desired haven at Pele-ula—a small land-division within the limits of the present city of Honolulu.) Let the poet tell the story:\n\nKe ku nei makou e imi kahi e noho ai\n\nA loa’a ma Pele-ula:\n\nO Kapo-ula-kina’u ka wahine; [XIII]\n\nA loa’a i ka lae kapu o Maka-pu’u.\n\nIlaila pau ke kuleana;\n\nImi ia Kane-hoa-lani,\n\nA loa’a i ka lae o Maka-hana-loa.—\n\nHe loa ka uka o Puna:\n\nElua kaua i ke kapa hookahi.\n\nAkahi au a ike—haupu mau, walohia wale:\n\nE Kane-hoa-lani, e-e!\n\nE Kane-hoa-lani, e-e!\n\nAloha kaua!\n\nKau ka hokú hookahi, hele i ke ala loa!\n\nAloha kama kuku kapa a ka wahine!\n\nHe wahine lohiau, naná i ka makani;\n\nHe makani lohiau, haupu mai oloko!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nWe went to seek for a biding place,\n\nAnd found it, we thought, in Pele-ula—\n\nDame Kapo—she of the red-pied robe—\n\nFound it in the sacred cape, Maka-pu’u;\n\nThe limit that of our journey by land.\n\nWe looked then for Kane-hoa-lani\n\nAnd found him at Maka-hana-loa.\n\nFar away are the uplands of Puna;\n\nOne girdle still serves for you and for me.\n\nNever till now such yearning, such sadness!\n\nWhere art thou, Kane-hoa-lani?\n\nO Father Kane, where art thou?\n\nHail to thee, O Father, and hail to me!\n\nWhen rose the pilot-star we sailed away.\n\nHail, girl who beats out tapa for women—\n\nThe home-coming wife who watches the wind,\n\nThe haunting wind that searches the house!\n\nThe survey of Oahu completed, and Ka-moho-alii having resumed command of the canoe, Pele uttered her farewell and they voyaged on to the cluster of islands of which Maui is the center:\n\nAloha, Oahu, e-e!\n\nE huli ana makou i ka aina mamua aku,\n\nKahi a makou e noho ai.\n\n[XIV]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nFarewell to thee, Oahu!\n\nWe press on to lands beyond,\n\nIn search of a homing place.\n\nRepeated trial with the divining rod, Paoa, made on the western part of Maui as well as on the adjoining islands of Molokai and Lanai proving unsatisfactory, Pele moved on to the exploration of the noble form of Hale-a-ka-la that domes East Maui, with fine hope and promise of success. But here again she was dissatisfied with the result. She had not yet delivered herself from the necessity of protection by her kinsman, Ka-moho-alii: “One girdle yet serves for you and for me,” was the note that still rang out as a confession of dependence, in her song.\n\nWhile Pele was engaged in her operations in the crater of Hale-a-ka-la, her inveterate enemy Na-maka-o-ka-ha’i, who had trailed her all the way from Kahiki with the persistency of a sea-wolf, appeared in the offing, accompanied by a sea-dragon named Ha-ui.\n\nThe story relates that, as Na-maka-o-ka-ha’i passed the sand-spit of Moku-papápa, Kane-milo-hai, who, it will be remembered, had been left there in charge as the agent of Pele, hailed her with the question: “Where are you going so fast?”\n\n“To destroy my enemy, to destroy Pele,” was her answer.\n\n“Return to Kahiki, lest you yourself be destroyed,” was the advice of Kane-milo-hai.\n\nPele, accepting the gage thrown down by Na-maka-o-ka-ha’i, with the reluctant consent of her guardian Ka-moho-alii, went into battle single-handed. The contest was terrific. The sea-monster, aided by her dragon consort, was seemingly victorious. Dismembered parts of Pele’s body were cast up at Kahiki-nui, where they are still pointed out as the bones of Pele (na iwi o Pele.) (She was only bruised). Ka-moho-alii was dismayed thinking Pele to have been destroyed;—but, looking across the Ale-nui-haha channel, he saw the spirit-form of Pele flaming in the heavens above the summits of Mauna-loa and Mauna-kea. As for Na-maka-o-ka-ha’i, she retired from the battle exultant, thinking that her enemy Pele was done for: but when she reported her victory to Kane-milo-hai, that friend of Pele pointed to the spirit body of Pele glowing in the heavens as proof that she was mistaken. Namaka was enraged at the sight and would [XV]have turned back to renew the conflict, but Kane-milo-hai dissuaded her from this foolhardy undertaking, saying, “She is invincible; she has become a spirit.”\n\nThe search for a home-site still went on. Even Hale-a-ka-la was not found to be acceptable to Pele’s fastidious taste. According to one account it proved to be so large that Pele found herself unable to keep it warm. Pele, a goddess now, accordingly bade adieu to Maui and its clustering isles and moved on to Hawaii.\n\nHe Kaao na Pele, i Haalele ai ia Maui\n\nAloha o Maui, aloha, e!\n\nAloha o Moloka’i, aloha, e!\n\nAloha o Lana’i, aloha, e!\n\nAloha o Kaho’olawe, aloha, e!\n\nKu makou e hele, e!\n\nO Hawaii ka ka aina\n\nA makou e noho ai a mau loa aku;\n\nKe ala ho’i a makou i hiki mai ai,\n\nHe ala paoa ole ko Ka-moho-alii,\n\nKo Pele, ko Kane-milo-hai, ko Kane-apua,\n\nKo Hiiaka—ka no’iau—i ka poli o Pele,\n\nI hiki mai ai.\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nPele’s Farewell to Maui\n\nFarewell to thee, Maui, farewell!\n\nFarewell to thee, Moloka’i, farewell!\n\nFarewell to thee, Lana’i, farewell!\n\nFarewell to thee, Kaho’olawe, farewell!\n\nWe stand all girded for travel:\n\nHawaii, it seems, is the land\n\nOn which we shall dwell evermore.\n\nThe route by which we came hither\n\nTouched lands not the choice of Paoa;—\n\n’Twas the route of Ka-moho-alii,\n\nOf Pele and Kane-milo-hai,\n\nRoute traveled by Kane-apua, and by\n\nHiiaka, the wise, the darling of Pele.\n\nPele and her company landed on Hawaii at Pua-kó, a desolate [XVI]spot between Kawaihae and Kailua. Thence they journeyed inland until they came to a place which they named Moku-aweo-weo—not the site of the present crater of that name, but—situated where yawns the vast caldera of Kilauea. It was at the suggestion of Ku-moku-halii and Keawe-nui-kau of Hilo that the name was conferred. They also gave the name Mauna-loa to the mountain mass that faced them on the west, “because,” said they, “our journey was long.”\n\nNight fell and they slept. In the morning, when the elepaio uttered its note, they rose and used the Paoa staff. The omens were favorable, and Pele decided that this was the place for her to establish a permanent home.\n\nThe people immediately began to set out many plants valuable for food; among them a variety of kalo called aweü, well suited for upland growth; the ulu (bread-fruit); the maiä (banana); the pala-á (an edible fern); the awa (Piper methysticum) and other useful plants.\n\nThe land on the Hilo side of Kilauea, being in the rain belt, is fertile and well fitted for tillage. The statement, however, that Kilauea, or its vicinity, became the place of settlement for any considerable number of people cannot be taken literally. The climatic conditions about Kilauea are too harsh and untropical to allow either the people or the food plants of Polynesia to feel at home in it. The probability is that instead of being gathered about Kilauea, they made their homes in the fat lands of lower Puna or Hilo.\n\nPele, on her human side at least, was dependent for support and physical comfort upon the fruits of the earth and the climatic conditions that made up her environment. Yet with all this, in the narrative that follows her relations to humanity are of that exceptional character that straddle, as it were, that border line which separates the human from the superhuman, but for the most part occupy the region to the other side of that line, the region into which if men and women of this work-a-day world pass they find themselves uncertain whether the beings with whom they converse are bodied like themselves or made up of some insubstantial essence and liable to dissolve and vanish at the touch.\n\nTHE HOME OF PELE. KILAUEA IN ACTION.\n\nCopyright by R. K. Bonine.\n\n[1]\n\nOnce, when Pele was living in the pit of Kilauea, she roused up from her couch on the rough hearth-plate and said to her sisters, “Let us make an excursion to the ocean and enjoy ourselves, open the opihi shells and sea-urchins, hunt for small squid and gather sea-moss.”\n\nTo this all joyfully assented, saying, “Yes, let us go.”\n\nThe sisters formed quite a procession as they tramped the narrow downhill path until they came to the hill Pu’u-Pahoehoe—a place in the lower lands of Puna. Pele herself did not visibly accompany them on this journey; that was not according to her custom: she had other ways and means of travel than to plod along a dusty road. When, however, the party arrived at the rendezvous, there, sure enough, they found Pele awaiting them, ready for the business in hand.\n\nIn the midst of their pleasurings Pele caught sight of Hopoe and Haena as they were indulging in an al fresco dance and having a good time by the Puna sea. She was greatly pleased and, turning to her sisters, said, “Come, haven’t you also got some dance that you can show off in return for this entertainment by Hopoe and her companion?”\n\nThey all hung their heads and said, “We have no hula.”\n\nHiiaka, the youngest, had stayed behind to gather lehua flowers, and when she came along laden with wreaths, Pele said to her, jestingly, “I’ve just been proposing to your sisters here to dance a hula in response to that of Hopoe and her fellow, but they decline, saying they have not the art. I suppose it’s of no use to ask you, you are so small; but, perhaps, you’ve got a bit of a song.”\n\n“Yes, I have a song,” Hiiaka answered, to the surprise of all.\n\n“Let us have it, then; go on!” said Pele.\n\nThen the little girl, having first decorated all of her sisters with the wreaths, beginning with Pele, sang as follows:\n\nKe ha’a la Puna i ka makani;\n\nHa’a ka ulu hala i Keaau;\n\nHa’a Haena me Hopoe;\n\nHa’a ka wahine,\n\nAmi i kai o Nana-huki, la—\n\nHula le’a wale,\n\nI kai o Nana-huki, e-e!\n\n[2]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nPuna’s a-dance in the breeze,\n\nThe hala groves of Keaau shaken:\n\nHaena and Hopoe are swaying;\n\nThe thighs of the dancing nymph\n\nQuiver and sway, down at Nana-huki—\n\nA dance most sightly and pleasing,\n\nDown by the sea Nana-huki.\n\nPele was delighted. “Is that all you have?” she asked.\n\n“I have something more,” said the girl.\n\n“Let us hear it then.”\n\nHiiaka put even more spirit into the song as she complied:\n\nO Puna kai kuwá i ka hala;\n\nPae ka leo o ke kai;\n\nKe lu, la, i na pua lehua.\n\nNana i kai o Hopoe,\n\nKa wahine ami i kai\n\nO Nana-huki, la;\n\nHula le’a wale,\n\nI kai o Nana-huki, e-e.\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nThe voice of Puna’s sea resounds\n\nThrough the echoing hala groves;\n\nThe lehua trees cast their bloom.\n\nLook at the dancing girl Hopoe;\n\nHer graceful hips swing to and fro,\n\nA-dance on the beach Nana-huki:\n\nA dance that is full of delight,\n\nDown by the sea Nana-huki.\n\nAt the conclusion of this innocent performance—the earliest mention of the hula that has reached us—Hiiaka went to stay with her friend Hopoe, a person whose charm of character had fascinated the imagination of the susceptible girl and who had already become her dearest intimate, her inspiring mentor in those sister arts, song, poesy and the dance.\n\nPele herself remained with her sister Hiiaka-i-ka-pua-enaena (Hiiaka-of-the-fire-bloom), and presently she lay down to sleep [3]in a cave on a smooth plate of pahoehoe. Before she slept she gave her sister this command: “Listen to me. I am lying down to sleep; when the others return from fishing, eat of the fish, but don’t dare to wake me. Let me sleep on until I wake of myself. If one of you wakes me it will be the death of you all. If you must needs wake me, however, call my little sister and let her be the one to rouse me; or, if not her, let it be my brother Ke-o-wahi-maka-o-ka-ua—one of these two.”\n\nWhen Ke-o-wahi-maka-o-ka-ua, who was so closely related to Pele that she called him brother, had received this command and had seen her lapse into profound sleep he went and reported the matter to Hiiaka, retailing all that Pele had said. “Strange that this havoc-producer should sleep in this way, and no bed-fellow!” said Hiiaka to herself. “Here are all the other Hiiakas, all of equal rank and merit! Perhaps it was because my dancing pleased her that she wishes me to be the one to rouse her.”\n\nThe cavern in the hill Pahoehoe in which Pele lay and slept, wrapped in her robe (kapa-ahu), remains to this day.\n\nIn her sleep Pele heard the far-off beating of hula drums, and her spirit-body pursued the sound. At first it seemed to come from some point far out to sea; but as she followed, it shifted, moving to the north, till it seemed to be off the beach of Waiakea, in Hilo; thence it moved till it was opposite Lau-pahoehoe. Still evading her pursuit, the sound retreated till it came from the boisterous ocean that beats against the shaggy cliffs of Hamakua. Still going north, it seemed presently to have reached the mid channel of Ale-nui-haha that tosses between Hawaii and Maui.\n\n“If you are from my far-off home-land Kahiki, I will follow you thither, but I will come up with you,” said Pele.\n\nTo her detective ear, as she flitted across the heaving waters of Ale-nui-haha, the pulsing of the drums now located itself at the famous hill Kauwiki, in Hana; but, on reaching that place, the music had passed on to the west and sounded from the cliffs of Ka-haku-loa.\n\nThe fugitive music led her next across another channel, until in her flight she had traversed the length of Moloka’i and had come to the western point of that island, Lae-o-ka-laau. Thence she flew to cape Maka-pu’u, on Oahu, and so on, until, after crossing that island, she reached cape Kaena, whose finger-point reaches out towards Kaua’i. In that desolate spot dwelt an aged creature of myth, Pohaku-o-Kaua’i by name, the personal representative of that rock whose body-form the hero Mawi [4]had jerked from its ocean bed ages before, in his futile attempt to draw together the two islands Kaua’i and Oahu and unite them into one mass.\n\nPele, arguing from her exasperation, said, “It must be my old grandfather Pohaku-o-Kaua’i who is playing this trick with the music. If it’s he that’s leading me this chase, I’ll kill him.”\n\nThe old fellow saw her approach and, hailing her from a distance, greeted her most heartily. Her answer was in a surly mood: “Come here! I’m going to kill you to-day. So it’s you that’s been fooling me with deceitful music, leading me a wearisome chase.”\n\n“Not I, I’ve not done this. There they are, out to sea; you can hear for yourself.” And, sure enough, on listening, one could hear the throbbing of the music in the offing.\n\nPele acknowledged her mistake and continued her pursuit, with the parting assurance to the old soul that if he had been the guilty one, it would have been his last day of life.\n\nThe real authors of this illusive musical performance were two little creatures named Kani-ka-wí and Kani-ka-wá, the former a sprite that was embodied in the nose-flute, the latter in the hokeo, a kind of whistle, both of them used as accompaniments to the hula. Their sly purpose was to lure Pele to a place where the hula was being performed.\n\nPele now plunged into the water—from this point at least she swam—and, guided by the call of the music, directed her course to the little village of Haena that perched like a gull on the cape of the same name, at the northernmost point of the island of Kaua’i. It was but a few steps to the hall of the hula—the halau—where throbbed the hula drums and where was a concourse of people gathered from the whole island. [5]\n\nAs Pele drew near to the rustic hall where the hula was in full blast, the people in the outskirts of the assembly turned to look in wonder and admiration at the beauty and charm of the stranger who had appeared so unexpectedly and whose person exhaled such a fragrance, as if she had been clad with sweet-scented garlands of maile, lehua and hala. One and all declared her to be the most beautiful woman they had ever looked upon. Where was she from? Surely not from Kaua’i. Such loveliness could not have remained hidden in any nook or corner of the island, they declared.\n\nInstinctively the wondering multitude parted and offered a lane for her to pass through and enter the halau, thus granting to Pele a full view of the musicians and performers of the hula, and, sitting in their midst, Lohiau,—as yet seemingly unconscious of her presence,—on his either hand a fellow drummer; while, flanking these to right and left, sat players with a joint of bamboo in either hand (the kaekeeke). But drummer and kaekeeke-player, musicians and actors—aye, the whole audience—became petrified and silent at the sight of Pele, as she advanced step by step, her eyes fixed on Lohiau.\n\nThen, with intensified look, as if summoning to her aid the godlike gifts that were hers as the mistress of Kilauea, she reached out her hand and, in a clear tone, with a mastery that held the listeners spell-bound, she chanted:\n\nLu’ulu’u Hanalei i ka ua nui,\n\nKaumaha i ka noe o Alaka’i,\n\nI ka hele ua o Manu’a-kepa;\n\nUoi ku i ka loa o Ko’i-alana,\n\nI ka alaka’i ’a a ka malihini, e!\n\nMai hina, mai hina au,\n\nMai palaha ia o-e.\n\nImi wale ana au o kahi o ke ola,\n\nO ke ola nei, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nTight-pressed is Hanalei’s throng,\n\nA tree bent down by heavy rain, [6]\n\nWeighted with drops from the clouds,\n\nWhen rain columns sweep through Manu’a-kepa,\n\nThis throng that has lured on the stranger,\n\nNigh to downfall, to downfall, was I,\n\nLaid flat by your trick—aye yours!\n\nMy quest was for comfort and life,\n\nJust for comfort and life!\n\nThe silence became oppressive. In the stillness that followed the song expectant eyes were focused upon Prince Lohiau, awaiting his reply to the address of the stranger who stood in their midst. No one knew who she was; no one imagined her to be Pele. That she was a person of distinction and rank was evident enough, one whom it was the duty and rare privilege of their chief to receive and entertain.\n\nPresently there was wrinkling of foreheads, an exchange of glances, prompting winks and nods, inclinations of the head, a turning of the eyes—though not a word was spoken—; for his friends thought thus to rouse Lohiau from his daze and to prompt him to the dutiful rites of hospitality and gallantry. Paoa, his intimate friend, sitting at Lohiau’s right hand, with a drum between his knees, even ventured to nudge him in the side.\n\nThe silence was broken by Pele:\n\nKalakú Hilo i ka ua nui;\n\nKapu ke nu, ke i,\n\nI ka puá o ka leo,\n\nI ka hamahamau—hamau kakou—\n\nI ka hawanawana;\n\nI ke kunou maka;\n\nI ka awihi maka;\n\nI ka alawa iki.\n\nEia ho’i au, kou hoa,\n\nKou hoa, ho’i, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nBristling, frumpy, sits Hilo,\n\nDrenched by the pouring rain,\n\nForbidden to murmur,\n\nOr put forth a sound,\n\nOr make utt’rance by speech: [7]\n\nMust all remain breathless,\n\nNor heave an audible sigh,\n\nWithholding the nod, the wink,\n\nAnd the glance to one side.\n\nI pray you behold me now:—\n\nHere stand I, your guest,\n\nYour companion, your mate!\n\nLohiau, once roused from his ecstacy, rose to the occasion and with the utmost gallantry and politeness invited Pele to sit with him and partake of the hospitalities of the halau.\n\nWhen Pele had seated herself on the mat-piled dais, Lohiau, following the etiquette of the country, asked whence she came.\n\n“I am of Kaua’i,” she answered.\n\n“There is no woman of Kaua’i your equal in beauty,” said Lohiau. “I am the chief and I know, for I visit every part of the whole island.”\n\n“You have doubtless traveled about the whole island,” answered Pele; “yet there remain places you are not acquainted with; and that is where I come from.”\n\n“No, no! you are not of Kaua’i. Where are you from?”\n\nBecause of his importunity, Pele answered him, “I am from Puna, from the land of the sunrise; from Ha’eha’e, the eastern gate of the sun.”\n\nLohiau bade that they spread the tables for a feast, and he invited Pele to sit with him and partake of the food. But Pele refused food, saying, “I have eaten.”\n\n“How can that be?” said he, “seeing you have but now come from a long journey? You had better sit down and eat.”\n\nPele sat with him, but she persistently declined all his offers of food, “I am not hungry.”\n\nLohiau sat at the feast, but he could not eat; his mind was disturbed; his eyes were upon the woman at his side. When they rose from the table he led her, not unwilling, to his house, and he lay down upon a couch by her side. But she would favor him only with kisses. In his growing passion for her he forgot his need of food, his fondness for the hula, the obligations that rested upon him as a host: all these were driven from his head.\n\nAll that night and the following day, and another night, and for three days and three nights, he lay at her side, struggling with her, striving to overcome her resistance. But she would grant him only kisses. [8]\n\nAnd, on the third night, as it came towards morning, Pele said to Lohiau, “I am about to return to my place, to Puna, the land of the sunrise. You shall stay here. I will prepare a habitation for us, and, when all is ready I will send and fetch you to myself. If it is a man who comes, you must not go with him; but, if a woman, you are to go with the woman. Then, for five days and five nights you and I will take our fill of pleasure. After that you will be free to go with another woman.”\n\nIn his madness, Lohiau put forth his best efforts to overcome Pele’s resistance, but she would not permit him. “When we meet on Hawaii you shall enjoy me to your fill,” said she. He struggled with her, but she foiled him and bit him in the hand to the quick; and he grasped the wound with the other hand to staunch the pain. And he, in turn, in the fierceness of his passion, planted his teeth in her body.\n\nAt this, Pele fluttered forth from the house, plunged into the ocean and—was gone.\n\nHiiaka arrived at the Pit in good time to partake with the others of the frugal feast ordered by Pele. At its conclusion, Pele turned to the girl Hiiaka and put the question in her blunt way, “Will you be my messenger to fetch our lover—yours and mine—from Kaua’i? Your sisters here”—she glanced severely about the group—“have refused to go. Will you do this for me?”\n\nThe little maid, true to her sense of loyalty to the woman who was her older sister, the head of the family, and her alii, to the surprise and dismay of her other sisters, answered, “Yes, I will go and bring the man.”\n\nIt was a shock to their sense of fitness that one so young should be sent on an errand of such danger and magnitude; but more, it was a reproof that slapped them in the face to have this little chit accept without hesitation a commission which they had shrunk from through lack of courage. But they dared not say a word; they could but scowl and roll the eye and shrug the shoulder.\n\n“When you have brought our lover here,” continued Pele, “for five nights and five days he shall be mine; after that, the tabu shall be off and he shall be yours. But, while on the way, you must not kiss him, nor fondle him, nor touch him. If you do it will be the death of you both.”\n\nIn spite of the gestured remonstrances of the group, Hiiaka, in utter self-forgetfulness and diplomatic inexperience, agreed to Pele’s proposition, and she framed her assent in a form of speech that had in it the flavor of a sacrament:\n\nKukulu ka makia a ka huaka’i hele moe ipo:\n\nKu au, hele, noho oe.\n\nE noho ana na lehua lulu’u,\n\nKu’u moku lehua i uka o Ka-li’u, e.\n\nLi’uli’u wale ka hele ana\n\nO ka huaka’i moe ipo.\n\nAloha mai ka ipo—\n\nO Lohiau ipo, i Haena.\n\n[16]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nFirm plant the pillar, seal of our love-pact;\n\nHere stand I, begirt for this love-quest;\n\nYou shall abide, and with you my groves—\n\nLehua and hala—heavy with bloom.\n\nThe journey is long and toilsome the task\n\nTo bring our fine lover to bed.\n\nMark! a love-hail—from beloved Lohiau!\n\nBeloved Lohiau of Haena!\n\n(I am impelled by my admiration for this beautiful song to give another version of it:)\n\nKu kila ke kaunu moe ipo;\n\nKu au, hele, noho oe, a no-ho,\n\nA noho ana i na lehua o Lu-lu’u,\n\nO ka pae hala, moku lehua, i uka o Ka-li’u.\n\nLi’u-li’u ho’i, li’u-li’u wale\n\nKa hele ana o ka huaka’i moe ipo.\n\nAloha mai ka ipo,\n\nO Lohiau ipo, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nFixed my intent for the lover-quest:\n\nHere I stand to depart; you remain,\n\nAnd with you my bloom-clad lehuas,\n\nAnd the palm-groves that wave in Ka-li’u.\n\nLong, wearisome long, shall the journey be\n\nTo find and to bring our lover—\n\nThat dearest of lovers, Lohiau!\n\nHiiaka would sleep on it. Her start was to be in the morning. The next day, while Hiiaka was climbing the long ascent up the crater-pali, her sisters, anxious and appreciating the danger of the undertaking, were quietly weeping outside the cave; but they dared not utter a word that might come to the ears of Pele. They began, however, to beckon and signal to Hiiaka to return. She saw them and turned back, uttering the following plaint:\n\nE ku ana au e hele;\n\nE lau ka maka o ua nei ino; [17]\n\nE ka po’e ino, o lakou nei, e:\n\nE mana ana, ka, ia’u e hele;\n\nE hele no au, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nWhile I stand ready for travel,\n\nYou bad lot! ’Tis you that I mean!\n\nThis weight of travel you’d lay on me;\n\nThese bad ones sit with impudent stare:\n\nAnd so it is I that must go!\n\nThe opposition of the sisters was based largely on Hiiaka’s youth and inexperience. The girl did not understand nor give them credit for this generous regard for herself; she saw only their disobedience and disloyalty to Pele’s command.\n\nPele, impatient at her vacillation, broke out on her savagely: “Here you are again! Be off on your journey! You shall find no food here, no meat, no raiment, no roof, no sisterly greeting, nothing, until you return with the man. It would have been useless to dispatch these homely women on this errand; it seems equally useless to send a beautiful girl like you.”\n\nTo this outburst Hiiaka retorted:\n\nKe hanai a’e la ka ua1 i ka lani:\n\nMaka’u au i ka ua awa i ka uka o Kiloi.\n\nIná2 ia ia la, he loiloi3, e—\n\nI loiloi no oe elua4 oiwi—\n\nLoiloi iho la, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nThe rain doth replenish the heavens;\n\nI dread the fierce rain of upland Kiloí.\n\nBehold now this one, the fault-finder!\n\nYou, in two shapes, are hard to please—\n\nAye, in either shape, hard to please!\n\n[18]\n\n“I am not grumbling or finding fault with you (loiloi): it was simply because you turned back that I spoke to you. Do you call that reproaching you?”\n\nHiiaka, though a novice in diplomacy, as shown by her instant and unconditional acceptance of Pele’s proposition, having once got her second breath, now exacted of Pele a condition that proved her to be, under the discipline of experience, an apt pupil in the delicate art of diplomacy. “I am going to bring our lover, while you remain at home. If during my absence you go forth on one of your raids, you are welcome to ravage and consume the lands that are common to us both; but, see to it that you do not consume my forests of lehua. And, again, if the fit does come upon you and you must ravage and destroy, look to it that you harm not my friend Hopoe.”\n\nPele readily agreed to Hiiaka’s reasonable demand, thinking thus to hasten her departure. To the inexperienced girl the terms of the agreement seemed now complete and satisfactory, and, in the first blush of her gratification, Hiiaka gave expression to her pleasure:\n\nKe kau aloha wale mai la ka ua, e-e;\n\nKa mauna o ka haliü kua, a-a.\n\nI ku au a aloha oe, ka Lua, e-e!\n\nAloha ia oe, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nKindly falls the rain from heaven;\n\nNow may I turn my back and travel:\n\nTravel-girt, I bid farewell to the Pit;\n\nHere’s a farewell greeting to thee.\n\nEven now Hiiaka made an ineffectual start. Some voice of human instinct whispered that something was wanting, and she again faced her sister with a request so reasonable that it could not be denied:\n\nKe ku nei au e hele:\n\nHele au a ke ala,\n\nMihi mai e-e:\n\nMana’o, ho’i mai no au,\n\nIa oe la, ia o-e.\n\nLa’i pohu mai la [19]\n\nLalo o ka Lua, e:\n\nI elua mai la, pono au.\n\nOlelo I ke aka,\n\nKa hele ho’okahi, e;\n\nMamina ka leo—\n\nHe leo wale no, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nMy foot still shod for travel,—\n\nI made a misstart on my journey;\n\nI’ve come to repair my neglect.\n\nA need, a request, brings me back,\n\nTo plead in thy presence once more:\n\nJoy springs up within;\n\nThere’s calm in the Pit.\n\nGive me but a travel-mate:\n\nThat would content me.\n\nWho travels alone has\n\nFor speech-mate his shadow.\n\nFutile is speech, with\n\nNo answering voice—\n\nEmpty words, only a voice.\n\n(The exigencies of the narrative have induced me, in the above song, to couple together two mele which the story-tellers have given us as belonging to two separate incidents in Hiiaka’s fence with Pele.)\n\n“Your request is reasonable,” said Pele; “to travel alone is indeed to converse with one’s shadow. You shall have a companion.”\n\nPele designated a good-natured waiting woman as her attendant, who had the poetical name of Paú-o-pala’e (or Paú-o-palaá). This faithful creature heartily accepted the trust, that of kahu—a servant with the pseudo responsibility of a guardian—and, having expressed her fealty to her new mistress, she at once took her station. Thus everything seemed arranged for a start on the eventful journey.\n\nThe terms and conditions of Hiiaka’s going were not even yet to the satisfaction of her watchful sisters and relatives. One matter of vital importance had been omitted from the outfit: Pele had not bestowed upon Hiiaka the mana, power and authority, [20]to overcome and subdue all the foes that would surely rise up to oppose and defeat her. With wild gestures they signalled to Hiiaka once more to return.\n\nHiiaka’s answering song, though pointed with blame, gives proof that her own intuitions were not entirely at fault:\n\nA ka luna, i Pu’u-onioni,\n\nNoho ke anaina a ke ’Kua.\n\nKilohi a’ ku’u maka ilalo,\n\nI ka ulu o Wahine-kapu:\n\nHe o’ioina Kilauea,\n\nHe noho-ana o Papa-lau-ahi, e.\n\nKe lau-ahi mai la o Pele ia kai o Puna:\n\nUa one-á, oke-á, kai o Maláma, e.\n\nE málama i ka iki kanaka,\n\nI ka nu’a kanáka;\n\nO kakou no keia ho-akua—\n\nAkua Mo’o-lau, e!\n\nO Mo’o-lau ke ala, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nFrom the crest of Tremble5 Hill\n\nI look on the concourse of gods,\n\nAt ease on the gossip-ground,\n\nThe seat of Wahine-kapu,\n\nRest-station to Kilauea,\n\nIts pavement of lava-plate:\n\nSuch plates Pele spreads in Puna—\n\nHot shards, gray sands at Maláma.\n\nSuccor and life for small and great!\n\nBe it ours to play the god; our way\n\nBeset by demons four hundred!\n\nThe communication between Hiiaka and her sisters had, on their part, been carried on mostly by means of gesture and sign-language. But on this return of Hiiaka the whole family of brothers and sisters were so moved at the thought of the danger to Hiiaka that they spoke out at last and frankly advised Hiiaka to go before Pele and demand of her the gift of spiritual power, mana, that she might be able to meet her enemies on [21]equal terms at least, so that she need not feel powerless in their presence. But nothing came of this move at the time, for at this moment out came Pele from her cave, and, seeing Hiiaka standing with the others, she addressed her sharply and said: “What! You still here? Why are you not on the way to fetch our man?”\n\nFace to face with Pele, Hiiaka’s courage oozed away and she promised to make another start in the morning. When on this new start she had come near the top of the ascent, she turned about and sang:\n\nPunohunohu i ka lani\n\nKa uahi o ka lua;\n\nHe la’i ilalo o Kilauea;\n\nManiania ’luna o Wahine-kapu.\n\nI kapu, la, i ke aha ka leo, e?\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nThe pit-smoke blankets the heavens;\n\nClear is the air in Kilauea,\n\nTranquil Wahine-kapu’s plain—\n\nThe Woman, why silent her voice?\n\nHiiaka now made common cause with the group of sisters and relatives who were bent on securing for her justice and fair treatment. Among them, taking council together, sat Ka-moho-alii, Kane-milo-hai, Kapo and Pohakau6. By this action Hiiaka took a new attitude: while not coming out in open defiance to her sister, she virtually declared her determination no longer to be domineered over by Pele.\n\nIn the council that took place it was determined that Ka-moho-alii, who stood high in Pele’s regards and whose authority was second only to hers, was the proper one to approach Pele in the matter of conferring upon Hiiaka the necessary mana. When, therefore, Pele put to Hiiaka the question why she had returned, why she was not on her journey, Ka-moho-alii spoke up and said, “It is because of fear she has returned. She sees danger by the way. You have not given her the mana to protect her from the [22]dragons and monsters that infest the road. O Mo’o-lau ke ala, e: The way is beset by dragons four hundred.”\n\n“Ah, that is the trouble?” said Pele. Then she called upon the Sun, the Moon, the Stars, Wind, Rain, Thunder, Lightning—all the heavenly powers—to aid and safeguard Hiiaka and she authorized her to exercise the powers of these heavenly beings. The gods, thereupon, ratified this act of Pele; and at last the way was made clear for Hiiaka’s departure.\n\nThe refusal of her sisters to undertake the mission to fetch Lohiau had angered Hiiaka. Her intrepid fealty to Pele, their oldest sister and their alii, laughed to scorn the perils of the journey. She could not and, for a time, would not bring herself to understand their prudential attitude. Pele was their alii, and it was rank disloyalty in them to shirk any danger or to decline any command Pele might think fit to impose. In judging the conduct of her sisters, it did not at first enter the head of Hiiaka that motives of sound worldly prudence justified them in declining for themselves an errand full of danger, or in putting obstacles in the way of her going on the same errand: she saw in it only a failure to rise to the level of her own loyalty.\n\nThe situation, then, was heavily charged with estrangement, and when the woman in Hiiaka could not refrain from one more farewell, the color and tone of voice and song had in them the snap of electricity:\n\nKe ku nei au e hele, a noho oe;\n\nA noho ana na Wahine o Lu-lu’u\n\nE ka pae1 moku lehua\n\nI uka o Ka-li’u, la.\n\nLi’uli’u wale ka hele ana\n\nO ka huaka’i moe ipo.\n\nAloha mai ka ipo,\n\nO Lohiau ipo, e-e!\n\n[23]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nHere stand I begirt for travel;\n\nYou must tarry at home, and these …\n\nThese … women … who sit downcast.\n\nOh, care for my parks of lehua—\n\nHow they bloom in upland Ka-li’u!\n\nLong is the way and many the day\n\nBefore you shall come to the bed of love,\n\nBut, hark! the call of the lover,\n\nThe voice of the lover, Lohiau!\n\nAt the utterance of this name Pele brightened and called to Hiiaka, “Yes, that is the name of our man. I purposely kept it back until you should have reached the water-shed (kaupaku2 o ka hale o kaua, literally the ridgepole) of our house, intending then to reveal it to you; but you have divined the man’s name. Go on your journey. Nothing shall avail to block your road. Yours is the power of woman; the power of man is nothing to that.”\n\nOn reaching the plateau of Wahine-kapu Hiiaka received a spiritual message telling her that Lohiau—the object of her errand—was dead. She at once turned towards Pele and commemorated the fact in song:\n\nI Akani-hia,\n\nI Akani-kolea,\n\nI Pu’u-wa’a-hia,\n\nI Pu’u-manawa-le’a,\n\nI Pu’u-aloha, la:\n\nHe mea e ke aloha o ke kane, e.\n\nKe haale iho nei au e hanini, e;\n\nE uwé au, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nLet us sound it aloud—\n\nFar as the plover’s flight;\n\nWith full breath shout it,\n\nAnd with a full heart,\n\nBig with affection. [24]\n\nAh, wondrous the love for a man!\n\nThe feelings that strive,\n\nAs these tears, to rush out—\n\nI can not repress them!\n\nPele did not know this name-song of Lohiau until she heard it recited by Hiiaka. This it was that led Hiiaka to come back within easy hearing distance:\n\nKe uwá ia mai la e ka ua;\n\nKe kahe ia mai la e ka wai:\n\nNa lehua i Wai-a’ama, la, lilo,\n\nLilo a’u opala lehua\n\nI kai o Pi’i-honua, la;\n\nMai Po’i-honua no a Pi’i-lani.\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nIt sobs in the rain;\n\nIt moans in the rushing tide.\n\nGone is my grove of lehuas—\n\nMy rubbish grove, that stood\n\nBy the pilfering waters—flown,\n\nHe has flown, like its smoke, to heaven.\n\n’Tis there I must seek him!\n\n“How absurd of you,” said Pele; “you were not sent on an expedition to heaven, but to bring a man who is here on earth. If you fly up to heaven, you will pass him by and leave him here below.”\n\nHiiaka and her faithful companion—Pau-o-pala’e—had gotten well away from the vast pit of Kilauea, with its fringe of steam-cracks and fumaroles that radiate from it like the stays of a spider-web, and they were nearing the borders of Pana-ewa, when Hiiaka’s quick ear caught the sound of a squealing pig. Her ready intuition furnished the right interpretation to this seemingly insignificant occurrence:\n\nA loko au o Pana-ewa,\n\nHalawai me ka pua’a\n\nA Wahine-oma’o,\n\nMe ku’u maka lehua i uka. [25]\n\nMe ka Malu-ko’i3 i ka nahele,\n\nE uwé ana i ka laau.\n\nAlalá ka pua’a a ka wahine—\n\nHe pua’a kanaenae,\n\nHe kanaenae mohai ola—\n\nE ola ia Pele,\n\nI ka Wahine o ka Lua, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nIn the heart of Pana-ewa—\n\nLehuas were heavy with bud,\n\nThe dim aisles solemn with shadow—\n\nI met with a suckling pig,\n\nThe pet of Wahine-oma’o,\n\nA wailing voice in the wilderness:\n\n’Twas the creature wail of the thing,\n\nForedoomed as an offering, this\n\nWailing thing was a sacrifice,\n\nAn appeal to Pele for life,\n\nTo the Woman who dwells in the Pit.\n\nAt this moment a young woman of attractive person appeared on the scene and, prostrating herself to the earth, said, “O, Pele, behold my offering, which I bring to thee in fulfillment of the pledge made by my parents, that I should first seek thee, O Pele, before I come to my marriage bed. Accept this suckling which I offer to thee, O Pele.”\n\n“I am not the one you are seeking: I am not Pele,” said Hiiaka. “Pele is over yonder in the Pit.”\n\nThe woman was persistent and begged that Hiiaka would not despise her offering. After undeceiving her, Hiiaka carefully instructed her, lest she make some fatal mistake in her approach to the jealous goddess: “When you come to the Pit you must be careful in your approach to Pele. The least departure from the etiquette she demands would be the cause of your death. Do not imagine that the fine large woman sitting at the door is Pele, nor that any one of the women seated within is she. You must pay no attention to these. Look for the figure of a wrinkled old woman lying bundled up on the hearth: that is Pele: make the offering to no one else but to her.” [26]\n\n“Alas for me,” said Wahine-oma’o. “You will be gone a long way from this place by the time I shall return to seek you. I shall not be able to find you.”\n\n“You will find us here,” replied Hiiaka assuringly.\n\nHiiaka used her power to bring the woman at once to her destination. Following the instructions given her, Wahine-oma’o was quickly transported into the presence of Pele and, having made her offering in due form, was about to retire, when Pele called her back and said, “Did you not meet some women going from here as you came this way?”\n\n“I met some women,” she answered.\n\n“Make haste and come up with them,” said Pele. “The younger woman is very dear to me. Attach yourself to her as a friend.”\n\n“That I will do,” said Wahine-oma’o. Then, moved by an impulse that came to her (the work, it is said, of Hiiaka), she said to Pele, “I had imagined you to be a beautiful woman, Pele. But, lo, you are old and wrinkled; and your eyes are red and watery.” Thus saying, Wahine-oma’o took her departure and almost immediately found herself again with Hiiaka.\n\n“You have made quick time,” Hiiaka said. “How did you get on?”\n\n“I followed your instructions and presented my offering to the woman who was lying on the hearth. She asked me if I had met you, and when I said yes, she told me to look after you as a friend.”\n\n“Is that all?”\n\n“She also told me to watch you, to observe how you behaved towards the man—whether you kissed him or had any dalliance with him.”\n\n“And did you say anything to Pele?”\n\n“U-m, I bantered her about her looks; told her she was a very ill-favored woman, while the women attending her were very handsome.”\n\nHiiaka laughed at this naive account.\n\nNight shut down upon them at Kuolo, a place just on the border of Pana-ewa. Paú-o-pala’e proposed that they should seek a resting place for the night with the people of the hamlet. Hiiaka would not hear to it: “Travelers should sleep in the open, in the road; in that way they can rise and resume their journey with no delay.” (O ka po’e hele he pono ia lakou e moe i ke alanui, i ala no a hele no.) [27]\n\nTwo routes offered themselves for Hiiaka’s choice, a makai road, circuitous but safe, the one ordinarily pursued by travelers; the other direct but bristling with danger, because it traversed the territory of the redoubtable witch-mo’o, Pana-ewa. Hiiaka had deigned to appeal to the girl Pa-pulehu, she being a kamaaina1, as if for information. When Hiiaka announced her determination to take the short road, the one of danger that struck through the heart of Pana-ewa, Pa-pulehu drew back in dismay and expostulated: “That is not a fit road for us, or for any but a band of warriors. If we go that way we shall be killed.” She broke forth with lamentations, bewailing her coming fate and the desolation that was about to visit her family.\n\nAs they advanced Wahine-oma’o descried a gray scare-crow object motionless in the road ahead of them. She thought it to be the blasted stump of a kukui tree. Hiiaka recognized its true character, the witch-form taken as a disguise by a mo’o. It was a scout sent out by Pana-ewa; in real character a hag, but slimed with a gray excrement to give it closer resemblance to a mouldering tree-stump. The deceiving art of magic did not avail against Hiiaka. She rushed forward to give the death stroke to the foul thing, which at once groveled in the dirt in its true form.\n\nNight overtook them in a dense forest. While the others lay and slept, Hiiaka reconnoitered the situation. The repose of the wilderness was unbroken save for the restless flitting of a solitary bird that peered at Hiiaka obtrusively. It was a spy in the employ of Pana-ewa and its actions roused the lively suspicions of Hiiaka, eliciting from her an appropriate incantation:\n\nKa wai mukiki ale lehua a ka manu,\n\nKa awa ili lena i ka uka o Ka-li’u,\n\nKa manu aha’i lau awa o Puna:\n\nAia i ka laau ka awa o Puna.\n\nMapu mai kona aloha ia’u—\n\nHoolaau mai ana ia’u e moe.\n\nE moe no au, e-e!\n\n[31]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nO honey-dew sipped by the bird,\n\nDistilled from the fragrant lehua;\n\nO yellow-barked awa that twines\n\nIn the upper lands of Ka-li’u;\n\nO bird that brews from this leafage\n\nPuna’s bitter-sweet awa draught;—\n\nPuna’s potentest awa grows\n\nAloft in the crotch of the trees.\n\nIt wafts the seduction to sleep,\n\nThat I lock my senses in sleep!\n\nIt was a subtle temptation that suggested the awa cup as a relief for her troubles. Hiiaka had need that all her faculties should give her their best service. For her to have slept at this time would have been fatal. Her song well expressed it:\n\nE nihi ka hele i ka uka o Puna;\n\nMai ako i ka pua,\n\nO lilo i ke ala o ka hewahewa.\n\nUa huná ia ke kino i ka pohaku,\n\nO ka pua na’e ke ahu nei i ke alanui—\n\nAlanui hele o ka unu kupukupu, e-e;—\n\nKa ulí-a!\n\nA kaunu no anei oe o ke aloha la?\n\nHele a’e a komo i ka hale o Pele;\n\nUa huahua’i i Kahiki; lapa uila,\n\nPele e, hua’i’na ho’i!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nHeed well your way in upland Puna;\n\nPluck never a single flower;\n\nLest you stray from the path.\n\nThe shape lies hid neath a stone,\n\nThe path is one carpet of flowers,\n\nThe blocks of stumbling overgrown.\n\nQuick follows the downfall!\n\nIs there a compact between us of love?\n\nFly, voice, assail the ear of Pele!\n\nErupt, Kahiki, with lightning flash!\n\nNow, Pele, burst forth in thy might!\n\n[32]\n\nPana-ewa entrusted the work of reconnaissance and scouting for information to two of his creatures named Ke-anini and Ihi-kalo, while he lay down and slept. Having done their work, the two scouts waked the drowsy monster in the middle of the night with the information that four human beings, women, had entered his domain and were coming towards him. “Where are they?” he asked.\n\n“Out in this direction (pointing), and they are moving this way.”\n\n“Well, this day of fasting has gone by. What a pity, however, that the poi in my calabash has turned sour, but the taro is sweet. Eye-balls! what juicy, delicious morsels! The day of privation turns out to be a day of feasting.” Thus muttered the cannibal monster, gloating like Polyphemus in his cave at the prospect of a feast.\n\nHiiaka kept her own courage at the fine point of seeming indifference, she also inspired her companions with the same feeling by the calm confidence displayed in her singing:\n\nPau ke aho i ke kahawai lau o Hilo:\n\nHe lau ka pu’u, he mano ka iho’na;\n\nHe mano na kahawai o Kula’i-po;\n\nHe wai Honoli’i, he pali o Kama-e’e,\n\nHe pali no Koolau ka Hilo-pali-ku;\n\nHe pali Wailuku, he one ke hele ia;\n\nHe one e ke’ehia la i Wai-olama.\n\nHe aka ka wi a ka wai i Pana-ewa—\n\nO Pana-ewa nui, moku-lehua,\n\nOhi’a kupu hao’eo’e i ka ua,\n\nLehua ula i ka wi’ ia e ka manu.\n\nA ua po, e, po Puna, po Hilo\n\nI ka uahi o ku’u aina.\n\nBy Pana-ewa.—\n\n“Ola ia kini! ke a mai la ke ahi, e-e!”\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nOne’s strength is exhausted, climbing, climbing\n\nThe countless valleys and ridges of Hilo,—\n\nThe streams without number of Ku-la’i-po,\n\nThe mighty water of Hono-li’i,\n\nThe precipice walls of Kama-e’e,\n\nAnd the pali of Ko’olau: [33]\n\nSuch a land is Hilo-pali-ku.\n\nThe banks of Wailuku are walls;\n\nThe road to its crossing but sand;\n\nSandy the way at Wai-o-lama.\n\nHow cheery the purl of these waters!—\n\nGreat Pana-ewa—her parks of lehua,\n\nScraggy in growth yet scarlet a-top,\n\nIts nectar wrung out by the birds!\n\nBlack night covers Puna and Hilo,\n\nA pall from the smoke of my home land!\n\n(By Pana-ewa).\n\n“Here’s food for me and mine!\n\nBehold the blaze of the ovens!”\n\n(The last two lines are said to be the utterance of Pana-ewa who feigned to regard the fires as those of his own people, who, in anticipation of an easy victory, had made ready their ovens to receive the bodies of Hiiaka and her party.)\n\nHiiaka bravely answered Pana-ewa:\n\nO Pana-ewa, ohi’a loloa,\n\nOhi’a uliuli i ka uä,\n\nI moku pewa ia\n\nE ka laau o kepakepa,\n\nA ka uka i Haili la.\n\nIlihia, ilihia i ka leo—\n\nHe leo wale no, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nPana-ewa, a tall ohi’a,\n\nThe fruit red-ripe in the rain,\n\nIs vilely slashed with the stick\n\nOf the mountaineer.\n\nIt stands in upland Haili:\n\nTerrific—the voice is terrific;\n\nYet it’s merely a voice!\n\n“The voice was threatening only because my servants reported that some people were trespassing. That set my tongue agoing about poi - - - and - taro. - - - After all it’s a question of strength. Your valor it is that must win for you a passage through this land of mine.”\n\nThis was Pana-ewa’s ultimatum. [34]\n\nHiiaka accepted the defiance of Pana-ewa by chanting a solemn kahoahoa, which was at once a confident prediction of victory and an appeal to the gods:\n\nKua loloa Keäau i ka nahele hala;\n\nKua huluhulu Pana-ewa i ka laau;\n\nInoino ka maha, ka ohi’a o La’a, e;\n\nKu kepakepa ka maha o ka laau,\n\nU-á po’ohina i ka wela a ke Akua;\n\nU-a-uahi Puna o ka oloka’a pohaku ia,\n\nI ka huná pa’a ia e ka Wahine.\n\nNanahu ahi ka ka papa o Olueä;\n\nMomoku ahi Puna, hala i Apua;\n\nUlu-á ka nahele me ka laau;\n\nKa ke kahiko ia o Papa-lau-ahi.\n\nEle-i2 kahiko, e Ku-lili-kaua;\n\nKa ia,3 hea4 hala o Ka-li’u;\n\nE ne5 ka La, ka malama;\n\nOnakaka ka piko6 o Hilo i ke one,\n\nI hu-lá7 ia aku la e, hulihia i kai.\n\nUa wawahia, ua nahahá,\n\nUa he-helelei ka papa i Pua-le’i, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nLong is the reach of Keäau’s palms;\n\nBristly-backed Pana-ewa’s woodlands;\n\nSpoiled are the restful groves of La’a;\n\nRagged and patchy the tree-clumps—\n\nGray their heads from the ravage of fire.\n\nA blanket of smoke covers Puna—\n\nAll paved with the dump from Her stone-yard.\n\nThe Goddess’ fire bites Olu-eä—\n\nOne cinder-heap clean to Apua; [35]\n\nFood for Her oven are wildwood and brush—\n\nThe finish that to Lau-ahi’s glory:\n\nHer robe now is changed to jetty black,\n\nAt the onset of Ku-lili-kaua,\n\nKa-liu’s palms plucked root and branch.\n\nThe Sun and the Moon are blotted out;\n\nHilo is shaken to its foundation,\n\nIts lands upheaved, despoiled to the sea,\n\nShattered, fissured, powdered, reduced;\n\nIts plain is ashes and dust!\n\nThe battle that ensued when Pana-ewa sent to the attack his nondescript pack of mo’o, dragonlike anthropoids, the spawn of witchcraft, inflamed with the spite of demons, was hideous and uncanny. Tooth and claw ran amuck. Flesh was torn, limbs rent apart, blood ran like water. If it had been only a battle with enemies in the open Hiiaka would have made short work of the job. Her foes lay ambushed in every wood and brake and assumed every imaginable disguise. A withered bush, a bunch of grass, a moss-grown stone, any, the most innocent object in nature, might prove to be an assailant ready to spit venom or tear with hook and talon. Hiiaka had need of every grain of wit and every spark of courage in her nature. Nothing could withstand her onset and the billows of attack against her person were broken as by a solid rock. Some described her as wielding a flaming battle-ax and hurling missiles of burning sulphur. They might well be deceived. The quickness of her every motion was a counterfeit of the riving blade or blazing fire-ball. Some assert that, in her frenzy, she tore with her teeth and even devoured the reeking flesh until her stomach rose in rebellion. Such a notion seems incompatible with the violence of her disgust for the reptilian blood that besmeared her from sole to crown.\n\nPaú-o-pala’e, using her magical paú as a besom of destruction, was transformed into a veritable Bellona; and Wahine-oma’o displayed the courage of an amazon. These both escaped serious injury. The unhappy fate of Pa-pulehu realized that girl’s premonition. She fell into the hands of the enemy and, as if to fulfill the prediction of Pele, became “food for the gods of Pana-ewa.”\n\nAs Hiiaka glanced heavenward, she saw the zenith filled with cloud-forms—Kane, Kanaloa, Ka-moho-alii, Poha-kau and [36]others, encouraging her with their looks. The sight, while it cheered, wrung from her a fervent prayer:\n\nKela pae opua i ka lani, e,\n\nKe ka’i a’e la mauka o Poha-kau.\n\nHe kaukau, aloha keia ia oe,\n\nIa oe no, e-e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nYon group of god-forms, that float\n\nAnd sail with the clouds heaven-high,\n\nMustered and led by Poha-kau;\n\nThis prayer is a love-call to you!\n\n“Our sister is in trouble,” said Ka-moho-alii, “let us go to her assistance!” Such was the call of Ka-moho-alii when he saw his little friend and quondam protegé Hiiaka in trouble, and theirs were the god-forms that sailed through the sky to reinforce her.\n\nThe bird-spies sent out by Pana-ewa brought back contradictory reports. The first pair reported that Hiiaka was being worsted. Soon after another pair, garbling the facts, said “Our people are lying down, but they are still alert and keep their eyes open. As for Hiiaka, she has fallen into a deep sleep.”\n\nThe situation was far from satisfactory and Pana-ewa despatched another pair of birds to reconnoitre and report. It was not yet morning and the night was dark; and they accordingly took the form of kukui1 trees, thinking thus to illuminate the scene of operations. The intelligence they brought was confounding: “Our people,” they said, “are all dead, save those who have the form of kukui trees. Hiiaka lies quietly sleeping in the road.”\n\nThis account, though strictly in accord with the facts, was so disconcerting to Pana-ewa that he burst forth in a rage, “Slaves, liars! you’re deceiving me. I’ll wring your necks!” and he reached out to execute his threat. The birds eluded him and found safety in flight. [37]\n\nPana-ewa now saw that it was necessary to take the field in person at the head of his regular forces, composed of the Namú and Nawá. The disguise he chose for himself was that of an ohia-lehua tree. No sooner had he taken that form than he found himself unable to move hand or foot. A parasitic network of i-e-i-e embraced his body and a multitude of aërial roots anchored him to the spot. It was the craft of the sleeping girl that had done this. He had to content himself with the unwarlike guise of the kukui tree.\n\nWhile Hiiaka slept, her faithful servitor Paú-o-pala’e kept open eye and detective ear to what was going on in the star-lit forest about them. At the first glimmering of dawn her keen sense felt rather than heard a murmurous rustle that broke the stillness and a movement, as if the forest itself were advancing and closing in upon them. This oncoming of the enemy was in such contrast to the onset of the yelping pack on the previous day as to be most impressive. The sound that touched her keen sense was not the joyous twitter and stir of nature preparing to greet a new day; it was rather the distant mutter of the storm, soon to be heard as the growl of the tempest, or the roar and snarl of an enraged menagerie of wild beasts.\n\nThe woman felt her responsibility and, with the double intent of summoning to their aid the friendly gods and of waking Hiiaka, she lifted a solemn prayer:\n\nKuli’a, e Uli,2 ka pule kala ma ola;\n\nKuli’a imua, i ke kahuna;3\n\nKuli’a i ke Alohi-lani.4\n\nE úi aku ana au\n\nI kupua oluna nei, e?\n\nOwai kupua oluna nei, e?\n\nO Ilio-uli5 o ka lani; [38]\n\nO Ilio-ehu,6 o Ilio-mea,7 o ka lani;\n\nO Ku-ke-ao-iki,8 o Ku-ke-ao-poko,9\n\nO Ku-ke-ao-loa10 o ka lani;\n\nO Ku-ke-ao-awihiwihi11 ula o ka lani;\n\nUa ka ua, kahi wai, a na hoalii;12\n\nO nei ka pali ma Ko-wawá;13\n\nO Kupina’e,14 o Ku-wawá;\n\nO Ku-haili-moe;15\n\nO Ha’iha’i-lau-ahea;16\n\nO Mau-a-ke-alii-hea;17\n\nKánaka18 loloa o ka mauna—\n\nO Ku-pulupulu19 i ka nahele,\n\nO na Akua mai ka wao kele;\n\nO Kuli-pe’e-nui20 ai ahua;\n\nO Kiké-alana;21\n\nO Ka-uahi-noe-lehua;\n\nO ke Kahuna i ka puoko22 o ke ahi; [39]\n\nO I’imi,23 o Lalama.24\n\nKu’i ke ahi, ka hekili;\n\nNei ke ola’i;\n\nOlapa ka uila.\n\nLohe o Kane-hekili;25\n\nIkiiki ka maláma ia Ka-ulua.26\n\nElua wahine i hele i ka hikina a ka La—\n\nO Kumu-kahi,27 laua o Ha’eha’e:28\n\nHa’eha’e ka moe\n\nO Kapo-ula-kina’u,29 he alii;\n\nE ho’i, e komo i kou hale,\n\nO Ke-alohi-lani;\n\nE auau i kou ki’owai kapu,\n\nO Ponaha-ke-one;\n\nE inu i kou puawa hiwa,\n\nAwa papa30 a ke Akua,\n\nI kanaenae no Moe-ha-úna-iki,31 e;\n\nHele a’e a komo\n\nI ka hale o Pele.\n\nUa huahua’i Kahiki, lapa uwila:\n\nPele e, hua’i’na ho’i!\n\nHua’i’na a’e ana\n\nKa mana o ko’u Akua iwaho la, e!\n\nO kukulu ka pahu32 kapu a ka leo; [40]\n\nHo’okikí33 kanawai;\n\nHe kua34 á kanawai;\n\nHe kai oki’a35 kanawai;\n\nHe ala muku36 no Kane me Kanaloa;\n\nHe ki37 ho’iho’i kanawai,\n\nNo Pele, no ko’u Akua la, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nStand in the breach, O Uli;\n\nGive heed to this plea for life;\n\nTo the front at the call of thy priest;\n\nCome in the splendor of heaven!\n\nI entreat these powers on high.\n\nAnd who are these beings of might?\n\nYe somber Clouds that rampart the sky;\n\nYe warm Clouds and ye that gleam ruddy;\n\nYe Clouds that guard heaven’s border;\n\nYe Clouds that mottle the heavenly vault;\n\nYe Clouds that embank the horizon;\n\nYe cloud-piles aglow in the sunlight.\n\nDescend, O Rain; O Water, pour—\n\nTorrential rush of the princes!\n\nRent be the wall of the crater;\n\nLet its groans reëcho and fly!\n\nCome, Ku who fashions the landscape;\n\nShe who crushes the leaves of aheä;\n\nGoddess who guards the outer flame-tip;\n\nYe tall ones who dwell in the forest;\n\nKu, the hirsute god of the wilds;\n\nWith his fellows who carve the canoe; [41]\n\nCome bent-kneed terrace-consumer,\n\nWith crash and groan of lava-plate;\n\nAnd reeking smoke that glooms the forest.\n\nCome, Lord of the ruddy flame;\n\nFire-tongues that search and spread;\n\nFire-shafts that smite and crash.\n\nLet earthquake groan and lightning flash.\n\nKane the god of lightning shall hear\n\nAnd warm this frigid month Ulua.\n\nTwo women go to the Sun’s east gate\n\nTo rouse goddess Kapo from sleep—\n\nShe of the black-spotted red robe.\n\nO Kapo, reënter your Sun-temple\n\nAnd bathe in your sacred water-pool—\n\nRound as a gourd, scooped in the sand;\n\nDrink from your black polished awa cup\n\nDark awa that’s offered to the gods,\n\nTo placate the goddess of gentle snore;\n\nThen enter the house of Pele.\n\nPele once burst forth at Kahiki;\n\nOnce again, O Pele, break forth;\n\nDisplay thy power, my God, to the world;\n\nLet thy voice sound out like a drum;\n\nReütter the law of thy burning back;\n\nThat thy dwelling is sacred, apart;\n\nThat Kane and Loa have limits;\n\nThat fixed and firm are Pele’s laws!\n\nFor Pele, great Pele, is my God!\n\nThe sisters, uncles, aunts and other kindred of Hiiaka heard this prayer of Paú-o-pala’e distinctly enough, and so did Pele; and when they saw that she appeared indifferent and made no move, they muttered among themselves. Then Ku-ili-kaua, a man of war and a leader in battle, spoke up and, addressing Ka-moho-alii, said “Why is it that she does not send warriors to the assistance of her sister? The girl has fought most bravely all day and is worn out; and there she lies fast asleep.”\n\nKa-moho-alii thereupon bade Kilioe-i-ka-pua and Olu-wale-i-malo, two handsome lads who were very dear to Pele (mau keiki punahele a Pele)—her sons in fact—to go in to Pele and ask her sanction to their going to the aid of Hiiaka.\n\nWhen these two boys came into Pele’s presence they found [42]her poking the fire with a stick (hoelo kapuahi). With a fine show of confidence, they at once went and seated themselves in Pele’s lap, one on her right thigh and one on her left. Pele’s looks softened as she contemplated them, tears gathered in her eyes and she said, “What is the thought in the heart? Speak.” (Heaha ka hua i ka umauma? Ha’i’na.)\n\n“Your commands.” (O ka leo,38 literally, the voice.)\n\nAt this Pele stood up and, leaving her own home-hearth, went over and took her station in the fire-pit of Hale-ma’u-ma’u. Then, pointing to the east, she said:\n\nO ka leo o ke kanáka hookahi, mailuna mai;\n\nMailoko mai o ka leo o ka manu.39\n\nO huli kai-nu’u40 a Kane;\n\nE wehe ka lani, hamama ka honua;\n\nO wela Kahiki-ku me Kahiki-moe;\n\nAla mai o Ka-moho-alii\n\nE moe ana iloko o ke ao polohiwa.\n\nE Ku e, e ho’i ka amama41 i ka lani;\n\nE Ku e, e ho’i ke ola ia Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele,\n\nA ola loa no, a-a!\n\nIt was such a voice of utterance as this (leo) that the two boys who went in before Pele desired. These two messenger-boys, by the way, are, in another account, spoken of as birds.\n\nThe purpose of Kane in sending out this leo seems to have been to rouse into activity the earth-strata, na papa honua. [43]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nThe voice from above of a man supreme\n\nFlies east, flies west, in the cry of a bird:\n\nCurl over, thou yeasty billow of Kane!\n\nBe rent, O Heaven, and quake, O Earth!\n\nKahiki’s pillars, flame ye and burn!\n\nKa-moho-alii doth wake and rise\n\nFrom his couch on banks of purple cloud.\n\nTo heaven return with thy tabu, O Ku!\n\nSalvation, O Ku, for Hi’iaka—\n\nHi’iaka the darling of Pele!\n\nImmortal life to her!\n\nAt this the gods of war sprang into array, as if unleashed by the words of Pele. At their head marched Ku-lili-ai-kaua, a veteran who had followed Pele in her voyage from Kahiki. With him, went Ke-ka-ko’i, a guide (hookele) well acquainted with the forest trails. In the van strode three weird figures (Ka-maiau, Ka-hinihini and Mápu) bearing conchs, to which they ever and anon applied their lips and sent forth resounding blasts. But even more thrilling and inspiring than the horns of Triton was the voice of these gods of war as they chanted their war-song:\n\nMele Ka’i Kaua\n\nHulihia ka mauna, wela i ke ahi;\n\nWela mo’a-nopu ka uka o Kui-hanalei,42\n\nI ke a pohaku Pu’u-lena43 e lele mai iuka.\n\nO Ke-ka-ko’i44 ka hookele mai ka Lua;\n\nO Ka-maiau45 kani pololei, kani le’ale’a;\n\nO ka Hinihini46 kani kua mauna;\n\nO ka Mápu47 leo nui, kani kóhakohá; [44]\n\nO hulihia i ka ale ula,48 i ka ale lani,49\n\nI ka pu-ko’a,50 i ka a’aka51—\n\nI ke ahu a Lono52 e!\n\nE lono anei, e hookuli?\n\nE hookuli i ka uwalo, e!\n\nEü, e hele no e!\n\nHé-he-hé-e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nThe Mount is convulsed, it belches flame;\n\nFire-scorched is upland Kui-hanalei—\n\nA hail of stones shot out with sulphur-blasts.\n\nKa-ko’i guides the warrior-van;\n\nThe rousing peals of pearly conch\n\nAnd thrilling notes of woodland shells\n\nStir every heart with tuneful cheer.\n\nHeaven’s blue is turmoiled with fire-clouds—\n\nBoiling fountains of flame and cinder—\n\nSuch the form we give to our message:\n\nWill he heed it, or turn a deaf ear?\n\nAh, you see, he scorns our entreaty.\n\nBe valiant! now forward to battle!\n\nHé-he-hé-e-e!\n\nThus chanting their battle-mele (mele ka’i kaua), these gods of an old-time mythology marched, or flew, with resolute purpose to their task of rescuing Hiiaka and her little band and of ridding the land, at one and the same stroke, of their old entrenched foe, Pana-ewa. Heaven and earth stirred at their onset. The visible signs of their array were manifest in columns of seething fire-shot clouds that hovered like vultures over the advancing army. Arrived at striking distance, they let loose their lightning-bolts and sounded their thunder-gongs. Earth [45]and heaven at once became turmoiled in one confused whirl of warring elements.\n\nThe warriors of Pana-ewa, who—in imitation of their chief—had for the most part taken the guise of trees and other natural objects, found themselves from the first fettered and embarrassed by a tangle of parasitic vines, so that their thrusts against Hiiaka were of little avail. Now comes the onset of the Pele gods in the tempest-forms of hurricane, lightning, hail, and watery cloud-bursts that opened heaven’s flood-gates. Against these elemental forces the dryad-forms of Pana-ewa’s host could not stand for a moment. Their tree-shapes were riven and torn limb from limb, engulfed in a swirling tide that swept them down to the ocean and far out to sea.\n\nTwo staunch fighters remained, Kiha, who had chosen to retain the honest dragon-form; and Pua’a-loa, a creature, like Kama-pua’a, in the demi-shape of a boar, whom Pana-ewa, at the scent of disaster, had thrust into the confinement of a secret cave. This manner of retreat saved the twain from the immediate disaster by flood but not from the vengeance of Pele’s army. Detected in their lairs, they were slain and their petrified bodies are pointed out to this day in verification of this story.\n\nThe fate of Pana-ewa himself was most tragical. He no sooner had taken the form of a kukui tree than he found himself overlaid and entangled with meshes of parasitic growth; he could neither fight nor fly. The spot on which he stood sank and became a swamp, a lake, a sink; the foundations on which its bottom rested were broken up and fell away. Pana-ewa, swallowed up in the gulf, was swept out to sea and perished in the waves. Kane-lu-honua had broken up the underlying strata and made of the place a bottomless sink.\n\n(A reef is pointed out in the ocean opposite Papa’i which is the remains of the body of the mo’o Pana-ewa.)\n\nThe part taken by Hiiaka in this last act of her deliverance was hardly more than that of a spectator. She had but to look on and witness the accomplishment of her own salvation. Having been roused from the refreshment of sleep by the long-drawn recitative of Paú-o-pala’e’s prayer-mele (see pp. 37–40), she did her best to cheer her two companions with assurances of coming deliverance and, gathering her little brood about her, after the [46]manner of a mother-hen, figuratively, bade them cling to her, nestle under her wings, lest they should be swept away in the flood of waters that soon began to surge about them—a flood which carried far out to sea the debris of battle—as already described.\n\nThe victory for Hiiaka was complete. Hawaii for once, and for all time, was rid of that pestilential, man-eating, mo’o band headed by Pana-ewa who, from the time of Pele’s coming, had remained entrenched in the beautiful forest-land that still bears the name—Pana-ewa.\n\nThe location of the adventure with the shark-god Maka’u-kiu1 was at the mouth of Wai-pi’o valley, a region where Hawaii’s storm-coast forms an impassable rampart, save as it is cut by this and its twin valley, Wai-manu. These valleys take head in a wild forest region, the home of mist, rain and swamp. Adjoining this and part of the same watershed is the region known as Mahiki-waena, a land which the convenience of traffic required should be open to travel. It was the haunt of a ferocious horde of mo’o called mahiki2 from their power to leap and spring like grass-hoppers.\n\nWhen Hiiaka proposed to pass through this region in the [50]ordinary course of travel, the head of the Mahiki insolently denied her the right of way, suggesting as an alternative the boisterous sea-route around the northern shoulder of Hawaii. Hiiaka’s blood was up. The victory over the hosts of Pana-ewa and the more recent destruction of Maka’u-kiu had fired her courage. She resolved once for all to make an end of this arrogant nuisance and to rid the island of the whole pestilential brood of imps and mo’o. Standing on a height that overlooked Wai-pi’o, she chanted a mele which is at once descriptive of the scene before her and at the same time expressive of her determination:\n\nMele Uhau\n\nA luna au o Wai-pi’o,\n\nKilohi aku k’uu maka ilalo;\n\nHele ho’i ke ala makai o Maka’u-kiu;\n\nHele ho’i ke ala mauka o Ka-pu-o’a—\n\nPihapiha, he’e i ka welowelo,\n\nI ka pu’u Kolea, i ka ino, e—\n\nIno Mahiki:\n\nUa ike ka ho’i au, he ino Mahiki,\n\nHe ino, he ino loa no, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nAs I journeyed above Wai-pi’o\n\nMine eyes drank in that valley—\n\nThe whole long march as far as from\n\nThe sea-fight at Maka’u-kiu\n\nTill the trail climbs Ka-pu-o’a.\n\nThere soggy the road and glairy,\n\nAnd there do flaunt and flourish,\n\nOn Plover Mount, the cursed Mahiki.\n\nFor I am convinced that that crew\n\nAre bad, as bad as bad can be!\n\nHiiaka’s march to encounter the Mahiki was interrupted for a short time by an incident that only served to clinch her resolution. An agonizing cry of distress assailed her ear. It came from a dismantled heap of human flesh, the remains of two men who had been most brutally handled—by these same Mahiki, perhaps—their leg and arm-bones plucked out and they left [51]to welter in their misery. It was seemingly the cruel infliction of the Mahiki. The cry of the two wretches could not be disregarded:\n\nE Hiiaka-i-ka-poli-o-Pele, e,\n\nE ki’i mai oe ia maua;\n\nE ka hookuli i ka ualo, e!\n\nKa opu aloha ole, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nO Hiiaka-of-Pele’s-heart,\n\nCome thou and assist us.\n\nTurn not a deaf ear to our cry!\n\nBe not of hard and unfeeling heart!\n\nHiiaka, with a skill that did credit to her surgery, splinted the maimed limbs, inserting stems from her favorite ti plant to take the place of the long bones that had been removed. She left them seated in comfort at the roadside at Pololú.\n\nThe Mahiki, on seeing Hiiaka advance into their territory, threw up the dirt and dust in their front, to express their contempt for such an insignificant body of trespassers. Hiiaka, paying no attention to their insolence, pressed on. Her purpose was to strike directly at Mo’o-lau, the leader of the horde, to whom she addressed this incantation:\n\nA loko au o Mahiki,\n\nHalawai me ke Akua okioki po’o.\n\nOkioki ino, la, i kona po’o;\n\nKahihi a’e la i kona naau;\n\nHoale mai ana i kona koko i o’u nei.\n\nE Lau e, Lau e-e!\n\nNo’u ke ala, i hele aku ho’i, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nI enter the land of Mahiki;\n\nI counter the head-hunting witch.\n\nSee me pluck the head from her body;\n\nSee me tear out her very heart, [52]\n\nTill her blood surges round me in waves—\n\nBlood of the monster that’s legion.\n\nMine is the common right of way:\n\nThe traveler’s right to the road!\n\nAt dark Hiiaka camped in the road and during the night a female ku-pua named Lau-mihi, whom the Mahiki chief had sent as a spy to watch Hiiaka, was seen standing on a high place to one side of them. Hiiaka at once flew at her and put an end to her.\n\nNow began a fierce battle between Hiiaka and the Mahiki dragon and his forces. They fought till both sides were exhausted and then, as if by mutual consent, stopped to rest.\n\nHiiaka perceived that the battle was to be even more fiercely contested than that at Pana-ewa. She bade Paú-o-pala’e to take good care that no ill came to Wahine-oma’o. Looking up into the heavens, Hiiaka saw her relatives and friends Poha-kau, Ka-moho-alii, Kane-milo-hai, and a large concourse of other gods, including Kane, Kanaloa, Ku and Lono, watching her, evidently greatly interested in her performances. They assured her of their protection. At this Hiiaka was much encouraged and gave utterance to her feelings in this kanaenae:\n\nA Moolau, i ka pua o ka uhiuhi,\n\nHelele’i mai ana ka pua o Ko’o-ko’o-lau.\n\nLohi’a e na mo’o liilii—\n\nNa mo’o liilii ke ala\n\nE kolo i ke kula,\n\nE iho i kai o Kawaihae, la.\n\nHea a’e la ka mo’o liilii:\n\nE hakaká kaua; paio olua auane’i.\n\nHe ’kau Mo’o-lau, o Mo’o-lau akua, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nIn the wilds of Mo’o-lau,\n\nThe uhiuhi’s time for bloom—\n\nThe petals fall of Koolau’s flower:\n\nThe little dragons have found the way\n\nBy which they can crawl to the plain,\n\nGo down to the sea at Kawaihae. [53]\n\nThe little demons now announce\n\nThat you and I shall battle wage:\n\nWe two, indeed, must fight, they say—\n\nA god is Mo’o-lau, a host of gods!\n\nAt this the great dragon Mo’o-lau bestirred himself. His attack was direct, but he divided his host into two columns so as to envelope Hiiaka and attack her on each flank. Hiiaka saw them approaching through the jungle and chanted the following rallying song:\n\nMele Ho’-uluulu\n\nA Mo’o-lau, i ka pua o ka uhiuhi,\n\nPala luhi ehu iho la\n\nKa pua o ke kauno’a i ka la;\n\nNa hale ohai i Kekaha, o Wa’a-kiu;—\n\nE kiu, e kiu ia auane’i kou ahiahi;\n\nE maka’i ia olua auane’i.\n\nHe akua Mo’o-lau, o Mo’o-lau akua, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nIn the jungle of Mo’o-lau,\n\nThe uhi-uhi’s season of bloom;\n\nThe flower of the rootless kau-no’a\n\nIs wilted and bent in the sun;\n\nMy bower in Kekaha’s invaded:\n\nSome creature is playing the spy.\n\nI, in turn,—be warned—will spy out\n\nYour quiet and rest of an evening:\n\nThis to you, you, god Mo’o-lau!\n\nPele, perceiving that the crisis of the conflict had now come, called upon all the male and female relatives of Hiiaka (hoaiku) to go to her assistance; “Go and help your sister Hiiaka. There she is fighting desperately with Mo’o-lau—fighting and resting, fighting and resting, well nigh exhausted. Go and help her; all of you go. It’s a fight against Mo’o-lau.”\n\nWhen the battalion of gods moved against the mo’o, it was a rout and a slaughter. Then the cry arose: “No fight has been made against the Mahiki dragon; he yet survives.” Thereupon [54]they turned their attack against that old dragon and his guards. Hiiaka then celebrated the double victory in this paean:\n\nKaiko’o Pu’u-moe-awa, wawá ka laau;\n\nNei o Pu’u-owai ma, e:\n\nNahá ka welowelo; he’e na’e ho’i, e!\n\nE Pu’u-owai ma, e, ke holo la!\n\nE Miki-aloalo, e, nawai ka make?\n\nKe i-o nei, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nA roar as of surf on the hill Moe-awa:\n\nThe tumult resounds through the forest:\n\nPu’u-owai and his band lead the rout,\n\nYour battallions are torn into tatters—\n\nYou are running, Captain Owai!\n\nAnd you, Captain Spry, whose the defeat?\n\nThe answer is made by the shouting!\n\nHiiaka’s chief weapon of attack seems to have been her magical paú. With this as a besom she beat them down as a husbandman might beat down a swarm of locusts. The Mahiki and the Mo’o-lau had ceased to exist as organized bodies. But from the rout and slaughter of the armies many individuals had escaped with their lives, and these had hid themselves away in caves and secret places, some of them even, presuming apparently upon their power of disguise, had taken refuge in the remote scattered habitations of the people. Such an inference seems to be justified by the language of the mele now to be given:\n\nNote.—The gods that came to the assistance of Hiiaka such times as circumstances pinched her and whose spiritual power at all times reënforced her feeble humanity were limited in their dominion to certain vaguely defined provinces and departments. Thus, if there was any sea-fighting to be done, it fell to the shark-god, the Admiral Ka-moho-alii, to take charge of it. On the other hand, the conduct of a battle on terra firma would be under the generalship of Kane-milo-hai; while to Kana-loa belonged the marshalling of the celestial hosts, the moon and the stars. But the orb of day, the Sun, belonged to Lono. Hence, if the fighting was during the hours of daylight, Lono would logically assume the command. The rule of the great god Ku was also exercised principally by day. It was he who arranged the calendar and settled the order of the seasons, the days and the nights. The subdivisions and departmental complications under these general divisions were numerous. [55]\n\nLilo i Puna, lilo i Puna,\n\nLilo i Puna, i ke au a ka hewahewa;\n\nPopo’i aku ka i na hale:\n\nUa piha na hale i ke ’kua—\n\nO Kini Akua o Wai-mea,\n\nO ka Lehu Akua o Maná.\n\nKini wale Wai-mea\n\nI ka pihe o ke ’kua o Uli, e.\n\nPo wale Mahiki;\n\nA ia Mahiki ke uwá la no, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nScattered through Puna, scattered through Puna,\n\nIs the rout of the vagrant imps:\n\nThey swarm in the dwellings of men;\n\nThe houses are lousy with demons—\n\nWai-mea’s myriads of godlings,\n\nThy four hundred thousand, Maná.\n\nWai-mea thrills with the snarl of witch-gods:\n\nNight’s shadows brood over Mahiki;\n\nThe uproar keeps on in Mahiki.\n\nHiiaka, having thus far, as it would seem, journeyed along the western coast of Hawaii, now loops back in her course and travels in the direction of Hilo by the way of Hamakua, for the seeming purpose of completing her work of extermination. Like a wise general, she would leave no enemies in her rear.\n\nWhen they came into the neighborhood of Wahine-oma’o’s home, that girl spoke up and said, “I think we had better take another road. If we keep to this one, which passes by my door, my parents, who will be watching for me, will see me and will want me to remain with them.” This she said by reason of her great desire to continue in Hiiaka’s company. True enough, when they caught sight of her old home, there sat her mother Puna-hoa and her father Kai-pala-oa. [56]\n\n“There they sit,” said the girl. “If they recognize me they will want to keep me.”\n\nHiiaka bade Wahine-oma’o fall in behind her, hunch her shoulders, bend forward her head and walk with short infirm steps in imitation of an old woman. Hiiaka, on coming close to the old people, using the language of song, asked directions as to the road:\n\nE Puna-hoa i Kai-pala-oa,\n\nI na maka o Nana-kilo ma\n\nE nonoho mai la, e.\n\nAuhea ka ala, e?\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nO Puna-hoa and Kai-pala-oa,\n\nYou with the clear-scanning eyes,\n\nSitting at rest before me,\n\nPoint me out now the road.\n\n“The road is plain enough; you are taking the right way.… We are looking at that young woman of your party—she has such a strong resemblance to our missing daughter, save her way of shuffling and holding her head.”\n\nOn reaching the outskirts of the village of Hilo, Hiiaka found a rickety foot-bridge, consisting of a single narrow and wobbly plank, liable to turn at every step and precipitate the passenger into the tumbling waters below—and this was the only passage across the rocky chasm of the Wai-luku1 river. This precarious crossing was the work of two sorcerers, degenerate nondescripts, who had the audacity to levy toll for the use of their bridge, in default of which the traveler suddenly found himself precipitated into the raging water. By virtue of their necromantic powers, they had the presumption to claim spiritual kinship with Hiiaka, a bond the woman could not absolutely repudiate.\n\n“Here comes our mo’o-puna,”2 called out Pili-a-mo’o to his companion.\n\n“Well, what of it? She will have to pay her fare the same as anyone else,” replied Noho-a-mo’o. “Only on that condition shall she cross by our bridge.”\n\nOn Hiiaka’s attempting to cross without paying toll, the two [57]sorcerers would, following their own practice, have disarranged the treacherous plank and precipitated her and her party into the raging stream.\n\n“Well said,” Noho-a-mo’o replied; “provided she will consent to it.”\n\nHiiaka now called to them in the language of song:\n\nKahuli-huli,3 e-e,\n\nKa papa o Wai-luku!\n\nKahuli o Apua,\n\nHa’a mai o Mau-kele:\n\nHe ole ke kaha kuai ai, e-e!\n\nHomai ka ai,\n\nHomai ho’i ka ai, e-e!\n\nI ai’na aku ho’i, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nCranky, cranky the bridge,\n\nBridge across the Wai-luku!\n\nUpset is Apua;\n\nMaukele declares that\n\nThe barter of food is naught.\n\nGive us then of your food;\n\nGive us something to eat;\n\nLet us partake of your meat.\n\nTo this unusual demand they replied, “Indeed, do you imagine we will do any such thing as that? It is not for us to give to you; you must give us the fare before you cross on our bridge. We don’t give away things for nothing.”\n\nHiiaka replied by repeating her request in nearly the same words:\n\nKa-huli-huli, e-e,\n\nKa papa o Wai-luku.\n\nHe ole ke kaha kuai i’a, e! [58]\n\nHo-mai ka i’a;\n\nHo-mai ana, ho’i, ka i’a,\n\nI ai’na aku, ho’i, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nUnstable the bridge,\n\nBridge that spans the Wai-luku.\n\nThis barter of fish is a fraud.\n\nGive us of your fish;\n\nGrant us kindly some meat;\n\nGive us something to eat.\n\nHiiaka repeated her demands in varying form with no other effect than to make the toll-keepers more stubborn in their ridiculous demands. Not even when Hiiaka, as if to cap the climax of their absurdity, ended her demand with this ironical request:\n\nHo-mai, ho’i, ka wai, e;\n\nI inu ia aku, ho’i, e!!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nGive us of this water,\n\nGive us water to drink!\n\nHiiaka now openly denounced the two sorcerers as being simply mo’o in disguise, entirely wanting in those generous feelings that belong to godhood. “These creatures are simply mo’o. If I attack them, they will run for their lives.”\n\nThe people, failing to recognize Hiiaka as their deliverer, spiritless from long habituation to the fraudulent dominion of these imposters, fearful also of their vengeance, stoutly opposed Hiiaka, affirming that Pili-a-mo’o and Noho-a-mo’o were gods in reality, having great power and capable of doing many wonderful things. They declared their readiness to back their opinion with their property, yes, with their lives. They were at length persuaded, however, to accept as decisive the test proposed by Hiiaka, namely, that, if they fled when attacked, they should cease to be regarded as gods and should be dealt with as imposters. [59]\n\nTrue to Hiiaka’s prediction, the mo’o, in abject fear, turned and fled for their lives at her first threatening move and she now called upon the people to pursue and destroy them:\n\nKaumaha ka aï o Hilo i ka lehua\n\nMai ka Nuku-o-ka-manu4 a Puna-hoa, e.\n\nHoa ia iho la kau kanáka,\n\nI pa’a, o pahe’e auane’i;\n\nHina i ka Lua-kanáka.\n\nHe kanáka! He mau akua, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nThe neck of Hilo is heavy,\n\nWeighted with wreaths of lehua\n\nFrom Bird-beak clean down to the feet.\n\nCatch and bind these robbers of men;\n\nBind them fast, lest they slip through your hands\n\nAnd escape to the robber-pit—\n\nThese mortals, who call themselves gods!\n\nThe meaning of the figure in the first two verses, though obscure, seems to be that Hilo, so rich in natural beauty, is by that very fact robbed of the energy to defend herself and cast off the incubus that oppresses her.\n\nAs the creatures fled from Hiiaka’s pursuit, their human disguise fell from them and their real character as mo’o was evident.\n\n“We’ve committed a great blunder,” said Pili-a-mo’o to his mate. “It looks as if she meant to kill us. Let us apologize for our mistake and conciliate her with fair words.”\n\nNoho-a-mo’o agreed to this and, turning to Hiiaka, made this wheedling speech:\n\nKupu maikai a’e la\n\nKa wahine o ka Lua;\n\nUä ia iho la e ka ua,\n\nA kilinahe ka maka o ka lehua ma-uka.\n\nMa-uka oe e hele ai,\n\nMa ka hoauau wai.\n\nE waiho ke ala no maua,\n\nNo na kupuna, e.\n\n[60]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nShe has grown a fine figure,\n\nOur girl from the Fire-pit.\n\nThe plentiful rain has made bright\n\nThis bud of upland lehua.\n\nPray choose your road farther inland;\n\nThat way will offer good fordage—\n\nThis road leave to your ancient kin.\n\nHiiaka spared not, but pursued them to their cavernous rock-heaps in which they thought to hide themselves, and, having seized them, rent them asunder jaw from jaw. Thus did Hiiaka add one more to the score of her victories in the extermination of the mo’o.\n\nThe canoe-men, having used their utmost expedition in landing the freight and hauling up the canoe and getting it under cover, hastened to meet the two women at the rendezvous they had suggested. But they were nowhere to be found. They had disappeared as completely as though the earth had swallowed them up. When Pi’i-ke-a-nui asked the people of the village as to the whereabouts of the two young women who had just now landed as passengers from the canoe, they one and all denied having set eyes upon them.\n\nHiiaka had planned a visit with her sister Kapo; but, on reaching Wailuku, the house was empty; Kapo and her husband Pua-nui had but just started to make a ceremonious call on Ole-pau, a famous chief of the district. The receding figure of Kapo was already hazy in the distance, so that it seemed more than doubtful if the words of Hiiaka’s message reached the ears for which they were intended:\n\nHe ahui hala1 ko Kapo-ula-kina’u,2\n\nKo ka pili kaumaha;\n\nI ka pili a hala, la, ha-la!\n\nHala olua, aohe makamaka o ka hale\n\nE kipa aku ai la ho’i i ko hale,\n\nI kou hale, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nThe clustered hala is Kapo’s shield,\n\nAn omen portending disaster. [68]\n\nThe traveler came in your absence;\n\nBoth of you gone, no one at home—\n\nNo lodge for the traveler within,\n\nNo hospitality within!\n\nHere is another version of this mele by Hiiaka (furnished by Pelei-oholani). As the version previously given is confessedly imperfect, in part conjectural, there having been several hiatuses in the text, I think it well to give an authorized version, though very different:\n\nHe ahui hala na ka makani:3\n\nHala ka ua,4 noho i na pali, e—\n\nI ka pali aku i Pua-lehei,5 e.\n\nLoli iho la, pulu elo i ka ua, e.\n\nAohe makamaka e kipa aku ai\n\nI kou hale, e;\n\nE noho ana i ke kai o Kapeku;\n\nE hoolono i ka uwalo, e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nA hala bunch, snatched by the wind\n\nThat blows from the medicine man,\n\nPushing the rain to Pua-lehei:\n\nCold is the traveler and soaking wet,\n\nNo friend to give welcome and cheer;\n\nHouse empty—gone to the seashore;\n\nNo one to heed my entreaty.\n\nAs Hiiaka passed along the cliff that overlooks the wave-swept beach at Hono-lua, a pitiful sight met her eye, the figure of a woman crippled from birth—without hands. Yet, in spite of her maimed condition, the brave spirit busied herself gathering shell-fish; and when a tumbling wave rolled across the beach she made herself a partner in its sport and gleefully retreated, skipping and dancing to the words of a song: [69]\n\nAloha wale ka i’a lamalama o ku’u aina, la,\n\nKa i’a kahiko pu no me ka wahine.\n\nLilo ke hoa, ko’eko’e ka po;\n\nAkahi kona la o aloha mai, e-e!\n\nAloha Kona, ku’u aina i ka pohu, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nHow dear the torch-caught fish of my home-land,\n\nThe fish embraced by the women folk!\n\nGone one’s companion, chill grows the night:\n\nLove cheered for a day, then flew away.—\n\nOh Kona, thou land of peace and of calm!\n\nSearch for the hidden meaning of this oli has brought out a marvellous diversity of opinion. The chief difficulty lies in the interpretation of the second verse: Ka i’a kahiko pu no me ka wahine, and centers in the expression kahiko pu. One able critic finds in it an allusion to the coöperation of women with the men in the work of fishing. Kahiko is a word of dignity meaning finely apparelled. The addition of the preposition pu amplifies it and gives it almost the meaning of wrapped together. It seems probable also that the word i’a, literally fish, is to be taken in an esoteric sense as a euphemism for man. Putting this interpretation upon it, the meaning of the expression kahiko pu becomes clear as being wrapped together, as in the sexual embrace.\n\nWahine-oma’o was greatly fascinated by the pathos and romance of the situation and declared she would like to have her for an aikane, an intimate friend.\n\nHiiaka replied, “Maimed folk seem to be very numerous in these parts.”\n\nThe maimed girl kept up her fishing, her light-hearted dancing and singing:\n\nUa ino Hono-kohau; he Ulu-au nui ka makani;\n\nKe ha’iha’i la i ka lau o ka awa.\n\nLa’i pono ai ke kai o Hono-lua,\n\nE hele ka wahine i ke kapa kahakai,\n\nKu’i-ku’i ana i ka opihi,\n\nWa’u-wa’u ana i kana limu,\n\nO Mana-mana-ia-kaluea,\n\nKa wahine ua make, e-e!\n\n[70]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nRough weather at Hono-kohau;\n\nThe Ulu-au blows a gale;\n\nIt snaps off the leaves of the awa,\n\nBut the sea lies calm at Hono-lua\n\nAnd the woman can fish along shore,\n\nPounding her shell-fish, rubbing her moss—\n\nThis maiméd girl Kalu-é-a,\n\nThe girl that is dead.\n\nAs the wild thing ran from the dash of an incoming wave, by some chance the gourd that held her fish slipped from her and the retreating water carried it beyond her reach, a loss that she lightly touched in her song:\n\nHa’a ka lau o ka i’a;\n\nHa’a ka lima i ke po’i;\n\nHa’a ke olohe6 i ke awakea:\n\nKina’i aku la i ke kai, la.\n\nLilo ka i’a, lilo ka i’a\n\nI ka welelau o ku’u lima,\n\nA lilo, e-e!\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nMy fish are adance on the waves:\n\nMy hand just danced from the basket:\n\nThe skilled6 one dances at noontide\n\nAnd deafens the roar of ocean.\n\nGone are my fish, lost out of hand,\n\nSnatched clean away from my hand-stumps;\n\nThey are gone, gone, gone from my hand!\n\nThere was a shark lurking in the ocean and when Mana-mana-ia-kalu-ea saw it she uttered a little song:\n\nO ka i’a iki maka inoino,\n\nIhu me’ume’u o ka moana;\n\nKe a’u lele ’ku o kai,\n\nI ka puo’a o kai uli, e.\n\nAuwé, pau au i ka manó nui, e!!\n\n[71]\n\nTRANSLATION\n\nLittle fish with wicked eye;\n\nSnub-nosed fish that swims the deep;\n\nSworded fish that darts and stabs\n\nAmong the blue sea coral-groves—\n\nAlas, the shark has done for me,\n\nThe mighty shark, mine enemy!\n\nWahine-oma’o could not repress her admiration for the girl and her desire to have her as an aikane (an intimate friend); and she was full of regret that their presence on the cliff had driven away the fish and interfered with the girl’s occupation.\n\n“The figure you see dancing down there is not a human body; it is only a spirit,” said Hiiaka.\n\n“What!”\n\n“Yes, only a spirit, and I’ll prove it in this way,” she plucked a hala drupe from a wreath about her neck;—“I’ll throw this down to her; and if she flies away, it will prove she is a spirit; but, if she does not disappear, it will prove her to be a human body.”\n\nHiiaka threw the hala, and the moment the poor soul saw it fall in front of her she vanished out of sight. But in a short time she reappeared and, seizing the hala with her fingerless hand-stumps, she pressed it to her nose with an extravagant display of fondness and, looking up to Hiiaka, she chanted:\n\nNo luna ka hala, e;\n\nOnini pua i’a i ke kai.\n\nNo Pana-ewa ka hala e;\n\nNo Puna ka wahine—\n\nNo ka Lu"
