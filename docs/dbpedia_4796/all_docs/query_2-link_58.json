        "text": "Title : An Island View, in Atooi\n\nSize: 21in x 15in (535mm x 385mm)\n\nCondition: (A+) Fine Condition\n\nDate : 1784\n\nRef #: 82065\n\nDescription:\n\nThis large original 1st edition copper-plate engraved antique print of a village the Hawaiian Island of Kauai (Atooi) visited by Captain Cook in 1778 was drawn by the official artist on Cooks crew, John Webber, and later published for the 1784 1st edition and official British Admiralty sanctioned account of Captain Cookâ€™s third and final voyage along with that of Cooks successor Capt. James King......\n\nA Voyage to the Pacific Ocean. Undertaken, by the Command of his Majesty, for making Discoveries in the Northern Hemisphere. To determine The Position and Extent of the West Side of North America; its Distance from Asia; and the Practicability of a Northern Passage to Europe. Performed under the direction of Captains Cook, Clerke, and Gore, In His Majesty\\'s Ships the Resolution and Discovery. In the Years 1776, 1777, 1778, 1779, and 1780. In Three Volumes. Vol. I and II written by James Cook, F.R.S. Vol. III by Captain James King, LL.D. and F.R.S\n\nCaptain Cook arrived at the island of Atooi (Kauai) Hawaii on the 19th of January, 1778 and stayed until 23rd January. On the 21st January, Cook accompanied by John Webber, proceeded inland from their beach side anchorage to Waimea, on the south coast of Kauai. Their intention was to examine elevated objects visible from the ship. It proved to be a morai, or temple similar to ones they had seen in Tahiti and other South Pacific islands. This structure was nearly 20-feet high and covered in a thin, light-grey cloth, which likely had ceremonial significance. The temple rested on a platform and consisted of thousands of rough-edged lava rock piled in a tight, mortarless fashion. In the center is the spindly-legged oracle tower, where the priest (kahuna) might seek counsel or pray. Carved figures with tapa and leaf offerings are seen outside thatched huts topped with pili, the tall grass that grew throughout the lowlands. In his journal, Cook took particular note of several stone objects he had observed:\n\nCooks Journals - January 21, 1778\n\n...........about the middle of the Morai, there were three of these places in line. We were told three chiefs had been buried there, and before them was another that was oblong. This they called Tanga (taboo or kapu in Hawaiian) and gave us clearly to understand that three human sacrifices had been buried there, that is, one at the burial of each chief.\n\nGeneral Definitions:\n\nPaper thickness and quality: - Heavy and stable\n\nPaper color : - off white\n\nAge of map color: -\n\nColors used: -\n\nGeneral color appearance: -\n\nPaper size: - 21in x 15in (535mm x 385mm)\n\nPlate size: - 21in x 15in (535mm x 385mm)\n\nMargins: - Min 1/2in (12mm)\n\nImperfections:\n\nMargins: - Light soiling in margins\n\nPlate area: - None\n\nVerso: - None"
