You may also fly into Honolulu International Airport (HNL) on Oahu first and then head to Kauai.

After a long day, watch the sunset from the comforts of your resort and recharge for another day of discovery on Kauai.\n\nAbout Kauai\n\nKauai is Hawaii’s fourth largest island and is sometimes called the “Garden Isle,” which is an entirely accurate description. The oldest and northernmost island in the Hawaiian chain is draped in emerald valleys, sharp mountain spires and jagged cliffs, aged by time and the elements. Centuries of growth have formed tropical rainforests, forking rivers and cascading waterfalls. Some parts of Kauai are only accessible by sea or air, revealing views beyond your imagination.\n\nBeyond Kauai’s dramatic beauty, the island is home to a variety of outdoor activities. Kayak the Wailua River. Snorkel on Poipu Beach. Hike the trails of Kokee State Park. Even go ziplining above Kauai’s lush valleys. But it is the island’s laid-back atmosphere and rich culture found in its small towns and along its one-lane bridges that make it truly timeless. Make your escape to Kauai and discover the undeniable allure of Kauai.\n\nKauai Geography & Maps\n\nKauai FAQs\n\n●Do I need my passport to get to Kauai?Since Hawaii is the 50th state, you won’t need to bring your passport unless you’re visiting from outside the United States or traveling to another country after Hawaii.\n\n●When is a good time to visit Kauai?Anytime of year is a good time to visit Kauai.

Ocean temperatures are also perfect ranging from 71 to 81 degrees year round.\n\nKauai offers seven distinct microclimates, from lush interior spots to arid areas on the West Side. Mount Waialeale (elevation 5,148 ft) is at the heart of Kauai's uninhabited interior and is a quintessential rainforest with over 400-inches of rain per year. The rain that falls around Mt. Waialeale generally does not affect the coastal parts of the island, which get far less rain than the central spots (as little as 18-inches a year in western areas). Much of Kauai's rainfall is a nightly occurrence, and the rain showers that do occur are almost always brief. When you do see rain, wait for the beautiful rainbows that follow.\n\nKauai History\n\nKauai is the oldest island in the Hawaiian chain. Kauai’s distant past is filled with legends, the most well known tells of the Menehune, a mythical race of small people talented in construction and engineering who created Kauai’s aqueducts and fishponds, often in a single night. They were believed to have lived in the woods and were shunned by Hawaiians. Today, you can still see their work at Hawaiian fishponds like Alekoko, known as Menehune Fishpond, near Lihue.\n\nIn 1778, British explorer Captain James Cook landed in Kauai’s Waimea Bay for the first time. Cook’s discovery of what he called the “Sandwich Isles,” named after the Earl of Sandwich, introduced Hawaii to the world. A statue of Captain Cook stands today in Waimea Town.\n\nDuring this era of western discovery, King Kamehameha I was attempting to unify the Hawaiian Islands under his rule. Kauai and the small neighboring island of Niihau (part of Kauai county) were the only islands to deter his efforts. Eventually, Kauai’s King Kaumualii decided to peacefully unite with Kamehameha and join the rest of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nIn 1835 Old Koloa Town opened its first sugar mill. Follow the Koloa Heritage Trail in Old Koloa Town today to learn about Kauai’s plantation past. On the North Shore, tour the Waioli Mission House, on the National Register of Historic Places, to get a glimpse of missionary life in the 19th century. You can also visit the Kauai Museum for a fascinating exploration of exhibits, artifacts and murals portraying the history of Kauai, its people and its unique culture."
