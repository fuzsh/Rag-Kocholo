Supermarkets in Salamanca will have every essential toiletry item you need, and most students come to Spain with dreams of returning with their suitcases filled with the latest European fashions. Anything you pack, you will have to carry at one time or another, so save yourself the hassle of traveling with a full wardrobe by packing the bare minimum and purchasing non-essentials once you arrive. If you have a favorite hair product or contact lens solution, bring these with you as they may be harder to find in Spain.\n\nFall/Spring\n\nI recommend bringing one to two weeks’ worth of clothing (for warm and cold weather) if you are studying for a semester or longer. This provides you some time to settle down and acclimate yourself before you feel the need to expand your wardrobe. Make sure any clothing you pack can be included in more than one outfit so you do not tire of your clothing selection too quickly. If you arrive in the winter, I would recommend bringing an overcoat, gloves, hats, scarves, and items that you can layer with you. I also frequently layered tights or leggings under my jeans for the colder months. If you are arriving in the warmer months, you should have plenty of time to stock up on fashionable cold weather attire and accessories before the weather turns. You may want to include some more summer clothing instead of bringing heavy winter wear.\n\nClothing:\n\n___ 1 Raincoat\n\n___ 1 Overcoat/Jacket (carry on)\n\n___ 1 Pair sunglasses\n\n___ 7-10 Shirts (tees, sweaters, blouses, etc.)\n\n___ 3-5 Undershirts\n\n(They make re-wearing clothing much more bearable!)\n\n___ 3-5 Pants/Jeans/Skirts/Shorts\n\n___ 7-14 Pair underwear\n\n___ 3-5 Bras (if applicable)\n\n___ 1 Pair walking shoes (wear them on your flight)\n\n___ 1-2 Extra pair of shoes (comfortable, dressier options)\n\n___ 1 Belt\n\n___ 1 Scarf\n\n___ 1 Pair of gloves\n\n___ 1 Swimsuit\n\n___ 7 Pair of Socks\n\nSummer\n\nIf you are studying abroad for the summer, only bring 1 week’s worth of clothing. You will certainly have the opportunity to buy more when you arrive, but there is no reason to bring a large amount of clothing when you will only be staying for 4-6 weeks. Summer in Salamanca is hot, so be sure to pack clothing made of light, breathable fabrics, like cotton. It can get cool in the evening, so pack a light jacket as well.\n\nClothing:\n\n___ 1 Raincoat/Jacket (carry on)\n\n___ 1 Pair sunglasses\n\n___ 5-7 Shirts (tees, tank tops, blouses, etc.)\n\n___ 3-5 Undershirts\n\n(They make re-wearing clothing much more bearable!)\n\n___ 3-5 Skirts/Shorts\n\n___ 1 Pair of Jeans/Pants\n\n___ 7 Pair underwear\n\n___ 2-3 Bras (if applicable)\n\n___ 1 Pair walking shoes (wear them on your flight)\n\n___ 1 Extra pair of shoes (comfortable, dressier options)\n\n___ 1 Belt\n\n___ 1-2 Swimsuits\n\n___ 7 Pair of Socks\n\nSemester/Summer/Academic Year\n\nEssentials\n\nToiletries:\n\n___ 1 Razor\n\n___ Travel-sized shaving cream\n\n___ 1 Toothbrush\n\n___ Travel-sized toothpaste\n\n___ Travel-sized Shampoo & ConditionerLaundry:\n\n___ Travel-sized laundry detergent/stain pen*\n\n___ Travel clothesline*\n\n___ Dental floss\n\n___ Cosmetics\n\n___ Comb/brush\n\n___ Tweezers\n\n___ Nail clippers\n\n___ Feminine care products (if applicable)\n\nOther supplies:\n\n___ Battery operated travel alarm clock\n\n___ Extra batteries\n\n___ Money belt/purse**\n\n___ Swiss army knife (Be sure to put this in your checked luggage!)\n\n___ Eye mask & ear plugs (Hostel & long flight survival gear. Carry on.)\n\n___ 1 or 2 power adapters\n\n___ Small flashlight\n\n___ Eyeglasses and replacement contacts (if applicable)\n\nHealth & First Aid:\n\n___ Pain reliever\n\n___ Adhesive bandages (Bandaids)\n\n___ Antiseptic cream\n\n___ Lip balm\n\n___ Stomach pain reliever\n\n___ Allergy relief medicine\n\n___ Q-tips\n\nIdentification: (Scan copies of these and email them to yourself so that they are accessible from anywhere on the internet.)\n\n___ Passport & copies\n\n___ Driver’s license\n\n___ USC Student ID\n\n___ ISIC Student ID\n\n___ Health insurance cards\n\nOptional\n\nOptional:\n\n___ 1 Travel umbrella\n\n___ Dual voltage hair dryer\n\n___ Dual voltage hair straightener/curling iron\n\n___ Microfiber travel towel\n\n___ Laptop computer and charger\n\n___ Digital camera and charger\n\n___ Digital camera USB connector\n\n___ 1 Power converter\n\n___ Inflatable travel pillow\n\n*Although your host family/residencía is responsible for your laundry, you may find it helpful to have some detergent to wash your own underwear (if you prefer) or to remove stains before they set into your clothing. Detergent and a travel clothesline (with either hooks or suction cups on the ends) are also important things to have if you plan on traveling for an extended period of time before or after your study program.\n\n**Most students do not make use of a money belt, purse, or pouch during their stay in Salamanca, but it is a good idea to have a safe place to store important documents, credit cards, and cash on your person while traveling. Money pouches can be found in many travel stores like those in large airports and are a good investment, especially if you plan to be staying in hostels during your time in Europe.\n\nLuggage\n\nMost airlines let you check one bag for free for transatlantic flights. I would recommend only bringing one checked back, one carry-on bag, and personal item (laptop case or backpack) on your flight over. This provides you the opportunity to purchase a second bag in Spain if you would like to bring home clothing and souvenirs. It also makes it easier for you to navigate unfamiliar airports and train or bus stations upon your arrival.\n\nMake sure any large luggage you bring has the ability to roll; otherwise, you may feel akin to a pack mule navigating the streets. Remember: you are responsible for carrying/transporting everything you bring, so you want to make sure that you are able to move with your luggage easily enough that you do not become a target for pickpockets. You should also ensure that each piece of luggage has identifying information on the outside and inside of the bag, but that the information on the outside is concealed so that your airport neighbors do not learn your address or phone number.\n\nLaptops\n\nIf you are studying abroad for a semester or longer, you should go ahead and bring your laptop. When I studied in Salamanca in Spring 2010, most students in the modular program brought laptops with them to class on a regular basis. There is wireless internet access in the Cursos Internacionales classroom building and around campus. If you have internet access in your residence or host family’s house, a laptop is a great resource for communicating inexpensively with your loved ones at home via email or Skype. Spain’s time zone is six hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time, so if you want to chat with friends and family after they get home from work or school, you may need to wait until around 11:00 PM (5:00 PM EST).\n\nAlthough computers can provide access to family members or friends in the states, take care not to become so dependent on communicating with people back home that you miss out on experiences in Spain. My best friend studied abroad in Austria the same semester I was in Spain, and her roommate easily spent four hours a day Skyping her boyfriend and family. She missed out on wonderful experiences and meeting incredible people because she was too busy plugged in to her computer at home. Try to limit the time you spend talking to people back in the States on a daily basis: this will give you even more to have left to tell them about when you return!\n\nIf you do not bring a laptop, most program providers have computers in their offices for student use. (You can also use these to print important documents like boarding passes.) There is a computer lab in the San Boal classroom building, but many of those computers were slow and out-of-date when I was there.\n\nElectricity\n\nElectronic devices in the United States and Europe run on different voltages, so it is very important that you ensure each of the electronic devices you bring with you to Europe is dual voltage (meaning it can run on the US 110 volt power or Europe’s 220 volt system). Most computers are equipped to run on either and will automatically identify whether they are connected to an outlet running on 110 or 220 voltage. Double check to make sure this is true about your computer. If so, you will only need an adapter to attach to your power cord to fit Europe’s outlets. Spain and a few surrounding countries have a two-pronged outlet, although other countries (like the UK and Ireland) have different outlets (even though they still run on 220 voltage). If you plan on traveling throughout Europe, I recommend purchasing a universal adapter pack, which should include all the different connectors you will need.\n\nUnless you own or plan to buy a dual voltage hair dryer or straightener, you should leave your American products at home and buy them when you arrive in Spain. Straighteners that only have a 110-voltage option cannot be plugged into a converter, as they have electronic components that may be damaged if connected to a power-converting device. Your 110-voltage hair dryer can be plugged into a converter, but my hair dryer always tripped the circuit breaker in my residencía, so it is not the best option, especially if you are going to be in Salamanca for more than a month.\n\nRelated Posts: El Primer Día\n\nFreak Out Moment!\n\nThe circuit breaker flipped. What do I do?\n\nMy first night in Salamanca, I was placed alone on the fifth floor of my residencía, with no clue where my host parents lived in the building and no cell phone in my possession. Jet-lagged and unable to sleep, I heard a clicking noise and suddenly found myself the only person on the fifth floor and in the dark. I kept myself awake that night thinking of the murderer who surely cut the power and was coming to get me. The next morning I told the family who owned my residencía that there was no electricity upstairs, and they showed me where the circuit breaker was hidden behind a painting. Some of the older buildings have finicky wiring systems that especially do not appreciate high wattage hair dryers; I probably had to reset the breaker over 25 times during my 16 weeks in Salamanca. Be sure to ask your host family, landlord, or fellow residents where the circuit breaker is and how to use it upon your arrival to save yourself the hassle of feeling around for it in the dark. (This is also why you should bring a small flashlight, in case the power does go out.)\n\nDebit/Credit Cards\n\nDebit and credit cards are essential in case of emergencies when traveling. You will need to contact your bank and/or credit card provider prior to leaving in order to inform them that you will be using the cards(s) outside of the country. If you do not let them know, it is possible they may freeze your accounts in order to protect you from identity theft. When I called, my bank wanted a list of every country I planned on visiting. I recommend telling your bank/credit card provider every country you think you might like to visit, in order to avoid the hassle of calling them back from Europe every time your travel itinerary is updated. My bank could only place notifications on my account for up to three months at a time, so I needed to call them back halfway through my stay in Europe to remind them that I would continue to use my card abroad. If you need to do this, I recommend using Skype credit, which provides an inexpensive way for you to call numbers in the US.\n\nMost debit and credit cards charge a fee for international transactions. My bank charged 3% per transaction and my credit card charged 2%. Check with your bank and credit card provider for their policies on international transactional fees. You will incur these whether you are paying for something in-store with a credit card or taking money out of an ATM. Most ATMs also charge per-transaction fees, meaning it is better to take out more money at one time than less over the course of many withdrawals.\n\nIf you choose to use your debit or credit card in-store, most cashiers will ask you for your passport. Since carrying your passport around with you on a day-to-day basis is inadvisable, I always showed them my driver’s license instead.\n\nExchanging Money\n\nIt is advisable to exchange some dollars for euros prior to your arrival in Spain. Most banks, if given advance notice, are able to exchange currency. Most international airports also offer an exchange service, whereby they will convert dollars to euros for a fee. Some services will not charge a fee if you exchange more than €500, but it is inadvisable to carry this much cash on your person. I exchanged $200 in the airport and carried the cash in my money belt until reaching my residencía.\n\nRelated Posts: El Primer Día\n\nSmart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)\n\nThe Department of State offers US citizens the opportunity to register their trips through STEP in order to keep American Embassies apprised of US citizens in the area. Enrollment in STEP also registers travelers for email alerts and warnings specific to their location. You can easily update your itinerary through STEP via the Department of State website at https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/ui/ .47\n\nInternational Cell Phones\n\nWhile in Spain, your cheapest option for cell phone communication is to purchase a pay-as-you-go phone from one of the local providers (such as Orange, Movistar, Vodafone, etc.). You can find mobile phones with sim cards for as inexpensive as €20-25. Your program provider may provide you with a mobile phone for a deposit, or they should be able to direct you to a service their students have used in the past. I had an Orange mobile phone, but most of the companies offer comparable rates and phones. All incoming calls are free to your Spanish cell phone, regardless of origin, even those from America. Most European cell phones operate on a removable SIM card that can be recharged with credit at cell phone, grocery, tobacco, and convenience stores.\n\nIf you decide to travel outside of Spain, but want to make use of your phone, you can buy a SIM card for that country for between €5-20. Each card is associated with its own phone number. Make sure your phone is “unlocked” when you purchase it so that you can use the SIM card of any carrier. Many wireless companies in Spain also operate in other European countries, so you could also keep your Spanish SIM for a while, but you will be charged more for roaming and may be unable to recharge your card in a foreign country.\n\nIn order to purchase a SIM card, you must show the cell phone provider your passport. Be sure to remember to bring it with you to the store!\n\nIt is difficult to purchase a Spanish phone while in the United States, unless you know someone who has already been to Spain or Europe who is willing to let you use his or her phone. It is possible that you may be able to find a European phone via eBay, but I would be skeptical of making such a purchase. I bought a cell phone in Vienna, Austria, to replace the phone I returned to my Spanish program provider and did not discover until I arrived in the Milan airport that I was unable to make outgoing calls.\n\nNevertheless, it is important that you have the ability to make phone calls upon your arrival in Spain in case something goes wrong. Using your credit card to pay for phone calls on pay phones in airports, bus stations, or train depots is a good way to have your credit card information stolen and charges made on your card upwards of $40. A friend of mine who visited over the summer used a pay phone in the Americas bus station in Madrid, Spain, and incurred multiple charges of $50 on both her debit and credit card, leading her to spend her entire two weeks in Spain sans either. Instead, you should bring an international calling card with you (ensure it can be used in Europe, not just America) with a list of important phone numbers (including your program provider and the US Embassy).\n\nEuropean mobile phones operate on a different frequency than phones in the US and Canada. Unless you have a special global phone or Blackberry device, your current cell phone will probably not work in Europe. Some phone companies offer international plans; however, these can become very expensive. I recommend you use your American phone only until you secure a Spanish cell phone. Check with your wireless provider to see what options they offer for international communication."
