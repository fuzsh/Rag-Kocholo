        "text": "Solo Female Travel Guide to Lisbon\n\nLisbon, Portugal – a city I could never stop coming back to! Back in late May/early June 2012, during a study abroad trip to Salamanca, Spain, I visited the color-filled city of Lisbon for the first time and fell in love with it! Between the architecture, food, people, history, art, beaches and hotels, it definitely is a thriving city that offers something for everyone! Overall, I couldn’t wait to go back Lisbon and experience the Portuguese capital during a solo travel experience, which was absolutely amazing, and provide you all with a detailed travel guide for your own trip.\n\nLisbon is a beautiful and safe city, making it perfect for solo female adventurers. Little did I know that after my first trip to Lisbon in 2012 it would be EXACTLY seven years later during the same weekend that I’d visit again! (It was during the United States Memorial Day Weekend.) This time around, I spent my first and last days in Lisbon and enjoyed the Portuguese coast in Peniche for a few days in between. It was an absolutely PERFECT solo trip and I fell in love with Lisbon and the country of Portugal all over again.\n\nLisbon is the capital and largest city of Portugal. It is a hilly coastal city that features pastel-colored houses, castles, museums and gorgeous beaches along the Atlantic Ocean. In this travel guide, discover all of the best things to see during a solo trip to Lisbon and read all about my experience staying at Bomporto Hotels.\n\n**Please note that this blog post uses affiliate links meaning that if you make a purchase via my affiliate link, I receive a small commission at no additional cost to you. I only promote and talk about products and services that I have used and like. During my trip to Lisbon in 2019, Bomporto Hotels hosted me for two nights. One night at The Lumiares Hotel and one night at The Vintage Hotel.\n\nPin the Below Image to Keep Handy\n\nGetting around Lisbon:\n\nDuring my first trip to Lisbon, I was with a study abroad group, so they had everything organized for us. We took a private coach from Salamanca, Spain to Lisbon. It took around 6 hours to get to and from each city. It is easy to get to Lisbon from anywhere in Portugal as well as Spain, which is the neighboring country on the Iberian Peninsula. There are buses, trains, flights and even Rideshare‘s you could book from cities like Porto, Peniche, Sevilla, Lagos, Malaga, Valencia, Barcelona, Madrid and so much more! You could also catch affordable flights to Lisbon from anywhere in Europe such as Paris, Munich, Rome, etc. Click here to discover the best ways to get to Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nOn my second trip to Lisbon, I flew from Newark Airport to Lisbon Portela Airport. Since New Jersey/New York is directly across the pond from Portugal, flights are usually affordable during the off-season. However, since I was traveling to Portugal in the month of May, during an American holiday weekend, I was unable to find a cheap, non-stop flight. On my way to Lisbon, I had a layover in Paris’ Orly Airport and on my way home, I had a layover in Madrid’s Barajas Adolfo Suárez Airport. It was okay though because I got to enjoy some of my favorite treats like macaroons from Lauderée in Paris and a bocadillo with jamon iberico in Madrid.\n\nWhen I finally arrived in Lisbon, I took a taxi from the airport to The Lumiares (where I stayed on my first night in Lisbon) and did the same thing from The Vintage (where I stayed on my last night in Lisbon) for my departure. Some other great ways to get around Lisbon is by Uber, taking the metro, the iconic Lisbon tram, a bike or a LimeBike/Scooter, renting a car, taking the ferry, utilizing the funicular or simply walking (which is what I mainly did in the city). Traveling in Portugal is very affordable, so I didn’t spend much on public transportation, food and excursions, which was very nice!\n\nStaying at Bomporto Hotels in Lisbon:\n\nDuring my time in Lisbon I stayed at two Bomporto Hotels. They are a Portuguese hotel group that includes two stylish luxury boutique hotels in Lisbon. On my first night in the Portuguese capital, I stayed at The Lumiares in the Bairro Alto area of Lisbon and during my last night, I stayed at The Vintage, which is located in Principé Real. Both hotels are perfectly situated in safe areas where you could find amazing restaurants and cafés, bars, shops and historical sites. Both hotels aren’t too far from the waterfront of the Rio Tejo Tagus River.\n\nStaying at The Lumiares in Lisbon:\n\nWhat I loved about staying at The Lumiares is that their rooms are apartment style. It was amazing feeling like I had my own apartment right in the heart of Bairro Alto! I had a one-bedroom apartment, but you could choose anywhere from a studio to a penthouse. Each room within The Lumiares offers a chic Portuguese flare with high ceilings, natural light and beautiful décor. My room also had two small balconies with views of the city. (It was perfect for watching the sunset in the evening and the shades also lifted with just a push of a button on the wall. It was so cool!)\n\nSince I was staying in a one-bedroom apartment-styled room, I had a bright and airy kitchen that included a fridge with refreshments, a Nespresso coffee machine, SMEG appliances such as a dishwasher, induction cooker, toaster and electric kettle. The living room area was beautifully furnished with comfortable couches, sofas, a carpet, pillows and wonderful décor. Both the living room and my bedroom had a cable television as well! My personal bedroom included a queen sized bed and trendy décor.\n\nThe room also included an en-suite bathroom with a rain shower, sink and toilet area with Claus Porto bathroom amenities as well as a bathrobe and slippers. These beautiful rooms also feature fully soundproof windows and Beats Pill+, so you could connect wirelessly from your mobile device and play music. In addition to the one-bedroom apartments, The Lumiares also has two-bedroom apartments, a penthouse, a loft style room as well as a studio.\n\nThe Lumiares itself was absolutely stunning! There is 24-hour room service available, a 24-hour reception and concierge, secure underground parking, free high-speed WiFi, a spa that offers amazing services, a 24-hour boutique gym (and there is also a personal trainer available), sauna and steam rooms, laundry services, a babysitting service as well as a café, restaurant and rooftop bar.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing night’s sleep and stay at The Lumiares!\n\nEating at The Lumiares in Lisbon:\n\nWhat is also nice about The Lumiares is that it offers two restaurants and a rooftop bar for all to enjoy (even if you aren’t staying at the hotel).\n\nSince I arrived at The Lumiares around dinnertime my first night, I couldn’t wait to check out the Lumi Rooftop Bar & Restaurant for dinner and drinks with a view. It was absolutely wonderful being welcomed with a complementary drink when I entered the rooftop bar. The bartender made me a signature cocktail that was absolutely delicious! I also enjoyed a Portuguese seafood rice dish that included clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari. It was absolutely delicious!\n\nOne of my favorite parts of staying at Bomporto Hotels is that both The Lumiares and The Vintage had an amazing breakfast! At The Lumiares, I enjoyed a lovely buffet breakfast that consisted of pastries, smoked salmon, cold cuts, fresh fruit, breads and croissants as well as an à la carte pancake and bacon dish. Everything was delicious! The breakfast at The Lumiares was located at Lumi Rooftop Bar & Restaurant and they also offer a selection of beverages from coffees and cappuccinos to mimosas and a variety of juices. In addition to Lumi Rooftop Bar & Restaurant, there is also a café called Mercado where you could grab sandwiches, simple Portuguese food and more.\n\nStaying at The Vintage in Lisbon:\n\nWhat is awesome about staying at The Vintage is that it is situated in Lisbon’s Principé Real where you could window shop at the infamous boutiques on the Avenida Liberdade, have fun at the local bars, enjoy authentic Portuguese food and view the galleries in the Bairro Alto and Chiado neighborhoods.\n\nThe rooms at The Vintage are spacious, comfortable and are filled with beautiful art deco touches with a vintage twist (hence the name of the hotel). During my last night in Lisbon, I stayed in the Executive Suite of The Vintage. The room offered a lot of space, included one SUPER COMFY double bed (pretty standard for a European hotel), a flat-screen television, a mini bar and Nespresso machine, a separate sitting area, beautiful photographs and decorations as well as gorgeous views of the wisteria outside.\n\nFeatured in the room is a sink area, a little shower room (that included a rain shower) as well as a toilet room. Also included in the room is a hairdryer, complementary toiletries and a bathrobe and slippers. In addition to the Executive Suite, The Vintage also offers a Deluxe room and a Superior room.\n\nJust like at The Lumiares, The Vintage offers 24-hour room service, 24-hour reception and concierge, free high-speed WiFi, a spa with multiple services, an indoor pool, a gym, meeting rooms, conference and event space, secure parking as well as a restaurant and three bars.\n\nEating at The Vintage in Lisbon:\n\nDuring my stay at The Vintage, one of the highlights was having my room located on the same floor as the Rooftop-Bar! The drinks at The Vintage are awesome and there is nothing better than enjoying it with a view. Prior to going to the bar, I was surprised with a glass of Port wine and two pastei de nata treats (Portuguese custard tarts) to welcome me.\n\nThe views of the Rooftop-Bar were spectacular! I was able to catch a pre-sunset above the red roofs of Lisbon, the nearby Tagus River as well as the beautiful castle of Sao Jorge. Since white sangria is more popular than red sangria in Portugal, I just had to get a refreshing glass of white sangria to enjoy the evening! I loved how the rooftop included comfortable lounge areas, a lush plant wall and a friendly bar staff. They also provided me with seasoned peanuts to enjoy with my drink. There are also two other bars in The Vintage – one located within The Vintage Restaurant and the other is in the lobby.\n\nThe Vintage Restaurant offers a great menu where you could find amazing Portuguese dishes along with a variety of other international meals. It is also where breakfast is held every morning. Just like at The Lumiares, The Vintage also offers an amazing breakfast with great buffet and à la carte options.\n\nA Luxury Solo Travel Guide to Lisbon:\n\nWander Aimlessly through the Pastel Streets:\n\nLisbon is the perfect city to get lost in as a solo female traveler. Not only is it extremely safe, the pastel architecture is definitely something to admire, there is amazing street art, stunning views of the river are featured throughout each area (there really is nothing more picturesque than gorgeous European buildings along the water) and there are so many great places to visit such as authentic restaurants and cafés, museums, stores, churches and more.\n\nIn this solo travel guide to Lisbon, I couldn’t exclude the amazing areas in Lisbon that you cannot miss out on visiting. Please see below:\n\nAlfama – With a vast history that dates back to the Moors, Alfama is known to have colorful houses along narrow, cobblestoned streets. If you are looking to get a traditional Portuguese experience during your time in Lisbon, it is recommended that you visit a Fado club. Fado is considered to be a melancholic music style of storytelling that was born in the Alfama area of Lisbon. (It is similar to flamenco.) Alfama is one of the best areas to really get a true taste of the culture in Lisbon. It is also a wonderful area to see the beautiful tile work.\n\nAvenida da Liberdade – Similar to 5th Avenue in New York, Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles and the Champs Élysées in Paris, the Avenida da Liberdade is where you could find Lisbon’s most high end and prestigious hotels and shops. It is definitely a beautiful street to walk through and window shop. I loved eyeing all of the beautiful wedding gowns in the bridal stores. They were absolutely gorgeous!\n\nBairro Alto – This fun area is known to have the best nightlife in Lisbon. It is in Bairro Alto where you could walk into small bars and nightclubs and dance until the sun rises. There are even a lot of bars thriving during the day in this area.\n\nBaixa – Known to be the heart of Lisbon, Baixa is where you could find the famous Praça do Comércio (the plaza filled with beautiful yellow buildings) that is pretty much the entrance into the city. Baixa may be a bit touristy, but it is super lively and definitely the best place to find great eateries, live entertainment, shops and historical sites.\n\nChiado – The Chiado area is known to have some pretty cool shopping, theaters, authentic restaurants and cute cafés. It is a very trendy area to visit no matter what time of the day it is.\n\nCais do Sodré – As the former red-light district of Lisbon, you could find some of Lisbon’s best nightclubs in this area.\n\nLisbon has become a popular city for travelers worldwide to visit. If you are looking to get away from the tourists and experience the local scene, it is best to head to the areas of Graça, Estrela and Principe Real.\n\nEat Your Way through Lisbon:\n\nPortuguese is one of my favorite cuisines and during your time in Lisbon, it is important to know where to go to get the best food in town! In this travel guide below, discover the best restaurants and foodie joints I ate at during my solo trip to Lisbon and some other great options to discover in the city:\n\nTimeOut Lisboa: As a concept created by scratch from the TimeOut Portugal team of publishers, this amazing market hall came to life in 2014 and includes 24 restaurants, 8 bars, numerous shops and a high-end music venue. I absolutely love places like this and it reminded me of Pike Place Market in Seattle and Reading Terminal in Philadelphia!\n\nTimeOut Market is known for having the best meat, fish, fruit and flowers in the city. It includes everything from traditional Portuguese food to artisanal pizza and includes unique concepts such as a croquette stand to an Aperol Spritz bar. You could also visit amazing stands that offer crafted burgers, gelato, sushi, baked goods, oysters and so much more! A trip to Lisbon is not complete without coming to TimeOut Market. I came to this amazing food hall for lunch and it did not disappoint! Since I love croquettes, I got three delicious ones from Croqueteria that consisted of cuttlefish and squid ink, chorizo and cod as well as tuna and sun-dried tomatoes. They were all amazing, but the cuttlefish and squid ink were my favorite! I savored this all with a refreshing Portuguese cider. Afterwards, I enjoyed a salted caramel gelato at Santini. Click here to discover more about what TimeOut Market offers in Lisbon.\n\nIn addition to Lisbon, you could find TimeOut Markets in Miami, Brooklyn, Montréal and Chicago. TimeOut Market will also be opening up locations in Dubai, London and Prague in the near future.\n\nCervejaria Ribadouro: For dinner, the staff at The Vintage recommended an amazing seafood restaurant for me to eat at. Cervejaria Ribadouro was where I had one of the BEST meals of my life! I enjoyed a delicious Port wine with seafood mariscos, which included shrimp and lobster meat with a juicy seafood sauce. It also came with white rice and amazing fried bread that tasted well with the seafood and sauce. In addition, I also got a dessert, which consisted of a rich chocolate mousse.\n\nWhat was great about Cervejaria Ribadouro was that it was only a five minute walk from The Vintage! It also dates back to 1947 when Ribadouro Brewery opened its doors. Nowadays, it offers fresh seafood made from art and mastery. I couldn’t recommend this wonderful restaurant more to those visiting Lisbon!\n\nHere is a list of other restaurants and cafés worth checking out in Lisbon:\n\nBistro 100 Maneiras\n\nPalacio de Chiado\n\nCopenhagen Coffee Lab + Bakery\n\nVisit the Castelo de Sao Jorge:\n\nDuring a solo trip to Lisbon, I recommend visiting the castle of the city – the Castelo de Sao Jorge. This national monument offers 360-degree views of Lisbon and occupies the area of the old medieval citadel and also consists of the castle, ruins of the former royal palace and part of the neighborhood for the elite. I loved strolling around the castle and going back in time. One thing to note is that it does get crowded with both tourists and Portuguese school kids who are on field trips.\n\nThe Castelo de Sao Jorge started its importance after Dom Afonso Henriques conquered Lisbon in 1147. He became the first king of Portugal and then the castle began its golden age as home for royalty. It also became a place that held festivities as well as coronations. Later on, when Portugal became part of the Spanish Crown in 1580, the castle took on a military purpose through the early 20th century.\n\nOverall, visiting the Castelo de Sao Jorge is a wonderful and educational experience for all. Plus, you may spot some peacocks when you are there!\n\nPretend You’re in a Fairytale in Sintra:\n\nDuring my first trip to Lisbon, I visited the fairytale town of Sintra. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to make it back during my recent trip in May 2019, but I wish I would’ve. This enchanting UNESCO World Heritage Site is praised by many worldwide and is considered one of the most beautiful places in the world.\n\nHere is a list of what you must see during a day trip to Sintra from Lisbon:\n\nPalácio Nacional de Sintra\n\nQuinta da Regaleira\n\nPalácio Nacional da Pena\n\nParque da Pena\n\nPalácio & Parque de Monserrate\n\nMuseu das Artes de Sintra\n\nIn addition to including beautiful palaces and castles in this solo travel guide, I also have to mention that Sintra also has a breathtaking coastline northwest of Lisbon that cannot be missed. Cabo da Roca is a wonderful place to hike, take in the beautiful seaside nature and relax.\n\nEnjoy a Beach Day at a Lisbon Beach Town:\n\nIf you are a beach person, you definitely won’t go wrong during your time in Portugal. No matter where you go to the beach along the Portuguese coastline, it will be absolutely breathtaking. During my first trip to Lisbon, I visited the seaside town of Cascais.\n\nThis charming fishing town is filled with colorful houses, cobblestone alleyways with great shops, restaurants and bars and it included a beach to sunbathe and go swimming. I had such a blast with my study abroad friends there and even enjoyed an amazing crab dip at a local café.\n\nEven though I didn’t have time to visit anywhere else, a few other great beach towns around Lisbon are Serra de Sintra (which I mention above), Costa da Caparica and Serra da Arrábida.\n\nThe Algarve is an incredible destination for those looking for a beach trip a few hours away from the capital city. Discover the ultimate Algarve itinerary.\n\nEven though there are plenty of incredible beaches to enjoy in the summer, winter in Lisbon is also a blast! It’s the perfect time to check out the city’s famous landmarks without crowds and everything is much more affordable.\n\nLearn Portuguese History in Belém:\n\nAnother place you cannot miss out on during your time in Lisbon is visiting the district of Belém. This stunning area features iconic landmarks and historical locations that leaves visitors awestruck!\n\nI visited Belém during my first time in Lisbon and I loved exploring this area! Belém is situated on the Tagus River and it is a major maritime port. Below is a simple travel guide to the Belém area during a solo trip in Lisbon:\n\nTorre de Belém:\n\nOne of the coolest towers I’ve ever walked through was the famous Belém Tower. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Belém Tower played a major role in the Age of Discoveries. It was also used as a fort to protect the coast against foreign attacks.\n\nRight next to Belém Tower is the Padrão dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries) that is a tribute to 33 figures in Portugal’s Age of Discoveries, including Henry the Navigator.\n\nJerónimos Monastery:\n\nOne of the most beautifully-ornate places I’ve visited during my travels was the Jerónimos Monastery in Belém. The Gothic details around the monastery and on the cloisters is absolutely stunning and admirable.\n\nThe former monastery was under the Order of Saint Jerome and it was highly associated with the early sailors as explorers.\n\nEat and Shop Along the Tagus River:\n\nLocated right along the river are numerous Portuguese, seafood and international restaurants to eat at. A lot of them offer outdoor seating along the river where you could enjoy the views of the Ponte 25 de Abril, a bridge that looks similar to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In addition, there are numerous souvenir shops where you purchase gifts for your loved ones back home.\n\nSavor Portuguese Wine at a Local Vineyard:\n\nAs I was making my way from Lisbon to Peniche, I passed a lot of vineyards outside of Lisbon. They were all so scenic as well! Not many people know this, including myself prior to this trip, but the Lisbon area has some of the best Portuguese wineries and vineyards! Even though I didn’t have the time on my most recent trip to visit a winery in the Lisbon area, I totally would go to one next time. Here is a list of some great wineries around Lisbon:\n\nAdega de Colares\n\nAdega Mãe\n\nQuinta do Gradil\n\nQuinta dos Loridos – Buddha Eden\n\nJosé Maria da Fonseca Winery, Vila Nogueira de Azeitão\n\nTake a Ride Along the Tagus River:\n\nAnother fun thing to do during your solo trip in Lisbon is take a cruise along the Tagus River. It is best to do this around sunset and capture amazing views of the cities and nearby coastal towns. Sail past Lisbon, Belém, the National Sanctuary of Christ the King and the other surrounding towns.\n\nAdmire the Views of Lisbon:\n\nLisbon is such a stunning city and the best way to see it is by hopping on the Elevator de Santa Justa. (I knew I couldn’t leave out this amazing landmark in this Lisbon solo travel guide.) One thing to note about the Elevator de Santa Justa is that the line is usually around an hour long, so definitely plan to go early in the day. It is also part of the public transport network in Lisbon and is managed by Carris. You could buy a 24-hour public transport ticket that cost around 6 euros and it can be purchased at any metro station. It also includes a ticket to the Gloria Funicular.\n\nThis beautiful 19th century lift transports passengers so that they could capture astonishing panoramic views over Lisbon. It is perfect for any time of the day and it is super romantic.\n\nRide the Infamous Lisbon 28 Tram:\n\nThe Remodelado Trams (run by Carris) date back to the 1930s, but they still play a huge role in Lisbon’s transportation system. When you are in Lisbon, a great way to explore the city is by taking the 28 tram route since the capital is unsuitable for other modern trams due to its tight turns and steep hills. It is the perfect way to see wonderful hidden gems in the city during a solo trip.\n\nOverall, I absolutely adore Lisbon and hope to return sometime in the near future. If you have any questions about my stay at Bomporto Hotels or general inquiries about this solo travel guide to Lisbon, Portugal, please email me at info@browneyedflowerchild.com.\n\nMake sure to pin this post if you find it useful!\n\nBasic Facts of Portugal:\n\nCurrency: Euro, Capital: Lisbon, Time Zone: Portugal has two time zones. Mainland Portugal and Madeira follow Western European Standard Time and the Azores follow the Azores Standard Time, which is an hour behind.\n\n*Anything could happen during your travels.

It was so cool!)\n\nSince I was staying in a one-bedroom apartment-styled room, I had a bright and airy kitchen that included a fridge with refreshments, a Nespresso coffee machine, SMEG appliances such as a dishwasher, induction cooker, toaster and electric kettle. The living room area was beautifully furnished with comfortable couches, sofas, a carpet, pillows and wonderful décor. Both the living room and my bedroom had a cable television as well! My personal bedroom included a queen sized bed and trendy décor.\n\nThe room also included an en-suite bathroom with a rain shower, sink and toilet area with Claus Porto bathroom amenities as well as a bathrobe and slippers. These beautiful rooms also feature fully soundproof windows and Beats Pill+, so you could connect wirelessly from your mobile device and play music. In addition to the one-bedroom apartments, The Lumiares also has two-bedroom apartments, a penthouse, a loft style room as well as a studio.\n\nThe Lumiares itself was absolutely stunning! There is 24-hour room service available, a 24-hour reception and concierge, secure underground parking, free high-speed WiFi, a spa that offers amazing services, a 24-hour boutique gym (and there is also a personal trainer available), sauna and steam rooms, laundry services, a babysitting service as well as a café, restaurant and rooftop bar.\n\nOverall, I had an amazing night’s sleep and stay at The Lumiares!\n\nEating at The Lumiares in Lisbon:\n\nWhat is also nice about The Lumiares is that it offers two restaurants and a rooftop bar for all to enjoy (even if you aren’t staying at the hotel).\n\nSince I arrived at The Lumiares around dinnertime my first night, I couldn’t wait to check out the Lumi Rooftop Bar & Restaurant for dinner and drinks with a view. It was absolutely wonderful being welcomed with a complementary drink when I entered the rooftop bar. The bartender made me a signature cocktail that was absolutely delicious! I also enjoyed a Portuguese seafood rice dish that included clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops and calamari. It was absolutely delicious!\n\nOne of my favorite parts of staying at Bomporto Hotels is that both The Lumiares and The Vintage had an amazing breakfast! At The Lumiares, I enjoyed a lovely buffet breakfast that consisted of pastries, smoked salmon, cold cuts, fresh fruit, breads and croissants as well as an à la carte pancake and bacon dish. Everything was delicious! The breakfast at The Lumiares was located at Lumi Rooftop Bar & Restaurant and they also offer a selection of beverages from coffees and cappuccinos to mimosas and a variety of juices. In addition to Lumi Rooftop Bar & Restaurant, there is also a café called Mercado where you could grab sandwiches, simple Portuguese food and more.\n\nStaying at The Vintage in Lisbon:\n\nWhat is awesome about staying at The Vintage is that it is situated in Lisbon’s Principé Real where you could window shop at the infamous boutiques on the Avenida Liberdade, have fun at the local bars, enjoy authentic Portuguese food and view the galleries in the Bairro Alto and Chiado neighborhoods.\n\nThe rooms at The Vintage are spacious, comfortable and are filled with beautiful art deco touches with a vintage twist (hence the name of the hotel). During my last night in Lisbon, I stayed in the Executive Suite of The Vintage. The room offered a lot of space, included one SUPER COMFY double bed (pretty standard for a European hotel), a flat-screen television, a mini bar and Nespresso machine, a separate sitting area, beautiful photographs and decorations as well as gorgeous views of the wisteria outside.\n\nFeatured in the room is a sink area, a little shower room (that included a rain shower) as well as a toilet room. Also included in the room is a hairdryer, complementary toiletries and a bathrobe and slippers. In addition to the Executive Suite, The Vintage also offers a Deluxe room and a Superior room.\n\nJust like at The Lumiares, The Vintage offers 24-hour room service, 24-hour reception and concierge, free high-speed WiFi, a spa with multiple services, an indoor pool, a gym, meeting rooms, conference and event space, secure parking as well as a restaurant and three bars.\n\nEating at The Vintage in Lisbon:\n\nDuring my stay at The Vintage, one of the highlights was having my room located on the same floor as the Rooftop-Bar! The drinks at The Vintage are awesome and there is nothing better than enjoying it with a view. Prior to going to the bar, I was surprised with a glass of Port wine and two pastei de nata treats (Portuguese custard tarts) to welcome me.\n\nThe views of the Rooftop-Bar were spectacular! I was able to catch a pre-sunset above the red roofs of Lisbon, the nearby Tagus River as well as the beautiful castle of Sao Jorge. Since white sangria is more popular than red sangria in Portugal, I just had to get a refreshing glass of white sangria to enjoy the evening! I loved how the rooftop included comfortable lounge areas, a lush plant wall and a friendly bar staff. They also provided me with seasoned peanuts to enjoy with my drink. There are also two other bars in The Vintage – one located within The Vintage Restaurant and the other is in the lobby.\n\nThe Vintage Restaurant offers a great menu where you could find amazing Portuguese dishes along with a variety of other international meals. It is also where breakfast is held every morning. Just like at The Lumiares, The Vintage also offers an amazing breakfast with great buffet and à la carte options.\n\nA Luxury Solo Travel Guide to Lisbon:\n\nWander Aimlessly through the Pastel Streets:\n\nLisbon is the perfect city to get lost in as a solo female traveler. Not only is it extremely safe, the pastel architecture is definitely something to admire, there is amazing street art, stunning views of the river are featured throughout each area (there really is nothing more picturesque than gorgeous European buildings along the water) and there are so many great places to visit such as authentic restaurants and cafés, museums, stores, churches and more.\n\nIn this solo travel guide to Lisbon, I couldn’t exclude the amazing areas in Lisbon that you cannot miss out on visiting. Please see below:\n\nAlfama – With a vast history that dates back to the Moors, Alfama is known to have colorful houses along narrow, cobblestoned streets. If you are looking to get a traditional Portuguese experience during your time in Lisbon, it is recommended that you visit a Fado club. Fado is considered to be a melancholic music style of storytelling that was born in the Alfama area of Lisbon. (It is similar to flamenco.) Alfama is one of the best areas to really get a true taste of the culture in Lisbon. It is also a wonderful area to see the beautiful tile work.\n\nAvenida da Liberdade – Similar to 5th Avenue in New York, Rodeo Drive in Los Angeles and the Champs Élysées in Paris, the Avenida da Liberdade is where you could find Lisbon’s most high end and prestigious hotels and shops. It is definitely a beautiful street to walk through and window shop. I loved eyeing all of the beautiful wedding gowns in the bridal stores. They were absolutely gorgeous!\n\nBairro Alto – This fun area is known to have the best nightlife in Lisbon. It is in Bairro Alto where you could walk into small bars and nightclubs and dance until the sun rises. There are even a lot of bars thriving during the day in this area.\n\nBaixa – Known to be the heart of Lisbon, Baixa is where you could find the famous Praça do Comércio (the plaza filled with beautiful yellow buildings) that is pretty much the entrance into the city. Baixa may be a bit touristy, but it is super lively and definitely the best place to find great eateries, live entertainment, shops and historical sites.\n\nChiado – The Chiado area is known to have some pretty cool shopping, theaters, authentic restaurants and cute cafés. It is a very trendy area to visit no matter what time of the day it is.\n\nCais do Sodré – As the former red-light district of Lisbon, you could find some of Lisbon’s best nightclubs in this area.\n\nLisbon has become a popular city for travelers worldwide to visit. If you are looking to get away from the tourists and experience the local scene, it is best to head to the areas of Graça, Estrela and Principe Real.\n\nEat Your Way through Lisbon:\n\nPortuguese is one of my favorite cuisines and during your time in Lisbon, it is important to know where to go to get the best food in town! In this travel guide below, discover the best restaurants and foodie joints I ate at during my solo trip to Lisbon and some other great options to discover in the city:\n\nTimeOut Lisboa: As a concept created by scratch from the TimeOut Portugal team of publishers, this amazing market hall came to life in 2014 and includes 24 restaurants, 8 bars, numerous shops and a high-end music venue. I absolutely love places like this and it reminded me of Pike Place Market in Seattle and Reading Terminal in Philadelphia!\n\nTimeOut Market is known for having the best meat, fish, fruit and flowers in the city. It includes everything from traditional Portuguese food to artisanal pizza and includes unique concepts such as a croquette stand to an Aperol Spritz bar. You could also visit amazing stands that offer crafted burgers, gelato, sushi, baked goods, oysters and so much more! A trip to Lisbon is not complete without coming to TimeOut Market. I came to this amazing food hall for lunch and it did not disappoint! Since I love croquettes, I got three delicious ones from Croqueteria that consisted of cuttlefish and squid ink, chorizo and cod as well as tuna and sun-dried tomatoes. They were all amazing, but the cuttlefish and squid ink were my favorite! I savored this all with a refreshing Portuguese cider. Afterwards, I enjoyed a salted caramel gelato at Santini. Click here to discover more about what TimeOut Market offers in Lisbon.\n\nIn addition to Lisbon, you could find TimeOut Markets in Miami, Brooklyn, Montréal and Chicago. TimeOut Market will also be opening up locations in Dubai, London and Prague in the near future.\n\nCervejaria Ribadouro: For dinner, the staff at The Vintage recommended an amazing seafood restaurant for me to eat at. Cervejaria Ribadouro was where I had one of the BEST meals of my life! I enjoyed a delicious Port wine with seafood mariscos, which included shrimp and lobster meat with a juicy seafood sauce. It also came with white rice and amazing fried bread that tasted well with the seafood and sauce. In addition, I also got a dessert, which consisted of a rich chocolate mousse.\n\nWhat was great about Cervejaria Ribadouro was that it was only a five minute walk from The Vintage! It also dates back to 1947 when Ribadouro Brewery opened its doors. Nowadays, it offers fresh seafood made from art and mastery. I couldn’t recommend this wonderful restaurant more to those visiting Lisbon!\n\nHere is a list of other restaurants and cafés worth checking out in Lisbon:\n\nBistro 100 Maneiras\n\nPalacio de Chiado\n\nCopenhagen Coffee Lab + Bakery\n\nVisit the Castelo de Sao Jorge:\n\nDuring a solo trip to Lisbon, I recommend visiting the castle of the city – the Castelo de Sao Jorge. This national monument offers 360-degree views of Lisbon and occupies the area of the old medieval citadel and also consists of the castle, ruins of the former royal palace and part of the neighborhood for the elite. I loved strolling around the castle and going back in time. One thing to note is that it does get crowded with both tourists and Portuguese school kids who are on field trips.\n\nThe Castelo de Sao Jorge started its importance after Dom Afonso Henriques conquered Lisbon in 1147. He became the first king of Portugal and then the castle began its golden age as home for royalty. It also became a place that held festivities as well as coronations. Later on, when Portugal became part of the Spanish Crown in 1580, the castle took on a military purpose through the early 20th century.\n\nOverall, visiting the Castelo de Sao Jorge is a wonderful and educational experience for all. Plus, you may spot some peacocks when you are there!\n\nPretend You’re in a Fairytale in Sintra:\n\nDuring my first trip to Lisbon, I visited the fairytale town of Sintra. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to make it back during my recent trip in May 2019, but I wish I would’ve. This enchanting UNESCO World Heritage Site is praised by many worldwide and is considered one of the most beautiful places in the world.\n\nHere is a list of what you must see during a day trip to Sintra from Lisbon:\n\nPalácio Nacional de Sintra\n\nQuinta da Regaleira\n\nPalácio Nacional da Pena\n\nParque da Pena\n\nPalácio & Parque de Monserrate\n\nMuseu das Artes de Sintra\n\nIn addition to including beautiful palaces and castles in this solo travel guide, I also have to mention that Sintra also has a breathtaking coastline northwest of Lisbon that cannot be missed. Cabo da Roca is a wonderful place to hike, take in the beautiful seaside nature and relax.\n\nEnjoy a Beach Day at a Lisbon Beach Town:\n\nIf you are a beach person, you definitely won’t go wrong during your time in Portugal. No matter where you go to the beach along the Portuguese coastline, it will be absolutely breathtaking. During my first trip to Lisbon, I visited the seaside town of Cascais.\n\nThis charming fishing town is filled with colorful houses, cobblestone alleyways with great shops, restaurants and bars and it included a beach to sunbathe and go swimming. I had such a blast with my study abroad friends there and even enjoyed an amazing crab dip at a local café.\n\nEven though I didn’t have time to visit anywhere else, a few other great beach towns around Lisbon are Serra de Sintra (which I mention above), Costa da Caparica and Serra da Arrábida.\n\nThe Algarve is an incredible destination for those looking for a beach trip a few hours away from the capital city. Discover the ultimate Algarve itinerary.\n\nEven though there are plenty of incredible beaches to enjoy in the summer, winter in Lisbon is also a blast! It’s the perfect time to check out the city’s famous landmarks without crowds and everything is much more affordable.\n\nLearn Portuguese History in Belém:\n\nAnother place you cannot miss out on during your time in Lisbon is visiting the district of Belém. This stunning area features iconic landmarks and historical locations that leaves visitors awestruck!\n\nI visited Belém during my first time in Lisbon and I loved exploring this area! Belém is situated on the Tagus River and it is a major maritime port. Below is a simple travel guide to the Belém area during a solo trip in Lisbon:\n\nTorre de Belém:\n\nOne of the coolest towers I’ve ever walked through was the famous Belém Tower. Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, Belém Tower played a major role in the Age of Discoveries. It was also used as a fort to protect the coast against foreign attacks.\n\nRight next to Belém Tower is the Padrão dos Descobrimentos (Monument to the Discoveries) that is a tribute to 33 figures in Portugal’s Age of Discoveries, including Henry the Navigator.\n\nJerónimos Monastery:\n\nOne of the most beautifully-ornate places I’ve visited during my travels was the Jerónimos Monastery in Belém. The Gothic details around the monastery and on the cloisters is absolutely stunning and admirable.\n\nThe former monastery was under the Order of Saint Jerome and it was highly associated with the early sailors as explorers.\n\nEat and Shop Along the Tagus River:\n\nLocated right along the river are numerous Portuguese, seafood and international restaurants to eat at. A lot of them offer outdoor seating along the river where you could enjoy the views of the Ponte 25 de Abril, a bridge that looks similar to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. In addition, there are numerous souvenir shops where you purchase gifts for your loved ones back home.\n\nSavor Portuguese Wine at a Local Vineyard:\n\nAs I was making my way from Lisbon to Peniche, I passed a lot of vineyards outside of Lisbon. They were all so scenic as well! Not many people know this, including myself prior to this trip, but the Lisbon area has some of the best Portuguese wineries and vineyards! Even though I didn’t have the time on my most recent trip to visit a winery in the Lisbon area, I totally would go to one next time. Here is a list of some great wineries around Lisbon:\n\nAdega de Colares\n\nAdega Mãe\n\nQuinta do Gradil\n\nQuinta dos Loridos – Buddha Eden\n\nJosé Maria da Fonseca Winery, Vila Nogueira de Azeitão\n\nTake a Ride Along the Tagus River:\n\nAnother fun thing to do during your solo trip in Lisbon is take a cruise along the Tagus River. It is best to do this around sunset and capture amazing views of the cities and nearby coastal towns. Sail past Lisbon, Belém, the National Sanctuary of Christ the King and the other surrounding towns.\n\nAdmire the Views of Lisbon:\n\nLisbon is such a stunning city and the best way to see it is by hopping on the Elevator de Santa Justa. (I knew I couldn’t leave out this amazing landmark in this Lisbon solo travel guide.) One thing to note about the Elevator de Santa Justa is that the line is usually around an hour long, so definitely plan to go early in the day. It is also part of the public transport network in Lisbon and is managed by Carris. You could buy a 24-hour public transport ticket that cost around 6 euros and it can be purchased at any metro station. It also includes a ticket to the Gloria Funicular.\n\nThis beautiful 19th century lift transports passengers so that they could capture astonishing panoramic views over Lisbon. It is perfect for any time of the day and it is super romantic.\n\nRide the Infamous Lisbon 28 Tram:\n\nThe Remodelado Trams (run by Carris) date back to the 1930s, but they still play a huge role in Lisbon’s transportation system. When you are in Lisbon, a great way to explore the city is by taking the 28 tram route since the capital is unsuitable for other modern trams due to its tight turns and steep hills. It is the perfect way to see wonderful hidden gems in the city during a solo trip.\n\nOverall, I absolutely adore Lisbon and hope to return sometime in the near future.

Mainland Portugal and Madeira follow Western European Standard Time and the Azores follow the Azores Standard Time, which is an hour behind.\n\n*Anything could happen during your travels.
