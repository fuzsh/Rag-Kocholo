Enjoy the stunning views from your room or visit the rooftop for a panoramic view from the pool. We invite you to explore the new Simultáneo, a place open to everyone where leisure, fine food and culture converge. Succumb to our tempting culinary offering: the tapas in the Gastrobar, the Mediterranean cuisine of the Filigrana restaurant or the striking Japanese fusion dishes at Kurai. We also have 11 meeting rooms equipped for all kinds of events, our own car park, a gym and free wifi. Catalonia Barcelona Plaza is your downtown hotel , with a superb location close to the Fira de Barcelona trade show grounds, the Fuentes Mágicas fountains and the Montjuïc mountain.\n\nThe Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel is located in an emblematic building in Plaza España, whose clock on the main façade is an icon of the city. Upon entering you will discover a renovated, spacious lobby, from where you can access the Simultáneo space, the new place-to-be in Barcelona. A large open room with a glass roof and an atmosphere that is as bright as it is welcoming, thanks to the jungle-inspired design in shades of green, orange and ivory. In Simultáneo, gastronomy, leisure and culture merge in a versatile place where we are waiting for you whether you are staying at the hotel or not. Come telework connected to the free WIFI, have an informal meeting, enjoy a concert, have an after-work cocktail or simply treat yourself to a break before continuing with your day. If you feel like eating while you are at Simultáneo, the Gastrobar offers an extensive menu with innovative tapas and haute cuisine dishes that you will surely want to try. The gastronomic experience continues in the other two hotel restaurants. At Filigrana you will find an extensive menu inspired by Mediterranean cuisine in an elegant setting. Choose between rice dishes, grilled meats, fish from the market and Catalan culinary specialties. On the other hand, if you are looking for a different proposal, the Kurai restaurant will transport you to Japan with unique dishes halfway between Japanese and Western cuisine. In addition to a large selection of sushi, it has a wok, sumi-yaki (grilled) and a Japanese cocktail menu. In summer, contemplate the best panoramic views of Barcelona from The Clock Terrace, our designer rooftop with a pool, Balinese beds and a chill out area. Nothing better than some tapas accompanied by a glass of wine or a cocktail to relax admiring the bustle of the city. If you stay to get to know the city, the Catalonia Barcelona Plaza hotel is very close to some of the most important tourist spots, as well as being very well connected to the center of Barcelona, via metro and bus. Plaza España is directly opposite, followed by Avenida Maria Cristina, with its imposing Roman towers. The Magic Fountains of Montjuïc begin here, which are illuminated every night with water and color shows. Presiding over the mountain you will find the Palau Nacional, home to the National Art Museum of Catalonia, and, next to the hotel, the Las Arenas shopping center, an old bullring that preserves its exterior architecture. If you come for business, you will be in the ideal location, in a hotel near Fira de Barcelona, located a few meters away, and well connected to the Gran Vía fairgrounds. In addition, we offer you 3 large-capacity conference rooms and 8 meeting rooms, so you can celebrate corporate events with all the necessary equipment and parking in the building.

We have maintained the spectacular north façade, which preserves the bell tower with its two towers and the central body of the church with restored masonry. The building and all the elements that are preserved have a high historical value and are protected by the Urban Heritage of San Sebastián. The façade of the old convent contrasts with the main entrance of the hotel, newly built and with a modern design, creating a stylistic opposition that will surprise you. Upon entering, you will be invaded by a feeling of warmth thanks to the elegant atmosphere achieved with an English-inspired and stately decoration, with noble materials and fabrics such as velvet, marble, copper, dark wood and decorative elements of local origin. If there is something you cannot miss at the Catalonia Donosti hotel, it is the incredible views from the panoramic roof terrace over La Concha beach, the Cathedral and the city centre. In addition, on hot days, you can enjoy a refreshing swim in our urban pool and solarium with sun loungers.

The largest, perfect for corporate conferences, are the Santa Clara room, with partitions and a capacity of up to 180 people, and the San Bartolomé room, which can accommodate up to 140 attendees in its open format. The rest of the smaller rooms are ideal for family celebrations such as birthdays, communions or meals on holidays. In addition, we have our own parking in the same building with a charging point for electric cars (rates to consult with reception via email or phone) and parking for bicycles. Donosti is a lively city with a great cultural scene, which is why our hotel is a great option to stay during the San Sebastian International Film Festival. If you come for tourism, remember to visit the three beaches in the city, or four if we count the one on the Island of Santa Clara, the most famous being Playa de la Concha. Don't miss the San Telmo Museum, dedicated to Basque society, the Aquarium, one of the most important in Europe, the Buen Pastor Cathedral, just two minutes from the hotel, or the famous Chillida Comb of the Winds.
