        "text": "We're going next month to Barcelona and Salamanca in Spain then onto Portugal. A couple months ago,when we were setting our itinerary, I investigated getting from Salamanca into Portugal, specifically up to Porto. Since the train and bus sites wouldn't go that far out with schedules, I picked a random week day within the 30 days to get schedules. At that time, we could take a bus from Salamanca at 9:15 AM to Coimbra, then a Alfa train from there to Porto, arriving early evening. Now, there is no bus from Salamanca until 2:30 PM with worse connections in Coimbra, ultimately arriving in Porto at 10 PM. The only train leaves Salamanca at 1 AM and gets in about 5 AM. Neither of these appeal to us. I tried looking for something out of Madrid instead, but the same night train goes to Lisbon first, then Porto. It's looking like a car rental is the way to go, unless someone out there has a better idea?? Thanks."
