Funny thing was we flew from US to France, walked into and across Spain, drove to Portugal and back to Spain, took a train to France, and our return flight from France went through Germany ? (not sure why, wrong direction). My passport got stamped when we arrived in France, stamped again because we changed planes in Germany, and then back home in USA. Visited 3 countries when we were in Europe and I got a Germany stamp in my passport because of a 2 hour layover there Never got out of the airport\n\nAlanSykes\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nExcept the Francés\n\nMar 10, 2014\n\n#4\n\nNo passport control but, weirdly, you have to change your watch forward by an hour, as Franco moved Spain onto the same time zone as his Nazi friends.\n\nDiogo92\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nC.

Coming outside the EEC you will have to show your passport and eventually a visa. Between the countries who signed the Schengen agreement there is no controll. It is the same in the USA. Arriving from outside the USA you have to show your passport and an ESTA document..

You probably catch some control because there was a search warrant for someone, but that it's not normal! I've done Santiago de Compostela to Lisbon by bus, border crossing was, how can I say it, I didn't see it! I've only noticed that I was already in Portugal, because I've received and text message on my phone from Optimus/Orange, saying that I was using again my normal service, and that Roaming has been deactivated.\n\nWe didn't passed any toll, any check point, any control thing.\n\nBest Regards\n\nDiogo\n\ngrayland\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nYes\n\nMar 12, 2014\n\n#15\n\nThere is no passport control within the EU.....hasn't been since EU formed.\n\nThe only reason the police would board a bus is that they were actually looking for someone and were checking ID.\n\nMost countries do \"require\" that non EU citizens have passports with them at all times but do not stop people to check.

Police still check buses before the tunnel from France to Spain at Canfranc Estacion. It may be under the guise of enforcing regulations on hazardous materials in the tunnel, but on a bus? A cursory check? An occasional random check of passenger ID's? Still, they do stop vehicles and board buses, so border checks are not entirely gone.\n\nW\n\nwhariwharangi\n\nGuest\n\nMar 12, 2014\n\n#17\n\nThere is no passport control within the EU.....hasn't been since EU formed.\n\nThe only reason the police would board a bus is that they were actually looking for someone and were checking ID.\n\nMost countries do \"require\" that non EU citizens have passports with them at all times but do not stop people to check.

I have also seen this same thing at the bus stop in St. Jean de Luz. It is just a matter of showing them your passport or ID card, but I have also seen people removed from the bus a few times because they lacked the proper paperwork.\n\nLast edited: Mar 13, 2014\n\nnaplesdon\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nMultiple Caminos 2010 to 2019\n\nMar 12, 2014\n\n#20\n\nSorry I meant to post this to the CF site, I had zero issues walking across the bridge from Valenca to Tui."
