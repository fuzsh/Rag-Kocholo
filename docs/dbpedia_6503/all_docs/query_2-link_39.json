        "text": "If it is 0800 in New York what time is it in London?\n\nNew York is in the UTC-5 time zone and London is in the UTC time zone. New York is five hours behind London, so 0800 in New York is 1300 in London. Both New York and London observe daylight savings. New York moves into the UTC-4 time zone on the second Sunday of March until the first Sunday of November. London moves into the UTC+1 time zone on the last Sunday of March until the first Sunday of October. In the short period of time where one country is observing daylight savings and the other is not, there is only a four hour time difference between the two, so 0800 would be 1200.\n\nIf it is 12pm in New York what time is it in London England?\n\nLondon, England is in the GMT/UTC time zone. From the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October, daylight savings are observed and the time zone is UTC+1.Chicago, United States, is in the UTC-6 time zone. From the first Sunday in March until the first Sunday in November, daylight savings are observed and the time zone is UTC-5. Therefore, 12 pm in London is 6 am in Chicago. For three weeks of the year, this is shorted by one hour due to a difference in daylight savings.Paris, France is in the UTC+1 time zone. From the last Sunday in March until the last Sunday in October, daylight savings are observed and the time zone is UTC+2. Therefore, 12 pm in London is 1 pm in Paris throughout the year.Moscow, Russia is in the UTC+3 time zone and does not observe daylight savings. Therefore, 12 pm in London is 3 pm in Moscow outside daylight savings and 2 pm during.Tokyo, Japan is in the UTC+9 time zone and does not observe daylight savings. Therefore, 12 pm in London is 9 pm in Tokyo outside daylight savings and 8 pm during.Buenos Aires, Argentina is in the UTC-3 time zone and does not observe daylight savings.
