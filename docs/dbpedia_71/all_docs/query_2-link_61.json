Of the cities in the poll which one is most similar to Omaha in terms of:\n\nClimate\n\nPopulation\n\nMetro Area\n\nEconomy\n\nEducation\n\nRecreation\n\nUpward(or Downward) Mobility\n\nVibrancy\n\nNightlife\n\nNational prominence\n\nThoughts?\n\nI’m an Omaha native and have visited every city included in the poll, multiple times..with the exception of Rochester NY and Dayton OH..\n\nThe assumptive, easy answer is Des Moines. They are metros only 120 miles apart. From a climate, education and probably economy perspective, they are very similar. The suburban bones of both cities also look pretty much interchangeable. But once you get into the urbanized area and core of the city, Omaha and Des Moines are not similar at all. Omaha has always been the much larger, dense city and larger metropolitan area.. Therefore Omaha’s downtown core, and vibrancy, nightlife is on a tier above Des Moines.\n\nReally, none of the cities listed are totally comparable to Omaha. I’d say even though it’s metro is twice as large, Omaha is more similar to Kansas City MO than any city listed in this poll. I suppose from a “twinning” aspect, considering their MSA populations are almost identical, Tulsa might be the most comparable overall. Then probably Grand Rapids, Des Moines/OKC, then “maybe” Wichita KS.\n\nFrom an upward mobility and national prominence standpoint, with the exception of Milwaukee, I’d place Omaha above all the cities in this poll with Grand Rapids, Oklahoma City, Tulsa and Des Moines just a tick behind.\n\nOmaha is really coming into it’s own currently.. It’s not a “best kept secret” anymore..and it’s diversified economy and job opportunities make it a fantastic place for young single professionals and families alike to move in and enjoy a great life. It’s a 1 million population metro with most all the amenities of a metro 2 to 3 times larger, without most of the “painful” hassles those larger metros contain.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Landolakes90\n\nCurious about Omaha since I'll be heading there for the first time for work in a couple weeks so I thought one of these threads might be a cool way to talk about it.

Omaha is a much larger city than Des Moines.\n\nOmaha is a Northern Midwestern city through and through. The locals tend to have a very Northern accent in Omaha for example.\n\nClimate wise: Omaha is very similar to Des Moines and much colder than Wichita, Oklahoma City, Tulsa in the winter and much less warm in the summer.\n\nPopulation: Omaha metro population is similar to Tulsa. Omaha feels like a much larger city than it is, I have always thought Omaha has the amenities of a city twice it's size generally.\n\nEconomy wise: Omaha is sort of a mix between Oklahoma City and Grand Rapids. Omaha has an excellent economy.\n\nUniversities: I would say similar to lesser extent to Milwaukee. Omaha has a large state university, but not the largest and private small universities also which is similar to Milwaukee.\n\nMobility: I would say slightly upward mobility than Des Moines, but more upwardly mobile than many of the other cities listed. Omaha isn't the best on upward mobility, but it is better than many Midwestern cities.\n\nVibrancy: Omaha has several pockets in the city that are extremely vibrant for the size of Omaha, but a huge percentage of Omaha is very quaint for a city of it's size.\n\nNightlife: Omaha has small pockets that are quite vibrant at night mainly downtown and then the neighborhoods on Dodge between 30th street and the Nebraska Medical Center. I would say overall though Omaha is average for the population of the metro on nightlife because much of the city is very, very quiet also.\n\nLast edited by lovecrowds; 07-01-2021 at 11:47 PM.."
