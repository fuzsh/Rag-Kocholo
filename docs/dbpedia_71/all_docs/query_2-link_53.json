        "text": "Edina Solar Power Information & Peak Sun Hours\n\nSolar Green Energy Summary for Edina, Minnesota\n\nLattitude: 44.8913\n\nSunlight\n\nFixed Tilt Sunlight Hours: 4.6 hours per day\n\n1-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 5.9 hours per day\n\n2-Axis Tilt Sunlight Hours: 6 hours per day\n\nPeak sun hours is arguably the most important number to consider before installing your solar panels. Unlike total sun hours, peak sun hours are calculated by looking at the amount of sunlight hours in a 24 hour period that is strong enough to be absorb by a solar panel. One way to imagine peak sun hours is to think about a solar powered calculator you owned in school. If you covered the solar panel with your finger, or tried to use the calculator in the dark, the calculator would not work. As you slowly exposed the calculator to light the calculator would eventually turn on and be usable. The same is true with peak sun hours; these are the hours that your solar panels receive enough sunlight to work. Looking at the average peak sunlight hours of 4.6 per day can help you determine the amount of solar panels you need to install to power your home or business in Edina, Minnesota.\n\nThe equator has a latitude of zero while Edina has a latitude of 44.9. Any city located on the equator will receive the most sunlight throughout the year because the sunlight arrives at a perpendicular 90 degree angle to the earth at the equator. The further you are from the equator the more your daily sunlight hours can vary.\n\nAlthough most things are out of our control, like the sunrise, sunset or the weather, we can control the angle and the kind of mount we use for a solar panel. The angle of the solar panel, if using a fixed mount, should generally be around the angle that is equal to the latitude of the location to maximize output. In the northern hemisphere, panels angles should be lower in the winter months and higher in the summer months As a fixed mount is set, it is ideal to place it at an angle that will capture the most sunlight during the year. A 1-axis tracking solar mount will track the sun across the sky from sunrise to sunset, but the angle will remain the same throughout the day. A 2-axis solar mount will track the sun throughout the day from East to West, but the angle will also change automatically as the seasons change and the angle of the sun in the sky changes. Thus, a 2-axis will have a higher rating of peak sun hours compared to the 1-axis or fixed.\n\nLooking at latitude, average peak sun hours and various data can obviously help when planning for your solar power needs. The one thing you can never fully account for is changing weather. Storms, rain, cloud coverage all have an impact on solar panel capabilities.\n\nWe can take the latitude of Edina and use that number to know the amount of total sunlight hours in the region from sunlight to sunset and estimate that with a fixed solar panel, Edina will receive 4.6 average peak sun hours per day. This number can be increased to 5.9 hours by using a 1-axis tracking mount, or 6 hours from a 2-axis tracking mount.\n\nSolar Businesses in Edina, Minnesota\n\nTruNorth Solar - Minnesota Solar Installers\n\n5239 Edina Industrial Blvd\n\nEdina, MN 55439\n\n(612) 888-9599\n\nVisit Website\n\nBe the first to hear about the latest green energy news, technology and offers.\n\n[mc4wp_form id=\"2942\"]\n\nBy providing your email you consent to receiving occasional promotional emails & newsletters.\n\nNo Spam.
