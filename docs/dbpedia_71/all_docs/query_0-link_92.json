        "text": "Product: Processed, classified lidar point cloud data tiles in LAS 1.4 format.\n\nGeographic Extent: This dataset covers approximately 5847 square miles in southeast Minnesota and consists of 3 deliveries or blocks.\n\nMN_SEDriftless_1 (Work Unit 228969) - Approximately 1,741 square miles in southeast Minnesota, including Dakota, Dodge, Freeborn, Mower, Rice, Scott, Steele, and Waseca counties\n\nMN_SEDriftless_2 (Work Unit 222535) - Approximately 2,268 square miles in southeast Minnesota, including Fillmore, Houston, Wabasha, and Winona counties\n\nMN_SEDriftless_3 (Work Unit 228972) - Approximately 1,838 square miles in southeast Minnesota, including Fillmore, Freeborn, and Mower counties\n\nDataset Description: MN SE Driftless 2021 lidar project called for the planning, acquisition, processing, and production of derivative products of QL1 lidar data to be collected an aggregate nominal pulse spacing (ANPS) of 0.35-meters and 8 points per square meter (ppsm). Project specifications were based on the U.S. Geological Survey National Geospatial Program Base Lidar Specification, Version 2022 revision A. The data was developed based on a horizontal reference system of NAD83 (2011) UTM 15 meters (EPSG 6344) and a vertical reference system of NAVD88 (GEOID18) meters. Lidar data was delivered as processed LAZ 1.4 files formatted to individual 1,000 meters x 1,000 meters tiles.\n\nGround Conditions: Lidar was collected from April 22, 2021, through June 13, 2021 while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the lidar data to meet task order specifications and meet ASPRS vertical accuracy guidelines, Woolpert established ground control points that were used to calibrate the lidar to known ground locations established throughout the entire project area. An additional independent accuracy checkpoints were collected throughout the entire project area and used to assess the vertical accuracy of the data. These checkpoints were not used to calibrate or post process the data.\n\nThis metadata record supports the data entry in the NOAA Digital Coast Data Access Viewer (DAV). For this data set, the DAV is leveraging the Entwine Point Tiles (EPT) hosted by USGS on Amazon Web Services.\n\nUsers should be aware that temporal changes may have occurred since this data set was collected and some parts of this data may no longer represent actual surface conditions. Users should not use this data for critical applications without a full awareness of its limitations. Acknowledgement of the U.S. Geological Survey would be appreciated for products derived from these data. Woolpert prepared the original data as set forth in the Scope of Services, in accordance with reasonable care and due diligence as set forth in this Agreement, however, due to the easily alterable nature of electronic media, files, documents, and other deliverables, Woolpert makes no warranties, either expressed or implied, with respect to the accuracy, completeness, merchantability, or fitness for any particular purpose, including, but not limited to, use of any/all data as described within this metadata file, by any user of this data.
