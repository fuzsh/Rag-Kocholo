        "text": "Original Author: Doug Skor\n\nRevised 2014 by Lindsay Davis\n\nRevised 2023 by Russell Squire\n\nDownload a PDF of Chapter 15\n\nChapter Contents\n\n15.1 Introduction\n\nJudicial review of state agency actions in contested cases is most frequently accomplished under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA). Procedures for both obtaining review and limiting the scope of review are enumerated in the APA. Review under the APA is not exclusive, however: it does not prevent the use of other means of review or trial de novo, as may be provided by law. Some statutes provide different procedures for, or avenues of, judicial review. Resort to extraordinary writs or injunctive or declaratory proceedings may also be necessary in some instances.\n\nA contested case is a judicial or quasi-judicial proceeding. For purposes of the APA, it is “a proceeding before an agency in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of specific parties are required by law or constitutional right to be determined after an agency hearing.” Actions of a legislative nature, quasi-legislative actions are also subject to judicial review, but a more limited scope of review gives the agency much greater latitude. It is therefore to the advantage of the party challenging the agency action to have the action characterized as quasi-judicial rather than legislative. Quasi-legislative actions are not reviewable by writ of certiorari. Instead quasi-legislative actions are reviewed by declaratory judgment actions.\n\nThere is a presumption in favor of judicial review of agency decisions, even if no review is provided by statute. Liberal interpretations of the “contested case” definition and of appellate jurisdiction are followed in order to ensure a forum for review.\n\n15.2 Prerequisites to Judicial Review\n\nCourts will not exercise jurisdiction to review an agency action if certain requirements of reviewability have not been satisfied. These include finality of the agency decision, exhaustion of administrative remedies, exercise of primary jurisdiction by the agency, ripeness of the decision for review, and standing of the party seeking review.\n\n15.2.1 Finality\n\nJudicial review is available under the APA of “a final decision in a contested case.” A proposed agency decision is not reviewable, nor are the findings and conclusions of an administrative law judge (ALJ), unless the ALJ’s decision is final without further agency action.\n\nUnder the APA, an application for reconsideration of the agency’s action is not necessary in order that the action be final for purposes of review. However, If reconsideration is sought r the thirty-day period for commencing review proceedings does not begin to run until service of the order “finally disposing of the application for reconsideration.” If the agency’s statute requires a petition for reconsideration as a precondition for judicial review, that provision supersedes the APA and the agency action is not final and not reviewable until reconsideration has been sought and acted upon.\n\nA final decision is also required in cases not subject to the APA. The finality doctrine essentially assures that a court will not interfere with actions yet to be taken by the agency with the requisite expertise. The agency must first take some action that will affect the rights and obligations of the parties. The test of finality is not the name assigned by the agency to its action but is the “legal force or practical effect” of the agency decision or the agency’s expectation of compliance by those affected by its action.\n\nAn agency’s decision to assume jurisdiction of a case is not reviewable unless the entity seeking review can demonstrate irreparable injury flowing from the assertion of jurisdiction itself. The possibility of an adverse result or the cost of a hearing is not sufficient to demonstrate such injury. Even an order denying intervention is not immediately appealable, but only appealable after a final order is issued. This is because any “person aggrieved” is allowed to seek review of a final decision under the APA.\n\n15.2.2 Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\n\nAvailable administrative remedies must be exhausted before judicial review is commenced. This issue may arise when judicial relief is sought either before the agency takes any action or after some initial decision is made but before all intra-agency proceedings have been completed.\n\nThe purposes of this doctrine are to prevent premature interference with agency processes, to allow the agency to function efficiently and have a chance to correct its own errors, to afford the parties and courts the benefits of the agency’s expertise, and to compile a record that is adequate for judicial review. It also conserves judicial time by obviating review before the agency has had a chance to grant the relief sought.\n\nStatutory exhaustion requirements create a jurisdictional bar, while judge-made exhaustion doctrines are likely to be subject to numerous exceptions. . A challenge to agency standards for issuing a permit may proceed, for example, without first applying for the permit and having it rejected.\n\nThere are important exceptions to the exhaustion rule. Exhaustion is not required if it would be futile, that is, when nothing can be accomplished by resorting to the administrative remedies. This may occur when the agency is biased, has predetermined the issue, or lacks the power to provide adequate relief. If irreparable harm will result from pursuit of an administrative remedy and the agency proceeding is challenged on constitutional or jurisdictional grounds, exhaustion may not be required. Speculative damages, however, such as the “apprehension that the final outcome of the administrative proceedings will be prejudicial,” or that expense will be incurred in trying the matter before the agency, will not suffice. The injury must be substantial in the sense that relief will be effectively denied if review is not granted, even if the injured party should successfully pursue the administrative remedy. The United States Supreme Court has held that the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine will not defeat a declaratory judgment action in federal court where the only question presented is the constitutionality of a statute, which the agency could have no power to decide.\n\nA party does not have a right to a jury trial on the issue of exhaustion of administrative remedies, because exhaustion is a legal issue for the court.\n\n15.2.3 Primary Jurisdiction\n\nThe doctrine of primary jurisdiction is another impediment to obtaining judicial relief without waiting for agency action. It applies when an agency and a court have concurrent jurisdiction. If the issue is one that has “been placed within the special competence of an administrative body,” the court may defer to the agency for an initial decision. The purpose of the rule is to ensure uniformity of interpretation of laws administered by agencies and to take full advantage of an agency’s expertise. Its application is not automatic, however. The court may decline to defer to the agency if the agency’s determination would not necessarily aid the court or if the question to be decided by the court differs from that which would be decided by the agency. Even if an agency has special expertise in a particular area, that may not preclude other non-judicial officers from exercising jurisdiction. The court of appeals held that the Commissioner of Commerce did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the insurance industry because the Attorney General also has broad common law and statutory authority to bring lawsuits to protect Minnesota citizens.\n\n15.2.4 Ripeness\n\nGenerally, an agency action is ripe for judicial review if it imposes an obligation, expects compliance, denies a right, fixes a legal relationship, attaches a sanction for noncompliance, threatens prosecution or seizure, or has other immediate impact. Otherwise, review is premature and will be denied. The purpose of the ripeness rule is “to prevent the courts, through avoidance of premature adjudication, from entangling themselves in abstract disagreements over administrative policies, and also to protect the agencies from judicial interference until an administrative decision has been formalized and its effects felt in a concrete way by the challenging parties.” The rule is most likely to be invoked when one seeks review of a rule, policy, or other legislative or discretionary decision that is not made in a judicial or quasi­ judicial proceeding.\n\n15.2.5 Standing\n\nEven if the agency action is final, administrative remedies have been exhausted, primary jurisdiction has been exercised, and the issue is ripe for review, the party seeking review must have standing. “Standing is the requirement that a party has a sufficient stake in a justiciable controversy to seek relief from a court.” The underlying purpose of the doctrine of standing and the various tests it has spawned is “to guarantee that there is a sufficient case or controversy between the parties so that the issue is properly and competently presented to the court.” Consistent with the presumption in favor of reviewability of agency actions, the standing requirement is liberally construed.\n\nUnder the APA, review is available in contested cases to “any person aggrieved” by a final decision. Thus, while a contested case is defined as one that determines the rights, duties, or privileges of “specific parties,” one need not be a party to obtain review of the agency decision.\n\nFor purposes of standing, an “aggrieved party” is one who “is injuriously or adversely affected by the judgment or decree when it operates on his rights of property or bears directly upon his personal interest.” The word “aggrieved” refers to a substantial grievance, a denial of some personal or property right, or the imposition on a party of a burden or obligation. This interpretation of “aggrieved” applies when seeking review of agency action, except that the aggrieved person does not have to be a party. When an agency is acting pursuant to specific authority, a person has standing to challenge administrative procedure if they can show an interest arguably among those intended to be protected by the statute. A mere “interest” in a problem considered in an agency proceeding does not confer standing on an individual or organization to seek review of the agency’s decision.\n\nA liberal “injury-in-fact” test is applied in challenges to agency rule making. To have standing in a declaratory judgment action to challenge an agency’s rule, a petitioner must have a “direct interest” in the validity of the rule that is different from the interest of the citizenry in general. Liberal interpretations of standing are also followed in other agency contexts. Because there is a presumption in favor of reviewability of agency actions, liberal standing determinations are likely in contested case appeals not governed by the APA.\n\nBefore the 1977 amendment to the APA, it was held that the agency was not “aggrieved” and did not have standing to appeal when it had acted in a quasi-judicial matter and its action had been reviewed by another agency or court. Thus, absent express statutory authority, an agency could not seek review or modification of the decision of its own hearing examiner in those situations where the hearing examiner, rather than the agency, made the final decision. Currently, if a statute makes an ALJ’s decision binding on an agency that is a party to the proceeding, the agency may obtain review by certiorari if it is aggrieved by the decision.\n\n15.3 Procedures for Obtaining Review\n\nThe vast majority of agency actions are subject to review in the court of appeals pursuant to the APA. However, some matters continue to have different procedures specified by statute, including review in the district court. One must therefore examine the applicable agency statute carefully instead of assuming that APA review will apply. On occasion, it may also be necessary to utilize one of the extraordinary writs or declaratory or injunctive relief.\n\n15.3.1 Review Under the Administrative Procedure Act\n\nReview is obtained in the court of appeals by the issuance of a writ of certiorari. Detailed procedures are contained in both the APA (Minnesota Statutes sections 14.63 to 14.68) and Minnesota Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure 115. Rule 115.01 states that the appeal period and the acts required to invoke appellate jurisdiction are governed by the applicable statute. Section 14.64 provides that once the petition is served and filed, “the matter shall proceed in the manner provided by the rules of civil appellate procedure.” Both the statutes and the rule should therefore be reviewed in detail.\n\nA petition for the writ must be filed with the court of appeals and served on all parties to the contested case hearing within thirty days after the party receives the final decision and order of the agency. The petition must be served on the agency personally or by certified mail. Proof of service must be filed with the clerk of appellate courts. A copy of the petition must be provided to the attorney general at the time it is served on the parties.\n\nThe prescribed forms for the petition for writ of certiorari and for the writ are set forth in the Minnesota Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure. The proposed writ must be filed with the petition. Filing fees are prescribed in the rules. No cost bond needs to be filed unless it is required upon motion for good cause pursuant to Rule 107.\n\nIf a request for reconsideration by the agency is made within ten days after its decision and order, the thirty-day period to petition for a writ does not begin to run until service of the order finally disposing of the request for reconsideration. It is not necessary to seek reconsideration in order to file a petition for writ of certiorari.\n\nWhen the petition is properly filed, the petitioner is entitled as a matter of right to the issuance of the writ by the clerk of appellate courts. Once the writ is issued, copies must be served personally or by certified mail on all parties to the agency proceeding. On request of the petitioner, the agency must certify the names and addresses of all parties as disclosed by the record, and that certification is conclusive. Proof of service on the agency must be filed with the clerk of appellate courts within seven days of service. A copy of the writ must also be provided to the attorney general.\n\nFiling of the writ does not stay enforcement of the agency decision. It may be stayed, however, by the agency or by the court of appeals. The request for a stay on a supersedeas bond must be first made to the agency, but the agency’s decision is reviewable by the court of appeals.\n\nThe agency must transmit to the court of appeals the original or a certified copy of its entire record within thirty days after service of the writ or at such later time as the court permits. A stipulation by all parties to the review may serve to shorten the record, and any party unreasonably refusing to stipulate to limit the record may be taxed additional costs by the court. Subsequent corrections or additions to the record may be required or permitted by the court. The agency and all parties to the agency proceeding may participate in the review proceedings.\n\nReview by the court of appeals is confined to the record. The matter may be referred by the court back to the agency for the taking of additional evidence if application is made, before the date set for hearing by the court, showing the need to present additional evidence. It must be shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence is material and that there are good reasons that it was not presented in the agency proceeding. After hearing the additional evidence, the agency may modify its findings and decision. It must file with the court of appeals the additional evidence and any modified findings or decision, which become part of the record for review.\n\nIf it is alleged that there are irregularities in procedure that are not shown in the record, the court of appeals may transfer the case to the district court to take evidence and determine the alleged irregularities. The transfer is to the district court for the county in which the agency has its principal office or the county in which the contested case hearing was held. The district court determination on procedural questions may be appealed to the court of appeals as in other civil cases.\n\nCosts and disbursements may be taxed by the prevailing party, but not for or against the agency whose decision is reviewed. The court may award double costs to the prevailing party if the writ was brought for the purpose of delay or vexation. If the writ is issued improperly or not served as required, it may be discharged on the filing of an appropriate motion.\n\nThe first review of an agency decision that is commenced must be decided before any subsequent appeals from the same decision involving the same subject matter may be heard.\n\nThe court of appeals requires strict compliance with the filing deadlines and jurisdictional requirements. Jurisdiction of the court of appeals is exclusive, and a petition erroneously filed in the district court may not subsequently be filed in the court of appeals if the thirty-day filing deadline has passed.\n\n15.3.2 Non-APA Statutory Review Procedures\n\n15.3.2(1) In the Court of Appeals\n\nThere are some situations in which review lies in the court of appeals without reference to the APA. In most of these cases, review is by certiorari, with procedures governed by Minnesota Statutes chapter 606 and rule 115 of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Appellate Procedure. Other statutes prescribe review by the court of appeals pursuant to a “notice of appeal” to be disposed of as in other civil cases, a “petition,” or simply “as in other civil cases.”\n\n15.3.2(2) In the District Court\n\nThere are still several instances in which review is obtained in the district court rather than the court of appeals. District court review has been retained in those instances in which the existing statute provides for a de novo review. This has been based on the rationale that appellate type review of agency actions should lie in the court of appeals, while de novo proceedings should remain in the district court where fact-finding functions are traditionally performed. The Minnesota Supreme Court, however, has viewed with disfavor statutes which specify trials de novo and which attempt to confer original jurisdiction on trial courts over policy matters which are the responsibility of the legislative and executive branches. Constitutional principles of separate governmental powers require that the judiciary refrain from de novo review of administrative decisions. Through certiorari, constitutional guarantees are protected when a reviewing court exercises only limited jurisdiction over the decisions of administrative agencies.\n\nThere are nevertheless situations in which review is obtained on the record in the district court pursuant to specific statutes that were not changed to require review in the court of appeals. Some statutes prescribe district court review without reference to the manner or scope of review.\n\nThe Minnesota court of appeals has held that evidence not contained in the administrative record and submitted for the first time to the district court on review may be considered for limited purposes only. The court may consider evidence outside the administrative record when (1) the agency’s failure to explain its action frustrates judicial review; (2) additional evidence is necessary to explain technical terms or complex subject matter involved in the agency action; (3) the agency failed to consider information relevant to making its decision; or (4) plaintiffs make a showing that the agency acted in bad faith. If the evidence submitted outside the administrative record demonstrates that the agency’s effort was clearly inadequate or that the agency failed to set forth widely shared scientific views, the court’s proper function is to remand to the agency for correction of the agency’s errors.\n\n15.3.3 Extraordinary Writs\n\nThe writs of certiorari, mandamus, prohibition, and quo warranto are governed by statutes, by the rules of civil procedure, and by the rules of civil appellate procedure. The writ most likely to be used for purposes of reviewing an agency action already taken is the writ of certiorari.\n\n15.3.3(1) Certiorari\n\nReview under the APA, as discussed in § 15.3.1, is accomplished by writ of certiorari to the court of appeals, and other statutes prescribe certiorari review by the court of appeals for particular cases. Certiorari is also the usual method for reviewing the action of an agency that has acted in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity when no other avenue of review is prescribed. However, the Minnesota Supreme Court decided that the Metropolitan Council’s approval of a bridge project was not a quasi-judicial decision and was therefore not reviewable by writ of certiorari. The Court summarized the three indicia of quasi-judicial actions as follows: (1) investigation into a disputed claim and weighing of evidentiary facts; (2) application of those facts to a prescribed standard; and (3) a binding decision regarding the disputed claim. Certiorari is not available to review legislative or purely ministerial acts of administrative agencies or officers. And it is not a choice that is available when another method of appeal is provided unless the statute makes optional the procedure to be followed in obtaining review.\n\nReview by certiorari is limited to the record of the proceeding before the agency. Unless otherwise prescribed by statute or appellate rule, the writ must be issued and served within sixty days after receipt of notice of the action to be reviewed. “Due notice” under Minnesota Statutes section 606.01 requires, at a minimum, written notice that is reasonably calculated to reach the person affected. The prevailing party on a writ of certiorari shall be entitled to an award of costs against the adverse party, and the court of appeals may award double costs if the writ is brought for the purpose of “delay or vexation.” The writ may be dismissed, with costs and disbursements awarded, if it is issued contrary to the provisions of chapter 606 or not served within sixty days. Writs of certiorari may be issued by the district courts, the court of appeals, and the supreme court. The writ is rarely issued by the supreme court, except that certiorari review in the supreme court is prescribed for decisions of the workers’ compensation court of appeals and the tax court. Rules 115 and 116 of the rules of civil appellate procedure govern certiorari proceedings in the court of appeals and supreme court, respectively, unless different procedures are prescribed by statute.\n\nThe question remains whether the district courts retain any certiorari jurisdiction. Historically, this writ was usually issued in the district courts rather than the supreme court, because the former were the courts of general jurisdiction. This is no longer the case. Since the creation of the court of appeals, most statutes providing for on-the-record review of state agency actions have been amended to require certiorari review in the court of appeals. Moreover, the APA is now a catchall statute that requires court of appeals review of state agency actions for which no other statutory review procedure is prescribed.\n\nIn regard to local agencies, there was initially no legislative effort to direct review of their decisions to the court of appeals. In 1985, Minnesota Statutes section 480A.06, subdivision 3, was amended to provide for certiorari review in the court of appeals of decisions of all agencies and officials. Even before this amendment, however, the court of appeals asserted jurisdiction over local agency actions and deemed its jurisdiction to be exclusive. Minnesota Statutes section 606.01 provides a 60-day deadline for issuance of the writ.\n\n15.3.3(2) Mandamus\n\nThe writ of mandamus may be used “to compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins as a duty.” It may require the agency “to exercise its judgment or proceed to the discharge of any of its functions,” but it does not provide a means of controlling discretion or reviewing an action once it is taken. When an official has some discretion on how to perform a duty, mandamus may compel that the official exercise that discretion but may not control how that discretion is exercised. The writ will not issue when there is an adequate remedy at law, and the courts are hostile to its use as a “judicial short-cut.”\n\nThe district courts have exclusive jurisdiction over writs of mandamus except when the writ is to be directed to a district court or a judge thereof, or to the court of appeals or a judge thereof, in which case the writ must issue from the court of appeals or supreme court respectively.\n\nStatutory provisions governing the writ of mandamus are in Minnesota Statutes chapter 586. These provisions control over conflicting provisions in the rules of civil procedure. Additional provisions governing mandamus from the court of appeals and supreme court are in rules 120 and 121 of the rules of civil appellate procedure.\n\n15.3.3(3) Prohibition\n\nThe writ of prohibition may be used to restrain an agency from acting on a matter that is beyond its authority or in which it lacks jurisdiction. It is not a means of reviewing an agency action after it is taken. The writ is available when the agency is taking or about to take judicial or quasi-judicial action, the agency is or will be exceeding its authority or jurisdiction, the petitioner has no other adequate remedy, and the petitioner will be irreparably injured.\n\nThis writ is not among those listed in Minnesota Statutes section 484.03 as being within the jurisdiction of the district courts. It is within the jurisdiction of the supreme court. Although it is not identified explicitly as being within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, appellate rule 120 contemplates the issuance of such writs by the court of appeals, at least with respect to actions of lower courts. It is consistent with the policies behind the creation of the court of appeals and the exercise by the court of appeals of its certiorari jurisdiction to anticipate that the court of appeals would issue writs of prohibition to government agencies and officials.\n\n15.3.3(4) Quo Warranto\n\nThis writ is designed “to correct the usurpation, misuser, or nonuser of a public office.” It is intended to challenge an ongoing and unauthorized exercise of official or corporate power. Although it is generally not available to review an agency action, it has been used to review an annexation proceeding. It is not available if there is an adequate legal or equitable remedy. This writ is among those within the express jurisdiction of both the district courts and the supreme court. The supreme court has directed the writ to be filed in districts court in the first instance. No specific mention is made of it in the statute defining the jurisdiction of the court of appeals. Despite the statutory provisions, however, the writ has not been abolished for purposes of the rules of civil procedure, while there is no reference to it in the rules of civil appellate procedure.\n\n15.3.4 Injunctive and Declaratory Relief\n\nInjunctive relief is not ordinarily available to review actions already taken by administrative agencies. The right to review of the merits of an agency action under the APA or other certiorari or statutory proceedings is normally, though not always, an adequate remedy that would preclude injunctive proceedings. If an injunction is sought before the completion of action by the agency, one will encounter the doctrines of finality and exhaustion of administrative remedies.\n\nA declaratory judgment is a broad and flexible remedy, not encumbered, for example, with the requirements that there be no other adequate remedy or that there be irreparable injury. The only substantial prerequisite is that there be a justiciable controversy. When there is an established statutory avenue of review for an agency action already taken, however, that avenue is exclusive, and declaratory judgment is not appropriate. Declaratory judgment is useful, and perhaps even the prescribed procedure, when challenging agency actions other than those categorized as contested cases. All injunctive and declaratory judgment proceedings, except for judicial review of rules, must originate in the district court.\n\n15.4 Scope of Review\n\nThis section will focus on the scope of review provided under section 14.69 of the APA. Virtually all appellate review of state agency actions is now expressly pursuant to this statute. Even before the 1983 amendments directing judicial review through the APA, the Minnesota Supreme Court had established a policy of applying the APA scope of review to decisions of all state agencies, even those with apparently conflicting appeal statutes, unless a particular statute expressly required a trial de novo.\n\n15.4.1 Section 14.69: Generally\n\nMinnesota Statutes, section 14.69 (2014), provides in its entirety as follows:\n\nIn a judicial review under sections 14.63 to 14.68, the court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantial rights of the petitioners may have been prejudiced because the administrative finding, inferences, conclusion, or decisions are:\n\n(a) in violation of constitutional provisions; or\n\n(b) in excess of the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the agency; or\n\n(c) made upon unlawful procedure; or\n\n(d) affected by other error of law; or\n\n(e) unsupported by substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted; or\n\n(f) arbitrary or capricious.\n\nPursuant to section 14.69, the court of appeals may affirm, remand, reverse, or modify the agency decision. While only reversal and modification are made expressly subject to the holding on appeal that the petitioner’s rights have been prejudiced on the basis of one or more of the six prescribed grounds for review, a frequent remedy on a determination of improper agency action is a remand for further proceedings. Modification of the agency decision is a “drastic remedy” that is “viewed with disfavor” and that is “reserved for only extraordinary situations.” The preferred course is for the appellate court either to reverse the agency action or to remand it for further proceedings.\n\nThe scope of review prescribed in section 14.69 applies only to the quasi-judicial decisions of an agency. Quasi-judicial conduct is marked by: (1) an investigation into a disputed claim; (2) an application of those facts to a prescribed standard; and (3) a decision binding on all the parties. The term “quasi-judicial” applies only to those administrative decisions which are based on evidentiary facts and which resolve disputed claims of rights. A much more limited review is applied to legislative determinations. Decisions on certain issues, even within the context of a contested case proceeding, may be legislative in character and therefore subject to the more limited scope of review. When an agency acts in a legislative capacity, the standard of review is whether the agency exceeded its statutory authority. Because agency decisionmakers have specialized knowledge and expertise, it is a “fundamental concept” that their decisions enjoy “a presumption of correctness” and “administrative regularity. ” The reviewing court will not substitute its judgment for that of the agency on technical matters, and the responsibility for resolving conflicts in testimony and determining the weight to be given it and the inferences to be drawn from it rests with the agency. Judicial deference extends, however, only to matters within the peculiar expertise of the agency. If the agency decision turns on a question of law or on matters in which the court has factual knowledge superior to that of the agency, the court will not defer to the agency. But an agency’s construction of a statute is entitled to some weight when the statutory language is technical in nature and the agency’s interpretation is one of longstanding application.\n\nIn the 2007 case In re Cities of Annandale & Maple Lake NPDES/SDS Permit Issuance for the Discharge of Treated Wastewater, the Minnesota Supreme Court addressed for the first time the issue of whether courts should defer to a state agency’s interpretation of a federal regulation where the state is charged with enforcing and administering the federal regulation. In this decision, reversing the court of appeals, the supreme court found that the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) was charged with day-to-day responsibility for enforcing and administering 40 CFR § 122.4(i), such that the regulation is properly characterized as the MPCA’s own regulation. Drawing from the federal standard for agency deference in Chevron, the Minnesota court concluded that the regulation is unclear and susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation and, therefore, the MPCA’s expertise and special knowledge may be considered when determining whether MPCA’s interpretation of the federal regulation is reasonable. Finally, the court found that MPCA’s interpretation of the regulation was reasonable and deferred to that interpretation. The Annandale decision summarizes, interprets, and distinguishes several of the court’s earlier cases involving deference to an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations, including Reserve Mining, St. Otto’s Home, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota, Eller Media, and Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy v. MPCA.\n\nBecause review by the court of appeals is appellate in nature, a lower court’s decision will not be given any particular deference if it reaches the state supreme court. When agency actions were reviewed initially in the district courts, the supreme court made it clear that it would review the agency record independently; its review of a district court decision would not include the deference usually accorded to the findings of a trial court, because the district court was not acting in a fact-finding capacity. District court review was therefore often an exercise in futility, because it was essentially duplicated in the supreme court. This was a major factor prompting the changes in the APA giving the court of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review state agency actions. With appeal to the supreme court now being discretionary, the initial appellate review of an agency action will usually be the last.\n\n15.4.2 Section 14.69: The Six Grounds for Review of Agency Action\n\n15.4.2(1) In Violation of Constitutional Provisions\n\nAgency action taken pursuant to an unconstitutional enabling statute or an unconstitutional agency rule is invalid and will be overturned. The decision may also be unconstitutional because of procedural irregularities so substantial as to deny due process. Constitutional questions based on procedure will not be frequent, however, because of the extent to which procedural fairness is assured by the APA and the rules of the office of administrative hearings (OAH).\n\nBecause there is no statute or rule expressly proscribing bias on the part of the agency decisionmaker, this question will most likely arise as a constitutional one. Due process requires an impartial decisionmaker. There is a substantial body of law on this question at the federal level that generally distinguishes among several types of bias. A decisionmaker is not necessarily disqualified because of a preconceived position about the law, policy, or legislative facts but may be disqualified because of prejudgment of issues relating to adjudicative facts, a personal prejudice or partiality, or a self-interest in the proceedings. A decisionmaker otherwise incapacitated by bias may decide a case when necessity requires it, but in such a case, the reviewing court will examine the agency decision with special scrutiny. One state has sustained a challenge to agency action when there is an appearance of partiality, even if actual bias is not shown.\n\n15.4.2(2) In Excess of Agency Authority or Jurisdiction\n\nDecisions that are in excess of the agency’s statutory authority or jurisdiction will be reversed. When an agency acts in a legislative capacity, the standard of review applied is whether the agency exceeded its statutory authority. This may also be a basis for an action to preclude agency action before it is taken, as discussed in sections 7.1.4 and 15.2.2 in this volume. The party seeking appellate review of an agency’s action has the burden of proving that the agency exceeded its statutory authority or jurisdiction. The agency need not have express authority for its actions. Authority that may be implied from the agency’s express authority is adequate.\n\n15.4.2(3) Made on Unlawful Procedure\n\nProcedural irregularities may exist in the form of violations of the procedural requirements of the APA, the rules of the OAH, or the agency’s own procedural rules.\n\nSection 14.69 expressly requires a showing that the improper procedure may have prejudiced the substantial rights of the petitioner. The agency decision will not be reversed without this showing of prejudice.\n\nAlthough the merits of the agency decision will be reviewed only on the record, additional evidence may be taken in conjunction with the appeal in order to determine the essential facts pertaining to alleged procedural defects that are not shown on the record. The court of appeals may transfer the case to the district court to take testimony and to decide the procedural issues, and that decision may be appealed as in other civil cases.\n\nLimited discovery is permissible in order to assist in the determination of procedural questions. For example, whether those involved in the decision-making process properly followed the procedures required by law. Such discovery has been limited and tightly regulated. Written interrogatories may be submitted within thirty days of the date of the appeal. The questions are limited to the following:\n\nWhether the agency adhered to all statutory and administrative procedural rules;\n\nIf not, what deviations occurred;\n\nWhether the agency official read the entire record prior to rendering a decision;\n\nWhether the agency official relied on information outside the record in making the decision;\n\nIf yes, what information was relied upon outside of the record in making the decision.\n\nIf this discovery reveals no new evidence, the agency decisionmakers should not be called to testify at a trial. These restrictions are laid down in the last Minnesota Supreme Court opinion on this issue, in which the court was critical of the delay in the appeal process caused by discovery conducted under the rule of its earlier opinions. Therefore, the inference is that the interrogatories above are the only permissible means of discovery. Discovery may not be used to probe the “mental processes” by which a decision is made or “the process of judicial decision-making which is judgmental rather than procedural in nature.”\n\n15.4.2(4) Affected by Other Error of Law\n\nOn a question of law, the court is free to substitute its judgment for that of the agency. It is not bound by the decision of the agency and need not defer to agency expertise.\n\nAgency interpretation of a statute “may be entitled to some weight” if the statute is technical in nature and the agency’s interpretation is a long-standing one. The court has no obligation to respect administrative interpretation of a statute if it is one of first impression and the statute is not ambiguous, particularly when the agency interpretation expands its jurisdiction. Courts will defer to an agency’s interpretation of its own rule if the rule is so technical that only a specialized agency can properly understand it, but courts will not defer to agency interpretation if the language or standard in the rule is clear and understandable.\n\nDeference also extends to any agency’s expertise and special knowledge in the interpretation of statutes or federal regulation that the agency is charged with administering. Courts will give “considerable deference” to an agency’s construction of its own rule when the rule is unclear or susceptible to different interpretations. An agency’s interpretation of an ambiguous rule will be upheld if it is reasonable. When application of a regulation is “primarily factual and necessarily requires application of the agency’s technical knowledge and expertise to the facts present” deference will also be granted to an agency’s expertise and knowledge. However, a long-standing administrative practice or interpretation will be invalidated if it is contrary to the plain meaning of the statute.\n\nIn the 2007 case In re Annandale, the Minnesota Supreme Court summarized what factors the courts should consider when determining whether to give deference to an agency’s interpretation:\n\nIn summary, we glean from our case law that review of an agency’s interpretation of its own regulations is a question of law that courts review de novo. When answering this question, there are several factors courts need to consider when determining whether to give deference to an agency’s interpretation. These factors include whether the agency is legally required to enforce and administer the regulation under review and whether the meaning of the words in the regulation is clear and unambiguous or is unclear and susceptible to different reasonable interpretations— ambiguous. If a court concludes the meaning of the words in the regulation is clear and unambiguous, it need not defer to the agency’s interpretation and may substitute its own judgment for that of the agency. If a court concludes that the meaning of the words in an agency’s regulation is unclear and susceptible to different reasonable interpretations, the court must then determine whether the agency’s interpretation is reasonable. When determining whether an agency’s interpretation is reasonable, courts may consider the agency’s expertise and special knowledge, especially when the construction of the regulation’s language is so technical in nature that the agency’s field of technical training, education, and experience is necessary to understand the regulation. When a court concludes that the language of the agency’s regulation is unclear and susceptible to different reasonable interpretations and that the agency’s interpretation of the regulation is reasonable, then the court will generally defer to the agency’s interpretation.\n\nThese principles have been applied in several subsequent cases weighing deference to an agency’s interpretation.\n\n15.4.2(5) Unsupported by Substantial Evidence\n\nWhen an agency, acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, makes factual determinations and resolves disputed claims of rights, the applicable standard of review for reviewing those factual determinations is the substantial evidence test. Judicial deference to the agency reaches its peak here and with the arbitrary or capricious standard. Obtaining a reversal of the agency action on either basis is difficult.\n\nFactual determinations of the agency will be sustained unless they are not supported by “substantial evidence in view of the entire record as submitted. ” This test applies only to the factual findings made by the agency decisionmaker. It does not apply to conclusions or conclusions of law. As is the case with appellate review of jury verdicts or trial court findings of fact, the court grants a very substantial deference to the agency findings of fact.\n\nConflicts in testimony, the weight to be given facts, the credibility of witnesses, and inferences to be drawn from the evidence are to be resolved by the agency; the court may not exercise its own judgment or substitute its own findings of fact. The entire record must be considered, rather than simply focusing on the evidence that relates expressly to a specific finding.\n\nThe comprehensive and accepted definition of substantial evidence was first stated by the Minnesota Supreme Court in Reserve Mining Co. v. Herbst.\n\nWe view that by the “substantial evidence” test is meant: 1) such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; 2) more than a scintilla of evidence; 3) more than “some evidence”; 4) more than “any evidence”; and 5) evidence considered in its entirety.\n\nThe first component of the Reserve Mining definition, namely, “such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion,” has become a common short-form definition of substantial evidence. Whatever definition is used, the petitioner’s burden in seeking to overturn an agency finding of fact is “heavy.”\n\nThe Reserve Mining definition has been called a “quantitative” test. Substantial evidence also includes a qualitative component, however. Although the rules of evidence are not strictly applied in agency proceedings, a decision is not supported by substantial evidence where all the supporting evidence is “inherently unreliable,” such as hearsay that would be inadmissible in a judicial proceeding. There is also a third component, one that goes not to the nature of the supporting evidence but to the way in which that evidence is explained or evaluated by the agency in its findings.\n\nPrior to 1983, the adequacy of the agency’s findings (as opposed to the sufficiency of the underlying evidence) was essentially a procedural matter. Substantial evidence review could not occur if the findings were inadequate, and the case would be remanded for additional or amended findings before judicial review could proceed. As a result of the Minnesota Supreme Court’s opinion in Minnesota Power & Light Co. v. Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, however, it appears that substantiality of the evidence can be controlled by the manner in which it is evaluated by the agency in its findings.\n\nIn Minnesota Power & Light Co., the supreme court had initially affirmed a district court ruling that the agency decision was not supported by substantial evidence. On remand, the agency did not take additional evidence. It merely issued additional findings of fact and conclusions of law detailing the original evidence and explaining in greater detail the reasons for its decision. The district court reversed again because it believed that “further explanation or rationalization of the PUC’s finding cannot create ‘substantial evidence.’” The supreme court stated the issue to be “[w]hether, upon remand for the lack of substantial evidence to support an agency’s ruling, the [substantial evidence] standard may be met, without the submission of further evidence, by the agency’s expert analysis of the record, setting forth explanations for its conclusions. ” It answered this question affirmatively, holding that “we are now satisfied that the PUC’s order is supported by substantial evidence. ”\n\n15.4.2(6) Arbitrary or Capricious\n\nFor a time it appeared that arbitrary or capricious was an entirely separate standard of review that did not duplicate or overlap the substantial evidence test. In Reserve Mining Co. v. Herbst, a leading case for the articulation of many of the principles of judicial review, the Minnesota Supreme Court stated that the substantial evidence standard applies to an agency’s findings, while the arbitrary or capricious standard applies to its conclusions. This distinction was not supported by the statutory language. However, the arbitrary or capricious standard has since been applied to the agency’s findings, determination, action, decision, and order.\n\nThe arbitrary or capricious standard incorporates a high degree of judicial deference to the agency, with the court declining to substitute its judgment for that of the agency. As used in the APA, the phrase arbitrary or capricious has essentially been defined as requiring a showing that the agency’s determination “represents its will and not its judgment. ” If a “decision represents a reasonable judgment, ” it is not arbitrary or capricious. If the decision is not “entirely wrong” or not “clearly wrong, ” the court will not substitute its judgment. So long as an agency engaged in reasoned decision-making, the court will affirm, even though it may have reached a different conclusion had it been the factfinder. Moreover, “[where there is room for two opinions on the matter, such action is not ‘arbitrary and capricious,’ even though it may be believed that an erroneous conclusion has been reached. ” An agency decision on the amount of time needed to correct a violation is reviewed under the arbitrary and capricious standard and a reviewing court will likely defer to the agency as to a deadline for correction of the violation where the matter is within the agency’s expertise.\n\nAn agency action is arbitrary and capricious if:the agency relied on factors which the legislature had not intended it to consider, if it entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, if it offered an explanation for the decision that runs counter to the evidence, or if the decision is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency expertise. The reviewing court may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency has not given, but must uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path is reasonably discernible.\n\nRejection by an agency of an ALJ’s findings or recommendation is arbitrary or capricious if the agency gives no reason for rejecting them, or if the decision lacks “any rational basis”. In cases of “great importance,” an agency decision made without written findings and reasons is arbitrary and capricious even though the agency was not required to follow contested case procedures."
