        "text": "Actor Ron Silver, who won a Tony Award as a take-no-prisoners Hollywood producer in David Mamet's \"Speed-the-Plow\" and did a political about-face from loyal Democrat to Republican activist after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, died Sunday at the age of 62.\n\n\"Ron Silver died peacefully in his sleep with his family around him early Sunday morning\" in New York City, said Robin Bronk, executive director of the Creative Coalition, which Silver helped found. \"He had been fighting esophageal cancer for two years.\"\n\nSilver, an Emmy nominee for a recurring role as a slick strategist for liberal President Jed Bartlet on \"The West Wing,\" had a long history of balancing acting with left-leaning social and political causes.\n\nBut after the 2001 terrorist attacks, longtime Democrat Silver turned heads in Hollywood with outspoken support of President George W. Bush over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nSilver spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention, began referring to himself as a \"9/11 Republican\" and reregistered as an independent voter.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press a month later, Silver said his support for the war on terror was costing him work in liberal-minded Hollywood.\n\n\"It's affected me very badly. I can't point to a person or a job I've lost, but this community is not very pluralistic,\" Silver told the AP. \"I haven't worked for 10 months.\"\n\nHis switch to a more conservative image threatened to overshadow an esteemed career on stage, television and film, along with his long history of activism, which included co-founding the nonpartisan Creative Coalition, an advocacy group for entertainers.\n\n\"He was a talented actor, a scholar and a great believer in participatory democracy,\" Bronk said Sunday evening. \"He was an activist who became a great artist and his contributions will never be forgotten.\"\n\nHis big-screen credits included \"Ali,\" \"Reversal of Fortune,\" \"Enemies: A Love Story,\" \"Silkwood\" and \"Semi-Tough.\"\n\nBesides \"The West Wing,\" Silver was a regular or had recurring roles on such TV shows as \"Veronica's Closet,\" \"Chicago Hope\" and \"Wiseguy.\" He directed and costarred in the 1993 TV movie \"Lifepod,\" a science-fiction update of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Lifeboat.\"\n\nSilver's Tony for \"Speed-the-Plow\" came in 1988, a year after he earned his first Emmy nomination, for the murder thriller \"Billionaire Boys Club.\"\n\nSilver did still find work despite his conservative shift, appearing in episodes of \"Law & Order\" and \"Crossing Jordan\" and such movies as \"Find Me Guilty\" and the Ten Commandments comedy \"The Ten.\"\n\nHe continued his recurring role on \"The West Wing,\" joking that he faced some taunting over his views from co-workers on the show that took place in a fiercely liberal White House administration.\n\n\"Often when I walked onto the set of 'The West Wing' some of my colleagues would greet me with a chanting of 'Ron, Ron, the neo-con.' It was all done in fun but it had an edge,\" Silver wrote in a Nov. 15, 2007, entry of his blog on the Pajamas Media Web site.\n\nSilver's on-screen work rankled liberals, too. He narrated 2004's \"Fahrenhype 9/11,\" a deconstruction of Michael Moore's Bush-bashing hit documentary \"Fahrenheit 9/11.\"\n\n\"Michael Moore and that faction of the party was one of the factors that did not let me support the Democratic nominee this year,\" Silver told the AP in 2004. \"He is a charlatan in a clown suit.\"\n\nBorn July 2, 1946, in New York City, he was the son of Irving and May Silver. His father worked in New York's garment industry and his mother was a teacher.\n\nEarning a bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo and a master's degree in Chinese history from St. John's University, Silver also studied drama at the Herbert Berghof Studio and the Actors Studio.\n\nIn the 1970s, he gradually moved from theater work in New York City into television and film, his early credits including \"The Mac Davis Show,\" \"Rhoda\" and \"The Stockard Channing Show.\"\n\nSilver and ex-wife Lynne Miller had a son, Adam, and daughter, Alexandra.\n\nNo matter on which end of the political spectrum his activism fell, Silver viewed such involvement as something of a duty for entertainers.\n\n\"I think there's almost an obligation,\" Silver said in a 1991 interview with the AP. \"Many of us are very well compensated for work which a lot of people would love to do. And we also have a lot of leisure time in between jobs. ...\n\n\"They say that Hollywood is sex without substance, and Washington is substance without sex, so maybe the marriage of the two is mutually intriguing.\""
