        "text": "Michael Mann's bio-pic of Ali was a film I missed in theaters this past December simply because the 157 minute movie came out around the same time as another three-hour flick, The Lord of the Rings. If it were released at any other time of the year, I would've been there opening day.\n\nWill Smith earned an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of the great Muhammad Ali, and Jon Voight received the same honor just for pulling off a great Howard Cosell. Michael Mann's direction is tight here, the look of the film is excellent, and it moves along at a decent pace despite its length.\n\nThe Movie\n\nAli begins right at Cassius Clay's fight against Liston, and this first bout in the film establishes the quality that's evident throughout the movie. They basically recreated the fight blow-by-blow, so what you see is a very good recreation of it.\n\nThe film moves on and spends a lot of time showing Ali's relationship with Malcom X and his growth as a civil rights figure. In between the extensive scenes showing his exploits out of the ring, we see the following fights recreated:\n\nAli vs. Liston II\n\nAli vs. Terrell\n\nAli vs. Quarry\n\nAli vs. Frazier\n\nThe Rumble in the Jungle\n\nThe film ends with Ali's KO victory over Foreman in Ziare, and in a way that's a good thing. It ends the film on a very high note, which helps the movie. There is a small title card at the end of the film that explains Ali's divorces after The Rumble in the Jungle, and mentions him losing and regaining the title in 1978. We're spared the details on his current battle with Parkinson's as we know all about that and it would've ended the film on a sad note.\n\nThere are times when Will Smith completely vanishes and Ali is there in his place, his performance is that good in moments. Most convincingly is his speech, which can sound so much like the young Ali that it's scary. However once in a while it falters and Will Smith appears, which harms the illusion a bit.\n\nMann's camera work is great, especially during the fights where several angles were used to put you right in the middle of the flying punches and painful blows.\n\nThere's a lot that I like in the film besides the fights. I especially enjoy the early scenes with Clay on the streets as the original people's champ as well as a little scene of Ali watching a TV show about termites when Malcolm X comes and asks him to go to Africa with him.\n\nHardcore boxing fans who followed Ali's life and career won't find too much new here, but it's definitely an entertaining (and long) film about one of the biggest public figures of the 20th Century.\n\n8 out of 10\n\nThe Video\n\nColumbia has given Ali a nice 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer that handles the varying image types in the film very well. There are a lot of scenes with harsh contrast and bright light, which come through well here, and the scenes in the ring with very dark backgrounds are handled just as good.\n\nIf it weren't for a bit of edge enhancement (most noticeable with the on-screen text), the transfer would have scored better, but it's OK for what's there.\n\n8 out of 10\n\nThe Audio\n\nThe Dolby 5.1 mix here fares a bit better than the transfer. Dialog and ambience comes through crystal clear, and the track handles the large sound of a noisy arena very well. When Ali enters the stadium in Ziare at the end of the film, the sound of the crowd slowly builds as he walks through the tunnel until it explodes to fill the entire room when he gets out into the open. Very nice.\n\n9 out of 10\n\nThe Extras\n\nWhere's the beef?\n\nThere's nothing here except the trailer for Ali, the Men in Black II teaser trailer, and the awesome trailer for Spider-Man that features this great shot:\n\nIt's even in anamorphic widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1! (If you want a high-resolution snap of that image for desktop wallpaper, click here.)\n\nWhere's the Michael Mann and Will Smith commentary? Where are the behind the scenes featurettes showing Smith and Ali hanging out? Sigh. We better not have long to wait for the Special Edition!\n\n1 out of 10\n\nComments\n\nAli is a really good film, and this DVD gives it a good A/V presentation, but there are no extras! If you love the movie and can live without the extras, go ahead and pick it up. But if you're like most of us DVD fans, you should probably wait for a Special Edition to arrive.\n\nOverall Score 5 out of 10"
