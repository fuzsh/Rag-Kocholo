        "text": "Ron Silver began his career in New York City cooking breakfast at the legendary Restaurant Florent in the Meatpacking District. After leaving to pursue his passion for baking pies, he opened Bubby's Pie Co. on Thanksgiving in 1990. Ron began selling his pies to restaurants and his Tribeca neighbors out of a small kitchen at the corner of Hudson and North Moore Street. Breakfast and Bubby's famous weekend brunch followed, introducing NYC to the eatery’s famous pancakes. Now open all day, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner, Bubby's has a loyal following and is a destination for locals and tourists alike. With a second location at the base of The High Line in the Meatpacking District, as well as seven locations in Tokyo, Bubby’s remains a beloved restaurant and pie shop, celebrating 28 years of classic, thoughtfully sourced, made-from-scratch American cooking. Born in Brooklyn and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, Ron has held true to his roots of traditional, American, home-cooked food. Bubby’s patrons continue to come back for true, impeccably and locally sourced, comfort food, made by hand and culled from his mother and grandmother’s recipes. His mission has remained the same from that first day: to welcome each person as though they are guests in the Silver family home and to raise awareness of the virtue of American food. A firm believer in transparent, straightforward and safe cannabis use, Ron is a leader in edible cannabis innovations outside of the restaurant. In May 2018, he founded Azuca, a line of patent-pending, fast-acting cannabis edibles made from chef-quality, all-natural ingredients. As chief creative officer of Azuca, Ron combines his experience as a chef and entrepreneur, filling the cannabis industry’s demand for a trustworthy edible product that offers a fast-acting, consistent effect. Ron is the co-author of two cookbooks, \"Bubby’s Homemade Pies\" and \"Bubby’s Brunch Cookbook.\" He lives in Tribeca with his wife Melissa (co-owner of Bubby’s) and four children, and will speak to ICE students about how he established a landmark brand built on pies and pancakes."
