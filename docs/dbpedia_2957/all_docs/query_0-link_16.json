        "text": "Actor Ron Silver, who won a Tony Award as a take-no-prisoners Hollywood producer in David Mamet’s “Speed-the-Plow” and did an about-face from loyal Democrat to Republican activist after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, died yesterday in New York at the age of 62.\n\nRobin Bronk, the executive director of the Creative Coalition, which Silver helped found, said Mr. Silver had been fighting esophageal cancer for two years.\n\nMr. Silver, an Emmy Award nominee for a recurring role as a slick strategist for liberal President Jed Bartlet on “The West Wing,” had a long history of balancing acting with left-leaning social and political causes.\n\nBut after the 2001 terrorist attacks, the longtime Democrat turned heads in Hollywood with his outspoken support of President George W. Bush over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nMr. Silver spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention, began referring to himself as a “9/11 Republican” and re-registered as an independent.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press a month later, Mr. Silver said his support for Bush was costing him work in liberal-minded Hollywood.\n\n“It’s affected me very badly. I can’t point to a person or a job I’ve lost, but this community is not very pluralistic,” Mr. Silver told the AP. “I haven’t worked for 10 months.”\n\nMr. Silver still found work, appearing in several episodes of “Law & Order” and “Crossing Jordan” and such movies as “Find Me Guilty” and the Ten Commandments comedy “The Ten.”\n\nHis activism was coupled with an esteemed career on stage, television and film.\n\nMr. Silver was born July 2, 1946, in New York, the son of Irving and May Silver. His father worked in New York’s garment industry and his mother was a teacher.\n\nHe earned a bachelor’s degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo and a master’s degree in Chinese history from St. John’s University. Mr. Silver also studied drama at the Herbert Berghof Studio and the Actors Studio.\n\nIn the 1970s, he gradually moved from theater work in New York City into television and film, his early credits including “The Mac Davis Show,” “Rhoda” and “The Stockard Channing Show.”\n\nMr. Silver’s Tony for “Speed-the-Plow” came in 1988, a year after he earned his first Emmy nomination, for the murder thriller “Billionaire Boys Club.”\n\nHis big-screen credits included “Ali,” “Reversal of Fortune,” “Enemies: A Love Story,” “Silkwood” and “Semi-Tough.”\n\nBesides “The West Wing,” Mr. Silver was a regular or had recurring roles on such TV shows as “Veronica’s Closet,” “Chicago Hope” and “Wiseguy.” He directed and co-starred in the 1993 TV movie “Lifepod,” a science-fiction update of Alfred Hitchcock’s “Lifeboat.”\n\nMr. Silver and his former wife, Lynne Miller, had a son, Adam, and daughter, Alexandra."
