        "meta_description": "Epic biopic of how Cassius Clay (Will Smith) became Muhammad Ali. The film concentrates on the decade from 1964, when Ali defeated Sonny Liston for the heavyweight crown, to 1974, when he defeated George Foreman in Zaire to regain the crown. Within those 10 years Ali embraced Islam, got married a few times, changed his name and refused military induction and a trip to Vietnam. Also with Jamie Foxx, Jon Voight, Mario Van Peebles, Ron Silver, Jeffrey Wright, Mykelti Williamson, Jada Pinkett Smith, Nona Gaye, Michael Bentt, James N. Toney, Charles Shufford and Albert Hall [2:47]",

        "text": "VIOLENCE/GORE 6 - A man is shot in the chest with a shotgun and we see many bloody holes in his shirt as he falls back and jerks a bit, and he is shot a few more times with handguns as he lies still. A man is shot and lies dead, with a spreading pool of blood under his head (we hear the shot and then see the body). We see a photograph in a newspaper that shows a man's battered face and hear that he was lynched. There is a reference to a man's eye having been cut out and his neck having been tied with barbed wire. There is a reference to the 1963 Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama where four young girls died. A woman talks about her father having been shot. There are several boxing scenes with varying degrees of detail, but all show many hard and fast punches; one bout shows a man being punched repeatedly in the body as he is pinned on the ropes, there are many face and head punches and a punch in the jaw makes a boxer dizzy (we see a bruised cheek). A championship bout shows many hard and fast punches being landed in a man's body and face (one boxer has a bloody eye and a swollen face), one shows a boxer with a very bloody eyebrow, one shows a boxer with a puffy and bruised eye, one shows a boxer with very bruised and swollen eyes and face, one shows many punches being landed (one boxer has very swollen eyes), one shows a man being knocked out (he falls hard to the mat and is unconscious), one shows a boxer fall to his knees and then he falls flat on his back. During a boxing match one boxer gets something in his eyes which makes it impossible for him to see and he is punched repeatedly. We see a boxer working out on a heavy bag and hear the thundering punches as they hit. We see a scene of fires burning in the streets. A man throws a bottle against a wall, shattering it and smacks a man in the face. A man shoves another man in the face. A man kicks a chair in frustration, a man punches the steering wheel of his car repeatedly, in frustration. There are many instances of verbal threats. Crowds of people chant \"Ali kill him.\" A man and woman argue.\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|"
