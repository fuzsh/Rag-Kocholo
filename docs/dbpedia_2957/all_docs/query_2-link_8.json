        "text": "He taught Spanish for several years in the 1960s at The Roosevelt School, a Jewish boarding school in Shippan Point, Stamford, Connecticut. Because of his knowledge of Chinese, he got a job with the US Government and traveled to Taiwan in the early 1970s.\n\nWas exempt from the draft during the Vietnam War era. He traveled to Vietnam, however, as well as Cambodia, India, Japan and the Soviet Union in the late 1960s.\n\nA lifelong Democrat of the Harry Truman mold (his description), he broke with the Democratic Party over the \"war on terrorism\" and spoke at the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City. Had re-registered as an Independent. This about-face was written into his character arc on The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999) but, according to him, also put him at odds with some of his coworkers and greatly reduced the number of roles he was offered thereafter.\n\nBy inclination I am more of a politician than I am an actor. I care more about public policy. I care more about pro-choice, the environment, homelessness, and nuclear issues than I do about any part.\n\n[on actors getting involved in politics] I think there's almost an obligation. Many of us are very well compensated for work which a lot of people would love to do. And we also have a lot of leisure time in between jobs... They say that Hollywood is sex without substance, and Washington is substance without sex, so maybe the marriage of the two is mutually intriguing.\n\n[on his support for George W. Bush] It's affected me very badly. I can't point to a person or a job I've lost, but this community is not very pluralistic. I haven't worked for 10 months.\n\nOften when I walked onto the set of The West Wing: Im Zentrum der Macht (1999) some of my colleagues would greet me with a chanting of \"Ron, Ron, the neo-con.\" It was all done in fun but it had an edge."
