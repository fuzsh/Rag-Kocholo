        "text": "Week 2: Boxing with Laila Ali, Stand-Up Comedy with Amy Schumer\n\nKaitlyn is anxious to begin her journey to find the love of her life and the men are eager to start dating the vivacious Bachelorette. However, will the men who had a stronger connection to Britt have a target on their back? What happened to Brady, who was so smitten with Britt that he left the show in a sweeping romantic gesture? The men are taught to throw a punch by one of the best â boxing champion Laila Ali â in preparation for squaring off against one another. Superstar comic Amy Schumer attempts to sharpen the wit of a group of the bachelors, but will they be able to make our wise-cracking Bachelorette laugh? The debonair Clint captures the first one-on-one date â an underwater photo shoot which ends in a hot romantic embrace. All the guys are \"playing nice,\" until one devious bachelor refuses to play by the rules."
