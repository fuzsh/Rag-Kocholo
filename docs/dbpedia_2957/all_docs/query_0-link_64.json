He was 62.\n\nSilver died Sunday after a two-year battle with esophageal cancer, said Robin Bronk, executive director of the Creative Coalition, which Silver co-founded as an advocacy group for entertainers.\n\nSilver, an Emmy nominee for a recurring role as a slick political strategist on “The West Wing,” had a long history of balancing acting with left-leaning social and political causes.\n\nBut after the 2001 terrorist attacks, longtime Democrat Silver turned heads in Hollywood with outspoken support of President George W. Bush over the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nHis big-screen credits included “Ali,” “Reversal of Fortune,” “Enemies: A Love Story,” “Silkwood” and “Semi-Tough.”\n\nBesides “The West Wing,” Silver was a regular or had recurring roles on such TV shows as “Veronica’s Closet,” “Chicago Hope” and “Wiseguy.” He directed and co-starred in the 1993 TV movie “Lifepod,” a science-fiction update of Alfred Hitchcock’s “Lifeboat.”\n\nMiddledorf evaded Nazis to flee France\n\nWilliam Middledorf, 87, a retired Air Force colonel who as a downed pilot in German-occupied France in World War II spent weeks masquerading as a deaf and mute Frenchman to evade capture, died Feb. 16 in Arlington County, Va. He had lung cancer.\n\nHis wartime account was featured in “Escape and Evasion: 17 True Stories of Downed Pilots Who Made It Back” (1973), written and edited by Jimmy W. Kilbourne.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1943, Middledorf was an Army Air Forces second lieutenant and B-17 pilot engaged in a bombing run when his plane came under attack by German fliers and collided in midair with another Allied “Flying Fortress.” He and his crew bailed out 25,000 feet over northern France.\n\nMiddledorf was separated from his crew during the parachute drop and landed in a cornfield. A French woman waved him into a farmhouse and gave him civilian clothes, which he initially was reluctant to wear. He said he feared he would be shot as a spy if captured.\n\nHe was given falsified identification papers and a medical slip attesting that he was deaf and mute. The pretense was needed to explain why an otherwise hale young “French” man was not in a labor or concentration camp, according to Kilbourne.\n\nDuring the next few weeks, French resistance leaders guided Middledorf and a downed Canadian pilot in the direction of the Pyrenees, the mountain region separating France and neutral Spain.\n\nThe Allied fliers made their way across the Spanish border on foot but were arrested by a Spanish sentry and interned in a French Red Cross home.\n\n“They had sentries at this place, but they didn’t seem too alert — security wasn’t too tight,” Middledorf said. He and the Canadian slipped into town and called the British consulate after the American consulate did not answer. The British officials came to their aid and took them to Gibraltar, the British territory at the southern tip of Spain. From there, they were flown to England.\n\nThis report includes information from the Associated Press and Washington Post.\n\nOriginally Published: March 16, 2009 at 11:01 p.m."
