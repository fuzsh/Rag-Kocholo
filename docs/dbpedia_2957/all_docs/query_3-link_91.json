        "text": "Disney’s Onyx Collective is moving forward with the Mahershala Ali-led drama The Plot after a competitive bidding war. The limited series is adapted from the best-selling book of the same name by Jean Hanff Korelitz.\n\nAli will star and executive produce the show about a struggling author who turns to literary theft to revive his career. We’ll follow just how far he’ll go to keep this secret.\n\nThe content brand Onyx Collective launched last May and is focused on creators of color and telling stories around underrepresented communities. “Hollywood is still not greenlighting enough projects with multidimensional Black characters, stories that simply focus on our humanity. The rarity of a straight-to-series order, especially for BIPOC projects, is not lost on us,” said Mimi Valdés, executive producer of Know Wonder.\n\n“We loved the idea of exploring Jean’s book from the perspective of a Black man, so that we could really debate the themes of authorship, inspiration and who has the right to tell what stories,” said Layne Eskridge, executive producer of POV Entertainment. “Mahershala was our dream for the role, and when he and the Know Wonder team signed on, it confirmed that we were building something next level.”\n\nThe eight-episode series will live on Hulu."
