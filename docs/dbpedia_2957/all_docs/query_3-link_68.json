        "text": "Prime Video has given the greenlight to The Greatest, a series on the life of the great Muhammad Ali. The company announced on Thursday that the show has been given a series order and will be produced by Amazon MGM Studios, Outlier Society, Roc Nation, Blue Monday Productions, Authentic Studios, Polygram Entertainment, and Grace: A Storytelling Company.\n\nBen Watkins will serve as showeunner and executive producer on the show, which is the first of the first authorized series on the life Ali. Jaalen Best (All American: Homecoming) will play Ali in the show, which will premiere on Prime Video.\n\nThe show is described as follows:\n\nThe Greatest intimately explores the incomparable life of Muhammad Ali. The amazing victories and defeats that made Ali a legend, both in and out of the ring, have been well documented and while those landmark events will live in The Greatest, the heartbeat of the story is fueled by all the moments that took place outside of the spotlight. The world remembers an icon, but The Greatest is about a man, a husband, a father, a brother, and a son.\n\n“Muhammed Ali defined commitment and passion for multiple generations of Americans. His journey is best told in full by a team whose dedication reflects that example,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television, Amazon MGM Studios. “Ali’s is an awe-inspiring story of one of the most significant global figures of the 20th century. We are proud to work with Ben alongside Outlier, Roc Nation, Polygram, Grace, Authentic Brands, Lonnie Ali, and the very talented Jaalen Best, who we know will do a remarkable job bringing The Greatest to life for our global Prime Video customers.”\n\nWatkins added in a statement, “To be trusted with the honor of telling the story of my most cherished hero, Muhammad Ali, is humbling and scary, and a dream come true. I am filled with an overwhelming sense of pride, responsibility, and most of all, gratitude.”"
