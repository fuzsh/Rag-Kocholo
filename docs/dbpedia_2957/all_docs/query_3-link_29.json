        "text": "American actor (born 1974)\n\nMahershala Ali ( mə-HUR-shə-lə;[1] born Mahershalalhashbaz Gilmore on February 16, 1974) is an American actor. He has received multiple accolades, including two Academy Awards, a British Academy Film Award, a Golden Globe Award, and a Primetime Emmy Award. Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2019,[2] and in 2020, The New York Times ranked him among the 25 greatest actors of the 21st century.[3]\n\nAfter pursuing an MFA degree from New York University, Ali began his career as a regular on television series Crossing Jordan (2001–02) and Threat Matrix (2003–04), before his breakthrough role as Richard Tyler in the science fiction series The 4400 (2004–07). His first major film role was in the David Fincher-directed fantasy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008). He gained wider attention for supporting roles in the final two films of the original The Hunger Games film series, and in House of Cards, for which he received his first Primetime Emmy Award nomination.\n\nAli won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performances as a drug dealer in the drama Moonlight (2016) and as Don Shirley in the comedy-drama film Green Book (2018). He is the first Black actor to win two Academy Awards in the same category, and the second Black actor to win multiple acting Oscars.[4] Ali won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program for executive producing We Are the Dream: The Kids of the Oakland MLK Oratorical Fest (2020).\n\nIn 2019, he played a troubled police officer in the third season of the HBO anthology crime series True Detective and in 2020, he starred in the second season of the Hulu comedy-drama series Ramy. He was nominated for Primetime Emmy Awards for both performances. Ali has also played Cornell \"Cottonmouth\" Stokes in the first season of the Netflix series Luke Cage (2016), and voiced Aaron Davis in the animated films Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018) and Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023).\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nAli was born in Oakland, California, on February 16, 1974, to Willicia Goines and Phillip Gilmore.[5][6][7] His birth name, Mahershalalhashbaz, is from Maher-shalal-hash-baz, the name of the prophet Isaiah's second child (chapter 8, Book of Isaiah).[5] Ali was raised as a Christian in Hayward, California, by his mother, an ordained Baptist minister whose own mother, Evia Goines, was herself an ordained minister at Palma Ceia Baptist Church in Hayward.[5][8][9] His father left the family when Ali was a toddler to pursue a career as a dancer;[10] he appeared on Broadway,[9] and died in 1994.[5]\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nAli attended St. Mary's College of California (SMC) in Moraga, California, where he graduated in 1996 with a degree in mass communication as a first-generation college student.[8][11] He entered SMC with a basketball scholarship and went by the name \"Hershal Gilmore\" when playing for the SMC Gaels.[12] He became disenchanted with the idea of a sports career because of the treatment given to the team's athletes and developed an interest in acting, particularly after taking part in a staging of Spunk, which later landed him an apprenticeship at the California Shakespeare Theater following graduation. After a sabbatical year working for Gavin Report, he enrolled in New York University's graduate acting program at Tisch School of the Arts, earning his master's degree in 2000.[8]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nActing\n\n[edit]\n\nAli was known professionally by his full name, Mahershalalhashbaz Ali, from 2001 until 2010, when he began to be credited as Mahershala Ali.[8][13] Ali had considered shortening his name for a while, saying that using his full first name was \"a crazy thing to do considering that we're in Hollywood\", although he had never been pressured by managers or agents to change it.[13] He decided to use a shorter version of his first name after being told that his full name was too long to fit on the poster for the film The Place Beyond the Pines. He did not want the alternative of M. Ali to represent himself on the poster, so he chose to adopt the shorter version of his name.[13]\n\nHe elaborated in an interview to Vanity Fair in October 2016:\n\n\"I think if you have any desire to be a leading man or to really carry some of these stories, there's this relationship that has to be cultivated with an audience. People have to be able to say your name. I didn't want a couple of syllables to get in the way of me having the fullest experience as an actor.\"[13]\n\nHe is known for his portrayal of Remy Danton in the Netflix series House of Cards, Cornell Stokes in Marvel's Luke Cage, Colonel Boggs in The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 1 and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay – Part 2 and Tizzy in the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, his first major film role. Other notable films include Predators, The Place Beyond the Pines, Free State of Jones, Hidden Figures.\n\nFor his performance as mentor and drug dealer Juan in the drama film Moonlight (2016), Ali received universal acclaim from critics and won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the SAG Award and the Critics' Choice Award for Best Supporting Actor and received a Golden Globe and a BAFTA Award nomination. At the 89th Academy Awards, he was the first Muslim actor to win an Oscar.[14]\n\nIn 2017, Ali joined the video game Madden NFL 18's story mode Longshot, in which he played Cutter Wade, the father of protagonist Devin.[15][16] He played Don Shirley in the 2018 film Green Book, receiving his second Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture[17] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role.[18]\n\nAli starred as Arkansas State Police detective Wayne Hays in the third season of the HBO series True Detective, which premiered on January 13, 2019, in the United States.[19] On Rotten Tomatoes, the site's critical consensus reads, \"Driven by Mahershala Ali's mesmerizing performance, True Detective's third season finds fresh perspective by exploring real world events – though it loses some of the series' intriguing strangeness along the way.\"[20]\n\nAt the annual San Diego Comic-Con in July 2019, Ali was announced as being cast to play the supernatural superhero Blade in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film of the same name, which was previously played by Wesley Snipes.[21]\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nAli was signed to Bay Area recording label Hieroglyphics Imperium during the late 2000s and recorded rap music as Prince Ali.[22] In 2006, he released his first album, Corner Ensemble, followed by Curb Side Service in 2007, but did not tour to promote the album, choosing instead to focus on his acting career.[23] In 2015 Ali appeared on rap artist Hus Kingpin album \"House Of Cards\" lending his voice to skits and rapping on the track entitled \"House Of Card Gods\" using his moniker.[24] In 2019, he made a guest appearance on Keith Murray's album Lord Of The Metaphor 2 alongside Casual and Planet Asia, and in 2020, appeared on Riz Ahmed's album The Long Goodbye.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAli converted to Ahmadiyya Islam in 2000, changing his surname from Gilmore to Ali. In interviews, he has described being the subject of racial profiling at airports and banks following the September 11 attacks.[25][26][27]\n\nHe is married to Amatus Sami-Karim, an actress and musician.[28] Their first child, a daughter, was born in February 2017.[29]\n\nAli is a devout fan of hip hop and has said within various interviews that Cambatta, Planet Asia, Skyzoo, Blu, Ka, Roc Marciano, Mach-Hommy, Pink Siifu, Fly Anakin & Mutant Academy, Mick Jenkins, Sage Elsesser, EARTHGANG, Benny The Butcher, Conway The Machine, Westside Gunn, Hus Kingpin & SmooVth are amongst his favorite artists.[30]\n\nIn October 2023, Ali signed the Artists4Ceasefire letter calling for a ceasefire in the 2023 Israel-Hamas War.[31][32] In January 2024, he showed further support for Palestinians in Gaza by reciting the poem \"Longing for Haifa\" by Palestinian poet Mohammed al-Qudwa in a video for social media, and encouraging his followers to donate to al-Qudwa's fundraiser so that the poet and his family could leave the Gaza Strip.[33]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nStudio albums\n\n[edit]\n\nCorner Ensemble (2006)\n\nCurb Side Service (2007)\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2003 Making Revolution Mac Laslow Credited as Mahershalalhashbaz Ali 2008 Umi's Heart Ezra Short film, as Mahershalalhashbaz Ali Tizzy Credited as Mahershalalhashbaz Ali 2009 Crossing Over Detective Strickland 2010 Predators Mombasa The Wronged Man Calvin Willis Television film All Signs of Death Gabe Unsold TV pilot 2012 Kofi 2013 Go for Sisters Dez 2014 Supremacy Deputy Rivers Boggs 2015 2016 Kicks Marlon Gubagude Ko Ochoro Short film Free State of Jones Moses The Realest Real The Minister Short film Moonlight Juan Hidden Figures Colonel Jim Johnson 2017 Roxanne Roxanne Cross 2018 Green Book Doctor Donald Shirley Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse Aaron Davis / Prowler Voice 2019 Alita: Battle Angel Vector 2021 Eternals Eric Brooks / Blade Uncredited voice, cameo appearance Swan Song Cameron / Jack Also producer 2023 Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse Aaron Davis / Prowler Voice, cameo appearance Leave the World Behind George G.H.
