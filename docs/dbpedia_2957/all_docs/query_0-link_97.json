        "text": "The world says goodbye this weekend to Muhammad Ali, who died June 3 and who will be laid to rest Friday (June 10) in his hometown of Louisville, Ky., following a Muslim jenazah service on Thursday. New Orleans fans, however, will also have a chance to bid farewell to the champ locally, thanks to a couple of area movie theaters.\n\nTo honor Ali's memory, the Prytania Theater has announced a limited engagement of the 1977 sports biopic \"The Greatest,\" which tells his life story and in which the part of Ali is played by -- who else? -- Ali himself, alongside Ernest Borgnine, Robert Duvall and James Earl Jones.\n\n\"The Greatest\" will screen daily at 5 p.m. at the Uptown theater from Friday to Wednesday (June 10 to 15). All screenings will be preceded by a short on-screen tribute produced by the theater and featuring memorable moments from Ali's public life both in and out of the boxing ring.\n\nIn addition, Sony Pictures this weekend will re-release the 2001 drama \"Ali\" to select theaters nationally, starring Will Smith as Ali and Jon Voight as sportscaster Howard Cosell, both in Oscar-nominated performances. Locally, it will play at 12:50 and 6:55 p.m. daily from Friday through Wednesday (June 10 to 15) at the AMC Elmwood Palace.\n\nDirected by Michael Mann, \"Ali\" features a supporting cast that includes Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, Ron Silver, Jeffrey Wright, LeVar Burton and Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\n\"With the passing of Muhammad Ali, we have received many requests for this film to return to theaters, in celebration of his life,\" said Rory Bruer, president of worldwide distribution for Sony Pictures, in a news release. \"The film truly honors everything that made Ali one of the central figures of our time, a man who commanded his sport but whose personal faith and principles made him mean so much more. Muhammad Ali truly was The Greatest, and this tribute is a great way to honor him.\""
