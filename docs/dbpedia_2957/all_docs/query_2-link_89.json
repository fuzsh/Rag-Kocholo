        "text": "Award-winning actor and activist Ron Silver, who was Emmy-nominated for his role on the hit U.S. television drama The West Wing , died on Sunday of cancer. He was 62.\n\n\"Ron Silver died peacefully in his sleep with his family around him early Sunday morning,\" said Robin Bronk, executive director of the Creative Coalition, which Silver helped found.\n\nBronk said Silver was with his family in New York and he had been fighting esophageal cancer for two years.\n\nBronk called Silver not only a very talented actor, but a champion of free speech and artists' rights.\n\nNew York-based Creative Coalition is an art-oriented political group founded in 1989 by Silver, Alec Baldwin and Susan Sarandon, among others.\n\nSilver, who won Broadway's 1988 Tony Award for his work in David Mamet's drama Speed the Plow , had been a long-time liberal activist, but after the Sept. 11 attacks became an outspoken supporter of Republican president George W. Bush.\n\nHe was a featured speaker at the 2004 Republican National Convention, sometimes called himself a \"9/11 Republican\" and switched his party affiliation from Democrat to independent.\n\nSilver said his shift in politics cost him jobs in liberal Hollywood, yet he remained sought out for his skills as a character actor.\n\nHis portrayal of White House strategist Bruno Gianelli on The West Wing was perhaps his best known part in recent years, but he earned another Emmy nomination for the murder thriller Billionaire Boys Club .\n\nHe had roles on the TV hospital drama Chicago Hope and the comedy Veronica's Closet , and he won acclaim for playing lawyer Alan Dershowitz in the film Reversal of Fortune .\n\nBorn and raised in New York, his father worked in the garment industry and his mother was a teacher. He earned a master's degree in Chinese history from St. John's University in New York and studied drama at the Actors Studio. Silver and ex-wife Lynne Miller had a son and a daughter."
