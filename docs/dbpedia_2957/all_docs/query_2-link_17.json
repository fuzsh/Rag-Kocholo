        "text": "For Bubby’s and Azuca owner Ron Silver, creating art is a way of visually communicating questions about existence and experiencing the universality of beauty. Silver’s attitude about art is heavily influenced by Japanese culture and its emphasis on being of service to the community. Inspired by a lifetime of mentors and teachers from Alfredo Futuro and Egon Schiele to the Renaissance painters and Plato, his energetic relationships with the greats have guided him to be the artist he is today.\n\nVisit Website to purchase paintings, books, and other items."
