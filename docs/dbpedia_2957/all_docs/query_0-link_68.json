Written and directed by Michael Mann and starring Will Smith, the film charts the life and career of the three-time Heavyweight champion, philanthropist and civil rights icon from 1964 to his 1974 victory over George Foreman in the famous “Rumble in the Jungle” bout. The film will play this weekend in a few hundred theaters nationwide.\n\n“With the passing of Muhammad Ali, we have received many requests for this film to return to theaters, in celebration of his life,” said Rory Bruer, president of Worldwide Distribution for Sony Pictures. “The film truly honors everything that made Ali one of the central figures of our time, a man who commanded his sport but whose personal faith and principles made him mean so much more. Muhammad Ali truly was The Greatest, and this tribute is a great way to honor him.”\n\nThe film garnered two Oscar nominations – Best Actor for Will Smith, and Best Supporting Actor for Jon Voight, who portrayed Howard Cosell. Ali also starred Jamie Foxx, Mario Van Peebles, Ron Silver, Jeffrey Wright, and Mykelti Williamson.\n\nAli is this year’s second high profile film re-release following the passing of an iconic figure. Following the death of Prince, the Oscar-winning 1984 film Purple Rain was given a successful limited revival.\n\nRelated stories\n\nESPN To Air Muhammad Ali Funeral Live\n\nMuhammad Ali TV Tributes & Special Reports Planned\n\nMichael Barbieri Joins 'Spider-Man: Homecoming'"
