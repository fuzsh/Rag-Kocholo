        "text": "Though he originally aspired to work for the State Department, actor Ron Silver eventually succumbed to his college ambition of becoming a performer. First making a name for himself off-Broadway, Silver eventually transitioned to the small screen, where he made regular appearances on several short-lived sitcoms and acclaimed made-for-television movies. He began to rise to prominence through his work in features, including \"Silent Rage\" (1982) and \"Silkwood\" (1983). But it was his stage work that helped make Silver a star, which culminated in a Tony-winning performance in David Mamet's \"Speed-the-Plow\" (1988). Silver built a successful film and television career off his win, including a well-regarded turn as attorney Alan Dershowitz in \"Reversal of Fortune\" (1990). Though he continued to rack up an impressive array of credits, Silver was never a top box office draw, despite his immeasurable talents in both comedy and as over-the-top villains in movies like \"Blue Steel\" (1991) and \"Timecop\" (1994). Silver saved his best work for television, making valuable contributions to \"The West Wing\" (NBC, 1999-2006) and proving that he was capable of turning in top-notch performances in any medium he chose."
