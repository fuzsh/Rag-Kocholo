        "text": "Of all the great things about television, the greatest is that it’s on every single day. TV history is being made, day in and day out, in ways big and small. In an effort to better appreciate this history, we’re taking a look back, every day, at one particular TV milestone.\n\nIMPORTANT DATE IN TV HISTORY: July 2, 1946\n\nWHY IT’S IMPORTANT: Before The West Wing came along — and honestly, after The West Wing came along as well — Ron Silver had a solid career going as a character actor. He starred in Oscar-nominated movies like Enemies: A Love Story and Reversal of Fortune and Ali. He played any number of attorneys, including TWO members of O.J. Simpson’s Dream Team. Ron Silver was doing all right.\n\nBut for a certain demographic, Ron Silver, who passed away in 2009 at age 62, will never not be brilliant/Machiavellian campaign strategist Bruno Gianelli on The West Wing. Bruno arrived in Season Three, as the Bartlet administration was looking up from a deep hole in the polls after the President’s revelation that he had MS and lied about it. While initially struggling to get Team Bartlet onto his wavelength, Bruno likely won a place in viewers’ hearts (the liberal ones anyway) (which: why would you watch The West Wing if you weren’t?) with one particular pep talk to the left wing:\n\nThen, in Season Seven, when the focus shifted to the next campaign, the show brought Bruno back. Only this time, the ferocious liberal offered his services to Republican candidate Arnold Vinick. This was some pretty skillful shorthand to show that Vinick was the centrist Republican fairy tale that the show kept telling us he was. It also may have been a meta nod towards the shift in Silver’s personal politics, as he went from being a Democrat to a vociferous supporter of the Bush administration after 9/11.\n\nWhatever it was, it was just nice to have Bruno, and Ron Silver, back in the West Wing universe again. Even if he didn’t get anything quite like this most bizarre sailing analogy to do that second time around.\n\n[You can watch The West Wing on Netflix.]\n\nJoe Reid (@joereid) is a freelance writer living in Brooklyn. You can find him leaving flowers for Mrs. Landingham at the corner of 18th and Potomac."
