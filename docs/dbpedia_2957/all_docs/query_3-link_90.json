        "text": "Biopic of Muhammad Ali to return to movie theaters\n\nThe 2001 Muhammad Ali biopic “Ali” will return to theaters this weekend to celebrate the late boxing legend.\n\nSony Pictures said Wednesday that Michael Mann’s film, starring Will Smith, will play in a few hundred theaters nationwide. “Ali” earned Oscar nominations for Smith and supporting actor Jon Voight as Howard Cosell.\n\nFollowing Ali’s death Friday at 74, numerous theaters have also scheduled screenings of “When We Were Kings.” The 2006 Oscar-nominated documentary chronicles the 1974 “Rumble in the Jungle” between Ali and George Foreman.\n\nStewart not ‘OITNB’ fan\n\nIt’s safe to say that Martha Stewart is not a fan of “Orange Is the New Black.”\n\n“I do not watch,” the ex-con said in a new interview with Chelsea Handler.\n\nStewart was infamously convicted of insider trading in 2004 and served five months at Connecticut’s Danbury Federal Correctional Institution — the same prison the Netflix show’s Litchfield facility is based on.\n\nThe domestic goddess won’t tune in because it’s “too close to home,” as Handler quipped.\n\n“It’s not as good as the real thing,” Stewart said on Handler’s Netflix talk show. “When you live through something like ‘Orange Is the New Black,’ the real characters are better.”\n\nSheeran sued for stealing\n\nTwo California songwriters sued pop star Ed Sheeran on Wednesday, contending he ripped off their song and used it as the basis for his international hit “Photograph.”\n\nThe lawsuit from Martin Harrington and Tom Leonard was filed in federal court in Los Angeles. The songwriters are represented by Nashville attorney Richard Busch. Busch was victorious in the copyright lawsuit that pitted Marvin Gaye’s heirs against pop stars Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams over their song Blurred Lines.\n\nWhat do you binge?\n\nNetflix unveiled the Netflix Binge Scale on Wednesday, which aims to pinpoint the average speed with which members watch the streaming service’s top shows. Data based on global viewing of more than 100 serialized TV series was included only for accounts that fully completed the season. The results revealed that the global median days to complete the first season of these series was five days, and the median hours per session for completers overall was 2 hours and 10 minutes.\n\nSeries viewed less than two hours per day were identified as “savored.” Series viewed more than two hours per day were identified as “devoured.”\n\nThe patterns reveal that series with complex narratives tend to be most savored: “House of Cards,” “Bloodline,” “Peaky Blinders” and “Mad Men” fall on that end of the spectrum (although the most savored show: the irreverent animated series “BoJack Horseman”). On the devoured side: genre fare like “The Walking Dead,” “American Horror Story” and “The Fall” as well as comedies with a dramatic bent like “Orange Is the New Black,” “Nurse Jackie” and “Grace and Frankie.”\n\nBriefly\n\n■ Theresa Saldana, the “Raging Bull” actress who survived a stalker’s brutal attack to become a crime victim’s advocate and reclaimed her entertainment career with “The Commish,” “The Bernie Mac Show” and other TV shows, has died. She was 61.\n\nFree Press news services"
