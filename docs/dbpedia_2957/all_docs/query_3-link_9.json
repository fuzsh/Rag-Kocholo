        "text": "Amazon Prime Video has greenlit “The Greatest,” the first-ever authorized scripted series about the life of Muhammad Ali. Jaalen Best will star as Ali while Ben Watkins, creator of Amazon’s upcoming Alex Cross series, is set as showrunner.\n\n“The Greatest” was produced in collaboration with Ali’s estate, with his widow Lonnie Ali serving as executive producer. The series’ official description reads, “The amazing victories and defeats that made Ali a legend, both in and out of the ring, have been well documented and while those landmark events will live in ‘The Greatest,’ the heartbeat of the story is fueled by all the moments that took place outside of the spotlight. The world remembers an icon, but ‘The Greatest’ is about a man, a husband, a father, a brother and a son.\n\nAli’s life rights were originally acquired by executive producer Josh Wakely, who brought the project to Amazon. Amazon MGM Studios produces the series in association with Michael B. Jordan’s Outlier Society; Watkins’ Blue Monday Productions; Jay-Z’s Roc Nation; Universal Music Group’s Polygram Entertainment; Wakely’s Grace: A Storytelling Company; and Authentic Studios, which owns the rights to Ali’s image.\n\nAlongside Lonnie Ali and Wakely, executive producers include Watkins; Jordan and Outlier Society president Elizabeth Raposo; Authentic Brand Group’s Corey Salter, Marc Rosen and Matthew Gross; and Polygram’s Michele Anthony and Boyd Muir. David Blackman co-executive produces for Polygram. Stefano Agosto, executive vice president of television at Outlier Society will also oversee the project for Outlier.\n\nBest is known for recurring as Ryan Craig in Season 2 of the CW’s “All American: Homecoming,” which aired in 2023. He has also appeared in episodes of “Magnum P.I.” and “American Horror Stories.” He is repped by Luber Roklin Entertainment and GGSSC.\n\nAlong with “Cross,” which has already been picked up for a second season ahead of its series premiere, Watkins’ credits include creating Amazon’s “Hand of God” and writing and producing USA’s “Burn Notice,” Apple TV+’s “Truth Be Told” and Hulu’s “Wu-Tang: An American Saga.” He began his career as an actor, notably appearing on the CBS soap opera “The Young and the Restless” as Dr. Wesley Carter from 2002 to 2004. Watkins is repped by UTA and Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof and Fishman.\n\n“Muhammed Ali defined commitment and passion for multiple generations of Americans. His journey is best told in full by a team whose dedication reflects that example,” said Vernon Sanders, head of television at Amazon MGM Studios. “Ali’s is an awe-inspiring story of one of the most significant global figures of the 20th century. We are proud to work with Ben alongside Outlier, Roc Nation, Polygram, Grace, Authentic Brands, Lonnie Ali and the very talented Jaalen Best, who we know will do a remarkable job bringing ‘The Greatest’ to life for our global Prime Video customers.”\n\n“To be trusted with the honor of telling the story of my most cherished hero, Muhammad Ali, is humbling and scary, and a dream come true,” said Watkins. “I am filled with an overwhelming sense of pride, responsibility and most of all, gratitude.”\n\n“I’m thrilled to be producing ‘The Greatest’ alongside Ben Watkins who captured the essence and nuance of Muhammad. With Jaalen Best, we have uncovered a soulful gem. He is such a talented young man who not only embodies Muhammad, but exudes his resilience, courage, charisma and confidence,” said Lonnie Ali.\n\n“On behalf of the Outlier Society team, I want to thank the incomparable Lonnie Ali for entrusting us to tell the story of one of the greatest humanitarians in the history of the world. It is with humility and gratitude that we will begin the journey of making this wonderful show,” said Raposo.\n\n“We are excited to participate in a project celebrating the iconic athlete, trailblazer and activist, Muhammad Ali. His impact extended far beyond the boxing ring, using his platform to inspire and transform culture,” said Desiree Perez, CEO of Roc Nation. “It’s an honor to collaborate with all our partners, especially Lonnie Ali. ‘The Greatest’ is a perfect title for a show dedicated to his legacy.”\n\n“It’s been an honor to work with Lonnie to tell the incredible story of how Cassius Clay became the iconic Muhammad Ali. We look forward to sharing this personal portrait with his fans around the world,” said Michele Anthony, executive vice president of Universal Music Group.\n\n“It’s been a longtime dream to tell Ali’s remarkable life story as a television series, which is the only way to truly capture his greatness, and I’m grateful to Lonnie and the assembled team who also share my passion for getting ‘The Greatest’ to the screen,” said Wakely."
