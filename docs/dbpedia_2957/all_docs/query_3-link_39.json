        "text": "That thirsty Michael B. Jordan Super Bowl commercial is just the start of his partnership with Amazon. The actor is also working with Amazon Studios to develop a series about Muhammad Ali, which will delve into his legendary boxing career and civil rights activism. The limited series comes from a partnership between Jordan's Outlier Society production company and the mega studio, forged to support diverse filmmakers among the platform's original content.\n\nIt's tentatively called The Greatest.\n\nA longtime boxing fan and star of the Creed franchise, Jordan had a natural affinity for Ali. \"It's an incredible honor and I bring tons of respect to it,\" he told Deadline.\n\nJordan revealed the tentative title for the series and shared that they teamed with Roc Nation, Jay-Z's record label, for the \"music side of things.\" Josh Wakely will pen the script, and Ali's estate is also involved in the project.\n\n\"It's a limited series that will really dive into the life of Muhammad Ali,\" Jordan added. \"I'm not going to be too specific beyond that, but we'll be able to get to know him in ways we haven't had a chance to before.\"\n\nMBJ will not star in it, sadly.\n\nBut he promises that the character of Ali will be \"driven and compelling.\" And given the project's early stages, we don't know who might be in the running for the role yet.\n\n\"People know Muhammad Ali from his boxing days, but this is an opportunity to go beyond the ring, and more into the man. It's going to give more of a 360 degree view of who he was,\" he continued.\n\nActors who've portrayed the boxing GOAT include Will Smith, who starred in 2001's Ali, and Eli Goree, who plays Cassius Clay in Regina King's One Night in Miami.\n\nJordan will star in an upcoming Amazon movie though.\n\nIt's called Tom Clancyâ€™s Without Remorse, and it's due on Amazon Prime on April 30. He'll star as former Navy SEAL John Clarke, a character created by Clancy while he was writing the Jack Ryan books. Jordan has his eye on turning the film into a franchise."
