One of Hollywood’s finest actors and influential people has died after a two year battle with esophageal cancer. Ron Silver, Tony Award winning stage actor, big screen movie star, political insider and humanitarian activist, age 62, died peacefully Sunday morning in his sleep surrounded by his family around him.

Silver was a three-time Emmy nominee, won critical acclaim for his role as ring-side fight trainer Angelo Dundee in the Will Smith bow to professional boxer Mohammed Ali, had a varied career as both a leading man and sought-after character actor in such films and TV shows as “Silkwood,” “Law and Order,” “Timecop,” “The Arrival” and his Tony Award winning performance on stage with David Mamet’s “Speed-the-Plow.” Silver was also a well respected director and producer.

However, what most who knew him best will remember most about Ron was his dedication to trying to make this world a better place to live in for all humanity. He worked tirelessly for human rights, particularly after the devastation of 9/11, a proud “One Jerusalem” founder, an organization dedicated to the unity of Jerusalem; and Silver was a strong and vocal supporter for the overthrow of the regime of Sadaam Hussain in Iraq, a stance that cost him dearly with the more liberal-mined powers-that-be in Hollywood circles. Yet, despite the pressures from his peers to be less aggressive in his stance against worldwide terror organizations, over time, even those who disagreed with Silver’s political and worldview came to repect him for his staunch dedication and unswerving due diligence in the face of personal adversity.

Ron Silver, one of Hollywood’s and the world’s great ones is dead at age 62.
