They inspire us through their achievements and challenge us to make our own contribution to creating a better Australia.\n\nThe Awards honour an exceptional group of highly-respected Australians who ignite discussion and change on issues of national importance.\n\nThe Australian of the Year Awards provide everyone with the opportunity to recognise any Australian who makes them proud."
