        "text": "Former DHS compliance officer Colleen Taylor, who fought to bring concerns about the illegal robodebt scheme to the attention of her secretary and SES bosses, is one of several outstanding public servants have been named among the 737 Australians recognised on the King’s Birthday honours list this year.\n\nTaylor told the robodebt royal commission last year that the “callous indifference” she perceived while working for Human Services ultimately influenced her decision to retire from the public service. Today, she has been awarded an OAM for her service to public administration.\n\nFormer Victorian premier Daniel Andrews AC and Western Australia premier Mark McGowan AC have also been appointed a Companion in the General Division of the Order.\n\nAndrews’ citation acknowledged his service as the leader of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party for 23 years, nine of those years as premier.\n\n“For eminent service to the people and Parliament of Victoria, to public health, to policy and regulatory reform, and to infrastructure development,” Andrews’ Companion of the Order Citation read.\n\nVictoria’s 48th premier retired from politics last September following some of the most consequential years the state endured amid the public health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Victoria was one of the most locked-down states in the world.\n\nMcGowan, another popular Labor figure, is a former state treasurer, deputy mayor and councillor for the City of Rockingham (1994-2996), and Royal Australian Navy officer (1989-1996).\n\nThe former WA premier, who retired from politics last May, was recognised for eminent service to the people and Parliament of Western Australia, to public health and education, and to international trade relations.\n\nEpidemiologist and NHMRC leadership fellow Professor Karen Canfell AC, the late Simon Crean AC, former EU cultural advisory commission member Sir Jonathan Mills AC, and Australia’s next Governor-General Samantha Mostyn AC were also appointed Companions.\n\nA total of 15 Australians were appointed Officers (AO), and 131 Members (AM) in the General Division of the Order.\n\nAnother 341 Australians were awarded medals (OAMs), 162 meritorious awards, and 57 Distinguished and Conspicuous Awards.\n\nThe youngest recipient of the King’s Birthday honours this year is 29, and the oldest living recipient 98 years old.\n\nIn a statement, Governor-General David Hurley said presiding over investiture ceremonies and having the opportunity to meet so many diverse honours recipients was a “tremendous privilege”. This will be Hurley’s final honours list before he steps down from the role.\n\n“Learning their stories has been inspiring and makes me enormously optimistic for our future,” the G-G said.\n\n“I have been steadfast that the Order must reflect the diversity of our community – I am pleased by the progress we have made over the last five years. For it to continue, and it must, we need people to take the time to nominate people that inspire them.”\n\nHurley thanked the recipients of the King’s Birthday Honours for their service and the difference they made to the community.\n\n“I would like to congratulate all those recognised in today’s Honours List. Some names are well-known, but the vast majority are not – they are people who work tirelessly and selflessly to make a difference in our community,” he said.\n\nAnyone can nominate any Australian for an award in the Order of Australia.
