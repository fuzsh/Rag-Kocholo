        "text": "Children’s author Pamela Allen has written more than 50 works that have found homes in bookshelves across the world, and now she has been recognised in this year’s Australia Day honours.\n\nSign up for a weekly email featuring our best reads\n\nAllen has been awarded a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for her significant contribution to literature.\n\n“I am in my 89th year and it is very rewarding to have the community appreciating me,” said the author of the Mr McGee series and Who Sank the Boat?\n\nAllen, who has sold more than 6.5m copies worldwide over a career spanning 40 years, said she hopes Australians will continue to buy her books for years to come.\n\nOf the 1,042 honours and awards announced in this year’s list, 739 are in the general division of the Order of Australia, including four appointed Companion of the Order of Australia (AC).\n\nTo be awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia award (AO), recipients must have served Australia or humanity to a large or high degree.\n\nThe distinguished plastics surgeon Prof Fiona Wood and former national mental health commissioner Prof Ian Hickie are among the household names being awarded the honour.\n\nPaul Briggs has also been awarded an AO for his service to the Indigenous community and social welfare. Briggs is the founding chairman of Victoria’s Aboriginal community-controlled health organisation and has worked on the state’s treaty.\n\nAustralian women make up the majority of recipients in the general division for 2024, with 373 (or just over 50%) receiving the honour. This is only the second time a majority of honours were awarded to women since the national system was introduced in 1975.\n\nSporting champion Ellie Cole is among those awarded a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). Cole became Australia’s most decorated female Paralympic athlete in 2021, winning 17 Paralympic medals.\n\nAfter 16 years in the pool, it is Cole’s accessibility and diversity work that has been in the spotlight. “If we can just make small changes throughout our community, and they can have access to anything that they like, the same opportunities as all of their peers, then do they actually have a disability? I’m always asking myself that question,” she told the Guardian in 2021.\n\nThe former Australian politician Sharman Stone’s long list of positions in parliament – including as a member for Murray and as the Australian ambassador for women and girls – has earned her recognition this year as an AM.\n\n“It is an honour and a privilege to have this much recognition from our great country, and really I see this as an achievement of [all the] people I have worked with over 40 years, to address regional issues and gender issues,” she said.\n\nIn 2015, Stone was a strong critic of the Coalition’s paid parental leave policy, saying it needed to be returned “to the drawing board” so low-income women were offered more generous payments.\n\nSandra Sully, the editor of 10 News First in Sydney and Queensland and a highly respected voice of Australian television, is another new Member of the Order of Australia.\n\nThe AM list also includes contemporary artist Cressida Campbell.\n\n“It is such an honour to receive this award, even if it is for doing something I love to do, however I think it would be good to have awards for people who hate what they do but are essential to us in many ways,” she said.\n\nMusical director Max Lambert – the mastermind behind the Sydney 2000 Olympics’ opening and closing ceremonies – and John Foreman, the name attached to some of the biggest events in Australian entertainment (Carols by Candlelight, School Spectacular and Australian Idol) also made the member list.\n\nBreakfast television alumni David “Kochie” Koch, who said goodbye to Seven’s Sunrise after 21 years, has been recognised for his significant service to Australian media just a year after his retirement. As Guardian’s Amanda Meade put it, he “was unpolished and corny but viewers responded to the homespun style of Kochie and Mel, making Sunrise one of commercial television’s most successful disrupters”.\n\nWithin the general division, the founding member of the Arab Council and former executive producer at SBS Arabic Radio, Majida Abboud-Saab, was awarded a Medal of the Order (OAM). She said she happy to have received “government recognition” for her efforts to the Australian media for more than 40 years.\n\n“I am most proud of pushing the boundaries with Australia to recognise the needs of multicultural communities, and not just the Arabic, and by making multicultural, multilingual and diverse programming be a part of the mainstream.”\n\nAbboud-Saab’s hope this recognition reminds people of the benefits of working “in harmony with one another, like we do here in Australia”.\n\nThe four receiving the Companion of the Order of Australia are Catherine Brighid Livingstone AO for eminent service to business, tertiary education, the arts, science and technology; Prof Lorraine Ann Mazerolle for her outstanding work as a criminologist and to the development of policing reforms; Prof Deborah Jane Terry AO for her innovations in higher education and services to the community; and Prof David Vernon Boger for eminent service to chemical engineering as a scientist, academic and researcher.\n\nOf all the honours, the youngest recipient is 32 years old and the eldest living recipient is 100 years old. About 42% of honours (310 in total) were for outstanding service or achievement in the community."
