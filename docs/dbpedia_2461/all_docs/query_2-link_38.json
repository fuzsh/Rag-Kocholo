Danced to music by Sibelius and with designs by William Constable, The Black Swan was based on an historical incident in 1697 when a Captain Vlaming from the Dutch East India Company discovered and named Rottnest Island and the river on which the city of Perth now stands. He was particularly struck by the number of black swans on the river and his crew captured several and took them back to Java. A libretto, written round this incident by M. Millet, told the story of the Captain entranced by a black swan, symbol of a new land--Acquisitions documentation\n\nTitle devised by cataloguer based on acquisitions documentation, see file NLA08/2808\n\nPart of the collection: Kenneth Gillespie photograph collection, ca. 1933-1960\n\nCondition: Yellowing, pin-hole top edge, soil mark centre left\n\nAlso available in an electronic version on the Internet at: http://nla.gov.au/nla.pic-vn4535270\n\nCopyright restrictions may apply\n\nRelated Resources"
