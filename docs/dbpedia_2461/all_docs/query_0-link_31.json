        "text": "For other people named David Morrison, see David Morrison (disambiguation).\n\nLieutenant General David Lindsay Morrison AO (born 1956) is a senior officer within the Australian Army, currently serving in the appointment of Chief of Army.\n\nEarly life and career[]\n\nDavid Morrison joined the Australian Army in 1979, after completing a Bachelor of Arts at the Australian National University. He graduated from the Officer Cadet School, Portsea into the Royal Australian Infantry Corps.[1]\n\nIn 1987 and 1988, Morrison served as the Australian Instructor at the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst, in the United Kingdom.[1]\n\nIn 1992, Morrison attended the Army Command and Staff College, Queenscliff, and was then appointed as the Brigade Major of the 3rd Brigade, based in Townsville, Queensland.[1] During that time he took part in Operation Lagoon, acting as Chief of Staff for a multinational force that provided security to the peace conference held in Bougainville during 1994. The following year he was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel.\n\nIn 1997 he was appointed Commanding Officer of the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR), holding that position until the end of 1998, when he was posted as the Chief Instructor for the Command, Staff Operations Wing at the Army All Corps Promotion Training Centre in Canungra.[1]\n\nHe was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia in 1999 for his services as Brigade Major, Director of Preparedness and Mobilisation and CO of 2 RAR.[2]\n\nUpon promotion to Colonel in October 1999, Morrison was appointed as Colonel Operations, Headquarters International Force for East Timor (INTERFET).[1] On his return to Australia, he was posted to the Deployable Joint Force Headquarters (DJFHQ) as Chief of Staff.[1] He left that position at the end of 2001 to attend the Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies, Canberra, where he graduated in 2002 with a Master of Arts in Strategic Studies.[1]\n\nMorrison was promoted to Brigadier in November 2002, and commanded the 3rd Brigade from December 2002 until December 2004.[1] He was then appointed as Director-General Preparedness and Plans - Army (DGPP-A) and held that position until his promotion to Major General in December 2005.[1]\n\nHe was appointed Commander of the Australian Defence College in January 2006, and Head Military Strategic Commitments in April 2007.[1]\n\nMorrison took up the appointment of Deputy Chief of Army in February 2008, replacing Major General John Patrick Cantwell. He served in this position until December, when he was appointed Land Commander Australia (LCAUST).[1] Following a re-structure in July 2009, the post of Land Commander Australia was re-designated as Commander Forces Command.[1] Morrison was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day Honours List of 2010 for distinguished service to the Australian Army in the fields of training and education, military strategic commitments and force structure and capability; in particular, as Commander Australian Defence College, Head Military Strategic Commitments and Deputy Chief of Army.[3]\n\nMorrison was promoted to Lieutenant General on 23 June 2011, and assumed the post of Chief of Army in a ceremony the following day.[4]\n\nIn 2012, Morrison spoke out against defence budget cuts.[5][6]\n\nWomen in the military[]\n\nIn June 2013, Morrison ordered an investigation into several emails sent from Army accounts over a three-year period that were highly demeaning to women. At a 13 June press conference, Morrison announced that he had suspended three members of the Army, ordered action to consider the suspension of five others, and suggested as many as nine more could face disciplinary action. He described the emails as \"explicit, derogatory, demeaning and repugnant,\" and suggested that the alleged conduct was even worse than the \"Skype scandal\" of 2011.[7][8] In a video posted on the Army's official YouTube channel, a visibly angry Morrison described the alleged behaviour as a \"direct contravention\" of Army values. He added that he had been committed ever since becoming Chief of Army to making the Army an inclusive force. \"If that does not suit you,\" he said, \"then get out!\" He also told anyone not willing to work with women and accept them as equals, \"There is no place for you amongst this band of brothers and sisters.\"[9]\n\nHis speech and stance on the issue have been widely hailed by Australian[10][11] and American[12] media, in particular comparing Morrison's aggressive response to abuse to the relatively guarded response of the U.S. military to similar accusations.[13]\n\nHonours and Awards[]\n\nOfficer of the Order of Australia (AO)[3] 26 January 2010 Member of the Order of Australia (AM)[2] 1999 Australian Active Service Medal[14] International Force East Timor Medal[14] Defence Force Service Medal with 3 Clasps[14] (30â€“34 years of service) Australian Defence Medal[14] Commander of the Legion of Merit (United States)[15] 2012\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
