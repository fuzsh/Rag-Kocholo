        "text": "Conductor Emeritus\n\nAntony Walker\n\nAntony Walker is currently Music Director of Pittsburgh Opera, Artistic Director of Washington Concert Opera and Conductor Emeritus of Pinchgut Opera.\n\nAntony has conducted over 100 operas, as well as many large-scale choral/orchestral, symphonic and chamber works with companies across Europe, the United States and Australia, in addition to performances and recordings of early works with the Orchestra of the Antipodes, the period instrument orchestra he formed in 2001. He has led operatic performances for The Metropolitan Opera, English National Opera, Washington National Opera, Opera Australia, West Australian Opera, Teatro Comunale di Bologna, Santa Fe Opera, Canadian Opera Company, Minnesota Opera, Glimmerglass Opera, Arizona Opera, New York City Opera, Opera Theatre of Saint Louis, Vancouver Opera and Cincinnati Opera. He has also appeared with leading orchestras including the Sydney and Melbourne symphony orchestras, BBC National Orchestra of Wales and Orchestra Colonne in Paris.\n\nWith well over 30 recordings on CD and DVD, his Pinchgut Opera live recordings consistently win praise both in Australia and abroad. His CD collaboration with Teddy Tahu Rhodes (The Voice) garnered the 2004 ARIA Award for Best Classical Music Album of the Year, and his DVD of the ‘Emperor’ Concerto (also on CD as part of a complete set of the Beethoven Piano Concertos) won the international DVD Association Award for Music Excellence.\n\nAntony Walker is the recipient of the distinguished Sir Charles Mackerras Conducting Award, a Churchill Fellowship, the Queen’s Trust Award, and a Green Room Award for his conducting of Alcina for Opera Australia.\n\nFounder and Life Patron\n\nLiz Nielsen\n\nElizabeth Nielsen, along with her husband Ken Nielsen, Erin Helyard, Alison Johnston and Anna Cerneaz, was a founder of Pinchgut Opera. Liz had taught commercial law and established a mediation practice (good training for running an opera company!) before she realised she had retired from the law as Pinchgut Opera was far more fun and was taking all her time. For Pinchgut, Liz has done just about every administrative job from negotiating contracts and grant applications to making lunches and billeting musicians. Liz was Chair of the Board from 2002 until December 2016.\n\nLegacy Patron\n\nThe late Jeremy Davis AM\n\nJeremy served as Pinchgut Board Director for four years and was an incredibly valued advisor.\n\nHe was a company director and strategy consultant. He had spent ten years with The Boston Consulting Group in the USA and Europe. He then was appointed Dean of the Australian Graduate School of Management at UNSW, where he was an Emeritus Professor.\n\nHe also served as a Director of a wide range of companies and institutions including Transurban, Singapore Power and the Australian Stock Exchange."
