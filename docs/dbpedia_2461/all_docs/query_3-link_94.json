        "text": "MS Australia’s annual John Studdy Award recognises outstanding, consistent, and selfless meritorious service of 10 or more years, by someone making or who has made a tangible difference to the benefit of people living with multiple sclerosis (MS) and/or their families or carers.\n\nFirst awarded in 1999, the award is named for the late John Studdy (former Chairman of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society of Australia, the forerunner of MS Australia), a tireless advocate for the MS community in Australia, who was dedicated to advancing the wellbeing of people living with MS and the search for a cure.\n\nThis award is for individuals who, like John Studdy, have made a significant contribution to the MS movement in Australia.\n\nThe 2023 award recipient is Ms Rachel Kerr for her commitment, dedication and service to people living with MS in the Queensland community.\n\nRachel was diagnosed with MS in 2006 at just 17 years of age, at a time when there was little support for people living with MS in regional Queensland.\n\nSince her diagnosis, Rachel has contributed tirelessly to the Queensland community, advocating for the rights and wellbeing of regional people living with MS. She has led numerous fundraising initiatives, ensuring vital services reach the MS community in remote areas of Central Queensland. Beyond fundraising, Rachel has been a relentless advocate for raising awareness of MS in young people, igniting conversations and dismantling stigmas surrounding the condition.\n\nRachel has been an active ambassador for MS Queensland, fundraiser and advocate for people living with MS for over 13 years, featuring in countless local radio and TV interviews, speaking at numerous fundraising events and acting as a keynote speaker at education and awareness information sessions where she shares her story to support various MS awareness campaigns. Ms Kerr has a passion for volunteering, particularly throughout the Queensland community.\n\nMS Australia President, Associate Professor Des Graham, says Ms Kerr has improved the lives of countless people living with MS.\n\n“Rachel’s passion and tireless dedication serves as an inspiration to us all and it’s my very great honour, on behalf of the Board of MS Australia, to name Rachel as the recipient of the 2023 John Studdy Award. Rachel is hard working, humble and dedicated in her work which has resulted in making a remarkable difference for many people living with MS and giving a voice to regional communities across Queensland,” Associate Professor Graham said.\n\nMr Shaun Treacy, Chair of MS Queensland and MS Australia Board Member, congratulated Ms Kerr, noting that there are many worthy Australians working to find a cure for MS.\n\n“Rachel is a fine example of a hardworking, humble and dedicated person whose work has resulted in making a remarkable difference for many people living with MS and she has given a voice to regional communities across Queensland,” Mr Treacy said.\n\nAward recipient Ms Kerr said, “Living with MS has taught me resilience and has given me strength to help others in communities across Queensland. Volunteering has enabled me to turn my MS into an asset, and I am very humbled to accept this award and to be recognised by one’s peers.”\n\nThe John Studdy Award was presented to Ms Kerr in a private event at MS Queensland’s Brisbane office on 23 April 2024.\n\nRelated link: Award for providing a voice to people living with MS in the Queensland community"
