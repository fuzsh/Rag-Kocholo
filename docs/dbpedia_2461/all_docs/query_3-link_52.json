        "text": "The Australian Honours and Awards system recognises the outstanding service and contributions of South Australians and provides an opportunity to celebrate those who work tirelessly to improve local communities.\n\nExamples of voluntary or professional excellence in a field of endeavour, significant achievement, meritorious service or bravery demonstrated locally, nationally or overseas, is considered and recognised through the system.\n\nAustralia’s distinctive honours system started in 1975 with the creation of the Order of Australia, to recognise service to the nation or humanity, as well as the Australian Bravery Decorations and the National Medal.\n\nThe Governor conducts Investiture Ceremonies involving the presentation of honours and awards to South Australian citizens included on the Australia Day and King's Birthday Honours lists. Recipients are principally invested with awards under the Order of Australia, but there are also a number of Meritorious Service Awards and Bravery Decorations.\n\nAny Australian can nominate someone for an award. Nominations are assessed by the Honours and Award Secretariat, considered by the Council of the Order of Australia before recommendations are made to the Governor-General.\n\nVisit the Australian Honours System website to access more information or nomination forms for awards."
