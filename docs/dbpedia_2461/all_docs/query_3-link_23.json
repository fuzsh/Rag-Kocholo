        "text": "University of Queensland Vice-Chancellor Professor Deborah Terry and leading criminologist and educator, Professor Lorraine Mazerolle have received the nationâs highest civil award in the 2024 Australia Day Honours.\n\nProfessor Bruce Abernethy, Professor Gail Garvey, Professor Paul Harpur, Professor Cliff Mallett, Professor Carmel Hawley, Honorary Professor Vicki Flenady and Associate Professor David Thomson join researchers, alumni and UQ community members who have also been acknowledged for their significant contributions to society in this yearâs honours list.\n\nKey points:\n\nTwo of only four national recipients appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) are from the UQ community.\n\nMore than 40 members of the UQ community received Australia Day honours from ACs to OAMs.\n\nProfessor Terry said she was deeply humbled to be awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for eminent service to tertiary education and the community.\n\nâI have always felt itâs an honour to work in a sector that is so critical to Australiaâs future economic and social prosperity, and to solving our shared global challenges,â Professor Terry said.\n\nâThroughout my career, I have had the good fortune to work with very talented colleagues who are deeply committed to making a genuine difference through their teaching and research. So itâs a great privilege to work alongside them and to see, first-hand, the impact that our universities have through our students, our alumni and our deep partnerships with government and industry.\n\nâI am delighted to see so many of my colleagues and other members of our community recognised, and the impact of our collective work being celebrated.â\n\nCriminologist Professor Lorraine Mazerolle has also been awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for eminent service to education, to the social sciences, and to the development of policing reforms.\n\nâI am passionate about making our communities safer and for almost 40 years have strived to work with criminal justice agencies to implement evidence-informed policies and practices that reduce crime without causing harm,â Professor Mazerolle said.\n\nâI am inspired by the passion of my criminology students at UQ. My achievements have only been possible through collaborations with a variety of students, colleagues and law enforcement agencies across Australia.â\n\nProfessor Bruce Abernethy has been made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for his significant service in the field of health and behavioural science.\n\nâIt is humbling and flattering to receive this honour, and I'm especially fortunate to have been part of an exceptional team within the Faculty of Health and Behavioural Sciences at UQ that has built strong alliances with our many health sector partners,â Professor Abernethy said.\n\nâThese collaborations are fundamental to developing a more sustainable health system where clinical care and health promotion, training of the next generation and the advancement of knowledge work seamlessly together.â\n\nProfessor Gail Garveyâs significant service to Indigenous health and cancer research has been recognised with a Member of the Order of Australia (AM).\n\nâI see this award as recognition of the partnerships developed over many years with Indigenous communities and cancer services to develop equitable, safe and timely models of care for First Nations peoples,â Professor Garvey said.\n\nâThis collaborative approach will make positive health and wellbeing outcomes achievable in our communities.â\n\nQueensland Brain Institute (QBI) Chairman Mr Jeff Maclean received a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) for significant service to the community through a range of organisations.\n\nâIt is a great honour to be recognised for supporting QBI along with several other organisations, though I must admit to being a little embarrassed when I compare myself to some of the wonderful researchers and the amazing work they are doing at QBI,â Mr Maclean said.\n\nâEach year, we have tried to provide extra funds for research and encouraged friends, family and business associates to contribute to the ground-breaking work being done at QBI, and Iâd like to thank everyone who has supported these efforts.â\n\nProfessor Paul Harpur was recognised with a Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) for service to people with disability.\n\nâIn higher education, we educate, employ, and produce research that is transforming the world for the better,â Professor Harpur said.\n\nâI feel privileged to support the university sector to become disability champions of change, so more Australians will be able to turn their dreams into reality in a world that is fair and inclusive for all.â"
