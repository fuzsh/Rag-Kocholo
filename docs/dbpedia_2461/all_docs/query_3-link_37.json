It is the size historical imperial medals (eg WW1, WW2, Korea, Vietnam, etc) were originally issued prior to the Australian Honours & Awards system being instituted in 1975. Since then, an original set has comprised a full size medal, miniature medal, and ribbon bar in a protective case.\n\nFull Size Medals are also able to be engraved with the service person's service number, initials and surname as the originals would have been\n\nSimply add a mounting service to your purchase. Both styles still have a brooch bar on the back to enable them to be worn on clothing. If none of the above criteria are relevant to your order, you are free to go with personal preference."
