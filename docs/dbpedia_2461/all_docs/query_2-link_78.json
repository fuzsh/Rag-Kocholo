        "text": "‘State capture’ by fossil fuel, defence and other powerful industries is more systematic and entrenched than corruption but falls short of the definition of oligarchy, or corporate dictatorship. It exists in a distinct place in the middle, where private sector actors get hold of democratic levers to shape policy in their interest, no matter the outcome of elections.\n\nThe World Bank coined the ‘state capture’ phrase when observing private sector actors in former eastern bloc states shaping policies to serve their narrow interests. The power comes through control over resources, the threat of state violence, or other forms of influence on the judiciary, bureaucracies and government.\n\nIn Australia, state capture explains why no matter which major party forms government, powerful industries always seem to win.\n\nFighting state capture at election time means voting for people who don’t bank cheques from the huge companies, and who are not part of the revolving door between industry and politics.\n\nOpinion polling and the surge in volunteers working to elect independents and Greens indicate that more Australians understand that a big, uncaptured and raucous crossbench can restore some integrity to parliament and fight corporations undermining democracy.\n\nEarly in 2022, the Australian Democracy Network published a report titled ‘Confronting State Capture’ which outlined six channels of state capture: financial, lobbying, revolving doors, institutional repurposing, research and policymaking, and public influence campaigns.\n\nThe foundation of state capture is money: using it to fund political parties, buy access to decision makers and wage third party attack campaigns. Lobbying is then used to build relationships, either through consultancies, direct CEO-Minister contact, or peak bodies.\n\nRevolving doors, the great merry-go-round or golden escalator, sees people working as Ministers or advisers one day and company directors or lobbyists the next, providing familiarity with process and people in decision making roles.\n\nThe mostly observable work of policy and research involves the think tanks, the ‘Big 4’ professional services consultancies, and industry peak bodies. They allow these companies to cover every Senate inquiry, every piece of legislation, and infiltrate every regulatory body – unlike affected populations, community groups or social movements.\n\nInstitutional repurposing occurs when public authorities like the CSIRO or Bureau of Meteorology, or environmental protection authorities or universities are hollowed out through placing industry people on the board, changing underpinning legislation, gradually diverting them from the public interest to serving private industry. Finally, there are the public influence campaigns that are run on traditional media platforms and social media.\n\nRevolving doors and golden escalators\n\nWhen senior public officials and politicians ‘retire’ from public service and move into lobbyist roles in industry, they take with them an extensive contact network, deep institutional knowledge, and rare and privileged personal access to people at the highest levels of government.\n\nTheir presence in the private sector entrenches the influence of industry over policymaking and government procurement decisions – decisions that should be entirely unmoved by commercial imperatives.\n\nThe ministerial code supposedly requires ministers to not lobby government for industries connected to their portfolio for a period of 18 months, and yet some politicians don’t even wait before they have left office.\n\nIn defence of the realm\n\nFormer Liberal Trade and Investment Minister Andrew Robb on the day before his resignation, took up a job with Chinese-owned developer Landbridge, the leaseholder of the strategically important Port of Darwin.\n\nUpon leaving parliament, former Liberal party Defence Minister Christopher Pyne was immediately employed with corporate consultants EY Defence (Ernst & Young) to help them grow their defence business, and Adelaide-based arms industry lobbyists GC Advisory.\n\nFormer Liberal Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop overseeing the Australian Aid agency, became a director with private aid contractor Palladium.\n\nLabor MP Mike Kelly went in 2020 directly from the powerful Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security into the arms of Palantir, a creepy US global surveillance consultancy.\n\nBrendan Nelson, former Liberal Party leader, Defence Minister, and director of the Australian War Memorial, is now president of Boeing Australia, New Zealand and South Pacific, a top five contractor to Defence. Nelson is also on the board of defence advisory and weapons lobbyist Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI).\n\nThe former Labor defence minister Stephen Smith, chairs the Perth-based cybersecurity company Sapien Cyber.\n\nFormer Labor senator and chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, Stephen Loosley joined the board of French arms multinational Thales Australia.\n\nFormer Liberal defence minister Robert Hill is on the board of German weapons-maker Rheinmetall’s Australian subsidiary, which is supplying Defence’s $5 billion of Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles.\n\nFormer Labor defence minister and Labor leader Kim ‘Bomber’ Beazley joined the board of Lockheed Martin Australia and was the chair of EY Defence lobby group.\n\nFormer Foreign Minister Alexander Downer had been closely involved in negotiations on the Timor Sea boundary, to the ultimate advantage of Woodside Petroleum. As an ex-MP, he established a political advisory consultancy, Bespoke Approach, which was contracted by Woodside to lobby the East Timorese government to accept the basing of Timor’s LNG processing in Darwin rather than in Timor. Downer’s former DFAT departmental head, Ashton Calvert, also retired and joined the board of Woodside.\n\nIt’s not just ministers who seem to struggle on the Commonwealth pension, but also senior military and intelligence heads who pick up work with their former clients.\n\nFormer Chief of the Defence Force Mark Binskin, exactly a year after he retired as Defence Force Chief, was appointed as ‘non-executive director, defence and national security policy’ at BAE Systems Australia, one of Australia’s top three defence contractors. BAE Systems is in the running to provide Australia’s planned nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS military pact.\n\nFive months after leaving his post as ASIO chief, Duncan Lewis joined the Australian board of Thales, a French arms and security multinational and a top three Australian defence contractor.\n\nFormer defence secretary, head of the Office of National Intelligence (ONI) and director general of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS), Nick Warner, joined the board of defence lobbying firm Dragoman Global, whose clients include French submarine company, Naval Group Australia.\n\nFormer defence secretary and ASIO boss, Dennis Richardson, joined the board of Vault Cloud, which provides high-security cloud infrastructure for government and critical industries.\n\nFormer chief of army, Lt Gen Ken Gillespie, chairperson of ASPI’s council, has joined the boards of Naval Group Australia and cybersecurity firm Senetas Corporation.\n\nRetired Air Vice-Marshal Margaret Staib joined the board of QinetiQ, a British defence multinational that is deeply embedded with Defence’s weapons arm, Defence Science and Technology.\n\nFormer defence secretary Allan Hawke joined the Lockheed Martin Australia board as well as the military advisory and lobbyist group, ASPI.\n\nChief of Army Peter Leahy soon joined the boards of Codan, manufacturer of military communications equipment, and Electro Optic Systems, manufacturer of machine guns exported to UAE and Saudi Arabia, both at war against Yemen.\n\nFossil fuelled influence\n\nA key weakness in the Lobbying Code is that it only applies to ministers, and has no application to senior public servants, nor to MPs who have spent years on relevant committees.\n\nWhile the defence and intelligence industries are renowned for making astute appointments of former ministers and senior bureaucrats, the fossil-fuel industries are also keen to exchange personnel with governments to share the knowledge and contacts that secure their deep influence.\n\nFormer ALP WA Treasurer and Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt retired from politics in 2021 and immediately joined the boards of fossil-fuel exploiting companies Rio Tinto and Woodside.\n\nJohn Kunkel, former Deputy CEO of the Minerals Council of Australia, became Prime Minister Morrison’s Chief of Staff.\n\nBrendan Pearson, former CEO of the Minerals Council became an advisor to Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Finance Minister Mattias Cormann.\n\nFormer ALP Resources Minister Martin Ferguson almost immediately took up a role as Chairman of the APPEA Advisory Council, non-executive director at British Gas, and a non-executive directorship and head of natural resources of Seven Group Holdings, owner of Seven West media and major shareholder in Beach Energy.\n\nMark Vaile, former Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the National Party left parliament in 2008 and was the Chairman of Whitehaven Coal by 2012.\n\nIan Macfarlane, immediately after his resignation as Liberal-National party Resources and Industry minister in 2016, was hired as the CEO of the Queensland Resources Council and occupies a board position with Woodside Petroleum.\n\nThe use of ‘institutional repurposing’\n\nOne of the most threatening aspects of state capture is the manipulation or ‘repurposing’ of government agencies set up to serve the public interest, through a process of board appointments, legislative amendments or cultural drift.\n\nThe Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) have been persistent targets for repurposing by fossil industries. Set up as a key component of the carbon price negotiations in 2012, the two agencies were spared from abolition under Prime Minister Abbott along with the rest of the Clean Energy Act in 2014. Having failed at multiple attempts to abolish the agencies, the Government attempted repurposing instead.\n\nIn 2015, Prime Minister Abbott was unsuccessful in attempts to stop the CEFC from funding wind power. In 2020 the Morrison Government proposed the CEFC be permitted to fund loss-making investments in fossil gas power, handing energy minister Angus Taylor much greater discretion over fund allocation.\n\nAngus Taylor has also issued regulations to force the Australian Renewable Energy Agency to fund technologies that are not renewable, like carbon capture and storage (CCS). In early 2021 the National Party proposed rewriting the CEFC’s mandate to include investments in nuclear, “high intensity” coal plants and carbon capture projects.\n\nAt CSIRO, the Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance (GISERA) initiative was launched in July 2011. Despite its CSIRO label, its research committees are heavily populated with gas industry nominees.\n\nResearchers work with data provided by the gas industry, study it using funds provided by the gas industry, and publish findings under the prestigious banner of the CSIRO, using commercial-in-confidence source material that makes peer review impossible.\n\nIn July 2019 GISERA published the findings of one such closed study into fugitive methane emissions from the CSG industry, announcing that “Results of this latest research underline the potential climate benefits of using gas in place of coal to generate electricity…” APPEA and its member companies regularly cite this study, wielding the CSIRO brand against local communities and industry critics.\n\nThe Bureau Of Meteorology (BOM) was by 2019 taking $4.6 million in annual payments for services to the oil and gas industry, Shell, Santos, Chevron, and Woodside. Freedom of Information disclosures revealed that climate change was being routinely deleted from presentations on extreme weather events, “to even more fully meet customer needs”.\n\nThe Bureau’s chief executive was quoted expressing a view that ‘the Bureau should not be proactively discussing climate context’. This information was included in confidential discussions about an information video being produced titled ‘Bushfires and Exceptional Heat: What is driving our weather right now’.\n\nIn mid-2019 activists with Extinction Rebellion, began a series of high-profile actions using lock-on pipes to block roads and railway lines, drawing significant media attention. The Queensland Resources Council (QRC) was quick to condemn the tactic, demanding the state Government introduce new laws to ban the devices.\n\nPremier Palaszczuk had them fast-tracked and passed by October of that year: “The laws passed the Parliament with an overwhelming majority, including both the Government and the LNP,” the QRC noted approvingly the day after the bill’s passage.\n\nFrustration with the string of failings and corruption of Australian democracy is widespread, but rarely described or understood as a systemic threat posed by corporations.\n\nAustralia will benefit by an understanding that what is needed are systemic solutions to deliver a healthy Australian democracy which works for all of us, not just for the powerful few.\n\nAccording to the ‘Confronting State Capture’ report, there are practical steps that can be taken to reclaim our democracy. Firstly there is a need to recognise state capture as a systemic threat to Australian democracy. Secondly, all political parties and candidates should commit to legislating reforms under the Framework for a Fair Democracy.\n\nThen there needs to be created political, economic and social consequences for the corporate powers and the political decision makers who participate in the tactics of state capture. And finally, diverse civil participation at the heart of a healthy democracy must be protected.\n\nThe threat can be tackled by the Australian community because, despite all the malign forces acting against them, Australian voters can elect people who will not be ‘bought’ by corporate entities.\n\nThe threat has been recognised – and it is named ‘state capture’. Now it has to be fought: at the ballot box, in the boardrooms, and on the streets."
