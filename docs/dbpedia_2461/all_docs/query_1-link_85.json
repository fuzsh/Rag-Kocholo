        "text": "This year marks the first anniversary of the Dams Raid to take place after the death on 7 December 2022 of Sqn Ldr George ‘Johnny’ Johnson, aged 101, the last survivor of the 133 men from the Allied forces who took part in it.\n\nA complete list of these men from British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and American air crew is shown below. The raid was undertaken by 617 Squadron of the RAF, specially formed for the operation and took place on 16 and 17 May 1943, eighty years ago this week. Eight of the nineteen Lancaster aircraft which carried out the raid, taking off from RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, were destroyed, resulting in the loss of 53 crew men. Three more men were captured and remained prisoners of war until 1945.\n\nThe Dams Raid caused the collapse of two significant dams in the Möhne and Eder valleys, resulting in a large loss of life. These should not be ignored on this anniversary. The official records show that 1,294 people died as the result of the breach of the Möhne Dam, with 794 listed as ‘foreigners’ of whom 493 were Ukranian women labourers, ordered back to their camp for safety when the air raid warnings were sounded. A further 47 lives were lost in the Eder valley.\n\nThe names of the aircrew appear below in the order of the three designated ‘waves’: the first tasked to attack the Möhne and Eder dams, the second to attack the Sorpe, and the third flying as a mobile reserve. Each aircraft is listed in the order in which they took off.\n\nEach man has an individual entry on this blog, and the link to his page appears under his name here.\n\nAJ-G\n\nWg Cdr G P Gibson DSO & Bar DFC & Bar\n\nPilot AJ-G\n\nSurvived Dams Raid\n\nAwarded VC\n\nBorn Simla, India, 12 August 1918\n\nKIA 20 September 1944 [Read more]\n\nSgt J Pulford\n\nFlight engineer AJ-G\n\nSurvived Dams Raid\n\nAwarded DFM\n\nBorn Hull, 24 December 1919\n\nKIA 13 February 1944 [Read more]\n\nPlt Off H T Taerum\n\nNavigator AJ-G\n\nSurvived Dams Raid\n\nAwarded DFC\n\nBorn Milo, Alberta, Canada, 22 May 1920\n\nKIA 16 September 1943 [Read more]\n\nFlt Lt R E G Hutchison DFC\n\nWireless operator AJ-G\n\nSurvived Dams Raid\n\nAwarded Bar to DFC\n\nBorn Liverpool, 26 April 1918\n\nKIA 16 September 1943 [Read more]\n\nPlt Off F M Spafford DFM\n\nBomb aimer AJ-G\n\nSurvived Dams Raid\n\nAwarded DFC\n\nBorn Adelaide, South Australia, 16 June 1918\n\nKIA 16 September 1943 [Read more]\n\nFlt Sgt G A Deering\n\nFront gunner AJ-G\n\nSurvived Dams Raid\n\nAwarded DFC\n\nBorn Kirkintilloch, Scotland, 23 July 1919\n\nKIA 16 September 1943 [Read more]\n\nFlt Lt R D Trevor-Roper DFM\n\nRear gunner AJ-G\n\nSurvived Dams Raid\n\nAwarded DFC\n\nBorn, Shanklin, Isle of Wight, 19 May 1915\n\nKIA 31 March 1944 [Read more]\n\nAJ-M\n\nFlt Lt J V Hopgood DFC & Bar\n\nPilot\n\nKilled on Dams Raid\n\nBorn Hurst, Berkshire, 29 August 1921 [Read more]\n\nSgt C C Brennan\n\nFlight engineer\n\nKilled on Dams Raid\n\nBorn 22 February 1916, Calgary, Alberta, Canada [Read more]\n\nFlg Off K Earnshaw\n\nNavigator\n\nKilled on Dams Raid\n\nBorn Bridlington, Yorkshire, 23 June 1918 [Read more]\n\nSgt J W Minchin\n\nWireless operator\n\nKilled on Dams Raid\n\nBorn 29 November 1915, Bourton on the Water, Gloucestershire [Read more]\n\nFlt Sgt J W Fraser\n\nBomb aimer\n\nSurvived Dams Raid.

It is the largest Commonwealth war cemetery in Germany – the last resting place for 7672 men who fought with the Allied services in the Second World War. Of these, 3915 flew with the various air forces.\n\nAmongst these lie 32 Dambusters, making this quiet spot the place on earth where there are the most Dams Raid veterans buried. Twenty-seven of the 53 who died on the Dams Raid itself are now interred here (Bill Astell and his crew, Norman Barlow and his crew, Henry Maudslay and his crew, and Warner Ottley and the six of his crew who were killed). Five more men, all by then flying in the crew of Sqn Ldr George Holden and killed on the fateful Dortmund Ems Canal raid on 17 September 1943, also lie here.\n\nThe Dambuster graves are in groups in different parts of the cemetery. Seven of them lie together in one row, not far from the edge. This is the crew of AJ-E: Norman Barlow, pilot; Leslie Whillis, flight engineer; Philip Burgess, navigator; Charlie Williams, wireless operator; Alan Gillespie, bomb aimer; Harvey Glinz, front gunner and Jack Liddell, rear gunner. And on 18 May this year it was at their graves that we first paid our respects, coming as we had from the unveiling of a new memorial at their crash site near Haldern, about 30km away.\n\nThis was an experienced crew, all of whom had served together in 61 Squadron at RAF Syerston. Three were in their 30s, and six had been commissioned as officers. Unfortunately all this experience came to nought when their aircraft, targeted with an attack on the Sorpe Dam, collided with a high tension electric pylon on the edge of a small wood, and crashed in flames. They were all killed instantly and their bodies were then taken to Dusseldorf North cemetery for burial. After the war, like many other Allied aircrew from other parts of Germany, their remains were exhumed and reinterred in Reichswald Forest.\n\nAlthough the gravestones were all produced to a standardised format, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission allowed each family to choose a quotation or dedication to appear at the foot of the stone. Not all took this opportunity but when they did, it’s their words which frequently produce the lump-in-throat moment as you walk between the lines of stones.\n\nThe AJ-E men each have something added.\n\nHarvey Glinz’s stone has the simplest dedication: “Always remembered”. Leslie Whillis and Philip Burgess have similar quotations. “Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends” is the usually quoted version which appears in the King James Bible version of St John’s Gospel. This appears on Burgess’s stone, while Whillis’s has the variation: “Greater love hath no man than this, he gave his life for his friends.” Charlie Williams’s grave bears words which seem to encapsulate the emotions his family must have felt by the death in a faraway cold land of a country boy from an Australian sheep farm: “He gallantly died renouncing all the things that he loved”. The age of the youngest man to take part in the Dams Raid, Jack Liddell, is alluded to by his family: “ In the prime of his youth he died that we might live”. Norman Barlow, the only one to be both a husband and a father, is remembered for the former achievement, if not the latter: “ In loving memory of my husband who gave all for his country”. And Alan Gillespie’s stone reads: “At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them”.\n\nThese last words are, of course, taken from Laurence Binyon’s famous poem, “For the Fallen”. Its fourth stanza will be read out many times this week:\n\nThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old\n\nAge shall not weary them, nor the years condemn\n\nAt the going down of the sun and in the morning\n\nWe will remember them.\n\nAnd every time the audience or congregation repeat the last four words, we should think not just of these seven men, nor just the 53 who died on the Dams Raid, nor even of the 55,000 men of Bomber Command who died in the Second World War, but of the countless millions who have died in conflict before and since. Each of these was someone’s son or daughter, brother or sister, father or mother. “My subject is war and the pity of war.”\n\n“We will remember them.”\n\nPic: Wim Govaerts\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered on Sunday 17 May 2015 on the edge of a small wood in Haldern, north western Germany, to pay tribute to the crew of Dams Raid Lancaster AJ-E, piloted by Flt Lt Norman Barlow DFC. This was the spot where the aircraft crashed shortly before midnight on the night of 16 May 1943, en route to attack the Sorpe Dam.\n\nSome of Norman Barlow’s letters home to his mother in Australia were read out during the ceremony. In one, written on 3 May 1943, he told her about the new aircraft he had been assigned for the Dams Raid. “I have just got a brand new machine. “E” for Edward or Elsie or Elliott. I hope I am as lucky as I was with “G” for George”.\n\nAnd then, just 12 days later and the night before died, he sent love to everyone back at home, including his daughter, then four years old: “I must close now and have a bath and get a little shut eye whilst I can. So keep your chin up Mother dear it can’t last forever. Your loving son Norman xxxx.”\n\nSadly, E-Edward would not turn out to be not a lucky machine for Norman and his crew, and they were all killed instantly in the crash. For seventy years, the site was not marked in any way, but then in 2013 local historian Volker Schürmann began a campaign to have a permanent memorial established. He organised a public appeal which succeded in raising the funds, after many generous donations from supporters from around the world. There were further donations of materials from the local community, and the farmer on whose land the aircraft crashed was kind enough to make a space available.\n\nRelatives and representatives of five of the crew travelled to Germany, and unveiled the memorial. Wreathes were also laid by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Canadian Air Force, by other organisations, and by the local community. A guard of honour was provided by the Haldern Fire Brigade, and musical tributes were played by the Haldern Brass Band.\n\nHuge thanks go to all the people of Haldern who donated to and supported the memorial, and to all those who travelled to Germany to take part in the ceremony.\n\nPictures below by Wim Govaerts and Mitch Buiting.\n\nBanner depicting the crew of AJ-E.

Crashed on outward flight.\n\nAlan Gillespie was born on 16 November 1922 in Hesket, Westmorland. He was the second of the four children of Robert and Margaret Gillespie. His father was a railway porter. The family then moved to Long Marton, near Appleby. Alan Gillespie went to the village school in Long Marton and then Appleby Grammar School. After leaving school he worked as a clerk in a solicitor’s practice before volunteering for the RAF in 1940. He was eventually selected for aircrew and sent to Canada for training in September 1941.\n\nAfter returning to the UK, he underwent further training and met up with Norman Barlow and Leslie Whillis at 16 OTU in July 1942. All three were eventually posted to 61 Squadron in September 1942, and did their first operation together over the Alps to Turin on 20 November.\n\nBy March 1943, Barlow and Gillespie had both completed their tours. On their penultimate operation, a trip to Berlin, flight engineer Leslie Whillis had been left behind, in favour of Gp Capt Reginald Odbert, flying as second pilot. Odbert was the station commander at RAF Syerston, a popular Irish rugby international who had joined the RAF before the war and captained the RAF rugby team. He was killed in a flying accident in June 1943.\n\nGilliespie’s tour ended with a recommendation for a DFM. The citation read:\n\n‘This Air Bomber has carried out 30 successful sorties on all the main targets in Germany and Italy, including six attacks on Essen and five on Berlin. He has frequently obtained excellent photographs, one of his best being the aiming point on Krupps. He has shown himself cool and collected under heavy fire in the target area and has set an excellent example to others in his crew and the rest of the squadron. Strongly recommended for the award of the Distinguished Flying Medal.’\n\nWhen Barlow set about putting together a crew who would accompany him on to 617 Squadron Gillespie and Whillis, who had been with him since their training days, were obvious choices. Both were commissioned two days before the Dams Raid. Whether they had time to move from the Sergeants’ to the Officers’ Mess is not recorded.\n\nIt was therefore as a newly fledged Pilot Officer that Alan Gillespie met his end. Flying in the nose of the Lancaster at treetop level, he may have seen the pylon they hit near Haldern a split second before impact.\n\nAlan Gillespie and his comrades were buried first in Dusseldorf, but after the war they were reinterred in Reichswald Forest War Cemetery. The DFM he had won a few weeks before was presented to his family posthumously. The official notice appeared in the same July 1945 issue of the London Gazette as the one for Charlie Williams.\n\nMore about Gillespie online:\n\nEntry at Commonwealth War Graves Commission\n\nEntry at Aircrew Remembered website\n\nKIA 16.05.43\n\nRank and decorations as of 16 May 1943.\n\nSources:\n\nRichard Morris, Guy Gibson, Penguin 1995\n\nJohn Sweetman, The Dambusters Raid, Cassell 2002\n\nEric Fry, An Airman Far Away, Kangaroo Press 1993\n\nThe information above has been taken from the books and online sources listed above, and other online material.
