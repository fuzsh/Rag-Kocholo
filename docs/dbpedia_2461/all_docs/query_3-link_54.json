        "text": "Two former state premiers, a veteran refugee advocate and one of Australia’s richest women are among the hundreds of Australians to receive awards in this year’s King’s birthday honours.\n\nWhile there are plenty of notable names sprinkled among the 737 Australians recognised, the governor general, David Hurley, noted that “the vast majority” are those quietly making a huge impact in their communities.\n\nSister Jane Keogh, 78, has been advocating for refugees “pretty well every day” since the Tampa affair in 2001. While the work could be “very discouraging” at times and significant policy change was yet to occur, Keogh said, it was the ability to “give hope to some people who otherwise have no hope” that kept her going.\n\nReceiving an AM for her advocacy, Keogh believed that Australia was “living with the weight of our inhumanity of our attitudes to refugees over these 20 years”. If she could say one thing to Australia’s political leaders, it would be: “Grow a heart, live off principles and recover our belief in human rights.”\n\n“The world’s become such a political state and politicians go into their jobs full of good [intentions], and then it becomes a political battle,” Keogh said. “Currently it’s just a battle over fear of being wedged and trying to get back into parliament, and the people who suffer are the vulnerable – the refugees in particular.\n\n“The opposition has done a good job making it a political issue and using fear mongering as a weapon, so I think that’s been a problem.”\n\nSign up for Guardian Australia’s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup\n\nThe Catholic nun has spent many hours in protest, most notably spending 26 days outside of Parliament House in 2015, braving frosty mornings and -3C temperatures. She acknowledged that it was challenging for young people to take up social causes amid the cost-of-living crisis, but said the student-led solidarity camps for Gaza had filled her with hope.\n\n“In the [past] 20 years, that’s the first big upsurge I’ve found of young university people and younger people really taking on the cause of the vulnerable or justice,” she said. “There’s always been a trickle of them there … but [we’re] certainly seeing them now come out and take up a cause that doesn’t just affect them personally.”\n\nAlso receiving an AM this year was multimillionaire Sarina Russo, one of Australia’s richest women, who founded a group of training and job placement companies.\n\nRusso, who has been dubbed “Australia’s job queen”, was recognised for “significant service to business, to the community and to vocational education and training”.\n\nUnder the Abbott government, Sarina Russo Job Access won two major federal government contracts with the Department of Education and Training through open tender – worth $41.2m and $4.4m respectively.\n\nShe was ranked 59th on this year’s Rich Women list, with a net worth of $271m. In April she attracted controversy after posting a video to social media urging Australians to “get a job” and rely on themselves for financial independence.\n\nOther notable AM recipients included Indigenous artist Bronwyn Bancroft, the Asio director general, Mike Burgess, the Health Services Union secretary, Gerard Hayes, and former NSW Liberal party deputy leader Jillian Skinner.\n\nFormer political leaders were among the six AC recipients, the highest honour to be awarded, including former premiers Daniel Andrews and Mark McGowan, who became familiar faces across the country during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe late Simon Crean was also awarded an AC, having led the Labor party as leader of the opposition from 2001 to 2003.\n\nThis year is Hurley’s last as governor general, and he said it had been a “tremendous privilege” to preside over the honours list. Incoming governor-general Samantha Mostyn, who will be sworn in next month, was also among the six AC recipients.\n\n“Some names are well-known, but the vast majority are not – they are people who work tirelessly and selflessly to make a difference in our community,” Hurley said.\n\n“Through today’s recognition we shine a light on their efforts, the impact they have and the difference they make.”\n\nReceiving an AO was the former Labor minister and chairman of the Future Fund, Greg Combet, and former international cricketer Glenn McGrath.\n\nColleen Taylor, a former Centrelink official who blew the whistle on serious problems with the unlawful robodebt scheme, was honoured with an OAM for service to public administration.\n\nComedians Hamish Blake and Jimmy Rees were also recognised with an OAM, as were the former NSW local government minister Shelley Hancock, former Liberal politician Rhonda Parker and professional golfer Peter Senior.\n\nThis year’s honour roll includes 493 recipients of the general division of the order of Australia, plus 25 recipients in the military division, 162 meritorious awards and 57 conspicuous awards.\n\nThe list also includes 34 Australians recognised for their contribution to the country’s pandemic response, who will be included in the ongoing Covid-19 honour roll."
