        "text": "An important part of the role of the Governor, both at Government House and around the State, is the recognition of significant contributions to the Victorian community.\n\nThis is done in a wide variety of ways, including honours and awards in the Order of Australia, Bravery Awards, Australian of the Year awards, Rhodes Scholarships, the Governor of Victoria’s Export Awards, and a range of other awards for volunteering, research and other forms of excellence.\n\nThe Governor presents these honours, awards and medals to recipients at official ceremonies and functions at Government House.\n\nAustralian honours and awards\n\nAustralia’s system of honours and awards recognises an individual’s excellence, achievement or meritorious service and contribution to our society.\n\nThe awards and honours are announced twice a year by the Governor-General on Australia Day (26 January) and on the Queen’s Birthday in June.\n\nAustralia’s system of honours and awards includes the following categories:\n\nthe Order of Australia, which recognises outstanding achievement and service. The Order of Australia has both a General Division and a Military Division and includes Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), Officer of the Order of Australia (AO), Member of the Order of Australia (AM) and Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM)\n\nAustralian Bravery Decorations, which recognise acts of bravery by Australian citizens in ordinary life\n\nGallantry Decorations, which recognise members of the Australian Defence Force and certain other persons who perform acts of gallantry in action\n\nMeritorious Awards, including the Public Service Medal, the Australian Police Medal, the Australian Fire Service Medal, the Ambulance Service Medal, the Emergency Services Medal, the Australian Antarctic Medal and the Australian Corrections Medal.\n\nConspicuous Service Decorations, which recognise members of the Australian Defence Force and certain other persons for outstanding or meritorious achievement or devotion to duty in non-warlike situations.\n\nNominations\n\nFor some categories of award, such as awards in the Order of Australia and Bravery Awards, nominations can be made by any person and at any time.\n\nInformation about how you can nominate someone for the Order of Australia or a Bravery Award is on the Governor-General's website.\n\nInvestitures\n\nVictorian recipients are invested with their awards by the Governor at official ceremonies at Government House, Melbourne. An exception to this is that investitures for Companions of the Order of Australia are conducted by the Governor-General at Government House, Canberra.\n\nIf you are a recipient of an honour or award, you will receive a letter inviting you to attend an investiture.\n\nThis letter will explain matters such as:\n\nYou may be accompanied by up to 4 guests. Unfortunately, requests for extra guests cannot be met due to the high number of recipients at each ceremony. In the interests of fairness to all recipients, no exceptions are made to this arrangement.\n\nThe dress code is lounge suit/day wear, or uniform where appropriate. Service personnel should consult their respective headquarters on dress. Medals are not worn.\n\nThe time you will be required to arrive at Government House ahead of the ceremony.\n\nPast recipients\n\nFind out who has received an Australian honour or award in the past.\n\nPast investiture ceremonies can be viewed at here.\n\nAustralian of the Year awards\n\nEach year, as part of the Australian of the Year awards, a Victorian is selected to progress to the national level of judging in the following categories:\n\nAustralian of the Year\n\nSenior Australian of the Year (65 years or over)\n\nYoung Australian of the Year (16 to 30 years)\n\nAustralia's Local Hero\n\nThe Victorian finalists are announced each year at a State award presentation in October or November, and the national recipients are announced on the eve of Australia Day in January at a ceremony in Canberra."
