        "text": "Oturehua identity Ken Gillespie wears many hats as he tends and enjoys his much-loved community. Pam Jones finds out about his commitment to a range of sectors in Central Otago.\n\nQ What is your involvement with Hayes Engineering Works and what will people see at its next operating day on April 2?\n\nI have been taking the operating tours through Hayes Engineering for about 20 years. Ernest Hayes made a multitude of different farm aids at Oturehua, most of them fencing-related — the wire strainers and triplex — but also windmills, cattlestops and a lot of stock-handling equipment. Having the belt-driven works running brings it to life. People can see how, in particular, the fencing standards were made. Also there are drills, a hacksaw and lathe which still operate today.\n\nQ How long have you lived in the Oturehua district and what do you like about it?\n\nI have lived in Oturehua all my life and seen a multitude of changes over the years, both in climate, people and farming, and from the earlier days of my life, with the railways, post office, Ministry of Works, thriving store in Oturehua and Hayes. I’ve seen the store have four permanent people, plus two on delivering; Hayes with eight staff in the works; two on shift work in the telephone exchange; and a postmaster. We also used to have a resident policeman in Oturehua.\n\nThe people, family and community are what is important to me. Oturehua has always been a caring community and looked after one another. Farming has been enjoyable and rewarding. Modern machinery has made jobs on the farm a lot quicker and easier over the years.\n\nQ Every year you welcome the Brass Monkey motorbike rally on to your property. What bikes, people and stories have you encountered over the years?\n\nThe Brass Monkey Rally is in its 37th year and is still popular. A lot of people we see returning year after year. We have certainly made some improvements over the 37 years it has been going, in how we looked after the participants. Apart from a couple of minor altercations, the rally has always been trouble-free, and it is also a tremendous fundraiser for the district.\n\nQ Curling is a favourite pastime of yours over the winter. What are your hopes for this season?\n\nCurling and skating have always been popular pastimes during the winter in Oturehua, and we always hope for enough ice for all to enjoy.\n\nQ You are also involved with the Maniototo Presbyterian Church, and are a local sexton. What are the benefits of small church communities?\n\nI have been an elder in the Maniototo Presbyterian Church for a number of years. The church community is a smaller part of the community than it used to be, but is still a very important part of the community through the pastoral care it provides.\n\nQ The Otago Central Rail Trail passes through Oturehua and has revitalised many other Central Otago communities as well. What do you make of the trail’s success after all these years?\n\nI am one of the trustees on the rail trail trust and have watched the trail grow over the years. It has certainly revitalised the small communities along its length, with businesses such as accommodation and food providers.\n\nQ What has your irrigation work involved in the Oturehua district, and what changes have you seen? Will Central Otago’s golden landscapes remain, or will we see more green fields and cows in paddocks?\n\nI have been involved in irrigation for the past 40 years and there have certainly been some changes, particularly the change from Ministry of Works operation of the old schemes to company ownership by the farmers as shareholders.\n\nThe change from the old Catchment Board structure to the Otago Regional Council and a new set of operational rules has seen the bureaucratic cost structure certainly increase, and it constantly keeps us on our toes.\n\nBut the changes don’t mean we’re going to see cows everywhere. We’re still only looking at partial irrigation. We’ll still see our golden fields in Central Otago. We won’t see the cows take over."
