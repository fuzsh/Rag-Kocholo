The duration was for a year until November 1991. The first four months of his posting coincided with the lead up to the first Gulf War. He was required him to carry a Nuclear, Biological and Chemical warfare suit because there was a fear that Scud missiles launched by Iraq against Israel would be armed with weapons of mass destruction. His first duty station, until April 1991, was the Observer Group Golan-Tiberias. Nikolic served first in static observation posts (OP’s) and was then selected to visit OPs on both Israeli and Syrian sides of the area of separation.\n\nHis second duty station was with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon between May and November 1991.
