        "text": "Australian citizens are recognised for their achievements and service to the community through Australian Honours.\n\nNot to be confused with the Australian of the Year Award(opens in a new window). An Australian Honour is the highest recognition for outstanding achievement and service, and was established in 1975.\n\nThe Order of Australia(opens in a new window) is one of the awards included in the Australian Honours. The Order of Australia has four award levels. The Companion of the Order (AC), the Officer of the Order (AO), the Member of the Order (AM) and the Medal of the Order (OAM).\n\nAnyone in the community can nominate someone for an award in the Order of Australia.\n\nIf your nomination is unsuccessful, your nominee may be reconsidered after an interval of 3 years. You will be required to submit your nomination again at this time.\n\nIf the person you are nominating has an Order of Australia (AO, AM or OAM), they may be considered for a promotion within the Order 5 years after their previous appointment or award.\n\nAssessing nominations\n\nNominations are considered by the Council for the Order of Australia, which makes recommendations directly to the Governor-General.\n\nThere are 19 people including representatives of each state and territory, public office holders (ex-officio) and community representatives. The community representatives on the Council are appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister.\n\nMore information can be found on the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia's website.(opens in a new window)\n\nThe Council will look for someone who has gone above and beyond in their contributions to Australian society.\n\nThe Council meets twice a year, usually in February and August, to consider whether each nominee in the Order of Australia has:\n\ndemonstrated achievement at a high level\n\nmade a contribution over and above what might be reasonably expected through paid employment, or\n\nmade a voluntary contribution to the community which stands out from other volunteers.\n\nYour nominee may have:\n\nmade an outstanding contribution to society within their field, whether it's professionally, in sports, the arts, service or community work\n\ncontributed to their community as a volunteer in a way that is over and above the contributions of other volunteers\n\nIf your nomination is unsuccessful, your nominee may be reconsidered after an interval of 3 years. You will be required to submit your nomination again at this time.\n\nIf the person you are nominating has an Order of Australia (AO, AM or OAM), they may be considered for a promotion within the Order 5 years after their previous appointment or award.\n\nAnnouncements\n\nAwards are announced two times each year:\n\nAustralia Day on 26 January\n\nThe King's Birthday in June\n\nAwards\n\nThe Order of Australia has 4 levels and the Council for the Order of Australia will determine the level of the award your nominee receives. You don't need to specify the award level in your nomination.\n\nOur focus through the Recognition Matters initiative is to see an increase in the number of women recognised with Australian Honours. We have provided a list of outstanding women in the 4 levels below.\n\nCompanion of the Order (AC)\n\nThe Council for the Order of Australia defines this honour as achievement and merit of the highest degree for service to Australia or humanity at large. This is the highest award in the Order of Australia and only 35 people are awarded an AC each year.\n\nSome recipients of the Companion of the Order include:\n\nMs Susan Alberti AC\n\nMs Jill Bilcock AC\n\nHer Excellency the Honourable Linda Dessau AC\n\nDr Rhonda Galbally AC\n\nMs Olivia Newton-John AC\n\nOfficer of the Order (AO)\n\nThe Council for the Order of Australia defines this honour as distinguished service of a high degree to Australia or humanity at large.
