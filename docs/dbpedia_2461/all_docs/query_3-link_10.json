        "text": "The Australian system of honours and awards was established in 1975. At this time Queen Elizabeth II approved the institution of the Order of Australia: 'an Australian society of honour for according recognition to Australian citizens and other persons for achievement or meritorious service'.\n\nPrior to 1975 Australians were recognised under the British honours system, also known as Imperial awards.\n\nThe King is the Sovereign Head of the Order of Australia and the Governor-General as Chancellor is charged with the administration of the Order. The Official Secretary to the Governor-General is the Secretary of the Order of Australia.\n\nFrom 1976 to 1986 and 2014 to 2015 there was provision for the appointment of Knights and Dames in the Order of Australia.\n\nThe Neck Badge of a Knight and the Neck/Shoulder Badge of a Dame consists of the Emblem of the Order, approximately 60 millimetres in diameter, of gold, jewelled and having the centre of its convex surface within a circle of gold, a representation of the Arms of the Commonwealth of Australia in full colour on a background of blue with two branches of mimosa in gold, the whole ensigned with the Crown of St Edward in full colour.\n\nThe Breast Badge of a Knight or Dame consists of the Emblem of the Order, approximately 80 millimetres in diameter, of gold, jewelled and having the same design and ensignment as the Neck Badge of a Knight and the Neck/Shoulder Badge of a Dame."
