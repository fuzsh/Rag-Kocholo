Jo-Anne has been a tireless advocate for the environment over a legal career in public interest environmental law spanning three decades. Jo-Anne has made a rare and significant contribution to the development of environmental law and to the protection of the environment. Jo is without peer in her contribution to the protection of the environment of Queensland through law, having led the EDO in that State for more than 25 years.\n\nIn addition to her contribution to EDO Queensland, Jo-Anne was one of the key figures associated with the merger of the Environmental Defenders Offices which was completed in late 2019. Jo-Anne continues to serve the EDO in her role as the organisation’s General Counsel.\n\nJo-Anne has made a lifetime contribution to public interest environmental law and in doing so has contributed immensely across a wide variety of legal fields. Her work has strengthened community rights and placed a spotlight on some of Queensland’s most egregious environmental issues. A tireless and passionate environmental defenders and steadfast contributor to the community, we are delighted that Jo-Anne has received this important award which she richly deserves.\n\nDr Bronwyn Darlington, Chair\n\nDavid Morris, Chief Executive Officer\n\nThe Hon. Alan Wilson QC, Patron"
