        "text": "In recognition of long-standing advocacy and leadership in education, regional and rural development, we’re proud to announce that Margaret O’Rourke, Board Chair of Bendigo Kangan Institute, has been awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia.\n\nPart of the King’s Birthday Honours List 2024, the medal is the highest recognition for outstanding achievement and service to our nation. We are proud Marg’s contribution to community has been recognised today.\n\nMarg has been at the helm of Bendigo Kangan Institute for more than 15 years, joining the Bendigo TAFE in 2008 as a Board Director and serving as Board President when it merged with Kangan Institute in 2014.\n\nMarg stayed on as Deputy Board Chair of Bendigo Kangan Institute (which consists of four brands – Bendigo TAFE, Kangan Institute, VETASSESS and eWorks) until 2022 when she was elected Board Chair.\n\nMarg’s leadership has been instrumental to achieve many great outcomes and deliver significant projects in the region, including the Essendon Health Hub at Essendon Campus in 2022.\n\nMarg has spearheaded major projects currently underway, including:\n\n· Health and Community Centre of Excellence, Broadmeadows Campus\n\n· Hume Tech School, Broadmeadows Campus\n\n· New campus in Sunbury\n\n· New campus in Melton\n\nMarg has been part of a dynamic Board that has supported Bendigo Kangan Institute through a range of challenges – from the pandemic to campus development, industry-wide transformations, and changes in state government leadership.\n\nA key achievement of the Board is the development of Bendigo Kangan Institute’s 2020>2025 Strategic Plan, incorporating a whole-of-organisation transformation program. Driven by the ambition and vision of the Board and leadership team, the change program has resulted in a range of new and improved systems, processes and capabilities, plus more than $30m financial benefits realised and over 13,000 m2 of building revitalised.\n\nDuring this dynamic period, the Board, with Marg as Chair, also saw Kangan Institute reaccredited by the Australian Skills Quality Authority for a further seven years, which is testament to the results of the transformation program and improved ways of working.\n\nCurrently a councillor for the City of Greater Bendigo and former Mayor (2016-2020), Marg’s passion in developing regional education is set to continue with her recent appointment as Head of La Trobe’s Bendigo Campus.\n\nMarg will hold her position as Bendigo Kangan Institute’s Board Chair until the end of her tenure in August 2024.\n\n‌Quotes attributable to Bendigo Kangan Institute Board Chair, Margaret O’Rourke OAM:\n\n“It’s been a team effort. I am so pleased we are seeing Bendigo Kangan making a real difference to our students’ lives, enabling them to be better prepared for their vocational journey.\n\n“It has been a privilege to work with the amazing staff at Bendigo Kangan Institute and the Board. Being ambitious for our endeavours, collaborating and connecting community is what makes me excited for our future.”\n\nQuotes attributable to Kangan Institute CEO, Sally Curtain:\n\n“On behalf of Bendigo Kangan Institute, we congratulate Marg on being awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia. This prestigious honour is a truly deserved recognition of Marg’s outstanding leadership and commitment to regional education and community development.\n\n“Marg’s dedication to Bendigo Kangan Institute and the wider Victorian community has been nothing short of inspiring.\n\n“Marg’s unwavering vision and guidance has led our TAFE to achieve significant milestones, enabling us to keep delivering world-class education in the regions we serve, and providing vital opportunities for countless students, employers and communities.”"
