        "text": "The filming began in the summer of 1972 in two unused hangars at Melbourne's Essendon Airport. Although the crew met the deadline imposed by Nureyev – only four weeks – and the end result was successful, it was a miracle that the film was finished at all.\n\nThe dancers have vivid memories of the extreme heat in the hangars, the absence of dressing rooms and the way they had to stand in their costumes waiting for filming to start each day. They set their alarms for 7am to be ready for the daily bus trip to the airport, and were often asked to stay on the set until 11pm or midnight.\n\nAt times [Nureyev] swore at me, he abused me...one day he gave me a kick in the backside so I ran after him and kicked him back.\n\nDancer Gailene Stock\n\nNureyev, a perfectionist, frequently pushed them too far. One dancer, Gailene Stock, knew how Nureyev reacted if he wasn't completely satisfied. She had learned how to manage his moods during the Don Quixote theatre season at the Adelaide Festival.\n\n\"Rudi pushed me to do more than I thought I could do. He believed in me. But at times he swore at me, he kicked me, he abused me. One day I was standing in the wings and he came around and gave me a kick in the backside, so I turned around and ran after him and kicked him back. If you cried or backed down, he didn't like you.\"\n\nThe world premiere at the Sydney Opera House on July 19 1973 was a gala event. More than 2000 people paid $50 for a ticket to see the film and enjoy a champagne after-party. Oysters, prawns and roast beef were on the menu, and the guests danced to the music of Greek, Hawaiian and Italian bands. The guests of honour, the New South Wales Governor, Sir Roden Cutler, and his wife, arrived in an open, horse-drawn carriage, escorted by a group of mounted police.\n\nLoading\n\nDon Quixote, the film, made enough money to pay off all the costs even with no financial contribution by the Australian Ballet. Although the film was screened in Australian cinemas and on Australian television channels, the bulk of the income came from the sale of video cassettes and, later, DVDs.\n\nThe imp and the hermit\n\nOpposites attract. Or so seemed when the introvert, Kristian Fredrikson, met the extrovert, Graeme Murphy. Fredrikson described himself as a hermit, but only a semi-hermit as he often left his Kings Cross home. He had to. The theatre world is a collaborative business and Fredrikson liked the company of others, although his anguished facial expression sometimes said otherwise. Murphy joked that Fredrikson was \"always full of angst'.\n\nFredrikson, meanwhile, described Murphy as \"an imp. Not a nice pixie. An imp. He's Puck. I marvel at his energy. Graeme has heart, an enormous amount of romanticism and passion.\"\n\nFredrikson, a designer, and Murphy, a dancer and choreographer, first met in 1975 when they worked together on the production of The Revenger's Tragedy at the Melbourne Theatre Company. They didn't know it at the time, but they would soon begin a collaboration that would last for thirty years. Murphy and Fredrikson had much in common.\n\nAs a boy, Murphy moved with his parents from town to town in rural Tasmania.\n\nFredrikson, born in Wellington, New Zealand, moved with his family to Christchurch. While he was at convent school, his carefree life was shattered. Fredrikson and his mother were physically attacked, as they were Catholics who lived in a Protestant area of the city. That experience made him feel like \"an alien. I didn't relate to the world as a human being. They made my mother different, they pushed us into the hole, this sanctuary we had, so for the rest of our lives we read books and went to art films and to the ballet.\"\n\nFredrikson was a still a schoolboy when he saw his first ballet, The Nutcracker, performed by the Borovansky Ballet on tour to New Zealand.\n\n\"It was pure magic. I watched with all the fabulous incredulity of a child. There was snow, ballerinas and lovely music.\"\n\nMurphy's path to a lifetime of dance began when he nagged his parents to take him to ballet classes until they finally agreed. Every weekend they drove for an hour or more from their home to Launceston where Kenneth Gillespie, a former dancer with the Borovansky Ballet, had established the first ballet studio in Tasmania. Like so many children, Murphy danced in a school production of The Nutcracker.\n\nMurphy and Fredrikson both met their mentor Peggy van Praagh, artistic director of the Australian Ballet, in the 1960s. Murphy was a dancer at the Australian Ballet, and Fredrikson, a student at the Wellington School of Design. Fredrikson seized the opportunity to see van Praagh when the Australian Ballet toured to Wellington. He sent a letter to her hotel and was thrilled when she rang his mother, who was \"over the moon that this famous lady having a chat with her\".\n\nWhen van Praagh met Fredrikson and saw his work, she said: \"Well, there are possibilities here. I'll be in touch.\" Within months she invited him to Melbourne to design a production of Aurora's Wedding for the Australian Ballet in 1964.\n\nThe imp takes flight\n\nMurphy's early years as an Australian Ballet dancer ended in the early 1970s after the company's tour to the United States. To expand his horizons, he travelled to the United States on a scholarship and then to Europe, where he danced for six months with the Sadler's Wells Ballet and later with Les Ballets de Félix Blaska in Grenoble. For Murphy, this was \"the way a contemporary [dance] company could look\".\n\nBut he wasn't ready yet for a radical change of direction. When he returned to Australia with his partner, the dancer Janet Vernon, Murphy rejoined the Australian Ballet as a dancer and resident choreographer in 1976. Soon afterwards, Murphy applied for the position of artistic director of the fledgling Sydney Dance Company board.\n\nIn an interview before he officially took up the role, Murphy said he wanted \"a melting pot of styles\" for the company's repertoire and planned to work with dancers familiar with both classical and contemporary dance forms. The interviewer, Jill Sykes, summed him up as he was then – and continued to be in the future: \"His slight figure and rakish grin conceal an ambitious and determined spirit.\"\n\nThe company's headquarters were modest, an old air-conditioning factory transformed into a studio in the Sydney suburb of Woolloomooloo. The studio ceiling was low, so a hole was cut to allow the dancers to jump or lift their partners without smashing their heads. Murphy and Vernon soon had a team by their sides.\n\nThey offered contracts to dancers they knew from the Australian Ballet and Australian Ballet School. One of the first was Paul Mercurio (later the star of the film Strictly Ballroom), who joined the company before he graduated at the Australian Ballet School.\n\nIn the 1980s the transfers from the Australian Ballet to the Sydney Dance Company continued. Over the years, soloists and principals from the Australian Ballet joined the Sydney Dance Company, including Kelvin Coe and Vicki Attard, and a former principal, Garth Welch. Some stayed for years at the company, others for just a year or two, but all were attracted by Murphy's choreography, the chance to show their individual talent and personality, and be on equal terms with the other dancers.\n\nOne dancer, Francoise Philipbert, said she stayed at the company for eleven years as \"Murphy had a unique way of choreographing. There were no real soloist roles. Every ballet had a little bit of each individual's creativity in it since we all participated in the making of the final product.\"\n\nIn 1977, Murphy was seen as an intriguing up-and-coming director but the following year took him to a higher level with the success of Poppy, his first full-length work that premiered in Sydney in April 1978. Audiences grew as the Sydney Dance Company became the coolest dance troupe in Sydney.\n\nIt nearly killed me because it was so beyond our resources; we were pushing these boundaries.\n\nGraeme Murphy\n\nPoppy, the first in a chain of Murphy's works inspired by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, was based on the life of Jean Cocteau, the writer, artist and film-maker who designed posters and wrote scenarios for Diaghilev's company. Poppy's success came at a cost to both Murphy and Vernon. \"It nearly killed me [Murphy] because it was so beyond our resources; we were pushing these boundaries. I remember I was crying in the dressing room. We were exhausted but we had to do it.\"\n\nWith Fredrikson as his designer, Murphy went on to choreograph his versions of the Ballets Russes repertoire, Schéhérazade, Daphnis and Chloé, The Late Afternoon of a Faun and After Venice, the last based on Thomas Mann's novella Death in Venice, which ends with the death of the main character, Aschenbach. Diaghilev, like Aschenbach, died in Venice.\n\nThroughout the 1980s and 1990s, the Fredrikson–Murphy team created eight more works for the Sydney Dance Company, three for the Australian Ballet and one for Opera Australia. Both Murphy and Fredrikson worked independently with the Australian Ballet, but of the two, Murphy had the longest connection. His choreographic work for the company covered five decades.\n\nIn 1982 he applied for the job of artistic director of the Australian Ballet, but instead the majority of the company's directors chose Maina Gielgud, the London-born freelance dancer and teacher. During her directorship, she asked Murphy to choreograph a new production of Nutcracker. He was reluctant at first, but with Fredrikson again at his side, the ballet turned out to be a masterpiece.\n\nHelpmann's last Checkmate\n\nA heavy smoker all his life, Helpmann was suffering from emphysema and admitted to hospital when, in 1986, Gielgud and ballet master Colin Peasley came to see him with some good news. Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, had given the Australian Ballet something for nothing. De Valois' gift was her 1937 ballet, Checkmate, in which Helpmann had created the role of the Red King at its premiere.\n\nPeasley remembers it was Gielgud's idea that they would break the news to Helpmann by his hospital bed. \"It will make his day', she assured Peasley. The response wasn't quite what they expected when Gielgud told Helpmann that \"Ninette's given us Checkmate in your honour'. Helpmann replied, \"Wonderful! I'm still capable of doing it!'\n\nPeasley remembered how \"Maina looked at me and I looked at Maina, and I thought, 'we've got ourselves into something here!' But he fixed himself up to do the production and he did every performance. And, as old and sick and frail as he was, he still overpowered the stage.\"\n\nPeasley, the understudy for the Sydney season, said Helpmann did \"every bloody performance. I think he wanted to die on stage!\"\n\nAs ballet master, it was Peasley's duty to make sure everyone was present and correct before the show. \"One evening, I knocked on the door of Bobby's dressing room and there was no answer. I thought, 'this is strange, he didn't look good last night, he looked grey, but he would have rung me [if there was anything wrong].' Knock, knock again. The doors are thick; I thought he probably didn't hear me. So I pushed the door open and there down the end of the dressing room, in a chair, was Bobby, like this. [Peasley mimed a lifeless body.] I went, \"Oh!' And he said, \"Fooled you that time, didn't I!\"\n\nAfter the Sydney season, Helpmann returned to hospital but was up and about once more for the Melbourne season in July. Then came the final curtain. On 28 September 1986, Helpmann died at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital. His ashes were scattered on the sea at Waikiki.\n\nAn edited extract from Dancing Under The Southern Skies by Valerie Lawson, published by Australian Scholarly Publishing."
