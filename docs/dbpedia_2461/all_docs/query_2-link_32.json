        "text": "RAAC White Metal Rising Sun Badges.\n\nG'day all\n\nOver a period there has been on going discussion on white metal rising sun badges.\n\nLast night I was re reading part of the 2010 edition of Ironsides, The Journal of the Royal Australian Armoured Corps. In a discussion relating to the banning of the wearing of berets in the Australian Army I came across a letter from Brig R.J.H. Noble,DSC, CSC, Head of Corps, addressed to the then Chief of Army Lt. Gen. Ken Gillespie AO, DSC, CSM. This letter states in part that,\"the black beret was formally adopted as the Corps order of dress on 3 Aug 1944 or March 1945 (depending on which source you quote).\n\nThe letter quotes in part a letter from General Hopkins that deals with the black beret and its predecessor the khaki beret.\n\nIn part Gen Hopkins letter states\n\n\"(b) The black beret is the traditional head-dress of the Royal Armoured Corps and it is desirable that Aust Armd Corps be similarly dressed.\"\n\n\"The black beret was strictly Royal Tank Corps and NOT Royal Amd Corps. however the change from khaki to black beret was approved by the CGS (Lt. Gen. J Northcott) on 3 Aug 1944.\"\n\nIt further states\n\n\"Shortly afterwards, the Commander, 4 Aust armd Bde (Brig adier D Macarthur Onslow)recommended that a chromium plated Commonwealthhat badge be worn by Armoured Corps Personnel on the black beret instead of the ordinary copper oxydised badge. This, he said, wouldgive the Corps a distinctive badge which would also serve as a linkwith the other ArmdCorps of the British Commonwealthforces which all wore a silvered badge. It would greatly forter esprit-de-corps and could be done in 4 Armd bde Workshops without cost. Whatever the the decidinfg factor, the proposal was approved in February 1945.\""
