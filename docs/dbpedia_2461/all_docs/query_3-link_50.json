        "text": "Prominent Australians, including author Tim Winton and late comedian Barry Humphries, are among those who have been appointed to the Order of Australia.\n\nThis was the first year women outnumbered men on the King's Birthday honours list, which included entertainers, artists, Indigenous elders, scientists, environmentalists and other notable Australians.\n\nThe appointments were announced on Sunday night, a day before the public holiday for King Charles's first birthday as monarch.\n\nBarry Humphries's enduring legacy\n\nThe late Barry Humphries, known best for his character Dame Edna, was made a companion of the Order of Australia (AC) — the highest of the honours, bestowed on only six Australians.\n\nHumphries died in April this year, aged 89, after entertaining the country for decades with his colourful characters.\n\nLate in his life, he became a controversial figure because of his views regarding the transgender community, having described gender reassignment surgery as \"self-mutilation\" in 2016.\n\nFor Humphries's relatives, dealing with the death of a family member who was also a public figure has been challenging.\n\nAfter Penelope Johnson heard her uncle had died, it was not long before every television channel was broadcasting pictures of Humphries and the news of his death.\n\n\"On one level that was exhilarating, seeing all the love and the grieving that the nation was doing,\" she said.\n\n\"But it was also quite difficult.\n\n\"There was a sense of, 'Oh, this isn't private for us anymore. This has become very public.'\"\n\nMs Johnson said Humphries would have been proud to receive the highest honour in the Order of Australia.\n\nHumphries's sister, Barbara Johnson, said her brother was an entertainer since childhood.\n\n\"There was never a dull moment, really,\" she said.\n\n\"When he was little, he always said, 'I want to be famous,'\" she said.\n\nMs Johnson said Humphries had more to give, and would have continued performing to the last moment.\n\n\"Probably forever until he died, actually, which he did.\"\n\nTaking Aboriginal languages around the world\n\nDarwin-based Shellie Morris, one of Australia's most recognisable Indigenous singer-songwriters, was appointed an officer of the Order of Australia (AO) for her contributions to music and Aboriginal communities.\n\nAfter being raised by an adopted family in Sydney, she moved to the territory as a young woman where she learnt to sing in 20 Aboriginal languages.\n\n\"It's changed my personality dramatically, finding my culture and my languages,\" she said.\n\nHer inclusion on the King's honour list was something Morris had to reckon with, given the honours' ties to the head of the colony.\n\n\"But to be notable for the things that I'm doing, that's the most important thing,\" she said.\n\n\"The singing around the world in languages from here — the journey of that — and working in over 70 remote communities.\n\nTim Winton's environmental and literary career\n\nWest Australian author Tim Winton was appointed an AO for his literary and environmental work.\n\nThe author's depictions of Australian landscapes, and his books such as Cloudstreet and Breath, were prominent features of many Australians' teenage and later years.\n\n\"It's a great privilege I think to be recognised by your own country people and it's nice to be thought of as worthy,\" he said.\n\n\"To think that you've been doing your thing for 40 years and to get a kind of an accolade that's sort of beyond the professional, it does make you think, well, I've been around a while and maybe I've had some impact and hopefully a positive impact.\"\n\nWinton has also made a name for himself in the environmental advocacy space, defending reefs, criticising the fossil fuel industry and campaigning against shark finning.\n\nHe said Australia's natural beauty still inspired him.\n\n\"I write about our places because they're beautiful and they're precious,\" Winton said.\n\n\"I've defended them for the same reason.\n\nHe recently wrote and narrated an ABC documentary series, Ningaloo Nyinggulu, about the biodiversity and beauty of the Ningaloo area in north-west Western Australia.\n\nMatildas star recognised for gender advocacy\n\nDespite being widely regarded as one of the most influential Australians in women's football, being recognised as an AO came as a surprise to former Matildas vice-captain Moya Dodd.\n\nDodd, who played in the first-ever FIFA world tournament for women in 1988 — the precursor to the first Women's World Cup – described what would now be considered a shocking offer to represent Australia.\n\n\"I remember being selected [to play for the Matildas in China] and then being told how much it would cost,\" she said.\n\n\"It was going to cost $850, and they let me pay in two instalments because at the time … I was earning about 300 bucks a week.\"\n\nIn retirement, she became one of the first three women appointed to the governing body, FIFA, in the organisation's 108-year history. She was known for using her position to advocate for positive change for women.\n\nShe views her inclusion on the King's Birthday honours list as a testament to the nation that accepted a kid born to a fireman and a Chinese Seventh Day Adventist.\n\n\"I think it's a tribute to Australia and Australian society … that people who might not think they're part of the mainstream, or certainly not part of the establishment, can have a go and have a fair go in this country,\" she said.\n\nSydney politician's daring policy changes\n\nSydney's longest-serving lord mayor, Clover Moore, has been appointed as an AO for her service to local government and the New South Wales parliament.\n\nMs Moore was elected to lead the City of Sydney in 2004, having worked as a state MP since the late 1980s. She served in both the council and parliament until 2012, when a state law made it illegal to hold both roles.\n\nA republican, Ms Moore is known for her progressive policies. She was integral to setting up the safe injecting room at Kings Cross, outlawing homosexual vilification, and transforming the CBD with bike lanes and light rail.\n\n\"A lot of what I've done seemed to have been controversial at the start,\" Ms Moore said.\n\n\"Some elements of the parliament and some elements of the media really had a good go at me. But I believed in our work.\n\nHelping teenagers build mental resilience\n\nCody Schaeffer, 29, is a Quandamooka man and the youngest person to receive a medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) this year.\n\nAfter struggling with mental health issues growing up in the regional Queensland town of Goondiwindi, Mr Schaeffer created Borderline Australia in 2019.\n\nThe non-profit organisation has provided free youth camps and online courses to thousands of disadvantaged young people, teaching them coping mechanisms to deal with their mental health battles.\n\n\"We don't want to be here to fix you, we don't want to be here to tell you exactly what to do, we want to help guide you and listen to you.\"\n\nMr Shaeffer, who now lives in Brisbane, said it was \"such a cool feeling\" to be recognised for such rewarding work.\n\n\"I still to this day cannot get my head around it,\" he said.\n\nTeaching the community that anyone can sing\n\nBrisbane-based Astrid Jorgensen had an innovative idea in 2017: a choir for singers of all abilities, held in a pub.\n\nSix years later, she has been made an OAM for creating a movement that allows everyone to sing.\n\nNow, Pub Choir's monthly events are held in bigger venues to accommodate thousands of attendees, who are coached by Ms Jorgensen in singing together.\n\n\"By the end of the show, the audience becomes the performer — they're transformed,\" she said.\n\n\"Music doesn't need to be so stressful and so complicated. It actually is just about participating. And when you come to Pub Choir, you just have to try your best.\n\nLater this year, Ms Jorgensen and Pub Choir will tour the US and the UK.\n\nLeaving a mark on the Australian honey industry\n\nKnown as \"Tasmania's biggest beekeeper\", Lindsay Bourke was recognised with an AM for his contributions to the Australian honey industry.\n\nThe president of the Tasmanian Beekeeping Association started collecting hives as a hobby and a way to make a bit of money to buy a home. Now, honey is his life.\n\n\"And I'll tell you what, you can never let it go.\n\n\"We had 200 hives in the old days. Now I've got over 3,000.\"\n\nThe hives are located in Tasmania's picturesque rainforests, where Mr Bourke produces leatherwood and manuka honey.\n\nLast month, the Launceston beekeeper won a years-long fight for Australian producers to be able to use the Manuka honey label, after New Zealand fought to trademark the Māori name.\n\nAnd only last week, his leatherwood honey was recognised as the world's best.\n\nMr Bourke said he was \"proud\" to be recognised on the honours list and to put AM after his name.\n\n\"Life's great, I love it,\" he said.\n\n\"I can't wait to get up the next day.\"\n\nGiving Canberra's Ghanaian community a voice\n\nBeing made an OAM was a shock for Ebenezer Banful, who suspects one of his children nominated him for the appointment.\n\n\"I believe it could be my one of my daughters or something, but nobody's telling me,\" he said.\n\nHe was recognised for his services to African communities and health around Canberra, having been involved in various associations for migrants, refugees, and Ghanaian Australians.\n\nFeeling isolated when he arrived in the nation's capital, he wanted to create a space for the Ghanaian community so other new arrivals would not go through the problems he faced alone.\n\n\"We also realised that if we were to come together, we have a good voice to make some things happen,\" he said.\n\nMr Banful has delivered a radio program, Radio Ghana, for the past 15 years for the Canberra-Ghanaian community, featuring Ghanaian news, music and culture.\n\n\"The radio program is an education program, which goes out every Saturday, informing the people and telling the people,\" he said.\n\n\"These are things to give back to the community. That's the way I saw it.\"\n\nChanging attitudes to drug use and addiction\n\nWhen the HIV epidemic was taking hold in South Australia, doctor Robert Ali introduced a needle exchange program to help intravenous drug users avoid the disease.\n\nIn Vietnam during the war, he introduced methadone treatments — an opioid replacement therapy — and drug addiction counselling.\n\n\"There was no previous training course or curriculum, so we developed the curriculum,\" he said.\n\nDr Ali's life-saving work in the addiction space has now led to him being appointed as an AO.\n\n\"It's a moment that is quite humbling,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm doing what I think needs to be done.\n\nHe said society's stigmatisation of drug users, including by medical professionals, often left people at risk of overdose and isolation.\n\n\"Often you'll find with stigma of drug use, the [medical] practices don't want those kind of people in their practices,\" he said.\n\n\"They are members of the community, and deserve and should be treated with respect.\""
