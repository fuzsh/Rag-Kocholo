        "text": "By Lirio da Fonseca\n\nDILI, May 24 (Reuters) - Australian and New Zealand troops will arrive in East Timor soon to maintain order in the country, racked by violence in past weeks, the tiny nation's foreign minister said on Wednesday.\n\n\"We have asked help from Australia, New Zealand, Portugal and Malaysia. Australia and New Zealand will come soon,\" Jose Ramos-Horta told reporters after meeting foreign diplomats.\n\nIn Lisbon, Portugal said it was sending 120 military police to help in the security effort.\n\nShooting between a group of rebel military policemen led by an Australian-trained major and loyal government troops killed at least one person and wounded six in East Timor on Tuesday.\n\nThere was fresh fighting on Wednesday and the government in a statement again blamed \"the breakaway, renegade elements\" for stirring the trouble.\n\nReinaldo and his men left their station last month to support the plight of the more than 500 soldiers sacked by the cash-strapped East Timor government earlier in April.\n\nThe sackings prompted demonstrations joined by people the government says have broader motives.\n\nAustralia's acting Prime Minister Peter Costello said Canberra received a formal written request for help from East Timor late on Wednesday and had agreed to send troops, subject to final negotiations on details of the deployment. He said the Vice Chief of Australia's Defence Force, Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie, would go to East Timor on Thursday to finalise details of the deployment.\n\nCostello said the Australian troop carrier HMAS and Manoora and the transport ship HMAS Tobruk had already left the northern port of Townsville. The troop carrier HMAS Kanimbla would also be deployed.\n\nAUSTRALIAN FORCES READY BY THURSDAY\n\nDefence Minister Brendan Nelson said Australian forces could arrive in East Timor as early as Thursday afternoon if the conditions can be agreed.\n\nHe said Australia has pre-deployed a battalion group of between 1,000 and 1,300 troops.\n\nAustralia led a U.N.-backed intervention force to East Timor in 1999 to quell violence by pro-Indonesian militias after East Timorese voted for independence from Jakarta. An estimated 1,000 people died in the violence.\n\nIndonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and declared it an Indonesian province in 1976, following centuries of Portuguese control.\n\nU.N. peacekeepers left a year ago and the U.N. mission of 130 administrators, police and military advisers was scheduled to finish in East Timor on May 20, but was extended for a month after the recent riots.\n\nRamos-Horta told the Australian Broadcasting Corp the foreign forces might not engage in any hostility but were needed to give \"an immediate calming effect throughout the country\" and \"encourage political dialogue\".\n\n\"I do not believe that we are close to civil war,\" he said.\n\nFive people were killed and thousands of East Timorese fled their homes when protests by the disgruntled soldiers initially turned violent late last month. Protesters burned cars, threw rocks at police and officers fired into the crowd. (Additional reporting by James Grubel in Canberra)"
