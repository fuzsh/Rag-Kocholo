        "text": "Synopsis\n\nTata is an ardent supporter of the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement\n\nRatan Tata was recently awarded the Order of Australia, the highest civil honor in that country.\n\nThe executive chairman of Tata & Sons was honoured for his outstanding contribution to fostering ties between India and Australia, especially in areas such as trade, business, and philanthropy.\n\nBarry ‘O’ Farrell, who is Australia’s High Commissioner to India, shared some pictures from the ceremony and revealed that although Tata is a “titan” in the field of business, he has created a lasting impact in the business community and start-up ecosystem in Australia as well.\n\n“Ratan Tata is a titan of biz, industry, and philanthropy not just in India, but his contributions have also made a significant impact in Australia,\" he wrote on Twitter. He also added that he was very happy to bestow the AO (Order of Australia) to Tata and lauded his extensive efforts to strengthen the ties between India and Australia. “Delighted to confer Order of Australia (AO) honour to Ratan Tata in recognition of his longstanding commitment to the Australian and Indian relationship,” tweeted the Australian High Commissioner. The tweet became viral on the microblogging platform with more than 282K views and 6,530 likes.\n\nOne Twitter user wrote, “Ratan Tata is an institution himself. A pride of our incredible country, India. He is a huge inspiration for generations to come. A perfectly deserved recognition.”\n\nThe business magnate has been a firm advocate for fostering strong economic-cultural bonds between the two countries. He is an ardent supporter of the India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement, which came into effect in 2022. The Australian branch of Tata Consultancy, which was established in 1998, has the largest Australian workforce of any Indian firm with about 17,000 employees. TCS Australia also provides IT services to six Australian NGOs completely free of cost.\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2024 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...moreless\n\nThe known and unknown unknowns of Ola Electric IPO\n\nThe Ola Electric story: What makes Bhavish Aggarwal India's most impatient man?\n\nWarren Buffett is selling Apple shares to hold on to cash.
