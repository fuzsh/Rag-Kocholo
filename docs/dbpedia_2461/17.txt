A beret-wearing cook, an army chief, the last of the tent boxing showmen and a winemaker who might have denied us the pleasure of cask wine are among those honoured this Australia Day.

There are well-known faces including long-term federal Treasurer Peter Costello and respected Chief of the Army Ken Gillespie, who've both been appointed Companions in the Order of Australia.

Ian Parmenter's signature "bon appetit" sign-off became common speak for the thousands of Australians who got hooked on his five-minute cooking shows Consuming Passions.

The London-born ex-journalist and TV producer says he had no credentials for a presenting job let alone one involving cooking when he was approached to front the show in the early 1990s.

And he considers being awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia a huge surprise.

John Angove has received the honours' nod for his accomplishments in wine but almost thwarted his father's plans to introduce cask wine, telling him Australians would find it unpalatable.

And Fred Brophy, a legend in the receding world of tent boxing, has also been honoured with a Medal of the Order of Australia.
