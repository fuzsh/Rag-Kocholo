        "text": "(born 1956). Czech-born U.S. tennis champion Martina Navratilova was a leading competitor in the open era of tennis. She won a million-dollar Grand Slam bonus in 1984. Under a temporary rule change, players became eligible for the bonus by winning the four Grand Slam victories in succession, rather than in a season. After winning the United States and Australian opens in 1983, Navratilova qualified for the special prize by taking Wimbledon and the French Open the next year.\n\nNavratilova was born in Prague on October 18, 1956. Ranked number one in Czechoslovakia from 1972 to 1975, she achieved international prominence as the leader of the Czech team that won the 1975 Federation Cup. Afterward she defected to the United States and became a citizen in 1981.\n\nIn 1979 Navratilova was ranked top woman tennis player in the world, a ranking she achieved again in 1982 and maintained through 1986. A left-handed player, she amassed a remarkable record of wins in both singles and doubles. In 1983 her ratio of wins to losses—86 to 1—set a new record for percentage of wins. In 1987 Navratilova won her fourth United States Open singles and her ninth Wimbledon crown.\n\nOne of Navratilova’s frequent opponents on the court was Chris Evert. Until Evert’s retirement in 1990, their contrasting styles of play made them great crowd pleasers. In late 1991 Navratilova broke her longtime rival’s career record of 1,309 match victories and 157 tournament titles. On winning her 158th title in 1992 in Chicago, Navratilova had accumulated more championships than any other player, male or female, in the history of tennis. She retired from singles play after the 1994 season, having won 167 titles in all.\n\nOver the next two years Navratilova competed in only a handful of doubles events, and from 1997 to 1999 she did not play on tour. In 2000, however, she returned to professional play, competing in the doubles event at several tournaments, including Wimbledon. That same year she was inducted into the Tennis Hall of Fame. In 2003 she won the mixed doubles (with Leander Paes) at Wimbledon to tie Billie Jean King for most Wimbledon titles overall (20). With the victory, Navratilova, age 46, also became the oldest player to win at Wimbledon. After winning the mixed doubles at the U.S. Open in 2006, she retired from competitive play. Her career totals include 59 Grand Slam titles: 18 singles, 31 doubles, and 10 mixed doubles.\n\nNavratilova’s autobiography, Martina (written with George Vecsey), was published in 1985. She also wrote, with Liz Nickles, a series of mysteries centered on the character Jordan Myles, a former tennis champion turned sleuth. The Total Zone (1994) was followed by Breaking Point (1996) and Killer Instinct (1997)."
