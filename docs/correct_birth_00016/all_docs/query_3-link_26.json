        "text": "Navratilova offers audiences thoughts about what it takes to be a champion, and setting and achieving goals. Navratilova knows what it means to be the best; escaping an oppressive regime in 1970s Czechoslovakia was a major step towards “the rest of her life.” Escaping to America, she has achieved success and learned what it means to overcome barricades. She tries to show her audiences what they can do to be the best in whatever field(s) they choose.\n\nOther topics include redefining aging as a baby boomer, healthy lifestyle and fitness, and overcoming adversity. As a tennis player and top athlete, Navratilova knows a thing or two about staying active. In her eyes, a person’s health is not something to be trifled with, and she tells her audiences what they can do to stay in tip-top shape.\n\nNavratilova is also one of the first professional athletes to come out as gay in the 1980s. Overcoming adversity and prejudice is something she understands all too well, but allowing hate to get in the way is exactly how one falls, and Navratilova speaks about how people can surpass the obstacles and oppression they face in life.\n\nLastly, Navratilova speaks about human rights and equality. As an active fighter for the rights of women and gays around the world, she believes no one should be kept down or discriminated against because of their race, gender, or sexual orientation. Today, she works hard to make sure everyone has an equal shot in life.\n\nSuggested Speaking Topics:\n\nWhat It Takes to Become a Champion\n\nSetting and Achieving Goals\n\nRedefining Aging as a Baby Boomer\n\nHealthy Lifestyle and Fitness\n\nOvercoming Adversity\n\nHuman Rights and Equality"
