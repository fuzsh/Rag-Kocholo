        "text": "Navratilova still holds the record for the most number of Wimbledon singles titles which none of the new-age tennis players has been able to match. Named after Navratilova herself, Martina Hingis also proved to be one of the greatest players of the same era, with four major titles in one year (1998). With 7 Wimbledon singles titles to her name, Steffi Graf gave great competition to her counterparts in the sport. Last but not least on this glorious list is Gabriela Sabatini, who has given tough competition to Steffi Graf throughout her tennis career.\n\nMartina Navratilova\n\nMartina Navratilova is one of the biggest names in tennis and in the history of Wimbledon for holding some of the most significant records to her name. She is, to date, the player with the most singles titles in Wimbledon (9). No one, not even Federer or Nadal, has been able to match the record. She also holds the record for most grand slam titles (59), most singles titles in the open era (167) and most doubles titles in the forthcoming period (177). In an age when women were still fighting for their right to equal pay in the field of sports, Navratilova showed that women don't deserve anything less. She is also one of the only three people to complete a career box set. She loved her great game and terrific fitness regime; Navratilova has inspired more people than ever imagined.\n\nSteffi Graf\n\nBorn in 1969, Steffi Graf is ranked 1 for the most number of weeks (377) in her tennis career. This incredible woman is the only person in the history of tennis to win all four grand slams and one Olympic medal in the same year and the only person to win all four grand slams in the same year in the Open Era. During her tennis career and even today, she is loved by fans for turning most of her tournaments into a one-woman show. She has won 107 titles in her career, just a few numbers below Martina Navratilova (167). With her 7 Wimbledon singles titles, she lies right below Navratilova in the number of women's singles titles in Wimbledon. She will be forever remembered and praised for her incredible forehand and her impressive list of victories.\n\nMartina Hingis\n\nIt is a beautiful coincidence that Martina Hingis is also a part of the same list as her namesake, Martina Navratilova. Named after the tennis diva Navratilova, Hingis also turned out to be as incredible as her. Hingis gained fame at an extremely young age when she became the youngest player to win a major title by winning the doubles title in Wimbledon at the age of 15 years. It is even more incredible that she still holds the title. In 1997, Hingis also rose to rank 1, becoming the youngest player to hold that position. The same year, she also won a Wimbledon singles title to be the youngest to win the title after Lottie Dod (1887). Hingis was born to be a star known for winning matches in straight sets. Being one of the youngest women to enter the senior circuit and win grand slam titles, Hingis' name will always be written in Tennis history in golden letters.\n\nGabriela Sabatini\n\nAnother one of the divas of the era, Gabriela spent her entire career in the top 10 in the tennis circuit. She came close to winning a Wimbledon title in 1991 but was defeated in the finals by Steffi Graf. Though in 1988, she was defeated by Steffi Graf in both the summer Olympics and the US Open, she has always appreciated her incredible game. Subsequently, she defeated Graf in the 1990 US Open to win her first Grand Slam title, moving to rank 1. Gabriela spent her entire under-12 and junior career on rank one and entered the senior circuit pretty early. She retired from tennis in 1997 to run her perfume business."
