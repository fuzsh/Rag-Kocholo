        "text": "This year instead of mentoring a single team at iGEM, I will be mentoring the teams globally as an Entrepreneurship Mentor. For any team participating in the iGEM competition, and wanting to learn if your idea is scalable into a full-fledged startup, how to decipher the solution's viability beyond the bench, do customer discovery, derisk, and fundraise, write to me. If you are a current team, you should have my email in the last iGEM newsletter or please feel free to message me here. I am excited about the bio-economy and can't wait to hear from all of you building! #biotech #iGEM #Bioeconomy #startups #venturecapital #syntheticbiology #entrepreneurship #iGEM2024.\n\nWhile attending the \"SF DeepTech Week\" last weekend, I felt that one of the biggest reasons \"Biotech\" is not as mainstream and funded is because despite all the startup and momentum around getting more ideas funded, it still isn't divergent from the \"ivory towers of academia\". We the people who build and want to make this the \"Era of Biotechnology\" have a lot of work to do even outside what we are building, to make it accessible with a level at par to the availability of a personal computer. I think if we consciously do the following things will change: 1. Lose the attitude and the jargon in the ivory tower and talk in plain language. 2. Make people around us understand it more and more. Talk endlessly if you need to unless someone asks you to stop. Go crazy! 3. Talk beyond therapeutics. While most people think Biotech is all about treating a patient, it is much more and the other areas are never talked about enough. This is the only discipline that has the solution to solve Climate crisis and build the world sustainably. Most people do not know or appreciate this enough. 4. Work towards access. The model will look wildly different from what we saw in tech but until the time we give it to every child and make them tinker, we are not there! This needs a lot of action in building community labs, educating folks for free and helping them work with it. More ideas? Keep them coming in the comments below... . . . . . #biotech #biology #deeptech #climatechange #sanfrancisco #bayarea #syntheticbiology #education.\n\nWhat an event to begin the first ever SF DeepTech Week! Right from the choice of the venue - the historical USS Hornet which has been a part of World War II and to the lunar mission, to the energy of exhibitors building for the world today, it was infectious to say the least. The cyber trucks, robots, plastic repurposing 3D printers to the climate change and energy solutions, all on a grand exhibit. Building beyond software takes courage and this is a celebration of all those who do despite knowing it as all \"pain and suffering\". Being biased I want to see more Biotech here - that is the ultimate frontier for our civilization! Let's build it! Amazing to meet new people building these solutions and catch up with old friends. Great job Andrew Cote Sampriti Bhattacharyya and team. . . . . . . . . #biotech #sfdeeptechweek #deeptech #sanfrancisco #startups #robotics #innovation.\n\nAll of us learn at different rates. I remember most of my colleagues during my PhD program had a very different method of learning and working and yet each one published very original papers. I see a lot of mentors unfortunately judge students too soon, especially those who have alternate ways of working. If you are not in a nurturing environment it's time to leave. It's not worth proving yourself to those whose minds are not open to other possibilities. These lines from none other than Kip Thorne - a Nobel laureate should inspire..... #learning #research #discovery #phd #postdoc #academia.\n\nSome common misconceptions I have noticed amongst students coming as postdocs from other countries to the US about visas. Here are some facts you must know: 1. The choice of visas you are offered will mostly be J1 or H1B ( uncapped). 2. The H1B uncapped cannot be transferred to industry and you will again be in the lottery if you were to find a job in the industry. 3. Unless you have exhausted the above two, you won't be offered an O1 in academia. Your profile has to be very strong before you can secure an O1 even in startups. 4. Spouses can't work as O1 dependents. Ridiculous but true. 5. J1 can be transferred to industry. Very few employers know this and mostly you will have to educate them. Hope it helps. . . . #visas #immigration #phds #postdocs #j1visa #h1bvisa #h1b #h1blottery #biotech."
