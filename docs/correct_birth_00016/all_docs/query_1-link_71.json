        "text": "STAR athlete Martina Navratilova garnered a following for her career in professional tennis.\n\nBesides her pro-tennis fame, the public is curious to know about Martina's personal life.\n\nWho is Martina Navratilova?\n\nBorn on October 18, 1956, Martina Navratilova is a Czechoslovakian-American former tennis player.\n\nMartina rose to fame in the 1970s after winning a number of professional titles in the world of tennis.\n\nShe won her first Grand Slam at the Wimbledon Arena in 1978 by defeating her opponent Chris Evert.\n\nShe took home her ninth Grand Slam victory from the US Open Tennis championship at Wimbledon in 1990.\n\nMartina is also a novelist who published three mystery books with Liz Nickles.\n\nIs Martina married?\n\nAlong with her tennis reputation, Martina's personal romances are the center of conversation for sports fans.\n\nFrom 1979 to 1980, the Grand Slam winner dated novelist Rita Mae Brown.\n\nFollowing their split, Martina moved on to another published author, Judy Nelson - they dated from 1984 to 1991.\n\nOn September 6, 2014, the athlete and Real Housewives of Miami star, Julia Lemigova, announced their engagement.\n\nMartina proposed to the reality TV personality at Arthur Ashe stadium in New York, the location of that year's tennis championships.\n\nThe pro-athlete told People: \"What’s been amazing is the outpouring of support from everywhere, including when I was walking through the stadium afterwards with people saying, ‘Congratulations,’ people on the street saying, ‘Congratulations.'\"\n\n\"The changes in people’s attitudes [on gay marriage] is amazing. You put it out to the world and it already feels like we’re married because the whole world knows.\"\n\nThe couple married two months later on December 15.\n\nWhat is Martina's net worth?\n\nOn July 4, 2006, the tennis star announced her retirement at Wimbledon.\n\nAccording to CNN, she commented: \"I just, you know, want to move on to my next life. Most of all, it's to spend more time at home.\"\n\n\"It wasn't an easy decision because tennis has been my life.\"\n\nMartina added: \"I feel proud of everything I have achieved in a sport that has given me so much.\"\n\n\"There have been many years of sacrifice and there have been some hard times, but that will all be forgotten and in the end, I will remember the successes and the good times.\"\n\n\"It's difficult to find the motivation after so many years at the top.\"\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, she amassed a fortune of an estimated $25million.\n\nMartina is the holder of 18 Grand Slam titles and 31 major women's doubles titles."
