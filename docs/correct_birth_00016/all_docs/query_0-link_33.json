        "text": "Tennis legend Martina Navrátilová announced on Tuesday she had regained Czech citizenship more than 30 years after fleeing communist Czechoslovakia to make a new home in the United States. The 51-year-old former world champion said during a press conference in Tokyo that she had officially regained her Czech citizenship in January of this year. She has decided to maintain dual citizenship and keep her US passport. Born in Prague, Navrátilová fled to the United States in 1975 at the height of the Cold War and was subsequently stripped of her Czech citizenship by the communist regime. She became a US citizen six years later."
