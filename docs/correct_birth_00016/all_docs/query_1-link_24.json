        "text": "The dominant women’s tennis player of her time, Martina Navratilova won every Grand Slam singles title at least twice: Wimbledon (a record nine times), the Australian Open (three), the French Open (two) and the U.S. Open (four). Left-handed, sinewy and athletic, she helped bring a new era of power into the traditionally more finesse-minded women’s game. Her many matches with former world #1 Chris Evert were particularly famous (with young Tracy Austin in the mix, 1979-81). Navratilova retired from professional tennis in 1994, but in 2000 returned to occasional action in mixed doubles and then women’s doubles. By winning the mixed doubles title at the 2003 Australian Open (with Leander Paes of India) she became the first player since Margaret Court to win the singles, doubles and mixed doubles at all four grand slam tournaments."
