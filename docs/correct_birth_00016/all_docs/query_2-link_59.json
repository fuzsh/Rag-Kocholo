        "text": "Martina Mariea McBride (n√©e Schiff, born July 29, 1966) is an American country music singer-songwriter and record producer. She is known for her soprano singing range and her country pop material. McBride signed to RCA Records in 1991, and made her debut the following year as a neo-traditionalist country singer with the single, \"The Time Has Come\". Over time, she developed a pop-styled crossover sound, similar to Shania Twain and Faith Hill, and had a string of major hit singles on the Billboard country chart and occasionally on the adult contemporary chart. Five of these singles went to No. 1 on the country chart between 1995 and 2001, and one peaked at No. 1 on the adult contemporary chart in 2003. She is called the \"Celine Dion of Country Music\" after she was recognized for her soprano singing range. McBride has thirteen studio albums, two greatest hits compilations, one \"live\" album, as well as two additional compilation albums. Eight of her studio albums and two of her compilations have an RIAA Gold certification, or higher. In the U.S., she has over 14 million albums. In addition, McBride has the Country Music Association's \"Female Vocalist of the Year\" award four times (tied with Reba McEntire for the second-most wins) and the Academy of Country Music's \"Top Female Vocalist\" award three times. She is also a 14-time Grammy Award nominee.\n\nMartina Navratilova (born October 18, 1956) is a Czechoslovak-born American former professional tennis player and coach. Navratilova was world No. 1 for a total of 332 weeks in singles, and a record 237 weeks in doubles, making her the only player in history to have held the top spot in both singles and doubles for over 200 weeks. She was year-end singles No. 1 seven times, including a record of five consecutive years, as well as year-end doubles No. 1 five times, including three consecutive years during which she held the ranking for the entire year. She won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, 31 major women's doubles titles (an all-time record), and 10 major mixed doubles titles, combined marking the open-era record for the most number of Grand Slam titles won by one player, male or female."
