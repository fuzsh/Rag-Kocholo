        "text": "Navratilova was born on October 18, 1956, in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). She began playing tennis at the age of four and competed in her first tennis tournament when she was eight. In 1972, at the age of 15, she became the number-one player in Czechoslovakia after she won the national tennis championship. Navratilova retained that rank until 1975 when she moved to the United States. The Czechoslovak government was not fully supportive of her career, so she did not return to the country. The government took away her citizenship, and Navratilova became a U.S. citizen in 1981. She regained her Czech citizenship in 2008 and became a dual citizen.\n\nFrom 1975 Navratilova was regularly one of the top five women tennis players. She became the number-one female tennis player in the world in 1978. The following year she won the Wimbledon women’s singles as well as the women’s doubles titles. She continued to dominate in the 1980s. In 1987 Navratilova became the first person to win the singles, doubles, and mixed doubles championships at the U.S. Open since 1970. By 1990 she had won the women’s singles titles at two French Opens, three Australian Opens, four U.S. Opens, and a record nine times at Wimbledon.\n\nNavratilova retired from singles play after the 1994 season. She had won 167 singles titles. She continued to compete in doubles play. In 2003 she became the oldest player to win at Wimbledon after she and her partner won the mixed doubles title. That was also her 20th Wimbledon title, which tied her with Billie Jean King for most Wimbledon titles. Navratilova retired from competitive play in 2006.\n\nNavratilova was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2000. Her autobiography, Martina (written with George Vecsey), was published in 1985. She also wrote, with Liz Nickles, a series of mysteries. The series features the character Jordan Myles, a former tennis champion turned detective. The series consists of three books: The Total Zone (1994), Breaking Point (1996), and Killer Instinct (1997). Navratilova continues to be involved with tennis as she works as a commentator for radio and television during tournaments. She has also been a strong supporter of gay rights and of equal rights for all."
