        "text": "Julia Lemigova’s wife, Martina Navratilova, is tennis royalty. The Real Housewives of Miami spouse has won a record-breaking nine Wimbledon Ladies Singles Championships. But this year, Martina took a break from the court and watched the famous tournament from the stands, where she and Julia were joined by a different type of royalty.\n\nJulia Lemigova, Martina Navratilova & Kate Middleton at Wimbledon 2023\n\nIn a photo from the legendary London event, Julia and Martina are seen with a very regal seatmate. The photo shows Julia smiling at none other than Kate Middleton, who is seated next to Martina in the photo below and facing Julia. (You can just make out the Princess of Wales’ signature twisted coif.)\n\nThis isn’t the first time Julia has had the opportunity to mingle with Kate. Back in 2019, she and Martina sat behind the princess and her sister-in-law, Meghan Markle, at Wimbledon. In the clip above, Julia dishes on the experience during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\n\nDuring a round of admittedly shady questions posed to Julia and Martina, they were asked if they sensed “any tension between Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle ... at Wimbledon in 2019.”\n\n“Not at all,” Julia says in the above video. “No, we talked about my nine puppies, which were born while having lunch watching the Wimbledon finals, before the finals. Can you imagine? They were born just there, and that was our conversation, about the little puppies.”\n\nMeanwhile, this year, Julia was seated directly beside Sue Barker, who is a former tennis pro and British TV presenter.\n\nWhen the RHOM cast member shared an image from Wimbledon on her Instagram feed, she summed up the situation neatly. “Talking to the royalty in the royal box,” she wrote, adding a tennis-ball emoji for good measure.\n\nMajor celebrities attend Wimbledon 2023\n\nReportedly, the royal box was filled with several other tennis icons and celebrities this year. The Daily Mail reported that the box’s illustrious guest list included Billie Jean King, Issa Rae, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Priyanka Chopra, Nick Jonas, Andrew Garfield, and several other stars of the court and the screen.\n\nMartina Navratilova is a tennis legend\n\nBut of course, Julia was most starry-eyed for one tennis great in particular — and it’s one who is very dear to her heart. While at Wimbledon, the RHOM cast member snapped a sweet selfie of herself with her wife and illustrated it with a pink heart emoji.\n\nShe also captured a photo of Martina’s impressive array of championship titles, recorded on a wall. “Magic 9 times,” Julia wrote.\n\nThe Real Housewives of Miami Season 5 airs on Bravo on Wednesdays at 9/8c. RHOM Season 5 premiered on Peacock back in December and fans can also stream the series on Peacock."
