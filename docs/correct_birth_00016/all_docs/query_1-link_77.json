        "text": "Martina Navratilova is a retired Czech-American tennis player who was born on October 18, 1956, in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic). Navratilova is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players of all time, and she is also known for her activism and advocacy for LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nNavratilova won a total of 59 Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles, and mixed doubles, including 18 Grand Slam singles titles, 31 Grand Slam women’s doubles titles, and 10 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles. Navratilova was particularly dominant on grass courts, winning nine Wimbledon singles titles and seven Wimbledon women’s doubles titles.\n\nNavratilova’s success on the court was driven by her exceptional athleticism, her strong serve-and-volley game, and her relentless work ethic. She was known for her aggressive style of play and her ability to dictate points from the baseline.\n\nOff the court, Navratilova has been a vocal advocate for LGBTQ+ rights and has worked to promote equality and inclusion in sports. She came out as a lesbian in 1981, becoming one of the first openly gay athletes in professional sports. Navratilova has also been involved in a number of philanthropic and humanitarian causes, including animal welfare and cancer research.\n\nNavratilova’s legacy in the sport of tennis is profound, and she is remembered as a trailblazer and role model for generations of players and fans. She continues to be involved in the tennis world as a commentator and analyst for major tournaments."
