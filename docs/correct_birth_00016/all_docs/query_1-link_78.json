        "text": "Martina Navratilova is a former tennis player who is widely regarded as one of the best tennis players of all time. The Czech American, who holds numerous records in the game including the record for the most singles and doubles titles in Open Era history and consecutive years in the top 10 in the world, recorded a record of 18 Slam and 31 major women’s doubles titles to her name.\n\nBiography, Age\n\nMartina Navratilova was born Martina Subertova to Mirek and Jana Subertova on October 18, 1956 in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her father, Mirek, was a ski instructor, while her mother, Jana, was an accomplished gymnast and tennis player, but she was also a ski instructor.\n\nAround the age of three, Navratilova’s parents divorced, and her mother married Miroslav Navratil. His daughter took her stepfather’s surname, but she added the suffix -ova from her old surname to give her the name she bears today. Navratilova’s stepfather was responsible for teaching her how to play the game as he became her very first tennis coach. At the age of around 15, Navratilova won her first amateur tournament, the Czechoslovakia National Tennis Championship in 1972, before turning professional a year later.\n\nIn 1974, Martina Navratilova won her first professional singles title in Orlando. The following year, she reached the final of two major singles tournaments; the Australian Open and the French Open, but only managed the following places. She did, however, team up with Christine Evert, the player who beat her in the French Open final, to win the French Open doubles title, her first major title. The two teamed up again to win the women’s doubles title at Wimbledon in 1976 before Navratilova could win her first solo tournament at Wimbledon in 1978 as she dominated the match for years to come.\n\nThe net worth of Martina Navratilova\n\nMartina Navratilova, according to Celebrity Net’s worth, said she has an estimated net worth of $15 million. The 1.73m (5ft 8in) tall player, recipient of the BBC’s Lifetime Achievement Award for Sports Personality of the Year 2003, was able to earn money from the winnings she has won in tournaments as well as other business ventures including designing tennis wears.\n\nIt has been said that Navratilova’s net worth could have been much more than today if she had not been open about her sexuality which was frowned upon at the time. Despite being one of the most high-profile and successful players of the era, Navratilova was unable to land lucrative endorsement deals because of this. She also lost a huge chunk of her winnings to her former partner, Judy Nelson, who sued her for the right to enjoy palimonia when their relationship ended abruptly.\n\nWho is his wife (partner)?\n\nMartina Navratilova is married to her longtime girlfriend, beauty pageant winner turned model and then businesswoman, Julia Lemigova. The couple started seeing each other in 2006 before getting engaged in September 2004 in the widest possible way. Navratilova proposed to his wife while she was being interviewed at the US Open\n\nThe tennis legend, who has 18 Grand Slam titles to her name revealed that she had thought about it for so long before deciding to do it in the place where she felt most comfortable for the whole world. With everyone at New York’s Arthur Ashe Stadium watching the jumbotron, Navratilova knelt on one knee and unveiled a diamond-set ring to ask for her partner’s hand, which she accepted. Lemigova, mother of two daughters from a previous relationship, and Navratilova tied the knot on December 15, 2014 in a small private ceremony at the Peninsula Hotel in New York City.\n\nJulia Lemigova was born Yulia Alexandrovna Lemigova on June 20, 1972 in the Soviet Union. His father was a colonel in the Red Army. In 1990, Lemigova finished second in the 1990 Miss USSR Beauty Pageant, but was later elevated to winner after the original winner was disqualified for marriage. Lemigova then represented her country in the Miss Universe pageant in 1991 where she managed to finish second. After her pageant career, Lemigova moved to France where she opened a line of wellness, skincare and spa products."
