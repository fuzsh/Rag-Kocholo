        "text": "Widely considered as one of the best female tennis players of all time, Martin Navratilova enjoyed an unprecedented career on the court. From world records in tennis to history-making moments in her personal life, Martina used her platform as a world-renowned sportswoman to advocate for LGBT+ rights, being openly gay herself. At events, Martina shares anecdotes from the glory days, and educates on the importance of equal representation and opportunities across industries.\n\nWith 59 major titles to her name, including 18 Grand Slams and a Career Grand Slam, it’s no wonder Martina holds such a prestigious place in tennis history. Achieving major feats in singles, doubles and mixed doubles Martina’s talents are undeniable and saw her spend a total of 332 weeks as world number one in singles and 237 weeks in doubles, a record for the sport. In total, Martina won 369 career titles over more than 30 years, and expanded the attraction of women’s tennis, inspiring a generation in the process.\n\nAs one of the first openly lesbian international sports stars, Martina has brought attention to LGBT+ rights and greater inclusivity in sports, throughout her career. Much of her profile in the public eye has been dedicated to supporting gay rights charities, advocating for equal rights and bringing representation to an underrepresented group. In 2000 Martina received the National Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign for her work towards inclusion."
