        "text": "Gay task force thanks role model\n\nPROVINCETOWN - Martina Navratilova took time out from the tournaments leading to the U.S. Open in New York - her first in five years - to meet supporters of the National Ga Lesbian Task Force, which held its 14th annual fund-raiser deck party at the Pied Piper Bar and Restaurant yesterday.\n\nThat's how important the cause is to Navratilova, 43, who revealed her homosexuality in 1981.\n\n\"She shares with us not just her talent but her vision for a world with better politics,\" said task force executive director Elizabeth Toledo.\n\nJust returning to professional tennis after a five-year retirement added complications to Navratilova's Provincetown weekend.\n\n\"It's not like I have anything else to do,\" she said, joking.\n\nBut the gesture was not lost on the standing-room-only crowd of supporters who paid $75 a ticket for the two-hour event. To those who watched her win and win again during the 1980s, her presence resonated with the warmth of an esteemed old friend.\n\n\"Every time she stands up, I feel better about myself,\" said Susan Culligan, a board member of the task force. \"Imagine if I had had her as role model when I was a teenager. What she's doing for young people today is incredible.\"\n\nIt's well-known that the Czechoslovakian-born tennis player is lesbian. In 1981, that fact made headlines when a Daily News reporter publicized her sexual preference. Navratilova said her then-girlfriend, another famous person, was (and is) in the closet.\n\nAlso, it was not the kind of publicity many professional tennis players wanted. Just one year before, tennis-great Billy Jean King had been outed by her former lover. With this second leak, the tennis association feared they'd lose their major sponsors. They did not.\n\nBut Navratilova certainly did not become the darling of corporate world.\n\nPuma, her footwear sponsor, and Yonex, her racquet supplier, stood by her, but she said, she did not get any new sponsors for years.\n\nShe held the top-ranking women's position from 1982 to 1987, winning millions in prize money.\n\nBut the limelight and sponsors went to Navratilova's longtime doubles partner and singles rival, Chris Evert.\n\n\"You never saw me on TV until last year with Subaru,\" Navratilova says.\n\nHer coming out was made even more difficult because Navratilova had defected from Czechoslovakia in 1975 and was isolated from her family for many years.\n\nThe American public did not embrace her as an aggressive player, with a powerful, muscular build.\n\nIn person, she is well-toned but a lot smaller than she appeared on the court.\n\n\"I've weighed the same since 1978,\" Navratilova said. \"I've always been a size 8. But the thing is, all the others were petite. Chrissy is a size 4 or 6.\"\n\nNavratilova said it's a lot easier for women now.\n\n\"I had to fight on a lot of fronts,\" she said. \"I had to fight as an aggressive player. I had to fight as a defector. I had to fight because of my physique and then I had to fight as a lesbian.\"\n\nFight she did. Navratilova won 165 singles and 167 doubles titles and earned more than $20 million in prize money by the time she retired in 1994, according to The Associated Press.\n\nA resident of Aspen, Colo., she donates money to AIDS groups, women's and animal rights causes, Culligan said.\n\nThe National Ga Lesbian Task Force, a Washington D.C.-based group, spent the weekend in Provincetown talking about the presidential election and the importance of voting for the Democrats.\n\n\"George W? I don't know,\" Navratilova said. \"I lived in Texas for years. If he wins, we'll go back eight years.\"\n\nThe National Gay And Lesbian Task Force is the oldest national gay-rights group in the country. It works on the state and national level fighting for the rights of gay, lesbians, bisexual and transgendered people."
