        "text": "A very warm welcome to longtime readers and new arrivals.\n\nThis is Christopher Clarey, and it’s time for me to take a deep breath and exhale slowly, just like they teach you to do before you hit a first serve.\n\nThis is a new space and place in my life, and we are off to a very promising start. Substack has named Tennis & Beyond a “Featured Publication”, and we already have thousands of subscribers from 107 countries and 49 U.S. states (come on Alaska!). The tennis community is truly global, which is one of the big reasons the sport has always held my interest as a writer.\n\nFor more than 30 years, I wrote full-time about tennis and global sports for the New York Times and its Paris-based sister publication The International Herald Tribune. It was a dream job, particularly if you can sleep on planes, and it took me to six continents, 14 Olympics, 10 Ryder Cups, nine world track and field championships, six soccer/football World Cups, four America’s Cups and above all, more than 100 Grand Slam tennis tournaments. That means I have literally spent four full years of my life watching tennis balls fly – or not fly – across nets at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and U.S. Open.\n\nEach of us is free to decide whether that is four full years well spent. It certainly has my stamp of approval even if I could have done without Andy Murray’s 4:05 a.m. finish in Melbourne and would also have preferred quite a bit more serve and volley.\n\nShare Christopher Clarey's Tennis & Beyond\n\nBut on balance, I have been a happy sportswriter and a very fortunate man, and now it is time to pursue another dream. The international success of The Master, my best-selling biography of Roger Federer, has given me the opportunity to become a full-time author. I have left the New York Times staff of my own free will with nothing but gratitude to work on my next book, The Warrior, a biography of Rafael Nadal that will explore his mindset and achievements.\n\nAs part of that move, I am pitching my tent on Substack to open a direct connection with you, dear readers. I will continue writing here in large part on tennis, the game I know best, with an emphasis on the Grand Slam tournaments that continue to define players’ careers and legacies. I will offer behind-the-scenes perspective on my books, and as I have throughout my time as a reporter and columnist, I will also write about other themes and sports and provide some windows into my life away from the keyboard. The volume will fluctuate depending on whether I am deep into a manuscript, but the commitment and enthusiasm are real.\n\nThis will be tennis and beyond, and I invite you to join me on the journey by becoming a subscriber or, dare to dream, a paid subscriber, which will give you access to all my posts and material, including voiceovers, and the chance to interact with me about tennis and other topics through the comments section. For now, I am alternating paid and free posts, but the comments section is open only to paid subscribers, and I check in there regularly.\n\nExhale complete. Time to hit the first serve! Thanks for being here.\n\nCC\n\nMore about Christopher Clarey:\n\n*More than 30 years as an award-winning tennis & global sports correspondent for The New York Times & as the chief sports correspondent & columnist for The International Herald Tribune from bases in France, Spain and the U.S..\n\n*Author of The Master, a major biography of Roger Federer that was revised in 2024.
