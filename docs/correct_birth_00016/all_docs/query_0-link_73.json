        "text": "Martina Navratilova won her first singles Grand Slam at Wimbledon in 1978. That began a stretch in which she won 17 out of 37 Grand Slams that included multiple titles in all four events, with particular dominance at the US Open (taking four of five at one point) and especially Wimbledon (winning six straight from 1982-87).\n\nIn all, Navratilova won 59 Grand Slam titles—18 singles, 31 doubles and 10 mixed doubles—which is an Open Era record. She won a record 167 total WTA titles and typically ranks among the greatest women’s players of all-time, along with Steffi Graf, Chris Evert and of course Serena Williams.\n\nNavratilova, now 65, recently became an ambassador for Sense Arena, a Czech Republic-founded virtual reality sports training company that is launching a new tennis product. Born in Prague and raised in Řevnice, nearly 20 miles away, Navratilova said she saw an ad for Sense Arena on television and connected with founder-CEO Bob Tetiva through mutual connections from the Czech Republic.\n\nOn how tennis players can use Sense Arena . . .\n\nI've suggested some drills. I haven’t tried them yet, but in the software, they figured out how to do that. There'll be more, and then we're going to add serving, and really make it the whole package where you can literally play a match. But I think it's great for repetition. If you're in bad weather or you are a little injured, or you’re embarrassed because you’re too old and you don't want to go play tennis—but this is as realistic as it can be.\n\nIf your wrist hurts, you can still hit the hit the ball, but it doesn't actually hit the ball. So then it doesn't bother your wrist or your shoulder, you can still adapt it to your needs. [If there is bad [weather, especially when you're on the grass, and there’s no indoor courts.\n\nOn the skills players can practice . . .\n\nAll of it. Reaction because you can set it for whatever speed you want, or you don't know how fast it’s going to come. Forehand, backhand, it's all about reaction, and it's about repetition. And then you get [to see] what the end result is, so you can fix it. The ball tells you what you did wrong. So you get you get that immediate feedback in the safety of your home.\n\nFor aspiring players, you can work on technique, you can work on strategy. And you get feedback—exactly where the ball landed and whether the way you hit it was correct. So you can fix it. So it's about as realistic as you can get without actually hitting the tennis ball.\n\nOn how this would have helped her as a young player . . .\n\nI played one hour a week when I was growing up because I had to go to Prague to play: one hour a week for four months, five months, whatever. And then I played two hours a week when I was 13, 14 because, again, a trip to Prague and I didn’t have a car. For people that live in the colder climates where you can’t play or it's too expensive to get the indoor court, etc., or, you can’t even get to the courts to play—growing up, this would have been fantastic.\n\nOn how this tool can help open up tennis to more youth . . .\n\nA lot more people. And yeah, OK, it's going to be $300, but if get three lessons, those are $300. And that's not paying for the court, that’s not getting to the court. And time—you may not have three hours to go someplace to play for an hour and come back. You get a half an hour workout with this thing in this space, it’s priceless. So it'll pay for itself in no time at all.\n\nOn other ways to help grow the sport . . .\n\nCoaching. People need good coaching. Getting on a court is one thing, but getting some feedback and help with technique, tactics, all of that, it cuts a lot of corners. There’s no accident that you have so many big players coming out that are children of professional players because they get that coaching right away. There's no bad habits. I play golf. I played three, four times a year, and I play bogey golf because I learned from a professional golfer. So no bad habits.\n\nCoaching is priceless, and it's expensive—priceless and expensive and too many can't afford it. So this thing can give you some feedback, some coaching. Of course, it's not a substitute completely, but it's definitely a good tool. And then I would love to see more money put into good coaches. It’s essential for any athlete to get the help that they need.\n\nOn the adoption of data in tennis . . .\n\nThat really comes into play at the highest level. What do you really need to know the details of what your weaknesses are, what to work on, and then try to find out what the opponents are doing and all that. That really is a higher level.\n\nOn what young players need to do more of . . .\n\nFor kids growing up they just want to hit a lot of balls and and have fun and compete. These days, there's so much emphasis on technique that they don't play enough sets. They don't just compete. The bottom line is, that's what's important, but they don't practice it enough.\n\nOn her first attempt at playing digital tennis . . .\n\nI did Wii like 20 years ago, and I sucked. [laughs] Because Wii is for people that play Wii. It’s not for tennis players. This [Sense Arena] is for tennis players. This is where you can improve.\n\nOn her experience with VR . . .\n\nI was worried because I've tried to watch movies with this [headset], and I get dizzy doing the 3D things. Like Disneyland, you know when you go on the [ride] and things are coming at you, I cannot watch. I get sick to my stomach in no time at all. I want to watch, but I cannot. So I was worried that I would get dizzy [in VR] and had no problem at all. I was like, ‘Oh, my God, there’s a world there.’ But I got used to it immediately."
