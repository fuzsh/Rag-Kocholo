Her contribution to the sport has been immense. Her achievements have earned her numerous accolades and awards over the years.\n\nThe latest recognition came in the form of the silver medal in Prague. It was a medal of the president of the Senate. After receiving such an honor, Martina took a short trip to London to visit one of her ‘old friends’. And shared a snap with her fans on social media.\n\nMartina Navratilova visits London to meet an old friend after receiving an award\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nNavratilova, who grew up in Řevnice near Prague, expressed her happiness of being back in her homeland and expressed that today’s sports people will not have to leave their own countries to pursue their dreams like in her times. This is a testament to the progress that the Czech Republic has made in recent years, and Navratilova’s achievements have played a significant role in inspiring and motivating young sports enthusiasts in the country.\n\nAfter receiving an award for her remarkable career, she decided to visit an ‘old friend’ in London. Even though she did not mention who that friend was, she definitely made it clear with a photograph. She is in London to watch Wimbledon. Her Tweet said, “In London for the day, saying hello to an old friend:), And yes, I already had the strawberries. Without cream:)”.\n\nNot only did she visit London to enjoy Wimbledon but also a delightful fruit snack just the way she likes it.

I said to myself, Are they afraid I’ll die before they give it to me? They wanted to give it to me in New York, but I could hardly walk. I said, Hopefully, I will come to Řevnice and we’ll manage it when I’m in Prague… It means a lot to me – but you know I’m more used to gold”.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nEven after going through such a hard time and battling through a difficult phase, Martina continues to have a humorous approach to life. The silver medal is a fitting tribute to Navratilova’s remarkable career and personal positions."
