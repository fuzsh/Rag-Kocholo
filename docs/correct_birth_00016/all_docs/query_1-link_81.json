        "text": "Martina Navratilova is a Czechâ€“born American former professional tennis player, widely regarded as one of the greatest female tennis players of all time, dominating the sport throughout the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nShe was ranked as the world No. 1 in singles for a total of 332 weeks for a record 237 weeks in doubles, making her the only player in history to have held the top spot in both disciplines for over 200 weeks.\n\nKnown for her attacking style of play and exceptional fitness, Navratilova revolutionised women's tennis by introducing a more aggressive and athletic approach to the game. Her serve-and-volley tactics, powerful groundstrokes, and exceptional volleying skills set new standards for the sport.\n\nNavratilova's tennis career was marked by remarkable achievements and records. She won a total of 18 Grand Slam singles titles, including a record nine Wimbledon championships. She also claimed 31 Grand Slam doubles titles and 10 Grand Slam mixed doubles titles, bringing her total to an impressive 59 major titles.\n\nFollowing her retirement from playing, she became a respected commentator and advocate for the sport. As one of the first openly gay sports figures, she has been a vocal advocate for gender equality in sports and a strong supporter of many charities benefiting the LGBTQ+ community."
