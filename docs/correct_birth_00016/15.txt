Martina Navratilova was born on 18th October 1956 in Prague, in what was then Czechoslovakia. Today, Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic. Over a four-decade tennis career, Navratilova won a record-breaking 59 Grand Slam titles, including 9 Wimbledon singles championships.

Navratilova began playing tennis at the age of four and won the Czechoslovakian national tennis championship at 15. She started competing professionally in 1975 when she won her first major title at the French Open. The following year, she sought political asylum in the USA from her communist homeland. Five years later, she became a US citizen.

Throughout her career, Navratilova remained consistently within the top five female tennis players. Her greatest rival was Chris Evert, who she played 80 times, winning 43 of them. By her retirement from single play in 1994, Navratilova had won more championships than any other player, male or female, in the history of tennis.

In 1981, Navratilova came out as bisexual, although later re-identified herself as a lesbian. She was one of the first sports stars to publicly support the gay rights movement. In December 2014, Navratilova married her long-time girlfriend, Julia Lemigova, in New York.

In 2005, 'Tennis' magazine ranked Navratilova the greatest female tennis player since 1965. Since retiring, Navratilova has written three novels about a tennis star called Jordan Myles, who helps solve murders.
