        "text": "The Virginia Legends Walk at 13th Street and Atlantic Avenue is the site for a regular visit from the First Lady of Jazz. Ella is an homage to the Virginia-born jazz impresario who crossed all kinds of personal and social barriers to become one of the most beloved singers of all time. This mini-concert is fully produced with set, lights, sound, a small combo of musicians, and a singer who looks and sounds so much like Ella that she has people lining up after the show to get her autograph! You’ll hear hits like I’m In The Mood For Love, A Tisket – A Tasket, Blues Skies, and more. This half-hour tribute show is performed three times nightly and features the stories and songs from Ella’s career that have made her a household name and a true Virginia Legend.\n\nJuly 25 – August 17 | Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8pm and 9pm\n\nLocation: 13th Street Virginia Legends Live Stage"
