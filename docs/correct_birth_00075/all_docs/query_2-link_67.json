        "text": "Known as “The First Lady of Song,” Ella Fitzgerald is one of the most popular jazz singers in the world, in her career she played around the world, worked with the likes of Louis Armstrong, Frank Sinatra, and struck up a friendship with Marilyn Monroe. She won 13 Grammy awards, sold over 40 million albums, and yet, despite her popularity and success Ella faced discrimination because of the colour of her skin.\n\nElla Jane Fitzgerald was born on the 25th of April, 1917, to unmarried parents William Fitzgerald and Temperance “Tempie” Henry, the couple split up when Ella was a toddler. By the 1920s, Tempie had met a new partner named Joseph da Silva, and the family moved to Yonkers, in New York, where Tempie gave birth to another daughter named Frances da Silva, in 1923. To support their family Joe dug ditches and worked as a part-time chauffeur, while Tempie worked at a laundromat and did some catering. Ella would take on small jobs and worked as a runner for local gamblers, picking up their bets and dropping off money. Ella began her formal education when she was six years old and has been described as an “…outstanding student.” The family were Methodists and attended the Bethany African Methodist Episcopal Church, which gave Ella her first musical experiences. As a child she made friends easily and considered herself a ‘tomboy’ often joining in with the neighbourhood baseball games. She also enjoyed dancing and singing, and would sometimes take the train into Harlem and watch various acts at the Apollo Theatre.\n\nElla lost her mother In 1932, when she was just fifteen years old, after Tempies death from injuries sustained in a car accident, Ella continued to live with Joe until the following year when she moved in with an aunt in Harlem, Stuart Nicholson, Ella’s biographer has suggested the move was prompted by Ella’s “ill treatment” at the hands of her step-father. After Joe died from a heart attack, Frances joined Ella at their aunts. This is when Ella entered an extremely difficult phase of her life, she became unhappy, her grades suffered, and she would frequently miss school. During this time she worked as a lookout at a bordello and with a Mafia-affiliated numbers runner, when arrested she was sent to the Coloured Orphan Asylum in Riverdale in the Bronx before being moved to the New York Training School for Girls, which was a state reformatory school in Hudson, New York. Ella left the reformatory school at fifteen and found herself “…broke and alone during the Great Depression.” It was not in Ella’s nature to complain and she later reflected on these years with “…an appreciation for how they helped her to mature,” and said they made her more grateful for her success because she had faced real struggles.\n\nIn 1934 Ella was one of the winners of the Apollo weekly draw which gave her the chance to perform at Amateur Night. Initially Ella planned on dancing, but changed her mind after the Edwards Sisters closed the main show and she felt her act “… would not compare.” When she stepped on the stage the rowdy crowd began to boo but Ella who has since been described as “…scared and disheveled,” silenced them when she began to sing and by the time she finished her first song “Judy,” they were calling for an encore, which she happily preformed singing “The Object of My Affections.” Despite winning the chance to perform at the Apollo for a week, Ella never received her prize and some have speculated that this was down to her dishevelled appearance. Although Ella was shy and self-conscious about her appearance when she was on stage she felt at home, later saying, “Once up there, I felt the acceptance and love from my audience, I knew I wanted to sing before people the rest of my life.”\n\nThe audience were not the only people Ella impressed that evening, Benny Carter a saxophonist and arranger was so impressed with her that he began introducing her to people who could help launch her career, and in the process the two formed a lifelong friendship and often worked together. Ella began entering and winning talent shows and in January 1935 she won the chance to perform for a week with the Tiny Bradshaw band at the Harlem Opera House. It was there she met drummer and bandleader Chick Webb, who although “reluctant to sign her…because she was gawky and unkempt, a ‘diamond in the rough,'” offered Ella the chance to test with his band when they played a dance at Yale University, saying “If the kids like her, she stays.” Ella was a major success, and Chick hired her to travel with the band for $12.50 a week. The orchestra grew in popularity and as part of the group’s performances at Harlem’s Savoy Ballroom Ella made her first recording, “Love and Kisses” which was released under the Decca label. Her first big hit came in 1938 when she recorded a version of the nursery rhyme, “A-Tisket, A-Tasket” which she had co-written. The album sold one million copies, hit number one, and stayed on the pop charts for seventeen weeks and made Ella famous. Between 1935 and 1942 Ella recorded around 150 songs.\n\nAfter Chick Webb’s death from spinal tuberculosis on the 16th of June, 1939, Ella took over as bandleader and the band was renamed Ella and Her Famous Orchestra, however, the band was soon faced with dissent and money concerns, and played their last gig at the Earl Theatre in Philadelphia In 1942 Ella started to work as lead singer with The Three Keys. While working for Decca Records, Ella had hits with Bill Kenny & the Ink Spots, Louis Jordan, and the Delta Rhythm Boys, and producer Norman Granz became her manager in the mid-1940s after Ella began singing for Jazz at the Philharmonic, which had been organised by Granz.\n\nIt was a time of change in jazz music as the swing era and great touring bands began to decline and bebop became popular leading Ella to change her vocal style and include scat singing as a major part of her performance repertoire. While singing with Gillespie, Fitzgerald recalled, “I just tried to do [with my voice] what I heard the horns in the band doing.” Her 1945 recording of “Flying Home” is described by The New York Times as “one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade.” Her 1947 bebop recording of “Oh, Lady Be Good!” was popular and increased her reputation as one of the leading jazz vocalists of the time.\n\nIn July 1954 Ella was invited by the Australian-based American promoter Lee Gordon to tour Australia as part of his “Big Show” promotions and the ‘package’ tour also included Buddy Rich, Artie Shaw and comedian Jerry Colonna, however, Ella missed the first two concerts because of of an incident of racial discrimination. Despite having first class tickets on the Pan-American Airlines flight from Honolulu to Australia Ella, her pianist John Lewis, her assistant Georgiana Henry, and manager Norman Granz were ordered off of the flight and refused permission to re-board or retrieve their luggage. They were stranded in Honolulu for the three days when they were able to get a flight to Sydney. An Australian Pan-Am spokesperson denied that the incident was racially based, but Ella, Henry, Lewis and Granz filed a civil suit for racial discrimination and received a settlement.\n\nElla continued to perform at Granz’s Jazz at the Philharmonic and in 1955 she left Decca, and Granz, created Verve Records around her, Ella later described this as ‘strategically crucial’\n\n“I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop. I thought be-bop was ‘it’, and that all I had to do was go some place and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman … felt that I should do other things, so he produced Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Song Book with me. It was a turning point in my life.”\n\nIn 1956 Ella released ‘Ella Sings the Cole Porter Song Book’, the first of eight Song Book sets she recorded for Verve between 1956 and 1964.\n\nThe situation in Australia was not the only act of discrimination Ella faced, Granz felt very strongly about civil rights and required equal treatment for his musicians, in hotels, restaurants or concert halls. Whilst touring in Dallas police entered Ella’s dressing room, where band members Dizzy Gillespie and Illinois Jacquet were shooting dice, and arrested everyone. Ella later recalled that “They took us down, and then when we got there, they had the nerve to ask for an autograph.”\n\nAs well as support from her manager, Ella had support from celebratory fans including Marilyn Monroe, who called the owner of the popular Mocambo nightclub and told him if he booked Ella she would take a front table every night. On opening night Marilyn was as promised in the front row, and Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland also attended. Ella’s shows sold out and the manager added an extra week to her contract, Ella later said; “I owe Marilyn Monroe a real debt…” it certainly changed her career for the better and she never had to play a small jazz club again.\n\n(Ella and Marilyn Munroe https://www.biography.com/news/marilyn-monroe-ella-fitzgerald-friendship)\n\nAs well as singing, Ella appeared on the screen, her most notable performance was in Jack Webb’s 1955 jazz film Pete Kelly’s Blues in which she played singer Maggie Jackson co-starring alongside Janet Leigh and singer Peggy Lee. Ella’s performance was one of the few parts of the film critics praised. Ella made many guest appearances on television shows, singing on The Frank Sinatra Show, The Carol Burnett Show, The Andy Williams Show, The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom, and The Ed Sullivan Show. Ella appeared in TV commercials, the most famous of which was for Memorex. In the advert, she sang a note that shattered a glass while being recorded on a Memorex cassette tape, then when the tape was played back the recording broke another glass, asking: “Is it live, or is it Memorex?”\n\nIn 1985 Ella was hospitalised with respiratory issues, she was hospitalised again in September of 1986, and underwent quintuple coronary bypass surgery. Doctors also replaced a valve in her heart and diagnosed her with diabetes.The press carried rumors that she would never be able to sing again, but Ella proved them wrong. Despite protests by family and friends, Ella returned to the stage and pushed on with an exhaustive schedule. She gave her final performance in 1991, at New York’s renowned Carnegie Hall. It was the 26th time she performed there. In 1993, Ella had to have both of her legs amputated below the knee due to the effects of diabetes which also affected her eyesight. After the surgery Ella enjoyed sitting in her backyard, and spending time with her adopted son Ray, Jr. and her granddaughter Alice, saying, “I just want to smell the air, listen to the birds and hear Alice laugh.” Ella died on the 15th of June, 1996 at the age of 79. Just hours after her death signs of remembrance began to appear all over the world, a wreath of white flowers was placed next to her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, and a marquee outside the Hollywood Bowl theater read, “Ella, we will miss you.” After a private funeral Ella was buried in the “Sanctuary of the Bells” section of the Sunset Mission Mausoleum at Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California.\n\nOff stage Ella was shy and dedicated to her music, Mario Bauzá a trumpet player who played with Ella in the early part of her career recalled that she “…didn’t hang out much. When she got into the band, she was dedicated to her music….” After the Society of Singers named an award after her, Ella said; “I don’t want to say the wrong thing, which I always do but I think I do better when I sing.”\n\nWhilst shy, we know Ella was married twice and evidence suggests there may have been a third marriage. In 1941 she married Benny Kornegay, a convicted drug dealer and local dockworker, however, the marriage was annulled the following year. In 1946 whilst on tour with Dizzy Gillespie’s band Ella met bass player Ray Brown and the two married in December 1947. They adopted a son named Ray Brown Jr, however, as the couple toured frequently, he was largely raised by Ella’s aunt Virginia. This strained the relationship between mother and son, however, they later reconciled and had a close relationship. Ella and Ray divorced in 1953, but remained friends and continued to perform together. In July 1957, it was reported by Reuters that Ella secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, but the relationship ended when Larsen was sentenced to five months’ hard labor in Sweden for stealing money from a young woman to whom he had previously been engaged.\n\nElla was interested in the civil rights movement and used her “…talent to break racial barriers across the nation.” She was awarded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Equal Justice Award and the American Black Achievement Award and became recognised as a “cultural ambassador.” In 1987 she received the National Medal of Arts and America’s highest non-military honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. It was one of her most prized moments. France followed suit several years later, presenting her with their Commander of Arts and Letters award, while Yale, Dartmouth and several other universities awarded her with honorary doctorates.\n\n(https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/who-was-ella-fitzgeralds-husband-at-the-time-of-her-death.html/)\n\nOutside of entertainment, Ella had a deep concern for child welfare and although not widely publicised she gave several large donations to organizations for disadvantaged youths, and the continuation of these contributions was part of the driving force that prevented her from slowing down even as her health began to fail. In 1993, she established the Ella Fitzgerald Charitable Foundation focusing on charitable grants for four major categories: academic opportunities for children, music education, basic care needs for the less fortunate, medical research revolving around diabetes, heart disease, and vision impairment. In addition, she supported several nonprofit organizations like the American Heart Association, City of Hope, and the Retina Foundation\n\nElla Fitzgerald had an amazing voice that enthralled diverse audiences then and now. She used her talent to raise herself out of poverty, break barriers and provide opportunities to those who were less fortunate, all in spite of the prejudices she faced because of her skin colour.\n\nAuthor; Gemma Apps.\n\nIf you enjoy our content please consider becoming a Patreon here\n\nSources:\n\nElla Fitzgerald: A Biography Of The First Lady Of Jazz.
