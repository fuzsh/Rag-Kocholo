        "text": "Ella Fitzgerald, one of the great voices of jazz, was born April 25, 1918, in Newport News. Within a year of her birth, her father died and her mother took her to Yonkers, N.Y. Her mother died shortly after the move and young Ella was sent to an orphanage. Finally, she was taken in by an aunt in New York City.\n\nAt age 16, she won $10 in an amateur-night contest at the Apollo Theater in New York's Harlem. Talk on the street of a gifted young singer won her a bigger prize: a job as featured vocalist with the orchestra of drummer Chick Webb. The shy teen-ager began her professional career on the stage of the Savoy Ballroom, at the time one of the top jazz spots in Harlem.\n\nIn 1935, with Webb's group, Fitzgerald recorded her first disc, \"Love and Kisses.\" She made hundreds more during the next 50 years.\n\nHer voice was unmistakable -- high and light (\"girlish,\" critics kept saying), unusually pure, with the breath control and precise diction of a conservatory-schooled singer. In fact, Fitzgerald was almost entirely self-trained.\n\nIn 1938, she co-wrote and recorded what would become her signature tune, \"A-tisket, A-tasket.\" The song was the first classic of her specialty: scat-singing -- singing syllables instead of words.\n\nScat syllables have no meaning but a very definite purpose. \"I try to do what I think a horn would play,\" Fitzgerald explained during a 1979 appearance at the Hampton Jazz Festival.\n\nHer scatting and swing vocalizing influenced virtually every jazz singer and more than a few horn players. Some jazz historians believe Fitzgerald's singing style contributed to the instrumental innovations of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and other pioneers of bebop.\n\nBy 1942, she was a solo singer, a recording star who worked with a variety of jazz players and bandleaders. Count Basie, Duke Ellington and Oscar Peterson would become her favorite collaborators.\n\nShe also sang with a group led by bassist Ray Brown. They were married in 1949, divorced in 1953.\n\nFitzgerald began a movie career in the '40s, but her most memorable film appearances came later, in \"Pete Kelly's Blues\" (1955) and \"St. Louis Blues\" (1958). So did the cream of her recordings, a series of \"songbooks\" featuring her interpretations of great songwriters such as Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Ellington.\n\n\"I never knew how good our songs were until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them,\" Ira Gershwin once said.\n\nPopular standards of the '20s, '30s and '40s remained the backbone of Fitzgerald's repertory, although she liked to sample the work of younger songwriters such as Stevie Wonder.\n\nElla, as she was almost universally known, performed in the world's top nightclubs and most prestigious concert halls and festivals. Her recordings won 13 Grammy awards, and she was awarded honorary doctorates from Yale and Dartmouth and the 1979 Kennedy Center Honors for her artistic contributions.\n\nIronically, though, she may have reached her largest audience in a '70s television commercial. \"Is it live or is it Memorex?\" the announcer asked after she sang a long, high note that shattered a wine glass.\n\nLate in life, diabetes forced her to retire. After several years as an invalid, she died June 15, 1996, at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif."
