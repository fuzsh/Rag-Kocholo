“It isn’t where you came from,

it’s where you’re going that counts.”

~Ella Fitzgerald

Ella Jane Fitzgerald (1917-1996) was born to Temprance and William Fitzgerald in Newport News, Virginia on April 25, 1917. Shortly after her birth, Ella’s parents separated and Temprance moved she and Ella in with her boyfriend Joseph Da Silva to a house in Yonkers, New York. Ella was a self-proclaimed “tomboy” who enjoyed singing. With her friends, Ms. Fitzgerald would often take the train into Harlem to the Apollo Theater.

Ella’s mother Tempie died in 1932 in a car accident. Shortly after, Ella’s step-father Joseph died from a heart attack. Ella and her two half sisters had a very difficult time adjusting to their parents’ deaths and moved to Ella’s hometown in Newport News. Ella’s grades began dropping in school and eventually was sent to a reform school after a run-in with the police. At reform school, her life was miserable and her caretakers beat her. Ella left the reformatory when she was 15 and found herself flat-broke and alone during the Great Depression.

In 1934 Ella’s name was pulled in a weekly drawing at the Apollo and she won the opportunity to compete in Amateur Night. On the stage, the audience booed when stage fright overtook her. Once she began to sing, the audience became silent and then, demanded encores. Off stage, and away from people she knew well, Ella was shy and reserved. She was self-conscious about her appearance and even doubted her abilities. Surprisingly, on stage, Ella had no fear.
