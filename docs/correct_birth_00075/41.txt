Ella Fitzgerald, the ‘First Lady of Song,’ was a Newport News, Virginia native who later rose to global acclaim with her voice, transcending societal barriers, and touching millions of hearts. Despite humble beginnings, she became a jazz legend whose contribution to music is celebrated to this day. On International Jazz Day, let us explore her deep connection to Virginia and a culture rich in history, landmarks, and experiences waiting to be explored.

Exploring Ella Fitzgelad’s Legacy Today

Born April 25, 1917, Ella Fitzgerald’s early years in Newport News, Virginia, were brief, but formative. Despite challenges, her passion for music led to a legendary jazz career, inspiring generations. Later, she returned to Virginia and performed at the historic black neighbourhood, Hippodrome Theatre in Richmond’s Jackson Ward, although she was barred from performing at various venues in Richmond due to racial segregation. She also performed at the Cavalier Hotel’s Beach Club in Virginia Beach, joining the ranks of iconic performers like Cab Calloway, Frank Sinatra, and Benny Goodman. Between the years 1930 and 1950, the hotel was the world’s largest contractor of big band performers. Her journey was instrumental in paving the way for many future artists, especially those of colour.

Today, Ella Fitzgerald’s legacy can be felt throughout Newport News providing an opportunity for her fans and music enthusiasts to experience it from very close. Downing-Gross Cultural Arts Center offers a deeper dive into her life and career. The Ella Fitzgerald Theater within the centre is a tribute to the profound impact she has on the local community and beyond.

A prominent landmark in the area is the striking mural at the Jefferson Brookville Apartments on 26th Street. At 13 feet in height and 12 feet in width, this mural and the intricate mosaic capture a slice of Ella’s story within the urban landscape.

In a heartfelt tribute, the community renamed 24th Street to Ella Fitzgerald Way in 2008. These enduring commemorations only remind the significance of Ella’s spirit and legacy along the streets of the Virginia town.
