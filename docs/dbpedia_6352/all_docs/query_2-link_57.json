        "text": "With Verstappen fever reaching an all-time high, Zandvoort returned as the host of the Dutch Grand Prix in 2021 after a 36-year absence from the Formula 1 calendar.\n\nUnusually located for a racing circuit, Circuit Zandvoort can be found to the east of Amsterdam, next to the North Sea, in the sand dunes of the seaside town of Zandvoort. The town of Zandvoort hosted street racing prior to the start of World War II, with a number of minor street races taking place on the streets of the coastal town in 1939 – the first being on June 3, 1939.\n\nThe onset of war prevented racing from taking place for around ten years, though tentative plans for a permanent racing circuit had already been drawn up. Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in World War II, the Germans had constructed roads through the sand dunes. After the war, these roads were widened and linked together. The Royal Dutch Motorcycle Association sought advice from Sammy Davis – winner of the 1927 24 Hours of Le Mans – and together designed the Zandvoort circuit.\n\nJohn Hugenholtz – the designer of the Suzuka circuit in Japan – is often wrongly attributed as designing the track. Hugenholtz did have ties to the track, however, acting as circuit director from 1949 to 1974.\n\nZandvoort joins the Grand Prix calendar\n\nThe Zandvoort track opened its doors for the first time on August 7 1948. The circuit hosted the first so-called ‘Zandvoort Grand Prix’ in 1949, which was won by Prince Bira, before staging the inaugural Dutch Grand Prix in 1950. Both this edition and the 1951 Dutch Grand Prix were won by Louis Rosier. Neither were run as rounds of the World Championship. Instead, Zandvoort first appeared on the Formula 1 calendar in 1952.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1985, there were only a handful of occasions on which the Dutch Grand Prix was not staged. The 1954 race was cancelled due to a lack of funding. Somewhat surprisingly, the 1955 Dutch Grand Prix did take place, it did so just a week after the Le Mans disaster – to some backlash at the time. The race was cancelled in both 1956 and 1957 – according to some sources, as a result of the Le Mans disaster, others blame a lack of money indirectly caused by the Suez Crisis.\n\nAs the circuit became more established, the public roads which formed parts of the track became closed to the public. The original Zandvoort layout was well-loved by drivers, for its tight, twisting and demanding nature. Iconic corners such as the opening Tarzan turn and the famous Bos Uit right-hander were regarded among the best corners of any contemporary race circuit.\n\nTragedy strikes at Zandvoort\n\nThe 1960 Dutch Grand Prix was overshadowed by the death of a spectator, who had been killed as a result of a crash for Dan Gurney, whilst standing in a prohibited area. Ten years later, tragedy struck again at Zandvoort. This time, popular British driver Piers Courage was killed when his car left the circuit, somersaulting and exploding as a result of broken suspension.\n\nDespite Courage’s death, no changes were made to the circuit in the following season. The 1971 Dutch Grand Prix was the last Formula 1 race to take place on a track which had no safety features. Due to safety concerns, the track was removed from the calendar in 1972 but returned in 1973 with a modified layout and added safety barriers. A chicane was introduced to help slow the cars at the high speed Bos Uit turn and a new pit complex was built to bring the track up to modern standards.\n\nDespite the changes, tragedy struck again. On Lap 8 of the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix, Roger Williamson crashed and his car caught fire. The British driver was uninjured in the crash, but was unable to free himself from the burning wreckage. Appalling scenes played out on live television, as ill-equipped and ill-prepared marshals were unable to help extract the driver from his car. David Purley stopped alongside the car in a vain attempt to save his fellow countryman from the flames. Shockingly, the race was not stopped. Williamson succumbed to asphyxiation.\n\nOn a weekend that was supposed to show off Zandvoort’s new facilities and increased safety standards, the events of the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix tarnished Zandvoort’s reputation.\n\nThe end of Zandvoort’s first stint on the F1 calendar\n\nThe circuit underwent further changes in the name of safety over the following decade. By the 1980s, money was running thin and the circuit faced a number of calls to be sold off. One such instance saw the circuit under threat from property developers, who wished to turn the land into a holiday resort.\n\nFormula 1 raced at Zandvoort for the final time in 1985, with the Dutch Grand Prix being replaced by the Hungarian Grand Prix on the following season’s schedule. Plans to sell part of the land on which the circuit sat were approved that year and the circuit was shortened as a result. Work finished on the new layout two years later, by which time the circuit was declared bankrupt. The bankruptcy and a change of owner meant that building work did not begin until 1989.\n\nA proving ground for young drivers\n\nThe Masters of F3 event became the biggest annual event at Zandvoort throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. The circuit became a proving ground for young talent, with the A1 Grand Prix series racing here in three of its four seasons, DTM making frequent visits and Formula 3 and Masters of F3 introducing up and coming drivers.\n\nDavid Coulthard, Jos Verstappen, Lewis Hamilton, Nico Hulkenberg, Valtteri Bottas and Max Verstappen are all among the future stars who took junior victories at Zandvoort. The Masters of F3 event was discontinued in 2016.\n\nThe draw of junior categories gave circuit bosses some budget to play with and by the end of the 1990s, the track had been upgraded and extended. The revised circuit opened in 2001.\n\nVerstappen-mania leads to return of Zandvoort in F1\n\nUntil 2016, Jos Verstappen – two time podium finisher – was the Netherlands’ best racing export in Formula 1. That changed as his son, Max Verstappen, impressed in his maiden season with Toro Rosso in 2015 and went on to win on his Red Bull debut at the 2016 Spanish Grand Prix, becoming the sport’s youngest ever winner.\n\nWith Dutch interest in Formula 1 rising in a similar trajectory to Verstappen’s stardom, the Dutch contingent began to make their voices heard at races across Europe, with many Dutch fans flocking to circuits on the continent and boosting attendance figures.\n\nIt was not long before the return of the Dutch Grand Prix began to be discussed. After much speculation, the event’s return was finally confirmed in May 2019. The comeback race was scheduled to take place in May 2020 with over a million fans applying for tickets.\n\nThe track was revamped ahead of its return, with facilities upgraded and a number of changes made to the circuit. An investment of €4 million was made to bring the track up to F1 standards. The layout of the circuit was not changed, but banking was added to Turns 3 and 14.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant that the return of the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort was delayed by a year. Zandvoort finally re-appeared on the calendar in September 2021, 36 years after it had last hosted a World Championship event.\n\nMax Verstappen won the Dutch Grand Prix in 2021, 2022 and 2023, with attendance figures soaring past 300,000 in the latter two years. The 2021 race had been run at two thirds capacity due to coronavirus pandemic related restrictions.\n\nThe Dutch Grand Prix has a contract to remain on the Formula 1 calendar until at least 2025, while the circuit’s owners have a lease on the land until at least 2041.\n\nZANDVOORT: FAST FACTS\n\nExcluding the Indianapolis 500, the 1969 and 1970 Dutch Grands Prix are the only World Championship Formula 1 races to be held at the same circuit on the same date in successive years.\n\nPedro Rodriguez scored his final podium finish in Formula 1 at the 1971 Dutch Grand Prix. It was the last time that a Mexican driver would stand on the F1 podium until Sergio Perez did so 41 years later, at the 2012 Malaysian Grand Prix.\n\nJackie Stewart recorded his 26th Grand Prix victory at the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix, seeing him overtake Jim Clark as the driver to have won the most races in Formula 1.\n\nJames Hunt took the first victory of his Formula 1 career at the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix. He did so on his birthday. It was the first time any driver had won on their birthday and remains one of only two occasions on which it has happened.\n\nMario Andretti’s victory at the 1978 Dutch Grand Prix remains the final occasion on which an American driver has won a Grand Prix. It was also the final 1-2 finish for Lotus in Formula 1.\n\nNiki Lauda took an unwanted record at the 1979 Dutch Grand Prix, becoming the first driver to record retirements at nine successive Grands Prix.\n\nThe 1985 Dutch Grand Prix would be Stefan Bellof’s final F1 appearance. He was killed one week later in the 1000km of Spa race.\n\nWhile John Hugenholtz is sometimes wrongly attributed as the designer of the Zandvoort circuit, the track’s sweeping bends are believed to be a major inspiration for the Suzuka circuit, which Hugenholtz designed in the early 1960s.\n\nDavid Purley was awarded the prestigious George Medal for his actions in trying to save Roger Williamson’s life in the 1973 Dutch Grand Prix.\n\nWith over 36 years between the 1985 and 2021 Dutch Grands Prix, Zandvoort has the second longest gap between two World Championship races.\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT ZANDVOORT\n\nZANDVOORT: POLESITTERS AND WINNERS"
