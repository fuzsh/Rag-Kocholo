        "text": "As had late Le Mans replacement Ivor Bueb, co-driver (and local hero) Desmond Titterington drove superbly in support of Hawthorn to draw away from Moss’s American co-driver John Fitch. The damp roads persisted, however, and Moss could not be denied.\n\nHawthorn, who made his great rival work very hard for victory, also lost a sure-fire second when his XK’s crankshaft broke on the penultimate lap. Clearly, however, he remained ferociously competitive despite everything else.\n\nAnd ‘everything else’ included the fatal accidents of his good buddies Beauman, who was killed in July’s Leinster Trophy, and Julian Crossley, who spent more than a week in a coma before succumbing to injuries sustained in August’s 350cc Ulster GP at Dundrod.\n\nIn the TT itself Moss and Hawthorn had on its second lap plunged into the smoke of the crash site that contained the wreckage of Macklin’s Healey and had also claimed the lives of Bill Smith and Jim Mayers.\n\nHawthorn had known Mayers since his Riley days and had known Richard Mainwaring, who was killed in the closing stages when his Elva flipped and caught alight, since their schooldays.\n\nUnable to ink a deal with Enzo that would allow him to continue his association with Jaguar, Hawthorn signed for BRM for F1 in 1956. Its P25 possessed formidable acceleration and short-term speed but lacked the balance and (relative) reliability of its Italian rivals. It chucked Hawthorn out at Goodwood in April and another seizing universal joint – without the painful skinning consequences this time – ended his spell leading the British GP and called a premature halt to a delayed and stuttering programme.\n\nEven Jaguar failed him that season. With a sizeable capacity advantage over prototypes (in theory now limited to 2500cc) due to the D-type’s productionised status, his engine began to misfire on the fourth lap. By the time the cause had been traced to a crack in an injector pipe too much time had been lost and the pre-race favourite, again co-driven commendably by Bueb, could finish only sixth.\n\nAnother difficult season, although not as grievous as 1955, came to an abrupt and injurious end with a crash, another inversion, in a Lotus Eleven at Oulton Park in August. Seeking a port in a storm Hawthorn approached Ferrari for 1957 – for F1 and sports cars this time – and struck a deal, albeit on the basis that he was to be jointly number one with Collins, Castellotti – soon to be killed testing at Modena – and Luigi Musso until the F1 season had taken shape.\n\nIt proved no sinecure; not one victory came his way. Overshadowed by Collins, as well specialists Olivier Gendebien and Phil Hill, in sports cars – endurance racing had become a tiresome task to be endured and where possible avoided – Hawthorn might have won in F1 had he not punctured on debris from leader Jean Behra’s detonating Maserati at Aintree’s British GP or had he not, overly confident and comfortingly supported by Collins, backed off too soon at the Nürburgring and been caught and passed by an inspired Fangio, his Maserati on fresher rubber.\n\nHawthorn vowed to put matters – bad luck and misjudgments – right in 1958. Had he decided already to make this his last season? Probably not. But doctors had warned that illness would be increasingly against him.\n\nHis new Ferrari 246 V6 Dino, smaller and lighter, had been tested and race-proven before the implementation of the F1 regulations for which it had conceived, designed and built. In contrast BRM and Vanwall struggled to modify existing machines to suit: mandatory use of pump fuel and GPs shortened by a third. As a result, Hawthorn – on Englebert tyres generally inferior to rivals’ Dunlops – played a canny game that belied his reputation, nursing sick cars and regularly picking up the point available for fastest lap – at Monaco, Spa, Reims, Silverstone and Oporto – without shedding entirely that famed feistiness; a coruscating letter to Enzo after a disastrous Dutch GP had had a galvanizing effect. And when the stars aligned he delivered his most consummate performance.\n\nFrench Grand Prix\n\nReims, 6 July, 1958\n\nHawthorn was not a fan of this triangular road circuit in Champagne – but it seemed to like him. On pole by seven-tenths, he made a rare good getaway; he had become obsessively protective of clutches. That’s not to say he led from the start. He was, however, leading by the end of the opening lap having overtaken Musso, Tony Brooks (Vanwall) and Schell (BRM).\n\nHe was relentless thereafter, pulling away despite feathering the throttle on the long straights while not forgetting to ace another fastest lap in the closing stages. Only as he overhauled Fangio, who was holding fourth place, did he hesitate before respectfully deciding not to lap the great man in what turned out to be his farewell race.\n\nOn his slowing-down lap Hawthorn paused at the site of Musso’s accident – the Italian had dropped a wheel on the grass while striving to keep pace with the apparently unhurried leader – but left none the wiser.\n\nAny joy to be had was therefore in abeyance and somewhat false and forced – drinks were again taken – once the tragic news had broken. Hawthorn was not close to Musso but nor was he a sworn enemy. It’s understandable, however, that the Roman felt isolated in his country’s most celebrated sporting team, for Hawthorn and Collins had become a very tight unit. It was the latter’s death one month later that was the final straw: Hawthorn vowed to retire at the season’s end – as world champion.\n\nHe achieved that cherished aim by a single point over Moss. The long flight home from North Africa, however, was subdued. Vanwall’s Stuart Lewis-Evans, badly burned when a seized engine caused a crash, was laid on a stretcher across a row of seats in a Vickers Viscount chartered by Vandervell. He was that flight’s chattiest passenger. He died five days later on 25 October.\n\nExhausted, Hawthorn had been in no mood to celebrate when the official awards ceremony on 29 October at the RAC Club on Pall Mall in any case descended into British anger at the governing body’s ill-timed revelation of unpopular new F1 regulations – that ran contrary to Hawthorn’s solicited advice – for 1961. Hawthorn continued to attend dos held in his honour and of course accepted an invite to lunch at Buck House. It was only when matters began to settle that he made his retirement official in December.\n\nNo one can know for sure if this remarkably resilient world champion would have been allowed the time and health necessary for reflection, for sifting the good from the bad and treating them with greater equanimity. For fate was yet to play its most cruel trick. On 22 January 1959, sparked into response by a Mercedes-Benz, Hawthorn, not yet 30, was killed when his skidding Jaguar cleaved against a tree bordering the A3."
