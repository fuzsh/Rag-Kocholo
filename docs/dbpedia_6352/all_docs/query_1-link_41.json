        "text": "CLICK HERE TO READ THE HISTORY OF THE PRANCING HORSE\n\nEnzo Ferrari was born in 1898 and in his early years he enjoyed some success as a racing driver. He joined Alfa Romeo in 1920 as a driver but he soon moved to the technical and design side. In 1929, Alfa Romeo withdrew from motor racing and Ferrari took over their workshops under the name Scuderia Ferrari, and continued to build what were essentially Alfa Romeo cars.\n\nIt was after World War 2, in 1947 that the first 'true' Ferrari single seater design was produced and Ferrari soon gained a reputation for reliability.\n\nThe FIA Formula 1 Championship was launched in 1950 and was initially dominated by Alfa Romeo but in 1951 at the British GP, Ferrari achieved their first win - the first of many Grand Prix victories. The driver was Froilan Gonzalez.\n\nFerrari took the Drivers World Championship in 1952 and 1953 with Alberto Ascari driving one of the all-time classic single seater racing cars - the Ferrari 500. In two seasons - 1952 and 1953 the Ferrari 500 won every Grand Prix except just one race.\n\nThe mid-1950s saw Mercedes-Benz return to and dominate Grand Prix racing but the 'silver arrows' team withdrew from motor sport after one of their sports cars crashed into the crowd at the 1955 Le Mans 24 hour race. The great Argentinean driver Juan-Manuel Fangio who won the 1955 Drivers World Championship driving for Mercedes moved to Ferrari.\n\nFerrari took over Lancia's formula 1 car design (Lancia was having financial problems) and this raced as the Lancia-Ferrari and Fangio took the Drivers World Championship for Ferrari in 1956. Fangio however had a strained relationship with Enzo Ferrari and moved to the rival Maserati team the following season.\n\nIn 1958, Mike Hawthorn driving for Ferrari became the first British World Drivers Champion.\n\nBut Grand Prix racing was changing - a new formula with a 1.5 litre normally aspirated engine was introduced and rear engined cars became the 'standard'. Ferrari produced the famous 'shark nosed' GP car and Phil Hill of the United States took the 1961 Drivers World Championship with this car, after his team mate Wolfgang von Trips was killed in racing accident at the Italian Grand Prix.\n\nJohn Surtees who had transferred to F1 racing, after a very successful motorcycle-racing career, became the Drivers World Champion driving for Ferrari in 1964. Surtees like Hawthorn before him, established a good working relationship with Enzo Ferrari, but left the team early in 1965 season after a disagreement with the team.\n\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, new teams such as Lotus, Tyrell, and McLaren began to dominate F1 and be the innovating force.\n\nFerrari now had to wait eleven years for their next Drivers World Champion - Niki Lauda became World Champion in 1975 driving for Ferrari. The following year Lauda had a horrific crash in his Ferrari and suffered major burns, but Lauda recovered from his injuries and in 1977 he took the World Drivers Championship for Ferrari.\n\nFerrari now had to wait eleven years for their next Drivers World Champion - Niki Lauda became World Champion in 1975 driving for Ferrari. The following year Lauda had a horrific crash in his Ferrari and suffered major burns, but Lauda recovered from his injuries and in 1977 he took the World Drivers Championship for Ferrari.\n\nThe South African Jody Schekter took the Drivers World Championship for Ferrari in 1979. But Ferrari would have to wait 21 years for its next Drivers Championship.\n\nHighly professional organised teams such as McLaren and Williams dominated Grand Prix racing in the 1980s and 1990s. Ferrari in comparison always seemed to race in a politically charged passionate atmosphere, which many of their drivers found difficult to cope with. Enzo Ferrari died in 1989 at the age of 90, but almost up to his death he still exercised influence and had his own autocratic style of management.\n\nThe Ferrari team had the services of some of the finest drivers of the day - for example: Alain Prost who did not seem to enjoy his time with the team and Nigel Mansell who was idolised by the fanatical fans as 'il Leone' (the lion). But neither driver was able to deliver the Drivers World Championship to Ferrari.\n\nFerrari is now part of the Fiat motor group, so financial support and resources have been available. It is believed that Ferrari have the largest operating budget in F1 - thought to be about £80M (US$120M) per season. What is unique about Ferrari F1 cars - they have always raced in the bright racing red of Italy but these days they are sponsored by Marlboro cigarettes, and Ferrari pride themselves on building the whole car - chassis and engine .\n\nThe desire by Ferrari to once again have a World Champion Driver never diminished, and Ferrari has remained in the top echelon of teams. Michael Schumacher - twice World Drivers Champion - moved to Ferrari in 1996 and a new international management team was assembled including Jean Todt and the British master strategist - Ross Brawn (who had worked with Schumacher at Benetton). Schumacher was runner up in the World championship in 1997 and 1998. Schumacher has signed a very lucrative contract to stay at Ferrari and his efforts were rewarded by taking the F1 Drivers Championship in year 2000 (21 years since Jody Schekter took the title for Ferrari). Schumacher has taken the Driver World Championship four more times for Ferrari - including record breaking 6 th World Championship in 2003.\n\n2004 would see Ferrari continue to dominate F1, after the tough battle in 2003 many expected Ferrari's winning run to come to an end at the hands of their Michelin shod rivals, but the F2004 was simply the class of the field as Ferrari went on the rampage once again similar to 2002 where nobody had an answer to their pace. Ferrari were so far ahead of the rest they stopped developing the chassis in the summer to work on the 2005 car, thus allowing their rivals some hope as they caught up with the champions towards the end of the season, but by then it was all done and dusted and the team sealed yet another double championship win, with 15 wins from 18 races.\n\nThe credentials of the Ferrari team are impressive - they are the only F1 team to be continuously active in the current World Championship since its inception over 50 years ago. The team continue to enjoy world wide support and particularly fanatical support in Italy and it has scored the largest number of Grand prix wins of any team, but competition in F1 racing remains fierce."
