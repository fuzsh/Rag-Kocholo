        "text": "Ferrari's pioneer 166 MM won the race for its rookie participation in 1949 with a 12-cylinder V engine (2 litres) also the first of that design to win the 24 Hours. The car's unique lines made it the first exhibited at MoMA, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, in a superb midnight blue and beige livery, to the great pride of owner and Belgian Ferrari importer, Jacques Swaters (1926- 2010).\n\nThe V12 as an emblem\n\nThereafter, the 12-cylinder engine became a Ferrari calling card, found on every racing car at Le Mans from 1950 to 1954. Their capacity increased: 195 S (2.4 litres), 212 Export (2.6 litres, ninth and 15th in 1951), 255 S (2.7 litres) and 250 S (3 litres).\n\nSeveral other Ferrari models made their mark during that era: the 340 America (4.1 litres) finished eighth in 1951 thanks to Luigi Chinetti/Jean Lucas then fifth in 1952 driven by André Simon/Lucien Vincent (also fielded by Chinetti). The suffix America – then Superamerica – was a designation for models specifically destined for the U.S. market keen on powerful cars. Though forced to retire in 1950, the 166 MM finished 16th in 1951 with at the wheel female duo Yvonne Simon/Betty Haig.\n\n1952-1954 | Scuderia Ferrari on the track\n\nIn 1950 and 1951, Ferrari was represented by private teams only at the 24 Hours. Until 1953, the lion's share was credited to Chinetti with around a dozen entries since 1949.\n\nThe situation changed in 1952 with the arrival of Scuderia Ferrari who fielded two cars: a 255 S Berlinetta (2.7 litres) for Pierre Boncompagni/Tom Cole, Jr. and a 250 S Berlinetta (3 litres) for Alberto Ascari/Luigi Villoresi. Neither made it to the chequered flag, but Ascari clocked the best in-race lap in 04:40.5 (173.159 kph). The following year, the Italian driver improved on his time by nearly 13 seconds (04:27.4 at an averyage 181.642 kph). Ascari was at the top of his game and on his way to two consecutive F1 world champion titles in 1952 and 1953.\n\nIn 1953, Ferrari entered three 340 MMs (4.1 litres), crossing the finish line for the first time with a factory car. Brothers Paolo and Giannino Marzotto placed fifth at the wheel of the only Ferrari under the chequered flag.\n\n1954 | Jaguar chases down the prancing horse\n\nFor its third official entry, three Ferrari 375 Plus cars took the start. They were a new evolution of the prestigious legacy that had begun in 1951 when the 375 earned the Italian marque's first win in Formula 1 thanks to Argentinian driver José Froilán González. Interestingly, only 11 road-ready 375 America coupés were produced.\n\nIn 1953, the 375 MM was built intended for competition racing. The next year, its engine was increased from 4.5 litres to 5 for the 375 Plus with spider bodywork, entrusted at the 22nd 24 Hours to Umberto Maglioli/Paolo Marzotto (#3), José Froilán González/Maurice Trintignant (#4) and Robert Manzon/Louis Rosier (#5).\n\nGonzález immediately grabbed the lead, quickly pursued by the Jaguar driven by Stirling Moss. They adopted a Grand Prix pace that decimated their competitors: during the first third of the race, nearly half of the 57 cars had already returned to their garages.\n\nFerrari and Jaguar did not make it out unscathed. Of the three cars fielded by each marque, only two remained contenders for victory after midpoint: the 375 Plus of González/Trintignant for Ferrari and the D-Type of defending winners Duncan Hamilton/Tony Rolt for Jaguar.\n\nTwo hours from the chequered flag, an ignition problem stranded the Ferrari in pit lane for seven minutes. Once back underway, the car led the Jaguar by only half a lap. Less than four kilometers separated the British car from the winning Ferrari at the finish line after more than 4,000 km covered at full speed. The highly aerodynamic Jaguar D-Type went on to win the next three 24 Hours, and Ferrari would have to wait until 1958 for its third victory.\n\nPHOTOS (Copyright - ACO Archives): LE MANS (SARTHE, FRANCE), CIRCUIT DES 24 HEURES, 24 HOURS OF LE MANS.
