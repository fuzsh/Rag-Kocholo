        "text": "Born in West Kensington, England, Stirling Moss is said to be the very best F1 driver ever who has never won a championship. He once told an interviewer that he had participated in 525 races overall, as many as 62 in a single year, in 84 different cars. Like many drivers of the era, he competed in several formulae - sometimes at the same time.\n\nStirling Moss was a pioneer in the British Formula One racing scene and placed second in the Drivers' Championship four times in a row from 1955 to 1958.\n\nRobert Michael Doornbos was born on September 23, 1981 in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Doornbos made his F1 debut as official test driver for the Jordan F1 Team prior to the 2004 Chinese GP. In 2005, Robert got the chance to replace Patrick Friesacher with the Minardi F1 Team for the last 8 races of the season. During the 2006 season, Doornbos got a contract with Red Bull as a test and reserve driver.\n\nBernard Charles \"Bernie\" Ecclestone (born in Ipswich, Suffolk, United Kingdom) is the president and CEO of Formula One Management and Formula One Administration, and owns a stake in Alpha Prema, the parent company of the Formula One Group of companies.\n\nHis early involvement in the sport was as a competitor and then as a manager of drivers Stuart Lewis-Evans and Jochen Rindt. In 1972 he bought the Brabham team, which he ran for fifteen years. As a team owner he became a member of the the Formula One Constructors Association."
