        "text": "Entrant in the 1954 and 1955 editions of the Mille Miglia – The most beautiful race in the world\n\nEntered by Scuderia Ferrari and raced by Works driver and Formula 1 World Champion Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina to outright victory in the 1953 12 Hours of Casablanca\n\nThe first of a mere 15 Ferrari 375 MM Pinin Farina Spiders built\n\nCampaigned with considerable success in Europe and North Africa from 1953–1955\n\nBoasting a clear and comprehensive history, as verified by the leading Ferrari historian Marcel Massini in his accompanying report\n\nAccompanied by copies of its original Ferrari factory build sheets\n\nAn open large-capacity V12-powered flagship 1950s Ferrari, eligible for the world’s most prestigious concours competitions and historic motorsport events\n\nIntroduced in 1953 as a means of keeping the mighty Mercedes-Benz 300 SLRs at bay, the 375 MM built on the success of the Mille Miglia-winning 340 models, Ferrari’s first production car to be powered by Aurelio Lampredi’s powerful long-block V12. The engine was enlarged to 4.5 litres in the 375 MM, raising power to a heady 340bhp. These ‘big-banger’ Lampredi-powered Ferraris really were the fastest cars on the road at the time, spearheading Ferrari’s assaults on all the greatest endurance races. And coupled with the efforts of Luigi Chinetti, who’d begun selling Ferraris across North America for the first time, the Prancing Horse was fast establishing itself as a purveyor of the world’s most exquisite motor cars.\n\nAs early Christmas presents go, we’re sure you’ll agree that a 1950s ‘big-banger’ 12-cylinder Ferrari would take some beating. The Italian mineral-water magnate, keen amateur racing driver and loyal Ferrari pilgrim Piero Scotti treated himself to such a gift in December of 1953.\n\nAmong Il Commendatore’s most significant early customers, he acquired this Rosso Corsa Ferrari 375 MM Pinin Farina Spider, the very first built – chassis number 0360 AM, directly from the factory. But rather than parking it beside the tree and waiting patiently for Christmas day, he decided to ship the car directly to Morocco, North Africa, and enter the 12 Hours of Casablanca.\n\nEntered under the Scuderia Ferrari banner and run with considerable support from the factory, chassis number 0360 AM was assigned the race number two. Given the factory’s involvement, Scotti was partnered with successful Works driver Giuseppe ‘Nino’ Farina, who’d famously won the inaugural Formula 1 World Championship for Drivers in 1950, racing for Alfa Romeo.\n\nBeneath the fierce Moroccan sun and against strong opposition from Jaguar, Aston Martin and Talbot, the Scotti/Farina 4.5-litre Ferrari quickly emerged as the class of the field. “Nothing could stop Farina and Scotti in the Ferrari, which went round and round with relentless speed and efficiency,” was how Autosport reported on chassis number 0360 AM’s performance. Sure enough, as the sun set and the chequered flag dropped, Scotti and Farina led the second-place Ferrari of Luigi Villoresi and Alberto Ascari home by some 40 kilometres. A memorable Christmas for Piero Scotti indeed.\n\nThe 340 MM remained in Africa into 1954, Scotti entering the Agadir Grand Prix in February and the Senegal Grand Prix in March, the latter of which he dominated to win. Upon returning the car to Europe in the spring, Scotti notched up another win on chassis 0360 AM’s record: this time the Coppa della Toscana. And he continued to compete for the remainder of the year, with a handful of further domestic victories. The strong performance of this 375 MM was clearly recognised in Maranello, for Scotti and the car featured in the 1954 Ferrari Yearbook.\n\nIn a bid to better his incredible second-place finish in the 1951 Mille Miglia, Scotti contested both the 1954 and 1955 editions of the world-famous Italian road race with chassis 0360 AM. The mid-1950s was truly the heyday for the Mille Miglia, which snaked its way from Brescia down to Rome and back and attracted the world’s biggest manufacturers and their squadrons of star drivers.\n\nThe motorsport world mourned Tazio Nuvolari in 1953, which prompted the Mille Miglia organisers to tweak the race route in order to encompass the Italian great’s hometown of Mantua. Incidentally, this notched the overall mileage to exactly 1,000 miles, as per the race’s name. There was also a significant change to the rules allowing a single driver to contest the entire race, rather than the traditional team of two.\n\nContext is useful at this point. Upwards of 11 hours solo driving, day and night, flat-out across an entire country, solely on public roads lined with hundreds of thousands of unobstructed spectators. Ludicrous.\n\nWith crucial experience in the race and his new 4.5-litre Ferrari in rude health, Scotti must have fancied his chances for the 1954 Mille Miglia. Part of the Works Ferrari assault, Scotti opted to capitalise on the rule change and ‘go it alone’. And, by all accounts, he made a searing start. In a field of 475 starters, Scotti had fought his way inside the top 10 by quarter-distance at Ravenna. And he continued to climb.\n\nRome marked the halfway point, some 540 miles into the race, and Scotti was sandwiched between two Works Maseratis in eighth position. As Marzotto’s Ferrari retired with gearbox trouble, Scotti was able to edge the number 546 375 MM up to third position by Florence. Alas, no sooner than a podium finish had been thrust into the realms of possibility, than it was cruelly snatched away. Scotti retired in the Apennines before Bologna – agonisingly close to the finish. What could have been…\n\nThe Mille Miglia in 1955, of course, witnessed the momentous record-breaking victory of Stirling Moss and Denis Jenkinson in the Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR. It was to be Piero Scotti’s final attempt at finally winning the ‘world’s most beautiful motor race’, once again with his trusty 375 MM. With the staggering rate of technological development in the mid-1950s, chassis 0360 AM simply no longer remained competitive. The Mille Miglia would evade Scotti for the rest of his days.\n\nAs this Ferrari was honourably retired after its remarkably successful competition career, so the car found its way across the Atlantic, passing through the hands of a small number of American owners until 1981, when it was acquired by the Pennsylvania trucking tycoon Len Rusiewicz. Painstakingly, over the course of the next 15 years and with the wholehearted support of his family, Rusiewicz returned what was a tired and forgotten but remarkably original Ferrari racer to its former glory.\n\nThe long and exhaustive project complete, Rusiewicz did exactly what we would have done and showed it proudly to the world. Between 1996 and 2004, 0360 AM starred at a plethora of prestigious North American concours, including the 12th Annual Reading Concours d’Elegance, where it was awarded ‘Best of Show’, and the Ferrari Club of America National Concours, where it was the recipient of the ‘Forza Ferrari’ award. This 375 MM was also profiled in an in-depth feature in a 1997 issue of Cavallino, a copy of which accompanies the car.\n\nFrom the outset, the onus was on originality and authenticity. The body, for example, is now indistinguishable from that in the photos of the car contesting the 1954 Mille Miglia with Piero Scotti – a tribute to the artisanal craftsmanship of Quality Cars’ ingegneri. Gnutti enjoyed almost a decade with chassis number 0360 AM, exhibiting the car in the ultra-prestigious Concorso d’Eleganza Villa d’Este and, satisfyingly, contesting the Mille Miglia Storico – over 60 years after it took to the starting ramp of the original version of the legendary Italian road race.\n\nThis 375 MM’s final – and current – owner, a prominent American Ferrari collector with a world-class stable of road and competition Prancing Horses, assumed custody in 2013. It has not been seen in public since.\n\nThen there’s its entirely clear and comprehensive history, as verified by the leading Ferrari historian Marcel Massini in his accompanying report. Three owners in the last 43 years should prove music to many collectors’ ears. Crucially, this history supports the remarkable originality of this 375 MM.\n\nFor us here at Girardo & Co., these attributes pale in comparison to the sheer grace and presence of this stunning Spider. The Pinin Farina-bodied 375 MM Spider is one of those cars that arrests your attention and holds it ransom from reality. It treads a fine line between masculine and feminine, with those not-so-subtle hints of its enormous power melded with those sultry and traditional Pinin Farina design cues. Chassis 0360 AM is nothing short of a masterpiece, worthy of a prime spot in Paris’s Louvre, Los Angeles’ Getty or New York’s Metropolitan.\n\nPrice Upon Application"
