        "text": "Another triumph in the Italian Grand Prix saw Red Bull's Max Verstappen remain in the form of his career, making it 10 straight F1 race victories as he closes in on a third successive World Drivers' Championship title.\n\nIn doing so he made history, and he'll now aim to go to double figures next time out in Italy on September 3.\n\nIn order to win multiple races in a row, drivers must have unwavering determination and a phenomenal amount of skill to achieve the feat. They're also heavily reliant on their teams to produce a car that's quick enough to sustain long periods of success and keep on top of upgrading it as efficiently as possible.\n\nIn this article, The Sporting News dives into the history books to answer the question of which driver has the most consecutive wins in Formula One history.\n\nMORE: F1 2023 calendar: Full list of circuits, contract lengths, fastest ever lap times\n\nWho has the longest winning streak in F1 history?\n\nMax Verstappen (10)\n\nRacing in front of his home crowd in Zandvoort is always a special occasion for Verstappen, but the 2023 Dutch Grand Prix will live long in the memory for the talented driver when he looks back on his illustrious career.\n\nVictory for the Dutchman saw him extend his lead at the top of the drivers' world standings and secure his ninth successive race win in the process.\n\nThat meant he equalled Sebastien Vettel's record of nine â€“ and he subsequently went top of this unique list on his own in Monza.\n\nSebastian Vettel (9)\n\nGerman driver and F1 fan favourite Sebastian Vettel currently holds the joint-record for most successive Grands Prix won in Formula One history.\n\nDuring the 2013 season, Vettel won nine consecutive races with Red Bull, starting at the 2013 Belgian Grand Prix and finishing with the Brazilian Grand Prix in the same season.\n\nThat streak helped him to record his fourth and final World Drivers' Championship title, all four of which came in succession between 2010 and 2013.\n\nTop 10 drivers with longest winning streaks in F1 history\n\nDriver Races Grand Prix 1. Max Verstappen* 10 Miami 2023 - Italy 2023 2.
