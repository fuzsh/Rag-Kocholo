However, the withdrawal of Alfa began a series of events that caused the FIA to decide to run the 1952 and 1953 World Championship for Formula 2 cars. Their motivation seems to have been that there weren't many competitive F1 cars available and the cheaper F2 cars would be more plentiful and allow the manufacturers to regroup and plan new cars for 1954. Obviously, Alfa didn't announce their withdrawal until after the end of the 1951 season, but I believe the FIA's decision may have come as late as sometime in 1952. Can anyone fix the date of the announcement that the 1952 WC would be contested by F2 cars. I have searched the archives and cannot find a specific reference. Many thanks.\n\nThis is indeed an interesting question, especially as the 212 was of course slightly over the 2.5 l limit.\n\nSome answers are Swiss \"Automobil Revue\", No 14/1951 (16th March 1951):\n\n\"News from Ferrari -\n\n[...] Enzo Ferrari is not completely enthusiastic about the new Formula that was recently proposed at Bruxelles, but at least he can agree with it. Of course he would have preferred a 2 litre forumla, but his successes with normally aspirated engines of 2 litres and more are a good starting point for him into the new formula.\n\nDespite the new formula 1 will be valid as late as in 1954 [b]as a test Ferrari has already increased one of his engines to 2.5 litres. With this Zurich Rudi Fischer took part in the Formula 1 race at Syracuse and achieved a respectable 3rd place in front of the 4.5 litre Talbots of Louveau and Rosier. This is not only an excellent performance by Fischer (who started the first time on a Ferrari), but alsso for that prototype engine. [...]\"\n\nInterestingly in the same issue there is also a photo of Serafini, who drove a 2.5 litre car in that race as well, but without being mentioned in the article.\n\nThank you for sharing this uechtel, interesting (Oh, and please check your PM).\n\nIn your own quote from Swiss \"Auto Revue\", you say that Ferrari produced this 2.5 or 2.6 litre engine \"as a test\". Presumably he was happy with its performance, and subsequently engines of 3.3, 4.1 and eventually 4.5 litres were produced. You could compare this with the development of the Coventry-Climax engines in 1957-58 with capacity increases from the original 1.5 Formula 2 engine, through 1750cc and 1960cc versions to the eventual 2.5 litre.\n\nThe different Ferrari engines were produced over a very short period of time in 1950, presumably part of a continuing design process, with the intermediate engine sizes representing stages in the process.\n\nWhich brings me to a pet peeve. All too often I find articles, authors, etc., who should know better, referring to the events of 1952 and 1953 as being \"F-1 World Championship\" events, which plainly they were not. Among the more egregious offenses was, of all publications, Motor Sport, which a number of years ago named the Ferrari 500 of 1952-53 as the 'greatest ever Formula One car' !! Oh for crying out loud! Talk about people who should know better! Not to mention the occasional reference to Alberto Ascari as being a 'two time Formula One Champion'. Sheer nonsense.\n\nTom"
