        "text": "Following Ferrari's announcement on Friday afternoon in Jeddah that reserve driver Oliver Bearman will be replacing Carlos Sainz for the remainder of the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, the 18-year-old will become the 12th British driver to race for the Scuderia.\n\nMany expected this to be Lewis Hamilton, following the confirmation last month that he'll be replacing silver for red in 2025. Instead, the seven-time World Champion is now set to become the 13th British driver to race for Ferrari next year.\n\nBut who are the previous drivers from the United Kingdom to race in F1 for the Maranello-based outfit?\n\nPeter Whitehead\n\nPeter Whitehead was the first Briton to compete for Ferrari, although he did not actually make the starting grid. Whitehead entered the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix as a Ferrari driver but failed to qualify for the race.\n\nMike Hawthorn\n\nMike Hawthorn is one of the most successful British drivers to have raced for Ferrari, having joined the Scuderia in 1953. Hawthorn won the French Grand Prix in his opening season for the Italians and went on to become the first British F1 World Champion five years later in 1958. He retired at the end of that season.\n\nPeter Collins\n\nPeter Collins was the third British driver to race for Ferrari and claimed three wins for the side, prior to sadly dying at the 1958 German Grand Prix. Collins death came just a matter of weeks after he claimed his final win for Ferrari, at the British Grand Prix that year.\n\nTony Brooks\n\nFollowing the deaths of Collins and Hawthorn, Tony Brooks found himself racing for Ferrari in 1959. Two wins that season put him in title contention at the finale in Sebring, however he lost the championship after deciding to pit following a collision with his teammate - Brooks' life meant more to him than the F1 title.\n\nCliff Allison\n\nCliff Allison's stint racing for Ferrari was a relatively short one, as he competed in only six races for the famous team. Allison's Ferrari career was cut short following a horrific accident in Monaco, where he was thrown out of his cockpit. He returned to F1 in 1961 in a privateer Lotus.\n\nJohn Surtees\n\nJohn Surtees' only F1 title in 1964 came whilst racing for Ferrari. The motorsport legend joined the Italians in 1963 and won the German Grand Prix in his first season for the team. In 1964, he collected the Drivers' Championship and secured two more victories along the way. He ultimately left the side though, at the conclusion of the 1966 season.\n\n© Photo4\n\nMike Parkes\n\nSurtees' replacement in 1967 was Mike Parkes, who claimed two non-championship victories. However, his F1 career ended abruptly at Spa-Francorchamps, following a leg-breaking accident.\n\nJonathan Williams\n\nJonathan Williams only every competed in one F1 Grand Prix, and that was the 1967 Mexican Grand Prix. Williams was more of a sports car driver, but Ferrari entered him into the Mexican GP. After finishing eighth, he was dropped for the 1968 campaign.\n\nDerek Bell\n\nDerek Bell made two F1 World Championship starts for Ferrari in 1968. His only F1 races in red were at the Oulton Park Gold Cup and the Italian Grand Prix. He left Ferrari ahead of the 1969 season but did later race for Ferrari again in sportscars.\n\nNigel Mansell\n\n20 years past before another British driver raced for Ferrari in F1, with that individual having been Nigel Mansell. Mansell raced for Ferrari across two seasons and claimed 11 podiums – including three victories – in total. He famously won on his debut for the team in 1989 at the Brazilian Grand Prix.\n\nEddie Irvine\n\nPrior to Bearman, the most recent Briton to have raced for Ferrari is Eddie Irvine He joined Ferrari in 1996 and was initially the team's number two driver alongside seven-time World Champion Michael Schumacher. However, he was suddenly the side's number one in 1999 when Schumacher broke his leg at Silverstone. In what was his final season with Ferrari, Irvine finished second in the 1999 standings."
