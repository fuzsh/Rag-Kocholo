        "text": "F1 Dutch Grand Prix 2024 | Zandvoort | Start times & schedule\n\nThe popularity of Max Verstappen surely meant it was only a matter of time before a race in the Red Bull driver's native country would be reinstated.\n\nHaving last held the Dutch Grand Prix back in 1985, the Zandvoort track has been newly configured in order to meet the demands of the modern Formula 1 car.\n\nThe result is a 14-turn 4.259km layout, which features two DRS zones as well as a number of banked corners and elevation changes, especially at the beginning of the lap.\n\nWhen is the 2024 Dutch Grand Prix on the F1 calendar?\n\nThe Dutch Grand Prix is scheduled to take place on the weekend of 23-25 August, and is set to be the 15th race of the Formula 1 season. The first two free practice sessions will be held on 23 August, with qualifying on Saturday 24 August at 14:00 BST.\n\nStart time of the 2024 Dutch Grand Prix\n\nThe Dutch Grand Prix starts on Sunday 25 August at 14:00 BST. The race can be followed live on RacingNews365's blog.\n\nTimetable Dutch GP\n\nSession Date Time Free practice 1 Friday 23 August 12:30 - 13:30 Free practice 2 Friday 23 August 16:00 - 17:00 Free practice 3 Saturday 24 August 11:30 - 12:30 Qualification Saturday 24 August 15:00 - 16:00 Race Sunday 25 August 15:00 - 17:00\n\nHistory of the F1 Dutch GP | Zandvoort\n\nLocated in the dunes of Holland's North Sea coastline, half an hour from Amsterdam, Zandvoort hosted minor races on street circuits in the 1930s.\n\nFollowing the Second World War, roads were widened and linked together and, as a result, a circuit was designed. Initially attributed to the efforts of John Hugenholtz, the decision was undertaken by the Royal Dutch Motorcycle Association on advice from Sammy Davis, who had won the 1927 24 Hours of Le Mans.\n\nThe first race took place in 1948 under the name of the Zandvoort Grand Prix, with Thailand's Prince Bira taking the chequered flag. Louis Rosier won in 1950 and 1951, while the Dutch Grand Prix finally became part of the F1 World Championship in 1952.\n\nAlberto Ascari won that year, as well as taking victory at the race in 1953. The event wasn't held in 1954, 1956 and 1957 owing to financial issues, with Mercedes dominating in 1955 with their drivers Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss.\n\nJim Clark won on four occasions in the 1960s (1963, 1964, 1965 and 1967) while driving for Lotus. The 1970 Dutch GP was won by Jochen Rindt in a Lotus, but the race is remembered for Piers Courage's accident. Driving the Frank Williams Racing car, the Briton crashed and was killed after a wheel came off and hit him on the head. With Courage still in the car, it caught fire and burned to the ground.\n\nRedeveloped Zandvoort circuit\n\nAlthough the Dutch GP was initially included in the 1972 F1 calendar, drivers refused to race at Zandvoort given that the facilities and circuit had fallen out of date.\n\nExtensive modifications were made as a result, including the building of a new pit lane, and this resulted in a positive atmosphere when Formula 1 returned in 1973.\n\nUnfortunately things went very wrong on race day, with disorganisation and a lack of clear communication contributing to the events of that day. Roger Williamson, in what was his second F1 race, crashed heavily near Tunnel Oost, with his car catching fire while scraping along the tarmac.\n\nThe Briton was unable to free himself from the car, which resulted in David Purley stopping alongside him to turn the burning March over. Try as he might, Purley wasn't able to do much, while the marshals - who weren't wearing flame retardant overalls - weren't able to help either due to the intense heat.\n\nRace control assumed it was Purley's car that had crashed and that he had escaped unharmed, while fellow drivers failed to stop as they didn't know that a second car had been involved. Williamson died from asphyxiation.\n\nPurley was awarded a George Medal for his actions, while Tyrrell driver Jackie Stewart won ahead of teammate Francois Cevert.\n\nJames Hunt claimed his first F1 win at the 1975 Dutch Grand Prix, while Mario Andretti's last victory in the series came at Zandvoort in 1978.\n\nAlain Prost kicked off a run of four straight wins for French drivers in 1981, with Didier Pironi, Rene Arnoux and Prost, again, taking the chequered flag in the years that followed. Niki Lauda won in 1985, the race's final running after track owner CENAV went out of business.\n\nF1 Dutch GP returns to the calendar\n\nOn 14 May 2019, it was announced that Formula 1 would return to Zandvoort for the 2020 season.\n\nUnfortunately that return was pushed back, as the race was postponed and later cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe Dutch Grand Prix finally made its return to Zandvoort in September 2021, much to the delight of Max Verstappen's fans.\n\nMost successful F1 drivers and teams\n\nJim Clark leads the way in terms of wins in the Netherlands, having been victorious at the Dutch GP on four occasions. He is followed by Jackie Stewart, Max Verstappen and Niki Lauda, who each have three wins.\n\nIn terms of constructors, Ferrari top the list with eight victories to their name, followed by Lotus on six and McLaren and Red Bull on three wins.\n\nThe 2023 Dutch Grand Prix\n\nGiven the light rain, all drivers, except Hamilton, started on the soft compound. Max Verstappen, starting from pole position, had an incredibly good start, allowing him to pull away immediately. Additionally, many overtaking maneuvers took place in the opening lap. However, the rain intensified, prompting drivers like Sergio Perez, Charles Leclerc, Zhou Guanyu, Yuki Tsunoda, Kevin Magnussen, and Pierre Gasly to dive into the pit lane to switch to the intermediate compound. This proved to be the right choice, as the drivers on intermediates were much faster than those who hadn't made a pit stop. Eventually, the rest of the field also went in to switch to the intermediate tires, giving the drivers who had already pitted in the first round a significant lead.\n\nDrivers Alexander Albon, Oscar Piastri, Valtteri Bottas, Nico Hulkenberg, and Logan Sargeant, however, decided to stay on the soft compound. They closed in on the field in rounds eleven and twelve as the track had dried considerably. As a result, drivers on intermediates made a pit stop to switch back to slicks. During these pit stops, Max Verstappen executed an undercut, regaining the lead from the Mexican. In round sixteen, Logan Sargeant hit the wall hard at the exit of the Marlborobocht. A restart followed, bringing the field back together.\n\nLater, heavy rain resumed, causing all drivers to switch back to the intermediate tires. Conditions were challenging, and many drivers overshot turn one. Zhou Guanyu couldn't bring his car to a stop in time for the Tarzanbocht, crashing hard into the wall and necessitating another race restart. Ultimately, Verstappen won the race, Fernando Alonso finished second, and Pierre Gasly claimed third place. Perez narrowly missed the podium due to a five-second time penalty.\n\nThe Zandvoort Grand Prix of 2024 undoubtedly promises to be a great spectacle."
