        "text": "Grand Slam = Grand Chelem = Pole, win, fastest lap, and having led every lap\n\nTo date, only 26 drivers have secured a Grand Slam. There have only been 66 in total.\n\nJuan Manuel Fangio took the first Grand Chelem in a Formula One World Championship race at the 1950 Monaco Grand Prix. It was only the second World Championship race. Jim Clark has the record for the most Grand Slams, with eight, amazingly all achieved in a 32-race period that spanned just over three years!\n\nJim Clark, Sebastian Vettel, and Max Verstappen are the only drivers to achieve a Grand Slam in three consecutive years. Additionally, Jim Clark and Max Verstappen now hold the distinction of being the only drivers to accomplish this feat for four consecutive years: Clark did so from 1962 to 1965, and Verstappen achieved it from 2021 to 2024."
