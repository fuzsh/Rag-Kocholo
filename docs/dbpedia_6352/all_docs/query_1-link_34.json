        "text": "Early History\n\nThe McLaren team was formed in 1963 by Bruce McLaren under the name Bruce McLaren Motor Racing. The team debuted in the 1966 Monaco Grand Prix and won its first Grand Prix in 1968 in Belgium.\n\nThe Scuderia Ferrari team was founded by Enzo Ferrari in 1929. It was the official racing team of Alfa Romeo. After WWII, Ferrari began designing and building its own cars. The first Ferrari car was constructed in 1947, and it was entered in its first Grand Prix in 1948.\n\nBest Years\n\nMcLaren dominated both the constructors’ championships and the drivers’ championships in the 1980s and early and late 1990s. The team’s first win was in 1974, in both constructors’ and drivers’ championships. They next won the drivers’ championship in 1976, and then won both awards again in 1984, 1985, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991 and 1998. They also won the drivers’ championship in 1986 and 1999. The team last won in 2008.\n\nScuderia Ferrari is the only team to have competed in every season of the Formula One World Championship, from the first in 1950 to the present day. Ferrari won several drivers’ championships in the 1950s (52, 53, 56, 58) and in 1961, 64, 75 and 79. In 2000, Michael Schumacher was the first World Driver’s Champion for Ferrari in 21 years. He won again in 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, where Ferrari won first and second place, and also the constructors’ championships. Ferrari also won both the drivers’ and constructors’ championships in 2007 with Kimi Raikkonen.\n\nCurrent Team\n\nMcLaren is currently managed by Martin Whitmarsh, with Paddy Lowe and Neil Oatley as the technical directors. Its race drivers are Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton, with Garry Paffett and Oliver Turney working as test drivers.\n\nFerrari is currently managed by Stefano Domenicali, with Pat Fry as the chassis director. Its race drivers are Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa, with Davide Rigon as the reserve.\n\nRecords\n\nMcLaren currently hold the record for fastest stationary pit stop in motor racing.\n\nFerrari holds many records in Formula One, including most constructor championships (16), most driver championships (15), most Grand Prix participated (849), most wins (219), most podiums (664), and most fastest laps (227).\n\nGreatest Drivers\n\nThe greatest McLaren drivers include Alain Prost, Ayrton Senna, Mika Hakkinen, James Hunt and Lewis Hamilton. Prost also drove for Ferrari. The most popular and successful Ferrari drivers include Michael Schumacher, Rubens Barrichello and Fernando Alonso.\n\nMcLaren vs Ferrari F1 Cars\n\nHere are some pictures of McLaren cars. They are often red and white.\n\nFerrari's Formula One cars have a trademark blood red color. Here are some pictures:\n\nFamous Crashes\n\nIn 1970, June Bruce was killed in a crash at Goodwood. He was testing a new car at the time. In 1978, Ronnie Peterson was killed in a crash at the Italian Grand Prix.\n\nIn 1957, Ferrari driver Eugenio Castellotti crashed into the crowd at the Mille Miglia. Twelve people died, and Ferrari were charged with manslaughter. In 1961, Wolfgang von Trips crashed at the Italian Grand Prix and was killed, along with over a dozen spectators. In 1967, Lorenzo Bandini crashed at the Monaco Grand Prix and was trapped under a burning car. He died several days later. Team leader Villeneuve also died during the Belgian Grand Prix in 1983.\n\nReferences"
