        "text": "Luigi Musso is a character example of the dangers of 1950s F1 racing.\n\nTragedy leads to F1 break\n\nOne of the older Ferrari drivers of the late 1950s, Luigi Musso, began racing in F1 in 1953. He had been a factory Maserati driver, finishing third in the Targa Florio and competing in the Mille Miglia in the same year. Not much else is known about his background.\n\nHe made his F1 debut at his home Grand Prix in 1953 as a reserve driver who shared a drive with Sergio Mantovani to finish seventh in their Maserati A6GCM. Musso would replace Onofre Marimon following his death in Germany in 1954. He shone, finishing second in his race as a replacement in Spain.\n\nMusso qualified seventh, making him the third of ten Maserati’s in the field. He overtook Fangio during the race due to the retirements of the likes of Alberto Ascari, Harry Schell, Luigi Villoresi and Stirling Moss.\n\nMusso raced his first full Grand Prix season in 1955 and delivered. He scored a podium in Zandvoort and was on par with teammates Jean Behra and Roberto Mieres throughout the season. He finished the year tied on points with Behra and one point behind Mieres.\n\nAfter qualifying best of the rest as it was – behind the Mercedes trio of Fangio, Moss and Karl Kling, Musso sat in fourth, kept on the lead lap and took his opportunity when Kling spun out of the race on lap 21.\n\nIt was a measured drive from the mercurial Italian. In Britain, he qualified only ninth, being beaten by fellow Maserati’s Andre Simon and Jean Behra. However he finished in a solid fifth, behind the four Mercedes cars of Moss, Fangio, Kling and Piero Taruffi. Out of the seven Maserati’s, he was the only driver to finish within 90% of the race distance.\n\nThe Ferrari class of 1956\n\nFerrari took notice and sought to hire him in 1956 to replace Maurice Trintignant. He had three world-class teammates in 1956: Juan Manuel Fangio, Peter Collins and Eugenio Castellotti.\n\nNow, Musso had a car that could win the Grand Prix. In Argentina, he started well by qualifying third behind Castellotti and Fangio. He ran in the points during the early stages of the race behind Castellotti, José Froilán Gonzalez, Carlos Menditeguy, and Musso.\n\nHis teammate, Fangio, had retired with a faulty fuel pump, so he swapped with Fangio but couldn’t manage a lap in Fangio’s car. He let Fangio stay in the car, and he, Fangio, passed Behra, capitalising on Menditeguy, Moss, and Castellotti’s retirements to win. Thus, Musso would take his only Grand Prix win.\n\nIn Monaco, he and Harry Schell crashed out of the race after trying to avoid hitting Fangio, who had hit the straw bales. He would miss the next three Grand Prix in Belgium, France and Britain due to an injury following a sports car accident at the Nurburgring.\n\nReturning to the F1 circuit at the Nurburgring, he qualified fifth and ran at the back end of the points until he gave his car to Eugenio Castellotti, who then crashed out of the race. Musso could have played an important part in the season finale in Italy.\n\nHe battled with Moss for the victory but was told by Ferrari to let Fangio take over his car, but he refused. Fangio did not realise it then, but this would be a blessing in disguise, as Musso would retire near the end with steering failure. At the same time, Fangio and Collins shared a car to second, winning Fangio his fourth world championship ahead of Collins.\n\nTragedy ends a promising career\n\nNow it was 1957, and pressure was on Musso, having been no higher than eighth in the driver’s championship during his F1 career. 1957 proved Musso’s talent as a dependable, consistent driver as he had two fantastic races in France and Britain, where he comfortably finished second as the best Ferrari.\n\nAnother fourth-place finish in Germany meant that by the end of the season, Musso had amassed 16 points, enough to put him a fantastic third in the standings, ahead of teammates Mike Hawthorn and Peter Collins.\n\n1958 was the year it seemed Musso would win the title, starting the season brilliantly with two second-place finishes in Argentina and Monaco. A poor spell would follow, however, finishing two laps down at the Dutch Grand Prix and crashing on the fifth lap of the Belgian Grand Prix. Heading into the French Grand Prix, he was third in the standings, two points behind teammate Mike Hawthorn, and Moss, who was five points ahead.\n\nUnder pressure due to debts arising from a rivalry with Collins and Hawthorn, Musso pushed over the limit to try and win the Grand Prix, which gave a big prize pot. Sadly, he would die after hurtling off course on lap nine of the race, which threw him out of the car after crashing into a ditch. He was 33.\n\nMusso could have most definitely won the world championship in 1958, but never got to, and finished eighth in the standings despite missing five races. His forecasted points total by season’s end would have been at least third."
