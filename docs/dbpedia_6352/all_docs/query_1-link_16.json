        "text": "Quick and eager, Franco Cortese was a notable Ferrari driver and will always be remembered as ‘the first one’.\n\nIn hindsight, driving for Ferrari might just be his proudest achievement.\n\nItalian racing mogul\n\nBorn in 1903 in Oggebio, Italy, Franco Cortese started his professional racing career aged 24. He entered the first edition of the Mille Miglia driving an Itala 61. Together with his teammate M. Baroncini, he finished 8th. Cortese would go on to finish the tough race 14 times, a record that still stands as of today a record that technically still stands today, as the event hasn’t been held since 1957.\n\nFranco Cortese in the Alfa Romeo 6C 2300 (1938).\n\nOther big achievements before teaming up with Enzo Ferrari include podiums in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and first places in the Coppa Acerbo. He also got to drive early Alfa Romeo and Maserati cars, helping to establish the young automakers.\n\nIn 1936, Cortese founded Scuderia Ambrosiana together with fellow Italian racing drivers Giovanni Lurani, Eugenio Minetti and Luigi Villoresi. They raced in blue and black, inspired by the colours of Inter Milan. In the early years, the team primarily drove the Maserati 6CM but were never able to win a race. Their first race win came in 1946 when they drove a Lancia Astura to a first place in Modena. A one-time Formula 2 entry was realized in 1951 at the Italian Grand Prix of Monza, but their used Ferrari 166 F2 was unable to complete the race.\n\nA surprising Targa Florio victory came in 1951 when the team entered a Frazer Nash into the Italian endurance race. Franco Cortese drove the British car to first place with an average speed of 76.5 kph (47.5 mph).\n\nPiacenza 1947\n\nFranco Cortese already raced with Scuderia Ferrari in 1935, where he drove an Alfa Romeo 6C 2300 together with Francesco Severi to an 8th place result. Then, in 1947, when Enzo Ferrari decided to start a racing company under his own name, signing Cortese was rather big news. He was a big driver back then, with a large racing record. Another selling point for Enzo was the fact that Cortese helped sell machine tools that the Ferrari factory built during the Second World War. The decision was made definite after Cortese won the 1946 Egyptian Grand Prix, beating the almighty Alberto Ascari.\n\nFerrari sent a contract Cortese’s way in April 1947 and offered him a seat in the upcoming Ferrari 125 S. He signed it and the rest is history…\n\nScuderia Ferrari built and prepared the Ferrari 125 S for a race in Piacenza, Italy, on 11 May 1947. The team’s initial plan was to enter with two cars, but after the second driver, Nino Farina, refused to race, only one Ferrari was used.\n\nCortese’s misfortunes in the race began almost immediately, as the car could not reach it maximum potential due to an overfilled sump. He pulled into the pits and his team drained the excess oil. He then re-joined and was gaining speed and positions until a broken fuel pump forced Cortese to retire the race altogether.\n\n1947 Rome Grand Prix\n\nJust two weeks later, Ferrari was back on track. The team entered the Roma Grand Prix and Franco Cortese was back behind the wheel of the Ferrari 125 S. It went better than expected, and Cortese completed 40 laps with an average speed of 88.5 kph (55 mph) and ultimately achieved Ferrari’s first victory.\n\nA week after this victory, Cortese and his team entered the car in a race in Vercelli and won again. Four races (a first place, a second place and two DNFs) would follow before Ferrari updated the 125 S and named it the Ferrari 159 S. The car was fitted with a larger engine and minor visual changes. Cortese drove the car to a second finish in its first race at Pescara, trailing only Vincenzo Auricchio in his Stanguellini.\n\nCortese as Ferrari driver\n\nCortese’s focused then briefly switched to other automakers, such as Frazer Nash, Alfa Romeo and Fiat, before fully returning to the Prancing Horse in 1953. His first drive back with Maranello was in a Ferrari 250 MM with Bruno Sterzi. The pair finished 8th during the 10 Hours of Messina.\n\nA Ferrari 250 MM, similar as to what Cortese drove.\n\nLooking at his racing record, it could well be that he preferred driving open-top cars because his subsequent entries were either in the Ferrari 166 MM or the 500 Mondial.\n\nCortese during testing of the Ferrari 500 TR.\n\nHe won the 1956 Italian 2.0-litre sports car championship in a Ferrari 500 TR, with three race wins. His last race was in October 1958 at Innsbruck, Austria, piloting his Ferrari to a 7th place finish. In total, he entered 58 races with a Ferrari, and below is a complete overview of those entries.\n\nDate\n\nEvent\n\nCar\n\nResult\n\n14 April 1935\n\nMille Miglia\n\nAlfa Romeo 6C 2300\n\n8th\n\n11 May 1947\n\nPiacenza\n\nFerrari 125 S\n\nDNF\n\n25 May 1947\n\nRome Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 125 S\n\n1st\n\n1 June 1947\n\nVercelli\n\nFerrari 125 S\n\n1st\n\n15 June 1947\n\nVigevano\n\nFerrari 125 S Corsa\n\nDNF\n\n29 June 1947\n\nVarese\n\nFerrari 125 S Corsa\n\n1st\n\n13 July 1947\n\nParma\n\nFerrari 125 S\n\n2nd\n\n20 July 1947\n\nFlorence\n\nFerrari 125 S Corsa\n\nDNF\n\n15 August 1947\n\nCircuito di Pescara\n\nFerrari 159 Spyder\n\n2nd\n\n24 August 1947\n\nLivorno\n\nFerrari 125 S\n\nDNS\n\n28 September 1947\n\nModena\n\nFerrari 159 C\n\nDNF\n\n4 April 1948\n\nTarga Florio\n\nFerrari 125 S\n\nDNF\n\n2 May 1948\n\nMille Miglia\n\nFerrari 166 S\n\nDNF\n\n1 August 1948\n\nAosta\n\nFerrari 166 SC\n\n5th\n\n15 August 1948\n\nCircuito di Pescara\n\nFerrari 166 S\n\n5th\n\n20 March 1949\n\nTarga Florio\n\nFerrari 166 MM\n\nDNF\n\n24 April 1949\n\nMille Miglia\n\nFerrari 166 SC\n\nDNF\n\n2 June 1949\n\nRome Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 166 SC\n\n3rd\n\n11 September 1949\n\nItalian Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 166 F2\n\nDNF\n\n26 July 1953\n\n10 Hours of Messina\n\nFerrari 250 MM\n\n8th\n\n9 August 1953\n\nCircuito di Senigallia\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n1st\n\n15 August 1953\n\n12 Hours of Pescara\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n3rd\n\n23 August 1953\n\nTrullo d'Oro\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n2nd\n\n9 September 1953\n\nSupercortemaggiore Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\nDNF\n\n4 April 1954\n\nGiro di Sicilia\n\nFerrari 500 Mondial\n\nDNF\n\n11 April 1954\n\nCoppa della Toscana\n\nFerrari 500 Mondial\n\n19th\n\n2 May 1954\n\nMille Miglia\n\nFerrari 500 Mondial\n\n14th\n\n16 May 1954\n\nNapoli Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 500 Mondial\n\nDNF\n\n22 May 1954\n\n3 Hours of Bari\n\nFerrari 500 Mondial\n\n3rd\n\n30 May 1954\n\nTarga Florio\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\nDNF\n\n13 June 1954\n\nCircuito di Caserta\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n3rd\n\n20 June 1954\n\nImola Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n8th\n\n4 July 1954\n\nCidonio Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n2nd\n\n25 July 1954\n\n10 Hours of Messina\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n6th\n\n8 August 1954\n\nCircuito di Senigallia\n\nFerrari 166 MM/53\n\n5th\n\n10 June 1956\n\nOpatija\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n1st\n\n17 June 1956\n\nCircuito di Caserta\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n1st\n\n24 June 1956\n\nIV Gran Premio Supercortemaggiore\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n11th\n\n15 July 1956\n\nCircuito di Reggio Calabria (Handicap)\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\nDNS\n\n15 July 1956\n\nCircuito di Reggio Calabria (S2.0)\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n2nd\n\n22 July 1956\n\nBari Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n6th\n\n29 July 1956\n\nGiro delle Calabria\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n7th\n\n18 August 1956\n\nPescara Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n4th\n\n26 August 1956\n\n5 Hours of Messina\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n4th\n\n30 September 1956\n\nCircuito di Sassari\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n1st\n\n21 October 1956\n\nRome Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n6th\n\n4 November 1956\n\nVenezuela Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n11th\n\n14 April 1957\n\nGiro di Sicilia\n\nFerrari 250 GT\n\n-\n\n9 June 1957\n\nMonsanto\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n9th\n\n11 August 1957\n\nSwedish Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 500 TRC\n\nDNS\n\n1 December 1957\n\nEsso Vallelunga\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n15th\n\n13 April 1958\n\nCoppa Shell Monza\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n5th\n\n27 April 1958\n\nNapoli Grand Prix\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n6th\n\n11 May 1958\n\nTarga Florio\n\nFerrari 500 TRC\n\n7th\n\n15 May 1958\n\nAspern\n\nFerrari 500 TRC\n\n2nd\n\n6 July 1958\n\nCircuito di Sassari\n\nFerrari 500 TR\n\n4th\n\n20 July 1958\n\n10 Hours of Messina\n\nFerrari 500 TRC\n\n-\n\n5 October 1958\n\nInnsbruck\n\nFerrari 500 TRC\n\n7th\n\nSource: Wikipedia\n\nCortese’s later life\n\nAfter retiring from racing, it’s said Franco Cortese became an advisor for car component manufactures.
