Over two decades before its first Formula 1 Grand Prix, Scuderia Ferrari is formed to help amateur drivers compete in an assortment of races. Founder Enzo Ferrari had competed in Construzioni Meccaniche Nazionalizi and Alfa Romeo cars previously.

The 1950 Monaco Grand Prix was the first Championship race for the Italian auto manufacturer. Ferrari holds the distinction of being the oldest and most successful Formula 1 team and has competed in every championship since 1950. The team has secured 242 wins, 238 pole positions and 259 fastest laps.

Ferrari secured its first ever Grand Prix win at the 1951 British Grand Prix held in Northamptonshire, England. The race was the fifth of the championship and Jose Frolian Gonzalez was in the driver’s seat. The team also enjoyed its first pole position the same weekend.

Racer Alberto Ascari helped Ferrari secure the first of back-to-back titles in 1952. Following a 1953 win by Ascari, Ferrari took a backseat until 1956 when Juan Manuel Fangio returned the team to the top. Mike Hawthorn also secured a title in 1958.

During the 1952 and 1953 seasons, Formula 1 cars used F2 rules, and Ferrari hit the track with the Tido 500. The car is one of the most famous Ferrari racers and helped Alberto Ascari win seven Formula 1 races in a row, a record that would stand until 2013.

The Constructors’ Championship started in Formula 1 in 1958. By 1961, Ferrari was ready to claim the title for the first time and won a double championship with both a team and drivers win. Ferrari has gone on to win a total of 16 Constructors’ Championships as a team – 25% of the overall prizes.

The Fiat group purchased the Ferrari company in 1969, but it took eight years for the company’s logo to make it to the racing cars. Ferrari was historically sponsorship adverse and generally limited logo placement on its vehicle to technical partners.

Over a 10-year period, Michael Schumacher became the most successful Ferrari driver of all time, and it started with his 1996 season for the team. With Schumacher at the helm and advancements in car formulas, the team entered a highly successful period widely believed to the best years for the racing team to date.

After spending 22 years backing McLaren, Phillip Morris International via brand Marlboro signed a title sponsorship agreement with Ferrari. From 1997 to the 2011 European Grand Prix, the company was part of a revised team name, Scuderi Ferrari Marlboro. After regulatory changes regarding tobacco advertisements, Phillip Morris Mission Winnow project logso were used by Ferrari and the team’s name in 2019 was briefly Scuderia Ferrari Mission Winnow. By 2021, the Mission Winnow sponsorship was done.

After over 15 years of back burner enthusiasm for Ferrari cars, the team brought forth its best competition in years, the Ferrari F399. At the Australian Grand Prix in 1999, a 3.0 litre V10 helped power the car to its first Grand Prix win. Six GPs were won during the season, and Ferrari drivers reached the podium 18 times. Ferrari earned its first Constructors’ Championship since 1983 this year.

2004 was a banner year for the Scuderia Ferrari team. Michael Schumacher excelled in the season, securing his fifth championship with Ferrari in Belgium. It was Schumacher’s seventh championship overall, but his winning a fifth with Ferrari was a new record for a driver-team. The same year, Ferrari’s other driver, Rubens Barrichello secured two Grand Prix wins and Schumacher won thirteen, helping Scuderia Ferrari win 15 of 18 GPs overall.
