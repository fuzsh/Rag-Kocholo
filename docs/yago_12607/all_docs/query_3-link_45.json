She has been portrayed by Farah Fath since October 24 2007. [ [http://abc.go.com/daytime/onelifetolive/episodes/2007/20071024.html OLTL recap 10/24/07 - abc.com] ]\n\ntoryline\n\nGigi is first introduced as a waitress at the Bon Jour Café in Paris, Texas who constantly argues with diner owner Moe Stubbs. She has a son named Shane and has difficulty making ends meet. Not realizing that co-worker Viki Davidson is wealthy and is only working as a waitress to temporarily escape her life in Llanview, Pennsylvania, Gigi tells Viki her dreams of becoming rich. Viki tells Gigi that rich people have problems too.\n\nGigi often tells Shane stories of his father, a Navy SEAL that died heroically serving his country. The more she continues to tell this story, the more it seems that it is not quite true. Because of her troubled past as a single mother, Gigi is eager to help when she meets fugitive Marcie McBain (using the name \"Sally Ann\"), who is on the run with adopted son Tommy (whom she calls \"Billy\"). At first Gigi believes that \"Sally\" is running from an abusive husband, but soon discovers differently when Tommy's father Todd Manning comes to the Bon Jour looking for his son. Todd offers $1 million for information on Marcie's whereabouts; feeling loyalty towards \"Sally Ann,\" Gigi says she had seen them three days previously and that they were heading towards South America.\n\nGigi continues to help Marcie and gets her a waitressing job at the Bon Jour as \"Sally Ann\". More of Gigi's mysterious past comes to light when Rex Balsom shows up at the Bon Jour. Gigi and Rex dated during their senior year in high school, but Rex abruptly disappeared in 2002 when he left for Llanview to reunite with his adoptive sister Natalie Buchanan. Gigi clearly has unresolved issues with Rex, but hides them and later refrains from telling him \"something\" that she feels he needs to know. Rex has come to town searching for Marcie, but Gigi again lies and sends Rex on the wrong trail. Rex also unwittingly buys Marcie's engagement ring from Gigi, which Marcie is anxious to sell for cash.\n\nWhen Marcie's ring is recognized back in Llanview, Michael and John McBain race back to Paris to confront Gigi. But Todd Manning and renegade FBI agent Lee Ramsey are already there, having taken Gigi and Shane hostage. Ramsey forces Gigi to lure Marcie back to Gigi's apartment before she and Tommy can skip town, and threatens her at gunpoint. Marcie arrives at Gigi's place, but at the last moment Gigi screams for Marcie to run. Ramsey and Todd pursue Marcie, and Gigi and Shane are rescued by the McBain brothers. On January 11 2008, Gigi is arrested for aiding and abetting a fugitive during Marcie's standoff with the police and FBI at the Bon Jour Café. Viki pays Gigi's bail, and the charges are ultimately dropped."
