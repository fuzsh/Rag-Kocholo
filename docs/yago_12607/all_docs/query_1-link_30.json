        "text": "One Life to Live is a daytime Soap Opera that premiered on ABC in 1968.\n\nThe series originally focused on the wealthy Lord family and the blue-collar Riley family of Llanview, Pennsylvania. Heiress Victoria Lord (played by Erika Slezak since 1971) became the centerpiece of the show, later marrying into the Buchanan family, which has served as the series' core ever since. Over the years, Viki has suffered breast cancer, heart disease, a stroke, being shot, and most famously, Dissociative Identity Disorder.\n\nThe late 1980s brought a series of outlandish storylines. Viki's near-death experience took her to heaven, depicted as a spaceship inhabited by her departed relations. In 1988, Clint Buchanan fell off a horse and was transported to 1888, where he met his own ancestors, all lookalikes of his 1988 family. Most infamously, in 1989, several characters became trapped in Eterna, a secret city inside a mountain. In 2008, to celebrate the show's 40th anniversary, they 'revisited' two of these storylines. Viki again suffered a near-death experience, but this time Heaven was more like an office building, where she was taken by elevator to be briefly reunited with friends and loved ones. Show creator Agnes Nixon also made an appearance during this segment. In addition, Bo Buchanan (Clint's younger brother) and his nephew Rex Balsom were struck by lightning and transported back in time to 1968's Texas, where everyone believed that Bo was actually his father Asa and that Rex was actually Bo.\n\nIn the early 90s, OLTL returned to more socially-conscious storytelling. One story told of a gay teen who confronted homophobia in Llanview. Another featured Marty's brutal gang rape at a fraternity party. This story introduced OLTL‍'‍s most controversial character, Todd Manning, who led the gang rape. Much like Luke Spencer on General Hospital, the character was kept on the show due to female fans' attraction to him. Todd was discovered to be a long-lost Lord heir, and became a central character, driving away many viewers.\n\nCreated by Agnes Nixon, OLTL shared its universe with Nixon's other soap, All My Children, and has had many crossovers with same, most recently a baby-switch story in 2004. One Life to Live aired its last episode on January 13, 2012, and the characters of John McBain and the Mannings migrated to General Hospital.\n\nTropes used in One Life to Live include:\n\nAB Negative: Tina and CJ, among others.\n\nAbsurdly Youthful Mother: Greg has to be at least in his early 40s to have been a practicing neurosurgeon for as long as he's explicitly stated to have been. The actress playing his mother is in her mid/late 40s. And he has a 15 year old sister, who's actually Greg's daughter.\n\nArmored Closet Gay: Daniel Colson.\n\nThe Baby Trap: Stacy to Rex.\n\nBig Fancy House: The Buchanan mansion, Llanfair and La Boulaie.\n\nBig Screwed-Up Family: Several. But notably the Lords, the Cramers and the Buchanans.\n\nBitch in Sheep's Clothing: The main character Viki's dad, Victor Lord. Originally seen as simply a domineering and Overprotective Dad during his original run on the show, it was revealed in the 1990s, presumably after his death, that he was a pedophile who molested Viki as a child. He briefly was revealed to have had his death faked in the early 2000s with Mitch Laurence's assistance, before dying again, during which we got to see the real Victor Lord in all of his ugly True Colors.\n\nBound and Gagged: Hardly uncommon on any soap, but a notable example came in 2003 with Mitch's kidnapping of Blair, who is next seen tied up in her underwear while Mitch calls her husband. She spends a good part of the following episode tied up and blindfolded.\n\nThe Cast Showoff: Several actors on One Life to Live. For instance, the original actor who played Jessica, Erin Torpey, has a nice singing voice, so they had Jessica in a band at one point, and also had her sing on a few other occasions. Evangeline Williamson got to sing a lot in the show, because her actress Renee Goldsbury is a real life singer/song writer, and was on a Broadway musical. And Blair Cramer, is also shown singing on a number of occasions, because Kassie De Paiva is a singer and has albums out.\n\nCliff Hanger: Victor Lord, Jr. is still alive and is somehow being held by Allison Perkins.\n\nConvenient Coma: Evangeline Wiliamson. Went into a coma for three years after being exposed to a gas leak. She soon went off life support.\n\nCrossover: Mostly with All My Children, but with other ABC soaps as well.\n\nDamsel in Distress: Natalie used to often suffer from this back in the day, to be saved by John. This has not happened so much recently, however.\n\nDowner Ending: Bobby Ford and Cole Thornhart are fighting to get out of Heaven to be with their loved ones, Bobby does the chivalrous thing and lets go on to other side. But as soon as Cole and Starr arrive in Port Charles, they get in a car accident and Cole and Hope are killed.\n\nDynamic Entry: Shaun comes to save Starr, Hope, and Todd from drug dealers. This is also a Crowning Moment of Awesome.\n\nExcept the actor who plays Shaun sucks and his delivery of the line was more like \"I'm Shaun\" which didn't sound right and wasn't as cool.\n\nAnother example occurred when Sam burst into a hotel room where Echo had been holding Dorian hostage, in a Spider Man costume, and taking Echo down with toy web shooters. Did we mention the kid is seven?\n\nEarn Your Happy Ending: In 2001, Jessica Buchanan's life got flipped turned upside down. First, Allison claims she returned the wrong baby after baby Jessica (Natalie) was kidnapped. Then it's revealed Jessica and Natalie are half twins when it was discovered her father was Mitch Laurence and not Clint Buchanan. Then after developing DID to repress childhood sexual abuse, her alter falls in love with a man and gets pregnant by him, just as she comes around to loving the guy... he dies in a freak accident. That freak accident was caused by her aforementioned twin sister's deception. She lapses into her DID again and imprisons her sister, and she's pregnant again. Unfortunately this baby doesn't survive, so ANOTHER alter steals her teen cousin's baby. Eventually, the ruse is lifted and she loses another child. She gets institutionalized (a recurring theme) and finds love with another crazy. Mitch escapes and fucks that up by erasing her mind to when she was a teenager. Her new beau can't cope and thus sleeps with said twin sister. She comes back though... mid coitus with the town pervert who impregnates her. Despite this she attempts marry him, until the ugly truth comes out. You guessed it, DID time. She hooks up with the town pervert and begins to like him, but Jessica takes over again and it's square 1. Just as Jessica and the town pervert begin to fall in love, Mitch returns and kills HIM, somehow a DNA test is found and it's revealed that Clint's her biological father all along. Did I mention she lost a kid before all this too?\n\nEvil Old Folks: Victor Lord was one very vicious old man. Also, Echo Disavoy.\n\nFlashback with the Other Darrin: Lampshaded when during ex-husband Asa's \"funeral\" Blair (played by a Caucasian actress) flashbacked to her own wedding to Asa... which occurred when Blair was being played by an Asian American actress. Cue the confused look into the make-up compact.\n\nHannibal Lecture: Mitch is the master of this. Everything he does is passive-aggressive, which makes him all the scarier.\n\nHurricane of Puns: Justin greeted Matthew's return to school with a hurricane of Incredibly Lame Puns (including one on the figurative and literal meanings of the word \"lame\"); think Ignore the Disability done deliberately."
