        "text": "John-Paul was raised in the main filming location town of the 1958 sci-fi flick \"The Blob.\" He spent a great deal of time during his childhood and young adult years performing magic tricks and playing the drums for almost anyone that would watch or listen. Him and his bunny rabbit could be spotted on any weekend day at a kids birthday party, and the drum set would appear the evenings at a coffee shop or banquet venue. With no other dreams or abilities to consider, and fueled by his love for Rush, he moved to center city Philadelphia after high school to study jazz performance at The University of the Arts. During his second year enrolled he learned about his love for films and realized Manhattan was only about 100 miles away where he could toss his luck at acting.\n\nAlmost immediately after landing in NYC John-Paul began booking gigs of all sorts. Student films, print ads, extra work (union card!), small venue theatre shows, infomercials, even a romance novel cover, all while paying the rent via mainly waiting tables at The Russian Tea Room. After calling his basement 1 bedroom in Astoria, Queens home for about a year he auditioned for ABC's \"One Life to Live\"..........five times. Then they chose him. He played \"Rex Balsom\" on that show for 10 years non-stop until the network canceled it in 2011.\n\nJohn-Paul has lived in Los Angeles since 2012 and spends much of his time reading novels, exercising, golfing, and hosting the occasional poker game. He can often be found running the paved roads of Beverly Hills or doing his best to keep up with maintaining friendships."
