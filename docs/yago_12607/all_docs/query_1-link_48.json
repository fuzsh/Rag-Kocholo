        "text": "OLTL Year in Review\n\n2010 in Llanview has come to a close and as we look towards 2011 let’s take a look back at what happened this year. 2010 brought us the reunion and wedding of a longtime fan favorite couple, the death of one of the most hated characters to ever step foot in Llanview, the introduction of a family of himbos, a man who was apparently responsible for all the crimes in Llanview (and I don’t mean Mitch Laurence), and a mass cast exodus of complex characters played by talented actors. 2010 in Llanview also taught us to get 4th and 5th opinions from doctors, that enemies can become friends, it taught us how not to use air quotes, and that your brother can turn out to be your father and he probably killed your mother. So now let us explore the Best and the Worst of OLTL 2010.\n\nBest Story\n\nBo and Nora Reunite and Get Married. After leaning on each throughout 2009 during Matthew’s paralysis, surgery, and recovery, Bo and Nora finally got their act together and decided to give their romance another try. After he was shot by SuddenlyPsychoSchuyler, Bo asked the big question and Nora said yes. They got married in the most hilarious, over-the-top wedding in recent memory which ended with my favorite couples’ montage of 2010 set to Cheap Trick’s “The Flame”.\n\nRunner Up: Viki and Dorian Team Up to Take Down Echo.\n\nWorst Story\n\nTeen Jess. I don’t even know where to begin with this trainwreck of a story. Jessica reverted back to 17 because her psychopath bio father gave her electro shock therapy and then tried to rape her. Teen Jess then spent the next few months running around Llanview acting like a lovestruck idiot which Real Teen Jess never was. It made Clint and Viki look like the worst parents in the world for allowing their mentally ill daughter to run around town and stalk her long-ex-boyfriend, neglect her daughter, and be a general annoyance to viewers. Jessica finally got her memory back and re-entered 2010 after Himbo #1 decided that having sex with a mentally ill woman (and possibly knocking her up) was a great idea. The story was horrible and whoever thought it would be a good idea should never be allowed to write again.\n\nRunner Up: Rex and His Never-Ending, Highly Annoying Search for His Parents.\n\nBest Recast\n\nTom Degnan as Joey Buchanan. I was initally skeptical when I learned that Tom Degnan had been cast as Joey because his performance on ATWT as the final Adam Munson didn’t exactly wow me but I soon realized that Degnan’s performance on ATWT was mainly due to horrible writing and the awful character destruction done previously to the character of Adam. So far Degnan has been doing a good job which in no small feat considering Nathan Fillion was the last actor to play Joey. Plus there is the added funny bonus of Terri Conn playing his girlfriend on OLTL when she previously played his aunt on ATWT.\n\nRunner Up: Gina Tognoni as Kelly Cramer. Not technically a recast because Tognoni was the first Kelly Cramer but since the character was last played by Heather Tom then in falls under the recast category.\n\nWorst Recast\n\nBilly Warlock as Ross Rayburn. This may actually be one of the worst recasts in the history of OLTL. The role of Ross was originally played by Shawn Christian in 2002 who now plays Dr. Daniel Jonas on DOOL and was recast in 2009 with Michael Lowry. I’m not trying to be mean here but Billy Warlock is much shorter than Lowry which was well…just plain old bad. Kassie DePaiva is a very tall woman and trying to watch scenes between Blair and Warlock’s Ross was just painful. Blair could have squashed this version of Ross with her shoe. And to make matters even worse was the fact that Ross’ brother was being played by the much taller Matt Walton. I bought Lowry and Walton as brothers but Warlock and Walton as brothers wasn’t believeable and I didn’t buy it. Next time you recast a character OLTL make there isn’t such a large height difference.\n\nRunner-Up: None because unless I’m forgetting someone then there were no more characters who were recast in 2010.\n\nBest Twist\n\nAllison Perkins is Dr. Joplin’s Sister. The reason I made this the Best Twist was because it was the only thing this year that I didn’t see coming and it wasn’t in any of the spoilers. I was as shocked as poor Schuyler was at the news that Allison and the late doctor were related. Note to OLTL: Come up with better plots twists because it’s sad when this is the best plot twist all year.\n\nRunner-Up: Ummm…I’ll let any readers out there make their own suggestion for Best Twist.\n\nWorst Twist\n\nClint is Rex’s Father (and Echo is His Mother). So in 2009 we finally (or so we thought) learned that Mitch Laurence was Rex’s father. Except it turned out that Schuyler was really Roxy and Mitch’s child and Rex was just an abandoned baby that Allison took from the hospital and gave to Roxy telling her that it was Roxy’s son. Then Rex learned he was half-Native American (I giggled for weeks at this one) through a boring and contrived “adventure” story with the albatross of OLTL aka Rex and Gigi. But wait…no…Rex isn’t Native American because the letters he found that were written between his parents were fakes. The story behind his mother’s half of the necklace…also fake. It turns out that Clint Buchanan masterminded these fake parents for Rex because…well he doesn’t want Rex for a son (not that I can blame him). Echo is Rex’s mom and to keep Clint from throwing his own son in jail she lied to Charlie and told him that he was Rex’s father. Yeah that’s a nice game to play with a recovering alcoholic who just buried a son a year ago.\n\nRunner-Up: Inez Salinger is the mother of Ford and James. She must have had Ford when she was 10.\n\nBest Death\n\nStacy Morasco Sinks to Her Icy Grave. In proving that TIIC do sometimes listen to viewers, they finally answered the prayers of many viewers by dropping this horrid character into an icy lake. Death isn’t supposed to be funny but somehow OLTL managed to make Stacy’s death completely hysterical. Fish and Rex made the lamest attempt ever at trying to save Stacy from becoming a popsicle and Stacy finally sunk down to her watery and cold grave.\n\nRunner-Up: Nothing even comes close to the amazingness of Stacy’s AboutFreakingTimeDeath.\n\nWorst Death\n\nEddie Ford Becomes Llanview’s Newest WhoDunit. After being on the show for around a month TIIC decided to kill Eddie off to give us a whodunit starring the Himbo Family. Ummm…I don’t really care who killed Eddie unless it was one of the himbos and they get sent to jail and removed from my screen. I’m just mad that Eddie didn’t get to kill off one of his himbo sons before biting the bullet.\n\nRunner-Up: Elijah Clark is Killed By Cole Thornhart…While in Police Custody.\n\nBest Descent into Madness\n\nDr. Marty Saybrooke. Things started to go down hill with Marty after Eli shoved her down the stairs and caused her to lose her baby. Then John left her and went back to Natalie who ended up pregnant. As if this wasn’t enough, Cole kills Eli and is sent to jail. Marty had attempted to take the fall for Cole’s actions but Natalie found evidene pointing to Cole and Cole wouldn’t have let her anyway. Marty swore revenge and discovered that John might not be the father of Natalie’s baby and she was able to get proof (presuambly anyway) that Brody is the father of Natalie’s baby. And Natalie isn’t the only one at the receiving end of Marty’s wrath…if I was Todd Manning I would be sleeping with one eye open. As a good girl and victim Marty isn’t a good character but as a scheming, revenge seeking loon Marty is just made of awesome. Keep it up Marty!\n\nRunner-Up: Clint Buchanan as Asa Jr.\n\nWorst Descent into Madness\n\nElijah Clark as the Evilest Evil Who Ever Eviled. One day Eli is a lawyer who is in love with Blair and the next day he’s a mustache-twirling, serial kiling, super villian. Eli pushed Marty down the stairs because…ummm…actually I’m not sure why. Eli bashed Ford’s skull in because…ummm…not sure about that one either. Everything else he did was because of money but considering the elaborateness of his plan you would think it probably would have been easier for him to rob a bank to get the money.\n\nRunner-Up: Schuyler Joplin Becomes a Gun-Toting Loon and Shoots Bo.\n\nBest Couple\n\nViki Lord Banks and Charlie Banks. I find Viki and Charlie to be the most realistic and relatable couple on OLTL. The struggles they faced following Jared’s death and now with Echo come off as very real and raw. I just hope that Echo doesn’t do too much damage and her presence is just another bump in the road for this couple.\n\nRunner-Up: Bo Buchanan and Nora Hanen Buchanan.\n\nWorst Couple\n\nLangston Wilde and Robert Ford. Ford is a slimeball who liked sleeping with barely legal teenagers and mentally ill women. Langston cheated on Markko who walked out on his family for her with the Lead Himbo. Langston is a freshman in college while Ford is a professor at the same college. Their relationship is beyond gross and makes Langston look like a pathetic idiot.\n\nRunner-Up: Rex Balsom and Gigi Morasco.\n\nMost Improved Actor\n\nShenell Edmonds as Destiny Evans. Edmonds was very green when she started and it showed. But with working with experienced actors and probably taking acting classes she has remarkably improved the the past year. Her scenes where she learned that Greg was her father were amazing and I totally felt and bought her pain of being lied to her entire life.\n\nCharacter That Has Run His/Her Course\n\nTodd Manning. Todd started out as a frat boy who led the gang rape on Marty Saybrooke. Todd was originally highly complex and completely screwed up character who had been abused by his psychotic adoptive father. The Todd I see today on my screen is still a little screwed up but there is nothing complex about him at all. He is nothing but a schoompy, emo podd of a formally great character. I’m tired of seeing Todd pout and shout empty and lame threats. Trevor St. John looks bored and seems to be sleeping through all his scenes that I’m beginning to think he is just as bored and over the character as I am. Either transform Todd back into what he originally was after the gang rape or get rid of the character because schoompy and love sick are not characteristics of the Real Todd Manning. (Note: I do not mean bring back Roger Howarth for the record. Just fix the character).\n\nMost Over-Used Plot Device\n\nCharacters Going Crazy. Mitch, Allison, and Stacy were already loons but Schuyler, Hannah, Greg, Eli, Marty, Cole, Jessica, Eddie, and Clint all lost their marables in 2010 (although in Jessica and Cole’s case they’ve always been a little nutty). That is way too much crazy on one show. If I want to see a bunch of nut jobs then I will watch Criminal Minds.\n\nBiggest WTH? of 2010\n\nCasting Jessica Leccia as Inez Salinger. If they wanted Inez to be Ford and James’ mother in addition to Nate then they should have cast an older actress. Leccia is 34-years-old and David Gregory (Ford) is 25. I do not buy them as mother and son. Brother and sister…sure. Leccia’s Inez should have been James and Ford’s sister who ran away from their abusive father because she was a pregnant teen. It would make me buy Inez as Nate’s mom and be much more believable. And casting 55-year-old John Wesley Shipp as Eddie Ford did not help either.\n\nI was not very fond of OLTL in 2010 and I hope in 2011 that won’t be the case. 2010 started out shaky then went from bad to worse and towards the end of the year started to find it’s footing again. I hope the upward trend continues so I will be able to watch on a more regular basis because I really do miss watching the show everyday. So here’s to hoping that 2011 in Llanview will be a lot better than 201o.\n\nOLTL Spoiler Commentary for the Week of October 25th\n\nSpoilers Courtesy of:\n\nSoap Opera Network\n\nwww.soapoperanetwork.com\n\nSoap Opera Source\n\nwww.soapoperasource.com\n\nOn Wedneday, October 27th, OLTL will air an encore episode: #10415 (original air date 4/16/09)–Todd and Tea have sex all over his house while saying they hate each other. Tea tells Todd she never intended to help him get custody of his kids. Natalie and Jared hide the truth about Chloe while the family gathers for Chloe’s baptism. At Nash’s grave, Jessica tells Brody they can’t be friends right now. Starr and Cole discuss her attraction to Schuyler, realize Hope didn’t die because of RH disease. Markko tells Langston he helped Cole fake his drug test.\n\nGreg confesses that he killed Destiny’s mother.\n\nPoor Destiny. Her brother is her father and he killed her mother. In other words, she’s a typical soap teen.\n\nFord is told he has internal injuries from the beating he received from Clint’s thugs.\n\nIs it wrong to chant DIE Ford DIE?\n\nEli detonates the bomb, resulting in the warehouse erupting in a huge explosion.\n\nThis already happened but I’m guessing they will repeat it on Monday.\n\nMarty attends to Dani who was knocked out in the explosion.\n\nWhen she comes to can she be mute?\n\nWhen Dani regains consciousness, she reveals to Natalie that Tea is in the warehouse.\n\nThis is the first thing she should have done when Eli released her.\n\nHannah confesses to James that she is holding Starr and Hope hostage, and then takes him captive as well.\n\nDoes Hannah have super powers? James is wuss if he can’t take on Hannah.\n\nHannah leads the teens to a cemetery, where she hands Starr and James shovels and orders them to dig their own graves.\n\nBet it never occurs to either of these idiots to use the shovels on Hannah.\n\nCole is hit with a burning beam while searching for Starr and Hope.\n\nBurning building 1. Cole 0.\n\nCole points the gun at Eli and shoots him in cold blood.\n\nI’m guessing Cole goes to jail when Brandon Buddy exits. Maybe he can be cell mates with Schuyler.\n\nMarty finds Cole holding a gun, and promptly orders him to flee the scene.\n\nMurder cover-ups rarely work. Ask GH’s Michael.\n\nMarty is then arrested when she tells police that she is the one who shot Eli.\n\nWonder if she will use the fact that Eli murdered her unborn child as her defense.\n\nNatalie finds Cole’s fingerprints on the gun.\n\nGeez, Marty. Wiping down the gun is How to Cover Up a Crime 101.\n\nLangston tells Cole that she believes Hannah has Starr and Hope.\n\nIf only she had told him before he offed Eli.\n\nBo leads the search for survivors of the blast.\n\nBo playing the hero? This is OLTL right?\n\nTéa and Blair are trapped in a storm drain, as are John and Todd, however the ladies are separated from the men by a wall of debris.\n\nBlair and Tea should just leave those two down there.\n\nTodd is fo rced to take dramatic steps to save John’s life.\n\nI’m sure Todd pouts a little before he does it.\n\nTodd comes face-to-face with Tea.\n\nI’m guessing this is after Wednesday’s special repeat highlighting how they are the greatest love EVA!\n\nCharlie isn’t happy to learn Viki is still investigating Echo.\n\nYour wife investigating your ex is never fun.\n\nClint learns that his private investigator retrieved the half heart necklace from Lily’s grave before Rex could get to it.\n\nWhat the heck is Clint up to? Although screwing with Rex is always fun times.\n\nNo Clink! But Lots of Boom!\n\nEvil Eli’s plan went up in smoke, literally today. After gagging, Tea and DanYella (bless his heart for that), he takes DanYella outside with a gun pointed at her and reminds John and Todd that he’s in charge. He also manages to find time to flirt with Blair. He wants Blair to get in the van that is waiting for him and threatens to blow the warehouse up if anyone follows them. Now Blair who isn’t exactly known for following directions(one of the many reasons that she’s awesome), sneaks out of the van to find her girls but she finds something else instead:\n\nYep, Blair got the shock of her life when she found NotDeadTea. Blair informed her former enemy that the warehouse was rigged with a bomb so they needed to get out there fast. Tea told Blair that she doesn’t think Starr and Hope are there.\n\nNatalie arrives at the scene and tells Brody that she needs to talk to John now. Brody won’t let her cross the tape because it’s too dangerous and instead of Natalie telling Brody that Tea is alive she argues with him about it. Seriously, Natalie? Which is more important: you telling John that Tea is still alive instead of Brody or protecting your unborn child from a raging psychopath? Brody tells Natalie that he couldn’t handle it if something happened to her and her baby and Marty overhears! Brody goes to tell John about Tea and Marty asks why Natalie’s baby means so much to Brody. Good soapy drama.\n\nSpeaking of soapy drama…Greg finally confesses that he was helping Eli because Eli was blackmailing him. Both Shaun and Destiny can’t believe what he’s done and wonder what is so awful that he would help Eli. After arguing with his parents, they finally all tell the truth. Mr. and Mrs. Evans explain to Destiny they are not her real parents. Destiny is confused and says “I’m adopted?”. Shaun doesn’t understand why Greg would hurt Tea just to keep Destiny from finding out she’s adopted. Mr. and Mrs. Evans tell Destiny that she’s not adopted but she’s still their flesh and blood. Shaun and Destiny are like WTH? And finally Greg spits out that he’s Destiny’s father! There has to still be more to this because hiding Destiny’s parentage is still not a good enough reason to help a psychopath. And major kudos to Shenell Edmonds for these scenes. She did a great job of showing Destiny’s shock and disbelief.\n\nBlair works to free Tea so they can get the heck out of dodge. Eli releases DanYella as his hostage and hops in the van to discover Blair is not in there. Todd asks DanYella if she’s okay and instead of telling Todd that Tea is alive she just stares off into space. Brody arrives to tell John about Tea but is interrupted by an enraged Eli. Eli tells Todd, “Hey Manning, if I can’t have my wife, you can’t have yours either”. DanYella runs back to the warehouse for Tea and Todd chases. Everyone ducks as Eli detonates the bomb. I think Todd went flying and Bo and Brody held back Cole.\n\nOther things that happened:\n\nLangston and Himbos 1 and 2 staked out Marty’s house waiting for Hannah the Crazy Banana to make a move. I kept hoping that Hannah would come out and shoot them all.\n\nHimbo #1 coughed up blood due to his earlier butt kicking courtesy of Clint. The idiot that he is Ford refused to go to the hospital until Langton and James made him. Call me crazy but if I’m hacking up blood I’d be more concerned with getting medical treatment then spying on a nutcase but that’s just me.\n\nGigi (who was wearing a hideous plastic headband) and Cristian talked about art and their distant (geographically that is) loves and I didn’t beat my head on my desk.\n\nClint and Matthew had a meeting of the Asa Jrs. Club.\n\nHannah continued to be an awesome gun toting loon. Although her and Evil Eli have disappointed me by not taking out the Fords.\n\nAnd I must confess that I totally loved today’s show. Either it was really good or my threshold for good soap has been lowered. Of course compared to that mess that is GH it was really good soap. Yeah I’m gonna go with my threshold for awesomeness has been significantly lowered."
