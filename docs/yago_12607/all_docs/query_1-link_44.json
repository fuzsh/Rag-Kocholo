        "text": "Tuesday, June 8, 2010 at 12:30 AM ET by Scotty Gore\n\n(SoapOperaNetwork.com) — The latest buzz for “One Life to Live.”\n\nSoap Opera Digest reports that John-Paul Lavoisier (Rex) recently signed a new four-year deal with the show. Lavoisier joined the cast in 2002.\n\nSean Ringgold (Shaun) will lend his voice to upcoming new “Smurfs” feature film. He will voice the character of “Bubba.” Filming began on March 26th, and a release date has been set for July 29, 2011. “Day one Shooting the Movie ” SMURFS” Playing the Role of BUBBA. Very Excited to be working with Hank AZARIA. I think all the kids will get a good laugh. I have to thank all my supportive FaceBook Family who always show love. You have no idea how much your words inspire me to keep pushing Forward. Bless You All,” Ringgold comments on his Facebook page. The cast also includes Neil Patrick Harris as Johan, Katy Perry as the voice of Smurfette, Hank Azaria as Gargamel and Paul Reubens as the voice of Jokey Smurf, among others.\n\nEven though he has only appeared in two episodes thus far, many “OLTL” fans are bombarding the net with petitions wanting to see more of Max Tapper and the character of Detective Price. But is more of the newcomer on the way, or have we seen the last of Llanview’s newest cop?\n\nTerrell Tilford (Greg) seemed a little less than thrilled on his Twitter page on Monday evening, tweeting that he “Just found out I’m shooting tomorrow…someone screwed-up MAJORLY!!! I have 15 scenes to shoot and JUST got the script….I’m grateful, but PISSED!!!!”\n\nSteph Garcia comments on her web site that she “Filmed another episode [as a Buenos Dias Waitress] of One Life to Live to air July 22nd!”\n\n“One Life to Live” has released more information regarding a recent audition script for a “Private Investigator.” The soap is looking for an African-American actor in their mid-30s for the recurring role, which is described as “charming, good looking, and extremely successful.”\n\n“OLTL” Music Director Paul Glass tweets that song at the end of the June 1st episode was Keane’s “My Shadow.”\n\nAnd former “One Life” star Danneel Harris (ex-Shannon) married her boyfriend Jensen Ackles (ex-Eric, “Days of Our Lives”) were married on May 15th in Dallas.\n\n“One Life to Live” airs Weekdays on ABC. Weeknights on SOAPnet. Anytime on ABC.com and SOAPnet.com. Check local listings."
