        "text": "Over the past few weeks, One Life to Live fans have been watching the story unfold and masterfully written as Rex Balsom is faced with a horrific decision.. to give his father, Clint Buchanan, the man he hates the most in this world, the heart of his beloved Gigi Morasco, who lies brain-dead in the hospital, thanks to the skullduggery of Jack Manning. As Rex struggled with the decision and yet was defiant at the same time that he would not allow Clint to have his much-needed heart transplant, he came to realize that he had no money and no power to fight the Mannings, once Todd got Jack off the hook for Gigi’s death. So he had to come up with a plan.\n\nFans have watched as John-Paul Lavoisier gave great performance after great performance, and truly the finest moments of his soap opera acting career. He made all of us at home, just want to reach out to Rex and give him a hug! JP’s Rex valiantly tries to hold it together for his son, Shane, while at the time crumbling with the unfathomable loss of the woman he was about to marry.\n\nBut it was on yesterday’s episode that he made us all grab for the hankies as we witnessed the sad ending of the long-storied romance of Rex and Gigi. JP Lavoisier was magnificent as he had to say goodbye to the woman he loves as it was time for her to be taken into surgery to remove her heart and give it to Clint. For this, On-Air On-Soaps has named John-Paul Lavoisier this week’s Power Performance of the Week. And we also applaud everyone else in this storyline – namely, Austin Williams as Shane for his heartbreaking final scenes with his mother, and Farah Fath as Gigi for the beautiful moments where she dances with Rex as closure for the duo. And we would be remiss without mentioning the fantastic Jerry verDorn, who has made Clint through all of his heinous acts someone we don’t want to see kick the bucket, either!\n\nKudos to OLTL for soap opera at its best, and to you, Mr. Lavoisier! Watch the heart-tugging moments and this week’s Power Performance here!\n\nOn Monday, during a press conference held by Los Angeles County prosecutors, two of the four suspects in the death of Johnny Wactor (ex-Brando Corbin) have now been officially charged with the murder of the beloved General Hospital actor.\n\nThe charges were announced by L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón and interim police chief Dominic Choi. The suspects charged with Wactor’s murder are Robert Barceleau and Sergio Estrada, both 18.\n\nThe most serious charge is for Barceleau, who was charged with murder, including a special circumstance allegation of killing in the commission of a robbery, which could lead to a life-without-parole prison term. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both with allegations he was armed with a firearm.\n\nEstrada, was also charged with murder, but without the special circumstance allegation. He was also charged with attempted robbery and grand theft, both also allegedly while armed with a firearm. Estrada is also facing a life sentence.\n\nThe two other suspects were also formally charged, Leonel Gutierrez, also 18 was charged with attempted robbery and grand theft by embezzlement, both with allegations he was armed. Meanwhile, Frank Olano, 22, was charged with being an accessory after the fact to the killing, along with receiving stolen property and three counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Barceleau, Estrada and Gutierrez remain in custody in lieu of $2 million bail each, while Olano must post a $1 million bail.\n\nWactor was killed May 25 in the early morning hours in downtown Los Angeles after his shift as a bartender at the Level 8 bar/restaurant. He, and co-worker, Anita Joy were walking to their cars, when Wactor came upon the thieves trying to steal the catalytic converter from his vehicle and was shot in the chest and died in Joy’s arms.\n\nSo, are you glad Johnny’s murderers have been officially charged? Share your thoughts via the comment section below. But first, you can check out the press conference from Fox 11 Los Angeles.\n\nOn Sunday, the world learned of the passing of veteran actor, John Aprea who died back on August 5th at the age of 83.\n\nAprea appeared on Another World in two roles throughout his career – Lucas (Luke) Castigliano from 1989 to 1993, and Alexander Nikos from May 1997 to January 1998.\n\nIn story, Lucas was one of the loves of Felicia Gallant’s (Linda Dano) life. They shared a daughter that was put up for adoption when they were younger, who was later revealed to be Lorna Devon played by Alicia Coppola.\n\nOn Monday, August 19th, following the news of his death, both Linda and Alicia shared their remembrances of their time working with the talented actor.\n\nLinda Dano took to her Instagram and expressed, “As many of you already know my dear friend John Aprea passed away on August 5th…out of respect to his wife Betsy I waited until the family released there statement.. before I posted anything.This has been a very difficult time…I loved him so…The kindest sweetest funniest man.I believe he is now in Heaven with all of his old friends and of coarse ,my Frank…God has his hands full!!!Bless you John …I miss you ❤️”\n\nAlicia Coppola shared on her Instagram: “Now I have two fathers in heaven.

Hope you, my daddy and Frankie are giving God a run for His money. With beer, blonds with big boobs. Xoxo”\n\nCoppola appeared as Lorna from 1991-1994, while Linda Dan0 played Felicia from 1983-1999 and until AW’s final episode.\n\nDo you remember Alicia, John and Linda’s scenes together from ‘Another World’?
