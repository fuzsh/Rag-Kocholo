        "text": "Soap fans first got acquainted with John-Paul Lavoisier when he portrayed Rex Balsom on One Life to Live; a role he played from 2002 till the show last aired in early 2012.\n\nSeveral years later, Lavoisier returned to the world of daytime drama when he was a recast in the role of Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow) and Victor Kiriakis’ (the late John Aniston) son, Phillip Kiriakis. JP initially took on the role of DAYS Phillip from 2015-2016. When the show brought back the character the next time in 2020-2021, it was played by Jay Kenneth Johnson, who was best-known in the role. Now in 2023, it’s Lavoisier who makes a comeback in a limited run beginning the week of August 28th on the Peacock streaming soap opera.\n\nSpeaking with Soap Opera Digest (in their latest edition on newsstands now), John-Paul shared a few of his reactions to learning Phillip’s latest back-story (as his character returns Salem at pivotal time for Victor’s memorial), and his thoughts on getting the call to reprise the part in the first place; especially when DAYS let him go during his first run with the series.\n\nLavosier noted on learning the Phillip has been faking his own death and framed Brady (Eric Martsolf) for murder, “I have to say I was shocked. I was like, ‘Oh, my God. This is crazy. This is wild. This is unforgivable.’ But as an actor you have to commit to this, you have to fall in love with it, and it’s real.”\n\nAfter receiving several messages from the Days of our Lives brass attempting to track him down to reprise Phillip, it truly caught Lavoisier off-guard: “I was incredibly shocked and flattered that I was being considered to be an employee of the show again, because the last time I was there they let me go. I kind of felt they had me there, they were done with me, the end.”\n\nAccording to Lavosier, he taped 13 episodes of Days of our Lives during this most-recent return.\n\nSo, looking forward to seeing John-Paul as Phillip Kiriakis, and how his arrival might shake up the canvas? Comment below.\n\nThe week of August 19-23 brings with it some highly-anticipated returns and familiar faces on your favorite soap operas. Top of the list is Rick Hearst, who makes his first appearance as Ric Lansing on General Hospital in over 8 years on the ABC daytime drama series.\n\nBack on July 25th, viewers learned Hearst was back playing Molly’s (Kristen Vaganos) father, and Sonny’s (Maurice Benard) half-brother, much to the delight of fans of the 61-year old show.\n\nWith Ric being a lawyer, and all the issues centering around Kristina (Kate Mansi) crashing through a window and losing the baby she was carrying meant for Molly and TJ (Tajh Bellow), it will be interesting to see how Ric is anchored into the story. Heart’s first run as Ric was from 2002-2009. His second run in Port Charles was from 2014-2016.\n\nIn addition on GH, ‘The Deception’ crew visit Home & Heart, and will deal with none other than Debbie Matenopoulos who plays the Home & Heart producer. Matenopoulos was the former co-host, along with GH’s Cameron Mathison, of Hallmark Channel’s talk show, Home and Family.\n\nParry Shen is also making a return to GH as Brad Cooper. Shen was last seen on the show back in March of 2023.\n\nOver on The Young and the Restless, Linden Ashby is back haunting, taunting or commiserating with Sharon (Sharon Case) as uber-villain Cameron Kirsten on the Friday, August 23rd episode of the CBS daytime drama. Look for Linden to keep popping up as Sharon’s mental stability continues to be out of whack.\n\nLily Brooks O’Briant (Lucy) is also on-screen in two episodes on the Tuesday August 20th and Wednesday August 21st episode as the troubled teen shares some scenes with Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott).\n\nIn addition, longtime beloved Y&R fan favorite, Christian LeBlanc (Michael Baldwin) is back on-screen. Tina Huang will be seen as Melinda Trask on Days of our Lives on the Monday, August 19th episode in scenes with serial killer, Connie played by Julie Dove. Over at The Bold and the Beautiful, Naomi Matsuda is back on as Li, who is at the epicenter of the murders of Tom and Hollis.\n\nSo, who are you most looking forward to coming on to your favorite soaps this week? Comment below.\n\nDays of our Lives is bringing back another fan favorite for episodes airing in 2025, and under the new head-writing regime of Paula Cwikly and Jeanne Marie Ford.\n\nNow comes word from Kyle Lowder via his Instagram story on Monday, that he is back taping all new episodes at the DAYS studios in Burbank as of August 12th.\n\nLowder shared from his car, “I’m back in a very familiar place today, and tomorrow, and the next day. Give you a hint … I’m in Burbank at a studio. I’ve been doing this a long time, but it’s been a minute! I’m excited.”\n\nSoap Opera Digest confirmed that indeed, Rex Brady will be back on the canvas in 2025. The DAYS spokesperson shared. “It’s true! Rex is in Salem, we’ll just have to see what brought him back …next spring.” The last time viewers saw Rex was in 2023.\n\nLowder has a long and storied past with Days of our Lives having originally joined the show as the singing Brady Black back in 2000. He continued to play the part till 2005. However, when the show wanted to bring Lowder back, Eric Martsolf was firmly in the adult-version of Brady, so the show cast Kyle as one of the ‘Gemini Twins” and brought him back as a recast, Rex Brady for a run in 2018-2019. Since that time, Kyle has portrayed Rex in other stints in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nSince exiting DAYS in 2023, Lowder became a morning anchor for the CBS affiliate KTVN in Reno, Nevada. Part of the impetus for his move from Los Angeles was to be closer to his daughter, Isabella, whom he shares with former DAYS star and ex-wife, Arianne Zucker (ex-Nicole). Being in the Lake Tahoe/Reno area is also where Zucker and fiancé, Shawn Christian (ex-Daniel, DAYS) share a home as they get closer to their official wedding date.\n\nSo, why do you think Rex Brady is returning to Salem in the spring of 2025? Comment below.\n\nThe week of August 12-16th on Days of our Lives will see a shocking accident that will have quite the fallout. In the recently released preview for the action in Salem, with Brady (Eric Martsolf) presumably passed out drunk in the backseat of a car, Fiona (Serena Scott Thomas) has taken the wheel. All of a sudden things come to a screeching halt when she hits something or someone!\n\nMeanwhile, Chad (Billy Flynn) and Jack (Matthew Ashford) seem to have some answer’as to the identify of the mystery woman (AnnaLynne McCord). Is it Abigail? Fan favorite, and Daytime Emmy-winner Cady McClain returns as Jennifer Rose Horton Deveraux later in the week as the mystery of Abigail intensifies.\n\nElsewhere, Gabi (Cherie Jimenez) is on the warpath thanks to serial killer Connie (Julie Dove). Seems as though she has learned of Ava (Tamara Braun) and Stefan’s (Brandon Barash) fling. What will she do next?\n\nIn addition, check out these official teasers for DAYS below:\n\nMonday, August 12\n\nStefan and Ava agree to let go of their guilt.\n\nLeo bonds with Hattie, who he mistakes for Marlena.\n\nTuesday, August 13\n\nhe newlyweds (Xander and Sarah) continue to celebrate.\n\nTate and Holly decide to make the most of their time together.\n\nWednesday, August 14\n\nXander goes looking for Sarah.\n\nFiona forces Brady to flee the scene of a crime.\n\nThursday, August 15th\n\nFiona covers her tracks.\n\nJada fills in Paulina on the state of a new investigation.\n\nFriday, August 16\n\nJennifer arrives in Salem to get answers.\n\nMelinda confides to Ava that Connie is a fraud.\n\nWatch the latest promo for Days of our Lives below.
