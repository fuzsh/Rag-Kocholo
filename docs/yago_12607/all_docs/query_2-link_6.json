        "text": "I was just thinking about this same question. If TPTB are telling us the choices are among 1) Bo, 2) Charlie, 3) RJ, 4) David V, 5, Mitch Laurence, 6) Snoop Dog, 7 Cain Rogan, or 8) Jackie McKnaughton…then by process of elimination, they told us today it’s not Bo or David V. and Charlie was previously ruled out. Rex does not ‘look’ bi-racial, so that would rule out RJ & Snoop Dog. That leaves Rex’s father as either Mitch Laurence, Cain Rogan, or Jackie McKnaughton. Mitch or Cain seem the most likely.\n\nI don’t think Rex is going to die. He’s on the banner page these days and his storyline is too tightly integrated. If Mitch Laurence is his father, then he’s at least a half brother to Jessica. In the picture of Cain Rogan they used, Cain’s round face & eyes are similar to Rex’s. Also Roxy & Tina had a conversation last week about sleeping with the same men…at that time I think thay were referring to Max Holden. Interesting.\n\nmy money is on Mitch Lawrence… Be more intersting then any one else… if its not bo… than Mitch… Tina definately slept with him…\n\nwouldnt think Max at all… i did like when he and Roxy were married tho… she grew on him…\n\nI wasn’t suggesting that Max Holden was Rex’s father. I was trying to point out that when Roxy was talking to Tina and she mentioned that they had slept with the same men, it was plural. However, the only man she listed was Max Holden. That was singular. Was Roxy holding back the fact that had also slept with Cain Rogan, Tina’s current husband. I read somewhere that Cain Rogan is suppose to re-appear ‘on canvas’. I would like Bo to be his father, but that doesn’t seem like its going to be the case.\n\nI’m guessing that Rex’s dad is either Mitch, Cain, or Jackie. I have always thought that it was Mitch, but now I am not sure. Cain could be a possiblity since he is returning soon. Jackie could also be Rex’s dad because he knew Roxy back in the day, which means they probably slept together, and he is on the show right now! I am still going to go with my gut feeling and say that Mitch is his father."
