        "text": "Todays show (Tuesday)\n\nOnce again Bravo to RC and his writing staff for continued interconnected storylines involving family ties and secrets!!\n\nAddie/Todd/Blair with Addie being allowed to be the over protective mother ramming Todd up against the door, HILLARIOUS!!\n\nThe teens were actually entertaining with Langston and Cole planning the party and Starr wondering if Cole is cheating\n\nEnjoyed Rex and Natalie's bro/sis chat in the diner comparing one anothers bad day simultaneously. Then they decide to go over to Roxy's palce where little do they know Gigi is!! \"Morasco------------------------Balsom\"!\n\nPardon me for my FRENCH but I Fuc#k!ng love this soapiness!!\n\nOh C'MON you know you all watched todays show If you didn't you missed out on some good sh!t.\n\nWhere to begin,\n\nBo/Nora finally hashing it out. I did not know all of their past but oh boy I got caught up quick as they layed it all OUT! BUT what was Nora holding back on?? It seems she withheld a secret from BO before she left his office, anyone have an idea what she was not telling him? I want to know.\n\nRex and Gigi run in was also a highlight as they quipped back & forth about their highschool years and Rex' gangly teen years. Gigi cracks me up, I cannot wait to see her and Roxy mix it up!\n\nShane is a cute kid, LMAO @ Roxy, \"is Johnny your long lost daddy?\" HA, if you only knew Roxy\n\nAnother good mother to daughter talk with Blair and Starr while her BF Cole was holding langston's hand\n\nYesterday's show was a goody.\n\nIt's official. Addie Cramer is like no other character on a soap right now! I loved her talking to Todd. The people of Llanview under estimate her so much, however I think she's pretty brilliant. Loving her new outlook on life.\n\nThe teens were interesting. I've stated this before, but if Cole was played by a different actor I would be liking the character right now. The writing is there; not too sure about the actor. The way they are dealing with both Langston and Cole mourning is so realistic. I love the story surrounding Starr's birthday.\n\nLove Rex and Natalie's bond. I can soooo see their two stories interwining down the road, and it's due to RC great knack at plotting.\n\nNow excuse me while I go live in denial about the strike; because I just don't want to imagine OLTL not being written by RC at the moment. I'm enjoying every second of the WGA covered episodes.\n\nOh yeah I wasn't too familiar with Nora and Bo's past, but I was very much into their scenes and enjoyed them so much.\n\nI LOVED Roxy hanging out with Shane today. I think she would make a great grandmother . Can't believe I said that.\n\nLMAO...Rex broke Wally.\n\nYes good scenes between Blair and Starr. Starr is struggling not to go over to the dark side.\n\nI'm interested in where the show takes this story with Gigi/John/Todd/Ramsey.\n\nTomorrow looks good. I'm glad we get to see Talia and Antonio. They are beyond cute.\n\nThursday = good, but could have done without John. I hate that he has to always save all in Llanview\n\nAntonio and Talia were nasty all in the street but in a sexy fun way.\n\nRex and Roxy have a great mother/son relationship. Now Rex will know how it feels to have secrets kept from him.\n\nShane apologizing to John for eating his ketchup was hillarious, poor boy was hungry\n\nTommy crying was sad, it was the first time I ever seen that child cry but charlie did a good job with him, that was cute.\n\nTomorrow (Friday) we get Viki/Charlie run in at Dorians La Boulet, that ought to be a blast and oh oh Allison is back!!!!!!\n\nGordon, I could not agree more! I marvel at how RC keeps slowly weaving more and more characters into one big storyline! When the secrets and lies all come out, it will be like a big domino effect!\n\nHow clever is it to weave Rex and Roxy into a major story that already involves Dorian, Viki, Charlie, Jared and the rest of the Buchanan family? And I believe that Nat and Jess are going to be pulled in via that old fave, Allison Perkins. Brilliant. Even less important characters like Miles and Addie effectively dip in and out of the big picture.\n\nThe only real misfires I see are how characters like Chris, Antonio, Talia, and Sarah are kind of off in their own little universe. Sarah should definately be interacting with her family. How 'bout a scene with her Aunt Viki? That's a connection that has been totally overlooked.\n\nOther than these points, OLTL is in formidable shape!\n\nHaha Toups it's about time!\n\nFriday's episode....\n\nIt seems to me that RC is trying to flesh out the character of Roxy, something that hasn't been done since the days of Broderick and Whitsell. The woman is clearly concerned about Rex knowing his real father. Makes one wonder just how bad Rex's real father was.\n\nHere's one scene that I must have overlooked....didn't know Jared and hismom were abused, was it by a stepfather or something?\n\nAw I love the bond that Bo and Rex have formed.\n\n@ Addie crashing in on Viki and her family in the kitchen wearing a chef's suit.\n\n: Viki and Charlie have finally come face to face!!!\n\nI loved all stuff Buchanan today. Dorian has Jared's numba!"
