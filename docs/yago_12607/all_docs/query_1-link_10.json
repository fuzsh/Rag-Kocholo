        "text": "By\n\nLooks who’s coming back to Days of our Lives! John-Paul Lavoisier best-known for his role as Rex Balsom on One Life to Live (1999-2012), will be reprising his role as Phillip Kiriakis on the Peacock streaming soap opera.\n\nAccording to Soap Opera Digest, Lavoisier, who took on the role of Phillip in Salem from 2015-2016, is set to take on the role for a second run beginning next month. That means, that John-Paul will take over from Jay Kenneth Johnson who last played the role when Phillip was ‘presumed’ dead.\n\nJohnson, last aired as Phillip back in 2021, when the character attempted to frame Brady (Eric Martsolf) for his murder over their rivalry for Chloe (Nadia Bjorlin). Meanwhile, Phillip’s mom, Kate (Lauren Koslow), sent him out of town.\n\nNow Chloe is with Xander (Paul Telfer), so how will he explain he faked his own death? Is his plan to get Chloe back, or is he going to try and take over Titan?\n\nWhat do you think about JP Lavoisier returning as DAYS Phillip?

Shen was last seen on the show back in March of 2023.\n\nOver on The Young and the Restless, Linden Ashby is back haunting, taunting or commiserating with Sharon (Sharon Case) as uber-villain Cameron Kirsten on the Friday, August 23rd episode of the CBS daytime drama. Look for Linden to keep popping up as Sharon’s mental stability continues to be out of whack.\n\nLily Brooks O’Briant (Lucy) is also on-screen in two episodes on the Tuesday August 20th and Wednesday August 21st episode as the troubled teen shares some scenes with Nikki (Melody Thomas Scott).\n\nIn addition, longtime beloved Y&R fan favorite, Christian LeBlanc (Michael Baldwin) is back on-screen.

Rex is in Salem, we’ll just have to see what brought him back …next spring.” The last time viewers saw Rex was in 2023.\n\nLowder has a long and storied past with Days of our Lives having originally joined the show as the singing Brady Black back in 2000. He continued to play the part till 2005. However, when the show wanted to bring Lowder back, Eric Martsolf was firmly in the adult-version of Brady, so the show cast Kyle as one of the ‘Gemini Twins” and brought him back as a recast, Rex Brady for a run in 2018-2019. Since that time, Kyle has portrayed Rex in other stints in 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n\nSince exiting DAYS in 2023, Lowder became a morning anchor for the CBS affiliate KTVN in Reno, Nevada. Part of the impetus for his move from Los Angeles was to be closer to his daughter, Isabella, whom he shares with former DAYS star and ex-wife, Arianne Zucker (ex-Nicole). Being in the Lake Tahoe/Reno area is also where Zucker and fiancé, Shawn Christian (ex-Daniel, DAYS) share a home as they get closer to their official wedding date.\n\nSo, why do you think Rex Brady is returning to Salem in the spring of 2025?
