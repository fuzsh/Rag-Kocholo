        "text": "Andy Roberts\n\n(1926 - 2017)\n\nThe bright lights of New York City proved irresistible to Andy Roberts after fulfilling his U.S. Navy military service during World War II. The city was only too happy to embrace this fine young singer. Andy performed with the Skitch Henderson Orchestra and toured with the Sauter Finegan Orchestra. He also made his television debut on NBC’s “Broadway Open House” and he sang for a year on “The Ted Mack Family Hour.” Andy also sang with Gene Krupa and Jimmy Dorsey and socialized with Frank Sinatra, Ed Sullivan, and Rosemary Clooney.\n\nBut when his first daughter Nancy was born to Andy and his wife Dottie while on the road in Las Vegas, Andy discovered that he was at heart a family man and he returned to his hometown of Hampton, Virginia to settle down.\n\nAndy returned to television at WTKR in 1956 hosting “The Andy Roberts Show” variety program and later he hosted “People, Places, and Things.” His relaxed manner and polished voice attracted the attention of Studio Center founder Warren Miller, who promptly ushered Andy into the voice booth."
