        "text": "The Whitney Biennial, one of the most closely watched—and fiercely debated—exhibitions in America, has revealed the lineup for its next edition, which opens in April. The 63-strong list of artists and collectives chosen by curators David Breslin and Adrienne Edwards encompasses three generations and suggests that the first pandemic-era iteration of the show will have a decidedly conceptual and interdisciplinary bent.\n\nIn addition to the participants, the curators have also revealed the show’s title: “Quiet as It’s Kept.” The colloquial term—invoked in the work of novelist Toni Morrison, jazz drummer Max Roach, and artist David Hammons—usually precedes a statement that is traditionally left unsaid.\n\nThe show, originally due to open in 2021, was pushed back one year. It will now run from April 6 through September 5, 2022.\n\nThe show will continue its tradition of questioning what it means to be an “American artist,” placing special emphasis on creators from Mexico, specifically Ciudad Juárez and Tijuana, First Nations artists in Canada, and artists born outside of North America.\n\nWhile the Whitney Biennial has sometimes served to introduce a slate of new talent, this edition is decidedly intergenerational. The oldest artist is Puerto Rican choreographer Awilda Sterling-Duprey, born in 1946; the youngest is Mexican artist Andrew Roberts, born in 1995, whose work draws on technology used in war and the entertainment industry.\n\nThis year’s biennial will also integrate performance and film into the galleries, placing it on equal footing with the rest of the work rather than siloing it in separate programs. The curators promise that the show will evolve throughout its run, and that its two main floors are designed to act as counterpoints: one, a contained, dark labyrinth; the other, open and light-filled.\n\n“We began planning for this exhibition, originally slated to open in 2021, almost a year before the 2020 election, before the pandemic and shutdown with their reeling effects, before the uprisings demanding racial justice and before the questioning of institutions and their structures,” the curators said in a statement. “While many of these underlying conditions are not new, their overlapping, intensity, and sheer ubiquity created a context in which past, present, and future folded into one another. We’ve organized the exhibition to reflect these precarious and improvised times.”\n\nHere is the full list of artists participating:\n\nLisa Alvarado\n\nBorn 1982 in San Antonio, TX\n\nLives in Chicago, IL\n\nHarold Ancart\n\nBorn 1980 in Brussels, Belgium\n\nLives in New York, NY\n\nMónica Arreola\n\nBorn 1976 in Tijuana, Mexico\n\nLives in Tijuana, Mexico\n\nEmily Barker\n\nBorn 1992 in San Diego, CA\n\nLives in Los Angeles, CA\n\nYto Barrada\n\nBorn 1971 in Paris, France\n\nLives in Brooklyn, NY, and Tangier, Morocco\n\nRebecca Belmore\n\nBorn 1960 in Upsala, Canada\n\nLives in Vancouver, Canada\n\nAnishinaabe\n\nJonathan Berger\n\nBorn 1980 in New York, NY\n\nLives in New York, NY, and Glover, VT\n\nNayland Blake\n\nBorn 1960 in New York, NY\n\nLives in Brooklyn and Queens, NY\n\nCassandra Press\n\nFounded 2016 by Kandis Williams\n\nTheresa Hak Kyung Cha\n\nBorn 1951 in Busan, South Korea\n\nDied 1982 in New York, NY\n\nRaven Chacon\n\nBorn 1977 in Fort Defiance, Navajo Nation\n\nLives in Albuquerque, NM\n\nDiné\n\nLeidy Churchman\n\nBorn 1979 in Villanova, PA\n\nLives in New York, NY, and West Tremont, ME\n\nTony Cokes\n\nBorn 1956 in Richmond, VA\n\nLives in Providence, RI\n\nJacky Connolly\n\nBorn 1990 in New York, NY\n\nLives in Brooklyn, NY\n\nMatt Connors\n\nBorn 1973 in Chicago, IL\n\nLives in New York, NY, and Los Angeles, CA\n\nAlex Da Corte\n\nBorn 1980 in Camden, NJ\n\nLives in Philadelphia, PA\n\nAria Dean\n\nBorn 1993 in Los Angeles, CA\n\nLives in New York, NY\n\nDanielle Dean\n\nBorn 1982 in Huntsville, AL\n\nLives in Los Angeles and San Diego, CA\n\nJane Dickson\n\nBorn 1952 in Chicago, IL\n\nLives in New York, NY\n\nBuck Ellison\n\nBorn 1987 in San Francisco, CA\n\nLives in Los Angeles, CA\n\nAlia Farid\n\nBorn 1985 in Kuwait City, Kuwait\n\nLives in San Juan, PR, and Kuwait City, Kuwait\n\nCoco Fusco\n\nBorn 1960 in New York, NY\n\nLives in Brooklyn, NY\n\nEllen Gallagher\n\nBorn 1965 in Providence, RI\n\nLives in Rotterdam, Netherlands, and Brooklyn, NY\n\nA Gathering of the Tribes /Steve Cannon\n\nFounded 1991\n\nSteve Cannon: Born 1935 in New Orleans, LA\n\nDied 2019 in New York, NY\n\nCy Gavin\n\nBorn 1985 in Pittsburgh, PA\n\nLives in New York State\n\nAdam Gordon\n\nBorn 1986 in Minneapolis, MN\n\nLives in Jersey City, NJ\n\nRenée Green\n\nBorn 1959 in Cleveland, OH\n\nLives in Somerville, MA, and New York, NY\n\nPao Houa Her\n\nBorn 1982 in Laos\n\nLives in Blaine, MN\n\nEJ Hill\n\nBorn 1985 in Los Angeles, CA\n\nLives in Los Angeles, CA\n\nAlfredo Jaar\n\nBorn 1956 in Santiago, Chile\n\nLives in New York, NY\n\nRindon Johnson\n\nBorn 1990 in San Francisco, CA\n\nLives in Berlin, Germany\n\nIvy Kwan Arce and Julie Tolentino\n\nIvy Kwan Arce: Born 1965 in Salinas, CA\n\nLives in New York, NY\n\nJulie Tolentino: Born 1964 in San Francisco, CA\n\nLives in Joshua Tree, CA\n\nRalph Lemon\n\nBorn 1952 in Cincinnati, OH\n\nLives in Brooklyn, NY\n\nDuane Linklater\n\nBorn 1976 in Treaty 9 Territory (Northern Ontario, Canada)\n\nLives in North Bay, Canada (Robinson Huron Treaty Territory)\n\nOmaskêko Ininiwak\n\nJames Little\n\nBorn 1952 in Memphis, TN\n\nLives in New York, NY\n\nRick Lowe\n\nBorn 1961 in rural Alabama\n\nLives in Houston, TX\n\nDaniel Joseph Martinez\n\nBorn 1957 in Los Angeles, CA\n\nLives in Los Angeles, CA, and Paris, France\n\nDave McKenzie\n\nBorn 1977 in Kingston, Jamaica\n\nLives in Brooklyn, NY\n\nRodney McMillian\n\nBorn 1969 in Columbia, SC\n\nLives in Los Angeles, CA\n\nNa Mira\n\nBorn 1982 in Lawrence, KS, on Kickapoo, Osage, Kansa, and Sioux lands\n\nLives in Los Angeles, CA, on Tongva, Gabrielino, Kizh, and Chumash lands\n\nAlejandro “Luperca” Morales\n\nBorn 1990 in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico\n\nLives in Monterrey, Mexico\n\nMoved by the Motion\n\nFounded 2016 by Wu Tsang and Tosh Basco\n\nTerence Nance\n\nBorn 1982 in Dallas, TX\n\nLives in America\n\nWoody De Othello\n\nBorn 1991 in Miami, FL\n\nLives in Oakland, CA\n\nAdam Pendleton\n\nBorn 1984 in Richmond, VA\n\nLives in New York, NY\n\nN.
