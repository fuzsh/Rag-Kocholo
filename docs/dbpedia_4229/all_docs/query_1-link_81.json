        "text": "Concert featuring T-Ranch and the Kidd\n\nJanuary 7, 2024 - A concert will be held at Mariposa United Methodist Church on Sunday, January 14 at 2:00 p.m. It will feature Andy Roberts and Jon Kidd, as T-Ranch (Tarantulabanjo) and The Kidd playing drums and percussion. Roberts is an award-winning clawhammer banjo player. Jon Kidd's approach to the concert will be to emulate sounds one would hear with banjo music: thunder, train sounds, Celtic influences, and Afro-rhythm.\n\nThe concert is a fundraiser for the many local ministries of the Mariposa United Methodist Church. It will be followed by a short sing-along and refreshments. Tickets are $10 and are available at Mariposa UMC office at Sixth and Bullion Streets from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon on weekdays. They can also be bought at the door.\n\nT-Ranch (short for Tarantulabanjo) is Andy Roberts, who is an award-winning clawhammer** banjo player and singer/songwriter from Mariposa, CA. His music is timeless, harkening to days of old and foreseeing days to come, with a voice and banjo prowess that is authentic, raw, and unique.\n\nThe Kidd is Jon Kidd, who is a well-respected and in-demand drummer, percussionist, singer, and songwriter who also lives in Mariposa. His approach to this concert will be to emulate sounds that one would hear with banjo music: thunder, train sounds, Celtic influences, and Afro-rhythm."
