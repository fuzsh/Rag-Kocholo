        "text": "Andy Roberts\n\nAndy Roberts\n\nIsle of Wight\n\nAndy Roberts, a seasoned solo acoustic guitarist from the Isle of Wight, offers meaningful musical journeys with a blend of catchy originals and interesting 70s covers, perfect for listeners and venues alike. Longer version:: **Andy Roberts: Acoustic Singer-Songwriter on the Isle of Wight** Andy Roberts, based on the Isle of Wight, is a committed solo acoustic guitarist whose music is a blend of reflection and authenticity. Influenced by his surroundings and personal journey, Andy's songs deeply resonate with listeners, providing a genuine connection to his narratives. ### [[Career path]] **First public performance.** A very young and inexperienced 14yr old Andy was called up from the audience at a Ralph MvTell concert in the City Hall. Asked by MC John âThe Fishâ to take a turn on stage due to an embarrassing delay in the main starâs arrival, he surprised everyone there with his newly acquired skills singing âMotel Bluesâ by Loudon Wainwright and then a couple of originals. The packed audienceâs enthusiastic applause and cheers gave him the taste for it and he never looked back. **Paris Recordings** Plucked from singing down in the metro by an Italian pop music producer, they embarked on making reel to reel Revox recordings of Andyâs songs after signing a very long and ultimately pointless contract. There were socials and photo shoots as well but the weekly journeys from one side of Paris to the other petered out and those tapes have never been recovered. Back in Cornwall in the late 70s, Andy drove around with a huge combo amp in the back of a Mini Countryman and played occasional gigs in pubs at the back of nowhere. **80s** For much the 80s and 90s music took a back seat to family and day job but for a while Andy played electric guitar in a jazz funk band appearing in pubs in Canterbury and at the well supported âMines not Missilesâ Festival in Aylesham. **Island Escape** Shortly after arriving on the island, Andy bumped into an ex-member of Hawkwind and formed a duo to play in Yarmouth and Freshwater Bay. Despite these brief attempts at collaboration, Andy really is at heart a soloist singer songwriter suited to making arrangements for one voice and an acoustic guitar. The songbird sessions at Strings and acoustic originals at Quay arts provided platforms from which to become better known. One session involved having four of his songs performed by Jazz players Jim Thorne and John throne, with Chris from Plastic Mermaids on percusssion. Just a year or two after deciding to launch full time into the pub circuit., the pandemic closed all venues indefinitely. So was that it, is it all over? Andy remembered his roots as a busker and set about working out how to do that on the internet. **The Power of Music in Challenging Times** As the world began to emerge from the confines of lockdowns, a simple stroll around Andy Roberts' village revealed something profound. Local people not seen for a year or more approached him, expressing their heartfelt gratitude for the solace hisÂ weekly Facebook live music concerts provided during those isolating months. This unexpected revelation was transformative for Andy. Recognising the profound emotional impact of his live music, he renewed his dedication to it. Now, with a mission to touch more hearts and souls, Andy brings his live music experience to venues throughout the Isle of Wight, continuing to be a beacon of hope and connection in a world that truly needs it. Beyond music, Andy's passion extends to permaculture and natural patterns, embracing their potential to mend the harm caused by current systems. **Praise for Andy Roberts** \"Always a pleasure to have Andy Roberts play at CaffÃ¨ Isola!\" \"Some great music and vocals, thanks for sharing my friend, cheered me up no end in these dark times.\" - Online viewer. âYouâre the real deal Andyâ - Angelina \"You made lots of friends with your lovely choice of songs and playing. Will definitely invite you back\" - The Hideaway. \"Great stuff as ever, Andy\" - Paul Armfield. **Connect with Andy** Discover Andy's music on Bandcamp, join the community of listeners on Facebook, or stay updated with his insights and updates on Substack.
