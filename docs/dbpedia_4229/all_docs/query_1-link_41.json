        "text": "Drama and live acoustic music combine into a show telling a remarkable story set mainly in Paris, 1974 at this year’s Ventnor Fringe Festival.\n\nAndy Roberts, a well-known singer-songwriter on the Isle of Wight, presents “Boulevard Days,” a one-man show that weaves narrative, drama, and music into a captivating performance.\n\nAndy explains,\n\n“I didn’t like school much, so I left home at 16 and became a full-time musician in Paris.\n\n“There were a lot of ups and downs, some crazy scenes looking back from now, but I never regretted a moment of it.”\n\nA unique blend of storytelling and music\n\n“Boulevard Days” includes not only narrative and drama but also some of the original songs Andy penned during his time in Paris.\n\nHe plays these songs on the very same (now vintage) guitar introduced in one of the scenes at the Café Mazet in the Latin Quarter.\n\nSold out shows\n\nAndy is well-known on the Island for his performances in pubs, clubs, bars, and cafes. His last appearance at the Ventnor Fringe was a sold-out concert at the Arts Club.\n\nBefore that, he performed his songs photogenically from the back of a vintage Parisian bus, known to festival-goers as the Book Bus.\n\nUpcoming performances\n\nThis year, Andy appears not just as an accomplished musician and songwriter but as a storyteller, actor, and playwright.\n\nHe will perform “Boulevard Days” in a run of three theatre performances from Tuesday to Thursday, 23rd-25th July, at The Pier Street Playhouse, Pier Street, Ventnor, from 1pm-2pm.\n\nA diverse cast of characters\n\nThe play features a diverse cast of characters across its three acts. In Act One, we meet The Teenager, Father, Grandma, Policeman, Doctor, Border Control, and Time Traveller.\n\nAct Two introduces Guy, Colin (King of the Buskers), Excalibur, Rene Arnoux, and Joan of Arc.\n\nAct Three features Brian and an Embassy Official – all played by Andy.\n\nBook now\n\nTickets for “Boulevard Days” are available from the box office for £8-10. The show takes place on Tuesday 23rd July between 1pm and 2pm at the Pier Street Playhouse.\n\nThey can be purchased from the Ventnor Fringe website.\n\nAvailable for gigs\n\nIsland venues who are interested in booking Andy for regular live gigs or stages can contact him via email at [email protected] or by phone at (01983) 752050.\n\nHe is also available to follow on Facebook.\n\nOur thanks to the artist for sponsoring for this feature. They and other businesses and organisations taking paid promotion enables you to continue reading OnTheWight for free."
