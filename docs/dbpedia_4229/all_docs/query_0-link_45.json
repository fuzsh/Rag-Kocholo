        "text": "There is a critical perception that Louis Armstrong somehow abandoned his small-band roots when he moved away from the Hot 5 and 7 recordings of the 20's and recorded with the larger bands of the 30's. In reality, though, he had been playing with large units almost exclusively before and since his seminal records on OKeh. With the exception of a small number of hours recording those songs, he had spent the rest of the previous quarter century playing big band music.\n\nIn 1947, however, dogged by this undeserved collar and hounded by rising expenses for his touring band, he submitted to managerial pressure to unleash a small combo for a show at Town Hall in New York City; the concert was a howling success, leading the way for Louis to tour with the now-streamlined band he called his \"All-Stars.\" With sporadic changes in personnel, this arrangement suited him for the rest of his performing career. In the studio, the All-Stars recorded scores of tunes, often re-recording the Hot classics from 25 years earlier, and re-rerecording them again when they changed labels.\n\nLouis also frequently fronted elaborate orchestras with white-bread choruses, doing his best with the increasingly tepid pop material his manager provided him. Sometimes he was paired with other singers -- Ella Fitzgerald, Bing and Gary Crosby, and Louis Jordan -- to produce pleasant but forgettable platters. And occasionally, he could still mold a song -- \"Mack the Knife\" and \"A Kiss to Build a Dream On\", to name a few -- into an incomparable classic.\n\nProfessionally, it was a period of mushrooming excitement for Pops, who was now frequently releasing records and appearing on radio and in movies. In retrospect, however, it was a period of musical unfulfillment. Armstrong's manager, Joe Glaser, though a master at setting up successful concerts and tours, lacked the vision to showcase his number one artist in the light he deserved. Fortunately, others would soon give Louis Armstrong the latitude to lay down his most timeless tracks.\n\nAlthough Armstrong retained a loyal following to the end of his days that was appreciative of his contribution to the world of music, his place at the vanguard of the music called \"jazz\" was taken by a new generation of virtuoso performers playing a new music: bop. But the true musical heirs of Louis Armstrong were not really the boppers. The jazz of Louis Armstrong's music was accessible, functional music that represented freedom for both the listener and the hearer. The jazz of Louis Armstrong was created by charismatic performers playing in an individual, idiosyncratic, rhythmically energetic style and peppering lyrics with nonsense syllables. The jazz of Louis Armstrong came from not from the conservatory but from the whorehouse, not from the aristocracy but from the southern proletariat. The jazz of Louis Armstrong was derided by the establishment as noise and its sexual energy was feared by the self-righteous. Although Armstrong probably never realized it, his true musical heirs didn't play something called \"jazz\", they played something called \"Rock and Roll.\"\n\nEsquire All-American 1946 Award Winners\n\nJanuary 10, 1946: New York, NY\n\nAnother war-era dream team, this one headed by Louis and Duke Ellington. \"Snafu\" is the unforgettable track.

Willems lists an October 27 radio broadcast from Rome, which would be consistent with Armstrongs filming schedule on Botta E Risposta in Rome on that same day. Westerberg's book lists a private recording of a Trieste show on November 9, but it would seem odd that after touring Italy in October, he would go to France for a date on November 8, then return to Italy for a performance on November 9.

Willems documents his data on this October 27 session with an October 28 inscription on RAI acetates held by the Louis Armstrong House and Archives.

Confusing matters is his mention of another recording of a concert presumably made around the same time in Italy with a significantly different set-list. However, a pair of Italian writers pointed out to me that a CD of this broadcast issued by RAI indicates that it was recorded in Firenze in the radio station's auditorium. Archives of a press photographer show the band performing on October 25 in Prato. So, presumably, the band performed this broadcast in Firenze, then took a short drive up to Prato for a concert later in the day which may or may not have also been recorded.\n\nOn the Sunny Side of the Street (McHugh, Jimmy; Fields, Dorothy)\n\nCoquette\n\nThat's My Desire\n\nSt. Louis Blues (Handy, W.C.)\n\nOn the Alamo\n\nHow High the Moon (Nancy Hamilton; Morgan Lewis)\n\nBugle Call Rag / Ole Miss\n\nBasin Street Blues\n\nVelma's Blues (Middleton, Velma; Armstrong, Louis)\n\nMiddleton, Velma (Vocal)\n\nWhen It's Sleepy Time Down South (Rene, Otis; Rene, Leon; Muse, Clarence)\n\nPersonnel\n\nArmstrong, Louis (Trumpet, Vocal)\n\nYoung, Trummy (Trombone, Vocal)\n\nMcCracken, Bob (Clarinet)\n\nNapoleon, Marty (Piano)\n\nShaw, Arvell (Bass)\n\nCole, Cozy (Drums)\n\nSaluti E Baci / La Route Du Bonheur (film)\n\nOctober 26 or 28, 1952: Rome, Italy\n\nItalian film also known asLa Route du bonheurin France andThe Road to Happinesswhen distributed in English-speaking countries.\n\nimdb.com\n\nStruttin' With Some Barbecue (Hardin, Lil)\n\nPersonnel\n\nArmstrong, Louis (Trumpet, Vocal)\n\nYoung, Trummy (Trombone, Vocal)\n\nMcCracken, Bob (Clarinet)\n\nNapoleon, Marty (Piano)\n\nShaw, Arvell (Bass)\n\nCole, Cozy (Drums)\n\nAll Star Revue (NBC) (television)\n\nDecember 20, 1952: New York, NY\n\nShow hosted by Tallulah Bankhead.\n\nWho Needs What Moonlight\n\nPersonnel\n\nArmstrong, Louis (Trumpet, Vocal)\n\nUnknown personnel (Studio Orchestra)\n\nWillson, Meridith (Conductor)\n\nLouis Armstrong With Sy Oliver's Orchestra\n\nFebruary 23, 1953: Detroit, Michigan\n\nSy Oliver's Orchestra...my foot!

Handy. There are two CD versions of theW.C. Handyalbum. The first (CK 40242), released in 1986, resulted from a fruitless search for the original session masters; alternate takes were used on six tracks, and the best possible transfers were made from vinyl for the others. When the second (CK 64925) was produced ten years later, a pristine copy of the first LP pressing was digitally mastered, and second generation tapes -- edited in the 1950's for EP issues -- were spliced in when available. The second release is the more definitive of the two. Trummy Young was able to record his own co-composition \"'Taint What You Do\" at the end of the sessions, and it has seen release on a Columbia album and a European single, although it has yet to make its way to CD.\n\nAunt Hagar's Blues (Bryan, J.T.; Handy, W.C.)

A virtual repeat of the Louis Armstrong Plays W.C. Handy story, this album's first CD release in 1986 was comprised mostly of alternate takes due to the disappearance of the original master tapes. Happily, though, by 2000 the tapes were rediscovered, resulting in a sensational reissue that included four more alternate edits as bonus tracks -- not to mention seven OKeh recordings of Louis' Waller covers. The final track would seem likely to come from the April 26 session, but its genesis is unverified.\n\nI've Got A Feeling I'm Falling (Rose, B.; Link; Waller, Thomas) [master CO.53251]\n\nSony 64927\n\nColumbia CL 708 (LP)\n\nColumbia CK 64927\n\nI've Got A Feeling I'm Falling (no overdub) (Rose, B.; Link; Waller, Thomas)\n\nSony 64927\n\nColumbia CK 64927\n\nI've Got A Feeling I'm Falling (edited alternate take) (Rose, B.; Link; Waller, Thomas)\n\nSony 64927\n\nColumbia CK 64927\n\nBlack and Blue, (What Did I Do To Be So) (Razaf, Andy; Waller, Thomas; Brooks, Harry) [master CO.53252]\n\nSony 64927\n\nColumbia CL 708 (LP)\n\nColumbia CK 64927\n\nBlack and Blue, (What Did I Do To Be So) (edited alternate take) (Razaf, Andy; Waller, Thomas; Brooks, Harry)\n\nSony 64927\n\nColumbia CK 64927\n\nPersonnel\n\nArmstrong, Louis (Trumpet, Vocal)\n\nYoung, Trummy (Trombone)\n\nBigard, Barney (Clarinet)\n\nKyle, Billy (Piano)\n\nShaw, Arvell (Bass)\n\nDeems, Barrett (Drums)\n\nLouis Armstrong and The All Stars\n\nApril 26, 1955: New York, NY\n\nHoneysuckle Rose (Razaf, Andy; Waller, Thomas) [master CO.53253]\n\nSony 64927\n\nColumbia CL 708 (LP)\n\nColumbia CK 64927\n\nHoneysuckle Rose (partial alternate take) (Razaf, Andy; Waller, Thomas)\n\nSony 64927\n\nColumbia CK 64927\n\nPersonnel\n\nArmstrong, Louis (Trumpet, Vocal)\n\nYoung, Trummy (Trombone)\n\nBigard, Barney (Clarinet)\n\nKyle, Billy (Piano)\n\nShaw, Arvell (Bass)\n\nDeems, Barrett (Drums)\n\nMiddleton, Velma (Vocal)\n\nLouis Armstrong and The All Stars\n\nApril 27, 1955: New York, NY\n\nI'm Crazy 'Bout My Baby And My Baby's Crazy 'Bout Me (Waller, Thomas; Hill, A.)
