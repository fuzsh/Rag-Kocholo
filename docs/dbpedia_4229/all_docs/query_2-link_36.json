        "text": "One of the four really quick bowlers that West Indies had in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, Andy Roberts was shorter than the rest, but easily one of the most intelligent fast bowlers to take field. As with the rest of the pace men, he picked up his 202 wickets at an average of 25 only. Incidentally, Roberts was also the first player from Antigua to play Test cricket for West Indies, and he was to be followed by Viv Richards, Richie Richardson and Curtly Ambrose.\n\nRoberts had this uncanny knack of surprising batsmen with his sharp and quick bouncers, which were set up by previous slower ones which batsmen could easily pull away!\n\nPost the Packer organized WSC, Andy Roberts returned back to the West Indies fold, but he had not remained as quick as he was earlier. He had the skills and the artistry to bowl at a reduced pace and still pick up wickets at regular intervals. He played in the 1983 World Cup, and toured India after that, but retired immediately thereafter. Post retirement, he has still remained associated with West Indian cricket, by becoming the administrator overseeing the preparation of the pitches at the Antigua Cricket Ground."
