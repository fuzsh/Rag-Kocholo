        "text": "Message Board Archives\n\nSir Andy Roberts\n\nDukes\n\nThe President of the West Indies 4 prong fast bowling attack of the 1970's and 1980's, Anderson Montgomery Everton Roberts will be in Berbice,Guyana next week to work with some young fast bowlers there.\n\nAndy who played some 47 test matches and took 202 test wickets is widely regarded as one of the West Indies premier fast bowlers and his expertise and knowledge will be a huge boon to Berbice as that county continues to pull out all the stops to improve their cricket.Roberts will spend 5 days in Guyana.\n\nThis visit by Roberts also coincides with a visit by former England batsman Roland Butcher to the Ancient County and comes just 2 months after the historic fast bowling camp conducted by Sir Curtly Ambrose.\n\nNarper\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nAny intention of getting Alvin Kallicharan there too?\n\nChrissy\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nNice\n\ntops\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\n\"Andy who played some 47 test matches and took 202 test wickets is widely regarded as one of the West Indies premier fast bowlers\"\n\nHe surely was. Didn't he get to his 100 test wickets in his 19th test match? Maan! What wouldn't our current test bowlers do to get Robert's record.\n\nHalliwell\n\nIn reply to tops\n\nDid he play some 47 Test matches, or\n\nDid he play 47 Test matches?\n\nSorry\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to Halliwell\n\nWhy are you sorry?\n\nCurtis\n\nHere's to hoping Berbice becomes the Fast Bowling capital of the Caribbean.\n\nGeorgetown men would be wise to make the trip east and to put on a lil Berbice accent to get some tips.\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to tops\n\nDidn't he get to his 100 test wickets in his 19th test match?\n\nAbsolutely correct!!!\n\nDavid Steele c Murray b Roberts 00\n\nHeadingley 1976\n\nI remember my first year in England 1974 how Andy terrorized all the English batsmen while he was playing for Hampshire.He took about 135 wickets at 12 runs apiece.\n\nrobbo\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nI think many people forget how quick Roberts was I remember that first full county season when he cut through virtually every side he came up against like a hot knife through butter. He got tongues wagging and was was feared & revered in equal measure.\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to robbo\n\nLloyd told me an anecdote about that 1974 season.Lancashire vs Hampshire and Andy had a couple of quick wickets and Lloyd joined Frank Hayes at the crease. First ball was a screaming bouncer which he avoided.Second ball he turned down to fine leg and as he is ambling a single,Hayes is screaming TWO.Lloyd immediately responded with a loud NO.\n\nNarper\n\nAndy Roberts broke into the West Indies side by playing against them\n\nI do not remember the specifics of that match, but I do remember hitting Steve Camacho, the West Indies opener, on the head. There were a lot of catches dropped between the wicketkeeper and slips. I also remember Roy Fredericks playing aggressively in both innings, but I fought aggression with aggression. In that innings Fredericks played the full range of his shots. Later in my career he refused to play the hook, because by then I had more pace and I had become a lot cleverer\n\n.\n\nThat ended Camacho's career\n\nThe incident meant that Camacho took no further part in the tour, and though he continued playing for Guyana for a few years he never regained the confidence he had prior to the blow\n\nlink\n\nNarper\n\nThose were the days when a youthful, quick and mean Andy Roberts roamed the shires under the banner of the Hampshire County Cricket Club, doling out discomfort and pain to helmetless batsmen.\n\nOn this day he was sending them down like rockets. Did you see that! bellowed Kitchen, its the quickest ball I have ever seen in my life. I am not going to get these smashed, as he removed his false teeth and placed them in his pocket, I paid too much for them.\n\nlink\n\nNarper\n\nIn his autobiography, Viv goes through a list of batsmen who were hurt from deliveries propelled by his countrymans right arm:\n\nThe first time I saw it was when he hit David Hookes in a World Series cricket match and broke his jaw. The Australian Golden Boy was wired up for weeks and couldnt eat anything solid for a while. I also saw him hit Peter Toohey in Trinidad and broke his nose, and then later he smashed his thumb in the same game; he broke Sadiq Mohammads jaw in a Test match in Georgetown and Majid Khans cheekbone in county cricket.\n\ntops\n\nIn reply to Narper\n\n\"he broke Sadiq Mohammads jaw in a Test match in Georgetown\"\n\nOn that Borda pitch? How Roberts managed to do that?\n\ntops\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\n\"I remember my first year in England 1974 how Andy terrorized all the English batsmen while he was playing for Hampshire.He took about 135 wickets at 12 runs apiece.\"\n\nWOW! '135 wickets at 12 runs apiece'? That's bowling!\n\nBrerzerk\n\nIn reply to Narper\n\nIn Viv' original autobio he said he knew Botham would play for England. Why?\n\nHe watched Andy smack him in the face and after spitting out two teeth and retired hurt\n\nhe returned and stood up to him. I think Beefy was only then 19!\n\nBrerzerk\n\nIn reply to tops\n\nHe won us a series with one single delivery.\n\nAt Sabina Pakistan was well in the match at the beginning\n\nof their 2nd innings. I think Andy got only 1 wkt. but early\n\non he struck Moin a most fearful blow under the heart and\n\nexcept for Raja the rest sitting back in the crease were\n\neasy pickings for Garner n Croft. It was 1-1 going into that test.\n\nrobbo\n\nIn reply to Brerzerk\n\nWas that the 1977 series ?\n\nBrerzerk\n\nIn reply to robbo\n\nYes, 5th Test. Croft, Garner n Holford bowled them down.\n\nrobbo\n\nIn reply to Brerzerk\n\nFrom memory that was the series in which Andy Roberts took something like 20 wickets at 40 apiece. Apparently those figures in no way reflect the way he bowled during the series.\n\nIn one of many books that Imran Khan wrote he said that during that series Roberts effectively terrorised the Pakistani batsmen.\n\nThere was one spell towards the end of a particular day in which he really steamed in apparently bowled at the speed of light. The Pakistani dressing room were awestruck and he said that they never really recovered any confidence.\n\nImran also said that the fastest delivery he ever faced was bowled by Roberts during that series and believe it or not he hit it for six.\n\nHe didnt see the ball, he just swung wildly but somehow managed to middle it sending it over the boundary.\n\nIt does go to show how misleading statistics can sometimes be.\n\nanalyst-kid\n\nBajan batsmen in the mid 70s loved pace but I remember Roberts was the one bowler that terrorised Bajan batsmen in the Shell Shield....men were scared although I remember Collis King counteracting aggressively against him and in latter years Carlisle Best.\n\nFolklore said Collis King scored a running 75!\n\nanalyst-kid\n\nDo you know Roberts made his debut in that famous match in 1973 where Lawrence Rowe made 302 at Kensington?\n\nIt was also Sobers last match at Kensington.\n\nRoberts debut and Sobers last match home where he made duck\n\nWalco\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nContinue to walk that walk Dukes. Great job!!!\n\nEmir\n\nIn reply to Brerzerk\n\nAt Sabina Pakistan was well in the match at the beginning\n\nof their 2nd innings. I think Andy got only 1 wkt. but early\n\non he struck Moin\n\nNo, not Moin, I believe Moin wasn't born yet in 77. It was Sadiq, Majid and Zaheer who got hit. The Pak keeper back then was Wasim Bari. The 77 series was a fascinating one indeed!\n\nDukes\n\nIn addition to Sir Andy Roberts and Roland Butcher,Desmond Haynes and Jimmy Adams will be in Guyana later this week.\n\nDukes\n\nSir Andy arrived in Guyana last night.\n\nBaje\n\nIn reply to analyst-kid\n\nLet's be accurate. Robert's terrorized us in 1975. We murdered him in 1977 1980 and 1981.\n\nWatching him in 1975 I made up my mind that I would never be good enough to play at that level.\n\nBaje\n\nIn reply to Baje\n\nIh by the way Collis did not run or flinch during that 80\n\nRedDuppy\n\nIn reply to Baje Floppy hat and all\n\nDukes\n\nMeanwhile the fast bowling and batting camp in Berbice, Guyana conducted by Andy Roberts and Roland Butcher had two former West Indian captains in attendance. Jimmy Adams, Director of Cricket and Desmond Haynes, Chairman of Selectors , joined the camp and both gave inspirational speeches to the players, coaches and parents in a well attended and organized session yesterday..\n\nCITYBOY\n\nIts great that the former intl players are trying to impart a bit of know how to the youths ...\n\nBut is it all falling on deaf ears??\n\nThe youths I will bet my bottom dollar dont view any of the oldsters as idols ..\n\nSimply they have all left the playing arena before most of these youths were born..\n\nThe sport has evolved ( with the basic element being instinctive) thus you need modern day warriors to do any improvement and impart their knowledge ..\n\nThe mindset of these youths are on what they see now.. not something they have never seen nor someone they never heard of ...\n\nA Jofra Archer , Dwayne Bravo would get 2000 percent attention.\n\nOh well .. that all takes a whole lot of money ..\n\nCurtis\n\nI heard Adams donated 6 pairs of extra-long pads to the program to help them execute on the coaching techniques he was teaching. Kudos Jimmy!\n\nsolidrock\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nGood.\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to CITYBOY\n\nIts great that the former intl players are trying to impart a bit of know how to the youths ...\n\nBut is it all falling on deaf ears??\n\nThe youths I will bet my bottom dollar dont view any of the oldsters as idols ..\n\nSimply they have all left the playing arena before most of these youths were born..\n\nA false narrative based on your cynical appraisal of the current generation.\n\nYou have ZERO first hand knowledge of what you speak.\n\nIn today's world of you tube and google.These young players have countless footage of our former greats.As a matter of fact at the Awards ceremony in February the video of Curtly's 7-1 spell was shown.The coaches use video of our greats like Viv,Greenidge,Lloyd,Kallicharran and even footage of Lance Gibbs to drive home their points.\n\nCurtis\n\nNot to be outdone, Sir Dukes was instrumental in explaining Runs in the Key of Life to the youngsters.\n\nTeens were shown how average matters, where to Google averages and stats, and what part average plays in making a case for selection.\n\nJust teasing doc, keep on doing!\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to Curtis\n\nCITYBOY\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nSorry Dukes. Its the way I feel...\n\nI know ... you dont me and who I know.. I was once used as a technical batsman by Alvin K at Warwick shire in his coaching youngsters..\n\nLance sent down hundreds of deliveries in our front yard on his way home from work ..\n\nI grew up playing along lots of national players and a few that played tests.,\n\nI once asked Jimmy Adams why every time he goes to bat .. without warning a jumbie appears and the wicket becomes unplayable..\n\nI was dropping Charlie Griffith and Andy Roberts back to their hotel after spending an afternoon with them and Charlie maintained that Andy is a\n\nspinner ..\n\nI have lots more.. and o am sure you too.. bottom line we see things differently ..\n\nWhy you think TT producing so many talented T 20 players.. they certainly not learning from Lara or Gomes.. its from the current guys who still ply their trade in TT..\n\nI can go on and on ...\n\nBut YouTube aint providing no idol to no youngster ...\n\nCurtis\n\nIn reply to CITYBOY\n\nCityBoy, you play bumper ball? We looking for an aging veteran with good gyaff and batting skills.\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to Curtis\n\nU really believe you can find a bigger gyaff man dan me???\n\nYUH MAD OR WHAT!!!!!!!\n\nCITYBOY\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nThat gaff thing is from yester years. Bannuhs especially if a fast bowler got you hopping .. the tantalize and gaff that would come out cannot described ..\n\nWhen tests were played at Bourda a bunch of us would head down from US and Can and the gaff and hangout was something else ...Lance was president lol\n\nCITYBOY\n\nIn reply to Curtis\n\nOk you asked for it ... so I thought I was a big shot unbeatable bumper ball player.. so Kali come down to wuk in Georgetown and play for GCC..\n\nEvery Sunday big money betting on bumper ball games..so I took Kalli to play..\n\nThey picking a side and Kalli ended up by default on a team.. as no one thought he can play bumper ball ..\n\nWell he aint out yet. ... Kalli was a bad man bhai ..\n\nBut I dont play bumper ball anymore..\n\nI will concentrate on out gaffing Dukes\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to CITYBOY\n\nNo bigger gaff man than the late Fred Wills.Brilliant man.Guyana Scholar,Outstanding Lawyer DCC cricket captain and Chairman of the Guyana Selectors.\n\nDCC playing a Case Cup match and a young batsman is shaping very well against both the DCC fast bowlers and spinners.Fred Wills is talking to the wicketkeeper but making sure that the young batsman can hear.He said what the selectors are looking for is adventurous batsmen who use their feet against the spinners and knock them off their length.The young batsman charges down to the off-spinner and is stumped.Fred Wills says to him : Boy yuh must not listen to big people conversation!!!\n\nBrerzerk\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nCITYBOY\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nAh playing against Police and open batting.. I think its the lefty bad man English open bowling.. a square cut for four and then took a single .. I stayed at that end and watched 6 or 7 men get bowled down and I aint going back to that end..\n\nEnglish ask why I aint going down that side.. I simply replied.. not even he and the whole police force can get me down there even if I get handcuff\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to CITYBOY\n\nG.S Sobers Bowled English 165\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA\n\nCITYBOY\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nWell let me give you the lowdown on that innings..Sobie get dropped early by whom??\n\nLet me see if you know the name and I gonna give the truth about the drop\n\nDukes\n\nIn reply to CITYBOY\n\nI do not remember him getting dropped in that innings.I remember him getting dropped a few years earlier by the wicketkeeper Jackman in Barbados when he made a double hundred.\n\nCITYBOY\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nYou ah wan young boy. ... but here is how it went down..\n\nOvid Glasgow was the shop keeper (lol)\n\nBut here is the gaff and true true story..\n\nSobie come in to bat and here is what happen..Ovid start trembling and sweating .. he said .. man the king is in front of me and meh BT biting.. I only watching de king .. I dont know wha happen.. ah just sweating ..\n\n ah only admiring the king strokes\n\nWell well Sobie nick one and Ovid by only watching Sobie never saw de ball and boo doom Sobie get drap..\n\nAnd we know what happen Sobie drap 165 in we cloth ..\n\nBut you have to hear the gaff and actions etc by some of those telling the story..\n\nHilarious .. Next time you talk to Lance ask him who was bowler .. I am thinking old Joe ..\n\nThat same game Lashley went insane.. after the Guyana dec he carved up I think a 76 not out by close with some serious batting.. more in line t20\n\nDukes\n\nLance Gibbs seems to have had quite a \"relationship\" with wicketkeepers. There is a story about him and Pydanna. At the beginning of an over he told Pydanna that he was going to flight a couple of balls and then bowl a quicker straight ball outside the off stump and the batsman is going to overbalance in trying to play it and he should then stump him.\n\nThe scenario played out just as Lance had predicted BUT Pie did not collect the ball and it hit him in the mouth and broke one of his teeth!!!!!\n\nopenning\n\nIn reply to Dukes\n\nWhat is the purpose of the group?\n\nI looked at their age and cannot find players they worked with, in the last 3-5 years\n\nanalyst-kid\n\nIn reply to Baje\n\nLet's be accurate. Robert's terrorized us in 1975. We murdered him in 1977 1980 and 1981.\n\nWatching him in 1975 I made up my mind that I would never be good enough to play at that level.\n\nIt makes sense bro. In 1975 Sobers, Nurse,Boyce had finished and by 1977-1980 Greenidge, Haynes, Best Emmerson Trotman, Alvin Greenidge, Thelston Payne, Collis King came to the fore and with Bajans facing Clarke Daniel, Garner, Marshall in the trials, Roberts couldnt continue being a terror to Bajan batsmen.\n\nBut I went to a function, an awards ceremony four years ago in Deacons Farm in which a former Bajan batsman being awarded admitted they were terrified of Roberts bacck then.\n\nNarper\n\nKaieteur News -The Berbice Cricket Board ambitious cricket developmental programme took a giant step over the last week with close to one hundred youth cricketers in attendance at two clinics conducted by legendary test players Sir Andy Roberts and Roland Butcher\n\n.\n\nThe two clinics started on Friday with Sir Andy conducting the fast-bowling clinic with over forty young promising bowlers which included West Indies Under19 players Isia Thorne, Leon Swammy, Gevon Shultz, Sylus Tyndall, Collis Greene, Shiv Harripersaud, Shamar Joseph, Christopher Deeroop, Shamar Angel and Raymond Vankenie.\n\nButcher, who created history in 1981 when he became the first black cricketer to play for England at the Test Level, worked with over fifty players over the Three-Day Programme. Among his charges were Rampertab Ramnauth, Jonathan Rampersaud, Kevlon Anderson, Jermey Sandia, Adrian Hetmyer, Romario Ramdeholl, Ashmini Munisar, Romesh Bharat and Rampersaud Ramnauth.\n\nlink\n\nopenning\n\nIn reply to Narper\n\nYour highlights tells me the size of the class was too many.\n\nBTW, is Andy or Roland coaching?\n\nNarper"
