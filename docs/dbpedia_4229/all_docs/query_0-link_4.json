        "text": "\"I’m realising that my biggest problem, now as then,” says Andy Roberts, “is that I get so bored in the studio. I just want to bang it down and get on with something else. In the 70s, I was so busy rushing around from one gig to another, one session to another, one collaboration to another, that I couldn’t be bothered to polish anything in the way that other artists did. There wasn’t enough time. My favourite expression in the studio was ‘Will\n\nit affect sales?’ If the answer was ‘No!’ then\n\nit was good enough for me. It’s a failing.\"\n\nAndy’s ‘failing’, though, has been responsible for an extraordinarily rich and, up till now, largely untapped (on CD) seam of music from the glory days of rock. He is an enigma: a man whose story involves playing on hit singles while studying for (and achieving) a law degree in the 60s; playing on an album alongside Jimi Hendrix; hanging out at Paul McCartney’s place during The Beatles’ studio years; playing the Albert Hall with Led Zeppelin in 1969; playing both 1969 and 1970 Isle Of Wight Festivals; and, a decade later, finding himself a member of Pink Floyd for six months. He might also claim celebrity as the inverse-Pete-Best of The Rutles (being kicked out of the band by Ron Nasty as recently as 2004). And yet, who but a handful of connoisseurs and trainspotters on the mighty railway of rock have even heard of the fellow?\n\nBorn in Hatch End, London, in 1946, Andy’s dad was a music hall devotee and his mum a classical music buff. He took up the violin at nine and later dived into the skiffle boom – owning his first guitar circa 1959. His school band went through several stages – from a Shadows sound (as The Sinners) to Chicago R&B (as Blues En Noir) – “but I never thought of doing it for a living”. It was agreeing to provide live music for a late-night revue (directed by the brother of his drummer) at the 1965 Edinburgh Festival which led to the real beginnings of Andy’s path as a professional musician. The revue was led by mime artist Lindsay Kemp: in the troupe was one Vivian Stanshall, who had recently formed the Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band, “doing mime, playing the tuba and generally camping around”. The theatre was also playing host to The Scaffold, a Liverpool comedy troupe comprising Roger McGough, John Gorman and Mike McGear (ne McCartney, Paul’s brother). Andy was really impressed with their show, and by\n\na bunch of poets – including Liverpudlians Adrian Henri and Brian Patten – playing the venue during afternoons.\n\nAndy accepted an offer to study law at Liverpool University, bumping into Roger McGough at a bookshop almost as soon as he got there. The ‘jazz and poetry’ movement was at its peak, and Roger invited Andy to dive in. Soon, on the back of a 1967 poetry anthology entitled The Liverpool Scene, Adrian, Roger and Andy, along with poet/saxophonist Mike Evans and songwriter/guitarist Mike Hart, were taking bookings as ‘The Liverpool Scene Poets’.\n\nAndy was also recording with McGough’s music/ comedy outfit The Scaffold, on a series of singles which included their hits Thank U Very Much and Lily The Pink. Roger consequently had to drop out of the poetry gigs, leaving Andy to suggest to the charismatic Adrian Henri that all they needed was a bassist and drummer to become a bona fide band. Percy Jones and Bryan Dodson (later replaced by Pete Clarke) filled those roles respectively and The Liverpool Scene was born.\n\nConfusingly, an album for CBS had already been recorded, prior to the band’s formation, called The Incredible New Liverpool Scene – basically Andy accompanying Adrian Henri and Roger McGough (Brian Patten having cried off drunk at the eleventh hour), recorded over a couple of hours at a studio in Denmark Street, London. DJ John Peel took a shine to it and produced their first full-band album, Amazing Adventures Of… (RCA, 1968), in a recording deal secured by their new manager Sandy Roberton – a key figure in the careers of many now legendary acts.\n\nIn 1968, Andy graduated in law – having somehow found a way through a degree course in between\n\nsingles with The Scaffold, concerts with the\n\nScene and helping out on the Scaffold spin-off LP McGough & McGear (Parlophone, 1968), the other guitarist involved being Jimi Hendrix and the\n\nproducer Paul McCartney.\n\n“I wasn’t professional at the time but I was doing jobs that many professionals would have envied. I’d get a call to do a bit of recording in London with The Scaffold and I’d stay at Paul McCartney’s house – walk up and ring the doorbell and there’d be 85 girls hanging around outside. I didn’t even think twice about it”.\n\nThe following year saw the Liverpool Scene at their peak – delivering an eclectic but compelling second album in Bread On The Night, touring the UK on a three-act bill with Led Zeppelin and Blodwyn Pig, playing to 150,000 at the Isle Of Wight Festival (glimpsed in a fabulous Pathé Newsreel report on the event, freely available at www.britishpathe.com) and touring America for a gruelling and revelatory three months.\n\n“Absolute disaster,” is Andy’s verdict on the tour. “We suddenly came up against the utter reality of it. With a British audience, given this poetry and a band that were never rehearsed, we got away with it through being so different and through our verve and irreverence. None of which worked in America.”\n\nThe American experience would nevertheless filter into Andy’s own work for the next few years and, more immediately, inspired what he perhaps rightly regards as the band’s best work – the lengthy Made In USA suite, one whole side of their last LP proper, St. Adrian Co, Broadway And 3rd (RCA, 1970). The other side of the album – which makes Andy cringe – was recorded live at Warwick University and, to these ears, captures the wholly unique nature of the band, its music, its message and the spirit of the times that allowed it. Andy’s electric guitar heroics are not heard to more outrageous effect than on the blistering, bizarre album opener (and Roberts composition) Human Tapeworm.\n\nBut the experience of the US trip was forcing Andy to re-examine this kind of thing: “Before America\n\nI was stupid enough to still think I could be Jimi Hendrix. I wanted to be a star. You do when you’re young – you don’t realise that everybody has their role, and that wasn’t mine.” Andy still recalls some sage advice he received around this time from folk-baroque guitar hero Davy Graham: ‘The only person you should be in competition with today is yourself yesterday’.\n\nThe first Andy Roberts album, Home Grown, was recorded in late 1969, and built upon the quirky solo tracks he had to date peppered among the Liverpool Scene albums, such as the chillingly surreal The Raven and 64 (a be-warned depiction of life at the Scene’s pad, 64, Canning Street, Liverpool), from 1968’s Bread On The Night. Those two tracks conveniently represent the poles of Andy’s writing: the vaguely profound and the purely comedic. Making these parameters sit well together on one piece of vinyl was the question which would quickly colour Andy’s own view of his first solo album – or, at least, its original form, as released by RCA (under a production deal with Sandy Roberton) in March 1970.\n\n‘Infinitely listenable and beautifully arranged, with excellent guitar work from Andy. A lovely, peaceful album.’ That was Disc’s judgement on this atmospheric, rough-hewn debut, on which Andy was backed on some tracks by the rhythm section from Mighty Baby (another of Sandy Roberton’s charges), with brass arrangements from future Jethro Tull man David Palmer.\n\nAn eclectic album, punctuated with brief bursts of violin and organ noodling, key tracks included the ragtime/country flavoured numbers Home Grown and Gig Song (the lifestyle of a working musician in Britain in the 60s condensed into three minutes), the richly impressionistic Moths And Lizards In Detroit (first of the ‘American’ songs) and the epic Applecross, an altogether gothic creation inspired by a weekend in a remote village of that name in north-west Scotland. The spooky vibe was continued on the traditional John The Revelator and a funky cover of Spider John Koerner’s Creepy John.\n\nAndy performed several Home Grown items on his debut solo session for John Peel’s Top Gear radio show in March 1970, along with the driving non-album track You’re A Machine, on which he was again backed by Mighty Baby. A rehearsal of the track, recorded shortly before the BBC session, is included on the definitive new 2-CD Andy Roberts Anthology (Sanctuary, 2005).\n\nAlso in March 1970, Andy guested on The Shelagh McDonald Album, the debut offering from another of Sandy Roberton’s talented stable of artists. Andy produced, uncredited, several of the album’s tracks (confirmed by a session reel recently unearthed in his loft), among which was Shelagh’s arrangement of Andy’s song Richmond – an evocative memoir of hero-worshipping Jeff Beck (pre-Yardbirds) down at Eel Pie Island, which somehow manages to make the trouble one had getting a bus home afterwards sound like a romance worthy of DH Lawrence. If Shelagh’s version was a tad limp, Andy’s own eventual recording of it – first heard on the Sandy Roberton stable’s sampler album Clogs (Pegasus, 1972) – was a tour de force.\n\nThe Liverpool Scene finally split, on-stage at a London gig, in May 1970. In Andy’s recollection (“Adrian attacking Mike Evans with a mic stand”)\n\nit had been building up for a while.\n\nSoon after the split, Andy crashed a motorcycle and was out of action for a couple of months, but had recovered well enough by July to accompany Adrian Henri – along with Dave Richards on bass, Alan Peters on trumpet and John Pearson on drums – to Norway for a couple of gigs, booked as The Liverpool Scene.\n\nRegrouping with Adrian had been Andy’s hope, but it wasn’t to be. Despite the Scene’s perceived success, as Andy explained to Record Mirror, “nobody really made any more than about £20 a week. I was going to form a band with Adrian after the Scene split, but he backed out. You’ve got to remember, he’s 39, and £20 with the Scene wasn’t much”. A few months later, RCA managed to cobble together a posthumous collection, Heirloon, notably featuring the classic non-album B-side Love Is, some more from the Warwick University live set originally recorded for the St. Adrian Co album, and a selection of recordings of their eclectic accompaniment to the show J’Emerveille, written by Adrian Henri and Michael Kustow, about the life of the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, which was performed at the London Institute Of Contemporary Art in late 1968.\n\nAndy pressed ahead with his new band – now titled Everyone. Retaining Richards and Pearson from the Norway trip, he added John Porter on\n\nguitar, and took Porter’s recommendation to bring in Bob Sargent on keyboards which, he now says, “was probably the worst of several moves. Bob was great but we weren’t really compatible”.\n\nHaving played one gig – the 1970 Isle Of Wight Festival, no less – they released an album, Everyone, on Polydor in January 1971, which in Andy’s view was “frankly, a bit of a mess: there was Bob’s stuff and my stuff and it didn’t really meet in the middle”. The album included four songs fronted by Andy: a Buddy Holly cover, Midnight Shift, and a beautiful trio of originals in Don’t Get Me Wrong (a reflection on recent US student uprisings against the Vietnam War), Sitting On A Rock (inspired by the Norway trip) and Radio Lady, another memoir of the Scene’s US tour. Radio Lady was the B-side of a rare picture-sleeved single (with Andy’s Trouble At The Mill the A-side) and would re-appear, later in 1971, in the form of a superior mix, with a new guitar part from Tim Renwick of Quiver, on the US version of the album on the Ampex label. There would also be a US Andy Roberts solo album on Ampex that year – bizarrely, called Home Grown, though it was actually a compilation of tracks from the UK album of that name plus four completely new recordings (more of which below).\n\nWhether Everyone could have found the common musical ground to continue is academic, for the band were effectively destroyed by a tragic accident involving their road crew on the A33 in November 1970. The group’s van and gear were written off and Paul Scard, Andy’s loyal roadie, lost his life.\n\nShortly after the crash, Andy and Dave Richards rented a house near Northampton for a month. This brief period would yield the material that found its way onto Andy’s next solo album proper, Nina And The Dream Tree, a year later. “We played a lot of Bezique, and played Neil Young and Grateful Dead records. I was visited by Polly James (actress in the popular TV sitcom The Liver Birds), with whom I was seriously involved, and who is the subject of the whole of the first side of Nina. Bizarrely, Polly and I spent New Year’s Eve at Tommy Steele’s house that year”.\n\nAndy was back in London by January ’71, living with his folks and wondering what to do, when he got a call out from Paul Samwell-Smith, ex-Yardbirds bassist and now a record producer. He was looking for a guitarist to work on a debut solo album by former Fairport Convention and Matthews’ Southern Comfort vocalist Iain Matthews – hot property after MSC’s September 1970 No. 1 hit single with Woodstock. Andy and Iain hit it off together, and the new association with himself and Samwell-Smith “put me into seven months’ intense studio work with Iain and Cat Stevens and so on. Then Sandy Roberton was saying I hadn’t done a solo album for a year and should do something.”\n\nWork on the Iain Matthews album (If You Saw Thro’ My Eyes) spanned January to March 1971 (April to May ’71 would see further studio work with Iain, which became his next album, Tigers Will Survive). In March he worked on the Mike McGear LP Woman (Island, 1972), and he was also, to quote a Melody Maker feature of the period, ‘experimenting on a solo album, using vocal backing from three West Indians (but no flash guitar)’. Those backing singers, who played a crucial part in the magical sound of Nina And The Dream Tree (recorded sporadically during the next few months), were Mike London and Mac and Katie Kissoon. Three gorgeous pieces of Nina’s jigsaw had been debuted on a BBC session for Bob Harris earlier that month – Keep My Children Warm, I’ve Seen The Movie and Welcome Home – although the listing of musicians involved, essentially a reunion of Everyone, as given in Ken Garner’s In Session Tonight (BBC Books, 1993) strikes Andy in retrospect as ‘hugely unlikely’.\n\nMuch of the Melody Maker interview concerned GRIMMS, a sextet involving Andy, the three members of The Scaffold plus Viv Stanshall, and Neil Innes from the Bonzo Dog Band, with aspirations to being a surreal revue ensemble with musical content influenced by German satirical cabaret and kitsch Las Vegas crooning. But Andy can recall no GRIMMS activity until two shows later in the year, in Greenwich and Corby, the former featuring The Who’s Keith Moon on drums. “Both of these were booked as Scaffold gigs, and I don’t think the punters were all that pleased!”\n\nGRIMMS became a regular performing entity in 1972, when Andy was otherwise engaged as a member of Plainsong. But in being – by the time Plainsong folded in December ’72 – an established concert draw with a UK tour coming up, it provided Andy’s momentarily off-the-rails career with a soft landing. The GRIMMS brand enjoyed live popularity during the mid-70s and recorded three albums (GRIMMS, 1973; Rockin’ Duck, 1973; Sleepers, 1976). Sleepers, which includes Andy’s beautiful Bluebird Morning and his prog-rock behemoth The Worst Is Yet To Come, recently made its CD debut on Hux. Andy’s increasingly legendary loft has since yielded a plethora of out-takes, and a ‘deluxe version’ of the album is a possibility in due course.\n\nDuring the early summer of ’71, Andy was enjoying himself playing shows with a proto-GRIMMS outfit billed as the Bonzo Dog Freaks. If this was meant as a blast from the future, Sandy Roberton had engineered a blast from the past: a new lease of life for Home Grown. Sandy’s licensing allegiance had now switched from RCA to B&C/Pegasus. Consequently, in June 1971, Andy found himself promoting it all over again:\n\n‘We’ve remixed and re-recorded some of it,’ he explained to Sounds, ‘and changed some of the tracks which didn’t quite work the first time. So this is almost a different album. It’s certainly better than the original one and bears more relation to me as I am now – but it’s still 18 months old. To confuse the issue still further, there’s an album going to be released in the States which will also be called Home Grown, because apparently they like the title, but that one will only have three tracks from the original album, and four or five totally new ones which haven’t been released here yet. This means that America will be half an album ahead of here, [but] I’m reluctant to let those tracks go unreleased over here.’\n\nThose tracks, of course, thankfully ended up on Andy’s next UK album. But, over 30 years on, in trying to pin down the ‘definitive’ versions of the required Home Grown tracks for the new Sanctuary anthology, even Andy was surprised at the differences between the RCA and B&C versions of the album. Some tracks are essentially the same, others are quite substantially different – almost all better, in Andy’s view. Incidentally, the only previous Andy Roberts CD of his early-70s work, 1990’s Best Of Andy Roberts on Mooncrest, sourced all its Home Grown tracks, knowingly or not, from the RCA version.\n\nHome Grown’s re-release provided an excuse for Andy to perform, supporting Procol Harum, at London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall, backed by Dave Richards and Mighty Baby’s Ian Whiteman and Roger Powell. It would be the stage debut of the Nina material, and was a precursor to Andy getting the support slot on a Steeleye Span UK tour later that year.\n\nDuring July ’71, Andy was able to tell Melody Maker’s Karl Dallas that: ‘For the first time I’ve got a coherent direction. Now I have personal statements I wish to make, though I don’t want to knock them in with a sledgehammer.’ Dallas was given a preview of the new Nina-bound recordings and was rightly impressed: ‘There is a great deal of warmth in his work,’ he wrote, ‘a fellowship for his kin which brims over… His singing voice has matured incredibly and his use of the electric guitar is haunting, reminiscent sometimes of Richard Thompson on top form.’\n\nSpending August-September ’71 on an Iain Matthews tour of the States as a trio with Richard Thompson himself would be a rich seam for his song writing. Time spent with one Karen Goskowski at the Poison Apple in Boston would yield three songs, first heard on his country-flavoured Urban Cowboy LP in 1973: Poison Apple Lady, Urban Cowboy and New Karenski. Some of the credit for Andy’s new skills at honing personal experiences into his creative process was down to Iain Matthews: ‘Iain has brought me more out of myself,’ he explained to Record Mirror in August. ‘I’ve had to cultivate my lack of self-consciousness to the point where I’m ludicrously casual about the whole thing. A nice way to work…’\n\nRight after the tour, Andy cameoed on Richard Thompson’s solo debut, Henry The Human Fly, and in October Nina And The Dream Tree was finally released. Andy toured the UK in support of the record, as a trio with Bobby Ronga and Dave Richards, as guests of Steeleye Span. “A great pleasure,” Andy recalls. “All the gigs were great.”\n\nTypically, he was already working up a whole new batch of songs – including Poison Apple Lady, Richmond and Elaine, all aired on a Bob Harris BBC session in November. That same month he also performed live with Viv Stanshall and others as the Human Beans (yet another mercurial Bonzo-related project) and was working on the Bonzos’ reunion album, Let’s Make Up And Be Friendly, at the Manor Studio – “where Mike Oldfield was recording Tubular Bells in our down time!”\n\nA late November ’71 interview with Mark Plummer for Melody Maker touched on many of the pies Andy had fingers in. Plummer’s conclusion was interesting: ‘I got the impression that although he wants to entertain and loves working with as many people as he can cram into his diary, a lot of it is down to a fear about going onstage as a front man.’\n\nRight on cue, Andy agreed to submerge himself in a band with Iain Matthews, Bob Ronga and Dave Richards: Plainsong. The group, a country-influenced vocal harmony outfit, spanned the entirety of 1972, recording the classic In Search Of Amelia Earhart and the (at the time unreleased) Plainsong II, and touring Europe extensively. Save for backing Adrian Henri on a couple of BBC radio dates, Andy’s focus for the whole year would be the band. And then, around Christmas ’72, with Matthews lured to a solo deal with Elektra, it dissolved in disappointment.\n\nBy way of consolation, Andy secured a solo deal himself with Elektra – yielding two albums in 1973, Urban Cowboy and Andy Roberts & The Great Stampede. Immediately after the Plainsong split, though, Andy was able to jump on board an already-booked GRIMMS UK tour (that band having built up a live following the previous year, without Andy’s involvement). In Andy’s words, the tour with old friends was “the best antidote to the Plainsong blues. A fantastic relief”.\n\nUrban Cowboy, featuring Richard Thompson, Neil Innes, Iain Matthews and Martin Carthy, alongside old stalwarts Richards and Ronga, and consisting of some new recordings and some tracks recorded prior to Plainsong, was released with lightning speed in March 1973. One track, All Around My Grandmother’s Floor, was actually a fabulous Plainsong left-over which can be heard, alongside studio albums and live and demo tracks, on the Plainsong 2-CD set (on Water, 2005).\n\nAfter the GRIMMS dates Andy put in time working solo in folk clubs, and got married (to Jacqui Byford) in May – honeymooning in Jamaica for a month. Andy would write a number of songs with reggae influence coming out of the Jamaica experience – Living In The Hills Of Zion, recorded right after the honeymoon in June ’73, being the best.\n\nThe following month Charisma released the compilation Andy Roberts, featuring material from the pre-Plainsong albums, but Andy was already focused on creating what he regards as his finest album, Andy Roberts & The Great Stampede – clearing his diary for a whole month in the summer to record it, with musicians including BJ Cole (pedal steel), Patto’s Ollie Halsall (lead guitar), Mick Kaminski (violin, and later with ELO), Zoot Money (keyboards) and Sandy Denny associates Pat Donaldson (bass) and Gerry Conway (drums). The result was a powerful, luxuriantly produced soft-rock album which moved him once and for all away from any assumptions of being part of the British folk scene – one to which Andy was never closer than semi-detachment.\n\n‘The reason I called it Andy Roberts & The Great Stampede was that I was hoping people would think of it as a band. I don’t want people to think that the only thing that’s on it is me,’ Andy explained to Melody Maker in December 1973. ‘It’s the first time I’ve ever made an album in one go… It’s the first one that I’ve done all the vocals on – all the harmonies. That was something that I got out of Plainsong.’\n\nAndy had just finished a second sizeable UK tour with GRIMMS when he gave the interview. ‘It’s been about equal amounts of solo and GRIMMS with a bit of nothing in between,’ he said. ‘It’s been a good year artistically and I’m very pleased with Stampede. The next one will be better.’\n\nUnfortunately, there would be no ‘next one’. Andy had been able to promote both of his 1973 albums with radio sessions and press interviews, but unfortunately – just as he felt he’d delivered his best work with Stampede – his luck was running out. The three-day week, vinyl shortages and the sale of Elektra to David Geffen (with implications for their UK pressing and distribution) effectively wrecked the album’s release. Andy believes only around 1500 copies managed to trickle out and, tellingly, has not once in over 30 years been offered a copy to sign.”\n\nRoberts bowed out with a BBC session for John Peel in March 1974. He then dived into a Liverpool Scene reunion tour, with Adrian Henri, Mike Hart, Dave Richards on bass and Mike Kellie on drums. It was, to Andy’s recollection, “musically the best line-up of all time. And I was a simpler, straighter, less pretentious kind of guy, I like to think!”\n\nFrom then on, Andy became simply a musician for hire, working in theatre and seeing out the decade with GRIMMS and then as a member of both Roy Harper’s band and the Albion Band. He describes working on the 1978 Roger McGough album Summer With Monika as ‘the end of the poetry trajectory started 10 years before by Liverpool Scene. Sadly, no one noticed.”\n\nIn 1980, he began a four-year tenure with comedy country icon Hank Wangford’s band, taking time out in 1980 to join an expanded version of Pink Floyd to perform The Wall in Germany and at London’s Earl’s Court. Theatre, TV and film soundtrack work rolled on thereafter, interspersed with occasional gigs backing Adrian Henri’s poetry. In 1990, a chance meeting with Iain Matthews resulted in a Plainsong revival, which has thus far delivered several new albums and periodic tours – although Matthews is now apparently focused on reviving Matthews’ Southern Comfort, before his rather portentously announced retirement on June 16 2007.\n\nWith much of the Liverpool Scene, GRIMMS and solo recordings now reverting back to the musicians, possibilities include a Liverpool Scene box set, an expanded GRIMMS’ Sleepers and a full release for Andy Roberts & The Great Stampede – all from the original masters.\n\nInfo: www.andyrobertsmusic.com."
