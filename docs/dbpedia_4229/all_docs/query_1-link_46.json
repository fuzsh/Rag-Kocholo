        "text": "Andrew Roberts is a violinist and member of our Quartet-in-Residence, the Fitzwilliam String Quartet.\n\nHe has been known to the Fitzwilliam players for many years – and first teamed up with them in July 2019, taking part in a performance of the Mendelssohn Octet, and thereafter as second violinist during the periods before, during, and after the various Covid lockdowns. Andrew comes from a highly distinguished dynasty: his father was the great pianist Bernard Roberts, and his brother Nicholas is cellist of the Coull Quartet; for over fifteen years they played together in the Bernard Roberts Piano Trio, releasing recordings of music by Frank Bridge and Stephen Dodgson to critical acclaim. A founder of the Chamber Orchestra of Europe and long-time member of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, he is equally at home in the ‘modern’ and the ‘historically informed’ musical worlds. An experienced chamber musician, he was a member of the Auriol Quartet, and has been a guest of many ensembles such as the Dante and Salomon Quartets, Lontano, and Hausmusik, and also has an ongoing duo partnership with pianist Rachel Fryer."
