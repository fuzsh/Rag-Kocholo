        "text": "Iain Matthews is an English musician and singer-songwriter born 1946 in Barton-upon-Humber, Lincolnshire. Matthews was an original member of the British folk rock band Fairport Convention from 1967 to 1969, appearing on their first three albums, before leaving to form his own band, Matthews Southern Comfort, and pursue a solo career. Originally named Ian MacDonald, he changed his name to Ian Matthews in 1968 to avoid confusion with Ian McDonald of King Crimson with whom Judy Dyble began working when she left Fairport. In 1969 Matthews recorded his debut solo album, Matthews' Southern Comfort which was rooted in American country music and rockabilly. Backing him on the album were ex-Fairport colleagues Richard Thompson, Simon Nicol and Ashley Hutchings. The following year he formed his own band named Matthews Southern Comfort, who released three albums in one year, one being the excellent Later That Same Year. The group also had a #1 UK hit with a cover version of Joni Mitchell's song \"Woodstock\". In 1971, Matthews recorded two solo albums, the superb If You Saw Thro' My Eyes and Tigers Will Survive, on Vertigo Records. He then formed another band Plainsong with ex-The Liverpool Scene member Andy Roberts. Plainsong's debut 1972 album In Search of Amelia Earhart songs on the theme of the legendary aviatrix, plus the song \"Even the Guiding Light\", Matthews' answer to Thompson's \"Meet on the Ledge\". Matthews has had a remarkable career as soloist, collaborator and band leader, producing innumerable albums, and he continues to perform occasionally with Fairport at the Cropredy Festival. Standout albums include Matthews' Southern Comfort, If You Saw Thro' My Eyes, Journeys From Gospel Oak, Some Days You Eat The Bear And Some Days The Bear Eats You, Later That Same Year and In Search of Amelia Earhart. 2008's Joy Mining, a collaboration with Searing Quartet, is also recommended.\n\nArtist Website: ianmatthews.com\n\nFeatured Albums: Ian Matthews\n\nRelated Artists: Fairport Convention, Plainsong, Matthews Southern Comfort, Iain Matthews"
