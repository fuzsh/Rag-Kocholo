He was a true legend and a game changer-Tells Hirav Shah, Renowned Sports Strategist and Advisor.\n\nAndy Roberts’s Early Life:\n\nFather of modern West Indian fast bowling, Andy Roberts was born on 29 January 1951 in Urlings, Saint Mary, Antigua and Barbuda..\n\nArriving in England in 1972, he played first-class cricket for Hampshire County Cricket Club and then later for Leicestershire County Cricket Club.\n\nThe rest as we call it is “History”-Starting from the fact that Roberts was the first Antiguan to play Test cricket for the West Indies.\n\n[wpdatatable id=96]\n\nLife Lessons from Andy Roberts:\n\n1.No Expressions, Only Impact\n\nAndy was an expressionless assassin.

And then they came one after the other — Eldine Baptiste, Richie Richardson, Winston Benjamin, Kenny Benjamin, Curtly Ambrose and Ridley Jacobs.\n\nThe father of modern West Indian fast bowling, Roberts played Test cricket for the West Indies, twice taking seven wickets in a Test innings.\n\nRoberts was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame, in 2009.\n\nFinally, he was the uncontested leader of the pack — a pack such as the planet has never seen before or since-Concludes Renowned Sports Astrologer Hirav Shah.\n\nImage Credit : pinkvilla.com\n\nHirav Shah’s simple funda is if you are DOING business or BUYING business or STARTING any PROJECT, you should be able to make money as per POTENTIAL of BUSINESS or PROJECT.\n\nIf you are not able to make MONEY as per POTENTIAL of your business, means there must be some problem in your HARDWORK or STRATEGIES or EXECUTION or TALENT or LUCK.\n\nHirav is a pioneer in introducing the most popular Astro Strategy™ for Business revolution to increase CERTAINTY of SUCCESS.\n\nHe combines Business Principles with Astrology and brings STRATEGIC SOLUTIONS to the table while maintaining absolute CONFIDENTIALITY.\n\nHirav Shah is the top advisor in the fields of Real Estate, Corporate Business, Sports, Hollywood, Bollywood, Tourism, Politics & more.
