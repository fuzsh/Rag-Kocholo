        "text": "Andy Roberts, who made his debut for the Leeward Islands in 1969-70, was the first in a line of West Indies cricketers from the smaller Caribbean islands to establish themselves in the Test side. He beat his compatriot Viv Richards into the West Indies side by one season, making his debut in 1973-74, against England in Bridgetown. West Indies had been without a really fast bowler for several years since the retirement of Hall and Griffith. In India in 1974-75 Roberts took six wickets in the Bangalore Test, eight in Calcutta, then 7-64 and 5-57 in Madras, though West Indies lost those last two matches. In Australia in 1975-76 Michael Holding joined him with the new ball for the first time. Roberts best performance was 7-54 in Perth. On the England tour of 1976 he had 28 wickets at an average of 19.17, including 5-60 and 5-63 at Lord's and 6-37 at Old Trafford.\n\nTo his extreme pace he added a probing length and direction and batsmen particularly feared his bouncer. It was said he bowled two bouncers - one aimed to give the batsman a chance to hook, immediately followed by another, faster and flatter, which would tempt the stroke again and invariably produce a miss-hit. In the World Cup of 1975 he was almost impossible to score from, bowling 12 overs for just 16 runs and two wickets against Sri Lanka at Old Trafford and 2-18 in 11 overs in the semi-final against New Zealand. It was his batting which played the most important role. A last wicket partnership of 64 with Deryck Murray, in which Roberts made 24 not out, gave West Indies an unexpected victory over Pakistan and kept them in the competition. By the time the West Indies side returned from World Series Cricket they had fast bowlers queueing up to take the ball after Roberts had had his fill. In Australia in 1979-80 they had what was probably the greatest line up of the four fast bowlers: Roberts, Holding, Garner and Croft. At any other time in cricket history all four would have taken more wickets, but batsmen found them so unplayable that often they ended up with just two or three each in an innings. Roberts, though, was beginning to show signs of wear and tear. In England in 1980 injury kept him to three Tests, although he still had 5-72 and 3-73 in the Trent Bridge Test. He also bashed England for a heartbreaking 50 not out in Port of Spain in 1981.\n\nIn Australia in 1981-82 he had 4-43 at Adelaide and took 4-61 and 5-39 when India came to Sabina Park in 1982-83. He went with West Indies to India in 1983-4 but again injury kept him to just two of the six Tests. He still led the West Indies attack in the World Cup of 1983, scoring 37 not out against India at Old Trafford and taking 1-14 in seven overs against Australia at Headingley, 3-36 against Zimbabwe, 2-29 against India at the Oval, 2-25 against Pakistan in the semi-final at the Oval and 3-32 against India in the final. \"He was the most frightening fast bowler I ever faced\", said Australian wicket keeper Rod Marsh.\"He'd bowl you a bouncer and you'd watch it go by.. he'd bowl another and you'd look at it. Then the next would be 20 m.p.h. faster and at your throat. Andy just looked at you as if to say: \"I am your master.\" (Bob Harragan)"
