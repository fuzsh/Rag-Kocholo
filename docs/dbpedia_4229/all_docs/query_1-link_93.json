        "text": "On Wednesday May 8 at 7:00 PM, The Dorothy Rose Concert Series will be presenting Andy Roberts’ Four Piece Quartet.\n\nThe Four Piece Quartet is a unique jazz group that focuses on reimagined arrangements of inspirational music. Musically they pull from American songbook standards to traditional hymns and original music. Along with a fresh approach to the arrangements, the quartet incorporates the jazz spirit of spontaneity and improvisation throughout all their music."
