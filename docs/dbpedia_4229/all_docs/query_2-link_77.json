However, before he could sign on the dotted line to officially buy the town for 1 million dollars, he, to Johnny and Moira's dismay, slipped into a coma; Partially due to consuming a large amount of Jocelyn Schitt's homemade macaroni and cheese.\n\nHe makes his only appearance in the episode Town for Sale.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nTown for Sale"
