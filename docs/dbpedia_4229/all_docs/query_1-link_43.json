Hence 'Live Lounge\" \nEnjoy two hours (with interval) of interesting live music while enjoying company and drinks from the reasonably priced bottle bar. \nAndy Roberts is a seasoned Island based singer songwriter with a large repertoire of interesting catchy originals and some covers mainly from the 1970s including inspirations Roy Harper, Michael Chapman, Pink Floyd, Richard Thompson, The Faces and many more.  Accomplished guitar work carries through all the songs including interpretations of band songs, and the voice in his mid sixties has lost none of it's power and tone.",
