        "text": "Andy Roberts was born in Kenya and grew up on the shores of Lake Baringo in the Great Rift Valley. Growing up with animals and living in tents for much of his life, Andy and his brothers have been involved in the safari and hospitality industry for more than 40 years. In his teenage years, Andy and his brother Willy ran mobile safari camps in the Maasai Mara and together they set up Rusinga Island Camp on the shores of Lake Victoria which they successfully sold in 1990.\n\nAndy also has a passion for construction and has built 2 private houses, one on Lewa conservancy (now Lewa House) and Laragai House on Borana Conservancy. His knowledge of birds is extensive and he was on the team that set the World record for the largest number of species sighted in a 24 hour period in 1985 with ornithologist Terry Stevenson and John Fanshawe. He has lived and worked in Uganda and Southern Sudan and set up The Safari and Conservation Company (SCC) in 2006. Alongside SCC, Andy owns and runs Manda Bay on the coast of Kenya in Lamu. Andy is an experienced commercial bush pilot and has guided many flying safaris taking guests to extraordinary places on exciting and unusual itineraries. He is practical with a great sense of humour and a big personality. Life is always good and safaris are interesting and adventurous."
