        "text": "Kiss is having a revamp. Why?\n\nKiss has not really moved anywhere for the past couple of years, so the format needed to evolve. There have already been some gradual changes at Kiss 100 in London, including a revamped music policy and a change from Bam Bam to Robin Banks as presenter of the breakfast show. The music had become very urban, a bit dark and moody, and it is more optimistic now. The breakfast show involves the listeners more and is a happier place than the previous show.\n\nWhat more is planned?\n\nOn 6 September, Vibe 101 in Bristol and Vibe FM in East Anglia will relaunch as Kiss 101 and Kiss 105-108. The rest of the Kiss Network will also relaunch. We will also be joined exclusively by new DJs and presenters, including Carl Cox and Armin van Buuren.\n\nHow can PROs help?\n\nWe appreciate being given access to interesting people and events, although we need flexibility. We have to have fun with a brand or an interviewee to give something back to the listener.\n\nHow can PROs help with the website?\n\nAny additional visual content for online would be welcomed, and should go to web editor Matt Baskerville. In which musicians are you interested?\n\nWe are not working to record company agendas with release dates - if a great song is out there, we will play it, whether the artist is signed or not. One of the biggest tracks we are playing at the moment is something we found on MySpace.\n\nHow should PROs get in touch?\n\nEmail me. Enquiries should go directly to me - we don't allow PROs to contact DJs directly as we are very strict on what we will and will not do. PROs should think about the type of audience we serve."
