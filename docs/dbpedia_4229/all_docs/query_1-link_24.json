        "text": "Andy Roberts has been a true Renaissance man of the British music scene since the 1960s. He has played with an impressive range of artists as well as forging his own career as a musician, singer, songwriter and composer. Andy made several LPs for the B&C label, including one as part of an outfit called Everyone, and had one compilation LP released on Charisma.\n\nI had the pleasure of meet Andy on several occasions in the early 90s when I went on a tour to the annual Fairport Convention festival and other musical events several times. The above photo is from a private concert on a boat on the Thames in London when Andy was playing with Iain Matthews."
