Theodor Körner (born Sept. 23, 1791, Dresden, Saxony—died Aug. 26, 1813, Gadebusch, Mecklenburg) was a German patriotic poet of the war of liberation against Napoleon in 1813 whose death in Lützow’s volunteer corps made him a popular hero.

His father, Christian Gottfried Körner, was a friend of Friedrich Schiller. Körner grew up in a house frequented by writers and scientists. He studied philosophy in Berlin, where he attended the lectures of the famous philosophers Johann Gottlieb Fichte and Friedrich Schleiermacher. By 1812 the Vienna Burgtheater had produced three of his dramatic works, the most ambitious of which, Zriny (1812), with its glorification of love for the fatherland, made him famous throughout Germany. His dramas, however, are now largely forgotten. After his death at age 22, his father collected the best of his militantly passionate patriotic poetry in Leyer und Schwert (1814; “Lyre and Sword”), which was received enthusiastically and filled his contemporaries with feelings of patriotism.
