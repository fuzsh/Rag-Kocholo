        "text": "The Institute for Jazz was established in 1964 at the Academy for Music and Performing Arts in Graz. It officially began on 01.01.1965. Today, the institution is widely regarded as Europe's first independent institute in the field of artistic and scientific jazz education at an academic level.[1] Due to its proximity to the Institute for Jazz Research, Graz has become an academic center for the artistic and scientific study of jazz. The initiator and first director of the Institute for Jazz until 1970 was the classically trained trumpet player and musicologist Friedrich Körner (1931-2021). Körner ensured the further development, professionalization and internationalization of the institute through various efforts. These included the organization of competitions, workshops, concert series, festivals, and performances by institute ensembles in Graz and at international events. Körner's initiatives also include the development of interdisciplinary scientific research in jazz and the establishment of jazz research as a new branch of musicology. In 1969, together with the pianist, composer, arranger and musicologist Dieter Glawischnig (*1938), he founded the International Society for Jazz Research, based in Graz. Körner initiated Jazz Research, the world's first and still regularly published series of jazz research publications. He organized the first jazz research conference in Graz.\n\nThe institutional separation into two research and practice-oriented educational institutions happened in 1971. Glawischnig took over as head of the Jazz Department, while Körner was appointed as the first head of the Institute for Jazz Research. From 1975 to 1983, pianist and composer Harald Neuwirth (*1939) led the Graz Department of Jazz. He initiated a restructuring of the curriculum and developed new jazz-specific courses. With the organization of the \"Deutschlandsberg Big Band Seminars\" with teachers and students of the Department of Jazz and international guest soloists and Peter Herbholzheimer, Neuwirth was able to gain international media attention for the pioneering work in Graz in the field of jazz education.\n\nIn 1982, Neuwirth was largely responsible for organizing a jazz focus as part of the World Music Festival of the International Society for New Music (IGNM) in Graz and Vienna in cooperation with the \"Steirischer Herbst\" art festival. In the same year, the work of the Jazz Department was honored by an invitation to perform at a musical soiree in the Audience Hall of the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research. Saxophonist and composer Karlheinz Miklin (1964-2019) became head of the department from 1983 to 2000. A first milestone was the ORF production of George Gruntz's jazz oratorio \"The Holy Grail of Jazz and Joy\" in 1985, for which various ensembles of the University of Music in Graz collaborated with famous soloists such as Bobby McFerrin and Sheila Jordan. Subsequently, the possibility of jazz vocal training at the Jazz Department developed. Vocal jazz was incorporated into the curriculum in 1991. In addition to Jordan, vocal lectures were supervised by other guest professors, such as Andy Bey, Jay Clayton and Mark Murphy.\n\nIn cooperation with the Graz jazz initiative \"GamsbART\", Miklin established the concert series \"Graz Meeting\" starting in 1987, followed by a festival of the same name starting in 1992, which was held annually with a changing thematic approach. In 1988, the Jazz Department moved to Moserhofgasse 39-41, where it is still located. A recording studio for the jazz department and its students was set up in the new building of the University in Brandhofgasse, which was completed in 1993. Miklin was also a member of the \"International Association of Schools of Jazz\" (IASJ) - from 1996 as a board member. From 2003 to 2012, he was the chairman of the board - especially to promote the international networking of the Graz jazz department within the rapidly expanding landscape of jazz educational institutions.\n\nIn 1993 the first IASJ meeting took place in Graz. In the same year, the MHS Big Band under the artistic direction of Stjepko Gut won the \"Billa Big Band Contest\" initiated by Karl Wlaschek. In the following year the MHS-Big Band had several concerts in the USA (New York and Boston). Starting in 1998, the Jazz Big Band Graz, founded by Sigi Feigl, offered another opportunity for the professional development of graduates and current students.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2002, the composer, arranger and trombonist Karl Heinz Czadek (*1944) became the head of the department. He was again succeeded by Neuwirth as head of the institution, under the name of \"Institute for Jazz\". Two independent evaluations of the Institute in 2003 and 2006-2007 confirmed its extraordinary international reputation and its rank as one of the most distinguished institutions of the KUG.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2020, the US-born trombonist, tuba player, composer, arranger and orchestra conductor Edward Anthony Partyka (*1967) took over as director of the Institute for Jazz. Partyka set up an \"Artist in Residence\" program with numerous internationally renowned guest lecturers, which brought Bob Brookmeyer, among others, to Graz for a month. Under his direction, the jazz composition competition \"Jazz-Comp-Graz\", established as a triennial since 2011, increases the international visibility of jazz composition scene in Graz. In 2012, another annual meeting of the IASJ took place in Graz. Under Partyka's direction, the Institute for Jazz also developed into one of the most active jazz organizers in Graz, with a frequency of about 140 concerts per year.\n\nSince 2020, saxophonist and orchestra leader Sigi Feigl (*1961) serves as the institute's director. Feigl's artistic activity is linked to the history of the Institute for Jazz and has played a significant role in the internationalization and professionalization of local jazz life, in particular through the events of the ensembles Big Band Süd (1979-1997) and Jazz Big Band Graz (1998-), which he founded and directed, and the Jazz Festival Leibnitz (1994-2012). In 2011 he was awarded the \"Great Honorary of the Province of Styria\" in appreciation for his cultural achievements.\n\nDuring the almost 60-year period from its founding until today, the Graz Institute for Jazz has enjoyed international recognition. Numerous graduates of this institution are pillars of international jazz life and many of them work as professors and lecturers at universities, conservatories and music schools."
