        "text": "Bridget Boyum, ASC\n\nCommunity Leader Scholar '12\n\nThe students of Newman University are forever grateful and inspired by the sisters of the Adorers of the Blood of Christ. We are thankful that they founded Newman, and continue to sponsor and support the university. The Sisters' spirit of service and stewardship is ingrained in this university, shaping its students and encouraging them to go out and make a difference in our world. They have always been our \"living endowment!\"\n\nBelow is a list of all ASC members (and their biographies) who have served on this campus. While this list is set to be in the order which they came, not all accounts can be considered accurate chronologically. To search for a sister alphabetically, see \"Search A-Z\" below.\n\nSt. Maria De Mattias\n\nMaria was a woman who loved passionately; she loved God and she loved others. She was born on February 4, 1805, in Vallecorsa, Italy to Giovanni and Ottavia De Mattias; she was baptized that same day as was the custom of the times. Maria was a woman of the word; the Word of God came to dwell in her heart from the day of her baptism and from the lips of her father as he told her the stories from God's written word. As she grew the Word of God came to her from the Sunday sermons; she became enamored with the image of the Lamb of God, who gave his blood for the sake of all. This early image led her to found a congregation of women religious, and she claimed that the spirit of this congregation was \"all love: love for God and the dear neighbor.\" This love made her a contemplative woman of apostolic action, and it was on March 4, 1834 that Maria founded her congregation in the small mountain town of Acuto. Up and down the mountains and valleys of central Italy Maria De Mattias became known as \"the woman who preached.\" Not only women and girls but also men and boys and even the clergy filled the piazzas and churches where Maria spoke. Women came from the surrounding villages to join her; she knew that this small band was growing and that there was need for a rule to guide their lifestyle as well as more adequate space to accommodate their needs. For forty years Maria turned constantly to Father John Merlini for spiritual guidance and for direction in the development of the congregation of the Adorers. At times he needed to provide special guidance in how she dealt with the priests and the bishops of the areas where the sisters were settling. Although Maria was obedient to those giving direction in her life, she also challenged some of the statements and actions of those members of the clergy who questioned her actions and intentions. She is often referred to as the \"obedient rebel\", a name which truly captured her mind and heart. Maria took time to communicate with her sisters and those with whom they labored; the congregation has a treasure in the hundreds of letters, which she penned. These letters are almost a miracle in themselves since Maria had no formal schooling. Maria struggled to teach herself how to write; somehow she knew that she had a special message to convey. She was also burdened with frail health, yet she continued her correspondence and her travels to be present to her sisters and to those whose lives she had come to affect deeply. Before the end of her life on earth, which came on August 20, 1866, Maria saw her congregation spread to sixty towns in Italy; she had also welcomed a group of women from the Germanys to aggregate with her community. One of these sisters, Clementine Zerr, actually had the opportunity to meet with Maria in Italy, and it was this woman who came to the United States carrying the charism and spirituality of Maria De Mattias not only to this country but also to the Great Plains and this very land, purchased from Bishop Hennessy in 1902.\n\nClementine Zerr\n\nClementine Zerr was most essential in building the foundation for the Adorers' ministry which eventually became Newman University. She was born Barbara on December 8,1832 in Sasbachreid, Amt Buel in Baden, Germany. When she was not quite twenty, she joined the Precious Blood Sisters, a small group of women who came together under the spiritual direction of Father Carl Rolfus in 1845. By 1847 this band was incorporated with Maria's congregation. The following year, on December 3, 1853, she made her profession in Ottmarsheim in Alsace Lorraine. For several months in 1864 and 1865, Clementine and a fellow sister visited the Adorers in Italy. Not only did she spend time in Rome and Civitavecchia with many members including future leaders, but she also spent some days in November with Maria De Mattias in Acuto. Political and religious struggles dictated the ministries of the sisters from Ottmarsheim and Gurtweil, including their very existence in this area. The anti-clerical religious confrontation led many of the sisters to accept an invitation to settle near St. Louis in the United States, which was done beginning in 1870. Clementine herself made her first journey on August 26, 1873. Throughout the next 29 years, Clementine made four return trips to Europe, spending time in both Germany and Italy, and sent many sisters throughout the mid-western states. In 1901, she decided to open up a central house and novitiate in Wichita, Kansas as well as take up residence in the city. In early April of 1902, she traveled from Ruma, Illinois to Wichita with Sisters Johanna Siedler, Jerome Gehringer, and Josepha Goedde. The next few months were spent preparing for St. John's School to open in September of 1902. In the Spring of the following year, four more acres of land were acquired and December saw the Golden Jubilee celebration of Sister Clementine. The years of 1904 and 1905 were spent increasing the size and functionality of the school as necessary. In January of 1906, Mother Clementine practiced her custom of spending several hours in the new chapel in front of the Blessed Sacrament and as a result of a raised window, she contracted a severe cold. The cold eventually turned into double pneumonia and Clementine died January 24 shortly after the priest pronounced the words, \"Proficiscere anima christiana.\" This could be translated as, \"Proceed [to heaven], Christian soul.\"\n\nGertrude Bohn\n\nSister Gertrude Bohn was born Rosina on June 8, 1865 in Vimbuch, Baden, Germany. She came to America with Mother Clementine Zerr in 1879. Three years later in 1882, she made her first vows. Twenty years later, she came to St. John's where she taught from 1902 to 1907. From 1915 to 1923, she served as the local superior. She died December 17, 1924 and is buried in Ruma, Illinois.\n\nJohanna Siedler\n\nJohanna Siedler was one of the four pioneer Sisters who helped open St. John's Institute in 1902. She was born in 1869 and, sixteen years later, on August 26, 1885 she entered Ruma from Carlinville, Illinois. Two years later, she made her vows on July 21, 1887. She taught in the Illinois schools until 1896 when Father Heimen (Odin, Kansas) requested teachers from Mother Clementine who possessed \"a superior understanding for virtue.\" Mother Clementine sent Johanna to teach 80 children and her companion to teach 90. Because Johanna was a teacher of upper levels, she needed a certificate. She passed her oral exam and was paid $40 a month--an income sufficient for both Sisters. On April 2, 1902, Mother Clementine took Johanna, as well as Sisters Jerome Gehringer and Josepha Goedde, to open up St. John's Institute in Wichita. She worked there for the next sixteen years until she returned to Illinois to teach for a further sixteen years. After that time, she went to St. Clement's Hospital, located in Illinois in 1937 and spent the next 20 years of her life until her death in 1957.\n\nJerome Gehringer\n\nJerome Gehringer was one of the four pioneer sisters who helped open St. John's Institute and convent in 1902. She was born on November 14, 1870 in St. Mary's, Iowa. She entered at Ruma on June 26, 1895 and a year later, on July 28, received her habit, also at Ruma. She professed her first vows in 1896. During the years 1895 to 1900, she taught seventh and eighth grades at various schools throughout Illinois. Coming in 1902 to Wichita as one of the first sisters was fondly recalled by Sister Jerome as she retold her story on numerous occasions: \"I was ready. I was young and strong.\" St. John's Institute, as the establishment was called, was lovely – it had a beautiful green lawn and a grove of trees as well as Bishop Hennessy's summer residence. She stated the house was in need of cleaning, and this became the first job she tackled. \"I helped with the garden and took care of the chickens and milked the cow and painted the roof.\" When trips to town were needed, it was Sister Jerome who drove the horse and surrey at least as far as the street car line. She witnessed many renovations of the buildings on this property and recorded this growth primarily when she served as the treasurer for the Wichita province. Sister Jerome spent her retirement years in Wichita at the central house. She died on May 7, 1964 and is buried in the convent cemetery.\n\nGermaine Wohler\n\nSister Germaine was born Mary Wohler in Kansas on February 12, 1887. She was orphaned at six years old and came to live with the sisters in 1893. She decided to join the sisters and her reception was nine years later on August 3, 1902 at St. John's Institute. She made her first profession on August 13, 1905 and her perpetual profession July 13, 1911. From 1902 to 1910 and again in 1920 to 1921, she was a teacher throughout various missions in Kansas including St. John's. She died May 13, 1970 and is buried at Ruma, Illinois.\n\nRufina Roechner\n\nSister Rufina Roechner was born in Freudenberg, Baden, Germany on May 23, 1861 to Frank and Maria Roechner. She entered from Freudenberg as a postulant on September 12, 1887. On July 10, 1888, she entered the novitiate. She made her first vows on July 14, 1889 and she was soon on her way to the United States. From 1903 to 1909, she taught at St. John's, having been requested of this service by her superior. She died on July 9, 1936 and is buried at Ruma, Illinois.\n\nArmella Burkhart\n\nSister Armella Burkhart was born Caroline on April 20, 1867 at Breithurst, Frasselt, Germany. She entered from Germany on April 17, 1891. She had her reception on August 2, 1891. Her first profession was on July 16, 1893. She was one of the young sisters who came to the United States. Shortly after the arrival of the four sisters in 1902, Armella was asked to join them at St. John's and worked in the kitchens until 1907. From 1907 until 1915, she did housework for various other Kansas missions before going back to Illinois. She died on May 28, 1957 and is buried at Ruma, Illinois.\n\nStephanie Bohn\n\nSister Stephanie was born on May 6, 1875 and entered the religious community on October 10, 1891, when she was just 16. Her sister, Sister Gertrude Bohn, came home to Germany to look for young women who wished to dedicate their lives to Christ and work in rural parishes in the United States. Stephanie decided to become one of these young women. She made her first profession on July 18, 1894. She had spent three years learning English so she was sent to work in parish schools in Illinois. She came to Ost, Kansas in 1902 and taught until 1910; her teaching career was ruined by defective hearing. In 1918, she became the Sacristan at St. John's Academy. In 1929 and until 1931, she became the first assistant to the Provincial Superior until she was bedridden for almost a year with a serious heart condition and inflammatory rheumatism. Afterwards, she spent six years at Pilsen and St. Mark's, Kansas. In 1938, she was missioned to St. Mary's Hospital in Enid, Oklahoma until she was moved to the Wichita Central House in 1960. On October 14, 1962, she passed away peacefully.\n\nLudovika Donner\n\nSister Ludovika Donner was born Josephine to George and Catherine Donner in Evansville, Illinois on February 7, 1879. In 1899, when she was twenty, she entered the Adorers of the Blood of Christ and a year later on July 8, 1900, she had her reception. She made her first profession on August 18, 1901. From 1904 to 1909, she was in Kansas where she practiced as a self-instructed nurse, anesthetist, and laboratory and x-ray technician. From 1917 until 1923, she was a nurse in the Kansas mission in Carlsbad, New Mexico. For a year, starting in 1923, she worked at the St. John's Institute in Wichita as a nurse. From the mid-1920s until 1948, she moved to Illinois where she served as a nurse until her health weakened, and she was forced to retire. She died on April 9, 1965.\n\nCamilla Heiman\n\nSister Camilla Heiman was born on March 27, 1870 at Lafayette, Indiana to August and Louise Heiman. She entered the convent when she was twenty-five on September 11, 1895. She received the habit on July 28, 1896 and made her first vows a year later on July 31, 1897.

Heiman; it was here she met a young woman she brought to the community in Ruma as a postulant, later known as Sister Amanda Bohatch. Camilla came to Kansas in the late summer or early fall to take care of the little boys at St. John's Academy in Wichita. It was at this location that she died of a ruptured gall bladder on November 23, 1911.\n\nSylvana Houser\n\nSister Sylvana Houser was born on August 26, 1885.

She remained at St. John's from 1903 to 1925 and made her vows on August 16, 1904. Sylvana not only taught at the institute but served as its principal. At this same time, she was a student and received her high school diploma as a member of the first graduating class. Sister was also one of the first sisters to attend St. Louis University when women were finally allowed as students. She received both her bachelors and masters by attending evening, Saturday, and summer classes. She also taught at St. Teresa's Academy for 42 years--a period that was interrupted only when she taught one year at St. Libory's high school from 1937 to 1938. At the academy, she taught Latin, French, and occasionally, English. She also headed the social studies department. In the fall of 1968, she suffered a severe heart condition which caused her to be hospitalized. In January of 1969, she received heart surgery which improved her condition and in June she went to live at St. Clements. Sadly, Sister died while composing a letter to her sister on August 16, 1969.\n\nAnna Clementine Stoer\n\nSister Anna Clementine Stoer was born on July 2, 1857 to Mathias and Anna Stoer in Bubsheim, Wuerttemberg, Germany. Anna entered when she was just fourteen years old on October 2, 1871 in Gurtweil, Germany. She received her habit a year later but the persecutions in Germany prevented her from wearing it. On August 26, 1873, Sister Anna, Mother Clementine, and forty-eight other sisters came to America. She had her reception on August 29, 1873. Two years after that, she made her first profession on August 28, 1875. From 1875 to 1907, she was a teacher throughout various schools in Illinois.

Sister Stanislaus, along with 24 boys, 8 girls, and 9 sisters, caught the Spanish Influenza. Although some recovered easily, death was a certain side effect and some passed away the same day they caught the disease. Seeing that some sisters were not improving as quickly as others, a doctor was sent for on October 29, 1918. He concluded that Sister Stanislaus had contracted pneumonia, and three days later, on November 2, 1918, Father Alfred was called forth to administer her last sacraments.

It was during the year 1918 that the Spanish Influenza spread throughout Wichita. Although the school was sequestered, it too became infected. The origin of the infection at St. John's was in the boys' dorms. Sister Bertranda was part of the first group to be attacked by the disease. She was able to recover well enough to be on duty and help the others who were ill. However, she suffered a relapse of the disease which affected her spine.

She spent two years, 1926 to 1928, in Illinois in an attempt to gain some relief. However, she did not find it and the drier Kansas climate seemed to afford her that comfort much more. During her last years, her eyesight began to fail and her memory was very poor. She truly loved and enjoyed nature and animals. She never spoke ill of anyone and always found good in others. Apoplexy struck her when she was feeding the dog--an exhibit of her trademark of kindness. Her condition was serious and she was stricken with mental confusion that evening.

Elizabeth made the decision to join the sisters and she made her first profession in 1914; she was given the name Silveria.

One of her favorite programs was \"Operation Holiday\"- a program where individuals gather items for needy children to receive during Christmas time. Up until 1976, Sister Theophila stayed very active but this year also brought another stroke. This stroke took away her ability to physically work as well as made her mind and speech unclear. She became a patient in the convent infirmary and it soon became a problem to keep her from wandering throughout the convent or even outside. She eventually grew weaker due to numerous small strokes which wore her down even more; however, in her last few days, she was unusually clear and happy.
