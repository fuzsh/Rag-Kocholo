WALTER WOLFGANG BRUCK‚ÄôS PERSONAL EFFECTS\n\nPOST 100: DR. WALTER WOLFGANG BRUCK, DENTIST TO GERMANY‚ÄôS LAST IMPERIAL FAMILY\n\nThe antisemitic and racist laws enacted by the Nazis short-circuited my father‚Äôs career as a dentist. Pursuant to his formal training at the University of Berlin, followed by an apprenticeship in Danzig (today: Gdansk, Poland), my father, Dr. Otto Bruck (Figure 1), opened his own dental practice in Tiegenhof in the Free City of Danzig (today: Nowy Dw√≥r Gda≈Ñski, Poland) in April 1932; by April 1937, my father was forced to flee Tiegenhof, and by March 1938 he had left Germany altogether, clearly seeing the handwriting on the wall. As an unmarried man with few family ties, this was an option open to him. My father would never again legally practice dentistry.\n\nMy father considered the five years he spent in Tiegenhof to be the halcyon days of his life. Judging from the numerous photos of his days spent there, including those illustrating his active social life, his professional acquaintances, and recreational pursuits, I would be hard-pressed to argue otherwise.\n\nI originally intended in this post to briefly discuss with readers the history of Polish Mennonites because Tiegenhof, the town where my father had his dental practice, was largely Mennonite when my father lived there. The Mennonites arrived in the ≈ªu≈Çawy Wi≈õlane region (i.e. ‚Äúthe Vistula fens,‚Äù plural from ‚Äú≈ºu≈Çawa‚Äù), the alluvial delta area of the Vistula in the northern part of Poland, in the 17th century. They came to escape religious persecution in the Netherlands and Flanders. I have instead decided to devote the subsequent Blog post to discussing the history of Polish Mennonites, and briefly explore how the Mennonites, who are committed to pacifism, inexplicably, became strong adherents of Hitler. I intend in the following post to use photos from my father‚Äôs collection to focus on one Mennonite family, the Epp family, with whom my father was acquainted and friends with. They have a dark history related to their connection to the Nazi regime.\n\nGetting back on track. Curious whether the office building where my father had both his dental practice and residence still existed (Figure 2), in 2013 my wife Ann Finan and I visited Nowy Dw√≥r Gda≈Ñski. We quickly oriented ourselves to the layout of the town, and promptly determined that his office and residential building no longer stands. I would later learn that the structure had been destroyed by Russian bombers when Nazi partisans shot at them from this location.\n\nDuring our initial visit to Nowy Dw√≥r Gda≈Ñski, we were directed to the local museum, the Muzeum ≈ªu≈Çawskie. The museum docent the day we visited spoke English, so I was able to communicate to her that my Jewish father had once been a dentist in the town and had taken many pictures when living there of Tiegenhof and the ≈ªu≈Çawy Wi≈õlane region. I offered to make the photos available, which I in fact did upon my return to the States.\n\nIn 2014, my wife Ann and I were invited to Nowy Dw√≥r Gda≈Ñski for an in-depth tour and a translated talk. Naturally, during my presentation, I used many of my father‚Äôs photos. There was a question-and-answer period following my talk, and one Polish gentleman of Jewish descent commented on how fortunate I am to have so many photographs of my father, family, and friends. I agreed. In the case of this gentleman, he remarked he has only seven family pictures, which I think is often true for descendants of Holocaust survivors. In my instance, my father‚Äôs seven albums of surviving photos, covering from the 1910‚Äôs until 1948 when my father came to America, are the reason I started researching and writing about my family.\n\nGiven the importance pictures have played in the stories I research and write about, and the development of this Blog, I thought I would highlight a few of the more interesting and historically significant pictures in my father‚Äôs collection, as well as discuss other ‚Äústashes‚Äù of photos I‚Äôve uncovered. Obviously, it‚Äôs impossible and would be of scant interest to readers to discuss all the photos.\n\nMy father was a witness to the rise of National Socialism from the window of his dental office in Tiegenhof. On May 1, 1933, my father photographed a regiment of ‚ÄúSA Sturmabteilung,‚Äù literally ‚ÄúStorm Detachment,‚Äù known also as ‚ÄúBrownshirts‚Äù or ‚ÄúStorm Troopers,‚Äù marching down the nearby Schlosserstrasse, carrying Nazi flags, framed by the ‚ÄúKreishaus‚Äù (courthouse) on one side. (Figure 3)\n\nAgain, a year later to the day, on May 1, 1934, my father documented a parade of veterans and Brownshirts following the same path down Schlosserstrasse led by members of the Stahlhelm (‚ÄúSteel Helmet‚Äù), a veterans‚Äô organization that arose after the German defeat of WWI. (Figures 4a-b) In 1934, the Stahlhelme were incorporated into the SA Sturmabteilung, the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party.\n\nThen again, the following year, on April 5, 1935, there was another Nazi parade. On this occasion Field Marshall Hermann G√∂ring visited and participated in the march through Tiegenhof. The day prior, on April 4, 1935, Hermann G√∂ring had visited the Free City of Danzig to influence the upcoming April 7th parliamentary elections in favor of Nazi candidates. The visit to Tiegenhof the next day was merely an extension of this campaign to influence the Free City‚Äôs parliamentary elections. In the photos that my father took on April 5th there can be seen a banner which in German reads ‚ÄúDanzig ist Deutsch wenn es nationalsozialistisch ist,‚Äù translated as ‚ÄúDanzig is German when it is National Socialist.‚Äù (Figures 5a-b) It appears that along with everyday citizens of Tiegenhof and surrounding communities, members of the Hitler Youth, known in German as Hitlerjugend, also lined the street in large number.\n\nStudents of history know about Hermann G√∂ring but for those who are unfamiliar with him, let me say a few words. He would evolve to become the second-highest ranking Nazi after the F√ºhrer. Unlike many of Hitler‚Äôs sycophants and lieutenants, G√∂ring was a veteran of WWI, having been an ace fighter pilot, a recipient of the prestigious Blue Max award, and a commander of the Jagdgeschwader a fighter group that had previously been led by the renowned Red Baron, Manfred von Richthofen. G√∂ring was drawn to Hitler for his oratorical skills and became an early member of the Nazi Party. He participated with Hitler in the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, during which he was wounded in the groin. During his recovery he was regularly given morphine to which he became addicted for the remainder of his life.\n\nG√∂ring oversaw the creation of the Gestapo, an organization he later let Heinrich Himmler run. He was best known as the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, although after the Nazi victory over France, he was made Reichsmarschall, head of all the German armed forces. He amassed great wealth for himself by stealing paintings, sculptures, jewelry, cash, and valuable artifacts not only from Jews and people whom Nazis had murdered but also by looting museums of defeated nations.\n\nTowards the end of the war, following an awkward attempt to have Hitler appoint him head of the Third Reich and thereby drawing Hitler‚Äôs ire, he turned himself in to the Americans rather than risk being captured by the Russians. He eventually was indicted and stood trial at Nuremberg. The once obese G√∂ring, who‚Äôd once weighed more than three hundred pounds, was a shadow of his former self at his trial. Expectedly, he was convicted on all counts, and sentenced to death by hanging. His request to be executed by firing squad was denied, but he was able to avoid the hangman‚Äôs noose by committing suicide using a potassium cyanide pill that had inexplicably been smuggled to him by an American soldier.\n\nMy uncle, Dr. Fedor Bruck, has been the subject of multiple previous posts (i.e., Post 17, Post 31, Post 41). My uncle, like my father was a dentist. He was educated at the University of Breslau (today: Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) and had his dental practice in Liegnitz, Germany (today: Legnica, Poland) until around 1933 when he was forced to give it up due to the ‚ÄúLaw for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service‚Äù passed by the Nazi regime on the 7th April 1933, two months after Adolf Hitler had attained power. My uncle‚Äôs life is of interest because he miraculously survived the entire war hidden in Berlin by friends and non-Jewish family members. His story has also been of interest because he counted among his friends a woman named K√§the Heusermann-Reiss, who had been his dental assistant in Liegnitz.\n\nFollowing the loss of his business my uncle relocated to Berlin hoping the anonymity of the larger city would afford him the possibility to continue working under the auspices of another dentist, which it did for a time. K√§the Heusermann also moved to Berlin and opportunistically landed herself a job as a dental assistant to Hitler‚Äôs American-trained dentist, Dr. Hugo Blaschke. In this capacity, she was always present when Dr. Blaschke treated Hitler. Following the end of the war, she was interrogated by the Russians and asked to identify dental remains which had been recovered in a burn pit outside the Reichstag. The bridgework performed by Dr. Blaschke on Hitler was outmoded so K√§the was easily able to recognize Blaschke‚Äôs work and Hitler‚Äôs teeth, a fact Stalin kept hidden from the world. Following Russia‚Äôs capture of Berlin at the end of the war, my uncle who‚Äôd temporarily been hiding in K√§the‚Äôs apartment learned from her that Hitler had committed suicide. This dangerous information resulted in K√§the being imprisoned in the USSR for many years, and my uncle barely escaping the same fate. Surviving among my father‚Äôs photographs is a noteworthy picture taken in Liegnitz of my uncle and K√§the Heusermann. Though uncaptioned, I have been able to compare it to known pictures of K√§the to confirm it is her. (Figure 6)\n\nAs I have told readers in multiple earlier posts my father was an active sportsman, and an excellent amateur tennis player. Among my father‚Äôs belongings I retain multiple of the prizes he was awarded for his achievements, including many newspaper clippings documenting his results. In August 1936, my father attended an International Tennis Tournament in Zoppot, Germany (today: Sopot, Poland), located a mere 32 miles from Tiegenhof. During his attendance there, he photographed the great German tennis player, Heinrich Ernst Otto ‚ÄúHenner‚Äù Henkel (Figure 7), whose biggest success was his singles title at the 1937 French Championships. Interestingly, Henkel learned to play tennis at the ‚ÄúRot-Weiss‚Äù Tennis Club in Berlin. My father was a member of the ‚ÄúSchwarz-Weiss‚Äù Tennis Club in Berlin, so perhaps my father and Henner played one another and were acquainted. Henner Henkel was killed in action during WWII on the Eastern Front at Voronezh during the Battle of Stalingrad while serving in the Wehrmacht, the German Army.\n\nAs I mentioned above, my father left Germany for good in March 1938. He was headed to stay with his sister Susanne and brother-in-law, then living in Fiesole, a small Tuscan town outside Florence, Italy. During his sojourn in Italy, before eventually joining the French Foreign Legion later in 1938, my father visited some of the tourist attractions in Italy, including the Colosseum in Rome. One of the images that my father took there has always stood out to me because of the paucity of people around what is today a very crowded and visited venue. (Figure 8)\n\nMy father‚Äôs collection of photos number in the hundreds but I‚Äôve chosen to highlight only certain ones because they illustrate a few personages or places that may be known to readers. My father‚Äôs collection is merely one among several caches of images I was able to track down through family and acquaintances. I want to call attention to a few pictures of family members that grabbed my attention from these other hoards.\n\nIn Post 33, I explained to readers how I tracked down the grandchildren of my grandfather‚Äôs brother, Wilhelm ‚ÄúWilly‚Äù Bruck (1872-1952). Based on family correspondence, I knew my great-uncle Willy wound up in Barcelona after escaping Germany in the 1930‚Äôs and theorized his children and grandchildren may have continued to live there. Official vital documents I procured during a visit there convinced me otherwise, that at least his son returned to Germany after WWII. I was eventually able to track down both of my great-uncle‚Äôs grandchildren, that‚Äôs to say my second cousins Margarita and Antonio Bruck, to outside of Munich, Germany. (Figure 9) I have met both, and they‚Äôve shared their family pictures, which again number in the hundreds.\n\nThe cache included many images of family members, but there are two pictures I was particularly thrilled to obtain copies of. My uncle Dr. Fedor Bruck (1895-1982), previously discussed, fought in WWI on the Eastern Front. (Figure 10) Among the family memorabilia I retain is a postcard he sent to his aunt Franziska Bruck on the 3rd of September 1916 coincidentally from the Ukraine announcing his promotion to Sergeant. (Figures 11a-b) The ongoing conflict between the Ukraine and Russia makes me realize how long the Ukraine has been a staging area for wars.\n\nRegular readers may recall that my father was born in Ratibor, Germany (today: Racib√≥rz, Poland), in Upper Silesia. The family hotel there, owned through three generations between roughly 1850 and the early 1920‚Äôs, was known as the Bruck‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrinz von Preu√üen‚Äù Hotel. Among my second cousins‚Äô photos is a rare image of the entrance to this hotel, which no longer stands. (Figure 12)\n\nI introduced readers to two of my grandfather‚Äôs renowned sisters, my great-aunts Franziska and Elsbeth Bruck, way back in Post 15. Their surviving personal papers are archived at the Stadtmuseum in Spandau, the westernmost of the twelve boroughs of Berlin; these files have been another source of family photographs. Franziska Bruck was an eminent florist, and it is reputed that one of her clients was the last German Kaiser, Wilhelm II (1859-1941). One undated photograph taken in my great-aunt‚Äôs flower shop shows Duchess Cecilie Auguste Marie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1886-1954), the last Crown Princess of Germany and Prussia, who was married to Kaiser Wilhelm II‚Äôs son, Wilhelm, the German Crown Prince. (Figure 13)\n\nMy second cousins Margarita and Antonio Bruck introduced me to one of my third cousins, Andreas ‚ÄúAndi‚Äù Pauly, also living part-time in Munich, Germany. (Figure 14) The Pauly branch of my extended family, which originally hailed from Posen, Germany (today: Poznan, Poland) has been the subject of multiple blog posts, including Post 45 on Pauly family Holocaust victims and reflections in Post 56 by the paterfamilias, Dr. Josef Pauly (1843-1916), Andi Pauly‚Äôs great-grandfather. Josef Pauly and his wife Rosalie Pauly n√©e Mockrauer (1844-1927) had eight daughters and one son born between 1870 and 1885; thanks to photos provided by Andi Pauly, not only was I able to obtain images of all nine children but also some of Pauly cousins I knew of by name.\n\nAgain, it is not my intention to boggle readers‚Äô minds by showing all these photos but I want to focus on one particular picture I originally obtained from Andi Pauly that was the subject of Post 65. The photo was taken in Doorn, Netherlands on the 28th of May 1926, and shows a then-unknown Bruck family member standing amidst a group that includes the last German Kaiser, Wilhelm II, his second wife, Princess Hermine Reuss of Greiz (1887-1947), and her youngest daughter by her first marriage, Princess Henriette of Sch√∂naich-Carolath (1918-1972), and the Royal Family‚Äôs entourage. (Figure 15) At the time I wrote Post 65, I was unable to determine who the Bruck family member was, nor whom the initials ‚ÄúW.B.‚Äù stood for.\n\nFast forward. In early 2021, I was astonished to receive an email from a Dr. Tilo Wahl, a doctor from K√∂penick in Berlin, who stumbled upon my Blog and contacted me. He shared copies of the extensive collection of personal papers and photographs he had copied from the grandson of one of my esteemed ancestors, Dr. Walter Bruck (1872-1937), from Breslau, Germany (today: Wroc≈Çaw, Poland) Again, this relative and my findings related to Dr. Walter Bruck have been chronicled in multiple earlier posts. The very same image discussed in the previous paragraph I had obtained from Andi Pauly was included among Dr. Bruck‚Äôs images. It was then I realized the unidentified Bruck family member standing with Kaiser Wilhelm II, his family, and his entourage was none other than Dr. Bruck‚Äôs second wife, Johanna Elisabeth Margarethe Gr√§bsch (1884-1963). (Figure 16) I discussed these findings in Post 100.\n\nDr. Walter Bruck‚Äôs collection of papers and photos yielded images of multiple family members about whom I was aware, including one of Dr. Walter Bruck‚Äôs three siblings. However, one that stands out amongst all these photos was the one of Dr. Walter Bruck‚Äôs grandfather Dr. Jonas Julius Bruck (1813-1883). (Figure 17) Dr. Jonas Bruck is buried along with his son, Dr. Julius Bruck, in the restored tombs at the Old Jewish Cemetery in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland. (Figure 18) Dr. Jonas Bruck was a brother of my great-great-grandfather Samuel Bruck (1808-1863), the original owner of the Bruck‚Äôs ‚ÄúPrinz von Preu√üen‚Äù Hotel in Ratibor, Germany (today: Racib√≥rz, Poland) I previously discussed.\n\nIn various places, I found fleeting references that Dr. Walter Bruck and Johanna Elisabeth Margarethe Gr√§bsch had both previously been married. I eventually found historic documents, my gold standard, confirming this. Using educating guesses based on incomplete captions and estimating the timeframe a few pictures in Dr. Walter Bruck‚Äôs collection were taken, that‚Äôs to say during WWI and before, I was even able to find pictures of both of their previous spouses among his photos.\n\nDr. Walter Bruck‚Äôs album also contain multiple pictures of his daughter, Renate Bruck (1926-2013). She was married three times, with images of two of her husbands included. Thanks to Post 99 Renate‚Äôs twin daughters, whom I knew about but had no expectation of ever finding since they‚Äôd left England years ago, instead found me. From this, I learned that Walter Bruck‚Äôs grandchildren and great-grandchildren live in Sydney, Australia.\n\nI suspect the story I‚Äôm about to relate may resonate with some readers, the topic of missing or incomplete captions on pictures of one‚Äôs ancestors. Let me provide some context. During the time that my uncle Dr. Fedor Bruck was a dentist in Liegnitz, Germany he carried on an illicit affair with a married non-Jewish woman, Irmgard Lutze (Figure 19), with whom he had two children, my first cousins Wolfgang (Figure 20) and Wera Lutze. During the Nazi era time when it was prohibited and dangerous for an Aryan to have an affair with a Jew, the cuckolded husband nonetheless raised the children as his own. Therefore, they had the Lutze rather than the Bruck surname.\n\nI knew both first cousins well, though both are now deceased. In any case, included among my cousin‚Äôs photographs was one that left me perplexed. It showed three generations, the eldest of whom was identified as ‚ÄúTante Grete Brauer (mother‚Äôs sister).‚Äù (Figures 21a-b) The ‚ÄúBrauer‚Äù surname reverberated only because when perusing my great-aunt Elsbeth Bruck‚Äôs papers at the Stadtmuseum I discovered multiple letters written by Brauers. At the time I had no idea this represented another branch of my extended family.\n\nAs I discussed in Post 34, I would eventually work out that ‚ÄúTante Grete Brauer‚Äù was my grandmother Else Bruck n√©e Berliner‚Äôs sister, Margarethe Brauer n√©e Berliner (1872-1942) who was murdered in the Holocaust. Prior to finding this isolated picture of my great-aunt, I was completely unaware of her existence. I‚Äôve repeatedly told readers that my father had scant interest in family and rarely spoke of them to me growing up, so I was not surprised by this discovery.\n\nI will give readers one last example of caches of family photos I‚Äôve been able to recover by mentioning my third cousin once-removed, Larry Leyser (Figure 22), who very sadly passed away in 2021 due to complications from Covid. Over the years, Larry and I often shared family documents and photos. Several years ago, he borrowed and scanned a large collection of photos from one of his cousins named Michael Maleckar which he shared with me. As with any such trove, I found a few gems, including one of my own parents at a party they attended in Manhattan the early 1950‚Äôs. My father literally ‚Äúrobbed the cradle‚Äù when he married my mother as she was 22 years younger than him. This age difference is particularly pronounced in the one picture I show here. (Figure 23)\n\nI will merely say, in closing, that I am aware of other caches of family photos that unfortunately I have been unable to lay my hands on. I completely understand that some of my cousins are busy leading their lives and don‚Äôt share my passion for family history, so they are excused. One other thought. The longer I work on my family‚Äôs history, the more I realize how much I regret not talking with my relatives when they were alive about some of our ancestors as my stories would be broader and would then be grounded in truths rather veiled in so much conjecture.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nSussman, Jeffrey.

It is worth noting the data from some BUT not all these sources may also pop up when using ancestry.com. In the interest of thoroughness, readers may also want to check the ones cited in this post.

WALTER BRUCK, HIS SECOND WIFE JOHANNA GR√ÑBSCH & HER FAMILY\n\nPOST 109 (PART 1): JOHANNA & RENATE BRUCK‚ÄôS WARTIME TAGEBUCH (‚ÄúDIARY‚Äù)‚ÄîYEARS 1940-1941\n\nIn January of this year, I received an email through my Blog‚Äôs Webmail from a gentleman named Stephen Falk from Point Roberts, Washington. Mr. Falk contacted me after reading Blog Post 99 about my accomplished relative from Breslau, Germany [today: Wroc≈Çaw, Poland], Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck, subject of multiple earlier posts, wondering whether I was aware of Walter‚Äôs first wife, Margarethe ‚ÄúGrete‚Äù Skutsch (1872-1942). I confirmed that I knew about her. Stephen, it so happens, has the same relationship to Margarethe Skutsch, second cousin twice removed, as I do to Walter. In passing, Stephen mentioned that he was unaware that Walter had remarried and had fathered two children with his second wife.\n\nRegular readers may recall that in Post 100 I discussed how I discovered Dr. Bruck had previously been married. Quoting what I wrote earlier:\n\n‚ÄúIn researching when and where Walter‚Äôs older sister, Margarethe Prausnitz n√©e Bruck, was born and died, I found an ancestral tree showing Walter had been married before he married Johanna Bruck n√©e Gr√§bsch, the mother of his two children. This came as quite a surprise to me. According to this source, the name of Walter‚Äôs first wife was purportedly Margarethe STUTSCH.\n\nI have repeatedly told readers that unless I can locate primary source documents, I am hesitant to believe what I find in other people‚Äôs trees. Case in point. While I was eventually able to confirm Walter had indeed previously been married, I learned his first wife‚Äôs maiden name was SKUTSCH not Stutsch, complicating my search. Sadly, I found that Margarethe Skutsch, born the same month and year as Walter, March 1872, was murdered in Theresienstadt in 1942.\n\nI unearthed two primary source documents confirming Margarethe‚Äôs connection to Walter Bruck. The first was her Theresienstadt death certificate, very rarely completed post-mortem for Jews who died there, giving her married name. The second was the 1907 death certificate for Margarethe‚Äôs mother, Berta Skutsch n√©e Grosser, at which Walter was a witness. A picture from around 1917 shows Margarethe and Walter seated at an outside picnic table with the Grand Duke of Oldenburg and his wife, indicating they were still married at the time. Walter‚Äôs biography which abruptly ends around 1894-95 gives no indication he was married before he left for America to attend the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery, so the duration of his first marriage is unknown.‚Äù\n\nIn Part I of Post 109, I also made mention of a seemingly ongoing connection between Walter Bruck‚Äôs first and second wives following Walter‚Äôs death in 1937. Again quoting:\n\n‚ÄúPersonally intriguing is the mention made on March 30, 1940, that Renate [Dr. Bruck‚Äôs surviving child by his second wife] went to visit ‚ÄòTante Margarethe‚Äô to wish her a happy birthday. The quotation marks indicate that while she was not a relative, she was still referred to as an aunt. There is no doubt this is Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck‚Äôs first wife who was Jewish, Margarethe Bruck n√©e Skutsch. She was born on March 30, 1872, in Breslau [Wroc≈Çaw, Poland], and murdered in the Theresienstadt Ghetto on the 22nd of September 1942. It is surprising that Johanna and Renate were in touch with Walter‚Äôs first wife, although, as this was certainly the case, it‚Äôs astonishing that Johanna made no mention in the diary when Margarethe was deported. Perhaps Johanna had already distanced herself from this Jewish ‚Äòaunt‚Äô by then?‚Äù\n\nSoon after establishing contact with Stephen Falk, he informed me that he has a copy of Walter Bruck and Margarethe Skutsch‚Äôs marriage certificate (Figures 1a-d), which he graciously shared. From the certificate, which my good German friend Peter Hanke transcribed and translated for me, I learned several interesting things. (Figures 2a-b)\n\nAs I correctly surmised from Walter‚Äôs biography which I discussed in Post 100, he was not yet married to his first wife when he departed for America in around 1894-95 to attend the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. According to his marriage document Walter and Margarethe married on the 20th of October 1896 in Breslau, Germany. The certificate confirmed that by the time of their marriage in 1896, Walter had already converted to the Protestant religion. For a long time, I thought his conversion might have coincided with the death of Walter‚Äôs mother in around 1917, but clearly Walter anticipated the benefits professionally of being Protestant. As he and other Jews who converted would later learn, according to Nazi ideology he would always be considered ‚Äúracially‚Äù Jewish. Walter died in 1937, perhaps by his own hand, so did not live long enough to have ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù added to his name, but as readers can see, Margarethe had the name ‚ÄúSara‚Äù added to hers identifying her as Jewish (Figure 1c); sadly, as previously mentioned, she was deported to and murdered in Theresienstadt in 1942.\n\nIt is not uncommon for German marriage certificates to include the date of a divorce decree should a marriage be dissolved. As readers will note, a handwritten entry was added to Walter and Margarethe‚Äôs 1896 marriage document on the 8th of January 1924 affirming they had been divorced since the 21st of December 1923. (Figure 1a) The timing of the divorce is intriguing. In Post 102, I included a copy of Dr. Walter Bruck and Johanna Graebsch‚Äôs wedding announcement dated the 13th of December 1923 (Figure 3), thus, eight days before Walter‚Äôs first marriage officially ended.\n\nJudging from the entry to Johanna and Renate Bruck‚Äôs Tagebuch cited above, it appears that Walter‚Äôs second wife had a cordial relationship with his first wife at least until it became too dangerous for Johanna and Renate to associate with the Jewish-born Margarethe Bruck n√©e Skutsch during the Nazi era. While the reasons for the dissolution of Walter and Margarethe‚Äôs marriage will likely never be known, perhaps their inability to have children may have been the cause? To date, I have found no evidence they ever had any together.\n\nThe marriage certificate contains additional ancestral information about Walter and Margarethe‚Äôs parents, information previously known to me, though for readers in a similar situation, such documents can often yield new ancestral data.\n\nStephen gave me a direct link to Walter and Margarethe‚Äôs 1896 wedding document. The source is the ‚ÄúArchiwum Pa≈Ñstwowe we Wroc≈Çawiu,‚Äù the State Archives in Wroc≈Çaw, which has free, online genealogy collections as well as onsite family history collections. Prior to being contacted by Stephen, I had never accessed the Breslau online records, so will spend a little time broadly explaining to interested followers how to navigate the database. Readers should be forewarned that based on my limited exploration of the website I find it extremely user-unfriendly. Beyond the obvious challenge of negotiating a Polish website, even with the translator automatically turned on, there appear to be specific sequential steps to be followed to access the desired files.\n\nRelatedly, my good friend Peter Hanke provided a link to a website entitled ‚ÄúAhnenforschung in Schlesien‚ÄîLiegnitz, Breslau, Lauban, Hirschberg,‚Äù Genealogy in Silesia‚ÄîLiegnitz, Wroclaw, Lauban, Hirschberg that includes a portal page for specifically accessing the documents of the State Archives in Wroclaw (the Standesamt or the German civil registration offices for Breslau I, II, III, IV which were responsible for recording births, marriages, and deaths). (Figure 4) For ease, it helps to begin with the link to ‚ÄúGenealogy in Silesia‚Äù just mentioned.\n\nBefore briefly explaining how to access the Wroclaw records, some background about the city of Breslau is helpful. By the end of the Middle Ages in around 1500, the city had already more than 25,000 inhabitants, something few of the more than 4,000 places in Silesia had reached by the end of WWII. By 1840, 100,000 people were already living in Breslau. From then on, a tremendous growth spurt ensued because of the construction of the railway and the beginning of industrialization. In 1900 the population had quadrupled to 400,000 as outlying areas were incorporated into the city. By 1939 there were 630,000 inhabitants in Breslau. Most readers with an ancestral link to Prussia likely have relatives with a connection to Breslau simply because it was the largest city in Silesia.\n\nI was able to track down a map of Breslau as it looked in 1863 hoping I could locate the streets where Walter and Margarethe lived before they got married 33 years later. The marriage certificate tells us Walter resided at Schweidnitzerstra√üe 27 (Figure 5), and Margarethe at Zwingerplatz 2. Both locales are found on the 1863 map (Figure 6) although Hindenburgplatz, where Walter later owned a sumptuous home, was then an outlying area known only as ‚Äúnach Kleinburg.‚Äù Peter Hanke also gave me a link to a website containing many high-resolution historic maps of Breslau, including Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse which bisected Hindenburgplatz (Figure 7); for readers interested in understanding the city‚Äôs layout through time, I include the link: http://igrek.amzp.pl/result.php?cmd=pt&locsys=1&uni=-706307&box=0.0001&hideempty=on\n\nMoving on, let me describe how to access Breslau‚Äôs birth, marriage, and death records from the ‚ÄúAhnenforschung in Schlesien‚ÄîLiegnitz, Breslau, Lauban, Hirschberg‚Äù website. As previously mentioned, Breslau had four Standes√§mter, or civil registration offices, referred to as ‚ÄúStandesamt BRESLAU I-IV‚Äù on the site‚Äôs portal page. The responsible registry office was based on one‚Äôs street address. Determining the responsible Breslau Standesamt for one‚Äôs ancestors without an address and address book is nigh near impossible.\n\nThat said, I like a challenge, and attempted to determine the civil registry office for Dr. Walter Bruck for the last year he was alive, specifically, 1937. Living on a street that was in the late 19th century and early 20th century known as Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse, during the Nazi era it was called ‚ÄúStra√üe der S.A.‚Äù ‚ÄúS.A.‚Äù stands for Sturmabteilung (SA) which was the paramilitary combat organization of the Nazi Party. The precise address of Dr. Bruck‚Äôs residence in 1937 was Hindenburgplatz 17 (Figure 8), bisected initially by Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse, and later by the renamed Stra√üe der S.A. (Figure 9)\n\nThe next step in determining the responsible civil registry office requires having an address book for the year in question, in this example, 1937. The following website (Category:Wroclaw Address Book ‚Äì GenWiki (genealogy.net) has 104 Breslau Address Books intermittently spanning parts of two centuries and includes the year 1937. The fourth part of this Address Book shows the all-important street directory, which lists the relevant civil registry office under one of the columns. In the case of Hindenburgplatz 17 the responsible Standesamt was ‚Äú4,‚Äù the responsible Evangelical parish was ‚Äú10,‚Äù and the responsible Catholic parish under the column titled ‚Äúparochia,‚Äù was ‚ÄúIII.‚Äù (Figures 10a-b)\n\nReaders will rightly wonder which Evangelical and Catholic churches the parish numbers relate to. This information is also found in the fourth part of the address books, in subsection five entitled ‚ÄúV. Abschnitt. Kirchen und Friedh√∂fe,‚Äù Section V. Churches and Cemeteries. (Figure 11) So, in the above example, the Evangelical parish 10 refers to St. John‚Äôs Church, while the Catholic parish III would have been St. Carolus-Kapelle. Knowing that Dr. Bruck was a Protestant, I searched for the surviving church registers for the St. John‚Äôs Church, none of which are known to have survived WWII.\n\nLater, I will briefly discuss one Breslau parish record of personal interest I surprisingly found amongst surviving records for a different Evangelical parish, the church of St. Elisabeth‚Äôs.\n\nFor readers in fact interested in tracking down the responsible civil registry office as well as the parish for ancestors listed in the various Breslau address books, the following link provides a ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù guide on doing so: http://www.christoph-www.de/breslau%201.html; this how-to guide is entitled ‚ÄúBreslau f√ºr Familienforscher,‚Äù ‚ÄúWroc≈Çaw for Genealogists.‚Äù (Figure 12) Bear in mind that not all Breslau directories include a table in the fourth part of the book cross-referencing street addresses with civil registry offices and responsible parishes. In this case, readers should examine directories a year or more before or after the target year.\n\nContinuing. I will use ‚ÄúStandesamt BRESLAU IV‚Äù to illustrate how to access the Breslau birth, marriage, and death records. Once you‚Äôve selected a specific civil registry office, you‚Äôll be taken to another page where readers will find the following listings in Polish on the left side (Figure 13): Zesp√≥≈Ç1428-0 ‚Äì UrzƒÖd Stanu Cywilnego (Zesp√≥≈Ç1428-0 ‚Äì Registry Office); Seria1 ‚Äì Ksiƒôgi urodze≈Ñ (Birth records) (Figure 14); Seria2 ‚Äì Ksiƒôgi ma≈Ç≈ºe≈Ñstw (Marriage registers); and Seria3 ‚Äì Ksiƒôgi zgon√≥w (Death books). You can either select birth, marriage, or death records, or ‚ÄúShow All the Listings‚Äù in the center part of the screen (i.e., at the time of this writing, there were ‚Äú233 Results‚Äù available). Next, scroll down and select the specific year and records you‚Äôre interested in which will take you to another page; scroll down on this page, and select the hyperlinked URL. Images of the vital documents will show up which you can then scroll through systematically; if you know the specific month and/or day you‚Äôre looking for you can short-circuit the process. If you attempt to access the vital records from a place other than ‚ÄúShow All the Listings,‚Äù which it is possible to do, the hyperlinked URL won‚Äôt appear.\n\nI want to draw readers attention to another source of information that will take you to maps and plans of the city of Breslau. By selecting ‚ÄúStandesamt Breslau I,‚Äù you‚Äôll come to a page entitled ‚ÄúTeam 1425-0‚ÄîCivil Registry Office in Wroc≈Çaw I‚Äù (Figure 15) Click where it says ‚Äú430 Results,‚Äù and on the center of the next page select the box ‚ÄúCivil Registry Office in Wroc≈Çaw.‚Äù (Figure 16) The next page yields ‚Äú5504 Results‚Äù (Figure 17); on the left side you can select ‚ÄúFiles of the city of Wroc≈Çaw‚Äù which takes you to a different page with ‚Äú489 Results‚Äù with the icons of Breslau maps through time. (Figure 18)\n\nSuffice it to say with all the digital information available through the ‚ÄúArchiwum Pa≈Ñstwowe we Wroc≈Çawiu,‚Äù one could spend many days studying the offerings; I‚Äôve barely touched on what can be accessed but for interested genealogists the more narrowly you can focus your research with vital dates and addresses of one‚Äôs ancestors, obviously the easier things will go.\n\nBefore personally acquainting myself with the digital records available at the Wroc≈Çaw Archives, I asked Stephen to check on specific vital documents where I knew the approximate date or year of the event. Initially, I had hoped to obtain the birth certificates for Walter and Johanna Bruck‚Äôs two daughters, Hermine born in 1924, who lived only a few months, and Renate born in 1926. Unfortunately, in Poland as in Germany there is a ‚Äúprotection period‚Äù before vital documents can be released to the general public. While the births of both Hermine and Renate took place when Breslau was part of Germany, the protection period is governed by Poland; Poland won‚Äôt release Hermine and Renate‚Äôs birth certificates, respectively, until 2024 and 2026, so 100 years after their births. In Germany, the protection period for birth certificates is 110 years. In the case of death records, Germany releases them after 30 years but in Poland one must wait 80 years.\n\nHaving learned that the protection period for marriage records in both Germany and Poland is 80 years, I had hoped I could uncover Walter Bruck and Johanna Gr√§bsch‚Äôs 1923 or 1924 marriage certificate, to no avail. Perplexingly, the marriage records for this period are not yet digitized. I‚Äôll return to my search for information on Walter and Johanna‚Äôs marriage momentarily in discussing another Polish database readers can search for information on Prussian ancestors.\n\nTo remind readers, Walter and Johanna‚Äôs daughter Renate was married three times. Her first husband, whom I‚Äôve previously wrote about in Post 101 was Matthias Eugen Walter Mehne; according to his daughter Bettina Mehne he was born in 1908 in Breslau. While many birth records from this year exist in the Wroc≈Çaw Archives, Stephen could not find M.E.W. Mehne‚Äôs birth certificate so one can only assume it was among those destroyed during WWII.\n\nMatthias Mehne‚Äôs address, Tauenzienplatz 1, means the responsible Standesamt was 4. The responsible Evangelical parish for this address was ‚Äú2,‚Äù while the responsible Catholic parish was ‚ÄúVI.‚Äù In the case of the address associated with Matthias Mehne, the Evangelical parish would have been St. Mary Magdalene, while the corresponding Catholic parish would have been St. Dorothea (=Minoritenkirche). It‚Äôs unknown to me whether Matthias was an Evangelical or a Catholic, and while church records survive for both parishes, I was unable to find a baptismal or birth record for him amongst these records.\n\nIn the aforementioned how-to guide ‚ÄúWroc≈Çaw for Genealogists,‚Äù the surviving Evangelical and Catholic parish records are identified, and a hyperlink provided to some of them. Uncertain whether any would have relevant records for my ancestors, I started by examining the Evangelical records for the first Evangelical church, St. Elisabeth parish church (Elisabeth-Kirche zu Breslau | Breslau/Wroclaw, Staatsarchiv | Polen | Matricula Online (matricula-online.eu). Miraculously, I stumbled upon the marriage register listing for Johanna Gr√§bsch to her first husband, Dr. Alfred Renner, confirming they were married on the 6th of May 1905. (Figure 19) While I had previously located their marriage certificate in ancestry.com, it fails to indicate they were married in St. Elisabeth‚Äôs Evangelical Church. Armed with this new information, I naively hoped that Johanna Gr√§bsch‚Äôs marriage to Walter Bruck in late 1923 or early 1924 might also have taken place in the same Evangelical Church, so I carefully scrolled through the rest of marriage register for St. Elisabeth‚Äôs, to no avail.\n\nGiven Dr. Bruck‚Äôs prominence in the city of Breslau during his lifetime, Stephen Falk made an excellent recommendation. He suggested I try and track down a contemporary newspaper that might have included an announcement of Dr. Bruck‚Äôs second marriage. I was quickly able to determine the largest Breslau newspaper of the time was the ‚ÄúBreslauer Zeitung‚Äù (i.e., ‚Äúzeitung‚Äù=newspaper) but was uncertain whether historic copies of the tabloid can be found online. Consequently, I contacted my friend from Wroc≈Çaw, Ms. Renata Wilkoszewska-Krakowska, Branch Manager, Museum of Cemetery Art (Old Jewish Cemetery), Branch of the City Museum of Wroc≈Çaw. Renata graciously provided a link to another Polish database (https://www.dbc.wroc.pl/dlibra?language=en), the Lower Silesian Digital Library. (Figure 20)\n\nThe site includes some back issues of the Breslauer Zeitung, although none for the year Dr. Bruck remarried in either 1923 or 1924. As readers can see, in the very center of the Lower Silesian Digital Library portal page there is a search bar. Beyond looking for old Breslau newspapers, out of curiosity I also searched my family surname, and happened upon references related to three other eminent Bruck ancestors from Breslau, Dr. Julius Bruck (Dr. Walter Bruck‚Äôs father), Dr. Eberhard Bruck, and Dr. Felix Bruck. Readers with ancestral connections to Breslau can do similar searches. Occasionally, genealogists may even be rewarded by finding historic pictures of one‚Äôs predecessors.\n\nI can‚Äôt conclude this Blog post without conceding the obstacles and challenges genealogists face in searching and finding information for ancestors who may hail from Silesia. The language barrier turns out to be the easiest to overcome. Readers should be able to figure out how to access the civil records from the Wroc≈Çaw Archives, although the process of scrolling through all of them can be tedious, particularly when one does not have dates for any vital events in an ancestor‚Äôs life. Figuring out which Protestant or Catholic parish relatives may have lived in, and then hoping the church records for that parish still exist can also be exasperating. Knowing that the protection period for vital events has expired, and then being unable to find digitized copies of those records can be vexing. The list of challenges goes on, but my advice to genealogists is to persist. Experimenting by following some of the steps I‚Äôve outlined should be helpful. Bear in mind that doing ancestral searches can at times involve a steep learning curve.\n\nNote: In the second part of Post 109, I discuss the broader historic context in which Johanna and Renate Bruck, wife and daughter of my esteemed ancestor, Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck (1872-1937), recorded the daily happenings in their lives between January 1942 and December 1944. Regrettably, their ‚ÄúTagebuch‚Äù does not encompass the final few months of the war in Berlin through the surrender of the city on May 2, 1945. Thus, the circumstances of any hardships Johanna and Renate may have suffered in this period at the hands of the Russians and the Allies are unknown to us. Like in years 1940 and 1941, Johanna and Renate‚Äôs lives are replete with social engagements (getting together with friends; attending movies, plays, and operas; dining out; shopping; clothes fittings; etc.), distractions (tap, tennis, violin lessons), Renate‚Äôs amorous liaisons, and, most remarkably, multiple trips. With a few notable exceptions, the war passes almost unnoticed. I do not dwell on Johanna and Renate‚Äôs personal lives except where it adds nuance and texture to their accounts or provides some temporal context. From a story-telling perspective, I explore developments in the war and other happenings that while not explicitly discussed in the diary must have weighed on Johanna and Renate‚Äôs minds.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nPOST 83: CASE STUDY USING THE UNITED KINGDOM‚ÄôS ‚ÄúGENERAL REGISTER OFFICE‚Äù DATABASE TO FIND ANCESTORS\n\nPOST 108: RENATE BRUCK & MATTHIAS MEHNE‚ÄôS ‚ÄúLONG-DISTANCE MARRIAGE‚Äù\n\nPOST 109 (PART 1): JOHANNA & RENATE BRUCK‚ÄôS WARTIME TAGEBUCH (‚ÄúDIARY‚Äù)‚ÄîYEARS 1940-1941\n\nAs discussed in Post 109(1), in November and December 1941 Johanna Bruck transacted the exchange of her apartment in Breslau [today: Wroc≈Çaw, Poland] at Oranienstrasse 4, with one in Berlin occupied by a couple named the G√ºnthers, located at Xantener Stra√üe 24, in the Berlin district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. Johanna physically relocated to Berlin in February 1942, followed several weeks later by Renate. Johanna used the intervening period to have the apartment completely refurbished and upgraded.\n\nBy September 1941 Johanna understood that Renate‚Äôs application for her to be treated ‚Äúas an equal to German-blooded people‚Äù had been or would be rejected. Given how prominent Dr. Walter Bruck (Figures 1-2) had been in Breslau during his lifetime and the certainty the Nazis knew he was ‚Äúracially‚Äù Jewish and that his daughter was a mischling of the first degree may have been the impetus for Johanna to move her daughter to Berlin; after all, by 1938, Renate Bruck had already been expelled from the ‚ÄúOberlyzeum von Zawadzky,‚Äù the Upper Lyceum in the Zawadskie district of Breslau, the private school for daughters from upper class families. Johanna must have felt the anonymity of a larger city afforded her daughter better protection.\n\nMy cousin Thomas Koch discovered an interesting thing when he examined the Berlin Address Books following Johanna and Renate‚Äôs move to Berlin. Johanna is not listed in the 1942 directory, though this may simply have been a function that her move occurred after the directory went to press. However, more mystifying is that she is not listed in the 1943 Berlin Address Book. There are several possible explanations: (1) sloppiness on the part of the publisher in updating the 1943 Address Book; (2) Johanna and Renate lived at Xantener Stra√üe 24 but under the name of another person because of Renate‚Äôs racial status as a mischling. This possibility seems unlikely because it would have made obtaining ration cards very difficult and would have been contradictory to the openly, social lifestyle Johanna and Renate led. (3) Johanna unintentionally forgot to register properly; or (4) Johanna and Renate temporarily lived outside Berlin, which was in fact the case for a period in 1943-1944, which I will discuss below.\n\nOn May 4, 1942, Johanna makes one of the few entries suggesting the war may have started to impact the everyday lives of ordinary Germans, when she remarks, ‚ÄúFood very scarce!!!‚Äù While the scarcity of food is rarely mentioned again, the arrival of ‚Äúcare‚Äù packages from friends and relatives outside of Berlin is carefully noted throughout the diary suggesting Johanna and Renate depended on these.\n\nIn Post 109(1), I mentioned to readers that upon Renate‚Äôs arrival in Berlin, she attended the ‚ÄúKunstgewerbeschule,‚Äù the School of Arts and Crafts. However, neither Johanna nor Renate ever takes her compulsory schooling seriously; numerous instances of Renate missing school are noted. According to Renate‚Äôs lifelong friend, Ina Schaesberg, Renate acquired a special skill in arts and crafts that enabled her to make ‚Äúvery pretty and practical things from felt that sold well and brought in money.‚Äù\n\nRenate departed Breslau accompanied by her mother on March 19, 1942, though Renate makes a point of noting that two days prior she had visited Matthias Mehne, her future first husband, at his luthier shop to say her goodbyes. (Figure 3) There was already a clear fondness between the two of them. It seems likely Renate and Matthias met at his shop while she was taking violin lessons there. According to Bettina Mehne, Matthias‚Äôs daughter by his second marriage, lessons were given not by Matthias himself but by his good friend, a man named ‚ÄúKulenkampf.‚Äù\n\nRegardless, immediately after Matthias‚Äôs arrival in Berlin in February 1943, he called Renate and they become inseparable until he was forced to enlist in the Wehrmacht towards the latter part of April 1943. Readers may recall from Post 108 that Matthias was found to have helped a Jewish detainee and friend, Anita Lasker-Wallfisch, escape a Sammellager in Breslau, a collection camp for Jewish deportees, with his rucksack in hand. As punishment, the judge, a friend, forced him to join the army rather than let the Gestapo kill him as they had wanted to, figuring he would be killed anyway. Clearly, Matthias‚Äôs departure from Breslau, did not prevent the Wehrmacht from finding him there, so his relocation to Berlin was more likely related to his blossoming relationship with Renate than an attempt to avoid military conscription.\n\nBy around the 22nd of April 1943, Matthias was forced to present himself in Paris for induction into the German Army, but not without first talking to Johanna about his future with Renate according to an entry before his departure. It took me a while to work out that Renate and her mother referred to Matthias as ‚Äúboy‚Äù throughout much of the diary, possibly because of his youthful demeanor or for some other unknown reason. He was clearly Renate‚Äôs primary love interest (Figure 4), though a man named ‚ÄúGerhard‚Äù (surname unknown) was also vying for her affection at the time, a man her twin daughters claim was a love interest for years after the war following her marriage and divorce from Matthias.\n\nBefore backtracking and telling readers about some historic events of WWII I would have expected to be discussed in the Tagebuch, let me briefly tell followers what happened to Matthias following his enlistment. Renate received news of Matthias‚Äôs capture on October 12, 1943. He was evidently assigned to the Italian theater-of-war. The Allies landed in Sicily in around July 1943, and by September 1943 had invaded the Italian mainland. Matthias was captured by the Americans in Italy, but quickly turned over to the British and interned as a prisoner of war near Nottingham, England. Renate received her first letter from him dated the 27th of February 1944 about a month later, on the 26th of March 1944. I want to emphatically emphasize that Matthias was not a Nazi but was forced as punishment to enlist in the Wehrmacht because of the courage he had shown trying to help a Jew escape an internment camp in Breslau.\n\nOn her 17th birthday on the 16th of June 1943, Renate received a diamond ring. While there is no reason to think this was connected to Matthias, who was by then in the German Army, the day after receiving his first letter in March 1944 following his British internment, Renate celebrated what Johanna referred to as Renate‚Äôs ‚Äúengagement day.‚Äù Might Matthias have proposed in his letter? Possibly.\n\nAt the beginning of February 1943, the Axis forces including Germany‚Äôs 6th Army and its foreign allies surrendered in Stalingrad following a brutal battle that had lasted five months, one week, and three days. There is nary any mention of this development during the war in Johanna‚Äôs diary. Nor is there any mention of the ‚ÄúRosenstrasse Protest‚Äù that took place in Berlin during February and March 1943, which fundamentally affected Renate and other mischlinge. This demonstration was initiated and sustained by the non-Jewish wives and relatives of Jewish men and mischlinge who had been arrested and targeted for deportation, based on the racial policy of Nazi Germany. What started out with dozens, then hundreds of women protesting, eventually turned into thousands of women demonstrating in icy winter weather over seven days, until 1,700 Berlin Jews herded together into the Jewish community house on Rosenstrasse near Alexanderplatz were freed. The Rosenstrasse protest is considered a significant event in German history as it was the only mass public demonstration by Germans in the Third Reich against the deportation of Jews. One can only imagine how much horror and misery might have been avoided had such protestations by Germans occurred much earlier. To my cousin Thomas Koch this is very personal since his grandmother and future mother were among the Rosenstrasse protestors, and his Jewish grandfather among those freed.\n\nLet me turn now to an entry made by Renate on the 11th of May 1943, in which she noted that she would not be accepted in the Reich Labor Service, the Reichsarbeitsdienst or RAD. The Reich Labor Service was a major organization established in Nazi Germany to help mitigate the effects of unemployment on the German economy, militarize the workforce, and indoctrinate it with Nazi ideology. It was the official state labor service, divided into separate sections for men and women. So called ‚Äúhalf-breeds,‚Äù mischlinge, were not excluded from labor service. The mother of my cousin Thomas, like Renate also a mischling, was in the Reichsarbeitsdienst in 1940. Thus, it is a source of irritation to Thomas that Renate was somehow able to avoid the labor service. Were the conditions ‚Äútightened‚Äù for Renate through contacts Johanna had that ‚Äúprevented‚Äù her from being accepted? Or was Renate‚Äôs non-acceptance intended to protect her from something or exclude her from something contrary to the rules? We may never know the answers to these questions.\n\nYears ago, when I was still working with Thomas Koch trying to discover where Johanna and Renate Bruck had gone after they left Breslau, which we now know to have been in February-March 1942, Thomas shared with me an application that had been submitted by a woman named Ms. Edith Czeczatka to the Tracing Service of the German Red Cross in 1948. Ms. Czeczatka requested information on the whereabouts of Johanna and Renate and gave as their residential address in the town of Erfurt, Germany, Dammweg 9. (Figures 5a-b) I mentioned this in Post 83, even including a picture of the residential building where they lived. (Figure 6) Johanna and Renate‚Äôs association with Erfurt was a mystery until the discovery of their Tagebuch.\n\nAn entry on the 22nd of May 1943 explains why Renate accompanied by Johanna temporarily moved to Erfurt that year. That day, Renate was told to come for an interview at the employment office of ‚ÄúMAKO Maschinen Co. GMBH‚Äù; she‚Äôd apparently applied for and been hired as a technical draftswoman beginning on June 1st. More on this company below. The company had offices in both Berlin and Erfurt, but Renate was required to report to Erfurt beginning on the 17th of June 1943 for training. Almost immediately, the girls that had been hired were given two months of paid vacation until the drawing rooms were readied. It is clear from the diary that Renate was permanently assigned to work in Erfurt.\n\nTowards the beginning of September 1943, prior to moving to Erfurt, Johanna and Renate went to visit family and friends in Breslau, then spent a few days vacationing in Jannowitz, Silesia [today: Janowice Wielkie, Poland], before returning to Breslau, then leaving for Erfurt on September 12, 1943. For the period of her employment, Renate and her mother lived in Erfurt on weekdays, then returned to Berlin on weekends.\n\nIt appears that for at least a year until September 24, 1944, Johanna and Renate lived with a family called the ‚ÄúHallers.‚Äù Then, on September 25, 1944, they moved within Erfurt into the house at Dammweg 9, previously mentioned, where the ‚ÄúMaulhardt‚Äù family also lived. Presumably, this was a boarding house the family owned.\n\nLet me digress now and briefly discuss the MAKO Maschinen Co. GMBH that Renate worked for. MAKO was a company network owned by Max Kotzan, and the name was a combination of letters from his first and last name. The 1943 Berlin Address Book identified the various components of the business which included chemical-technical and metallurgical development; machine factories; and apparatus engineering and construction. Curious to get a better handle on what the company actually produced, I came upon an obscure reference which I found intriguing because it shed light on Germany‚Äôs efforts to develop solid fuel rockets, which might well have changed the trajectory of the war. Quoting briefly from a publication entitled ‚ÄúThe V2 and the Russian and American Rocket Program‚Äù by Claus Reuter:\n\n‚ÄúMore and more information is now surfacing telling of the launch of a ballistic missile powered by solid propellant near Arnstadt just before the war ended. [EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE: Arnstadt is a town in Thuringia, Germany, about 20 kilometers south of Erfurt. During the Second World War, it was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp, mainly for Poles and Russians.]. Many believe it was this missile which was to carry a nuclear payload. The missile was developed in the top-secret think-tank installation at the Skoda factory under the control of the SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Kammler. . . .\n\n. . . Most historians and experts say that because of the shortage of solid propellants the missile was never produced and that no nuclear program existed.\n\nMore and more eyewitness accounts surface telling us a different story, accounts which say the missile was launched successfully. Also, a photo surfaced showing a large missile being built at the MAKO factory in Rudesleben, Thuringia. It shows the Sonderrakete A-4 (Special Rocket A-4) for solid fuel. The launch took place nearby at one of the top-secret factories in Thuringia the Polte 2 plant. The plant was controlled by SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Kammler.\n\nThe MAKO plant specialized in the construction of pressure tanks and also produced equipment for the Luftwaffe, like drop tank, for the rocket program oxygen tanks for the V-1 and also mobile liquid oxygen transport tanks for the V-2 rocket batteries. The MAKO was owned by Maz Kotzan. Kotzan as a WWI flyer had close connections to Hermann Goering and Ernst Udet, both WWI pilots. The MAKO received the contracts from the RLM [EDITOR‚ÄôS NOTE: Nazi Germany‚Äôs Ministry of Aviation, ‚ÄúReichsluftfahrtministerium,‚Äù abbreviated RLM]. Behind the Polte 2 plant Kotzan had erected two aircraft hangers and a landing strip.\n\nHere personalities like SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Kammler or Wernher von Braun arrived to visit some of the installations. In the MAKO and Polte 2 plants some of the top-secret developments were tested. It was here that the Americans found the top-secret radar-absorbing aircraft paint. The paint was immediately shipped to the U.S.‚Äù\n\nI am obviously no rocket scientist, pardon the pun, so suffice it to say the advantage of a solid motor is that it can provide huge amounts of thrust, and is therefore used as a booster to make satellite launching rockets gain high initial velocity before using higher-efficient liquid motors to gain horizontal velocity above the densest part of the atmosphere. There seems little doubt that had the Nazis been able to master this technology and place fissile material atop a missile powered by solid fuel, at a minimum, the war would have dragged on and more misery and death occurred.\n\nI will readily acknowledge to readers that I have veered quite a distance from Johanna and Renate‚Äôs diary, but this was primarily in the interest of drawing attention to the company for which Renate worked, which was obviously deeply involved in Germany‚Äôs arms development. There is virtually no mention in their diary of Johanna and Renate‚Äôs time in Erfurt, except for their continuing active social lives. However, it is safe to assume that part of their reticence to talk about Erfurt could be connected to statements of secrecy they were sworn to. Clearly, as a mischling Renate wanted to draw as little attention to herself as possible, and it‚Äôs somewhat surprising the company even hired her given her status.\n\nEvidently, by virtue of Renate‚Äôs amorous relationship with Matthias Mehne, her future first husband, she and Johanna had gotten to know Matthias‚Äôs parents, referred to as ‚ÄúMa and Pa‚Äù in the diary and his sister ‚ÄúLu,‚Äù short for Luzie. Matthias‚Äôs parents were Albert Eugen Mehne (b. 1883, Dresden) and Hedwig Gertrud Marie G√∂bel. Johanna and Renate regularly visited, received packages, and stayed in touch with them during Matthias‚Äôs wartime absence. While a reference I found states Albert Eugen Mehne moved to Gelsenkirchen, Germany around 1922 (Figure 7), which is about 500 miles due west of Breslau, Johanna and Renate always visited them in Breslau during the war, suggesting Matthias‚Äôs parents had returned there at some point.\n\nSurprisingly, Johanna and Renate traveled quite extensively during the years 1942 through 1944. While there were periodic disruptions and delays on account of the war, amazingly the trains continued to run on a predictable schedule though often with significant delays. Among the places they stayed besides Berlin, Breslau, and Erfurt were the widely scattered towns of Friedrichroda (small town and health resort in Thuringia), Babelsberg, Potsdam, Jannowitz, Neuendorf and Kantreck in Pomerania bordering the Baltic Sea, and Hamburg. They clearly knew people in many of these places, but others were seemingly vacation destinations.\n\nNot surprisingly, the war had an impact on the lives of Johanna and Renate, although this fact is rarely manifested in the diary. However, on the night of February 16, 1944, the Allies launched a major bomb attack against Berlin, and the following day Johanna was notified by teletype that ‚Äúour apartment had suffered greatly.‚Äù Then, on February 18th, Johanna remarks ‚ÄúOur apartment‚Äîa field of rubble, quite terrible.‚Äù It does not become clear until an entry in the early part of May 1944 that Johanna and Renate‚Äôs apartment was still habitable.\n\nIt goes without saying there are dozens and dozens more entries in Johanna and Renate‚Äôs Tagebuch reflecting on the weather, taking umbrage in air raid shelters, Johanna being hospitalized, and much more. Readers should realize I‚Äôve been very selective in the entries I‚Äôve chosen to highlight to make this post engaging and more reflective of the wartime events that had to have impacted Johanna and Renate‚Äôs lives. My intent is merely to give followers a glimpse into the lives that my ancestors Johanna and Renate Bruck lived during WWII (Figure 8), and how surprisingly ‚Äúnormal‚Äù their existence seems to have been given the enormity of death and destruction that surrounded them.\n\nREFERENCE\n\nReuter, Claus (2000).

Research & Publishing.\n\nNote: This is the first of a two-part story about the wartime ‚Äújournal‚Äù or ‚Äúdiary‚Äù written by Johanna and Renate Bruck, the widow and daughter of my esteemed ancestor from Breslau, Germany [today: Wroc≈Çaw, Poland], Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck (1872-1937), a second cousin twice removed. The German word ‚ÄúTagebuch‚Äù strictly speaking translates as a diary or journal but in effect is more of a record or log of the extensive daily activities Johanna and Renate were engaged in between January 1940 and December 1944. What could have been an extremely absorbing account of the daily lives of an Aryan woman and her ‚Äúmischling‚Äù daughter during WWII, within the context of global events and the impact of National Socialism on Jews, half-Jews, Germans, and others in Europe, instead turns into a mundane and drab account of their rather ‚Äúordinary‚Äù existences. The Tagebuch is often more remarkable for what it omits than what it says about the ongoing events of the tragic period in which it was written. It is difficult to make sense of many of the entries, which would in any case be of little or no interest to readers. For this reason I explain some of the war-related references and discuss a few specific people I‚Äôve been able to identify.\n\nRelated Posts:\n\nPOST 54: ‚ÄúI DECIDE WHO IS A JEW‚Äù\n\nPOST 99: THE ASTONISHING DISCOVERY OF SOME OF DR.

WALTER BRUCK, HIS SECOND WIFE JOHANNA GR√ÑBSCH & HER FAMILY\n\nPOST 103: RENATE BRUCK: A TALE OF TWO GODMOTHERS\n\nRegular followers of my Blog are aware of the multiple posts I have recently written about Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck (1872-1937) and his extended family. This sequence of posts was prompted by a contact earlier this year from a Berlin doctor, Dr. Tilo Wahl, who in around 2013 purchased at auction the commemorative medals, personal effects, private papers, and photos that once belonged to Dr. Bruck. The seller of these items was Nicholas Newman, Dr. Bruck‚Äôs grandson, who sadly committed suicide in 2015 in London.\n\nAs Ms. Madeleine Isenberg, my friend affiliated with the Jewish Genealogical Society of Los Angeles, has been wont to tell me, there is no such thing as coincidence but rather as her uncle impressed upon her, its ‚Äúbeshert,‚Äù fate or predestination. Not only was it providential Dr. Wahl would stumble upon my Blog and contact me, but that he would also share copies of Dr. Bruck‚Äôs personal papers and photos. This was magnified when Nicholas Newman‚Äôs twin sisters from Sydney, Australia, similarly chanced upon my Blog while researching their deceased brother and contacted me.\n\nNicholas‚Äôs twin siblings, Francesca and Michele Newman (Figure 1), are the offspring of Renate Bruck‚Äôs third marriage. Since our initial encounter, we have developed a warm relationship and have had several Zoom calls. The twins have been able to fill in a few holes in my understanding of their mother and grandmother‚Äôs lives following their grandfather‚Äôs death in 1937, but most astoundingly, while examining their family memorabilia, they happened upon a so-called ‚ÄúTagebuch,‚Äù written between January 1940 and December 1944 by their grandmother and mother, Johanna and Renate Bruck. (Figure 2) Technically a diary or journal, it can more accurately be characterized as a record or log of daily events the writers were engaged in.\n\nKnowing the numerous questions I had about Dr. Bruck‚Äôs wife and daughter following his death, they offered to send me the original Tagebuch. While hesitant to risk losing this valuable document, I accepted their gracious offer and fortunately it arrived safely. The twins have since generously donated their mother and grandmother‚Äôs diary to the Museum of Cemetery Art (Old Jewish Cemetery), a Branch of the City Museum of Wroclaw, where their great-grandfather and great-great-grandfather are interred. Since Dr. Walter Bruck is well-known to staff of the museum, they were thrilled beyond measure to receive this donation.\n\nBriefly, let me explain to readers how I was able to learn the contents of the Tagebuch. For much longer than I have been in contact with Francesca and Michele Newman, I have known one of their cousins from the Berlin neighborhood of K√∂penick, Dr. Frank Thomas Koch (Figure 3); as another instance of serendipity, Dr. Tilo Wahl is a practicing dentist in this same district of Berlin. In any case, whereas Thomas and I are fourth cousins, Thomas and the twins are third cousins, so a generation more closely related. Over the years, Thomas and I have collaborated in tracking Johanna and Renate Bruck to England following their emigration from Germany, without specifically uncovering the intermediate steps that led to them arriving there.\n\nGiven Thomas‚Äô interest in this branch of our family, upon learning of the existence of the Tagebuch, he offered to transcribe it. I sent Thomas a high-quality PDF of the journal, which he systematically transcribed over a roughly two-month period. Then, using the best of the known online translators, DeepL, he translated the log. But Thomas went beyond a cursory perusal of the ‚Äújournal.‚Äù He provided some context for events taking place in Nazi Germany that ought to have been touched on by Johanna Bruck but were not. As one additional step, I put Thomas in touch with Renate Bruck‚Äôs lifelong still-living 95-year-old friend, Ina Schaesberg (Figure 4), who was able to recall specific people named in the Tagebuch and identify their role in Johanna and Renate‚Äôs lives. Since Ina speaks little English, Thomas was more effectively able to extract information about these people from her than I could. Finally, yet another source of information was Bettina Mehne (Figure 5), daughter of Renate Bruck‚Äôs first husband, Matthias Eugen Walter Mehne, by Matthias‚Äô second wife; Bettina was able to recognize the diminutive names of some of her ancestors.\n\nBriefly, let me give readers an impression of the Tagebuch. It is a five-year diary, of a type that still exists today, with some peculiarities. It covers the span from January 1, 1940, through December 24, 1944, although not chronologically. That‚Äôs to say, January 31, 1940, is not followed by February 1, 1940, but rather by January 1, 1941, then January 1, 1942, etc. While this may make sense, it prevents the reader from following the flow of events. Thus, Thomas, in transcribing and translating the diary, did so chronologically.\n\nThe diary has two authors, Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck‚Äôs widow, Johanna Bruck n√©e Gr√§bsch, and his daughter, Renate Bruck. (Figure 6) Most of the entries are recorded by Johanna, whose writing is Old German Script in vogue around the 1900‚Äôs (known as ‚Äúdie Kurrentschrift‚Äù or ‚ÄúKurrent‚Äù for short in German); Renate‚Äôs handwriting is more typical of today‚Äôs German cursive.\n\nThe Tagebuch is written in a telegraphic style, meaning in a clipped way of writing that abbreviates words and packs as much information into the fewest number of words or characters. At times, this means that certain terms or turns of phrases are not well understood or are indecipherable.\n\nRarely is the Tagebuch introspective or self-analyzing. Comparatively intimate, confidential, or personal messages are rarely recorded. The diary does not give us a sense of the broader events going on in the war during the Nazi era. For Johanna and Renate life seems to go on as normal, notwithstanding the fact that as a half-Jew Renate was considered a mischling of the first degree.\n\nThe war, the aftermath of its destruction, hunger, and repression are rarely mentioned. If Renate as a mischling or her mother were ever under observation by the Nazis and their informants is never made clear. However, as the author James F. Tent asserts in his seminal book about German mischlinge, ‚ÄúIn the Shadow of the Holocaust: Persecution of Jewish-Christian Germans,‚Äù the intensity of persecution, discrimination, and harassment of mischlinge in the Third Reich varied greatly. Tent reports that in certain areas and regions, there was little distinction between ‚ÄúJews‚Äù and ‚ÄúMischlinge‚Äù in terms of persecution, while in other parts of the Reich virtually nothing happened to them, and they were not treated as outsiders.\n\nThere were at least two areas where Renate‚Äôs status as a mischling affected her life. Until 1938, Renate attended the ‚ÄúOberlyzeum von Zawadzky,‚Äù the Upper Lyceum in the Zawadskie district of Breslau, which was a private school for daughters from upper class families. After 1938, all ‚Äúnon-Aryan‚Äù girls were forced to leave. Following her expulsion from the Lyceum, until Renate relocated with her mother to Berlin in February-March of 1942, she attended the ‚ÄúKloster-Schule der Ursulinen,‚Äù the Ursuline Convent School. Then, beginning in 1942 upon her arrival in Berlin, she attended the ‚ÄúKunstgewerbeschule,‚Äù the School of Arts and Crafts.\n\nThe second area where Renate‚Äôs life was affected by her status as a mischling of the first degree was in her desire to be a fully recognized member of the ‚Äúdeutschen Volksgemeinschaft,‚Äù wanting ‚Äúto belong‚Äù and not be an outsider; the Volksgemeinschaft is a German expression meaning ‚Äúpeople‚Äôs community‚Äù that originally became popular during WWI as Germans rallied in support of the war. It appealed to the idea of breaking down elitism, and uniting people across class divides to achieve a national purpose. During the Nazi era, the wanting ‚Äúto belong‚Äù among children and young people was expressed, among other ways, in their membership in the Hitlerjugend (HJ), Hitler Youth, or the Bund Deutscher M√§del (BDM), League of German Girls or Band of German Maidens. However, anyone who was ‚Äúnon-Aryan‚Äù could not become a member of the Hitler Youth or BDM.\n\nIna Schaesberg, Renate‚Äôs lifelong friend, relates an uncomfortable situation Renate put her in on account of her desire to belong to the BDM. So the story goes that Renate forced Ina to get her a BDM uniform so they could play together as ‚ÄúGerman Maidens‚Äù privately at home wearing their outfits. Jumping ahead to January 1942 which will be discussed in Part 2 of this post, Renate was denounced for this act by an informer that required Johanna to report to the police, although the incident appears to have had no serious consequences.\n\nJohanna resolved to address the matter of Renate‚Äôs exclusion from the BDM. She makes the following entry on January 29, 1941. ‚ÄúI received first a call from Norbert Pohl about BDM application to Hess.‚Äù Let me attempt to put this in context for readers and tell readers about the players, acknowledging that I do not have a copy of Renate‚Äôs BDM application so can only surmise what it may have included.\n\nJohanna Bruck seemingly appealed the issue of Renate‚Äôs application to join the BDM to a high, if not the highest, authority, namely to Hitler‚Äôs deputy in the Nazi Party, Rudolf Hess (1874-1987). The quote above makes this evident. Hess had been the highest-ranking member after Hitler of the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP), National Socialist German Workers‚Äô Party, and Reich Minister without portfolio since 1933 when the Nazis seized power.\n\nJohanna could have justified her request that Renate be accepted into the BDM in one of two ways. Purely hypothetically, Johanna could have argued that Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck was not the biological father of Renate and that she was the daughter of an affair Johanna had had with an ‚ÄúAryan.‚Äù It‚Äôs conceivable Johanna was aware of a similar argument that had been made in the case of the German field marshal general Erhard Milch (Figure 7) by his mother, distant relatives of both Renate and me.\n\nTo remind readers, I wrote about Erhard Milch (1892-1972) in a post entitled ‚ÄúI Decide Who is a Jew‚Äù (Post 54), a saying widely attributed to Hermann Wilhelm G√∂ring, one of the most powerful figures in the Nazi Party between 1933 to 1945. Erhard Milch was a German field marshal general (Generalfeldmarschall) who oversaw the development of the German air force (Luftwaffe) as part of the re-armament of Nazi Germany following WWI. He was State Secretary in the Reich Ministry of Aviation and Inspector General of the Air Force. During most of WWII, he oversaw all aircraft production and supply. In other words, Milch was important to the Nazis. Based on his mother‚Äôs disclosure that Erhard was not the son of her Jewish husband but supposedly born of an incestuous relationship with her uncle, an ‚ÄúAryan,‚Äù he was declared a so-called ‚ÄúHonorary Aryan‚Äù (i.e., a person with Jewish roots who was appointed an honorary Aryan).\n\nThus, one way Johanna hypothetically could have argued that Renate be accepted into the BDM was by professing she was not the child of a Jew. Alternatively, Johanna could have argued that while Renate was regrettably a ‚Äúmischling of the first degree,‚Äù her enthusiasm for the Nazis, their movement, and their ideals more than made up for this ‚Äúflaw.‚Äù Which option Johanna chose is unknown to us. Probably her request was not supported by Hess or was delayed and put on the backburner. Regardless, several months after Johanna‚Äôs request, Hess flew to England in May 1941, ostensibly to make peace with the Allies. He was interned in England, and following Germany‚Äôs defeat, at Nuremberg he was sentenced to many years in prison as a Nazi and war criminal.\n\nWho then was the Norbert Pohl who called Johanna Bruck on January 29, 1941? According to my cousin Thomas Koch, Norbert Pohl (1910-1968) was probably already a big shot in the SS (Schutzstaffel, or Protection Squads) at the time of Johanna‚Äôs BDM request. He was the chief judge of the SS at the Police Court VI in Krakow from July 1940 until March 1942. Johanna makes a remarkable entry on February 12, 1941, recording that she received a call from Frau Pohl, presumably the wife of the SS grandee Norbert Pohl, urging haste with the written request. On February 20th, Johanna delivered the application to the Obergau, a division of the National Socialist state, specifically to the ‚ÄúObergau 4, Obergaubeh√∂rde Niederschlesien der Nazipartei NSDAP,‚Äù which was headquartered in Breslau. Pohl may subsequently have forwarded Johanna‚Äôs letter and documentation to Rudolf Hess and kept her informed about developments.\n\nBecause of the clipped style in which the Tagebuch is written, we are left to wonder about some of the brief entries recorded by Johanna that may have been related to the application submission. For example, on February 28, 1941, so eight days after submitting the petition to the NSDAP, Johanna writes that she sent a letter to Mackensen. This is undoubtedly Anton Ludwig Friedrich August Mackensen (1949-1945), Generalfeldmarschall, Field Marshall General, Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck‚Äôs military superior during WWI (Figure 8) and someone who stood up for him in 1933 after he was dismissed from his academic position. (Figure 9) Could the letter have had anything to do with Renate‚Äôs application to the NSDAP and a request for his support? It seems likely, but we may never know.\n\nAs it relates to the formal written request Johanna submitted for Renate to the Nazi authorities on February 20, 1941, Thomas figured out the German designation for this application was called ‚ÄúGesuch √ºber die Gleichstellung mit Deutschbl√ºtigen,‚Äù an ‚Äúapplication for equality with German-blooded people.‚Äù The relevant literature indicates about 10,000 such applications were presented, but that only about 500 of them were ever approved. Of particular interest is that Hitler himself approved or denied these requests. Hitler‚Äôs allies were apparently more lenient in ratifying them.\n\nWhat is clear from the journal and what we now know was an ‚Äúapplication for equality with German-blooded people‚Äù submitted by Johanna is that she knew many people, including influential Nazis.\n\nUnfortunately, the Tagebuch contains no mention as to what transpired after Renate‚Äôs application was submitted. However, based on an entry recorded on the 16th of September 1941, apparently Johanna suspects that her ‚Äúrequest‚Äù for Renate to be treated ‚Äúas an equal to German-blooded people‚Äù has been or will be rejected.\n\nLet me turn now to log entries having to do with the Nazi regime and wartime events that may be of interest to readers.\n\nOn January 30, 1940, Johanna mentions the hustle and bustle going on that week on account of ‚ÄúF√ºhrerwoche,‚Äù F√ºhrer Week, in honor of the seventh anniversary of Hitler becoming Chancellor of the Reich on January 30, 1933.\n\nOn February 23, 1940, schools other than Renate‚Äôs were closed on account of a so-called ‚Äúcoal vacation,‚Äù days schools were closed during severe winters to save coal and heating oil to be used in support of the war effort.\n\nOn February 25, 1940, Johanna records that ‚ÄúKlaus,‚Äù one of Renate‚Äôs friends, had his National Socialist youth initiation ceremony as school graduation ceremonies and initiation rituals into the Hitler Youth and BDM were referred to at the time.\n\nMay 1st was a National Holiday, ‚ÄúTag der Arbeit,‚Äù Labor Day, interestingly appropriating a tradition from the Labor movement.\n\nOn June 2nd, 1940, Johanna mentions listening to the radio, without specifically indicating that the broadcast presumably celebrated the Wehrmacht‚Äôs victory over France. Then, on June 25th, there was a school vacation because of ‚Äúthe acceptance of the peace terms imposed on the French.‚Äù\n\nInterestingly, on November 23, 1940, the day of Hitler‚Äôs failed ‚ÄúBeer Hall Putsch‚Äù in 1923, in Munich, the F√ºhrer delivered a radio broadcast.\n\nIn several places, Johanna merely records ‚ÄúF√ºhrer speech,‚Äù so we are left to peruse the history books to identify what major speech Hitler delivered on these dates. The first instance is on February 24, 1941, which corresponds with a celebration at the M√ºnchener Hofbr√§uhaus on the announcement of the NSDAP platform when Hitler declared an intensification of submarine warfare.\n\nOn April 9, 1941, Johanna remarks on the ‚Äúgreat political events in the Balkans,‚Äù which coincided with the Wehrmacht‚Äôs campaign against then-Yugoslavia and Greece, resulting in Salonika‚Äôs capture on that date.\n\nOn May 4, 1941, Johanna again merely records, ‚ÄúF√ºhrer speech.‚Äù This coincides with an address Hitler made before the German Reichstag, in which he invoked the alleged desire for peace on the part of Nazi Germany, which had always been thwarted and now led once again to the defeat of then-Yugoslavia and Greece in the Balkans.\n\nOn June 22, 1941, Johanna records that Adolf Hitler declared war on the Soviet Union. No further embellishment is provided. Then, on October 3rd, there is another entry, ‚ÄúF√ºhrer speech.‚Äù This day it turns out marked the start of the Kriegswinter-Hilfswerks, War Winter Relief Fund, and Hitler‚Äôs declaration that the Soviet Union had already been defeated and would never rise again. Barely two weeks later, the German Wehrmacht, accustomed to victory, took its first major defeat during the Battle of Moscow.\n\nRelatedly, jumping ahead to January 3, 1942, Johanna makes another clipped entry that requires explanation: ‚Äú. . .sweater and jacket donated for the soldiers.‚Äù Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion plan, called for the capture of Moscow within four months of the Axis forces invasion of the Soviet Union on the 22nd of June 1941. Hitler and his generals were convinced they would defeat the Soviet Union before the onset of winter 1941. Therefore, the German soldiers were ill-equipped for the severe winter when the Red Army counter-attacked during the Battle of Moscow, and they were largely without winter clothes. The donations of clothing from the German population were intended to compensate for this lack of winter equipment; Johanna was among the donors.\n\nLet me turn now to some entries in the Tagebuch that give us insight into aspects of Johanna and Renate‚Äôs personal lives and their circle of friends and acquaintances. While of lesser interest than the terse war-related notes, they are still noteworthy.\n\nAccording to a note recorded on the 24th of March 1940, Johanna and Renate were members of the ‚ÄúChristengemeinschaft.‚Äù The ‚ÄúChristengemeinschaft, Movement for Religious Renewal‚Äù is a Christian church that is close to anthroposophy but is regarded as an independent cult community. It was founded in Switzerland in 1922 following the suggestions of Rudolf Steiner and had followers in Breslau. Today, there are 140 congregations in Germany though the church exists worldwide. From the point of view of the mainstream churches, it represents, among other things, a different understanding of baptism.\n\nIt was through the Christengemeinschaft that Johanna sought to have Renate accepted for confirmation classes. Judging from the somewhat vague notes in the Tagebuch, there were discussions and a dispute with Church Pastor M√ºller about this, but Johanna eventually prevailed seemingly with the help of other members of the congregation. In any case, Renate was eventually confirmed on the 17th of March 1941.\n\nRelatedly, on June 19, 1941, Johanna makes a point of mentioning the ban of eurythmy in schools, and the great joy it elicited; whether this was personal joy or more widespread elation is unclear. Eurythmy is an expressive movement art originated by Rudolf Steiner in conjunction with Marie von Sivers in the early 20th century. Primarily a performance art, it was also used in education, especially in Waldorf schools, and ‚Äì as part of anthroposophic medicine ‚Äì for claimed therapeutic purposes. The ban of eurythmy was probably connected with the flight of Rudolf Hess, Hitler‚Äôs Deputy, to England on May 10, 1941. With his departure, anthroposophy lost its most important promoter among the Nazi hierarchy. Ten days prior to the ban on eurythmy, the Christengemeinschaft to which Johanna and Renate belonged had been banned, and its priests and leading community members jailed. While Johanna makes mention of the eurythmy ban, she is silent on the ban of the church. What effect the ban had on Johanna and Renate is unknown, but, regardless, by this time Renate had already been confirmed.\n\nA brief entry from July10, 1941, ‚Äúletter to . . .Lettehaus‚Äù was explained to me by my cousin. ‚ÄúLetteverein‚Äù and ‚ÄúLettehaus‚Äù were institutions founded in 1866 to ‚Äúpromote the gainful employment of women.‚Äù Johanna was faced with the problem that her daughter was basically barred from higher education and university studies in Nazi Germany for ‚Äúracial‚Äù reasons. But even though higher education was not attainable for Renate, economic independence was a goal for Johanna, who had to remember she would not live forever and that her assets might not be transferable to Renate. Therefore, these institutions offered options. In clarifying this entry, Thomas explained that his mother, also a mischling of the first degree, availed herself of the Letteverein and Lettehaus.\n\nAs to Johanna and Renate‚Äôs financial situation, let me say a few words. As I have alluded to and discussed in earlier posts, Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck was an eminent dentist. He was the personal dentist to the last German Kaiser‚Äôs family and other members of the nobility. Judging from the lavish social events he hosted and the lifestyle he led, it can be assumed he was well-to-do.\n\nAccording to Breslau address books of the time, during the late 1920‚Äôs and the early 1930‚Äôs Dr. Bruck and his family lived in a luxurious home at Reichspr√§sidentenplatz 17 (Figure 10), with the owner of record at the time being Walter Bruck. Following the death of Paul von Hindenburg, the German general and statesman who led the Imperial German Army during World War I and later became President of Germany from 1925 until his death in 1934, Reichspr√§sidentenplatz was renamed by the Nazis to Hindenburgplatz. The renaming of the square was reflected in Breslau address books only in 1935. By 1937, however, his wife Johanna Bruck was now shown as the owner of record even though Walter continued to live at Hindenburgplatz 17. The change in ownership from Walter to Johanna Bruck was a measure to avoid expropriation of the estate by the Nazis as Walter was considered ‚ÄúJewish,‚Äù whereas his wife was deemed to be ‚ÄúAryan.‚Äù We know from elsewhere that Walter converted from Judaism in about 1917, around the time his mother died, and that, unlike his accomplished father and grandfather, respectively Dr. Julius Bruck and Dr. Jonas Julius Bruck, he was not interred in Breslau‚Äôs Jewish Cemetery. Obviously, as far as the Nazis were concerned, Walter‚Äôs conversion from Judaism was of no consequence and he was still deemed Jewish. On multiple occasions, Johanna mentions that she and Renate visited her deceased husband‚Äôs grave, regrettably never mentioning which cemetery he was interred in. This is a mystery to be resolved.\n\nDr. Walter Bruck died in Breslau on the 31st of March 1937, whether by his own hand or not is unknown. Following Walter‚Äôs death, Johanna is presumed to have sold the house around that time because when in 1939, the ‚Äúracial‚Äù census takes place (Figure 11), the widow Johanna Bruck and her daughter Renate Bruck are no longer living at Hindenburgplatz 17, but at Oranienstrasse 4. (Figure 12) The latter house does not belong to Johanna but to a retired banker by the name of ‚ÄúE. Bucher.‚Äù Johanna and Renate apparently lived there in a large stately apartment, from which they sublet rooms. Apart from the income this generated, Johanna undoubtedly received a significant sum of money from the sale of the house at Hindenburgplatz 17 as well as an inheritance from her husband. At various points in the Tagebuch, Johanna bemoans the expenditure of money on certain things, but rarely do we get the impression that she is lacking for money, nor does her active social life or the multiple activities she and Renate are enrolled in suggest otherwise.\n\nThere are scores upon scores of names mentioned in the journal. An unusually large number of them are referred to as ‚ÄúTante,‚Äù aunt, or ‚ÄúOnkel,‚Äù uncle, with most presumed to be close friends rather than blood relatives. Several, however, ‚ÄúTante Leni,‚Äù ‚ÄúTante Irene‚Äù or ‚ÄúTante I.,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOnkel Willy‚Äù are known to the writer and are unquestionably Johanna and Renate‚Äôs kin. In some instances mention is made of celebrating this or that person‚Äôs birthday on a particular day or week; given my familiarity with the dates of birth of family members, I was able to work out how some of the people were referred to. Thus ‚ÄúTante I.‚Äù was Johanna‚Äôs sister-in-law, Irene Elisabeth Gr√§bsch n√©e Klar who was married to Johanna‚Äôs brother, Paul Karl Hermann Gr√§bsch. Tante Irene was often accompanied by her son ‚ÄúEbi,‚Äù a cousin and frequent playmate of Renate‚Äôs. (Figure 13) ‚ÄúTante Leni‚Äù was Johanna‚Äôs sister, Helene Emma Clara Steinberg n√©e Gr√§bsch. (Figure 14) ‚ÄúOnkel Willy‚Äù was Willy Gr√§bsch, a merchant from Breslau, probably unmarried or widowed, whose relationship to Johanna is unclear.\n\nPersonally intriguing is the mention made on March 30, 1940, that Renate went to visit ‚ÄúTante Margarethe‚Äù to wish her a happy birthday. The quotation marks indicate that while she was not a relative, she was still referred to as an aunt. There is no doubt this is Dr. Walter Wolfgang Bruck‚Äôs first wife who was Jewish, Margarethe Bruck n√©e Skutsch. (Figure 15) She was born on March 30, 1872, in Breslau [Wroc≈Çaw, Poland], and murdered in the Theresienstadt Ghetto on the 22nd of September 1942. (Figure 16) It is surprising that Johanna and Renate were in touch with Walter‚Äôs first wife, although, as this was certainly the case, it‚Äôs astonishing that Johanna made no mention in the diary when Margarethe was deported. Perhaps Johanna had already distanced herself from this Jewish ‚Äúaunt‚Äù by then?\n\nAmong the names mentioned are a coterie I surmise are people who provided professional services to Johanna, such as housecleaners, cooks, seamstresses, teachers, clergy, etc. This includes ‚ÄúFr√§ulein Anna,‚Äù Miss Anna. According to Ina Schaesberg, she was the cook in the Bruck household for many years, during Dr. Bruck‚Äôs lifetime and after his death. She was considered ‚ÄúAryan.‚Äù According to the 1935 ‚ÄúLaw for the Protection of German Blood and German Honor,‚Äù Jews were forbidden to employ ‚ÄúAryan maids‚Äù under the age of 45. However, since Anna exceeded this age limit, she could remain employed in the house of Walter Bruck even after 1935. Following the death of Walter in 1937, she continued to work for Johanna and even followed her to Berlin (more on this in Part 2 of the post).\n\nJohanna‚Äôs and Renate‚Äôs beloved long-haired dachshund, ‚ÄúResi,‚Äù is often mentioned, though it took me some time to figure out that this was a dog and not a person. (Figure 17)\n\nBecause Renate was an exceptionally cute young girl who blossomed into a very attractive young woman, she had droves of admirers whom she frequently saw and skillfully manipulated. The fate of most are unknown, but in at least two instances Johanna tells us precisely the dates they were killed while serving in the Wehrmacht. The death of ‚ÄúHans Roth,‚Äù often mentioned in the diary, is noted on October 26, 1941, though he was killed on the 21st of September 1941 on the Eastern Front as his death certificate confirms. (Figures 18a-b) Similarly, an even closer friend of Renate‚Äôs, ‚ÄúChristoph von Kospoth,‚Äù was killed-in-action on the 4th of April 1944 near Dresden, Germany. (Figures 19a-b)\n\nOther names and deaths are recorded by Johanna, but I‚Äôve been unable to match them with historic documents which might have been able to tell me more about them.\n\nMany names in the Tagebuch include only forenames or surnames, so it‚Äôs impossible to precisely identify these individuals. However, in several instances, with surnames and professions given I was able with certainty to discover the identities or people. While these rarely add much to the narrative of Johanna‚Äôs and Renate‚Äôs lives, I will discuss a few only because I was able to learn something about them.\n\nA name that frequently appears in Johanna‚Äôs entries is called ‚ÄúHella Goossens.‚Äù She appears to have been a friend. This represents the sole instance where I was able to find a picture of someone named in Johanna‚Äôs and Renate‚Äôs diary who was not a family member. A vivacious looking woman born on the 21st of May 1884 in Hagen, North Rhine-Westphalia, a Rio de Janeiro Immigration Card shows she immigrated to Brazil in 1950 (Figure 20); she is identified as a domestic worker. Seemingly, she was joining her son, Herbert Goossens, who had immigrated there in 1939. (Figure 21)\n\nAs I alluded to earlier when talking about Johanna and Renate‚Äôs financial situation, both were involved in numerous extracurricular activities, particularly Renate. For her part, Johanna was taking Italian lessons with a Frau Koesel at the home of a Frau Conberti. Mrs. Conberti is listed in Breslau Address Books between 1934 and 1941 and shows she was an interpreter and language teacher. (Figures 22a-b) One is left to wonder whether Johanna was merely taking Italian for self-improvement, or envisioned emigrating to Italy? In the case of Renate, she was taking piano lessons, violin classes, tap classes, confirmation classes, and more. She would meet her future first husband, Matthias Mehne, in late 1941 in Breslau at his luthier shop, and immediately be ‚Äúsmitten‚Äù by him, but there is no indication they got involved romantically until they met again in Berlin in 1942.\n\nReaders may wonder, as I did, whether any of Johanna‚Äôs and Renate‚Äôs acquaintances and friends are directly or indirectly acknowledged as Jewish. In one instance the name ‚ÄúGrete Stomberg or Sternberg‚Äù is noted, who can be presumed to have been Jewish because her apartment was confiscated by the Nazis. Another named individual was ‚ÄúFerdinand Abramczyk,‚Äù later identified through a Breslau Address Book as a Justizrat, a member of the Judicial Council, who‚Äôd had ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù added as his middle name by the Nazis to mark him as Jewish.\n\nJohanna frequently mentions bouts of ‚Äúbiliary pain,‚Äù most frequently caused by obstruction of the common bile duct or the cystic duct by a gallstone. This would eventually lead to hospitalization.\n\nThere is one final topic I want to discuss before ending the rather lengthy first part of Post 109. As previously mentioned, it appears that by September of 1941, Johanna is aware that Renate‚Äôs application for her to be treated ‚Äúas an equal to German-blooded people‚Äù has been or will be rejected. This may have been the impetus for Johanna to relocate to Berlin. However, rather than simply move there, Johanna sought to swap apartments with someone from Berlin. She hosted a couple, the G√ºnthers, with whom she would eventually exchange apartments. In February-March 1942, Johanna and Renate would move to Xantener Stra√üe 24, in the Berlin district of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. More will be said on this in Part 2 of Post 109.\n\nAmong the more popular posts I have published in my Blog are veritable wartime diaries I have managed to get a hold of from various branches of my Jewish family. In all these instances, there is clearly an effort on the part of the author to write names in code or designate Jewish or ‚Äúrighteous‚Äù individuals by single letters or initials to conceal their identities. At no time do I detect a similar intent by Johanna or Renate.\n\nLiterally, with the hundreds of entries in Johanna‚Äôs and Renate‚Äôs Tagebuch, it is difficult to do justice to the diary. However, as I‚Äôve indicated multiple times, the clipped style of writing associated with a telegraphic style makes it unlikely I would have been able to decipher the names of most of their acquaintances and friends nor the role they played in their lives. More importantly, it‚Äôs improbable this would have added much to the narrative since so many of the entries focused not on the political and current events of the time but rather on the social and amorous activities of the writers.\n\nIn closing I will quote from Ms. Renata Wilkoszewska-Krakowska‚Äôs observations of Johanna and Renate‚Äôs diary. Renate is my friend and Branch Manager, Museum of Cemetery Art (Old Jewish Cemetery) which is a Branch of the City Museum of Wroclaw, the institute where the Tagebuch was donated. Sadly, Renata‚Äôs thoughts mirror my own: ‚ÄúI am amazed that in the era of mass deportations of Breslau and Silesian Jews from 1941 to 1944, there is nothing in the diary on this subject. On November 21, 1941, over a thousand people were arrested, held for four days at the Odertorbahnhof train station, then deported to Kaunas, Lithuania, and shot on November 29th. Among them were many famous and influential inhabitants of Breslau, including Willy Cohn and his family, author of the famous diary/journal entitled ‚ÄúKein Recht. Nirgends‚Äù (‚ÄúNo Law. Nowhere.‚Äù), published in German and Polish. In the context of the war, the everyday life of Johanna and Renate seems quite banal and normal. It‚Äôs hard for me to believe it, because as early as 1942, mischlinge were also deported to the occupied part of Poland and East.‚Äù\n\nREFERENCES\n\nSchwarzm√ºller, Theo.
