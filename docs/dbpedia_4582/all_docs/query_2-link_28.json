        "text": "Friedrich Cerha (German: [ˈfʁiːdʁɪç ˈt͜sɛʁha]; 17 February 1926 – 14 February 2023) was an Austrian composer, conductor, and academic teacher. His ensemble Die Reihe [de] in Vienna was instrumental in spreading contemporary music in Austria. He composed several operas, beginning with Baal, based on Brecht's play. He is best known for completing Alban Berg's opera Lulu by orchestrating its unfinished third act, which premiered in Paris in 1979.\n\nLife and career[]\n\nCerha was born in Vienna on 17 February 1926, the son of an electrical engineer.[1][2] He played the violin at age six, instructed by Anton Pejhovsky, and began composing two years later.[1][3]\n\nAt 17, Cerha was drafted as a Luftwaffenhelfer in 1943,[1][3] and initially served in Achau, near Vienna.[1] During this time, he participated in a number of acts of resistance against the fascist regime. After a semester at the University of Vienna, he was sent to an officer's school in occupied Denmark. While there, he obtained a number of blank, but signed, marching order papers and deserted. These papers allowed him to remain within German territory for some time as he could use them as proof that he was supposed to be there. However, after a period, he was forced to rejoin a military unit during an advance by the Soviet forces near Pomerania. He deserted a second time and made his way to the west of Austria, where he lived in the mountains for several months to avoid capture by the Allied forces, until he was eventually able to return to Vienna[4] in November 1945.[1]\n\nAt the Vienna Music Academy, Cerha studied violin with Váša Příhoda, composition with Alfred Uhl, and music pedagogy.[1][3] Simultaneously, he studied musicology, German culture and language, and philosophy at the University of Vienna[1][5] His dissertation there, on the Turandot topic in music, was completed in 1954.[6]\n\nIn 1958 Cerha founded the ensemble Die Reihe [de] together with Kurt Schwertsik, which was instrumental in spreading contemporary music in Austria. In addition to composing, Cerha earned a reputation as an interpreter of the works of Alban Berg, Arnold Schoenberg, and Anton Webern.[2] This work included the completion of Berg's unfinished three-act opera Lulu.[2] Cerha orchestrated sections of the third act using Berg's notes as a reference, beginning studies of the subject in 1962.[1] The complete three-act opera was premiered by Pierre Boulez in Paris Opéra on 24 February 1979,[3][7] and directed by Patrice Chéreau.[8] Alongside his career as a composer and conductor, Cerha taught at the University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna from 1959, where he was professor of composition, notation, and interpretation of new music from 1976 to 1988.[1][3]\n\nCerha composed both orchestral works and operas. His first opera was Baal, based on Brecht's play of the same name, and influenced by Berg's Wozzeck.[8] It was premiered at the Salzburg Festival in 1981, with performances at the Vienna State Opera and a production at the Staatsoper Berlin in 1982.[1] It was followed by Der Rattenfänger and Der Riese vom Steinfeld, the latter commissioned by the Vienna State Opera, with a libretto by Peter Turrini,[3] and premiered in 2002.[1]\n\nCerha and his wife Gertraud, a music historian, were founding members of the Joseph Marx Society in April 2006.[9]\n\nCerha died in Vienna on 14 February 2023, at age 96.[3][8][10][11]\n\nAwards[]\n\n1964: Theodor Körner Prize[12]\n\n1986: Grand Austrian State Prize for Music[3][12]\n\n1986: Gold Medal of the Province of Styria[12]\n\n1986: Honorary Medal of Vienna in gold[12]\n\n1988: Honorary Member of the Vienna Konzerthaus[13]\n\n2005: Austrian Decoration for Science and Art[3][14]\n\n2006: Golden Lion of the Biennale Musica in Venice[3][12]\n\n2007: Honorary Member of the Society of Friends of Music in Vienna[13]\n\n2008: Gold Medal for services to the region of Vienna[3][12]\n\n2010: Silver Commander's Cross of Honour for Services to the province of Lower Austria[12]\n\n2011: Salzburg Music Prize[3][12]\n\n2012: Ernst von Siemens Music Prize[3][12][15]\n\nHonorary doctorates[]\n\n2017: University of Siegen[6][16]\n\nWorks[]\n\nCerha's compositions were published by Universal Edition,[17] including:[18]\n\nOperas[]\n\nNetzwerk, 1981 for singers, reciter, movement groups and orchestra[5]\n\nBaal, 1974/81 – text: Bertolt Brecht\n\nDer Rattenfänger, 1987 – text: Carl Zuckmayer\n\nCompletion of the opera Lulu by Alban Berg, 1962–78[5]\n\nDer Riese vom Steinfeld, 2002 – text: Peter Turrini, 2002\n\nOnkel Präsident [de], 2013 – text: Peter Wolf and Cerha\n\nOther works[]\n\nSpiegel I, 1960 for movement groups, light objects, orchestra, and tape[5][2]\n\nSpiegel II–VII, 1960–72[2]\n\nSinfonie, 1975\n\nRequiem für Hollensteiner, Text: Thomas Bernhard 1982/83,[5] dedicated to Kurt Ohnsorg, commissioned by Austrian Musical Youth for the 25th anniversary of the Vienna Youth Choir.[19]\n\nBaal-Gesänge, 1983\n\nKeintate I, II, 1983 ff.[5]\n\nMonumentum für Karl Prantl, 1988\n\nIntroitus and Kyrie of Requiem of Reconciliation, 1995\n\nFünf Stücke for clarinet in A, cello and piano, 1999–2000\n\nConcerto for Soprano Saxophone and Orchestra, 2003–2004\n\nViolin Concerto, 2004\n\nOboe Quintet, 2007\n\nPercussion Concerto, 2007–2008\n\nLike a Tragicomedy for orchestra, 2008–2009\n\nBruchstück, geträumt for ensemble, 2009\n\nParaphrase of the beginning of Beethoven's Symphony No. 9, 2010\n\nZebra-Trio for string trio, 2011\n\nTagebuch for orchestra, 2012\n\nDrei Sätze für Orchester, 2015\n\nFasce for orchestra,[5] before 1993\n\nLangegger Nachtmusiken I-III,[5] before 1993\n\nRelazioni fragili for chamber ensemble,[5] before 1993\n\nReferences[]\n\nFurther reading[]\n\nClements, Andrew (12 October 2015). \"Friedrich Cerha Day review – a fuller picture of the man who finished Lulu\". http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/12/friedrich-cerha-day-wigmore-hall-london-review.\n\nCagney, Liam (14 February 2023). \"A tribute to Friedrich Cerha, who has died at the age of 96\". https://www.gramophone.co.uk/features/article/a-tribute-to-friedrich-cerha-who-has-died-at-the-age-of-96.\n\nLeyrer, Georg (14 February 2023). \"Komponist Friedrich Cerha ist tot: Ein stiller Gigant der Musik\" (in de). https://kurier.at/kultur/komponist-friedrich-cerha-ist-tot-ein-stiller-gigant-der-musik/402310277.\n\nKoch, Gerhard R.
