        "text": "From Vocal School to University\n\nIn 1815, what is now the Styrian Music Society was founded as the Academic Music Society (Akademischer Musikverein) in Graz. In 1816, the society announced that it was to open a vocal school. The Academic Music Society’s vocal school began offering tuition – making it Austria’s oldest music institute and the root of today’s University for Music and Performing Arts in Graz (KUG). The social and educational significance of this private society was highlighted in 1819, when Archduke Johann, one of the brothers of reigning Habsburg Emperor Franz I, became a patron of the Music Society. During his 40-year patronage, he made a significant contribution to the development of the society’s school. As a result, the number of students rose continuously, reaching well over 400 by the start of the 20th century and encompassing musicians from Turkey, Russia, France, Egypt and America.\n\nIn 1920, the Society’s music school was granted permission to use the title of Conservatoire.\n\nAs of 1 April 1939, the Conservatoire was separated from the Music Society and brought under public management by the Province of Styria as the Styrian Provincial Music School in Graz (Steirische Landesmusikschule Graz). Its purpose was to train professional musicians in the province, while the State University for Music Education (Staatliche Hochschule für Musikerziehung) in Graz-Eggenberg taught those who wanted to teach music at higher education establishments and music schools, as well as offering private music tuition. A four-semester course was introduced alongside this for folk music and youth music leaders.\n\nAfter 1945 the Styrian Provincial Music School continued to be run, using public funds, as the Styrian Provincial Conservatoire with the School of Folk Music in Graz (Steiermärkisches Landeskonservatorium mit der Volks-Musikschule Graz).The role of the Conservatoire, known as the “training school”, was to provide professional training for musicians and music teachers in the individual subject areas.\n\nStrictly speaking, the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz (KUG) is a relatively young institution. With an amendment to the Academy of the Arts Act (Kunstakademiegesetz) (Austrian Federal Law Gazette dated 17 July 1962), on 1 June 1963 the Styrian Provincial Conservatoire became a federal institution – the Academy of Music and Performing Arts in Graz (Akademie für Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz), one of four art academies in Austria. Its first president was Erich Marchkl. (Marchkl’s role in Nazi music education is being researched as part of wider activities involving scholarly examination of the history of the institution during and in connection with the Nazi era. As an example, please see the university archive project sponsored by the Austrian National Bank Anniversary Fund.)\n\nAs a result of the Austrian College of the Arts Organisation Act 1970 (Kunsthochschulorganisationsgesetz), the Academy became the College of Music and Performing Arts Graz (Hochschule für Musik und darstellende Kunst in Graz), with Friedrich Korcak appointed as the first rector on 18 May 1971. He was succeeded in 1979 by Otto Kolleritsch, who was in office until 1987. Sebastian Benda was subsequently rector from 1987 to 1991, before Kolleritsch was reappointed to the role, remaining in office until 2007.\n\nIn 1983, when the Austrian College of the Arts Studies Act (Kunsthochschulstudiengesetz) came into effect, the College of Music and Performing Arts Graz was granted the authority to award degrees for completion of any degree course. Since 1986, it has also been permitted to confer doctoral degrees.\n\nThe University\n\nAt the start of the academic year 1998/99, the six Austrian colleges of the arts had their formal status changed from Kunsthochschulen to Universitäten and became fully-fledged universities.\n\nThe first rector to be appointed following the Austrian Universities Act 2002 (Universitätsgesetz) was Otto Kolleritsch, on 9 May 2003. His vice-rectors were Hermann Becke (Resource Management and Infrastructure), Renate Bozic (Staff Development and Women’s Advocacy) und Georg Schulz (Teaching). One of the noteworthy and lasting outcomes of his tenure was the planning and political implementation of the House of Music and Music Theatre (Haus für Musik und Musiktheater – MUMUTH).\n\nHe was succeeded from 2007 to 2011 by Georg Schulz, whose vice-rectors were Doris Carstensen (Quality Management, Staff Development and Gender Mainstreaming), Robert Höldrich (Art and Scholarship) and Elke Straub (Teaching) With the Dr.artium programme, introduced during Schulz’s tenure, KUG became the first institution in the German-speaking countries to offer an artistic doctorate. The Centre for Gender Research (Zentrum für Genderforschung) was also established in the same year, and for the first time in the history of Austrian music universities, an ensemble – Klangforum Wien – received a professorship (Performance Practice in Contemporary Music).\n\nObjections relating to the reappointment of Georg Schulz in 2011 triggered an interim period – from October 2011 until the end of February 2012 – under Robert Höldrich as Executive Vice-Rector together with Elke Straub as Vice-Rector for Teaching. From March 2012 to 12 December 2012, Georg Schulz was in office as Rector with Vice-Rectors Robert Höldrich (Research), Elisabeth von Magnus (Art), Barbara Simandl (Finance and Infrastructure) and Elke Straub (Teaching). Following the decision of the Higher Administrative Court on the procedure for election of a rector, the university had another period of interim management, with Robert Höldrich as Executive Vice-Rector and the aforementioned vice-rectors from Schulz’s tenure, who remained in office until the position of rector was filled. During this period the 50-year anniversary of becoming an academy was celebrated, the Computer Music and Sound Design degree course was introduced (in cooperation with the FH Joanneum) and there was a significant expansion of the technical and instrumental infrastructure.\n\nIn the 2014/15 academic year, Elisabeth Freismuth became the first woman to take up the post of Rector of KUG. Her Vice-Rectors were Barbara Boisits (Research), Elisabeth von Magnus (Art), Barbara Simandl (Resources) and Eike Straub (Teaching). During her office, Freismuth contributed greatly to the public image of KUG, making its 200th anniversary a real focus of attention.\n\nAs a result of complaints relating to the fact that Elisabeth Freismuth was not reappointed, an interim rector had to be appointed once again in 2018. Eike Straub acted as Executive Vice-Rector, assisted by Vice-Rectors Barbara Boisits (Research, to 31 December 2018), Elisabeth von Magnus (Art) and Barbara Simandl (Resources). A plan for organisational reform to modernise the university’s administrative structure was developed and subsequently implemented at the end of 2019.\n\nAt the start of the summer semester 2020, Georg Schulz took up the post of Rector once more. His team consists of Vice-Rectors Gerd Grupe (Research, Gender and Diversity), Barbara Simandl (Finance and Personnel Administration), Constanze Wimmer (Academic and International Affairs) and Marie-Theres Holler (Infrastructure and Digitalization). Alongside his statutory duties as Rector, Georg Schulz is also responsible for art and quality management. As published in the University Gazette of 11 May 2022, Rector Georg Schulz was reappointed for a second term of office. This term ends in February 2028.\n\nAt present (as of summer semester 2023), around 2,200 students from 71 nations are studying at the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz, which has 17 institutes, a centre for gender research, and both artistic and artistic-scholarly doctoral programmes. With almost 1,000 events annually, allowing students to receive practically assessed training, KUG is the largest cultural events organiser in Styria.\n\nAcademy\n\n1963 | Styrian Provincial Music School elevated to Academy of Music and Performing Arts Graz\n\nThe history of today's University of Music and Performing Arts Graz dates back to the year the school of the Styrian Music Society was founded in 1816. From 1920, this school was permitted to use the title of “conservatoire”. Strictly speaking, the University of Music and Performing Arts Graz is a relatively young institution. With an amendment to the Austrian Academy of the Arts Act (Austrian Federal Law Gazette dated 17 July 1962), on 1 June 1963 the Styrian Provincial Music School in Graz became a federal institution – the Academy of Music and Performing Arts Graz – one of four art academies in Austria.\n\nErich Marckhl, head of the Conservatoire since 1957, was the Academy’s founding president. (Marchkl’s role in Nazi music education is being researched as part of wider activities involving scholarly examination of the history of the institution during and in connection with the Nazi era. As an example, please see the university archive project sponsored by the Austrian National Bank Anniversary Fund.)\n\nPalais Meran, the residence of Archduke Johann and his heirs from 1845 to 1939, has served as the university’s headquarters since 1963.\n\nTogether with the departments of music theory, keyboard instruments, string instruments, guitar and harp, wind and percussion instruments, music education, church music, solo singing, choirs, orchestral conducting and repetiteur work, and performing arts, the Institute of (Practical) Music Folklore and the Archive of the Styrian Association of Music Schools formed part of the basic structure of the academy. While some of the names may have changed, the 17 artistic and scholarly institutes of today’s University of Music and Performing Arts Graz are based on this organisational structure for the academy.\n\n1964 | Foundation of Music Folklore and the Archive of the Styrian Association of Music Schools\n\nThe primary role of the Academy’s scholarly institutes was research. These institutes were autonomous facilities, independent of the artistic departments.\n\nThe Institute of Music Folklore and Archive of the Styrian Association of Music Schools (known as the Institute of Ethnomusicology since 2009) is the oldest of a total of five institutes. It was founded and initally run by Walter Wünsch. According to its mission statement, it is dedicated to researching “tradition and modernity in the world’s musical cultures”. The Archive of the Styrian Association of Music Schools, which was attached to the institute, was where all key documents (including sound documents) relating to music education activities in music schools in the Province of Styria were collected and stored.\n\n1964 | Inaugural General Meeting of the Society of Friends of the Academy of Music and Performing Arts Graz\n\nOn 10 April 1964, the inaugural General Meeting of the Society of Friends of the Academy of Music and Performing Arts Graz took place in the academy’s hall in Nikolaigasse. Former Deputy Governor Tobias Udier, who had contributed greatly to the elevation of the state conservatoire to an academy, was appointed as the first president. The purpose of the society is set out in Section 2 of the Articles of Association: The Society of Friends is an independent, non-political association whose functions include the moral and objective support of the further expansion of the Academy of Music and Performing Arts Graz, material assistance where other means are not available, the support of the students and the procurement of instruments, books, tapes and records. At the outset, the association had about a hundred members.\n\n1965 | Foundation of the Jazz Institute\n\nThe institute founded and run by Friedrich Körner was initially a research and teaching facility. In April 1969, it was split into the department of jazz practice – headed by Dieter Glawischnig – and the independent Institute of Jazz Research, which deals with scholarly research in the field of jazz and jazz-idiomatic music.\n\n1965 | Establishment of a campus in Oberschützen in Burgenland\n\nThe campus in the municipality of Oberschützen in Burgenland was originally set up to enable those people who would otherwise have been prevented due to transport issues to complete a degree at a college of the arts. Integrated into the organisational structure of KUG as Institute 12 since 1998, it has its own studies and examination department as well as a library. Since 1982, the campus has been housed in the new building of the Oberschützen cultural centre.\n\n1965 | Foundation of the Institute of Electronics\n\nA studio for producing electronic music was set up as early as 1965. In autumn 1971, the studio headed by Heinz Hönig was sufficiently well-equipped to allow the principal methods for performing electronic compositions to be demonstrated for teaching purposes. Today’s Institute for Electronic Music and Acoustics sees itself as an interface between science and art, between new technologies and musical practice.\n\n1967 | Establishment of the Institute for Performance Practice and Evaluation Research\n\nHeaded by Vera Schwarz, the main function of the Institute of Early Music and Performance Practice (as the academy’s institute of work practice is now known) is to research early music, along with its performance traditions and practices, and make it accessible. The Institute of Aesthetics of Music was founded as the Institute of Evaluation Research at the academy in May 1967 by Harald Kaufmann, who ran it until his death in July 1970. His research areas included studies analysing the value of bodies of works, value analysis of musical interpretations, music-psychological tests and cultural-political market research. Today the institute is devoted to questions of music aesthetics."
