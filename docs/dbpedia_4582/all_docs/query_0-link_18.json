Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum\n\n1824 — 1906\n\nBiographical Material & Chronology\n\nThis paragraph is taken from a letter written in June 1867 by the pastor of the evangelical church at Lengerich, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia. In response to a inquiry from the Fiegenbaum family in Madison County, Illinois, Rev. Kolemann (spelling?) had consulted the registers of the church to confirm the births of Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum and his brother, Friedrich Wilhelm Fiegenbaum.\n\nSource: Adam Miller, compiler, Experience of German Methodist Preachers, edited by D. W. Clark (Cincinnati: Methodist Book Concern, for the author, 1859); pages 275-278.\n\nThe role of itinerant missionaries in the family's life in Missouri is also described in a similar essay written by Wilhelm's brother, Heinrich Hermann Fiegenbaum, in an autobiographical sketch written by his sister, Marie Wilhelmine (Fiegenbaum) Winter, and in an article about the Fiegenbaums, published in the St. Louis Post Dispatch in 1898.\n\nAnother brother, Friedrich Wilhelm Fiegenbaum, wrote a less formal but more impassioned statement of his experiences as a pastor in the German Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nDalton, Mo.\n\nIm März 1847 kam Br. Wilhelm Fiegenbaum nach Brunswick, Mo., als erster Missionar, um die Deutschen aufzusuchen und ihnen das Evangelium zu predigen.

Brink & Company, 1882); pages 291-292.\n\nThis selection is from Chapter 14, \"Ecclesiastical History;\" from a section of the chapter entitled \"The German Methodist Episcopal Church,\" written by Rev. Wm. Schwind.\n\nNotes to Article on the German M. E. Church at Highland, Illinois\n\nThe German Methodist Church [at Wisetown, or Beaver Creek, Beaver Creek Precinct, Bond County, Illinois] was built in 1865, and cost about $1,400. The society was first organized in 1850.... The first minister was Rev. W. Fiegenbaum, who organized the church....\n\nSource: William Henry Perrin, History of Bond and Montgomery Counties, Illinois (Chicago, Illinois: O. L. Baskin, 1882); page 149.\n\nOn Wednesday, 4 June 1896, the annual meeting of the Old Settlers Union of Madison County was held at St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church at Edwardsville, Illinois. In the afternoon session of the gathering, some elderly members each spoke for about five minutes about their early experiences.\n\nRev. Wm. Fiegenbaum, who arrived in the county in 1834, told of the old market on the levee at the foot of Market street in St. Louis, and recited his pioneer experience as a Methodist preacher, one of his journeys being 245 miles to preach 16 times.\n\nSource: The Edwardsville Intelligencer (Edwardsville, Illinois); Friday, 6 June 1896, page page 4, columns 4 & 5.\n\nAlthough the account in the local newspaper reported that Rev. Fiegenbaum had arrived in the county in 1834, I believe this is not quite accurate. It appears to be true that his family did arrive in the U.S.A. in 1834, when Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum was 10 years old, but by all accounts they settled in eastern Missouri, very likely in the southern part of St. Charles County, not far from the village of Femme Osage. It was probably here that Wilhelm's parents converted to Methodism in 1844. He followed suit a few years later and in 1848 was appointed the first resident pastor at Highland, Madison County, Illinois. I think this was his earliest appearance in Illinois.\n\nRev. Fiegenbaum spent the rest of his adult life in service to the German Methodist Epicopal Church. Many of his early charges, whether as a regular pastor or a presiding elder, did involve condsiderable travel over large areas of the countryside.\n\nWilhelm Fiegenbaum, der im Alter von 82 Jahren als superannuiertes Mitglied der St. Louis Deutschen Konferenz seinen Lebensabend in Edwardsville, Ill., zubringt, teilt in einigen Zeilen Folgendes über seine Wirksamkeit in dem Gebiet unserer Konferenz mit: \"Die Chariton-Mission, später die Brunswick and Carrolton-Mission, wurde im März 1847 begonnen. Glasgow, Brunswick, Carrolton, sowie die Landsettlements in ihrer Nähe, wo Deutsche wohnten, wurden besucht. In 18 Monaten hatten sich etwa 65 Personen angeschlossen und in Brunswick und auf dem Lande bei Carrolton wurden Kirchen erbaut durch den 'jungen Kandidaten', wie Vater Köneke ihn nannte. Von September 1854 bis September 1856 war ich thätig als Vorstehender Aeltester des Missouri-Distrikts, der sich von Jefferson City bis hinauf durch Kansas und eine Ecke von Nebraska auf beiden Seiten des Missouri-Stromes erstreckte. In 1875 wurde ich nach Oregon, Mo., gesandt, welche Bestellung ich ein Jahr bediente.\"\n\nWilhelm Fiegenbaum, who at age 82 as a superannuated member of the St. Louis German Conference spends his evening years in Edwardsville, Ill. communicates in a few lines the following about his effectiveness in the area of our conference: \"The Chariton Mission, later the Brunswick and Carrolton Mission, was begun in March 1847. Glasgow, Brunswick, Carrolton, as well as German settlements in the area, were visited. In 18 months about 65 people joined the church and in Brunswick and the area around Carrolton churches were built by the 'young candidate,' as Father Köneke called him. From September 1854 to September 1856, I was active as the presiding elder of the Missouri District, which stretched from Jefferson City through Kansas and a corner of Nebraska along both sides of the Missouri River. In 1875, I was sent to Oregon, Mo., where I served for one year.\"\n\nNotes\n\nChronology\n\nTracking Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum and his family over the course of his career as a Methodist minister throughout the middle-western states is no easy task. Despite scattered references and sometimes contradictory accounts, the following chronology is emerging.\n\n19 December 1793\n\nHermann Wilhelm's father, Adolph Heinrich Fiegenbaum, was born at Ladbergen, Grafschaft Tecklenburg (County Tecklenburg) in northwestern Germany.\n\n5 March; about 1796\n\nHermann Wilhelm's mother, Christine Elisabeth Peterjohann, was born. This may have been at Lengerich, a village next door to Ladbergen. The exact year of birth is also not known; it was sometime between 1795 and 1797.\n\n25 October 1820\n\nAdolph Heinrich Fiegenbaum and Christine Elisabeth Peterjohann were married in the evangelical church at Ladbergen, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia (the shifting administrative geography of this time period is outline in the web page on Ladbergen.\n\n17 September 1824\n\nHermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum, Adolph and Christine's second child, was born at Lengerich, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia. 1 In his adult years he was commonly referred to by his second given name - Wilhelm or William. An older brother had been born in 1821 and three more brothers and a sister were born between 1827 and 1837.\n\n2 February 1826\n\nSophia Gusewelle, the eldest of eight children, was born at Polhagen, Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe.\n\n1834\n\nHermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum was 10 years old when his father (age 40), his mother (age 37), and four siblings (ages 13 years to about 9 months) emigrated from Lengerich, Kingdom of Prussia. In 1898, Wilhelm recalled the event:\n\nWhen our mother and father and their five children – Rudolph had not been born then – landed at New Orleans, we were penniless. Henry, the oldest, was 12 years old, and Minnie, the youngest, was only a baby\n\nThe family is reported to have disembarked at New Orleans, Louisiana in late June 1834 and to have traveled up the Mississippi by steamboat, arriving at St. Louis, Missouri about 3 or 4 July. They appear to have settled initially in Femme Osage Township, St. Charles County, Missouri. 2\n\n2 January 1837\n\nA brother, Heinrich Rudolph, was born in St. Charles County, Missouri. The birth and his baptism on 5 February 1837 were recorded in the baptismal register of the German evangelical church at Femme Osage, Missouri (founded in 1833 as the deutsche evangelische Kirchegemeinde and known since 1957 as Femme Osage United Church of Christ).\n\n2 April 1838\n\nIn St. Charles County Circuit Court, the father, Adolph Fiegenbaum declared his intention to become a citizen of the USA.\n\nJune 1840\n\nThe federal census of 1840 illustrates the difficulty of establishing where the Fiegenbaum-Peterjohann family resided during their early years in Missouri. The census provides the name of only the head of each household and then a count of the number of people of each sex in the household who fall into a range of ages. For example, the number of males less than 5 years of age; the number of males 5 years to less than 10 years of age; the number of males 10 years to less than 15 years of age; etc.\n\nThe census enumerated eight people living in the \"A. Frigenbottom\" household in Femme Osage Township, St. Charles County, Missouri.\n\nThe census also enumerated eight people living in the \"Rudolph Feigenbaum\" household in Charrette Township, Warren County, Missouri (in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article in 1898, Herman Wilhelm Fiegenbaum referred to his father as Rudolph).\n\nIn each enumeration, the total number of male and female members of the households was what would be expected based on information provided by other genealogical sources, but the distribution among age groups raises questions which have not yet been answered.\n\n1 October 1840\n\nAdolph obtained a federal land patent in St. Louis, Missouri for 40 acres of land in St. Charles County, east of the village of Femme Osage.\n\n1841\n\nThe extended family of one of Hermann Wilhelm's uncles (his father's elder brother), Johann Heinrich Fiegenbaum, numbering a group of at least 13 people, emigrated from Ladbergen, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia. They landed at Baltimore, Maryland on 28 June 1841 and settled in the area of Hopewell and Holstein, in neighboring Warren County, Missouri (see the passenger list of the bark, Leontine).\n\n1 August 1844\n\nHermann Wilhelm's father obtained a federal land patent in St. Louis, Missouri for 81.47 acres of land in the area of Hopewell and Holstein, in neighboring Warren County, where his uncle's family had settled.\n\n1844\n\nIn an article about the family in the St. Louis Post Dispatch in 1898, Hermann Wilhelm recalled: \"Mother had in former years admonished us against the doctrine of the Methodists, but this preacher changed her mind. She embraced the creed, as did all of us, in brief time. That was in 1844....\"\n\n1846 – 1848\n\nSophia Gusewelle emigrated to the USA sometime during this time; the exact time has not yet been determined.\n\n1847\n\nHermann Wilhelm was licensed as an exhorter in the German Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n1847 – 1848\n\nWilhelm served the new Chariton Mission which included Brunswick, Dalton, and Glasgow in Chariton County, and Carrollton in Carroll County, Missouri.\n\n1848\n\nHermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum was ordained in the German Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n1848 – 1850\n\nHermann Wilhelm was the first resident pastor at Highland, Madison County, Illinois.\n\nThe mission at that time already embraced a large territory and many appointments. It included Edwardsville, Fosterburg, Staunton, Looking Glass Prairie, Beaver Creek, Blackjack, Smooth Prairie, Silver Creek, Ridge Prairie, The Bluffs, Moro and Upper Alton. The membership in the whole field of labor numbered 67 at the time the church was dedicated [in June 1849]. Rev. Wm. Fiegenbaum was in charge of the mission with two assistant preachers. They were Rev. J. Keck and Rev. Herman Koch…. from the historical sketch, above.\n\n27 September 1849\n\nHermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum and Sophia Gusewelle were married at St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri.\n\n1850\n\nThe 1850 U.S. Census found Hermann Wilhelm's parents and two younger brothers living in Wapello Township, Louisa County, Iowa. According to the enumeration, the household was composed of Adolph (age 57), a farmer; Christine (age 54); Frederick (age 21), a day laborer; and, Rudolph (age 14).\n\nThe Fiegenbaum-Gusewelle household in this census had not yet been discovered.\n\n15 August 1851\n\nA son, Friedrich Adolph, was born at Watertown, Jefferson County, Wisconsin. 3 About one month later, on 14 September 1851, Friedrich was baptized in the German Methodist Church at Beardstown, Cass County, Illinois. This is perhaps some indication of how mobile was the life of a minister in the German Methodist Episcopal Church and, of course, his family.\n\n4 December 1854\n\nA son, Edward William, was born at Boonville, Cooper County, Missouri.\n\n1854 – 1856\n\nHermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum served as Presiding Elder of the \"Missouri District, which stretched from Jefferson City through Kansas and a corner of Nebraska along both sides of the Missouri River.\"\n\n1857\n\nA son, George, was born and died; further details of this child's brief life are currently unknown.\n\n27 April 1859\n\nTwins, a daughter, Amelia Bertha, and a son, Julius Henry, were born at Galena, Jo Daviess County, Illinois.\n\nAugust 1860\n\nThe Fiegenbaum-Gusewelle family appeared in the 1860 U.S. census living in Linton Township, Allamakee County, Iowa. According to the enumeration, the household consisted of Wm. Fiegenbaum (age 38), a M. E. Minister; Sophia Fiegenbaum (age 36), a housekeeper; F. A. Fiegenbaum (age 8), born in Wisconsin; Edward W. Fiegenbaum (age 6), born in Missouri; Henry [I or J]. Fiegenbaum (age 1), born in Illinois; Amelia B. Fiegenbaum (age 1), born in Illinois.\n\n3 September 1861\n\nA daughter, Martha Lizette, was born at St. Paul, Ramsey County, Minnesota.\n\n24 September 1863\n\nA daughter, Lydia Mary, was born in Minnesota.\n\n1865 – 1868\n\nHermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum served the church at Highland, Madison County, Illinois.\n\nabout 1866\n\nA daughter, Wilhelmine, was born in Minnesota. She died in infancy; details of her brief life are not currently known.\n\nJune 1870\n\nThe Fiegenbaum-Gusewelle family appeared in the 1870 U.S. census at Summerfield, St. Clair County, Illinois. According to the enumeration, the household consisted of Wm. \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 45), born in Prussia, a U.S. citizen, a minister; Sophia \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 44), born in Prussia, keeping house; F. Adolph \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 18), born in Wisconsin; Edward \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 15), born in Missouri; Bertha N. \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 11), born in Illinois; Julius H. \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 11), born in Illinois; Martha S. \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 8), born in \"Minasota.\"; Livia \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 6), born in \"Minasota.\"; Mina \"Feigenbaum;&quot (age 3), born in \"Minasota.\".\n\n1870 – 1875\n\nHermann Wilhelm was the \"pastor of the German Methodist Church in Edwardsville,\" Madison County, Illinois.\n\n12 March 1874\n\nSon Frederick Adolph Fiegenbaum and Amelia Maria Kriege were married in Madison County, Illinois.\n\n1875 – 1876\n\nHermann Wilhelm served for one year at Oregon, Holt County, Missouri.\n\nJune 1880\n\nThe Fiegenbaum-Gusewelle family appeared in the 1880 U.S. census living at Quincy, Adams County, Illinois. According to the 1880 enumeration of 12th Street (between Jefferson and Washington) the household consisted of William \"Tigenbaum,&quot (age 56), born in Prussia, a German Methodist Pastor; Sophia \"Tigenbaum,&quot (age 55), born in Prussia, keeping house; Bertha E. \"Tigenbaum,\", (age 21), born in Illinois, a salesmann [sic]; Julius H. \"Tigenbaum,\" (age 21), born in Illinois; Martha \"Tigenbaum,\", (age 18), born in Minnesota; Lydia M. \"Tigenbaum,\", (age 16), born in Minnesota.\n\n1882 – 1884\n\nHermann Wilhlem Fiegenbaum served as pastor at Highland, Madison County, Illinois.\n\n15 May 1882\n\nSon Edward William Fiegenbaum and Julia B. Gillespie were married in Madison County, Illinois.\n\n22 April 1884\n\nDaughter Amelia Bertha Fiegenbaum and Charles Frederic Blume were married at Galena, Jo Daviess County, Illinois. Charles, like his father-in-law, was a minister in the Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\n20 May 1884\n\nDaughter Martha Lizette Fiegenbaum and Clay Hardin Lynch were married at Edwardsville, Madison County, Illinois.\n\n1884 – 1887\n\nHermann Wilhlem Fiegenbaum served the German Methodist church at the Kettlekamp Settlement, on the South Fork of the Sangamon River, in Greenwood Township, Christian County, Illinois.\n\n9 November 1885\n\nDaughter Lydia Mary Fiegenbaum and Adolph Henry C. Jacoby were married in Christian County, Illinois.\n\n18 March 1886\n\nJulia B. (Gillespie) Fiegenbaum, wife of Edward William Fiegenbaum, died at Edwardsville, Madison County, Illinois. She was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery at Edwardsville.\n\n1887 – 1890\n\nHermann Wilhlem Fiegenbaum served the German Methodist church at Alton, Madison County, Illinois.\n\n11 September 1889\n\nSon Julius Henry Fiegenbaum and Sophie Elizabeth Pitts were married at Alton, Madison County, Illinois.\n\n11 June 1890\n\nSon Edward William Fiegenbaum and his second wife, Mary Emma Springer, were married in Madison County, Illinois.\n\n1890 – 1894\n\nHermann Wilhlem Fiegenbaum served the German Methodist church at Bunker Hill, Macoupin County, Illinois.\n\nabout 1893\n\nHermann Wilhlem Fiegenbaum retired as an active pastor. He and his wife were living at Edwardsville, Madison County, Illinois. However, one source recorded that \"superannuation\" took place in 1900.\n\n1895\n\nAmelia Maria (Kriege) Fiegenbaum, wife of Frederick Adolph Fiegenbaum, died at Edwardsville, Madison County, Illinois. She was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery at Edwardsville.\n\n1899\n\nRev. Hermann Wilhlem and Sophia (Gusewelle) Fiegenbaum celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary. There are conflicting reports of the exact date of the marriage. Obituaries for Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum and Sophia (Gusewelle) Fiegenbaum, as well as an 1899 newspaper account of their golden wedding anniversary, report that they were married at St. Louis on 27 September 1849. However, a marriage record filed and recorded at St. Louis certifies that Rev. Henry Könecke married them on 1 October 1849.\n\nJune 1900\n\nAccording to the 1900 enumeration, the household at Edwardsville, Illinois consisted of William Fiegenbaum, head of household, born September 1824 in Germany, age 75, married for 50 years, immigrated to USA in 1834, a \"Minister of the Gospel;\" and Sophia Fiegenbaum, wife, born February 1826 in Germany, age 74; married for 50 years, a mother of 8 children (6 of them still living), immigrated to USA in 1846.\n\n3 January 1903\n\nSon Frederick Adolph Fiegenbaum and his second wife, Mrs. Frederike (Ashauer) Figge, were married in Madison County, Illinois.\n\n7 September 1904\n\nSophia (Gusewelle) Fiegenbaum died at Edwardsville, Madison County, Illinois.
