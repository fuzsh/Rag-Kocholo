        "text": "Straub was founded on 12 May 1767 by 59 colonist families recruited by LeRoi & Pictet from Weilburg, Braunfels, Isenburg, and Hanau. It was located on the left bank of the Volga River about 55 kilometers south of Pokrovsk (Engels). It was named in honor of its first leader, Johann Heinrich Straub.\n\nStraub was plundered in 1774 by Pugachev and his followers.\n\nThe Volga German colonists were deported from Straub in 1941. The colony was relocated to higher ground in on the bluff above the Volga River in anticipation of the inundation of the Volga Reservoir that was created by the construction of the Volgograd Hydroelectric Power Station which was completed in 1961. The former location is now mostly on an island in the Volga River.\n\nMany of the buildings constructed by the Volga Germans were moved to the village's new location.\n\nWhat remains of the former Volga German colony of Straub, now in its new location, is known as Skatovka.\n\n- Beratz, Gottieb.
