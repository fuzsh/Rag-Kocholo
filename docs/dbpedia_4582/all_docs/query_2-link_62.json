        "text": "it has long been acknowledged of course that art and culture play a significant role in imagining communities, but the way they do so is more complex and nuanced than is often acknowledged. Too often, such connections are based on instrumental ‘readings’ of artworks that take paintings as (barely) coded illustrations or emblematic images of the imagined community in question. This minimises art’s visual qualities and aesthetic modes of operation in favour of pseudo-textual readings that see the works as mimetic or iconographic representations – mere channels for the production of images as ‘correlates of realities’ determined elsewhere. Alternately some scholars impose a historical determinism on art so that it seems as if what happened at that time and is represented or alluded to in the artworks must necessarily lead to what we (now) know came after. These approaches, not only overlook the aesthetic qualities of art, they also obscure the often more complex cultural politics at work. In this chapter, I seek to draw out this politics by looking more closely at the aesthetics of Friedrich’s work and analysing the ‘imaginary of connectivity’ that it presents. I show that, through his revolutionary landscape paintings, Friedrich offers an imaginary of connectivity that not only posits a novel space of governance but also subjects - and a subjectivity - of governance. Friedrich imagines a Germany as a territorially connected space but in a Liberal- Nationalist rather than a chauvinistically nationalist way. Moreover, the subjects he imagines are liberal subjects but they are communal, inter-connected rather than atomistic ones. I first introduce Friedrich’s work in the socio-political context of the time it was produced and briefly outline why his approach to landscape was considered so innovative. I then show how his art has often been reductively interpreted before offering an alternative reading by outlining the imaginary of connectivity he proposes. I do this first with regard to the connected space and then the connected subjects of governance he imagines. Finally, I conclude, that this interpretation amounts to a ‘Romanticisation’ of Friedrich and of Liberal Germany, which in keeping with the Romantic, liberal ideal, recovers (some of) their original meanings."
