        "text": "I. MUSIC IN SCHILLER’S LIFE\n\nThat music permeated the life of Friedrich Schiller is shown not only in his writings and letters but also in the reminiscences of his contemporaries, and to realize the extent of his knowledge of music and its personal significance to him is to realize its value in his literary and philosophical works. We should look, therefore, first at music in his life.\n\nSchiller was not born into a musical family. His father, a captain in the army of Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg, is not known to have had any inclination toward either music or literature. His mother, an innkeeper’s daughter, liked the ‘geistliche Lieder,’ or spiritual songs, by Klopstock, Gellert, and Uz, and it is significant that those who discuss this aspect of Schiller’s childhood mention the poets rather than the composers.1 Young Fritz, whose childhood ambition was to be a Lutheran minister, was more influenced by the words than the tunes, which were simple melodies in a folklike style rather than the sturdy Lutheran chorales of the Reformation or the arrangements of them by J. S. Bach. The organ improvisations which he heard in the church at Ludwigsburg were probably a stronger musical influence than the spiritual songs, for he later referred to the organ as the creator of an atmosphere of solemnity in Die Jungfrau von Orleans and his essay, ‘Über Anmut und Würde.’\n\nOpera, however, was the principal musical diet of his childhood and youth. Between 1753 and 1769 Karl Eugen and his musical director, Niccolò Jommelli, created one of the most magnificent musical establishments of the century and strove to obtain the finest singers, musicians, and dancers in Europe to satisfy Karl Eugen’s passion for music, which Burney described as being ‘as strong as that of the emperor Nero.’2 Jommelli’s operas demanded immense resources: for example, Vologese required, among other things, 24 councillors, 200 soldiers, 60 spectators, and 250 supers as ‘spectators’ in the amphitheatre.\n\nThe objections of the citizens of Stuttgart to the extravagance of Karl Eugen’s opera caused him to move his court to Ludwigsburg, while the opposition of the Württembergers increased to the point of formal complaints to the Imperial Diet. One aspect of public resistance was the refusal of the citizens to attend the opera; to counter this and to give the appearance of a full house and thus impress visiting dignitaries, Karl Eugen compelled his officers to dress in civilian clothes and attend the operatic performances, often with their families. Captain Schiller was evidently not exempted from this regulation, and thus both Fritz and his older sister Christophine were taken to the opera.\n\nAlthough Karl Eugen’s love for music began to cool in 1767 and Jommelli was released in 1769, the opera in Ludwigsburg was still magnificent enough to thrill the Schiller children. Christophine reminisced in 1845 that even though the operas were given in Italian, ‘the decorations and the splendid costumes were enough for us.’ The nine-year-old Fritz was impressed by the rapid changes of scenery, the animals on the stage, the grand entries, the dances, and the great singers accompanied by an excellent orchestra.3 The memories of the opere serie by Jommelli were to affect not only Schiller’s ideas on opera but also most of his dramas.\n\nMusic played an important role at the Karlsschule, founded by Karl Eugen in 1770 and to which Captain Schiller was forced to send his son. The orchestra and the opera gave frequent programs, and since all of the students were either on the stage or in the audience, young Schiller heard many of the finest operas of the time. He acted in the prologue to Sacchini’s Callirroë, the last major opera to be written for Karl Eugen, and in 1780 he took the title role in a production of Goethe’s drama Clavigo, which contains some incidental music. Although some symphonies and overtures by Handel, Haydn, the Mannheim composers, and either C. P. E. or J. C. Bach may have been performed by the orchestra, which was occasionally rehearsed personally by the Duke, the musical repertoire at the Karlsschule was almost exclusively Italian. Agostino Poli, who succeeded Boroni as musical director in 1775, was hostile to German music and restricted the operatic productions to Italian works and Singspiele written by students, but the nucleus of the school’s musical library consisted of Jommelli’s operas.\n\nSchiller’s first surviving dramatic attempt, Semele, is in the style of a libretto for an opera seria. Written in 1779, it was first published as a ‘lyrical operetta’ in his Anthologie für das Jahr 1782. Semele is merely an attempt at opera, for there are no indications in the text for the placement of recitatives, arias, or ensembles; where music is specified, the designations are indistinguishable from the requirements for incidental music in the spoken drama. The demands on the stage manager resemble the extravagances of Baroque machine opera, and Schiller’s friend Streicher commented that Semele was such a grandiose conception that all of the mechanical arts of the theatre would be insufficient for its staging.4 Thus during Schiller’s lifetime Semele was never set to music (although in 1900 an unsuccessful attempt was made in Berlin to put music from Handel’s Semele to this drama), and the poet later repudiated this work with the remark: ‘The mention of Semele ordinarily frightens me. May Apollo and his nine muses forgive me for sinning so grievously against them.’5\n\nAfter his graduation from the Karlsschule Schiller was extremely unhappy with his garrison duties as a regimental surgeon, which were not onerous but boring and poorly remunerated. He spent most of his spare time in revising Die Räuber, begun during his student days, and in writing the poems later to be published in the Anthologie für das Jahr 1782, but he found occasion to meet his musical friends from among his classmates at the Karlsschule, especially a convivial drinking companion named Johann Rudolf Zumsteeg, the first composer to set his works to music. Schiller’s circle of musical acquaintances was soon widened by two clavier players, Luise Dorothea Vischer and Andreas Streicher.\n\nLuise Vischer, the ‘Laura’ of the love poems in the Anthologie, attracted Schiller although she was eight years his senior and a widow with two children. Christophine described her as a thin blonde with watery blue eyes. The poem ‘Laura am Klavier’ has raised questions concerning Frau Vischer’s musicality: Minna Körner remembered Schiller’s describing her playing ‘gut Klavier’ and making an excellent glass of punch, whereas Scherrl stated that she was ‘slightly musical.’6\n\nParzeller has stated that the music of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach inspired ‘Laura am Klavier,’7 and it is most likely that Schiller became acquainted with this composer’s music through his friendship with Andreas Streicher, who saw him at a public examination at the Karlsschule and was later introduced to him by Zumsteeg. Streicher and Schiller soon became close friends because of their many common interests; Streicher found that his views, especially on poetry and music, were ‘completely new, unusual, convincing, and natural in the highest degree.’8\n\nTheir friendship was soon put to a strong test when Schiller decided to escape from Stuttgart. Karl Eugen had noticed him adversely even during his student days,8a and the events which arose from the first performance and publication of Die Räuber were climactic: he was summoned before the Duke, called ‘Er,’ and forbidden to publish anything but medical articles or to correspond with persons outside of Württemberg. Because he subsequently absented himself without leave to attend a performance of his drama in Mannheim, Karl Eugen placed him under house arrest.\n\nPunished, disappointed, and bored, the poet decided to escape the stultifying atmosphere of Stuttgart; after confiding in Streicher, who promised his assistance, the two friends left Stuttgart on the night of 22 September 1782, with two trunks and a clavichord packed in the coach which took them to Mannheim. During his first stay in Mannheim he remained indoors, revising Fiesko after its rejection by the Nationaltheater, and hiding for fear of being kidnapped and returned as a military prisoner to Stuttgart. A welcome diversion from arduous labor, disappointment, and fear was provided by Streicher’s clavichord playing, the effect of which on Schiller he later described as follows:\n\nEven in Stuttgart sad or lively music took him outside himself and appropriate clavier playing aroused all emotions in him. At the noon meal he would ask [me] to play for him that evening. At twilight [I] would play while Schiller walked up and down in a room frequently illuminated only by moonlight, and would break out into unintelligible, animated speech.9\n\nWhile stranded in Worms by snow and cold Schiller, Streicher, and some friends attended a performance of Georg Benda’s melodrama Ariadne auf Naxos. Although the quality of the performance was ‘ridiculous,’ Schiller was highly impressed with what to him was a novel form of dramatic music, watched the performance with ‘earnest, deep gaze,’ was ‘completely lost in it as if he had never seen anything similar or would be seeing it for the last time,’ and refused to join his friends in making fun of the performance.10\n\nIn 1783 the two friends were parted – Streicher to stay in Mannheim to study with one of the musicians who still remained after the glorious orchestra had been dissolved in 1778, Schiller to move to Bauerbach where he could work undisturbed either by financial worries or threats from Karl Eugen. In a parting letter Schiller gave his friend some valuable advice:\n\nYou are young, far enough along in your art in order to be useful. Study under a master in a large city in which you know there is much activity, avoid becoming mechanical in your art, make yourself useful [to your teacher] and find first of all the opportunity to study the man, earn a living, and when you leave [get] a recommendation. The great Titian ground colors for Raphael. This was by no means a disgrace; it gave his name the greater honor.11\n\nAt the end of July 1783 Schiller returned to Mannheim to accept a contract offered by Count Dalberg, the Intendant of the theatre, for the production of Fiesko and Kabale und Liebe, but after the latter drama was produced his contract was not renewed. In May Schiller wrote Henriette von Wolzogen, his hostess at Bauerbach, that he had received four letters from Leipzig, one of which contained a setting of the song ‘Schön wie Engel’ from Die Räuber, ‘something that would be agreeable to me.’ The letters were from Ferdinand Huber; Dora Stock, who made a celebrated drawing of Mozart when he visited Dresden in 1789; her sister Minna; and Minna’s fiancé, Christian Gottfried Körner, who was to exercise a strong influence on the development of Schiller’s musical and aesthetic ideas.\n\nBecause his prospects for future advancement in Mannheim were dim, Schiller left on 9 April 1785. The cordial tone of the letters from his new friends implied that he would be warmly welcomed and influenced his decision to move to Saxony. He announced his impending arrival with a discussion of his drama in progress, Don Carlos, and how ‘in your circle I will play more happily and more intimately on my lute.’13\n\nHe found his new friends in Leipzig, and subsequently Dresden, altogether delightful. Staying at Körner’s home was a pleasure, for Schiller noticed that ‘today on waking I heard the piano being played above me; you cannot believe how it cheered me.’14 The concerts and social gatherings at which music was informally performed also pleased him. The Leipzig bookseller Göschen recalled how two theology students would frequently make music and that Schiller would participate, ‘though probably just as a listener.’ Luise Pistorius met Schiller in Dresden, where he invited her and her father, the bookseller Schwan who had previously befriended him in Mannheim, to a concert at which the Körners sang, and Luise saw Schiller for the last time at a concert in Körner’s home.15 The leading musical personages to whom he was introduced were Johann Gottfried Naumann, the musical director in Dresden who wrote Italianate operas and is said to have composed the ‘Dresden Amen,’ and Johann Adam Hiller, the composer of many Singspiele.\n\nSince life in Dresden was enjoyable (at least from a musical standpoint) but unremunerative, Schiller moved in July of 1787 to Weimar, a step which his brother-in-law Reinwald and Schwan had urged him to take as early as 1783. He was already known there through his earlier dramas, his novel Der Geisterseher, and subsequently his historical studies, which were to earn him a professorship at the University of Jena two years later; furthermore, he had read the first act of Don Carlos to the Duke, Karl August, on Christmas of 1784. The warm reception he received in Weimar during his first visit in July 1787 induced him to stay; here and at Jena he was to spend the rest of his life, except for occasional excursions.\n\nWeimar was the seat of letters and philosophy in Germany during the last quarter of the eighteenth century, much as the Vienna of Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven was the city for music. Not even London or Paris could boast such a constellation of geniuses as Schiller, Goethe, Herder, and Wieland. The concept of general intellectual culture held by these men affected not only Germany but also the world: the ideas of Bildung and Kultur, with Weimar as their source, were transmitted to Western Europe and America by Benjamin Constant, Mme. de Staël, Coleridge, Carlyle, and Emerson.\n\nDespite its high intellectual tone, Weimar was not a musical centre until Liszt came there in 1848. In the early years of the eighteenth century J. S. Bach had been court organist and Kammermusikus there from 1708 to 1717 but was only too glad to leave for Kothen. Weimar’s musical life was stagnant during most of the century, for the Duchy had suffered during the Seven Years’ War, and largely on that account a complete musical establishment was impossible. From the mid-1750s to around 1770 Weimar could support only a wind ensemble (Harmoniemusik), the typical music of the impecunious court. Strings were added to this group around 1770, but even in 1783 there were only a dozen players in the orchestra; though the orchestra at the end of the century was medium-sized by the standards of the time, it had to be reinforced with military bandsmen, students, and Stadtmusikanten.\n\nBefore 1783, musical drama in Weimar consisted of amateur theatricals managed by Goethe in which Corona Schröter, who came as court singer in 1776, was the only professional; but by 1783 Bellomo’s troupe of actors and singers became semi-permanent residents of Weimar, giving the duchy a repertoire consisting mostly of Italian opere buffe and the lighter Singspiele, although they performed Mozart’s Die Entführung aus dem Serail in 1785. Goethe assumed the direction of the court theatre in 1791, retaining many of Bellomo’s singers, adding new ones, and markedly raising the dramatic and musical standards of performance and repertoire.\n\nUnfortunately the musical directors in Weimar were undistinguished even by the standards of the time. Ernst Wilhelm Wolf, František Benda’s son-in-law, came in 1761 as musical director and died in 1792. He was followed by Johann Friedrich Kranz, who had come to Weimar in 1766, left to study in 1781, and returned in 1789 as concertmaster of the court orchestra and musical director of Bellomo’s theatre; subsequently he was made conductor of the court opera in 1792 and Kapellmeister in 1799. Whether he was the ‘Cranz’ who was studying violin with Ignaz Fränzl and composition with Holzbauer when Schiller met him in Mannheim is unknown, and Schiller virtually ignored the man after showing initial interest in him. After Kranz left Weimar in 1803, he was succeeded by Franz Seraph von Destouches, who wrote most of the music for the Weimar performances of Schiller’s later dramas. Not until Johann Nepomuk Hummel came in 1819 did a composer of stature settle in Weimar. At times a few visiting virtuosi came through and gave concerts, among them Ferdinand Fränzl; Ferdinand Eck (subsequently Spohr’s violin teacher), whom Schiller recommended to Körner;16 and the Pixis brothers; Karl Stamitz lived and taught for a short time in Jena; but because of the limited opportunities famous performers did not settle in Weimar, thus forcing the lovers of instrumental music to settle for concerts of Harmoniemusik or a clarinet concerto played by Destouches.\n\nOn the other hand, there was a lively ‘do-it-yourself interest in Hausmusik, amateur performing of technically easy literature, which one must understand, according to one of Schiller’s leading biographers, fully to appreciate the domestic culture in Germany at the end of the eighteenth and the beginning of the nineteenth centuries.17 Many of the members of the court circle in Weimar played instruments or sang, and Duchess Anna Amalia and Count von Seckendorff even composed music.\n\nThe musical activities of many of the important figures in Weimar remains to be fully investigated. Wieland is said to have had a lively feeling for music, but a study of his relationship to this art remains to be written. Although much has been written about Goethe’s relationship to music, Herder had more knowledge of this art, and his musical activities included working with J. C. F. Bach at Bückeburg and translating the texts of Handel’s Messiah and Alexander’s Feast for performances in Weimar in 1780, yet only recently have scholars begun systematically to investigate the many contributions which this versatile man made to the philosophy and aesthetics of music. The dowager duchess Anna Amalia, who presided over musical life in Weimar, displayed considerable skill in composing and appreciating music, for she wrote songs for Goethe’s Singspiele and treasured in her library the autograph finale of Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice and the manuscript of Mozart’s K. 450 piano concerto.\n\nThe Schlick family and Corona Schröter were among Schiller’s first musical friends in Weimar. He enjoyed visiting Kammerherr von Einsiedel because ‘in [his] house I can hear music; a certain Schlick comes and goes.’ The Schlicks must have been famous, for Schiller wrote Körner that he probably knew them by reputation: ‘he plays the cello excellently and [his wife] the violin.’18\n\nCorona Schröter, as a professional among amateurs, made many important contributions to Weimar’s musical life, among them singing the soprano solos in Herder’s productions of Handel’s oratorios and in Goethe’s Singspiele. Her settings of some of Goethe’s poems are quite charming considering their brevity and scope. After the court theatre was placed on a permanent basis in 1791 she retired from active singing and devoted herself mainly to training the young actors and coaching the singers. Schiller accompanied her to social gatherings and even played whist with her, but although she was quite impressed with him, he had initial reservations about her intellectual qualities:\n\nThe exaggerated admiration of good minds has given her a better impression of herself than she would have pretended to, as she can maintain her self-confidence. I believe her proper merit is to oversee a household; to me she seems to have contentedly insipid ideas about art. Moreover, one is good and comfortable in her company, but goes away from her quiet and empty.19\n\nYet these initial opinions did not hinder a warmly cordial relationship. Two months later Schiller wrote that he was on the ‘most charming terms’ with her and that ‘she has recently made me a present of her songs [probably the ‘Fünf und Zwanzig Lieder’ of 1786] and I of Don Carlos to her.’20\n\nDuring Schiller’s stay in Weimar two formal musical events customarily took place: a Sunday afternoon reception open to the nobility, followed by a concert and cards, and Anna Amalia’s concert on Wednesday afternoons. During his first visit to Weimar the Duchess invited Schiller to attend a performance of one of her Singspiele, but Charlotte von Lengefeld (later his wife) advised him not to go because he had not received a formal invitation; Gotter later told him that he had behaved badly by not going. We know that Anna Amalia repeated the invitation, for Schiller wrote: ‘This morning I have again received an invitation to tea, a concert, and supper with the Duchess.’ He was not highly impressed with her:\n\nShe herself has not captivated me … Her spirit is extremely narrow-minded, nothing interests her unless it is connected with sensual things; this [affects her] taste for music and painting and the like. She is herself a composer; Goethe’s Erwin und Elmire has been set by her.21\n\nJena, where Schiller was professor of history from 1789 until his illness in 1791, boasted considerable musical activity. The University supported an active Collegium Musicum, an orchestra in which musically inclined students participated; although none of the programs given by this group before 1817 have been preserved, one can reasonably conjecture that the works of the composers of the Berlin and Mannheim symphonic schools and Haydn provided most of the repertoire. That good local composers were active there is shown by the so-called ‘Jena’ symphony by Friedrich Witt which was attributed to Beethoven for several years. In 1804 Jena was said to have been second only to Leipzig in having the best University music in Germany. No record exists of Schiller’s having attended any University concerts, but the students customarily serenaded with music and Schiller was thus greeted after his famous inaugural lecture.\n\nSeveral of his colleagues and friends there were musical. He frequently attended concerts at Hufeland’s home and heard Don Giovanni sung there.22 After he became ill, he was visited by J. B. Erhard, who impressed him not only with his breadth of learning and many talents but also his musicality. Anton Thibaut, the connoisseur of sixteenth-century music who was later to contribute markedly to the reform of Catholic church music through his book Über Reinheit der Tonkunst, taught in Jena between 1800 and 1805; Schiller knew him, received visits from him, and was disappointed when he left Jena, but there is no account of their holding conversations about music.\n\nSchiller’s wife provided throughout his career his most intimate musical experiences. When he met Charlotte von Lengefeld and her married sister Karoline von Beulwitz in December of 1787 in Rudolstadt, he was delighted: ‘They play the piano well, which made a lovely evening for me.’23 With his fortunes improved by his professorship at Jena and an annual stipend from the Duke, and with Karoline’s subtle urgings, he proposed marriage, was accepted, and was wed to Charlotte in Wenigenjena on 22 February 1790.\n\n‘Next week Lolo will start piano and voice study,’ Schiller wrote in describing how his new bride was planning to improve her musical proficiency.24 A charming account by the Danish poet Jens Baggessen shows how Charlotte used music to distract her husband from the pain of a toothache:\n\nI noticed that he was suffering and requested him to take care of himself when his wife sat down at the piano to let [my wife] hear what she had recently learned. At this opportunity we talked about music, of which Schiller understood nothing at all but, as he said to me, had an extraordinary love for it.25\n\nCharlotte’s musical skill must have declined after the birth of her first child, for five years after the wedding Schiller wrote that he had no usable piano in his home in Jena and that no one there could perform, although Lotte did own a mandolin. Her singing had also languished, for Schiller wrote Körner to thank him for a group of songs: ‘I would be able to enjoy them fully if I could find someone who sings very well,’ and later, ‘As much as our ladies like to sing, they understand so little music.’26 Yet a piano must have been acquired between 1795 and 1800, for Lotte’s cousin Christiane von Wurmb said that a piano, which Amy Fay called a ‘tiny little piano’ during her visit to Weimar in 1871, was situated in a room adjoining Schiller’s study.27\n\nKaroline von Beulwitz (later von Wolzogen), apparently more musical or at least more articulate about music than her sister Charlotte, puts in her biography of Schiller much information about his musical preferences. Music was an important aid to his creative imagination:\n\nSchiller loved music very much and liked to have it in an adjoining room when he walked up and down in his study and gave himself up to a poetic mood. This influenced my sister to take further instruction in piano playing. The song by Gluck, “Einen Bach, der fliesst,” gave Schiller the most agreeable fantasies.*\n\nShe further commented that ‘Music … affected him mysteriously; he had never practiced it, but he said that it agreeably affected his poetic moods.’28 Charlotte later remembered his fondness for vocal music:\n\nKaroline’s [Schiller’s daughter] voice is so lovely and touching that I often think how her dear father would have been inspired to many noble, beautiful, and elevated thoughts if he could have heard his daughter’s voice. During his work he loved to hear song from a distance.29\n\nMusic played a part in the intimate pictures of Schiller en pantoufles: listening to music while sitting under the trees and drinking beer during his convalescence in Karlsbad, having a guitar made for Körner (his son Theodor, the poet, took this instrument into battle in 1813 where he was killed), or enjoying a serenade given him by students from the University of Halle; the musicians who accompanied the students, when asked to play the melodies of Schiller’s songs, knew only ‘An die Freude’ and thus played this one piece repeatedly.30\n\nChristiane von Wurmb often sang and played for Schiller during her visit to Weimar. Frequently she would sit in a room adjoining Schiller’s study and play Lotte’s piano when he called out ‘Einen Marsch, Christel! Einen Marsch!’31 In her reminiscences of her stay in Weimar she mentioned some of the poet’s excellent advice to her; when she expressed the desire to sing like her teacher Karoline Jagemann, he said:\n\nThe admiration of an art, talent, or what it may be, generally leads to the fine wish also to possess it. Through good training this feeling is surely a great means of elevating human powers to perfection.\n\nAnd when she later told him that she was afraid to sing in public in Rudolstadt, he gently replied in words that every aspiring musician should know:\n\nSerious good will is a great, the most beautiful characteristic quality of the spirit. Success is bestowed by a higher, invisible hand. Only the intention gives worth to the expenditure of powers. Thus we raise ourselves above the praise and blame of men.32\n\nWhen Christel left for Berlin, Schiller warmly recommended her to Zelter.\n\nKaroline von Wolzogen gives the last account of Schiller’s love of music:\n\nA few weeks before his last illness he heard Mlle. Schmalz sing at my home; her soulful singing moved him deeply. She sang the lovely aria from Zingarelli’s Romeo e Giulietta, Ombra adorata aspetta,’ and Schiller said to me, ‘never has a song touched me in this manner.’ It seemed as if [his approaching death] had sharpened all the senses of his spirit and feelings.33\n\nMozart’s Requiem was performed at Schiller’s funeral in 1805.34\n\nA little-known aspect of Schiller’s relationship with music was his attitude toward writing opera librettos. Semele, as we have seen, was intended as an opera but its author later repudiated it. Although opera as an art-form repelled him between 1784 and 1796, and throughout his career he rebuffed composers who sought librettos from him, he made three dramatic sketches which can be considered at least potential librettos.\n\nAll the information we have about the earliest of these is a letter to Huber in 1786 in which Schiller remarked that he had written two arias and a trio and had given them to a composer whose name he did not mention:\n\nI hope, and this is my blessed conviction, that the music will turn out a bit worse than the arias, and these are certainly bad. In the meantime there is an opera under my wig, and I am doing it with the intention of – scribbling in order to learn.35\n\nThough not interested in writing operas himself, Körner repeatedly sought to interest Schiller in collaborating with distinguished composers. His first venture, in 1787, was to have the poet write a libretto for Naumann:\n\nNaumann spoke to me again about an opera which you are going to do for him. In the autumn he is going to Berlin and intends to discuss a national opera with the King. He will summon all his powers to give the music a proper character which will be distinguished through truth and dignity. For him, Klopstock’s plays are too sterile for the theatre. From you he expects more knowledge of the theatre, less crudeness in the versification, and similar terseness in the dialogue. He spoke with spirit and dignity on the matter, so that he stands very high in my favor. What do you say to this idea?\n\nSchiller was also invited to come to Dresden during the summer to discuss the project personally with Naumann, but nothing further happened.36\n\nAlso in 1787 Schiller became interested in Wieland’s Oberon and considered it ‘a splendid subject for music.’ He hoped that Kranz, who had just returned from his studies, would be a suitable composer and planned to give him the libretto. Körner dissuaded him from this project with the words ‘Why not find a subject yourself?’ and stated that he would be better able to create an effectively unified dramatic work if he did not have to work out single pieces under a musician’s guidance. Naumann was again suggested as a composer.37\n\nTwo possible attempts at opera by Schiller can be dated from the late 1790s. A sketch for one on the Orpheus legend is apparently based on the second act of Calzabigi’s libretto for Gluck’s Orfeo ed Euridice. The principal departure from this model was Schiller’s having Orpheus sing a ‘Hymn to Life’ before the spirits in Hades. All that remains of the hymn are notes made for the topics of the first three stanzas.\n\nStorz states that the sketch for Rosamund oder die Braut der Höhle was an operatic attempt and that two versions may have been intended, one for the stage and one for the opera house. He also believes that Schiller was approaching Romantic opera, especially Mozart’s Die Zauberflöte;38 this is most evident in Schiller’s directions for the décor of the finale, which includes wild animals, columns, harpies, birds, temples, gardens, palaces, and ghosts. The closest specific connection with opera in Rosamund is Schiller’s note about ‘through what means Rosamund’s role can win favor. As a singer it can happen only through song, as an actress — …’39 All else that exists of the abortive Rosamund is an incomplete ballad with several stanzas missing.\n\nZumsteeg hoped to induce Schiller to write a libretto for him. In a rather pathetic letter he appealed to his old school friend: ‘My most ardent wish is still to receive an opera from you. Is this [wish] never to be satisfied?’ Zumsteeg offered him the choice of plot and its realization, but preferred something ‘heroisch-komisch;’ the only essential requirement was two finales. Zumsteeg closed his letter by asking: ‘Perhaps you would do something sooner for your friend than for the composer,’ and mentioned the success of his opera Die Geisterinsel to prove that he was skilled in this kind of composition.40 Since none of the letters Schiller wrote to Zumsteeg after 1794 have been preserved, we have no way of knowing how this request was declined.\n\nIn 1801 Körner made a last attempt to interest Schiller in opera by sending him a sketch of Alfred, the music to which was to be a series of ‘musical paintings’ and written by a new arrival in Dresden, ‘a not unskilled composer, [Ferdinando] Paër, who must write two operas a year.’ Schiller suggested that Kotzebue write the libretto but doubted that it would be effective, and Körner did not relish the idea of collaborating with him.41\n\nProbably as an emissary from Bernhard Anselm Weber, the music student Schlömilch came to Weimar from Berlin in 1803 to inquire about Schiller’s interest in writing an opera libretto but was rebuffed: ‘This is not my field; go to Kotzebue or Goethe,’ and in the following year Weber’s personal request for a libretto was refused.42\n\nSchiller stated the real reason for refusing to become an opera librettist in a letter to Goethe about the latter’s sketches for a sequel to Die Zauberflöte:\n\nIf you do not have a very skillful and popular composer … I fear that you are putting yourself in danger of having an ungrateful audience, for in the performance itself no libretto will redeem an opera if the music is not successful; frequently the poet is also blamed for the failure.43\n\nAnd this is further confirmed in a letter to Iffland shortly after Schiller rejected Weber’s offer of collaboration on an opera:\n\n[The secretary of the theatre directorate in Berlin] has spoken to me about a grand opera. For a long time I have also had a desire for such an undertaking, but if on my part I break my head to do the right thing, I would also like to be certain that the composer is competent. A tragedy can amount to something independent of the talent of the actor; an opera is nothing if it is not played or sung.44\n\nSchiller refused to write a libretto because he evidently was not satisfied with the operatic abilities of any of the composers whom he knew, even one with an international reputation like Naumann. He may also have been influenced by the fate of Goethe’s Singspiele which had been set to music by such amateur composers as Duchess Anna Amalia and Kammerherr von Seckendorff, and thus enjoyed from a musical standpoint a renown restricted to the environs of Weimar. Between the death of Mozart and the later works of Carl Maria von Weber German opera (with the sole exception of Fidelio by Beethoven which was chiefly influenced by French models) was in a state of stagnation, with its leading composers merely minor figures. The centre of operatic gravity had shifted to France with the ‘rescue operas’ of Grétry, Cherubini, Dalayrac, Lesueur, and Méhul, any of whom in their better moments would have written music which could have complemented Schiller’s inspiration, for their music, which derived from Gluck and the musical Sturm und Drang, shares the elevation, the attempts at the sublime, and even the occasional elements of bombast in Schiller’s poetic language. Unfortunately Schiller knew Dalayrac and Grétry only by their lighter opéras comiques, probably never heard any rescue operas with the possible exception of Cherubini’s Les deux journées, and although his dramas were known in France since the first performance of Die Räuber in Paris in 1792, there is no record of his having been approached by any French composer. Schiller’s influence on the opera libretto was not felt until the nineteenth century.\n\nWe know that Schiller never played a musical instrument, although he enjoyed instrumental music and knew how instruments were built. Whether he ever sang, however, has been a topic for controversy since his death. The dispute was opened immediately after his demise by C. W. Oemler, who quoted Charlotte as having said that he ‘sang, after a long pause, [a] verse from Klopstock’s ode … with a tone that made my inmost soul tremble.’ Schiller’s brother-in-law Reinwald scornfully attacked this statement two years later:\n\nSchiller never sang, at least not in his later life, in any case not as late as Klopstock’s death [1803]. He had no voice, he lacked the ability to control his voice, and absolutely in his later years his chest was so weak that only with great difficulty could he declaim his own verses, and he is said to have sung so that he moved the listener! This is quite a joke!\n\nAnd Charlotte remarked on another occasion that her husband never sang.45\n\nMany of those who knew Schiller gave accounts of the difficulty he had with his speaking voice. Friedrich Scharffenstein remembered that at the Karlsschule his voice was ‘shrill and disagreeable’ and that he could not control it; this would have prevented his becoming even a ‘tolerable actor.’ Baggessen stated that in 1790 Schiller had to hold a handkerchief over his mouth and could speak only with difficulty. Such words as ‘weak, unmanly, almost quavering,’ and ‘dull’ are found in comments on Schiller’s voice after his illness forced him to give up lecturing in public.46 His problems in speaking would have been considerably multiplied in singing.\n\nOn the other hand Johann Heinrich Voss the younger, a close friend of Schiller’s whose remarks can be considered reliable, gave an eyewitness account of his singing:\n\nWe sat in the corner close to the room where the faro bank was located and caroused. We drank his health aloud and clinked glasses. Schiller was so animated that he struck up his ‘So leben wir,’ at which some students who were present were highly astonished. Afterwards four or five of us joined in another song and altogether we drank eleven bottles of champagne.47\n\nIf Schiller did sing at all, it must have been at the expense of considerable physical effort and even discomfort, took place only at moments of strong emotional stress or well-lubricated conviviality, and was so rare as to arouse astonishment and to make a lasting impression on those who were present, but his singing could not have been a significant aesthetic experience.\n\nSchiller was one of the first intellectual leaders whose musical tastes were based on personal feelings and abstract judgments rather than on experience as a performer of music or as a student of the technical and theoretical side of this art. In the various communities where he lived, their days of musical glory had passed (Ludwigsburg, Stuttgart, Leipzig, Dresden) or their musical horizons were restricted and provincial (Bauerbach, Jena, Weimar). His musical pilgrimage was nevertheless an orderly process, displaying his development from his childhood when he was impressed with operatic spectacle, through his young manhood when he was hypnotized by dreamy clavier playing, to his maturity when music played an important part in his daily life and he made significant use of this art in his dramas, poems, and philosophical essays."
