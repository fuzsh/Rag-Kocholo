        "text": "\"Nun kommt die Schillerzeit!\"\n\nSchillers Youth\n\nThe Romantic School\n\nResistance to Autocracy\n\nThe Literary Rebel\n\nRepublican in Exile\n\nThe Elusive Cultural Icon\n\nStorm Clouds on the Horizon\n\nBy 1788, however, storm clouds had already gathered over Europe, with major convulsions about to hit France that would have serious repercussions throughout the Continent, not least in the nearby states of Germany. Schiller was a keen observer of events occurring across the border. Writing to Körner, he said, If you dont read the Moniteur, I would highly recommend that you do so. There you have before you all the details of the negotiations in the National Assembly, and can observe the French with their weaknesses and their strengths. But he was fast losing hope of any positive outcome of this revolution. In a letter to Körner on September 1787, he wrote: [August] Bode has brought back a rather dire picture of Paris. The nation has lost all its energy and at a rapid pace approaches its destruction. The convocation of the Notables itself was only a trick by the Government. Had they been convened five years earlier, it would have provided a counterweight. But five years later, theres no chance. Parliament has no significance. Its sole activity consists in school exercises, which they engage in and are quite happy when they go well, just like school boys. The Stamp Act is a measure that must find 1,000 obstacles in its implementations. In Paris, Beaumarchais is held in contempt by the better people.\n\nHe corresponded regularly with friends in France who were able to give him an on-the-ground reading of events, and they were not encouraging to one who had hoped that the raising of the banner of liberté would lead to the opening of a new era of Reason. Reports from his friend Wilhelm von Wolzogen, in Paris to study architecture, while cautiously optimistic, portrayed a dire situation. In a letter to Charlotte in November 1788, Schiller expressed his own profound skepticism over events in France: Wolzogens estimate of Paris under present circumstances couldnt be otherwise. The object is still of such a magnitude for him, his inner sense has yet to adjust to it. He has brought a yardstick in order to measure a colossus. I certainly believe that he may, after a longer stay in Paris, ultimately come to the exact same conclusions, but he will do so from completely different motives and from anoth er standpoint. Whoever has a sense and an instinct for the great world of mankind must certainly be plunged into this wide, grandiose element; how small and insignificant our own civic and political conditions are in compari son. Mankind, when it is united, is always a grand being, however small the individuals or the details may appear to the eye. And even because of this it seems to me to be of import that each detail and every individual be viewed from the standpoint of the whole of which it is a part or, what is the same thing, to view it with a philosophical spirit. In com ments to his sister-in-law Caroline, who had\n\nremarked on some of the beautiful speeches given in the National Assembly, Schiller said: It is impossible that anything reasonable can come out of a gathering of six hundred people.\n\nWhen the Bastille fell in July 1789, there was some joy expressed among Schillers circle of friends. Caroline wrote: An acquaintance read to us with enthusiasm about the storming of the Bastille. We often remembered later, that when these conditions of tumult and turbulence were being followed closely by all of Europe, revolution inserted itself into everyones life, as the crumbling of this monument to a sinister despotism appeared to our young eyes as a prelude to the victory of freedom over tyranny, and we were joyful that it occurred at the beginning of a beautiful relationship of the heart for us.\n\nOthers, including Schiller and Körners mutual friend Ludwig Huber (later the editor of the Allgemeine Zeitung, which was owned by Schillers publisher Johann Friedrich Cotta), also waxed enthusiastic. In a letter to Körner dated July 23, 1789, Huber wrote: I dont believe that we could experience a more interesting time than the present, and I will no longer forgive the anti-Gallicans, if they maintain their contempt for this nation. A recent addition to Schillers circle, who became a great friend and patron, and would later play a key role during the War of Liberation, the prelate Karl Theodor Dalberg, was much more skeptical. He urged much caution with their enthusiasm for the events of France. Kids, he told them, dont be so certain that this will unfold well. Many a storm can disrupt everything. Körner, as well as Schiller, was also skeptical about any good coming out of this revolution. What do you think about the latest events in France? Now nothing is impossible there, and I wouldnt be surprised if France gets carved up into several smaller republics, Schiller wrote to Körner. With the increasing atrocities carried out by the British-manipulated revolutionaries, Schillers skepticism was soon transformed into a feeling of horror. In a letter to the Lengefeld sisters on Oct. 30, 1789, he wrote: Schulz observed the King on the occasion when he was to put on the cockade [symbol of Revolutionary FranceWJ]. He held it in one hand and had the other in his vest, clutching his hat under his arm. When suddenly there was applause, and he thought that he had to clap with them, but he didnt know what to do since both hands were full. At once he made a decision, took the cockade in his mouth, and applauded heartily. Isnt that a noble presence of mind for a King of France?\n\nLater, in 1792, when Louis XVI stood under threat of execution, Schiller, the staunch republicanwho ironically would be granted citizenship by the new French Republic later that yearconsidered writing on his behalf. In a letter to Körner on December 21, Schiller asked, Do you know anyone who can translate well into French, in case I would have need of such a person? I can hardly withstand the temptation to get involved in the dispute regarding the King, and to compose a treatise on the subject. It seems to me that such an undertaking is important enough to occupy the pen of a reasonable person. And a German writer who with liberty and eloquence pronounced on the dispute, would probably make some impression on these misguided souls. Even if one individual from another country made a public judgment on the matter, the first impression, at least, would be to consider him a spokesman for his class, if not for his country; and I think that precisely in this matter the French are not completely insensitive to foreign opinion. Körner had a translator in mind, and urged Schiller that such a step had to be taken quickly, before the Kings fate was decided. But it was already too late. Before Schiller could complete the memoir, the King had been condemned to death, and was executed on Jan. 21, 1793. Later, when Charlotte von Stein, another friend, still confident of a positive outcome of the French events, lauded the National Assembly as the Robbers, Schiller became incensed at this comparison to his early work.\n\nThe Historians Craft\n\nCreate Citizens for a Constitution\n\nRaising the Banner of Freedom\n\nSchiller now set about his most ambitious publishing project yet. He had been at the helm of at least six journals prior to this, but Die Horen was intended to create a revolution in thought in Germany, and throughout Europe overall. This was the culmination of the political task Schiller had set himself in the Aesthetical Letters. He intended to involve all the serious and committed intellectuals in the German cultural world. Even Immanuel Kant, sitting in his cozy little world in Königsberg on the Baltic Sea, was invited to participate. But the psychologically blocked professor had not quite gotten over the attacks made on his system by Schiller in On Grace and Dignity and, more rigorously, in the Aesthetical Letters. Although cordial and formally encouraging, Kant, who had mentioned Schillers critique of him in his Religion in the Light of Reason, never contributed anything to the magazine. Schiller would later say of this German representative of the so-called Enlightenment: There is always something in him which, like Luther, reminds you of a monk. He has opened the gates of the monastery, but can never quite escape its imprint. He also commented that Kant could never free his wings from lifes muck.\n\nWriting in September 1794 to Cotta, whom he wished to recruit as the publisher of the new journal, Schiller was enthusiastic. For our part, there is no longer any difficulty, and already we have pulled together a society of writers, which no other journal has yet been able to exhibit. Goethe, Herder, Garve, Engel, Fichte, Friedrich Jacobi, Matthison, Woltmann, Genz in Berlin, and still four or five others, whose names are not yet known by the general public, but who will yet play a role in the literary world, are, in addition to myself, participants in this project, he wrote. One of the contributors, Wilhelm von Humboldt, had even decided to take up residence in Jena, in order to be close to Schiller, and to assist him in the undertaking.\n\nSchillers prognosis about the French Revolutionthat it would have consequences far outside France itselfproved to be all too accurate. Already in 1792, the great European powers, Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain, had invaded France on several fronts. Believing that resistance would collapse within a matter of weeks or months, they were astounded by the ability of Revolutionary France to create entire armies almost from scratch. None of them had yet experienced the tremendous organizational capabilities of the great Lazare Carnot through his famous levée en masse, mobilizing the entire population as a people in arms, which not only allowed France to foil the attacks from abroad, but permitted it to expand outside its own borders. In July 1793, the city of Mainz, seat of the Archbishop of Mainz, one of the Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, was occupied by the French. In 1794, French troops occupied several German states on the left bank of the Rhine. In 1797, these regions would be formally annexed to France. The French presence also placed significant political pressure on all the states of southern Germany. The German nation was fast becoming occupied territory.\n\nPatriotic Germans now found themselves in a dilemma. Those who were favorable to the ideals of the Revolution, not yet aware of how those ideals were being per verted at that very moment, had to choose between these revolutionary ideals, and the occupation of their country by a foreign power. Some, like Schillers friend Georg Forster, for example, felt it fitting to serve in what was effectively a puppet gov ernment set up by the French in Mainz, a move condemned by Schiller.\n\nIt was in this atmosphere that Schiller launched his new publication, true to the commitment he had expressed in his letter to Augustenborg, to arm Truth and Virtue with that victorious energy which brings hearts under its sway. Writing in the announcement of the first issue of Die Horen, he wrote: At a time when the near sounds of war frighten the Fatherland, where the battle of political opinion and interests renews this war in almost every circle, and all too often frightens off the Muses and the Graces, where neither in the conversation nor in the writings of the day is there refuge from this all-persecuting demon of political criticism, it is perhaps a bold, as well as useful task to invite the much distracted reader to a diversion of a completely opposite character. But the more the restricted interest of the present puts the human spirit in a state of tension, confines it and subjugates it in thralldom, the more urgent will be the need for that which is purely human and elevated above the popular themes of the day, to place the spirit again in freedom, and to unite the politically divided world under the banner of Truth and Beauty. The correctness of Schillers view would not be manifest until it came to fruition after his death in the War of Liberation, when a generation educated by his work was prepared to wage an effective fight against the armies of Napoleon, using Schillers republican ideals to mobilize the population in their effort.\n\nThe Power of the Greeks\n\nThe Spirit of America\n\nA Call to Arms\n\nNew Vistas at the End\n\n1.

On March 10, 1789, he wrote to Körner: All sorts of ideas are rolling around although somewhat fuzzy in my head, but there will appear something clear for all this. But what meter ought I to choose for it? Is it difficult to guess which I would definitely choose? None other than ottave rime. Everything else, except for the iambic, I will detest until the day I die, and how pleasantly must the solemn, the sublime, play in such light fetters! How much will the epic gain through the tender, gentle form of beautiful rhyme! One must know how to sing, as the Greek bards sang the Iliad, as the gondoliers in Venice sang the stanza of Jerusalem Delivered.  Schillers friend Streicher wrote in 1784:  He believed that here iambic meter would be the most suited for the dignity of the action as well as that of the characters [of Don CarlosWJ]. In the beginning this made for some difficulty, since for two years he had not written anything in bound verse. Now he must order his phrasing rhythmically; in order to create a meter that flowed, he had first to think rhythmically. When the first scene of Don Carlos was thus arrayed in metric garb, Schiller saw himself that it was not only the most appropriate for this drama, but, as it even lifted common expressions to a higher plane, so would it even more enhance the sublimity and the beauty of the more significant passages.\n\n9.
