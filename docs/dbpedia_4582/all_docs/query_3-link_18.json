Did Germany develop along its own ‘unique path’ through history? This is one of the most controversial questions in German historical scholarship. For a long time, educated Germans answered it in the positive, initially by laying claim to a special German mission, then, after the collapse of 1945, by criticizing Germany’s deviation from the West. Today, the negative view is predominant. Germany did not, according to the now prevailing opinion, differ from the great European nations to an extent that would justify speaking of a ‘unique German path’. And, in any case, no country on earth ever took what can be described as the ‘normal’ path. The question of whether the peculiarities of German history justify speaking of a ‘unique German path’—or perhaps of several ‘unique German paths’—is the starting point of this two-volume study. Consequently, the attempt to provide an answer can only be made at the end, and this answer must reflect the problems discussed along the way. I present here not a ‘total history’, but a ‘problem history’. At the centre of this history of Germany in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries stands the relationship between democracy and nation. On the one hand, I enquire how it happened that Germany was politically so far behind England and France, developing a nation state only after 1866 and a democracy later still, in the wake of Germany’s defeat in the First World War and the revolution of 1918–19. On the other hand, I investigate the consequences of this twofold historical belatedness, consequences\n\n12\n\nwhich are still with us today. This is a political history, but not of the traditional kind. Affairs of high diplomacy are treated mostly in passing, battles virtually ignored. Events play an important role, but less for their own sake than for the significance ascribed to them by contemporaries and by those who came later. I focus special attention on interpretations of history, how they influenced people, and how they informed political decision-making. Such interpretations were and still are controversial, the objects of discourses. Accordingly, my study is also a discourse history. To draw is to omit, as the painter Max Liebermann once said. I will omit many things and concentrate on what seems important to me in the light of the central question. It goes without saying that a different central question would elicit a different set of problems and a different evaluation of facts and opinions. Historical narratives require a vanishing point. Vanishing points change in the course of time. The years 1933 and 1945 are the vanishing points towards which histories of modern Germany have been written after the Second World War. There is now a new vanishing point—the year 1990. We will not reach it until the second volume, which deals with the period between the ‘Third Reich’ and the reunification of Germany. Nonetheless, the vanishing point of ‘1990’ is already at work in the first volume, which takes us to the downfall of the first German democracy, known as the Weimar Republic, and to the threshold of the ‘Third Reich’. How it happened that Hitler came to power is still the most\n\n13\n\nimportant question of nineteenth- and twentieth-century German history, if not of all German history. Ever since 1990, however, it has been joined by a new question: why did the German question find its answer in reunification? Or, in other words, why is there no longer a German question after 1990, and why only after this particular year? In selecting the year 1990 as our latest vanishing point, we will be investigating many interpretations German history has undergone between 1945 and 1990. Since there is now a German nation state once again (albeit not a ‘classical’ nation state, but rather a ‘post-classical’ one, firmly integrated into Europe), German history can no longer be understood as the refutation of a German nation state, or indeed of the nation state as such. The first German national state, which came into being in 1871, belongs not only to the prehistory of 1933, but also of 1990. It bears within itself both the causes of its failure in the ‘German catastrophe’ of the years 1933–45 and, at the same time, much that went into the founding of the second German nation state. Here I will name only the key words: rule of law, constitutional state, federal state, social welfare state, general suffrage, and parliamentary culture. And another point, only seldom mentioned: the Two-Plus-Four Treaty of 1990 was a confirmation of Bismarck’s ‘Little Germany solution’, at least to the extent that the latter rejected the ‘Greater Germany solution’ of the German problem, the solution with Austria. Towards the end of the first volume it will become clear that, by the eve of Hitler’s accession to power, the German people were not only weary of the democracy of 1918–19, but also dissatisfied with the ‘Little German’ national state of 1871. Educated Germans were 14\n\nfascinated with the idea of an empire that included Austria and controlled central Europe, a polity that sought to be different and more than the typical nation state. The origins of the myth of the ‘Reich’ lie deep in the German past. The first chapter of the first volume of this German history from the end of the old empire to the reunification begins with an enquiry into the medieval antecedents of this myth. In the second volume, I will discuss the question of what replaced the mythology of the empire after it vanished along with the German Reich in 1945. Was it a particular ‘post-national’ idea of Europe? Was it, in other words, the idea of a new German mission—the supersession of the nation and the nation state, as an example to all of Europe? In the prologue to his book Die Geschichten der romanischen und\n\ngermanischen Völker von 1494 bis 1535*, Leopold von Ranke wrote that the historian should ‘merely tell how it really was’. After Hitler, this kind of history probably can no longer be written. For\n\nus, the question should be: Why did it happen the way it did? The readers I have in mind for this and the second volume are not only other historians, but all those who would like to know the answer to this question. I have recourse to historical sources as much as possible (and that is not the only respect in which Ranke is not yet obsolete). I consider narrative not the opposite of explanation, but rather its commensurate form. My notes at the end of the volume contain, in addition to source citations for the quotes, references to selected secondary literature. I include more of these for the central questions of this study, but nowhere is my goal the utopian one of providing an exhaustive list. Footnotes, added for this translation, 15\n\nexplain specialized terms and give translations for German poems, titles, and quotations.\n\n16\n\n1 Legacy of a Millennium THE REICH AND ITS MYTHOLOGY In the beginning was the Reich. Everything that divides German history from the history of the great European nations had its origin in the Holy Roman Empire. The parting of ways began in the Middle Ages, when nation-states began to develop in England and France, while in Germany the formation of the modern state proceeded along lower, territorial lines. At the same time, a political construct endured in Germany that claimed to be more than simply one kingdom among many: the Holy Roman Empire. We must go far back in history to understand why Germany became a nation-state later than England and France—and a democracy later still.1\n\nAccordingly, the first part of this study concerns the old Reich and the mythology that grew up around it. This is the first of three basic phenomena that shaped the character of German history throughout many centuries. The second is the confessional schism of the sixteenth century, which contributed decisively to making Germany the theatre of a thirty-year European war the century following. The third phenomenon is the opposition between Austria and Prussia. If in the second half of the eighteenth century the 17\n\nReich seemed to many people no more than an empty shell, the Austro-Prussian antinomy was the reason. The Reich had always been a myth. Medieval writers expended a great deal of effort attempting to prove that the Roman imperium had never actually ceased to exist. To be sure, it had been divided in 395 into eastern and western halves; yet even after 476, when the western empire had collapsed in the tumults of the tribal migrations, the eastern empire still endured with its capital Constantinople, formerly Greek Byzantium. However, the claim of the eastern basileus to be the Roman Emperor was recognized ever less in the west, especially after the accession of a woman, the empress-widow Irene, to the throne at the end of the eighth century. Then, in 800, Pope Leo III placed the imperial crown on the head of Charlemagne, the king of the Franks and Lombards and protector of the ecclesiastic state created by his father, Pippin. The Romans rejoiced. Thereafter the imperial mantle passed from the Greeks to the Franks (or, as it later came to be said, to the Germans). This was, at any rate, how the proponents of the medieval theory of the translatio imperii, the transfer or ‘translation’ of Roman imperial power, viewed things. Indeed, they had every reason to emphasize the continuity of the empire. Following early Christian tradition, which drew on the prophet Daniel, they considered the Roman empire the fourth and last of the great world empires, preceded by those of Babylon, Medea-Persia, and Macedonia. This succession also implied a shift in geopolitical focus from east to west, from the orient to the occident, with the imperium Romanum (from the fourth century AD onwards referred 18\n\nto as the imperium Christianum) the westernmost of them all. It was generally believed that the Antichrist would not arise as long as the Roman empire endured. According to the Book of Revelation, in its medieval interpretation based on St Jerome, the Antichrist was a tyrant, false prophet, Jew, and chief of heretics. The New Testament prophecy considered his rule to represent the end of world history. Thereafter Christ would return, destroy the selfproclaimed ‘god’, and initiate the Heavenly Kingdom. The Roman empire was to play the role of the catechon, the power holding back the enemy of Christ and thus delaying the end of the world. It was not until the era of modern theological scholarship that the Pauline authorship of 2 Thessalonians, the source text (chapter 2) of the catechon idea, was called into question. It is now generally considered a fictitious ascription.2\n\nThe theory of imperial continuity played an important role in the coronation of the Saxon king Otto the Great by Pope John XII in 962. This event represented—or was made to represent—not the foundation of a new empire, but the return of the imperium Romanum. To be sure, the Treaty of Verdun had divided the Frankish empire in 843, and there had been no emperor in the west for nearly four decades, ever since the murder of the last emperor from the imperial Frankish nobility in 924. However, the East Franks had had a decisive voice in the royal election of Otto’s father, Heinrich I, in 919. Looking back on Otto’s coronation in 962 from his vantage point in the mid-twelfth century, Bishop Otto of Freising, the uncle and counsellor of the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick Barbarossa, spoke of a ‘retranslation’: after the Franks and the Lombards, the Empire of the Romans was now being 19\n\n‘transferred back’ (retranslatum est) to the Germans (ad teutonicos) or, as others saw it, to the Franks, who had before ‘let it slip,’ so to speak.3\n\nIn Otto’s day there was, as yet, no mention of ‘die Deutschen’. Latinized terms such as teutonici and teutones only became common around the turn of the millennium. By this time, of course, they no longer referred to the old Teutonic tribes, but to the contemporaneous ‘Germans’: people who spoke the same language (deutsch) despite various tribal ancestry. Thus it makes little sense to speak of ‘the German nation’ much before 1000. The second half of the eleventh century witnessed the politicization of the concept deutsch. During the struggle over the investiture of imperial bishoprics, the first large-scale conflict between secular and ecclesiastical powers, Pope Gregory VII referred to his opponent, Emperor Henry IV of the Salian Frankish dynasty, as rex Teutonicorum, ‘king of the Germans’. He wanted to make clear that a German king who had not been vetted and crowned by the pope could be, at most, a ruler over his own people, but not the Roman emperor. The term was intended as a humiliation, and as such it was fully in keeping withGregory’s attitude at Canossa, the fortress on the northern slopes of the Apennines in front of which, in January 1077, the pope compelled the emperor to wait three days in the habiliments of a penitent before lifting the papal interdiction against him. North of the Alps, however, the term regnum Teutonicorum(‘kingdom of the Germans’) soon came to be used in a more positive manner, signalling the developing sense of\n\ncommunity and growing self-awareness of the Germans.4\n\n20\n\nNonetheless, the German kings were not going to rest content with a mere kingdom. The concept regnum Teutonicorum referred only to the German part of their sovereign territories. It did not apply to Burgundy, which had belonged to the Reich since 1034, nor to the Italian lands under imperial control. The German kings needed the imperial title in order to rule the Reich in its entirety effectively. The terms imperium and imperator did not necessarily imply a claim to suzerainty over polities that did not belong to the Reich. However, the medieval emperors certainly did insist upon a special dignitas and ceremonial pre-eminence over other occidental kings. As long as they restricted themselves to this, they were not challenged, not even in France and England. As protector of the Christian church, the emperor merited a higher rank than other sovereigns. But only in this capacity.5\n\nDuring the reign of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, western observers gained the impression that the German emperors were indeed out for more that the prestige of the position of first among equals. In 1160, at a church synod dominated by the imperial episcopate, and thus in no way representative of the church as a whole, Frederick I acknowledged as pope (or rather antipope) a candidate whom, in the prior deliberations of the College of Cardinals, only the minority fraction loyal to Frederick had supported. One of the most famous churchmen of the age, John of Salisbury, the bishop of Chartres, rose in protest: ‘Who is he that subjugates the Universal Church to a particular church? Who has appointed the Germans the judge of nations? [Quis Teutonicos constituit iudices nationum?] Who has granted to such coarse and violent folk the power to install a prince above the heads of 21\n\nhumanity?’6 The English critique from Chartres was a response to what we might call Hohenstaufen ‘imperial ideology’, to use a modern expression. In 1157, the chancery of Frederick I began to employ the term Sacrum Imperium, ‘Holy Empire’. Hohenstaufen political propagandists referred to the rulers of other kingdoms condescendingly as ‘little kings’, reguli. Certain poems by the Archpoet, a writer belonging to the circle of the imperial chancellor Reinald von Dassel, and the Spiel vom Antichrist*, written in 1160 in the monastery at Tegernsee, went so far as to thematize a German ‘world empire’. The anonymous author of the latter text considered this pretension justified by the special vocation of the Germans within the course of sacred history: as the nucleus of the people of God, the Germans would be the last to resist the Antichrist, the enemy of the fatherland.7\n\nSuch ideas played virtually no role in the practical politics of Frederick I. Still, there is little doubt that his high-handed brinkmanship vis-À-vis the papacy, indeed his entire Italian policy, was unrealistic and catastrophic. And considering the achievements and plans of his son, Emperor Henry VI (1190–7), one is perfectly justified in talking about Hohenstaufen ‘world policy’. This prince, having obtained a claim to rule Sicily through marriage, enforced it with military power. He compelled the English king, Richard Lionheart, whom he had taken prisoner after the latter’s return from the Third Crusade, to receive England as an imperial fief. He secured suzerainty over Armenia, Tunis, and Tripoli, obtained a Hohenstaufen claim to the succession in Byzantium, and probably 22\n\ncontemplated the conquest of the whole eastern empire. He did not succeed in subjecting France to imperial domination, but it is quite possible that he would have extended his plans of conquest to the west, once he had secured the east. In the event, his early death consigns these matters to the realm of speculation. Had he lived longer, he might also have realized yet another of his ambitious goals: to establish the Reich as the hereditary princedom of the Hohenstaufens. This question, too, must remain open.8\n\nThe short reign of Henry VI marks the turning point in the history of the medieval Reich. Henry had tried to subjugate all of Europe; now, after a seventeen-year interval plagued by competing claims to the throne and civil war, it was left to the other European powers to decide the issue of Henry’s succession by his son, Frederick II. The dice fell in 1214 on the field of Bouvines in a battle between the forces of English and French chivalry. The military defeat of the English spelled the final political defeat of their German ally, the Guelf emperor Otto IV, son of Frederick Barbarossa’s inveterate enemy, Henry the Lion. Frederick II of Hohenstaufen was crowned German king in 1215 at Aachen. The imperial coronation took place five years later in Rome. But Frederick was much more a Sicilian than a German prince. For Germany, the most important event of his rule was his renunciation of royal authority in the German lands and his cession of the rights to levy tolls and mint coins to the ecclesiastic and secular princes. These statutes were codified in the Confoederatio cum principibus ecclesiasticis (1220) and the Statutum in favorem principum (1232). The latter document was directed primarily against the cities and the urban bourgeoisie, who claimed 23\n\nindependence from feudal princes under the motto Stadtluft macht frei, ‘city air liberates’. The territorial princes had already gained considerably in power during the struggle over lay investiture, during which they had temporarily sided with the pope against the German king. They now emerged as the true winners from the crisis of the high medieval Reich. The documents of 1220 and 1232 consolidated the development of Germany along the lines of the territorial state. This development had actually begun in the previous century, not so much through the transfer of royal privileges, but as a consequence of the local princes’ efforts to settle and develop their land and concentrate their power. This happened not only in the old German territories of the west, south, and north, but also in the regions east of the Elbe that had been ‘Germanized’ in the wake of conquest, missionary activity among the Slavic peoples, and colonization. In terms of general constitutional development, the Battle of Bouvines, which had made Frederick II’s rule possible, was merely one turning point among several.9\n\nThe battle had a greater impact on France and England. In France, the defeat of the English and their ally Otto strengthened the domestic position of the victorious French king. The hitherto powerful vassals of the crown suffered a loss of influence vis-À-vis a strongly centralizing monarchy. On the other side of the English Channel the situation was much different. Magna Carta of 1215 forced the weakened English monarch to concede extensive rights and privileges both to the nobility and to the bourgeoisie. Furthermore, he had to submit monarchical authority to a certain degree of review and control by a committee elected from among 24\n\nthe barons. These concessions laid the basis for the development of England into a constitutional state.10\n\nThe later thirteenth century witnessed the zenith of medieval imperial ideology, even though by this time the power of the German emperors had long since begun to wane. In his influential and widely read treatise Memoriale der prerogativa Romani imperii (1289), Alexander von Roes, a canon lawyer from Cologne, outlined the structure of what he considered a sensible and necessary societal order in the following way: the Romans, being the older people, ought to receive the office of the papacy (sacerdotium) as their own; the imperial office (imperium) rightly falls to the Germans or Franks (Germani vel Franci) as the younger people; to the French or Gauls, noted for their mental acumen,\n\naccrues the study of the sciences (studium).11 The author intended this scheme of a division of labour among the nations as a defensive manoeuvre against French attempts to establish a claim to the emperorship. However, the idea found no resonance in France. In a document for Philip the Fair from 1296, an anonymous French lawyer repeated a claim that had already been made the previous century on behalf of the French monarch: namely that in his kingdom, he is emperor. ‘And because there was a king in France before there was an emperor, the king may be counted the worthier.’ This statement can almost be interpreted as a direct response to the project of Alexander von Roes.12\n\nIn one area, however, there was agreement between the secular rulers of the west, at least in theory: they all rejected the ‘papal revolution’, to use the expression of Eugen Rosenstock-Huessey, 25\n\none of the last German universal historians of the twentieth century, in his 1931 book about the revolutions in Europe. The ‘papal revolution’ found its manifesto in Pope Gregory VII’s 1075 bull Dictatus Papae. Gregory’s claim that the pope could depose the emperor reversed only the practice of the emperors. His assertion that only the pope could remove or relocate bishops, however, was just as much a declaration of war against the kings of France and England as against the emperor. If the pope had had his will in the matter, the political system of all three lands would have collapsed, since bishops not only exercised spiritual offices, but were also, in personal union, the highest administrative officials of the crown. As it happened, the curia achieved at best partial success. From the early twelfth century onward (first in France, then in England, then in Germany with the Concordat of Worms in 1122), bishops were elected to their offices according to canon law, but in the presence of the secular ruler, allowing the latter to continue to exert his influence. The Investiture Contest was only one stage in the struggle between spiritual and secular authority. In 1302 Pope Boniface VIII reasserted the curia’s stance that the papacy was above all other rulers. The bull Unam Sanctam, directed at the French king Philip the Fair, claimed that two swords lay in the hand of the pope, a spiritual sword and a secular sword. Both were thus under the power of the church, the only difference being that the spiritual sword was wielded by the church, the secular sword for the church.13\n\nThe developing nation states of France and England answered the papal challenge by nationalizing their churches to a great 26\n\nextent, beginning with a rigorous restriction of papal taxes from church property. The Roman-German emperors could not go the national route without calling into question their own universal aspirations and provoking the German princes, many of whom were striving to become ‘pope’ in their own territories by\n\nconsolidating their regional churches.14 The reaction of the emperor’s ‘party’ to the secular pretensions of the church (and to the instrumentalization of the church by France during the Avignon papacy from 1309 to 1377) was initially ideological in nature. Two literary advocates of Emperor Ludwig the Bavarian (1314–47), the Italian political intellectual Marsilius of Padua and the English Franciscan William of Ockham, argued that the transmission of the Roman imperial mantle ‘from the Greeks to the Germans’ in the year 800 derived from the will of the Roman people. Thus, they placed a democratic doctrine against the curial interpretation of the translatio imperii by means of the papal office, which had been articulated ‘ex cathedra’ in 1202 by Innocent III in the bull Venerabilem. Yet the reality of the Sacrum Imperium contradicted the idea of the sovereignty of the people so radically that the construct had little impact.15\n\nThe secularization of the church also provoked a response from the German mystics, beginning with Eckhart (c.1250–1327). Unlike the efforts of Ludwig’s political theorists, the ‘inward turn’ of the mystics had a great impact on the development of the church in Germany. In his 1929 book on the Sacrum Imperium, Alois Dempf interpreted the struggle to deepen and enliven religious devotion in Germany as the counterpart to the ‘political reformation’ in France\n\n27\n\nand England. Transforming ‘piety without priests into a widespread pietistic movement’, German mysticism prepared the way for a development of world-historical consequence: the Reformation. The young Luther knew in what traditions he stood.16\n\nThe estrangement from Rome, implicit in mysticism but restricted to the religious sphere, intensified to an early form of German national consciousness in the course of the fifteenth century. Both the emperor and the imperial estates could agree in their rejection of the papacy’s financial demands. Gravamina nationis Germanicae, the title of the document into which their complaints were formally gathered (beginning c.1440), gives expression to the consciousness of their commonality. The name Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation was used for the first time in 1486 in an imperial law; the complete title Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation first appears in the recess of the Imperial Diet of Cologne from 1512. The addendum ‘of the German Nation’ was not at first intended to establish equivalence between the Roman empire and Germany, but rather as a restriction indicating the ‘German territories’ of the Reich in contrast to the territories of the welsch— that is, Italian—nation. Yet even in the original spirit of the title, the German lands were considered the core of the empire, and by means of this usage the term ‘nation’ acquired a new significance. Whereas before it had served as a practical means of distinguishing and organizing national-ethnic groups at universities, church councils, and among the foreign merchants in west European trading centres, in the fifteenth century it broadened to a general way of looking at the world. The defining factor in the German concept of ‘nation’ was 28\n\nthe commonality of language (Gezunge). It probably could not have been otherwise, since, as we recall, the ‘German nation’ had no political-administrative reality of any kind at this time. In France and England, in contrast, the formation of the nation proceeded from the monarchy, which lent a statist orientation to the idea of the ‘nation’ that was not possible in Germany. The emperor made use of the word ‘nation’ whenever he desired the support of the imperial estates (Reichsstände) and their leaders, the imperial electors, in matters of common interest. The seven electors, however (the archbishops of Trier, Cologne, and Mainz, the king of Bohemia, the count of the Rhenish Palatinate, the duke of Saxony, and the count of Brandenburg) had reason to believe that not everything the elected ‘Roman king’ considered necessary was in the interest of the Reich and nation. The dynastic interests of the Habsburgs, who had stood at the apex of the Reich since 1438, were by no means automatically the same as the interests of the empire or the German nation.17\n\nConversely, the agenda of the electors—to the extent that they could agree, which happened rarely enough—was also not necessarily in harmony with the common good of the Reich. While they were recognized as the co-bearers of imperial authority by the Golden Bull, the foundational law of the Reich from 1356, the seven electors did not alone constitute the ‘nation’. It also included the princes and the other imperial estates, who had far less influence on imperial policy and legislation, not to mention the cities, which were most burdened by imperial taxation but had no voice in the Imperial Diet (Reichstag) in the fifteenth century. Even at the beginning of the 1400s, it was clear to many that the empire 29\n\nneeded to be thoroughly reorganized. The steps taken under Emperors Frederick III (1440–93) and Maximilian I (1493–1519), however, hardly merited the name of ‘imperial reform’. In Germany, the real institutional development of the state took place not at the level of the Reich, but in the territories, whose princes increasingly took advantage of Roman law and employed the services of well-educated officials trained in its application. The princes of the larger territories were especially energetic in this kind of regional reform and consolidation, and it was they who, in their corresponding lack of interest in centralizing measures, stood in the way of effective imperial reform.18\n\nIt was this rather dismal reality of the Reich that prompted the German humanists, both before and after 1500, to call for the restoration of the old imperial glory. The source of their hope and inspiration was the remembrance of a distant past, the age of Germania Magna, in which the nations of Germanic origin were still undivided. Invoking Tacitus, whose Germania had been rediscovered in 1455, the humanists drew an idealizing picture of German virtue that contrasted advantageously with its distorted counterpart: the Romans, who had long since lapsed into decadence and debauchery. Republican Rome, not the Rome of the Caesars, could teach the Germans the love of the fatherland. After all, the Germans had inherited the succession to the Roman empire. The greatness and dignity of the Reich derived from this legacy, which was earned and legitimate. This belief did not, however, prevent the humanists from appealing to Pope Innocent III’s bull Venerabilem in order to prove that the empire had been transferred from the Greeks to the Germans in the person of Charlemagne in 30\n\n800. The aspirations arising from this view of things assumed, in\n\nthe writings of several authors, Hohenstaufen-like dimensions.19 In his Narrenschiff*, Sebastian Brant, a member of the upper Rhenish\n\nhumanist circle, appeals to God to make the Roman empire so large daz im all erd sy underthon als es von recht und gsatz solt han.† In this respect, too, Martin Luther was certainly no humanist. According to his letter An den christlichen Adel deutscher Nation von des christlichen Standes Besserung† (1520), the first Roman empire had been destroyed by the Goths. And the Roman empire over which the emperor presided at Constantinople should, by rights, never have been transferred by the pope to the Germans. That the pope did so was ‘violence and lawlessness’, and it turned the Germans into the ‘knaves of the pope’. Still, even Luther recognized the cunning of reason and the normative power of factual reality. He regarded it as certain ‘that God used the papal wickedness in this matter in order to give the German nation such an Empire, and allowed them to build up another after the fall of the first Roman empire, one that still stands today’. Thus, even Luther was unwilling to recommend that the same be renounced, but rather it ought to be ruled honestly in the fear of God as long as it please Him. For as I have said, it matters not to Him whence an Empire comes, he nonetheless wishes to have it ruled. If the popes have dishonestly taken it from others, still we have won it not dishonestly . . . It is all God’s order, 31\n\nthat came to pass too early for us to know about.20\n\nTHE CONFESSIONAL DIVIDE We have arrived at the second of the basic phenomena that have shaped German history, the Reformation. As Hegel wrote in his Vorlesungen zur Philosophie der Geschichte* in 1830, ‘The old,\n\nthoroughly tried and tested inwardness of the German people must bring about this break with the past out of the simple, ingenuous heart.’ For Hegel, the Reformation was the ‘sun that transfigures everything’; the event through which the ‘subjective spirit in Truth’ became ‘free’ and ‘Christian freedom’ became ‘real’. Freedom was, in Hegel’s view, the ‘essential content of the Reformation; man is in his very nature destined to be free’.21\n\nA radically different evaluation of the Reformation was undertaken by Marx in his ‘Einleitung zur Kritik der Hegelischen\n\nRechtsphilosophie’,† written at the end of 1843 and the beginning of 1844. As Marx saw it, Luther destroyed faith in authority because he had restored the authority of faith. He changed the priests into laymen because he had changed the laymen into priests. He liberated man from external religiosity because he made religiosity into the inner man. He emancipated the body from its chains because he chained the heart.22\n\nPossibly even more radical was Nietzsche’s rejection of Hegel’s\n\ninterpretation in Der Antichrist† (1888): ‘The Germans have taken 32\n\nfrom Europe the last great cultural harvest that Europe could have gathered—the Renaissance.’ Cesare Borgia as pope: for Nietzsche, this would have meant ‘victory’, the end of Christianity. Luther, on the other hand, ‘this monk, with all of the failed priest’s instincts for vengeance, rebelled in Rome against the Renaissance... And Luther restored the Church. He attacked it... the Renaissance—an event with no meaning, a grandiose futility.’23\n\nThe German Reformation was both: the liberation from ecclesiastical coercion increasingly perceived as foreign rule and the establishment of a new, interiorized, state-supporting regime of coercion. Liberating and repressing at the same time, the Reformation, as Marx noted, could only partially supersede the Middle Ages. Engels was fundamentally in error when he called it the ‘revolution no. 1 of the bourgeoisie’.24 In terms of social\n\nhistory, especially in Switzerland and upper and middle Germany, the Reformation represented the uprising of the ‘common man’ in the country and city. The Peasants’ War of 1524–5 was the culmination of this movement.25\n\nIn its political consequences, the Reformation is best described as what Rosenstock-Huessey called a ‘princes’ revolution’: The grand hierarchy of the Church Visible has lost its pathos. The human soul is no longer where the clergy seeks it. The educational efforts of the church can thus confidently be left to the bishops of each locality and territory, and this bishop is the worldly authority. Luther’s imperial elector replaces the supreme bishop ... Probably in no other country in the world did two such different fields of vision overlap as they did here. Above, prince and statesman fight 33\n\nfor their right and freedom of authority. Below, burghers and peasants live and learn the pure doctrine as well as obedience to authority within the narrow circle of their bondsman’s understanding... the ‘unpolitical’ nature of the average German is already implicit in the voluntary division of labour between Luther and his sovereign.26\n\nTerritorial institutions of ecclesiastical authority had already developed in pre-Reformation times, and Luther did not initiate his movement in order to make (according to a venerable cliché) the territorial prince ‘pope in his own country’. Rather, his starting point was the idea of a general ‘lay priesthood’, both individualistic and egalitarian. In the belief that the end of the world was near and that the Antichrist had already arisen in Rome in the person of the pope, Luther considered spiritual awakening to have priority over the institutional consolidation of the new faith. After all, the new faith was, correctly understood, the old faith. After the German imperial electors had chosen Maximilian’s grandson Charles V (and not the French king Francis I, who enjoyed the support of the pope) in 1519, Luther, too, briefly hoped for largescale reforms through a national council. But these hopes were soon dashed. Under Charles V, Germany was no longer the focus of the Habsburg universal monarchy. Additionally, the new faith was undermined by the activities of the iconoclasts and free sectarians (Schwärmer), which Luther regarded as diabolic attacks on the gospel. Faced with these problems, the movement shifted its priorities. Now the goal was to gather the faithful together and to strengthen the faith, which meant, above all, establishing new 34\n\npastoral communities and reforming schools and universities. In all their efforts, Luther and the Lutherans needed the support of the secular authorities, who had been ordained by God and who wielded the sword and rod to punish the wicked and protect the devout. Many princes had not merely a religious but also a material interest in promoting the new faith. By means of the Reformation, they gained access to church property, thereby increasing their government revenue and reinforcing their lordship. For Luther, the efforts the states and cities directed toward providing a lawful order for the new faith represented a labour of love. In making Luther’s cause their own, secular rulers could, but were not obligated to, adopt his rationale.27\n\nThe development of the Evangelical church system in the territories began in 1527 with the visitations of Luther’s territorial sovereign, Elector John of Saxony, to church communities and schools. The other princes who professed the new faith soon followed the example of the Saxon elector. The result was a coercive ecclesiastical system in which, in the words of the Evangelical theologian and philosopher of religion Ernst Troeltsch, the human element, hitherto of secondary importance, became the main focus: The territorial princes unified theology and streamlined dogma, giving the symbolic books compulsory authority. With the help and participation of the theologians, they created an ecclesiastical-state bureaucracy that assumed the functions of the administration and the ecclesiastical courts. They imposed the principles of Christian faith and morals on the secular legal system and mandated civil35\n\nlegal consequences for spiritual punishments and measures. In theory, the community was ruled by Christ and Holy Scripture; in practice, it was ruled by the territorial sovereigns and the theologians.28\n\nRegardless of how sharply the former Augustinian monk Luther distinguished, in the tradition of St Augustine, between the ‘two kingdoms’, the earthy kingdom and the kingdom of God, in fact he so narrowed the gap between secular and spiritual power, throne and altar, that the state acquired ‘a certain quasi-divine quality’, to use Troeltsch’s expression. Accordingly, the political consequences of Lutheranism in Germany (and here only) were radically different from those of the other main movement of the Reformation outside of Germany, Calvinism. In Geneva, where Calvin lived and taught, the imbrication of the community church with the republican government favoured the eventual development of democratic communities. In Germany, the alliance between territorial sovereignty and episcopate fostered the development of absolutism.29\n\nTo the Rome–Wittenberg antinomy was thus added the contrast between German Lutheranism and the Calvinist-influenced northwest, the strongest bastions of which were England and the Netherlands. In consequence of the Reformation, Germany became more ‘eastern’. In a study of Luther first published in English in 1944, then in a revised edition in German in 1947, Franz Borkenau (an intellectual of wide erudition who had broken with party communism in 1929 and was later driven into exile by Hitler) 36\n\nargued that the Lutheran movement articulated in terms of dogma a number of differences between the eastern church and the western church that were only latent in the antagonism between the two great ecclesiastical systems. The Lutheran doctrine of justification, founded exclusively upon Christology, distinguishing sharply between morality and religion, dualistic in nature, and emphasizing a passive inner experience of faith and salvation, was essentially that of the eastern church as it came to be articulated in polemic confrontation with the western church. Lutheranism appears here as a branch of the eastern style of religious observance, grown up in protest against the religious reform movement of the west. Behind the doctrinal opposition to Rome yawns the cultural opposition to the occident.30\n\nThere is, to be sure, something problematic about such an exact comparison of Lutheranism to Greek-Russian Orthodoxy. Nonetheless, in Luther’s religious inwardness there was an element that separated the Lutheran movement from the west and linked it to the east. Luther’s inner distance from the political world makes his vehement condemnation of the Peasants’ War and his dependence on the princes seem logical. The ‘summepiscopate’ in the Lutheran territories of Germany, the appropriation of the functions of the regional bishopric by the territorial prince, nearly eliminated one of the features of the historical occident distinguishing it from the ‘caesaropapism’ of the orient: the separation of powers between imperium (or regnum) and sacerdotium, a theme that had pitted the popes against the\n\n37\n\nemperors and kings in a struggle that lasted centuries. Wherever this separation was maintained, or could establish itself again, an environment conducive to ideas of freedom was fostered. The Anglican state church, introduced in England by Henry VIII in 1534, was from the beginning closely linked to the estates; in the second half of the seventeenth century it was parliamentarized and finally, in the nineteenth century, liberalized. In Germany, on the other hand, the summepiscopate had, until 1918, an authoritarian and governmental or—to put it in somewhat exaggerated terms— caesaropapist orientation. Politically speaking, German Lutheranism represented a step backward. ‘Lutheranism purchased spiritual liberation at the price of earthly subjection.’ Borkenau’s verdict summarizes the contradictory legacy of Martin Luther’s Reformation. Both sides, the cultural and the political, must be seen in context. The German spirit could unfold its wings by leaving practical considerations behind, considerations that can never be set aside whenever every action must be justified in this world [as in Calvinism (H.A.W.)]. German music and German metaphysics could never have arisen in a culture shaped by Calvinism. Of course, a terrible danger lay in this soaring flight over the practical ... The political is the place where spirit and world, morality and egotism, individualism and solidarity are brought together. The Lutheran attitude lacks the essence of the political and thus is partly responsible for making us into a people that always failed politically, a people tossed about between the equally false extremes of world-shy, good-natured inwardness and the most 38\n\nbrutal kind of megalomania.31 Even with Luther, only one step separated inwardness from brutality. This is evident in the increasingly unbridled intensity of his attacks on the pope, the Anabaptists, and the Jews. Luther’s enmity towards the Jews is the aspect of his life and work that confirms with especial forcefulness Marx’s verdict that the Reformation only partially managed to overcome the Middle Ages. In Luther’s later life, his earlier disappointment over the fact that the Jews could not be converted to the Evangelical faith gave way to a blind hatred. He saw only a malevolent stubbornness in the refusal of the Jews, the blood relatives of Christ, to hearken to the Good News. Expecting the end of the world in the near future, Luther came to see the Jews as yet another manifestation of the Antichrist, as he had done before with the pope and the Turks. His 1543 pamphlet Von den Juden und ihren Lügen* repeated old\n\ncharges, ones he knew full well could not be proven: the Jews poison wells and abduct Christian children for ritual killing. He exhorted the political authorities to burn the synagogues; to destroy Jews’ houses; to forbid the rabbis to teach under pain of corporal punishment or death; to take away the right of the Jews to safe-conduct; to forbid them to use the streets or practice usury; to compel them to perform manual labour; and, if necessary, to expel them from the country. His advice to Christians was that they cross themselves whenever they saw a real Jew and speak openly and firmly the phrase: ‘There walks a devil in the flesh.’ This was, indeed, the ‘darkness of the Middle Ages’, which not only continued to live in Luther, but also in no small measure through 39\n\nhim.32 The Reformation forms one of the deepest epochal divisions in German history. In the preface to his Deutsche Geschichte im Zeitalter der Reformation* (1839), Leopold von Ranke spoke of ‘the most\n\nimportant event of our fatherland’. The Reformation did not simply divide the German nation; in certain respects it structured it anew. The emperor himself, belonging as he did to one of the competing religious parties, was less able to represent the whole of the Reich. Not even the curia of the electors could claim to stand for the whole, since it, too, was split into confessional factions. The same was true of the Imperial Diet. The religious parties themselves, however, were supra-territorial, indeed ‘national’ associations. From the point of view of the followers of the new faith, the German nation was the entity that came closest to embodying the ideal entirety of the Protestant imperial estates, most—but not all —of which had joined together in the Thuringian town of Schmalkalden in 1531, forming a defensive alliance against the ecclesiastical-political aspirations of Charles V. The common bond was not political, but rather cultural: the Evangelical faith in the sense of the ‘Augsburg Confession’, as it had been worked out in doctrinally binding terms by Philip Melanchthon in consultation with Luther (and not always to the satisfaction of the latter) at the Imperial Diet of Augsburg in 1530. This was the first step toward the ‘confessionalization’ of the new faith. One of the most important factors for the spirit of solidarity and community among German Protestants was Luther’s Bible translation. This text created the supra-regional German standard\n\n40\n\nlanguage, which in turn became the most important ‘national’ medium of communication and, as such, the prerequisite for the possibility that even two centuries later, when there was still no unified German state, educated Germans could consider themselves members of a German cultural nation. The Evangelical segment played such a crucial role in the formation of German national identity that one must speak of a Protestant cultural hegemony. For all that, however, Luther’s Volk remained surprisingly mute, as Eugen Rosenstock-Huessey remarked. ‘The nation he awoke to life became a nation of princes, professors, and pastors, and remained so for a long time, all the way to the professors’ parliament at the Paulskirche in 1848. This role of the German universities in\n\nshaping the German nation develops in the fifteenth century.’33 Catholic Germany found little succour in the support of the emperor. The wars between Charles V and Francis I of France, as well as the Turkish danger, forced the emperor and the Catholic estates repeatedly to compromise with the supporters of the new faith, delaying the ultimate confrontation. This happened for the first time at the Imperial Diet held at Speyer in 1526, which left it for each imperial estate to decide whether or not to follow the Edict of Worms, the ostracism of Luther and the condemnation of his teachings in 1521. The second instance was the ‘Nuremberg Standstill’ of 1532, which allowed Protestants the free exercise of their religion for the time being. Only after the year of Luther’s death in 1546, when Charles was no longer hampered by involvement in foreign wars and had brought one of the most important Protestant princes, Duke Moritz of Saxony, over to his side (by promising him the electoral dignity, which was in the 41\n\nhands of his cousin from another branch of the Saxon house, John Frederick), could the emperor dare to strike against the Schmalkaldic League. However, the emperor did not manage to convert his military triumph in the Schmalkaldic War (1546–7) into a political success, since Moritz of Saxony, now an elector, allied himself to the princely opposition, made common cause with the French king Henry II(to whom he conceded the imperial curacy over Metz, Toul, and Verdun), and took up arms against Charles V. The Treaty of Passau, which the emperor found himself forced to conclude in 1552, again granted the Protestants freedom of worship until the convention of a new Imperial Diet. This assembly, held in 1555 in Augsburg, marks both the end of the age of the Reformation and the conclusion of the struggle over imperial reform. From this moment forward, all parties acknowledged the principle cuius regio, eius religio (‘He who rules the land determines the religion’), formulated later by a jurist. The Augsburg Confession (not the ‘reformed’ confession of Calvin and of Ulrich Zwingli, the popular priest of Zurich) was now legally recognized in the Reich. The Religious Peace of Augsburg did not consider the individual believer; only the prince had the right to decide between the old and new faiths. Dissidents had only the right to leave the country. Imperial cities with mixed confessions were to be guided by the principle of parity, and in ecclesiastically ruled territories a controversial ‘clerical reservation’ was to apply: a bishop or abbot of the Reich who converted from Catholicism to the Lutheran faith was supposed to relinquish his office immediately; the cathedral or cathedral chapter had the right to elect a Catholic successor. But 42\n\nthe Religious Peace of Augsburg did not compel this to be done. The recess of the Augsburg Diet spelled the failure of two competing solutions for a universal resolution to the crisis: on the one hand, the restoration of Reich and church through the emperor and in terms of the old faith, and, on the other hand, the restoration of a unified church in terms of the new faith. The possibility of a Reich ruled by the estates (Stände), a project pursued in the early sixteenth century by a circle of reformers under the patronage of Berthold of Henneberg, the elector of Mainz and arch-chancellor of the Reich, also ultimately came to nothing. In 1555, as Heinz Schilling wrote, the ‘estates and the crown finally agreed that, in Germany, the princes and their territories would be the bearers of a new conception of the state and that the Reich would remain a pre-governmental, political union.’34\n\nThe Holy Roman empire was thus preserved. In fact, its institutions grew even stronger. A great civil war, a war among the princes, which as things stood would perforce have become a panEuropean war, was once again avoided. The compromise of 1555 sanctioned the right of the German territorial states to religious particularity, though it did not yet permit the final consequence of the increase in territorial liberty, namely full political sovereignty. Yet even in 1555 it was clear that the government of princes would have a greater chance than the emperor of claiming the loyalties of the subjects in the event of conflict. Even if the Reich could offer an ultimate organizational support and repeatedly managed, especially in the face of external threats, to call forth waves of ‘imperial patriotism’, nonetheless a much stronger sense of allegiance and solidarity developed at the territorial level. The idea 43\n\nof a German nation remained an alternative empire, an empire of faith and spirit, and one that required no emperor. The Religious Peace of Augsburg was one of the main reasons Protestant Germany was able to shield itself for over half a century from the effects of the Catholic Counter-Reformation, which began at the Council of Trent (1545–63). Countries in which the CounterReformation triumphed were economically and intellectually so lastingly set back that the effects persist to the present day. Spain, at one time the great Catholic power due to its colonial possessions in Latin America, succumbed to England, its most dangerous enemy, in the second half of the sixteenth century. The defeat was not merely military, that is, the destruction of the Armada in 1588. Within a few decades, the Calvinist-spirited maritime trading power of England had also economically eclipsed the countries of the Iberian peninsula, Spain and Portugal. France, on the other hand, successfully resisted the Counter-Reformation, remaining true to its national ecclesiastical tradition after the bloody Huguenot Wars of 1562–98. The conversion of King Henry IV (of Navarre) from the Calvinist to the Catholic faith in 1593 was not the prelude to a comprehensive re-Catholization of France; rather, it ushered in the policy of religious tolerance that found its classic expression in the Edict of Nantes of 1598. Wherever it was rigorously implemented, the CounterReformation almost completely destroyed any structures of modern capitalism that had existed in the regions that remained Catholic. In comparison, the Calvinist spirit of terrestrial asceticism and merit promoted a dynamic spirit of enterprise in those lands where it prevailed. An impulse of this kind was lacking in Lutheran 44\n\nregions, which persisted in the traditional corporative order and its correspondingly conservative economic practices. The principles of traditional economic life were based not upon notions of individual risk, enterprise, and continually increasing profit margins, but upon the satisfaction of habitual, class-oriented needs and a just price. In this respect, Lutherans differed less from the Catholics than from the Calvinists.35\n\nIn questions of internal political order in Germany, the confessional differences were rather minor. The governments of the Calvinistic territories were as authoritarian as those of the Lutheran and Catholic lands. However, the fact that the Religious Peace of Augsburg did not recognize the Calvinists as a confession meant that German Calvinism as a whole differed markedly in its political profile from that of English or Dutch Calvinism. It was thus no coincidence that the impulse to alter the confessional status quo for the benefit of the Evangelicals in The Confessional Divide the first decades after 1555 proceeded not from a Lutheran, but from a Calvinist princedom, the Palatine electorate. The Palatinate thus advanced to the position of adversary against the most energetic of the Catholic imperial estates, Bavaria, where the CounterReformation held sway. The Calvinists began to gain ground when they were joined by a few smaller territories and one larger one, Hesse-Kassel, in the course of the so-called ‘Second Reformation’. The balance of power in Protestant Germany shifted even more significantly in 1613, when the elector of Brandenburg, John Sigismund, converted from the Lutheran to the Reformed confession. This was an event with long-term consequences to which we shall devote more attention 45\n\nbelow. The Catholic imperial estates rallied around the duke of Bavaria, the Protestant estates around the elector of the Palatinate. A Protestant defensive alliance, the ‘Union’, was founded in 1608, in the next year the counter-alliance of the ‘Catholic League’. The opposition of the confessions could turn into a new military conflict at any time. When Emperor Matthias prepared to rescind the religious freedom his brother and predecessor, Rudolf II, had granted to the primarily Protestant estates of Bohemia and Moravia, that time had come. The Thirty Years War began in Prague in May of 1618.36\n\nThis war was never simply a religious war, whether in its first phases, the ‘Bohemian-Palatine War’ of 1618–23 and the ‘DanishLower Saxon War’ of 1625–9, or later during the ‘Swedish War’ of 1630–5 or the ‘Swedish-French War’ of 1635–48. The marked participation of foreign powers aroused a imperial-patriotic reaction of protest in the empire, a reaction directed at first primarily against Habsburg-ruled Spain, the military ally of the Habsburg emperor, Ferdinand II, and the Catholic League. A pamphlet of 1620, invoking the old doctrine of the four world empires, charged the Spanish with seeking to erect a fifth monarchy, one that would cover the earth. This was an offence against the divine order, according to which the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation was the fourth and last of the world empires. Imperial patriotism reached its high point in 1635 at the time of the Peace of Prague, which the emperor concluded first with electoral Saxony, then with most of the other Protestant estates, primarily in northern Germany. Yet the attempt to establish a ‘German peace’ came to nothing. Already that same year, 46\n\nCatholic France intervened in the conflict on the side of Lutheran Sweden, that is, on the confessionally ‘wrong’ side. Power politics won a decisive victory over the religious controversy.37\n\nThe Thirty Years War lived on in the collective memory of the Germans for a long time. It was considered the national catastrophe, a standing that was not contested until the period of the two world wars of the twentieth century, especially the second. It was a catastrophe primarily in its demographic, economic, social, and moral consequences. Large areas of Germany would not recover from its three decades of murder and pillage until the following century; some took even longer, others never recovered at all. The peasants were impoverished; in the east of Germany, many of them fell into subjection under the manorial lords. The destruction of countless cities ended the rise of the bourgeoisie for a long time to come. From a sociological point of view, the victors of the war were the landed aristocracy; the part of the nobility close to the government; state-supported merchants, entrepreneurs, and bankers; the military, and the governmental officials—all pillars of the emerging absolutist system. The horrors of war, mass mortality, and deprivation prompted the survivors to retreat into inwardness and brought about a renewal of lay piety that prepared the way for the Pietist movement of the late seventeenth and the eighteenth centuries in Evangelical Germany. If one can speak of any positive effect of the Thirty Years War, it would be an insight into the absolute necessity of religious tolerance—a tolerance that could only be enforced by a strong state willing to secularize itself within certain limits and thereby to become neutral in religious matters. Not least among the causes of 47\n\nprincely absolutism was an absolutist attitude in matters of faith: the subjects paid for their greater freedom in the inner realm with an increase in political subjection to the secular authorities. The latter found the most dependable support for their power in the profound, traumatic fear that must be considered the lasting effect of the Thirty Years War: the fear of chaos and the collapse of societal order, of foreign bands of soldiers, of civil and fratricidal war—the fear of the Apocalypse.38\n\nThe Peace of Westphalia of 1648 (concluded in Münster between the Reich and France, in Osnabrück between the Reich and Sweden) restored the Religious Peace of Augsburg of 1555, extending it to those of the Reformed confession, which was now granted equal rights as a Protestant observance. The geographic boundaries between the confessions, as well as their membership, were fixed according to the state of things in the year 1624. From this date forward, subjects were no longer required to convert to a new confession in the event that their ruling sovereign decided to do so. The northern part of the Netherlands and the Swiss confederates left the Reich for good. France took over the sovereign jurisdiction of Alsace from Austria, definitively weakening the position of the Habsburgs in Germany. The treaty confirmed Bavaria’s entitlement to the Palatine electorate (acquired in 1623) and the Upper Palatinate. A new, eighth electoral title was created for the Rhenish Palatinate. The peace treaty recognized the imperial estates’ right to co-determination in all affairs of the Reich, full territorial sovereignty in secular and religious matters, and the right to enter into alliances with foreign powers—restricted only by a clause forbidding such alliances to be directed against the 48\n\nemperor or the Reich, a proviso difficult to enforce. In order to prevent the formation of an adversarial quorum, the Evangelical and Catholic estates formed separate deliberative bodies (the Corpus evangelicorum and Corpus catholicorum) at the Imperial Diet, which in 1663 was transformed into a permanent congress of delegates convening in Regensburg. Decisions could be made only when this itio in partes reached an agreement.39\n\nOn the international stage, France and Sweden emerged as victors from the Thirty Years War. Both countries guaranteed the peace treaty, which was declared the basic law of the Reich. Both were able to extend their territory at the expense of the Reich; Sweden, in fact, which acquired West Pomerania and Rügen among The Austro-Prussian Antagonism other territories, advanced to the status of an imperial estate (Reichsstand). Inside Germany, the winners were the imperial estates. In consequence of the Peace of Westphalia, they were able to take the decisive step to full sovereignty. After 1648, the Holy Roman Empire was no longer a factor in European power politics. Because it helped to stabilize the status quo, its preservation lay in the interest both of the European powers and the smaller imperial estates. As an unwieldy, archaic, and outmoded structure, however, the Reich bore no comparison with the states of France or England, Spain or Sweden. It was the ‘irregular and monster-like body’ (irregluare aliquod corpus et monstro simile) described in 1667 by Samuel Pufendorf in his\n\nfamous work about the constitution of the German empire.40\n\nTHE AUSTRO-PRUSSIAN ANTAGONISM 49\n\nWe turn now to the third of the basic factors shaping German history, the opposition between Austria and Prussia. That Austria and Prussia, the two most important states to emerge from the medieval German colonization of middle and eastern Europe, were able to advance to the status of European great powers was due to the fact that both of them included significant territories not belonging to the Reich. The Austrian Habsburgs, who had assumed the emperorship for the first time in 1273 and held it from 1438 onwards without interruption, acquired the Netherlands and the Free Margravate of Burgundy through marriage in the second half of the fifteenth century. The lordship over Spain and its border territories, along with Naples and the American colonies, were added at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The dynastic link with Spain was preserved after the abdication of Charles V in 1556, when the title of Emperor was transferred to his brother, Ferdinand I, the lordship over Spain, the Free Margravate of Burgundy, and the Netherlands to his son, King Philip II. In the long view, the acquisition of the Bohemian and Hungarian crowns in 1526 was even more important. To be sure, under Ferdinand I most of Hungary was lost to the Turks, who had continued to advance through the Balkan peninsula after their conquest of Constantinople (and thus the Byzantine Empire) in 1453. Nonetheless, the Turkish threat was also ideologically and materially profitable for the Austrians. After the first Turkish siege of Vienna in 1529, Austria could claim to be defending the Reich— indeed, the whole of the occident—against the Ottomans and Islam. After the second siege of Vienna in 1683, the tide turned: Hungary was taken from the Turks, falling in 1699 to the House of 50\n\nHabsburg along with Transylvania and large parts of Slovenia and Croatia. Austria had become a great power. It was able to maintain this status even after the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1700, occasioned by the extinction of the Spanish line of the Habsburgs. Although Louis XIV of France managed to break open the Habsburg encirclement and place his grandson, Philip of Anjou, on the Spanish throne, the Peace of Utrecht (1713) precluded the unification of Spain with France. In the same year, Emperor Charles VI determined his own succession in the Pragmatic Sanction: his oldest daughter, Maria Theresa, was to inherit the Habsburg possessions undivided. After long and difficult negotiations, the emperor’s resolution was eventually recognized by the Habsburg hereditary lands, Hungary, and finally by the other great powers of Europe. In October 1740, Maria Theresa assumed the throne—almost at the same time as her great rival, King Frederick II, came to power in Prussia. ‘Prussia’ (Preussen or Pruzzen) was originally the name of a Baltic tribe that lived in the territory of later East Prussia during the early and high Middle Ages. German colonization of this area began under the auspices of the Teutonic Order, whose help the Polish duke Conrad of Masovia solicited in 1225 against the heathen Prussians. After its military decline in the fifteenth century, the Teutonic Order was able to maintain only a part of its territory as a Polish fief. Polish sovereignty was preserved when Albert of Brandenburg, Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and follower of Luther, negotiated with Poland to transform the Teutonic state into the Grand Duchy of Prussia, which occurred in 1525. The duchy was bequeathed in 1618 to Brandenburg, where 51\n\nthe Hohenzollerns had been ruling as margraves and electors since 1415. In 1660 the Great Elector, Frederick William (1640–88), successfully asserted his right to the sovereignty of the Duchy of Prussia, which nonetheless remained outside the Holy Roman Empire. On 18 January 1701, Frederick III, son of the Great Elector, had himself crowned Frederick I, ‘King in Prussia’, in Königsberg with the assent of Emperor Leopold I. This did not yet make Brandenburg-Prussia into a great power, but it was a significant step along the way to this goal. Unlike those of the Habsburgs, the subjects of the Hohenzollerns were almost exclusively German-speaking (the Masurians, who spoke a Polish dialect, were Evangelical, and for this reason alone did not consider themselves Poles). The other major difference between Austria and Prussia was confessional: the Habsburgs and most of their subjects were Catholic, the Hohenzollerns Protestant. The rulers of Brandenburg, however, represented a special case. In 1613 Elector John Sigismund converted from the Lutheran to the Reformed confession. Since his subjects (with the exception of the Calvinists and the Catholics on the lower Rhine) remained Lutheran, the Hohenzollerns were compelled to adopt a tolerant attitude in questions of religious observance. But that was not the only effect of the elector’s conversion. In\n\nhis Geschichte der preussischen Politik*, Johann Gustav Droysen\n\nnoted in 1870 that while John Sigismund’s conversion to Calvinism was certainly sincere, his new confession was ‘not only of religious significance’.41 Otto Hintze went even further in his 1931 essay ‘Kalvinismus und Staatsräson in Brandenburg zu Beginn des 17.\n\n52\n\nJahrhunderts’.† Taking up ideas from Max Weber’s famous study of the links between Calvinism and the ‘spirit of capitalism’, Hintze enquired about the ‘elective affinity’ between Calvinism and Staatsräson, ‘reasons of state’. His answer was that Calvinism was ‘the midwife that brought the Staatsräson of Brandenburg politics into the world’. It served as a ‘bridge, over which the Staatsräson of western Europe was introduced into Brandenburg’, the long-term effects of which was ‘a basic political orientation towards the west’, primarily towards the Netherlands and France. The result was paradoxical. According to Hintze, Calvinism served to strengthen the power of the monarchy—in contrast to its usual function in world history, that of arousing the estates to a spirit of rebellion against heterodox princes. This function was in no way lacking; but in order to recognize it, one must consider the other front of the territorial power of the princes, that facing the imperial power. In this respect, German Calvinism, too, aroused and led the opposition of the imperial estates against the Catholic emperor. Frederick II also stood in this tradition, in Hintze’s view: It is true that Frederick the Great exchanged the religious attitude for a purely secular Realpolitik in his political testaments. Nonetheless, upon closer examination it is clear that the impulses of this enlightened sovereign—his categorical imperative of duty, his ascetic devotion to his profession, and his transcendental interpretation of the majesty of the state as an entity standing above its ruler—all came from a soul in which the religious 53\n\nmotivations of his predecessors had been secularized, transformed, as it were, into a worldly form, without being merely derivative of, or completely explainable in terms of, the rationalism of the Enlightenment.42\n\nIt was only short step from the astute perceptions of the historian Hintze to an even bolder thesis proposed by the economist Alfred Müller-Armack. In his 1941 book Genealogie der Wirtschaftsstile* (hardly a line of which intimates the period in which it was written), the creator of the concept of the ‘social market economy’ wrote that the importance of the year 1613 lay in the fact that, at that time, Brandenburg-Prussia imposed ‘a Reformed upper class upon a Lutheran lower class’. Normally Calvinism had a liberalizing effect in a purely Calvinist environment. However, as the example of Brandenburg governmental and economic policy shows, the alliance between the Lutheran lower classes and an ascetically-minded upper class fortified Lutheran state ideology with a governmental discipline from above. This combination of Lutheranism and Calvinism, unique in world history, determined the structure of the Prussian administration and economic policy in the seventeenth century and played a major role in shaping the Prussian state style. A Lutheran country with a Calvinist apex—here was a distinctly new state structure, one that was neither Calvinist nor Lutheran. In a process of mutual assimilation, Calvinism from above and Lutheranism from below, something incomparably new came into being.43\n\nBoth Hintze’s and Müller-Armack’s theses have given rise to 54\n\ncriticism on points of detail. Nonetheless, they place the paradoxical phenomenon of Prussia in the greater historical context in which we must view it. With regard to Brandenburg’s pretensions to the succession of the extinct ducal house of Jülich and of the Duchy of Prussia, Hintze himself spoke of the ‘fateful question’ of whether Brandenburg should orient itself toward the west or toward the east. ‘In the east, it was better served by Lutheranism, in the west by Calvinism.’ The conversion of 1613 can be interpreted as a decision for the west, but only in terms of the greater European political context and the organization of the government. The sovereign’s Calvinist turn facilitated the integration of the new, mostly Reformed estates and subjects in Cleves, Mark, and Ravensburg, the territories of the Duchy of Jülich granted to Brandenburg by the Treaty of Xanten in 1614. In the Margravate of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia, in comparison, the loyalty of the estates and subjects could only be assured at the price of abandoning any denominational coercion. An attempt to introduce the Reformed confession into these regions would have failed, in Hintze’s words, ‘by dint of the socioeconomic structure of these East Elbian territories with their manorial estates. Lutheranism was well-suited to this structure, Calvinism not in the slightest’.44\n\nThus the east–west dichotomy within Prussia that shaped the nineteenth century—the disjuncture between the economically advanced, already partly industrialized, ‘bourgeois’ west and the manorial, ‘feudal’ east—was already emerging at the beginning of the seventeenth century. With regard to German-speaking countries as a whole, the manorial system (Gutsherrschaft) was a distinctly 55\n\nEast Elbian phenomenon, one that had been developing since the late Middle Ages. A formerly free peasantry was not only compelled to do socage for the aristocratic lord, as in the other parts of feudal Germany; they were also reduced to a particular form of serfdom, inherited servitude (Erbuntertänigkeit). This was only possible because the manorial lords, the Junkers, were able to appropriate wide-ranging legal competencies from the territorial sovereign, giving them powers of jurisdiction and law enforcement well beyond those of the manorial police. The result was a transformation of the manor into a self-enclosed political entity, its lord into a sovereign authority in his own right. For Lutherans, it was self-evident that this authority had no less a claim to their obedience than the territorial lord. The proximity of throne and altar at the apex of the state found its parallel at a lower level in the relationship between the manorial lord and ‘his’ parson.45\n\nThe intensification of manorial authority went hand in hand with the extension of manorial boundaries. After the Junkers succeeded in wresting the grain trade from the cities, permanently weakening the East Elbian bourgeoisie, they also sought to increase their cultivable lands at the expense of the peasantry. Even in the sixteenth century, the eviction of peasants and appropriation of their lands, a phenomenon known as Bauernlegen, was widespread in eastern Germany; it increased in the wake of the Thirty Years War. East of the Elbe, practically the only peasants left after the great conflict were those reduced to a permanent and hereditary bondage to the soil. This serfdom made the agrarian society of East Elbia more ‘eastern’ in character, that is, more like eastern Europe. This process was the The Austro-Prussian Antagonism converse of the 56\n\nwesternization of Brandenburg-Prussia in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In the latter case, the transformation involved completely different aspects of society: the governmental administration and the judicial system were modernized according to west European models. Trade, artisan industry, and science were fostered and promoted, and religious tolerance was secured.46\n\nThe social power of the Junkers did not always translate into political power. The Great Elector, creator of the standing army, had fought fiercely against the estates and thus against the political aspirations of the manorial lords. His grandson, the ‘Soldier-King’ Frederick William I (1713–40), transferred the holdings of the nobility into the possession of the state whenever he could. In 1733 he divided the country into levying districts or cantons firmly delimited from each other, and built the army upon this structure. The Junkers formed the officer corps; the soldiers were peasants. In compensation for their duties to the state, the peasantry was granted a certain amount of protection from the Junkers. The manorial lords were no longer permitted to take away the lands of ‘their’ peasants. Frederick II (1740–86) adopted a radically different policy with regard to the nobility. Whereas his ancestors, beginning with the Great Elector, had curtailed the power of the manorial lords, under Frederick a process of re-feudalization took place. The Junkers were granted sweeping privileges: the middle classes were no longer allowed to purchase noble estates, and the government granted credit to economically struggling manors. These material benefits were only one part of the historical\n\n57\n\ncompromise with the nobility that supported the rule of Frederick II. Politically, too, the Junkers gained influence on all levels. Their increase in power has been aptly described by Otto Büsch: The Junker’s secure position on the landed estate and in the officers’ corps was the guarantee of his political power. His control over the peasants and the local administration as manorial lord, his position as head of the district [Landrat], his influence on the government through the Landschaften [The district credit institutes (H.A.W.)], were the guarantee of his political security. They qualified him for a leading role in the military system. As an officer, he controlled the canton and the garrison, enjoyed a societal status higher than that of every civilian, and was appointed not only head of the district, but also to higher—indeed the highest —offices in the civil administration. Called to the dominant positions in government and society, the Prussian aristocrat enjoyed almost unlimited power in both spheres—that is, as long as he continued to perform his duties within the military system. The service of the Junker was the state’s stipulation for the guarantee of his power, the guarantee, in turn, necessary for the Junker’s fulfilment of his service. The Junker used the levers of power in the state, and the state used the Junker. The old Prussian military system was a comprehensive social system with a basic political character.47\n\nThis social militarization of Prussia so fittingly characterized by Büsch did not originate in the personal predilections of the electors and kings. It was primarily a consequence of the extreme\n\n58\n\ngeographical division of the Prussian territories and their resulting military vulnerability. The spirit of discipline and subordination, the very condition of Prussia’s rise, was the answer to a challenge. This answer was one-sided and required correction. By dint of its origins, Prussia was forced to a greater extent than other powers to become a soldier-state. Yet it could only assert itself successfully in the long term by overcoming the hardness and harshness that resulted from the internalization of external coercion. The internalization of ‘Prussiandom’ was, to a great degree, the achievement of Pietism. The roots of this devotional movement reached back to the period of the Thirty Years War. With their appeal for a renewal of the church from within, the Pietists were reacting against the orthodox petrifaction within Lutheranism, indeed against every kind of fixation on the external aspects of dogma. In Brandenburg-Prussia, the separation from official Lutheranism formed a bridge between the Pietists and the Calvinist authorities. This relationship was further supported by the Prussian Pietists’ great interest in the reform of the schools and higher institutions of learning, efforts that found their classic expression in the Franckeschen Stiftungen, a series of educational foundations established in Halle by August Hermann Francke, and in the founding of a Reform-oriented university in the same city in 1694. Never were the ‘quiet people of the land’ so near to the throne as they were under the Soldier-King. A Pietistically informed ethos of the state outlasted the reign of Frederick William I, a territorial patriotism that raised the subjects’ devotion and love towards the sovereign to the status of a religious duty.48\n\nReligion was also the ultimate source of the economic prosperity 59\n\nBrandenburg-Prussia experienced in the eighteenth century thanks to the Huguenots. Immediately after Louis IV rescinded the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the Great Elector promulgated the Edict of Potsdam, which invited the persecuted French Calvinists to Brandenburg. Approximately 20,000 followed this call. More than a quarter of them settled in Berlin, where French immigrants formed almost a fifth of the population in 1700. In artisan crafts, trade, and manufactures, the Huguenots introduced into Prussia the dynamic economic ethos that so often went hand in hand with the Calvinist religion. Yet Calvinists also excelled in academic professions. Indeed, wherever they became active, they contributed decisively to the very thing the naturally poor country of Brandenburg, the ‘sandbox of the Holy Roman Empire’, needed above all else: modernization.49\n\nSystematic government support of trade, crafts, and industry; extension of roads and highways; cultivation and settlement of moorlands and wastelands; fostering of the sciences, and religious tolerance—these were the achievements by virtue of which eighteenth-century Brandenburg earned the reputation of marching in the avant-garde of progress. These things were only possible because the energetic rulers of the house of Hohenzollern had an army of disciplined officials at their service. Frederick William I had created the institutional framework, a rationally organized apparatus of governmental offices with the General-Ober-FinanzKriegs- und Domänendirektorium (commonly known as the General Directory) at the top. The central administration, organized partly along departmental, partly along geographic lines, performed with such effectiveness that by the middle of the eighteenth century the 60\n\nabsolutist Hohenzollern state came to be considered the model of efficient government throughout all of Europe.50\n\nThe same could hardly be said of Austria at that time. The Reich’s most powerful estate contrasted sharply with BrandenburgPrussia in a number of areas. The religious compromise set down in the Peace of Westphalia was not recognized in the Habsburg crown lands. In the course of a forceful re-Catholization, initiated long before 1648, far more that 100,000 Protestants fled from Habsburg-ruled territories, an intellectual and economic loss from which Austria never recovered. The Hohenzollerns did not merely promulgate religious pluralism, they also practised it; the Habsburgs, in contrast, imposed confessional homogeneity. Part and parcel of the Catholic absolutism of Austria was a rigorous system of censorship, in comparison to which Brandenburg-Prussia seemed like a haven of intellectual freedom. Although under Maria Theresa (1740–80) the administration of censorship was removed from the hands of the church, it was also bureaucratically systematized in the process. The spirit of the Enlightenment, which found a home in the Prussian universities, found in Austria only barricades raised against its entry. But Prussia and Austria also shared structural similarities. Austria, too, can be called a military state. As under the Hohenzollerns, the army became the most important agent in the process of state centralization. And like the Hohenzollerns, if somewhat later, the Habsburgs suppressed the influence of the estates. This was necessary in order to avoid permanently falling behind other states, especially Brandenburg-Prussia. Even under Charles VI, the Habsburg territorial mass represented more an 61\n\nalliance of corporative states (Ständestaaten) with a monarchical tip than a modern state entity. When Maria Theresa and her ministers undertook a comprehensive reform of the government administration in the early 1740s, they consciously oriented themselves on the model of Prussia. The result was an absolutist state with highly concentrated apparatus of power, less centralized than Prussia but no less bureaucratic.51\n\nThe antagonism between the Catholic Habsburgs and the Evangelical Hohenzollerns had long since ceased to be a religious conflict when war began between the two countries in 1740, a few months after Frederick II came to power and a few weeks after Maria Theresa assumed the throne. The first war, over Silesia, was begun by Frederick II, for both reasons of personal ambition and reasons of state. Exploiting the weakness of Vienna after the death of Charles VI, Frederick sought by the conquest of Austrian Silesia to expand the territory, fortify the economy, and elevate the political status of Prussia to that of a European great power. Silesia did become Prussian, and Prussia in turn a great power. By the time these results were sanctioned by the Peace of Hubertusberg in 1763, however, Frederick’s state had already experienced two wars, the latter of which—the Seven Years War—might just as easily have ended with Prussia’s downfall. With respect to method, Frederick’s style of power politics hardly differed from that of other sovereigns like Louis XIV of France or Charles XII of Sweden. The same can even be said of the most reprehensible of his deeds, his cooperation in the first dismembering of Poland in 1772. What set the Prussian king apart was the glaring discrepancy between his resources and his risks. In 62\n\n1740 Brandenburg-Prussia was still a geographically fragmented and fragile entity. Again and again, Frederick was willing to risk everything, and was ultimately saved only by pure chance, an incident that went down in history as the ‘miracle of the House of Brandenburg’—the death of Frederick’s most dangerous enemy, Elisabeth, Empress of Russia, in January 1762. The ultimate success of his radical brinkmanship turned Frederick into a legend. His example, however, also promised disaster.52\n\nFrederick could not have earned the nickname ‘the Great’ had he been nothing more than a successful military leader. In the Europe of his day, he was rightly considered the representative— indeed the very embodiment—of a new type of government, enlightened absolutism. His programme of rationalism imposed from the top down differed fundamentally from the typical narrow self-interest of other absolutist rulers. Even during Frederick’s lifetime, the phrase travailler pour le roi de Prusse (‘to work for the King of Prussia’) meant to do something for its own sake. However, the thing done had to be reasonable, and that meant in the interest of the state. And the ruler-philosopher of Sanssouci, who considered himself the first servant of the state, seemed to guarantee that this was indeed the case. Frederick opened his country to western ideas and prompted a kind of cultural revolution. At the same time, he restored privileges to the aristocracy, whom he could not otherwise lastingly integrate into his military machine. In so doing, he again pushed Prussian society a stretch towards the east, in the direction of an autocracy supporting itself upon nobility and serfdom. Prussia under Frederick I was more bourgeois in character than Russia, but in 63\n\ncomparison with France, which was such an intellectual model for Frederick, it seemed almost a country without a middle class. A comparison within the Reich leads to similar findings: Frederick’s Prussia was far less bourgeois than most other states, above all in the western and southern parts of Germany, although it was not as feudal in character as the two duchies in Mecklenburg. According to a saying widely attributed to Mirabeau, but actually from an eighteenth-century German military historian, Georg Heinrich von Behrenhorst, ‘The Prussian monarchy is not a country with an army, but an army with a country, in which it is only quartered, so to speak.’ Although it is true that all absolutist states were also military states, Prussia was especially militarized. In mid-eighteenth-century Austria, for example, one inhabitant in sixty was a soldier; in Prussia, the ratio was one out of every thirteen. In the hierarchy of public interests and needs, those of the military stood just as high under the reign of Frederick II as under his father, the Soldier-King.53\n\nThe primacy of the military, as well as the entitlement of the nobility to which it was intimately linked, prevented the full realization of the rule of law within the government. Nonetheless, Prussia under Frederick continually strove in this direction. Great progress was made in the standardization of the legal system. The administration of justice through governmental offices was restricted, and a new code of procedure, the Codex Fridericianus, streamlined legal proceedings and made them more transparent. The crowning achievement was the Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preussischen Staaten (General Law for the Prussian States or ‘Prussian Code’), which was completed in 1791, five years after 64\n\nFrederick’s death. As Reinhart Koselleck observes, the Prussian Code was Janus-faced: In theory, it aimed at a legal system that was far in advance of the reality of the day, while in practice it codified this reality in a plenitude of statutes that ultimately stood in the way of the planned system, if they did not contradict it outright. The Prussian Code represented a compromise between tradition-informed reality and future-oriented objective.54\n\nThe French political thinker Alexis de Tocqueville argued much the same way in 1856 in the appendix to his work L’ Ancien Régime et la Révolution*. Concerning the Prussian Code, Tocqueville wrote: ‘Beneath this completely modern head we will see a totally gothic body appear; Frederick had only eliminated from it whatever could hinder the action of his own power; and the whole forms a monstrous being which seems to be in transition between one shape and another.’55\n\nAlthough enlightened absolutism was not unique to Prussia, in certain respects it was unique to the German-speaking lands of Europe. Its other classic representative was Maria Theresa’s son Joseph II. From 1765 to 1780 co-regent with his mother, then, after her death in 1780, alone determining the fortunes of the Austrian and Habsburg lands until 1790, Joseph went much further than his model Frederick in many ways. He ended serfdom in Bohemia, Moravia, and the south-west tip of Silesia remaining to Austria; he reformed both civil and criminal law in the spirit of the Enlightenment; he placed the school system completely under the 65\n\nauspices of the state; and he granted to non-Catholics full rights of citizenship as well as the right to exercise their religion in private. However, Joseph faced stiff resistance from the Hungarians when, in his continuing effort to unify and standardize the administration of Habsburg lands, he tried to replace Latin with German as the official language of government and business in Hungary. His attempt to incorporate the church completely into the service of the state, which involved the dissolution of many monasteries, provoked internal unrest. Shortly before his death, Joseph was compelled to revoke a number of his own measures. Other of his reforms were rescinded by his brother and successor, Leopold II (1790–2).56\n\nAlthough certain aspects of ‘Josephinism’ survived, all in all the ‘revolution from above’ failed in Austria. Together with the clergy, with whom it sympathized, the Catholic population rejected enlightened absolutism. Here was a major difference vis-À-vis Prussia. There, the Calvinism of the upper classes had cleared the way for the development of enlightened absolutist rule. Frederick’s reforms provoked no Lutheran reaction from below. In contrast to Joseph, who remained a committed Catholic, the free-thinking Frederick did not even attempt to challenge the religious feelings of his subjects. In contrast to ‘Old Fritz’, who was extremely popular due to his military exploits, Joseph never found his way into the hearts of his people. And the sentiments inside each ruler’s country were also mirrored abroad. This brings us to the question of how the Prussian–Austrian antinomy affected the way the Germans saw themselves.\n\n66\n\nCOSMOPOLITANS AND PATRIOTS ‘And so I, too, was a fan of Prussia, or, actually, of Fritz*—for what did we care about Prussia?’ Thus wrote Goethe in Dichtung und\n\nWahrheit†, looking back on his childhood memories from the time of the Seven Years War. To be fritzisch meant to take sides against ‘outmoded ways’ and for an enlightened government. Such an attitude was certainly more common among the middle classes of an Evangelical free imperial city like Frankfurt am Main, Goethe’s birthplace, than among Catholic peasants in Bavaria, for example. Yet even in Goethe’s family there were proponents of Austria. The poet’s grandfather, Johann Wolfgang Textor, took part in the imperial crowning ceremony of Francis I, the husband of Maria Theresa, in Frankfurt in 1745, where he helped carry the baldachin of the coronation. As a rule, the older, conservative generation supported Maria Theresa, the younger, more progressive folk endorsing Frederick.57\n\nHowever, the two monarchs’ strongest support was in their respective countries, of course. The wars that took place in 1740– 63 represented an important factor in shaping political identity. They fostered feelings of belonging and allegiance—feelings in which, since they were primarily directed at the state, the patriarch or matriarch of the country played a central yet supra-personal role. The King of Prussia (Frederick was the first to use this title, and under him Prussia first became the name of the whole state) stood at the head of subjects who began to consider themselves Prussians. In 1761 the Enlightenment thinker Thomas Abbt, a ‘Prussian by choice’ from the free imperial city of Ulm, spoke of 67\n\nPrussia as a ‘nation’ in his work Vom Tode für das Vaterland.† According to Abbt, the answer to the question ‘What is one’s native country?’ was not necessarily answered by the simple fact of one’s birthplace. Rather, citizenship was a matter of free decision. ‘But when birth or my free resolution unify me with a country, to whose holy laws I place myself in subjection, laws that take from me no more of my freedom than is necessary for the good of the whole\n\ncountry—at this moment do I call this country my Fatherland.’58 For Austria, on the other hand, the word ‘nation’ could not be used; the term connoted a commonality of language that did not exist in the multi-ethnic Habsburg empire. The rule of the Habsburgs had long since extended beyond the borders of Ger"
