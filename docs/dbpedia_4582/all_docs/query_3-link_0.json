The police force is in a desolate state. Many officers had lost their lives in the war, were in Allied prison camps or had fled in the expectation of being held accountable for crimes against humanity committed during the National Socialist era. The security situation in the country is difficult. Poverty causes thefts, robberies and homicides and marauding groups of released forced laborers with captured Wehrmacht weapons make the streets unsafe. Averting danger places high demands on the remaining police: everywhere there are buildings in danger of collapse, unexploded bombs, grenades and impassable roads. Against this backdrop and while at the same time filtering out \"National Socialist elements\" in the police force, the military government tries to recruit police officers who are physically and mentally suitable for the job and at the same time not too strongly infiltrated by the ideas of the defunct Hitler regime. However, the profession of police officer is unattractive at this time. The pay and reputation of the police were low, many police families lived in abject poverty and there was a lack of vehicles, weapons, premises and everything else needed for effective police work.\n\n1945\n\n1. May, 17. In Minden, an auxiliary police officer and a police volunteer are killed by a gang of Poles with submachine guns and hand grenades. Two other auxiliary police officers manage to escape. According to Allied regulations, the officers had to carry out their duties unarmed.\n\n2. September, 25. In the \"Guidelines of the Military Government on the Reorganization of the Police in the British Zone\", the British Military Government stipulates a fundamental change to the police in the British occupation zone. The following applies: The police in Germany, especially in the British occupation zone, are to be denazified, demilitarized, decentralized and disarmed. The police must no longer exercise any legislative or judicial powers. The training system is to be completely reoriented. The barracked police force shall be abolished.\n\n3. the police shall be transformed into a civilian institution. Each urban district with more than 100,000 inhabitants (SK police) and each administrative district (RB police) receives its own police force as part of decentralization: the local police authorities become the mayors and the regional presidents. In rural areas, there will be one police officer for 1,000 inhabitants, in cities one officer for 500 - 600 inhabitants, in Düsseldorf and Cologne one officer for 350 - 400 inhabitants. All police authorities must set up a criminal investigation department (CID).\n\n4. recruitment: \"zealous and active supporters\" of National Socialism may not be employed as police officers.\n\n5. a female police force, consisting of uniformed and criminal police, is to be set up in the municipal and district police forces. Women who are newly recruited to the police force must have a good school education (intermediate or higher school leaving certificate). They should be between 25 and 30 years of age, no shorter than 160 cm and without glasses. They must be single or widowed and, if possible, have previously worked in social care, nursing or as teachers. The uniformed female police should pay particular attention to male and female youths when on patrol, search and look after female prisoners and otherwise carry out investigations in uniform or plain clothes.\n\n6. a central police school for police instructors and senior officers is set up in Hiltrup. By September 1, 1945, 100 police school teachers are to be trained, followed by a further 70 per month. In the British occupation zone, five police schools are to be set up for law enforcement officers, which are to have trained 7,500 police officers after six months.\n\n7. arming: As part of the extensive disarmament of the police, only handguns are to be permitted for police officers. These will not be issued personally, but are to be kept at police stations. They may only be issued by the responsible officers in urgent cases. Weapons may only be available to 20% of all police officers. They are not to be carried during normal patrol duty.\n\n8. uniforms: Officers shall wear the existing gray-green uniforms until further notice. Nazi insignia must be removed. Ranks wear a chaco as headgear, officers a cap. Lower ranks must wear a number on their uniform for easier identification.\n\n9. water police. One of five groups of water police in the British occupation zone is set up in Cologne and one in Recklinghausen. The officers of the water police wear blue uniforms.\n\n10. The military government sets up a so-called \"coal police\" in the winter of 1945/46. Due to the mass theft of coal by the freezing population, freight trains and coal heaps are to be protected. Police applicants who are too young or too old according to the current recruitment criteria are used for the coal police. The officers stand guard at the entrances to collieries or patrol the colliery and railroad premises to protect the coal.\n\n1946\n\n11. February 15. Burglars kill a police officer. At around 4.00 a.m., police constable Ponwitz confronts two burglars in a grocery store on Kampstraße in Düsseldorf-Wersten. In the ensuing scuffle, one of the burglars shoots the officer dead. Ponwitz died shortly afterwards in hospital. Further investigations lead to the conviction of two suspects who confess to the murder of the police officer and more than 50 burglaries. They are sentenced to death by a British military court on May 21, 1946.\n\n12. July. The crime statistics for the North Rhine Province for the month of July 1946 show the following crimes: 22 murders, 118 robberies, 14,500 simple thefts, including 2,760 bicycle thefts, 3,100 field thefts and 12 narcotics offenses.\n\n13. August 23. The British military government decrees the dissolution of the Prussian provinces and the establishment of federal states by occupation decree. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia is initially formed from the former Rhine Province and the Province of Westphalia. In 1947, the district of Lippe-Detmold is incorporated. This gives the state its final territorial extension.\n\n14. August 29. Walter Menzel (SPD) becomes the first Minister of the Interior of the new federal state. Menzel, who holds a doctorate in law, joins the SPD in 1920, becomes a finance councillor in the Prussian Ministry of Finance and in 1931 district administrator in Weilburg an der Lahn. He was dismissed from office by the National Socialists in 1933. He subsequently worked as a lawyer. Between 1946 and 1950, he held the office of NRW Minister of the Interior, after which he remained a member of the state parliament until 1954. In 1951, he became a member of the Bundestag. He died on September 14, 1963.\n\n15. In December 1946, the North Rhine-Westphalian police force has a target strength of 21,350 officers. The actual strength (actual strength) is 18,178 officers.\n\n16. October, 1. The British military government merges the North Rhine Province Criminal Investigation Department (headed by Friedrich Grützmann) and the Westphalia Criminal Investigation Department (headed by Friedrich Karst) to form a state criminal investigation department in Düsseldorf. This was the forerunner of the State Office of Criminal Investigation. However, the State Office of Criminal Investigation does not initially have any investigative or executive tasks, but is merely an intelligence collection, evaluation and information office for the North Rhine-Westphalian police. The instructions for the establishment of this office stipulate, among other things, that a \"professional and habitual criminals' register\" and a \"collection of individual fingers, palms and crime scene traces\" are to be set up, that traveling offenders are to be recorded and - for the entire British occupation zone, which also includes Lower Saxony, Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein - a \"police registration sheet for the region\" is to be maintained. The first head of this authority is Friedrich Karst. Born in 1881, Karst first worked as a textile worker, then as a soldier during the First World War and, from 1919, as a police officer.\n\n17. November, 1. Dr. Siegfried Middelhaufe becomes the first head of the police department of the Ministry of the Interior.\n\n18. Problematic replacement for sirens. The police have to make do with old vehicles from before 1945 for motorized patrols. As these vehicles do not have sirens, makeshift sirens are introduced. In some district police authorities, the co-driver has to blow signals out of the open car window with a kind of shawm; in other authorities, signaling devices are installed on the vehicles where the co-drivers have to blow air in through a hose so that the signal sounds. The passenger seats in the official cars are not particularly popular with the officers, as it is difficult to drive on the bumpy, still war-damaged roads.The bumpy roads in North Rhine-Westphalia often caused tooth and lip injuries or caused the passengers to hyperventilate.\n\n19. Due to the Nazi past of many police officers and their consequent non-re-employment, there are bottlenecks in the recruitment of police officers. An instruction from the British military government stipulates that, after thorough examination and training, officers from the previous police force can be recruited, as can auxiliary police officers who have been temporarily employed. Furthermore, police officers and soldiers who had been removed from their posts by the National Socialists were seen as having politically reliable potential. Young civilians between the ages of 18 and 23 who are suitable for police service are also to be recruited.\n\n20. \"Technical Instruction No. 11\" of the British military government stipulates that firearms are not part of the standard equipment of police officers. They are only carried on night duty and during special operations. Ammunition is counted down to five cartridges and its consumption is to be strictly controlled by the Allied Public Safety Officer. The regulation meets with early criticism because many police leaders are of the opinion that it is not enough to control violent \"displaced persons\", the released forced laborers.\n\n21. In July 1946, Inspector General Halland ordered the police to wear a blue uniform throughout the British occupation zone. Previously, officers had only worn white armbands with the words \"Military Government Police\" or the old green Nazi uniforms. The green uniforms are now dyed blue or new blue uniforms are produced for the officers. By 1948, all officers are finally equipped with the blue uniform.\n\n1947\n\n22. North Rhine-Westphalia is granted police sovereignty by the British military government.\n\n23. The target number of police officers is 21,640, the actual number is 19,807.\n\n24. A decree issued by the Ministry of the Interior on 11.11.47 prohibits police officers from almost any political activity. Thus, no police officer may be a member of a political party, actively support a political party, influence other persons with regard to their party affiliation, participate in open political discussions, support a party by other means or hold conversations of a party-political nature in police stations.\n\n25. Due to massive unrest in Dortmund, Lünen and Castrop-Rauxel, the head of the Dortmund police orders that \"shaking and rifle squads\" are to be formed in the event of future mass unrest. If large crowds have not dispersed even after being warned, \"the shaking squad must take action against the mob\". The action must be short and hard, but the crowd must not be beaten unnecessarily. If the use of the Knüttel (note: wooden batons) is not sufficient, the rifle section must be deployed. Shots should not be fired indiscriminately into the crowd, but only aimed at the knees if possible. Children should not be shot at.\n\n26. The recruitment conditions for police candidates are revised. The following now applies: age must not be less than 20 years and not more than 30 years, the minimum height is 175 cm. In exceptional cases, applicants taller than 172 cm can also be recruited if they have above-average mental and physical abilities. Applicants should preferably be unmarried, and a good elementary school education should suffice. Furthermore, certificates, good character references, declarations of no debts and proof of good health must be provided. Refugees from the East must undergo an identification procedure. Former Wehrmacht officers and professional non-commissioned officers, former members of the police who were transferred to the Wehrmacht and members of the NSDAP and its subdivisions are excluded from recruitment. However, applicants who were classified in category V (unencumbered) as part of the denazification process or were born after 1.1.19 are excluded from this. Persecutees of the Nazi regime are to be given preference in recruitment.\n\n27. In almost 1,400 raids and searches against black market visitors and hoarders and 385 checks on railroad trains and access roads in 1947, the Düsseldorf police seize the following foodstuffs and luxury foods: 98 head of livestock, 8,400 kg of meat, sausage and bacon, 1,400 kg of butter and fat, 760 kg of flour and foodstuffs, 2,300 kg of sugar, 470 kg of coffee and tea and more than two million cigarettes and cigars. Private trade in foodstuffs and luxury foods is made a punishable offense under the War Economy Ordinance and the Consumption Regulation Penal Ordinance in order to ensure the state distribution of scarce foodstuffs.\n\n28. Unmarried police officers who have not yet reached the age of 25 must obtain official permission before getting married. Permission must only be granted if a child has already been born as a result of the marriage or is due to be born in the near future. Police officers who marry without official permission must expect to be dismissed from the police force.\n\n1948\n\n29. Medical examinations reveal that 50% of police officers in North Rhine-Westphalia are still suffering from malnutrition in 1948.\n\n30. \"The provisional recruitment conditions for the female police force in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia\" stipulate that, as in the past, female applicants must provide proof that they have completed training as welfare workers, youth leaders or teachers. In contrast to their male colleagues, female police officers are explicitly expected to have a \"high level of education\".\n\n31. Friedrich D'heil becomes the new head of the State Criminal Police Office.\n\n32. Metal thefts become an increasing problem and a larger field of work for the police. Drainpipes, heating systems, iron girders and other items are stolen everywhere and transported away on ladder trucks. The thieves obtain around 0.70 marks per kg of lead, 1.20 marks per kg of copper and up to 1.40 marks for bronze from so-called scrap dealers. In Cologne, officers from the uniformed police, the criminal investigation department and the telegraph offices carry out a major raid on scrap dealers on November 24. In the process, 14 dealers alone are found with material that can be identified as the property of the Post Office. The dealers' junk books are not properly kept and all dealers are brought before a magistrate. Criminal charges are brought against hundreds of dealers and metal thieves.\n\n33. The new permanent representative of the Minister of the Interior becomes State Secretary Dr. Wilhelm Rombach. Born in Monschau/Eifel in 1884, the lawyer is initially reinstated as Mayor of Aachen by the Allies after the end of the war. He had already held this office since 1928, but was then dismissed by the National Socialists as part of their political \"purges\".\n\n34. Karl Bremer becomes the first inspector of the NRW police force and takes up his post at the Ministry of the Interior in Düsseldorf. Bremer was born on October 9, 1895 in Solingen-Ohligs and took part in the First World War as a soldier from 1915 to 1918. In 1919, he was accepted into the police service as a lieutenant, promoted to captain of the protective police and finally removed from the service in 1933. In 1939, he was called up again as a soldier and took part in the war until the end. After the collapse, he initially belonged to the RB-Polizei in Düsseldorf until he was appointed to the Ministry of the Interior.\n\n35. July 22. The \"Association of Police Officers of North Rhine-Westphalia\" is founded after the Allies allow the formation of professional associations for police officers. At this time, however, regular trade unions are still prohibited for police officers.\n\n36. November 1. Herbert Kalicinski is appointed the first head of the Hiltrup Police Institute. During his term of office, he succeeds in persuading all federal states to provide uniform training for senior officers at the Police Institute.\n\n37. Almost 26,000 traffic accidents occur in NRW in 1948, in which around 17,000 people are injured and 1,625 people are killed.\n\n1949\n\n38. Retirement: The special provision for police officers in the German Police Officers Act of 1937, which provides for earlier retirement than for other civil servants, is no longer valid, as the Act is repealed by the austerity ordinance of 19.3.49. Police officers can now only retire when they reach the age of 65.\n\n39. January 29. Fatal accident on duty: Police constable Walter Hinz from the motorized platoon of the Düsseldorf RB police is killed in a traffic accident while on duty.\n\n40. April 26. The \"Carl Severing\" State Police School (LPS) in Münster is opened by Minister President Karl Arnold. In the presence of Interior Minister Dr. Menzel and the school's namesake, former Reich and State Minister Carl Severing, as well as numerous guests of honour, Arnold emphasizes that at the police school \"police officers will not only receive professional but also civic training\". This is a continuation of the police tradition of the Weimar Republic, whose creator was Carl Severing. Severing was \"touched and ashamed at the same time\" by this high degree of honor.\n\n41. May 9. Parliament passes the \"Act on the Provisional Organization of the Police\". The law repeals a transitional decree issued by the Allies. The key points of the law are: The police authorities are completely newly created by the Allies in 1945. They are not legal successors to the \"Himmler Police\". The organs of the police authorities are the police committees. They are responsible for personnel and economic matters - albeit in agreement with the British Military Government - and are made up of representatives from the city and district administrations. The police committee elects a \"Chief of Police\" (note: the term \"Chief of Police\" does not yet exist at this time and is replaced by \"Chief of Police\"). The Chief of Police is responsible for the deployment of police forces, as well as the appointment, promotion or dismissal of police officers up to the rank of police or criminal master. The police committee is responsible for all higher ranks. The police committees are not obliged to reinstate all former police officers. They decide who they wish to recruit. In the event of supra-local emergencies, the chief of the neighboring area is obliged to help. In the event of refusal or dispute, the Minister of the Interior must decide on assistance. The Minister of the Interior has the right to issue instructions to the police authorities.\n\n42. thefts by \"car jumpers\" are causing increasing work for the police, as cases of this type of crime are becoming more frequent. The perpetrators jump from a moving vehicle onto a truck and - unnoticed by the driver - throw parts of the load onto the road in order to collect and dispose of them. In the first half of 1949, several car-jumping gangs were successfully arrested in Cologne for throwing clothing, car tires, steel goods and food from trucks on a large scale. The crimes mostly took place at night. The Cologne police were able to catch the perpetrators by using patrol cars with neutral license plates that had been deployed on the affected country roads.\n\n43. After the Allies re-authorize boxing as a police sport, the police boxing championships are held in Düsseldorf at the beginning of April.\n\n44. The Düsseldorf police chief constable Heinz Westerteicher wins the German athletics championships in Nuremberg and becomes German champion. Two police officers also finish second and third in this discipline.\n\n45. The costs for the officers differ significantly in the individual police authorities. For example, the annual costs for the medical care of an officer in a government district authority (RB authority) average 36 marks, while a neighboring authority has to pay almost 43 marks. The cost of equipment and clothing for police officers varies between 266 marks and 400 marks.\n\n46. On 24.5.49, the newly founded \"Erich Klausener\" police school on the Tannenstraße site in Düsseldorf is assigned the tasks of training and further training for the security and criminal investigation police.\n\n47. The criminal investigation department is equipped with Belgian-made FN 7.65 millimeter pistols. The previously issued Smith & Wesson revolvers had proved to be unsuitable due to their size and weight. They could not be carried concealed due to their volume.\n\nFigure 2: Essen police detectives working on the reconstruction of their bomb-damaged headquarters in 1945 (source: Herstell)\n\n50s\n\nPolice work now increasingly takes place against the backdrop of a normalization of social and economic conditions. North Rhine-Westphalia - like the other areas under the control of the Western Allies - was experiencing an economic boom, from which police officers only benefited to a limited extent, however, as their pay was still low compared to many professions in the private sector. As a result, many young men look for jobs in mining or heavy industry rather than the \"coat of honor\" of the police. After the Allies initially refused to allow trade unions, the police union, which had emerged from the police officers' union, experienced a large increase in membership in the early 1950s. The most significant organizational change for the police was probably the transformation of the police forces, which were limited to municipalities and districts, into a state police force, which once again had central police facilities and police squads, after the Allies realized that a police force with very small organizational units could not effectively carry out law enforcement and avert danger. The sharp increase in motorized traffic in North Rhine-Westphalia plays a major role in police work. The material working conditions of the police are increasingly improving. Old police stations have been rebuilt, new ones have been built and numerous cars, motorcycles and special vehicles have been added to the police authorities' fleets. The training of young police officers still has a strong military character, so that the police officers' manners towards the population are repeatedly criticized against the background of a changed civil society.\n\n1950\n\n48. 7,500 police officers protest in Düsseldorf against their inadequate pay. The officers arrive in the state capital in special trains, buses, trucks and police cars from all over North Rhine-Westphalia. The officers calculate to the Minister of the Interior, who is present, that a single constable receives a monthly salary of 172 marks up to the 4th year of service and that his salary only increases by 9 pfennigs in the 5th year of service.\n\n49. visits to restaurants in uniform: The head of the SK police (district police) in Mülheim an der Ruhr issues an order prohibiting his officers from visiting restaurants in uniform. Officers in uniform are only allowed to visit pubs for official reasons, to eat meals or for joint events. The demand was met with indignation among Mülheim's civil servants. In a survey, two thirds of the officers speak out against the uniform ban.\n\n50. Prisoners of war police officers. In a resolution, the Association of Police Officers protests against the claim spread by the media and senior Russian government officials that all prisoners of war have been released from Russian captivity. According to eyewitnesses, several hundred thousand prisoners of war were still in Russian hands. Among them were around 50,000 German police officers who had been captured simply because they belonged to the police force during the Nazi era. An appeal is made to those responsible: \"Give us back our police officers who were prisoners of war and don't let them die of hunger in the vast steppes of Siberia\".\n\n51. April 1. In Mülheim, 37-year-old police sergeant Robert Reith is shot dead by members of the British stationing forces. Reith had come from a camaraderie party in a pub and had taken a seat on the back of a small truck with other police officers on his way home when he was shot by a soldier. The incident was preceded by an argument between the uniformed police officers and two soldiers who had also been in the pub. When one of the soldiers outside tried to prevent the truck from leaving, the vehicle pulled up. At that moment, the British man fired a shot in the direction of the vehicle, hitting Reith.\n\n52. July 27. Following a decision by the Federal Cabinet, all civil servants' salaries throughout Germany are to be cut by 3% in order to provide funds for civil servants from the former eastern territories and former Wehrmacht civil servants who have lost their posts. The decision triggers a wave of indignation among civil servants and employee representatives. The Association of Police Officers points out that \"the salaries of police officers are barely enough to cover the most basic necessities of life\" and that police officers have hardly any material assets.\n\n53. August 1. Interior Minister Walter Menzel is replaced in office by Karl Arnold (CDU). Karl Arnold's term of office ends just six weeks later, on September 15, 1950, when he is succeeded by Adolf Flecken (CDU). Born in 1901, Arnold first trained as a shoemaker and then as a workers' secretary. After Hitler's assassination attempt in 1944, he is arrested as a member of the resistance. In 1946, he became Lord Mayor of Düsseldorf and Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1947 to 1956. Between August and September, he also held the office of Minister of the Interior. Arnold dies in an accident on June 29, 1958. Born in 1889, Adolf Flecken completes a doctorate in 1913 after completing an apprenticeship as a businessman and studying law. After serving as a soldier in the First World War, a lawyer and a member of parliament for the Center Party (until 1933), he became a member of the North Rhine-Westphalian state parliament in 1949. Between 1950 and 1952, he was Minister of the Interior, then Minister of Finance for four years. Flecken dies on December 26, 1966.\n\n54. Police officers without driving licenses: The \"Association of Police Officers\" criticizes the fact that a large number of police officers do not have driving licenses for motor vehicles. Although the officers are authorized to intervene in road traffic and regulate traffic, they themselves do not have the licenses required to drive a motor vehicle. Problems arise where police officers are unable to use vehicles at their disposal to pursue hit-and-run drivers and criminals because they are not allowed to drive a vehicle themselves, that they are unable to move the vehicles of drunken drivers when preventing them from driving under the influence of alcohol or, as non-drivers, are required to assess the driving skills of people who themselves have a driving license. The professional association argues that officers should be required to obtain driving licenses within the police force.\n\n55. The Solingen police force receives a bonus of 10,000 marks from the state government because, according to this year's budget, it is the \"cheapest police force\" in the state. According to a decree from 1949, the Minister of the Interior can award such bonuses in agreement with the Minister of Finance. The measure is strongly criticized in the police force, as Solingen was only able to secure its low budget by having a particularly small number of police officers, which is at the expense of the safety of the population.\n\n56. September 14. The Police Union (GdP) is founded after the Allies lift the ban on police officers joining trade unions. The GdP, which emerged from the union-like Association of Police Officers founded after the war, has over 90% of all police officers in North Rhine-Westphalia as members. Fritz Schulte becomes the first chairman of the NRW-GdP.\n\n57. December 2. Fatal accident with personal involvement. There is a serious traffic accident involving a police motorcycle in Wickede. 57-year-old police sergeant August Richartz, Wickede police station, dies in the accident.\n\n1951\n\n58. January, 18. Police constable Werner Michalczik is shot dead in Gelsenkirchen. After he and his patrol colleague had checked two suspicious young men and taken one of them's ID, both were to be taken to the police station. One of the men suddenly pulled out a pistol, shot Michalczik in the head and took his ID card before fleeing. Only after he had shot the already dead officer again did he flee with his accomplice.\n\n59. May. A police radio control center is set up in Düsseldorf. This radio control center can now be used to contact the radio control centers of eight other federal states as well as the control centers of the district police authorities.\n\n60. February 17. The first new water police boat built after the war is launched in Cologne. After the officers of the \"Rhine\" water police section previously had to tackle the numerous criminals on the Rhine with a 2 hp cutter, the new, almost 16-metre-long boat is now equipped with a 175 hp engine and can travel at 20.5 km/h upstream and even 34 km/h downstream.\n\n61. The right way to address citizens: The trade press is concerned about how police officers should correctly address citizens they do not know. In the June issue of the magazine \"Die Polizei\" it says: \"How should a police officer address a strange lady or gentleman?\" The existing instructions \"Mein Herr\" and \"Meine Dame\" have largely proved their worth. \"Hello you\" should be rejected. The salutations \"Dear Madam\", \"Young Madam\", \"Mother\" and \"Little Mother\", which are common among police officers, are also not to be approved of. On the other hand, the form of address \"madam\" is not appropriate in all police situations. When addressing women correctly, however, police officers sometimes have to listen to women saying that they are not \"your lady\".\n\n62. April. Criminal investigation officers now receive a monthly clothing allowance of DM 13.30 as an equivalent to the uniform of the police.\n\n63. The police in NRW are organized as follows in 1951: The Ministry of the Interior consists of five departments, of which Dept. IV is responsible for public safety (police department). The Ministry is responsible for police supervision in the state. It is subordinate to several district presidents, who in turn are assigned to the 25 district police authorities. In addition to the district police authorities, there are also two state police schools (Münster and Düsseldorf), the state criminal investigation department and the water police with the \"Rhine\" and \"West German Canals\" groups. There are also several state police facilities, namely the police telecommunications service, the riot police with four departments (BPA I Bork, BPA II Bochum, BPA III Wuppertal and BPA IV Linnich) and a police dog breeding and training center.\n\n64. August 3 . A decision is taken to set up a riot police force. According to this, 2724 officers are to serve in hundreds in four departments (Wuppertal, Essen, Linnich and Bork). Each division of the riot police is to consist of four squads, each of which is to be divided into three platoons - and these in turn into three groups. The armament regulations stipulate that each division is to be equipped with 27 machine guns, 30 submachine guns, a water cannon as well as carbines and pistols. The divisions are also to be equipped with Volkswagens, all-terrain trucks and motorcycles. On 1.10.51, the first 150 officers are to move into their department, the converted teachers' college in the town of Linnich. The main tasks of the riot police are, on the one hand, the training and further training of officers as a replacement for the general law enforcement service and, on the other hand, constant operational readiness to reinforce the police law enforcement service in the event of major dangers. The legal basis for the establishment of the police squads is the law on the riot police of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia from August 3, 1951. Approval for the establishment of closed units was granted on November 14, 1950 by the Allied High Commission, which thus moved away from its previous position that there should be no closed police units in Germany.\n\n65. The transfer of police officers who had to flee from the German eastern territories that had fallen to Poland and Russia at the end of the war and had lost their jobs as a result is regulated. The \"Law regulating the legal status of persons covered by Article 131 of the Basic Law\" of 11.5.51 stipulates that, with a few exceptions, the civil servants now popularly known as \"131ers\" are to be reinstated in their new home country in an office that corresponds to their former position (reinstatement in the office held on January 31, 1933). Those who were particularly politically incriminated during the Nazi era are not to benefit from the regulation. However, a not inconsiderable number of former Gestapo officers from the former eastern territories have now also had to join the North Rhine-Westphalian police force. However, the pension costs for these officers are not borne by the federal states concerned, but by the federal government.\n\n66. Handover of the former Luftwaffe ammunition headquarters (\"Muna\") in Bork as police accommodation to the 1st hundred of the riot police on 26.11.51.\n\n67. October: Police officers have to freeze. The Association of Police Officers writes to the Minister of the Interior asking him to ensure that the police stations have more fuel to heat their offices. It complains that there have been numerous cases of colds among police officers in the past because the stations and police stations have remained cold due to the lack of fuel.\n\n68. From 1951, the North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry of the Interior procures FN 9 millimeter and FN 7.65 millimeter pistols for all police officers. By the turn of 1952/53, every police officer is finally equipped with their own firearm. Prior to this, the criminal investigation department had already been equipped with Belgian weapons.\n\n1952\n\n69. move-in of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Hundreds in Bork. Relocation of the 13th task force from Düsseldorf to the newly built facility for a riot police force in Linnich.\n\n70. State Secretary Dr. Wilhelm Rombach retires. He has been the permanent representative of the Minister of the Interior since 1948. Rombach dies more than 20 years after his retirement, on September 18, 1973.\n\n71. In 1952, the rank designations of police officers in NRW are changed:\n\nOld designation New designation\n\nPolice inspector Police commissioner\n\nSenior police inspector Senior police commissioner\n\nChief Superintendent of Police Senior police councillor Police councillor\n\nDetective Police Inspector Detective Superintendent\n\nDetective Chief Inspector Detective Chief Superintendent\n\nChief Superintendent of Criminal Investigation\n\nSenior Criminal Investigation Officer Criminal Investigation Officer\n\n72. May 11. At a protest rally of the communist youth organization \"Free German Youth\" (FDJ), attended by 30,000 people in Essen, a young participant is shot dead in front of the Gruga Hall by officers of a police task force after some young people start throwing stones at the officers.\n\n73. May 25. The term of office of Interior Minister Adolf Flecken (CDU) ends. His office is taken over by Franz Meyers (CDU). Meyers, born on July 31, 1908 in Mönchengladbach, is a doctor of law, comes from a family of police officers and works as a lawyer. He became Lord Mayor of Mönchengladbach in 1952 and was Minister of the Interior from 1952 to 1956. After a brief period as a member of the Bundestag, he held the office of NRW Minister President from 1958 to 1966. Meyers dies on January 27, 2002 at the age of 93 in his home town of Mönchengladbach.\n\n74. June 20. The establishment of Riot Police Division III in Wuppertal is completed. The establishment began in September 1951.\n\n75. July 23. The former Prussian Minister of the Interior Dr. h.c. Carl Severing dies at the age of 77. The State Police School in Münster was named after Severing in 1949, who had rendered outstanding services to the establishment of a democratic police force during the Weimar Republic.\n\n76. The riot police department II (Bochum) is also completed. Its establishment had begun in January 1952. The first head of the department is Hermann Bachor, who had previously served as deputy head of the Bottrop police.\n\n77. November: By decree, the Minister of the Interior orders mandatory emergency signals to be given by police officers using the whistle. In cases where police officers are physically attacked and cannot break the resistance with their own strength, when lawbreakers are fleeing or if assistance is needed at the scene of an accident or danger, the officers are to blow the emergency signal \"Short, short, long\". The response signal of officers who hear the signal and rush to help should be \"three short\".\n\n78. October 21. The term of office of Ministerial Director Dr. Siegfried Middelhaufe ends. Middelhaufe had headed the police department in the Ministry of the Interior since November 1946.\n\n79. Low salary despite sharp price increases. The profession of police officer is one of the lowest paid jobs. In 1952, a police chief constable earned between DM 210 and DM 280, depending on seniority. By way of comparison, a packet of coffee beans (500g) cost DM 16, 500g of butter DM 3.50, a loaf of rye bread DM 1.95, men's shoes DM 25 to DM 35, a bedroom DM 350 to DM 1,100, a comforter DM 34 to DM 100 and a bicycle between DM 40 and DM 85.\n\n80. operations with brain injuries. During operations, the police repeatedly have to deal with people who have suffered brain injuries as a result of the war. Some of them appear in the public street scene in a staggering manner as apparently drunk people, others tend to act out due to their brain damage, so that the police are alerted. In its October 1952 issue of the magazine \"Deutsche Polizei\", the police union explains this problem and warns people to look for a \"brain injury\" stamp in their passports in suitable cases. Nationwide, 60,000 brain-injured people are registered, but it is assumed that there is a high number of unreported cases.\n\n81. Protest against poor pay. The extremely poor income situation of police officers is not only being loudly and clearly denounced by trade unions. In many places, protest groups are also forming at the level of the district police authorities. For example, 68 officers from the 3rd police district of the Wuppertal police force, from police constable to police superintendent, published a resolution in which they demanded appropriate pay. The protest letter states, among other things: \"We demand the financial appreciation of our service and refuse to continue to be comforted with empty promises\". The officers point to the average hourly wage of DM 1.10 and go on to explain: \"Just as every police officer can see their excitement when they receive the money, the representatives of the state should also feel a shameful blush on their faces to expect us to perform our duties for such a front wage, in which our health and possibly even our lives have to be risked.\"\n\n1953\n\n82. January 14. A voluntary school crossing guard service is introduced to support the police in keeping school routes safe. Just three years later, there will be 12,000 young helpers ensuring that schoolchildren can cross the road safely. The school crossing patrols, who are trained by the police, will wear conspicuous protective vests and signal drivers to stop. The minimum age is 13.\n\n83. The State Office of Criminal Investigation is renamed the \"State Office of Criminal Investigation\". The office has just 97 employees in this financial year.\n\n84. The speed limit of 40 km/h for motor vehicles within built-up areas is lifted. As a result, the number of people injured and killed in accidents rises rapidly.\n\n85. The Road Traffic Act stipulates that the transportation of people on the loading areas of trucks is prohibited in future. In the past, such passenger transportation had led to numerous serious accidents.\n\n86. Nationwide police crime statistics are introduced at the Federal Criminal Police Office. Among other things, all officially reported crimes and suspects are counted in these statistics. Until the end of 1952, there were no uniform crime statistics for West Germany. Two separate statistics were kept, one for the British occupation zone (North Rhine-Westphalia, Hamburg, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein) and one for the other federal states. As the statistics were kept according to very different criteria, they were not comparable and could not be combined. The first statistics for the whole of Germany show a total number of around 1,491,000 crimes for 1953.\n\n87. October 1. Reorganization: North Rhine-Westphalia receives a new police organization law. The police force of North Rhine-Westphalia loses its character as a municipal police force and is re-nationalized. With the reorganization of 1953, there are now three different types of police authorities: The district police authorities, the state police authorities (Regierungspräsidenten) and the state criminal investigation department. The district police authorities are now the \"Oberkreisdirektor\" in the rural districts, the \"Leiter des Polizeiamtes\" in the independent cities with up to 100,000 inhabitants, the \"Polizeidirektoren\" in the cities with 100,000 - 300,000 inhabitants and the \"Polizeipräsidenten\" in the cities with 300,000 and more inhabitants. After the end of the war, the police had initially been split up into small municipal units, which was reversed with the reorganization.\n\n88. October 1. The two water police groups \"Rhine\" and \"Canals\" are merged into a separate district police authority, the North Rhine-Westphalia Water Police Directorate, under the new Police Organization Act. In 1953 alone, the waterway police are deployed in 400 shipwrecks.\n\n1954\n\n89. May 25. The new salary law comes into force. A police chief constable (pay grade A3) now earns between DM 280 and DM 375 per month, depending on the length of service in the police force, a detective inspector (A6) between DM 440 and DM 625 and a police protection officer (A16) between DM 825 and DM 1325.\n\n90. June 14. Police and clairvoyance: In a circular decree, the Ministry of the Interior regulates the inadmissibility of psychic means in police operations. The decree states: \"Police measures that could have serious consequences for those affected may only be carried out using means that are objectively verifiable. It is therefore inadmissible to use psychic means to carry out such measures, in particular to investigate criminal acts, or to make use of such persons (clairvoyants, fortune tellers, etc.) who are allegedly in possession of psychic abilities\".\n\n91. June 15: The State Civil Servants Act (LBG) stipulates 48 hours as the weekly working time for police officers. Under certain conditions, this may be exceeded. With regard to taking up residence, the LBG stipulates that the superior may order a police officer to take up residence at a certain distance from the place of employment or to move into an official residence. Due to the particular stresses and strains of the job, police officers retire at the age of 60 (more precisely: on March 31 following their 60th birthday), which differs from the age limit for other civil servants. Previously, police officers retired at the age of 65.\n\n92. The salary development of police officers lags far behind the development of other professions. While the salaries of police officers in North Rhine-Westphalia increased by 40% between 1946 and 1954, the increases in the paper processing industry were 76%, in the chemical industry 100% and in the iron industry as much as 123%. The average increase for all industry groups in these years was 89%.\n\n93. Hermann Bachor steps down as head of the Bochum riot police and becomes head of the \"Carl Severing\" state police school in Münster.\n\n94. Former member of the state parliament Hans Kirchhoff, who has spent most of his professional life with the Ruhrknappschaft in Bochum, becomes the new director of the water police.\n\n95. Fatal use of firearms: On an arterial road in Düsseldorf, the driver of a sports car disregards the stop signs of a police officer who is on the lookout for the so-called \"highway robbers\" who have been active in the state for some time. The officer shoots at the fleeing car with a submachine gun. The driver's wife is fatally shot. The driver had fled with the car because he had used it without the owner's knowledge.\n\n96. The Federal Court of Justice rules that the use of lie detectors as evidence in criminal proceedings is unsuitable and inadmissible. The collection of evidence using such a technical instrument turns the person under investigation into an object and violates human dignity.\n\n97. December: New \"murder van\": Shortly before the turn of the year, the State Office of Criminal Investigation unveils a car trailer designed to serve as an emergency vehicle in homicide cases and disasters. The converted caravan, a rolling office, can be towed effortlessly even in difficult terrain and contains all the technical equipment of a stationary criminal investigation department, i.e. forensic equipment, a radio intercom system, a dictaphone, a typewriter and a table with four seats, a back seat with a further three seats and a separate seat for detainees who can be handcuffed to the seat. After a trial phase, the vehicle is to be used in all criminal investigation departments in the country.\n\n1955\n\n98. A new uniform is introduced. It has a civilian rather than a military character. The collar of the skirt is open, and a shirt and tie are worn. From 1955, except on special occasions or by the riot police, only a peaked cap may be worn as headgear, rather than a chaco.\n\n99. Establishment of an equestrian squadron in Bonn.\n\n100. duration of leave depends on the pay grade: The new vacation ordinance stipulates that civil servants in grades A3 - A4 (intermediate service) are entitled to 27 vacation days per year from the age of 40. From A5, there is an entitlement to 30 days, from A9 to 32 days and from A16 upwards to 36 days.\n\n101. NRW's major cities are to be equipped with new types of police reporting devices (police emergency call pillars). In the event of danger, a small window is smashed to reveal an alarm button. Pressing the button triggers a bell in the police station. In addition, police officers can unlock the device and call for backup via a telephone inside. The previous police call points have not proved their worth. They were equipped with a telephone receiver that citizens could use to call the police. However, the handsets were removed too often and the device housings did not prove to be durable enough. The new reporting devices are initially installed in Bonn, Oberhausen and Dortmund.\n\n102. The NRW police are equipped with tear gas pistols, which are designed to be effective at a distance of up to 150 meters.\n\n1956\n\n103. February 28. Hubert Biernat is appointed Minister of the Interior. He replaces his predecessor Franz Meyers. Born on June 11, 1907 in Heeren (district of Unna), the trained businessman Biernat worked as an editor of a Social Democratic newspaper from 1928 and had to emigrate to Holland and Belgium during the Nazi era to avoid arrest. After the war, he first became head of the district agency of the Westfälische Rundschau, then district administrator in Unna in 1946, and in 1950 district president in Arnsberg until he accepted a call to the Düsseldorf ministry. Biernat dies on 30.10.67.\n\n104. Trade union efforts to reduce the working week for civil servants bore fruit. In its deliberations on the Civil Service Law Framework Act, the Civil Service Law Committee of the German Bundestag decides to reduce the working week to 45 hours. The change will be implemented in the Working Hours Ordinance in 1958.\n\n105. April 1. Decentralization of salary payments: The salary offices, which were previously maintained on a decentralized basis at 45 police authorities and institutions, are abolished. They are now replaced by a \"Central Pay Office for the Police\", which uses an electronic data processing system to calculate the salaries of around 27,000 police officers and issues payment instructions.\n\n106. The Police School for Technology in Essen now becomes an independent institution as the \"State Police School for Technology and Traffic\". The school is given the task of training and further training the state's police officers in traffic, motor vehicles, telecommunications, medical services, weapons and equipment. In addition, the central telecommunications workshop and the recruitment and selection office for young police officers are placed under the school's control.\n\n107. Foundation of the International Police Association (IPA) in September 1956.\n\n108. On September 1, Prime Minister Steinhoff opens the International Police Exhibition (IPA) in Essen, in Exhibition Hall 4 of the Gruga. In addition to the police forces of all German states, 18 foreign countries, the Red Cross, the Federal Criminal Police Office, customs and the security industry are also taking part. The exhibitors present their work on 60,000 square meters. The exhibition, which lasts several days, attracts 374,000 visitors.\n\n109. September 18. The Ministry of the Interior issues a so-called \"drunk driving decree\", in which police officers are expressly prohibited from driving motor vehicles under the influence of alcohol. The decree is renewed in 1957 and 1958 due to the large number of incidents in which police officers were caught drunk behind the wheel.\n\n110. At the International Police Exhibition, a novelty is also introduced to protect police officers from being shot: A bulletproof vest. The nine-kilogram vest is already being used by the American police. The vest, which is to be worn under the uniform, protects the most important organs from the collarbone to the genital area. The sides of the body are also armored. The vest can also be supplied with head protection with a viewing slit on request.\n\n111. The Essen police officer Wilhelm Montag takes part in the Olympic Games in Melbourne in the coxless four.\n\n112: The police receive six police cars equipped with telephones. The new equipment is to be used to track down vehicles that make a lot of noise on the roads.\n\nOctober 113. Reduction in personnel: Interior Minister Biernat announces at the Lawyers' Conference in Bad Oeynhausen that the number of police officers in NRW is to be reduced despite the increase in the population.\n\n114. For the health care of police officers, the Minister of the Interior contracts three police health resorts in Bad Oeynhausen. These are the Oeynhausen state spa, the \"Villa Berta\" spa guesthouse and the \"Heldreich\" guesthouse. The cost of the cures is DM 9 per officer per day. The medical costs for a four-week cure amounted to DM 22 for the entire stay. Other health resorts, which are contracted by the Minister of the Interior, are in Bad Neuenahr, Bad Ems and Bad Aachen.\n\n115. The state highway trains \"Rhineland\" and \"Westphalia\" are set up. The highway police officers stand out with their service vehicles - Porsche 356 Cabriolet - and their white uniforms with white helmets. The officers' rapid response vehicles are equipped with VHF radios so that they can establish contact with all police stations in the state. The new unit is also known as the \"overtaking police\", as they can easily overtake and stop other road users with their fast vehicles.\n\n116. The new police headquarters in Cologne is completed after two years of construction and is occupied by the end of the year. The building on Waidmarkt has 13 floors above ground as well as two underground floors converted into a bunker and a large side wing.\n\n117. Police Superintendent Friedrich Quentin is appointed Inspector of the North Rhine-Westphalian police force. Born in Dortmund, he was most recently deputy head of the Hiltrup Police Institute. He succeeds Inspector Karl Bremer, who retires on reaching the age limit.\n\n118. Introduction of exterior mirrors on motor vehicles: It is now mandatory for vehicle owners to have a mirror on the outside of a motor vehicle. This is intended to make overtaking safer. Previously, only interior mirrors had to be installed in motor vehicles.\n\n1957\n\n119. January. Test run for future police aviation. At the Düsseldorf Lohausen airfield, the Ministry of the Interior is currently testing a new type of foreign aircraft for use by the police. It is found that the aircraft has a greater radius of action than helicopters. Radio contact is established from the four-seater aircraft with the police authorities in various cities in the Düsseldorf region.\n\n120. Ski Police. Officers from the police stations in the high-altitude areas of the districts of Düren, Monschau and Schleiden are equipped with skis and ski clothing for their duties. The police officers are trained in skiing at the Bavarian police school in order to be able to provide police assistance to the inhabitants of trapped villages in the event of extreme snowfall.\n\n121. March 1. License plate requirement for mopeds. With immediate effect, moped owners must equip their vehicles with a small license plate issued by the insurance company. Until now, a license plate was not required for driving mopeds.\n\n122. The national police gymnastics team is founded. In the following decades, it will perform countless shows both inside and outside the police force and impress not only with its acrobatics, but also with comic interludes as a clown group.\n\n123. The \"Erich Klausener\" state police school is moved from its Düsseldorf location to Selm.\n\n124. July 16. The road traffic regulations now allow police officers to charge up to five marks for traffic offenses, instead of the previous maximum of two marks as a chargeable warning. To this end, the officers are issued with different colored warning fine blocks for 1, 2 and 5 marks.\n\n125. July 17. The first major documentary film about the German police is shown at the Haus der Technik in Essen. The 50-minute film shows the International Police Exhibition that had been held in Essen the previous year. On the other hand, a wide variety of police activities are shown, from patrol duty and water police to the deployment of the mountain police in the Bavarian glaciers. No actors were filmed but police officers at work. The film ends with an evening foot patrol and the words of the commentator: \"He is one of thousands who are on duty in the cities and in the countryside. His name probably never appears in the newspapers. He has never seen any crime novels. He is the smallest cog in the wheel of the large police apparatus - the outermost outpost in the fight of good against evil - and all the cogs turn in a precisely predictable rhythm\".\n\n126. September 1: Binding speed limits for motor vehicles are laid down in the road traffic regulations. The speed limit is 50 km/h within built-up areas, 80 km/h on federal highways and 80 km/h on other roads, or 60 km/h for certain vehicles.\n\n127. The assignment of pay grades to job titles is changed in 1957. A distinction is made between constable grades (A3 - A5) and senior civil servants (A6 - A17 and B2) within the so-called single career path, in which every civil servant is in principle eligible for every office.\n\nA3 Police constable / senior constable\n\nA4 Police chief constable / criminal assistant\n\nA5 Police master/chief constable/criminal secretary/chief secretary\n\nA6 Police inspector / detective inspector\n\nA7 n. assigned\n\nA8 Police Superintendent / Detective Superintendent\n\nA9 n. assigned\n\nA10 n. assigned\n\nA 11 Police Chief Superintendent / Detective Chief Superintendent\n\nA 12 n. assigned\n\nA 13 n. assigned\n\nA 14 Police Councillor / Criminal Councillor\n\nA 15 Senior Police Councillor / Senior Criminal Councillor / Director of the State Office of Criminal Investigation\n\nA 16 Protection Police Director\n\nA 17 Police Director of the Hiltrup Police Institute / at the Ministry of the Interior / Criminal Director at the Ministry of the Interior\n\nB 1 n. assigned\n\nB 2 Police Inspector at the Ministry of the Interior\n\n128. transfer to the criminal investigation department: A new career regulation for police officers stipulates that in future, police officers wishing to transfer to the criminal investigation department must pass a criminal investigation examination. It is no longer possible to transfer to the criminal investigation department without this examination.\n\n129. \"Motorized patrol service\" is introduced in NRW after the Minister of the Interior signed a decree to this effect in 1955. The motto is \"Fast police, good police!\" The previous centralized radio patrol service in the authorities is now replaced by decentralized equipment of the individual police stations with radio patrol cars. In addition, all individual stations are to be equipped with two-wheelers. The police stations will mainly receive Mercedes, Opel Kapitän and Volkswagen vehicles with radio equipment. However, the motorized radio patrol service will not only drive through the police station, but one or all of the officers on board will get out and patrol the area around the vehicle. The vehicles should drive around 240 km per day, i.e. 80 km per shift. Assuming a driving speed of 25 - 30 km/h, the vehicles will be driven for just under 3 hours. Four hours will be spent on foot patrols and one hour on breaks. The acquisition costs per vehicle, including radio equipment, are around 10,000 marks and the annual operating costs are around 5,000 marks.\n\n130. In NRW, heavy motorcycles with radios and streamlined fairings are to be used throughout the state to increase police mobility. The machines reach a top speed of 160 km/h. In addition, an increasing number of four-door patrol cars are to be procured, as experience to date speaks against the use of two-door vehicles.\n\n131. The new Federal Salary Act , which also applies to police officers in North Rhine-Westphalia, comes into force. The following basic salaries are then paid. The local allowances that are added amount to between DM 55 (A3 single) and DM 310 (A 16, married, 4 children):\n\nSalary group Starting salary in DM Final salary in DM Seniority steps Seniority allowance in DM\n\nA3 270 380 12 10\n\nA4 280 390 12 10\n\nA5 300 420 13 10\n\nA6 317 485 13 14\n\nA8 383 635 13 21\n\nA 11 593 965 13 31\n\nA14 807 1.335 13 44\n\nA15 914 1.490 13 48\n\nA16 1.051 1.735 13 57\n\n132. October 1: The waterway police are reorganized. The Cologne and Duisburg sections are merged to form the \"Rhine\" section based in Duisburg. The Recklinghausen and Münster sections are merged to form the \"West German Canals\" section. This section is now based in Münster.\n\n1958\n\n133. Josef Dufhues (CDU) becomes Interior Minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, succeeding Hubert Biernat. Born in 1908, Dufhues works as a lawyer after studying law. He was a member of the state parliament from 1950 and Minister of the Interior from 1958 to 1962. In 1966, he became President of the state parliament. Dufhues dies on March 26, 1971 as a result of a tropical viral infection that he had suffered shortly before during a business trip to Africa.\n\n134. March 19. The second-hand goods ordinance for the state of North Rhine-Westphalia comes into force. It obliges second-hand goods dealers to keep records of the goods they sell and to allow the police to carry out inspections on an ad hoc basis. In the police authorities, selected officers visit the second-hand goods stores and compare their stock with items advertised for search in the state and federal crime bulletins.\n\n135. The career ordinance is amended so that the pay grades change. In future, a distinction will no longer be made within the police force between constable grades and senior officers, but between middle, senior and higher grades. There will no longer be pay grades A3 - A4 in the police force. The middle grade starts at A5, the senior grade at A9 and the higher grade at A13. Pay grade A17 is abolished.\n\n136. No cancer risk from diesel: The question posed by many police officers who work in traffic control or traffic monitoring as to whether diesel fumes are potentially carcinogenic has been answered by a study conducted by the Federal Ministry of Transport with the support of German car manufacturers. No increased risk from inhaled diesel residues was found. Nevertheless, the investigations are to be continued.\n\n137. June 23. Several men go on a rampage in a stolen car in Bonn and the surrounding area in the evening hours. Between 10.40 p.m. and 11.55 p.m. they shoot with pistols and rifles through various apartment windows, at passers-by and oncoming vehicles and also smash several windows of houses. The rampage claimed the lives of two men.\n\n138. Obviously, the police have a problem with courtesy towards citizens. In a circular on \"forms of correspondence with the public\", the Minister of the Interior warns that \"a polite tone in dealings with the authorities is one of the most natural basic rules of a democratic state that wants to serve and help its citizens\". In a letter to all authorities dated 9.10.63, the Minister of the Interior again demanded compliance with the decree in 1963 due to violations.\n\n1959\n\n139. January 1. The previous principle of free medical care, that police officers may only consult a police doctor or a police contract doctor, has been abandoned. According to the new regulations of the Free Medical Care, police officers now have a free choice of doctor. The police union had campaigned for this and complained that sick police officers had previously been \"under a kind of trust medical supervision\".\n\n140. Dr. Oskar Wenzky becomes head of the new State Office of Criminal Investigation. He succeeds Friedrich D'heil, who left in October 1958. Born in 1911, Wensky works at the Higher Regional Court in Breslau after studying law. He joins the police in 1936.\n\n141. More police officers on the streets. Interior Minister Dufhues wants to put more police officers on the streets. To this end, 1,400 officers who were previously on indoor duty are to be transferred to outdoor duty. In addition, the existing police districts are to be merged into police protection areas, each with 70,000 to 150,000 inhabitants. The protection areas are to be assigned their own patrol cars.\n\n142. The Düsseldorf criminal investigation department registers 1,444 men and women for vagrancy within a year. As 388 of them have not found accommodation within a set period, they are sent to summary court. Almost all of them are convicted, six men and five women are also sent to a workhouse.\n\n143. October 24. Death on duty by a blow from a fist. In the evening hours of October 24, 59-year-old police officer Johann Niedballa is killed during an operation in Bochum. After a group of rowdy youths first caused damage to a kiosk and then harassed a bridal couple in the street, a brawl broke out and the police were called. Niedballa was one of the first police officers to arrive. He was brutally knocked down by a punch from the 19-year-old ringleader of the youth group and died of his injuries on the way to hospital. The suspect was arrested shortly afterwards. Niedballa, who would have retired just a few months after the fatal attack, was carried to his grave by more than 1,000 police officers.\n\n144. December 12. A special commission is set up at the State Office of Criminal Investigation to investigate violent National Socialist crimes. As of 1962, the commission has received 1,800 cases for investigation, 11 of which have been brought to a provisional conclusion at this time. The commission employs 30 civil servants.\n\nFigure 3: Vehicle inspection by the Essen police in the early 1950s (source: Essen police)\n\n60s\n\nOnce again, it is the sharp increase in road traffic that poses major problems for the police and calls for a lot of manpower and new ideas to increase road safety. In society, which is now largely freed from the material worries of the post-war period, the need for freedom from state paternalism is growing. The slogan \"Under the gowns, the mustiness of a thousand years\" is making the rounds, especially among the younger section of the population. Towards the end of the 1960s, the number of large demonstrations against state interference in private life and calling for more liberality increased sharply. The police now had to deal to a greater extent with the fact that such protests were no longer always peaceful, but sometimes degenerated into violence. The number of police deployments and the use of batons and water cannons is increasing. One outstanding case in the fight against crime is the investigation into the serial child murderer Jürgen Bartsch, whose actions shocked more than just the population of North Rhine-Westphalia. Towards the end of the decade, the number of police officers breaks through the 32,000 mark and yet, as will soon become apparent, is no longer sufficient to meet the new challenges awaiting the police in the 1970s.\n\n1960\n\n145. trial speed limit: A speed limit is introduced for four days over Whitsun: 100 km/h on freeways, 80 km/h on main roads. The traffic accident statistics for these four days are clear. There are 15% fewer road deaths than in the same period last year, despite the fact that traffic density has increased by 25% during this year.\n\n146. August 1. In future, tires on motor vehicles and trailers must have tread grooves or notches across their entire width. The tread depth must be at least 1 mm at all points of the tire.\n\n147 Detective Inspector Fänger from the Düsseldorf police force is the most successful German police fencer. He took part in the 1960 Olympic Games, competed in the World Championships and was a member of the German national team 27 times.\n\n148. NRW police Olympic participant: Manfred Kinder, the North Rhine-Westphalian police champion, also takes part in the Olympic Games in Rome. He and his team win the silver medal in the 4x400m relay and fifth place in the 400m race.\n\n149. October 7. A major fire breaks out on the Rhine near Emmerich after the ocean-going ferry \"Tina Scarlett\" collides with a tanker carrying 700 tons of kerosene on its way to Rotterdam. The kerosene, which spreads burning on the Rhine, sets fire to nine other ships. Together with the fire department, the Emmerich water police try to reach the trapped passengers on the ferry. Two people eventually die in the flames and 24 others are injured. The water police receive reinforcements from Duisburg at a very late stage.\n\n150. The ADAC suggests introducing so-called parking disks, based on the model of the French capital Paris, which can be placed in cars for free parking. They are intended to ensure that drivers can park free of charge for a limited period of time and that the police are also able to determine when the car has been parked. There are calls for a move away from the \"penny tomb\" parking meters, which place an unnecessary financial burden on drivers.\n\n151. From August 1, drivers are responsible for displaying inspection stickers on the rear license plates of their vehicles to prove that they have presented their vehicle to an inspection station.\n\nDecember 152: The first ten applicants to work as helicopter pilots in the planned police helicopter squadron undergo a selection process at the State Police School in Essen. Five of them are selected for further tests, which they have to complete at the Federal Border Police helicopter flight readiness unit.\n\n153. Essen police officer Mathias Schießleder becomes European judo champion.\n\n154. school-leaving qualifications of the new recruits: Of the 1101 men recruited to the police force, 79% have a primary school leaving certificate, 19.6% have an intermediate school leaving certificate and 1.4% have a high school diploma or vocational baccalaureate.\n\n1961\n\n155. February 1. All police headquarters and police directorates must set up a department for youth protection and juvenile delinquency issues with immediate effect on the basis of a circular issued by the Minister of the Interior. In organizational terms, the department will be merged with the Female Criminal Investigation Department (WKP) under the name \"WKP and Youth Protection\". A corresponding unit will also be set up at the State Office of Criminal Investigation.\n\n156. police emergency call systems are to be operated jointly by the police and fire department in future. The labeling of the police call systems is to be changed to \"Police + Fire\".\n\n157 The first police telex dialing center goes into operation in Bielefeld. In future, the police stations connected to this center will be able to contact each other by telex without the need for manual communication. This means that the departments can communicate with each other directly by telex. Initially, 100 district police authorities and police stations in the administrative district of Detmold are to be connected to the control center. There will also be a connection to the control center in Düsseldorf.\n\n158. August 5. Police officer shot dead. During an identity check in a wooded area near Neuss-Grimmlinghausen, the person being checked shoots at the intervening police officers without warning. The 26-year-old police sergeant Friedhelm Noeldechen is fatally injured.\n\n159 In 1961, over 3,000 requests for investigations are sent to the State Office of Criminal Investigation from all over NRW. The requests relate to the examination of chemicals, blood, suspected forged documents, handwriting and other evidence to be examined by the authority's experts.\n\n160 Police officers who died in the line of duty: Between May 8, 1945 and December 31, 1961, 230 police officers were killed by lawbreakers or died in accidents in North Rhine-Westphalia. As the North Rhine-Westphalian police force is affected by this problem to an above-average extent compared to the rest of Germany, safety drills are to be carried out for all officers from 1962.\n\n1962\n\nMarch 161, 17. Herbert Kalicinski, Director of the Hiltrup Police Institute, dies a few months before retiring. Born in Königshütte in Silesia in 1897, he had joined the Prussian police in 1922, but was removed from office by the National Socialists in 1937. After being appointed head of the police school in Homburg, Hesse, at the end of the war, he was appointed the first head of the Hiltrup Police Institute in 1948. Kalicinski is succeeded by Walter Schorn, who most recently worked as a traffic officer in the Ministry of the Interior.\n\nApril 162. The Ministry of the Interior publishes the first copy of the magazine \"Die Streife\". On 20 pages, the reader learns about ten years of riot police, the reorganization of the police and the motorization of the police in NRW.\n\n163. April 13. As part of an international police cooperation program, police councillor Rudolf Klotz, formerly of the \"Carl Severing\" state police school, is sent to Kabul to train Afghan police officers. He will head the police school there for five years.\n\n164 May 27. The Act on the Exercise and Limits of Direct Coercion (UZwG NW.) comes into force. It regulates the use of coercive means by the police and provides, among other things, for the use of hand grenades by police officers against persons who have used firearms or explosives and where the use of firearms by the police has been unsuccessful.\n\n165 July 26. The term of office of Interior Minister Josef Hermann Dufhues ends. He is succeeded by Willy Weyer (FDP). Weyer, born in 1917, becomes deputy mayor of Hagen in 1948 after studying law, then a member of the state parliament in 1950. In 1954 he became Minister of Economics, in 1956 Minister of Construction and in 1962 Minister of the Interior of NRW. In 1975, he left the state government and the state parliament. From 1974 to 1986, he was President of the German Sports Federation, and from 1958 until his death on August 15, 1987, he was President of the NRW State Sports Federation.\n\n166. August 1. The police helicopter squadron begins operations with two Augusta Bell 47 J aircraft. Initially based at the accommodation area of the riot police division III in Wuppertal, Obere Lichtenplatzer Straße, until September 1, 1983. Two garages served as hangars for the aircraft. Organizationally, the squadron is initially subordinate to the state motorway train of the Düsseldorf Regional Council. Just ten months after entering service, the squadron can look back on 226 missions with more than 600 flying hours. The majority of the missions are traffic surveillance missions. To date, North Rhine-Westphalia is the only German state to deploy helicopters with the police. The individual price of the two helicopters purchased, which operate under the radio call names \"Hummel I\" and \"Hummel II\", is DM 300,000.\n\n167. September 4 - 7. French President Charles de Gaulle comes to North Rhine-Westphalia on a state visit. The police deploy 2,000 police officers and 500 detectives to protect the state guest. De Gaulle is escorted by 17 police motorcyclists (\"white mice\") on all his journeys, as required by protocol.\n\n168) The head of the State Police School for Technology and Traffic in Essen, Police Senior Councillor Heinz Staeck, retires.\n\n169 The Ministry of the Interior appoints Dr. Jakob Jülicher as the new Director of the Water Police. Born in Aachen in 1921, the legal and political scientist had worked in the police department of the Ministry of the Interior and as head of the Neuß police office. He takes over from Hans Kirchhoff, who becomes the new Chief of Police in Essen.\n\n170 The police in NRW have 33 camera vehicles with which speed measurements are carried out.\n\n171 Recruitment: Around 4,900 young men apply to join the police in 1962. Around 4,200 appear for the examination and 1,800 are found to be fit for police service. In the end, 1,120 applicants were recruited. Many of the rejected applicants had heart or circulatory problems, 10% were color-blind. A survey of 550 police candidates on the question of how they came to choose their career revealed the following results: 190 were recruited through a personal conversation with a police officer, 113 through the newspaper, 104 through observations relating to the police service, 48 through their father, who is in the police force himself, 15 through friends, 15 through a police sports show and one through a crime film. Before joining, the majority of applicants had worked in a skilled trade, 45% were secondary school pupils.\n\n1963\n\n172. January 1. Partial withdrawal from the recording of minor accidents: According to Interior Minister Weyer, the North Rhine-Westphalian police will only record traffic accidents with minor damage to a very limited extent. In future, extensive final reports and hand sketches will no longer be required, even for the most minor damage. Only a small amount of data will be recorded at the scene of the accident. Weyer: \"It must be pointed out that it is not the job of the police to create documents for possible private legal disputes between the parties involved.\"\n\nApril 173. With the \"WSP 11\", the North Rhine-Westphalian water police now have the first police speedboat in Germany. The boat, which can reach a speed of 55 km/h and even up to 60 km/h when traveling downhill, is to be used to monitor recreational boat traffic, among other things. The \"WSP 11\" is only 7 m long and 2.10 m wide.\n\nJuly 174. The Essen police have to keep watch over the largest competition event in the world. In addition to 30,000 active gymnasts and 3,000 judges, countless spectators flock to the \"German Gymnastics Festival 1963\". Federal President Heinrich Lübke gives the closing speech at the major event, which is also attended by numerous gymnasts from the North Rhine-Westphalian police force.\n\nJuly 175. The American President John F. Kennedy visits the Federal Republic of Germany. The visit requires a huge police presence to protect the state guest. During his stay, Kennedy visits the cities of Bonn, Cologne and Bad Godesberg. Just four months later, Kennedy is killed by a sniper in Dallas, Texas.\n\n176. September 1. The police helicopter squadron moves from Wuppertal to Düsseldorf-Lohausen Airport.\n\n177 Foreigner problems. The dramatic increase in the influx of foreigners to North Rhine-Westphalia forces the police to take action. For example, the police train Turkish, Spanish, Italian and Greek immigrant workers with bicycles, go-carts and pedal cars in youth traffic schools to teach them the German traffic rules. In its magazine \"Die Streife\", the Ministry of the Interior comes to the following conclusion: \"The foreign young men, some of whom come from areas where motor vehicle traffic is often still virtually unknown, burden the police with additional problems due to their behavior. The increase in foreign criminality is also being countered. After the proportion of foreign suspects in the total number of suspects had already reached 2.8% in 1963, a \"foreigner observation unit\" was set up at the identification service in Duisburg, for example. Foreign crime suspects are summarized in a file. The police also work closely with the immigration authorities.\n\n178. September 24. The former Minister of the Interior Walter Menzel, who held office from 1946 to 1950, dies.\n\n179: Interior Minister Weyer suggests that a minimum speed limit of 60 km/h should be introduced on freeways for a transitional period, later rising to 80 km/h. At present, there is no such minimum speed on freeways. Slow-moving small car drivers and overloaded trucks cause a large number of traffic accidents every year, as they provoke dangerous overtaking maneuvers by other drivers.\n\n180. In 1963, DM 157,000 is spent on the purchase of modern forensic equipment for the state's 13 forensic investigation centers (KTU). The KTU are located at larger district police authorities.\n\n181 The waterway police now have 13 stations and 6 posts - including 5 multi-person posts - on the Rhine and along the canals in NRW. Each station and each post has at least one patrol boat, the Duisburg station even has 4, Cologne 3 and Emmerich 2 boats. In addition, each station has at least one motor vehicle at its disposal. Performance in 1963: The waterway police alone are called out to 1,096 accidents and have to deal with an international fleet of 6,800 ships on the Rhine.\n\n182: The state provides 950,000 DM for the construction of so-called \"individual police stations\". These are police stations in rural areas. For the police service in rural areas, houses are to be built for police officers and their families, which also have an office where the officer can carry out his duties. The individual police stations also include a stable for keeping small animals and a garage. A total of 250 such police stations are required. The first ten are to be built in 1963 in Elmpt, Bad Sassendorf, Niederndorf, Westerwiehe, Niedermehnen, Witzhelden, Friesheim, Steinenbrück, Ottenstein and Sprakel.\n\n183 Due to the large number of complaints received from citizens against police officers, Interior Minister Weyer has had a \"code of etiquette\" developed for police officers. The first \"red rag\" in dealing with citizens is the question: \"Do you know why I am stopping you?\". Weyer points out that citizens have a right to not be \"treated in a schoolmasterly manner\" by police officers. The ministerial code of conduct also demands, among other things, that officers should not immediately threaten to press charges for coercion if a citizen announces a complaint to the head of the authority or a deputy. Officers should also introduce themselves by name. However, the Minister of the Interior points out that officers will still not have to be harassed by troublemakers and hooligans in the future\n\n184. October 1. Westdeutscher Rundfunk agrees to broadcast traffic warning messages from the police on its VHF program every two hours from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. with immediate effect. Particularly important and urgent messages will even be inserted directly into the current broadcast, if the program schedule permits.\n\n185th State Director of Criminal Investigation Fritz Weber retires. Born in Bergneustadt in 1903, Weber studied political science and law in Giessen, Munich and Frankfurt and joined the police force as a detective inspector in 1926. He made a name for himself in the 1930s as head of the \"Ruhrgebiet\" central homicide squad by solving several difficult murder cases and moved to the Ministry of the Interior in 1954.\n\n186. In 1963, the North Rhine-Westphalian criminal investigation department had 433 cars, almost one in three of which was equipped with radios. In addition, 18 agencies had special forensic vehicles (KSK), commonly known as \"murder vans\". These KSKs, which are not only used for murders but also at other complex crime scenes, are VW buses whose interior serves as a rolling interrogation room, a criminal police command vehicle and a scaffolding vehicle for crime scenes. In addition to radio equipment, the vehicle is equipped with headlights with tripod, a doctor's case, utensils for the \"corpse toilet\", a large set of photographic equipment, including number plates for marking traces, cases with small tools, large tools such as shovels, spades, pickaxes and hatchets, barrier materials, cleaning and packaging materials, a typewriter and a tape recorder as well as a 50-liter water tank and a large awning on the roof. An additional battery also makes the forensic technicians independent of external power sources.\n\n187 Violence against police officers. In 1963, police officers were resisted in almost 1,000 cases in the administrative district of Düsseldorf alone. 388 officers were injured in the process. In 151 cases, batons were used to break the resistance; firearms were only used in 22 cases.\n\n1964\n\n188 At the beginning of 1964, 95% of all police officers in North Rhine-Westphalia belonged to the middle ranks.\n\n189 Dr. Oskar Wenzky is replaced as head of the State Office of Criminal Investigation by Günter Grasner. Grasner, born in 1904, has worked for the police in Schleswig-Holstein, Lower Saxony and finally in NRW since 1929. Wenzky takes over the office of State Director of Criminal Investigation.\n\n190 The helicopter squadron's two Augusta Bell 47 J helicopters prove to be underpowered for certain flight maneuvers and are therefore replaced by two Alouette II Astazou turbine helicopters. The decommissioned Bell helicopters will be taken over by the Hamburg police. Two more Alouette helicopters are to be delivered in the course of the year. Within ten months, the helicopter squadron has flown 171 missions with 470 flight hours with two machines. The most important missions included several cases in which seriously injured people were flown out of inaccessible areas or transported from accident sites and taken to hospitals, as well as aerial surveillance during state visits by the American and French presidents.\n\n191 The working week for police officers is reduced to 44 hours.\n\n192 North Rhine-Westphalia is still the only federal state with its own highway police. The highway police have been considerably expanded since their establishment. It now has 13 police highway stations, each with 2 - 4 Porsche cars, 4 - 6 station wagons, civilian patrol vehicles and 6 - 10 motorcycles. The highway police officers are trained in English in 1964 so that they can also communicate with foreign drivers.\n\n193 Foreign assistance. 20 Afghan police officers and a lieutenant from the Argentinian police are trained in a special course at the state police school in Münster.\n\n194. nail belts for the forced termination of journeys. The police test so-called nail belts to prevent drivers from continuing their journey. The belts, which are rolled out on the road in front of approaching vehicles, prove to be unsuitable for preventing vehicles from continuing their journey. During the test, the spikes of the nail belt get stuck in the tires, but the holes in the tires largely close again, so that the tire air escapes only slowly and the drivers do not immediately lose control of their vehicles.\n\n195th Olympic participant of the NRW police. Three police officers from NRW are among the Olympic athletes at the Tokyo Games. Manfred Knickenberg is competing in the 100 m run, Mathias Schießleder in judo. However, both athletes will be eliminated in Tokyo in the preliminary rounds. The third member of the team, Ernst Streng, wins the gold medal in cycling (four-man team pursuit) and thus becomes the first Olympic winner for the North Rhine-Westphalian police.\n\n196. personnel shortage. In September, there are 1,268 unfilled positions in the NRW police force. The police-to-population ratio has deteriorated drastically since 1954. Back then, one police officer was responsible for 600 residents, but now officers have to look after 702 citizens. In order to achieve the target ratio of 1:600 again, over 5,000 new police officers would have to be recruited. The abolition of more than 1,000 posts between 1954 and 1958, which were to be replaced by technical innovations, is now described by the Minister of the Interior as a mistake.\n\n197 The Career Ordinance is temporarily amended to remedy the personnel problems. Until the end of 1969, it is now possible to recruit older applicants up to the age of 36 into the police force due to a lack of younger applicants. The older applicants recruited on this basis were subsequently given the nickname \"Weyerlinge\", a reference to the initiator of the new regulation, Interior Minister Weyer. Weyer also considered hiring auxiliary police officers who would only be responsible for monitoring stationary traffic, as well as volunteer police assistants who would make themselves available to carry out police duties in their free time.\n\n198 Following a trial period in several authorities, individual patrols are to be increasingly deployed during low-traffic periods and in quiet areas. This is intended to increase visible patrol activity on North Rhine-Westphalia's roads despite the existing staff shortage. Single patrols will only be deployed during the day and only experienced officers will be deployed. The officers freed up by the deployment of single patrols with radio vehicles are to be deployed on foot patrols. This is stipulated in a decree issued by the Minister of the Interior.\n\n1965\n\nJanuary 199. With the introduction of a statutory driving ban, an instrument is created to give drivers who commit serious traffic offenses a kind of warning that their driving license could be revoked. A driving ban prohibits a driver from driving a vehicle for a limited period of time.\n\n200th Establishment of a branch of the \"Erich Klausener\" state police school in Bergkamen-Oberaden for 150 course participants.\n\n201 Boxing training. Boxing training, which was part of the police training curriculum until about ten years ago and then fell into disrepute and was abolished, is now to be reintroduced into police training. In two courses in Hachen, the first riot police instructors are trained as boxing instructors for \"fencing with fists\".\n\n202. duty to instruct suspects. From the beginning of the year, the police have a special duty to instruct suspects under the reformed Code of Criminal Procedure. Persons who are suspected of a crime and are to be questioned must now be informed before questioning that they do not have to provide any information about the case and that they have the right to consult a criminal defense lawyer before making a statement. The latter aspect is highly controversial, not only in police circles but also in the Federal Council. Many fear that the reference to a lawyer will now disrupt and seriously jeopardize police investigations.\n\n203 The NRW police force has 28,900 posts for police officers.\n\n204 In order to make the work of officers on lone patrol easier, patrol cars are now being converted into one-man radio patrol cars. On the one hand, the vehicles are fitted with a rear light that displays the words \"Please follow\" in flashing letters so that drivers no longer have to be stopped with the stop stick. Secondly, a switch will be fitted to the steering wheel to activate the radio transmitter. The driver now only has to speak in the direction of the handset to make radio announcements. Previously, the passenger had to pick up the handset and press a button on the handset to speak.\n\n205 A 51-year-old police officer from Hamburg steals DM 118,000 during a bank robbery in Bad Oeynhausen. He is overpowered by staff during a later bank robbery in Delmenhorst. As he can be proven to have committed a larger series of crimes, he is sentenced to 12 years in prison.\n\n206. doctor's accident kit in patrol cars. 750 police patrol cars have been equipped with doctors' accident kits, which are to be made available to doctors at the scene of accidents for the initial treatment of injured persons.\n\n207 The new State Office for Remuneration and Pensions is responsible for paying the salaries of police officers in future. After the police authorities had maintained their own payment offices until 1956 and then a central salary and pension office was set up in the Ministry of the Interior, the new state office now takes over, although it is not only responsible for police officers, but also for all other state employees.\n\n208. April 1. Walter Baak is appointed the new inspector of the North Rhine-Westphalian police. Born in Switzerland in 1908, Baak joined the police in 1928 and made it to the rank of major in the Schutzpolizei during the Third Reich. After the war, he was appointed deputy head of the water police in Hamburg in 1945. His subsequent positions included that of head of the police in Düsseldorf, Essen and Bonn and positions in the Ministry of the Interior. Baak succeeds Friedrich Quentin, who has reached retirement age.\n\n209 May 18 - 28. The Queen's visit to Germany brings with it one of the largest police operations in North Rhine-Westphalia's history. In NRW, the Queen is staying at Augustusburg Castle in Brühl, among other places. The Queen, who walked with President Heinrich Lübke through the honorary formation of the German Armed Forces on her arrival, will stay in North Rhine-Westphalia for three days. In addition to the federal capital Bonn, other stops in NRW include Düsseldorf and Duisburg.\n\n210. June 10. Due to the personnel shortage in the police force, the Minister of the Interior decrees that all police officers who have recruited a prospective employee as part of an individual recruitment drive and who is subsequently hired will receive book prizes worth DM 20. In addition, a large proportion of police authorities now grant officers who have recruited a candidate who at least appears for the selection test a day off duty as a reward.\n\n211 In Essen, a police film and image center is set up at the State Police School for Technology and Traffic. Due to the high cost of educational films made by external production companies, the decision was made to make their own films within the police force and lend them to police stations. The first in-house police production is the film \"The Harmless Lovers\", which describes how police officers protect themselves when intervening. This is followed by numerous other films for the recruitment of new recruits as well as criminal and tactical topics. Films are also made for optical space shooting systems.\n\n212. August 27. Police officer fatally shoots another officer. During the night-time arrest of a car thief, Detective Superintendent Peter Baum is critically injured by a shot fired by a colleague from Cologne. The officer finally dies on Christmas Eve as a result of his injuries following several brain operations and jaundice.\n\n213. In 1965, North Rhine-Westphalian police officers use firearms in 160 cases. Warning shots are fired 64 times, targeted shots 96 times. In 30 cases people are injured, in six cases there are fatalities.\n\n214. November 8. Police officer killed. In Remscheid, police sergeant Karl Sewing is shot through the side window of his patrol car by a criminal known to the police for no apparent reason.\n\n215th new recruitment: In 1965, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia recruits a total of 2,546 new officers to the uniformed police service in an attempt to counteract the foreseeable shortage of personnel due to retirement. Around 1,200 officers are younger, 1,200 older, and more than 100 officers are transferred from the BGS. Due to the oversupply of jobs in the private and public sectors, it has been difficult in recent years to find a sufficient number of suitable applicants for the police positions on offer.\n\n216. equipment of the Water Police (WSP): The WSP in NRW is currently equipped with several different types of boats. The standard police boat has a length of 15.5 m, is 3.20 m wide and has a draught of 1.1 m. The boats are each equipped with an 8-cylinder Deutz diesel engine with 155 hp and reach a speed of 22 to 25 km/h, depending on the water conditions. The WSP 5, a Rhine radar boat, has a length of 17 m and has two Deutz diesel engines with a combined output of 560 hp and a top speed of 43 km/h. The crew consists of 3 - 4 officers. In addition, canal boats with a length of 12 m, an engine with 100 HP and a top speed of 22 km/h are operated. There are also police inflatable boats and light aluminum boats with outboard motors to monitor water sports traffic and bathing operations.\n\n217 New service pistol: The previous 9 mm caliber police pistol is replaced by a smaller weapon (Walther PPK) with a caliber of 7.65 mm. The first examples of the new weapon are delivered in 1965.\n\n218th Drunk police officers at the wheel: In 1965, blood samples had to be taken from 125 police officers in North Rhine-Westphalia who were caught driving under the influence of alcohol. 92 of them had a blood alcohol concentration of more than one per mille, and 27 of them were even measured at more than two per mille. In the two previous years, there had been a similar number of drunk driving incidents involving police officers.\n\n1966\n\n219 February 16. The first inspector of the police, Karl Bremer, dies at the age of 70. He had held the office from 1948 to 1956.\n\n220. June 21. The Langenberg serial killer Jürgen Bartsch is arrested and imprisoned by the police. Between 1962 and 1966, Bartsch had gradually lured four boys aged between 8 and 13 into an air raid shelter, tortured them there and killed them cruelly. The police tracked down the pedophile, who was 19 years old at the time of his arrest, after a fifth victim managed to escape from the bunker and inform the police. Bartsch was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1967, but died in 1976 after an anesthetic accident during his castration. The Essen criminal investigation department set up a 25-strong homicide squad in 1966 after a connection between several of the crimes was suspected. The investigation also made extensive use of public searches. For example, a few days before Bartsch was arrested, a police loudspeaker van drove through the Georg Melches Stadium in Essen during the half-time break of the Red-White-Essen v Saarbrücken match. Larger-than-life photos of the missing children were mounted on the vehicle. In addition, 30 police and criminal investigation officers distributed 26,000 flyers among the fans.\n\n221. October 25: The police helicopter squadron is divided into the \"Rhineland\" and \"Westphalia\" squadrons. While the \"Rhineland\" squadron remains in Düsseldorf, the \"Westphalia\" squadron moves to Dortmund. Each sub-squadron is made up of a squadron commander, four helicopter commanders and four flight attendants.\n\n222 The NRW police force has 30,200 posts for police officers.\n\n223 NRW police officers receive a new uniform. The first sets of green-coated suits are issued in spring 1966. In future, the uniform will no longer have an external waist belt and the baton will be carried concealed in a pocket in the right trouser leg. The new small police pistol can be worn both on the outside and concealed. The trouser legs are cut much tighter than on the old uniforms. Unlike the old ones, the new suit jackets no longer have patch pockets on the outside. This gives the uniform a less military look overall. The cost of the initial outfitting is DM 240 per man.\n\n224 Further branches of the \"Erich Klausener\" state police school are set up in Altena and Stukenbrock.\n\n225. May 18.
