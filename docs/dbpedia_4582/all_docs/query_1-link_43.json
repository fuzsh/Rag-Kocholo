Luden\n\n* 16.07.1815 in Jena\n\n† 07.03.1902 in Jena\n\nAlongside Johann Friedrich August Göttling (1753-1809) and Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner (1780-1849), Heinrich Wackenroder shaped the founding years of pharmacy in Jena. Wackenroder discovered carotene, also known as pro-vitamin A, in carrots. The human body forms retinin from carotene, without which humans could not see. Wackenroder also isolated the plant alkaloid corydalin and pentathionic acid. He was a modest, witty professor who expected exemplary moral conduct and sole devotion to study from his students. The son of a pharmacist, Wackenroder received his basic training in two pharmacies before completing his habilitation in 1828 after studies in Göttingen and Erlangen. With his appointment in the same year, he took over the management of the private Pharmaceutical Institute in Jena, which had been founded in 1821. To do so, he had to obtain a loan to buy the institution from his predecessor, which burdened him economically for years. For the first time in 1830, Wackenroder received a small salary for his teaching activities. After Döbereiner's death in 1849, he became a full professor. In addition to the legally secure training of pharmacists, pharmaceutical analysis as the basis for drug safety was close to his heart. Consequently, he became a pharmacy inspector in the Grand Duchy of Saxony-Weimar-Eisenach and in the Duchy of Saxony-Altenburg. In 1849, Wackenroder founded the \"Pharmazeutisch-naturwissenschaftlicher Verein zu Jena,\" was a journal editor and textbook author. He was a highly respected member of twenty scientific academies and societies. With his wife Wilhelmine, 26 years his junior and a daughter of his colleague Luden, he had five children. The list of godparents shows that numerous families of scholars were friends with him far beyond Thuringia. The death of his four-year-old daughter further undermined his frail health; he died four months after her. The Wackenroder pharmacy keeps his name alive in Jena. The rococo tombstone found its reuse by the Wackenroder family in the 19th century. Its three angels stand for faith, love and hope in reference to the apostle Paul.\n\n© Th.

The progenitor of the fencing dynasty Wilhelm Kreußler (1597-1673) had settled in the city as a \"student fencer\" in 1619, one year after the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War. In 1669, 50 years after his arrival in Jena, Wilhelm Kreußler was granted the privilege of a fencing master by the Duke of Weimar, Johann Ernst, for himself and his two sons Gottfried and Friedrich. With this privilege, Wilhelm Kreußler had obtained territorial protection for himself and his heirs to teach fencing at the university and in the city of Jena. Wilhelm Kreußler's fencing floor is said to have been located in a superstructure on a city wall tower, known today as the \"Red Tower\". His younger son Friedrich helped teach under his father. When Friedrich died in 1707, the existence of the old Kreußler fencing ground on the Rotem Turm came to an end. Wilhelm Kreußler's eldest son Gottfried (1624-1682) had his own fencing ground, which today was located approximately \"Unterm Markt\" in the Urlauschen Haus. Gottfried's son, Johann Wilhelm Kreußler took over the fencing ground after his father's death in 1682. One year later the ducal privilege was transferred to the just 19 year old. There is a legend about Johann Wilhelm Kreußler, called \"the Lion\", that in 1712 he disarmed and defeated the Saxon Elector August the Strong in a fencing match in disguise. Upon this, the Elector is said to have exclaimed, \"Either you are Beelzebub himself, or ... the Kreussler of Jena!\" to which Kreußler bowed and replied, \"The latter, Electoral Grace!\" Johann Wilhelm Kreußler was followed by his son Heinrich Wilhelm (1690-1752) and the adopted Johann Wolfgang Bieglein (d. 1780) as the last privileged fencing masters of the Kreußler fencing dynasty. The tomb of the Kreußler family is one of the most beautiful monuments in the cemetery: the figure of the winged god of time with the hourglass in raised hand, next to it the female figures of faith and hope. Decorations such as acanthus and a coat of arms adorn the tomb. In Jena, Kreußlerstraße commemorates this sporting family.\n\n© Ch.

Carl August and Goethe\n\nThe pharmacist Immanuel Christian Wilhelmi was known in the city as an eccentric with a somewhat derb-witty sense of humor. He worked for many years as a provisor, i.e. journeyman pharmacist, with the court pharmacist Immanuel Christoph Heßling. After his death, he was Anna Amalia in 1770 to run the court pharmacy at the Jena market. Jena market. Wilhelmi was married twice, first to the widow of Heßling's widow and, after her death, to the wealthy widow of an innkeeper. Many stories and jokes were circulated about this strange fellow. Thus he always wore a yellow robe that smelled of the essences of his trade and the of his trade and the meals of the past days. Besides his pharmacy he successfully ran a wholesale wine shop. Often even the Grand Duke Carl August of Weimar would come over and have breakfast at the court apothecary's to to enjoy the wine cellar and Wilhelmi's coarseness. Also with the\n\nWilhelmi was also on good terms with the students at the university and was popular and was popular with them because of his generosity.

In his last will and testament, Immanuel Christian Wilhelmi made it his duty to his heirs to provide him with a gravestone, \"but not a shabby one, but one that will not disgrace me or him\", and to have an inscription written by himself placed on it. written by himself. The grave monument, designed in noble simplicity, is, as it were, a stone calling card. a stone calling card: \"Me, Immanuel Christian Wilhelmi, born on September 3, 1745, was court pharmacist, Kommerzienrath, also once postmaster, lived troubled by many a doubt, but did not die unprepared.

Trusting in an all-powerful and all-good God, I have lived 81 years and now I will become dust and ashes”.\n\nOn the On the back of the pedestal is written: \"Honesty, Friendship, love and wine was his element and benevolence his practice.\"\n\n© C. Mann\n\nBruno Hildebrand\n\n* 06.03.1812 in Naumburg/Saale\n\n† 29.01.1878 in Jena\n\nProfessor, statistician, politician\n\nBruno Hildebrand had prepared for the Gymnasium without the knowledge of his parents and received a free position in Schulpforta. After one semester of theology at the University of Leipzig he changed to the study of philosophy, philology and history. He was a follower of the \"Alte Leipziger Burschenschaft Germania\". Persecuted because of this membership, he went to Breslau. He received his doctorate in 1836 in Breslau and habilitated in the same year. Appointed associate professor in Breslau in 1839, Bruno Hildebrand accepted the chair of political science at the University of Marburg in 1841. There he wrote his main work on national economics, a critique of the existing economic system. As prorector of the university, Hildebrand had defended politically active students against the government. His suspension from teaching in February 1847 was not lifted until the general amnesty in March 1848; a criminal case against him ended in acquittal. Hildebrand was henceforth absorbed by politics, representing the Marburg constituency in the Frankfurt National Assembly. There he was particularly committed to solving traffic problems. Political differences again resulted in an arrest warrant in Hesse, which Hildebrand was able to evade by fleeing to Switzerland in 1851. He was hospitably received in Zurich. He received a professorship in political science and was able to join his family. Bruno Hildebrand had been married to Clementine Guttentag since 1839. The first-born son Richard later also became a national economist. Quarrels in Bern, where Bruno Hildebrand had been a professor of national economics and co-founder and director of the East-West Railway since 1856, led him to accept a call to the University of Jena in 1861. Here, in turn, he also demonstrated his organizational skills as director of the Statistical Office of the Thuringian States. His work in Jena was also responsible for the construction of the Saalebahn and the Weimar-Gera railroad. In Jena, Hildebrandstrasse commemorates him. The portrait bust on his grave was created by his son, the sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand, who was ennobled in 1903.\n\n© Ch. Apfel\n\nEmanuel Sinowiewitsch Rabinowitsch (1850–1884)\n\nRabinowitsch, of Jewish descent, was born in Kherson, Russia.\n\nHe was a journalist and it can be assumed that he was in the practice of his profession in 1884 in Jena.\n\nHe was married to Minna née Stanislawsky, that can be inferred from the civil death register.\n\nAccording to the inscription on his gravestone, his parents and one brother were still alive at the time of his death.\n\nThe Hebrew inscription on the west side of the pedestal follows the \"form\", i.e. the basic pattern of Hebrew tomb inscriptions. We do not know who thought about and executed these inscriptions, which indicate the exact knowledge and deep relations with Jewish rituals.\n\nUnfortunately, we cannot answer any of the questions why Rabinowitsch was in Jena, nor about the cause of his early death and why he was buried as a Jew in the Johannis cemetery, since no sources could be found for this.\n\n© B. Jelke, gekürzt: Ch. Apfel\n\nFriedrich Siegmund Voigt (1781–1850)\n\nBotanist\n\nVoigt was born on 1 Oct 1781 in Gotha. His father, the mathematician and later Jena professor Johann Heinrich Voigt (1751-1823), the mother, Charlotte Eleonore Hediwg née Blumenbach (1727-1794), was the daughter of the prorector at the Gymnasium in Gotha Heinrich Blumenbach (1709-1787).\n\nIn 1789 he came to Jena with his father when he was appointed to the alma mater.\n\nHe studied natural sciences . In 1893 he received a doctorate in philosophy and habilitated as a private lecturer in botany. He began lecturing in the fall semester of 1804.\n\nGoethe became aware of him because he spread Goethe's methamorphosis doctrine through words and writings. Goethe promoted him strongly, so that he could undertake several study trips, among other things, to Paris, London Florence and Rome from 1809. On his travels he also met with Humboldt, Jussieu and Cuvier.\n\nIn 1810 he was appointed as a full professor, received the title of a Bergrat and later that of a Sächsisch-Weimarischen Geheimen Hofrat.\n\nIn 1827 he called himself professor of medicine and in 1835 professor of medicine and botany.\n\nHe was married to Susette von Loevenich.\n\nDue to the turmoil of the Battle of Jena and Auerststedt, in which the Botanical Garden at the Fürstengraben suffered severe war damage and the director, Franz-Josef Schelver (1778-1832) had left the city in flight, Friedrich Siegmund Voigt became director of the Botanical Garden on Goethe's recommendation.\n\nHe rebuilt the botanical garden and designed it according to new principles (Jussieu's system), always accompanied by Goethe's interest and participation.\n\nVoigt was a member of the Academy of Sciences in Göttingen and in 1821 he was elected a member of Leopldina.\n\nFriedrich Siegmund Voigt died in Jena on December 10, 1850.\n\n© Ch.Apfel"
