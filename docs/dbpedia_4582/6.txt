Rev. Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum

1824 — 1906

Biographical Material & Chronology

This paragraph is taken from a letter written in June 1867 by the pastor of the evangelical church at Lengerich, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia. In response to a inquiry from the Fiegenbaum family in Madison County, Illinois, Rev. Kolemann (spelling?) had consulted the registers of the church to confirm the births of Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum and his brother, Friedrich Wilhelm Fiegenbaum.

The role of itinerant missionaries in the family's life in Missouri is also described in a similar essay written by Wilhelm's brother, Heinrich Hermann Fiegenbaum, in an autobiographical sketch written by his sister, Marie Wilhelmine (Fiegenbaum) Winter, and in an article about the Fiegenbaums, published in the St. Louis Post Dispatch in 1898.

Another brother, Friedrich Wilhelm Fiegenbaum, wrote a less formal but more impassioned statement of his experiences as a pastor in the German Methodist Episcopal Church.

Notes to Article on the German M. E. Church at Highland, Illinois

The German Methodist Church [at Wisetown, or Beaver Creek, Beaver Creek Precinct, Bond County, Illinois] was built in 1865, and cost about $1,400. The society was first organized in 1850.... The first minister was Rev. W. Fiegenbaum, who organized the church....

On Wednesday, 4 June 1896, the annual meeting of the Old Settlers Union of Madison County was held at St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church at Edwardsville, Illinois. In the afternoon session of the gathering, some elderly members each spoke for about five minutes about their early experiences.

Rev. Wm. Fiegenbaum, who arrived in the county in 1834, told of the old market on the levee at the foot of Market street in St. Louis, and recited his pioneer experience as a Methodist preacher, one of his journeys being 245 miles to preach 16 times.

Although the account in the local newspaper reported that Rev. Fiegenbaum had arrived in the county in 1834, I believe this is not quite accurate. It appears to be true that his family did arrive in the U.S.A. in 1834, when Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum was 10 years old, but by all accounts they settled in eastern Missouri, very likely in the southern part of St. Charles County, not far from the village of Femme Osage. It was probably here that Wilhelm's parents converted to Methodism in 1844. He followed suit a few years later and in 1848 was appointed the first resident pastor at Highland, Madison County, Illinois. I think this was his earliest appearance in Illinois.

Rev. Fiegenbaum spent the rest of his adult life in service to the German Methodist Epicopal Church. Many of his early charges, whether as a regular pastor or a presiding elder, did involve condsiderable travel over large areas of the countryside.

Wilhelm Fiegenbaum, der im Alter von 82 Jahren als superannuiertes Mitglied der St. Louis Deutschen Konferenz seinen Lebensabend in Edwardsville, Ill., zubringt, teilt in einigen Zeilen Folgendes über seine Wirksamkeit in dem Gebiet unserer Konferenz mit: "Die Chariton-Mission, später die Brunswick and Carrolton-Mission, wurde im März 1847 begonnen. Glasgow, Brunswick, Carrolton, sowie die Landsettlements in ihrer Nähe, wo Deutsche wohnten, wurden besucht. In 18 Monaten hatten sich etwa 65 Personen angeschlossen und in Brunswick und auf dem Lande bei Carrolton wurden Kirchen erbaut durch den 'jungen Kandidaten', wie Vater Köneke ihn nannte. Von September 1854 bis September 1856 war ich thätig als Vorstehender Aeltester des Missouri-Distrikts, der sich von Jefferson City bis hinauf durch Kansas und eine Ecke von Nebraska auf beiden Seiten des Missouri-Stromes erstreckte. In 1875 wurde ich nach Oregon, Mo., gesandt, welche Bestellung ich ein Jahr bediente."

Wilhelm Fiegenbaum, who at age 82 as a superannuated member of the St. Louis German Conference spends his evening years in Edwardsville, Ill. communicates in a few lines the following about his effectiveness in the area of our conference: "The Chariton Mission, later the Brunswick and Carrolton Mission, was begun in March 1847. Glasgow, Brunswick, Carrolton, as well as German settlements in the area, were visited. In 18 months about 65 people joined the church and in Brunswick and the area around Carrolton churches were built by the 'young candidate,' as Father Köneke called him. From September 1854 to September 1856, I was active as the presiding elder of the Missouri District, which stretched from Jefferson City through Kansas and a corner of Nebraska along both sides of the Missouri River. In 1875, I was sent to Oregon, Mo., where I served for one year."

Notes

Chronology

Tracking Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum and his family over the course of his career as a Methodist minister throughout the middle-western states is no easy task. Despite scattered references and sometimes contradictory accounts, the following chronology is emerging.

19 December 1793

Hermann Wilhelm's father, Adolph Heinrich Fiegenbaum, was born at Ladbergen, Grafschaft Tecklenburg (County Tecklenburg) in northwestern Germany.

5 March; about 1796

Hermann Wilhelm's mother, Christine Elisabeth Peterjohann, was born. This may have been at Lengerich, a village next door to Ladbergen. The exact year of birth is also not known; it was sometime between 1795 and 1797.

25 October 1820

Adolph Heinrich Fiegenbaum and Christine Elisabeth Peterjohann were married in the evangelical church at Ladbergen, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia (the shifting administrative geography of this time period is outline in the web page on Ladbergen.

17 September 1824

Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum, Adolph and Christine's second child, was born at Lengerich, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia. 1 In his adult years he was commonly referred to by his second given name - Wilhelm or William. An older brother had been born in 1821 and three more brothers and a sister were born between 1827 and 1837.

2 February 1826

Sophia Gusewelle, the eldest of eight children, was born at Polhagen, Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe.

1834

Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum was 10 years old when his father (age 40), his mother (age 37), and four siblings (ages 13 years to about 9 months) emigrated from Lengerich, Kingdom of Prussia. In 1898, Wilhelm recalled the event:

When our mother and father and their five children – Rudolph had not been born then – landed at New Orleans, we were penniless. Henry, the oldest, was 12 years old, and Minnie, the youngest, was only a baby

The family is reported to have disembarked at New Orleans, Louisiana in late June 1834 and to have traveled up the Mississippi by steamboat, arriving at St. Louis, Missouri about 3 or 4 July. They appear to have settled initially in Femme Osage Township, St. Charles County, Missouri. 2

2 January 1837

A brother, Heinrich Rudolph, was born in St. Charles County, Missouri. The birth and his baptism on 5 February 1837 were recorded in the baptismal register of the German evangelical church at Femme Osage, Missouri (founded in 1833 as the deutsche evangelische Kirchegemeinde and known since 1957 as Femme Osage United Church of Christ).

2 April 1838

In St. Charles County Circuit Court, the father, Adolph Fiegenbaum declared his intention to become a citizen of the USA.

June 1840

The federal census of 1840 illustrates the difficulty of establishing where the Fiegenbaum-Peterjohann family resided during their early years in Missouri. The census provides the name of only the head of each household and then a count of the number of people of each sex in the household who fall into a range of ages. For example, the number of males less than 5 years of age; the number of males 5 years to less than 10 years of age; the number of males 10 years to less than 15 years of age; etc.

The census enumerated eight people living in the "A. Frigenbottom" household in Femme Osage Township, St. Charles County, Missouri.

The census also enumerated eight people living in the "Rudolph Feigenbaum" household in Charrette Township, Warren County, Missouri (in a St. Louis Post-Dispatch article in 1898, Herman Wilhelm Fiegenbaum referred to his father as Rudolph).

In each enumeration, the total number of male and female members of the households was what would be expected based on information provided by other genealogical sources, but the distribution among age groups raises questions which have not yet been answered.

1 October 1840

Adolph obtained a federal land patent in St. Louis, Missouri for 40 acres of land in St. Charles County, east of the village of Femme Osage.

1841

The extended family of one of Hermann Wilhelm's uncles (his father's elder brother), Johann Heinrich Fiegenbaum, numbering a group of at least 13 people, emigrated from Ladbergen, Province of Westphalia, Kingdom of Prussia. They landed at Baltimore, Maryland on 28 June 1841 and settled in the area of Hopewell and Holstein, in neighboring Warren County, Missouri (see the passenger list of the bark, Leontine).

1 August 1844

Hermann Wilhelm's father obtained a federal land patent in St. Louis, Missouri for 81.47 acres of land in the area of Hopewell and Holstein, in neighboring Warren County, where his uncle's family had settled.

1844

In an article about the family in the St. Louis Post Dispatch in 1898, Hermann Wilhelm recalled: "Mother had in former years admonished us against the doctrine of the Methodists, but this preacher changed her mind. She embraced the creed, as did all of us, in brief time. That was in 1844...."

1846 – 1848

Sophia Gusewelle emigrated to the USA sometime during this time; the exact time has not yet been determined.

1847

Hermann Wilhelm was licensed as an exhorter in the German Methodist Episcopal Church.

1847 – 1848

Wilhelm served the new Chariton Mission which included Brunswick, Dalton, and Glasgow in Chariton County, and Carrollton in Carroll County, Missouri.

The mission at that time already embraced a large territory and many appointments. It included Edwardsville, Fosterburg, Staunton, Looking Glass Prairie, Beaver Creek, Blackjack, Smooth Prairie, Silver Creek, Ridge Prairie, The Bluffs, Moro and Upper Alton. The membership in the whole field of labor numbered 67 at the time the church was dedicated [in June 1849]. Rev. Wm. Fiegenbaum was in charge of the mission with two assistant preachers. They were Rev. J. Keck and Rev. Herman Koch…. from the historical sketch, above.

27 September 1849

Hermann Wilhelm Fiegenbaum and Sophia Gusewelle were married at St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri.

1850

The 1850 U.S. Census found Hermann Wilhelm's parents and two younger brothers living in Wapello Township, Louisa County, Iowa. According to the enumeration, the household was composed of Adolph (age 57), a farmer; Christine (age 54); Frederick (age 21), a day laborer; and, Rudolph (age 14).

The Fiegenbaum-Gusewelle household in this census had not yet been discovered.

15 August 1851

A son, Friedrich Adolph, was born at Watertown, Jefferson County, Wisconsin. 3 About one month later, on 14 September 1851, Friedrich was baptized in the German Methodist Church at Beardstown, Cass County, Illinois. This is perhaps some indication of how mobile was the life of a minister in the German Methodist Episcopal Church and, of course, his family.
