        "text": "What challenge was the client aiming to solve?\n\nThe lack of an efficient delivery system for ongoing education that prevents top managers and C-level executives from quickly and conveniently enhancing their skills. They sought a user-friendly solution that integrated a constantly updating knowledge base, easy course navigation, as well as examination and progress tracking features.\n\nWhat did Oxagile come up with?\n\nAn advanced eLearning platform that supports 10,000+ concurrent users and allows managers to easily enroll in courses, take exams, and communicate with colleagues around the world.\n\nStep 1. Detailed project roadmap\n\n“We conducted an extensive analysis of the business in close collaboration with client-side specialists to shape a robust eLearning strategy for the long haul and crafted detailed learner roadmaps, so as not to miss any of the important features. We made sure to not only highlight the needs of our key stakeholders, but also reflect the unique brand and culture of the organization.”\n\nStep 2. Full-scale development\n\n“Upon completing the thorough design of the project’s architecture, we commenced the full development of the platform, consistently providing the client with access to interim reports and test results. Our primary focus was that while integrating diverse functionalities, the platform remained uncluttered by details with an easily navigable and intuitively usable interface.”\n\nStep 3. Ensuring scalability\n\n“The client was worried that the platform might need technical support from system administrators to run smoothly under heavy loads. So, our experienced QA team conducted stress testing and ensured that the solution could effortlessly accommodate thousands of simultaneous learners without requiring any additional support whatsoever.”"
