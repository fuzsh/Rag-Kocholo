        "text": "I spent the day today at the DigiDay:Apps Mobile Application Strategy Conference. Agenda on Digiday’s site.\n\nBelow are my brief notes from a few of the talks.\n\nApp Show and Tell Part II: Presenter:Gabe Dorosz, VP & Management Supervisor, Interactive, Cramer-Krasselt\n\nDownloading apps currently is difficult because there are too many handsets/platforms, lack of platform detection infrastructure.\n\nConsumers don’t necessarily care whether utility is served as app, web app, etc – as long as it works.\n\nInstallable Mobile Applications\n\nPros – Always on – no network necessary, depth of engagement, leverage of device features and full power, trafficking in app store\n\nCons – Cost of development (up to 250K), platform fragmentation, time to market (approval process), distribution and maintenance channels, increased competition (currently)\n\nCross-Platform Apps are by far the most popular and successful aps\n\nTop application platforms in international markets: iPhone, Android, Symbian, Web.\n\nNot Just Fun and Games: Driving Revenue with Game Apps and Virtual Goods:\n\nAdam Broitman: Moderator\n\nAdam Boyden – Conduit: Big challenge faced by developers is the multitude of platforms out there. Increasing market fragmentation dictates that applications must be available everywhere.\n\nThree Rules for Monetizing Social Games: 1. It’s all about friends. 2. It’s all about community. Get people to talk about the game outside of playing the game. 3. Involve players in success of the game – listen to your players.\n\nNima Pourshasb – Live Gamer: Market for “virtual goods” is already established, and is growing. Multi-billion dollar scales for virtual goods – EA, Zygna. As payment methods evolve, less friction to putting money into virtual economies\n\nJoe Monastiero – appMobi: Cloud SDK’s could allow mobile developers to migrate games and applications into the cloud for cross platform compatibility\n\nRob Oshima – Funmobility: The way that brands are currently getting involved in virtual economies is actually driving CPMs down. Brands are buying ads that simply aren’t working very well, even in good games.\n\n3:40pm: Apps: The Next Frontier in Video:"
