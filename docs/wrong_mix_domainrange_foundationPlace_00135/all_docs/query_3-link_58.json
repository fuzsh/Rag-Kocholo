The email must be unread/new at gmail box or it won't be read by the rake because it thinks it already read it.\n\nAnother gotcha: 993 blocked by firewall between redmine and gmail.\n\nCheck the rails log/production.log right after running the rake - check if there's some error message about the mail.\n\nAssuming the rake task is reading and changing the status in gmail, then it might be the parameters. I notice your ssl is different from what I had."
