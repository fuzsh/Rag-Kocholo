        "text": "Digital Accessibility: A Win-Win for Retail and Hospitality Businesses in 2023\n\nThe digital era has brought about significant opportunities and challenges for businesses, particularly in the retail and hospitality sectors. Websites and mobile apps have become essential tools for attracting customers and employees alike. However, it is crucial to ensure that these platforms are accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities.\n\nCustomers’ Interaction with Your Digital Presence\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 15% of the world’s population has some sort of disability. However, many websites are not designed to be accessible to those with disabilities. AbilityNet reports that a staggering 90% of websites are not accessible to people with disabilities who rely on assistive technology.\n\nIn the U.S., more than half of the population with disabilities has internet access, and those who don’t go online cite the lack of accessibility as a key reason. Therefore, creating an accessible digital presence can significantly expand your customer base and drive more sales. Here’s why:\n\nIncrease Revenue and Market Share\n\nRetailers and food service companies are among the most cited in digital accessibility lawsuits. In contrast, companies with accessible websites can gain a competitive advantage by tapping into the half-trillion dollars spent annually by people with disabilities. According to Click-Away Pound, 73% of people in the U.K. with disabilities are unable to complete transactions on more than a quarter of the websites they visit.\n\nEnhance Customer Experience\n\nAccessible websites improve the user experience for all visitors, not just those with disabilities. For example, offering text alternatives for images benefits people with visual impairments, while also enhancing SEO and helping search engines index the content.\n\nAvoid Legal Risks\n\nDigital accessibility lawsuits have been on the rise, with many retailers and hospitality businesses facing legal claims for failing to provide accessible websites and apps. By making your digital presence accessible, you can reduce the risk of litigation and the associated costs.\n\nPotential Candidates and Employees’ Interaction with Your Digital Presence\n\nIn addition to customers, businesses need to consider the accessibility of their careers websites for potential candidates and employees with disabilities. As mentioned in the SHRM articles, making your careers website accessible to all is not just a legal requirement but also a smart business strategy.\n\nAttract a Diverse Talent Pool\n\nHaving an accessible careers website allows you to attract a broader range of candidates, including those with disabilities. By showcasing your commitment to inclusion, you can enhance your employer brand and appeal to a diverse workforce.\n\nComply with Legal Requirements\n\nSeveral laws require businesses to make their digital properties accessible to people with disabilities. In the U.S., these include the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act. Non-compliance with these regulations can result in legal action and financial penalties.\n\nProvide a Better Candidate Experience\n\nAn accessible careers website can improve the candidate experience and help you stand out as an employer of choice. By making the application process smooth and inclusive, you can attract and retain top talent.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nDigital accessibility is more than just a legal requirement; it is a moral and ethical responsibility. By creating an accessible digital presence, retail and hospitality businesses can provide a better experience for all customers and employees, drive more sales, and avoid legal risks.\n\nAt ZippyApp, we understand the importance of digital accessibility and are committed to helping businesses create an inclusive digital presence. Contact us today to learn more about how we can help you embrace digital inclusion in 2023.\n\nNavigating the Wilderness of Job Hunting\n\nA job search can often feel like being adrift in a forest, beset on all sides by the overgrowth of indecision, misinformation, and incessant, silent rejections. Like Steve Jobs, I believe in challenging the status quo, and like one of my favorite wilderness authors Patrick F. McManus, I reckon there’s an inherent humor and a nugget of wisdom nestled in the heart of every obstacle. So, let’s put on our boots, grab our trusty metaphorical compass and navigate our way through the top 10 common job search difficulties of 2023.\n\n1. Lack of clarity about job goals\n\nLife isn’t about connecting the dots looking forward. But you do need to know the general direction where the dots are. If you’re not sure, think about what you loved doing as a kid. What was that one thing that made the hours slip away unnoticed? Start from there and work backwards.\n\n2. Fear of rejection\n\nIn the wilderness, fear is not your enemy, but complacency is. Remember, as Steve Jobs said, “you’ve got to be willing to crash and burn.” Rejection is just a sign that you’re pushing boundaries. Keep pushing.\n\n3. Dealing with job search stress\n\nIf stress were a bear, most of us would be up a tree without a paddle. Or maybe up a creek without a tree. The point is, it’s a challenge. Remember to relax and find humor in your predicament. Believe me, you’ll laugh about all this someday.\n\n4. Difficulty finding jobs in your field\n\nImagine you’re in the wilderness and you can’t find the elusive elk. Do you give up? No, you become the elk. Understand the mindset of your employers. Find their watering holes (LinkedIn, Industry forums) and make your presence known.\n\n5. Handling the Silent Treatment\n\nWhen you shout out into the wilderness and only echoes respond, it’s easy to feel lost. But silence isn’t a sign you’re off track. It’s just a quiet stretch on your journey. Keep walking, keep shouting, and someone will hear you.\n\n6. Sifting through too much information\n\nThe Internet is a forest where every tree looks identical and each is shouting for your attention. To navigate, you need to develop an instinct for what’s important, what’s superfluous, and what’s a squirrel trying to sell you insurance.\n\n7. Balancing current job with job search\n\nIt’s like trying to pitch a tent in a windstorm while fighting off a raccoon with your other hand. Keep your focus, prioritize your time, and maybe throw the raccoon a sandwich to buy some peace. Remember, there’s a time for everything.\n\n8. Lack of confidence\n\nIn the grand narrative of your life, confidence is the hero, self-doubt the villain, and the wilderness is your stage. Write a story where the hero wins. Confidence comes from action, from overcoming, and from finding laughter in the face of adversity.\n\n9. Long, drawn-out application processes\n\nJob applications can sometimes feel like trying to assemble a tent using an oar, a fishing hook, and duct tape. But remember, persistence pays off. Every step forward, no matter how small, is still a step forward.\n\n10. Ineffective networking\n\nSome people seem to be born networkers, just like some people seem to be born with an uncanny sense of direction. But networking is a skill you can learn. Start by being genuinely interested in other people and remember, everyone you meet knows something you don’t.\n\nNavigating the job search wilderness is no easy task. It’s full of winding paths, steep hills, and perhaps the occasional grizzly bear. But with the right mindset, a good sense of humor, and a trusty compass in hand, you can make your way through it and reach your destination. So, lace up those boots, roll up your sleeves, and step confidently into the wilderness.\n\nAnd remember, you don’t have to navigate this wilderness alone. ZippyApp is here to guide you, providing insights, job listings, and a community of fellow adventurers. We invite you to follow us on LinkedIn and Facebook for more advice, updates, and a dash of humor to brighten your journey. As you push forward on your path, let ZippyApp be your companion.\n\n5 Tips to Landing a Seasonal Job\n\nAre you looking to earn some extra spending money over the holidays through a seasonal job? You aren’t alone. Retailers are expected to add 755,000 temporary jobs this holiday season, and restaurant owners are preparing for high-volume traffic as shoppers wallets start to loosen for the holidays. This means the race is on to land a seasonal job!\n\nWhile the “old way” of applying is still around, via paper applications and walk-in interviews, many companies have taken to mobile to streamline their apply and hiring processes (which is where we step in).\n\nIf you are looking to land a seasonal job, you’ll need to know what seasonal employers are looking for. Here are some things to add to your ZippyApp application so you can stand out from the pack and land the seasonal job you are looking for!\n\nBe flexible with your schedule.Are you able to work extended holiday hours and weekends? Hourly employers are on the lookout for you! A flexible work schedule is one of the first things a seasonal employer will look for on your application, so be sure to include the days, times, and hours you are available to work. But don’t say you are available certain days and times when you really aren’t – a tactic used by some just to land a job. Your employer will soon find out you are not as available as they initially thought, and could quickly find a replacement that offers a more flexible schedule.\n\nPlay up your previous experience. Busy holiday hours means less time for training, so seasonal employers will be on the lookout for experienced workers. But just because you haven’t worked in a retail or restaurant setting before doesn’t mean you will be passed over. Do you have any customer service or customer support experience? Highlight those on your ZippyApp application.\n\nShow off your personality and attitude.Dealing with stressed out shoppers and diners is not something everyone can handle. Utilize our video resume feature to show off your positive attitude and bubbly personality. Then, give examples of how you have been able to turn a negative situation into a positive guest experience.\n\nHighlight your ability to multi-task. Seasonal job descriptions don’t mirror regular ones because oftentimes, seasonal workers have to wear many hats. Seasonal employers want to get the most they can out of each worker rather than have each worker do one set job. Include on your ZippyApp application all of the tasks and duties you have performed in past jobs, and include keywords such as “multi-task” and “fast-paced” to show you can handle busy holiday crowds.\n\nDemonstrate you are a fast learner.Showing you have exceled in past jobs can demonstrate to seasonal employers that you are quick learner. As we mentioned previously, seasonal employers don’t have much time and resources to train you during busy holiday months, so you will need to prove you can hit the ground running in your new role. Some ways to do this? Include that promotion you received after only a few months at your last job, or when you took on other duties that were not a part of your initial job description.\n\nCelebrity First Hourly Jobs\n\nDid you know some of today’s most popular celebrities started their careers on the same path that you are going down — through the hourly workforce? In fact, studies have shown that one in every eight American workers has been employed by McDonald’s. Believe it or not, your not so glamorous restaurant job can be your most defining, and set you on the path to bigger and better things.\n\nA new year is on the horizon – can you believe we are just 6 weeks away from 2016? In the next few weeks as we approach the new year, we are going to provide advice to help set you up on a successful career path. Today’s Blog will take a look at celebrity first hourly jobs, to help show that your first job can be the most crucial of your career path. So whether it’s a quick-service restaurant or retail store at the mall, every person has to start somewhere in their career. Here are a few big names you won’t believe started the same way you are!\n\nHarry Styles: Bakery Assistant\n\nBefore hitting it big with One Direction, Harry Styles worked at a bakery.\n\nGet started in your career like Harry Styles — we have Bakery jobs on our Job Board!\n\nCarly Rae Jepsen: Barista\n\nBefore her viral music hit, Call Me Maybe, Carly Rae Jepsen worked as a Barista to pay for rent while she pursued her musical career.\n\nCheck out our Barista jobs on on Job Board!\n\nRachel McAdams: Worked at McDonald’s\n\nBefore The Notebook and Dear John, Rachel McAdams worked at McDonald’s.

This new new app and marketplace for employers and hourly workers has job candidates fill out one application and apply to any restaurant in ZippyApp’s employer network. Job seekers learn about job openings at your restaurant from ZippyApp’s employer marketplace or on their Facebook and Twitter feeds. When they see ZippyApp’s window decal at your restaurant, they can simply scan the decal’s QR code with their smartphone to apply for a job.\n\nTo see the rest of the Kick Apps, go to: www.restaurant-hospitality.com.\n\nQR-Scanning App Helps Restaurant Owners Find Employees\n\n[Originally posted to pizzamarketplace.com]\n\nZippyApp announced its new online marketplace for employers and hourly workers that’s leveraging mobile technology and social media to help employers recruit and hire well-qualified employees. Kamyar Faron, a Millennial hiring expert and ZippyApp CEO, created the app to make it as easy as possible for restaurants to hire more efficiently and job seekers to land jobs more quickly using their smartphones, according to a company announcement.\n\nRather than filling out multiple employment applications all asking for identical information, ZippyApp enables job seekers to complete one common job application online and submit it via smartphone, tablet or computer to apply to any restaurant in ZippyApp’s employer network. Job seekers learn about job openings from ZippyApp’s employer marketplace, and Facebook and Twitter feeds, and wherever they see ZippyApp’s window decal at an employer’s restaurant, they can scan the decal’s QR code with their smartphone and instantly apply for a job.\n\nRestaurants using ZippyApp’s mobile tech tools can more easily recruit qualified, local job applicants, and more efficiently manage the interview and hiring process, the announcement stated, and Counter Burger, Panera Bread, Krispy Kreme, Jamba Juice and McDonald’s are among ZippyApp’s early adopters.\n\nKnock Em’ Dead: Phone Interview Etiquette\n\nCongratulations! Landing a phone interview means you most likely have the necessary skills and requirements for the job. Your mission during a phone interview is to explain more about your skills to earn an in-person meeting — and to ultimately land the job. Companies usually conduct phone interviews because they don’t have enough resources to manage in-person interviews with every qualified applicant. It is a screening technique that saves the company time, which is why companies refer to them as “phone screens.”\n\nYour mission during a phone interview is to earn an in-person meeting, and to ultimately land the job. Preparing is similar to that of an in-person interview, except you will want to keep these pointers in mind:\n\nSet up in a quiet area, one that is in a controlled environment with no background noise and outside influence. Keep your area pet free, as these noises can be distracting. It is best to use a landline during your call, but if you need to use your mobile be sure the battery is charged, you have good reception, and the volume is turned up.\n\nDress up just as you would to an in-person interview. Dressing up and sitting in an upright position will put you in the right mindset and keep you focused. Trust us, dressing in pajamas slouched in bed or on the couch will only knock you off your focus — and translate through to your voice!\n\nPrint out your ZippyApp application and have it in front of you during your call. The interviewer will most likely ask about the details you included on your application, like your past work experience and skills. You will want to have a copy so you don’t get caught off guard or stumble on a question. It is also good to have one just in case your Internet connection crashes.\n\nPrepare yourself by researching the company and the job description just like you would for an in-person interview. We discussed this in detail in last week’s Blog.\n\nCheck your body language. Even though the interviewer won’t be able to see you, your body language can be reflective in your enthusiasm and excitement during your call. Be sure to smile, as it will bring energy and excitement to your voice. Sit up in an upright position and stay in one place – don’t move around and pace from room-to-room.\n\nDon’t mention pay or benefits just yet. In fact, leave that conversation time and place up to the interviewer. Even though these are important factors, you don’t want to come across like these are the only things you are interested in.\n\nFollow up with a thank-you email to the interviewer after an hour or two. Following up so soon after is perfectly OK, since the phone interview process is shorter (you usually want to wait a day or two after an in-person meet up to follow up). If you don’t already have it, be sure to ask the interviewer for their email address before you hang up.\n\nBe Ready for out-of-the-blue calls, a tactic some hiring managers use to see how prepared you are. Be wary when answering unfamiliar numbers, and if you do answer the call and are asked for an interview, it is OK to tell them you need to call back, which will give you time to prepare and organize yourself.\n\nHave any phone interview etiquette tips to share? Our job seekers would love to hear from you!\n\nKnock Em’ Dead: Ace The Interview and Land the Job\n\nNow that you have mastered pre-interview etiquette and understand the importance of your punctuality, greeting, and attire, lets get you prepared to ace the interview! Here are some common interview questions and answers that will land you the job!\n\nCan you tell us about yourself? By asking this, your interviewer will want to determine how friendly and personable you are. Talk about things they would not be able to Google about you — throw in any sports or extracurricular activities you participate in, especially those that are relative to the job. For instance, saying you take cooking classes because you aspire to become a chef one day is a great thing to include when applying to a restaurant.\n\nWhat excites you about the job? Research and understand the job description under the company’s Hiring Portal on ZippyApp prior to your interview so you know the duties and requirements of the position. Getting an interview means you likely have the necessary experience and requirements needed to get the job — the interview is a better way for you to showcase your skills, rather than just having them on a piece of paper. Explain your experience with each of the duties the job requires. For instance, if you are applying to a Host position, explaining you have experience working in a fast-paced environment (like a mall) is a great way of showing you have the ability to take care of multiple customers at one time. See any skills you don’t have? Think about experiences you have had that are non-work related – like group projects or team sports.\n\nWhy do you think you are a good fit? Hiring managers usually are interested in seeing if would be a good fit for the team or not. Picture yourself in the company environment and ambiance, and explain how you are a good fit with that. Mentioning you play sports and enjoy a team environment is a great way to demonstrate you are a team player.\n\nWhy our company? Understanding what makes the company unique from others will score you points in the interview. Research their menu and/ or merchandise; then tell them you embrace their concept and explain how you would bring value to that. Demonstrating your knowledge about their products and offerings will convey your desire to work for them.\n\nCome prepared with questions to ask of your own. Remember, you are interviewing the hiring manager just as much as they are interviewing you. Going in to an interview prepared with questions of your own will show the hiring manager you are serious about the position. Some good questions to come prepared with are:\n\nWhat will a typical workday look like?\n\nWhat are some of the challenges someone in this position would face?\n\nWhat are the opportunities for growth for someone in this position?\n\nHave any interview questions to share? We would love to hear from you! Post your comments here.\n\nKnock Em’ Dead: Pre-Interview Etiquette\n\nThe job interview: You hope to get one, but you dread going to one. There probably isn’t a more uneasier situation than walking into a room full of strangers and keeping your composure while you’re every move and word gets scrutinized!\n\nBefore you head out the door to your next interview, remember the most powerful skill in business: Etiquette. Manners and respect are the foundation of good relationships, and good relationships translate to business success. Your etiquette is a reflection of your personal brand and reputation, and possessing proper etiquette can make all the difference in nailing the interview and getting the job or going back to the ZippyApp Job Board. Master the pre-interview with these etiquette tips.\n\nIf you decide the job isn’t for you or you have taken a position elsewhere, be sure let your interviewer know as soon as possible that you will not be attending the interview. Email is good, but a phone call is better. It may seem like common sense to do, but you’d be surprised to find out the number of people who forgo this vital step. Not doing this can tarnish your reputation and burn a bridge before you even got the chance to build one. Keep in mind in any industry you get into, people know people — and they talk. You don’t want to be known in the industry as someone who is unprofessional, irresponsible, and unreliable.\n\nYour punctuality says a lot about you as a person, and even more as an employee. Punctuality demonstrates that you are professional, dependable, and respectful of other people’s time. It gives the interviewer a sense of your time keeping skills, which is a further indication of your organization skills and your ability to meet deadlines. It can also tell them whether or not you are more likely to show up for work on time. A good rule of thumb is to arrive five to 10 minutes before your interview, but never before 10 minutes (remember to be respectful). Give yourself plenty of time to travel, with extra time for unforeseeable circumstances. If you do end up running behind, call right away and explain the situation with the new time you will arrive.\n\nYour interview begins as soon as you walk into the building, even if the hiring manager is not your first point of contact. Before going in, be sure to turn your cellphone off (keeping it on vibrate can still be distracting if it goes off) and leave any unnecessary belongings behind. Smile and greet the first person you see with a strong handshake, stating your name and who you are there to interview with. An example greeting to practice: “Hi, my name is Bruce Bowers. Nice to meet you! I’m here to speak with Kamyar Faron about your open Host position.” If the person who escorts you to your interview is different than the first person you spoke with, stand up, shake hands, and introduce yourself in the same manner before they escort you into your interview.\n\nThe way you dress is a factor in how people perceive you, and can be a deciding factor in whether or not you land the job. In fact, 65% of hiring managers say they will select the candidate who dressed appropriately for the interview over someone who did not if all other factors were the same. So what is appropriate dress attire? It can really depend on the company and the position you are applying to. Your interviewer is going to look at you and assess whether or not you would be a good fit, so you will need to make sure you look like a good fit. An easy way to do this is to check out the companies social media profiles to see how their employees dress — Facebook and Instagram are great channels to do this. If all else fails, dress up and conservatively to give a positive impression.\n\n* ZippyApp Tip: You can get a leg up in this area if you upload a photo or video to your ZippyApp application, since the hiring manager(s) will already have a good perception of you in their minds.\n\nIn our next Blog we will discuss the questions most likely to be asked in your interview, and impressive ways to answer them. Stay tuned!\n\n* Statistics taken from collegeatlas.org\n\nMake Your Application Stand out from the Crowd with ZippyApp’s Unique Video Tool\n\nPersonal videos offer a great way to display your personality and allow potential employers to see the person behind the application. Although videos are not likely to take the place of applications and resumes, they could be the cherry-on-top to a good application. ZippyApp’s unique video tool allows you to upload and post your personal video with your work application, offering an even richer applicant profile. Stand out from the crowd with these video-building tips!\n\nTell your story: Your video should tell your story — employers want to get to know you. Your story is your brand, and getting others to understand your brand helps them identify with your story.\n\nRelate your previous experience: The information in your video should be relevant to the type of jobs you are applying to, but there is no need to do a separate video for each job. Discuss your previous positions and the skills you took away from each. You can say things like “I greeted and seated 75 customers in one hour in my previous Host position. It was a fast-paced and challenging experience.”\n\nSell yourself: Video is a great way to display your personality. Try not to repeat what is written on your application – instead showcase your talent and skills in ways you can’t on paper. Can you juggle? Sing? Adding these in to your video are great ways to set yourself apart from other applicants.\n\nKeep it short and sweet: You don’t want the viewer, your potential employer, to get bored and switch it off. A good time frame is between 1-2 minutes. Before beginning, write down what you want to discuss in bullet point format, which can help you communicate efficiently and to the point.\n\nDelivery: Your personal video is not that much different than an in-person interview, so be sure to talk clearly and address the camera (the interviewer) directly. Make sure to record your video in an area where there isn’t any background noise or distracting sounds.\n\nDress to impress: Present yourself in a way prospective employers might envision you in their workplace. Be sure to wear appropriate clothing and style.\n\nTools: Nowadays you don’t have to have a camera, microphone, and expensive video equipment to create your video – you can simply use your smartphone. Some video apps we like are Mobli and video editor Magisto.\n\nHave any personal video tips to share? We would love to hear from you!"
