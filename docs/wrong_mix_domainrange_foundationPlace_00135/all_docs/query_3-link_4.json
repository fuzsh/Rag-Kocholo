        "text": "KickApps, a New York-based provider of software for building social networks, has raised $14 million in venture-capital funding, the latest sign that VCs believe that its business model can keep kicking and ultimately, see a tidy profit, despite the current recession.\n\nThe financing brings the total Venture-capital funding raised by the two-year-old startup to $32 million, allowing it to add to its sales and marketing staff and to upgrade its platform at a time when most media companies – including social-network sites – are cutting back.\n\n“So far, we seem to be recession proof,” said Alex Blum, CEO of the 70-employee firm, who noted that adoption rates for KickApps social-media services are accelerating because they help brands profit and gain advertising value from social media in a way that other services – such as FaceBook – have failed to do.\n\nWhile a host of social-networking sites have raised money during the past year in the hopes of building a community from scratch for everything from business travelers to teens and game enthusiasts, KickApps takes a different tack: it provides software to companies to help create online-social networks and related services – including blogs, online video, message boards and widgets.\n\nThis has allowed the firm to win several big-name customers such as Rachel Ray, Gossip Girl, the New York Knicks, the New York Rangers and Warner Brothers, build upward of 50,000 social networks and attract 10 million viewers a month, according to statistics released by the company.\n\nThe firm also provides its corporate customers with an analytics tool – called a Social Graph Engine – that allows them to create detailed profiles of their social-network visitors, noting their likes and dislikes and then serve up targeted ads or even adjust or upgrade products to better suit their customer base.\n\nThe funding for KickApps comes at a time when social networks are growing. In August, Comscore, a digital-research firm, reported that on a global basis, traffic on social networking sites grew 25 percent over the past year, attracting over 580 million unique visitors.\n\nRecent funding for KickApps was led by North Atlantic Capital, a venture-capital firm based in Portland, Maine. Repeat investors included Softbank, Spark Capital and Prism Ventures."
