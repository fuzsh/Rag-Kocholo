        "text": "James Michael \"Mike\" Harris\n\nJun 24, 1955 -\n\nJan 16, 2023\n\nMike Harris, 67, passed away at his Wasilla, Alaska, home on Jan. 16, 2023, where he had raised his children and resided for many years.\n\nMike was born in Valdosta, Ga. In his early teenage years, he moved to Alaska with his parents along with his brother. He was raised in the Anchorage area and graduated from Service High School early, at age 17, when he joined the Navy. He spent two years in active duty living and working on a naval supply ship seeing much of eastern Asia. Upon discharge he promptly bought a Harley-Davidson and spent much of the next year touring the United States by motorcycle.\n\nIn high school, with his father's encouragement, he earned his pilot's license though the AERO club at Fort Rich prior to graduation. He spent many hours exploring the skies of Alaska in his father's 170 as a very young man. This was the beginning of his love affair with the aviation industry. Mike attended Airframe and Powerplant school at Merrell Field following his military duty. He held multiple jobs as an AMT, lead AMT and maintenance manager before joining ERA aviation in 1988, which he would make his home as for nearly 20 years. Afterward, he worked several years as DM for Hageland Aviation, then Grant Aviation prior to his retirement.\n\nMike loved anything with a motor. He loved cars, technology, equipment, machines and innovation. He would spend hours watching the auto auctions on TV wishing he was there. Every family trip to Homer, Alaska, he could be found walking the dock inspecting every boat.\n\nMike loved Alaska and the outdoors. He had roamed more of this state than many of us have ever dreamed to. He had explored the Lake Louise area with his father since the late '60s and it was always his favorite place. Mike was fortunate enough, in 2011, to purchase his own cabin at Lake Louise and spent many weeks each year there \"recharging his batteries.\" As an avid hunter and fisherman, he constantly had dreams of exploring around the next corner.\n\nMike loved his daughters. The two girls were his pride and joy. He beamed whenever he got the chance to introduce them. He was so proud of himself for the women they had become.\n\nMike loved being a grandpa. He loved introducing his granddaughter to the things he loved as a child that may have skipped a generation. His love of hobbies sparked a new passion when he had the fascination of a child to enjoy it along with him.\n\nMike was preceded in death by father, Samuel Dowse Harris Jr.; mother, Montyne Yvonne Harris (Wilkes); and brother, Timothy Harris.\n\nMike was survived by his daughter, Christine Johnson (Dan); daughter, Lindsey Nelson (Tyler); granddaughter, Charlotte Nelson; and niece, Kayla Sams.\n\nA celebration of life will be held at Hageland Aviation hangar, 801 Cope-Industrial Way, Palmer, AK 99645, on Saturday, Feb. 18, 2023, at 1 p.m."
