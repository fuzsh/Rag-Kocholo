        "text": "It's been hinted we're getting garrulous again. No more wordy flubdub for usâ€”we address ourself to the FACTS. (April Fool.)\n\nSo tersely, a boarding-house stew compounded of names and dates, fresh brats dewy from the delivery room and coldstorage ones recently remembered by their daddies, grilled jobs left over from Sunday dinner and gobbets regurgitated from last week's wedding breakfasts, promotions and address changes, names and dates, names and dates. We cast a weatherwise if slightly jaded eye over the perilous, rainswept mid-campus seas and know that in five minutes the Library tower will gleam white in the bright spring sun and by supper-time it will be snowing.\n\nAnd so to the arrival in Los Angeles of G-Man Hood as head of the L. A. office of the F. B. 1., one of the youngest office heads in the bureau after less than five years of sleuthing and target practice in Washington, Knoxville, and New Orleans. We'll expect him to bring a couple of captive spies, a counterfeiter or kidnapper or two as Reunion mascots Otorhino- laryngology is not a monster of the Mesozoic but what this slip of paper says Dr. Merrill Hayes is resident in at the Temple University Hospital If one of those dainty duns dashed off by Carl Haffen- reffer in the midst of an open christie at Sun Valley doesn't bring in your class dues you are too tough for anybody, except possibly for G-Man Hood or the laddies of Bud French's Rodeo who will start their spring steer-roping, bronchobusting horse opera any day now. Step right up and buy your ticket\n\n\"We wish to announce our resignations from the firm of C. L. Hargert & Company, Ridgewood, N. J., and are now operating insurance offices at the above locations,\" announce Highhouse and Herz (Edgar L., '3O). The \"above locations\" are in Midland Park and Paterson, New Jersey. \"... have been married six years, have two children Susan age 4 and Peter age 1. Will see you at Reunion,\" appends Ed. (O. K., but please make up your mind whether Susan was born May 20 or May 22.) Speaking of Reunion reminds us. Does it remind you? Ed is No. 10. Let's have your names, please\n\nFred Johnson, one of the veterans (celebrated nth wedding anniversary on February 11 and boasts Lydia, 9, and Avery, 6) is a physician in Topeka. He finished his A.B. and got his M.D. at Columbia (1932). (Cupe Burns: Next time you pass through Topeka, call up Fred and remind him he's a Thirtyman.).... Our love to E. Bradley Carnell (she is ii/ 2 and her name is Ethel); we would have done it sooner if anybody had told us. Her daddy \"only had time for a telephone call\" February 31 while hurrying through Hanover because Jean had sprained her shoulder on Tuckerman's and had to be hurried home. (Only a dozen or so people had told us in apprehensive whispers during the preceding 24 hours \"Cornell's in town\" and our scouts found both Carnells skiing in Woodstock that afternoon.).... Speaking of the doghouse, Hammie South of the flying Marines is the latest tenant. It is bruited about among the McNutt Hall cockroaches that Mammie has lately been interviewing the local airminded.\n\nIt's going to be pretty thin for the hatcheck girl in the Rockefeller Center Pig's Knuckles and Tiddledy Winks Club for executive committee pickled pig's feet and chocolate Eclair frolics in the future if the present movement keeps up. The former personnel director of Terminal Cab and public relations man for General Motors now hangs his iron hat in the office of Victor G. Bore J la, director of industrial relations of Rockefeller Center, Inc. whose multifarious activities in the rental and operation of buildings, restaurants, theatres, night clubs, etc. etc. defy enumeration. The committee could practically gather a quorum without stepping outdoors Meanwhile, our spotters of Bottomiana are sending us clippings from the HeraldTribune, a Tory sheet we never see ourself, of a picture captioned: \"Commiting (sic) a Kingdom to New York Lease.\" (The spelling is Casler's.) Naturally it is Bottome who has the kingdom in hand. \"W. P. Montyn, Consul General of the Netherlands, signing a lease with Rockefeller Center, Inc. for a large space in Holland House for the use of the Holland government. . . Robert Bottome, representing Rockefeller Center Inc., is seated at 1eft.\".... While batting around the neighborhood, here is an item from the White River Junction Landmark of March 2: \"Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller. . . will deliver the address at the 69th commencement of the University of New Hampshire, June 12 \" And to quote our preceptor in the dispensation of fact and fancy, Mr. Walter Winchell, we find in his column of March 13: \"Nelson Rockefeller has spurned Harry Hopkins' invitation to become Assistant Secretary of Commerce.\"\n\nAlso, while batting in the Bo's (just think of the times that Borella, Bottome and Bowes must have cribbed from each other in class) here is Fred Bowes as Manager of Advertising and Publicity of the Pitney-Bowes Postage Meter Company, having left Batten, Barton, etc. etc. on January 1 to combine the love of metered mail and advertising Fred points to February 6 Advertising Age item: \"Frank Gulden Jr. pres., Charles Gulden, the mustard firm, represents the fourth genera- tion of the founding family to head the business. He presided at a 75th anniver- sary party a fortnight ago.\" Thus, the metered mailman observes, one member of the '3O freshman hockey team becomes America's youthful Mustard King while another is America's top college hockey mentor (get it? Jeremiah). For verification of the latter item, see the sports section of this issue.\n\nCarroll Mavis moves to Kansas City as branch manager for American Automobile Insurance Company To Dr. Adie Raab of Brooklyn: please make up your mind whether Judith Paula was born December 7, 1937, or January 7, 1938, or some other time. These are the only two dates you've given us so far Did you see Bill Rich's piece on Dr. Gallup and the Institute of Public Opinion in the Saturday Evening Post in January?.... And while playing around among the Rich, Barrister Jack of Burns and Brandon, Boston, came to Hanover in February to lecture to Political Science 52 and told us about Nancy Winslow, born April 10, 1938\n\n'3o's THIRD SET OF TWINS\n\nThough saving the babies until the last, we can't wait longer to tell you about Fred Tobey's twins, Donald Ross and David Powell, born February 16. Fouryear-old Fred 3rd will have his hands full. Daddy has left Curtis Publishing to become manager of Parkville Coal Company, Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nBrooke Willis, following in his father's footsteps at Columbia, is a lecturer there and is also New York correspondent of Agence Economique at Financiers of Paris. For versatility, Brooke, who majored in Physics, has been economist for Jewell Tea, teaching fellow in Economics at George Washington University, student of Columbia's School of Engineering Budd Schulberg '36, in Hanover to work on Walter Wanger's Carnival movie, spoke appreciatively of the \"story sense\" of Collie Young, head of the story department of Myron Selznick Inc., Hollywood.\n\nPete Callaway reports a visit in Chicago by that famed lawn mower tycoon and phrase maker, Mort Collins, who is now with the Blair Manufacturing Company of Springfield, Mass., after a period as meat cutter (\"cleaver heaver\" to Bob Whittlesey) of the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and a phase, as we recall, in which he dispensed Educator crackers.\n\nThat old Alaskan prospector has now staked out his homestead at Maiden, Massachusetts, and settled down with a bride, according to the following:\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Joseph E. Hopkins announce the marriage of their daughter, Rebecca Mayburry to Mr. John K. Alexander on Saturday, December 31, 1938, Oseola Mills, Pennsylvania.\" Jack is assistant manager of the advertising department of the Wirthmore Grain and Feed Company, alias Charles M. Cox Company. And by the time this reaches you Ed Schuster will be a bridegroom according to the following information:\n\n\"Mr. and Mrs. Charles Eden request the honour of your presence at the marriage of their daughter, Mildred, to Mr. Edward Schuster on Saturday, the twenty-fifth of March at four o'clock, Saint Paul's Evangelical Lutheran Church, South Fifth and Rodney Streets, Brooklyn, New York.\" We wish Ed would tell us what he is to H. C. Bohack, Inc. Now for the babes:\n\nJohn Oliver Crawford Jr., to the Jack Crawfords, November a, 1938 James Mitchell Fowler to the Frank Fowlers, November 3, 1938 Frederick Zarr Jaspersen to the Fred Jaspersens, September 23, 1938. (Martha is four.). .. .Jean Mary Randlett to the Pres Randletts, October 13, 1938 Michael Wood to the BlahWoods, October 25, 1938. (Does new residence address mean a new house for the Waterloo attorney?).... And really coming up to the present, Priscilla Alden Smith to the Alden Waters Smiths, February 28, 1939 And Jim Tyler, reading backwards, not only boasts Susan (August 3, 1938) and James H. Tyler Jr. (December 28, 1935) but also he brags at this late hour of his marriage in St. Paul to Florence Wieburner on July 31, 1932. Jim's B. A. came from the University of Minnesota.\n\nFund Contributors for 1938\n\nContributors: 349 (78% of graduates). Total gifts: I2.856.45 (120% of objective). G.
