        "text": "Memorial\n\nPolly Alnutt, 88, passed away Friday after a brief illness. In her honor, and when it's safe, surround yourself with family and friends, put on some soft jazz, bless and enjoy a big Mexican meal, then bring out the dominoes or deal the cards (euchre and poker were favorites) and let the laughs roll, as long as you don't mind losing. Polly liked nothing more than the simplicity of home and friends. She had legions of friends, from the members of the Oldtimer's Club at Quaker Oats, her church, adored neighbors, those she and Chuck made while fishing in Minnesota, and best friend Donna Akers.\n\nShe was preceded in death by beloved husband Chuck; children, Dennis, Richard, Julia and Keith; plus granddaughter, Montyne. The hole in her heart from those losses was filled with -- her exact words -- \"Love, family, neighbors, pets, quilts, and God's Words of encouragement.\"\n\nPolly was a strong woman, fun and unfiltered. Born on the banks of the Rio Grande, she raised seven children while actively serving the community as a board member and fund-raiser for Jane Boyd, Bender Pool, and Bethel AME. It was a full and happy life.\n\nShe's survived by daughters, Janice Byers, Janett Scott and Joyce Langston; and 27 grandchildren over 3 more generations. Each one of them received Polly's special brand of love; a mix of care and concern with a touch of sass thrown in, along with home cooked food and always a quilt.\n\nThere will be a memorial service at 1:30 p.m. Saturday, June 12, at the chapel at Cedar Memorial. All are welcome.\n\n10.1.1"
