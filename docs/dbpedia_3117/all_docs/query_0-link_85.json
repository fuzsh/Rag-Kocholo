        "text": "Course description: Archaeological research is moving at an increasingly rapid pace, with advances in archaeological methods and theory propelling new interpretations and understandings of archaeological findings. This course we will focus on contemporary developments in archaeology, with an emphasis on current trends in theory, method, and discovery. The objectives of the course are to place emerging trends in archaeological research in a historical context, to understand new methods, and to explore how various theoretical approaches influence the conduct of archaeological research around the globe. The course will be constructed around a series of topics decided on by the class in the first session. The instructor will assign readings for the first week to serve as a jumping off point for class discussion and will provide a list of possible topics for consideration. Class investment in topics of concern is an important consideration. Students are expected to identify and share readings for weekly topics, and to lead discussions as well as participate in the conversation about a given topic or reading. Because the course is about novel research we will spend our time exploring the most current literature and considering how recent findings affect interpretations of local, regional, and global archaeological evidence. Course structure: Because this is a seminar-style class, classroom participation is a requirement. Students will be asked to lead discussion of a topic or paper in class. (The size of the class will determine the frequency of presentation.) Student must identify suitable readings and share the readings with the class a week in advance of the presentation. In advance of these presentations students are expected to prepare short (one page) summaries of their selected readings for circulation. In addition, presenters should identify two to four questions derived from or about the readings; these questions and inquiries will serve as a foundation for discussion about the topic at hand. A final class paper on a topic chosen by the student in consultation with the professor is required. The results/findings of this paper will be presented in class at the end of the semester as a 15 minute (maximum) summary prepared as if it is a presentation to an academic audience. One or more students will be assigned as a discussant of the paper and will present a commentary and critique of the paper and topic.\n\nAncient Cultures at Monash University (ACMU) 2013 is the inaugural conference hosted by the Centre for Archaeology and Ancient History at Monash University. In 2014, Monash will introduce a new Bachelor of Arts major in Ancient Cultures and the conference will help celebrate this event. The purpose of the conference is to showcase the work of current and recently-completed postgraduate students of Monash University, whose research focuses upon any aspect of ‘ancient cultures’, and to open a dialogue between students of different departments. In light of this, the 2013 conference will feature students from the Centre for Archaeology and Ancient History, as well as students from the Centre for Studies in Religion and Theology and the Department of Philosophy, all located within the School of Philosophical, Historical and International Studies, students from the Departments of Italian and Chinese Studies, located within the School of Languages, Cultures and Linguistics, and a past student of Monash who is now studying at the University of Sydney. The diversity of the papers presented here illustrates the important role that the study of ancient cultures plays within the Monash University research environment and emphasises the need for ongoing collaboration across departments into the future. We are also pleased to welcome two guest speakers for ACMU 2013: Dr Yann Tristant is a lecturer in the Department of Ancient History at Macquarie University in Sydney, and is the Director for the Macquarie University/ Institut français d’archéologie orientale (IFAO) excavations at both Abu Rawash and Wâdî 'Araba, Egypt. He is also the Deputy Director for the University of Vienna/ Macquarie University excavations at Helwan, Egypt. Dr Tristant has kindly agreed to present the keynote address, and we thank him for his contribution. Dr Nicola Aravecchia is a Research Affiliate at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University, and is the Archaeological Field Director for the New York University excavations at Ain el-Gedida in Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt. Dr Aravecchia will present the closing address and we would also like to thank him for his contribution. The ACMU 2013 Conference Committee"
