Description

Sometimes a suit of heer vileness turns out to have an unexpectedly moral lining, something which, I suspect, applies to this rather unusual book. It's always interesting to see how far people can take themselves and how they manage to bring themselves back. In Jan Montyn's case it was quite a journey.

It's always interesting to see how far people can take themselves and how they manage to bring themselves back. In Jan Montyn's case it was quite a journey.

He has had quite astonishing adventures in many lands... The description of the British bombing of Dresden, the bombs continuing to fall long after the city and its people have been obliterated, is harrowing.

Jan Montyn (13 November 1924 - 10 August 2015) was a Dutch artist, specialized in etching. He was best known for his paintings of wars to which he had been an eyewitness. Montyn was born in a conservative Calvinistic family and was raised in Oudewater. In the Second World War he joined the German navy and fought on the eastern front. After the war he lived in France and in the Netherlands. His work is displayed in the Biblioth√®que Nationale in Paris, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Montyn died on 10 August 2015 in Amsterdam, aged 90.
