Jan Montyn

Jan Montyn (1924 â€“ 2015) was a well known Dutch painter, draftsman and poet with a rather unusual life. It is said of him that his eyes saw more than is humanly bearable. On his many (military) adventures he saw hellish as well as heavenly places, leading to an oeuvre of wonderful etchings (which form the vast majority of his oeuvre), paintings and poetry.
