        "text": "Quote from Zetsu69 »\n\nFirst off your topic on basic statistics does not explain why \"good players have better control of RNG\" nor how \"randomness can be manipulated\" unless the unreasonable situation of a rogue drawing 2 cards per turn without having auctioneer was rng manipulation. But anyone could tell you that drawing more cards is better.\n\nSecondly, your math is just so wrong. The probability of you drawing an auctioneer by turn 5 is 1 - (.64 * 25/27 * 24/26 * 23/25 * 22/24 * 21/23) = 0.5788. Drawing two cards per turn gets you to .7520 . No where near your 99% chance to draw an auctioneer. Anyone could look at this and realize how ridiculous your assertion is. You don't even need math. At turn 5, even drawing two cards per turn and counting mulligan, half of your deck is still undrawn. To claim that you are guaranteed an auctioneer is actually unbelievable. I legitimately cannot believe someone would make that claim.\n\nAnd even then, none of this matters because you can't manipulate randomness as you claim other than \"draw more cards get more auctioneer.\"\n\nQuote from honj90 »\n\nThe initiative is admirable, but the post includes a bunch of inaccuracies.\n\nFor starters, you can't \"draw cards at the same time\". The chance of not getting Auctioneer in a 3-card starting hand is (28/30)*(27/29)*(26/28)~=0.8069. You can also confirm that by using combinations. You just take C(28, 3), which is all possible 3-card combinations from your deck without Auctioneers and divide it by C(30, 3), which is all possible 3-card combinations in your deck.\n\nSecondly, you can't mulligan into the same card you just shipped back, meaning that after the first mulligan your chances of getting Auctioneer increase, due to you \"drawing\" from a 27 card deck (source). Ironically that means, that while in general you are correct, in the current implementation mulliganing 3 cards gives you the same chance of drawing Auctioneer as drawing a 6-card hand.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to calculate the odds for a 4-card hand when going second. Oh, and this is a bit pedantic, but please, it's rogue, not rouge.\n\nHmmm, I'm not sure the math is right. I suck at math and I could be wrong, but here I go!\n\n(***ignoring the Mulligan***) The probability of drawing any card is based on its position in the deck. e.g. there is a 1/30 chance that card x is the very last thing in the deck. Given this, the probability of drawing that card by turn 5 (assuming 1 draw per turn) is precisely 0%\n\nAs a Philosophy student I remember having to study a few problems where updated information does not allow us to increase our probabilities ( e.g. If someone says \"one of twin in the womb is a boy what it probability that the other is a boy?\" its a mistake to say 1/2. The original set was [[ [GG], [BG], [GB], [BB] }}. The new information only allows to remove one possibility from the set [GG], and thus the probability that the other twin is a boy is actually 1/3.\n\nI mention this because I think the same sort of error might be going on here. Getting new information does not change the base probabilities.\n\nSo there is a 36% chance of getting Card X in the Mulligan. After that the remaining 26 (we start with 4 cards, right?) cards are shuffled, and Card X1 and X2 are given a random location in the library.\n\nSo, what is the probability that Card X1 and X2 are both in the last 10 cards of the deck? 10/26 * 9/26 = 13%\n\nNow if we take this number and multiply by the Mulligan chance we get (.36*.13 = .046% ) In other words, there is 4% chance that we fail to Mulligan auctioneer AND that those two copies are the last 10 cards of the deck. Since 4 % is larger than 1% it strikes me that there maybe some error with the 99% and 76% figures respectively.\n\nLong story short; If Card Y is at [P 25] (P = Position) in the deck then drawing the card at P10 does not increase the probability that the card at P11 will be Card Y. Just like the twins case above, drawing new cards does not change the base rate.\n\nEDIT: I wrote this before you edited your post Billie. Nonetheless the point remains :)\n\nQuote from honj90 »\n\nAssuming the HS RNG is truly random, it doesn't matter in what way or order you pick your first 3 cards. If you have a 30-card deck in RL, it doesn't matter if you pick the cards individually, pick them all from the top or the bottom bottom or spread apart in-between, if you shuffle between picks or make them all at once or if you throw your deck on the floor and pick 3 random cards from the pile. As long as you keep each card you pick apart and don't put it back in the deck the odds of drawing or not drawing specific cards are the same.\n\nThe first card has always a 28/30 chance of NOT being an Auctioneer, the second one a 27/29 chance of not being an Auctioneer (assuming the first one wasn't an Auctioneer either), the third one 26/28 (assuming neither of the previous ones was an Auctioneer) and so on.\n\nAccording to the HS developpers, when mulliganing (exchanging cards you didn't like) you should never get a card you just exchanged. You can get the second copy of that card if you have one in your deck, but never the exact same card. That means we can imagine it the following way: You put the 3 cards you didn't like in a corner, you shuffle your deck (or not, it does not matter), you pick the next 3 cards which are your new hand and then you take the 3 cards you set aside, you shuffle them together with the rest of your deck and start the game. That means that if you mulliganed 3 cards that were not Auctioneer, your new hand should have a (25/27)*(24/26)*(23/25) chance of not containing Auctioneer again.\n\nThe way you tried to calculate it in the end of your previous post, by looking at the top 3 cards of your deck does not work because you forgot to include all the cases where you have two Auctioneers in the top 3.\n\nPS. For anyone interested in the 3-prisoners problem, there was a very nice and simple explanation on Vsauce some time ago: http://youtu.be/_Oc9tKkH7WE?t=2m30s\n\nQuote from xskarma »\n\nI'm way out of my depth with this math, just wanted to day the first post goes off the presumption that if you mulligan a card you can't get a copy of it again. What that means is you won't get that exact card again, you might still get the other card of the pair. Saw a video recently where a Rogue mulliganed his hand only to get the exact hand back again, that I would have included as proof if had been able to find it again. =/\n\nSo take that into account when making calculations that if you have 2 cards of something in your deck you can get the second one even if you mulligan the first one.\n\nQuote from xskarma »\n\nI'm way out of my depth with this math, just wanted to day the first post goes off the presumption that if you mulligan a card you can't get a copy of it again.
