        "text": "My wife wanted a greenhouse ( the newest trend ) and getting power from the house isn’t an option. I decided to put some water features in while We were putting solar in. The requirements as far as I can tell will be 5.83 amps at night and 14.92 amps daytime. 1984 wh night and1308 wh daytime. If I’m correct there will be 489 watts total ( I added everything I would be ordering so the watts should be correct. I have read until I was seeing things sideways and watched every video I could find. Now I am thoroughly confused. I found some used sunpower panels ( 327w ) used that are a great price, but I want to have the whole system figured out first. Want to make sure she can grow enough veggies to pay for it ha ha. Any help will be appreciated.\n\nI don't understand how you can say:\n\n5.83A at night, 1984Wh night.\n\n14.92A daytime, 1308Wh daytime.\n\nAmps requires a voltage for power, so there's something missing.\n\nYou're using more current during the daytime, so unless you're using it for a small fraction of the time as the night loads, it doesn't make sense to have less Wh in daytime.\n\nMake it simple. In a 24 hour period, you want to run:\n\nItem #1, ? Watts for ? hours.\n\nItem #2, ? Watts for ? hours.\n\nMultiply them to get Wh and add up the total Wh for a 24 hr period.\n\nLet's say that 489W load is continuous for 24 hours.\n\nThat's 24 * 489W /.85 (efficiency) = 13.8kWh\n\nYou'd need 13.8kWh of battery (about 1,150Ah @ 12V) and about 3000-4000W of PV.\n\nOnce you have your list of items, their power, and their daily run time, you can calculate your daily Wh/kWh and figure out what you need.\n\nConsult link #1 in my signature.\n\nI think you've got Watts and Amps confused in there somewhere. It also sounds like you're working with AC amps as well, so some napkin math paints a different picture:\n\n500w ( rounded up) * 24 hours = 12Kwh * 85% efficiency losses = 13,800 Wh per day\n\n13,800 Wh per day / 4 hours of sun = 3500w of solar panels * 80% efficiency = 4140 watts of panel.\n\nThat assumes you get clear skies every day which is a big ask, so figure a couple days of battery.\n\nIf this is going to be inside a greenhouse the humidity and heat mean you'll want outdoor rated batteries, a pair of 15kwh wall batteries is the simplest bet.\n\nYou'll want to break down your power needs and see where you can cut watts, that's a lot of juice for a greenhouse. If you're on a budget you'll want to look at DIY'ing your own batteries to save some cash, and a 3Kw AIO will give you the most cost effective way to get your inverter and charge controller. With the size of the batteries required, you may have to parallel charge controllers to get enough panels involved to cover winter.\n\nWhat kind of budget are you shooting for? How do you feel about building your own batteries? Are you using LED or fluorescent bulbs? How much power are you feeding your fans? Remember, overheating is just as bad as freezing for the plants, you want it to be warm but not hot in there.\n\nLet me try this again and thanks ahead of time. Everything is figured at 12 volt but will end up at 24volt.\n\nInside lights 2 hours -.25 amp - 3 watt - 6 wh\n\nBig pond pump 14 hours - 10 amp - 75 watt - 1050 wh\n\nSmall fountain pump 14 hours - 6 amps - 64 watts - 896 wh\n\nFans 7 hours - 13.2 amps - 160 watt - 92.4 wh\n\nPond lights 5 hours - 42 amps - 70 watt - 350 wh\n\n71.45 total amps\n\n372 total watts\n\n2394.4 total watt hours\n\nI am looking at sunpower 327 watt used panels. Voc on the panel is 64.9 volt. They are metering at 58 - 62 open current. I am in East Tennessee in the smoky mtns.\n\nThere will need to be batteries for 1899 wh. I planned on doing a 24v system. I’m lost from here if I got this right. Anything you to guide the blind will be appreciated.\n\nNow THAT seems a lot more reasonable! 24v @ 100Ah is 2400Wh so much more manageable. You can get a couple batteries in parallel real easy for that, or just a big honkin 24v battery and a pair of panels will do you good.\n\nThe MPP 3024LV-MSD, or the Growatt 3000TL-LVM are both good 24v AIO's and can take a couple of those panels. My bandwidth out here isn't letting me load the specs page on the MPP but I know the Growatt tops out at about 145v so you'll want to keep the panels in a 2s configuration, be it 2s, 2s2p, 2s3p, whatever to not hit that voltage limit.\n\nWire the AIO to a small breaker box and run all your romex from there to the lights and fans and fountains and such. Easy peasy.\n\nSeeing lots of arithmetic concerns....\n\nLet me try this again and thanks ahead of time. Everything is figured at 12 volt but will end up at 24volt.\n\nAre you converting, or are these ALL listed for 12V, i.e., you are reading from a label, this uses XA at 12V?\n\nInside lights 2 hours -.25 amp - 3 watt - 6 wh\n\nReasonable assuming ONE tiny LED.\n\nBig pond pump 14 hours - 10 amp - 75 watt - 1050 wh\n\nMaybe about like an RV water pump?\n\n10A * 12V = 120W, so there's a disconnect there.\n\n14 * 120 = 1680Wh\n\nSmall fountain pump 14 hours - 6 amps - 64 watts - 896 wh\n\n6A * 12V = 72W, not 64\n\n72 * 14 = 1008Wh\n\nFans 7 hours - 13.2 amps - 160 watt - 92.4 wh\n\n160 * 7 = 1,120Wh\n\nPond lights 5 hours - 42 amps - 70 watt - 350 wh\n\n42A??\n\n71.45 total amps\n\nSo, you may need 71.45A continuously.\n\n372 total watts\n\n71.45 * 12 = 857W\n\n2394.4 total watt hours\n\nI am looking at sunpower 327 watt used panels. Voc on the panel is 64.9 volt. They are metering at 58 - 62 open current. I am in East Tennessee in the smoky mtns.\n\nThere will need to be batteries for 1899 wh. I planned on doing a 24v system. I’m lost from here if I got this right. Anything you to guide the blind will be appreciated.\n\nI think you need to revisit your numbers.\n\nDo you need any AC power?\n\nAt least you're converting everything to Watt Hours, that helps get everything on an even playing field. It looks like some of your numbers are 12v items and some are 120v items, but it's a little unclear. Either way, if your watt hours are correct then the only issue is getting the right flavor of power to the stuff. Trying to power 12v stuff off a 24v battery for example requires a converter, but if everything you've got listed is 120v then you're set just getting an inverter and breaking out from there.\n\nBe sure to keep your amps (current draw) and amp-hours (capacity required) labeled clearly. Mixing up an amp draw for amp hours and then multiplying by hours will FUBAR your math real quick.\n\nThe pumps are bilge pumps and are small\n\nInside lights are strings of 180 and 200 Lumens\n\nFans are car radiator fans 13.2a and 160w\n\nPond lights .83a 10w I went to a different brand with a similar light for different specs\n\nThese specs rechecked were from Amazon webpage\n\nDefinitely not an electrician as you have guessed.\n\nThis is basically for a fun project. I could just buy a crappy solar fan kit and stick it on the greenhouse but there is no fun in that.\n\nAny suggestions on what to do for instead of used. I picked a great name in solar thinking I could trust them.\n\nIf it is just a fun and learning project than whatever panels you can get for the best price (used or new) ought to do. But used panels may not produce or even work. Some folks go the route of picking up panel testers when they can check before buying. There has been more than few folks that have gone the used route and end up on the Forum here asking why their system is not producing like it should.\n\nTrying to get more educated. Watt hours are calculated by taking the number of watts by the number of hours used correct?\n\nYes, and watts is calculated by Volts * Amps, so it's important to ensure you're quoting the correct amps. It's a common error for someone to see an amp value and just pass it through regardless of voltage. A device that uses 2A @ 120VAC will gobble 20A @ 12V.\n\nI think I have everything straightened out number wise now.\n\nWe'd love to see those numbers.\n\nI at the final steps of the system but I need to figure out how to size the charge controller, and a good brand for a converter from 24v to 12v. Everything is figured to run on 12v. Everything I’m looking up to figure the charge controller seems like it’s incomplete or I’m missing something (probably).\n\nLine #1 in my signature.\n\nUse PVWatts to determine your PV potential for your exact location, you want the insolation hours by month.\n\nYou've basically done the energy audit with the Wh calculation.\n\nTake your daily Wh requirement and divide it by the LOWEST relevant month's insolation hours and that yields you your minimum array size. Probably want to add a 10-25% buffer. Even with this, there will be days where poor PV conditions mean you fall short - sometimes for a few days in a row. This is where you decide if you want a backup charging source or simply add more batteries to get through the rough patches.\n\nOk. To make a short story long\n\nLights 120w x 2hrs =240wh\n\nBig pump 75wx14hrs = 1050wh\n\nLittle pump #1 32w x 2hrs = 64 wh\n\nLittle pump #2 32w x 14hrs = 448wh\n\nFan 160w x 10hrs = 1600wh\n\nPond lights 70w x 4hrs 280wh\n\nTotal 3682wh\n\nLights 10a\n\nBig pump 6.25a\n\nLittle pump #1 - 2.67a\n\nLittle pump#2 - 2.67a\n\nFan 13.33a\n\nPond lights 5.83a\n\nTotal 40.75a\n\nAll info is from there websites\n\nI am looking at 2 sunpower 327w 64.9voc\n\nThey metered at 58 - 62 open volts (I don’t know if that is good or bad. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated).\n\n2 power queen batteries 100ah. These have good ratings but again, I know nothing. I will need a charge controller and I am really mixed up on how to figure what I need. Also a converter to go from 24v to 12v if anyone has a suggestion. Lastly my panels will be about 50’ away from the batteries. If I figured correctly I need 6 gauge wire. Has anybody used welding wire and are there pros or cons? I’m sure I’m like most people, money is a factor but I also don’t want a fire.\n\nThanks in advance\n\nGray Squatch\n\nThe two power queens only have 2560Wh total, so you'll fall short on most non-perfect sunny days.\n\nWhen people don't know their insolation hours, they take a swag and say 5 hours. Again, you can find out for your exact location from the PVWatts link in my signature.\n\nAssuming you have excellent PV conditions - unshaded from sunrise to sunset, oriented due south and tilted from horizontal to your latitude, those 327W panels will produce:\n\n2 * 327W * 5h = 3270W - under your calculated amount.\n\nYour system will not meet your needs.\n\nI tried to figure worst case scenario. Things like the lights may only get used once in a while. Little pump #1 more likely 30 minutes to an hour. Big pump and little pump #1 could be shortened a couple of hours as well as the pond lights. I really don’t want to go any bigger on the system if I can help it. There really isn’t anything that has to have backup. Do you think I could work with something like I described. If so I still need help with the charge controller and converter.\n\nI tried to figure worst case scenario.\n\nSo you define a worst case scenario, and then you deliberately don't design to cover it?\n\nThings like the lights may only get used once in a while. Little pump #1 more likely 30 minutes to an hour. Big pump and little pump #1 could be shortened a couple of hours as well as the pond lights. I really don’t want to go any bigger on the system if I can help it. There really isn’t anything that has to have backup. Do you think I could work with something like I described. If so I still need help with the charge controller and converter.\n\nSince EVERYTHING runs off 12V, is there a reason you want 24V instead of 12V?\n\n2X 12V in parallel is preferable to 2X 12V in series for 24V. The ONLY benefit of 24V is that you only need 1/2 the charge controller current... but you need a robust 24-12V converter.\n\nWhy not just run at 12V? That would eliminate the need for a converter.\n\nIt wasn’t a design but more of a place to start. As stated I’m a complete newbie to all of this. One of the things I read was going parallel you had twice as much wire. Maybe I should rethink solar. I thought I would be able to do a little project but obviously there’s a lot more to it that I didn’t know about. Hard to believe I went to college for it 40 years ago. My how things have changed! Thanks for everything."
