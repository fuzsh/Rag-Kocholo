        "text": "B.L. Freeborn © December 2022 (PDF version here.)\n\nThe Shugborough Inscription is a sequence of letters ‘OUOSVAVV’ on the first line and ‘DM’ spaced far apart on the second line. It is on a monument built between 1748 and1756 commissioned by Thomas Anson. Above it is a relief by sculptor Peter Scheemakers which is a variation of the Poussin painting Et in Arcadia ego. The famous painting by Nicolas Poussin displays this inscription on a tomb. It translates from Latin as ‘I am also in Arcadia.’ This inscription has eleven letters on top and three on bottom. The Poussin painting was done in 1637-1638. He did an earlier version in 1627. Previous to this, Guercino painted a similar but different version in 1618-1622. The original inspiration is a poem by Roman poet Virgil known as Ecologues. In this poem from 40 BC the inscription on the tomb of Daphnis is described. The tomb is in ‘Arcades.’ Daphnis was a shepherd in ancient Greek mythology.\n\nAlthough the number of shepherds changes from two to three as the work progresses they all include a tomb. At some point in time the full phrase ‘Et in Arcadia ego’ was developed. The fact that Anson invokes this phrase and adds several elements to it suggests there is more to it besides his still undeciphered cipher some 270 years later.\n\nIt would seem he saw something in Et in Arcadia ego that others had not and added the lower inscription as a clue to revealing what is in the original phrase which is most definitely a cipher as well.\n\nIndeed, his efforts resulted in creating a perplexing mystery. The solution to Anson’s ‘OUOSVAVV’ and to the riddle concealed in Et in Arcadia ego follow.\n\nPart I: OUOSVAVV DM\n\nImage Details\n\nBefore solving it, note what the image gives us:\n\n• A woman on the left stands tall but looks down.\n\n• The sky is tumultuous. On the upper coffin is a round wreath.\n\n• Her right arm is bent and rests on her hip. It forms an arc.\n\n• There are 3 shepherds each of whom has a staff. One leans to the left by the woman. The other two lean to the right. Two of the staffs seem to join at the bottom in a very large V.\n\n• Two of the shepherds gesture at the inscription. Their thumbs are out creating V’s. It is said they are pointing at the N and R but in fact they frame the letter A.\n\n• The third shepherd rests his arm on the tomb with 3 fingers together. This also appears in the Poussin version.\n\n• Their arms form two arcs. The Poussin uses a shadow to depict a third arm /arc.\n\n• While the other three look at the inscription, the shepherd on the left looks directly at the observer with a smile on his face.\n\nIs he laughing because this is a riddle? With those images in mind, the solutions move forward.\n\nCipher #1: O U O S V I V V – D M\n\nFor background purposes:\n\nMany alphabets have numerical equivalents for their letters called gematria. Hebrew, Greek and Futhork are three which have gematria. Hebrew and Greek gematria are still in use today. Then to complicate matters, just slightly, do not forget there are also Roman Numerals which are letters as well. The solution requires the Hebrew gematria – first.\n\nThe gematria used by Anson is:\n\nO is A or 70. U is Vav or 6. S is S or 60.\n\nD is D or 4. M is M or 40.\n\nThe I is both 10 and /or Roman numeral 1.\n\nV is Vav or 6, but then again it is also a 5 as in a Roman V.\n\nThe O and U are reversed. There is only one S. The I is in the correct position but there is no N. However, there is an M just below. In Hebrew gematria M has value 40 and N has value 50.\n\nThere are two V’s where there should be an N. Two Roman V’s equal 10 and 40 + 10 = 50 ⇒ N. Missing N found. ✓\n\nIt is convenient that the UO is reversed because then by putting the D in front the word DUO can be spelled. An S follows. Perhaps he meant a DUO of S’s. Missing S found. ✓\n\nThe first letter is O and as stated previously it has value 70. The P in Hebrew has value 80. Once again add two V’s or 10 and find 70 + 10 = 80 ⇒ P. ✓\n\nNotice that the DO creates the word ‘do’ which refers to Poussin. He did it. Similarly, if the V’s are replaced by N the last two letters spell NM which sounds remarkably like ‘name.’\n\nThe inscription then simply reads: DO POUSSIN NaMe. – – One mystery solved. ✓\n\nBy creating this exercise, Anson has shown us several clues to resolve the riddle in the original inscription. Note that it required two numeric systems to solve it (Hint #1) and more importantly, fixed the value of the O’s at 70 (Hint #2).\n\nBefore going further, see this puzzle in a new way – as an image. It has 3 V’s. (This is similar to the V’s and three formed by the shepherds’ hands.) It has a pattern OUO. Recall this used Hebrew gematria and the name of god in Hebrew is Yahweh spelled יהוה. It portrays the same alternating pattern. The numbers in Yahweh are 565 10.\n\nWe must pause for a moment for a bit of seemingly irrelevant information. In drafting, when drawing an image of an object, two versions are often shown: the plan view – as if one is looking down; and the side view – as if one is looking at the side. Now – in your minds eye – look at the O’ and U’s as if they are plan and side views of an object. This will be called Anson’s Big Hint.\n\nThese -3- letters are followed by an S. Recall S often represents the word South. This idea will repeat later.\n\nCipher #1 Numbers\n\nThis requires numbers for a while…distasteful to many… lovely to others.\n\nYahweh or יהוה or 565 10 can be seen in the last four letters. The V is 5 and then VI is 6. Two V’s is 10. In the fifth and sixth position from the left is V and I. This is 5th and 6th then 5 and 6.\n\nFully substituting now for the phrase but using only Hebrew gematria it equates to:\n\n70 6 70 60 6 10 6 6\n\n4 40\n\nFind 76 twice at the start. And it repeats again with 70 60. It repeats again with 60,6,10.\n\nIf the last four are seen as Roman numerals 5 1 5 5 = 16 and 60. Together 16+60 = 76.\n\nThe last four as shown sum to 28. The pattern of the layout is 2 letters and 8 letters or 28. The product of 4 (on line two) and 70 is 280.\n\nThe 4 repeats in the 40. They sum to 44. The top line sums to 234.\n\nIf the I is seen as a Roman 1, then the top line sum is 225 and 4 x 225 is 900.\n\nIf the I is seen as a Roman 1, the sum from 60 right becomes 79. The remaining numbers sum to 190. See this as a series 79,190…..or…. 7919.\n\nThere are four 6’s or 24.\n\nLet’s give some of these meaning.\n\nThe period of Halley’s comet is 76 years.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day and 24 hours of longitude mark the planet.\n\nEach hour has 60 minutes.\n\nThe number of seconds of longitude is 86400. This is also the number of seconds in a day. Half of this is 432,000 or 432 for short. Reverse this number and find 234.\n\nThe 900 reminds one the pole lies at 90̊.\n\nThe diameter of the planet is 7920 miles.\n\nThe 28 is repeated twice so it must be important. Indeed, a 40 is present and a square of sides 40 has a diagonal of 56.56 which is a number similar to that just seen above.\n\nAll but two of the numbers reference time and/or longitude. One reference is to God and the other is to a comet.\n\nHow many of these numbers will repeat in that first phrase ET IN ARCADIA – EGO?\n\nCipher #2 ET IN ARCADIA EGO\n\nTo continue, we convert these lines to their numeric equivalent in Hebrew.\n\nEach line begins with 79. (70+9) and (70+3+6). T to A (9+10+50+10) is also 79 and it is followed by 200. This is 79200.\n\nSum of top line (376) minus second line (79) is 297. A jumbled 792.\n\nIN (10+50) provides 60.\n\nNA (50+1) provides 51.\n\nI to R (10+50+10+200) provides 270.\n\nN and O (50+6) provides 56. The number of letters on the first line is 11 and on the second is 3 so together as 113 it is twice 56.5.\n\nFrom C to A (20+1+4+10+1) is 36.\n\nThis much shorter list gives us 51, 36, 376 and 270 that are new.\n\nThere are 360̊ in a circle.\n\nDue west is at 270̊.\n\nThe Greenwich Meridian is at latitude 51.51̊.\n\n3 76 should be seen as 3 and 76. We have seen the 3 in the Big Hint OUO.\n\nEvidently then, these numbers do relate to longitude and latitude.\n\nThe following important note is made. Normally E should equal 1 and A should equal 70. If this arrangement is chosen, nothing is found. Anson did the same manipulation in his riddle. ‘O’ normally has value 6 but he changed it to 70.\n\nThe original phrase Virgil used in his poem was only ‘Arcades.’ Someone in turn added the ET IN and EGO with the latter on the second line and changed ‘Arcades’ to ‘Arcadia.’ Presumably this was done in the same manner we say American for someone from America. The endings are just a change in suffix.\n\nLet’s make it worse. After all, Hint #1 suggests two gematrias may be in play here. Having tried Latin and found nothing, the next one attempted was Futhork. This alphabet is used primarily only by the most northern peoples. This inscription is very reminiscent of their style of runic riddles except in Latin letters. Since positioning is of great importance to runic riddles, it is likely the E was aligned under or almost under the I when this was first written. Furthermore, since it is in Latin and Hebrew gematria provides numbers of interest, it is likely the writer was extremely well educated. So, we proceed by using the Younger Futhork. (E and I share value 9. See chart at end.)\n\nThis seems random except the 5 and 6 follow each other. So we begin there:\n\nRC is 56.\n\nNGO is 864.\n\nSum from R to end is 43.\n\nSum of phrase ‘In Arcadia’ is 70. There are two 9’s one above the other and to the left is (9+12) or 21 so…70, 9,21 or… 7921.\n\nThe letters IN provide 98 which reminds one 89 x 89 = 7920.\n\nSum from first I to last I is 60.\n\nSum from first I to R is 32. Sum of ADIA is 32.\n\nSum from first I to D is 51.\n\nSum from C to last I is 28.\n\nSum of A above O is 14.\n\n9+9 = 18.\n\nSum of the top line is 91 and of the second is 19. Note 91 in reverse is 19.\n\nA few of these are new but actually repeat the same ideas.\n\n14 is half of 28 which is half of 56.\n\n32 is 5.65 x 5.65.\n\nThere are 180̊ degrees of latitude.\n\nThere are 19 lines in the Easter table. (See below.)\n\nEvidently, it is far from random! Indeed, it can be summed as follows to find something else of great interest.\n\nWhen was ‘he’ in Arcadia\n\nThis is a date. All the runic riddles, as shown by Alf Mongé (1967), are dated via the Easter Tables. This form of calendar was invented in 525 AD by Dionysius Exiguus but was in use in other forms since 390 AD. In the Easter Tables (used to place Easter – a moveable holiday) each year is identified by three numbers: Line #, Golden Number (GN) and Day Letter (DL). There are 19 lines for 532 years and then the calendar recycles. Each line represents 28 years by GN and DL. Each DL tells what day of the week the year started. (The period of years during which these runic riddles were being written is covered by the appended chart.)\n\nAbove we see how a year date is implied by the riddle master. The date should appear twice. Once literally and once at least by confirmation with Line #, GN and DL. One must proceed somewhat by trial and error. Notice the 15. If this is a Line #, it begins with year 1000. Numbers 1010, 1011 and 1012 are present. The first, 1010 has GN 4, DL 1 which is indicated by the 4 next to the 15. Year 1011 and year 1012 are indicated by GN’s 5 and 6 which appear just above them. They have DL’s 7 and 5,6 (leap year) respectively. The DL’s for 1012 are just above. There is no 7 or sum to 7. This gives a span of years from 1010 to 1012 which is very significant. The Spirit Pond runestone SP-3 from Maine dates itself to 1010 and 1011. Also part of the same collection, the amulet stone clearly states Vin 1010; and the Map Stone states Vinland 1011. It can be said then there is support for this interpretation. But it gets better….\n\nWho Wrote It\n\nWe know Virgil wrote the original phrase ‘Arcades’ about the year 40 BC. The age of Rome and widespread Paganism. We know Poussin and Guercino both immortalized it around 1630 in its present form. The era of the Pilgrams and witch trials. The above dating suggests that before or in the year 1010 ‘someone’ added the Et In /Ego to the phrase. The era when northern kings of Norway, Denmark and Sweden chose Christianity and began to oppress Paganism earnestly. Anson added his own two lines to those words around 1750. The age when freedom of religion was beginning to take shape. Who then added those three words during the era of Pagan oppression in the north?\n\nFortunately, many of these encrypted riddles do include the name of the author. Often it is concealed in the telestic/acrostic lines. These are the end letters running down or up the left and right sides of the inscription. In this case EE/AO reveals nothing. Now one should check the letters from both ends as noted by the word count for each line. In this case there are three words on the first line and one on the second. The third letters in, on the first line, are I and D. The first letters on the second are E and O. This is IE from the left and DO from the right.\n\nThe letters tell us two things. Anson also found this since he repeated the same ‘DO’ in his riddle. The name of the writer is then IE. But, this is a problem. It is not a name but the Latin phrase ‘ie.’ which is still in use. It essentially means ‘to restate’ or ‘as stated.’ The name then is obvious. ??? It turns out EGO is a male name of Swedish/ Danish/ Norwegian origin. But the text also uses the word ET which means in Latin ‘and.’ Interestingly, another name is also apparent at the same point in the inscription: IN and below it GE – Inge. So it reads:\n\nINGE ET EGO DO – IN ARCADIA – 1010 – 1012\n\nInge and Ego wrote this – who were in Arcadia in 1010 to 1012\n\nAnother mystery appears. Where was Arcadia of the myths and was it a real place in 1010?\n\nConceal and Anagram\n\nIt has become blatantly obvious something else is concealed here. As it happens often in these riddles when an acrostic or telestic requires a letter in a certain position something will be misspelled or words will be compressed together. Let us look at it again. Perhaps if the D is used twice and EGO becomes AGO then it reads:\n\nET IN ARC / A D / D I / A AGO\n\nNow note: ET spells ‘eat’and AD means ‘fire’ in Old English. It means ‘hell’ in Russian. DI can be taken to mean ‘die’ and ago means ‘in the past.’ Now the phrase becomes: Eat in arc, fire, die, A – a long time ago.\n\nIt was eaten in an arc. By fire died A – a long time ago.\n\nThe letter framed by the shepherds hands was A. This then is a tomb in memory of ‘A.’ Sound strange? It is about to get even stranger.\n\nWe have just assumed the word spacing was compressed. What if this contains anagrams? What words do we see? Die, eat, go, roc(k), net, near, gore, dare, tear, gear, care, gone, ran. And then there is that Big Hint Anson gave…cup or was it a can?\n\nPerhaps this says: ET I I CANADA GORE\n\nNo? We can be relatively certain this is the intended meaning by looking at the gematria in Hebrew:\n\nET I I CANADA 70 9 10 10 20 1 50 1 4 1\n\nGORE 3 6 200 70\n\nThese are found: 7920, 40, 60, 51, 51, 56, 77, 141 and 36, 270, 279. All of which were seen above. But again we have compressed CANADA into one word. Should it be CAN 141? Or CAN AD A? Either way, the whole thing becomes strange. Were Ego and Inge actually in Canada in 1010? Was it even called Canada then?\n\nVirgil used the word ‘Arcades’ and it was where ‘Daphnis’ the shepherd was from. In Latin: ‘arc’ is arc, ‘cade’ is fall, ‘ad’ is to, and ‘caed’ is kill (the root of cadaver). It ends in S. Together it is: arc-fall to death-S. Whereas, Daphnis is not quite so obvious. It is four words together as well: hid-pan-I-S or hid-pan-eye-S. The ending ‘nis’ is remarkably close to ‘N is S’ and English ‘ness’ seen in other runic riddles. A study of many of the names Virgil used are like this. Perhaps the common theme here is Paganism.\n\nIt was eaten in an arc. By fire died A – a long time ago.\n\nInge and Ego wrote this – who were in Canada in 1010 to 1012\n\nRemember – history is written by the victor.\n\nThe remainder of the secret is now easy to grasp, if the mind is willing.\n\nPrevious Post Next Post\n\nSimilar Articles by the Same Author\n\n** For numeric background see:\n\n**Freeborn, B.L., Validating North American Runic Inscriptions, noahsage.com, November 2022.\n\nFreeborn, B.L., Ancient Riddles to Test Our Wits: The Secret Chamber, noahsage.com, January 2016.

Freeborn © December 2022 (PDF version here.)\n\nSome riddles lay in plain sight for generations and no one sees them for what they are. The Younger Futhork is just such a riddle. It replaced the Older Futhork and was certainly created by someone at some point in time. Indeed, his name and the year are concealed in the script.\n\nThe sixteen rune uses the same symbol for multiple sounds. Whereas the original Futhork had twenty-four symbols that provided for the sounds of the language very well. Why then digress?\n\nThere are riddles hidden in runic inscriptions such as the Kensington Stone and the Rök runestone of Sweden. A few of the ciphers in the Rök were decrypted over a century ago. Alf Mongé revealed others in the Kensington in 1967. Other inscriptions were examined which led to the attached paper Validating North American Runic Inscriptions (pdf). Other studies followed and they are listed below.\n\nThe rune forms of the Younger Futhark evolved from the older over time and in different places. The Younger Futhark as an alphabet was ‘invented’ by someone who placed them in the known specific order at some point in time. This order prescribed the numeric value attached to each sound. It changed the gematria of the system drastically while the form of the runes continued to evolve. The two different ‘s’ shown in the image below are a prime example. They cannot be any more different. The first is very close to its form in the Older Futhark. It is not as if the older just abruptly stopped either. It was used alongside the newer for both its sound value and numeric value. This in and of itself is confusing.\n\nIt was presumed by the author that the Younger was developed to help conceal numeric data and to confuse readers of the actual reading of the script – which it does. It was developed during a time when there was increased pressure to end paganism and to convert northern Europeans to Christianity. Part of the process was to end the use of runes and use Latin letters.\n\nIf one looks at this new alphabet as a riddle, the when and who are answered. It is such a clever riddle that overnight it must have gone viral, as we say, and supplanted the older twenty-four rune Futhork. Mongé notes that often a riddle master will create an alphabet within a riddle to conceal a message. This is what this fellow evidently did and the rest is history.\n\nHere, then, is the riddle, the writer and when:\n\nYounger Futhark transcribed to Latin letters: FUThARKHNIASTBMLʀ\n\nThis begins just as the original Futhark alphabet with the same six letters, same order, similar appearance. The last five are the most interesting: TBMLʀ. It almost says ‘table’ or even ‘tumble.’ Immediately preceding this is AS and then just before this is NI as if it says ‘nigh’ which means ‘here.’ The H of nigh precedes it. The letters have been ‘tumbled.’ Clearly then, it says ‘nigh as table’ with an M stuck into the middle to add confusion. There are many arrangements that can be made if one were to form a table from these sixteen symbols. The obvious break is after the first six original runes and indeed, if one reads it again it says: KH or HK in reverse which is similar to ‘hack.’ By hacking it off there the first line is presumably formed. By trial and error the riddle can go forward or one can simply notice that there are ten runes remaining.\n\nThis gives us two lines, one of 6 and one of 10 runes. These runic riddles were laced with numbers. The numbers 56 and 792 were always present in a riddle. They often included 51 and 76. By dividing the last ten into 5 and 5, two other groups are formed which is how the aetts (sets) known today must have been derived. This gives 6, 5 and 5 runes in each aett. The preferred order should have been 565 in the same way Hebrew Yahweh is numerically 5,6,5,10. The logical way to form a table is then to use 5,6,5 runes per line. Now after a bit of trial and error the following table is created and preferred for numeric reasons as shown below.\n\nNotice the first column sums to 20. The 7 and 2 sum to 9. The 8 and 1 sum to 9. Then 8 and 9 are just to the right. So that 89 x 89 = 7920 and the numbers at the start were 7, 9 and 20. Find the 9, 2,3,4 in the center and note this also creates 792. Also 7,2,9 form a jumbled 792. This repeats this number 792 five times.\n\nThe sum of the last column is 32 which is 5.65 x 5.65. The 56 repeats at the middle end.\n\nTotal number of runes in inscription is 16 or half of 32.\n\nIf this is a Baalist/Pagan inscription then BL (ie. Baal) has values 13,15. Their sum is 28, or half of 56.\n\nThe sum down then up the diagonals (7,2,14,4,11) is 38 or half of 76. The sum of the bottom row is 70 then up to the 6 is 76.\n\nThe sum of the top row is 45 and then down to the 6 is 51.\n\nThis provides all the required numbers typically seen in Baalist/Pagan documents: 792, 56, 76 and 51.**\n\nBut this is just a simple row of numbers broken into three lines. Hardly that exciting, coincidental at the very least but not exciting to us. Now look at the letters. Those were assigned those values. The telestic and acrostics are important in riddles of this nature. Typically they reveal the name of the author and often some indication of his role.\n\nOn the right it is S K ʀ in an arc shape. Or in a bit of a loop: SKRAI. This is very suggestive of the word ‘scriva’ in Swedish meaning ‘to write.’ It is also the root of the word inscribe.\n\nNow in an arc again from the I to A ..R..L ʀ find the word IARL which Mongé identified as earl, a title (Syversen, pg. 79).\n\nOn the opposite side moving up from T to U..NI find Tuni which is an Old Swedish name. It is short for Thorniutʀ. Interestingly, Tuni / Thorniut was name of the riddle master who wrote the Leif Ericsson inscription from Noman’s Land in 1001. (see pdf below) The name was similarly broken up into Tunæ and then the remaining letters were encoded. Here, it is found as follows:\n\nH N I A S\n\nF U Th O R K\n\nT B M L ʀ ……………. Thorniut Iarlʀ scrai …\n\nI wrote – Earl Thorniutʀ\n\nIntentional, coincidental, or just imagined? Let us say it is the first because somebody at sometime designed the order of this shorter alphabet.\n\n‘When’ is the remaining question.\n\nUse this same table but now pay attention to why the letters TBML are in that order. Also notice TM sounds an awful lot like ‘time.’ Directly above the B or 13 is NU which suggests ‘now.’ We have: now, table and time. There apparently is some date hidden here.\n\nIf it does spell table, then the M is inserted between them for some reason. It has value 14. Four times 14 is again 56. Perhaps it is just to confuse. But what else does M represent?\n\nOn the Spirit Pond inscription stone (see pdf below) M as a runic M (in Younger Futhork) appeared as part of the date: M11 to indicate 1011. On the Leif Ericsson inscription from Nomans Land, M1 was used to indicate 1001. This reveals the one weakness that all these gematrias have in common and that is the inability to show 0’s. It is especially troubling if one has to write a number like 1000. A Roman numeral M is then very helpful. It has value 1000. Within the word table ‘TBL’ is inserted an M. Does it represent the year 1000? Or does it just refer to time ‘TM’?\n\nThe way to see (or prove) what date may be here is to use the Easter Tables (the hint was time table) which was how they determined dates such as Easter before modern calendars were invented. Each year is identified by three numbers. The Line number, the Golden Number (GN) and the Day Letter (DL). (See Landsverk.) For the year 1000 the Line # is 15, the GN is 13 and the DL is 6 and 7, a leap year.\n\nLine # is 15. Letter L was assigned value 15.\n\nDay letter is 13. It is nearby.\n\nThere is a 12 just before (of course) but above it is two letters: HF almost as if it says half.\n\nHalf of 12 is 6…..the day letter. ???\n\nBut this is a leap year, where is the 7? Notice the second line ends at 6 and it is a leap up to 7.\n\nThis makes year 1000 a possibility. But there is a better choice.\n\nAnother possible date is found on Line #14. The number before L is 14 and the sum above L is 14.\n\nIf NU means ‘now’ and B/13 was below it then perhaps 13 is the GN.\n\nThis year has DL 2 which is found at U above B/13 in ‘now.’\n\nLine #14, GN 13 implies year 981. This number is found in the table at INF.\n\nThe years 982, 983 are equally implied but only 981 has its DL near/in the same group.\n\nIt is for the reader to decide which date is implied.\n\nWas this devised as a riddle in 981 by Tuni, otherwise known as Earl Thorniutʀ, for the sole purpose of creating a new alphabet? Or was it a riddle that just went viral?\n\nAlso of interest, the original six letters is F U Th Æ R K… as in ‘Foe 3 ark 56.’ Another riddle!!\n\nPrevious Post Next Post\n\nSimilar Articles by this Author – pdfs as available\n\n* Easter Table pdf\n\n** For numeric background see:\n\n**Freeborn, B.L., Validating North American Runic Inscriptions, noahsage.com, November 2022.\n\nFreeborn, B.L., Ancient Riddles to Test Our Wits: The Secret Chamber, noahsage.com, January 2016.

Freeborn © December 2022 (PDF version here.)\n\nRunic riddles are riddles written in runes. Runes are alphabets that were in use in northern Europe, Britain and other northern areas. They were used for centuries but died out with the coming of Christianity.\n\nThere are a certain group of inscriptions from this period that are either difficult to interpret, very short, have unexplained symbols, use bindrunes (letters stuck together), and/ or are unusual for some reason. Here is an example from Norway (Lomen No. 2; Norges Inscrifter Med De Yngre Runer, Vol.1, Pg. 216) deemed to be a magic incantation. It is simply a riddle. The solution is at the end of the post.\n\nThese unusual ones are where the riddles hide. Primarily they were created for amusement, in the same manner as crosswords are today. Besides providing unique puzzles for people to solve, they often contained phrases and ‘secret messages’ that we find strange or incomprehensible today. They are little windows into a bygone era before the cleansing of facts by ‘modern’ teachers, internet myths, and the Catholic church. The latter worked especially hard via genocide and threats to stamp out Paganism. Throw the Black death into the picture which killed half the population of these areas and it is not surprising that the information these riddles reveal seems …. surprising to say the least.\n\nSadly, the numbers of inscriptions still in existence are declining with each passing year. They were once abundant. Many now only exist in photos. The few remaining tell us something of importance.\n\nMany preserve the concepts of Baal and Paganism. This religion can be traced back 12000 years. The remaining practitioners faced with the power of the Catholic Church found a way to preserve some hints of it in these riddles. Others tell us of extraordinary journeys. They reveal an important part of our lost knowledge.\n\nThe following posts bring a few of these riddles to you. Others are available as pdfs at the bottom of the posts.\n\nHopefully, they are both enjoyable and educational to you.\n\nSolution:\n\nThis is called a magic formula – ISTIL form. The number of duplicated runes varies. This one uses triplicates and to match the three makes bindrunes of the six initial runes. The transliteration of the three bindrunes and duplicated runes is RT UÆ KN III SSS TTT III LLL. This is an anagram for ‘stlis’ in Latin which means ‘quarrel’ or ’cause’ and/or ‘tellus’ meaning Earth or region. This implies a ‘global difficulty.’\n\nThe three bindrunes and the triplicates suggest 3. This is equal to Th (or D) rune. Simplify and add the Th: Th R T U Æ K N I S T I L. As numbers this is: 3 5 12 2 4 6 8 9 11 12 9 15.\n\nThe group ISTIL has four notable values. 9,11,12 sum to 32✓; then 9,15 sum to 24✓; then 12,9,15 sum to 36✓; and the total is 56.✓ All of these numbers are important. (For checked ✓ number meanings see below**. See next table for rune/number equivalents.)\n\nThe first group containing the bindrunes has no meaningful sums except for the total with the 3 (Th) included which is 40. A square of sides 40 has 56.56 as a diagonal. This repeats the ISTIL sum. The group does have the significant series 4 6 8 which in reverse is 864.✓\n\nThere are several elements of the riddle missing. The author and year are often stated and the number 792 (always present) is missing. This is long enough to contain both. Mongé derived the name KanutR from the first six runes. His solution is different than what is presented here. (Landsverk, Ancient…, pg. 127-138) However, by inspection the name Thorniut is found. (The Æ includes the sound O. Also, the I rune can be an E.) The only letter missing is an I and a K is left over. There are two I’s in the last group, so this implies letter sharing. If the K shifts to the last group notice this list of small abbreviated words can be formed: KIL (kill); I TIL (I tell); I LIS (I lies); S (south); I TI LI S (I tie lie South). When taken altogether the following is suggested:\n\nI Thorniut tell. The I tie lies South where it was killed in the global upheaval.\n\nThis is a typical Baalist statement including the name of the author but the number 792 is still missing so the solution is incomplete. If Thorniut is converted to numbers as given (without the I) one finds: 3 4 5 8 2 12. Now the following sums are noted: 3,4 sums to 7; then 4,5 sums to 9; then 3,4,5,8 sums to 20 so that we now have 7920.✓\n\nThe year would complete the picture. Some indication of the year and three other numbers is sought: the Golden Number (GN), the Day Letter (DL) and the Line #. These numbers are used to find dates on the Perpetual Easter Table (here). A complete discussion of this is found in any of Landsverk’s books listed below.\n\nThe letters as bindrunes were anagrammed for a reason so returning to those runes/numbers we have: 5 12 2 4 6 8. These can somewhat change order since there is no way to tell which rune of the bindrune should go first ie. 12 5 4 2 8 6 etc. Note the 1224 looks like a year and in fact, Line # 4 in the attached chart begins with that year. The 4 is present in the series. But year 1224 has GN 9 which is not present in this group. Since 3 is prominently noted by the triplicates, if taken to mean GN 3 then on this 4th line, year 1237 is indicated. It has day letter 4. The sum of this series of numbers is 37 confirming the date.\n\nOther dates for similar reasons can be found. But after much searching 1237 seemed to have the most in its favor. Mongé dated this to 3 March 1199 using just the 3’s. There is good reason to accept his date except that all versions of Istil riddles repeating 3 times would then imply the same date. The reader is free to search for other plausible dates using the attached Easter Table.\n\nI Thorniut tell in the year 1237. The I tie lies South where it was killed in the global upheaval.\n\nEarlier Riddle Posts Next Post\n\nSimilar Articles by this Author (pdfs uploaded as available)\n\n* Easter Table pdf\n\n** For numeric background see:\n\n**Freeborn, B.L., Validating North American Runic Inscriptions, noahsage.com, November 2022.\n\nFreeborn, B.L., Ancient Riddles to Test Our Wits: The Secret Chamber, noahsage.com, January 2016.
