        "text": "Narragansett Park Speedway was the site of two different 1 mile ovals. The first was a flat 1 mile horse track, and the second was a 1 mile paved, high banked oval. The location was Cranston, Rhode Island. Banking of the paved oval was approximately 20 degrees, and it was almost certainly the first true Super Speedway in North America.\n\nNew: 2006-01-21 Last Updated: 2020-01-11\n\nTable of Contents\n\nTrack Facts\n\nHistorical Note\n\nTrack Office\n\nTrack Maps and Imagery\n\nSearch for Web Pages\n\nSearch for News\n\nSearch for Images\n\nGetting There\n\nTrack Facts\n\nLatitude: 41.785 Longitude: -71.45 Time zone: EST/EDT (-0500/-0400)\n\nHistorical Note\n\nNarragansett Trotting Park was the site of the first oval race in the United States on September 7th, 1896. Races were held on the flat dirt oval until 1913. In the meantime, the horse track folded and the site was taken over by the state for use as the Rhode Island State Fairground.\n\nThe paved oval was built in 1915. The Super Speedway configuration was extremely novel, as paving and banking were both entirely new concepts in oval track racing. The track was sanctioned by AAA, with a first race on September 18, 1915, which was won by Eddie Rickenbacker. The track operated through 1924. The site is now a housing subdivision.\n\nReferences\n\nDon Radbruch, Dirt Track Auto Racing, 1919-1941: A Pictoral History.
