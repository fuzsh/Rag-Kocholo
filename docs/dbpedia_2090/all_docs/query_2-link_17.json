        "text": "Town in Punjab, Pakistan\n\nFor the island in Eritrea, see Hando. For the fictional character, see Romper Stomper.\n\nCity in Punjab, Pakistan\n\nPhalia (Urdu تحصیل پھالیہ ) is a town and headquarters of Phalia Tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin District, Punjab, Pakistan.[2]\n\nHistory\n\nAlexander the Great and his army crossed the Jhelum River (Hydaspes) in July 326 BC at the Battle of the Hydaspes River where he defeated king Porus.[2][3] According to Arrian (Anabasis, 29), Alexander built a city in the place whence he started to cross the river, which he named Bukephala or Bucephala to honour his dead horse Bukephalus or Bucephalus.[2] It is thought that ancient Bukephala was near the site of modern Jhelum City but that is wrong. Phalia was named after Bucephalus, the name of the Alexander's dead horse, and presently a tehsil of Mandi Bahauddin District. Beyond Taxila, Alexander opted for an alternative route instead of the traditional route i.e. today's Grand Trunk Road (link through Pakistan between Afghanistan and Bangladesh) and built two cities on opposite banks of the Jhelum on the route between Bhera and Mong.\n\nIn AD 997, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi took over the Ghaznavid dynasty empire established by his father, Sultan Sebuktegin. In 1005 he conquered the Shahis in Kabul and followed it by the conquests of Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal Empire ruled the region. The Punjab region became predominantly Muslim due to missionary Sufi saints whose dargahs dot the landscape of Punjab region. Jalalpur Sharif is located on west of the river Jhelum whereas Phalia on eastern bank in Mandi Bahauddin District close to river Jhelum earlier known as Hydaspes.[citation needed] A semi hill or mound i.e. the historical sign of the ancient city and a shrine still available in mid of the Mohalla Ameer. In 2010, maximum of the area reshaped into commercial land and precious heritage could not be preserved.\n\nAfter the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikh invaded and occupied Mandi Bahauddin District. The Muslims faced severe restrictions during the Sikh rule. During the period of British rule, Mandi Bahauddin District increased in population and importance.\n\nThe predominantly Muslim population supported Muslim League and Pakistan Movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslims refugees from India settled down in the Mandi Bahauddin District.\n\nPhalia is approximately the same age as Lahore. The four subdivisions (Mohallas) are named after the forefathers of Tarar tribe:\n\nPhalia Ameer for \"Muhammad Ameer\"\n\nPhalia Keeman for \"Muhammad Karim\"\n\nPhalia Boota for \"Muhammad Boota\" (also known as \"Nawan Lok\")\n\nPhalia Mehman for \"Muhammad Khan\"\n\nGeography and climate\n\nPhalia is situated at 32.43 N latitude and 73.58 E longitude.[1] It is located between the main cities of Mandi Bahauddin and Gujrat, about 23 kilometres from Mandi Bahauddin and 50 kilometres (31 mi) from Gujrat and 45 kilometres (28 mi) from Malakwal and near about 80 kilometres (50 mi) from Salam interchange on M-2 motorway, at an altitude of 672 feet (205 m) above sea level.[2][1]\n\nPhalia has a moderate climate, which is hot in summer and cold in winter. During peak summer, the day temperature rises up to 40 °C (104 °F). The winter months are mild and the minimum temperature may fall below −2 °C (28 °F).[4] The average annual rainfall in the district is 50 millimetres (2.0 in).[5]\n\nHealth facilities\n\nHealth Medical facilities are on average available in the city. The main government hospital established in the city is THH (Tehsil Headquarters Hospital). There are several other private hospitals, Health center and Clinics at different locations within the city.\n\nPhalia City\n\nPopulation and religions\n\nPhalia is not a big city. Most of the population of the village are Muslim with some Christians.\n\nLanguages\n\nPunjabi language is the native language of the province and is most widely spoken language in Phalia. Urdu language has started to become more prominent in many areas now due to its official status as the national language.[2]\n\nRegistered voters\n\nThe number of registered voters in the Constituency PP-117 (Mandi Bahuddin-II) Phalia is 134,119.[6] among them almost half of them are of female voters.\n\nAdministration\n\nAfter the abolition of Nazim system, the Administrator of Phalia is Assistant Commissioner Bilal Feroz Joya in 2016.\n\nNotable people\n\nMustansar Hussain Tarar\n\nMuhammad Tariq Tarar[7]\n\nPir Syed Muhammad Binyamin Rizvi\n\nParvaiz Mehdi Qureshi\n\nAsif Bashir Bhagat[6]\n\nBasma Riaz Choudhry\n\nMuhammad Ijaz Ahmed Chaudhary[7]"
