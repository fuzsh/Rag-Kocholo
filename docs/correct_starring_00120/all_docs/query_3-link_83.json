        "text": "“Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Brilliant. Cunning. Psychotic. In his mind lies the clue to a ruthless killer – Clarice Starling, FBI. Brilliant. Vulnerable. Alone. She must trust him to stop the killer.”\n\nJonathan Demme’s “The Silence of the Lambs” is one of the best horror thriller movies ever made; excellent Award winning performances, full of dark humour and gory thrills. This original pair of 1991 British double crowns features a design by Marcus Silversides commissioned by the design agency BLT Communications which really is two clever and visually stunning pieces of complementing artwork with an amazing use of colour (white and pale colour tones for Clarice and deep, blood red for Lecter) and imagery featuring skull adorned winged moths over both Anthony Hopkins (Hannibal Lecter) and Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster) leading characters’ mouths. Presented in very good condition these rolled (as issued) examples display superbly and represent fine pieces of original cinematic movie memorabilia.\n\nNote: the price is for both posters, Clarice Starling and Hannibal Lecter\n\nTrivia: When Sir Anthony Hopkins found out that he was cast as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, based on his performance as Dr. Frederick Treves in The Elephant Man (1980), he questioned director Jonathan Demme, and said “But Dr. Treves was a good man”, to which Demme replied “So is Lecter, he is a good man too. Just trapped in an insane mind.”\n\n…more detail\n\n“Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Brilliant. Cunning. Psychotic. In his mind lies the clue to a ruthless killer. – Clarice Starling, FBI. Brilliant. Vulnerable. Alone. She must trust him to stop the killer.“\n\nJonathan Demme’s “The Silence of the Lambs” is one of the best horror thriller movies ever made; excellent Award winning performances, full of dark humour and gory thrills. This 2020 alternative movie poster by the American graphic artist Todd Alcott is a truly outstanding piece as he re-imagines and pays homage to the classic 1962 one-sheet for another horror thriller “Whatever Happened to Baby Jane”. It really is a clever and visually stunning piece of artwork that appears as a beaten up old poster. Presented in excellent condition this rolled (as issued) example displays superbly and has been printed to look aged and distressed. Alcott’s artwork represents a great twist on traditional horror movie memorabilia and is a great example in the rapidly expanding area of alternative movie posters being one of the best looking alternative movie posters I have seen.\n\nTrivia: When Sir Anthony Hopkins‘s agent called him in London, to tell him that he was sending him a script called “The Silence of the Lambs,” Hopkins immediately thought he might be going up for a children’s movie.\n\n…more detail"
