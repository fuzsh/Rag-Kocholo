        "text": "Scott Glenn (born Theodore Scott Glenn on January 26, 1941 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) is a muscular actor whose arguably best known roles were as Wes Hightower in Urban Cowboy (1980), Jack Crawford in The Silence of the Lambs (1991), astronaut Alan Shepard in The Right Stuff (1983), and as Commander Bart Mancuso in The Hunt for Red October.\n\nDuring Glenn's childhood he was regularly ill, and was, for a year, bed-ridden. Through intense training programs he got over his illnesses and a limp that he had had.\n\nAfter graduating from a Pittsburgh high school, Glenn entered College of William and Mary where he majored in English. He then joined the Marines for three years and worked roughly five months as a reporter for the Kenosha Evening News. He then tried to become an author but found he could not write good dialogues and to get over it started going to acting classes.\n\nIn 1966, Glenn went to New York and joined George Morrison's acting class. He helped direct student plays to pay for his studies and appeared onstage in La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club productions, during this time. In 1967, he converted to Judaism and married Carol Schwartz, his wife up to now. In 1968, he joined The Actors Studio and began working in professional theatre and TV. In 1970, director James Bridges offered him his first movie role in The Baby Maker, released the same year.\n\nGlenn that year left for LA and spent about 8 years there acting small roles in films and doing brief TV stints. He appeared in Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now (1979), in a small role, while there and also worked with directors like Jonathan Demme and Robert Altman. Fed up with Hollywood, in 1978 Glenn left LA with his family for Ketchum, Idaho and worked for the some two years he lived there as a barman, huntsman and mountain ranger, occasionally acting in Seattle stage productions."
