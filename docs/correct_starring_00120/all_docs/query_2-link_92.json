        "text": "Scott Glenn says it was the script that attracted him to “The Barber,” a dark tale of murder and deceit that included a meaty character any actor would love to play.\n\nThe fact that it was being made by a new film production company based at Chapman University’s Dodge College of Film and Media Arts?\n\nThat was interesting, says Glenn, whose career includes roles in “The Right Stuff,” “Silverado” and “Silence of the Lambs.”\n\nBut, at first, he didn’t know exactly what that meant.\n\nAs he learned about Chapman Filmed Entertainment and the Chapman film school, however, Glenn says he came to love the basic concept that led to “The Barber” as its first production: Find a great script, sign a strong cast, fill key production roles with recent Chapman alums, and release the resulting movie in theaters in 11 cities across the country, which is where the movie opens on Friday.\n\n“I’d never really heard of a film school setting up their students to make something that was intended from the get-go to be commercial,” Glenn says. “I thought that was the smartest thing in the world.”\n\nSimple plan, right?\n\nHardly. Getting Chapman Filmed Entertainment and “The Barber” to the box office was a story with enough twists and turns to be worthy of a documentary all on its own.\n\nAnd, like most things at the Dodge College, it begins with Dean Robert Bassett, who had the idea to create a film company and the vision to make it happen.\n\n• • •\n\nChapman’s film school, with its state-of-the-art facilities, is the envy of other schools and many of the Hollywood professionals who’ve visited it.\n\nBut film schools are focused on making shorts, which Bassett says are great for learning but less than great for getting jobs.\n\n“No one’s going to hire you to direct a feature from a short,” Bassett said. “It’s just not going to happen.”\n\nSo a few years ago, after a donor expressed interest in investing a few million dollars in the film school’s programs, Bassett came up with the idea to start an alumni-focused production company, a place where Chapman grads could get that hire-me level of experience.\n\nBassett pitched his idea to Travis Knox, who was working as a producer in Hollywood after graduating from Chapman a few years earlier. Bassett said the company would produce three or four features a year. Knox signed on.\n\n“The university’s been incredibly supportive but there was a bit of a learning curve,” says Knox, who worked his way up from a gig as a receptionist for Bruce Willis and Demi Moore to eventually produce such films as the Morgan Freeman-Jack Nicholson hit “The Bucket List.”\n\n“They had some preconceived notions of what Hollywood is like, and we had to show them why this was good for students and alumni and the university,” Knox says.\n\nHe also had to sell Hollywood that Chapman wasn’t making student films.\n\n“Literary agents, when I explained to them what I wanted, they were reluctant to give us their clients’ scripts at first,” Knox said.\n\nEventually, Knox struck a deal for Max Enscoe’s screenplay for “The Barber.”\n\nIt’s the story of an alleged serial killer who lives quietly for years as a small-town barber until the son of the cop who’d arrested him comes to town for revenge … or maybe something worse.\n\n• • •\n\nCasting started in the fall of 2012, and getting a name actor like Glenn on board was a coup – not that he needed much convincing once he’d read the script.\n\n“It was super fun,” he says of his role as Eugene van Wingerdt. “I got to play at least four different characters.”\n\nChris Coy (one of the Terminus gang on “The Walking Dead”) signed on to play the cop’s son. Veteran character actor Stephen Tobolowsky (Ned Ryerson in “Groundhog Day”) agreed to play the small-town police chief who has no idea of his barber’s past.\n\nBut finding Chapman alumni for key roles was just as important, Knox says.\n\nBasil Owies, a 2010 graduate, was working as an assistant director on a reality TV show when he got the call to direct the film.\n\n“He had a really good vision for the movie,” Knox says. “But honestly, one of the most important things was knowing that I could put him in front of an actor like Scott Glenn or Stephen Tobolowsky, and they’d be comfortable with him.”\n\nOther grads filled out the production: Allen Lui took the role of director of photography;Brendan O’Connor served as production designer; Nader Owies and Greg Thompson shared editing duties. Roughly 50-some jobs – about two-thirds of the total – were filled by alumni, all earning minimum wage, Knox and Bassett say.\n\n• • •\n\nWith a budget of just a bit over $1 million, the production offered no margin for error. “The Barber” was shot in Orange County – a motel room and an apartment set were built on sound stages at Chapman, and locations in Orange and Santa Ana were also used – as well as Los Angeles County, primarily Monrovia, where the actual barber shop was found.\n\nDespite the tight budget and schedule, Glenn said, he had a blast throughout the shoot.\n\n“They really knew how they wanted to shoot this, how they wanted to tell the story,” Glenn said. “And they’re young. They’re not going to be, at the end of a 16-hour day, looking at their watch to go home.\n\n“I love being around that kind of energy.”\n\nBy March 2014, the film was finished. “The Barber” made its world premiere at the Busan Film Festival in South Korea, and Owies was named the equivalent of a new director to watch.\n\nIn the fall, 25 distributors showed up for screenings; five made offers, Knox said. When ARC Entertainment bought domestic distribution rights for what Variety reported as a price in the mid-six figures, Chapman Filmed Entertainment had its first movie on the way to the cinema, video-on-demand and DVD.\n\n“I’m actually kind of amazed,” Bassett said. “(But) I feel like everybody’s watching what we’re doing. There’s been a tremendous amount of interest in the industry.”\n\nThe company has options on three new screenplays: a psychological horror movie, a romantic comedy and dark family comedy, Knox says. The goal going forward is to make a handful of movies a year with strong actors, Chapman alums behind the camera, screenplays that have commercial appeal and budgets of about $1 million.\n\nFour or five Chapman grads, all women, are being considered to direct the next movie, which probably will begin production this summer, Bassett says.\n\n“An interesting thing that the trustees asked was, ‘What would be the mark of success?’” Bassett said.\n\nUsually that would be simple: Did it make money? But for Chapman Filmed Entertainment, Bassett said, it’s a bit more nuanced. “There’s a great value to us in brand elevation – I want people to know we’re doing great things here.”\n\nBut, ultimately, success will be defined on Friday, when lights dim and “The Barber” splashes across screens in 11 cities.\n\n“It’s not so much about the idea you have, (though) that’s important,” Bassett says. “But the hardest thing about making a movie is getting somebody to see your film. That’s the absolute hardest thing.”"
