Until the girl's beguiling touch awakens in him the ability to love.\n\nThen something happens, something so devastating that Creasy is consumed by a single-minded rage for revenge. And at a stroke he is transformed into the terrifying killing machine he was trained to be...\n\nHere is the goodreads synopsis of The Perfect Kill by A.J. Quinnell:\n\nThree days before Christmas in 1988,a bomb blew Pan Am 103 out of the sky over the small Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing all passengers and crew. The wife and four year old daughter of Creasy were amongst the passengers. Seeking his personal vengeance, Creasy finds the backup of power-a US Senator, whose wife also died on Pan Am 103: and of youth-an eighteen year old orphan called Michael. Ruthlessly and relentlessly, Creasy trains Michael into becoming a man in his own image. Trains him...for the perfect kill.\n\n​Source: Deadline"
