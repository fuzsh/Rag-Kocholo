        "text": "An intense and highly respected performer who excelled in a variety character roles, Scott Glenn struggled for nearly a decade before breaking through as the main antagonist in the box office hit, \"Urban Cowboy\" (1980). Prior to that, Glenn first became a known commodity with a standout turn in Robert Altman's large ensemble classic \"Nashville\" (1975), but in the ensuing decade he catapulted to fame as an Olympic track coach in \"Personal Best\" (1982), astronaut Alan Shepard in \"The Right Stuff\" (1983), and one of four accused outlaws out for revenge in \"Silverado\" (1985). After playing a submarine commander who joins \"The Hunt for Red October\" (1990), he was the head of the FBI's Behavioral Science Unit in the Oscar-winning thriller \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991). Glenn kept busy with appearance in a variety of low-profile features before turning up with character parts as a murderous Secret Service agent in \"Absolute Power\" (1997), a cop-turned-drug dealer who meets a grizzly fate in \"Training Day\" (2001), and the Director of the CIA in both \"The Bourne Ultimatum\" (2007) and \"The Bourne Legacy\" (2012). Though he never quite became a leading man, Glenn was a vibrant character actor who routinely surprised with the depth of his performances."
