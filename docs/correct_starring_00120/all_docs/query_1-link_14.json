        "text": "Scott Glenn will play cinematographer Terry Case. Glenn has starred in such films as \"Silverado,\" \"The Right Stuff,\" \"Silence of the Lambs\" and \"Urban Cowboy.\" On stage, he has acted in Burn This on Broadway, and Killer Joe Off-Broadway.\n\nAs previously announced, Stacy Keach, Stephen Lang, Linda Lavin, Matthew Modine and Heather Prete also star.\n\nThe script is reportedly based on the creation of Monroe's last movie, 1961's \"The Misfits,\" which was directed by John Huston, and for which Miller penned the screenplay. During filming, Monroe was struggling with depression, unwieldy moods and substance abuse. David Richenthal, who produced the recent Tony-honored Death of a Salesman, directed by Falls, is said to have attended a reading.\n\nThe Goodman describes the play this way: “A distinguished director is about to lose his picture due to the unstable behavior of a famously fragile movie star. She’s recognized all over the world, loved by millions, but unable to believe in herself. The studio owners are threatening to pull the plug, and a temperamental acting teacher is flown in to coax the actress out of bed and onto the set. “ Robert Falls directs in the Albert Ivan Theatre. The dates are Sept. 21-Oct. 31.\n\nKeach will play Philip Ochsner, a trucking company executive, who, through a corporate merger, has acquired the studio making the movie. Lang and Lavin will be acting teachers, reportedly based on the Strasbergs, who influenced Monroe’s life and work. Modine will play Paul, the screenwriter, and Prete will protray the troubled actress, Kitty. Miller’s previous play, After the Fall, now being given a revival on Broadway, was also inspired by his experiences with Monroe.\n\nSubscriptions may be purchased at the Goodman Theatre Box Office, 170 N. Dearborn Street, or charged by calling (312) 443-3800."
