        "text": "Scott Glenn is an American actor known for his roles in the films ‘Urban Cowboy’, ‘Silverado’, ‘The Right Stuff’, ‘The Hunt for Red October’ and ‘The Bourne Ultimatum’. He is also known for appearing as Kevin Garvey, Sr. in the supernatural drama series ‘The Leftovers’ and as Stick in both the web television series ‘Daredevil’ and ‘The Defenders’. Glenn served in the United States Marine Corps following his graduation from The College of William and Mary. He served as a reporter for a few months and later took acting classes to hone his dialogue-writing skills so as to fulfill his dream of becoming an author. Glenn instead became an actor when he made his Broadway debut in the 1965 play ‘The Impossible Years’. He then became a member of The Actors Studio and started working in professional theatre and television, appearing in many memorable plays and shows. He is mostly known for playing tough characters with a militaristic background. On the personal front, Glenn converted to Judaism upon his marriage to Carol Schwartz in 1968."
