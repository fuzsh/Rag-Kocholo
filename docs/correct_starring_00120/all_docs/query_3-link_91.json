        "text": "Actor Scott Glenn is angling to return to Off-Broadway's Soho Playhouse, where he starred in Tracy Lett's Killer Joe in 1998. The new vehicle is Richard Vetere's One Shot, One Kill, about a Marine sniper in Vietnam. Vetere told Playbill On-Line June 26 that the play would arrive at the playhouse in September, if Glenn's schedule permitted. Joe Brancato would direct. One Shot, One Kill was produced at Penguin Repertory Company in Stony Brook, NY, in 1998. The same producing team that backed Killer Joe will bring the Vetera work to Soho Playhouse. The current tenant at the Tribeca theatre, Uncle Bob, closes July 1.\n\nGlenn played the title role in Killer Joe, a trashy comedy about a murderous trailor trash family. His other credits include Burn This on Broadway. Glenn's many films include \"Silverado,\" \"Urban Cowboy\" and \"The Silence of the Lambs.\"\n\n*\n\nVetere's Gangster Apparel will be staged at Penguin Repertory Company Aug. 16-Sept. 9, in a co-production with the Emelin Theatre in Mamaroneck, New York. The comedy, which had a staging in London in the early '80s, is a comic look at the life of the Mob."
