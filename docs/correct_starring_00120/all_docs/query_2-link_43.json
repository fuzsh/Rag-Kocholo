        "text": "One memorable scene in the movie The Right Stuff portrays a lung capacity test. The astronaut candidates blow into a tube with water and a ping-pong ball. They must blow just hard enough to keep the ball between two lines, and the amount of time they can do this on one breath is measured. The test is done with a group of candidates, leading to an impromptu \"contest\".\n\nDid the real Mercury candidates have a lung capacity test similar to that shown in the movie, including the ping-pong ball?\n\nWas such testing done as a group, rather than one-person-at-a-time?\n\nGordon Cooper: (during the lung capacity test) Ha! 93 seconds. Read it and weep.\n\n(notices Glenn and Carpenter are still exhaling)\n\nJohn Glenn: (Glenn has run out of breath well past Gordo's time) Congratulations, Scott. Darn good.\n\nScott Carpenter: (shaking Glenn's hand) You were probably just getting warmed up, John. Next time I doubt I'll be the one to win.\n\nGus Grissom: (to Gordo) You hear that? We were competing with Archie and Jughead"
