        "text": "I mean, the story of my career\n\nis just the story\n\nof a whole long of real good luck.\n\nMy guess is that the best is yet to come\n\nand I have no idea what it is.\n\nBecause that's the way\n\nmy life has really worked.\n\nMeeting Carol, to becoming an actor\n\nto all of the best things in my life\n\nhave been accidents.\n\nHave just happened to me.\n\nAnd I've had the...\n\ngood sense to recognize it.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\n[Narrator] It was an open call.\n\nWhen I showed up at the sound stage\n\nthere were probably\n\nmaybe 50 actors there.\n\nAnd Francis\n\nhe picked four guys\n\nand he said, Here's the deal.\n\nYou're in a boat\n\nthe engine is off, you're floating down the Mekong River\n\nyou're having an argument\n\nwho the Playmate of the Year should be.\n\nAnd they begin to have this argument.\n\nDoing great improvisational work\n\nyelling at each other\n\nand I'm sitting there watching it\n\nand I guess at a certain point\n\nI rolled my eyes\n\nkinda like this.\n\n[Narrator exhales]\n\nAnd Francis stopped the improv.\n\nHe said, I saw that, Scott.\n\nThese people are doing serious work\n\nI don't need you making a comment on this work.\n\nWhy did you do that?\n\nAnd I said, It wasn't that the work was bad\n\nbut these guys are on a boat\n\nwith the engine turned off\n\nfloating down the Mekong River.\n\nYou scream and yell like that\n\nyou gonna have a mortar round\n\nin your laps in five seconds.\n\nAnd Francis looked at me\n\nand turned to his AD\n\nand he said, I want him in my movie.\n\nI got to the Philippines.\n\nIt was Friday.\n\nAlmost everybody was going back to Manila\n\nto have their weekend\n\nand I decided I'd just stay on location.\n\nThat Friday evening, the worst typhoon\n\nto hit the Philippines since 1932 came in.\n\nTyphoon Didang.\n\nEverybody thought we were dead.\n\nFor two days, we lost all contact.\n\nWe were on an isthmus\n\nthat was turned into an island.\n\nWe had to sort of organize the place.\n\nThere was a woman who was pregnant with twins.\n\nSince I delivered my second daughter myself\n\nI was the only person who had any idea\n\nof how to do that.\n\nSo finally, two to three days later\n\nFrancis came back on a helicopter.\n\nAll of our sets were destroyed.\n\nWe obviously had to rebuild things\n\nand start all over again.\n\nWe went down to the edge of a stream\n\nthat they were gonna shoot on\n\nwhich was now a whitewater\n\nbecause of all the water.\n\nAnd Francis, the insurance adjuster\n\nI think Vittorio Storaro\n\nthe DP\n\nand...\n\nthree or four guys\n\ngot in this boat\n\nand they were gonna go out onto the stream\n\nto take a look at it.\n\nThey tied a rope on the back of this boat\n\nand let the boat out onto the stream\n\nthinking if the stream carries it down\n\ndownstream very quickly\n\nthey could pull it back.\n\nAnd I'm watching this from about 50 yards away.\n\nI was not that long out of the Marine Corp\n\nalways had a knife.\n\nAnd when I saw what was happening\n\nI just realized\n\nthe minute the tide gets that boat\n\nit's gonna snap it straight downstream\n\nand the...\n\nand the rope is gonna pull the boat down\n\nand the boat it gonna sink.\n\nSo the minute they let it go\n\nI started running towards the rope\n\ndove at it\n\ncut the rope.\n\nIt didn't sink.\n\nLater on that night, Francis said, You saved my life.\n\nAnd I said, I don't know if I did or not.\n\nI just acted on instinct.\n\nAnd Francis said, you've helped my out so much\n\nI can write you a better part than you were cast.\n\nJust tell me what you wanna do\n\nand I'll write it right now.\n\nAnd I said, I wanna be in the end of the movie.\n\nAnd he said, What?\n\nAnd I went, Yeah\n\nI wanna be in the part\n\nat the end of the movie\n\nwith\n\nMarlon Brando\n\nand Dennis Hopper.\n\nAnd Francis said, I'm sorry, Scott\n\nthat's the only part of the movie\n\nthat's completely cast.\n\nThere's nothing in it for you\n\nI mean, you could play Captain Colby\n\nthe guy that went up the river ahead of Martin\n\nbut it's a tiny part, very few lines\n\nBut if you wanna do that\n\nI'm good to my word.\n\nAnd I said, I do.\n\nColby.\n\nI realized at the time that acting\n\nis serving an apprenticeship.\n\nYou really can't learn how to act\n\nin school\n\nor from a book or...\n\nAnd I was gonna be around, arguably\n\nAmerica's greatest actor\n\nFrancis working with him.\n\nSo that's how that happened.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nCarol is laughing right now.\n\nI got called\n\nfrom my manager\n\nJohnnie Planco\n\nanother one of my best friends\n\nwho's no longer with us.\n\nBut\n\nat the time, he said\n\nMarvel is really interested\n\nin your playing this character Stick.\n\nI didn't know any of those characters at all.\n\nAnd he said, it's the mentor to the Daredevil\n\nthat will be played by Charlie Cox.\n\nAnd I went, oh.\n\nAnd I got so angry\n\nbecause I thought\n\nthe mentor.\n\nYeah, I'm gonna play some old guy\n\nwho sits behind a desk\n\nand sends\n\nyoung actors out to do all kinds of fun interesting stuff.\n\nThis is going to be a pain in the butt\n\nand I don't even think I wanna do it.\n\nAnd I got\n\nI got stupidly angry.\n\nThere's a hike south of here\n\nthat's very steep\n\nand in furor well I...\n\nran up the side of this mountain.\n\nIt was so steep and I was, you know\n\nso full of myself, stupidly\n\nwith my big dumb ego\n\nthat I jammed my hip coming down.\n\nGot home\n\nand they had sent the script.\n\nAnd I started reading the script and I went\n\nwhoa!\n\nThis is a blind assassin\n\nwho's an expert with swords and knives\n\nand comes out of this incredible dark crazy background\n\nand has adopted this kid.\n\nI've never even played blind, how do...\n\nAnd all of a sudden I felt stupid\n\nbecause I went from hating the idea of the part\n\nto loving the actuality of the part.\n\n[breathing deeply]\n\nNice catching up.\n\nI remember when I met the stunt coordinator.\n\nHe said, Do you know anything about martial arts?\n\nAnd I went, Yeah, a little bit.\n\nAnd he said, What about martial arts\n\nwith knives and swords?\n\nAnd I said, Yeah, a little bit.\n\nHe said, well, how long have you been doing this stuff?\n\nAnd I said, Kind of since I was 10 years old.\n\nAnd I remember he had a couple of fake rubber\n\nthey were all knives.\n\nAnd I said, Why don't we...\n\nWanna spar a little bit?\n\nAnd he said, Sure.\n\nSo we started.\n\nWe were knocking over racks of dresses\n\nand after about\n\nprobably two minutes\n\nhe just stopped in the middle of it.\n\nYou can do all this stuff better than me.\n\nI'm not gonna double you with any of this.\n\nAnd at the time, I had just met a guy\n\nwho has become my Sifu, Dan Anderson.\n\nHis dojo is Broadway and Canal.\n\nAnd so when I wasn't doing the TV show in Brooklyn\n\nI was at Anderson's\n\njust playing with knives and swords\n\nand stuff like that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI was in Europe\n\nand I got a package in the mail\n\nand it was from Larry Kasdan.\n\nHe said, Here, I wrote this part for you\n\nwhat do you think?\n\nAnd I read Silverado\n\nand I yelled\n\nYahoo!\n\nAnd threw the script up in the air\n\nand danced around the hotel room\n\nI was so happy.\n\nSo Larry wrote that...\n\nWrote that sucker for me.\n\nYou men\n\nstay with your wagons and your families.\n\nGet rolling, keep your eyes peeled.\n\n[Black Coat Man] Wait a minute.\n\nEven if you do get the money.\n\nHow do we know you'll come back?\n\nWell, if we don't you can keep my brother.\n\n[horses neighing]\n\n[Narrator] First thing\n\nhe said is there anyone here\n\nwho can't ride a horse?\n\nAnd Danny Glover and I took one big step forward.\n\nAnd everyone else didn't.\n\nI always consider it\n\nto be unwise\n\nto pretend you do something you can't.\n\nDanny and I were given, by the wranglers\n\nhorseback riding lessons\n\neveryday\n\nup until when we began shooting.\n\nAbout four days before we began shooting\n\nLarry Kasdan picked the horses he wanted\n\neach one of us characters to ride.\n\nAnd for me, it was a huge Quarter Horse\n\nthe size of a Clydesdale\n\nbut a pure Quarter Horse\n\ngray, named Ajax.\n\nAnd he told the wrangler, Freddy\n\nhas someone got on that horse?\n\nAnd Fred said, No\n\nthat's my own horse.\n\nStunt riders can't even ride that horse\n\njust turned five so he's very young\n\nand he's already two times world steer roping champion.\n\nIf you get near this horse with a pair of spurs on\n\nhe's gonna kill you.\n\nAnd I...\n\nsaid, You know what?\n\nWhy don't you saddle the horse\n\nand let's see\n\nif the horse tries to kill me or not.\n\nSo as I was walking out\n\ntowards this big horse\n\nI remember an animal trainer\n\na woman named Barbara Woodhouse\n\nsaying\n\nthat horses communicate with each other\n\nby blowing into each others noses.\n\nSo I'm walking out\n\nand I walk up to this big horse\n\nand he kind of looks at me.\n\nAnd I said, To begin with Ajax\n\nI'm supposed to tell I'm the boss.\n\nGuess what?\n\nI'm not.\n\nYou're way bigger than me\n\nyou're way stronger.\n\nI don't know anything about riding horses.\n\nI'm talking to the animal.\n\nI said, So you're in charge.\n\nYou're the boss.\n\nAnd he brought his nose\n\nright up to my face.\n\nSo when he did, I...\n\nBlew in his nose\n\nand he...\n\nblew back at me\n\nand hit me with a word of snot\n\nthe size of a snot ball\n\nlike right in my face\n\nI wiped it off\n\nand he just stood there.\n\nI put my foot in the stirrups\n\ngot up on\n\nand set the saddle.\n\nHe didn't move.\n\nI'm like...\n\n[Narrator clucking]\n\nHe starts walking.\n\nI'm thinking\n\nI don't even feel myself\n\nmotion into the left.\n\nHe goes to the left.\n\nI do to the right.\n\nHe moves to the right.\n\nI touch him with my heels.\n\nNow this is a world champion steer Roper.\n\nI touched him with my heels.\n\nHe goes from a walk to a straight out hard gallop.\n\nBut I'm comfortable on him\n\nand at one point\n\nwe go to the left\n\nwe go to the right.\n\nIt's like being on a sports car\n\nat one point, I think I want him to stop.\n\nI dropped my heels and say, Whoa\n\nthis horse is used to jerking the steers on their butts.\n\nSo he...\n\ndoes like that.\n\nI go over his head\n\nand land in the ground\n\nluckily I didn't break anything.\n\nBut the minute I landed on the ground\n\nAjax, trotted over to me\n\nput his big nozzle on my face\n\nand started rubbing me with his head.\n\nHe fell in love with me.\n\nPeople see that movie now\n\nand they think I'm an expert rider.\n\nI'm not, I still really don't know how to ride horses.\n\nIt's just that this...\n\nmonster, phenomenal athlete\n\nlove me.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nI had a part in the Western called\n\nThe Great North-field Minnesota Raid\n\ndirected by Phil Kaufman.\n\nI had to go to Universal to...\n\nto meet the...\n\nthe producers\n\nand just get to know them.\n\nAnd the producers\n\nwalked in.\n\nPhil said, this is Scott Glenn\n\nhe's going to be playing this part.\n\nAnd he said, great, great\n\nwe just want to meet you great.\n\nSo we'll see you on location.\n\nI hop on my motorcycle.\n\nI drive back to Venice where we're living.\n\nThe phone is ringing.\n\nI pick it up.\n\nIt's just Phil Kaufman.\n\nHe said, I couldn't let an agent\n\nor someone else tell you this Scott.\n\nYou're not gonna be in my movie.\n\nYou're half an inch too tall.\n\nAnd I remember saying, I'll wear moccasins.\n\nI'll drop my knees down a little bit\n\na half an inch.\n\nHe said, I'm sorry\n\nIt's not gonna work.\n\nBut the next time I have a film where I have real control.\n\nI'm gonna send you the script\n\nand you get to pick your part.\n\nI get said the right stuff.\n\nI called Phil Kaufman up\n\nand I said, I know what I wanna play.\n\nAnd he thought I was going to say\n\nChuck Yeager\n\nor maybe John Glenn.\n\nAnd I did not.\n\nI said, I wanna...\n\nI wanna do Alan Shepard\n\nand there was a long pause.\n\nAnd he said, Alan Shepard?\n\nWell that's kind of a comedic part.\n\nAnd I said, yeah, yeah\n\nit's funny.\n\nThat's right.\n\nThat's what I wanna to do\n\nI wanna be the IC commander.\n\nDear Lord\n\nplease don't let me fuck up.\n\nI didn't quite copy that.\n\nSay it again please.\n\nI said, everything is okay.\n\n[Narrator] And he said, I'm good to my words Scott.\n\nYou wanna be Alan Shepherd.\n\nYou are Alan Shepherd.\n\nWould you like to meet him?\n\nAnd I said, absolutely not.\n\nI'm a home movies\n\nof him\n\nas far back in his life as possible.\n\nEverything I can see recorded about him\n\nbut I don't wanna meet the guy himself because\n\nif you play somebody and...\n\nthey know that their image\n\nis going to be exploded on a screen\n\nthe size of a four-storey building.\n\nThey will...\n\neven without intending it\n\nedit themselves.\n\nAnd I didn't want that.\n\nI wanted\n\nAlan Shepherd\n\nthe inside of Alan Shepard to be my creation.\n\nMr. Glenn, You are way out of line.\n\nEach man here is volunteered to do a job\n\nand doing many things\n\nabove and beyond the strict call of duty.\n\nsuch as bringing girls up to your room\n\nin the middle of the night.\n\nAnd foregoing any semblance of an orderly family life.\n\nAnd Mr. Glenn\n\nas long as a man uses good sense.\n\nWhat he does with his zipper or is his wreck\n\nis his own business.\n\nMy favorite review I've ever gotten in my whole life\n\nwas after we finished the film\n\nthen Admiral Shepard\n\nwrote a note to Phil Kaufman\n\nand he said, please show this to Scott Glenn.\n\nHe said, Mr. Glenn\n\nyou got me\n\nalmost perfect.\n\nI have no criticism.\n\nYou only missed one thing.\n\nAnd that is...\n\nyou ain't anywhere near\n\nas good looking as I am.\n\n[Narrator laughing]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nJonathan Demme\n\nwas a good friend of ours.\n\nHe called me up and...\n\nasked me to come to New York.\n\nThere's this part\n\nand I want you to play it in Silence of the Lambs.\n\nI'm going to send you to Washington.\n\nSo I went and I spent a period of time\n\nsitting in on cases, case studies\n\nstill have bad dreams\n\nabout some of the stuff that I was exposed to.\n\nAnd I haven't led a very sheltered or easy life so...\n\nthis stuff I was privy to\n\nthe human condition\n\nhad a degree of darkness\n\nI never knew existed.\n\nSo it was rough in that way.\n\n[Scott] And you are to tell him\n\nnothing personal Starling.\n\nBelieve me, you don't want Hannibal left inside your head.\n\nJust do your job\n\nbut never forget what he is.\n\n[Narrator] When we did the table read\n\nthe description of me and Jody when we meet.\n\nIt said\n\nthe relationship between these two people is strange.\n\nAre they father and daughter?\n\nMentor and student?\n\nBoyfriend and girlfriend?\n\nJonathan at the time as we were reading\n\nhe said, forget all that guys.\n\nYou can't play that.\n\nThere's no way you can play that complicated\n\nor relationship.\n\nOkay, cut to...\n\ntwo or three weeks into shooting the film.\n\nThere's a scene when Jody is coming out of her office\n\ngetting on the limo\n\nto go to West Virginia.\n\nShe had a hard time getting in the limo.\n\nI opened the back door\n\nand I took her arm\n\nto help her into the...\n\ninto the limo.\n\nAnd Jonathan yells, cut cut cut.\n\nHe comes running up to us.\n\nHe says, Scott\n\nplease don't.\n\nI don't want you to touch Jody.\n\nAnd Jody said\n\nyeah I mean, he was just being polite.\n\nJonathan said, remember when we did the table reading\n\nand I told you guys\n\nthere's no way in the world\n\nyou can play that relationship.\n\nGuess what?\n\nI've been looking at dailies\n\nand that relationship is exactly there already.\n\nAnd Scott\n\nI know if you physically touch her\n\nit's all gonna be blown.\n\nI only want you to touch Jody\n\ntwice in this whole movie.\n\nwhen she's gone through the experience\n\nof dealing with this serial killer\n\nand someone has died in her hands.\n\nI want you to walk out of that house\n\nand put your arm over her shoulder\n\nat the very end of the film\n\nI want you to shake her hand\n\nand that can shape will be so lovely.\n\nThat's what a great director is all about.\n\nGreat directing\n\nis having that kind of sensitivity\n\nand being able to make those kind of calls.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nCarol and I had moved\n\nup here to Idaho.\n\nDriving back\n\nwe stopped off at paramount\n\nto see Jim Bridges\n\nwho directed me in the first movie I'd ever done\n\nSomething called Baby Maker.\n\nHe looked at me and said, Oh my God\n\nthis is unbelievable.\n\nI'm doing a movie\n\nthat you're perfect for the bad guy.\n\nStick around town for three days\n\nmeet the producers, meet the...\n\nstar who has cast approval.\n\nAnd I think we'll make this happen.\n\nAnd I...\n\nSaid\n\nno.\n\nI came up here.\n\nTwo weeks later, the phone rings\n\nand it's Jim Bridges again.\n\nAnd he's...\n\nhe said, okay now\n\nI'm on location in Houston.\n\nParamount doesn't want you to do this part.\n\nThey don't know who you are.\n\nCome down to Houston\n\nand we can make this thing happen.\n\nI hop in my...\n\nmy pickup, on my way to Houston.\n\nI stopped outside of Huntsville prison\n\nbecause I know the character I'm playing.\n\nAnd as I'm parked there\n\nthese two guys\n\nwho I know from another time in my life.\n\nWho were friends of Freddy Fender's\n\nBaldemar Huerta.\n\nAnd these guys are pistoleros.\n\nThe real thing.\n\nAnd one of them\n\nwalks up to me\n\nin my truck and he said, Hey [indistinct]\n\nwhat are you doing here?\n\nAre you doing a movie?\n\nWhat do you play in?\n\nI said bank robber and they go\n\nHey our buddy\n\nhe's a gringo.\n\nA bank robber, he's getting out today.\n\nYou wanna meet him?\n\nI mean, my God\n\nwhat a gift.\n\nSo I hung out with these guys for about a day.\n\nAnd then I...\n\nI got rid of them because\n\nI wanted to go try to get a movie\n\nnot wind up in jail.\n\nDrove down to Houston.\n\nIrving Azoff.\n\nWho wanted me to do the part\n\nDebra winner\n\nwho wanted me to do the part.\n\nJim bridges\n\nwho wanted me to do the part\n\nand John of all them, God bless him.\n\nHe also wanted me to do the part.\n\nSo kind of over\n\nParamount's objections.\n\nThey said, yes\n\nand I started one of the three parts in my life\n\nthat really played me.\n\nMexicans say\n\nyou eat the worm\n\nyou're going to see visions.\n\nVisions of what?\n\nI don't know\n\nI heard the whole mess in my nursing vision.\n\nI sure feel good.\n\nI talk about being lucky.\n\nI've got her a bull in the Huntsville prison rodeo.\n\nI was just going to sit on the bull\n\nand...\n\nthen they were gonna cut and a stock rider\n\nwas gonna actually get on the bull\n\nride in the long shore.\n\nI'm sitting on this bull\n\nand I don't know where the camera is.\n\nI think, you know\n\nhow close are they?\n\nSo when I take a rap.\n\nI take what's illegal in PRC\n\nbut\n\nall the cons do at the Huntsville Prison Rodeo\n\nwhich is called suicide rap.\n\nInstead of just wrapping the rig around your hand once\n\nyou put lighter fluid and rolls in on your glove\n\nand then you thread it\n\nbetween your little finger and your ring finger.\n\nYou take the leather glove.\n\nPound it down.\n\nNow you're locked in.\n\nThe bad part about that is\n\nif both\n\nthrows you and you have a suicide wrap\n\nwhat they call hung up.\n\nYou're\n\nwith the bull\n\nwherever it goes...\n\nprobably will kill you\n\nor jerk your arm literally out of your body\n\nwho knows.\n\nBut I thought, God forbid\n\nsome ex-con\n\nsees this movie and sees\n\nI didn't take a suicide rap.\n\nbecause my biggest critics\n\nare always the people that actually do the job.\n\nSo anyway, I took the suicide rap.\n\nNone of us had figured\n\nthat the bulls are used to being in roll out gate.\n\nA matter of seconds before they go.\n\nThis was like 15 minutes\n\nwhile they were lighting the shot.\n\nAnd finally, the bull on camera decided\n\nI'm leaving whether the gate is open or not\n\nand just charge\n\nup out of the deck.\n\nIf I hadn't had a suicide rap\n\nI would've slipped down behind its butt\n\nand probably been kicked to death.\n\nEverything literally went into slow motion.\n\nI mean, I had all the time in the world\n\nand I looked up\n\nI grabbed the tail\n\nI popped it loose.\n\nwe went down the bull went forward.\n\nI hit the ground\n\nwith a chipped collarbone\n\nand concussion.\n\n[audience shouting]\n\nI don't really remember this\n\nbut what I actually did\n\nwas dropped right back on my feet\n\nclimb back on the lead up gate\n\njumped back on the bull\n\nand I saw blood all around the wood of the gate\n\nand I said\n\nis that my blood, is that my blood?\n\nAnd it wasn't.\n\nIt was like one of the stock handlers\n\nhad reached in to grab me\n\nand try to save my life\n\nhad been hit\n\nwith the bull's horn\n\nand shattered his cheek.\n\nAnd it was his blood all over the place.\n\nAnd I said, is that my blood?\n\nAnd they said, no Scott, it's not your blood.\n\nI said, you don't understand\n\nif it is\n\nyou got to get hair makeup here\n\ncause it's got to match to shot.\n\nIt's got to match the shot. I...\n\nI don't remember any of that.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nThe leftovers\n\nwas the single best acting experience\n\nI've ever had in my life.\n\nDoing a no small part\n\nto Damon Lindelof.\n\nThree times in my life.\n\nI've had parts that played me\n\nand...\n\nin my job was just to get out of the way.\n\nOne was Urban Cowboy.\n\nOne was a play\n\nI did off Broadway called Killer Joe.\n\nAnd the third was The Leftovers.\n\nWhere the writing was so deep inside me.\n\nwhen I woke up in the morning\n\nI just say to myself\n\nScott, your job today\n\nis just stay out of the way.\n\nThe other great blessings\n\nI had aside from Damon\n\nMimi Leder as a director\n\nand Justin Theroux\n\nas the star.\n\nAnd I love\n\nthose three people\n\nwithout them\n\nthere would have been no performance for me.\n\n[Old man] If you're asking me\n\nwhen I started losing my shit\n\ncontrary to the professional opinion of others\n\nI maintain\n\nmy ship remains intact.\n\n[Narrator] I remember where the longest monologue\n\nDamon told me, he said\n\nit's the longest speech I've ever written in my life.\n\nI said, what is it, a couple pages?\n\nHe said no, actually it's seven pages.\n\nWhen it came time to do that scene\n\nand we were in the Outback in Australia.\n\nMimi was going to do it in cuts\n\nand I said, you know I think I know this whole thing.\n\nCan we just...\n\ndo the whole thing?\n\nShe said sure, we'll do it once\n\nand see\n\nwhat you miss.\n\nSo we went through the whole\n\nI didn't miss any of it.\n\n[Blond old Man] I used to hear voices.\n\nThey started about five minutes after it happened\n\nafter people disappeared.\n\nSo they put me in an institution.\n\nWe went through the whole thing and Mimi said\n\nthat was great, Scott.\n\nRemember when you picked up the tape recorder\n\nand you almost started crying\n\nwhen you were listening to your son talk.\n\nAnd I said\n\nno, this is what it mean.\n\nI said, I remember picking up a tape recorder.\n\nShe said, what do you remember from the scene?\n\nI said\n\nnot much.\n\nI remember you saying action\n\nand...\n\nsaying cut.\n\nSo you weren't directing yourself at all?\n\nAnd I'm like [shaking his head]\n\nshe said, would you be willing on the second take\n\nso that a little bit of you\n\ncould hang laugh and watch it\n\nbecause if you can't direct yourself\n\nI can't direct you either.\n\nI can't say\n\nat this point\n\nwould you be willing to do that?\n\nAnd I said, no.\n\nI said,I actors lived their whole life.\n\nNot just actors, artists\n\nfor these moments when it does you\n\nand I'm not willing to do that.\n\nShe said, what do you suggest we do?\n\nAnd I said, just a lot of texts.\n\nShe said, it'll wear you out.\n\nAnd I said, no.\n\nSo we did, I don't know\n\nsix, seven takes something like that.\n\nMimi, rather than trying to take control one way\n\njust let me go until she saw what she wanted.\n\nAnd the whole experience of doing that show was that way.\n\n[Blonde Old Man] I believe\n\nthe rains will come\n\nand with them\n\na great flood.\n\nI have to sing to make it stop.\n\nIt did me in such a profound way.\n\nI still\n\nI miss it a lot.\n\nI miss all those people.\n\nWish the show was still on the air.\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nRoughly it's a disaster film.\n\nAnd the disaster is...\n\na comment is headed for the earth.\n\nFirst they think it's gonna be a near miss.\n\nAnd then the...\n\nthe people of the trucktors then figured\n\nOh, whoops, no\n\nit's gonna hit.\n\nIt's going to be the kind of...\n\nevent that killed the dinosaurs.\n\nSo the defense department decides to grab\n\na group of I don't know, 50 people.\n\nBring these people\n\ninto these bunkers in Greenland\n\nto restart\n\ncivilization all over again.\n\nAnd it's essentially a family\n\nthat are in some kind of crisis with themselves.\n\nSo we track\n\ntheir journey trying to get to Greenland.\n\nI play someone who is a widower\n\nwho\n\ndeeply misses his wife\n\nto the extent where he's not really concerned\n\nwith living or die\n\nbut very much loves this family.\n\nThat's coming by.\n\nMy Mary went to heaven in this place.\n\nAnd when the good Lord is ready for me to join her\n\nI'm going to be right here in this place too.\n\nBags packed.\n\nThat's what excites me now about this film\n\nand also...\n\na little shout out to\n\nRic Waugh\n\nthe director\n\nwho did a phenomenal job of directing this film\n\nand directing me in the film.\n\nLittle shout out to him.\n\nThank you all\n\nfor once again\n\nwatching me\n\nand these characters that I play\n\nthat are iconic\n\nreally a lot more because of you\n\nand because of me."
