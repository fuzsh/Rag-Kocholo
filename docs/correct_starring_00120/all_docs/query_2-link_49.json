Glenn's illustrious career spans nearly six decades, with notable performances in acclaimed films and recent TV series.\n\nHe will return to HBO for season 3 of \"The White Lotus.\"\n\nScott Glenn embodies mastery in physical fitness, mental well-being, and spiritual fulfillment.\n\nIdaho vs. Los Angeles.\n\nScott Glenn, an 85-year-old actor, maintains exceptional fitness, career success, and fulfilling relationships.\n\nGlenn moved to Idaho in his late 30s after his wife encouraged him to join a challenging mountain expedition.\n\nDespite initial altitude sickness, Glenn embraced the physically demanding experience and discovered a passion for rock climbing.\n\nUnder the guidance of experienced climber Tony Jones, Glenn's rock climbing skills improved, and he was introduced to advanced techniques.\n\nGlenn's time in Idaho transformed his life, emphasizing the importance of stepping out of one's comfort zone and embracing new challenges.\n\nApocalypse Now, self-confidence soon after.\n\nScott Glenn had done a lot of work in New York, mainly street theater and improv.\n\nHe moved to LA to do his first film, Baby Maker, and had small parts in big movies like Nashville and Apocalypse Now.\n\nWhile working on Apocalypse Now, he realized that he lacked self-confidence as an actor.\n\nFrancis Ford Coppola offered him a small part in the end of the movie, which Glenn saw as an opportunity to learn from Marlon Brando and other great actors.\n\nAfter Apocalypse Now, Glenn returned to LA with newfound self-confidence and arrogance.\n\nHe was locked out of Universal Studios due to his arrogance and had to prove himself again.\n\nBurt Lancaster’s movie star lessons.\n\nScott Glenn, an 85-year-old legendary actor, felt he had become a \"show business politician\" in Los Angeles and moved to Idaho to pursue his interests.\n\nWhile in Idaho, he received a call from a friend offering him a small part in a movie in Mexico, where he met Burt Lancaster.\n\nDespite initial reservations, Lancaster was impressed with Glenn's wife's pottery and commissioned her for a piece.\n\nLancaster recognized Glenn's acting potential and offered him valuable advice on the differences between stage and film acting.\n\nGlenn emphasizes the importance of hard work and dedication, having learned from a versatile mentor who was an aerialist, traveled with a carnival, and fought in tough man contests.\n\nThe birth and death of Wes Hightower.\n\nScott Glenn, now 85, landed a role in the movie \"Urban Cowboy\" while on a road trip with his wife.\n\nAfter meeting a real-life bank robber and bull rider in prison, he accepted the role and learned bull riding techniques from him.\n\nWith the support of the director, Jim Bridges, and the cast, including Deborah Winger and John Travolta, Glenn secured the role and made his mark in the film industry.\n\nGlenn's life changed after starring in \"Urban Cowboy\" without auditioning again, leading him to decline TV series offers to focus on acting and outdoor activities in Idaho.\n\nWhile playing the character \"West High Tower,\" Glenn became so immersed in the role that it affected his personal life, causing his wife to leave him temporarily.\n\nRealizing the impact of his performance, Glenn symbolically ended the \"West High Tower\" persona and returned to Idaho.\n\nUpon his return, he found scripts for lead roles in movies offering substantial money, marking a significant turning point in his career.\n\nCatching the attention of James Bridges.\n\nScott Glenn met James Bridges after Ed Peron recommended him for a role in a movie.\n\nBridges was impressed with Glenn's acting and decided to write the script for Urban Cowboy with him in mind.\n\nGlenn's screen test involved a confrontation with a \"Bandido Texas\" while Deborah Winger was performing a bull ride.\n\nAG1 is a daily nutritional supplement that supports whole body health.\n\nIt contains vitamins, probiotics, and whole food source nutrients.\n\nAG1 supports the brain, gut, and immune system.\n\nTim Ferris recommends AG1 and offers a free one-year supply of vitamin D and five free AG1 travel packs with the first subscription purchase.\n\nScarlet fever.\n\nScott Glenn's initial dream was to become a writer, not an actor.\n\nAt the age of 9, he contracted scarlet fever and was critically ill.\n\nCrystalline penicillin, a thick substance, was used to save his life.\n\nThe experience of fighting for his life transformed him into an athlete.\n\nHe developed a love for his fantasies and imagination during this time.\n\nGlenn believed he was directly related to Lord Byron on his mother's side.\n\nAfter recovering from scarlet fever, his bones were soft and he limped for almost 4 years.\n\nTo overcome his physical frailty and embarrassment, he became an athlete.\n\nFrom Marine to police reporter.\n\nDecided to pursue a life of adventure and writing instead of an imaginary one.\n\nEnlisted in the Marine Corps for six months as a reservist due to limited technical abilities and hearing loss.\n\nAfter completing his service, worked as a police reporter for the Kenosha Daily News despite not knowing how to type.\n\nWitnessed a shooting incident and covered the story, leading to his appointment as a police reporter.\n\nRealized that being a police reporter involved more than just covering exciting crimes and often required interviewing people in difficult situations.\n\nStarted acting in high school and college, performing in plays and musicals.\n\nMoved to New York City to pursue acting professionally and landed his first role in the play \"The Impossible Years\".\n\nGained recognition for his performances in films such as \"The Right Stuff\", \"Silverado\", and \"The Hunt for Red October\".\n\nContinued to act in both leading and supporting roles throughout his career, appearing in over 100 films and television shows.\n\nBerghof Studios and parental advice.\n\nAfter receiving feedback on his stiff dialogue, Scott Glenn took an acting class in New York and instantly felt a connection to the craft.\n\nHis father, who had a background in gambling and drinking, advised him not to set deadlines for his acting career and to fully commit if he loved it.\n\nGlenn's father, who came from poverty, valued the help he received from charities like the Salvation Army and left his former lifestyle to sell tools after meeting Scott's mother.\n\nScott's mother, who also grew up in poverty, was a loving and physically artistic person who had access to ballet lessons through a wealthy aunt.\n\nScott's parents had a functional and loving family, and he was raised with unconditional love, although his father once hit him for making his mother cry, demonstrating the importance of respecting and listening to his parents.\n\nConverting to Judaism.\n\nScott Glenn converted to Judaism in preparation for his marriage to Carol.\n\nHis friend, Rabbi Milton Badle, initially hesitated to perform the conversion due to his conservative beliefs and doubts about Glenn's knowledge of Judaism.\n\nGlenn explained that his motivation for converting was to protect Carol from potential anti-Semitism during their travels.\n\nRabbi Badle was impressed by Glenn's sincerity and agreed to convert him.\n\nGlenn underwent a conversion process while simultaneously performing in an Off-Broadway play.\n\nRabbi Badle provided guidance and direction during the conversion process, acting as a mentor and director.\n\nGlenn's Jewish name after the conversion is Abraham Ephraim Ben Abraham.\n\nLao Tzu: the ultimate mystic?\n\nScott Glenn finds Lao Tzu's writings resonate with him as an honest description of inner and outer truth.\n\nHe believes that the mystical side of religion is the practical side, while orthodoxy is the impractical side.\n\nOrthodoxy is under fire and diminishing because it is not practical and does not stand up to scientific scrutiny.\n\nMysticism tries to dissolve the ego altogether, while orthodoxy tries to preserve the ego.\n\nGlenn believes that there is something in him that will continue after he dies, but he does not believe that he as an individual will continue.\n\n“Crazy Whitefella Thinking.”\n\nScott Glenn was offered a regular role in the final season of \"The Leftovers,\" which included a challenging seven-page monologue.\n\nTo memorize the monologue, Glenn applied positive reinforcement techniques he learned from the book \"Don't Shoot the Dog,\" starting from the end and gradually working his way through.\n\nDuring filming, director Mimi Leder suggested that Glenn have a part of himself watch his performance to allow for more direction, which he initially resisted but eventually agreed to try.\n\nGlenn's approach to staying fit at 85 includes waking up early and looking in the mirror to remind himself to stay out of the way and let things happen naturally, avoiding editorial decisions or trying to force big moments.\n\nGlenn's manager advised him to avoid seeking external validation, such as Emmy or Oscar awards, and to stay focused on his craft.\n\nGetting out of the way and Erwan Le Corre.\n\nScott Glenn talks about his experience working with Vince Vaughn on the set of \"Bad Monkey\".\n\nVince Vaughn suggested they improvise a scene instead of following the script, which Glenn found refreshing and liberating.\n\nGlenn realized that he shouldn't edit himself or the character he was playing and that the best performances come from spontaneity.\n\nGlenn discusses his approach to staying fit at 85 years old.\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of staying active and moving your body regularly.\n\nGlenn also mentions the benefits of eating a healthy diet and getting enough sleep.\n\nHe believes that staying fit is essential for maintaining a high quality of life as you age.\n\nLessons from the “morally phenomenal” Marlon Brando.\n\nMarlon Brando supported two villages in the Philippines with his pay and kept it a secret.\n\nBrando taught Scott Glenn that acting is not about squeezing something out of a moment, but seeing what the moment presents.\n\nThere are two basic schools of acting: the Russian school (Stanislavski) which focuses on the character's internal emotions, and the RADA technique which focuses on external characteristics.\n\nBrando used a mix of techniques, sometimes using a mirror to create an expression, other times using audio recordings to help him improvise.\n\nBrando believed that the little girl who was dancing freely had more potential to be a great actress than the one who was hiding behind her mother's dress, as she didn't need permission to express herself.\n\nHow Scott’s childhood bout with scarlet fever informed his life’s course.\n\nScott Glenn had scarlet fever as a child, which damaged his auditory nerves and left him with hearing loss.\n\nAs a result of his hearing loss, Scott developed the ability to read lips.\n\nScarlet fever also led Scott to discover his love for physical activity and sports.\n\nScott believes that his experience with scarlet fever shaped his life and led him to become an actor.\n\nScott Glenn maintains his fitness by following a regular workout routine.\n\nHis routine includes cardio, strength training, and stretching.\n\nScott also emphasizes the importance of a healthy diet and adequate sleep.\n\nHe believes that staying fit is essential for maintaining his health and well-being.\n\nDaily routines and exercises of an in-shape 85-year-old.\n\nScott Glenn, an 85-year-old legendary actor, follows a unique fitness routine to stay active and fit.\n\nHis morning routine includes physical exercises like ear massages, horizontal breathing, head tapping, humming, and \"baby fit\" movements.\n\nGlenn incorporates functional movements and exercises that are easy on his joints and tendons, such as bear crawls, kettlebell swings, push-ups, and resistance band exercises.\n\nHe emphasizes the importance of recovery and rest, focusing on breathing and meditation, particularly on the diaphragm, which he believes is the most important muscle.\n\nGlenn learned about the significance of breathwork from natural movement expert Irun Lur and practices six breath holds, each with increasing difficulty and diminishing rest periods, three times a week.\n\nHe meditates on peace, clarity, and focus during his breath holds, which have helped improve his physical and mental well-being.\n\nGlenn aims to achieve a two-minute breath hold by the time he turns 86, currently at a minute and 40 seconds.\n\nSecuring a serendipitous skill set.\n\nScott Glenn credits his success to unexpected opportunities that arose throughout his life.\n\nDespite not considering himself exceptionally intelligent, he excels as a firearms instructor due to extensive experience rather than natural talent.\n\nGlenn's acting career took off when he accidentally joined the Actors Studio and received exceptional training from renowned acting coach Lee Strasberg.\n\nHe gained valuable skills in combat shooting from experts like Scotty Reeds and scuba diving from legendary diver James Stewart, both encounters happening by chance.\n\nGlenn's interest in skydiving led him to meet a four-time world champion who offered to teach him freefalling techniques.\n\nThailand talk.\n\nScott Glenn is going to Thailand to film a TV show called White Lotus.\n\nHe wants to learn the basics of Krabi Krabong, a Thai martial art.\n\nHe plans to visit Lumpini Stadium or Rajadamnern Stadium to watch Muay Thai fights.\n\nHe recalls filming a movie in Thailand called Off Limits and losing filming locations due to the King's 60th birthday celebration.\n\nTwo of his friends who were in the movie, Gregory Hines and Fred Ward, have passed away.\n\nFred Ward was an accomplished athlete and trained Muay Thai with Scott Glenn in Thailand.\n\nScott Glenn had adventures in Thailand and saw a lot of Muay Thai.\n\nIncreasing surface luck.\n\nThere are different degrees of luck, some of which are outside of our control.\n\nOne way to increase the surface area for luck to stick is by being a good student.\n\nScott Glenn suggests not arguing with a Jewish girl from Brooklyn, as they will win and lead you in a better direction.\n\nHow Scott met and fell in love with
