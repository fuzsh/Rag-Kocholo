During this time, he played the character Stick on the Marvel Comics series \"Daredevil\" and \"The Defenders,\" both of which were created for Netflix. Later, in 2018, Glenn had a recurring role as retired sheriff Alan Pangborn in the first season of the Hulu psychological horror series \"Castle Rock.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nIn 1968, Glenn married Carol Schwartz.
