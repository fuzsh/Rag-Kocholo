        "text": "Scott Glenn (born January 26, 1938-1942) in an American actor. He portrayed the Wise Man in Sucker Punch. Zack Snyder also had Glenn in mind for Dave Bautista's role in Army of the Dead, Scott Ward, who was named for Glenn. When Snyder pitched 300 to Warner Bros., he presented them with an animated version of the original comic, narrated by Glenn.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn Theodore Scott Glenn on January 26 between the years of 1938 and 1942, in Pittsburgh to Theodore and Elizabeth Glenn, young Scott was raised with sisters Bonnie and Terry Glenn in Appalachia. He was a sickly child who spent a lot of time bedridden, but all those illnesses afforded him time to read and dream. He undertook rigorous physical training to improve his health. He later said he once wanted to be a poet like Lord Byron, and enrolled in the College of William and Mary as an English major.\n\nHe spent three years in the Marines, and later tried to be a crime reporter in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and then a novelist, but confessed to \"problems with dialogs.\" Frustrated, he turned to studying acting in New York at the George Morrison acting class, where he directed student plays. He then joined the prestigious The Actors Studio and began getting theater and TV jobs. In 1970, he landed his first movie work, when Jeff Bridges himself offered Scott a part in The Baby Maker.\n\nMoving to Los Angeles, Scott became frustrated looking for interesting roles, and called his first seven years on the West Coast the \"most miserable years of my life.\" At one point, he tired of the Hollywood lifestyle and moved to Ketchum, Idaho, where he spent two years doing odd jobs before returning to Los Angeles. Scott was cast as Clay, the leader of the biker gang in the 2008 FX series Sons of Anarchy, but was replaced by Ron Perlman after the pilot episode was shot.\n\nScott has been married to Carol Schwartz since 1967. They have two daughters, writer Dakota Glenn and actress Rio Glenn. He starred in the 1998 film Larga Distancia, which was written by his daughter, Dakota. He and Laurence Fishburne each played the role of Special Agent Jack Crawford in works based on Hannibal Lecter, Glenn playing opposite Anthony Hopkins' Lecter.\n\nRoles[]\n\nCruel & Unusual Films roles[]\n\nSelection of other roles[]\n\nExpand!\n\nThis section is incomplete."
