        "text": "The cast of Castle Rock is starting to fill out. According to THR, Daredevil actor Scott Glenn has joined the cast of the Hulu series. He will be a series regular and take on the role of Alan Pangborn, \"a retired sheriff who presided over some of the darkest years in Castle Rock's checkered history.\"\n\nIf you're familiar with Stephen King's novels, you might recognize that Sheriff Panghorn also appears in stories such as Needful Things and The Dark Half. The character was previously portrayed by Ed Harris in the feature film adaptation of Needful Things.\n\nGlenn joins the previously announced cast, which includes Andre Holland (Moonlight), Sissy Spacek, Melanie Lynskey, Jane Levy, and Bill Skarsgard.\n\nCastle Rock is a 10-episode series described as \"an anthology that weaves together characters and themes from King's novels, featuring the mysterious town of Castle Rock. The psychological horror series combines the mythological scale and intimate character storytelling of King's works, weaving a saga of darkness and light, played out on a few square miles of Maine woodland.\""
