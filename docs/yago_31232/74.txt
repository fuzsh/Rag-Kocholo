Biography

Do not merge this profile with Sigrid Storrada. They are different people

Note: Swietoslawa, perhaps identical to the legendary Sigrid the Haughty (b. 968/72 - d. ca. 1016), perhaps married firstly with Eric the Victorious, King of Sweden and later wife of Sweyn Forkbeard, King of Denmark by whom she is said to have been mother of Canute the Great, King of Denmark, Norway and England.

There is an hypothesis that states the existence of another daughter of Mieszko I who was married with a Pomeranian Slavic Prince; she could be the daughter of either Dobrawa or one of his previous pagan wives.[12] Also, exist the theory (apparently recorded by Thietmar and supported by Oswald Balzer in 1895) that Vladivoj, who ruled as Duke of Bohemia during 1002-1003, was another son of Dobrawa and Mieszko I;[1] although modern historians rejected this hypothesis, the Bohemian historiography still supported the Piast parentage of Vladivoj.

Medieval Lands

ŚWIĘTOSŁAWA (soon after 967-). This is one of the possibilities for the origin of the first wife of Svend I King of Denmark, based solely on Thietmar who refers to the mother of "filiis Suenni" as "Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successori eius". Europäische Stammtafeln names her "Šwiętosława [Gunhild] of Poland", although there is no indication of the basis for this suggested Polish name, and states that she married firstly Erik "Segersäll/the Victorious" King of Sweden, as his second wife. This latter suggestion is implausible as it would mean that both of King Erik's wives were in turn married to Svend King of Denmark, numerous primary sources attesting that the latter's second wife Sigrid "Storråda/the Haughty" was the widow of King Erik. m ([988/90]) as his first wife, SVEND I "Tveskæg/Forkbeard" King of Denmark, son of HARALD I "Blåtand/Bluetooth" King of Denmark & his first wife Gunhild ([960]-Gainsborough 3 Feb 1014, bur in England, later removed to Roskilde).
