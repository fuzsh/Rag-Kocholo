        "text": "February 18, 2021\n\nCaught between a three star and four and rounded up. I read across all genres, I will read any fiction and nonfiction if its well written. And still my favorite books of all time are historical; Lonesome Dove, Pillars of the Earth, River God, Shogun, Centennial, and Youngblood Hawk. This book could easily be five stars. The story is well drawn. The first chapters establish the characters and set up the political landscape of the time, excellent conflict, conflict at every turn. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who loves true history. For me this book cuts a little to close to history verses fiction. I prefer to be dropped into the fictive dream and held there. This book jumps around and each time the author has to start a new chapter it feels like a new segment without a solid enough link to the previous. The link is there but for me it should be stronger. I'm not sure I'm a big fan of footnotes in fiction books.\n\nInteresting time in history and the author does a marvelous job capturing it.\n\nFebruary 22, 2021\n\nTo be bold shows courage, but it also requires calculating risk. The Widow Queen offers both, wrapped in an ethereal, atmospheric blanket of history and what reminds me of a bit of magic. Our heroine appears as a teenager over 1,000 years ago in Poland. She's the sister of the heir to the throne, but with Europe and Asia at war on multiple levels, alliances are the most critical way to ensure your future. Swietoslawa has a brother, as well as two half-sisters and probably other siblings. Depending on where you are in Poland, or the greater continent, different heirs are recognized or prized. Who will marry whom? Which countries can you trust? Through the darkness of war and revenge, these siblings play a few games with emotions and power, ending up in places they might not have expected.\n\nI enjoyed this book, but it is definitely a bit more complex than I expected. Thankfully I'm a fan of genealogy, so I mostly kept track of relationships; however, the one area I felt a bit lost on was the actual map of Europe at the time. It was difficult to know which countries existed in which shape and size, and when thinking about alliances and areas at war, I often wondered why it was so important. After stopping to research the true history, I decided to let it go and pretend I knew nothing. The beauty of the story is there, and I found myself rooting for several of the families to gain different thrones... Sven and his father for example-quite a story. I still wish I had a bit more narrative on the lay of the land at the time. It's a lot to take in at once, but it is equally well balanced by a magical writing style.\n\nIt reminded me of The Bear and the Nightingale by Katherine Arden crossed with the storytelling approach of Follett's Pillars of the Earth series. If you have an interest in Eastern Europe and the formation of powers in the 1,000 AD range, this offers a wonderful history lesson and romantic interlude of arranged marriages and the profits of a territory. Moments like the experience of watching someone take an ice bath to the joys and horrors of pregnancy are well described, easily showing the author's and translator's ability to set a scene. Different. Strong plot. Better with maps and character diagrams. A way to learn more about the past while wondering what one's birth period and ancestry truly means.\n\nCurrently reading\n\nJanuary 23, 2021\n\nI just found out I'll be getting an ARC of this and I am SO excited\n\nPolish GoT with a bad-ass queen??? I'm THERE\n\nMarch 28, 2021\n\nWow, there is a whole lot going on in this book. We have amazing amounts to Polish history, and as much as the story is appealing, the historical parts of the book really interested me. We have a story from the Middle Ages that takes us from Poland, to Denmark, to Sweden and Rus (Russia). It is about nobility, claiming a kingdom, alliances, and more. This was a best seller in Poland and is being released here in the US. The names are a bit tough because the author uses actual historical people in the book and does not change their names for reader simplicity. Having not read a lot about Polish history I was completely unaware of all of his and therefore I enjoyed learning and enjoying myself with this good read.\n\nThanks TorForge Books for this free advance copy in return for my honest review.\n\nMarch 15, 2021\n\nPoland, 984. Duke Mieszko I unites the lands, thus giving the birth to the first ruling dynasty of Poland namely Piast. His oldest son and heir, Boleslaw, wishes to continue his father’s legacy as the first ruler of a united Poland. His daughters are to seal a peace and alliances through marriages as daughters are meant to.\n\nWest of Poland. Sevn, the duke of Denmark is eager to take the rein of Denmark from his father as he sees his father unfit of ruling anymore. To prove his worth to his father, he needs to stand against the current ruler of Norway. And in doing so he needs help by new alliances. He asks Mieszko to marry Swietoslawa, but the pagan duke is refused.\n\nEast of Poland. Olav, an exiled heir of Norway, is being kindly hosted in the lands of Prince Vladimir of Rus, who wants Mieszko burned. However, alliances shift all the time. If you don’t tread the waters carefully, you may undercut your own throat. As Olav makes his way back to Norway to reclaim the Norwegian throne, he crashes at the Polish shores. And he needs alliances and a fleet to defeat those currently ruling over Norway.\n\nNorth of Poland. King Eric of Sweden offers an alliance with Mieszko by marrying his daughter – only Sweitoslawa, no other, as she is already a legend. “The one with hair like amber, eyes like a wildcat, and a tongue as sharp as a knife.” In exchange, the king of Sweden will attack Denmark and destroy the ring of enemies around western borders of Poland.\n\nSouth of Poland. Mieszko fights his old brother-in-law, the prince of Czechs.\n\nSwietoslawa’s husband is much older. And while still being alive, she is warned of his out of wedlock children. She needs to protect her son and what is rightfully his. There is never too early to start scheming.\n\nThis story alternates mainly among six characters, four children of Mieszko and Sven of Denmark and Olav of Norway.\n\nIt is very rich in the cast of historical figures and historical events, including Christian and pagan customs, and calculated alliances where feelings have no place. If there is no gain in remaining in an alliance, then what’s the point of staying in one?\n\nVividly imagined novel with ruthless historical figures shaping the map of the 10th century Europe.\n\n4 stars: I found the second half of the story having a bit slower pace than the first half.\n\nSource: ARC was provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.\n\nReview originally posted at mysteryandsuspense.com\n\nWant to read\n\nMarch 10, 2021\n\nfinally, someone heard my prayers for more translated novels\n\nthank you to the publisher for kindly sending me a review copy! <3\n\nJune 14, 2021\n\nSet mainly in Poland, Denmark, and Sweden from about 984 to 997 AD, The Widow Queen is the story of Swietoslawa, daughter of Duke Mieszko I of Poland, whose lands are constantly under siege. Mieszko is a schemer, and he plans to promise his children in marriage, including Swietoslawa, in order to form alliances. Promises are either kept or broken, depending on what is best for Mieszko. Swietoslawa secretly wants to rule on her own but knows marriage is inevitable. She soon begins to live up to her name, which means “the bold one.” All of the players in Mieszko’s game are present in this book—Swietoslawa, her brother Boleslaw, their sisters, and all the suitors, wives, lovers, and husbands. Mieszko’s formidable wife at the time, Oda, is a threatening presence, constantly scheming to take Poland for her own sons. This the first book in The Bold series.\n\nThis is an interesting read. I learned a lot about the rulers and politics of Poland, Denmark, and Sweden at that time. Swietoslawa is either a real person, a legend, or a combination of the two, who may have been married to Eric the Victorious of Sweden and Sweyn (or Sven) Forked Beard of Denmark. She also may have been known as Sigrid Storrada. In The Widow Queen, the author combines legend with fact and fiction to share a tale of war, betrayal, love, hate, and revenge, as thrones change hands, and blood flows in constant quests for power.\n\nThis book would have benefited from a cast of characters in the front, as there are many players from different countries and many names to remember. However, I felt instantly transported and learned so much about this time period. Fans of 10th-century historical fiction will enjoy this entertaining but bloody tale.\n\nI received a free copy of this book from Tor/Forge for Historical Novels Review Magazine. My review is voluntary and my opinions are my own.\n\nMarch 30, 2021\n\n\"They say that a man should have many sons, but I say that there can never be enough daughters. Women multiply happiness, while sons-in-law are the strength of their father-in-law, and I don't need to worry about how to divide my lands between them because they themselves are adding to my victories.\"\n\nThe sweeping historical fiction saga is not a genre I read frequently, though I have enjoyed the ones I've read in the past. There's just something a little intimidating about a book with over 500 pages, a family tree, AND maps, so I put off starting this book for quite a while. And, now I have no idea why - it was an absorbing, thrilling read. I really didn't want it to end.\n\nIn Swietoslawa's world, marriages are not romantic unions but carefully planned alliances. And, her father is in charge of the planning.\n\n\"Imagine your father, then, but don't regret not knowing him. Ours rules us as if we were an extension of the arms he uses to play his games.\"\n\nEach of his daughters will be married to a man who will better his empire . . . what's love got to do with that?\n\nA wickedly delicious tale of intrigue and peril, based on the life of a real Polish queen. Highly recommended to fans of Bernard Cornwell, Hilary Mantel, and Karen Maitland.\n\n\"The game of royals is not without its losses. Your father would say that no alliance tasted of mead. The better the agreement, the bitterer the taste.\"\n\nMany thanks to Lizzy at Tor/Forge for the advance reading copy.\n\nSeptember 1, 2020\n\nThe Widow Queen is an uniquely written, superb, historical fiction masterpiece set in the time period from 984 A.D. - 997 A.D. The fascinating yarn it weaves, grabs hold of you from the beginning to the end.\n\nReminiscent of a \"literary game of chess\", the story centers around the Piast Dynasty. Duke Mieszko of Poland is a ruthless leader, who seeks to expand Poland's borders through cunning, strength and his children. He's a supreme strategist, and will do whatever is necessary for the good of his growing empire, including arranging for marriage alliances between his children with whomever he chooses he feels will aid them to become the most mighty, respected, and dominating power, not only of his time, but for all time to come. He is a man who moves his pawns around always anticipating his opponents next step, and carefully grooms his children likewise in the roles they are commanded to play. Poland, Sweden, Germany, Norway, Denmark, for now, but the vision is growth that knows no boundaries beyond the horizons!\n\nWith a full spectrum of actions and emotions portrayed, the characters are dynamic and memorable.. There is betrayal, murder, lies, unrequited love, disgust, repugnance and brutality. There are births, deaths, the purity and taint of both Christianity and Pagondom with division, and at times the mixture of both. Arising at the center of this epic novel, is Swietoslawa, the Bold One, Mieszko's favorite daughter with intelligence, and her very presence that commands respect, because she indeed has proven herself to be the Bold One, yes, sometimes as being too bold. The reader is left with wanting more, and the author promises there is so much more to learn and be had! With that said, I can hardly wait for the next offering, \"The Last Crown\" to become available.\n\nMy thanks to NetGalley and the Publisher for an advanced uncorrected copy in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.\n\nMarch 28, 2021\n\nWhat a great read!\n\nIt's going to be a short review as I'm planning to post something much longer after I finish book 2 of Harda, Królowa, and thereby the whole duology.\n\nI must tell you this, however, if the earliest history of my country had been shown to us, Poles, in this way - even fictionalised and embellished - we would have remembered it all much, much better and, what's more important, we would have BEEN INTERESTED in it from the start!!!\n\nIt's not fantasy, don't make some descriptions/reviews or people's shelving of this book fool you.\n\nBut it's an epic story about the 10th-century Poland and its Piast dynasty rising in the arena of European politics.\n\nIf you can get your hands on the English translation, do not hesitate! :)\n\nJuly 4, 2021\n\nRead through page 350 out of 496. I very rarely abandon books this late in the game, but beginning somewhere around 200 pages in I’ve been reading more to be done with it and able to move on to another book than for interest in the plot or characters, and life is too short to turn what’s meant to be enjoyment into an obligation. That said, I don’t think this is an objectively badly written book; it just didn’t catch my interest or make me care.\n\nThis book reminds me a bit of Hild, in that both are somewhat densely-written, heavily-researched books featuring the imagined lives of real medieval women (though whether Swietoslawa, this book’s nominal protagonist, actually existed or was the same person as Sigrid Storrada—or whether she actually existed—seems to be up for debate), and including complicated intrigues with lots of players. In a sense The Widow Queen is easier to read than Hild, as it never gets bogged down in the research, and I had a fairly easy time following the wars and intrigues once I had all the players down.\n\nUnfortunately, once I was no longer having to work to understand the story (which I don’t necessarily object to since it provides intellectual engagement), I realized I didn’t care about anyone in it or find any of them interesting. There are many point-of-view characters, most of them male leaders around Swietoslawa, none of whom are very distinct from each other or particularly sympathetic, laser-focused as they are on conquering or plundering territories, without thought to anything other than their own desire to rule. Unfortunately Swietoslawa herself isn’t much better; she’s an extremely privileged young woman and makes the most of her power with little to no thought for anyone else. Which is probably realistic, but it’s not a complex or critical portrayal; I had the sense we were supposed to find her “boldness” endearing, and I didn’t. First because by “bold” we mostly mean “mouthy,” which is the default heroine behavior in historical and fantasy settings these days, so whatever. And second because this is fairly blatant “but women too should have the opportunity to exploit others!” feminism. The only character to remotely interest me is the witchy half-sister Astrid, but the author lost much of my goodwill there by having all three sisters fall in love with the same man (even though two of them barely know him).\n\nThere is something to the Game of Thrones comparisons, the book has a lot of intrigue and unprincipled leaders and HBO-style sex (though the battles so far are all off-page), and there’s also a lot of dialogue so it is fairly readable. But as the story follows its characters through about 15 years of their lives, there’s no driving plot, and knowing this book too ends on a cliffhanger (so I wouldn’t get a real ending even if I finished) gave me the push I needed to set it aside for something more enjoyable.\n\nOctober 19, 2020\n\nReally well written story about the Polish Queen. It reminded me slightly of a Viking version of Game of Thrones..\n\nI enjoyed the strength of the main character and following the story of her families rise to power. Translations are often difficult as you can often still tell it is a translation afterwards, but this one didn't really suffer from any of that. It took me a bit for me to find its footing, but once it did I really enjoyed it.\n\nI'd totally keep reading this series and hope they translate the rest.\n\nApril 2, 2024\n\n4.5 Stars\n\nI put off reading this one for quite awhile. It was long and I wasn't quite sure it would be my type of read. When I finally picked it up, I still wasn't sure this would be for me. Lots of characters thrown at you and with names like Swietoslawa, I had a hard time keeping them straight. Normally, I would just put the book down and try later or just decide it was not for me. Yet, the writing was done so well, I wanted to stick to this one. So I did. What I got was a wonderful, intriguing story that played out like a political game of chess. It didn't need to be overly brutal or have lots of action because the richness of the story itself was enough. Looking forward to more of the story in book two.\n\nMarch 15, 2021\n\nThe Widow Queen is being compared to the novels of Phillipa Gregory and Bernard Cornwell. Since I have enjoyed several novels by each, I was excited to give this a try. Unfortunately, The Widow Queen lacks the intellectual wit and enjoyable readability that I find in Gregory's and Cornwell's stories. I tried with this novel. I read the first 200 pages and then skimmed the last 300. I found the writing to be convoluted and staid. I couldn't believe it when I came to the end. It finishes with a cliffhanger and an author's note letting you know that the second volume entitled The Last Crown will be released next year. If the second book is as long as the first, you are looking at over 1000 pages. I could therefore only recommend this book to someone extremely interested in medieval Polish history but even then this reads more as a romanticized version than a factual history tome.\n\nJanuary 16, 2023\n\n19 CDs\n\nI listened to the unabridged audiobook THE WIDOW QUEEN written by Elzbieta Cherezinska, translated by Maya Zakrzewska-Pim and read by Cassandra Campbell.\n\nSwietoslawa was called the \"Bold One\". To her father, the great Duke of Poland, Swietoslawa and her two sisters represent three chances for an alliance. Three marriages on which to build his empire.\n\nBut Swietoslawa refuses to be simply a pawn in her father's schemes; she seeks a throne of her own, with no husband by her side. The gods may grant her wish, but crowns sit heavy, and the power is a sword that cuts both ways.\n\n4 stars ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nApril 7, 2021\n\nBeautifully written about a period that I don't know anything about. I loved learning about the people and places! Incredible! I was sad to be nearing the end, and read the second book The Last Crown will be out soon, it cannot be soon enough for me!

Historical fiction, magical realism. Mature content (graphic violence and sexuality), recommended for readers ages 18+. The Widow Queen by Elżbieta Cherezińska (translated from the original Polish into English by Maya Zakrzewska-Pim) marks the beginning of a new epic historical fiction series with a touch of magic. A multi-generational saga, it pulls the reader through over four-hundred pages of intrigue, malice, revenge, desire and, on occasion, love. I feel a little like The Grandfather from The Princess Bride film, to be honest, so try to stay awake because this book has more sports in it than an ESPN infomercial– and SO MUCH MORE.\n\nInspired by historical figures, The Widow Queen most closely follows Świętosława (pronunciation varies but the book suggests Sven-to-swava), the youngest daughter of the Polish Duke Mieszko I, born of the Duchess Dobrawa, circa 970 AD. Duke Mieszko has dedicated his life to aggressively expanding Poland’s borders and with it his family’s power. Strategy is his primary concern, and his children represent tools through which the dynasty can be strengthened. Bolesław (pronounced Bole-swav), Mieszko’s eldest son, is placed on a trajectory from birth to inherit his father’s title, while Świętosława exists to marry a monarch and birth heirs, thereby uniting kingdoms– with the understanding that Poland will always come out ahead, of course.\n\nContrary to tradition, Świętosława has her own lofty ambitions, aspiring to be a young widow queen and grasping the reins of an entire country. While women’s intrigue is portrayed as by no means unusual, the princess has a tendency to shock those around her, even other power-hungry women, with her extraordinary boldness and determination. Świętosława doesn’t want to play by a separate set of women’s rules, and she craves respect and acknowledgment of power in her own right, of the kind that she observes men throwing to each other like coins. While she meets with a certain amount of success in shaping her future and reputation, Świętosława’s relationship with her own goals becomes increasingly complicated. She wonders if one can live a transactional life and ever find happiness, or if tragedy and disappointment will haunt every joy she manages to find.\n\nA particularly interesting aspect of the book that the author returns to time and again is the concept of religious rhetoric as political weapon. Duke Mieszko has without qualms furthered his power by allying himself with the Holy Roman Empire, quietly removing all overt traces of Poland’s Pagan traditions and replacing them with Christian priests, services, and houses of worship. Pressures increase across Europe for individuals to convert to Christianity; some respond enthusiastically while others only accept baptism at the point of a sword. New divisions and unexpected alliances spring up, denoting a quickly shifting hierarchy with the Empress Theophanu rising ever closer to the top.\n\nThe cultural significance of a transition from a pantheon of gods to a monotheistic religion firmly entrenched in the concept of the divine right of kings is not lost on Duke Mieszko either. As he tells young Świętosława and Bolesław, “Your mother and her religion were a revelation for me… Now, the people believe only God can anoint a leader. Not factions or priests or the people… Not the gods of fire, sun, water, war, peace, life, death, harvest, different ones for each tribe. The one God. One Lord and one ruler. Him and me. Since the day of my baptism, God has given me the right to rule… I’m a predator, but I don’t hunt alone” (pages 65-66).\n\nI’m very excited to continue this saga in 2022 with the next book in The Bold series (drop date and title tba). Don’t be deceived by the seemingly simple premise– the execution is sophisticated and nuanced, and the cast of characters is complex, fascinating and horrifying in turns.\n\nOriginally posted on TinyBookFort.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nJuly 25, 2018\n\nBernard Cornwell has some serious competition coming from this Polish author of historical fiction. I cannot wait for Tor to publish the English translation of this series, but alas, 2021 is still so far away. For those familiar with English history of the late 10th century, this story tells of the side of Europe Western history books tend to ignore. I imagine once translated, Ms. Cherezińska's books will stir some controversy - a Polish Princess mother to not one but two kings? And one of them a Viking king of England? Love it. I feared that this would read like a romance novel set in a historical past (read Outlander), but this is historical fiction at its finest.\n\nŚwietosława (Sigrid, for those of a more delicate tongue) does not feel like the forced trope of the \"strong female character.\" Cherezińska shows a woman of strength that is true to the period and not to modern sensibilities or politics. Świętosława is not some anachronistic feminist a la Lagertha from Vikings, but a smart, stubborn, Eastern European woman who understood when to know her place and when to challenge it.\n\nTo be fair, this is not her story alone. Harda, tells also the story of the beginning of what will become the kingdom of Poland: Mieszko I (Świetosława's father) and the Christening of Poland, Bolesław Chrobry (Swiętosława's brother) the first king of Poland.\n\nI also appreciate Cherezińska's evenhanded approach to the religions of the period: Christianity and paganism. One religion is not shown as being better or worst than the other. She simply shows them as they were, warts and all. So, unlike other series, we see the Norse pagans practicing human sacrifice and participating actively in the Baltic slave trade. No over-romanticization here.\n\nWriting this review on my phone is an exercise in futility... edits to come.\n\nOd lat czytam i uwielbiam Cornwella opowieści i jeżeli rozchodzi się o książkach historyczno fabularnych, on dla mnie zawsze był wzorem. Kilka lat temu jak wróciłam do Polski na festiwal Słowian i Wikingów w Wolinie, dopadła mi ulotka właśnie ogłaszając książkę Pani Cherezińskiej. Niestety nie miałam okazji kupić książkę ale trafiłam na audiobook. Cornwell ma konkurencję. Przyznaje że obawiałam się jakiegoś romansidła, ale Harda mnie zaskoczyła. Znając historię Anglii (nie tylko pasjonuje się ale też uczę o tych czasach), jako Polka naprawdę poczułam dumę, nie tylko historycznych postaci ale również Pani Cherezińskiej. Ostatnio wyczytałam że ten cykl książek ma być przetłumaczony na Angielski. Nie mogę się doczekać kiedy będę mogła podzielić się tą książką ze znajomymi.\n\nJanuary 21, 2018\n\nOstatni raz czytałam powieść Cherezińskiej na długim urlopie i chyba moją urlopową autorką pozostanie. Tym razem zupełnie nie planowałam tej lektury, ale stosikowe losowanie zadecydowało za mnie. I bardzo dobrze, bo opasłe tomiska na wakacje najlepiej się nadają. O ile po poprzednich książkach byłam fanką Cherezińskiej, to po Hardej mój entuzjazm nieco zmalał.\n\nTytułowa Harda to księżniczka Świętosława, córka Mieszka I, siostra Bolesława Chrobrego. Niewiele o niej wiemy, źródła są bardzo skąpe, więc przedstawienie jej życia w ogromnej wierze zależało od wyobraźni autorki. Cherezińska na pewno nie może narzekać na jej brak - ukazała bowiem w swojej powieści niezwykle wyraziste charaktery i to nie tylko Świętosławy, którą utożsamiła ze skandynawską królową Sigridą, ale i jej sióstr, brata oraz skandynawskich królów. Moim zdaniem w ostatniej kwestii autorka zbyt bardzo się rozdrobniła. Jej powieści przyświeca motto przedstawienia losów nieznanych księżniczek, ale w natłoku postaci niestety często one giną. Jest ich jednak tak wiele, że z powodzeniem wypełniłyby całą powieść. Poznajemy tu bliżej Odę, drugą żonę Mieszka, węgierską księżniczkę, która była pierwszą żoną Bolesława, Astrydę i Geirę nieślubne córki Mieszka, a przede wszystkim Świętosławę. Wszystkie te kobiety odgrywały ogromną strategiczną rolę, jako córki, które można było dobrze wydać za mąż, a potem jako żony - strażniczki sojuszów i zobowiązań i oczywiście matki synów. Mądre kobiety rozumiały tę rolę, porzucały własne marzenia i pracowały nad planami ojców i braci, a słabe kobiety po prostu cierpiały. Świętosława to postać silna, twarda, zdecydowana, która nie boi się zadawać pytań, która znanej tylko z imienia księżniczce nadaje charakteru i istotnej roli w ówczesnej polityce. To ona stojąc przy kurhanach zmarłych przodków pyta o ich żony i matki. Nie chce być pionkiem, chce odgrywać rolę na szachownicy polityków.\n\nCiąg dalszy: https://przeczytalamksiazke.blogspot....\n\nMay 8, 2023\n\nPoland. A.D. 960. Elzbieta Cherezinska’s The Widow Queen provides all with a look at Polish history, but illuminates a previously unknown princess, at least to this reader, named Świętoslawa (Sven-to-schwa-va). My thanks to the author through another character on the phonetic sounding of this Princess’s name. Also this reader does not have the correct ‘letter’ on her computer for the l in the Princess’s name. Thus the ‘l’ is not an ‘l’. The Piast Dynasty of Poland was placed on the two oldest children, Boleslaw, a male, and Świętoslawa, a younger female child, of Duke Mieszko I, their father whose marriage to a Czech princess, a Christian, enabled Poland to become Christian which was a major statement at that time. Many countries were proudly Pagan. When grown the Princess, also called the ‘bold one’, was married to King Eric of Sweden. Also at this time period Vikings were attacking England for war bootie. I know about these attacks on England when King Aethelred the Unready reigned. One attacker was Sven Forkbeard, future king of Denmark, who becomes the ‘Bold One’s second husband. She was never named in the books I read, but this author wants readers to know her story. The author is successful in this goal. The history of this daughter, sister, queen is fascinating. I look forward to the sequel, The Last Crown. 4 stars.\n\nMay 11, 2021\n\n2,75\n\nNiby była w porządku, ale jakoś mnie nie porwała. Rozumiem, że autorka miała ograniczone, przez historię, możliwości rozwoju fabuły, ale jedynym wątkiem który mnie interesował to był ten tytułowej Hardej. Dodatkowo sceny sexu, przywodziły mi na myśl typową literaturę dla pań. Ciężko mi pojąć, że napisała je kobieta. Szczególnie w momencie seksualizowania momentu po porodzie i karmienia piersią.\n\nDuży plus za wątek rysi i pomysł nazwania ich Wrzask i Zgrzyt by nikt oprócz słowniańskiej królowej nie mógł ich oswoić.\n\nNo i podobała mi się silna postać samej Świętosławy, która nie dawała ponieść się popędom i wybierała rozsądne decyzje.\n\nOgólnie pomysł na fabułę bardzo fajny, ale raczej nie sięgnę po drugą część\n\nOctober 22, 2023\n\n\"Harda\" to historia o której uczymy się na zajęciach w szkole - Mieszko I, książę z dynastii Piastów, decyduje wyrzec się starych bogów. Przyjmuje chrzest, bierze za żonę Dobrawę, a owocem małżeństwa są między innymi Bolesław Chrobry oraz (podobno, bo źródła historyczne są rozbieżne) Świętosława. Tutaj wiedza z reguły kończy się i poznajemy losy głównie Chrobrego. Autorka postanowiła skierować nasz wzrok na Świętosławę. Będąc księżniczką na pewno można liczyć na przywileje, ale i tak nie jest to los godny pozazdroszczenia. Wystarczy sam fakt, że dziewczyna na pewno weźmie udział w aranżowanym małżeństwie, gdzie nie wiadomo na kogo trafi. Świętosława wiedziała od samego początku, że jeśli chce coś osiągnąć to musi rozpychać się ramionami. Od małego była harda. Uczyła się pilnie, rozgryzała polityczne niuanse, realizowała plan rozwoju ojca, by spełnić swoje ambicje o zostaniu królową.\n\nTo moje drugie spotkanie z Cherezińską, więc doskonale wiedziałam czego się spodziewać jak również byłam od samego początku przekonana, że to będzie świetna powieść historyczna. Przeczucie mnie nie zawiodło. Tak samo jak wcześniej przeczytana przeze mnie \"Sydonia\", teraz historia Świętosławy jest napisana z olbrzymim rozmachem. Pojawia się mnóstwo wątków, bohaterów, zagadnień politycznych, walki o władzę oraz intryg. Mamy sporą dawkę historii o raczkującym państwie polskim oraz świetnie oddany klimat zimnych, niedostępnych, surowych krajów skandynawskich. Autorka doskonale sobie zdaje sprawę, że historia jest pisana głównie przez mężczyzn, bo oni wyjeżdżają na wojny czy zostają królami. Kobiety zwykle są pomijane, ponieważ to są matki, żony, córki i wydaje się, że nie mają jakiegoś istotnego wpływu. Nic bardziej mylnego. Okazuje się, że kobiety mają znaczący wpływ na dzieje historyczne, ponieważ to one popychają mężczyzn do niektórych decyzji. Elżbieta Cherezińska postanowiła to po prostu bardziej uwypuklić w swoich powieściach i wychodzi jej to w sposób rewelacyjny.\n\nPrzy okazji zaznajamiania się z tą książką audiobooku, zauważyłam pewne podobieństwo w prowadzeniu narracji. \"Sydonia\" charakteryzowała się tym, że była mowa o kobiecie twardo stąpającej po ziemi, ale jej losy nie były przedstawiane z jej perspektywy tylko ze strony innych osób. W \"Hardej\" mamy coś dosyć podobnego, ponieważ narracja prowadzona jest z wielu perspektyw, głównie męskich, a sama Świętosława oczywiście tym razem dostała swój segment, natomiast nie jest on tak potężny jak tytuł książki mógłby sugerować. Nie jest to oczywiście wadą, bo gdybyśmy ograniczali się tylko do jednej postaci to ta perspektywa i zbudowanie całego kontekstu byłoby dużo uboższe. Sama książka charakteryzuje się dużą szczegółowością, na którą warto zwracać uwagę, ponieważ pozwala ona na usystematyzowanie niektórych faktów, jak również sprawniejsze umiejscowienie niektórych wydarzeń na osi czasu. Poza tym nie od dziś wiadomo, że szczegóły mają znaczenie.\n\nTa książka to kolejny strzał w dziesiątkę. Zostawiam ocenę i wkrótce wezmę się za kolejną część.\n\nDecember 31, 2020\n\nI made a promise to myself to not only read books by more diverse authors, but also to read other genres besides my go-to mysteries/thrillers, horror, and science fiction. The Widow Queen is the story of Swietoslawa, a Polish queen, and this historical fiction definitely took me out of my comfort reading zone. At a little over 500 pages, this wasn't a book that I raced through, but rather one that I took my time with, especially since I initially had trouble with the vast quantity of characters.\n\nSo I put this down and approached this differently. I would read just one or two chapters before bed. That way, I made sure that I understood what was happening, and in the beginning, I probably read the same few chapters more than once. As soon as everything started to make sense to me, I started to appreciate the book and how little I knew about the Polish Piast dynasty. There was a lot of drama and intrigue, and I don't want to give anything away, but the ending implies that there must be at least another book.\n\nIt is a complicated story, but one I think would appeal to historical fiction fans. I am happy I gave this book a chance. 3.5 stars.\n\nJune 22, 2021\n\nThis was AMAZINGLY translated into English! I am absolutely shocked at the cleanliness of that.\n\nLoved the story!\n\nAugust 28, 2020\n\nFirst thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an advanced e-ARC copy of the book in exchange for my honest opinion.\n\nI love historical fiction - that is 95% of what I read and particularly those that are about the monarchy, all time periods and recently the Saxons and Vikings. I wanted very much to enjoy this book because of all the \"noise\" surrounding it. However, as hard as I tried I couldn't find myself engaged with it. I don't know if it has to do with the translation, because my husband is French and does translations and he says words/emotions don't always translate correctly - but that was my main problem with the book.\n\nI have to feel attached to at least one character to keep my interest and I couldn't. There was plenty of dialogue, which is a must for me. The basic story is good and that is why I gave it a 3 star rating because I was able to read it until the end.\n\nApril 5, 2021\n\n(Disclaimer: I received this book from Netgalley. This has not impacted my review which is unbiased and honest.)\n\nThe Widow Queen fascinated me with its promise to shed light on a previously forgotten queen. Women who exert power, who use their wiles and cunning, but who are never remembered. And with Cherezińska's dedication I was even more in love. In many ways, this project seems like a love letter to all the women forgotten by history, who history chooses to forget. For women who are used as marriage alliances, only seen for their potential heir providing services, and not given a say. They have to fight for whatever power, influence, and security they want.\n\nfull review: https://utopia-state-of-mind.com/revi..."
