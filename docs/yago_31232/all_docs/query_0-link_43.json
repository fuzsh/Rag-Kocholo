In spring the horns of the deer become red and for the ancient people these symbolized the rays of the sun. The deer was probably revered already in the paleolitic. In ancient Greece the deer was represented together with the goddess Artemid. Ancient people were convinced that the deer was hostile of the snakes and that it chased them. Since the beginnings Christianity assumed as really the symbol of the deer. This was made on the base of the second verse of the psalm 42 that it says: \"As the deer pants for the water brooks, so my soul pants after you, God\" These verse in which the deer represents the soul of the believer began a vast iconography in which we find one or two deers turned toward a course of water or a source of the life (fons vitae). Saint Augustine (354. 430) connected this representation with the baptism or with the desire of a believer to be baptized. The Physiologus affirms that the deer is an enemy of the dragon which hides him in the hollow of the earth. The deer finds it and vomits from its abdomen the water so that the dragon it goes out and the deer kills it. The dragon is the symbol of the devil, the deer is the symbol of Christ and the water the symbol of the word of God or the baptism. The deer can be also the symbol of Christ as the head of the flock. The deer has a good hearing that helps him to feel the enemy. The deer is also present in the Bible in Song of Solomon 2, 9: “My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look! There he stands behind our wall, gazing through the windows, peering through the windows.” This scene of love symbolized the deep love that God had toward his chosen people. Some Church Fathers interpreted these verses in different way and they saw in them the love that God had for the Church community. In the middle age the deer became the symbol of some saints among which Saint Procopius of Sazava and Saint Giles.\n\nOn the slovene medioeval coinage the deer appears relatively few time and we finds it represented only on seven typologically different coins listed in the attached chart. The numismatics that have studied these coins, have not analyzed this symbol except in the case of the coin on which the deer appears above the bridge of Zidani most.\n\nOn the coin listed in chart under the letter A on one side appear the eagle and on the other the deer. On both sides there are present legends thanks to which Luschin already attributed the coin to the mint of Kamnik and Kos it attributed more precisely to the carinthian duke Ulrik III. (+1268). This iconography is the same that we can find on a coin coined in the mint of Enns (B 124) by Frederick II, Duke of Austria (+1246) which was married to Agnes that was owner of the town of Kamnik. Perhaps this could make to suppose that this coin should be coined before supposed until now and could be attributed to Federick II instead that to Ulrik III.\n\nOn the reverse of the coins listed in chart with the letters B and C it is represented a bridge with above two towers and among them a head of deer above which there is a star or rose. Luschin had attributed the coin to the mint of Graz thinking that it was represented a city wall with towers. On suggestion of Montecuccoli, Baumgartner noticed that on this coin it is rapresented a bridge and that probably this was the bridge of Zidani most above which existed a church consecrate to Saint Giles. In 1222 the Austrian duke Leopold VI reconstructed an ancient Roman bridge that was found near the confluence of the river Savinja with the river Sava. The bridge was found in a strategic position on the road that connected the Stiria with the Croazia. The historian Andrej Gaspari has analyzed in detail the history of the bridge and thank to this coin he understood how was it built. Gaspari reported to Baumgartner, Firtsch and Pogačnik sustaining that the head of the deer represented above the bridge refers to the church consacrated to Saint Giles that was built near the bridge. According to Fritsch the symbol of Saint Giles was the hind but in the middle age was possible the confusion beetween this two animals. Baumgartner and other numismatics supposed, that this coin was minted in one of the mint of Dolejska probably in Brežice.\n\nOn the obverse of the coin listed in the chart with the letter Č and attributed to the mint of Kostanjevica there is a deer turned on the left, but with the head it turns back. On the reverse is a bust of the duke or the saint among two bell tower. Luschin has noticed the similarity of this coin with one coined in the mint of Enns.\n\nThe coin listed in the chart with the letter D is particular because minted in the style of bracteates. On this coin is engraved a deer turned to ghe left. The coin was probably minted in the mint of Völkermark in Carinthia. Koch has established the period of mintage of this coin among the years 1270 and 1295. A series of bracteates has been faund in Stari Grad pri Kostanjevici. Among these it was present also one with the crowned lion that is the typical coat of arms of the Bohemia. It seems therefore that this type of coinage has been introduced by us by the Czech king Otokar II. Premysl (+ 1278). This type of coins was probably coined after 1270 when the king Otokar II. it occupied both the Carinzia and the Carniolia and it probably used the working mints in these regions. The deer was also the symbol of one of the principal patrons of the Boemia Saint Procopius of Sazava (+1053).\n\nThe motives that brought to the representation of the deer on the medieval Slovene coinage are not clear entirely. Also as it regards to the coin with the bridge of Zidani most there are some doubt if the deer is really the symbol of Saint Giles that he is generally represented with a hind. Even more difficult it is to understand the motive for the representation of the deer on the coin attributed to Otokar II. Exist some Czech coins on which a deer is represented but we don-t know if this is the symbol of Saint Procopius. Perhaps who coined wanted to use the deer as Christological symbol, or the symbol of the believer that it looks for God as described in the psalm 42. We also remember that Saint Giles is one of the patrons of Charintia and therefore the deer on the coin of Völkermarkt could refer to this saint. We cannot even exclude that the deer was a heraldic symbol of which we don't know the meaning. The deer is the symbol of the king of the animals of the forest and is also the symbol of the good actions and the struggle against the snake and the dragon or of the evil. In this case it could represent the idealization of the Christian king.\n\nThe beginnings of Christianity in the Czech lands are associated with the spread of the Frankish Empire’s cultural and power influence, but soon also domestic elites contributed to the development of the ecclesiastical organization.

The dukes and magnates did not hesitate to support the construction of new cloisters and churches, but it is not possible to observe the dimensions of this process. An important milestone was the establishment of a bishopric in Prague in 976 and the subsequent restoration of the bishopric in Moravia (perhaps permanently from 1063), which gave the church in the Přemyslid lands a more solid organizational framework, which depended not only on the growing network of castles but apparently also on “rural” churches, the role of which has not yet been firmly profiled. Those that had an archpriest at their head undoubtedly had a more significant position. Unfortunately, they are mentioned only once in Cosmas’s Chronicle, which attributed to them the role of co-workers of the castle administrators.\n\nThe picture of the beginnings of archdeacons is more clear, which we date roughly to the middle of the twelfth century. “Parish churches” are first mentioned in 1100–1150, but while the baptismal and burial features of these churches are beyond doubt, the extent of the parishes’ boundaries didn’t have to be clearly defined and it is impossible to rule out a reciprocal hierarchy among different churches with the same functions.\n\nThe dynamics of building cloisters (until 1140, eleven in 160 years, and then twenty-two in 65 years), however, clearly copies also the dynamic of building the network of rural churches (as well as society’s increasing literacy at that time). It is not appropriate to connect their emergence only with the regulations of the duke or bishop, who could have at the most played the role of a motivating element, but rather with the local elites, who tried to imitate the duke and support his efforts to claim allegiance to him. Although we usually look at the lowest level of the church organization through the lens of economic losses and gains, we should not overlook the fact that already in the Early Middle Ages strong pressure was evident on a certain independence of the priests and their ability to perform the tasks of shepherds properly."
