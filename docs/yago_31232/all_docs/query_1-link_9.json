        "text": "WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo\n\nOn January 11, 1386, JagieÅÅo was preelected to be king of Poland in WoÅkowysku. It was stipulated that he would marry Jadwiga. On February 2, 1386, The nobility assembled at Lublin and voted to make JagieÅÅo king. Poland and Lithuania were officially in a union. In historiography, there is debate if Lithuania maintained its sovereignty in a union with Poland or if it became a part of Poland. On February 15, 1386, JagieÅÅo and his brothers converted to Roman Catholicism in KrakoÌw. The Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights was invited to become the Godfather of JagieÅÅo, but he declined. Instead, WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk became his Godfather. JagieÅÅo took his name, WÅadysÅaw, as his baptismal name. JagieÅÅo's brother KorygieÅÅo took the baptismal name of Kazimierz and his other brother SÌwidrygieÅÅo took the baptismal name of BolesÅaw. On February 18, 1386, JagieÅÅo married Jadwiga. Jadwiga knew five languages, while WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was illiterate. It caused difficulties for the royal couple. They also had trouble conceiving an heir. Jadwiga was able to achieve the respect of Poles and Lithuanians as she matured. MikoÅaj TraÌ¨ba was sent to the Apostolic See and was able to get a document that nullified the marriage between Jadwiga and Wilhelm Habsburg. In 1387, the Habsburgs brought a case on the marriage in the Roman Curia, but it was dismissed. In 1388, Pope Urban VI recognized the marriage of WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Jadwiga. He also approved a new diocese in Vilnius.\n\nOn March 4, 1386, JagieÅÅo was coronated as WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. Jadwiga ruled as a joint king after WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was coronated. Her powers were not lessened, but she was only allowed to use them when she became an adult. On the day that WÅadysÅaw II was married to Jadwiga, he expanded the privilege of 1374 that was granted in Koszyce. More privileges were given on August 29, 1386, in KrakoÌw and on February 29, 1388, in PiotrkoÌw. He agreed to pay the ransom to free knights who were captured during an invasion. In 1387, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo gave Lithuanian boyars a privilege to inherit and pass down property. Some of their property was also exempt from taxes. Only Catholic boyars were given these privileges. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Jadwiga gave privileges to towns in Ruthenia, such as LwoÌw. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo gave Siemowit IV the Land of Belz in return for resigning from claims to the crown of Poland. Siemowit IV ended up marrying WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's sister, Aleksandra.\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian union produced a kingdom that was about 497,096 mi2 (800,000 km2) in size. Its existence balanced power with the Teutonic Knights state that was set on expansion. A negative aspect of the union was the fact that Hungary lost an ally in Poland and relations with the Germans and Czechs became tense. Polish merchants were granted access to a bigger market with the union that included the Black Sea.\n\nEvangelization of Lithuania was WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's first task as king of Poland. On February 17, 1387, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo granted a privilege for the new diocese in Vilnius on his first trip to Lithuania after being coronated. He gave it an estate composed of fifty to sixty villages. The diocese was exempt from taxes and it was given its own law. It was also given jurisdiction over the people on its lands. The first bishop of Vilnius was Andrzej. His coat of arms was JastrzeÌ¨biec. Seven parishes were first established. New churches were built in Vilnius and other towns. A few days later he gave the same privileges he gave to the diocese of Vilnius to the Catholic Church in all of Lithuania. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo tried to convert all Lithuanians. If someone resisted, he or she was forced to convert. Symbols of paganism in Lithuania were destroyed. Some pagan relics remained up until the 16th century. In 1387, Jadwiga went on a campaign to Red Ruthenia to remove Hungarians in power there and annex it to Poland. Hungary could not intervene, since it was in a succession crisis. Most of the Hungarians in Red Ruthenia gave up without a fight. Halych was the only area that resisted. Jan of TarnoÌw was made the first mayor in Red Ruthenia by Jadwiga after it was annexed. In autumn 1387, the hospodar of Moldovia, Peter, paid homage to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Jadwiga in LwoÌw. He swore fidelity to their successors before Moldavia was under Hungary's influence. In 1389, the hospodar of Wallachia, Mircza the Old, allied with Poland.\n\nIn 1387, the opposition to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was suppressed in Lithuania. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's brother, SkirgieÅÅo, defeated the Duke of PÅock, Andrzej, and imprisoned him. On April 28, 1387, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo gave the Duke of Trakai, SkirgieÅÅo, jurisdiction over the districts of Lithuania that were divided among the descendants of Jawnuta, Kiejstut, Koriat, Narymunt, and Olgierd. Vytautas the Great was a major problem for WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. Vytautas the Great was unhappy with the land he inherited. He wanted Trakai but would be satisfied if he received Lutsk and Volhynia that are in today's Ukraine. Vytautas the Great conspired with the Teutonic Knights. The Teutonic Knights would help get back the lands he wanted in return for giving them Grodno, Samogitia, and paying for the expenses of the war. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo went on a campaign and ended up conquering BrzesÌcÌ, Grodno, and Kamyanyets. In the summer of 1390, Vytautas the Great and the Teutonic Knights organized a large campaign against Lithuania. Henry Bolingbroke was at the head of the campaign. In 1399, he ended up becoming Henry IV, the king of England. His forces laid siege to Vilnius that was defended by Polish forces. The grand master of the Teutonic Knights along with WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's brother, KorygieÅÅo-Kazimierz, and Vytautas the Great's brother, TowciwiÅÅ-Konrad, died. The Teutonic Knights escaped. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo stationed Polish troops in Vilnius and gave the city arms for defense. In 1391, the new grand master of the Teutonic Knights, Konrad Wallenrod, attacked Lithuania. He was able to subdue WiÅkomierz and several other towns in Lithuania. When WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo sent troops into DobrzynÌ Land, where the Teutonic Knights had troops, Konrad Wallenrod pulled his troops out of Lithuania. Vytautas the Great was able to conquer Grodno and some other land that he claimed with the help of the Teutonic Knights. Samogitia remained as a possession of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nWÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo decided to make peace with Vytautas the Great, since he believed a victory could not be produced in the war. He sent the Duke of Mazovia, Henryk, to start secret negotiations with Vytautas the Great. Vytautas the Great agreed to end his alliance with the Teutonic Knights in exchange for getting the lands he demanded as his inheritance from his father. On August 4, 1392, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Vytautas the Great struck an agreement in OstroÌw. Vytautas the Great received control over the principality of Trakai and the ability to rule over all of Lithuania as WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's deputy. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's brother SkirgieÅÅo who held the position before was given the principality of Kiev for stepping down. Vytautas the Great's title was Dux Lithuaniae (âDuke of Lithuaniaâ).\n\nVytautas the Great had many troubles with the Teutonic Knights as the viceroy in Lithuania. They accused him of betrayal and attacked his lands. From 1392 to 1394, they attacked Lithuania six times. After 1394, they gave up their aspirations of conquering all of Lithuania and focused on controlling Samogitia. Vytautas the Great tried to centralize power in Lithuania by removing most of the dukes who had power in Lithuania and by taking direct control of Ruthenia. Vytautas the Great had ambitions of spreading eastward all the way to the Ural Mountains and Caspian Sea. Vytautas the Great may have had ambitions to become king. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo may have supported the idea, since he had no male sons. KrakoÌw's elite did not favor Vytautas the Great becoming independent. In 1398, Jadwiga tried to get Vytautas the Great to pay her yearly tributes that she was owed according to the marriage agreement she had with WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo, but Vytautas the Great denied her.\n\nIn October 1398, Vytautas the Great made peace with the Teutonic Knights on the island of Salina. He did it without Poland. Vytautas the Great let them have Samogitia and promised to help them conquer it. He also let them have Pskov in return for letting them not interfere in Veliky Novgorod. Lithuanian boyars declared Vytautas the Great king at Salina, but he did not coronate himself. Vytautas the Great also set forth plans at Salina to expand into the lands the Mongols controlled. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo agreed to send Polish troops to help him. Bishop Wojciech JastrzeÌ¨biec was able to get papal approval to start a crusade against the Mongols for Vytautas the Great. In 1399, Vytautas the Great was helped in his campaign by Marquard von Salzbach of the Teutonic Knights and Spytek of Melsztyn. On August 12, 1399, the Mongols won the Battle of the Vorskla River. Spytek of Melsztyn and WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's brothers, Andrzej and Dymitr, died. The project of uniting all of Ruthenia ended with the loss in the battle. It also weakened Lithuania's position internationally. At the end of 1400, talks were held in Grodno between Poles and Lithuanians to strengthen ties. On January 18, 1401, an agreement was struck at Vilnius between Poland and Lithuania. Vytautas the Great was allowed to rule in Lithuania for the rest of his life, but he had to recognize that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was his superior. Vytautas the Great swore allegiance to Poland and to help it in all its battles. Lithuania would return to Poland after Vytautas the Great died. On January 18, 1401, Lithuanian boyars confirmed the agreement in Vilnius. On March 11, 1401, elite Poles confirmed the agreement at Radom. It is called the Union of Vilnius and Radom. According to the agreement, if WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo died, Vytautas the Great and the Lithuanians were not allowed to pick who would be his successor.\n\nIn 1401, an uprising occurred in Samogitia against the Teutonic Knights. Vytautas the Great supported the uprising militarily. It led to war between Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo supported Vytautas the Great diplomatically. In 1403, Pope Bonifatius IX issued a bull that prohibited the Teutonic Knights from waging war against Lithuania, since it had just recently adopted Roman Catholicism. The Pope had superiority over the Teutonic Knights. The bull was the result of WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's diplomatic efforts.\n\nSÌwidrygieÅÅo had the ambition to replace Vytautas the Great and take his position in Lithuania. He was able to find allies in SmolenÌsk, Ryazan, and Vyazma to support him. They were Orthodox boyars who were displeased that boyars who converted to Roman Catholicism were given special privileges. In 1402, SÌwidrygieÅÅo met with the Teutonic Knights in Malbork and formed an alliance against Vytautas the Great. If SÌwidrygieÅÅo would take Vytautas the Great's place, SÌwidrygieÅÅo was to give Samogitia to the Teutonic Knights. From 1402 to 1403, war ensued. The Teutonic Knights had many losses. At the end of 1403, the Teutonic Knights began to seek peace. A truce was struck for six months. SÌwidrygieÅÅo lost Podole. He received Bryansk, Czernihiv, and NowogroÌd. On May 22, 1404, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo met the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Konrad von Jungingen, and settled on a peace agreement in RaciaÌ¨zÌ. Poland gave Samogitia to the Teutonic Knights and the Teutonic Knights let Poland have DobrzynÌ Land. Polish nobles met at Nowy Korczyn and decided to raise a tax on land by six times from two grosze to twelve grosze per field to finance the deal. On June 10, 1405, DobrzynÌ Land returned to Poland. Vytautas the Great began to expand eastward after the peace settlement in RaciaÌ¨zÌ. In 1404, Vytautas the Great conquered SmolenÌsk. Polish troops where subsequently stationed there. Veliky Novgorod and Pskov were attacked next. In 1406, 1407, and 1408, Vytautas the Great attacked Moscow. Vytautas the Great was supported by Polish troops led by Poland's marshal, Zbigniew of Brzezie. After the attack on Moscow in 1408, SÌwidrygieÅÅo conspired with opponents in Ruthenia who were against Lithuanian expansion eastward. He may have been under the influence of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nWÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Jadwiga had difficult relations with WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk. He possessed part of Kujawy and DobrzynÌ Land. In 1387, WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk protested when Jadwiga took over Red Ruthenia. WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk was disillusioned with WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo after he opposed appointing his nephew, Jan KropidÅo, to become the Archbishop of Gniezno. In 1391, WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk pawned ZÅotoria to the Teutonic Knights against the principles of Polish law. In 1391, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo ended up occupying many of WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk's towns. ZÅotoria was not occupied.\n\nIn 1392, WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk presented a plan to the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Konrad Wallenrod, about partitioning Poland. It was the first time that partitioning Poland was planned. The Teutonic Knights were supposed to get DobrzynÌ Land, Kujawy, and Mazovia according to the plan. Sigismund of Luxemburg was to get Ruthenia and Lesser Poland. WacÅaw, Jost, and Jan were to get Greater Poland that was west of the Warta river. Konrad Wallenrod did not want to fight Poland, since he was already fighting Lithuania. He also believed that the plan was really Sigismund of Luxemburg;s and not WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk's. WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk ended up giving the Teutonic Knights Kujawy and DobrzynÌ Land for 72,900 Hungarian florins. Poland protested the move. In 1393, Sigismund of Luxemburg gave WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk DobrzynÌ Land illegally. After WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk sold the land, Poland occupied some of his lands and annexed them. DobrzynÌ Land remained under the control of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nWÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo struck an alliance with Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia. He was the king of Germany since 1376. The alliance was aimed against Hungary and the Teutonic Knights. In 1395, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo joined the alliance that Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia created that comprised of the dukes of Pomerania and the towns in the Hanseatic League. In 1396, Vytautas the Great joined the alliance. Wenceslaus IV and Pope Bonifatius IX ended up telling the Teutonic Knights to not attack Lithuania. It was a result of the alliance. The alliance also helped with Hungary. Sigismund of Luxemburg was supposed to meet in Nowy SaÌ¨cz with Jadwiga and WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo to settle differences, but the meeting never materialized. A threat from Turkey materialized.\n\nJadwiga laid claim to the throne in Hungary as the only living Angevin. She used her claim in order to negotiate a trade for Hungary to relinquish Ruthenia and Moldovia. When Sigismund of Luxemburg was busy, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Jadwiga occupied Kujawy and WielunÌ that were controlled by WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk. WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk retreated to Silesia where he died in 1401. In 1395, Tokhtamysh, the former khan of the Golden Horde, sought support from WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo after he was ousted by Timur, who is also known as Tamerlane. In 1397, Vytautas the Great went on a campaign to the Black Sea. He put Tokhtamysh back into power in part of the Golden Horde. The plan was to defeat Timur and put in Tokhtamysh in his place. Tokhtamysh would give Ruthenia to Vytautas the Great in return.\n\nIn 1397, Sigismund of Luxemburg and WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo struck a peace accord for sixteen years. Sigismund of Luxemburg wanted peace with his northern neighbor, since he had so many troubles with Turkey. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo received rights to Red Ruthenia for his lifetime in return for giving up his claims to Moldovia and Podole. Jadwiga also had to stop assuming the title of queen of Hungary. Jadwiga attempted to return DobrzynÌ Land to Poland. In 1397, Jadwiga met the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Konrad von Jungingen, in WÅocÅawek. He said he could return it, but he wanted the money back that was paid for it. WÅadysÅaw Opolczyk would not return it. In 1398, Jadwiga attempted to get the land back at a meeting in TorunÌ, but it was an unsuccessful attempt. She also stated that the Teutonic Knights will have peaceful relations with Poland during her lifetime, but that they would worsen after her death.\n\nIn 1399, it was known that Jadwiga was pregnant. Pope Bonifatius IX was invited to be her child's Godfather. On June 22, 1399, Jadwiga gave birth to Elizabeth Bonifacia. On July 13, 1399, Elizabeth Bonifacia died. On July 17, 1399, Jadwiga died. After Jadwiga died, KrakoÌw's elite proposed that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo marry Casimir III the Great's granddaughter who was the daughter of Wilhelm von Cilly. Jadwiga may have had a part in planning the marriage before she died in order to save the kingdom. On January 29, 1402, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo married Anna in Poland. In 1408, Anna gave birth to Jadwiga. Some believe that Anna cheated on WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo with Jakub of Kobylan or MikoÅaj ChrzaÌ¨stowski. Others believed that these allegations should be withdrawn. In 1416, Anna died. In May 1417, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo married a widow who had three failed marriages and was named Elizabeth of Pilcz. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo married her without any consultation with his advisers. Critics of the marriage criticized her background. StanisÅaw CioÅka, a secretary of the chancellery, wrote a libel and ended up being removed from his position for it. In 1420, Elizabeth of Pilcz died from a pulmonary disease.\n\nIn 1414, homage was paid to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's sole daughter, Jadwiga, since WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's heir was to succeed him according to the Union of HorodÅo. If there was no heir, a king was to be elected. There were attempts to wed Jadwiga. In 1419, the king of the Union of Kalmar, Eric, tried to wed Jadwiga to BogusÅaw IX who was the Duke of Pomerania, but it never was actuated. In 1421, Jadwiga married Frederick who was the son of Frederick the Elector of Brandenburg. Their marriage contract stated that if they gave birth to a male son, he would be king.\n\nIn February 1422, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo married Sophia of Halshany who was an Orthodox Christian and Lithuanian princess. He married her against the will of his advisers. Sigismund of Luxemburg proposed that he marry Ofka who was the widow of the king of Bohemia, but his idea was ignored. In 1424, Sophia of Halshany was made queen. On October 31, 1424, Sophia of Halshany gave birth to WÅadysÅaw. By the terms of the Union of HorodÅo, he was to be the next king, but Poland's nobility wanted an election and for their privileges to be reconfirmed instead. In July 1422, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo gave the nobility the CzerwinÌski Privilege that made it illegal to confiscate the property of the nobility without a court order. Moreover, it forbid to simultaneously hold the positions of mayor and judge in a given land. It also made it obligatory for a royal council to decide if money should be minted. On October 28, 1423, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo issued the Warecki Statute that limited mayors' power to judge cases of arson, mugging, rape, and robbery. It also blocked peasants from leaving their village and helped nobles' manors expand. In the spring of 1421, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo formed an alliance with Frederick I the Elector of Brandenburg against the Teutonic Knights. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo gave his only daughter, Jadwiga, who was the heir to the throne, to marry Frederick I's son, Frederick, to form the alliance. The two were to rule Poland in the future.\n\nA document was produced that confirmed the right of WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's son to become king. If he were to die, Sophia of Halshany and Vytautas the Great were to be regents. Towns and Poland's elite produced a document that also confirmed that he had the right to be king. On April 25, 1425, a general sejm met in BrzesÌcÌ to accept the conditions. On April 30, 1425, the sejm recognized WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's son as his successor upon the condition that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo would confirm the privileges of the nobility and clergy. The document that was produced for it also expanded Polish law into Ruthenia, Kujawy, and DobrzynÌ. It also exempted property of the Catholic Church from having troops stationed on it. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's son had to confirm these new privileges as well as all old privileges before becoming king. At the general sejm, the idea of making Vytautas the Great and Sophia of Halshany rule Lithuania was not well received. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's son was also to become the ruler of Lithuania. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo made agreements with Polish tons towns and lands to ensure that his son would succeed him.\n\nIn 1428, a plan was pondered of making Vytautas the Great king. If Vytautas the Great would die without leaving behind any heirs, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's kids would succeed. Poles opposed it, but Sigismund of Luxemburg supported it. He wanted to weaken the Angevin dynasty.\n\nIn 1426 and 1427, Sophia of Halshany gave birth two sons who were both named Casimir. There were some who questioned the legitimacy of her sons. They claimed that Sophia of Halshany's sons were conceived as the result of affairs with Polish knights by the name of HinÌcz of RogoÌw, Jan Kraska, Jan of Koniecpol, Piotr Kurowski, DobiesÅaw of Szczekocin, Piotr of Szczekocin, and Wawrzyniec ZareÌ¨ba. She was forced to swear an oath that she did not commit any affairs. Jan Strasz of BiaÅaczoÌw was imprisoned for writing that Sophia of Halshany had affairs. The knights who were accused of the affair were freed and returned to the positions they held before.\n\nHungary attempted to make a new union with Poland. On June 11, 1401, Hungarians proposed a project at a congress in Tapolca, Hungary, to offer the crown of Hungary to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. The project was never realized. Weneslaus IV tried to ally with WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. In 1404, Wenceslaus IV met with WÅadysÅaw IV JagieÅÅo after he lost his German crown. Wenceslaus IV asked for military help. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo would get SÌlaÌ¨sk in return. The trade never materialized, since Czechs opposed it.\n\nIn 1402, Sigismund of Luxemburg attempted to sell Brandenburg to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo, since he had financial troubles. The Teutonic Knights offered more and were able to buy it. The new land helped to strengthen the Teutonic Knights' territorial expanse and created a route from which Western Europe could send support to them. The annexation of Brandenburg made the Teutonic Knights' kingdom the largest it would ever be in its history.\n\nPoland was affected when Lithuania and Moscow settled on spheres of influence. In 1408, Vytautas the Great and Vasily I Dmitriyevich, the Grand Prince of Moscow, his son-in-law, divided up spheres of influence between their two states. Lithuania was given predominance in Eastern Europe that reached into Novgogod, Pskov, and SmolenÌsk. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's brother, Lingwen, was put in Novgorod as his representative and a Lithuanian deputy was placed in Pskov.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights were a constant threat to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. Conflicts continued to arise between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. After Ulrich von der Osten paid homage to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo in 1403, he allied himself with the Teutonic Knights in 1403 or 1404. He ended up attacking Greater Poland. His castle in DrzenÌ ended up being taken by the Teutonic Knights. Vytautas tried to get DrzenÌ back to Polandunsuccessfully. In 1408, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Ulrich von Jungingen, bought DrzenÌ. The Teutonic aknights also tried to get Santok from Poland, since they believed it was part of Nowa Marchia (âNew Marchâ) that is known as Eastern Brandenburg. The Teutonic Knights discredited the union between Lithuania and Poland, since it threatened their existence. If there were no more people to evangelize, they could be disbanded. They stated that Lithuania's conversion to Roman Catholicism was false in order to expand eastward.\n\nRelations with the Teutonic Knights slowly deteriorated. When Poland sent grain on the Vistula River to Lithuania, the Teutonic Knights unlawfully seized it. In 1409, Vytautas supported an uprising against the Teutonic Knights in Samogitia. The Teutonic Knights asked for Poland to be neutral in the matter. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was at first neutral, but after a congress in ÅeÌ¨czyce WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo decided to help Lithuania. On August 6, 1409, Ulrich von Jungingen declared war on Poland. The Teutonic Knights attacked DobrzynÌ Land and occupied Bobrowniki, DobrzynÌ, Lipno, and Rypin. A truce was declared from October 8, 1409, to June 24, 1410, after both sides found that they were not fully prepared to wage war. Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia was to mediate peace for the two sides.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights produced more propaganda during the truce that stated that the Lithuanians were pagans who had to be converted in order to get support from Western Europe. They ended up paying Sigismund of Luxemburg 300,000 Hungarian forints to get him on their side in the war. This deal was secret. The plan was for Sigismund of Luxemburg to attack southern Poland with the Teutonic Knights. He would get Moldavia, Podole, and Ruthenia if they won the war. On February 15, 1410, Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia declared the terms of the truce in Prague. On May 14, 1410, the terms were declared in WrocÅaw. They were favorable for the Teutonic Knights. The Teutonic Knights were to get Samogitia and DobrzynÌ Land. Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia was on the side of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nOn October 2, 1409, SÌwidrygieÅÅo struck an alliance with the Teutonic Knights again. For his help, the Teutonic Knights would help him to get his patrimony back. Vytautas the Great imprisoned SÌwidrygieÅÅo before he waged war. His accomplices were reprieved. The Teutonic Knights were also able to pay the dukes of Western Pomerania, SÌwieÌ¨tobor, and BogusÅaw 2,000 Czech groschen to get them in an alliance in the war against Poland. Another ally the Teutonic Knights were to get was Konrad the White who was the Duke of OlesÌnica. The Teutonic Knights were not able to get much military help from Western Europe.\n\nPoland went on its own diplomatic trips to Rupert, the king of Germany, Henry IV, the king of England, German dukes, and Pope Alexander V. Poland's argument was that the Teutonic Knights were just set on expansion and not Christianity. Their diplomatic efforts were effective. On January 23, 1410, Pope Alexander V called on the Teutonic Knights to make peace with WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. Poland was able to get the hospodar of Moldavia, Alexander, to fight against the Teutonic Knights. Mercenaries were hired from Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia, The Mongols under the pretender to the Mongol throne, Jalal al-Din, supported Vytautas the Great in the war. The Duke of Szczecin, Casimir V, also helped the Teutonic Knights in the war.\n\nSigismund of Luxemburg attempted to disunite the alliance between Lithuania and Poland. Vytautas met with Sigismund of Luxemburg in KiezÌmark. Sigismund tried to offer him a royal crown in Lithuania in return for leaving the alliance with Poland, but his attempt failed. The Hungarian emissaries, MikoÅaj Gara and SÌcibor of SÌciboÌrz, went to the Teutonic Knights to try to make peace, but they could only prolong peace for a few days. On July 12, 1410, Hungarian emissaries declared war on WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo for Sigismund of Luxemburg.\n\nOn July 15, 1410, the Battle of Grunwald took place. It is Poland's most famous battle. Jan DÅugosz drew schematics of the battle in his book, Historia Polski (âHistory of Polandâ). There may have been from 15,000 to 21,000 Teutonic Knights, 20,000 to 30,000 Poles, and 10,000 to 20,000 Lithuanians in the battle. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was the supreme commander in the battle, while Vytautas led Lithuanian and Ruthenian troops. WÅadysÅaw II directed his troops from a hill. When his life was in danger, his secretary, Zbigniew OlesÌnicki, saved him. The battle was a huge loss for the Teutonic Knights. The Grand Master, Ulrich von Jungingen, and all important officials of the Teutonic Knights were killed. The day of the battle was the day Jesus sent out his Apostles. The holiday was to be celebrated in all of Poland thereafter.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights' banners were taken and hanged in the cathedrals in KrakoÌw and Vilnius. Jan DÅugosz produced a manuscript in 1466 called, Banderia Prutenorum (âBanners of the Prussiansâ), that displayed all of the banners. Fifty-one of the banners the Teutonic Knights brought to the Battle of Grunwald were taken. In 1448, Jan DÅugosz recommended to the artist StanisÅaw Durink to make copies of all the banners.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights said that Mongols and Orthodox Rusyns helped to win the battle and that it was a loss for Roman Catholicism. In 1410, StanisÅaw of Skarbimierz wrote O wojnach sprawiedliwych (âOn Just Warsâ) in defense of pagan countries' sovereignty as well as their right to be allied with Christians. The bishop of PÅock, Jakub Kurdwanowski, told troops in CzerwinÌsk these same matters before the Battle of Grunwald.\n\nAfter the outcome of the battle was known, most of the towns in the Teutonic Knights' state opened their gates to Polish and Lithuanian troops. On July 25, 1410, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Vytautas the Great reached Malbork and laid siege to its castle. Heinrich von Plauen defended it. Germans and Livonians came to help the Teutonic Knights in the battle.\n\nThe siege of the castle in Malbork was called off after funds dried up. On September 18, 1410, Lithuanian forces began to return home. On September 19, 1410, Polish forces left for home. The towns that surrendered to Poland returned to the Teutonic Knights, such as ElblaÌ¨g and GdanÌsk. Mayors and others who went to Poland's side were killed.\n\nIn October 1410, Sigismund of Luxemburg's troops attacked Poland but were defeated at Bardejov. Michael KuÌchmeister von Sternberg attacked from Neumark, but on October 10, 1410, he lost in a battle at Koronowo. Important towns that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo still held were TorunÌ and Nieszawa. After Heinrich von Plauen became the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, he reorganized his administration. It led Poland to seek peace. On December 9, 1410, a truce was settled. From December 10 to December 13, 1940, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo met with Heinrich von Plauen at RaciaÌ¨zÌek to discuss peace terms. On February 1, 1411, peace was signed at TorunÌ. DobrzynÌ Land was to return to Poland. Samogitia was to be Lithuanian for the lifetimes of WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Vytautas the Great. The cases of the towns of Santok and DrzenÌ were to be settled according to arbitrage. The Teutonic Knights were to buy back their prisoners of war for 100,000 Czech groschen. The peace terms were not very favorable for Poland.\n\nThe victory in the war brought respect to Poland in Europe. It also led to Sigismund of Luxemburg to seek peaceful means to improve relations with Poland and Lithuania, but his new attitude was temporary. In January 1412, Sigismund of Luxemburg told the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights that he could help them militarily in return for money. The Teutonic Knights would get DobrzynÌ Land, Kujawy, and Samogitia. In April 1411, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo sought help from the Republic of Venice. In May 1411, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo made an alliance with the voivode of Wallachia, Mircza, and the hospodar of Moldavia, Alexander, against Sigismund of Luxemburg. In the spring of 1402, emissaries of the Republic of Venice came to KrakoÌw and proposed an alliance against Sigismund of Luxemburg. They also proposed that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo become king of Germany. Ernest the Iron, the Duke of Austria, married Cymbarka, the daughter of Siemowit IV, and made a pact with WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo against Sigismund of Luxemburg. All of these political maneuverings led Sigismund of Luxemburg's to change his relations with Poland. On March 15, 1412, Sigismund of Luxemburg and WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo signed the Treaty of Lubowla that created an alliance between the two. It also made Red Ruthenia and Podole be under Poland's sovereignty during the lifetimes of Sigismund of Luxemburg and WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo as well as for five years after their deaths. A court would decide the fate of Red Ruthenia and Podole afterward. The hospodar of Moldavia would be under Polish jurisdiction, but he was obligated to help Sigismund of Luxemburg to fight in a war against Turkey if it ever occurred. His country would be partitioned by Poland and Hungary if he did not honor his obligation. The alliance with Sigismund of Luxemburg was not very favorable for Poland, but it did end the alliance between Sigismund of Luxemburg and the Teutonic Knights. Sigismund of Luxemburg sent a letter to the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights that exhorted him to seek peaceful relations with Poland and Lithuania.\n\nThe Teutonic Knights did not honor the peace of TorunÌ. They tried to continue to expand. Poland tried to get CheÅmno Land, MichaÅowo Land, and Pomerania from the Teutonic Knights. Sigismund of Luxemburg influenced the Teutonic Knights to make a deal with Poland on the contentious lands. Pope John XXIII sent Branda Castiglione to participate in negotiations. Sigismund of Luxemburg sent a lawyer named Benedykt Makraia for the negotiations. On November 8, 1412, Sigismund of Luxemburg gave Poland thirteen towns in SpisÌ. In return, he was to get 37,000 Czech groschen that the Teutonic Knights were to first pay Poland for reparations for the war.\n\nBenedict Makraia stated that the Teutonic Knights were trying to expand their borders and that Vytautas honored the peace of TorunÌ. Benedict Makraia did not support Poland's claim to CheÅmno Land, MichaÅowo Land, and Pomerania. The Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, Heinrich von Plauen, ended up being replaced with Michael KuÌchmeister in 1413, since they feared Heinrich von Plauen would start another war.\n\nFrom 1412, Poland and Lithuania attempted to strengthen themselves, since conflict with the Teutonic Knights seemed unavoidable. On October 2, 1413, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo, Vytautas the Great, and the elite of Poland and Lithuania promulgated the Union of HorodÅo. The terms of the union stated that Lithuania was to be completely incorporated into Poland, but Lithuania in reality kept its disparity. According to the terms of the union, Vytautas was to be the Grand Duke of Lithuania, while WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was to be the Most High Duke of Lithuania. After Vytautas would die, a successor would be elected by the king with the help of religious and secular authorities in Poland and Lithuania. Lithuanian boyars who converted to Roman Catholicism were given the same privileges as Polish nobles. Forty-seven Lithuanian boyars' houses with their coats of arms were brought into Poland's nobility. Lithuania was to adopt Poland's positions of castellans, mayors, and voivodes. Matters between Lithuania and Poland were to be settled in congresses in Lublin and Parczew. The union was a loss for the Teutonic Knights.\n\nAfter the union, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo began a campaign of intensive evangelization of Samogitia. Poland and Lithuania also began to demand the return of CheÅmno Land, GdanÌsk Pomerania, and MichaÅowo Land. Negotiations were held with the Teutonic Knights in Grabia. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo also met with the Grand Master to settle the matter, but it was a failure. In June 1414, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo declared war on the Teutonic Knights. Poland and Lithuania gathered greater forces that they had in the Battle of Grunwald. After conquering Nidzica, Olsztyn, and Olsztynek, Polish and Lithuanian forces retreated due to lack of nourishment. On October 7, 1414, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo made a two-year truce with the Teutonic Knights after being persuaded by Pope John XXIII's legate, Wilhelm de Challant. At the Council of Constance in 1414, many Poles participated. Archbishop of Gniezno, MikoÅaj TraÌ¨ba, was at the head of the delegation sent from KrakoÌw. Along with him were the Bishop of PÅock, Jakub Kurdwanowski, and the electee of PoznanÌ, Andrzej Åaskarz, both of whom were in favor of Conciliarism. Knights and diplomats who went with him were Andrzej Balicki, Jan of TuliszkoÌw, and Zawisz the Black of GarboÌw. The rector of University of KrakoÌw came as an expert on the relations between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. Another Pole at the council was Piotr Wolfram who represented the Bishop of KrakoÌw and was the secretary of MikoÅaj TraÌ¨ba. The participants of the Council were divided info five nations. They were English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Poland belonged to the German nation at the council. During the trial of Jan Hus at the council, Poles criticized how Jan Hus was treated. Poland brought its case against the Teutonic Knights by saying that they used brutal and deadly force to convert Pagans. Polish representatives also stated particular facts on the territorial disputes Poland had with the Teutonic Knights. Cardinal Francis Zabarella was at the head of the commission that judged the case. In the summer of 1415, Sigismund of Luxemburg left the council. His absence suspended the trial. While he was in Paris, he met with MikoÅaj TraÌ¨ba and representatives of the Teutonic Knights. They decided to prolong the truce. In May 1416, it was made official at InowrocÅaw by both sides.\n\nAt the end of 1415, the newly christened inhabitants of Samogitia were presented at the council by the Polish delegation to show that evangelization was truly happening under WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. The Samogitians said they only wanted to be converted by Polish and Lithuanian bishops. In February 1416, the Samogitians presented a list of abuses the Teutonic Knights were guilty of that included prohibiting evangelization. The Samogitians also asked for the Archbishop of LwoÌw to take over the mission in Samogitia. The Samogitians testimony was grounds for liquidating the Teutonic Knights' state and relocating them to the south to fight the Turks and Mongols. In 1416, PaweÅ WÅodkowic presented text from his book, O wÅadzy papiezÌa I cesarza wobec niewiernych (âOn the Power of the Pope and Caesar in Regards to Infidelsâ). He states that it is against natural law and God's law for Christians to wage war on pagans just because they are pagans. They have to be treated equally. He also states that the Teutonic Knights are using false arguments and text to justify holy wars. Jan Auerbach, Jakub Balardi, and Ardicinus de Navaria argued against him in favor of holy wars. John of Falkenberg, a German Dominican monk, wrote a book called Liber de doctrina (âBook of Doctrineâ) in which he argued against PaweÅ WÅodkowic and Poland. He stated that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was not intelligent and not a real Christian. He stated that he was a pagan and that his kingdom was pagan. He advocated killing him and enslaving everyone in his kingdom. John of Falkenberg also wrote Satira (âSatireâ) that stated that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was a dog and his nation should be exterminated for heresy. He is attributed to be the first author to write in favor of genocide. Polish bishops and PaweÅ WÅodkowic influenced the council to imprison John of Falkenberg. The Dominicans sentenced him to life imprisonment. The commission that reviewed his works judged his works heretical. On May 14, 1418, a commission of cardinals deplored John of Falkenerg's works. John of Falkenberg ended up being imprisoned in a papal prison.\n\nThe Council of Constance did not resolve the conflict between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. Both sides agreed to continue the truce until July 13, 1418. In April 1418, a congress confirmed the truce in BrzesÌcÌ.\n\nMany positive things resulted from the Council of Constance. The Teutonic Knights were discredited and Poland's reputation as a Christian country was elevated. Western Europe learned that the Teutonic Knights were insincere and manipulative. MikoÅaj TraÌ¨ba was made the primate of Poland by Pope Martin V. The primate of Poland was to be the Archbishop of Gniezno from then and onward.\n\nIn 1419, Pope Martin V sent his legates, Jacob the bishop of Spoleto and Ferdinand the bishop of Lugano, to InowrocÅaw to settle the matter between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo ended up meeting Sigismund of Luxemburg at Koszyce and agreed to his idea of letting his court arbitrate. Sigismund of Luxemburg had plans of partitioning Prussia by taking some of it and giving part of it to Poland. Michael KuÌchmeister, the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, did not honor Sigismund of Luxemburg's peace proposals. Poland decided to fight again. In July 1419, an alliance was forged between Poland and Eric who ruled the Union of Kalmar that was north of the Teutonic Knights' kingdom. Poland's troops were ready to attack when Sigismund of Luxemburg sent the Archbishop of Milan, Bartholomew Capra, to Michael KuÌchmeister and convinced him to submit to Sigismund's arbitration. The truce was prolonged by a year. On January 6, 1420, Sigismund of Luxemburg confirmed the peace terms established in TorunÌ that recognized the Teutonic Knights' kingdom's territorial integrity and gave them Murzynno, Nowa WiesÌ, and OrÅowo. Sigismund changed his stance, because he made an agreement with the Catholic Church to eliminate Hussites in Bohemia. The Catholic Church still supported the Teutonic Knights. Poland rejected the verdict. Zbigniew OlesÌnicki and MikoÅaj Cebulka were sent to Sigismund of Luxemburg to tell him that he betrayed his promises to Poland. Vytautas the Great went a step further by declaring him his enemy.\n\nWÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo prepared for another campaign against the Teutonic Knights by drawing closer to Sigismund Luxemburg. It led to a public debate in KrakoÌw in 1431 between the professors of KrakoÌwâs university and Czech theologians. The closer ties led to an alliance in July 1432 that was forged in Pabianice in Poland that was against the Teutonic Knights. War with the Teutonic Knights followed. During the Council of Basel in 1431, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo sent representatives to battle against the representatives of the Teutonic Knights and SÌvitrigaila over a favorable settlement to their conflict. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅoâs representatives were Zbigniew OlesÌnicki, the bishop of PoznanÌ, StanisÅaw CioÅek, the rector of KrakoÌw, MikoÅaj Lasocki, and Jan Lutek of Brzezie. Representatives of KrakoÌwâs university were MikoÅaj KozÅowski and StanisÅaw Sobniowski. In 1434 and 1435, Polandâs representatives accused the Teutonic Knights of having an alliance with the Ruthenians, while the Teutonic Knights accused Poland of having an alliance with Czechs. The problem with the alliance with the Ruthenians was that they were Orthodox Christians, and the problem with an alliance with the Czechs was that they were Hussites. MikoÅaj Lasocki questioned why the Teutonic Knights existed and stated that they brought disrepute to the Catholic Church. Lasocki also argued that Poland guarded Christianity from the Tartars. The Polish delegation at the Council of Basel helped to gain respect for Poland in Europe. After the Council of Basel, Lasocki was sent to the Congress of Arras in 1435 to help in peace negotiations between France and Burgundy, since he impressed so many at the Council of Basel. Lasocki also wrote a description of the conflict between Poland and the Teutonic Knights for John II of Castile.\n\nIn May 1433, Polish forces under the leadership of SeÌ¨dziwoÌj OstroroÌg and MikoÅaj of MichaÅoÌw linked up with Hussite forces led by Jan CÌapek of SaÌn. They attacked Pomeranian GdanÌsk and Neumark that the Teutonic Knights controlled. They were able to conquer Tczew and reach to the shore of the Baltic Sea in GdanÌsk. The Teutonic Knights were forced to seek peace after Hussite forces sacked a Cistercian monastery in Oliwa. On December 15, 1433, a truce was agreed upon in ÅeÌ¨czyca in central Poland. Peace negotiations were to follow in 1434.\n\nHussitism had a degree of influence among a few Poles. Poles who believed in Hussitism include Spytek of MelsztynÌ and a judge named Abraham of ZbaÌ¨szynÌ. Magnates in Greater Poland who sympathized with Hussitism include SeÌ¨dziwoÌj OstroroÌg and Wincenty of SzamotuÅ. Sophia of Halshany, a Lithuanian princess, also sympathized with it. Others who sympathized with Hussitism include poor clergy, nobility, townspeople, and some village people. Some Hussites attacked Polish churches and monasteries. In 1430, Hussites attacked Jasna GoÌra Monastery in CzeÌ¨stochowa and harmed the painting of the famous Black Madonna. Andrzej GaÅka of DobczynÌ, a professor from the University of KrakoÌw, collected texts written by Hussites and created works for Hussitism. One of his works, Cantilena vulgaris (âSong of Wiklefâ), became famous. It was a satire of the Pope and Catholic clergy.\n\nPoland took steps to eliminate Hussites and their influence. The Archbishop of Gniezno, MikoÅaj TraÌ¨ba, intensified oversight on people who had ties to Hussites. Schools that had texts of the Hussites were ordered to burn them. It was recommended that secular authorities were to help to capture Hussites. In April 1424, the Edict of WielunÌ restricted Hussites and their doctrine in Poland. Secular authorities were ordered to help to fight them. Nobles who fled to Bohemia to join the Hussites were ordered to return to Poland or else they would be banned and have their property taken away. Czechs asked WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Vytautas the Great to let Zygmunt Korybutowicz return to rule in Prague, but they were opposed. In the spring of 1424, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo declared war on the Hussites after Sigismund of Luxemburg's negotiations failed. When Polish and Lithuanian troops came to fight, Sigismund of Luxemburg's son-in-law, Albrecht Habsburg, sent them back home, since he feared they would go to the Hussites' side. Zygmunt Korybutowicz came to Bohemia with Polish and Lithuanian knights. Zygmunt Korybutowicz began to hold talks between Catholic and conservative Hussites when he realized that there was no hope to become king. In 1427, he was imprisoned once it was found out that the Pope would support him to be king if he would bring the Hussites into the Catholic Church. The Hussites would only possess a few liturgical differences under this scenario. In July 1420, accusations were leveled against promoters of the Hussites' doctrine in Poland at a congress in ÅeÌ¨czyce. The adherents were Jan of TuliszkoÌw, Wojciech JastrzeÌ¨biec, and Zbigniew of Brzezie. Wojciech JastrzeÌ¨biec was also accused of falsely editing the text of the truce with Sigismund of Luxemburg. His dismissal was called for, but he was proven to be innocent. He ended up keeping his position.\n\nIn the summer of 1420, some Czech Hussites in Bohemia wanted to make WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo king. They sent Hynek of HolsÌtejn to Poland to explore this matter. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo did not want to become king of Bohemia, since it would only cause conflict with Roman Catholic countries. At the end of 1420, an official Czech delegation offered WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo the crown of Bohemia, but he did not accept it. In the beginning of 1421, Vytautas the Great expressed interest in the Bohemian crown. Vytautas the Great would only become king of Bohemia if Hussites would adopt more Roman Catholicism and only maintain some liturgical practices of their Hussite doctrine. The Hussites wanted him to pledge loyalty to the Four Articles of Prague that stated their doctrine. Vytautas the Great refused. Czechs and Poles debated at the university of KrakoÌw on how to handle this matter, but no consensus could be made.\n\nSigismund of Luxemburg offered Silesia and the hand of his widowed sister-in-law, Ofka, to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo if he would help fight the Hussites. It never materialized, since Vytautas the Great opposed it and Sigismund of Luxemburg was dealt defeats in the war against the Hussites. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo sought to bring the Hussites into the Catholic Church by negotiations. Pope Martin V supported the negotiations. Pope Martin V prolonged the truce between Poland and the Teutonic Knights twice and agreed to start hearings on the disputes between Poland and the Teutonic Knights. PaweÅ WÅodkowic represented Poland in the hearings. At the end of 1421, Pope Martin V sent a legate to Poland to investigate the matter. The Teutonic Knights protested and tried to sabotage the mission. In July 1422, the hearing began and lasted until February 1423.\n\nIn the spring of 1422, Zygmunt Korybutowicz was made Vytautas the Great's viceroy in Bohemia. Vytautas the Great was Bohemia's king. Zygmunt Korybutowicz was placed in the position with the help of thousands of Polish and Lithuanian knights. Zygmunt Korybutowicz swore to the Four Articles of Prague, but not all Hussites recognized him. Pope Martin V disapproved of WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo's support for Zygmunt Korybutowicz, since he was guilty of heresy. Pope Martin V told WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo to remove Zygmunt Korybutowicz from power and stopped the hearing on the disputes between the Teutonic Knights and Poland as a result. Sigismund of Luxemburg wanted the Teutonic Knights to attack Poland. In July 1422, Poland and Lithuania attacked the Teutonic Knights after their truce exhausted. On September 27, 1422, a pact of peace was signed at Melno. Poland received Murzynno, Nieszawa, and OrÅowo. It wanted CheÅmno Land, MichaÅowo Land, and Pomerania, but it was unable to negotiate for them. The Teutonic Knights gave up their claim to Samogitia. The peace put the Teutonic Knights on a defensive stance, for the reason that their vassals were to repudiate allegiance to them if they broke the peace terms. In November 1422, a decision was at made at the congress in NiepoÅomice to pull out of Bohemia and join the side of Sigismund of Luxemburg. Zygmunt Korybutowicz was removed from power. The King's secretary, Zbigniew OlesÌnicki, and members of the Polish Catholic Church were behind the change in politics. They were enemies of the Hussites and heresy in general.\n\nIn March 1423, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo met with Sigismund of Luxemburg at a congress in KiezÌmark that renewed the alliance the two made in Lubowla in 1412. WÅadysÅaw II pledged to stop supporting the Hussites. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Sigismund of Luxemburg produced texts that disproved the belief that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo supported heresy. Pope Martin V stopped stating that WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo supported heretics.\n\nIn 1429 at the Congress of Lutsk, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo, Sigismund of Luxemburg, and Vytautas the Great discussed elevating Lithuania to the position of a kingdom. Zbigniew OlesÌnicki protested against the idea on behalf of Polish dignitaries, since it violated all of the agreements that dealt with the union of Poland and Lithuania. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo was forced to abnegate his plan as a result of their pressure. In 1429 and 1430, Pope Martin V told Vytautas the Great to not accept Sigismund of Luxemburg's plan to be crowned king. In the autumn of 1430, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo continued to plan for the coronation of Vytautas the Great, but on October 27, 1430, Vytautas the Great died. WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo made his brother SÌwidrygieÅÅo the ruler of Lithuania against the terms of the Union of HorodÅo. The king's royal council ordered troops to take Podole without the knowledge of WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo. In February 1431, the king's royal council met at a congress in Sandomierz. Its members stated that they would accept SÌwidrygieÅÅo as ruler of Lithuania in return for possession of Podole and Åuck. However, SÌwidrygieÅÅo did not accept it. In the summer of 1431, SÌwidrygieÅÅo made an alliance with the Teutonic Knights and Moldavia against Poland. In July 1431, Poland and Lithuania fought. SÌwidrygieÅÅo was able to recover part of Podole. Poland was unable to get back Åuck. In the summer of 1431, Lithuania and the Teutonic Knights attacked the borderland of Kujawy and Greater Poland. On September 1, 1431, a truce was settled. In the spring of 1432, Polish representatives agreed to make WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅoâs son king of Poland at the congress in SieradzÌ. SÌvitrigaila was to rule Lithuania, but WÅadsyÅaw II JagieÅÅoâs sons would get to rule Lithuania after SÌvitrigaila died. SÌvitrigaila did not agree.\n\nOn August 31, 1432, and September 1, 1432, Catholic and Lithuanian boyars seized power in Lithuania. SÌvitrigaila escaped and lost control over Lithuania. Sigismund KeÌ¨stutaitis, the brother of Vytautas the Great, was made Grand Duke of Lithuania. SÌvitrigaila attempted to regain power. On October 15, 1432, a Polish embassy with Zbigniew OlesÌnicki was able to get Sigismund KeÌ¨stutaitis to sign the Union of Grodno in Grodno, Lithuania. Sigismund KeÌ¨stutaitis was to rule Lithuania for the rest of his life, but he had to pledge allegiance to WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo and Poland. He also could not transfer power to any of his heirs. Lithuania ended its alliance with the Teutonic Knights. It also gave Poland Podole, but it kept WoÅynÌ. In January 1433, WÅadsyÅaw II JagieÅÅo confirmed the Union of Grodno and its terms. Orthodox Christians in Lithuania were given equal rights in Lithuania. On May 6, 1434, Sigismund KeÌ¨stutaitis confirmed at Trakai that Orthodox Christians would have equal rights just like Catholics in Lithuania. Even though Orthodox Christians were made equal, Catholic Lithuanians were more prevalent in positions of powers.\n\nOn March 4, 1430, WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo issued the JedlnenÌski Privilege that confirmed the rights and privileges of the nobility to be exempt from taxes other than the two grosze per field tax. It made WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅo pay for the return of knights who were taken prisoner, and it also blocked foreigners from being in positions of power. Polish law was to be applied to Red Ruthenia. The privilege stated the following famous phrase, \"neminem captivabimus nisi iure victum\" (âwe shall not arrest anyone without a court verdictâ). The nobility in return promised to recognize WÅadysÅaw II JagieÅÅoâs son, WÅadysÅaw, as king after he died. In 1433, these terms were confirmed again in KrakoÌw."
