        "text": "I was recently delving into historical interactions between the Vikings and Slavs, and came across an interesting yet largely overlooked character, named Swietoslava. Before I begin telling her story, I would like to apologise in advance for any spelling errors (I’m not Slavic myself, and there are various different spellings within my sources!) and any mistakes made with regards to the tale itself; there is a fair amount of conflicting information, so I’ll do my best!\n\nBorn around 970 AD in Poznan (Poland), Swietoslava Piast Mieszkówna was the daughter of Mieszko I, Duke of Poland, and his wife Doubravka of Bohemia (an ancient kingdom which was once located in what is now known as Czech Republic).\n\nLittle is known about Swietoslava’s early years, but during adulthood she was actually quite famous, for both her relationships and her fiery temperament!\n\nSlavic and Scandinavian relations had been very friendly for at least a few decades prior to the Princess’ birth, with some historians believing that her father’s lineage may have featured some Norse blood (although of course this is practically impossible to prove). Some German historians also came up with a theory: that Mieszko’s name – meaning ‘bear’ in Polish – may be linked to the Scandinavian name Björn, which has the same meaning. I’m not entirely sure how legitimate that theory is, though!\n\nSome definitive proof of Norse-Slav interaction exists, within a document called The Dagome Index – the first known document relating to the country of Poland. ‘Dagome’ is a Scandinavian name, used within the document to address Mieszko I.\n\nBut anyway, back to the main story…\n\nIn 980, Swietoslava married King Erik VI of Sweden, and bore his son Olav Skotkunung (who later followed in his father’s footsteps by also becoming a King of Sweden). Sadly, Swietoslava was widowed shortly afterwards.\n\nIn around 994, she remarried – this time to the infamous Viking, King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark. She also appears to have changed her name temporarily to ‘Gunhilda’ for the purpose of this marriage, although it’s not clear why. During her time with Sweyn, she gave birth to five children, including Canute the Great and Harold II of Denmark.\n\nUnfortunately, for reasons unknown (her restless, explosive temperament perhaps?) Swietoslava became unhappy in her marriage to Sweyn. She returned to Poland, which was now under the rule of her brother Boleslav the Brave – the first official Polish monarch. What Swietoslava got up to during her time back in her homeland is unknown, but after her estranged husband’s death, her sons Canute and Harold travelled there to retrieve her.\n\nCanute later went on to become King of England, Denmark and Norway, as well as governor of Schleswig and Pomerania; Harold also became a ruler of Denmark.\n\nSwietoslava was said to have inherited her ‘difficult character’ from her paternal aunt, Adelajda (mother of St Stephen the Great – the first King of Hungary). Adelajda was known as a beauty who drank excessively, and loved to ride horses astride like a man. She was even rumoured to have murdered a man during one of her apparently frequent rages! So, one can imagine the sort of character her niece Swietoslava possessed!\n\nSwietoslava must have been somewhat renowned, as she actually features in the Icelandic Sagas!\n\nBefore I recount the story described in ‘Heimskringla’ (one of the Sagas, written by Snorri Sturluson) it is important to point out the following:\n\n1. The Sagas were written centuries after the events described took place, so there are bound to be some inaccuracies.\n\n2. Swietoslava was only identified as the real ‘Sigrid the Haughty’ due to correlations between hers and ‘Sigrid”s story (for example, they both were married to King Erik VI and Sweyn Forkbeard, both had a child named Olav, and both stories feature the name ‘Gunhild’, etc.)\n\nAccording to Wikipedia:\n\nHeimskringla describes Sigrid as the beautiful but vengeful daughter of Skogul-Tosti, a powerful Swedish nobleman. As widow of Eric the Victorious, she held many great estates, and was living with her son Olav the Swede, when her foster-brother Harald Grenske, a king in Vestfold, sought her hand. She had him and another royal wooer, Vissavald of Gardarik, burned to death in a great hall following a feast to discourage other suitors. This episode earned her her byname.\n\nHer hand was next sought by Olaf Tryggvasson, the king of Norway, but he would have required that she convert to Christianity. She told him to his face, “I will not part from the faith which my forefathers have kept before me”. In a rage, Olaf struck her with a glove, and Sigrid calmly told him, “This may some day be thy death”. Sigrid then proceeded to create a coalition of his enemies to bring about his downfall. She allied Sweden with Denmark, marrying the widower Sweyn Forkbeard who had already been feuding with Olaf. Sweyn had sent his sister Tyri to marry the Wendish king Burislav, who had been the father of Sweyn’s first wife, Gunhild. Tyri fled and married Olaf, goading him into conflict with her brother, while Sigrid inflamed Sweyn against her former suitor. This shared animosity would lead to the Battle of Swold, in which Olaf fell. Snorri also claims that Estrid Svendsdatter was a paternal sister of Cnut the Great, and as a daughter of Sigrid was maternal sister to Olav the Swede, but in another place says that Estrid was a daughter of Gunhild of Wenden.\n\nThe Danish historian Saxo Grammaticuswould repeat this information, writing that Eric the Victorious’ widow Syritha had married Sweyn Forkbeard after having spurned Olaf Trygvasson.\n\nOne further point that has been cited in favor of Sigrid’s historical existence is that the holdings of the Danish kings in medieval Sweden were known as “Syghridslef” – ‘the legacy of Sigrid’.\n\n* Note: ‘Wendish’ = denoting someone who hailed from lands occupied by the Wends, people who historically populated Western Slavic lands. Boruslav was given the pan-Scandinavian title ‘King of the Wends’, meaning that he had sovereignty, lordship or claims over Wendish lands. Wends would have inhabitated areas of Poland, where Swietoslava was born. Boruslav sounds like he could have been Boleslav (her brother)! According to legend, there WAS a Polish princess called Gunhild of Wenden who was also wife of Sweyn Forkbeard. Apparently, Mieszko was a pagan until his wife Doubravka made him convert to Christianity so that they could marry (obviously this could tie in with the conversion part of the Saga)… Coincidence? I personally think not!\n\nDespite many obvious inaccuracies, there are plenty of details in Heimskringla which could easily be describing Swietoslava. I definitely believe that she was an inspiration for the character of ‘Sigrid the Haughty’! Although of course many people could have been mixed into this legend.\n\nIt seems that Swietoslava died in 1126 – making her extremely old compared to the average life expectancy of 40 at the time! She was married to her third husband, Vratislaus II of Bohemia (and thus the first Queen of Bohemia) until she was widowed in 1092.\n\nAlthough we know so little about the mysterious Slavic Viking Princess, her bloodline lives on in notable living descendants, including the British Royal Family! She sounds exactly like the kind of woman ‘Shieldmaiden’ legends stemmed from!\n\nAn artist’s impression of Swietoslava from the 1800s."
