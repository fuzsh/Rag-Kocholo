        "text": "Bohemia (Čechy / Böhmen) is the westernmost and largest historical region of the Czech lands in the present-day Czech Republic. In a broader meaning, Bohemia sometimes refers to the entire Czech territory, including Moravia and Czech Silesia, especially in a historical context, such as the Lands of the Bohemian Crown ruled by Bohemian kings.\n\nBohemia was a duchy of Great Moravia, later an independent principality, a kingdom in the Holy Roman Empire, and subsequently a part of the Habsburg Monarchy and the Austrian Empire.After World War I and the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state, Bohemia became a part of Czechoslovakia. Between 1938 and 1945, border regions with sizeable German-speaking minorities of all three Czech lands were joined to Germany as the Sudetenland.\n\nThe remainder of Czech territory became the Second Czechoslovak Republic and was subsequently occupied as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, In 1969, the Czech lands (including Bohemia) were given autonomy within Czechoslovakia as the Czech Socialist Republic. In 1990, the name was changed to the Czech Republic, which become a separate state in 1993 with the dissolution of Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn 1147, Vladislav accompanied King Conrad on the Second Crusade, but halted his march at Constantinople and subsequently returned On his way back to Bohemia, he passed through Kiev and Kraków.\n\nIn return for military support against free northern Italian cities (especially Milan) for the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, Vladislav was elected king of Bohemia on 11 January 1158. He thus became the second Bohemian king to boast the royal dignity after Vratislaus II.\n\nHe was also invested with Upper Lusatia at Regensburg and his coronation was celebrated in a second ceremony at Milan on 8 September. Vladislav was a firm ally of the emperor Frederick. He duly accompanied him to Milan in 1158. During the Italian expeditions of 1161, 1162, and 1167, Vladislav entrusted the command of the Czech contingent to his brother Duke Děpold I of Jamnitz and his son Frederick.\n\nOf Vladislav II is said that he had an eagle in his shield when participating in the Second Crusade but on a fresco in Znojmo he is represented with a shield of a more common design with a large buckle and a border.\n\nDuke Vratislav II, 1142\n\nFresco in the Tower of St. Catherine, Znojmo\n\nOn his head a crown and in his right hand a lily-sceptre. With his left hand supporting a large norman shield with green bordure and large buckle, a two coloured banner (white and red?) of three lappets.\n\nOther warriors in Znojmo\n\nRoyal seals 1169\n\nIn 1197 Otakar forced his brother, duke Vladislav III Jindřich, to abandon Bohemia to him and to content himself with Moravia. Taking advantage of the German civil war between the Hohenstaufen claimant Philip of Swabia and the Welf candidate Otto IV, Ottokar declared himself King of Bohemia. This title was supported by Philip of Swabia who needed Czech military support against Otto (1198).\n\nIn 1199 he divorced his wife, Adelheid of Meissen, a member of the Wettin (dynasty) for a marriage with Constance of Hungary, the young daughter of the Hungarian King Bela III.\n\nIn 1200 - with Otto IV in the ascendancy, Otakar abandoned his pact with Philip and declared for the Welf faction. Both Otto IV and Pope Innocent III subsequently accepted Otakar as hereditary King of Bohemia. (In 1203 and 1204 respectively).\n\nPhilip's consequent invasion of Bohemia was successful. Otakar, having been compelled to pay a fine, again ranged himself among Philip's partisans and still later was among the supporters of the young king, Frederick II. In 1212 Frederick granted the Golden Bull of Sicily to Bohemia. This document recognised Otakar and his heirs as Kings of Bohemia. The King was no longer subject to appointment by the Emperor, and was only required to attend Diets close to the Bohemian border. Although a subject of the Holy Roman Empire, the Bohemian King was to be the leading electoral prince of the empire and to furnish all subsequent Emperors with a bodyguard of 300 knights when they went to Rome for their coronation.\n\n1199 Arms: eagle[1]\n\nPřemysl Ottokar I., from 1198 King of Bohemia, ordered a new seal, entirely in the intentions of his royal predecessors: it is a seal of majesty on the averse and of St. Wenceslas on the reverse. The averse imitated the contemporary emperor's seals of Byzantine style, with the motto: X PAX REGIS PREMIZL IN MANV SANCTI WENCEZLAI. The image of St. Wenceslas depicted on the reverse was only a simpler version of the figure depicted on the averse but with the attributes of the patron saint. In the legend are the name and ducal title of the patron saint of the Přemyslid dynasty. The structure of this seal underlines the importance of the royal dignity, and the higher Přemysl Ottokar I tended with his ambitions, the more magnificent his seals became. In the course of his reign, the seal stamp has been changed several times, but the basic scheme has not changed, only the more perfect engraving corresponds to the rising power of the Bohemian king and the majesty of the governing Přemysliden.

According to popular oral tradition, he was profoundly shocked by his brother's death and did not involve himself in politics, becoming focused on hunting and drinking. As new heir, his father appointed him Margrave of Moravia and Ottokar took his residence in Brno, where he was occupied with the reconstruction of the Moravian lands devastated by Mongol raids.\n\nIn 1248 he was enticed by discontented nobles to lead a rebellion against his father King Wenceslaus. During this rebellion he was elected the younger King (mladí král) on 31 July 1248 and temporarily expelled his father from Prague Castle. Přemysl Ottokar II held the title of King of Bohemia until November 1249. However, he was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV, whereafter Wenceslaus finally managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son at Přimda Castle.\n\nFather and son were eventually reconciled to assist the king's aim of acquiring the neighbouring Duchy of Austria, where the last Babenberg duke Frederick II had been killed in the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River. King Wenceslaus had initially attempted to acquire Austria by marrying his heir, Vladislav, to the last dukes niece Gertrude of Babenberg. That match had been cut short by Vladislav's death and Gertrude's remarriage to the Zähringen margrave Herman VI of Baden. The latter was rejected by the Austrian nobility and could not establish his rule. Wenceslaus used this as pretext to invade Austria when Herman died in 1250 - according to some sources, the estates called upon him to restore order.\n\nWenceslaus released Přemysl Ottokar very soon and in 1251 again made him Margrave of Moravia and installed him, with the approval of the Austrian nobles, as governor of Austria. The same year Ottokar entered Austria, where the estates acclaimed him as Duke. To legitimize his position, Přemysl Ottokar married the late Duke Frederick IIs sister Margaret of Babenberg, who was his senior by 30 years and the widow of the Hohenstaufen king Henry (VII) of Germany. Their marriage took place on 11 February 1252 at Hainburg.\n\nMarkgrave of Moravia 1247-1278\n\nCounter King 1248-1249; 1251-1253\n\nEquestrian Seal 1251\n\nArms: Lion:\n\nLegend.: X PREMIZL DEI  GRACIA  IUVENIS  REX  BOEMORUM.\n\nIn 1251 Ottokar occupied Austria and Stiria which Frederick II had taken back after the death of Duke Frederik. In 1252 he married the widow of Roman King Henry VII, Margarethe of Babenberg.\n\nKing of Bohemia 1253-1278\n\nIn 1253, King Wenceslaus died and Přemysl Ottokar succeeded his father as King of Bohemia. After the death of the German King Conrad IV in 1254 while his son Conradin was still a minor, Ottokar also hoped to obtain the Imperial dignity  as King of the Romans - for himself. However, his election bid was unsuccessful and Count William II of Holland, the German anti-king since 1247, was generally recognised.\n\n1253 After the death of his father he continued the alliance with the Hohenstaufen but he opposed the election of Conradin as a Roman King\n\n1270 ca Arms: Gules, a double queued lion Argent crowned Or.\n\nLegend: le Roy de boeme. [10]\n\nSeal of the Kingdom of Bohemia, 1429-32\n\nArms: Bohemia\n\nLegend: SIGILLUM CORONE REGNI BOHEMIE\n\nSigismund was a titulary King of Bohemia after the death of his brother Wenceslas in 1419 but he could not effectuate his claim because of the opposition and revolt of the Hussites until 1436. He was in fact but only one year King of Bohemia. Nevertheless he bore, as a son of Charles IV, the arms of Bohemia which can be considered as his family arms as he tried to be a king of Bohemia by right of his father and brother. After his marriage with Mary of Hungary in 1385 he also bore the arms of Arpad as a family arms even when he was not related at all with the Anjous who bore these arms by right of Charles Martel. The impaled of Arpad-Bohemia was also inherited by his grandson Ladislas Posthumus.\n\nThe State Seal With seals we will meet especially on very special and important envelopes, diplomas and awards, and it is in extraordinary cases\n\nThe Bohemian Revolt\n\nWithout heirs, Emperor Matthias sought to assure an orderly transition during his lifetime by having his dynastic heir (the fiercely Catholic Ferdinand of Styria, later Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor) elected to the separate royal thrones of Bohemia and Hungary. Some of the Protestant leaders of Bohemia feared they would be losing the religious rights granted to them by Emperor Rudolf II in his Letter of Majesty (1609). They preferred the Protestant Frederick V, elector of the Palatinate (successor of Frederick IV, the creator of the Protestant Union). However, other Protestants supported the stance taken by the Catholics, and in 1617, Ferdinand was duly elected by the Bohemian Estates to become the crown prince, and automatically upon the death of Matthias, the next king of Bohemia.\n\nThe king-elect then sent two Catholic councillors (Vilem Slavata of Chlum and Jaroslav Borzita of Martinice) as his representatives to Prague Castle in Prague in May 1618. Ferdinand had wanted them to administer the government in his absence. On 23 May 1618, an assembly of Protestants seized them and threw them (and also secretary Philip Fabricius) out of the palace window, which was some 21 m off the ground. Although injured, they survived. This event, known as the (Second) Defenestration of Prague, started the Bohemian Revolt. Soon afterward, the Bohemian conflict spread through all of the Bohemian Crown, including Bohemia, Silesia, Upper and Lower Lusatia, and Moravia. Moravia was already embroiled in a conflict between Catholics and Protestants. The religious conflict eventually spread across the whole continent of Europe, involving France, Sweden, and a number of other countries.\n\nThe death of Emperor Matthias emboldened the rebellious Protestant leaders, who had been on the verge of a settlement. The weaknesses of both Ferdinand (now officially on the throne after the death of Emperor Matthias) and of the Bohemians themselves led to the spread of the war to western Germany. Ferdinand was compelled to call on his nephew, King Philip IV of Spain, for assistance.\n\nThe Bohemians, desperate for allies against the emperor, applied to be admitted into the Protestant Union, which was led by their original candidate for the Bohemian throne, the Calvinist Frederick V, Elector Palatine. The Bohemians hinted Frederick would become King of Bohemia if he allowed them to join the Union and come under its protection. However, similar offers were made by other members of the Bohemian Estates to the Duke of Savoy, the Elector of Saxony, and the Prince of Transylvania, Gabor Bethlen. The Austrians, who seemed to have intercepted every letter leaving Prague, made these duplicities public.This unraveled much of the support for the Bohemians, particularly in the court of Saxony. In spite of these issues surrounding their support, the rebellion initially favoured the Bohemians. They were joined in the revolt by much of Upper Austria, whose nobility was then chiefly Lutheran and Calvinist. Lower Austria revolted soon after, and in 1619, Count Thurn led an army to the walls of Vienna itself. Moreover, within the British Isles, Frederick V's cause became seen as that of Elizabeth Stuart, described by her supporters as \"The Jewell of Europe\",leading to a stream of tens of thousands of volunteers to her cause throughout the course of the Thirty Years' War. In the opening phase, an Anglo-Dutch regiment under Horace Vere headed to the Palatinate, a Scots-Dutch regiment under Colonel John Seton moved into Bohemia, and that was joined by a mixed \"Regiment of Brittanes\" (Scots and English) led by the Scottish Catholic Sir Andrew Gray.Seton's regiment was the last of the Protestant allies to leave the Bohemian theatre after tenaciously holding the town of Třeboň until 1622, and only departing once the rights of the citizens had been secured."
