        "text": "Pupils from secondary schools in Poland (located in municipalities with the population under 100 000) searched for 3 weeks links between Poland and Norway. For what purpose? The answer is simple – to learn more about connecting elements of two – seemingly – different nations. And also to have a possibility to meet Norway peers during their educational visit to Warsaw. The Polish-Norwegian Educational competition „On the trail” organized by Ministry of Investments and Development ended March 7th 2018. The contest task was not the simplest: pupils divided into teams of seven along with the counsellor-teacher, had to find and present tracks in Polish history, culture. art, science, tradition, with Norwegian aspects (or vice versa) or sites important for Poland and Norway. The goal was to stimulate interest in relations of Poland and Norway in various areas.\n\nSygryda Storrada, the battle for Narvik or Stanisław Przybyszewski? Video materials sent by participants for the contest presented various links between Poland and Norway. The widest audience admired a figure of Świętosława, daughter of Mieszko I, who married kind of Norway and is known as Sygryda Storrada. Another often presented motif was the historical battle for Narvik. There were very original works among those submitted for the contest: group from Suwałki combined history of rocks in their region with glacier from Norway, while pupils from Polish-Norwegian Friendship School in Ostrzeszów demonstrated that the name of school obliges!\n\nYoung people looking for inspiration in own regions discovered unusual places, in which Polish and Norwegian motifs are being mixed up. i.a. Wang Temple, while group from Augustów (First High School in Augustów) used local climate for reproduction of atmosphere in northern Norway."
