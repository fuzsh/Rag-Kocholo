        "text": "Sigrid the Haughty also known as Sigríð Storråda was Queen Consort of the North Sea Empire, (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and England) from her marriage to Erik the Victorious, though Sigrid may have actually been married to Sweyn Forkbeard.\n\nSigrid's existence is widely disputed, Sigrid may have actually been a Polish Princess named Świętosława of Poland or possibly Sigrid could have been another Pole named Gunhilda of Wenden. It also is possible Sigrid, Gunhilda or Świętosława had not existed, and Erik married Aud Haakonsdottir.\n\nSigrid probably died in Norway, her daughter Estrid continued Sigrid's legacy by having a son who became future king of the Danes."
