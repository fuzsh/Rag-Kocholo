        "text": "Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: Sveinn Haraldsson tjúguskegg [ˈswɛinː ˈhɑrˌɑldsˌson ˈtjuːɣoˌskeɡː]; Danish: Svend Tveskæg; 17 April 963 – 3 February 1014) was King of Denmark from 986 until his death, King of England for five weeks from December 1013 until his death, and King of Norway from 999/1000 until 1013/14. He was the father of King Harald II of Denmark, King Cnut the Great, and Queen Estrid Svendsdatter.\n\nKing of Denmark\n\nReign: 986 - 1014\n\nPredecessor: Harald Bluetooth\n\nSuccessor: Harald II\n\nKing of Norway\n\nReign: 999/1000 - 1013/14\n\nPredecessor: Olaf I\n\nSuccessor: Olaf II\n\nKing of the English\n\nReign: 1013 - 1014\n\nPredecessor: Æthelred the Unready\n\nSuccessor: Æthelred the Unready\n\nBorn: 17 April 963\n\nDenmark\n\nDied: 3 February 1014 (aged 50)\n\nGainsborough, Lincolnshire,\n\nEngland\n\nBurial: Roskilde Cathedral or St. Trinity in Lund\n\nSpouse: Świętosława of Poland.\n\nSigrid the Haughty.\n\nGunhild of Wenden.\n\nIssue:Harald II of Denmark.\n\nCnut the Great.\n\nEstrid Svendsdatter.\n\nGytha Svendsdatter.\n\nGunnhild Svendsdatter.\n\nSantslaue.\n\nThyra Svendsdatter.\n\nHouse: House of Denmark\n\nFather: Knut Danaást or Harald Bluetooth\n\nMother: Tove or Gunhild\n\n____________________________________\n\nŚwiętosława was a Polish princess, the daughter of Mieszko I of Poland and sister of Bolesław I of Poland, who married two Scandinavian kings. According to some chroniclers, this princess, whose name is not given, was married first to Eric the Victorious of Sweden and then to Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, giving the former a son, Olof, and the latter two sons, Harald and Cnut. Because a documented sister of Cnut seems to have borne the Polish name Świętosława, it has been speculated that this may also have been the name of their mother, the Polish princess of the chroniclers.\n\nSpouses: Eric the Victorious\n\nSweyn Forkbeard.\n\nIssue: Olof Skötkonung.\n\nCnut the Great.\n\nHarald II of Denmark.\n\nSantslaue.\n\nHouse: Piast\n\nFather: Mieszko I of Poland\n\nMother: Doubravka of Bohemia\n\n____________________________________\n\nSigrid the Haughty (Old Norse:Sigríðr (hin) stórráða), also known as Sigrid Storråda (Swedish), is a Scandinavian queen appearing in Norse sagas. Sigrid is named in several late and sometimes contradictory Icelandic sagas composed generations after the events they describe, but there is no reliable historical evidence correlating to her story as they describe her. She is reported by Heimskringla to have been wife of Eric the Victorious of Sweden, sought as wife by Olaf Tryggvasson, then married to Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, but elsewhere author Snorri Sturluson says that Sweyn was married to a different woman."
