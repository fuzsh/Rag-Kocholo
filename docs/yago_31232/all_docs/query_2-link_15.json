        "text": "Sigrid the Haughty, known variously as Sigríð stórráða, Świętosława and Saum-Aesa, (969 - 1014,) was the daughter of Mieszko I and sister of Boleslaw I of Poland, first the wife of Eric the Victorious, King of Sweden, then wed to Sveinn Forkbeard, the King of Denmark and later England, and famously refused a marriage proposal from Olaf Trygvasson, King of Norway. She was herself the mother of three Kings: Harald II of Denmark, Olof Skötkonung, King of Sweden, and Canute the Great King of Denmark, England, Norway and parts of Sweden.\n\nMarriage to Eric the Victorious[]\n\nEirick, King of Sweden, sought to ally himself with the Polish Prince Boleslav in order to secure the throne of Denmark and drive out its current King, Sveinn Forkbeard. To secure this marriage he was wed to Świętosława, Boleslav's sister, who bore him a son, Olof Skötkonung. Around this time that she began to be known as Sigrid, her Slavic name being unpronouncable by the Swedes. She would later divorce him and be given Gotland as a fief in compensation.\n\nSigrid's Refusal[]\n\nIn 988, it was proposed that Sigrid marry Olaf Trygvasson, the king of Norway, but on the condition that she convert to Christianity. She is said to have told Olaf to his face, \"I will not part from the faith which my forefathers have kept before me.\" In a rage, Olaf struck her. It is said that Sigrid then calmly told him, \"This may some day be thy death.\" For this refusal she became known as Sigrid the Haughty or Sigrid the Proud.\n\nSigrid succeeded in avoiding the marriage, and later created a coalition Olaf's enemies to bring about his downfall. She accomplished this by allying Sweden and Denmark against Norway.\n\nMarriage to Sveinn[]\n\nTo affect her plan, in 994 Sigrid was wed to Sveinn Forkbeard, King of Denmark, to whom she bore two sons: Harald II of Denmark and Canute the Great, and a daughter, also named Swiatoslawa. She achieved her purpose when Olaf fell fighting against Sweden and Denmark in the year 1000 during the Battle of Svolder. Queen Sigríd won her vengeance that day, for King Olaf saw his Norwegian forces defeated and he himself leapt into the sea to drown rather than face capture by his enemies.\n\n[]"
