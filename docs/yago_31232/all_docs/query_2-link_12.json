Their mother was probably the Christian wife of Mieszko I, Czech's princess, Dąbrówka.\n\nŚwiętosława first became a wife of king Erik Segersäll (Eric VI of Sweden) in 980 (or 985), but she became a widow soon.\n\nAfter 994 she married Svend Tveskæg (Sweyn I of Denmark) under the name Gunhild. From the second marriage she probably had five children, including Canute the Great and Harold II of Denmark. Since her marriage was not happy, she returned to Poland where her brother Boleslaw the Brave was ruling. After Sweyn died her sons, Kanut and Karald took her back from Poland. Kanut, known as Kanut the Great became later king of England, Denmark and Norway and governor of Schleswig and Pomerania. She died somewhere in English castle. In any event, Boleslaus I of Poland, the first king of Poland actually sent his troops to help Canute in his successful conquest of England, another sign of close relationships between Polish rulers and Vikings.\n\nIt is said that Świętosława's difficult character was inherited after her aunt Adelaide (Polish Adelajda) who was probably a sister of Mieszko I and also the wife of the Hungarian duke Geza. Adelaide became a mother of St. Stephen the Great (977-1038), who became the first king of Hungary and a saint.\n\nAdelaide was known as a beauty, but she drunk excessively and loved riding horses like a man. Once, she even killed a man in a rage.\n\nhttp://www.polishsite.us/index.php/history-and-people/middle-ages-a...\n\nhttp://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/POLAND.htm#MieszkoIdied992\n\n--- (soon after 967-). This is one of the possibilities for the origin of the first wife of Svend I King of Denmark, based solely on Thietmar who refers to the mother of \"filiis Suenni\" as \"Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successori eius\"[69]. Europäische Stammtafeln names her \"Šwiętosława [Gunhild] of Poland\", although there is no indication of the basis for this suggested Polish name, and states that she married firstly Erik \"Segersäll/the Victorious\" King of Sweden, as his second wife[70]. This latter suggestion is implausible as it would mean that both of King Erik's wives were in turn married to Svend King of Denmark, numerous primary sources attesting that the latter's second wife Sigrid \"Storråda/the Haughty\" was the widow of King Erik[71]. m ([988/90]%29 as his first wife, SVEND I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\" King of Denmark, son of HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark & his first wife Gunhild ([960]-Gainsborough 3 Feb 1014, bur in England, later removed to Roskilde).]\n\nGunhilda of Poland\n\nF, #102419, d. after 1014\n\nLast Edited=8 Jul 2005\n\nGunhilda of Poland is the daughter of Mieszko I, Duke of Poland and Dubrawka of Bohemia.
