        "text": "Written by Elzbieta Cherezinska Maya Zakrzewska-Pim (trans.)\n\nReview by Janice Ottersberg\n\nCovering the years between 997-1018, this Viking saga continues the story begun in The Widow Queen. Świętosława of the Duchy of Poland, the widow queen, is the standout character. She now wears her second crown as Queen of Denmark, married to King Sven. Her first husband, King Eric, ruled Sweden and left her a widow. But her true love is Olav, King of Norway. Marriages are forged to create alliances, and her sister was given to Olav. Their tumultuous love story continues in this second book, and throughout is the hope Świętosława and Olav will unite.\n\nThe kings of Sweden, Norway, and Denmark are principal characters in constantly shifting alliances, and their sea battle at Øresund marks a major turning point. Other battles rage across the Nordic kingdoms, England, Germany and the Holy Roman Empire, Poland, Kiev, and Hungary to gain thrones and territories. Treachery, treason, and revenge play a role; the Vikings with their majestic ships haunt the waters, terrorizing and plundering treasure near and far; and conflicts arise with the spread of Christianity opposing the old religions. It is the women who add richness and dimension to this novel. Świętosława has learned to gain power within the confines of her world, and being a widow with royal children places her in a better position in a man’s world.\n\nCherezińska blends fable and fact into this novel, which will leave the reader wanting to learn more about the brave and fierce women who influenced history. For readers who don’t enjoy reading through scenes of battles, Cherezińska is able to keep the reader under her spell with characters that are nuanced, multilayered, and fully alive. It is best to have read The Widow Queen for the character development and back stories. Both novels can be overwhelming with a multitude of characters and pages, but so very worth the time invested."
