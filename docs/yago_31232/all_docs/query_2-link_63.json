        "text": "I have read full article.\n\nI think that its author neglects many things.\n\nFirst - the large amount of scandinavian arms and other things found during archeologic research doesnt have to mean that there were many Scandinavians living in Poland but could as well mean that there was a lot of slavic communities trading with Scandinavia, what shouldnt be suprising consdering the fact that Scandinavians were as much known for viking excursions as for trading.\n\nSecond - it is well known fact today, that on the Baltic sea there were many Slavs engaged in piracy, and that those Slavic pirates were plundering scandinavian shores.\n\nFrom:\n\nJOMSBORG VIKINGS HIRD | Korzenie\n\nSome of the Danish islands were attacked by Slavic pirates so often, that they have been depopulated at the end; later they have been settled again by Slavs from Pomerania. Danish invasions (with distinctly repressive character), like this from year 1043, shows that Vends (Slavs) were not easy neighbours for the Vikings; at the same time, when Scandinavian Vikings pillaged the West Europe, they own territory was pillaged by Vends.\n\nIn the book The Viking Art Of War (Chapter 'The Vikings and their neighbours), Paddy Griffith writes:\n\n\"To the south-east of Denmark lay the Wends (Vends) or the Slav tribes, who were in many ways just as effective raiders and traders as the Vikings themselves\".\n\n\"The Slavs were always under threat of attack from the Vikings as well as the Franks.\"\n\n\"They also gave as good as they got , in military terms, sacking Hedeby in 1000 and harrying Denmark, Gotland , Oland and southern Sweden to such an extent that the Western Baltic was sometimes called Mare Rugianorum after the Slavic pirates of Rugen. The prevalence of treasure-hoarding in southern Sweden during the 1000s has led modern archeologists to believe that the threat was indeed a very serious one, and the Icelandic sagas themselves often seem to assume that \"Vikings\" in the purely piratical sense were almost as likely to be Wends (Vends) as Scandinavians.\"\n\nThe next thing to consider which can prove strong ties between Scandinavian lands and Poland might be the presence of Poland and Polish rulers in Scandinavian saga's, which were the legends written in Iceland few centuries after the age of vikings. But those saga's dont say about Scandinavians in Poland but Poles who are engaged into scandinavian matters.\n\nIn those saga's Polish ruler is named Burizleif king of the Vinds or Vindland. He marries the daughter of Danish king while his own daughter marries the king of Denmark. (the second marriage is confirmed by history, the first not).\n\nAccording to saga's king of Poland played as well the role in killing the king of Norway Olaf Trygvasson.\n\nAs well, according to Saga's Polish king has subdued the sile of Wolin and the viking settlement of Jomsborg. Since that time Sigvalde, the jarl of Jomsborg was playing the role of Polish diplomat to the scandinavian kings.\n\nIt is also well confirmed by sources fact, that for the conquest of England king of Denmark Cnut the Great took few hundrieds wariors from Poland.\n\nAuthor claim that it is possible that many wariors from the retinue of Polish rulers were Scandinavians, while in the same Times, the Danish historians claim that big part of wariors in the army of king of Denmark were foreigners and probably Poles :\n\nHarold Bluetooth?s Vikings were Polish mercenaries\n\nI would like also to stress that German chronicles from those Times, describing Polish-German wars, dont mention the participation of Scandinavians in those wars.\n\nHowever it is a fact that many Scandinavians migrated to Poland. From tchem the most notable clan were Awdaniec family. They recived land from the Polish rulers and founded some new town and villages which got names that can be traced to old norse language like \"Wargawa\" from \"varg\" or \"Besiekiery\" from \"bersekir\".\n\nAnd lets looks into saga's:\n\n\"The Danish king, Svein Tjuguskeg, was married to Gunhild, a daughter of Burizleif, king of the Vinds..(..)...Burizleif, the king of the Vinds, complained to his relation Earl Sigvalde, that the agreement was broken which Sigvalde had made between King Svein and King Burizleif, by which Burizleif was to get in marriage Thyre, Harald's daughter, a sister of King Svein: but that marriage had not proceeded, for Thyre had given positive no to the proposal to marry her to an old and heathen king. \"Now,\" said King Burizleif to Earl Sigvalde, \"I must have the promise fulfilled.\" And he told Earl Sigvalde to go to Denmark, and bring him Thyre as his queen. Earl Sigvalde loses no time, but goes to King Svein of Denmark, explains to him the case; and brings it so far by his persuasion, that the king delivered his sister Thyre into his hands. With her went some female attendants, and her foster-father, by name Ozur Agason, a man of great power, and some other people. In the agreement between the king and the earl, it was settled that Thyre should have in property the possessions which Queen Gunhild had enjoyed in Vindland, besides other great properties as bride-gifts. Thyre wept sorely, and went very unwillingly. When the earl came to Vindland, Burizleif held his wedding with Queen Thyre, and received her in marriage; bus as long as she was among heathens she would neither eat nor drink with them, and this lasted for seven days...(...)...It happened one night that Queen Thyre and Ozur ran away in the dark, and into the woods, and, to be short in our story, came at last to Denmark. But here Thyre did not dare to remain, knowing that if her brother King Svein heard of her, he would send her back directly to Vindland. She went on, therefore, secretly to Norway, and never stayed her journey until she fell in with King Olaf, by whom she was kindly received.\"\n\nIt is not true that there are \"large-scale findings of Scandinavian weaponry\" found in Poland. Not findings, but one finding.\n\nThere is only one large archaeological finding with weaponry claimed to be Scandinavian (however, other scholars claim that it is Czech and Polish weaponry - Czech weaponry belonging to soldiers of Bretislaus I) - the one found on the bed of the Ostrów Lednicki Lake.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostr%C3%B3w_Lednicki\n\nhttp://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostrów_Lednicki\n\nOstrów Lednicki island (a stronghold was located there in the Early Medieval period), surrounded by lake:\n\nVideo showing the island and ruins of some Early Medieval stone buildings located there:\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUotvaRddl8\"]Muzeum Pierwszych PiastÃ³w na Lednicy - zwiastun - YouTube[/ame]\n\nDocumentary video (in Polish) about the Ostrów Lednicki stronghold:\n\nhttp://vod.tvp.pl/dokumenty/historia/wyspa-wladcow/wideo/wyspa-wladcow/8610807\n\nThe following amount of weapons was found on the bed of the Ostrów Lednicki Lake:\n\n- 7 swords\n\n- 159 axes\n\n- 60 spears\n\nIt is sometimes claimed that many of these weapons were of Scandinavian production.\n\nIt is the largest known so far single finding of Early Medieval weaponry in Poland - but still, it is only one finding, not multiple ones.\n\nSome historians claim that this weaponry sank there as a result of a battle which took place there (battle for the stronghold of Ostrów Lednicki). However, no skeletons of killed knights / warriors were found on the bed of the Ostrów Lednicki Lake. AFAIK, even among these historians who associate this finding with a battle, most connect it with Czech invasion of Greater Poland by Bretislaus I which took place in 1038.\n\nBut if it was a battle, then why weaponry was left there, while no skeletons were found (= corpses were removed)?\n\nSome historians claim that it could be a kind of a \"cemetery for weapons\" or some kind of \"weapon sacrifice for Pagan gods\", IIRC.\n\nThe tribes along Baltic shore were famed for raiding and there were certainly Polish mercenaries serving Danish kings and Swedes serving as mercenaries in parts of Poland.\n\nYes, there was trade between Scandinavia and Poland. So Polish warriors could use Scandinavian weapons. There were Polish and other West Slavic warriors serving in Scandinavian armies. There could be also some Scandinavian mercenaries serving in Polish armies. I have seen an article about \"Heroic last stand of the Vikings in service of the Polish king in Ostrów Lednicki stronghold against Bohemian hordes in 1038.\"\n\n==================================\n\nPhoto showing some of axes and spears found in the Ostrów Lednicki Lake:\n\nTypology of some of axes found in the Ostrów Lednicki Lake:\n\nSimilar long axes can be seen on the Bayeux Tapestry (which does not mean that Normans lived in Poland ):\n\nBTW - are these guys below Norman axemen or Anglo-Saxon axemen?:\n\nHowever for other types of metal working Scandinavia was well known, particularly swords.\n\nOk, I agree - but does it mean that Vikings were using mostly weapons of Scandinavian production?\n\nI never even heard of this! I figured it was the Lithuanians who received Christianity from Poland?\n\nBecause of the lack of sources and because some existing sources are not clear, the whole story remains just a theory.\n\nWhat we know is that sister of king Bolesław the Brave of Poland married king of Denmark Svein the Forkbeard. But there is a high probability that it was already her second marriage and that her first husband was king of Sweden Eric the Victorous. After his death she might have come back to Poland and next married Svein from Denmark.\n\nThis is why she is somtimes named \"The mother of kings\". Her real Polish name was probably Świętosława, In Scandinavia she was probably called Sigrid, in English historigraphy she is known as Gunhild the Polish.\n\nSo it would mean that her sons were both Knut/Cnut/Canute the Great king of Denmark and England as well as king of Sweden Olof Skötkonung.\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigrid_the_Haughty\"]Sigrid the Haughty - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia[/ame]\n\nThere is a theory that Swedish king wanted to christianise Sweden but he didnt want to get christianity from the Danes nor from the Germans, because it would make the church organisation of Sweden dependant from the Danish King or German emperor. So together with Sigrid the king of Poland sent to Sweden missionares who started converting Sweden.\n\nExactly in the same way Poland adopted christianity from Bohemia, to avoid the German influences and as well Czech princess who married Polish ruler played the important part in it.\n\nFrom wikipedia:\n\nThere is scant material in medieval chronicles to provide details regarding the marriages of Swein of Denmark and Erik of Sweden:\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thietmar_of_Merseburg\"]Thietmar of Merseburg[/ame] mentions that the daughter of [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mieszko_I_of_Poland\"]Mieszko I of Poland[/ame] and sister of [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boleslaw_I_of_Poland\"]Boleslaw I of Poland[/ame] married Sweyn Forkbeard and gave him two sons, [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canute_the_Great\"]Canute the Great[/ame] and [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_II_of_Denmark\"]Harold II of Denmark[/ame], but he does not mention her name. Thietmar is probably the best informed of the medieval chroniclers addressing the question, since he was contemporary with the events described and well-informed about the events in Poland and [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark\"]Denmark[/ame]. The assertion that Harald's and Canute's mother was Boleslaw's sister may explain some mysterious statements which appear in medieval chronicles, such as the involvement of Polish troops in invasions of England.\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_of_Bremen\"]Adam of Bremen[/ame] writes almost a century later that a Polish princess - the sister or daughter of [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boleslaw_I_of_Poland\"]Boleslaw I of Poland[/ame] - was the wife of [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_the_Victorious\"]Eric the Victorious[/ame] and by this marriage the mother of Olof Skötkonung of Sweden, before she became mother of [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canute_the_Great\"]Canute the Great[/ame] and [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_II_of_Denmark\"]Harold II of Denmark[/ame] in her second marriage with Sweyn. Adam's claims about the marriage to Eric are considered unreliable by many historians, since he is the only source to state this relationship and because he is writing several generations later. The scholia of [ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesta_Hammaburgensis_ecclesiae_pontificum\"]Gesta Hammaburgensis Ecclesiae Pontificum[/ame] mentions that it was the Polish king Boleslaw who gave the princess' hand in marriage. One problem is that Olof was born in the early 980´s, before Boleslaw Chrobry came to power, and therefore was too old to be the unnamed princess´s son.\n\n[ame=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesta_Cnutonis_regis\"]Gesta Cnutonis regis[/ame] mentions in one short passage that Canute and his brother went to the land of the Slavs, and brought back their mother, who was living there. This does not necessarily mean that his mother was Slavic, but nevertheless this chronicle strongly suggests that she was."
