        "text": "Gunhilda von Wenden\n\n​\n\nGunhilda is the weakest possibility of the three options and has been considered to be the same person as Princess Świętosława, especially since her parents are also thought to be Duke Mieszko I of Poland and Duchess Doubravka of Bohemia. If it is the case that these two women are indeed one and the same, it is possible that Świętosława was given the new name of Gunhilda upon her marriage to King Eric of Sweden. Royal wives often had to change their names to fit in with their new peoples if they married into another country and the names did not always have similarities, so it is not a far-fetched idea. However, something that throws a spanner into the works of this argument is that she is also referred to as the daughter of Burislav, of the German region of Wenden.\n\nAs we have already looked at the story of Princess Świętosława, and Gunhilda's would be no different if they are to be considered to be the same person, this section of the page we will look at Gunhilda von Wenden's story.\n\nSnorri Sturluson is a famous Icelandic historian and poet of the 12-13th centuries and his collection of sagas, known as the Eddas, are where we get most of our knowledge on the story of Gunhilda. It was in his works that we see claims of Gunhilda's German background. It is said that King Sweyn of Denmark and Norway was captured after a failed attack on the Jomsvikings, an elite group of Viking mercenaries who would fight for anyone willing to pay them. King Sweyn was given to the Gunhilda's father, Burislav, King of Wenden.\n\nIt is unknown who the Jomsvikings were fighting for at the time, but it is possible that they were under the command of the King of Wenden himself at the time. This is only speculation based on the fact that Sweyn was handed over to Burislav and negotiations were held after this. One does not tend to negotiate with a gifted prisoner and the Jomsvikings would most likely have offered the prisoner to whomever was paying their wage at that time.\n\nThe two Kings negotiated with one another, which resulted in a trade of brides; King Sweyn would wed Gunhilda and King Burislav would wed Sweyn's sister Tyri.\n\nFrom this point on, Gunhilda's story merges entirely with that of Princess Świętosława. She married King Sweyn and bore him two sons, Cnut and Harald.\n\nHowever, this account of a dual marriage alliance also links in with the story of the third possible woman who may have been the mysterious wife of King Sweyn; the story mirrors that from the Heimskringla which details Sigrid's marriage.\n\nSigrid den Högmodiga\n\n​\n\nThe final possibility for this particular Queen of England is Sigrid den Högmodiga, or Sigrid \"the Haughty\", also known as Sigrid Storråda, who appears as a character in the Norse sagas. Each of her appearances in these sagas seem to contradict one another and they were all recorded long after the events they detail. In addition, the Norse sagas contained a heavy amount of fiction and mythology within their tales. Thus, we cannot rely on this as a credible historical source, so take this option with a grain of salt.\n\nSigrid is mostly known as \"Sigrid the Haughty\", but has also been named as \"Sigrid the Proud\" in the 12th century saga, Yngvars saga Víòförla, and \"Sigrid the Ambitious\" in the genealogical appendix to Hervarar Saga ok Heiõreks, though this specific appendix was not found contained within earlier surviving copies of this manuscript, so this may have been a later addition.\n\nAs with the previous two offerings, Sigrid was said to be the wife first of King Eric \"the Victorious,\" however her story differs a little at this point. Some stories suggest that after King Eric's death, Sigrid was sought after by Olaf Tryggvason, as a wife, prior to her second marriage to King Sweyn. Olaf was the King of Norway until his death at the end of the 10th century, when Sweyn added Norway to his Kingdoms. Other stories, such as the 12th century saga, Yngvars saga Víòförla, suggest that Sigrid's marriage to King Eric did not end at his death, but earlier. This source states that King Eric chose to separate from his wife due to her undesirable moods. The saga claims that Sigrid was the \"most quarrelsome woman there ever was.\" In this version of events Sigrid was given the region of Götaland, in the South of Sweden, as part of the separation settlement.\n\nThe Sigrid of this tale was said to have given Eric one son, known as Olaf the Swede, though there is no mention of Holmfrid or Emund that I could find.\n\nSigrid also makes several appearances in Snorri Sturluson's later sagas of the 13th century. In these sagas Sigrid was said to be the daughter of a rich Swede named Skolgar Toste. In keeping with previous appearances she was said to be young, fair and haughty. This Sigrid married King Eric of Sweden and bore a son, Olaf the Swede.\n\nSnorri's next tale of Sigrid jumps forward in her story and places her as the wealthy widow of Eric \"the Victorious.\" In opposition to her other appearances however, in this tale the Queen Dowager Sigrid is described as the \"wisest of women and prophetic about many things.\" As well as her character, Sigrid's suitors are also different in this tale. She was again offered an alternate proposal between her two marriages, but the one in this saga came from Harald Grenske, a man said to have been a Norwegian Prince, and Sigrid's foster brother. The story goes that as Queen Dowager and mother to King Olaf, Sigrid entertained Prince Harald when he visited her in Sweden. During his visit, Harald proposed a marriage between the two of them, but Sigrid refused as Harald already had a wife. - Please bear in mind that in medieval Scandinavian cultures, marriage was not formalised in the same way as it would become in Western Europe and taking two wives was not uncommon. - Harald pressured Sigrid and in doing so found that she had another suitor, this time King Vissavaldr of Garðaríki, a region in modern-day Russia. However, the Sigrid of this tale appears to have been rather exhausted with the idea of marriage, as her suitors would learn to their great misfortune.\n\nSigrid became known by a different name at this point; she became known as \"Sigrid of the Great Undertaking.\" This was due to the fact that she entertained both of her suitors, Harald and Vissavaldr, at the same time and had them housed together in the same building. In the night, she had their quarters set ablaze and ordered her guards to kill anyone who managed to escape the flames. In this way, she hoped to deter any further proposals of marriage from any man.\n\nHowever, later in that very same tale, Sigrid did receive another suitor, one from a previous saga, King Olaf Tryggvason of Norway. He must have been quite the charmer for she agreed to marry him. In spite of the successful wooing of Sigrid, the relationship was not a successful one. Sigrid received from her new husband a golden ring but upon passing it to her goldsmiths, she discovered that it was actually gold-plated brass, which angered her. This alone was not enough to demand the couple's separation, however.\n\nScandinavia had slowly converted to Christianity over the course of a few centuries, due to a number of Catholic missionaries. Denmark was first to be officially converted by 1104, Norway second by 1154 and Sweden was the last country to officially convert a decade later. According to the saga, Sigrid was commanded by her new Norwegian husband to convert to Christianity but she refused. For her refusal she was struck by King Olaf with a glove. Ever the fighter, Sigrid told him that this act could well cost him his life.\n\nAfter this, Sigrid and Olaf parted ways.\n\nThe next time we see Sigrid in this same saga is when Olaf returned to her, only to find that Sigrid had married King Sweyn \"Forkbeard,\" following the death of the latter's first wife, Gunhilda. This story ties in with the tale of Gundhilda von Wenden, as Sweyn's sister, Tyri, who was given to Gunhilda's father to wed in both tales, fled to Norway following her marriage and ended up marrying King Olaf Tryggvason. Both Queen Sigrid and Queen Tryi were said to have incited their respective husbands to wage war against each other, with this war resulting in the death of King Olaf.\n\nSigrid's varying inclusions in the Norse sagas are very interesting and the Sigrid featured in the sagas is thought to possibly be an amalgamation of several historical women and not a singular person. Regardless of whether she was based on historic fact or entirely a work of fiction, Sigrid left a mark on her Sweden; in medieval Sweden the holdings of the Kings were known as \"Syghridslef,\" or \"the Legacy of Sigrid.\"\n\nWho was the true Queen of King Sweyn?\n\n​\n\nIt has been suggested that Sigrid was the name adopted by a Polish Princess upon her marriage to King Eric of Sweden, which would offer the possibility of Sigrid and Świętosława being one and the same. Alternatively, as the saga composers may not have known, or been able to comprehend, a Slavic name, Sigrid may have simply been the name given to the Queen of Sweden at this time, which again offers the argument that the two women could be the same person.\n\nThe most likely scenario, given the stories we have reviewed, is that all three women, Świętosława, Gunhilda and Sigrid, are indeed one and the same person. While Sigrid's lineage was never concrete throughout the sagas, both Świętosława and Gunhilda were said to be a Polish Princess, and daughter of Duke Mieszko I of Poland and Duchess Doubravka of Bohemia. If this was the case, however, we face the issue that Gunhilda was also offered a second possible lineage. Aside from the parentage that matches that given to Świętosława, and possibly also attributed to Sigrid, Gunhilda was also given a German version of her ancestry. It is entirely possible that Gunhilda, daughter of King Burislav of Wenden, was a completely separate woman and was the first wife of King Eric of Sweden, before Świętosława married him, adopting the name Sigrid. If this is the truth of the matter then Gunhilda's story is mostly lost to history as she would not have gone on to wed King Sweyn of Denmark as she died prior to this marriage taking place.\n\nTherefore we are left with two plausible options:\n\nŚwiętosława, Gunhilda and Sigrid are all the same person and of Polish descent, making her the Queen of England during the short reign of King Sweyn\n\nGunhilda was a German Princess who was the first wife of King Eric, while Świętosława and Sigrid were one and the same, making Świętosława the true Queen of England beside King Sweyn.\n\nUnfortunately, we will never know the truth of this matter, but it is a very interesting mystery to investigate. Now that I have presented the varying tales of these women, I can say that my personal viewpoint is the second option, that Gunhilda von Wenden was a different woman to Świętosława z Polski/Sigrid. But I would be very interested to know your thoughts. What do you think of this mystery Queen of England? Which of these options, if any, do you think was the cryptic Queen of King Sweyn \"Forkbeard?\""
