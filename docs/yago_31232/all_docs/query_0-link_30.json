The events of those times, as recorded by a range of chroniclers, convey the figure of Mieszko I as a leader fighting alongside his brothers, with varying fortune, on the western borderlands of the state then emerging. Only one of those brothers is known by name – Czcibor – whereas about the other we know only that he died during a clash with Wichman, the exiled German graf (count). The few and laconic written sources we have do, however, bear witness to a dynasty that in only just a few years – most probably between 962 and 966 – expanded its realm from virtual non-existence into organizational and territorial greatness. Indeed, as the emissary from Cordoba, Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, writing in 965, noted, “[a]nd as concerns the country of Mieszko, his is the vastest of the Slavic countries”.\n\nWhat does modern archaeology tell us about these matters? To what degree can the discoveries made in various regions of Polish lands be acknowledged as sufficient?\n\nThese are but some of the many questions I shall try to answer on the pages of this monograph.\n\nsee also on:\n\nhttps://archeologia.com.pl/10-najwazniejszych-odkryc-polskiej-archeologii-2021/\n\nThis book is a source edition of the entries from the years 1485-1519 from the oldest book of the municipal council records of Pleszew (a private town in an old Polish province and district of Kalisz), which is stored in the Archiwum... more\n\nThis book is a source edition of the entries from the years 1485-1519 from the oldest book of the municipal council records of Pleszew (a private town in an old Polish province and district of Kalisz), which is stored in the Archiwum Państwowe w Poznaniu (National Archives of Poznan, Akta m. Pleszew, sig. I 2). It is a continuation of the source publications of T. Jurek (Najdawniejsze zapiski z księgi miejskiej Pleszewa 1428-1444, Poznań 2011) and W. Maisel (Prawo magdeburskie miasta Pleszewa, Studia i Materiały do Dziejów Wielkopolski i Pomorza 8(1): 1963, pp. 67-82), which included pp. 1-23, 89-97, 268, and 269 of the manuscript of the book. The book also covers the edition of the entries inscribed on pp. 23-88 of the same manuscript dating from 1485-1519, which are accompanied by three chronologically proximate entries from pp. 97 and 98 (from years 1483 and 1493). The edition includes 128 Latin entries which effectively chronicles the activity of the municipal council of Pleszew, the composition of which was exceptionally completed by the representatives of the municipal tribunal or a margrave, representing the owner of the town. However, three entries derive from the ad hoc convened arbitration courts. The content of the part of the book covering the municipal council records, having been subject to editing, is relatively uniform and covers primarily the issue of dowry and dower, real estate property transfers, contracts of inheritance and succession matters. These entries relate mostly to the townspeople of Pleszew, but also the representatives of the nobility, the clergy and the peasantry who came from the nearby villages to stand before the court of the municipal council.\n\nThe publication includes the edition of the original Latin text of entries prepared on the basis of the draft instructions for publishing written historical sources to the mid-sixteenth century by A. Wolff (Projekt instrukcji wydawniczej dla pisanych źródeł historycznych do połowy XVI wieku, Studia Źródłoznawcze 1:1957, pp. 155-181) supplemented with their full translation into Polish. The Latin text is then transliterated, the use of u and v is standardised and noted by their phonetic value. Additionally, the use of capital letters and punctuation is also modernised. The fragments of text scored out in the manuscript base are indicated by the symbols |- -|, deleted entries are marked by the sign |= =|, and finally the words added on the margins or between the lines of the main text are contained in brackets < >. Words that are not fully clear to the editor are marked with a question mark [?], whereas to indicate the error or the\n\npeculiarities of the manuscript text an exclamation point [!] is used.\n\nPublishing is supplemented with indexes: of people and places (arranged by first names), subjects (including the nouns and verbs of the non-form part of the text) and the Polish word. The whole of the work is concluded with a chronological concordance.\n\nCasimir III the Great (Polish: Kazimierz III Wielki; 30 April 1310 – 5 November 1370) reigned as the King of Poland from 1333 to 1370.

He was the third son of King Władysław I (\"the Elbow-high\") and Duchess Jadwiga of Kalisz, and the last Polish king from the Piast dynasty.\n\nKazimierz inherited a kingdom weakened by war and made it prosperous and wealthy. He reformed the Polish army and doubled the size of the kingdom. He reformed the judicial system and introduced a legal code, gaining the title \"the Polish Justinian\". Kazimierz built extensively and founded the University of Kraków, the oldest Polish university. He also confirmed privileges and protections previously granted to Jews and encouraged them to settle in Poland in great numbers.\n\nKazimierz left no lawful male heir to his throne, producing only daughters. When Kazimierz died in 1370 from an injury received while hunting, his nephew, King Louis I of Hungary, succeeded him as king of Poland in personal union with Hungary.\n\nWhen Kazimierz attained the throne in 1333, his position was in danger, as his neighbours did not recognise his title and instead called him \"king of Kraków\". The kingdom was depopulated and exhausted by war, and the economy was ruined. In 1335, in the Treaty of Trentschin, Casimir was forced to relinquish his claims to Silesia \"in perpetuity\".\n\nKazimierz rebuilt and his kingdom became prosperous and wealthy, with great prospects for the future. He waged many victorious wars and doubled the size of the kingdom, mostly through addition of lands in modern-day Ukraine (then called the Duchy of Halych). Kazimierz built extensively during his reign, ordering the construction of over 40 castles, including many castles along the Trail of the Eagle's Nests, and he reformed the Polish army.\n\nAt the Sejm in Wiślica, on 11 March 1347, Kazimierz introduced reforms to the Polish judicial system and sanctioned civil and criminal codes for Great and Lesser Poland, earning the title \"the Polish Justinian\". He founded the University of Kraków, the oldest Polish University, and he organized a meeting of kings in Kraków in 1364 at which he exhibited the wealth of the Polish kingdom.\n\nSuccession\n\nIn 1355, in Buda, Kazimierz designated his nephew Louis I of Hungary as his successor should he produce no male heir, as his father had with Charles I of Hungary to gain his help against Bohemia. In exchange Kazimierz gained a favourable Hungarian attitude, needed in disputes with the hostile Teutonic Order and Kingdom of Bohemia. Kazimierz at the time was still in his early years and having a son did not seem to be a problem (he already had a few children).\n\nKazimierz left no legal son, however, begetting five daughters instead. He tried to adopt his grandson, Casimir IV, Duke of Pomerania, in his last will. The child had been born to his second daughter, Elisabeth, Duchess of Pomerania, in 1351. This part of the testament was invalidated by Louis I of Hungary, however, who had traveled to Kraków quickly after Kazimierz died and bribed the nobles with future privileges. Kazimierz III had a son-in-law, Louis VI of Bavaria, Margrave and Prince-elector of Brandenburg, who was considered a possible successor, but he was deemed ineligible as his wife, Kazimierz's daughter Cunigunde, had died in 1357 without issue.\n\nThus King Louis I of Hungary became successor in Poland. Louis was proclaimed king upon Kazimierz's death in 1370, though Kazimierz's sister Elisabeth (Louis's mother) held much of the real power until her death in 1380."
