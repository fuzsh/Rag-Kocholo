        "text": "Sweyn Forkbeard (Old Norse: Sveinn Haraldsson tjúguskegg [ˈswɛinː ˈhɑrˌɑldsˌson ˈtjuːɣoˌskeɡː]; Danish: Svend Tveskæg; 17 April 963 – 3 February 1014) was King of Denmark from 986 until his death, King of England for five weeks from December 1013 until his death, and King of Norway from 999/1000 until 1013/14. He was the father of King Harald II of Denmark, King Cnut the Great, and Queen Estrid Svendsdatter.\n\nKing of Denmark\n\nReign: 986 - 3 February 1014\n\nPredecessor: Harald Bluetooth\n\nSuccessor: Harald II\n\nKing of Norway\n\nReign: 999/1000 - 1013/1014\n\nPredecessor: Olaf I\n\nSuccessor: Olaf II\n\nKing of the English\n\nReign: 25 December 1013 - 3 February 1014\n\nPredecessor: Æthelred the Unready\n\nSuccessor: Æthelred the Unready\n\nBorn: 17 April 963\n\nDenmark\n\nDied: 3 February 1014 (aged 50)\n\nGainsborough, Lincolnshire,\n\nEngland\n\nBurial: Roskilde Cathedral or St Trinity in Lund\n\nSpouse: Świętosława of Poland\n\nSigrid the Haughty\n\nGunhild of Wenden\n\nIssue: Harald II, King of Denmark.\n\nCnut the Great, King of Denmark, Norway\n\nand England.\n\nEstrid Svendsdatter.\n\nGytha Svendsdatter.\n\nStanslaue.\n\nThyra Svendsdatter.\n\nHouse: Denmark\n\nFather: Knut Danaást or Harald Bluetooth\n\nMother: Tove or Gunhild\n\n__________________________________\n\nŚwiętosława of Poland was a Polish princess, the daughter of Mieszko I of Poland and sister of Bolesław I of Poland, who married two Scandinavian kings. According to some chroniclers, this princess, whose name is not given, was married first to Eric the Victorious of Sweden and then to Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, giving the former a son, Olof, and the latter two sons, Harald and Cnut. Because a documented sister of Cnut seems to have borne the Polish name Świętosława, it has been speculated that this may also have been the name of their mother, the Polish princess of the chroniclers.\n\nSpouse: Eric the Victorious\n\nSweyn Forkbeard\n\nIssue: Olof Skötkonung\n\nHarald II, King of Denmark.\n\nCnut the Great, King of Denmark, Norway\n\nand England.\n\nStantslaue.\n\nHouse: Piast\n\nFather: Mieszko I of Poland\n\nMother: Doubravka of Bohemia\n\n__________________________________\n\nSigrid the Haughty (Old Norse:Sigríðr (hin) stórráða), also known as Sigrid Storråda (Swedish), is a Scandinavian queen appearing in Norse sagas. Sigrid is named in several late and sometimes contradictory Icelandic sagas composed generations after the events they describe, but there is no reliable historical evidence correlating to her story as they describe her. She is reported by Heimskringla to have been wife of Eric the Victorious of Sweden, sought as wife by Olaf Tryggvasson, then married to Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark, but elsewhere author Snorri Sturluson says that Sweyn was married to a different woman.\n\nSpouse: Eric the Victorious\n\nSweyn Forkbeard\n\nIssue: Olof Skötkonung.\n\nEmund.\n\nEstrid Svendsdatter.\n\nFather: Skoglar Toste\n\n__________________________________\n\nGunhilda of Wenden Gunhilda of Wenden was a Polish princess, daughter of Mieszko I of Poland according to Chronicles of Thietmar of Merserburg, Adam von Bremen and Acta Cnutonis regis princess and Danish Viking Age queen consort, the supposed spouse of 10th-century King Sweyn I of Denmark (c. 960–1014). The sources about the wife or wives of Sweyn are contradictory (he is also said to have been married to Sigrid the Haughty), and historians have debated whether she is the Polish Świętosława given another name in Norse sources."
