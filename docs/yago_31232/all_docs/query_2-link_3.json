This is one of the possibilities for the origin of the first wife of Svend I King of Denmark, based solely on Thietmar who refers to the mother of \"filiis Suenni\" as \"Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successori eius\". Europäische Stammtafeln names her \"Šwiętosława [Gunhild] of Poland\", although there is no indication of the basis for this suggested Polish name, and states that she married firstly Erik \"Segersäll/the Victorious\" King of Sweden, as his second wife. This latter suggestion is implausible as it would mean that both of King Erik's wives were in turn married to Svend King of Denmark, numerous primary sources attesting that the latter's second wife Sigrid \"Storråda/the Haughty\" was the widow of King Erik. m ([988/90]) as his first wife, SVEND I \"Tveskæg/Forkbeard\" King of Denmark, son of HARALD I \"Blåtand/Bluetooth\" King of Denmark & his first wife Gunhild ([960]-Gainsborough 3 Feb 1014, bur in England, later removed to Roskilde).\n\nThis week's featured connections are Redheads: Gunhild is 17 degrees from Catherine of Aragón, 31 degrees from Clara Bow, 38 degrees from Julia Gillard, 28 degrees from Nancy Hart, 29 degrees from Rutherford Hayes, 30 degrees from Rita Hayworth, 32 degrees from Leonard Kelly, 29 degrees from Rose Leslie, 32 degrees from Damian Lewis, 33 degrees from Maureen O'Hara, 37 degrees from Jopie Schaft and 12 degrees from Eirik Thorvaldsson on our single family tree.
