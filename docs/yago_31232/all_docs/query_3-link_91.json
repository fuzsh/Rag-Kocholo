        "text": "Description The study examines the reflection of Přemyslid memory in the Saxon monastery of Pegau, founded in 1091 by Wiprecht of Groitzsch and his wife Judith, daughter of King of Bohemia Vratislaus II, in the pages of cloister annals (Annales Pegavienses). The detailed reports on the situation in Bohemia and in the Přemyslid dynasty testify that the unknown Benedictine had knowledgeable informers available. They included the second abbot of Pegau Windolf, who guided the congregation for fifty years and could provide not only memories of the members of the founder‘s family but also the Přemyslids themselves, chiefly dukes Bořivoj II and Soběslaus I, who used precisely the hospitality of Wiprecht of Groitzsch’s castle in close proximity to the Pegau monastery abundatly at the times of thein banishment. Special attention is devoted to the passages of the annals that describe how Vratislaus was raised by the royal title. Chronological inaccuracies are only perpetrated by the chronicler in those passages that adapt to the narration of chronicle of Frutolf of Michelsberg and his followers."
