Świętosława «Gunhilda» Mieszkówna of Poland (Księżniczka polska)

B.Brox: Don't mix her with Sigrid/Sigríð Storråda/the Haughty as several Wikipedia and other sources does.

http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiatoslawa_av_Polen

Świętosława (967-1014), known in Scandinavian sagas as Gunhild, was Mieszko's I daughter and the sister of the first Polish king Boleslav the Brave. Their mother was probably the Christian wife of Mieszko I, Czech's princess, Dąbrówka.

Świętosława first became a wife of king Erik Segersäll (Eric VI of Sweden) in 980 (or 985), but she became a widow soon.

After 994 she married Svend Tveskæg (Sweyn I of Denmark) under the name Gunhild. From the second marriage she probably had five children, including Canute the Great and Harold II of Denmark. Since her marriage was not happy, she returned to Poland where her brother Boleslaw the Brave was ruling. After Sweyn died her sons, Kanut and Karald took her back from Poland. Kanut, known as Kanut the Great became later king of England, Denmark and Norway and governor of Schleswig and Pomerania. She died somewhere in English castle. In any event, Boleslaus I of Poland, the first king of Poland actually sent his troops to help Canute in his successful conquest of England, another sign of close relationships between Polish rulers and Vikings.

It is said that Świętosława's difficult character was inherited after her aunt Adelaide (Polish Adelajda) who was probably a sister of Mieszko I and also the wife of the Hungarian duke Geza. Adelaide became a mother of St. Stephen the Great (977-1038), who became the first king of Hungary and a saint.

Adelaide was known as a beauty, but she drunk excessively and loved riding horses like a man. Once, she even killed a man in a rage.

--- (soon after 967-). This is one of the possibilities for the origin of the first wife of Svend I King of Denmark, based solely on Thietmar who refers to the mother of "filiis Suenni" as "Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successori eius"[69]. Europäische Stammtafeln names her "Šwiętosława [Gunhild] of Poland", although there is no indication of the basis for this suggested Polish name, and states that she married firstly Erik "Segersäll/the Victorious" King of Sweden, as his second wife[70]. This latter suggestion is implausible as it would mean that both of King Erik's wives were in turn married to Svend King of Denmark, numerous primary sources attesting that the latter's second wife Sigrid "Storråda/the Haughty" was the widow of King Erik[71]. m ([988/90]%29 as his first wife, SVEND I "Tveskæg/Forkbeard" King of Denmark, son of HARALD I "Blåtand/Bluetooth" King of Denmark & his first wife Gunhild ([960]-Gainsborough 3 Feb 1014, bur in England, later removed to Roskilde).]

General Notes:

De sikre informasjoner vi har om Gunhild er ytterst få, hennes slaviske navn er ikke kjent. Adam av Bremen setter hennes ekteskap med Erik Segersäll i forbindelse med et forenet svensk-slavisk angrep på Danmark, men den historiske bakgrunn for dette kan ikke kontrolleres. Ifølge Adam fødte hun Erik sønnen Olof Skötkonung. Etter Eriks død giftet hun seg med Svend Tjugeskjegg, muligens da denne ca. år 1000 inngikk forbund med kong Olav. Hun ble senere bortvist av Svend, og levde i mange år i Vendland, inntil hennes sønner etter Svends død hentet henne hjem til Danmark. De islandske sagaforfatterne har knyttet forskjellige ikke historiskt korrekte trekk til hennes navn, og dette har senere i tradisjonen blitt fortrengt av den svenske dronning Sigrid Storråde.

Gunhild was the sister of Boleslav I of Poland (992 - 1025) and not his daughter as Snorre Sturlasson related.

From Snorre Sturlasson: King Olaf Trygvason's Saga:

"22. OLAF TRYGVASON'S MARRIAGE.

While Olaf lay at Borgundarholm there came on bad weather, storm, and a heavy sea, so that his ships could not lie there; and he sailed southwards under Vindland, where they found a good harbour. They conducted themselves very peacefully, and remained some time. In Vindland there was then a king called Burizleif, who had three daughters, -- Geira, Gunhild, and Astrid. ..."

Noted events in her life were:

• She was a Queen.

Gunhild married Eric VI the Victorious Bjornsson, son of Bjorn the Old of Sweden Ericsson and Unknown, circa 980-985. (Eric VI the Victorious Bjornsson died in 995.)

Gunhild next married Svend I Haraldsson Tjugeskjegg of Denmark, son of Harald I Gormsson Blåtann of Denmark and Gyrid, circa 995. The marriage ended in divorce in 1000. (Svend I Haraldsson Tjugeskjegg of Denmark was born circa 960, died on 3 Feb 1014 in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, England and was buried in Roskilde Cathedral, Denmark 4.)

Noteringar

Polsk prinsessa, drottning av Danmark, Norge och England

Att Sven Tveskägg var gift med en polsk prinsessa är bevisat (Gunhild, dotter av Mieszko I) Enligt källor jag har stött på var Sven gift både med Gunhild av Polen och Sigrid Storråda. Många hävdar dock att de är en och samma person, så jag redovisar tills vidare Gunhild som moder till Estrid. Frågan är då om denna Gunhild även är mor till Olof Skötkonung.

Marriage (1): Eric VI the Victorious Bjornsson circa 980-985

Marriage (2): Svend I Haraldsson Tjugeskjegg of Denmark circa 995

Have FOund the wife listed at one time as

PRINCE OBOTRITES MIECESLAS was born 919. He married SOPHIA [-?-] . She was born Abt. 921.

Child is:

ASTRID OR INEGRID, PSS. OF OBOTRITES, b. Abt. 979, Sweden;married III OLAF, KING OF SWEDEN son of VIII ERIK and QUEEN SKOGLAR-TESTEDOTTER. He was born Abt. 950 in Sweden, and died 1022."

It is said that she was the mother of Knud den Store, who was born ab. 995. At that point her brother Boleslaw is 29 and Swietoslawa is 28 years. After Sven Tveskæg's death in 1014, Knud and Harald fetched their mother in Slavia, which might mean that she had gone home to her brother Boleslaw. The brothers buried their father's body - which had been brought to Denmark "by a certain English lady" - in the church he had let build in Roskilde. According to a note Boleslaw helped ab. 1015 Knud den Store (his nephew) with a detachment of Polish horsemen, when he went to England with his army to claim the throne.

This is one of the possibilities for the origin of the first wife of Svend I King of Denmark, based solely on Thietmar who refers to the mother of "filiis Suenni" as "Miseconis filia ducis, soror Bolizlavi successori eius” [Thietmar VII.39, p. 334.].

This latter suggestion is implausible as it would mean that both of King Erik's wives were in turn married to Svend King of Denmark, numerous primary sources attesting that the latter's second wife Sigrid "Storråda/the Haughty" was the widow of King Erik [For example, Laing, S.
