        "text": "A celebrity hairstylist with nearly 25 years of experience, Johnny Wright is no stranger to success. He was born and raised in Chicago and got his start in the styling world watching his grandmother do press and curls on the front porch as a child. After working his way through Chicago and then Los Angeles, he spent eight years as Michelle Obama’s personal hairstylist during the Obama Administration.\n\nHis work can also be seen on celebrities like Queen Latifah, Kerry Washington, Tiffany Cross, Angela Rye, and Samira Wiley to name a few. His career spans professional and artistic accolades such as creative director for SoftSheen Carson for L’Oreal, HSN appearances, brand ambassadorships, and industry awards. Wright’s unique success is owed in part to years of master styling skills and precision cutting techniques as well as his business ingenuity and infectious upbeat personality."
