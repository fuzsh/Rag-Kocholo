        "text": "WRIGHT, John Paul, 92, Johnstown, was welcomed peacefully by the Lord on January 3, 2022, at Memorial Medical Center. Born November 15, 1929, in Johnstown, PA, son of John Paul and Cora Mae (Parker) Wright. Preceded in death by parents; loving wife Nancy Joyce (O'Donald); and siblings William, Richard, Charlotte (Haynes), Evelyn (Wagner), Robert, Bernice (Gossard), and Adeline (Gray). Survived by sister, Beatrice Croyle and daughters Dawna (Brian H. Lehman), Johnstown; Nancy, Ft. Worth, TX; Carol (Francis Burkett), Johnstown; and Brenda (Horting), Harrisburg; and grandchildren, Jonathan Lehman, Richard Tressler, Zachary Horting, Quentin Horting, Kayla Horting, Jesse Burkett, and Emily Burkett; and great-grandchild Penelope Lehman. John had many loves such as hunting and fishing with his brothers and nephews, family meals and get-togethers, and old western movies. He was a talented woodworker and created pieces of furniture that are priceless. John's favorite love was his family and he made it clear that his daughters and grandchildren were the most important things in his life. Family and friends will be received 4-7PM Friday at Henderson Funeral Home-East Hills, 2503 Bedford St., where funeral service will be held 11AM Saturday with Rev. Adam Dotts officiating. Interment, Richland Cemetery. The Wright Family would like to send their sincerest gratitude to the staff of DaVita Kidney Care for their many years of care and support and Memorial Medical Center's Palliative Care Unit for their compassion and exceptional loving care of John and his family during such a difficult time.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of John P. Wright, please visit our floral store."
