        "text": "John R. Wright, age 65, was surrounded by the love of his family when he passed from this world at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Miami, Florida on December 10, 2018 after a two-year struggle with progressive dementia. He leaves behind his loving wife, Julie, and his only daughter Chrissy, whom he loved dearly. He and his family had been residing in Hollywood, FL since his retirement from the Massachusetts State Police. John was a wonderful, caring husband, loving Dad, much-loved son-in-law, and a companion to his favorite dog, Tiki. John was born in September 1953 to William and Helen M. Wright (O'Leary) in Boston, MA. Raised in Quincy, MA, he attended North Quincy High School. He was known as an avid fast-car enthusiast in his younger days at Wollaston Beach. He then voluntarily enlisted with the Air Force during the Vietnam War. Following his military service overseas, John's love for fast cars led him to a job at Bob's Speed Shop, and then to a career as a police officer. He proudly and passionately served the community for 33 years, beginning by working for the City of Quincy, then the Metropolitan District Commission Police (METs), and ultimately retiring as a Massachusetts State Police Lieutenant in 2013. John was a dedicated law enforcement officer, and loyal Dunkin' Donuts patron. John was dedicated to his work as a public servant. He had a profound and lasting impact on those who had the opportunity to work with him and know him. He was admired and respected by his peers and was known as a mentor to many. His 6'4\" muscular build was ominous, but his demeanor was that of not only a gentleman, but of a humble and gentle man. Leading by example, he emphasized the importance of treating others with the respect, and the kindness with which anyone would want to be treated. Personally, and professionally, he embodied the values of kindness, patience, and hard work. He loved boating and being on the ocean. He was also a skilled and accomplished “Yankee carpenter”, who renovated many homes with his father-in-law Tony, who was also his best friend. Special thanks to the medical team at the Miami VA Hospital for their compassion and dedication in providing exceptional care and comfort to John. A Memorial Mass celebrating John’s life will be held Thursday May 16th at 11 AM in Saint Ann Parish 757 Hancock Street, Quincy, MA 02170. Interment St. Joseph’s Cemetery, West Roxbury. Pushard Family Funeral 210 Sherman St., Canton is assisting the family with arrangements.\n\nTo send flowers to the family or plant a tree in memory of John R. Wright, please visit our floral store."
