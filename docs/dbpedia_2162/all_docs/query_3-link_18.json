        "text": "Chanteur Country US né John Robert Wright, le 13 Mai 1914 à Mt Juliet (Tennessee). Il fit parti, avec Jack Anglin du duo Johnnie & Jack et a épousé Kitty Wells. Johnny Wright est décédé le 27 Septembre 2011.\n\nSinger/songwriter Johnny Wright spent much of his career working with Jack Anglin in the popular duo Johnnie & Jack, and was also the husband of Kitty Wells. He was born in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, and first performed with Anglin in 1936. They teamed up full-time in the 1940s and, except for the time Anglin spent overseas during the war, remained together for over two decades. In 1952, the duo and Wells were invited to join the Grand Ole Opry, where they remained for 15 years. Following Anglin's death in 1963, Wright continued performing and making records. In 1964, he and his Tennessee Mountain Boys had a Top 25 hit with \"Walkin', Talkin', Cryin', Barely Beatin' Broken Heart.\" The following year, he had success with \"Hello Vietnam,\" a number one hit. In 1968, he and Wells recorded an autobiographical duo, \"We'll Stick Together,\" and continued playing live shows together through the early '80s, when they left music to run a souvenir shop. In 1992, the couple and their son Bobby began playing together again.\n\nJohnny Wright died on September 27, 2011.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnnie_Wright\n\nTalents : Vocals, Guitar, Songwriter\n\nStyle musical : Traditional Country, Bluegrass\n\nDon't Give Up The Ship (1964)\n\nBlame It On The Moonlight (1965)\n\nHELLO VIETNAM (1965)\n\nNickels, Quarters And Dimes (1966)\n\nMusic To Cry By (1967)\n\nYears in activity :\n\nDISCOGRAPHY\n\nSingles\n\n09/1963 SP DECCA 31537 (US) What's Gonna Happen To Me / Sweet Snow Dear 02/1994 SP DECCA 31593 (US\n\nJohnny Wright & The Tennessee Mountain Boys - Walkin', Talkin', Cryin', Barely Beatin' Broken Heart / They're All Goin' Home But One\n\n10/1964 SP DECCA 31679 (US) Don't Give Up The Ship / Guitar Lessons 02/1965 SP DECCA 31740 (US) Blame It On The Moonlight / Rest In Peace 07/1965 SP DECCA 31821 (US) Hello Vietnam / Mexico City 12/1965 SP DECCA 31875 (US) Keep The Flag Flying / You're Over There (And I'm Over Here) 03/1966 SP DECCA 31927 (US) Nickels, Quarters And Dimes / Is Love Worth All The Heartaches 08/1966 SP DECCA 32002 (US) I'm Doing This For Daddy / Racing Man 11/1966 SP DECCA 32061 (US) Mama's Little Jewel / Nothing From Nothing 05/1967 SP DECCA 32133 (US) Why / Ole Honky Tonk 07/1967 SP DECCA 32162 (US) American Power / Settle Back Down To Earth 10/1967 SP DECCA 32216 (US) Music To Cry By / Cheaters Can't Win 02/1968 SP DECCA 32267 (US) Go Get It / Atlanta Georgia Baby 03/1968 SP DECCA 32294 (US) Kitty WELLS & Johnny WRIGHT - We'll Stick Together / Heartbreak Waltz 10/1968 SP DECCA 32402 (US)\n\n(They Always Come Out) Smellin' Like A Rose / One Little Taco\n\n03/1969 SP DECCA 732466 (US)\n\nLove Ain't Gonna Die (I'm Gonna Have To Kill It) / Wabash Cannon Ball\n\n1969 SP DECCA 32564 (US) Sing A Song About Love / If You Don't Swing, Don't Ring 11/1969 SP DECCA 732604 (US) There Won't Be Any Tree This Christmas (Kitty WELLS & Johnny WRIGHT) / White Christmas (Kitty WELLS) 02/1970 SP DECCA 32627 (US) A Dear John Letter / Rainbow In The Clouds 06/1970 SP DECCA 32704 (US) Mama Set The Table / Love Everybody 12/1970 SP DECCA 32770 (US) Where The Heart Aches Hang Around / Something To Come Home To 02/1971 SP DECCA 32799 (US) Old Honky Tonk / She's Gone Gone Gone 05/1971 SP DECCA 32832 (US) High Cost Of Livin' / Let Jesus Turn You On 09/1971 SP DECCA 32883 (US) Going To The Country / South In New Orleans 09/1972 SP DECCA 33012 (US)\n\nDoo-Hickey / Hoping That You're Hoping\n\n01/1973 SP DECCA 33053 (US) Dont Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes / Dont Let The Stars Get In Your Eyes 01/1973 SP MCA MCA-40138\n\nThey're Writing Her Name (On The Wall) / Ode To A Country Bar\n\n1975 SP CAPRICORN CPS 0232 (US) Wild, Passionate Lover / Chicken Pickin' Hillbilly Band 1976 SP RUBOCCA 123 (US)\n\nI Never Told Him I Loved You / Old Milwaukee's Talking\n\n05/1980 SP RUBOCCA 213 (US) Pressure / Harry Truman 1982 SP Dan The Man 1003 (US)\n\nJust A Simple Bouquet / Our Love It Will Not Fade\n\nAlbums\n\n07/1968 LP 12\" DECCA DL-5026 (mono) / DL-75026 (stereo) (US) WE'LL STICK TOGETHER - Kitty WELLS & Johnny WRIGHT - We'll Stick Together / We Must Have Been Out Of Our Minds / One By One / Happiness Means You / Living As Strangers / I Can't Stop Loving You / Holding On To Nothin' / Heartbreak Waltz / Ashes Of Love / You And Me / My Elusive Dreams 01/1972 LP 12\" DECCA DL-75325 (US) HEARTWARMING GOSPEL SONGS - Kitty WELLS & Johnny WRIGHT - How Great Thou Art / Wait For The Light To Shine / My Bible / Did You Let Your Light Shine / Heaven Will Be My Home / Jesus Take A Hold / God Put A Rainbow In The Clouds / Precious Memories / There's A Big Wheel / Singing His Praise / We Owe Good For Everything 1980 LP 12\" RUBOCCA ARR-2001 (US) JOHNNY WRIGHT - Froggies Return, Ashes Of Love, Sweet Lovin' Woman, Humming Bird, Pressure, Chicken Picken Hillbilly Band, As Long As I Live, Poison Love, We'll Stick Together, Wild Passionate Lover\n\n© Rocky Productions 12/10/2020"
