        "text": "There are two types of people in this world: fans of 'N Sync or Backstreet Boys.\n\n'N Sync member Lance Bass' documentary, The Boy Band Con: The Lou Pearlman Story, was released in 2019, and featured members of multiple boy bands and their families documenting the devastation and deceit they experienced during their time working with former manager Lou Pearlman, their father figure turned enemy.\n\nPearlman, who died in 2016, was the man credited for kicking off the boy band boom in the '90s, starting the careers of super-groups like 'N Sync, Backstreet Boys, LFO and O-Town.\n\nBut in the '90s and early aughts, it was all about 'N Sync and BSB and their battle to top the pop charts, which is exactly how Pearlman wanted it.\n\nAnd today, with Chris Kirkpatrick admitting he was hardly a fan of BSB's AJ McLean, we couldn't help but look back on one of music's most-hyped—and secretly encouraged—rivalries.\n\nBefore becoming the so-called Berry Gordy of the boy band generation, Pearlman was the head of Trans Continental, an Orlando-based umbrella company that included a travel agency, Chippendales dancers and chartering planes. Not exactly a traditional start for a music manager.\n\nBut he made the decision to enter the music industry after chartering a private plane for New Kids on the Block, the gold standard of boy bands at the time. \"I said to my cousin, 'How can they afford an airplane, these kids?'\" Pearlman remembered asking. That cousin would be Art Garfunkel, of the legendary Simon & Garfunkel, who told him just how much freakin' money the five guys were making.\n\n\"I was on the wrong side of the coin,\" Pearlman said. \"Artie told me, 'You're in business; you like music. You should do something like that.' So as a weekend goof we decided to do a little audition, and one thing led to another.\"\n\nHe formed Trans Contintenal Records and launched a $3 million talent contest with his own money in the hopes of finding the next great (money-making) boy band. And that, in a nutshell, is how the Backstreet Boys were formed, with the help of successful music manager Johnny Wright, who worked with NKOTB.\n\nThe first member of Backstreet Boys was McLean, who auditioned for Pearlman in his living room after seeing an ad for the contest. After that, Pearlman held an open casting call that took place in a blimp hangar, which later became the heat-filled home of what would be known as \"boy band boot camp.\" (The process included six to eight hours a day of dance rehearsals, voice lessons and no air conditioning. The ultimate bonding experience.)\n\nHowie Dorough met Pearlman next in 1992, Nick Carter auditioned soon after and then Kevin Richardson, who was working at Disney World at the time, was somehow recommended by his wannabe music manager's limo driver. But the necessary fifth slot was proving difficult to fill. That is until Kevin suggested his younger cousin.\n\n\"I saw two people, and it was pretty bad,\" Richardson recalled to Rolling Stone in 1999. \"It just made me sad. And I said, ‘You know what? I have a cousin who can sing his butt off.'\"\n\nIn fact, Brian Litrell recalled the exact date his life changed in that cover story: April 19, 1993. He was in history class in Kentucky when he was pulled out because he had a phone call with destiny. Richardson told him, \"Why don't you come and, you know, sing with these guys down here? I'm in this group and, you know, we're going to make records and be famous.'\"\n\nSo long, college plans. Hello, boy band infamy.\n\nOf course, they needed to find their fifth and final member. While they initially had Jason Galasso as their bass singer, it didn't work out, though his mark was forever left on the group as their band name came from the last initial of each member's first name.\n\nThen Timberlake's vocal coach suggested Bass, a 15-year-old from Mississippi, who flew out to Orlando the day after his Homecoming parade to audition. After agreeing to go by the nickname \"Lansten\" so they could keep their name, Bass was in and BSB officially had a rival…not that they knew it at the time.\n\nBut they were about to find out in a devastating way.\n\nIn their doc, Richardson recalled Pearlman breaking the news of his new band to him in 1995 when he showed him a VHS recording of the rival group performing. \"It was almost like a betrayal,\" Richardson said. \"When we started out, we were like, 'Yeah, we're a team. We're gonna take over the world. There's nobody like us,'\" he continued. \"Then you find out, 'Well, actually there is somebody like you.'\"\n\nSo why did management stage and encourage this rivalry? They wanted the monopoly on boy bands, of course.\n\nTo help set the two groups apart, their shared management gave them different looks and slightly different sounds.\n\nFor Backstreet, their image was \"a little bit darker,\" so they wore darker clothing. \"Harmonies were the thing that they focused on the most,\" Johnny explained in The Boy Band Con. 'N Sync, meanwhile, \"were the guys next door. They wore basketball jerseys and shorts and Jordan shoes.\" When it came to the music, they \"really focused on the performance and the shows.\"\n\n('N Sync would likely object to that comparison, with Fatone once proudly telling Rolling Stone they had \"more intricate harmonies\" than their rivals.)\n\n\"The ultimate goal was to do it not once but twice,\" Wright said of trying to take 'N Sync to the next level à la Backstreet, which worked after the Disney Channel special. \"I think we've done that, and, obviously, it's caused a problem.\"\n\nFor 'N Sync, the underdog band that eventually overtook BSB, they seemed unfazed by the rumors of competition, at least publicly. \"People try to make a feud out of everything,\" Timberlake told Rolling Stone. \"And we didn't see it like that.\"\n\nThey may not have seen it like that. But that doesn't mean their contemporaries felt the same way.\n\nPart of Pearlman's strategy was taken straight from the hallway of your average middle school: He would complain about BSB to 'N Sync and vice versa, turning them against each other with lies about diva behavior, with Kirkpatrick saying, \"If I were the Backstreet Boys, I would've hated us too.\"\n\nBass added, \"What Lou told us worked like a charm. He pitted us against each other and we stayed against each other our whole entire careers. If I saw them in a room I would've even want to talk to them. I was scared of them. I didn't know if they were going to yell at me or not.\"\n\nThey were far from the only super-groups Pearlman attempted to form: C-Note, a Latin boy band; Take 5, a total BSB/'N Sync knockoff that he was hoping would be his third breakthrough group; LFO, a trio that had one major hit in \"Summer Girls,\" and his first girl group, Innocence.\n\n\"Not to say too much...because we are in a legal situation right now—I was made an offer I could refuse,\" Wright explained in 1998, as the split was happening. \"With all the success and everything that's going on, we should all be popping champagne and toasting the success that everybody has worked hard for over the last five years, but it's all mired by other things.\"\n\nOf course, he didn't exactly put out any rivalry fires after his split with BSB was official.\n\nStill, success was bittersweet, as the terms of their settlement with Pearlman ended with him still getting 1/6th of their earnings, even though the band, which referred to themselves as \"indentured servants\" in their suit, collectively had only received $300,000 compared to the $10 million Trans Continental saw from 1993-97. \"It's ridiculous,\" Littrell, who was the first to sue Pearlman, told Rolling Stone in 2000. \"He's doing no work.\"\n\nAt the same time, 'N Sync was relishing their own freedom following a bitter legal battle with Pearlman. Similar to BSB, Bass memorably recounted Pearlman presenting each member of the band with a check for just $10,000 at a dinner after selling over 10 million records. It was the first time they had been paid aside from receiving a daily $35 stipend.\n\n\"He wanted to be the sixth member of the group…and I think he wanted those boys to see him that way too,\" Timberlake's mom Lynn said in The Boy Band Con, \"and if he hadn't taken advantage of them, they would have.\"\n\nThanks to a small technicality they found in their contract—if they weren't signed to a label in the U.S.in a certain amount of time their contract was void, and they had been signed to a label in Germany—'N Sync was able to get away from Trans Continental and RCA…but Pearlman wasn't about to go down without a fight, suing the band for the name 'N Sync in a $150 million lawsuit in October 1999. The band countersued for $25 million.\n\nThey ultimately got to keep their name, with the suit being settled out of court. They left RCA and joined Jive Records, BSB's label.\n\nAnd their 1999 emancipation from Pearlman proved to be the ultimate inspiration for the group's next album, No Strings Attached, a direct reference to their puppet strings being cut. Their first single? \"Bye Bye Bye.\"\n\nSubtle? No. Successful? Insanely so.\n\nJust how much a monster success was No Strings Attached? It sold 2.4 million copies in its first-week in 2000, basically doubling the previous record, which was set only months before by their archrival. (Their record wouldn't be broken until Adele's 25 in 2015.)\n\nAhead of Celebrity's release in 2001, 'N Sync wanted to make it clear they were different than—ahem—some other groups in their genre.\n\n\"It's really almost like a bad slang to us,\" Kirkpatrick told Rolling Stone of the \"boy band\" label. \"When you say 'boy band,' you're grouping us into a bunch of groups that everybody thinks are very similar, and they're nothing like us. They may be five guys or four guys or other similarities here and there, but it's just one of those things. We've spent six years trying to get out of the shadow of being this boy-band thing.\"\n\nOne year after Celebrity's release, 'N Sync announced they were going on a temporary hiatus. But it ended up becoming a permanent end to the group as they never recorded or toured together again.\n\nEven though his lawsuits with Backstreet and 'N Sync were well-documented, Pearlman continued to try and find the next big thing in music, even launching ABC and later MTV's hit series, Making the Band, which formed O-Town.\n\n\"When I saw that,\" Richardson said of the show, \"I about puked. I mean, the average person sitting there watching that show is probably like, 'So this is how the Backstreet Boys came to be.' No, it's not. All he did was give us money to go into the studio and work on our craft, which we are thankful for. But he's making himself to be the guy twisting the knobs, and it's just not so.\"\n\nLike 'N Sync, BSB used their experience with Pearlman and the indelible marks it left on them as fuel for their third album, 2000's Black and Blue, a reference to the way their former mentor had bruised them.\n\n\"He ended up bringing us all together more,\" Bass told People. \"Look at the Backstreet Boys, right? We never spoke to them. We were always afraid of them. Now after the fact, we're all really good friends because they went through something that we can only relate to—it really bonded all of us.\"\n\nBut that didn't mean the Backstreet Boys' members were jumping at the chance to take part in The Boy Band Con, hesitant to open up about their experience with Pearlman again.\n\n\"Backstreet Boys were basically like, 'No, we won't even touch this!'\" Bass revealed during a live taping of the Homophilia podcast at SXSW, where The Boy Band Con held its world premiere. But one member was willing to speak.\n\nAside from ending any feud or rivalry with 'N Sync that was contrived by Pearlman, BSB later reconciled with Wright. The band teamed up with their former manager again in 2003, with McLean saying in the Behind the Music episode, \"Why not put the A team back together that was together a decade ago?\"\n\nAfter a lengthy hiatus, BSB released its comeback album, Never Gone, in 2005, but just one year later, Richardson announced he was leaving the group. \"He gave his blessing to continue the music without him,\" the remaining four members said in a statement. \"We have no intention of replacing Kevin, and the door will always be open for him to return to the Backstreet Boys. We wish him the all the best in his future endeavors.\"\n\nTwo albums and six years later, Richardson rejoined the group permanently. They've since released more albums, started a Las Vegas residency and have sold over 100 million records worldwide, becoming one of the best-selling boy band of all-time.\n\nBSB took him back to court in 2014, claiming they were still owed almost $3.5 million. Eventually, the band received a settlement of $99,000 cash, 34 audio tape reels, 26 CDs, seven studio mastering audio tapes, six sealed posters, three audio cassettes and one VHS tape. The recordings included some unreleased mixes, demos and original materials.\n\nIn 2010, Pearlman suffered a stroke while incarcerated, and in 2016, he died after going into cardiac arrest.\n\n\"It was the most mixed emotions ever,\" Kirkpatrick said in The Boy Band Con of Pearlman's passing. \"You don't know whether to cry. You don't know whether to laugh. You don't know whether to be relieved. You don't know whether to feel bad for him, happy for everyone else. There is so much wrong with everything about him and what happened that you don't even know how to take death.\""
