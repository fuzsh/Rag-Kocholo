        "text": "ALMO/IRVING & RONDOR MUSIC 1962 -1969\n\n1963 1964 1965 1966 1967 1968 1969\n\n1962\n\nAround the time Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss founded A&M Records, they also established their music publishing business, Almo Music. Almo is the first two letters of each man's last name. Almo Music Corp. was formally incorporated on October 5, 1962.\n\nJerry Moss brought Irving Music, named for his father, to the partnership. In its earliest days, A&M Records was a division of Irving Music. Both publishing groups, Almo with ASCAP and Irving with BMI, would represent A&M's interests in the United States. The publishing houses also had the Sharolyn Music and LaBrea Music catalogs.\n\nSometimes noted as Almo/Irving Music and sometimes as Irving/Almo Music Corp., the publishing houses were headquartered on the A&M Records lot. The street mailing address was 1358 North La Brea, Hollywood, California.\n\nFrom 1962 until 1976, Almo and Irving's printed sheet music and music books would be manufactured and distributed by a number of manufacturers including Hansen, Key, and Walter Kane.\n\nTop\n\n1966\n\nBy now, Almo and Irving Music had a catalog of about 200 copyrights and had 16 folios in preparation. Most of these were songs written by Herb Alpert, Sol Lake, members of the Tijuana Brass, and by Julius Wechter and members of the Baja Marimba Band.\n\nUnder Almo Irving, there were four music publishers: Almo and La Brea that were affiliated with ASCAP and Irving and Good Sam with BMI.\n\nAlpert and Moss hired Chuck Kaye to head Almo/Irving. Kaye began to increase the number of staff writers and expand the number of copyrights held. The first hit song that was not on A&M was Ruthann Friedman's \"Windy\" by The Association.\n\nAlmo/Irving established permanent publishing facilities in Mexico, Australia and England.\n\nDave Hubert was hired as the administrative executive and A&M bought his Davon catalog. Through Davon, Almo/Irving added Mason Williams and Tandyn Almer to its staff of songwriters plus the Rod McKuen catalog.\n\nSongwriters signed in 1966 included Art Podell, Johnny Walsh, Mike Brewer and Larry Marks.\n\nLance Freed was hired on November 7. He would rise to the position of President, Rondor Music International.\n\nIrving/Almo acquired the Bob Hilliard, Mort Garson and Day catalogs and signed the team of Roger Nichols and Paul Williams as staff writers as well as Larry Marks to LaBrea; Art Podell to Almo, Johnny Walsh to Irving and Mike Brewer to Good Sam.\n\nA&M's publishing houses administered Good Sam for BMI and LaBrea for ASCAP.\n\nAround May, Rondor Music, Ltd. opened in London. Chuck Kaye and attorney Abe Somer developed Rondor's first foreign publishing arrangement with Carlin Music. Cyril Simons was named director. Rondor's street address was 147 Oxford Street, London, England. They also established facilities in Mexico and Australia.\n\nTop\n\n1967\n\nAmong the staff writers at Almo and Irving were Kerry Chater, and Jack Conrad. Larry Marks was signed in 1967. In September, Almo announced a long-term recording and publishing contract with Ruthann Friedman. Tom Shipley and Michael Brewer were signed as staff writers to Good Sam Music.\n\nAlmo created Irving-Almo Productions, a disc publishing unit, to help introduce its songs with Chuck Kaye, Roger Nichols and Tony Asher providing a&r services.\n\nJoel Sill was hired as a professional manager for the writers and participate in developing new writers. Later in the year, Sill was chosen to head Almo/Irving's first New York office that opened on October 16, 1967. When Sill moved to New York, Art Podell became the west coast professional manager of Almo/Irving. Brenda Andrews joined Almo/Irving Music.\n\nThe disc unit was based on the realization that more artists were writing their own material rather than recording songs written by other people. Almo wanted to develop its own talent as writers who were also artists and it also supplied songs to artists not signed to A&M.\n\nIn August, Rondor Music International was established to handle A&M's international publishing concerns. Rondor was named for sons Ron Moss and Dore Alpert. Chuck Kaye ran the operation. Richard Stewart was named Rondor's director reporting to Kaye. The first offices were Rondor Music Ltd.-Carlin Music Corporation in England; Rondor Music Australia, Pty. Ltd.-Belinda Music Australia, and Rondor Music S.A.-Grever International S.A. in Mexico. Rondor also had publishing affiliations in Germany, Sweden, France, Spain and Italy. Armonic music publishing group distributed Rondor in Spain.\n\nAcquired the Davon Music. Corp. from Dave Hubert, who became the director of A&M International.\n\nThe publishing wing now had over 1,000 copyrights.\n\nCharles Hanson Publications was selected to produce and distribute A&M sheet music and music books.\n\nBMI MOST PERFORMED SONGS BY IRVING MUSIC\n\nSONG SONGWRITERS Windy Ruthann Friedman\n\nTop\n\n1968\n\n\"The most important thing with Almo/Irving] is attitude, both with management and artist. Our entire operation is keen and aware. Aware of the entire social structure of what's happening in the world, and of today's social attitudes.\n\n--Chuck Kaye, Cash Box, October 26, 1968\"\n\n\"I believe in music of all types.

VP David Conrad told Billboard, \"It would be fair to say that we generally wind up with a 20% to 30% increase [in profits] every year over what we did the last year.\" The Nashville presence included a staff of seven plus 18 staff writers. Billboard reported that it had co-publishing deals with Bamatuck and Kybama owned by Barry Beckett and Troy Seals; Don Schlitz's Hayes Street and Hayes Court; and Wayland Holyfield's Waylando. Almo/Irving Nashville also administered Clint Black's Blackened Music, Carl Perkins' Brick Hithouse and Waylon Jennings Music catalogs.\n\nThe Nashville office signed Pat Alger.

The song was played at campaign rallies, however the campaign never asked permission to use the song or change its lyrics. Both Hayes and Rondor, which held the copyright, objected for three reasons. First, the new lyrics created an unauthorized derivative work that violated copyright law. Second, use of the song implied endorsement of Dole. Third, use of the song in this manner could potentially devalue the song in the future. After receiving notification from Rondor of its concerns, the Dole campaign stopped using the song and Rondor sought compensation for the song's use by the Dole campaign.\n\nEmmylou Harris signed with Almo/Irving in Nashville and was named ASCAP's Songwriter of the Year.\n\nBillboard ranked Almo Music as the fifth Hot R&B Publishing Corporation and as the fourth Hot Country Singles and Tracks Publishing Corporation.\n\nMelissa Etheridge was ASCAP's Songwriter of the Year.\n\nAcquired the Lloyd Price and Lloyd and Logan catalogs.\n\nRe-signed Mark Knopfler.\n\nASCAP COUNTRY MUSIC AWARDS FOR ALMO MUSIC\n\nSONG SONGWRITERS Bend It Till It Breaks John Anderson, Lionel Delmore Little Bit of You (a) Trey Bruce, Craig Wiseman In Between Dances Barry Alfonso, Craig Bickhardt That's As Close As I'll Get to Loving You Sally Dworsky This Woman and This Man Michael Lunn, Jeff Pennig\n\nASCAP POP MUSIC AWARDS FOR ALMO MUSIC\n\nSONG SONGWRITERS Baby I Love Your Way Peter Frampton All I Wanna Do David Baerwald, Bill Bottrell, Wyn Cooper, Kevin Gilbert Hold On Kevin Savigar Strong Enough David Baerwald, Bill Bottrell, Wyn Cooper, Kevin Gilbert\n\nBMI COUNTRY AWARDS BY IRVING MUSIC\n\nSONG SONGWRITERS Safe in the Arms of Love Pat Bunch, Mary Ann Kennedy, Pam Rose I Think About It All the Time Billy Livsey I Wanna Go Too Far Layang Martine, Jr., Kent Robbins\n\nTop\n\n1997\n\nRondor Music bought the Squeeze catalog of songs, Javaberry Music.

This sale was also to be the settlement of outstanding lawsuits filed by Alpert and Moss against Universal. The sale became effective in December 2000. In the first year after the acquisition, Universal reduced the Rondor staff from 120 people around the world to ten in the U.S. However, part of the deal allowed Rondor to continue operating as an independent company within the Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG) conglomerate. Lance Freed continued to oversee Rondor's creative team that was managed by Ron Moss; business affairs under Mary Lee Ryan, and licensing. UMPG integrated Rondor into its administration systems, collected and paid royalties that were due to Rondor's writers and artists that it represented.
