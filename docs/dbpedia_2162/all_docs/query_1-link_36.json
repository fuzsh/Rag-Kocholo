        "text": "Johnnie Lee Wright, formerly of Fayetteville, ended his earthly journey July 3, 2023, at the young age of 61 years with family members by his side.\n\nJohnnie was born November 3, 1961, in Incheon, Korea. He was an academically gifted 1980 graduate of Reid Ross High School. Johnnie was a true Star Trek “Trekkie” and lover of Outer Space. He joined the Air Force in 1980 to explore the world where he remained a dedicated Airman until retirement. He received multiple medals and awards with multiple oak leaf clusters, some of which include the Air Force Achievement Medal with OLC’s, Air Force Commendation Medal with OLC’s, Air Force Longevity Service Award with OLC’s, Training Ribbons, Overseas Short and Long Tour Ribbons, Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, and Outstanding Unit Award with OLC’s.\n\nHis greatest accomplishment was that of a dedicated, full-time father. He loved his two sons with such devotion and passion and dedicated his entire life to them. He was also blessed with two grandchildren who he loved so dearly, they were his crown and greatest gift.\n\nHe was an avid reader, he enjoyed reading all the Star Trek books, the Spenser for Hire Series of books, and The Saint with Roger Moore Collection along with hundreds of other books read over his lifetime. He was a great multi-media artist, he painted with watercolors, oils, and acrylics, carved small animals out of wood, and wrote poetry. He was the keeper and guardian of many sentimental treasures and trinkets.\n\nHis heart was full of love, compassion, and selflessness. Even when he was so sick in the hospital and needed his nurse’s assistance at his bedside, another patient would be calling for her and he would tell her to go and see what the other patient needed first.\n\nHe remained close to a couple of high school classmates who shared his last weeks with him. His family is grateful for their friendship.\n\nThe family would like to thank Cape Fear Valley Hospice. From the administrative staff to the nurses, nursing assistant, social worker, and Chaplain, we thank you for providing exceptional care.\n\nHe is preceded in death by his father. He leaves behind to cherish his memory, two sons, two grandchildren, his mother, two brothers and their spouses, two sisters and their spouses, numerous nieces and nephews, and a multitude of extended family members.\n\nHe will be laid to rest with full Military Honors at Sandhills State Veterans Cemetery, 8220 Bragg Boulevard, Fort Liberty, NC 28310 on Friday, July 21, 2023, at 1200.\n\nFuneral arrangments by Jernigan-Warren Funeral Home, 545 Ramsey St. Fayetteville, N.C. 28301\n\nOnline condolences may be made at www.jerniganwarren.com"
