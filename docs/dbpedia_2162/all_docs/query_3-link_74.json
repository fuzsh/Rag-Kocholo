        "text": "John E. Wright, 51, of Elkhart, passed away unexpectedly on Tuesday, May 10, 2022, at Elkhart General Hospital. He was born on May 21, 1970, in Elkhart to James Wright and Karol (Saupe) Rummel.\n\nJohn is survived by his wife of 20 years, Elizabeth Wright; daughters, Ryan K. Wright, Victoria Brown, and Alexandria (Andrew) Wakeman; son, Chris (Jennifer) Brown; one grandchild and great granddaughter; 14 nieces and nephews; mother, Karol (Ron) Rummel; brothers, James (Heather) Wright and David Bennett; sisters, Jennifer Brown and Crissy Wright.\n\nIn accordance with John’s wishes, cremation was chosen. Family and friends are called to gather for visitation on Tuesday, May 17, 2022, from 6-7 p.m. at Billings Funeral Home, 812 Baldwin St. in Elkhart. A service will follow at 7:00 p.m. with Pastor Jeremy Sarber officiating.\n\nJohn, known to many as “Johnny” or “Batman,” was a gentle, caring, and kind man that never knew a stranger. He loved everyone and was a hard worker who worked for Prime Time in Wakarusa for many years as a receiver. John enjoyed spending time with his family, especially when they would cookout together on beautiful summer days. In his spare time, he could be found watching movies with his loving wife; collecting swords; and cheering on the Miami Dolphins. John will be greatly missed by all who knew him and by his loving family."
