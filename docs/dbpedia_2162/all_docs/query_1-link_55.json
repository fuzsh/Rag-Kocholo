        "text": "OXFORD – John W. Wright, 63, of Rhonda Rheault Drive, died peacefully on Monday, March 25, 2024, in his home after a short illness. He is survived by his wife of 39 years, Norma (Pouliot) Wright of Oxford; three children, Jessica Wright of Centreville, VA, Ashley Barry and her husband Jason of Worcester, and Christopher Wright and his wife Alicia of North Grosvenordale, CT; his sister, Paula Dwyer and her husband Michael of Chicago, IL; his granddaughter, Charlotte Wright of North Grosvenordale, CT; and many nieces, nephews, and friends, who were like family to him. He will be greatly missed by his beloved dog, Miss Sadie.\n\nHe was born in Holland, son of the late John and Mary (McFarlane) Wright, Jr., and lived in Oxford for over 30 years. He graduated from Northbridge High School in 1978 and received his bachelor’s degree from Nichols College in Dudley.\n\nJohn was very proud of his work accomplishments, but his greatest pride was his children. He was currently a Project Manager at GridIron IT Solutions. He worked for Juniper Networks for several years and many other startup companies setting up their service organizations. He loved golf and was a member of Quinnatisset Country Club. He loved to entertain in his home, was a wonderful cook and a great bartender. The night wasn’t complete until he entertained friends and family as “DJ Johnny Wright.”\n\nA funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. on Tuesday, April 2, 2024, at Paradis-Givner Funeral Home, 357 Main St., Oxford. Burial will be private at a later date at Pine Grove Cemetery in Whitinsville. Calling hours are Monday, April 1, 2024, from 4-7 p.m. at the funeral home.\n\nThe family wishes to thank the UMass Memorial Medical Center – 8th Floor Staff – for their care and compassion extended to both John and his family.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the UMass Memorial Foundation, Cancer Patient and Family Fund, UMass Memorial Health Care, 365 Plantation Street, Biotech One, Worcester, MA 01605."
