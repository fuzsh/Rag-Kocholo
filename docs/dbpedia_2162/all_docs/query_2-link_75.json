        "text": "(CNN) -- Former child pop star Aaron Carter checked into a rehabilitation facility \"where he feels he will get the guidance and cleansing he needs\" to restart his music career, his manager said Monday.\n\nA statement released by manager Johnny Wright did not detail what problems the 23-year-old Carter is seeking help with.\n\nCarter began working on a music comeback in Orlando for several months, including \"working on a new album, perfecting his live show and his physical body,\" he said.\n\n\"Aaron, understanding the challenges and hard work it would take to get himself back to the top, requested to take some time before we started to heal some emotional and spiritual issues he was dealing with,\" Wright said. \"Therefore, he has chosen to enter a facility where he feels he will get the guidance and cleansing he needs. Which in turn will help him on the music journey he's about to take.\"\n\nCarter, the younger brother of Backstreet Boys' member Nick Carter, surged to stardom in 1998 with his debut album. He competed on TV's \"Dancing With the Stars\" in 2009."
