        "text": "John Leroy Wright of Rich Hill, MO, formerly of Liberty, MO, passed away peacefully with his family by his side on January 30, 2024. John was born in Nevada, Missouri, on November 26, 1943, to John William and Frances Jewell (Henley) Wright. He was the youngest of three children. John grew up in Rich Hill, Missouri, learning foundry and mechanic skills in his father's machinery and blacksmith shop. He graduated from Rich Hill High School in 1961. John became a journeyman machinist and worked for Peabody Coal Company while supporting his family and earning a Bachelor of Science in Accounting from Central Missouri State University. Upon graduation, he worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture until retirement in 2009. John was a car enthusiast and enjoyed working on cars, restoring antique cars, and attending car shows. John was very caring and often thought of the well-being of others rather than himself. His family adored him and will miss him greatly. To mourn his passing, John leaves his wife of 31 years, Kay Wright; his daughters, Joneila (Miles) Henselman and Kristine (Michelle Brunell) Wright; his grandchildren, Anne Marie, John, and Natalia Henselman and Alaina, Ethan, and William Brunell-Wright. He also leaves his stepchildren Robert b(Debra) Black and Joy (Mark) Ervin, and his step-grandchildren Dana Craig, Major (Amanda) Black, Jess (Ginger) Ervin, Aimee (Richie) Allen, and nine step-great-grandchildren, his sister, Velma Goforth, his niece Leta (Barry) Hogge, and many cousins and friends. John was preceded in death by his parents and his infant brother. The family would like to thank John's caregivers, Colleen Keller and Renee Mitchell, for their compassionate care and kindness. They would also like to thank Jerry and Pat Mellenbruch for their decades-long support and friendship. Services will be held on Friday, February 2, 2024, at 2 pm at the Heuser Funeral Home in Rich Hill, Missouri, with burial following at the Green Lawn Cemetery. Friends wishing to make memorial gifts may donate to the Kansas City Hospice House or St. Jude's Children's Hospital."
