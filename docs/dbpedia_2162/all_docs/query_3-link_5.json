        "text": "American country music singer-songwriter (1914–2011)\n\nJohnnie Robert Wright Jr. (May 13, 1914[1] – September 27, 2011)[2] was an American country music singer-songwriter, who spent much of his career working with Jack Anglin as the popular duo Johnnie & Jack, and was also the husband of country music star Kitty Wells.\n\nBiography\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly life and career\n\n[edit]\n\nBorn in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, United States,[1] Wright first performed with Anglin in 1936. On October 30, 1937, he married Kitty Wells.[1] The two, along with Wright's sister Louise, performed as Johnnie Wright & the Harmony Girls.[1] In 1939, Wright and Anglin formed the duo Johnnie & Jack.[1] They teamed up full-time in the 1940s and, except for the time Anglin spent overseas during World War II, remained together for more than two decades.\n\nIn 1952, Johnnie & Jack's \"Poison Love\" took them to the Grand Ole Opry, where the duo, along with Wells, were invited to join and where they remained for 15 years. Following Anglin's death in an automobile accident in 1963, Wright continued performing and releasing records.[1] After his name was misspelled on a record label, Wright changed his name from Johnnie to Johnny.[3]\n\nJohnnie Wright was a founding member of the Country Music Association and turned down the offer to be its first president. He was also involved in the effort to build the Country Music Hall of Fame. Although, Wright has not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nIn 1964, he and his Tennessee Mountain Boys had a Top 25 hit with \"Walkin', Talkin', Cryin', Barely Beatin' Broken Heart\".[1] The following year, he had success with the Tom T. Hall-penned, \"Hello Vietnam\", a No. 1 hit.[1] In 1968, he and Wells recorded an autobiographical duet, \"We'll Stick Together\",[1] and continued playing live shows together through 2007.[3]\n\nLater years\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1983, Wright and Wells opened the Family Country Junction Museum and Studio in their hometown of Madison, Tennessee. They closed the museum in October 2000, but their grandson, John Sturdivant Jr. kept the Junction Recording Studio operating.\n\nDirector Stanley Kubrick included Wright's song \"Hello Vietnam\" in the soundtrack for the 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket.\n\nWright joined producers Randall Franks and Alan Autry for the 1991 CD Christmas Time's A Comin' featuring the cast of the TV series, In the Heat of the Night. He performed along with Kitty Wells and Bobby Wright on \"Jingle Bells\", with the rest of the cast.\n\nOn December 31, 2000, the duo performed their farewell concert at the Nashville Nightlife Theater in Nashville, Tennessee. They played to a full house of fans, family and friends that included Ricky Skaggs, The Whites, Marty Stuart, Connie Smith, Leona Williams, Tommy Cash, Jack Greene, Jean Shepard and comedian-impressionist, Johnny Counterfit.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nKitty Wells and Johnnie Wright were married on October 30, 1937.[1] Together they had three children, Ruby (1939–2009), Bobby.,[4] and Carol Sue. Each of their children enjoyed minor success individually as recording artists. Ruby, with a hit called \"Dern 'Ya\", an \"answer song\" to Roger Miller's \"Dang Me\"; and Bobby, with a series of country-pop hits in the early to mid-1970s, including \"Seasons in the Sun\" (covering Terry Jacks' No. 1 pop hit from 1974). Carol Sue, on a mid-1950s duet with Wells, titled \"How Far is Heaven\". Carol Sue and Ruby also had success with a pop hit as The Wright Sisters with \"That's Ok\" in the early 1960s. All three children performed as part of their parents' road show, while growing up.[1]\n\nJohnnie Wright died at his home of natural causes in Madison, Tennessee on September 27, 2011,[2] exactly two years after older daughter Ruby's death; and 33 days short of his 74th wedding anniversary with Wells. Wright had been in failing health for some time. He was survived by his wife of 73 years and their two surviving children Bobby and Carol Sue, plus eight grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren, and three great-great-grandchildren.[3]\n\nWright's widow Kitty Wells followed him in death less than ten months later on July 16, 2012.[5][6]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAlbums\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Album details US Country 1965 Hello Vietnam\n\nReleased: October 1965\n\nLabel: Decca Records\n\n5 1966 Country Music Special\n\nReleased: June 1966\n\nLabel: Decca Records\n\n40 1967 Country… The Wright Way\n\nReleased: June 1967\n\nLabel: Decca Records\n\n— 1968 Johnnie Wright Sings Country Favorites\n\nReleased: 1968\n\nLabel: Decca Records\n\n— We'll Stick Together (with Kitty Wells)\n\nReleased: August 1968\n\nLabel: Decca Records\n\n30 1972 Kitty Wells & Johnny Wright Sing\n\nHeartwarming Gospel Songs (with Kitty Wells)\n\nReleased: January 1972\n\nLabel: Decca Records\n\n— 1980 Johnnie Wright\n\nReleased: 1980\n\nLabel: Rubocca\n\n—\n\nSingles\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Single US Country US Cash Box Country Album 1963 \"Sweet Snow Dear\" — 40 Hello Vietnam 1964 \"Walkin', Talkin', Cryin', Barely Beatin' Broken Heart\" 22 41 \"Don't Give Up the Ship\" 37 — 1965 \"Blame It on the Moonlight\" 28 31 \"Hello Vietnam\" 1 1 \"Keep the Flag Flying\" 31 9 Country Music Special 1966 \"Nickels, Quarters and Dimes\" 31 28 \"I'm Doing This for Daddy\" 53 44 Country… The Wright Way \"Mama's Little Jewel\" 50 42 1967 \"Ole Honky Tonk\" — 50 Johnnie Wright Sings Country Favorites \"American Power\" 66 32 non-album single \"Music to Cry By\" 69 — Johnnie Wright Sings Country Favorites 1968 \"Atlanta Georgia Baby\" — — \"We'll Stick Together\" (with Kitty Wells) 54 25 We'll Stick Together \"(They Always Come Out) Smellin' Like a Rose\" 66 58 non-album singles 1969 \"Love Ain't Gonna Die (I'm Gonna Have to Kill It)\" — — \"Sing a Song About Love\" — — 1970 \"A Dear John Letter\" — — \"Love Everybody\" — — \"Where the Heart Aches Hang Around\" — — 1971 \"Old Honky Tonk\" — — \"High Cost of Livin'\" — — \"South in New Orleans\" — — 1972 \"Doo-Hickey\" — — \"Don't Let the Stars Get in Your Eyes\" — — 1973 \"Ode to a Country Bar\" — — 1974 \"Wild Passionate Lover\" — — 1976 \"I Never Told Him I Loved You\" — — 1980 \"Pressure\" — — Johnnie Wright 1982 \"Just a Simple Bouquet\" — — non-album singles 1984 \"The King Went on a Journey\" — —\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
