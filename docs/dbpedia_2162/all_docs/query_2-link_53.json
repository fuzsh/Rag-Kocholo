        "text": "Zayn Malik has been advised to \"leave an open door\" with his One Direction bandmates by Justin Timberlake's manager.\n\nJohnny Wright, who has managed the careers of boybands including the Backstreet Boys, *NSYNC and the Jonas Brothers, told Billboard that he would urge the singer not to cut ties with One Direction entirely.\n\nZayn Malik leaves One Direction: Is this the beginning of the end?\n\n\"My advice to him would be to always leave an open door with the band, so that there's time for him to develop and find himself, but always leave that door open so that he can come back,\" he said.\n\n\"As for how he might come back, if that's what he wants to do, it all comes down to the kind of record he decides to make.\"\n\nWright added that there is no \"blueprint\" for Malik to follow when progressing in his career but said that there are some important steps he should take.\n\n\"If he goes solo, I'd say make a great record, be humble and put in the work. Keep your doors open, take the time you need and make sure that if you decide to come back that you're coming back for the right reasons - not money or fame,\" he said.\n\nZayn Malik's most memorable One Direction moments\n\nWright added that he does not think Malik's departure will cause a huge problem for the rest of the group if they wish to continue.\n\n\"I wouldn't feel worried about their success moving forward unless they did something drastic that actually turned off their fans,\" he said.\n\n\"As far as them moving forward, the band is the band and as long as it continues to put on great shows and put out great music, I think the fans will be okay with it.\"\n\nMalik announced that he was leaving One Direction on Wednesday (March 25), stating that he wants to be \"a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight\".\n\nHe added: \"I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.\""
