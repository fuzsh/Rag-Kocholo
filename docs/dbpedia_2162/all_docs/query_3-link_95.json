        "text": "Service for Johnny David Wright will be conducted at 10:00 A.M., Wednesday, December 15, 2021 in the Crosier-Pearson Cleburne Chapel. Burial will follow in Rosehill Cemetery.\n\nJohnny David Wright was born in Brownfield, Texas on August 30 1939. He went to his heavenly home on December 9, 2021, at the age of 82.\n\nJD will be greatly missed by his loving wife of 57 years, Sharon, their son Johnny David Wright, and his wife, LeiAnn. Daughter, Jelema Sharon Wright-Schoessow and her husband, Brian.\n\nHis grandchildren, Brittany Schoessow-Redmon, and husband Hayden. Haden Wright and wife, Hannah. Cassidy Wright-Van Zandt and husband Ryan, and bonus grandchild, Hailey, along with her siblings, and his great grandchildren, Raylei and Hadlei.\n\nHe is survived by one sister, Sharion, and one brother, Billy Paul. Five Brothers and sisters by marriage, Ron Womack, Wally and Jainy Womack, Linda Womack, and Steve and Patricia Duty\n\nHe will be missed greatly by his many nieces and nephews, Each having fond memories of their Uncle JD. He showed love and kindness to each one of them.\n\nJD and Sharon moved to Cleburne 35 years ago. JD has been a Church of Christ minister for many years, sharing the love of God with people through teaching and through his kindness, gentleness, and unconditional love.\n\nHe enjoyed his time as owner of several full service stations, his latest being Gasoline Alley in Cleburne. He enjoyed meeting, serving, and visiting, with his many friends and customers. He later worked for the City of Cleburne, retiring from there in 2008.\n\nHis family and friends have been left with great memories! One, of course, would be his love of Chrysler products, and he loved to tell stories about racing his '64 Plymouth Sport Fury with a 383 Police Interceptor!\n\nHe loved history, and enjoyed talking about his time in the US Navy. He was always telling a dad joke, or some sort of silly riddle! Just one of his dad jokes for you to think about...If a rooster lays an egg on the peak of a roof, will the egg roll down the left or the right?\n\nJD loved his coffee! Speaking of coffee, JD was a great host, and within minutes of being in their home, he'd be offering you a cup of coffee. He just loved people.\n\nIf you ever had the privilege of taking a short drive, or a long trip, with JD and Sharon, you knew what song he'd be singing \"On the Road Again\" and now, he has reached his ultimate destination!\n\nJD loved popcorn, and he loved his peanut butter and Karo syrup!\n\nHe loved his family deeply.\n\nHe loved preaching,\n\nBut most of all, he loved GOD. He spent many years teaching God's Word, and lived a life that left a great legacy for those he loved.\n\nAs he so often said to the young men of the family, we now say to him.. JD, you were truly a gentleman, a scholar, and a prince among men.\n\nIn the words of Papa John... Bye for now."
