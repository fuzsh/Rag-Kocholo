        "text": "Carpenter Ant Info for Kids & Adults\n\nCarpenter ants get their name because they build their nests in wood. Unlike human carpenters who help fix your house, carpenter ants can cause major damage to a house. They put huge holes in the wood of your house to build their nests. The queen of a colony starts her nest deep within wood, then raises the baby carpenter ants there, feeding them saliva and never leaving the nest or feeding herself during this time.\n\nWhen baby carpenter ants grow up, they become workers with the job of gathering food to feed the next generation. The colony population grows very quickly. It can eventually produce 2,000 or more workers.\n\nThere are many types of carpenter ants throughout the U.S., measuring in size from one-quarter inch (about the width of a pencil) for a worker carpenter ant to three-quarters of an inch (about the size of a quarter) for a queen carpenter ant. Read on for more fun carpenter ant facts for kids.\n\nSize: 5/8\"\n\nShape: Oval\n\nColor: Range in color from red to black\n\nLegs: 6\n\nWings: Varies\n\nAntenna: Yes\n\nCommon Name: Carpenter ant\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Arthropoda\n\nClass: Insecta\n\nOrder: Hymenoptera\n\nFamily: Formicidea\n\nSpecies: Camponotus\n\nOdorous House Ant Facts for Kids\n\nSomething that is odorous smells bad. The odorous house ant gets its name because it commonly nests in or around houses, and because it stinks when crushed. Imagine the smell of a rotten coconut. This is what youâ€™ll smell if you step on one of these ants. They are from the United States, and they are very social. Colonies can include up to 100,000 ants!\n\nSize: 1/16\" to 1/8\"\n\nShape: Segmented, oval\n\nColor: Brown or black\n\nLegs: 6\n\nWings: Varies\n\nAntenna: Yes\n\nCommon Name: Odorous house ant\n\nKingdom: Animalia\n\nPhylum: Arthropoda\n\nClass: Insecta\n\nOrder: Hymenoptera\n\nFamily: Formicidae\n\nSpecies: Tapinoma sessile\n\nRed Imported Fire Ant Facts for Kids\n\nRed imported fire ants may have a cool name, and an even cooler nickname (RIFA). But be warned: they are more aggressive than other ant species on the planet. And they have a really painful sting. They should always be avoided!\n\nRed imported fire ants can adapt to many climates and conditions in and around their environment. For example, if the colony senses increased water levels in their nests, they will come together and form a huge ball or raft that is able to float on the water! So yes, they are cool. But very dangerous.
