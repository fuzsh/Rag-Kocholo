        "text": "Length\n\nWorkers: 3-6 mm (0.1-0.2 in). Female: 8-9 mm (0.3-0.4 in). Wings of females about 10 mm (0.4 in) long (Wheeler 1908). Replete can reach a size of 3 cm, or 1 g (0.04 oz) (Snelling 1976).\n\nGeneral Appearance\n\nBicolored ant with shiny head and thorax. Reddish to dark brown with blackish abdomen. Replete’s abdomen structured with stiff plates and soft connective tissue that expands when storing liquid. Skin mildly granulated with tiny hairs that may cover all areas, except connective tissue of repletes. See Snelling (1976) for measurements and detailed scientific description.\n\nActivity Patterns\n\nDiurnal (although many other Myrmecocystus species nocturnal) (Wehner 2020). Low activity during cool or rainy weather, or periods of excessive heat (Cazier and Statham 1962).\n\nNests\n\nLocated in open areas between plants. Entrance is a rounded crater (5-7 in, or 13-17 cm, across), comprised of small- or medium-sized pebbles and soil surrounded by discarded debris (Wheeler 1908; Cazier and Statham 1962). Snelling (1976) states that M. mimicus prefers clay soils and makes low crescent-shaped mounds with an entrance concealed by a clump of dense grass.\n\nColony Formation\n\nQueens search on the ground while selecting new nest sites (Schooley and Bestelmeyer 2000). Colonies often cooperatively founded by more than one fertile queen (pleometrosis), but workers eliminate all but one queen during transition to mature colony (Bartz and Hölldobler 1982; Rissing et al. 2000; Schooley and Bestelmeyer 2000). Developing M. mimicus colonies spaced close together, but in eliminating rivals over time, consolidate to form dispersed mature colonies (Hölldobler 1981; Bartz and Hölldobler 1982; Pollock and Rissing 1989). Mature colony size may range from approximately 20-130 individuals (Bartz and Hölldobler 1982).\n\nAggression and Defense\n\nWithin species: M. mimicus hold flexible, temporary foraging territories to take advantage of patchy food resources. Colonies engage in ritualized “tournaments” — aggressive displays — to defend territorial boundaries without fighting (Hölldobler 1976; Hölldobler and Lumsden 1980; Bartz and Hölldobler 1982). Confront each other by walking on their leg tips, raising head and abdomen, and drumming antennae around opponent’s abdomen; also kick (Hölldobler 1981; Lumsden and Hölldobler 1983). When one colony is considerably weaker (smaller worker force), its broods and repletes are raided and often incorporated into the dominant colony’s worker force (Hölldobler 1976; Hölldobler 1981; Bartz and Hölldobler 1982; Lumsden and Hölldobler 1983; Kronauer et al. 2003).\n\nBetween species: Myrmecocystus depilis (Kronauer et al. 2003) and Dorymyrmex pyramicus (Cazier and Statham 1962) known to raid M. mimicus colonies.\n\nCommunication\n\nAppear to use chemical trails to recruit nestmates (foragers) when termite prey detected (Hölldobler 1981). Also see Aggression and Defense.\n\nDiet and Feeding\n\nTermites, scale and other insects, sap and nectar from flowers, and honeydew from aphids (Cazier and Statham 1962; Snelling 1976; Blom and Clark 1980; Hölldobler 1981). A general scavenger (Snelling 1976; Fisher and Cover 2007; Wehner 2020). Hölldobler (1981) observed M. mimicus carrying seeds.\n\nRob neighboring ants (e.g., Pogonomyrmex spp.) of food, particularly of termite prey (Hölldobler 1986). Workers defend food sources against competing honeypot ant colonies (Hölldobler and Wilson 1990).\n\nPredators\n\nRound-tailed horned lizard, Phrynosoma modestum (Shaffer and Whitford 1981). Some mammals, such as badger, dig into chambers to eat honeypots (Chew 1979; Bert Hölldobler, personal communication, 2021).\n\nInterspecies Interaction\n\nM. mimicus observed pulling scarab beetles into its nests and also ejecting them from nests; association not understood (Cazier and Statham 1962).\n\nRelationship with Humans\n\nIndigenous peoples in southwest North America consider honeypot ants a delicacy (Kronauer et al. 2004)."
