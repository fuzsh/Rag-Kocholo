        "text": "The Greatest Generation (GI Generation) Born 1901–1927 The Silent Generation Born 1928–1945 Baby Boom Generation Born 1946–1964 Generation X Born 1965–1980 Millennial Generation or Generation Y Born 1981–1996 Generation Z or iGen Born 1997–2010 Generation Alpha Born 2010-2024\n\nDefining Generation Names and Dates\n\nA generation is a group of people born at roughly the same time. They're usually grouped by a 20-year time interval, says Deborah Carr, PhD, professor and chair of the sociology department of Boston University and author of Golden Years? Social Inequalities in Later Life.\n\n\"Generations take on special meaning because their members tend to experience critical life events and transitions at particular historical moments, and these moments define their lives,\" says Dr. Carr. Indeed, generations influence everything from baby name trends to parenting styles.\n\nThe Greatest Generation (GI Generation): Born 1901–1927\n\nThis generation lived through the Great Depression and then went off to fight in World War II. Notably, they popularized jazz and swing music, but don't be fooled by the wild provocations of the cultural preferences of the times. Due to the current events of this generation, the challenge of raising a family put a premium on traits like hard work and grit.\n\nThe Silent Generation: Born 1928–1945\n\nThe silent generation famously got their name for being so conformist that they were silent through the MacCarthy era when the fear of Communism swept the country. During this era, kids were expected to earn their way through life using a strong work ethic.\n\nBaby Boom Generation: Born 1946–1964\n\nGen Z may think of Baby Boomers as their out-of-touch grandparents (as in \"OK, Boomer\"), but this generation actually had a wild youth we often don't talk about. Boomers are named for the population \"boom\" that occurred after WWII, and many young people of this generation defied their parents, protested the Vietnam War, and created the \"Summer of Love.\"\n\nBoomer parents notably redefined parenting by being the first generation to look at their kids' perspective of growing up, and they started the concept of having family meetings.\n\nGeneration X: Born 1965–1980\n\nSo often dismissed as the slacker generation, Generation X lived through the AIDS epidemic, MTV culture, and a shifting landscape that would give rise to LGBTQ+ rights.\n\nGeneration X parents were the first to use helicopter parenting styles. Unlike their Boomer parents, who famously let their kids stay outside until the streetlights came on, Gen X'ers tend to be far more involved with their children's social and educational development.\n\nMillennial Generation or Generation Y: Born 1981–1996\n\nMillennials lived through 9/11, remember when Amazon only sold books, and are also the first generation to know a childhood both with and without the internet, which now plays a significant role in their personal lives.\n\nWhile Boomers may accuse Millennials of being self-centered and impatient due to their excessive use of technology, this generation has proven to be incredibly community-oriented and environmentally conscious, which are traits being picked up by their children.\n\nWhen it comes to parenting, millennials are more likely than prior generations to encourage their children to live as their authentic selves, and they're leading the movement in helping gender non-conforming kids be happy with who they are, points out Carr. \"Some millennial parents, who were 'helicoptered over' in their youth, are taking on a freer approach to parenting, allowing their children to explore and create without constant structure or supervision.\"\n\nGeneration Z or iGen: Born 1997–2010\n\nGeneration Z kids are the first to be born into a world where they know nothing besides constant connection to one another, albeit through phones, screens, and tablets. However, like millennials before them, Gen Z'ers are often environmentally conscious, inclusive and accepting of others, and extremely politically aware—despite many of them not yet being of voting age.\n\nGeneration Alpha: Born 2010-2024\n\nKids born between 2010 and 2024 are part of Generation Alpha. Generation Alpha is the first generation of kids who will never know a time when social media didn't exist, and they are far more tech-savvy than any generation previously, which is a powerful tool that can change humanity in myriad positive ways.\n\nIt may be too soon to peg the Alphas as this or that based on how little we know about them so far. However, there are a few things we understand: Some Gen Alphas are the first to be born amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they're more diverse than any other generation, and they're more likely to be in a single-parent household.\n\nLike the generations that came before them, every passing year will shape the cultural perception of who they are. In the meantime, parents get the pride and honor to help guide them to making the best choices possible."
