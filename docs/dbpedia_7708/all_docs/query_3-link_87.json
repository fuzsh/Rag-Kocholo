        "text": "Weâve all seen a news report about someone who got rushed to the emergency room in âcriticalâ condition. Or read a more hopeful story about someone whoâs doing \"fair\" at the hospital. But what do those words really mean?\n\nIn the media, hospital terms that describe a patientâs condition -- like critical, fair, serious, stable -- are vague by design. They give you just a general sense of how someone is doing, which helps protect the patient's privacy.\n\nIn your personal life, a doctor or nurse at a hospital might use similar terms to tell you how an injured or sick loved one is doing. How much more detail they go into depends on things like your relationship with the person and the urgency of the situation.\n\nSome hospitals use a standard set of one-word terms developed by the American Hospital Association (AHA) when they describe a patientâs condition to the press:\n\nUndetermined\n\nGood\n\nFair\n\nSerious\n\nCritical\n\nBut not all hospitals define these terms exactly the same way.\n\nYou might also hear the word âcriticalâ used to describe the type of treatment someone needs. People with life-threatening illnesses or injuries need critical care, usually in a hospitalâs intensive care unit (ICU).\n\nIf they need treatments to help them stay alive (called life support), they can also get those in the ICU. A few types of life support are:\n\nA machine that helps you breathe, called a ventilator\n\nTechniques to restart a stopped heart, like CPR and electric shocks (defibrillation)\n\nTube feeding to give you nutrients and hydration\n\nLife support treatments don't necessarily mean a patient's condition is life-threatening. Sometimes doctors use them temporarily until the person is well enough to function on their own.\n\nInstead, many hospitals just use the term âstableâ to describe when someoneâs vital signs are steady, or not changing much.\n\nWhile itâs common for doctors to use the word stable to describe a patient whoâs in good condition, not everyone considers it to be that clear-cut. Since thereâs no agreed-upon medical definition for the word, some researchers say that one doctorâs idea of âstableâ might be anotherâs idea of âunstable.â\n\nThe bottom line is this: If you read or watch a news report that uses one word to describe a personâs condition, itâs meant to be general and vague. If you have a loved one in the hospital and their doctor or nurse explains their condition with a word thatâs not clear to you, ask them to explain what they mean. Donât feel bad about asking."
