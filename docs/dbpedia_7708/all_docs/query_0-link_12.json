        "text": "Woody Allen has played many implausible characters in his career: a human sperm, a failed writer, an aging nebbish who remains irresistibly attractive to gorgeous Barnard students. Yet none is as preposterous as the one that he assumes, by voice and persona, in the new and critically acclaimed animated feature, Antz.\n\nAllen plays Z, a whiny, disgruntled worker ant who digs dirt and falls in love with Bala, a whiny, disgruntled princess ant played by Sharon Stone. Z's best friend is Weaver, a hypertrophic soldier ant, played by that he-man's he-haw man, Sylvester Stallone. Weaver's boss, and Bala's fiance, is the tyrannical General Mandible, who has the voice of Gene Hackman and the eternal jaw of George C. \"Patton\" Scott. General Mandible barks to his soldiers, \"Men, let's move it!\" and \"Gentlemen, now you can see how dangerous individualism is!\"\n\nAntz is a cute movie. It is a visually dazzling movie. It has some amusing, ant-appropriate lines in it, as when Z complains to his therapist about having been neglected by his parents; but what else can you expect, he sighs, when you are \"the middle child in a family of 5-million?\" Nevertheless, any viewer who knows about ants cannot help but feel disgruntled, a case of rantz in the pantz.\n\nLet's start with the movie's ad line: \"Every ant has HIS day\" (emphasis added). If there is any group of creatures in the animal kingdom for which that possessive pronoun is inappropriate and unjust, it is ants. You might as well say \"Every nun has his day\" or \"Every mythical one-breasted Amazon warrior has his day.\" Edward O. Wilson of Harvard University, a leading authority on ants, estimates that a million-billion ants are alive in the world today. The sum biomass of ants, he says, weighs four times as much as birds, amphibians, reptiles and mammals combined.\n\nAnd that staggering ant biomass is almost exclusively female. If you could examine each of the earth's million-billion ants, you would almost surely fail to find an example of a Woody Worker or a Sly Soldier. You would not find a male ant that digs dirt, cuts leaves, lugs sandwich crumbs back to the nest, or takes on invading termites, as General Mandible's troops do with unmistakably androgenic roars.\n\nInstead, nearly every task that is performed in an ant colony is performed by females. They build the nest, they defend the nest, they tend the larvae to insure a continuous supply of female labor. Male ants almost do not exist. In the average colony, they account for less than one percent of the population, and those that exist live very brief lives.\n\nSo what do these rare specimens do? To get an idea, think back to Allen's literally seminal role in Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex. Male ants subsist solely to inseminate the queen during her so-called nuptial flight, when she flies out of her nest in search of sperm. The males are there to greet her, and she mates with one or more, storing their contributions internally to use as needed. \"Males are really just bags of sperm,\" said Kenneth Ross, an entomologist at the University of Georgia in Athens. They are non-refillable bags, alas, and they do not store well. \"With almost no exception, males die immediately after mating,\" said Ross. \"If they haven't mated by the time winter comes, they are cannibalized by the workers.\"\n\nThe same principle of female dominance applies to the other famously social insects, the honeybees. In their case, scientists have given the males a wonderfully evocative name, drones. Honeybee drones do not work, and they do not overwinter.\n\nAmong ants and bees, the overwhelming majority of the females are sterile. They do not breed, but instead live to serve the queen and the tribe, each in her specialized fashion. Colonies of ants and bees have been called superorganisms because the individuals act with such a high degree of coordination and interdependence that they might as well be cells of the body.\n\nBehind that willingness to sacrifice self for the whole is an unusually high degree of genetic relatedness. For most animals, including humans, siblings share about 50 percent of their genes. Among ants and bees, by contrast, the sister workers in a colony are, on average, 75 percent related to each other, the result of a complex system of genetic inheritance given the appropriately thick name of haplodiploidy.\n\nThat shared legacy encourages each worker to behave as though the ants to each side of her are practically as valuable as she is. And that state of group-think in turn helps explain why ants are, as Wilson has written, \"the dominant little-sized organisms of the planet.\"\n\nThe catch for the males is that they do not share and fare alike. Male ants (and bees) have only half the number of chromosomes seen in the females. As a result, they are much less closely related to their female peers than the workers are to each other. A male cannot depend on the unshakable bonds of close kinship to save his chitin. His hope rests in the queen's nuptial flight, when she emerges to gather semen. His hope is that she chooses him and his. So maybe a male ant does have his day _ but that day will be his last.\n\nNote to Z: Stop whining, keep digging and dress in drag."
