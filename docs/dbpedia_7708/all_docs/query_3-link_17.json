        "text": "Characteristics of this emerging generation\n\nUnderstanding and defining traits of Generation Z is key for employers and leaders to better attract, retain and engage with this emerging generation.\n\n1. Digital\n\nGen Z are digital integrators. They have integrated technology seamlessly into their lives. Having used it from the youngest age, it is almost like the air they breathe, permeating all areas of their lifestyle and relationships.\n\n2. Global\n\nGen Z is the first generation to be truly global. Music, movies and celebrities are more global for them than they have been for previous generations. Through technology, globalisation and our culturally diverse times, the fashions, foods, online entertainment and social trends are global as never before.\n\n3. Social\n\nMore than any other generation, today’s youth are extensively connected to and shaped by their peers. Due to social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram, Gen Z are influenced by a network that is larger both numerically and geographically, and being technology based, their network is connected 24/7. This technology, while helping to facilitate their relational world can also negatively impact it. Our research shows that a quarter of students who have been bullied, have been bullied via social media, text messages or email (24%).\n\n4. Mobile\n\nNot only are Gen Z mobile in terms of using technology constantly and when they are on-the-go, they are also moving homes, jobs, and careers faster than ever before. Today’s school leaver is expected to have 18 jobs across 6 careers.\n\n5. Visual\n\nWhile Google has 3.5 million searches per day, almost 5 billion videos are watched on YouTube every day. We have an emerging generation, many of whom are opting to watch a video summarising an issue rather than read an article discussing it.\n\nIntroducing Generation Alpha\n\nBorn since the year 2010, they are the children of the Millennials. They are the first generation who will be entirely born and shaped in the 21st century, and the first generation that we will see in record numbers in the 22nd century as well.\n\nThey are logged on and linked up – known as ‘digital natives’. They are the most materially endowed and technologically literate generation to ever grace the planet!"
