        "text": "Whether to use an additional s with singular possession can still be a source of heated debate. This review will help to resolve some of the questions surrounding that subject.\n\nRule 1: Many common nouns end in the letter s (lens, cactus, bus, etc.). So do a lot of proper nouns (Mr. Jones, Texas, Christmas). There are conflicting policies and theories about how to show possession when writing such nouns. There is no right answer; the best advice is to choose a formula and stay consistent.\n\nSome writers and editors add ’s to every proper noun, be it Hastings’s or Jones’s. There also are a few who add only an apostrophe to all nouns ending in s; however, this method is typically rare, and not recommended here.\n\nOne method, common in newspapers and magazines, is to add an apostrophe plus s (’s) to common nouns ending in s, but only a stand-alone apostrophe to proper nouns ending in s.\n\nExamples:\n\nthe class’s hours\n\nMr. Jones’ golf clubs\n\nThe canvas’s size\n\nTexas’ weather\n\nAnother widely used technique, the one we favor, is to write the word as we would speak it. For example, since most people saying “Mr. Hastings’ pen” would not pronounce an added s, we would write Mr. Hastings’ pen with no added s. On the other hand, most people would pronounce an added s in “Jones’s,” so we’d write it as we say it: Mr. Jones’s golf clubs. This method explains the punctuation of for goodness’ sake.\n\nRule 2: To show plural possession of a word ending in an s or s sound, form the plural first; then immediately use the apostrophe.\n\nExamples:\n\nthe classes’ hours\n\nthe Joneses’ car\n\nguys’ night out\n\ntwo actresses’ roles\n\nPop Quiz\n\nPlace the apostrophe (and perhaps an s) where appropriate.\n\n1. The classes opinions were predictable according to their grade levels.\n\n2. The boss suit was brand new.\n\n3. The bus steering wheel was wearing out.\n\n4. The Crosses dog bit the mailman.\n\n5. We understand Lagos airport handled over one million passengers last year.\n\n6. The Smiths boat sank.\n\nPop Quiz Answers\n\n1.
