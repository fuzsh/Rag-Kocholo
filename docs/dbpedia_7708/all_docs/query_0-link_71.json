        "text": "In the movie “Antz”, the producers tied many governmental issues into the story. The colony was led like a Monarchy, Communism, and Democracy. Communism for example was a major part of the story. Communism is a system where everything belongs to \"the community\", so people own nothing much more than the clothes on their back, and the State owns everything.

The queen (Monarchy) is mostly in the movie just for the show because she rarely gets to make any choices. General Mandible decided to flood the whole colony without the queen knowing, and a lot of the soldiers followed him.
