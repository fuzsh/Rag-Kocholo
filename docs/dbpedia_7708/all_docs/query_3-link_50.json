        "text": "Welcome to the NPR series where we spotlight the people and things making headlines — and the stories behind them.\n\nA recent poll shows that public support for labor organizing is the highest it's been in decades. But union membership is at an all-time low. Will Gen Z bridge that gap?\n\nWho are they? This week, it's the roughly 9,000 workers at Rutgers University who went on strike.\n\nBetter pay, job stability, and benefits for employees are among worker demands.\n\nWhat's the big deal? Well, the strike at Rutgers is part of a larger trend in labor politics, where more young workers are embracing unions and the potential protections they can bring to the workplace.\n\nWant more on politics? Listen to Consider This episode on how one of the expelled Tennessee lawmakers could be back in the state house soon.\n\nWhat are people saying?\n\nThe Rutgers unions on their strikes:\n\nThe administration doesn't understand that we are determined to fight together for equal pay for equal work, a living wage for all, real job security, race and gender equity, and a fair salary increase. We have no other choice than to go on strike to build a university that truly values its workers and its students.\n\nThe frat bros on campus:\n\nRutgers University President Jonathan Holloway in an email statement on the strike:\n\nTo say that this is deeply disappointing would be an understatement, especially given that just two days ago, both sides agreed in good faith to the appointment of a mediator to help us reach agreements.\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's statement that invited both parties to negotiate in his office:\n\nSo, what now?\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Democratic lawmakers have backed the sentiments in the PRO Act, which would impose heftier penalties on employers who try to squash unionization drives.\n\nLearn more:"
