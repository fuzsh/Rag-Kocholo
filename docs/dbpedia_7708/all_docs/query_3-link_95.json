To me - and I know it's not just me because I see a lot of other people say the same thing - the z6 and z7 were just way too small to feel comfortable while the z8 feels just about right, and apart from the ergonomics of it the size of the z8 feels much more robust and professional to me. I know it's a personal thing for me and there's no offense intended to anyone else, but I could never feel comfortable showing up to do some kind of paid photography with something the size of the z6... it would just make me feel self-conscious that the client would be looking at me and thinking they'd gone and hired an amateur. ...Show more →\n\nI agree. Get shoes that fit your feet and the camera that fits your hand. The very small bodies are just not comfortable for me to use. The Z6 is the smallest I like to go personally. But lots of folk have smaller hands or have physical limitations and not to forget that half of all photographers are women and they mostly prefer the smaller lighter options. It is great to have something for everyone.\n\nkwalsh\n\nOffline\n\n   \n\n: Off\n\np.3 #11 · p.3 #11 · Nikon Z7III dead or alive?\n\nPersonally I have no interest in a camera the size of the Z8. It gives me things I dont need while adding bulk that I also dont need.\n\nI have even less interest in a MF camera, especially when factoring in lens size (worse still any functional telephoto options, which for me at least I consider critical for landscape work if you dont want to be just churning the same boring compositions).\n\nSo I at least would really like to see a Z7III. Id like it to have not so much speed, but the convenience features of recent cameras (e.g. less stupid AF interfaces, but not necessarily super fast). A resolution boost to 60MP or higher is definitely useful to me because the optics clearly support it and more pixels on a crop is useful.\n\nIm personally not very price sensitive, more size and functionality sensitive. I dont care much about speed so slower high resolution sensors are OK for me.\n\nBut thats just me, while the real question is what is a sustainable market niche?\n\nSo long term I think Nikon does need a high resolution Z6/Z7 body and that the Z8 is the new Z7 is suboptimal. But I also think quite possibly in the short term there just isnt the right mix of sensor availability to produce a camera that Nikon thinks will be competitive enough to recoup costs. They clearly waited until they felt everything was right to release the Z9 and Z8. I could imagine right now the Z7III is in a similar state of waiting. As already pointed out by others striking the right balance in sensor implementation and how that fits into the market and future product lines is a critical decision.\n\nIll add that functionally for me a high res Zf would probably meet my desires quite well, but Im not sure market wise that would be better or worse for Nikon than a Z7 format body.\n\nunchecked\n\nOffline\n\n \n\n: Off\n\np.3 #12 · p.3 #12 · Nikon Z7III dead or alive?\n\nEric214 wrote:\n\nBut that's going to take a year IF they drop the price of the Z6III and at that point what's the point of a a Z7III? I don't think there will be a Z7III. It just has no place. That is what Nikon is saying when they say they are evaluating the market. Sounds like they are saying not likely but will monitor the market and see if anything changes\n\nOh it'll drop by Christmas. The Z8 dropped by $300 for Christmas last year. Give the Z6iii 3 to 6 months and street prices will go down gradually and then stabilize at maybe $300~$500 off MSRP by the year. Cameras don't have yearly refresh cycles like phones and don't get bought in volumes like phones. The discounts will kick in soon after the initial rush is over and production catches up and start filling up storage space.\n\nIt's not that the Z7iii doesn't have it's place. You have the pockets of users who want more than 24MP but don't want to spend $3.5k on a Z8 or $4k+ on a Z8ii when it gets released. There's your market. When Nikon says they're evaluating the market, they could be just trying to ascertain that it's not a matter of \"correlation doesn't mean causation\". And again, the Z7 and Z7ii sales gave them cold feet. It will take a while for those feet to get warm again.\n\ncoralnut\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.3 #15 · p.3 #15 · Nikon Z7III dead or alive?\n\ningekj wrote:\n\nThe Z7 has till now been a A7R line competitor focused on landscapes and portraits not really speed. I dont know if sony has anything else than the 61mp sensor for this available at the moment and that is probably not enough of a step up from current Z7 or Z8/9 that it makes sense now. Theyre probably waiting for something like a 80MP sensor becoming available, doubt it will be particularly fast as the Z6, 8 and 9 provides that already.\n\nYes. The reason for the Z7 series is to have a high-res sensor in a camera that doesn't require all of the raw speed processing power of the cameras that are designed for fast-moving objects. I think there will always be room for a camera that uses the top resolution sensor, but doesn't require all of the state of the art electronics for processing fast action scenes. Those electronics are a lot of what differentiates the Z7 from the Z8/9 series.\n\nIMO an upgrade to the Z7ii will really need a significant resolution upgrade, as high resolution is it's reason for being. There's not much to be gained by moving from a 45MP to a 60MP sensor because Sony has already occupied that space for a long time. If Nikon wants to deliver a camera that will set the bar in it's market niche, it will need to beat Sony's 60MP offerings; just matching Sony's 60MP is not a recipe for beating the competition. A Z7iii needs to have more than 60MP or it's not worth the trouble for Nikin to design it and not worth the money for customers to upgrade.\n\n80-100MP would be an outstanding upgrade. 80MP might be do-able but 100MP seems like hoping for too much.\n\nDWOfPaul\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.3 #16 · p.3 #16 · Nikon Z7III dead or alive?\n\nSure I wouldn't mind seeing a Z7III at 60MP+, but I feel like for Nikon to complete their lineup they need another FF camera with 45MP+. Realistically that probably means a Z7III, possibly they could do a ZFR. I would even take a Z7III with the Z7II 45MP sensor, if it came with all the improvements the Z line has gotten since such as Expeed 7, faster turn on time, better IBIS, better body build, and better EVF. The Z7II is showing it's age now.\n\nPersonally I am in a spot where the Z8 hits all the right spots as my action body, but to fully make the transition to a Z kit I need a landscape body too. Technically I could get a second Z8, but so far I have never had two of the same bodies in my kit as having two different bodies usually gets you a wide capability set then two of the same exact bodies.\n\ncoralnut\n\nOffline\n\n  \n\n: Off\n\np.3 #17 · p.3 #17 · Nikon Z7III dead or alive?\n\nWhen it comes to a 'landscape body' I don't think of needing all of the bells and whistles that the Z line has recently obtained, like 'xpeed 7, faster turn on time, better IBIS... and better EVF.' To me those are fast-action requirements that aren't really necessary for landscape use; when I think 'landscape' I think mostly about resolution because I'll be shooting at a relaxed pace on a tripod and EVF blackout won't be an issue.\n\nAs the cameras continue to deliver increasing resolution we're going into run into a problem when DLA begins to rear it's ugly head. From a functional standpoint, the diffraction limited aperture of the sensors keeps forcing us to use larger apertures as the pixel size becomes smaller. At 45MP we're already at a point where DLA effects begin to limit our use of small apertures beyond f/7.1, or f/6.2 for the Sony 62MP sensor. The only cure for that is to employ high resolution with larger pixels, which forces us into medium format.\n\nIf you believe the math, it tells us that the pursuit of increasing resolution in the 24x36 format is a bit of a fool's errand unless we're willing to rely on large apertures. To maintain the smaller apertures the size of the sensor die needs to increase without the pixels getting smaller. The best results will come from large format digital photography with a higher pixel count comprised of larger pixels than those commonly in use today. The challenge will then change from packing as many pixels as possible into the same senor size, to making the actual sensors much larger.\n\nEdited on Jun 20, 2024 at 01:55 PM · View previous versions\n\nSteve Spencer\n\nOffline\n\n     \n\n: On\n\np.3 #18 · p.3 #18 · Nikon Z7III dead or alive?\n\ncope07 wrote:\n\nNow with the intro of the Z6iii I am trying to figure out if the Z7iii is a likelihood (probably late this year or next spring)\n\nArguments for:\n\n-with the Zf and Z6iii it seems that Nikon is ok having cameras priced with $500 gaps.

I think the Z7 III could be a lot like the Sony camera with perhaps the same sensor (it is a good sensor) with Nikon tweaks, and the Sony has a flippy screen that I was surprised that I actually liked. Unlike you I do like the 60MP Sony sensor for IQ and I even like it slightly better than the 45MP sensor in my Z7, and I think a 60MP sensor with Nikon tweaks would be fantastic. So I see a Z6 III body, with ZF AF, and a Nikon tweaked 60MP Sony sensor as a pretty compelling Z7 III and I think Nikon could do well selling that in the $3,250 price range."
