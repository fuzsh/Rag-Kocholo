The 1998 animated adventure comedy focuses on an ant named Z who does not feel significant in his anthill and meets Princess Bala who is going through the same problem.\n\nHere’s how you can watch and stream Antz via streaming services such as Netflix.\n\nIs Antz available to watch via streaming?\n\nYes, Antz is available to watch via streaming on Netflix.\n\nThe film is directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson with a screenplay by Todd Alcott, Chris Weltz, and Paul Weltz. It is an engaging tale of a curious worker named Z who feels irrelevant and begins to fall in love with Princess Bala who is stuck with the same problem. Later, he faces a challenge in the form of Officer General Mandible who poses a danger to the entire worker population. The movie received critical acclaim and became a blockbuster at the box office.\n\nThe movie features a talented voice cast of Woody Allen as Z-4195 “Z”, Sharon Stone as Princess Bala, Jennifer Lopez as Azteca, and Sylvester Stallone as Weaver. It also features Christopher Walken as Colonel Cutter, Dan Aykroyd as Chip, Gene Hackman as General Mandible, and others.\n\nWatch Antz streaming via Netflix\n\nAntz is available to watch on Netflix.\n\nNetflix is a global streaming service offering a vast library of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and original content across various genres and languages. Subscribers can stream content on-demand on multiple devices, with options for offline viewing. With a user-friendly interface and personalized recommendations, Netflix has become a household name, providing entertainment to millions of subscribers worldwide.\n\nYou can watch the film via Netflix by following these steps:\n\nVisit netflix.com/signup\n\nChoose a payment plan from the following:\n\n$6.99 per month (standard with Ads)\n\n$15.49 per month (Standard)\n\n$22.99 per month (Premium)\n\nEnter your email address and password to create an account\n\nEnter your chosen payment method\n\nThe cheapest Netflix Standard with Ads Plan provides all but a few of its movies and TV shows. However, it will show ads before or during most of its content. You can watch in Full HD and on two supported devices at a time.\n\nIts Standard Plan provides the same but is completely ad-free while also allowing users to download content on two supported devices with an additional option to add one extra member who doesn’t live in the same household.\n\nThe Premium Plan provides the same as above, though for four supported devices at a time, with content displaying in Ultra HD. Users get to download content on up to six supported devices at a time and have the option to add up to two extra members who don’t live in the same household. Netflix spatial audio is also supported.\n\nAntz’s synopsis is as follows:\n\n”A neurotic worker ant in love with a rebellious princess rises to unlikely stardom when he switches places with a soldier. Signing up to march in a parade, he ends up under the command of a bloodthirsty general. But he’s actually been enlisted to fight against a termite army.”\n\nNOTE: The streaming services listed above are subject to change.
