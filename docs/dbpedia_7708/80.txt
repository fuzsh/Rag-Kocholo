Positive Role Models

The females are feisty, brave, and smart. Z, the leading male character, is initially self-involved and ineffectual -- his character learns important lessons and finally uses all the resources at hand to save the day. Z's an unlikely hero who admits his mistakes, and proves loyal and courageous. The villain is a military officer -- one of his assistants regains his "humanity" and joins forces with the heroes.

Parents need to know that Antz is an animated comedy that will have lots of appeal for teens and adults, especially for fans of Woody Allen's brand of humor -- ironic social commentary and perpetual worry. However, the action in this film is substantial. It's meant to be exaggerated and funny, but though the victims are ants and other insects, for young or sensitive kids they're relatable characters -- â€“ living, breathing beings with human voices. There are many deaths: great battles occur along with the aftermath on fields covered with bodies (and include a sad deathbed scene of a well-liked ant soldier). The strutting villain tortures two heroes and threatens to drown the entire ant colony; the ants escape the rushing waters with no time to spare. Other characters are blown to smithereens or turned to ash. Two couples flirt, fall in love, and kiss. There's some potty language and swearing ("tight-ass," "hell," "damn," "anus," "crap") and the ants have a local pub in which they drink an intoxicating beverage.
