        "text": "Mass layoffs are a difficult but common occurrence in the business world that leaves many employees wondering how they’ll be affected and what to do should they find themselves holding a pink slip.\n\nWhile the current employment market in the US is strong — with low unemployment rates and high job growth — this could all change in the near future as many businesses struggle to adapt to the changing economy.\n\nTaking all of this into account, many US companies have already begun mass layoffs this year.\n\nWhat is a mass layoff?\n\nThe definition of a mass layoff is the termination of a large number of employees from an organization at the same time. Mass layoffs are usually due to economic downturns.\n\nA “mass layoff” can be defined when the following occurs:\n\nWhen at least 50 employees are laid off within 30-days or less resulting in the laid-off employees equaling more than one-third of the company’s workforce\n\n500 employees are laid off within 30-days or less, no matter how large the company’s workforce\n\nThis can be devastating for both the individuals affected personally and the economy as a whole.\n\nEverything you need to know about company layoffs this year:\n\nWill there be more mass layoffs in 2024?\n\nNotable companies with mass layoffs in 2024\n\nFull list of 2024 company layoffs\n\nNotable companies that had mass layoffs in 2023\n\nFull list of 2023 company layoffs\n\nFull list of 2022 company layoffs\n\nWhat is the Federal WARN Act?\n\nWhat to do if you’ve been laid off\n\nTop industries to apply to after you’ve been laid off\n\nWill there be more mass layoffs in 2024?\n\nAccording to a report by Randstad RiseSmart, it is projected that a significant 92% of employers are preparing for layoffs in 2024, as they navigate the economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust for potential overstaffing during this period.\n\nIn contrast, the emergence of new work trends, such as generative AI and sustainability practices, indicates a potential surge in job opportunities and shifts in certain job roles.\n\nAs the job market continues to evolve, it appears that there will be ample opportunities for those proficient in AI and flexible work structures, emphasizing the necessity for ongoing education and adaptability in a rapidly changing employment environment.\n\nWhat companies have had mass layoffs in 2024?\n\nGoPuff layoffs:\n\nGopuff, a fast-delivery startup, reduced its workforce by 6% on May 17, 2024, marking its fifth round of layoffs since 2022, as part of its strategy to achieve free cash flow positivity by the end of 2024.\n\nThe co-founders and co-CEOs are leading restructuring efforts to adapt to market conditions and meet investor expectations.\n\nThis move also signals potential challenges for other fast-delivery startups, impacting both their investors and workforce.\n\nPeloton layoffs:\n\nPeloton announced that CEO Barry McCarthy will step down, and the company will lay off 15% of its staff, or about 400 employees, to align spending with revenue.\n\nMcCarthy will serve as a strategic advisor while the company seeks a permanent CEO, with Karen Boone and Chris Bruzzo serving as interim co-CEOs.\n\nThis restructuring aims to reduce annual expenses by over $200 million by 2025, with significant cuts in payroll, marketing, and retail operations.\n\nDespite the layoffs, Peloton continues to struggle financially, missing Wall Street expectations in its fiscal third-quarter results.\n\nWalmart layoffs:\n\nWalmart announced plans to cut hundreds of jobs at its headquarters and relocate most of its U.S. and Canada-based remote workforce to three main offices, with many moving to Bentonville, Arkansas.\n\nThe changes aim to strengthen Walmart’s culture and develop employees’ careers, though affected workers can choose to relocate or leave with severance.\n\nThis shift reflects Walmart’s move towards more in-person work after initially endorsing remote work during the pandemic.\n\nBristol Myers Squibb layoffs:\n\nBristol Myers Squibb plans to lay off 6% of its workforce, approximately 2,200 employees, as part of a restructuring aimed at saving $1.5 billion by the end of next year amid expiring patents for major drugs like Eliquis and Opdivo.\n\nThe company is also scaling back its drug development pipeline and consolidating its facilities to streamline operations and focus on high-potential products.\n\nCEO Christopher Boerner emphasized that the cuts and portfolio adjustments are critical to bolster the company’s long-term growth, especially as it faces revenue impacts from new U.S. drug price negotiations.\n\nThese changes come as the company seeks to offset potential losses with recent acquisitions aimed at enriching its treatment pipeline, even as it undertakes significant debt to finance these deals.\n\nFoxtrot mass layoffs:\n\nFormer employees of Foxtrot Market and Dom’s Kitchen & Market have filed a lawsuit against Outfox Hospitality, alleging the company failed to provide the legally required 60 days’ notice before abruptly closing all locations and laying off staff.\n\nThe class action lawsuit, filed in Chicago, seeks 60 days of severance pay and benefits for affected workers under federal and state Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Acts.\n\nWorkers, including named plaintiff Jamil Ladell Moore, were shocked to discover their employment terminated mid-shift or upon arriving for work, with no prior warning.\n\nThe sudden closures of all 33 Foxtrot and Dom’s locations across Chicago, Texas, and Washington D.C. came just six months after a company merger, leaving many employees jobless and without severance.\n\nTesla mass layoffs\n\nTesla is laying off over 10% of its global workforce amid declining sales and a competitive price war in the electric vehicle sector.\n\nThe company aims to cut costs and boost productivity as first-quarter deliveries dropped for the first time in nearly four years.\n\nCEO Elon Musk and other executives have acknowledged the need for reorganization to prepare for future growth.\n\nThe layoffs coincide with the departure of key leaders and follow the cancellation of a planned budget car, reflecting broader market challenges.\n\nAmazon advertising & cloud computing mass layoffs\n\nAmazon’s cloud computing division, AWS, is reducing its workforce across the physical stores technology and sales and marketing departments amid a broader strategic realignment and slowing sales growth.\n\nThis follows Amazon’s decision to eliminate cashierless checkout technology in its U.S. Fresh stores, impacting teams responsible for innovations like Just Walk Out, Dash smart carts, and Amazon One palm-based payment technology.\n\nThe restructuring comes as part of Amazon’s largest-ever series of layoffs, which began at the end of 2022 and has affected over 27,000 positions across various segments, including Twitch, Audible, and Prime Video.\n\nPhantom Auto mass layoffs:\n\nPhantom Auto, a startup specializing in remote driving technology, is closing down after failing to secure additional funding.\n\nDespite raising $95 million, the company faced difficulties amid a challenging fundraising environment and a shift in the autonomous vehicle industry’s momentum.\n\nThe company’s shutdown underscores the broader challenges and consolidations within the autonomous vehicle sector, highlighting the fragile nature of startups reliant on external funding for operations and growth.\n\nU.S. Army mass layoffs:\n\nThe U.S. Army plans to eliminate around 24,000 positions, primarily vacant, to streamline its structure and improve capabilities, aiming to expand its active-duty numbers to 470,000 by 2029.\n\nThis move, part of a broader restructuring effort following a detailed force structure review, comes amid ongoing recruitment challenges, with significant shortfalls in new enlistees across the armed services in recent years.\n\nDespite these cuts, including a reduction in engineering and various combat roles, the plan includes adding 7,500 new positions to enhance the force’s capabilities.\n\nVice mass layoffs:\n\nVice Media Group’s CEO announced layoffs of “several hundred” employees and plans to halt publishing on Vice.com, focusing on social channels and content distribution partnerships.\n\nThe company aims for a studio model, shifting away from its digital distribution strategy.\n\nIn a controversial town hall, CEO, Bruce Dixon was criticized for ending the call early due to employee reactions to the layoffs.\n\nThis move follows Vice filing for bankruptcy and being acquired by a group of lenders for $350 million.\n\nIBM mass layoffs:\n\nIBM is encouraging employees to volunteer for layoffs as part of a global job reduction effort, particularly targeting positions in Europe.\n\nThe initiative aligns with IBM CFO James Kavanaugh’s announcement of achieving a $3 billion annual savings goal by the end of 2024, significantly impacting Enterprise Operations & Support and Finance & Operations sectors.\n\nApproximately half of the job cuts will affect European staff, with the company preferring voluntary redundancies to involuntary terminations.\n\nThis strategy is part of a broader workforce rebalancing aimed at enhancing productivity and aligning with in-demand skills like AI and hybrid cloud, maintaining the global workforce level through 2024.\n\nBuzzFeed mass layoffs:\n\nBuzzFeed has announced a 16% workforce reduction following the discounted sale of Complex Networks to Ntwrk, retaining only First We Feast.\n\nThis strategic decision, aimed at enhancing profitability and agility, comes amidst broader industry challenges, including BuzzFeed’s previous closure of its Pulitzer-winning news operation and a dramatic drop in its stock market valuation since going public.\n\nCEO Jonah Peretti emphasizes the restructuring as a pivotal move for focusing on core brands like HuffPost and Tasty, aiming for a leaner operational model amid the digital publishing sector’s current adversities.\n\nNike mass layoffs:\n\nNike announced a reduction of 2% of its workforce, amounting to over 1,500 jobs, as part of a strategic restructuring aimed at focusing investment in growth areas.\n\nThe layoffs, to be implemented in two phases, will not affect retail or warehouse employees but are part of a broader plan to streamline operations, enhance efficiency, and adapt to a retail environment increasingly reliant on promotions.\n\nCEO John Donahoe emphasized that this move is essential for reigniting growth and assured that affected employees would receive comprehensive support, positioning Nike to better serve athletes and the future of sport.\n\nSalesforce mass layoffs:\n\nSalesforce is laying off about 700 employees, approximately 1% of its global workforce, amidst a broader wave of tech industry layoffs, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nDespite these cuts, Salesforce still has 1,000 open positions, indicating a strategic adjustment rather than a large-scale downsizing.\n\nThis follows Salesforce’s previous workforce reduction last year, where it cut jobs by 10% and closed offices, subsequently reporting increased revenue and raising its annual profit forecast.\n\nMicrosoft mass layoffs:\n\nMicrosoft laid off 1,900 employees, 8% of its gaming division, following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nThe layoffs, part of a larger plan to reduce overlap, were announced by Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who emphasized support for affected employees.\n\nFormer Blizzard President Mike Ybarra and co-founder Allen Adham are also departing, with the company ceasing development of a new survival game.\n\nGoogle mass layoffs:\n\nGoogle has laid off hundreds of employees across various divisions, including core engineering, Google Assistant, and hardware teams responsible for products like the Pixel phone and Fitbit watches.\n\nThe layoffs, part of the company’s effort to reduce expenses and focus on artificial intelligence, follow a trend of tech job cuts seen in other major companies like Meta and Amazon.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai has been steering Google towards a sharper focus and cost reduction since July 2022, with the company having already conducted its largest layoff of 12,000 people in January 2023.\n\nThese recent layoffs are a continuation of Google’s organizational changes amidst a growing emphasis on generative AI.\n\nSports Illustrated mass layoffs:\n\nThe NewsGuild of New York and Sports Illustrated Union have filed an unfair labor practice charge against The Arena Group, alleging that the recent layoffs of around 100 people at Sports Illustrated unfairly targeted union-active employees.\n\nThe layoffs, which followed the revocation of the Sports Illustrated brand license by Authentic Brand Group, have been criticized by former CEO Ross Levinsohn, who resigned citing the board’s “abhorrent” and “feckless” actions.\n\nThis legal action comes amid accusations of union-busting tactics and negligence by The Arena Group, with some union employees immediately let go and others given 90 days’ notice.\n\nPixar (Disney+) mass layoffs:\n\nPixar, a Disney-owned animation studio, is set to undergo significant layoffs this year as part of Disney’s broader cost-cutting measures, which aim to increase efficiency and reduce streaming losses.\n\nThe layoffs, affecting employees hired for Disney+ content production, come despite Disney+ gaining 7 million new subscribers in Q4 and the success of Pixar titles like “Elemental” on the platform.\n\nThese changes reflect Disney’s strategy to streamline operations and focus on profitability in streaming, amidst industry-wide shifts in audience preferences and content delivery methods.\n\nUniversal Music Group mass layoffs:\n\nUniversal Music Group NV, the world’s largest record company with roughly 11,000 employees and known for artists like Taylor Swift and Drake, plans to cut hundreds of jobs in its recorded music division, which is its largest, as part of a broader industry trend of slowing sales despite previous growth from paid streaming services.\n\nCEO Lucian Grainge is focusing on cost-cutting measures, including “cut to grow” initiatives, to improve profit margins while continuing to invest in new growth areas like geographic expansion and direct-to-consumer sales.\n\nThese layoffs are part of a wider retrenchment in the media and technology industries, with companies like Amazon and Warner Music Group also announcing job cuts.\n\nAmazon Twitch mass layoffs:\n\nTwitch has confirmed laying off more than 500 employees, approximately a third of its workforce, marking the second major layoff in less than a year after 400 jobs were cut in March 2023.\n\nCEO Daniel Clancy stated that despite cost-cutting efforts, the organization remains larger than necessary for its current business size, with the company having optimistically sized itself for future growth.\n\nThis decision follows a trend of significant layoffs in the tech and gaming sectors, including cuts by Twitch’s parent company, Amazon, though Twitch streamers will not be directly affected by these changes.\n\nBlackRock mass layoffs:\n\nBlackRock Inc. is set to lay off about 600 employees, approximately 3% of its global workforce, to adapt to rapid changes in the asset management industry and reallocate resources.\n\nThe company is shifting focus towards ETFs, global expansion, and new technologies, aiming to transform into a comprehensive investment solution provider while also growing in alternative investments.\n\nDespite these cuts, BlackRock, which faced challenges like market declines and investor skittishness over higher interest rates, still plans to increase its overall staff count by the end of the year as it expands certain business areas.\n\nCompanies with layoffs in 2024:\n\nGoPuff layoffs: 6% of

toy sales, is cutting nearly 20% of its workforce, with CEO Chris Cocks announcing the layoff of 1,100 employees, adding to the 800 jobs already eliminated earlier this year.\n\nThese layoffs, a response to persistent market challenges and declining toy sales post-pandemic, will occur over the next six months, as the company also plans to sell its eOne film and TV business and reduce its office footprint.\n\nDespite these measures, Hasbro’s shares fell more than 4% in after-hours trading, contrasting with competitor Mattel’s optimistic outlook bolstered by the success of the “Barbie” movie.\n\nState Street mass layoffs:\n\nBoston-based financial services company State Street is laying off approximately 1,500 employees, a move announced by Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer Eric Aboaf and expected to cost between $175 million and $200 million in severance.\n\nThe company, which manages trillions in assets and had 42,000 employees as of September 30, is streamlining its organization for long-term success, despite not specifying if the layoffs will affect its Massachusetts workers.\n\nThis downsizing aligns with a broader trend in the banking sector, as reported by Reuters, with firms like Morgan Stanley and Bank of America also reducing their workforce due to economic challenges and interest rate hikes.\n\nZulily mass layoffs:\n\nZulily, a Seattle-based online retailer, has conducted its second round of layoffs within a year, as it and its parent company Qurate face declining revenues.\n\nThe company, which previously laid off staff in May and closed a Pennsylvania fulfillment center, is experiencing a significant drop in revenue, with a 28% decrease in the fourth quarter and a 38% annual decline.\n\nThese layoffs come amidst a broader trend of slowing e-commerce growth post-pandemic and are part of Qurate’s broader strategy to cut costs, including a 12% reduction in its workforce.\n\nStellantis (Jeep parent company) mass layoffs:\n\nStellantis plans to cut thousands of jobs at its Jeep plants in Detroit and Toledo, citing California’s stringent emissions regulations as a competitive disadvantage.\n\nThe company will reduce shifts at both plants, affecting over 3,600 workers, due to declining Jeep sales and a shift to a traditional two-shift operation.\n\nStellantis has been resisting carbon emission reduction efforts, arguing it could lead to substantial fines.\n\nAmidst industry-wide cost-cutting and restructuring, Stellantis, slow in transitioning to EVs, blames the transition and regulatory challenges for the layoffs.\n\nSpotify mass layoffs:\n\nSpotify, the Swedish music streaming giant, is cutting 17% of its workforce, amounting to about 1,500 jobs, as part of a cost-reduction strategy.\n\nCEO Daniel Ek emphasized the need for the company to become more resourceful and lean, following over-hiring during 2020 and 2021.\n\nThis layoff is the third in 2023, in a tech industry that has seen

You can usually file for unemployment online, simply by providing information like your Social Security number, driver’s license or state ID number, and contact information for your previous employer.\n\nTip 2: Health insurance options\n\nExploring your health insurance options after being laid off is also important. If you were previously covered by your employer, you may be eligible for COBRA, which allows you to keep your health insurance for a certain period of time after leaving your job.\n\nTip 3: Retirement savings\n\nIf you had access to a 401k contribution plan at your former employer, you have the option to cash out your 401k, though this option is usually not advised as certain penalties can be incurred.\n\nThere is also the option to roll the account over into an IRA but take the time you need to decide which option is best for you with a licensed finance professional.\n\nTop industries to apply to after you’ve been laid off\n\nOnce you’ve taken care of those 3 housekeeping items to stay afloat while you search for your next job, take some time to update your resume, start networking, and consider the following industries in high demand for talented professionals.\n\nTech Industry\n\nThe tech industry is always in need of talented professionals and there is no sign of that changing anytime soon.
