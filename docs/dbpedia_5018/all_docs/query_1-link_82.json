        "text": "Fully Operational 10,240-Processor Columbia System Rated at 51.87 Teraflops, Returning World-Class Supercomputing to U.S. Scientists\n\nScreaming past Japan’s\n\nvenerable Earth Simulator and 498 of the world’s 500 most powerful systems,\n\nNASA’s 10,240-processor Columbia supercomputer, built from 20 SGI® Altix®\n\nsystems, seized the second position in the latest roster of the world’s Top\n\n500 supercomputers. Announced today at the Supercomputing Conference 2004, the\n\n24th Top 500 list confirms that NASA’s Columbia supercomputer has added yet\n\nanother performance milestone for the acclaimed SGI Altix platform from\n\nSilicon Graphics. Columbia is the world’s fastest system to be\n\nbased on industry standard Intel® Itanium® 2 processors and the Linux®\n\noperating system. Currently, there are more than 800 SGI Altix systems\n\ndelivered and in production worldwide.\n\nAttaining sustained performance of 51.87 trillion calculations per second\n\n(teraflops) and peak performance of 60.96 teraflops across 10,240 processors,\n\nColumbia vanquished venerable supercomputers such as Japan’s famed Earth\n\nSimulator, which at 35.86 teraflops has been rated as the world’s top\n\nsupercomputer for more than two years. The Columbia supercomputer, which since\n\nOct. 12 has been in full production use at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing\n\n(NAS) facility at NASA Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.,\n\ngenerated LINPACK benchmark results that were second only to IBM’s Blue\n\nGene/L, a temporary installation of a system intended for eventual deployment\n\nat Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.\n\n“The Columbia system is a tremendous development for NASA and the nation.\n\nSimulation of the evolution of the Earth and planetary ecosystems with high\n\nfidelity has been beyond the reach of Earth scientists for decades,” said\n\nGhassem Asrar, Deputy Associate Administrator of NASA’s Science Mission\n\nDirectorate. “With Columbia, scientists are already seeing dramatic\n\nimprovements in the fidelity of simulations in such areas as global ocean\n\ncirculation, prediction of large scale structures in the universe, and the\n\nphysics of supernova detonations.”\n\n“We are extremely proud to have not only achieved exceptional performance\n\nwith Columbia at 50 teraflops, but to have also created a production system,\n\ndelivering real results in less than 120 days,” said Bob Bishop, Chairman and\n\nCEO of SGI. “SGI has established new standards by which customers will expect\n\nfuture supercomputers to be built and delivered.”\n\nRepresenting SGI installations — in production — located throughout the\n\nworld, the Top 500 list features new Altix supercomputer deployments at\n\ncommercial sites and research institutions such as:\n\n— Ford Motor Company\n\n— French energy giant Total\n\n— National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration\n\n— University of Rochester\n\n— University of Manchester\n\nSeveral current Top 500 entrants featured previously on the Top 500 list\n\nadded more Altix systems to their deployments as well. These expanded\n\ninstallations, in addition to NASA’s Columbia system, underscore the\n\nproductivity and ease of use that the SGI Altix system’s global shared-memory\n\narchitecture affords the world’s most demanding users.\n\nReal Science Conducted on Altix\n\nOutfitting some of the world’s most demanding user environments with an\n\nunique global shared-memory architecture, scalable Intel Itanium 2 processors\n\nand a proven 64-bit Linux operating environment, Altix enables scientists and\n\nengineers to hold massive data sets and complex problems entirely in memory.\n\nLeveraging this powerful platform, Altix users have achieved breakthroughs in\n\na broad range of technical computing disciplines. The top markets for Altix\n\napplications include:\n\n— Computational structural mechanics\n\n— Computational fluid dynamics\n\n— Computational chemical and material sciences\n\n— Bioinformatics\n\n— Seismic processing and interpretation\n\n— Reservoir Simulation\n\n— Climate, weather and ocean simulation\n\nIn addition to transforming scientific discovery at NASA and other HPC\n\ncustomer sites, Columbia signals a new era for easily deployable\n\nsupercomputers. Columbia was built, installed, and made fully available to\n\nscientists in fewer than 120 days, a radical departure from traditional\n\nsupercomputers that historically have required years to implement. Columbia is\n\nbuilt from the same industry standard, commercially available Altix systems —\n\nbased on Intel Itanium 2 processors and featuring a 64-bit Linux OS — that\n\nhave been in widespread use throughout the world since SGI introduced Altix in\n\nJanuary 2003. Leading automakers, consumer product manufacturers, energy\n\ncompanies, pharmaceutical companies, national laboratories, government\n\nagencies and research institutions have adopted the SGI Altix platform.\n\nAbout The Top 500 List\n\nThe 24th Top 500 List was announced today at the Supercomputing Conference\n\n2004. The Top 500 project was started in 1993 to provide a reliable basis for\n\ntracking and detecting trends in high-performance computing. Twice a year, a\n\nlist of the sites operating the 500 most powerful computer systems is\n\nassembled and released. The best performance on the Linpack benchmark is used\n\nas performance measure for ranking the computer systems.\n\nSILICON GRAPHICS | The Source of Innovation and Discovery(TM)\n\nSGI, also known as Silicon Graphics, Inc., is a leader in\n\nhigh-performance computing, visualization and storage. SGI’s vision is to\n\nprovide technology that enables the most significant scientific and creative\n\nbreakthroughs of the 21st century. Whether it’s sharing images to aid in brain\n\nsurgery, finding oil more efficiently, studying global climate, providing\n\ntechnologies for homeland security and defense or enabling the transition from\n\nanalog to digital broadcasting, SGI is dedicated to addressing the next class\n\nof challenges for scientific, engineering and creative users.
