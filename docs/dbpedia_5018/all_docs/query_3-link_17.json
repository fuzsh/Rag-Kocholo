        "text": "This debate is nearly as meaningless as the PCs vs. Macs debates!\n\nLets look at a real world example, shall we?\n\nTurner Production/Effects:\n\n2 Onyx RE2 systems\n\n2 Onyx IR systems\n\n3 Indigo2 systems (2 high impact)\n\n2 Indy R4k's (as far as I know)\n\n1 Indy R5k (Indy studio)\n\nThe Onyx's do things that *NO* PC is doing right now...I don't\n\nthink we have any debate over that. They're running Virtual Set\n\nsoftware, real time character animation of complicated scenes\n\n(believe me, no Alphas/PC's are doing what we're doing with the\n\nOnyx's). For modelling and animation the animators use the\n\nImpacts but then render on Onyx's using Alias and SoftImage.\n\nThe Indy's are there for system administration and development\n\nand to pick up little peices when the other machines are busy.\n\nThe R5k Indy even has Alias animator (and I defy any Mac to run\n\nPhotoshop as fast as this machine does). The two RE's also\n\nrun flame and the non-impact Indigo2 runs flint.\n\nDo we have PC's? Some of the people here have PC's for the\n\nbusiness end of the Production department, but none are running\n\nany graphics software, AFAIK.\n\nDo we have Mac's? Most of the Macs in our editing suites are\n\nused for email, sometimes we use them for tranfering files.\n\nVery often clients give us images/textures/whatever on Mac\n\ndisks. They're there if we need them, but it's very rare.\n\nMost images done internally are done on Paint Boxes.\n\nI'm *not* saying PC/Alpha/Macs aren't good, but there is *no*\n\ndebate when comparing high end to high end. There is little\n\ndebate comparing something like an R10k Maximum Impact with\n\neven the best PC ever made...the artists just don't get realtime\n\nfeedback/screen updates as fast on any other non-SGI. This\n\nis what SGI's do. If you are raytracing or running a radiosity\n\nsolution then any machine with fast processing power is going\n\nto do a good job, but *nobody* beats SGI's for realtime\n\napplications and feedback. YES, PC's are getting faster, and\n\nthe feedback may be good enough that it's not worth getting\n\nan SGI for a lot of people, and people without the funds just\n\nhave to live with it, but for the real complicated stuff it's\n\npointless when the animator tries to rotate an object in a\n\nhighly complex scene and have to wait forever for the screen\n\nto update.\n\nSo what about low end? We have low end SGI's mostly to make\n\nthings compatible across the board. I develop on one of the\n\nIndy's...I develop applications that run on the Onyxs, I can't\n\ndo that with a PC. I also do some modelling and need to do\n\nR&D with our real time character animation software which will\n\nONLY run on SGI's - yes it sucks on the Indy, but I develop\n\npieces on the Indy and we put it all together on the Onyx.\n\nThis is a typical real world example of who is using/needs\n\nSGI's. For the high end stuff nobody beats them, but for\n\nnon-realtime applications you can probably save tons of money\n\nand use P/A/M (Pentium/Alpha/Mac) based applications.\n\nThis is just such a stupid argument, the point I'm making is\n\nthat there is a need for low end SGI's as much as there is\n\na need for high end SGI's, but if you don't NEED an SGI\n\nthen a P/A/M render farm is a less expensive and worthy\n\nalternative...it depends who you are and how much money you\n\nhave.\n\nAlso PLEASE lets not get into a debate about realtime graphics...\n\nthere certainly exist P/A/M systems doing realtime graphics,\n\nbut not like a high end SGI system can do...not even close.\n\n--\n\n-=-=- Frederick Haab -=- Software Developer -=- Turner Production -=-=-\n\n-=-=- fred...@turner.com -=- 404.885.0317 -=- fax: 404.885.0757 -=-=-\n\nIn article <4vihse$h...@fido.asd.sgi.com>, ak...@tuolumne.asd.sgi.com (Allen\n\nAkin) wrote:\n\n>It's a thought-provoking analogy.

Lexus is really doing\n\na number on them.\n\nalso, when Guy mentioned his autos many were brands (or models) and not\n\nentire companies.\n\nmaybe each brand/model of a company has a small marketshare but when you\n\nadd them up\n\nit's much larger. also, just because they're in business, doesn't\n\nnecessarily mean that\n\nthey're profitable.\n\nin most markets only the top 2 brands make money. generally speaking you\n\nneed a 15-20% marketshare to sustain profitability over the long run. that\n\nwould be 5-6 companies if all had similar marketshare. if any one company\n\nhas a 70% or larger marketshare they have a monopoly. if the two or three\n\ntop company's combine marketshare is 70% or greater they have an\n\noligopoly.\n\nbtw - that info. is from a famous Boston Consulting Group study.\n\nif you look at various markets, you will notice that many times the race\n\nboils down to just two companies. especially in mature markets. just\n\nthink - Coke vs. Pepsi, Nike vs. Reebok,\n\nApple vs. IBM, Hertz vs. Avis, etc.\n\nas for the computer hw industry, it's maturing and consolidating.\n\nanyway, that's what i think.\n\n\"Alex P.

However, for now,\n\nno, PCs do not yet represent a majority.\n\n>> Lets face it, PCs are fast closing the gap between themselves\n\n>> and SGIs, and a year from now, that gap will be even smaller.\n\n>Nah.\n\nIf you really think that, you're way out of touch.\n\nThen again, the new SGIs come out in October, and if SGI doesn't\n\npull a Commodore, they might keep the gap from narrowing a lot.\n\nThe gap HAS been narrowing, of course, and anyone who denies that\n\nis not up to date on the way of things.

And it's CPU is pretty competitive.\n\nWhat's cost got to do with your argument? As far as I can see you were\n\nstating PC's were closing the gap on SGI's. I state they clearly aren't,\n\nsince the SGI standard desktop machine keeps getting faster, and suddenly\n\nyour onto who gives per bangs per buck. This always has been the PC, and\n\nalways will be the PC, since it has the benefit of mass market (actually\n\nmy PSX probably gives more polys per sec per dollar, but thats a different\n\nargument :) ). However, in terms of the gap in real time poly performance,\n\nits still as wide as ever.\n\nAs for the CPU, the gap was never massive. In my case, a couple of years\n\nago it was a R4400 150Mhz against a 90MHz Pentium, now its a 250MHz R4400\n\nagainst a 200MHz Pentium, and next time it'll be a R10K against a Pentium\n\nPro. SGI always has an edge, but never a particularly massive one.\n\n>\n\n>Now, how long do you figure till GLint cards that can compete with the\n\n>Impact graphics come out? No too damn long...and even if they cost\n\n>$5k-10k to start, that's still reasonable compared to the cost of the Impact\n\n>graphics upgrade for something like a 2Extreme.\n\nI've been hearing PCs will compete with SGI's for a few years now and it\n\nstill hasn't happened. Getting Impact performance levels is a lot more\n\nwork than simply bolting GLint chips onto a card. Of course in a few years\n\nPC's may be as fast a max impact, but then I'll have an infinite reality\n\non my desk :).\n\np.s. I develop on unaccelerated PC's, accelerated PC's and SGI's, so I'd\n\nhope to be fairly unbiased on this issue.\n\n>Noam Ben-Ami Rare Medium, Inc. Multimedia...Well Done\n\n\n\nKeith J.

Software is not a\n\nstandardized commodity, nor are peripherals. If Apple's market share drops, software\n\ndevelopment for Macs will cease to be profitable. Ditto for boards, drives, etc. When\n\nusers see that they pay a premium for Mac software - and development doesn't keep pace\n\nwith other platforms - they LEAVE. People don't switch cars because of the spark plugs\n\nor gas that is available for the car. They do in computers.\n\nI see the Unix stations on the desks of the techies where I work - then go back to my\n\nPentium PC in the marketing group. I am, by training, an engineer. I understand the\n\ntechnical advantages. But the OS battle is being decided by marketing moves. Microsoft\n\ndeep-sixed OS/2 not on technical merits, but by squeezing Windows onto as many computers\n\nas they could, and providing relatively cheap development tools. At one point, IBM was\n\ncharging US$2,000 for the OS/2 developer's kit while Microsoft was giving the Windows\n\nkit away for free.\n\nIt's a pity none of the keepers of various Unix flavors has been able to get it together\n\nto do the same. And in the same light, what I've read here about the SGI product line -\n\nnon-standard buses, etc. - gives me great pause. I think the era of buying a\n\npurpose-built computer (sort of how many graphic artists view their Mac) is past. Large\n\nnumbers of users are more sophisticated. They want to be able to expand and build on\n\ntheir investment. SGI doesn't need to compete with NTs to realize that the market for\n\nexpensive, single-task systems is smaller than the market for the same power in a more\n\nopen arrangement.\n\nMy guess is that many people will endure the less elegant, less powerful solutions of\n\nthe PC world because they can leverage their investment with constantly improving\n\nsoftware and periphals. Both initial purchase and subsequent add-ons are at lower price\n\npoints than UNIX, Mac, and other options. There is no reason why UNIX could not do the\n\nsame thing at a higher tier of performance - perhaps at a slightly higher price than PCs\n\ndespite economies of scale, but more commodity-like than currently.\n\nYou know, I'd love to see this debate end and so don't like\n\nto butt in, but then you see something you just have to argue\n\nabout....\n\nAlan Boucek wrote:\n\n>\n\n> In article <502abh$8...@vixen.cso.uiuc.edu>, nbe...@uiuc.edu (Noam\n\n> Ben-Ami) wrote:\n\n>\n\n>> \"Alex P.

The R5000 came\n\nout earlier this year and is specifically being used in Indys,\n\nthe R10000 in Indigo^2's. Doesn't sound like a machine nearing\n\nthe end of it's life cycle just because Indigos didn't last\n\nas long as they should have.\n\nAnd I really need to argue about the Indy's usefulness. It has\n\n*never* been a crappy little machine. Certainly when one is\n\nsitting next to an Indigo^2 Extreme or better, but set it next\n\nto a PC and it hardly seems crappy. And it also seems to me that\n\nIndys have had XZ graphics available for *years*, if not from\n\nthe very beginning. Right now all but the very high end accelerators\n\nfor PC's don't even touch XZ graphics.\n\nAnd one of the major points of having an Indy is for development,\n\nand specifically for low end applications that you don't need\n\na $100,000 machine for (I've never seen even a PowerMac run\n\nPhotoShop as quickly as my R5000 Indy). Development of applications,\n\nfor example, can easily be done on an Indy and then run beautifully\n\non an Onyx. Try to program for a low end PC graphics card and then\n\nget it to run on a high end card, and take advantage of the better\n\nfeatures...there's just no comparison.\n\n> The Indy will be replaced. The machine that replaces it will be\n\n> impressive. It will still cost more than a PC.\n\nAnd Onyx's will be replaced, and Indigo^2's will be replaced,\n\nand PC's will be replaced as well...pretty soon it'll be the\n\nPentium Power Pro, and the Quadruple Pentium \"Can't touch this\n\nwith a stick\" Superduper Power Pro. So I'm not sure I understand\n\nthis point.\n\n>>> And who says SGI is responding to pressure from the PC market - is\n\n>>> that your impression, your guess, your hope, or a quote from an\n\n>>> SGI executive and/or based on a published SGI stategic plan?\n\n>>\n\n>> Its common sense.\n\n>\n\n> Is it?

And as Alan\n\nwrote, the gap may narrow when you compare 3 to 4 year old low\n\nend SGI technology and new PC technology, but when you compare even\n\nthe latest low end technology from SGI (if you can even call Impact\n\n\"low end\") to the latest high end technology on PC's then I think\n\nit'll be a pretty steady, if not widening, gap.\n\nI use a PC at home, I'd *love* to write apps on it, it's not that\n\nI don't *want* a lot of competition to bring prices down, and get\n\nsome nice 3D graphics on PC's. But I've always hated developing on\n\nPC's, esepecially graphics. A few years ago the issue was whose video\n\ncard are you going to support, after several years and standards\n\nemerging and layers to handle the hardware (something SGI has always\n\ndone), you can finally sit down and write a program that uses high\n\nresolution graphics and will run on just about any PC. Now introduce\n\na set of 3D graphics accelerators...here comes those feelings again.\n\nOK, so I hear the argument that these accelerators will be OpenGL\n\ncompatible, but at what level? Do the people porting OpenGL\n\nhave to be hardware aware of every card? Do I need company\n\nX's OpenGL port to run on their card, and do I need to recompile\n\nwith another library to run on another card and take advantage of\n\nthat hardware? Or do we get stuck in a quagmire of O.S. level\n\ninterpretation where each company will have to supply drivers for\n\ntheir hardware, like Windows does with standard graphics cards?\n\nAnd then there's the issue of what O.S. to even run on!\n\nMaybe that's why I'm at work writing this on an Indy. We have\n\nsome Macs and PC's around for email and word processing and stuff,\n\nsome of the graphics guys do some painting on the Macs.

Or get enough of a buzz\n\ngoing so that sufficient people buy into your innovation to make it a de\n\nfacto standard - while subsequently cooking up the next round of\n\ninnovation, which becomes a must-have standard because people have\n\nbought into it....like Microsoft/Intel. These are just two of the many\n\nmarket strategies possible in today's computer world.\n\nYou're expounding a niche strategy. I agree with you that SGI is, and\n\nwill remain, an upper echelon product line. But there are other\n\napproaches. And I pointed out that, for example, UNIX never coalesced\n\ninto a standard with the market force of Windows - due solely to\n\nmarketing decisions. We can only guess what profits have been forfeited\n\nby the developers and managers of UNIX.\n\n>\n\n> If you look at the PC graphics board companies, they're doing the\n\n> same thing SGI is.

But it is perfectly a propos this thread\n\nto point out that this means SGI machines, for all their power, will not\n\ndraw much 3rd party development beyond its niche markets, and SGI users\n\nmust (and do) look elsewhere for the broader usefulness that comes from\n\nsuch development.\n\nFor example, I know many people who are running technical and\n\nnon-technical businesses and consultancies. Those with software\n\nbackgrounds drool at the thought of having a UNIX station running\n\ntheir SOHO operations. But it won't happen - because all the peripherals\n\nand collateral software aren't there. You can't run a business with a\n\nCPU or an OS. The same holds for SGI.\n\nAgain, this may be their strategy. In the larger context, it means that\n\nthe technology innovators aren't leading the broader computing\n\ncommunity: the big decisions are being left to snazzy marketers with\n\npatchy solutions while innovators like Apple, and now SGI, stay in niche\n\nmarkets. With all the annual drops in computing costs, isn't it a pity\n\nthe best technology never becomes mainstream?\n\nJoshua\n\n> It's a pity none of the keepers of various Unix flavors has been able to get it together\n\n> to do the same.

In\n\nfact, it's the development of the high end that pushes the \"old\" high\n\nend stuff into the low end.\n\nTake the much-touted movie industry. A few years ago, \"Jurassic Park\"\n\nset all kinds of standards for reality-based computer animation.\n\nAlready, that level is commonplace.. and \"state of the art\" is several\n\ntimes as advanced as JP. Remember the hoopla over \"Star Wars\"? It\n\nlooks downright primitive now.. and was state of the art in 1977.\n\nBack in school, we had a lab with Indys, and a lab of Pentum-133 NT\n\nmachines. Both labs had much of the same software. We were doing some\n\nprocessing as a part of our coursework that was simply not feasable\n\non the NT machines, due to the runtimes involved were measured in hours\n\non the NT machines. (And just try to get the ME students to use the\n\nPentiums for CAD work.)\n\n--\n\n+---------------------------------------------------+\n\n| Technical Support Engineer, Cyclades Corporation |\n\n| 800/88-CYCLADES (882-9252) or (510)770-9727, x258 |\n\n| Maker of High Performance Multiport Serial Cards |\n\n+---------------------------------------------------+\n\nIn article <50qco9$k...@vixen.cso.uiuc.edu>, nbe...@uiuc.edu (Noam\n\nBen-Ami) wrote:\n\n> tmd...@ups.edu (Soren) writes:\n\n> >As an apple user, my opinion is of course biased, but I'll state it\n\n> >anyway: For those who don't yet know it, The Mac is still THE graphics\n\n> For ONE reason: inertia.

Microsoft is finally\n\n: catching up...to a decade old Mac.\n\nNot if you were using a Mac. Macs didn't have color until around 1988. Or sound.\n\nNow if you are talking about using an Amiga, which had a multitasking OS,\n\ngraphic *and* command line interface, thousands of colors, sound and\n\nNTSC and Pal syncable video, well they *did* have that 10 years ago. Oh yeah,\n\nthey also had plug and play.\n\nIMHO, Macs and PCs have spent the last 5 years or so imitating Amigas, and only\n\nin the last couple have they, through increased power in the hardware,\n\nsucceeded to any extent. The Amiga failed because Commodore was an incredibly\n\nstupid company who wouldn't know a clue if it fell on them.\n\nCome to think of it, Ataris and even the lowly Apple IIgs had color before the\n\nMac. And when the Mac did first get color, it was the same 256 colors that\n\nthe PC of the same era had. And it had the same 8 bit sound as the Amiga\n\nand Atari. The Amiga could display 4096 colors at the time, though with flaws.\n\nIn any case, only the original Mac was innovative, its successors came in\n\nabout a year behind current tech until about 1991. And the Mac OS itself\n\nwas copied off of X-windows developed at Xerox Park a decade earlier. As\n\nApple's suit against Microsoft revealed.\n\nNonetheless, I'd rather use an NT machine than a Mac. Also, I don't know if your\n\nstudent bothered to ask which model of Macs designers were using in the Phoenix\n\narea, but I'd bet the majority are still using Quadras.\n\nMicrosoft is busily trying to immitate SGIs now. And if you've seen\n\ndigital editing systems like Razor Pro using a modest PVR card on NT, or any\n\nof the Matrox digital studio cards, you wouldn't be bragging about the Macs\n\ndigital video. Only the rather expensive Avid and Imix boxes are really pro\n\nin their video output.\n\nIf you are into 3D, an area Macs have always been weak at, PC/NT machines\n\nare a much better bet with a wider variety of good software than Macs. Let's\n\nsee, Softimage, Lightwave, 3DS Max, Truespace (Animation Master/MH3D is available\n\non both PCs and Macs). Tons of 3D hardware cards from around $299 up.\n\nI think graphic designers using Macs are a bit like those die hards who were\n\nstill touting Amigas a year ago. For 2D work, Macs are still fine machines, but\n\nnearly every piece of software available for them is also available at least on\n\nPCs and probably NT machines as well. And NT machines running the fastest\n\nDEC Alpha chips kick the crap out of anything below SGI for sure, and even\n\nsome of the SGI models.\n\nAnd at least 5 devoted Mac fans that I know switched to NT this year to use\n\nSoftimage on it.\n\nMicro$oft may not be innovative, and they may even be evil incarnate, but\n\nmachines running NT can definately get some serious work done at an affordable\n\nprice.\n\n: JMonahan\n\n--\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSteph Greenberg, 3DCGIMD CGI Character Orthopedic Surgeon,\n\nst...@primenet.com Chiropractor, and Podiatrist.\n\nCopyright 1996.
