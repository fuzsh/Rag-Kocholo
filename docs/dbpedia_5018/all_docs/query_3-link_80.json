        "text": "Margins matter. The more Silicon Graphics International (NAS: SGI) keeps of each buck it earns in revenue, the more money it has to invest in growth, fund new strategic plans, or (gasp!) distribute to shareholders. Healthy margins often separate pretenders from the best stocks in the market. That's why we check up on margins at least once a quarter in this series. I'm looking for the absolute numbers, comparisons to sector peers and competitors, and any trend that may tell me how strong Silicon Graphics International's competitive position could be.\n\nHere's the current margin snapshot for Silicon Graphics International and some of its sector and industry peers and direct competitors.\n\nSource: S&P Capital IQ. TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nUnfortunately, that table doesn't tell us much about where Silicon Graphics International has been, or where it's going. A company with rising gross and operating margins often fuels its growth by increasing demand for its products. If it sells more units while keeping costs in check, its profitability increases. Conversely, a company with gross margins that inch downward over time is often losing out to competition, and possibly engaging in a race to the bottom on prices. If it can't make up for this problem by cutting costs -- and most companies can't -- then both the business and its shares face a decidedly bleak outlook.\n\nOf course, over the short term, the kind of economic shocks we recently experienced can drastically affect a company's profitability. That's why I like to look at five fiscal years' worth of margins, along with the results for the trailing 12 months, the last fiscal year, and last fiscal quarter. You can't always reach a hard conclusion about your company's health, but you can better understand what to expect, and what to watch.\n\nHere's the margin picture for Silicon Graphics International over the past few years.\n\nSource: S&P Capital IQ. Dollar amounts in millions. FY = fiscal year. TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBecause of seasonality in some businesses, the numbers for the last period on the right -- the TTM figures -- aren't always comparable to the FY results preceding them. To compare quarterly margins to their prior-year levels, consult this chart.\n\nSource: S&P Capital IQ. Dollar amounts in millions. FQ = fiscal quarter.\n\nHere's how the stats break down:\n\nOver the past five years, gross margin peaked at 27% and averaged 16.4%. Operating margin peaked at -2% and averaged -15.5%. Net margin peaked at -3.4% and averaged -16.2%.\n\nTTM gross margin is 27%, 1,060 basis points better than the five-year average. TTM operating margin is -2%, 1,350 basis points better than the five-year average. TTM net margin is -3.4%, 1,280 basis points better than the five-year average.\n\nWith recent TTM operating margins exceeding historical averages, but still negative, Silicon Graphics International looks like it still has a lot of work to do.\n\nIf you take the time to read past the headlines and crack a filing now and then, you're probably ahead of 95% of the market's individual investors.
