        "text": "PCs and Macs have not always been the graphics workstations used today. Who was?\n\nSilicon Graphics, Inc. (later rebranded SGI, historically known as Silicon Graphics Computer Systems or SGCS) was an American high-performance computing manufacturer, producing both hardware and software. They were regarded as the pinnacle of computer graphics in the early 1990s. Founded in Mountain View, California in November 1981 by Jim Clark, its initial market was 3D graphics computer workstations, but its products, strategies and market positions developed significantly over time.\n\nSGI computers created special effects on the movie Jurassic Park (1993), at the time the graphics were state of the art.\n\nThe SGI cube was sgi’s hallmark and trademark.\n\nThe logo was created by graphics designer Scott Kim. His work done at the time is available via the Wayback Machine.\n\nThe logo was made into a lovely sculpture shown below.\n\nFinances Precipitate Logo Change\n\nWith growing financial issues in 1999, SGI changed their logo from the iconic cube to the stylized “sgi”.\n\nBut with erosion of the graphics market share to other systems, coupled with poor decision making, losses continued.\n\nThe porting of Maya to other platforms is a major event in this process. SGI made several attempts to address this, including a disastrous move from their existing MIPS platforms to the Intel Itanium, as well as introducing their own Linux-based Intel IA-32 based workstations and servers that failed in the market. In the mid-2000s the company repositioned itself as a supercomputer vendor, a move that also failed.\n\nOn April 1, 2009, SGI filed for Chapter 11 again, and announced that it would sell substantially all of its assets to Rackable Systems. Rackable announced their adoption of “Silicon Graphics International” as their global name and brand.\n\nAfter the Rackable acquisition, Vizworld magazine published a series of six articles that chronicle the downfall of SGI.\n\nReferences\n\nxahlee.com – SGI Logo Visual Illusion\n\nScott Kim – Wikipedia and website\n\nWikipedia – Silicon Graphics\n\nWere, or I should say, are you a SGI fan?
