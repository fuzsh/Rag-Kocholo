        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (August 1, 2003) — SGI (NYSE: SGI) and Aechelon Technology, Inc. today announced plans to optimize Aechelon Technology’s C-NOVA™ software-based runtime engine for the recently announced Silicon Graphics® Onyx4™ family of visualization systems with UltimateVision™ graphics, including support for vertex and pixel shaders.\n\nC-NOVA visual simulation software transforms commercially available computer graphics systems into rock-solid 60Hz frame rate, high-resolution, multi-channel image generators. The real-time load balancing of C-NOVA ensures sustained update rates of 60Hz or higher at very high display resolutions, and combined with Onyx4 provides the power and flexibility necessary to create extremely high-resolution environments. Even the smallest Onyx4 configuration can deliver 20M pixels of highly interactive graphics, enough to power two ultrahigh-resolution 10M pixel LCD displays. At the high end, Onyx4 can render over 100M pixels of display, enough to power the next generation of fully immersive environments.\n\n“We are very excited by the potential of combining the power of shader technology with the real time capabilities of the Onyx platform in the next release of C-NOVA,” said John Quinn, president and CEO,\n\nAechelon Technology. “Onyx4 and C-NOVA have the potential of redefining the high end image generator space, reaffirming SGI’s leading position.”\n\n“Aechelon Technology has delivered some of the world’s most advanced visual simulations on the Onyx platform, and we’re very excited about their plans to take their technology to the next level on the new Silicon Graphics Onyx4” said Lang Craighill, senior director for SGI’s Defense and Intelligence markets. “C-NOVA’s advanced features and capabilities along with Aechelon Technology’s innovative use of pixel and vertex shaders will be a perfect match with the Onyx4 architecture and scalable UltimateVision graphics. This combination will offer new levels of realism and training value at ground breaking price-points.”\n\nAechelon Technology’s C-NOVA runtime engine, and its C-RADIANT™ plug-in module for geospecific, multi-sensor image generation support, have been field proven in the Harrier AV-8B\n\nRadar Night Attack Weapon System Trainer, at AFRL in the DMT Testbed and Night Vision Training Systems Labs and at NAVAIR Manned Flight Simulator. These products, together with the associated geospecific databases, have established a new standard for realistic image generation in training,\n\nforeign-area familiarization and mission rehearsal applications.\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements regarding SGI technologies and third-party technologies that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in such statements. The reader is cautioned not to rely unduly on these forward-looking statements, which are not a guarantee of future or current performance. Such risks and uncertainties include long-term program commitments, the performance of third parties, the sustained performance of current and future products, financing risks, the ability to integrate and support a complex technology solution involving multiple providers and users, and other risks detailed from time to time in the company’s most recent SEC reports, including its reports on From 10-K and Form 10-Q.\n\nAbout SGI\n\nSGI, also known as Silicon Graphics, Inc., is the world’s leader in high-performance computing, visualization and storage.
