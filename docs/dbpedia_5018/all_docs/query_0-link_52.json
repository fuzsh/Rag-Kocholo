        "text": "The Silicon Graphics computer company of the United States announced on Monday it was closing its European headquarters near Neuchâtel in western Switzerland, with the loss of 300 jobs.\n\nThe company, also known as sgi, said the move was being made in response to economic pressures caused by the global IT downturn and was part of a restructuring plan designed to restore the company’s financial health.\n\nSilicon Graphics said it expected to close its manufacturing facility at Cortaillod in canton Neuchâtel by the end of the year. The plant was inaugurated 12 years ago.\n\nThe company, which has a broad range of computing, advanced graphics and consulting services, is transferring production for Europe to its US facility in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.\n\nThe Cortaillod site manager, Michel Bernard, said the company was working closely with its employees to provide “as much advice and guidance” as possible.\n\n“An appropriate social plan is being developed that will be communicated to them over the next few days along with a timetable for the closure,” Bernard said.\n\nSilicon Graphics said it planned to maintain its distributor status with a local office that would continue to distribute the company’s products throughout Switzerland and Europe.\n\nThe parent company last week announced a net loss for the fourth quarter of $232 million (SFr400 million).\n\nswissinfo with agencies"
