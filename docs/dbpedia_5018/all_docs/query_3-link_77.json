In Australia, however, it has a far lower profile -- and that is the first thing Mickan wants to change.\n\nSilicon Graphics is the industry leader in the fast-growing niche market of\"visual computing\". Its expertise in three-dimensional graphics and high-performance hardware is best illustrated by the special effects shown in the Arnold Schwarzenegger films Predator and Terminator II. The success of these and similar films, and the increasing use of multi-media applications in commercial work, is fast making visual computing a strong selling point for computer makers.\n\nLoading..."
