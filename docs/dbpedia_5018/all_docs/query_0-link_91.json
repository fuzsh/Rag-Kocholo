        "text": "Silicon Graphics Inc., a one-time computer powerhouse that delivered the special effects in many Hollywood hits, declared bankruptcy on Wednesday and was purchased for 25 million dollars in cash.\n\nRackable Systems Inc, a Fremont, California-based manufacturer of servers and data storage products, announced that it had agreed to acquire most of the assets of Silicon Graphics and to assume some of its liabilities.\n\nSilicon Graphics provided special effects for movies such as \"Jurassic Park\" and \"Toy Story\" in its heyday but the company has fallen on hard times recently declaring bankruptcy for the first time several years ago.\n\nThe Sunnyvale, California-based company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection again in New York on Wednesday. Chapter 11 provides a company with protection from creditors while it restructures.\n\nRackable chief executive Mark Barrenechea announced the purchase of Silicon Graphics, saying \"the combined company will be positioned to solve the most demanding business and technology challenges our customers confront today.\n\n\"This combination gives us the potential for significant operational synergies, a strong balance sheet, and positions the combined company for long-term growth and profitability,\" he said in a statement.\n\nSilicon Graphics chief executive Robert Ewald said the purchase by Rackable was a \"big step\" in strengthening the company.\n\n\"This transaction represents a compelling opportunity for Silicon Graphics' customers, partners and employees, who can all benefit from the emerging stronger company with better technologies, products and markets reach,\" he said.\n\nThe deal remains subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court."
