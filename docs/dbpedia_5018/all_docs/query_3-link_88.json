        "text": "Posted on\n\nThe Intel business model is based on supplying microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, graphics chips, integrated circuits, and other related computing units to computer system manufacturers such as HP and Dell. Since it was founded in 1968, Intel Corporation has been integral in driving technological breakthroughs worldwide. Its history reflects a long record of producing different resources that shape the future of technology worldwide. Asides from its excellent products, Intel also makes the most revenue from selling semiconductor chips, ranking them among the Fortune 500 companies in the United States. Additionally, the company keeps maintaining its innovative edge. For instance, they revamped the designs of their microprocessors so that they could gain more ground over their competitors and defend their large market share. As such, it is unsurprising that the company is a global leader in the tech industry.\n\nContents\n\nToggle\n\nA brief history of Intel\n\nIntel, coined from the words Integrated Electronics, was founded by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce on the 18th of July 1968, in Mountain View, California. The founders, who were former employees at Fairchild Semiconductor, were pioneers of semiconductor chips, an integral unit in the making of computer systems. Even though Moore and Noyce founded the company, Andrew Grove is widely acclaimed for having been instrumental to the company’s growth through his executive leadership skills. Additionally, the company is instrumental in Silicon Valley becoming a tech center.\n\nIntel started the business by producing DRAM and SRAM memory chips in 1981, after making the first commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971. Two years after its launch, it went public and raised $6.8 million. However, it began to make waves in the market when it focused on making the necessary computing units for personal computers. The company became more aggressive in improving its products due to the stiff competition in the market, especially from other tech companies such as Microsoft and AMD. As such, it redesigned its microprocessors, which not only increased its market share but fostered the evolution of the computer industry. Other innovations followed suit.\n\nIn 1972, Intel opened its first international manufacturing plant in Malaysia and later in Jerusalem and Singapore in the 80s and in India, Costa Rica, and China in the early ‘90s. In 1987, Moore stepped down as CEO, and Andrew Grove took over. Upon his arrival, the company launched a marketing campaign in 1991 that made it a household name among its customers by the turn of the century.\n\nBy the end of the 1990s, Intel tried to diversify into other products besides microprocessors, but some of its efforts were unsuccessful. Today, the company has a stake in other markets, including self-driving cars and smartphones.\n\nWho Owns Intel\n\nGordon Moore and Robert Noyce founded Intel. Currently, it is majorly owned by institutional investors, to a tune of 60.78%. These institutional investors include The Vanguard Group, Inc., Geode Capital Management LLC, Norges Bank Investment Management, BlackRock Investment Management, Capital Research & Management Company, etc. Intel insiders own 5.16%, retail investors own 34.06%, and Gordon Earle Moore owns 4.18%, making him the largest individual owner of the company. The company’s current CEO is Patrick P. Gelsinger.\n\nIntel Mission Statement\n\nThe company’s mission is “to create world-changing technology that improves the life of every person on the planet.”\n\nHow Intel works\n\nIntel majorly produces microprocessor chips, motherboard units, central processing units, etc., for manufacturers of computer systems. These products are often sold under its brand name. Also, the company makes a PC chipset that allows the IT unit of its client companies to monitor and troubleshoot their computer systems remotely.\n\nOther products include the Xeon processors, Optane, one API, and Intel Foundry Service. The Xeon processors allow manufacturers to scale their products. Intel also makes XeGPU for the graphics card market under Ponte Vecchio. Optane is an Intel technology used as a cache for SSDs. It has the same speed as DRAm and is only available to enterprises since it’s a server-only technology. oneAPI unifies Intel’s microprocessors, making developers worry less about low-programming tasks.\n\nHow Intel makes money\n\nIntel makes most of its money through selling its products.
