        "text": "Shares of Silicon Graphics lost a third of their value today after the company said it expected to report a loss for its first fiscal quarter.\n\nThe loss, which the company attributed to unexpectedly weak sales in the quarter ending on Sept. 30, came after a surprisingly strong fourth quarter, in which Silicon Graphics said it had successfully put product-transition issues behind it.\n\nBut the recent quarter was only the first time in two years that Silicon Graphics had met, let alone exceeded, Wall Street analysts' estimates, and for many investors today's announcement appeared to shatter whatever credibility the company retained. As of late last month, Silicon Graphics executives were still telling analysts that they would meet Wall Street expectations.\n\n''They don't have a chief financial officer; they demonstrably do not have good internal controls or a coherent forecasting and planning process,'' said Doug van Dorsten of Hambrecht & Quist. ''They are $120 million under my revenue forecast, and I was at the low end.''\n\nThe disappointing sales were particularly hard to understand during an economic boom, when the company has a fresh product line and when its major rival, Sun Microsystems, has continued to report robust results. Some analysts say Silicon Graphics seems to be following the example of Apple Computer, staking out the high ground in technology even as prosaic but more aggressively managed competitors grab ever-greater shares of the market.\n\nSilicon Graphics shares closed today at $18.0625, down $8.8125, on volume of 16.7 million shares on the the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts said its business model, which required both high profit margins and high growth, might no longer be sustainable. Although the company still offers the highest-performance work stations and servers, especially for niches like the graphics market, it is not addressing broader areas of high-growth potential, which are increasingly served by Sun and Hewlett-Packard.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
