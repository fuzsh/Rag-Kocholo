        "text": "NEW YORK (CNNfn) - Executives of Silicon Graphics thought they had it right the first time, and for a while they did: The company was the clear leader in the market for high-end graphics computers in the late 80s and early 90s.\n\nBut during the past several years, Silicon Graphics, also known as SGI, has fallen from its perch and its stock has fallen to new lows, bottoming out this month at 50 cents a share.\n\nWhat happened? Some say the company got distracted, acquiring its way into too many new markets. Others blame advances in the graphics capabilities of lower-priced systems, which have steadily pecked away at sales of SGIï¿½ high-end workstations.\n\n\"It's a fairly standard pattern,\" said Christopher Willard, technical computing analyst at research firm International Data Corp. \"No matter how good your technology is, after a while the rest of the market catches up with you.\"\n\nSGI sells servers and workstations that combine high-performance computing capabilities with advanced graphics. Its customers range from Fortune 500 companies and government agencies, to Hollywood Studios, graphic artists and research scientists.\n\nSGI is responsible for about 11 percent of the total market for such systems, compared with historical market share of between 20 percent and 25 percent, according to Willard.\n\nThere has been a lot of restructuring, as well as reshuffling among the company's executive ranks in recent years. The latest round of restructuring has taken place under Bob Bishop, SGI's chief executive since July 1999. Since he took the helm of the Mountain View, Calif.-based firm, Bishop has been taking steps to shed non-core businesses.\n\n\"My intention was to reduce the revenue of the company and increase the [profit] margins,\" Bishop said.\n\nDuring Bishop's tenure, SGI has sold several parts of the business including: its unprofitable Cray supercomputer business, which it bought in 1996; its MIPS Technologies semiconductor business, which makes graphics chips used in consumer products such as Sony's Playstation game consoles; as well as two application-software businesses.\n\nBishop said the restructuring efforts were beginning to take hold just as the technology sector began to sour. \"We had been heading down the runway and ready for takeoff when we were hit last quarter with what is wind-shear at the end of the runway,\" he said.\n\nLate last month, SGI reported a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of $231.8 million, or $1.20 per share, far wider than the 40 cents loss Wall Street expected.\n\nSteaming toward a safe harbor\n\nIn response, Bishop said the company has set upon yet another round of restructuring, including laying off roughly 15 percent of SGI's workforce. The idea is to get to break-even by the fourth calendar quarter, he said.\n\nBut Wall Street clearly has grown impatient. The list of equity analysts who track SGI (SGI: down $0.01 to $0.60, Research, Estimates) has dwindled to four. Of those, three rate the stock \"neutral\" or \"hold,\" while another has a rare \"sell\" recommendation.\n\nBishop is hoping that some results will change those opinions. \"We've got to prove that we can reach break even,\" he said, \"which is a safe harbor for us.\"\n\nAn increasingly competitive market\n\nSGI will be facing new challenges and a more competitive environment as it seeks to fight its way back to the top of the technical computing market, which by IDC's count is expected to grow to $11.2 billion in 2005 from $6.1 billion last year.\n\nThese are extremely technically savvy users, and a number of companies are providing some very good products in this area. Christopher Willard\n\nInternational Data Corp.\n\n\"People are still buying high-performance systems, and the market is more willing to take a chance if there is a clear technology advantage,\" IDC's Willard said. \"But on the other hand, these are extremely technically savvy users, and a number of companies are providing some very good products in this area.\"\n\nFor example, companies like Intel (INTC: down $2.03 to $28.13, Research, Estimates) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD: down $0.53 to $14.47, Research, Estimates) , whose presence is felt mostly in the lower-end PC computing market, have been forging ahead with new, speedier, more powerful processors, as well as system architectures that open up data bottlenecks and provide substantially more bandwidth. These are features that historically have set SGI apart from the pack.\n\nBishop acknowledged the growing competitive threat from smaller computer makers. But he said the company's enormous portfolio of design patents -- more than 400, with another 500 in process -- and its current lead over any of its competitors will enable it to keep them at bay.\n\n\"Intel, for example, has only recently begun to ship a 64-bit chip,\" Bishop said, referring to the company's highly touted and oft-delayed \"Itanium\" processors.\n\n\"We've been shipping 64-bit chips for over 10 years, and the operating systems that go with that are mature and bug free, and are in real-time,\" Bishop added. \"They haven't achieved any of this yet, and already, the first product on the market is three years late. So it's going to take so long for them to learn. But we know they're headed this way.\""
