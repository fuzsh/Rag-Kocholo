Silicon Graphics Inc., whose computers are used to explore for oil, has increased the speed of its supercomputer to stay competitive with rivals like I.B.M. The new machine operates one-third more quickly than its predecessor and has four times as many processors in a single rack. The supercomputer sells for $2.9 million, which is less than half the price of a similar model that is sold by I.B.M., said Jan Silverman, the senior vice president for global marketing at Silicon Graphics. Silicon Graphics is improving the supercomputer as it seeks to capture additional businesses from the United States military, which uses the company's machines for missile-defense programs. The new computer went on sale in the last few weeks. Silicon Graphics will formally introduce it at a trade show to be held in Baltimore later this month, Mr. Silverman said.
