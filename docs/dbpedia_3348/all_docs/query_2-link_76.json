        "text": "Featured November 2023 Small Business Owner\n\nAlex Beitzel graduated from Susquenita High School in 2008 and has been invested in growing his business as well as career since then! Alex Beitzel founded A2B Sound in 2009 and began providing audio services for all applications. In 2020, the business was rebranded to A2B Media and was expanded to offer solutions for audio, video, lighting, broadcast and control systems. With this move, the company became a full service “one stop shop” for all things in the A/V world. In the time this business has been around, A2B has had the opportunity to serve a variety of clientele in a variety of capacities. At the current time, the majority of clientele is the house of worship/church community as A2B Media has an extensive knowledge of some of the niche items involved with the house of worship setting. Also at the moment, A2B Media provides full audio, video and lighting production for live events as well as permanent installations in venues and churches. The business has grown steadily over the years and in the past two years has started to see even higher growth with reach and job size capacity. A2B Media is active on most social media platforms showcasing all of the projects they are involved with. You can contact Alex or A2B Media on the website www.a2bpro.media or by emailing [email protected]\n\nAlex Beitzel is married, but no kids at the moment except for a pair of cats. While attending Susquenita High School, he was very active in the musical department as well as the A/V club which have both parlayed into his full time career, as both of these items are common practice from day to day. Alex also serves at Christian Life Assembly in their technical director role, where he oversees all things involving audio, video and lighting while also being the primary audio technician for all services and productions. When not working either for the company or the church, he can typically be found on his MacBook, recording an episode of his racing podcast, at a NASCAR race or at the golf course.\n\nAugust 2023\n\nA 1983 honors graduate of SHS, Shelly Matter enjoys giving back to her alma mater and all other Perry County schools through volunteering.

This friend had previously owned an ice cream shop and was looking for a fun job to do during his retirement. Tec and Amy decided this would be a good partnership and purchased Good Life Ice Cream & Treats in Lancaster in August of 2020. Although they planned to take more of a back seat role in running the business until their children got older, their business partner became ill and they lost him to cancer in January of 2021.

He competed in soccer throughout grade school up to the High School varsity soccer team. He was an active member in the Ski Club and the Student Council. Many people remember Justin for his musical abilities as the lead singer and guitarist in his band performing regularly at many high school talent shows, school dances, and outside events.\n\nIn high school Justin took his first photography class, a passion he inherited from his grandfather, a professional photographer. He entered and won many photography competitions sparking a desire to pursue photography on a professional level. This led Justin to attend Harrisburg Area Community College, one of the top schools in the nation for photography, earning his associates degree. Simultaneously, he established Justin Time Photography and began photographing weddings, senior portraits, headshots, and music videos.\n\nAfter HACC he decided to take a year off to reflect on his spiritual life enrolling in an intense discipleship program called Master’s Commission in South Carolina. While attending Master’s Commission, Justin realized his true passion was actually filmmaking and decided to continue furthering his education in Cinematography at Southeastern University.\n\nWhile attending SEU in Florida, Justin participated in Sunscreen Film Festival where he filmed interviews for many A-list actors. His senior year he was accepted into the film program at The Los Angeles Film Studies Center where he interned with a major camera house, immersed himself in the Hollywood film industry, and began honing his craft as a cinematographer.\n\nAfter graduating with his Bachelor of Fine Arts in Film in 2010, Justin returned home to Marysville expanding his photography business to include videography. With the evolving popularity for artistic wedding films, Justin rebranded as a luxury wedding film company establishing Cinematic Love Stories.\n\nDuring this time another passion grew for wine making.

At its completion Barlup Wine was birthed and continues to grow into a developing business.\n\nIn 2020 Justin met the love of his life, Whitney.

He was a country boy who spent his childhood fishing, 4-wheeling, dirt biking and building things. In 4th grade he was given the “Future Inventor” award because he could always build something from whatever he could find in his desk. Many of his father’s tools were lost as they were “donated” to whatever new project was being designed and built by the imagination of a now teenage boy. One of his favorite tools to build with was his fathers welder, as the possibilities were as endless as whatever he could envision.\n\n​Jeffrey began working with Kebco Enterprises in 2006, prior to his graduation from Susquenita High School and Cumberland Valley Vocational School, (where he was enrolled in Auto Body) of the same year. It was through Kebco Enterprises and then KBM Industries that Jeffrey’s skill and thirst for creativeness continued to grow as he moved up in the company and began to dream of having his own business someday.\n\nIn 2019, the opportunity arose to turn that dream into a reality when Jeffrey’s boss of 12 years decided to close down his business and was gracious enough to allow Jeffrey to purchase a lot of what he would need to begin his own business, along with a customer base that was already familiar with Jeffrey’s skills. This is when “Susquehanna Steel Fabricators” was born and opened for business in Duncannon. His business, designs and builds commercially, a variety of jobs for many different businesses. Approximately 50% of his business is building handrails for hospitals, restaurants, parks, etc., with Hershey Medical Center being at the top of the list with fabricating hand rails, the emergency entrance screen walls, the emergency entrance wheelchair storage and so much more. The other 50% is the “fun” stuff. The out of the ordinary things, such as working at Lake Tobias, where he built the infirmary cages for new, injured, premature or sick animals, redesigned and replaced their arched overhead entrance sign and is now currently building the new Lion exhibit. Other favorites were the reworking of failed mounts for 2-66 ton WWII Penny’s guns that were built in 1916 for the Navy ship USS Pennsylvania, which are on display at the PA Military Museum in Boalsburg, making customized fire pits & signs and building a traveling bar-b-Que smoker.\n\nIn December of 2020, Jeffrey became engaged to Amanda Sanbower of Duncannon with plans to marry on April 30th, 2023 and on March 17th of 2022, another dream became reality when they welcomed their first child, Annalee Rose Evinger into their family. Jeffrey’s future plans are to continue to grow his business and his family with his future wife, as well as continuing his other adventure of owning rental properties…… but that’s another story.\n\nMay 2022\n\nEmily Fortenbaugh (Matia) graduated from Susquenita High School in 2014.

She quickly realized that she had made the wrong career choice, but worked as an RN at Holy Spirit Hospital for a year and a half. She quit after paying off her student loans and decided it was time for a fresh start.\n\nEmily chose to pursue what she was passionate about. By this point she had already photographed a few weddings and various other portrait sessions, but in April of 2018 she officially started Emily Laura Photography and invested in the equipment necessary to create quality photos. She has spent the past few years photographing weddings, couples, seniors, families, and events. Emily especially enjoys capturing candid and unposed moments. She likes to keep her business local, and has had the honor of photographing the weddings of multiple Susquenita alumni.\n\nSince leaving nursing, Emily has also worked as an elementary teacher’s aide and as a private caregiver. She began teaching piano lessons in 2018 and continues to teach today out of her home in Newport. In addition to photography and piano lessons, she can be found working at her family’s homemade ice cream and bake shop, Sweet to the Soul in Newport, which opened in February of 2021.\n\nEmily has taken a step back from photography this year as she and her husband, Colten, prepare to welcome their first child over the summer.

She was in Leo Club, Senior Editor for the school paper and a cheerleader her senior year. After graduation she worked at ACT ONE Consultants as an office manager.\n\nThis company was owned by her father Charles Cook (also a Susquenita graduate).

He graduated from in 2011 after transferring to another school. Michael’s four older sisters are all Susquenita graduates, along with his wife Angie (class of 2013). Michael likes to say that the Susquenita staff missed out on getting to know the best Lindgren child.\n\nAfter graduating from High School, Michael attended The Pennsylvania State University studying Electrical Engineering. It was during his freshman year that he attended a Yuengling Brewery Tour in Pottsville, PA and immediately succumbed to what he calls “shiny tank syndrome,” making it his goal to open a brewery one day. Shortly after, Michael received his first homebrew kit and brewed his first beer, a Belgian Strong, eventually moving on to more advanced all grain brewing. During his Junior year at Penn State, Michael questioned his aspirations of becoming an Engineer and dropped out. He still likes to joke that he is ¾ an Engineer, which his wife doesn’t find funny because she is a “full” engineer. After dropping out, he landed a Brewer internship at Appalachian Brewing Company, which lead to a full-time brewer position. At 21, Michael became the Brewpubs Head Brewer overseeing the satellite brewery operations and integrating them with the flagship brewery in Harrisburg.\n\nUltimately, Michael did return to Penn State to complete his degree in Agribusiness and is currently working to complete the World Brewing Academy’s Advanced Brewing Theory Program from The Siebel Institute of Technology. With his hands on experience in the brewing industry, ¾ engineering background and business degree Michael set out to make his dream a reality. Partnering with his father they started Lindgren Craft Brewery on a 2 bbl (1 bbl = 31 gallons) brew system in a converted milk house on his family’s farm. Brewing began in 2018 and official distribution began in 2019.\n\nWith impeccable timing, the Lindgren’s purchased the Historic Duncannon National Bank in downtown Duncannon to move their brewing operations, expand into larger production, and open a tasting room and brewpub. Unfortunately, their timing wasn’t so impeccable and 2020 put a hard paused on their progress in what they now deem “The Bank”.\n\nThe work did not stop though, and Lindgren Craft Brewery spent the year improving their packaging, brewing techniques, and distribution. Today you can find their brews in 16 oz. cans and on tap from Chambersburg to Harrisburg and north towards Selinsgrove and Millheim. Locally in Perry County you can find them at Newport Beverage, Sorrento’s Bar and Lounge in Duncannon, and Old Trail Tavern in Liverpool. Occasionally, you can snag a small supply directly from Lindgren at LindgrenBrewery.com and pick it up through the ATM drive thru at The Bank! If you’d like a complete listing of distributors or tap locations you can reach out to Lindgren on Instagram or Facebook, or Michael directly at [email protected], he will happily provide you with a location nearest to you; though he does warn sometimes he is un-millennial and slightly slow to respond.\n\nJune 2021\n\nTracy (Lindgren) Phillips was a 1998 Susquenita Graduate. After graduating from high school she attended Penn State University and majored in Poultry Science. She wanted to work with farmers and ultimately own her own farm.\n\nShe spent 6 years working in the poultry industry and interacting with farmers on a daily basis. In 2009 when she had her first child she decided to quit her job and stay home to raise her kids. However, the love of farming was still there and so her husband bought her two dairy goats. She collected goats and soon realized that she had a lot of milk! Needing to find something to do with all this milk, so she could keep collecting goats, she went to the computer and it told her to make goat milk soap. So she did. The soap was great for her family with small kids and a husband who also had sensitive skin. She gave away a lot of soap then started selling it online and eventually wholesale.\n\nWhen her family outgrew their one acre they decided they needed more land and Barking Goat Farm was born. Located at 221 Linton Hill Road in Duncannon, Barking Goat Farm combines her passion for goats and her husband's passion for hunting dogs. Customers started asking if they could pick up their goat milk skin care products on the farm so they could see the goats too! Tracy loved the idea and wanted everyone to meet the goats. Then an idea was formed. Why not open a farm store right on the farm and allow people to get a farm experience and shop at the same time!\n\nNow you can visit the farm every Friday, Saturday and Sunday from 10 am - 2pm. You can pet the goats, feed the goats, and even try to milk a goat. Then you can shop at our farm store and bring home some goat milk skin care products that the goats helped to make! Come visit us on the farm this summer to meet the goats that help make the skin care products! Located at 221 Linton Hill Road Duncannon PA. Open every Friday, Saturday and Sunday 10am-2 pm. You can see all our products online at www.barkinggoatfarm.Etsy.com\n\n​Don’t forget to follow our farm story on Facebook at BarkingGoatFarmSoap.\n\nMay 2021\n\nJuliet (Parrish) Lightner is a Susquenita graduate of 2006. During her junior year in high school she began working at a car stereo shop in Marysville after school, and her interest in working in the automotive industry began to take shape. She elected to complete an internship during her senior year and subsequently found a job working at an auto body shop in Millersburg. She started detailing cars and during the course of her senior year learned the basics of auto body repair, taking on different types of repairs under a seasoned technician’s guidance.\n\nUpon graduation, she enrolled in Wyoming Technical Institute and graduated in 2007 with a certificate in Collision Repair and Refinishing and a specialty in Chassis Fabrication and High Performance Engines. After she obtained the basics needed to step into the industry, she landed a great apprenticeship in Irvine, California at a weld fabrication shop. Building roll cages and high performance parts was great, but she missed Central PA. So after a few months she came back to Duncannon to find her niche.\n\nAt this point she knew she really liked collision repair, so she took an opportunity with Nationwide Insurance as a material damage appraiser to learn the insurance side of the business. Then, in 2011, 1 year after welcoming a son into the world, she decided to go back to the body shop side of the industry as that is where she felt most at home. She became an estimator with Select Collision Group at their Autobodies by Lucas in Mechanicsburg, and in 2015 moved on to become the manager of their Major’s Select Collision location also in Mechanicsburg where she still is today.\n\nHer role within Select Collision Group is vast, including her title as the manager of Major’s Select Collision as well as coordinating training for all four of their locations, assisting with technical direction for all of the stores, staffing for the group, and acting as the current owner’s right-hand woman with any business needs that arise. Speaking of the owner, one of the things that Juliet appreciates most about her position within Select Collision Group is the unique opportunity to work for and learn the business from another woman in the collision repair industry.\n\nJuliet’s path throughout the industry hasn’t always been easy, but she says she takes any resistance to her presence as a woman in a male-dominated field in stride. She knows that her work speaks for her, and she finds that her position allows her a unique opportunity to keep paving the way for other women to join the industry as well.\n\nWhen she isn’t working she enjoys spending time with her family, all of whom still reside in the Central PA area. She and her son love hiking, fishing, and hunting together, and spend their free time with their dogs and chickens. They also get to travel regularly to visit her boyfriend who works all over the country.\n\nIf you’d like to see more about her company, Select Collision Group, please visit their facebook page at facebook.com/SelectCollisionGroup or their website at https://www.centralpaautobody.com/"
