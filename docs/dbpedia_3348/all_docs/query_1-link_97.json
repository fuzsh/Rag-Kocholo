I understand Adams had a chat with Smith some time ago about the football issues involved in possibly bidding for Aston Villa Football club but at no stage has a role been promised for him if the bid is successful. There is no danger of Tim Sherwood being threatened.\n\n\"Smith is the one putting money together from city investors. I understand he is going for a bid for £150m.\"\n\nRochdale sign striker McDermott\n\nFootball\n\nLeague One side Rochdale have made striker Donal McDermott their first signing ahead of next season, on a one-year deal following a trial.\n\nThe 25-year-old started his career at Manchester City and has had spells at Bournemouth, Huddersfield, Scunthorpe and Irish side Dundalk.\n\nHe was most recently been playing non-league football with Salford City and Ramsbottom United.\n\n\"There's a special, special talent there,\" said Dale boss Keith Hill. \"He wants to put into practice the losses of the last two or three years where he's not really made the most of his ability.\"\n\nWe go again - Mawson\n\nFootball\n\nWycombe defender Alfie Mawson says all the pressure is on Plymouth Argyle going into Saturday's League Two play-off semi-final first leg at Home Park.\n\nWanderers missed out on automatic promotion on the final day to Bury, finishing fourth as Argyle got seventh.\n\n\"The pressure isn't on us, it's on our opponents.
