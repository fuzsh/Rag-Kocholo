        "text": "GLOSSOP North End Community Club has set itself a challenge for 2021 – to raise an initial £95,000.\n\nThe money will fund a much-needed revamp of the facilities at the Cemetery Road site in the shape of a Glossop community sports hub that would provide significant benefits for the area.\n\nGNECC has been in existence for more than 30 years and with its 500+ members and 38 teams it lives by its ethos of #bethebestyoucanbe. It now desperately needs facilities to match this.\n\nChairman Dave Rowlinson said: \"Aside from providing a brilliant home for the football club and its members, the site would host a diverse mix of projects and activities delivered by the club and our partners.\n\n\"We want everyone to have the opportunity to use and enjoy the site — this is a project that will help our community get active with all the wellbeing benefits that goes with that.”\n\nThe project has been tendered at a cost of £1.75 million which makes it one of the largest investments into sport in Glossopdale. It's a once in a generation opportunity for people living and working in the town and the surrounding area.\n\nSo far, considering commitments made and the amount already raised by members, GNECC has achieved 90 per cent of the necessary figure. The club's now looking to close the gap by securing the final 10 per cent. The initial target has been set at £95,000 with an eventual amount of £185,000.\n\nThe plan is for the hub to cater not only for football, but to serve the district with community space, changing facilities, a 3G pitch, and upgraded entrance with renovated grass pitches to follow.\n\nEach of the teams has been tasked with helping to raise funds but GNECC is also looking for support from the wider community and businesses through crowdfunding pledges and sponsorship.\n\nGNECC wants to encourage as many people to get involved as possible. They already offer access to sport to wide and diverse membership: players aged five to 21, girls and boys, Ability Counts football, Wildcats and Just Play for women and veterans. The new facility would enable the club to support even more people.\n\nFootball development officer Ben Mills said: “We've seen significant growth in the club over the last five years with the number of teams increasing from 20 to nearly 40. We now have more than 100 girls playing football and the benefits of a more diverse offering, Ability Counts and open-age football are untold for our community.\n\n\"The plan is to add even more teams and recreational playing groups while working with other sports like rugby, running and cycling, fitness clubs and colleges. Currently this is limited by our poor facilities. We need a home we can call our own.\"\n\nDave Rowlinson added: \"This year has been incredibly tough for all of us. Not having the usual activities and community get-togethers has been a big blow.\n\n\"It's hoped that with lots of support we'll reach our fundraising target and bring a brilliant community hub to Cemetery Road. The teams are all doing various projects and we have a site for all donations so that the public can see our progress.\n\n\"The hub would leave a legacy for our community for many years to come and one which we could all be proud of.\"\n\nIf you would like to make a pledge or offer a reward contact fundraising@glossopnorthendjuniors.co.uk\n\nIf you're a business and would like to discuss corporate sponsorship for the new facility email footballdevelopment@glossopnorthendjuniors.co.uk"
