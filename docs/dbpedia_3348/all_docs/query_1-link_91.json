        "text": "1932-39\n\nWilliam Stapley (trainer)\n\nKent man Bill Stapley was a centre-half who started out at Dulwich Hamlet before signing for West Ham. He never made the first team and in 1908 moved north to join his brother Harry at Glossop North End who were then a Football League club. Bill was capped six times for England at amateur level. He died in 1964.\n\n1945-47\n\nMatt Swinnerton\n\nAltrincham player and a Cheshire League referee. Also managed Altrincham and Winsford United. Quit Hyde citing differences with the directors over team selection.\n\n1947-49\n\nGordon Clark (player-coach)\n\nYorkshire-born full-back who made 64 appearances for Manchester City from 1936 to 46, Clark was also the nephew of Willie Applegarth who won gold in the 4x100 yards relay at the 1912 Stockholm Olympics. He joined Hyde from Waterford and was later manager at Distillery (Northern Ireland), Aldershot, West Bromwich Albion and Peterborough. There is even a tale that he was offered the Juventus job in the mid-1960s. Finished up as Arsenal chief scout and died in 1997.\n\n1949-51\n\nHarold Brunton\n\nSomething of a mystery man who merited almost no mention in the local press. At the 1950 annual meeting, club chairman Joseph Rhodes said his admiration of Brunton was so great that he would have paid him a salary equivalent to all the other wages paid by the club.\n\n1953-54\n\nTommy Wright\n\nGlossop man who had been on the books at Manchester City and Hull City and played for Accrington Stanley in the Football League third division north. Also player-manager at Sligo Rovers and Lancaster City.\n\n1957-58\n\nJack Smith\n\nEngland Schoolboy international from Yorkshire who played for Huddersfield, Newcastle United, Manchester United, Port Vale, Blackburn, Macclesfield Town and Congleton in a career stretching from 1932 to 1952. When he joined Manchester United in 1938 it was for a club record fee of £6,500. Managed Macclesfield for four seasons from 1951. Resigned Hyde job due to ill-health. Died in 1975.\n\n1958-59\n\nWally Boyes\n\nWon three England caps in the 1930s and scored for West Bromwich in their 4-2 victory over Sheffield Wednesday in the 1935 FA Cup final. Transferred to Everton for £6,000 in 1938. Player-coach at Notts County in 1949 and player-trainer at Scunthorpe in 1950-53. Player-manager at Retford in 1954. Joined Swansea as trainer in 1959 but illness forced him to retire the following year. Died in 1960.\n\n1959-60\n\nGeorge Smith\n\nFormer Manchester City and Chesterfield forward who joined Hyde from Mossley as player-manager but made no appearances. Also managed Prestwich Heys. Left Ewen Fields quoting business reasons. Died in 2013. (Not the same person as the George Smith who managed Hyde in 1975).\n\n1960-61\n\nPeter Robinson\n\nPlayed in midfield for Manchester City, Notts County, Chesterfield, Buxton, Kings Lynn and Macclesfield, where he was manager in 1958-59. Later served in backroom roles at Manchester City and Preston North End. Died in 2000.\n\n1961-63\n\nFrank Clempson\n\nMade 15 appearances for Manchester United between 1948 and 53. Also played for Stockport County and Chester. Died in 1970 aged only 40.\n\n1963-64\n\nLes Battrick\n\nDirector who joined the Hyde United board around 1958. When the club was unable to pay anyone to replace Frank Clempson he accepted the role of manager on a voluntary basis.\n\n1964-68\n\nBill Pheasey\n\nClub secretary who had run the reserves very successfully in the late 1950s. Was in charge of Hyde when they joined the newly-formed Northern Premier League in 1968 but was sacked in October when they were bottom of the table with only one win from ten matches and out of the FA Cup and NPL Cup. Received a lifetime ban from the FA after a mystery letter from a fictitious address accused Hyde of making illegal payments. The ban was lifted after a year.\n\n1968-72\n\nEric Webster\n\nOne of the stalwarts of Hyde's double Cheshire League title-winning side of the mid-1950s. Returned to Ewen Fields to manage the reserves and then took over the first team. Led the Tigers to two very respectable NPL finishes but the club was wiped out financially by the increases in travelling and wages, and had to return to the Cheshire League. Sacked in February, 1972. Webster managed Stockport County in the fourth division from 1982-85 as well as Stalybridge Celtic, Runcorn and Ashton United. Played for Ashton, Macclesfield, Nantlle Vale, Pwllheli and Stalybridge plus one game for Manchester City. Died in 2016.\n\n1972-74\n\nLes Sutton\n\nArguably Hyde United's most successful manager, winning eight trophies over his two periods in charge. Started at Manchester United in the 1950s, alongside the Busby Babes, but after being released made a name for himself as an uncompromising centre-half at Stalybridge Celtic. Replaced Eric Webster as manager of Hyde's reserves before taking over the first team. Quit in 1974 to manage Stalybridge but returned three years later. In 1981-2, under his leadership, Hyde swept the board in the Cheshire League and returned to the NPL where they enjoyed an impressive first season. Controversially sacked in 1983, Sutton later managed Witton Albion, Curzon Ashton and Mossley. Was briefly back at Ewen Fields in the late Eighties as a member of Pete O'Brien's staff.\n\n1974-75\n\nJack Dobson\n\nVeteran defender who made more than 450 appearances in 1958-60 and 1963-74. By his own admission he was probably too nice to be a manager but took over at a difficult time and was badly hampered by a lack of funds caused by the club's recurring financial problems.\n\n1975\n\nGeorge Smith\n\nBirmingham City goalkeeper who also played for Ashton United, Stalybridge Celtic, Mossley, Buxton and Altrincham. Managed Stalybridge and Icelandic club Keflavik before moving to Ewen Fields in January, 1975, where he ruffled some feathers by insisting the players called him boss rather than George. Quit Hyde in the summer to take charge at Al Hilal and stayed in Saudi Arabia for many years. Did some scouting on his return to England. Died around 2018.\n\n1975-77\n\nJohn Bain\n\nTough Scots-born full-back who started at Bury where he made 11 first-team appearances. Played for Altrincham and Mossley before transferring to Hyde in January, 1973. Originally caretaker boss and then fully appointed in September, 1975. Was asked to resign in October, 1977. He refused to do so and was sacked.\n\n1977-83\n\nLes Sutton (See above)\n\n1983-86\n\nPeter Wragg\n\nOne of non-league football's managerial greats but was never quite accepted by the Hyde fans, even though he took the club to the FA Cup first round in 1983. This was possibly because of his Bower Fold background and Les Sutton's dismissal. After starting at Leek, Wragg led Stalybridge to the 1980 Cheshire League title, then moved to Chorley, who finished second to the Tigers in 1982 and were \"promoted\" with them to the NPL. Quit Hyde in 1986, ostensibly because of plans to install a synthetic pitch, but described his time at the club as akin to an unconsummated marriage. Moved to Macclesfield where he won the NPL treble of league, league cup and president's cup in 1987. Also managed Halifax and made two returns to Stalybridge where he achieved the seemingly impossible in helping them avoid relegation from the Conference in 1995. Later worked in sports promotions and was often seen carrying the Premier League trophy on to the pitch to be presented to the champions.\n\n1986-90\n\nPete O'Brien\n\nOne of Hyde United's favourite sons and most prolific strikers. Returned to Ewen Fields after five years as manager of Stalybridge Celtic and was in charge during one of the Tigers' most purple patches. Led the club to five cups, the semi-finals of the FA Trophy, two Clubcall Cup finals and made them into genuine promotion contenders. Joined Witton Albion in 1990, taking them to the NPL title and the 1992 FA Trophy final. Had a brief spell in charge at Glossop North before coming back to Hyde in 1993 when he won the Manchester Premier Cup and took the club to the NPL Cup final. Shocked the supporters by quitting to join Droylsden at the end of the season but was at the Butchers Arms less than six months. Died in 1996.\n\n1991\n\nGraham Bell\n\nAccomplished former Football League midfielder who stepped up to take over as caretaker manager following Pete O'Brien's departure and was then confirmed in the role. Results were poor and it was said he had to deal with a lot of dissent in the dressing room. Sacked in mid-April and signed for Mossley.\n\n1991-2\n\nCliff Roberts\n\nJoined Hyde from Northwich Victoria who were then a long-established Conference (National League) club and had enjoyed a lot of FA Cup success under his management. Struggled to make an impact at Ewen Fields and the fans became increasingly unhappy with his style of play. With the club facing mounting financial problems, he agreed to waive the final seven months of his contract. Later joined the coaching staff at Bury and was chief scout at Burnley.\n\n1992-93\n\nGed Coyne\n\nFormer Hyde United player who had been at Manchester United and Manchester City in the 1970s, Brother of Tigers striker Peter Coyne. Started his managerial career at East Manchester, then went to Mossley before moving to Ewen Fields. Was hampered by a shortage of funds and the deteriorating state of the ground and Baspograss pitch but made some good signings. Sacked after refusing to resign. Later managed Glossop North End. Now lives in Malta.\n\n1993-94\n\nPete O'Brien (See above)\n\n1994-2001\n\nMike McKenzie\n\nRan the all-conquering Astro Sunday team before winning the NPL Cup at Winsford United and leading the club into the NPL premier division and the first round of the FA Cup. Came to Hyde after an unhappy spell at Witton and was an immediate sensation. Playing fast, exciting, attacking football, his side reached the first round of the FA Cup and two FA Trophy semi-finals, taking many Conference scalps along the way including that of champions Stevenage in 1996. Unfortunately, Hyde became victims of their own success and their many cup runs meant that fixture congestion prevented them winning the league title they merited.\n\n2001-02\n\nDave Nolan\n\nNolan's appointment came as a surprise to many — especially as he was teamed up with Stalybridge defender Martin Filson who was separately recruited — but the directors took a gamble hoping the 100-per-cent attitude that made him so popular and successful as a player would carry over into management. Sadly, it didn't and Hyde only escaped relegation as Bishop Auckland were demoted for having a sub-standard ground. Things got no better the following season and Nolan was sacked in October, 2002.\n\n2002\n\nGordon Hill\n\nSeems to have been appointed on the spur of the moment after being sent by the PFA to take care of the managerless Hyde side as they prepared to meet Barrow in the FA Cup. Perhaps the directors were hoping his status as a member of Tommy Docherty's FA Cup-winning Manchester United side of 1977 was some sort of guarantee of success, but if so they were badly mistaken. Also riled supporters by poking fun at the club in an interview with BBC Radio Manchester. Sacked after winning just two of 19 league and cup games. Also managed Chester City.\n\n2002-08\n\nSteve Waywell\n\nOnly Hyde boss to win back-to-back titles: the NPL first division in 2003-04 followed by the league championship. A former Hyde player who managed Curzon Ashton from 1986 to 93. Moved to Leigh RMI (Genesis) in 1995 and took them from the NPL first division into the Conference. In 1998 they held a Fulham side managed by Kevin Keegan to a 1-1 draw at Craven Cottage in the first round of the FA Cup before losing the replay 2-0. At Christmas, 2007, Hyde were top of Conference North but then collapsed to finish ninth. Waywell, once a hero, was swiftly reduced to zero and his status wasn't helped when he admitted to having no interest in cups. He resigned at the start of the following season. Later briefly managed Chorley.\n\n2008-11\n\nNeil Tolson\n\nThe hugely likeable Tolson joined Hyde as a player and served as Waywell's number-two before becoming manager. Born in Dudley, the birthplace of Duncan Edwards, he played for six Football League clubs and was once viewed as having the potential to be a second Allan Clarke. Had the misfortune to manage Hyde during a period of great upheaval during which the club was wound up in the High Court and then entered into a deal with Manchester City which, for a time, led to many changes that left supporters deeply unhappy such as wearing white rather than red shirts and dropping the United suffix. Was sacked at the same time as many directors resigned. Joined the coaching staff at Altrincham and is now coaching in the USA.\n\n2011-12\n\nGary Lowe\n\nNot the most popular choice when appointed but quickly won the fans over as his side started the season with a record-breaking run of ten consecutive wins playing a stylish, passing game. Won the title by five points from Guiseley to lead Hyde into the National League for the only time in their history, then quit during the summer after a disagreement with club owner Jon Manship. Started his managerial career at Woodley Sports and was in charge at Curzon Ashton when they beat League Two Exeter City in the FA Cup. Returned to Ewen Fields in January, 2015, when the club was in freefall after a traumatic second season in the National League. Seemed to have rediscovered a winning formula at the start of the 2015-16 season but results tailed off in the new year and he was sacked in March as the Tigers neared their third relegation in as many years. Moved to Spain to manage a bar and died there at the end of 2020.\n\n2012-15\n\nScott McNiven\n\nOldham Athletic striker who was caretaker manager at Hyde in partnership with Steve Halford after Neil Tolson was sacked. Enjoyed a great first season in which the Tigers won some notable victories in the National League and were very briefly on the fringes of the play-off places. The following year was a disaster. Hyde won only one league game and became something of a figure of fun as Sky Sports' Jeff Stelling took to wearing a Tigers' scarf on the odd occasions they led in a Saturday game. Things got no better the next season and McNiven resigned after two heavy Christmas defeats by Stalybridge Celtic.\n\n2015-16\n\nGary Lowe (see above)\n\n2016-19\n\nDarren Kelly\n\nDerry-born defender who won 11 Northern Ireland caps at under-21 level and played for clubs including Derry City, Carlisle United and York City. Came to Hyde having managed Oldham Athletic and Halifax Town. Was unable to prevent relegation in his first season but led the Tigers back into the NPL premier division and to the first round of the FA Cup where they were home to Milton Keynes Dons in game televised by the BBC. During the summer of 2019 Kelly moved up to be director of football but soon left to take over as manager at Scarborough Athletic.\n\n2019 -"
