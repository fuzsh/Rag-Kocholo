        "text": "10 years have passed since Croatia’s accession to the EU and almost 20 years since Croatia was a candidate country. Despite EU membership, corruption remains a big issue in Croatia. Using new Ipsos data for UK in a Changing Europe, Stephanie Luke highlights that this has translated into a loss of faith in politics.\n\nThe countries covered in Ipsos’ polling for UK in a Changing Europe vary in size, party system and political history. One thing, though, pretty much unites them: their public’s dissatisfaction with democracy. Of the seven countries analysed, it is only in Sweden where a majority (58%) are satisfied with democracy. At the opposite end of the scale is Croatia, where the equivalent figure is 18%.\n\nIn the last 20 years, Croatia has transitioned from an EU candidate country to a fully-fledged member state. In doing so, the country has been compelled to work on developing its democratic institutions, an independent judiciary, as well as its ability to hold free and fair elections. Despite all this work on meeting the EU’s conditions for membership (the so-called acquis communautaire), corruption within Croatian governing institutions remains a big issue. In recent years, there have been multiple cases of corruption among government ministers and officials, as well as formal indictments of members of the country’s governing party.\n\nBoth the European Commission and local NGOs stress that corruption has not dissipated since Croatia joined the EU in 2013 but has in fact worsened. Croatia scores 50 on the Corruption Perceptions Index 2023, where 100 is very clean and 0 is highly corrupt. In comparison, the two largest EU member states – France and Germany – scored 71 and 78 respectively.\n\nIt’s true that countries which have more recently joined the EU tend to have lower scores; Poland, for example, scores 54 and Hungary 42. While concern around corruption is not only a Croatian issue, it does not bode well that the other two states with similar Index scores have come close to being sanctioned by the EU.\n\nCorruption erodes public trust and can lead to a loss of faith in politics. This is borne out by our data, particularly in Croatia. Indeed, Croatia is particularly unique in the sense that the demographic characteristics of age, education and political persuasion do not appear to affect the extent to which people feel represented or unrepresented.\n\n57% of Croatian respondents say they feel they are not represented by any major political party (HDZ, the SDP or Most). While this feeling is not exclusive to Croatia, it is not as widespread in any of the other countries surveyed. For example, the second highest score is 45% in France, while the lowest is 15% in Sweden.\n\nMore widely, 40% of those surveyed in Croatia believe their elected representative does a poor job of representing communities in their constituency; just 12% say their representative in their parliament does a good job. This is the highest level of dissatisfaction of the countries in our survey. Even among those who feel represented by at least one major party, the feeling that MPs do a bad job at representing their constituents persists.\n\nIndeed, a majority of people in Croatia regardless of whether they believe their MP does a good or bad job believe that the people who run the country put the needs of the rich and powerful first, and that the economy is rigged in favour of the powerful. 86% say politicians never or often do not keep their promises. Instances of improper hiring practices, bribery and fraud have contributed to the Croatian public believing that the people who run the country and the economy favour the rich and powerful before everyone else.\n\nFreedom House gives Croatia a democracy score of 4.25, where 7 represents the highest quality of democratic process and 1 the lowest. This is not the lowest score in the EU (with Poland scoring 4.54, and Hungary 3.57) but still leaves significant room for improvement. Indeed, this is reflected in the attitude of the Croatian public towards democracy.\n\nIn our survey we see that democratic dissatisfaction is particularly concentrated among those dissatisfied with the performance of their representatives, and who feel unrepresented by political parties. With several ongoing corruption cases involving government ministers, this is perhaps unsurprising.\n\nThe impact of this dissatisfaction and loss of faith can be seen in our survey too. Among the countries in the survey, Croatia has the highest proportion of people believing voting will not change anything. 47% of those who believe their MP is doing a bad job at representing their constituency also believe that there is no point voting because it does not change anything. They are therefore essentially stuck in a cycle of being unhappy with their representative. Even among those who have more positive assessments of their MP, 36% believe that their vote has little impact.\n\nTheir beliefs may be well-founded. Freedom House observed that in Croatia elections are free, but uneven electoral districts need reform to ensure voter equality- something which Croatia has begun to tackle by recently passing a new law addressing disparities.\n\nCorruption is still a significant issue, and the Croatian public are dissatisfied with not only how democracy is working, but how valuable their participation is. These sentiments are worrying at any time – but not least during a year which has been dubbed by the Croatian press as the ‘super election year’, with European, parliamentary and presidential elections all taking place in 2024.\n\nBy Dr Stephanie Luke, researcher, UK in a Changing Europe.\n\nYou can find the data referenced in this blog here."
