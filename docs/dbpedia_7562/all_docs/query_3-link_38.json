        "text": "This information is for people travelling on a full ‘British citizen’ passport from the UK. It is based on the UK government’s understanding of the current rules for the most common types of travel.\n\nThe authorities in Croatia set and enforce entry rules. If you’re not sure how these requirements apply to you, contact the Croatian Embassy in the UK.\n\nCOVID-19 rules\n\nThere are no COVID-19 testing or vaccination requirements for travellers entering Croatia.\n\nPassport validity requirements\n\nCroatia follows Schengen area rules. Your passport must:\n\nhave a ‘date of issue’ less than 10 years before the date you arrive – if you renewed your passport before 1 October 2018, it may have a date of issue that is more than 10 years ago\n\nhave an ‘expiry date’ at least 3 months after the day you plan to leave the Schengen area\n\nCheck with your travel provider that your passport and other travel documents meet requirements. Renew your passport if you need to.\n\nYou will be denied entry if you do not have a valid travel document or try to use a passport that has been lost or stolen.\n\nVisa requirements\n\nYou can travel without a visa to the Schengen area, which includes Croatia, for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. This applies if you travel:\n\nas a tourist\n\nto visit family or friends\n\nto attend business meetings, cultural or sports events\n\nfor short-term studies or training\n\nThe requirements for working in Croatia are different.\n\nIf you’re travelling to other Schengen countries make sure your whole visit is within the 90-day visa-free limit. Visits to Schengen countries in the 180 days before you travel count towards your 90 days.\n\nMake sure you get your passport stamped on entry and exit.\n\nIf you’re a visitor, border guards will look at your entry and exit stamps to check you have not overstayed the 90-day visa-free limit for the Schengen area.\n\nIf your passport is missing a stamp, show evidence of when and where you entered or left the Schengen area (for example, boarding passes or tickets) and ask the border guards to add the date and location in your passport.\n\nAt Croatian border control, you may also need to:\n\nshow proof of your accommodation, for example, a hotel booking confirmation or proof of address for a second home\n\nshow proof of your travel insurance\n\nshow a return or onward ticket\n\nprove that you have enough money for your stay – the amount varies depending on your accommodation\n\nStaying longer than 90 days in a 180-day period\n\nTo stay longer, you must meet the Croatian government’s entry requirements. Check which type of visa or work permit you need with the Croatian Embassy in the UK. See the Croatian Ministry of the Interior’s guidance on work permits.\n\nIf you’re in Croatia with a residence permit or long-stay visa, this does not count towards your 90-day visa-free limit.\n\nRead about passport stamping if you live in Croatia.\n\nCroatia-Slovenia border crossings\n\nThere are checks at Slovenia’s borders with Croatia. If you are travelling from Croatia to Slovenia, check travel advice for Slovenia.\n\nVaccine requirements\n\nFor details about medical entry requirements and recommended vaccinations, see TravelHealthPro’s Croatia guide.\n\nRegistering with the police\n\nYour accommodation provider must register your arrival in Croatia with the police within 48 hours. Your hotel will normally register you. If your accommodation provider is unable to do this for you, fill in and print form obrazac 16a (PDF). You must hand in the completed form at a police station. Alternatively, you should go to the nearest police station with the owner of the accommodation to register your address in Croatia.\n\nCustoms rules\n\nThere are strict rules about goods that can be brought into and taken out of Croatia. You must declare anything that may be prohibited or subject to tax or duty.\n\nTaking food into Croatia\n\nYou cannot take meat, milk or products containing them into EU countries. There are some exceptions such as powdered baby milk, baby food and special foods or pet feed required for medical reasons.\n\nTaking money into Croatia"
