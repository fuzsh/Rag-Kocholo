        "text": "Croatia ( kroh-AY-shə) is a unitary democratic parliamentary republic in Central and Southeastern Europe. Croatia has been influenced by powers from both regions at varying points in its history. Its capital and largest city is Zagreb. Croatia is a part of the Balkans, and was one of the republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became independent in 1991. It joined the European Union on 1 July 2013.\n\nIn earlier times, the land now known as Croatia was inhabited by different kinds of humans including Neanderthals and Neolithic cultures. In Roman times seafaring pirates known to the Romans as the Dalmatian Tribes lived there, as the Histri, Liburni and the Delmatae. The Romans conquered and annexed the territory in 9 AD. They called it the province of \"Dalmatia,\" named after these tribes. During more than 400 years of Roman rule, the province of Dalmatia would become Romanized. The Roman invaders mixed with the natives. Their descendants adopted a Roman lifestyle even after the collapse of the Roman state in 476 AD.\n\nIn the early seventh century pagan West Slavs named the Croats (where Croatia gets its name) came to live in the former province of Dalmatia. They conquered the people already living there. They were influenced by Roman Catholic Christian missionaries who completed the process of Christianization in the early 9th century. Tomislav in 925 was the first King of Croatia. Croatia was an independent Catholic kingdom until 1102, when a Hungarian prince inherited the Croatian throne. The Hungarians would rule as Kings of Croatia until the early modern period. The last Hungarian king of Croatia Louis II was killed at the Battle of Mohacs in 1526. The kingdom chose the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand as king the next year.\n\nCroatia would remain as a part of the empire of Austria-Hungary under Ferdinand's descendants until 1918. In 1918 it became a part of the Kingdom of Slovenians, Croats and Serbs, later named Yugoslavia. It was occupied in World War II. After a short war with Italy a fascist dictatorship formed the Independent State of Croatia in 1941. It was not independent from the control of Nazi Germany (see also Jasenovac concentration camp).\n\nIn 1945, Croatia became a part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which was non-aligned after breaking connections with the Eastern Bloc. It collapsed in 1991. Slovenia, then Croatia, later the other republics claimed independence and became parliamentary democracies. War in Yugoslavia made a strong impact on society in economic, political and cultural terms. Civil society and media that came out of anti-war struggle in Croatia grew against nationalism, media and civil freedoms, later also corruption.\n\nThe country's democratic development around 2000, made it possible for Croatia to finally join Slovenia as a European Union member on 1 July 2013.[4]\n\nIn recent decades Croatia is a popular tourist destination, especially the coastal regions of Dalmatia and Istria.\n\nCroatia is in Central and Southeast Europe, bordering Hungary to the northeast, Serbia to the east, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the south-east, Montenegro to the south-east, the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and Slovenia to the northwest. It lies mostly between latitudes 42° and 47° N and longitudes 13° and 20° E. Part of the territory in the extreme south surrounding Dubrovnik is a practical exclave connected to the rest of the mainland by territorial waters. It is separated by a short coastline strip belonging to Bosnia and Herzegovina around Neum.[5] Croatia is divided into 21 counties.\n\nCroatia is the 127th largest country in the world.[6] The highest point is the Dinara peak at 1,831 metres (6,007 feet). Thousands of islands are part of Croatia. 48 have people living there year-round. The largest islands are Cres and Krk.[6] Major rivers are the Sava, Drava, Kupa and Danube.\n\nThere are many deep caves in Croatia. 49 are deeper than 250 m (820.21 ft). Croatia's most famous lakes are the Plitvice lakes.\n\nMost of Croatia has a moderately warm and rainy continental climate. Average temperature ranges between −3 °C (27 °F) in January and 18 °C (64 °F) in July. The coldest parts of the country are Lika and Gorski Kotar. The warmest are at the Adriatic coast.\n\nThere are several ecoregions in Croatia. The coastline, forests, mountains, and rivers give Croatia diverse flora and fauna. There are more than a thousand endemic species.\n\nCroatia is home to the only known aquatic cave vertebrate—the olm.\n\nThere are 444 protected areas of Croatia. Those include eight national parks, two strict reserves, and ten nature parks. The oldest national park in Croatia is the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nCroatia adopted its constitution in 1990.[7] It declared independence from Yugoslavia on 8 October 1991.\n\nThe President of the Republic is the head of state. The President is directly elected to a five-year term. The Constitution limits the President to a maximum of two terms. Zoran Milanović became president in 2020.[8] The Prime Minister of Croatia is the head of government. Since 2016, the prime minister of the government is Andrej Plenković.\n\nAdministrative divisions\n\n[change | change source]\n\nCounty Seat Area (km2) Population at\n\n2011 Census Bjelovar-Bilogora Bjelovar 2,652 119,743 Brod-Posavina Slavonski Brod 2,043 158,559 Dubrovnik-Neretva Dubrovnik 1,783 122,783 Istria Pazin 2,820 208,440 Karlovac Karlovac 3 128,749 Koprivnica-Križevci Koprivnica 1,746 115,582 Krapina-Zagorje Krapina 1,224 133,064 Lika-Senj Gospić 5,350 51,022 Međimurje Čakovec 730 114,414 Osijek-Baranja Osijek 4,152 304,899 Požega-Slavonia Požega 1,845 78,031 Primorje-Gorski Kotar Rijeka 3,582 296,123 Sisak-Moslavina Sisak 4,463 172,977 Split-Dalmatia Split 4,534 455,242 Šibenik-Knin Šibenik 2,939 109,320 Varaždin Varaždin 1,261 176,046 Virovitica-Podravina Virovitica 2,068 84,586 Vukovar-Syrmia Vukovar 2,448 180,117 Zadar Zadar 3,642 170,398 Zagreb County Zagreb 3,078 317,642 City of Zagreb Zagreb 641 792,875\n\nCroatia is one of the richest countries of the Balkan Peninsula and of the former Yugoslavia's countries. But Croatia had also the highest cost prices of the whole Central Europe.

Many choose to continue their studies in high school until the age of 18.[11]\n\nAfter the war that devastated the country, Croatia has rebuilt its infrastructure. Its image is a Mediterranean country with crystal clear waters. It has medieval cities that mix western and eastern architecture. Dubrovnik is the symbol of this new Croatia that is strongly committed to European tourism.\n\nThere are many reasons to visit Croatia. Its six UNESCO World Heritage sites : Dubrovnik's Old Town (undoubtedly one of the most beautiful cities in Europe), the Diocletian's Palace in Split, the historic core of Trogir, the Cathedral of St. James of Sibenik, the Plitvice Lakes National Park, or the Episcopal Ensemble of the Euphrasian Basilica in the Historic Center of Porec (Istria) .\n\nThe coastline winds from the Istria Peninsula to the south of Dalmatia. Many people visit the islands, such as Hvar or Korcula in Dalmatia or Rab and Losinj in Kvarner Bay. Nudism is associated with Croatia, in its crystalline waters.\n\nRelated pages\n\n[change | change source]\n\nList of cities in Croatia\n\nCroatia at the Olympics\n\nCroatia national football team\n\nList of rivers of Croatia\n\nOther websites\n\n[change | change source]"
