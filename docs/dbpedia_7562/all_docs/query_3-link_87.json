        "text": "Croatia’s ruling conservative party won the most seats in a parliamentary election Wednesday (17 April) but not enough to form a government, according to almost complete official results, with tough talks ahead to gather a majority.\n\nIncumbent Prime Minister Andrej Plenković’s Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ, EPP-affiliated) won 61 seats in the 151-member assembly, results from more than 80% of the polling stations showed. In the previous 2020 vote, the party won 66 seats.\n\nA centre-left coalition led by the Social Democrats (SDP) won 42.\n\n“The HDZ won more mandates than the left altogether, which is an excellent result,” outgoing vice prime minister Davor Božinović said.\n\nSDP leader Pedja Grbin admitted that the results were not what they wished for, but he insisted they “showed that… people want a change”.\n\n“It’s not over,” he said at the party headquarters in Zagreb, announcing that talks on a possible post-election coalition would start Thursday.\n\nThe nationalist right-wing Homeland Movement party came third, with 13 seats.\n\nAnalysts estimate it has a big negotiating potential, which could make it a kingmaker in forming a new government.\n\nAn ultra-conservative and a green-left party won 11 and 10 seats each.\n\n“It will be a very difficult negotiating process” to form a new government, political analyst Tihomir Cipek told Nova TV.\n\nHigh turnout\n\nTurnout was 61%, compared with 47% during the 2020 vote.\n\nThe elections were held after a bitter campaign between Plenković and left-wing populist President Zoran Milanović, who campaigned despite a court warning.\n\nThe showdown came as the European Union nation wrestles with corruption, a labour shortage, the highest inflation rate in the eurozone and illegal migration.\n\nFor months, Plenković and his HDZ seemed poised for an easy victory that would secure his third term as premier.\n\nBut in mid-March, Milanović — who tops political popularity surveys — made the shock announcement that he would challenge Plenković and become candidate for the Social Democrats.\n\nThe Croatian presidency is a largely ceremonial office for a person without a political affiliation.\n\nCalling Plenković the “godfather of crime” Milanović, 57, highlighted the recent appointment of the country’s new chief prosecutor, a judge with alleged ties to corruption suspects.\n\nCorruption has long been the Achilles heel of the HDZ.\n\nSeveral of Plenković’s ministers have stepped down following accusations and the anti-graft fight was key to Croatia’s bid to join the EU in 2013.\n\n‘Pro-Russian’\n\nMilanović canvassed across Croatia despite the country’s top court ruling that he could only stand in the election if he steps down as president first.\n\nPlenković — who has served as premier since 2016 — accused his rival of violating the constitution, engaging in hate speech and called him a “coward” for not resigning.\n\nThe prime minister stressed his role in guiding the country of 3.8 million people into the eurozone and Europe’s passport-free Schengen area last year.\n\nBut with an average monthly wage of €1,240, the country remains one of the EU’s poorest.\n\n“The global security situation has never been more tense and more dangerous … so we need to have very responsible people running Croatia in the next four years,” Plenković, 54, said after voting in Zagreb.\n\nPlenković has repeatedly accused Milanović of being “pro-Russian” due to his criticism of EU backing for Ukraine against Russia’s invasion and the president’s opposition to training Ukrainian soldiers in Croatia, which is a NATO member.\n\nMilanović, who has condemned Russia’s campaign in Ukraine, has argued that he was protecting Croatian interests and sought to prevent the country being “dragged into war”.\n\nThe HDZ has ruled Croatia for most of the period since its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, while the SDP has been the opposition mainstay.\n\nMilanović, who served as prime minister from 2011 to 2016, is known for his fiery rhetoric and profanity in tirades against HDZ opponents, EU officials and his critics.\n\nHis mandate expires in January but he said he would step down if the SDP and its allies secure a majority to form a new government.\n\nRead more with Euractiv"
