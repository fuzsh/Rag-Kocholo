        "text": "This guide is for British citizens travelling for business or other work purposes. It explains what employers, employees, or the self-employed need to do if they need a visa or permit.\n\nThis information is provided as a guide only. You must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Croatia’s embassy or immigration authorities.\n\nEntry requirements\n\nIf you’re going to Croatia to work (or any other EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein) you must make sure you meet passport and other travel requirements.\n\nCroatia is in the Schengen area. If you’re travelling for business for up to 90 days in a 180-day period, you may be able to do some business-related activities without needing a visa or permit, such as attend business meetings. It does not matter how many countries you visit in the Schengen area. Your total stay must be no more than 90 days in every 180 days. The 180-day period keeps ‘rolling’.\n\nIf you’re staying for longer, or for other types of work, you may need a visa or permit.\n\nThe Croatian authorities are responsible for setting and enforcing entry rules. They decide which activities need a visa or permit, or which may be exempt.\n\nIf you’re working in more than one country, you need to check the entry rules of each country.\n\nIf you need a passport, visa or permit, you should apply well in advance of travel.\n\nVisa and permit documents\n\nThis guide explains the general application process for some of the visa or permit types available in Croatia. It includes a checklist of documents that you’ll usually need to include when applying.\n\nIt may not cover all scenarios so you must always check the exact application process and document requirements with Croatia’s embassy or immigration authorities.\n\nYou must also check what format the documents should be presented in, including if they must be:\n\ntranslated\n\n‘legalised’ (with an apostille) or notarised\n\noriginals, or if copies are acceptable\n\nsigned in ink (a wet signature), or if they can be signed electronically (an e-signature)\n\ndated within a certain period of time, such as 30 days before you submit your application\n\nCountries often use the terms visa, work permit and residence permit differently. For example, some may refer to a work permit as a visa. This guide uses the same terms used in Croatia, so you know which ones to use when speaking to Croatia’s authorities.\n\nCheck if you need a visa or permit\n\nYou do not need a visa or permit if you’re travelling to Croatia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period for specific business-related activities. These activities can include:\n\nrunning or attending job interviews\n\ngoing to court as witness\n\nattending trade fairs\n\nattending conferences (not presenting)\n\nattending board meetings\n\nmeeting clients or customers\n\nmeeting colleagues, contractors or sellers\n\ntouring a company facility\n\nteam building activities\n\nThese activities are covered by the Schengen visa waiver.\n\nBorder checks\n\nAt the border, you may be asked to show:\n\nproof of return travel, such as plane or train tickets\n\nhealth insurance that covers your entire stay\n\nproof of accommodation for your entire stay\n\nenough money for the duration of your trip\n\nan invitation letter from your employer explaining your trip\n\nCheck Croatia’s exemptions\n\nCertain types of work and activities do not require a visa or permit because they’re exempt.\n\nAll countries have their own exemptions. What may be exempt in one country may not be in another. You should always check with the country’s authorities.\n\nThe following may not require a visa or permit in Croatia for up to 90 days in a 180-day period:\n\nthose carrying out activities related to the incorporation and registration of a company or sole proprietorship (‘craft business’ (obrt))\n\nthose with an EU intra-company transfer (EU ICT) permit from another country – the Croatian company must send a posted worker declaration to the Ministry of Labour, by email or post\n\nExemptions are covered by the visa waiver.\n\nShow proof of exemption\n\nYou need to be able to show proof that you’re exempt to the authorities on request. This could be your EU ICT permit if you have one.\n\nFurther checks\n\nIf you’re not sure if you need a visa or permit to travel you can get advice from Croatia’s embassy or immigration authorities.\n\nApplying for a visa or permit\n\nThis guide outlines the steps required for each visa or permit to help you prepare, but you’ll need to check the exact rules and processes with Croatia’s embassy or immigration authorities.\n\nTaking your family\n\nIf you have a family they won’t be able to get dependant permits if you’re working in Croatia short term. They may be able to join you for up to 90 days under the visa waiver.\n\nPartners, and children under 18 may be able to join you if you have a temporary residence permit.
