        "text": "PUBLISHED: 18.3.2024.\n\nThe Croatian legislation system is based on civil law, mainly following its predecessors: Austrian, Hungarian, and Yugoslav law. Since Croatia entered the European Union, many laws have been changed to comply with EU laws.\n\nThe Croatian parliament has legislative power, which means they can vote on bills regarding new laws or adjustment of laws in the parliament. On the other hand, Croatian courts are independent and autonomous, and they are in charge of administering the law.\n\nIn this article, we cover:\n\nCroatian vs. foreign legal system\n\nCroatian judicial system and courts\n\nEuropean courts and their structure\n\nMeet our lawyers and get help\n\nReviews from our happy clients\n\nThe facts are these…\n\nDifference between the Croatian legal system and the rest of the world\n\nThere are three main types of legal systems in the world:\n\nCivilno/kontinentalno pravo (civil/continental law)\n\nObičajno pravo (common law)\n\nVjersko pravo (religious law)\n\nThe legal systems of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia rely on common law rooted in customs. In contrast, most European countries follow civil law built upon civil codes.\n\nCivil law in Europe traces its roots back to Roman law, which provided the foundational structure for this legal framework. This system, named after the Latin term jus civile, translating to citizen’s law, is the most widely employed legal system globally.\n\nLike most European countries, Croatia has its constitution called Ustav Republike Hrvatske, also called Božićni ustav (Christmas Constitution), because it was passed on December 22, 1990. It is the foundation of all laws passed by the legislature.\n\nThe constitution is followed by laws such as the Kazneni zakon (Criminal Law Act) or Zakon o radu (Labor Act) and bylaws such as various decrees, regulations, orders, and instructions. Contact us if you have any questions regarding Croatian laws and our English-speaking lawyer network will help you solve your case.\n\nOn July 1, 2013, Croatia became a member of the European Union. Its goal is to create a unified internal market based on a standardized legal framework and legislation that applies in all member states in those matters where the states have agreed to act as one.\n\nLaws made by the EU institutions are passed in two forms:\n\nRegulations – they come into force without the necessity for national implementation\n\nDirectives – they require national implementation\n\nCroatian judicial system – types of Croatian courts\n\nCroatian courts protect the legal order of the Republic of Croatia established by the Constitution, the acquis of the European Union, international treaties, and laws.

These courts also settle jurisdiction conflicts among lower courts.\n\nFirst-instance courts, generally presided over by a single sudac (judge), may involve sudska vijeća (trial chambers) based on legal requirements. Higher-level courts, however, typically employ trial chambers, with exceptions allowing a single judge.\n\nFollowing the law, sudski savjetnici (court advisors) and suci porotnici (lay judges) participate in trials alongside professional judges. Criminal procedures usually involve panels consisting of one professional judge and two lay judges, with some exceptions.\n\nLay judges in Croatia are distinct from common law juries. They serve a 4-year term, can be called multiple times, and are appointed for both criminal and civil cases. Unlike common law juries, lay judges decide on facts, apply legal norms, and determine guilt and sanctions alongside professional judges. In common law, the jury only decides on facts and guilt, while the judge delivers the sentence.\n\nWe can put you in touch with our expat-vetted lawyers to help you with your litigation or bureaucratic procedure with high expertise and knowledge.
