It presents a succinct analysis encompassing the following key aspects: the current health status in Croatia; the determinants of health, focusing on behavioural risk factors; the organisation of the Croatian healthcare system; and an evaluation of the health system's effectiveness, accessibility, and resilience. Moreover, the 2023 edition presents a thematic section on the state of mental health and associated services in Croatia.\n\nThis profile is the collaborative effort of the OECD and the European Observatory on Health Systems and Policies, carried out in cooperation with the European Commission."
