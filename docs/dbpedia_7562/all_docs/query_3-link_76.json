The agreement provides for the recognition of each other’s existing current winemaking practices as of the date of signing, as well as a consultative process for accepting new winemaking practices. As such, the EU must allow entry of U.S. wine products made in accordance with U.S. winemaking standards into the EU.\n\nBack to Top\n\nREQUIRED DOCUMENTS\n\nThe following is a list of the documents that are required and/or recommended when importing alcohol beverages into Croatia and/or any other EU member state.

A Single Administrative Document or SAD is required for this purpose. This is the approved form for the import declaration process. Further information on the SAD can be found on the EU website.\n\nThe Single Administrative Document (SAD) may be submitted to the Croatian Customs Administration, either through physical means or through an electronic declaration.\n\nGoods are released from Customs for “free circulation” once the pertinent documents have been filed and payment of tariff duties has been completed. After paying the Value Added Tax (VAT) and any other explicable excise duty, goods are also released for consumption and ready to be marketed.\n\nWine-Specific Import Requirements:\n\nThird Country (e.g., U.S.) wines imported into the EU must also be accompanied by a simplified export certificate or VI-1 document.Third Country (e.g., U.S.) wines imported into the EU must also be accompanied by a simplified export certificate or VI-1 document.\n\nFor more information on the simplified export certificate, please visit the VI-1 Forms for Exporting Wine to the European Union section of our Export Documents webpage.\n\nFurther information on EU import regulations for wine can also be found on the U.S. Mission to the European Union website.\n\nBack to Top\n\nTAXES/TARIFFS\n\nImport value-added tax is an indirect tax on goods and services, which is borne by the end consumer and applied to the value added at each stage of the supply chain. In Croatia, it is referred to as the PDV. The import value-added tax is assessed according to the customs value of imported goods. The importer may be entitled to claim a refund of the import VAT from the tax office once the product has been sold.Import value-added tax is an indirect tax on goods and services, which is borne by the end consumer and applied to the value added at each stage of the supply chain.

The importer may be entitled to claim a refund of the import VAT from the tax office once the product has been sold.\n\nThe end-user is liable for the Value Added Tax (VAT), which is levied at a standard rate of 20% in Croatia. The rates for the import value-added tax and the VAT are identical. The VAT is a pure tax on transactions that is ultimately absorbed by the end-user or consumer. Please note that the import value-added tax is levied in addition to any applicable excise taxes or tariff duties.\n\nFor the most current tariffs and taxes applied to imported products in Croatia, please visit the EU Tariff and Taxation Union TARIC database.
