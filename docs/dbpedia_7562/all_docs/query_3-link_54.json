In 1918, the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes formed a kingdom known after 1929 as Yugoslavia. Following World War II, Yugoslavia became a federal independent communist state consisting of six socialist republics under the strong hand of Marshal Josip Broz, aka TITO. Although Croatia declared its independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, it took four years of sporadic, but often bitter, fighting before occupying Yugoslav forces, dominated by Serb officers, were mostly cleared from Croatian lands, along with a majority of Croatia's ethnic Serb population. Under UN supervision, the last Serb-held enclave in eastern Slavonia was returned to Croatia in 1998. The country joined NATO in April 2009 and the EU in July 2013.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSoutheastern Europe, bordering the Adriatic Sea, between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n45 10 N, 15 30 E\n\nMap references\n\nEurope\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 56,594 sq km\n\nland: 55,974 sq km\n\nwater: 620 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 128\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than West Virginia\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 2,237 km\n\nborder countries (5): Bosnia and Herzegovina 956 km, Hungary 348 km, Montenegro 19 km, Serbia 314 km, Slovenia 600 km\n\nCoastline\n\n5,835 km(mainland 1,777 km, islands 4,058 km)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200-m depth or to the depth of exploitation\n\nClimate\n\nMediterranean and continental;

The country's output during that time collapsed, and Croatia missed the early waves of investment in Central and Eastern Europe that followed the fall of the Berlin Wall. Between 2000 and 2007, however, Croatia's economic fortunes began to improve with moderate but steady GDP growth between 4% and 6%, led by a rebound in tourism and credit-driven consumer spending. Inflation over the same period remained tame and the currency, the kuna, stable.Croatia experienced an abrupt slowdown in the economy in 2008; economic growth was stagnant or negative in each year between 2009 and 2014, but has picked up since the third quarter of 2014, ending 2017 with an average of 2.8% growth. Challenges remain including uneven regional development, a difficult investment climate, an inefficient judiciary, and loss of educated young professionals seeking higher salaries elsewhere in the EU. In 2016, Croatia revised its tax code to stimulate growth from domestic consumption and foreign investment. Income tax reduction began in 2017, and in 2018 various business costs were removed from income tax calculations. At the start of 2018, the government announced its economic reform plan, slated for implementation in 2019.Tourism is one of the main pillars of the Croatian economy, comprising 19.6% of Croatia’s GDP. Croatia is working to become a regional energy hub, and is undertaking plans to open a floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal by the end of 2019 or early in 2020 to import LNG for re-distribution in southeast Europe.Croatia joined the EU on July 1, 2013, following a decade-long accession process. Croatia has developed a plan for Eurozone accession, and the government projects Croatia will adopt the Euro by 2024. In 2017, the Croatian government decreased public debt to 78% of GDP, from an all-time high of 84% in 2014, and realized a 0.8% budget surplus - the first surplus since independence in 1991. The government has also sought to accelerate privatization of non-strategic assets with mixed success. Croatia’s economic recovery is still somewhat fragile; Croatia’s largest private company narrowly avoided collapse in 2017, thanks to a capital infusion from an American investor. Restructuring is ongoing, and projected to finish by mid-July 2018.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$102.1 billion (2017 est.)\n\n$99.37 billion (2016 est.)\n\n$95.97 billion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 85\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$54.76 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - real growth rate\n\n2.8% (2017 est.)\n\n3.5% (2016 est.)\n\n2.4% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 121\n\nGDP - per capita (PPP)\n\n$24,700 (2017 est.)\n\n$23,800 (2016 est.)\n\n$22,800 (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 81\n\nGross national saving\n\n24.7% of GDP (2017 est.)\n\n23.4% of GDP (2016 est.)\n\n24.5% of GDP (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 62\n\nGDP - composition, by end use\n\nhousehold consumption: 57.3% (2017 est.)\n\ngovernment consumption: 19.5% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in fixed capital: 20% (2017 est.)\n\ninvestment in inventories: 0% (2017 est.)\n\nexports of goods and services: 51.1% (2017 est.)\n\nimports of goods and services: -48.8% (2017 est.)\n\nGDP - composition, by sector of origin\n\nagriculture: 3.7% (2017 est.)\n\nindustry: 26.2% (2017 est.)\n\nservices: 70.1% (2017 est.)\n\nAgriculture - products\n\narable crops (wheat, corn, barley, sugar beet, sunflower, rapeseed, alfalfa, clover);
