        "text": "Montenegro emerged as a sovereign state after just over 55% of the population opted for independence in a May 2006 referendum.\n\nThe vote heralded the end of the former Union of Serbia and Montenegro - itself created only three years earlier out of the remnant of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nThe EU-brokered deal forming it was intended to stabilise the region by settling Montenegrin demands for independence from Serbia and preventing further changes to Balkan borders.\n\nThe same deal also contained the seeds of the union's dissolution. It stipulated that after three years the two republics could hold referendums on whether to keep or scrap it. Montenegro opted for the latter.\n\nMontenegro, which means \"Black Mountain\", borders Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia, Serbia's breakaway province of Kosovo and Albania. About half of it is covered in thick forest.\n\nThe tiny republic encompasses an Adriatic coastline, lowlands and high mountain ranges. The Tara River canyon is the deepest and longest in Europe.\n\nDritan Abazovic took over as prime minister of Montenegro in April 2022. He heads the United Reform Action party and previously served as deputy prime minister in the cabinet of Zdravko Krivokapic from 2020 until 2022.\n\nHe was the first ethnic Albanian to serve as prime minister of Montenegro.\n\nThe new government comprised a broad coalition of pro-European and pro-Serb parties. Abazovic said the government's main focus was on reforms required by the EU so that Montenegro can ask to speed up its accession process, and the fight against corruption.\n\nIn August 2022, parliament passed a motion of no confidence in his government. He remains in power as a caretaker prime minister pending the formation of a new government."
