However, it has been operating in other organisational forms in the territory of the Republic of Croatia since 1971.\n\nThe association has 127 members and finances its activities from membership fees, EU funds, international grants, registration fees from expert meetings, donations, etc. Each member city in the association is represented by a mayor. The basics of operation are regulated by the Statute and the Rules of Procedure.\n\nAddress\n\nPalmotiÄ‡eva ul. 25-10 000, 10000, Zagreb, Croatia\n\nContact"
