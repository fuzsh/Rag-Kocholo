The Adriatic coastline, which includes 1,185 islands, islets, and reefs -- of which only 66 are inhabited -- is 5,740 km (3,566 miles) long, and is famed for its clear waters. The highest peak is the Dinara Mountain at 1,831 m (5951 feet) above sea level. The republic swings around like a boomerang from the Pannonian Plains of Slavonia between the Sava, Drava, and Danube Rivers, across hilly central Croatia to the Istrian Peninsula, then south through Dalmatia along the rugged Adriatic coast. Croatiaâ€™s geography is diverse with its rocky coastline, densely wooded mountains, plains, lakes, and rolling hills. In an effort to preserve its environment, Croatia maintains eight national parks."
