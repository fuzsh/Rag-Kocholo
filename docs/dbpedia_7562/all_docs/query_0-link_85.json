        "text": "By Dunja Kuecking\n\nDunja Kuecking is a graduate of the Faculty of Dentistry of the University of Zagreb (1983). Since 1996, she has been the head of the Center for legal research and documentation, Intellectio Iuris, whose job is to analyze, systematize, and make available on the Internet a catalogue of court practices and legal articles in Croatia. Intellectio Iuris is a legal database of Croatia’s laws, court decisions, articles and interpretations, and selected documents in English.\n\nMilivoje Žugić is a graduate of the Faculty of Law of the University of Zagreb (1969). He worked as a judge until 1982, when he entered a private law practice. He lives and works in Zagreb, and specializes in land registry law. He is the author of a paper about the legal position of clients of the Bank of Ljubljana (Ljubljanska Banka) after the dissolution of former Yugoslavia.\n\nIndependence\n\nHow did the Republic of Croatia come into being and what is its legal basis? Croatia was established with the dissolution of Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) and it is one of its legal successors. The document that supports its existence as an independent state is the Constitutional Decree of Sovereignty and Independence of Republic of Croatia, published on June 25, 1991. Therein, the Republic of Croatia proclaims its sovereignty and independence from the former Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia. The second document that justifies Croatia’s independence is the decision the Parliament made on October 8, 1991 to seek international acceptance as an independent state. In Croatia’s national law, this date is considered to be the first day of the beginning for Croatia as an independent state although Croatia was not officially recognized as a state until January 15, 1992. That date could be considered its international birthday.\n\nA hierarchy of legal norms characterizes the legal system in Croatia. They are arranged in four levels, and the norms lower in rank have to be congruent with those of higher levels. The highest norm is the Constitution – the fundamental law. The constitution was originally made on December 22, 1990. It went through some important changes in 1997, 2000 and 2001. It is based on two important principles: division of power in the government and the rule of law. Ranking in importance after the constitution are constitutional laws (4), international contracts, laws and sub-statutory acts. The Parliament of the Republic of Croatia enacts the first three while bodies of executive power are bringing sub statutory acts.\n\nThe Structure of the Croatian Government\n\nCroatia is a parliamentary democracy. Croatia possesses a multi-party system based on the principle of three branches of government (system of tripartite authority).\n\nLegislative\n\nExecutive\n\nJudicial\n\nTo some experts, its specific jurisdiction makes the Constitutional Court a fourth authority/power.\n\nEach one of these branches of government has the highest authority in its sphere of influence. The legislative branch has the highest authority in making laws, executive in executing those laws, and judicial in judging its subjects. The Constitutional court could be sui generis considered a fourth portion of the government. The chiefs of local executive bodies are nominated and are exempted from their posts by the President.\n\nFor additional information, please also see the final section in this guide, Online Resources in Croatia.\n\nThe Legislative Branch\n\nThe highest organ of the judicial branch is the Parliament of the Republic of Croatia (Sabor Republike Hrvatske). The Parliament has only one house, and representatives (zastupnici) to the Parliament are elected in direct parliamentary elections, held once every four years. Eligible voters are all men and women over the age of 18. The Election Act regulates the elections in detail.\n\nThe Parliament has 120 representatives and authority to enact laws in any session where a majority of representatives are present. There are two kinds of laws:\n\nOrdinary laws – The parliament is entitled to declare those in any session where more than 1/2 of the present representatives votes for their passing.\n\nEssential laws (the Constitution calls them “organic” laws) – Laws concerned with basic rights and freedoms of ethnic and national communities.\n\nThe Parliament is entitled to declare Organic laws if the “qualified majority” (2/3 of present representatives) votes for their passing.\n\nThe Executive Branch\n\nConsidering the fact that Croatia is a parliamentary democracy, the executive power is divided between the President (Predsjednik Republike Hrvatske) and the Cabinet (Vlada Republike Hrvatske). The President is elected in direct presidential elections for a period of five years, and can serve two terms. The President represents the state in the country and abroad, and his powers are essentially those of state protocol. He has the authority to dissolve the Parliament and he proposes a candidate for a mandate of Prime Minister. The Cabinet holds the highest executive power in Croatia. According to protocol, the President appoints the Prime Minister of the Cabinet who is usually a president of the party that has most votes in the Parliament. The Prime Minister is confirmed by the Parliament, and he has the power to appoint the members of his Cabinet. The Cabinet of the Republic of Croatia is made up of the Prime Minister and 13 ministries.\n\nList of ministries (names, addresses, telephones, faxes, E-mails and URLs)\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration\n\nTrg Nikole Subića Zrinjskog 7-8\n\n10 000 Zagreb\n\nPhone: +385 1 456 9964\n\nFax: +385 1 455 1795\n\ne-mail: ured.drzavnog.tajnika@mvp.hr\n\nMinister: Mr. sc.

State Judiciary Council appoints all judges for life as an independent state institution formed of Parliament members, judicial authorities, well-respected public persons and members of Croatian Bar Association. Minister of Justice names the presidents of the courts from among the appointed judges and the president of the Supreme Court of Croatia is chosen by the Parliament based on the proposition from the Cabinet.\n\nTypes of courts:\n\nCourts of General Jurisdiction\n\nCommercial Courts\n\nPolice Courts\n\nAdministrative Court\n\nCourts of General Jurisdiction\n\nCourts of General Jurisdiction are the cornerstones of judicial practice in Croatia. These courts judge in all disputes except in those where law explicitly determines jurisdiction of another court. These courts are organized hierarchically in three instances and are divided into regions.\n\nA) Municipal Courts\n\nMunicipal Courts are courts with first instance jurisdiction in both civil and penal cases. In penal litigation the courts judge in all cases where the penalty goes up to 10 years. The novelty is that legal persons can also be liable for criminal acts. In civil litigation these courts judge as first instance courts in all judicial, extra-judicial and execution procedures, especially in litigation against unlawful actions, and lawsuits for correction of information.\n\nMunicipal courts hold land registers that are the only legally valid registry service of real rights in Croatia. Reform of the land registry is taking place right now. Thanks to the international donations lady ministry of justice Mrs. Vesna Skare Ozbolt is conducting a reform. The main goal of the project is to enable fast and transparent insight in to the legal state of real estate in the Republic of Croatia. It should help economic governing and encourage foreign investments.\n\nB) County Courts\n\nCounty courts are almost exclusively second instance courts. On occasion these courts are used as first instance courts: in penal litigation if the punishment by law surpasses 10 years or by special regulations (the court decides in the compensation amount for expropriated real estate, it decides on a right to belong to an association etc.). It is important to recognize that a right to appeal is a constitutional right of every citizen and a right of every legal entity (for instance corporation) according to the practice of the Constitutional court. The practice states that every legal entity can appeal against any and all acts of either executive or judicial power, which determine the entities legal rights and obligations. As all court decisions are acts of judicial branch of government the structure allows for an appeal against any decision made by the municipal courts. In that case district court acts as a court of appeal.\n\nC) The Supreme Court\n\nSupreme Court is a court of full jurisdiction with respect to court decisions and it can void them, confirm them or revise them (unlike in France or Italy). The Supreme court is the highest court in Croatia and as the last instance it decides on extraordinary legal remedies against valid court decisions of the courts of general jurisdiction (dismissed appeal), and all other courts in Croatia. The Supreme Court is also an appellate court in all cases where municipal court was the first instance.\n\nAs we mentioned before the sources of law in Croatia are the Constitution, international contracts, laws and sub-statutory acts and the courts judge accordingly based on all four. Now, if a court is of an opinion that one of the laws in practice is unconstitutional it is it’s duty to inform the Supreme Court of that fact and stop trying all cases that fall under that particular law. The Supreme Court can then start the process of constitutional challenge – constitutional revue of the law (ocjena ustavnosti). If the Supreme Court does not do so in a prearranged time period the court that started the motion with the Supreme Court to file for the constitutional challenge should continue trying those cases in accordance with that law. The situation is quite different with sub-statutory acts. If a court deems a sub-statutory act unconstitutional it can refuse to apply it.\n\nSupreme Court of the Republic of Croatia\n\nTrg Nikole Subica Zrinjskog 3\n\n10 000 Zagreb\n\nPhone: +385 1 486 2239\n\nFax: +385 1 486 2254\n\ne-mail: vsrh@vsrh.hr\n\nCommercial courts\n\nAll commercial courts are hierarchical and are organized in two instances. First instance courts try cases between commercial subjects in bankruptcy proceedings, liquidation procedures, maritime litigation, litigation over patent and intellectual property rights, execution procedures, commercial violations and any other violations committed by enterprises. They have a broad jurisdiction in non-litigation procedures in accordance with the commercial laws of the country. For instance: it can call for a general meeting of shareholders, by request of minor shareholders it can impeach a bankruptcy liquidator of the commercial enterprise etc. The court manages the registry of all commercial enterprises in Croatia.\n\nAppeals against judgments of first instance commercial courts are solved at High commercial court level (this is a full jurisdiction court) in its seat in Zagreb. The Supreme Court of Croatia decides upon the legal remedies against the decisions of High commercial court.\n\nHigh commercial court\n\nBerislaviceva 11\n\n10 000 Zagreb,\n\nPhone: + 385 1 489 6888\n\nPolice Courts\n\nThese courts pass judgments on physical and legal persons for misdemeanour offices.\n\nThey are organized in two instances:\n\nFirst instance police court organized on municipal level.\n\nHigh Police Court in Zagreb – as an appellate court.\n\nJurisdiction according to special legal remedies for appeals to the decisions of High Police Court is possible at the Supreme Court of Croatia.\n\nHigh Police Court\n\nDukljanova 3\n\n10 000 Zagreb\n\nPhone: +385 1 461 1333\n\nAdministrative court\n\nThis court has its seat in Zagreb and is really interesting. The process before this court commences by filing an action to set aside second instance decision of the executive body or first instance decisions against which appeal is not allowed by regulation. (This supports the principle of having a constitutional right to an appeal although it is not really an appeal but an entirely new lawsuit) This court passes judgments solely by drawing information directly from the file and without directly determining the facts of the cases. It is not a full jurisdiction court and European court for human rights does not recognize its judicial powers.\n\nAdministrative Court of the Republic of Croatia\n\nTrg Nikole Subica Zrinskog 3\n\n10 000 Zagreb,\n\nPhone: +385 1 481 0022\n\nAll court processes are thoroughly regulated by procedural rules under which legal remedies have an important role. Legal remedies are well-developed means that are available to civil personas in all different levels of judicial decision-making process. Arbitration is a viable option in every instance of the courts.\n\nConstitutional Court of Croatia\n\nThis is not really a court, although it is called that way, and it does have some judicial authority. It is definitely not a court with full jurisdiction. It was conceptualized as a forth branch of government, and its authority is provided for by the Constitution. It is called the fourth portion of the government because it has some power over all three branches of government. The details of its day-to-day operation are set in a special constitutional act – Constitutional Court Act. The judges to the constitutional court are elected to run a term of eight years and there are provisions for their re-election. The purpose of this court is to keep the purity of the legal system. Its primary job is to solve constitutional challenges of laws and sub-statutory acts by perform their constitutional revues (ocjena zakonitosti, ocjena ustavnosti). The court has an authority to abolish laws if it rules that the particular law is unconstitutional (it rarely does so and most of the time the legislative power complies with its requests to modify the existing laws and bring them in accordance with the Constitution). There are two types of entities that can initiate the procedure before the Constitutional court:\n\nObligatory – their initiative obliges the constitutional court to initiate the procedure of challenging constitutionality of the law or lawfulness of a sub-statutory act (Supreme Court, the Cabinet etc.)\n\nFacultative – where the Constitutional Court preliminary decide whether it will initiate the procedure of constitutional revue of laws and lawfulness of a sub-statutory act. This enables ordinary citizens to move forward with the proposition.\n\nIn the latter case the constitutional court is not under obligation to start a process, but it has an obligation to rule on each proposition and state will it or will it not start the procedure and why. Judgments of regular courts are called verdicts and writs, while judgments of the constitutional court are called decisions and writs.\n\nDecisions of the Constitutional Court are judgment in meritum and writs are judgments non meritum (these are the matters of process). All of the decisions of the constitutional court must be published in Narodne Novine – the official gazette of Republic of Croatia. Writs are published only if the constitutional court decides to publish them. It is important to recognize that all of the decisions of the constitutional court are considered a president (case law) because according to the constitution all courts and other governmental bodies must adhere to opinions and interpretations of the constitution and laws taken by constitutional court. Beside this fundamental jurisdiction this court helps in execution and control over the elections to the Parliament and solves any questions concerning the conflict of jurisdiction of the legislative, executive and judicial powers. The court decides on appeals against the decisions of State Judiciary Council to impeach judges due to disciplinary violations. Any breaches of human rights guaranteed by the constitution also fall under its jurisdiction. Only in these matters this court can interfere in particular judicial acts (litigation), and this is the sole reason it was named a court although it stands completely outside the hierarchy of the courts. If rights and freedoms of any individual citizen (or a legal entity) are hurt trough any act of judicial or executive power, they have a right to protection, with respect to procedural assumptions (lawsuit was filed in allotted time period – 30 days, and all other legal remedies have been exhausted), based on a constitutional complaint (ustavna tuzba) – specific legal action before the constitutional court. If it pertains to a judicial act the constitutional court appears to be the court of the fourth instance (an instance above the Supreme Court) but with exclusive jurisdiction to confirm or deny the decisions validity. This is in accordance with European tradition and completely opposed with the practice in the United States of America.\n\nConstitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia\n\nTrg Sv.

Economic, social and cultural rights of individuals are also provided for in other parts of the Constitution.\n\nCroatia is a co-signer of many international conventions and contracts (be that it signed them itself or accepted them as a legal successor of SFRY – Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia) concerning the human rights and freedoms, in particular: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, International covenant of Civil and Political Rights, International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Final Act of Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, Charter of Paris for a New Europe and what is most important, the European Convention of Basic Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n\nThis is important because it shows that Croatia has accepted the concept of international protection of human rights and liberties, and therefore accepted the jurisdiction of the European Court for Human Rights in the field of human rights and liberties. So, this court could be on occasion a fifth instance court.\n\nToday the issue of human rights has moved towards social protection. The main objectives now are social security, protection of property, freedom of speech (press and other media), etc.\n\nMany organizations for the protection of human rights and liberties act in the territory of Croatia, some of them are:\n\nOESS Central Office\n\nFlorijana Andraceca 14\n\n10 000 Zagreb\n\nPhone: +385 1 3096 620\n\nFax: +385 1 3096 621\n\ne-mail: OSCE-Croatia@osce.org\n\nUNHCR\n\nRepublike Austrije 25\n\n10 000 Zagreb\n\nPhone: +385 1 371 3555\n\nFax: +385 1 371 3587\n\ne-mail: sirovica@unhcr.ch\n\nCroation Helsinki Committee\n\nIlica 15/3\n\nPhone: +385 1 481 2322\n\nFax: +385 1 4481 2324\n\n10 000 Zagreb\n\ne-mail: hho@hho.hr\n\nLegal Education in Croatia\n\nIn Croatia there are four schools of law (faculties of law).

The database is provides documents in HTML format and freely accessible to all.\n\nKOREKTOR – Korektor is a private company that provides laws trough the email. For a fee they will email you the text of the law.\n\nIntellectio Iuris – The Centre for Law research and documentation, Intellectio Iuris provides the largest database on the territory of Croatia bearing the same name Intellectio Iuris. The database is on the Internet since March 15, 2002 and the database is updated twice a month. This is an ever-growing commercial database covering all branches of law. So we could say that this is a group of databases. The information it provides is taken directly from the official sources and is reflected faithfully and objectively. The database contains all of the relevant Croatian legal publications and is not partial to any one publisher. Centre’s library contains all of the literature, and all of the literature is indexed in the database. At the moment, Intellectio Iuris is the only online database in Croatia that covers all types of law. The database contains two categories of entries. The first category of entries is judicial decisions. The second category is made up of monographic scientific papers. At this moment there are over 41,000 entries. 12,00 of these are indexes of monographic works while 29,000 entries cover court practices and opinions of different Ministries, law book revues etc.\n\nThe database contains it’s own search engine using Boolean logic and allowing search in seven fields: “Naslov”-title, “Izvor”-source, “God/br”-year/no., “Autor”-author, “Kljucne rijeci”-keywords, “Grana prava”-branch of law and “Napomena”-notes. These fields could be searched individually or simultaneously. The database contains a built in thesaurus allowing searches in Croatian, Serbian and Slovenian. There are projects in the works that will enable the searches in Macedonian and English language.\n\nCroatia, and all the republics of the former Yugoslavia, have posted their laws on the Internet and made them available free of charge. This is why the Centre found the entry of laws in the database unnecessary. It is important to mention that every judicial decision and every scientific article points out specifically, in the field “Napomena” (notes), to which regulation or law it refers. In the field “Naslov” (title) judicial decision and scientific articles even list which article of law they refer to. Using key terms (keywords), which are abundant for each of the entries, the user can immediately unite both categories of entries for full and complete information on the subject.\n\nIn the scientific works themselves the practice of the courts is often quoted. The database is organized in the manner that if an article quotes any judgments of the courts the user can bring it up by entering title of the article in the search field “Napomena” (notes). This is an authentic and highly valuable feature of the database. This is because the judicial decisions offer objective view of the content of an article, as opposed to excerpts, which may be subjective. In addition this allows for access to the judicial decisions that are not commonly available in official publications of the courts and are only known to the authors of the scientific papers. Often these authors are judges of the highest courts and have passed some of these verdicts themselves.\n\nThrough analysis and systematization of Croatian judicial practice incongruities were discovered. Wherever this was spotted it was carefully entered “suprotna odluka” (opposing decision) in the search field “Napomena” (notes) of each of the entries. As all of the entries are unified by the keyword criteria by entering the corresponding keywords both of the decisions will turn out in the search.\n\nAnother authentic and highly valuable feature of the database is that it contains opinions of law experts on certain judicial decisions. If an expert, in his discussion of a legal problem, confirms the validity of a particular decision it was mark with an exclamation mark ”!” in the field entitled “Napomena” (notes). If the expert questions the validity of a decision in an article he is writing it was mark it in the field entitled “Napomena” (notes) by entering the word “upitno” (questionable).\n\nBesides the commercial portion of the database the web site has a non-commercial pages User collaboration – where authors publish their articles and make them available for non-commercial research and educational purposes. Community oriented, Hot topics are another portion of the site where the Centre for legal research and documentation provides law materials about the current issues of state importance discussed in the media. These materials include expert articles of law professors and academics, different international conventions, laws or court decisions. The materials are in PDF and HTML formats. There is an English version of the web site, which enables foreign users basic navigation through the Site. All of the articles published have English summaries.\n\nThe final goal is to increase the security of legal practice in Croatia, to help Croatian judicial practice and legislation in achieving congruency with European and worldwide standards. Considering that the law systems of all former Yugoslav republics are almost identical, the goal of this database is to provide the information from all of the former republics. The common history of these countries dictates this, and so does the inevitable cooperation between the countries in the future.\n\nSupreme Court of Croatia\n\nCroatia is preparing to join the European Union and as a part of these preparations. The Supreme Court of Croatia developed a project web-site where it publishes it’s own practice. The web site offers a full text search of 67.000 court decision, in HTML format, but only in Croatian. On the same site you can find some expert papers written by the judges of the Supreme Court and links to other Courts in Croatia and ECHR.\n\nConstitutional Court of Croatia\n\nThe Constitutional Court has own database with decisions, rulings and reports (hereinafter: decisions), made since 1 January 2000 and shown on the official web page of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Croatia. They were selected according to several criteria (especially according to number of addressees and according to type of constitutional-court proceedings).\n\nHIDRA – EUROVOC\n\nAs a part of the European integration program HIDRA (Government Information Agency) started translating the European thesaurus EUROVOC.\n\nEnterEurope\n\nEuropean documentation centre of the Institute for International Relations started the EnterEurope project. The goal of this project is to enable easier on-line approach to information on institutions, agencies, bodies, policy and law of the European Union. Project manager is Mrs. Sandra Car, head of the European documentation centre, Institute for international relations.\n\nInformation and Documentation Department\n\nThe Information and Documentation Department is a part of the Parliamentary Staff Service, and it is charged with the indexing and archiving of all acts of Parliament.\n\nThe Department also provides full reference service, which includes responding to requests for articles and information dealing with complex matters of interest to MPs, and utilising a variety of sources such as articles and electronic documentation.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe judiciary system in Croatia is undergoing some radical changes. The law reform will enable some modern improvements in legal practice, and one of these reforms will allow full access to the Internet to all of the of judiciary branch and law faculties. With the advent of these reforms we can expect that the number of web sites and databases providing legal information in vernacular and foreign languages will greatly increase. In the process of European integration Republic of Croatia is obligated to synchronize legal system with laws of European Union using principles of aquis communautaire."
