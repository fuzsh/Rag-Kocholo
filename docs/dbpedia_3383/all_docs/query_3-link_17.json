She also qualified 11th for the all-around final Wednesday and needed a Top 20 finish Friday to earn her 2008 Olympic berth in China.\n\nToronto's Emily Livingstone was the last Canadian Olympian in rhythmic gymnastics in 2000.\n\nAnna Bessonova of Ukraine won the gold medal Friday with 73.950 points.
