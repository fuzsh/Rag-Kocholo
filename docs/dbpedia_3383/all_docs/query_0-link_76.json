        "text": "Thousands of brands at your fingertips\n\n2,500+ Brands organized into over 80 Industry Groups\n\nThe MailCharts Index is a curated collection of brands organized into sought-after industry groups. We created the MailCharts Index to help ecommerce email marketers quickly research and plan email campaigns from strategy to execution.\n\nMailCharts collects emails from 2,500+ of the most popular ecommerce brands — from household names to the newest direct-to-consumer businesses and start-ups.\n\nYou’ll find the brands that matter the most: your competitors and peers, brands you love and brands whose email programs are so good you’ll want to get under the hood to see how they work.\n\nHistorical email data since 2013\n\nSince 2013 we’ve been building a comprehensive database of email messages, but we’re not just an email warehouse.\n\nWe use our extensive email collection to generate deep understanding of marketing calendars, email journeys and promotional cadences of our curated brands. As a MailCharts user, you can take advantage of our research to help you gather detailed industry insights and zoom out into the broader ecommerce world.\n\nHow we curate our brands\n\nMailCharts focuses on growing and refining the MailCharts Index. It’s designed to be a valuable resource for ecommerce email marketers and others looking for data, insights, and trends in all phases of email marketing.\n\nWe’re constantly finding brands through research, discovery, and customer suggestions. We look for brands that are popular, trending, high-growth, or established – or a combination of these criteria.\n\nWe work hard to identify the right brands for our collection:\n\nDiscovery: We scout the ecommerce world looking for the latest and greatest, adding brands that we’ve seen in retail, ecommerce, marketing and email industry news or that we’ve discovered in our own ecommerce travels. If it’s an ecommerce brand that’s doing something interesting, outstanding or innovative with email marketing, we’ll add it to the dataset and begin compiling data.\n\nSuggestions: We listen to our customers and have created a list of the most requested and tracked brands over the past 6 years. These include popular, established, market-leading brands along with DTC, subscription commerce, specialty and gender-specific brands.\n\nTalked about: Brands ranked as top performers on recognized ecommerce industry lists:\n\nInternet Retailer Top 1000\n\nInteractive Advertising Bureau 250\n\n2PM\n\nSailThru 250\n\nWhy doesn’t MailCharts track every brand?\n\nMailCharts doesn’t track every brand, and that is part of our strategy. What we do have is thousands of curated brands that allow ecommerce email marketers to dominate their campaigns using competitive data and intelligence.\n\nWhen you see a brand in the MailCharts Index, you know it meets these criteria:\n\nHand-selected for inclusion\n\nFocused on retail/ecommerce (B2C and DTC)\n\nHas a robust and active email marketing program\n\nIs classified into one of over 80 industry groups covering categories such as Apparel, Footwear, and Travel & Tourism\n\nYou won’t find every brand in the MailCharts Index. But you’ll find the top brands and data you can use right away for your most effective campaign planning and execution. And if you don’t find the exact brands you’re looking for in the Index, you can look to similar brands for data, insights and email creative for competitive research.\n\nWe continually investigate and evaluate brands for inclusion in the MailCharts Index. If you have a retail or ecommerce brand you’d like us to consider, feel free to contact us with the information."
