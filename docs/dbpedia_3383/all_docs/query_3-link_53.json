Well if you think the blog has been created just for itsy bitsy ranting then you are mistaken.\n\nShe will write in couple of blogs. I don’t know whether she herself will write the entries, the way I do..hehe..or some professional writer will do the ghost writing for her.\n\nBoth the blogs are part of marketing and advertising campaigns from Lenovo and CBC. Lenovo, the Chinese giant has asked athletes from around the world to do blogging for them. You may get a look at it at www.summergames.lenovo.com (update: site does not exist anymore).\n\nShe also blogs for CBC."
