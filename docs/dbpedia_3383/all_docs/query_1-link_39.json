        "text": "Inspired by his long career as an educator and artist, Albers began the series Homage to the Square in 1948 while working at Black Mountain College, a radically experimental liberal arts college in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Western North Carolina. Believing that students could only understand artistic form through close observation and repetition of its individual elements, Albers encouraged his students to carefully examine the relationships between and among colors, lines, and other pictorial elements. This practice inspired his own work, resulting in the long-running series of paintings and silkscreens, which he continued after taking over the Department of Design at Yale, and after retiring from teaching in 1958.\n\nFirst published in a portfolio of 12 in 1967, in 1972 Albers included this print in Formulation: Articulation, a series of prints which he felt encapsulated the entirety of his career. Despite his advanced age (he turned 84 in 1972), Albers supervised the printing at Ives-Sillman, which was run by two former students of his and which also printed Interactions of Color, his 1963 distillation of his ideas about color and its study and uses. These works, which the artist and critic Elaine de Kooning said could have come from no other artist, are indicative of his personality, which was both exacting and experimental, systematic and spontaneous.\n\nTaught to make keen observations on her surroundings by her research scientist father, Lynn Aldrich was raised to have an appreciation for science and the natural world. Though she received a BA in English and later an MFA in painting, Aldrich found her calling in the sculptural arts. Inspired by the revolutionary “ready-made” art of Marcel Duchamp, Aldrich’s work focuses on taking common household items and placing them in uncommon environments to be assessed as art. Though the items Aldrich chooses for her art inevitably possess certain connotations in the minds of viewers, Aldrich plays on these preconceived notions to inspire new ways of thinking about objects. Including an ironing board topped with pressed flowers, Pressed for Time invites us to reflect on the function of these objects and how they relate to the interactions between humans and nature.\n\nPart of a generation of artists who came of age during the peak of Abstract Expressionism in the United States, Richard Anuszkiewicz eschewed the painterly, gestural style of that movement while embracing its interest in all-over compositions executed in large scale with bright acrylic paints. He was heavily influenced by his mentor Josef Albers, with whom the studied at Yale University, embracing the older artist’s interest in the relationships between colors, especially when rendered in precise, geometric shapes. Anuszkiewicz took up printmaking in the early 1960s, and like many artists of his generation originally viewed it as a means of reproducing his paintings in smaller and more accessible formats. He quickly realized the possibilities for further color experimentation inherent in lithography and silkscreen, however, and embraced printmaking as a core part of his artistic practice.\n\nThis print, one of a series of Reflections executed in 1979, is the result of a particularly fruitful period of experimentation Anuszkiewicz began in the mid-1970s. Silkscreen—in which pigment is forced through a mesh screen onto paper or other substrate—allowed him to make particularly large prints, especially when printed onto Masonite, a sturdy type of composite wood. Anusckiewicz began printing these works as many as four times, creating thick buildups of color. These objects, with their size and paint-like surfaces, approach the status of painting-print hybrids, creating hard-edged yet luminous surfaces that minimize their own objecthood, instead emphasizing the environmental impact of all that color.\n\nHailing from a working-class family, Milton Avery was the sole breadwinner for his mother and sisters starting at age twenty, working a variety of blue-collar jobs at night, leaving him time to study art during the day. It was only at age forty when he and his wife Sally moved to New York, where Avery was exposed to European and American modernism for the first time, that he devoted himself to his art full time. Sally’s work as an illustrator enabled him to focus on painting, and he developed a unique style that blended French Fauvism, American folk art, and his interest in the luminous possibilities of paint. Out of step with the social realism that dominated in the 1920s and 1930s, Avery’s thinly painted style and careful experimentation with color had a strong influence on Adolph Gottlieb, Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko, and other younger Abstract Expressionist painters whom he befriended in the 1940s.\n\nThis print was made in 1951 while Avery was in summer residence at The Research Studio in Maitland. Too weak to paint due to a recent heart attack, he instead explored the possibilities of monotype, a printmaking method in which ink or other media are applied directly to the printing surface, in this case glass. Using a sponge, he wiped the ink on the surface, creating thinly luminous bands of color that allowed the white of the paper to show through. This practice was hugely influential on his later painting, as he began to use sponges to apply his paint while also simplifying his forms. In this work as in other frequent representations of both birds and the sea, Avery evokes the sense of yearning alienation that he felt was a core aspect of the experience of modern life.\n\nPeggy Bacon, born to artist parents, followed in their footsteps by attending the Art Students League in New York during its heyday, where she studied with George Bellows, John Sloan, and other American realists. Though she trained as a painter, her earliest work was in drypoint, a printmaking medium in which the painter scratches a design directly on a metal plate with a specialized needle. During the 1920s and 1930s she turned to oil pastels, using them to execute a series of caricatures of her contemporaries in the New York art and intellectual worlds. These pastels, which demonstrate her flair for witty exaggeration, brought her a great deal of fame as they were published in The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and other widely read magazines. She was also a prolific illustrator of books.\n\nAfter about 1945, Bacon began to return to painting, working mostly in gouache in the 1940s and 1950s before returning to oils in her last years. Lamentable Lunch is a fine example of her gouache work, which turned from caricature to subtler—though still wittily ironic—portraits of everyday Americans. This painting demonstrates her mastery of the medium, a kind of opaque watercolor, as she uses her sweeping brushstrokes and fine eye for color to show an office worker eating a hurried meal of coffee, donut, and jelly sandwich, seemingly crammed into a café’s coat room. Bacon’s eye for everyday detail and sly sense of humor remained a constant throughout her career.\n\nWith her organic, carefully orchestrated sculptures, Rina Banerjee reveals a migration of ideas and cultural symbols. She interrogates historic objects— where they come from and the stories they can tell—in her distinctive works. In conceiving this work, the artist focused on domestic slavery. A Victorian birdcage, shaped like a large home, forms a central part of the composition. Birdcages reoccur across Bannerjee's diverse works. Here, the cage remains open, giving a sense of flight; the captive has fled bondage. Various meanings are assigned to objects by their creators and their owners. Banerjee ponders the value of goods and their perceived worth. Here, the prominent orange feathers were purchased from a website promising “authentic Asian goods,” while the large and whimsical gourds were grown locally in Florida and purchased on the land where they were harvested. In this work, Banerjee navigates the tension between the local and the global, and the notion of authenticity is explored and deconstructed. While the artist is interested in the movement of goods and people, her sculptures, like this one, testify to a migration of ideas as well. This work in particular is significant in her oeuvre not only for the ideas it imparts, but for its noteworthy presentations.\n\nLeonard Baskin was in many ways a man out of step with his times. Raised in a religious Jewish household in New Jersey and Brooklyn, Baskin was possessed throughout his career with a sense of the potential for apocalyptic doom latent in the human condition. Though he first came to prominence during the time of Abstract Expressionism, when artists eschewed the figurative and embraced new techniques and synthetic media, Baskin was a resolute traditionalist. Unlike many artists of his generation, he trained in Europe as a sculptor and printmaker, and preferred working with ancient materials like wood, copper, and ink over the bright acrylics embraced by his contemporaries.\n\nIn his drawings and prints Baskin often created grotesque human and human-animal hybrids, often diseased or in states of decay, a reflection of his preoccupation with the potential in humanity for moral decay. This ink drawing depicts a massive, distended rat, the dark washes of ink bleeding over the sketchily outlined form. The blackness overwhelms the tiny head, blotting out the creature’s eyes and blurring the line between life and death. Moving away from the head, the ink smears first to gray and then to white, which stands out against the creamy beige of the paper. This transition from black to white suggests something of a Manichean struggle between light and darkness, good and evil.\n\nInternationally-renowned American artist, Jean-Michel Basquiat, defined his career through his works in painting and print. He often drew inspiration from his personal Puerto Rican and Haitian heritage. At the age of eight, Basquiat was hit by a car and suffered from several broken bones and internal injuries. While he was healing, his mother gave him the medical textbook Gray’s Anatomy. This period of trauma and recovery had a lasting effect on the artist, and the anatomical drawings found within the textbook served as early references for Basquiat’s later works. This work builds on that influence while it simultaneously recalls Leonardo da Vinci’s human anatomy studies. Basquiat’s work is often associated with the Neo-Expressionism art movement, in which the importance of the human figure was reasserted into the canon of contemporary art with a focus on emotion and subjectivity.\n\nRead the Virtual Lavender Label for this work.\n\nGustave Baumann immigrated to Chicago with his family when he was ten. The oldest of four children, he was forced to assume financial responsibility while still a teenager after his father abandoned Baumann, his mother, and siblings. He quickly found work in a variety of Chicago engraving shops, showing a facility for printmaking that led him to a successful career as a commercial illustrator with a particular specialty in package design. The year 1904 was a particularly auspicious one for Baumann, as he became a United States Citizen, using his newfound passport to travel back to Europe—specifically Munich—to study. In Germany, he immersed himself in the Jugendstil and Vienna Secession outgrowths of the Art Nouveau style he already favored, as well as further studying the Japanese wood block printing technique known as ukiyo-e.\n\nUpon his return to the United States, Baumann resumed his career as a commercial artist while also setting aside time for artistic printmaking. He eventually relocated to Brown County, Indiana, some 230 miles south of Chicago and the site of an art colony surrounding the Hoosier School painter T.C. Steele. In 1918, after a year or so bouncing around New York State, Baumann visited New Mexico, making stops first in Taos and then Santa Fe, where he visited an exhibition of his prints. He ended up staying for the rest of his long life, becoming a fixture of the Santa Fe art scene while producing brightly colorful wood block prints of the stunning countryside of the Southwest.\n\nBaumann based his prints on preparatory drawings and egg tempera sketches which he made on-site. Returning to his studio (which he called his workshop), he carefully carved a block of basswood—also known as linden—for each color in the finished composition, being careful that each block lined up precisely with the others to avoid blurring the final print. He worked with the same old-fashioned hand press—purchased in 1917—for his entire career. A perfectionist, he experimented with a variety of papers and inks, continually refining the mixtures of pigments, solvents, and fixatives in order to ensure durability, evenness, and luminosity of color. He also printed from dark to light—the reverse of the usual process—allowing him more subtle layering effects but vastly increasing the difficulty of ensuring everything lined up properly. As a result of his exacting nature, Baumann’s wood blocks were so carefully carved that they were often exhibited alongside the finished prints. His daughter, Ann, has maintained this tradition by ensuring that the blocks—as well as progressive proofs demonstrating their use—remain together in museum collections around the country.\n\nThis print depicts the Pecos River, which originates in Northwest New Mexico and flows south through West Texas, eventually emptying into the Rio Grande. In Baumann’s time the area was sometimes referred to as the American Tyrol, after the Alpine region of Italy and Austria. Baumann represents a lush mountainside dotted with the buildings of a small town, or perhaps a ranch. His use of a rich golden yellow—indicated as buff in a note on the tempera drawing—gives the scene a bright, luminous quality that contrasts with the darker tones of the trees, sky, and distant mountains.\n\nRomare Bearden experienced the Great Migration—the decades-long movement of African Americans from the Jim Crow South to Northern cities—at a young age, when he moved with his parents from Charlotte, North Carolina to Harlem in New York City. During his childhood he spent time in Pittsburgh and the suburbs of Baltimore, two additional centers of Black life, but otherwise was a lifelong New Yorker. Nonetheless, he made frequent visits to Charlotte and other areas of the South to visit family, and the Black culture of the South informs much of his artistic production.\n\nBearden’s best known works blend Cubist collage practices with imagery taken from African and African Diaspora art and culture, and his collages and related works frequently feature conjur (Bearden’s preferred spelling) women, privileged members of the community who used African magical and ritual techniques passed down through the generation. For Bearden, conjur women symbolized and called forth a cultural space uninflected by racism, segregation, and other forms of prejudice. This lithograph, which draws much of its imagery from a collage and silkscreen of the same name, calls forth that tradition while also celebrating the beauty and fecundity of the South.\n\nRomare Bearden was a successful member of the New York art world from the 1930s to the early 1960s, when he first adopted the collage aesthetic for which he is known today. Early in his career he worked in a figurative style influenced by Mexican Muralism before moving towards abstraction during the heyday of Abstract Expressionism. He always felt a tension between his intense interest in the history of art and his desire to make work that was politically and socially relevant to his experience as an African American living in the United States. Inspired by the Civil Rights Movement, he began to experiment with collage, which proved to be the perfect medium to unite these two interests. Collage was important to Cubism and Dada, two avant-garde movements with explicitly social consciences, and it gave him a new vocabulary with which to depict both the joyous and sorrowful elements of the Black experience in the United States.\n\nThese lithographs, published in 1971 as part of a collaboration with Shorewood Publishers in New York, are all based on foundational collage works shown at his 1971 Museum of Modern Art exhibition. As with most of his printmaking practice, Bearden worked closely with Shorewood’s master printmaker, first using transfer paper to put the image onto a metal lithography plate, then putting in color and details by hand. After printing, he carefully reviewed each proof, returning to Shorewood to make changes until he was satisfied with the finished product. The result was a print that retained some of the handmade qualities and imagery of the collages while also standing alone as an original work of art. The name of the portfolio—Ritual Bayou—thus indicates the centrality of both African American cultural life and the process of iteration in Bearden’s work.\n\nIn 1914, the young Romare Howard Bearden and his family emigrated from his native Charlotte, North Carolina to Harlem, New York during the movement known as the Great Migration. Living within the atmosphere of the culturally vibrant Harlem Renaissance, Bearden began creating art as an outlet for the expression of Black life. Though his career as an artist and activist thrived in New York, he reminisced on his childhood in the South, contemplating the relationship he and other Black people had with that context. Part of the series Ritual Bayou, Memories conveys the artist’s deep appreciation towards the North Carolinian landscape and its people. Using a collection of found images of birds, plants, and other natural symbols, Bearden incorporates the image of a female figure amongst the lush scenery. The combination of both human and natural elements conjures Bearden’s memories of life in the South.\n\nThe child of Hungarian immigrants, Rosemarie grew up studying music, theater, and art history, majoring in the latter at Oberlin College. Except for a year spent at New York University’s Institute of Fine Arts, she did not study painting formally. A summer spent in Woodstock, New York just after her marriage brought her into contact with Bradley Walker Tomlin and Philip Guston, two of the rising generation of painters that would become known as the Abstract Expressionists. Under their tutelage—including a summer spent working in the Woodstock studio of Robert Motherwell—Beck developed her own Abstract Expressionist style based on the careful application of small lozenges of deep, luminous color. These works soon earned her acclaim as one of the notable figures in the second generation of the movement, including favorable reviews in both the artistic and mainstream presses.\n\nBeck, however, could not shake the feeling that she was a figurative painter at heart, and she renounced her former abstraction at the end of the 1950s, embarking on a series of works indebted to Ovid, Shakespeare, and other canonical literary figures. She began to create groups of closely related works on these subjects while retaining her careful yet painterly style. Around the same time, she began a long career as a teacher, advocating tirelessly for the vitality of figurative art during a time when the art world was preoccupied with abstract and conceptual modes. The subject of Phaedra preoccupied her last years, in particular after her diagnosis with an inoperable brain tumor ended her teaching career. The story—of a woman who tragically and disastrously falls in love with her stepson before dying by suicide—seems to have allowed Beck to work through images of death as she herself lived out her last months.\n\nFrom his early street photography made in Harlem, New York City, to his iconic portraits of high-school students, Dawoud Bey creates emotive pictures of humanity. Bey’s pictures inspect and reflect upon the notion of place, which is a central thread in the Birmingham Project, of which the work here is a part. On the morning of September 15, 1963, four African American girls were killed when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Later that same day, two African American boys were killed in separate incidents as a result of racial violence. To recognize these horrific tragedies on their 50th anniversary, Bey created a series of diptychs of residents of the city. He identified young people who were the ages of the victims and then found adults who were approximately the ages those victims would have been if they had lived. He juxtaposes the adults and youth in black-and-white photographs taken in the Bethel Baptist Church in the city's Collegeville neighborhood, chosen for its role in the Civil Rights Movement, and in the Birmingham Museum of Art. The subjects here, as they do across the entire series, look directly at the viewer, an exchange of gaze that heightens the emotional intensity of the work. Though photographed separately, they are paired together through their individual yet parallel poses. Separated across generations, they are united in their resilience and recognition of the terror and tragedy of September 15, 1963.\n\nBorn in Brookline, Massachusetts, Nathan Budoff has lived in Puerto Rico for more than 25 years; the social and political context of the island as well as its environment have informed his practice. His recent body of work focuses on the Puerto Rican urban landscape and issues of dislocation and environmental deterioration.\n\nIn this painting, Budoff explores the contrasts between the urban and the natural environments. Against a light blue sky, an unrealistically large octopus and a squid hover over several iconic buildings in Santurce, Puerto Rico. The juxtaposition of impossible elements functions here as a metaphor for the imbalance in the man vs. nature relationship and its lasting impact. Budoff articulates a nuanced critique of the treatment of the environment in these tropical vistas; he invites us to imagine a world in which animals, however big or small in real life, take over our spaces: “I really wanted to bring forward the idea that other creatures live here with us, live all around us, and works like Cosmic Love are based on that conceit—what if our cities were really home to more than people and their dependents?”\n\nAlexander Calder is one of the most highly regarded artists of the twentieth century, revered for his playful and whimsical adaptation of the forms and intellectual commitments of modernism. Trained as an engineer, Calder became interested in art, briefly studying at the Art Students League before decamping to Paris, where he became famous for his whimsical Cirque Calder (Whitney Museum of American Art), constructed out of wire, fabric, bits of cork, and other found objects. This led to his development of a series of wire sculptures, an early indication of his abiding interest in negative space. Shocked by a visit to the studio of Piet Mondrian into an embrace of abstraction, Calder would invent the motorized wire sculptures that fellow artist Marcel Duchamp would christen mobiles in 1931. Calder and his wife Louisa moved back to the United States in 1933, settling in Roxbury, Connecticut, where the wide open spaces of the surrounding countryside inspired him to work in ever-larger scales, further exploring the relationships between and among form, light, color, and space.\n\nCalder rocketed to international superstardom after the end of World War II, and spent the following productive decades continuing to produce sculptures at all scales. He also worked prolifically in gouache, an opaque version of watercolor that allows the artist the quick freedom and re-wetting ability of watercolor while being easier to control. These gouaches—aggressively marketed in particular by his Paris dealer, Aimé Maeght—also proved exceptionally popular in the 1960s, particularly among middle-class consumers who could not necessarily afford or house one of his sculptures. Calder, whose commitment to the democratization of modernist abstraction and leftist politics have sometimes gone underremarked, seized on this opportunity, commissioning a number of lithographs based on the gouaches and aimed at an even more widespread audience. This is one such object, showing Calder’s mastery of the relationship between positive and negative spaces.\n\nCalder’s interest in the democratization of modernism stemmed from his political commitments, which included a staunch antiwar orientation (he was an outspoken supporter of the Spanish Republic during the 1930s) as well as a lifelong interest in humanitarian causes. In 1972 an earthquake demolished the Nicaraguan capital city of Managua, killing and wounding thousands and leaving many more homeless. Calder was one of many international celebrities who contributed to relief efforts (another was Puerto Rican baseball star Roberto Clemente, who died in a plane crash on his way to the country). He commissioned Guatemalan artisans to create tapestries based on his gouaches out of maguey, an indigenous fiber made out of a species of agave plant. These he sold to help fund relief efforts.\n\nThe tapestries highlight another aspect of Calder’s career that is sometimes under-studied, which is his longstanding interest in a wide variety of practical and decorative arts. He frequently created functional objects—including pitchers, ashtrays, and other tableware—for his home, and fashioned rattles and other toys for his children. He also collaborated with Braniff International Airways to decorate several of their DC-8 aircraft, as well as jewelry and textiles. These broad interests have led some art historians to view him with suspicion, concerned that he was undermining the intellectual seriousness of his work (and modernism more broadly) with these works. Calder, long known as a jocular and playful man, was unconcerned, preferring to spread his work to as wide an audience as he could. That flexibility also extended to the materials in which the works were executed, as he accepted the imperfect translations necessitated by the traditional weaving process in this and other maguey fiber works.\n\nLuis Camnitzer is a provocative thinker and artist. He makes work in myriad forms, choosing the format that he believes achieves his message or intent in the most direct manner. Like other conceptual artists, Camnitzer embraces the idea over the material manifestation of his creative practice.\n\nTimelanguage derives from a body of work that includes rigorous consideration of the notion of time. The series of prints begins and ends with blank pages. The made up, composite term “timelanguage” unfolds across the successive prints, which evolve from a light gray to a final black image. Since the end and the beginning are a different color, but similar in composition, cyclical time as well as linear time become paramount here. Moreover, time is ephemeral and elusive. While modern society may feel governed by time, encapsulating the notion of time as a single entity remains a perplexing task.\n\nClarence Holbrook Carter demonstrated facility with the difficult medium of watercolor early in his life, a talent which led him to study at the Cleveland School of Art before embarking for Italy to study with Hans Hofmann in 1927. Upon his return Carter taught, first in Cleveland and then in a variety of other cities including Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, and Atlanta. His early paintings were generally of the hard-edged realist style of American Scene painters like Edward Hopper. In the 1940s his work began to incorporate strange, incongruous elements, a shift that led to his inclusion in the Museum of Modern Art’s American Realists and Magic Realists exhibition in 1943. Later in his career—particularly after around 1970—he began to work in a Surrealist mode, creating empty, preternaturally still spaces populated only with one or more egglike, ovoid shapes.\n\nThese two silkscreens date from that era in his work. For Carter, the ovoid shapes came to stand in for a variety of contradictory elements of the human condition, such as life and death; mortality and immortality; the discrete self versus the expansive consciousness; and certainty versus mystery. Balancing Act, this work’s enigmatic title, alludes to the relationship between the two eggs, the larger of which seems to balance—or not—precariously on the edge of the other. The single eye disrupts the picture’s symmetry, staring out from the larger egg while also luring the viewer in and opening the possibility of an inner depth.\n\nBorn in Italy and working in New York City, William Castellana is both a commercial and fine-art photographer. He primarily works in still-life, a practice which has helped him to develop a keen eye for composition and lighting. These photographs, part of a series called South Williamsburg, represent something of a departure for Castellana, who took to the street to document his Brooklyn neighborhood. South Williamsburg is renowned for its high concentration of observant Jews, in particular the Hasidic group known as the Satmars. South Williamsburg also is home to a large secular population, with the two groups generally sticking to opposite sides of the appropriately named Division Avenue. In making the series Castellana was inspired by Henri Cartier-Bresson and other street photographers, forfeiting his usual careful control for a freer and more spontaneous approach.\n\nHe captured his images in black-and-white using a digital camera. The seeming paradox of using a modern technology to make old-looking images is a nod to the way in which the Orthodox residents of South Williamsburg undoubtedly live in the modern world while also holding beliefs and traditions apart from it. Residents of the neighborhood speak on cell phones, follow the directions of streetlights, and otherwise exist in contemporary Brooklyn. At the same time, they sport haircuts and garb that points to their status as deliberate outsiders. Castellana himself is an outsider in this milieu, and as such he is limited to the public aspects of Hasidic culture in Brooklyn. This distance limits his view but also perhaps sharpens it, allowing him to focus on the most visually striking images without an insider’s cultural baggage.\n\nElizabeth Catlett was known for sculptures that reflected both African American and Mexican identities. Catlett’s influences include the works of the Harlem and Chicago Renaissances, as well as modern and African art. Naima exemplifies the artist’s balance between the figurative and the abstract, potentially stemming from the influence of her mentor, modernist sculptor Ossip Zadkine (1888–1967). Catlett challenged Zadkine’s abstraction with her background in African art, blending her knowledge of the two to convey the essence of the subject without extraneous detail, but also without losing accessibility, as she created art to be consumed by everyday African American people. In keeping with this, she rejected the idea of the modernist “international figure,” instead creating a form that elicits sympathy from her viewers. Naima was inspired by her own granddaughter, Naima Mora, after she visited Catlett’s home in Mexico to study Spanish. Naima’s elongated profile fits within Catlett’s existing work, which draws from the cultural significance of the head in African art. In Yoruba figure sculpture, the head is the most vital part of a person. It is regarded as the epicenter of one’s individuality, sensory experience, nourishment, and wisdom. Just as Catlett wishes to portray the essence of her granddaughter, the head portrays the essence of human personality and the source of life in Yoruban culture, not only in the present, but also for the future.\n\nNick Cave’s work is characterized by community participation and celebration. Born in Fulton, Missouri, the artist creates pieces in which sculpture, performance, and dance converge. His “soundsuits” consist of elaborate costumes that cover the entire body concealing the wearer’s identity, gender, race, and age. The suits incorporate sequins, raffia, fabric, buttons, and other common materials, evoking diverse traditions and cultural practices. Together with dancers, choreographers, and community members, Cave orchestrates performances in public spaces where passersby are encouraged to join in and participate. The artist created the first soundsuit in 1992 in response to the beating of Rodney King, an African American man, by California police officers. This incident of police brutality led Cave to reflect on his own identity as a Black man and the vulnerability that presents in contemporary society. In this piece the suits are activated by movement and sound, creating a powerful visual that celebrates freedom and community. In the artist’s own words: “I felt like my identity and who I was as a human being was up for question. I felt like that could have been me. Once that incident occurred, I was existing very differently in the world. So many things were going through my head: How do I exist in a place that sees me as a threat?”\n\nRead the Virtual Lavender Label for this work.\n\nThe Hopi snake dance is a sacred ritual performed for centuries by Hopi men every August after days of preparation. It is a way to give thanks and to ask the spirits for good fortune. Created by French artist Jean Charlot, this image depicts a moment in the ritual when a dancer holds a snake in his mouth while the figure on the right calms the animal with a feather stick. In the 1940s and early ‘50s, the Hopi Reservation in Northeastern Arizona became a destination for travelers who were curious about the ritual, among them President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Eventually, the celebration of the ritual was closed to the public.\n\nCharlot was born in France and moved to Mexico with his mother after his father’s passing in 1921. There, in the context of his maternal ancestors, the young artist flourished, playing a key role in the Mexican muralist movement of the 1920s. Eventually he moved to the U.S. where he worked as an educator, artist, and writer. This work is part of a series that depicts the Hopi Snake Dance mural Charlot created at Arizona State University where he taught summer courses. In 1949 the artist moved to Hawaii where he taught at the University of Hawaii at Manoa for almost two decades.\n\nInfluenced by the indigenous art and culture of Mexico, Jean Charlot represents in this image a tender moment between mother and child. Departing from the conventions of Western depictions of the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus, Charlot reimagines the religious figures as a dark-skinned woman and small child. The composition is divided into two vertical registers creating a stark contrast between light and dark. On the left, the Madonna is depicted in profile while holding her son, both with eyes closed in an intimate scene that conveys warmth and care. The light veil over her head occupies most of the right side of the image leaving no room for background or contextual elements inviting viewers to focus on the faces of the figures and what they represent.\n\nCharlot lived in Mexico during the 1920s where he worked as an artist and educator. He had an important role in Mexican modernism and in the muralist movement, first as an assistant to Diego Rivera and eventually as a muralist painter himself receiving numerous commissions for public buildings. Charlot created this image while working as an art professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The impact of Mexican art and folklore on the artist’s stylistic and thematic choices is evident throughout his career.\n\nBorn and raised in the Soviet Union, Zoya Cherkassky moved to Israel when she was fifteen years old. Memories of her youth and of the landscape in which she grew up often inform her artistic practice. In this work, Cherkassky creates a strong visual statement denouncing the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. A weary mother and small child hold each other tight as they witness Russian tanks rolling through the city of Kiev as the buildings in the background go up in flames. The scene captures the immediate threat to life and the destruction of the Ukrainian capital. In a public statement published shortly after the invasion began, Cherkassky reflected, “Most of the images from my project 'Soviet Childhood' are based on Kiev landscapes. Today I see all of them being bombed and burned by the Russians.” The artist created a limited edition of this print as a fundraiser for Ukraine relief, donating parts of the proceeds to the International Committee of the Red Cross to help mothers and families keep their children safe.\n\nOne of the twentieth century’s most singular artists, Joseph Cornell developed a highly personal aesthetic and metaphysical vocabulary that was informed by his travels around New York City, his Christian Science faith, his encounters with Surrealism and other avant-garde art, and his interest in nature, time, astronomy, and a number of other subjects. A careful and at times obsessive collector, Cornell spent his entire life gathering materials in New York’s junk shops, categorizing them by subject matter in the voluminous files he kept in his Queens home. Over the course of his long and productive career Cornell produced dozens of collages and assemblages—the latter of which are frequently known as Cornell Boxes—out of these files, as well as several films.\n\nThis work, dating from near the end of his life, was created to benefit the charity Phoenix House, a nationwide drug treatment and prevention organization that primarily focused on treating children, adolescents, and families. Cornell—a lifelong lover of children—was moved to help the organization after he met a pair of teenaged addicts. Heliography is an early form of photographic printing, and its use reflects Cornell’s interest in Victorian motifs and technologies. The print’s combination of circles reflects his interest in both astronomy and time, the latter of which is also conjured by the reproduction of the iconic Big Ben. The title, Untitled (Derby Hat) is not clearly referenced anywhere in the print, contributing to its haunting, dreamlike qualities, which are further emphasized by the almost haphazard way in which the various elements seem to be joined together.\n\nThe first time Imogen Cunningham photographed the transcendental painter Morris Graves was in 1950 on the grounds of his private retreat outside Seattle. An introspective portrait study of Graves who as a conscientious-objector had refused to enter the military during World War II resulted in his imprisonment, Cunningham’s photograph is considered a classic portrait. The photographer commented about the image, “Many people think it’s the only portrait I’ve made. You know, he’s never said whether he like it or not.”\n\nNearly twenty years later, in 1969, Cunningham sought out the reclusive Graves to include him in her venture After Ninety, a project about old age. He turned her down. She was persistent and several years later, in 1973, he agreed to have her photograph him, musing, “How can anyone refuse a 90-year old like Imogen anything?” Cunningham was 90 and Graves 63.\n\nAs a college student, Imogen studied chemistry and worked in the botany department of the University of Washington. She became interested in photography in 1905 working with a 4 x 5 camera ordered through a mail-order correspondence school. Gertrude Käsebier’s 1907 article published in The Craftsman inspired her. Cunningham worked in the Seattle studio of Edward S. Curtis, a chronicler of Amerindians, for two years beginning in 1907, learning the fine points of platinum printing and retouching of negatives. Following a fellowship to Dresden, Germany where she studied with a photo chemist, viewed the International Photographic Exhibition and artwork at museums, she opened a portrait studio in 1910 upon her return to Seattle.\n\nThroughout her career that spanned 70 years Cunningham featured portraiture and images of the body including nudes, however she is most well known for the photographs emanating from her affiliation with the California formalists group F/64 that included photographers Edward Weston and Ansel Adams. The name derived from the f-stop on the camera that provided the sharpest focus and depth of field. Inspired by these associations Cunningham developed her early style—close-ups photographs of industrial complexes, botanical plants and flowers—calla lilies and magnolias blossoms. Ten of these photographic studies debuted in the exhibition Film und Foto featuring works by American and European artists held in Stuttgart, Germany in 1929.\n\nFor Carlos Dávila Rinaldi, airports are rich environments that stimulate his creativity: “People in a hurry, others lost looking for their gate or just learning of a delay, the all familiar airport scene where some of us begin to taste the rush of traveling to a familiar place or perhaps somewhere you’ve never been. Airports are my kind of habitat...sensory overload at its fullest.”\n\nBold, gestural markings across the surface of this work suggest the sights, sounds, and movement of passengers through a terminal. Thick, black lines, patches of bright yellow, and red evoke the fast-paced nature of this environment. Like catching a glimpse of a suitcase rolling by or the colorful pattern of a passenger’s clothing, each area of the painting conveys the intense and chaotic experience of the airport. In smaller light blue, lavender, white and gray sections of the work, the artist seems to capture details of objects around him, those perhaps perceived while glancing around the gate and taking it all in. Here, Dávila Rinaldi dissects his experience of travel and transforms it into an equally intense and fragmentary visual. His expressive abstract style is informed by tachism, a mid-twentieth century artistic style characterized by spontaneously applied patches of color and the emphasis on the artist’s feelings and individual experience.\n\nGene Davis worked as a sports reporter and writing copy for the American Automobile Association before he decided to become a full-time painter. When he did, Abstract Expressionism was ascendant, and he joined the general trend for deeply personal, painterly abstractions. Like other members of what would become known as the Washington Color School, however, he soon began to tire of expressionism, instead beginning to evolve a cool, hard-edged style that embraced the line as its primary formal element. This shift brought him nearly instant recognition, as the influential critic Clement Greenberg included him in his landmark 1964 exhibition Post Painterly Abstraction. This success was followed by his inclusion in Washington Color Painters in 1965, alongside Kenneth Noland, Morris Louis, and other local abstractionists. Unlike these figures—Noland in particular—Davis always retained a less cerebral, more playful style, and he was a fixture as a teacher as well as in Washington cultural society.\n\nDavis’s color sense was honed among Washington’s idiosyncratic Phillips Collection, where he gravitated in particular to the Impressionists as well as the work of Swiss modernist Paul Klee. He advised viewers to approach his works by singling out one of the colors, allowing their eye to travel from one instance of it to another. This sliding across the canvas—across what he termed its intervals—creates a sense of kaleidoscopic motion that is almost cinematic in its intensity. His invocation of the interval also points to his love of music, which he enjoyed for its analytic and mathematical precision as well as its expressive potential. Though he claimed to dislike romantic subject matter, preferring Steve Reich to Beethoven, for example, he also insisted upon the presence of a romantic component in his own work. The title of this work, Sonata, particularly reveals his musical bent. The irregular lines run vertically along the sheet, creating a shimmering visual counterpart to the repeated variations that form a musical composition.\n\nThe Aztec calendar, toys, catholic figurines, mirrors, chains, plastic, glass, paper, glitter—this piece by Einar and Jamex de la Torre titled Organ Exchange contains as many materials as layers of meaning. Acquired for the museum’s permanent collection in 2019, on the occasion of their exhibition De La Torre Brothers: Rococolab, it brings together the world of kitsch and fine art. The carefully arranged conglomerate of objects and textures is emblematic of the De La Torre brothers’ unique aesthetic: contradictory, nuanced, bold, and, as they call it, maximalist. Einar and Jamex were born in Guadalajara, Mexico in 1963 and 1960 respectively. They moved to the U.S. at a young age and attended school in California, where eventually they studied art and discovered their passion for glassmaking. Currently, the artists live and work on both sides of the US-Mexico border with homes and studios in Ensenada and San Diego. Attuned to their experiences and surroundings, their artistic vision is informed by their experiences as Border artists whose identity is neither exclusively Mexican nor American, but instead enriched by both. The complexities of identity are at the core of the brothers’ creations; symbolism, history and humor are often the avenues they employ to examine them. In Organ Exchange the De La Torre Brothers examine the personal in the context of history and its collective implications.\n\nOrgan Exchange was inspired by the De La Torre Brothers’ experience with organ donation in 2001. After it was determined that a close relative needed a kidney transplant, the brothers were tested to find a match. The process led the artist-duo to create this work as a reflection on the value of the human body versus the value of its parts. The format evokes that of an Aztec calendar with a face in the center and the words “eat me” painted over the eyes. As we stand to observe the piece, our reflection is captured by several convex mirrors making us part of the work. Like cultural critics, Einar and Jamex oscillate between the personal and the political, the contemporary and the ancient, pointing out the irony of the new and the persistence of history. In their words: “Our art making process is sort of a laboratory where new compounds and hybrids are derived from vernacular cultural symbols.”\n\nJim Dine first achieved recognition as part of the avant-garde Downtown scene in New York, experimenting with painting while also authoring and participating in Happenings at Judson Gallery and other artist-initiated, alternative art spaces in the Greenwich and East Village neighborhoods of Manhattan. Feeling out of place in the increasingly formalist and abstract avant-garde during the 1960s heyday of Minimalism, Dine moved, first to London—where he studied the work of Old Masters and temporarily abandoned painting in favor of drawing—and then to rural Vermont. During the 1970s he focused in particular on his printmaking, working in a variety of different print media, including lithography, etching, aquatint, woodcut, and a number of combinations thereof. Frequently working with master printmakers on both sides of the Atlantic, Dine began to push the limits of the medium, using not only traditional printmaker’s tools but also innovative ones, including power tools he purchased at hardware stores.\n\nThis print, which is notably large for an etching, highlights several of the features of Dine’s prolific printmaking practice. The image of the bathrobe reoccurs in his work from the 1960s to the 1990s, along with images of tools and other everyday objects. These repetitions caused Dine to be lumped in with the Pop Art movement, a connection he strenuously denies. Instead of the hard, shiny artifice of Pop, Dine sees these images as deeply personal, akin to self-portraits through the objects he holds close. Like many of his other prints, Dine released this one in a very small edition, in this case only 17. He frequently painted or otherwise altered individual prints, making them more like monoprints or even paintings than traditional examples of the medium.\n\nThis print is the first in a series of twenty-five portraits of Dine’s wife Nancy, executed in collaboration with the legendary Parisian master printmaker Aldo Commelynck, who worked with Pablo Picasso among other artists. Dine describes Commelynck as one of his best friends in the world, and their collaboration resulted in a moving multifaceted portrait of Nancy Dine. Dine’s printmaking of the mid-1970s to the early 1980s was heavily invested in portraiture, especially of Nancy and himself, as well as a sharp linearity that contrasts with the voluptuous Expressionism of both earlier and later works on paper. The tangled tousle of Nancy’s hair, in which the artist seems to have rendered each individual strand, is reminiscent of his earlier studies of human hair, while the smudges of pigment that help delineate the contours of her face seem almost like Dine’s handprints on the plate.\n\nAs he developed the Nancy Outside series, which he referred to as his “etching symphony” Dine continually returned to this first image, reworking and repurposing the same plate as he continued to experiment with the technical limits of the printmaking medium. His desire to push etching as far as it could go was inspired by his love of German Expressionists, who similarly explored the possibilities of print.\n\nMark di Suvero is best known for his monumentally scaled sculptures, which he first started making out of wood and other detritus found on the streets of post-industrial New York in the 1960s. After a construction accident left his legs paralyzed, he began to experiment with steel I-beams and other raw industrial materials, learning to use cranes and other heavy equipment in order to bend the massive components into their whimsical final forms. Di Suvero has long been interested in the concept of play, and frequently incorporates kinetic elements designed to attract viewers—including children—to engage with his work on a tactile as well as an intellectual level.\n\nThis sculpture, though much smaller in scale—di Suvero maintains that all of his work is human scale, reserving the term monumental for mountains and other geological formations—engages with the same themes. Part of a series of puzzles executed in collaboration with the legendary Gemini Graphic Editions Limited artist’s workshop and print studio in Los Angeles, Moon Dog reflects di Suvero’s interest in aluminum, titanium, and other “space age” materials during the 1980s. Created out of jigsaw-like interlocking pieces reminiscent of Chinese characters (di Suvero grew up in China), it can be arranged in a number of ways, including the vertical configuration shown in this photograph, which creates an interplay between right angles and smooth curves. Di Suvero—whose work is always abstract—chose the name while examining the piece under full moonlight, which must have emphasized its shimmering, luminous quality.\n\nEmory Douglas, who moved to San Francisco when he was eight, grew up in the segregated neighborhood of the Fillmore, where, like many African Americans of his generation, he was a frequent target of police harassment. At the age of twenty-one he enrolled in graphic design classes at City College in the city, and soon fell into the orbit of the playwright Amiri Baraka, who was undertaking a two-month artists’ residency at San Francisco State. Douglas designed sets for the writer, who introduced him to the crowd at the Black House, a cultural center at which he was staying during the residency. These residents included the actor and activist Danny Glover, as well as Eldridge Cleaver, who would become one of the founders of the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense, along with Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, who were frequent visitors to the Black House.\n\nDouglas participated in several of the early Black Panther Party actions, including a 1967 armed demonstration at the California State House in Sacramento, after which he and most of the other Panthers were arrested. In aftermath of that event, as well as the murder of an unarmed teenager named Denzil Dowell by police in the East Bay city of North Richmond, the Panthers began to publish The Black Panther, a weekly underground newspaper which would come to have a circulation of over 100,000. Douglas soon took charge of the newspaper’s design and layout, and was named the BPP’s Minister of Culture, holding both roles until the early 1980s. At The Black Panther he adopted a style that blended the aesthetics of commercial art with leftist propaganda posters from Vietnam, Cuba, and the Middle East, using the newspaper and posters like these—based on images from the paper’s back page—to spread the BPP’s revolutionary message of Black self-reliance and self-defense.\n\nJess T. Dugan is a photographer whose work largely focuses on members of the LGBTQ+ community. Betsy is a part of Dugan’s ongoing series Every Breath We Drew, which they started in 2011. In this series, Dugan depicts people with a variety of gender identities and sexual orientations, challenging the viewer to reflect on their own conceptions of identity. By revealing only the first name of the subjects and taking the pictures in personal spaces, such as their homes, Dugan encourages the viewer to connect with the subject(s) and look beyond their LGBTQ+ identity, seeing them as simply human. In many of their photographsthe sitter gazes directly at the viewer. When you gaze back at Betsy, who do you see?\n\nAlan Feltus earned an MFA in painting from Yale University in 1968, during a time when abstraction dominated at the school, and Minimalism and Conceptual Art dominated the broader art world. Declining to follow those trends, Feltus instead developed a highly personal figurative style, one which won him the coveted Rome Prize in 1970. During his two years in Rome he engaged in deep study of classical and Renaissance art, drawing considerable influence from both ancient sculptures and Old Master paintings. Rather than working from models, as is common for figurative painters, Feltus works from photographs of artworks, combining features from various works into a single, rigorously composed whole.\n\nThis painting is representative of Feltus’s work since 1987, when he moved to Assisi in Italy. The enigmatic figure’s head is heavily influenced by Renaissance painting, perhaps Piero della Francesco, one of Feltus’s favorite touchstones. Dressed in indistinctly modern clothing, the androgynous figure is posed against a landscape and framed by an abstract square that evokes both the halos common in early quattrocento art and the architectural frescoes of the period. The rigid stillness of the scene, the figure’s questioning eyes and tilted head, and the small card which they seem to pass to their left combine to create an air of mystery.\n\nBorn in Washington D.C., Alan Feltus is known for his figurative works, which often emphasize the quiet and enigmatic portrayals of men and women in interior settings. Feltus earned an MFA in painting from Yale University in 1968 when Minimalism and Conceptual Art dominated the art world. The artist decidedly departed from these trends to focus on a highly personal and unique figurative style, one which won him the coveted Rome Prize in 1970. In his practice, Feltus often incorporates the use of photography as a source for his portraits, as opposed to working with live models, as well as influences from classical sculpture, Old Master paintings, and Italian Renaissance art. In this self-portrait the artist appears looking out directly at the viewer, holding our gaze. The details in the representation of his hair, eyes, and mustache contrast with the ambiguous quality of the background. Feltus has lived and worked in Italy since 1987.\n\nBorn in Brooklyn, New York, Larry Fink began experimenting with a camera as a teenager. His work is broad in range, from capturing Hollywood parties for Vanity Fair, to documenting iconic figures and historical events. Fink shot the photographs displayed here on August 28, 1963, at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, in Washington D.C. He released a reprinting of thisimage as a charity fundraiser with all proceeds going to the Until Freedom Organization, an advocacy group for racial justice. In an interview following the social unrest of 2020, in which Fink addressed the multiple facets of his career he stated: “Emotions are primary to all of us, and it’s that which allows us the empathy factor. In my way of thinking that’s how I need to photograph, to go inside the other person somehow and find what it is about them which is also about me.”\n\nEric Fischl rocketed into prominence in the art world in the late 1970s and early 1980s with his large-scale, closely rendered depictions of psychosexual dramas taking place against the backdrop of a staid suburbia much like that of his home on Long Island. Heralded as one of the foremost protagonists of the revival of painting, which had been declared dead in the wake of Abstract Expressionism and the rise of Pop, Minimalism, Performance, and other movements, Fischl studied at the California Institute of the Arts, where the curriculum was more conceptual and intellectual than technical. He was not trained as a painter, but rather decided to become one, finding that he had the manual skill and a temperament that was well suited to the medium.\n\nSince his meteoric rise Fischl has continued his investigations of the human body, sexuality, and psychology in paintings, drawings, and prints. Printmaking, in particular, has been a constant of his work, allowing him to explore similar themes to his paintings but on smaller and more intimate scales. Fischl has generally eschewed the silkscreen favored by many recent artists, instead immersing himself in a variety of often more technically involved processes. This print—based on a drawing still in the artist’s collection that has been the basis for a number of works—is executed in aquatint, a variety of etching that produces a tonal effect through the affixing of varying amounts of acid-proof powdered rosin to a plate which is then exposed to an acid solution. Aquatint is especially well suited for printing in multiple colors, a feature which Fischl uses to emphasize the bold athleticism of the woman in the foreground, who stands out as compared to the male figure in the background both for her size and for the darker tones in which she is rendered.\n\nAudrey Flack’s long career has closely followed the contours of the history of American art since the 1950s. She began her career working in the Abstract Expressionist tradition, making paintings that combined the movement’s thick impasto and all-over abstraction. Towards the end of the 1950s she began to feel that Abstract Expressionism was unable to meet the social and political needs of the moment, embarking on further study of anatomy and the Old Masters, in particular the Spanish Baroque. Her best-known works are in an intensely photorealist style that combines the hard-edged, plasticky look of Pop Art and advertising imagery with the dense detail and witty allusions of the vanitas still-life tradition.\n\nMore recently, Flack has begun to explore sculpture, in particular monumentally scaled sculptures of women that blend classical iconography with her signature hyper-realism. This portrait bust is a scaled-down version of a larger work, part of a massive public commission for the city of Rock Hill, South Carolina. Part of the Gateway, a new business district, the four heroically-scaled female Civitas figures pay tribute to the city’s history—in particular the textile industry—and the virtues of industry and knowledge it seeks to inculcate. Flack, who is self-taught in sculpture, has characterized it as both “New Millennium Neo-Classicism” and post-postmodernism, remarking on the latter term that “The irony and cynicism in postmodernism comes right out of Pop Art. And there’s no cynicism in my work.” Instead, she presents a sincere image of civic strength and virtue buttressed by a similar strength she identifies in female figures from the past, both historical and mythological.\n\nAudrey Flack began her career working in the Abstract Expressionist tradition, making paintings that combined the movement’s thick impasto and all-over abstraction. Towards the end of the 1950sherfocus shifted to the study of anatomy and the Old Masters, particularly the Spanish Baroque. This work shows Flack’s fascination with the sculptures of 17th century Spanishartist Luisa Roldán (1652 – 1706) and is part of a series that Flack created based on photos and postcards of representations of the Madonna that she saw during her travels in Spain. With close attention to detail, Flack depicts here the Macarena Esperanza from the Basilica de la Macarena in Seville. It was around this time that one of Flack’s daughters was diagnosed with autism; she has been open about how she connected with images of Mary as she faced challenging circumstances within her family: “Mary had also experienced a lot of sorrow and grief with her child; I identified with her. Now, I don’t feel that I am Mary, but she was probably a suitable role model for me.”\n\nThis work is part of Guillermo Galindo’s Border Cantos, a series that consists of assemblage instruments created from objects left behind by immigrants while attempting to cross the US-Mexico border, a highly militarized and dangerous region. Found objects might include castoff clothing, children’s backpacks, discarded food, or empty gun shells. The resulting instruments are inspired by indigenous musical traditions from around the world and are often paired with original scores and recorded orchestrations. Galindo imbues these items with life; in doing so, he sheds light on the human aspect of the immigration crisis. The title, Ropófono is a play on words composed of the Spanish ropa (clothes) and gramófono (gramophone), suggesting that the clothing that makes up the piece can tell (or sing) the stories of those who once wore the garments while attempting to enter the US.\n\nFrances Gallardo and Nathan Budoff created this work together over the course of several months. It is the culmination of a rich, collaborative process in which the artists mailed the canvas to each other between San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Ithaca, New York. Budoff began by drawing a few bees on a large piece of canvas and sending it to Gallardo in New York. She then added a network of dark lines to the surface, creating an architectural context for Budoff’s creatures. Subsequently, Gallardo mailed the canvas back to Budoff for his next intervention. The process continued for several months with each artist adding new elements and materials to the composition—charcoal, acrylic, shellac ink, and felt. The artwork evolved in real time, responding to the conceptual underpinnings of their two-person exhibition Growth, Breadth, and Terrain at the Rollins Museum of Art as it was being developed. Although each artist worked independently, they brought their techniques, interests, and vision together to finalize the work. The last intervention on the canvas was completed in July of 2021.\n\nFrances Gallardo was born and raised in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Her artistic practice incorporates scientific data: from hurricane paths and satellite imagery to mosquitoes’ flight patterns, and the effects of Sahara Desert dust in the Caribbean. Research, along with her experience of the island’s landscape, and the study of its history and culture, are key components of her latest body of work. Partly inspired by the Puerto Rican tradition of bobbin lace weaving, Gallardo’s lace-like cutouts evoke that which cannot be seen, but whose effects are felt on an economic, cultural and environmental level. This work belongs to the Hurricane Series, a body of work the artist has been developing since 2009 that explores hurricanes as natural, cultural, and historical events. Satellite imagery informs each piece, which Gallardo transforms into a poetic and delicate object. After countless hours of observation and research of the images and animations in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) digital archive, Gallardo creates a sort of portrait for each of the hurricanes, capturing through texture, form, and color their characteristics, structure, and movement. Named after a member of the artist’s family, Javiercontains the force and energy associated with hurricanes, while also incorporating the intensive labor inherent in lace weaving and paper cutting. The piece emphasizes the overwhelming beauty in the forces of nature, something the artist has been drawn to from an early age: “Growing up in the Caribbean fostered an inevitable interest in hurricanes in me. Throughout their trajectory, they pull the atmosphere like a colossal spinning skirt, leave trace of choreographies on the landscape, and relay a distinct cadence in the economic, social, and political fabric of the islands.” The piece’s skewed perspective relates to the prevalence of computer monitors in our daily lives, present in our peripheral vision as we go about our routines; it is a reminder of the key role of technology in our familiarity with natural phenomena.\n\nGregory Gillespie came of age as an artist in the late 1950s, towards the end of the heyday of Abstract Expressionism, and studied at the San Francisco Art Institute in the early 1960s under such Bay Area Figurative painters as Elmer Bischoff and Richard Diebenkorn. Gillespie rejected the wide open, painterly brushwork of both movements, instead settling on a minutely rendered realism influenced by the Italian Old Masters. He was indebted, however, to Abstract Expressionism for his approach to painting, which was grounded in the complexities of individual psychology, demonstrating an almost obsessive need to investigate the contours of individual experience through his work. This is particularly true in his self-portraits, which make up a large percentage of his overall oeuvre.\n\nThis late self-portrait—painted on wood panel, another practice he gleaned from his close study of Renaissance art—is typical of his explorations of his psyche in paint. Gillespie represents himself standing close against a nondescript green background, his shoulders squared to the picture plane and his head tilted to his right. A small smile—or perhaps a wry grimace—plays on his lips. The painter is unflinching in the honesty with which he represents himself, including the deep folds in his neck and around his mouth, his near-total baldness (including age spots), and his slightly red-rimmed eyes. His blue shirt is rendered with comparatively little detail, increasing the powerful focus on the aging artist’s exploration of his own physical and emotional selfhood.\n\nBorn in Tupelo Mississippi, Sam Gilliam grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, attending the University of Louisville for both undergraduate and graduate school. He did not become an abstract painter until the 1960s, when he moved to Washington, D.C. There he became aware of the Washington Color School, a group of painters including Helen Frankenthaler and Kenneth Noland, who had been experimenting with pouring heavily diluted acrylic paints on raw, unprimed canvases. This process results in luminous admixtures of swirling color, with the weave of the canvas visible through the painted surface.\n\nBlue and Red (And Again) dates from a turning point in Gilliam’s career. In 1967—the year this painting was created—Gilliam’s soak-stain abstractions took a new direction, as he began to crumple, hang, or otherwise distort the physical surfaces of his canvases as they dried, creating new splotches, swirls, and similar effects. He also frequently began to incorporate touches of metallic and other bright paints in his work, as can be seen in the metallic blue droplets which stipple the surface of this painting. He stretched many of these paintings on beveled-edged stretches which gave them a greater volume than standard paintings. These experiments with three-dimensionality would result in 1968 in the series he called the Drape paintings. Eschewing stretchers entirely, these works are suspended from gallery ceilings and walls, and can be hung to complement any given exhibition space, rather than existing in fixed configurations.\n\nSam Gilliam’s rise to prominence in the art world (he represented the United States at the Venice Biennale in 1972) coincided with the rise of the interrelated Black Power and Black Arts Movements. Both movements were skeptical of visual abstraction, preferring artworks which they believed spoke directly to the Black experience in America. This excluded Gilliam and his fellow Black abstract artists, even though many of them considered both their lives and their artworks as engaged in the same struggles for freedom and equality. Gilliam participated in the 1963 March on Washington, and always considered his abstract work inextricably bound up with his blackness. He has commented on his work’s relationship to jazz—both a quintessentially abstract art form and a quintessentially Black one—as well as to the flowing rivers of the American South, particularly in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. He views his own insistence on abstraction as an activist gesture, a refusal to allow the imperfections and injustices of the wider world to impinge upon his artistic vision.\n\nGilliam, a longtime teacher at the Corcoran School of Art, Maryland Institute College of Art, and Carnegie Mellon University, has long referenced other artists in his work, including both historical painters and contemporaries. This silkscreen is inspired by and dedicated to fellow African American artist Chakaiah Booker, whose wearable found-object sculptures build upon the abstract legacy of Gilliam’s Drapes and work by other Black abstract artists The print’s intricately crumpled forms and skeins of color lend it a complex delicacy, while its irregular shape speaks to the kinetic dynamism of both artists’ work.\n\nJay Lynn Gomez was born in San Bernardino, California in 1986 and currently lives and works in Los Angeles. Across different media, Gomez makes visible the too-often invisible physical effort of construction laborers, landscapers, nannies, and other unrecognized workers. In this work, she takes a glossy magazine page and inserts the labor that remains absent in the constructed image of domestic life as depicted in advertising, home décor, and fashion magazines. The thinness of the page and the torn edges emphasize the tangible quality of the forms and reinforce the experience of flipping through the pages of a magazine like Architectural Digest and ripping out a page of interest.\n\nThe artist began with magazine interventions as a result of her own experiences as a nanny and the labor of her parents who immigrated from Mexico. Her ghostly figures appear in posh surroundings, as exemplified by this pool scene. Her work resonates beyond Southern California. Gomez explains: “What I am painting about isn’t anything new—it’s in fact very familiar, immediately recognizable to everyone without getting lost in translation. Labor is everywhere, the cast is different, but the role is the same.” The artist’s work recognizes laborers working in Los Angeles and beyond, and in doing so fills a void in visual culture and popular consciousness.\n\nRead the Virtual Lavender Label for this work.\n\nNancy Graves came of artistic age in the 1960s, part of a group of Yale School of Art MFA graduates that included Chuck Close and Richard Serra, among others. Graves and these contemporaries often had little in common in terms of artistic style, but what they did share was a feeling that the heroic, mythic individualism practiced by the Abstract Expressionists and the highly formalist abstraction championed by Clement Greenberg were exhausted. The result was a profusion of artistic styles and movements, including Conceptualism, post-Minimalist sculpture, and an embrace of hyper-realist representation. Graves combined all of three of these impulses in a practice that included sculpture, painting, and printmaking. A constant—not matter the medium—was her embrace of scientific research, which was inspired by a childhood spent among the natural history collections at the Berkshire Museum in her hometown of Pittsfield, MA as well as by the new possibilities opened up by satellite photography and NASA’s moon landings. During her later career she also increasingly blended references to the history of art as well as archaeology, in particular Paleolithic cave paintings and other artifacts of the remote human past.\n\nThis print, one of series executed in collaboration with 2RC Edizioni d'Arte, Rome, is indicative of this shift. It incorporates references to pointillism and Matisse’s fauvism, ancient art (a fourth-century Roman head, rendered in pink dots and swirls, appears in several works of this era), and drawings of fish, shells, and other natural forms. The wavy blue lines that traverse the canvas are reminiscent of both stylized representations of water and topographical maps, another of Graves’s favorite motifs. This large work—over four feet by four feet—is also a technical marvel, blending etching and silkscreen to an image that is at once delicate and bold, handmade and precise.\n\nRaul Guerrero was born in Brawley, California, a small town just across the border from Mexicali, Mexico. His early work was profoundly influenced by the borderlands culture of 1960s Southern California, as well as the burgeoning Chicano Art Movement. Influenced by an older generation of Southern California artists—like John Baldessari and Ed Ruscha—who had represented the region’s landscape and culture, Guerrero attended the Chouinard Art School in Los Angeles, graduating in 1970. Inspired by a landmark 1963 Marcel Duchamp exhibition at the Pasadena Art Museum, Guerrero developed an interest in European Modernism. After graduating from Chouinard he sold all his possessions and went to Europe and North Africa, immersing himself in the varied artistic cultures he found on his travels.\n\nUpon returning to Los Angeles Guerrero worked in installation and mixed media for a time before turning to this series, called Five Cities after the various travel destinations depicted. Guerrero started the prints with scratchboard, which is covered in white clay and black ink. By scratching the ink with a stylus, the artist can reveal the white clay, creating a drawing where the image is represented in white. He then photographed the works with a large camera, using the resulting negatives to create acetates from which he printed silkscreens. Guerrero’s goal for the series was to create a series of mental snapshots in a stark, graphic mode that reduced individual expression, a reflection of his interest in Marcel Duchamp and other highly conceptual artistic practices.\n\nIn 1971, at the tail end of his European travels, Guerrero ended up in Tangiers, Morocco, where he decided to stay for a while, attracted by the inexpensive cost of living. While there, he made a series of works depicting Morocco’s café culture, which centered around mint tea and kief, the local mixture of cannabis and tobacco smoked out of long pipes. The inscription on the wall reads “the kief destroys the body and the mind.” Rather than Guerrero’s editorializing, the writing references anti-marijuana posters of the time. The vast clouds of smoke, which waft in from the right and threaten to obscure the poster, thus represent Guerrero’s wry commentary on its ineffectiveness. The artist’s work in a variety of media frequently references less-than-officially-sanctioned leisure activities, stemming from his early experiences in Tijuana’s red light district, a rite of passage for Southern California young people in the 1960s.\n\nPhilip Guston, the son of Jewish immigrants who had fled anti-Semitism and violence in Eastern Europe, had a career that was both singular and perfectly in tune with the artistic currents of the twentieth century. He attended the Los Angeles Manual Arts High School with Jackson Pollock, with whom he would remain lifelong friends. During the 1930s he worked on Works Progress Administration murals in Los Angeles, before moving to New York at Pollock’s urging, where he became one of the most in-demand muralists on the Federal Art Project. In the late 1940s he was living in Woodstock, in upstate New York, where he was frequently visited by Pollock, Willem de Kooning, and other pioneers of the Abstract Expressionist movement. Under their influence he gradually abandoned his figurative art, coming to make dense, painterly abstract works dominated by cadmium red, his favorite color.\n\nThis small oil sketch dates from his Abstract Expressionist period. He painted it in the studio of fellow Abstract Expressionist Franz Kline for the Austrian-born American actress Hedy Lamarr, who was a fan of his work. Its quick, sketchy execution and mischevious use of the arrow-through-the-heart motif mark it as a relative anomaly in the artist’s oeuvre. It evokes a playful and sociable vision of Abstract Expressionist painters, one which punctures the mythic individualism which has often characterized the movement.\n\nIn the late 1960s, alarmed by the chaos at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago and what seemed to be rising rightwing violence that reminded him of the 1930s, Guston began to reintroduce figurative elements in his art, his way of directly confronting what he saw as a political and moral emergency. He unveiled the resulting works in 1970 at an exhibition at New York’s Marlborough Gallery. The show was panned by critics, who were at that moment championing the detached cool of Pop and Minimalism, both of which were far from Guston’s seemingly cartoonish imagery of hooded figures, shoes, cigarettes, bricks, and other opaque and frequently personal symbols. Though these works were disdained by critics at the time, they have since come to be seen as urgently important, examining the lingering effects of anti-Semitism, the Holocaust, and right-wing violence on the American psyche, as well as exploring Guston’s own evolving relationship to his life and art.\n\nLike many other artists of his generation, Guston began experimenting with lithography in the 1960s, and the medium played a key role in his formulation of his new figurative aesthetic. The Street, made during the height of the backlash to the Marlborough show, is his first print to fully utilize his new iconography. Like his other prints—and unlike the paintings in a similar vein, which made ample use of cadmium red and other favorite colors—this one is fully black-and-white. It utilizes lithography’s ability to convey a rich, painterly line, and thus represents a fusion of his contemporaneous drawing, painting, and printmaking practices. After this work Guston turned away from lithography for a time, returning to medium only late in his life, when health problems prevented him from working on his preferred large-scale canvases.\n\nA prominent printmaker of the ‘50s generation in Puerto Rico, Manuel Hernández Acevedo is best known for his representations of daily life on the island. His simplified compositions and vibrant colors capture the unique character of the developing mid-century urban landscape, its people and their traditions. Born in Aguas Buenas in 1921, Hernández Acevedo moved to San Juan as an adult; with only a fourth-grade education, he held numerous jobs until he became an employee of the División de Educación de la Comunidad or DIVEDCO (Puerto Rican Division of Community Education) under the supervision of artist and educator Irene Delano (1919 – 1982). It is in that context, working side by side with painters, printmakers, and illustrators that Hernández Acevedo developed his technical and creative skills. This work, the first by this artist to enter the RMA’s collection, shows the effects of gentrification and displacement on the local population.\n\nBorn in 1946, multimedia artist Charlie Hewitt grew up immersed in Lewiston, Maine's French Canadian mill-working communities. Hewitt's work reflects the strength and energetic spirit of the working class culture in New England that provided the backdrop for his childhood and much of his working life. His prints, sculptures, and paintings find their stylistic origins in expressionism and surrealism, employing bold, contrasting color palettes and geometric shapes. As a young adult in New York City, Hewitt began to establish his reputation as a color woodcut printmaker by working at Robert Blackburn’s printmaking workshop in 1975. In 2010, Hewitt moved back to Maine with his wife, Katie Carey, to purchase and renovate several properties that they would transform into artist studios. Together, they have founded the \"Electric Garage\" in Jersey City, New Jersey, and the \"Electric Greenhouse\" in Portland, Maine, as community spaces to foster public creativity and community.\n\nIn his eight-color woodcut, Marker, Hewitt employs a playful dynamism, as a variety of bold colors and amorphous shapes seem to conjure a face. Colorful streaks displaying movement and irregularity suggest a black mustache and a green and brown beret against a bright yellow face. The artist created this print by cutting and carving a selection of mahogany and birch veneer blocks. The final product, printed on masa paper, was completed by printing the blocks in eight runs on a Vandercook-proof press at Vinalhaven Press in the artist’s home state of Maine.\n\nFelrath Hines moved to New York City in 1946 after studying and working in Indianapolis and Chicago. In New York he was at the epicenter of the American art world’s embrace of the gestural, painterly visual language of Abstract Expressionism. He moved even closer to the center of that world when he began an apprenticeship at the workshop of master framer Robert M. Kulicke, whose spare, modern frames were preferred by Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell, and other Abstract Expressionists. This initial experience with the technical aspects of modern art led him to a career in art conservation, which he practiced first as owner of his own conservation company and then as Chief Conservator at the National Portrait Gallery starting in 1972. In fact, conservation was his primary career until 1984, when he retired as the Chief Conservator at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden.\n\nAround the time of his move from New York to Washington, D.C. in 1972, Hines’s work shifted from an Abstract Expressionist style to a more geometric Hard Edge abstraction, mirroring a shift in the broader art world around that time. This undated watercolor, despite the seemingly gestural mode of application of pigment, likely dates from around that time or later. In it, Hines lays his colors next to and on top of one another, exploring the ways in which they contrast, mingle, and overlap as they soak into the paper, informing a future composition utilizing his preferred precise, orderly composition.\n\nThis work dates from the height of Hines’s Abstract Expressionist period, though it also presages his shift to a more geometric form of abstraction in the 1970s. In it, he lays swirls of paint on top and beside one another in a thick impasto, exploring the rhythmic variations in color and texture the technique produces. At the same time, the area of this experimentation lays in a tight bound, surrounded by a whitish-blue framing element that contains and limits this Abstract Expressionist riot, suggesting his future interest in tightly controlled forms.\n\nHines’s work of this period indicates his deep engagement with the broader art world, as does his participation in Spiral, a group of African American artists who originally came together in 1963 to participate in the March on Washington. Meeting in the Manhattan studio of Romare Bearden, the artists discussed issues related to African Americans in the art world as well as their differing approaches to art making. The group had one exhibition before disbanding in 1965, though the many of the artists who participated regard it as an important and formative moment in their careers. Other than with Spiral, Hines mostly refused to exhibit in works dedicated to African American artists, arguing that the work of artists working in wildly different styles should not be considered together simply because they shared a racial identity. This refusal—plus his move from New York to Washington, D.C. in 1972—may have kept him from achieving as much recognition as he otherwise might, but his prolific late-career output and an increasing art world appreciation for Black abstract artists has done much to correct that historical oversight.\n\nJasper Johns is one of the most influential artists of the late twentieth century. Getting his start as a painter, Johns is widely credited with helping to inaugurate the art world’s transition from the heroic autobiographical orientation of Abstract Expressionism to the more conceptual currents represented by Pop, Minimalism, and other, later movements. By using familiar, even rote, motifs like targets and American flags in his early paintings, he was able to decouple the painting’s physical nature from its meaning, exploring the way different mediums and materials changed the look and feel of the works. Beginning in the early 1960s he began to work closely with a variety of printmaking techniques, beginning with lithography and expanding to include etching and silkscreen. Printmaking allowed him to further expand his exploration of technique, structure, and process.\n\nThis silkscreen dates from the decade—roughly spanning 1972 to 1983—when Johns’s work shifted from his recognizable symbols into full abstraction. Known as his crosshatch period for the series of marks (which don’t actually ever cross) that fill the surfaces of his paintings and prints—which Johns claims to have gathered from a design painted on a car he saw in Manhattan—this era of Johns’s work saw him continually reworking this pattern, often in carefully limited palettes of primary or secondary colors. Though this and similar works may seem chaotic and random, they actually are the product of careful and systematic planning, and careful examination of the marks reveals complex, almost indecipherable patterns. The addition of the newsprint underneath the secondary colors of orange, violet, and green recalls Johns’s ongoing fascination with the medium, which he had collaged into his paintings as early as the mid-1950s.\n\nThis sculpture – a ceremonial object for Rosh Hashana (Jewish New Year) – is Kahn’s artistic invention, a modern take on the centuries-old Jewish ritual of tashlikh.Since the Middle Ages, on the first day of Rosh HashanaJewsgo from temple to a body of flowing water and throw in breadcrumbs, symbolically casting away (tashlich comes from the Hebrew word “to cast”) the transgressions they committed during the previous year.Recognizingthat,especially in modern urban settings,access to water is not guaranteed, Kahnintroduces this sculptural box where transgressions can be locked away, out of sight: time starts again, fresh, with every New Year. According to the artist, “This vessel is designed to hold the invisible memories of our own darkness and harm, disappointments we accrue but can shed every year.” Convenient for our modern lives, the object nonetheless allows us to be faithful to established ritual.\n\nWolf Kahn lived an eventful life. Born in Stuttgart and raised in Frankfurt, he narrowly escaped Nazi Germany as part of the famed Kindertransport of Jewish children to the United Kingdom in the last months before the start of World War II. He eventually rejoined his father and other siblings in New York, where he graduated from the city’s High School of Music and Art alongside fellow future artist Allan Kaprow. Upon his discharge from the Navy he enrolled at the New School, but found he yearned to study art. He thus used his GI Bill benefits to study at the famed painting school of fellow German immigrant Hans Hofmann. Kahn quickly absorbed the master’s abstract principles while never abandoning his own commitment to painting the world around him. In addition to Hofmann, the witty, erudite Kahn—who earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Chicago in a single year of study—was attracted to the work of a number of other European modernists, including Chaim Soutine and Pierre Bonnard.\n\nThis work dates from Kahn’s comfortable and productive middle age. His palette lightened considerably in the late 1950s, under the influence of his wife, the late abstract painter Emily Mason. He also discovered pastel, which he came to consider the medium upon which all of his other art was based. From the 1970s he heavily invested himself in exploring the landscapes around his and Mason’s farm in North Brattleboro, Vermont, occasionally venturing elsewhere to work on a commission. This depiction of the Delaware River likely came on such an occasion. Kahn—who remained active as a painter well into his eighties—was particularly taken with bright orange, which he called “one of those really good attention-grabbing colors,” using it to blend the landscape tradition with Hofmann-inflected formalism, all during a period when the art world had largely abandoned painting and other traditional mediums in favor of performance art and other conceptual paradigms. In this work Kahn abandons any attempt at representational color, blending bright orange, white, and acidic yellow in a way that calls forth the strong, active line and brushstroke of his Abstract Expressionist peers.\n\nJun Kaneko was born in Nagoya, Japan in 1942, and he currently maintains a studio in Omaha, Nebraska. Kaneko is a pioneer in the realm of monumental ceramics, but he also works in other media, including sumi ink on paper, acrylic on canvas, bronze and glass sculpture, textile design, and opera production design. In 2012, he was hired as a set designer for a rendition of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s 1791 masterpiece The Magic Flute at the San Francisco Opera, where he displayed two monumental ceramic heads—much like this work—in front of the opera house.\n\nThis sculpture from Kaneko’s Head series is an example of the large ceramic works for which Kaneko is best known. He considers the series to still be in an early “experimental stage,” referencing the various questions that remain in his mind about the effects generated upon viewing the works. Regardless, Kaneko is one of the only artists in the world to produce and glaze by hand ceramics at this scale.\n\nBorn in New York City in 1952, Jane Kent attended the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she earned a Bachelor of Fine Art in printmaking, followed by studies at the London College of Printing in England. She taught at Princeton and Brown, among other prestigious institutions, and is currently Professor in the art department at The University of Vermont in Burlington. Kent’s artistic practice focuses on the creation of vibrant abstract images that convey a sense of playfulness and experimentation. She used unfolded cardboard boxes as templates to build the composition in this work. Although not exactly a portrait, the resulting image loosely suggests a male figure: “Taking my clues from the image as I was making it, I thought about my husband and titled this print The Wonderful Mr. Man.”\n\nEarly in his career, Robert Kipniss was devoted to both painting and poetry. As his family grew, the artist took on additional jobs and focused on painting and printmaking in his spare time. After his discharge from the Army in 1958, Kipniss moved to New York City and settled with his wife in an apartment near Central Park, where he spent long hours sketching trees, rocks, and plants. The landscape has been consistently central to his practice: “The landscapes were magical for me, at least they felt that way. They gave me a great sense of life.” In this work, a house with a single small window in the background and a bare tree in the foreground creates a profound sense of quiet solitude. Kipniss began experimenting with mezzotint (which literally means ‘middle tone’) in the early 1990s; this technique allows him to work significant areas of tonal darkness that result in an atmospheric mood.\n\nBorn in Bosnia in 1975, Amer Kobaslija creates works of art that affirm his presence in a particular place and time, documenting his experiences and layering his own story. For him, painting is a way of chronicling his experience of different geographies, but also of the many people he encounters and befriends. Such is the case with Red Tide, a recent acquisition to the museum’s permanent collection. In the painting, a man stands tall, towering over a small dog between his feet. He looks down, pensive, his hands at his sides. Wearing only his shorts, his bare feet planted on the ground and his chest exposed, the man contemplates the devastation caused by natural phenomena. He was a friend of Kobaslija. They visited Ichetucknee Springs in Florida where the artist photographed him. Kobaslija’s friend passed away shortly after that day. Part of a series informed by his life experiences in Florida, the work memorializes the artist’s friend and comments on the dire situation of the environment. The scene is a reminder of the uneven effects of the climate crisis. The gestural application of paint highlights the man’s expression and the precarious circumstances that surround him.\n\nKobaslija shares some thoughts about Red Tide: “While working on the painting, I remembered my deceased friend and the time we had spent together. I was thinking about the fragility of life and how fleeting it all is. The meaning and meaninglessness of it all. And how vulnerable our environment is, even more so in the age of global warming and the oceans rising. Living in the subtropical lowlands of Florida, the consequences of the impending natural catastrophe could be dire.”\n\nThis painting is an effective example of how a work of art can speak to an individual’s experience while simultaneously articulating a point of view about universal concerns. There is much more to explore in the work: allusions to religious symbolism, the dead fish and tree stumps as a vanitas scene, the significance of a dog in the foreground as a metaphor for loyalty and dedication, and the rich markings that make the man’s face and body almost as if he were coming to life right before our eyes. A moment of vulnerability, but also of beauty, in a world where, to borrow Kobaslija’s words, life is fragile, and everything is fleeting.\n\nThis silkscreen print, a late-career collaboration between the American painter Jacob Lawrence and the Washington, D.C. master printer Lou Stovall, depicts the violent first moments of the outbreak of the famed slave revolt on the Spanish slave ship La Amistad. This action, after which the ship was captured by the United States, eventually resulted in the slaves earning their freedom and returning to Sierra Leone. The revolt and subsequent trial were an instant sensation, galvanizing the nascent abolition movement in the United States and remaining a potent symbol of Black resistance to oppression over the intervening decades.\n\nLawrence is one of America’s best-known modern artists, as well as a luminary of the Harlem Renaissance. Inspired by historians like W.E.B. Du Bois, whose work he read at the famed Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture at the 135th Street Branch of the New York Public Library, Lawrence embarked in the late 1930s and early 1940s on several series depicting important figures and events in Black history, including Toussaint L’Ouverture, Harriet Tubman, and the Great Migration. Working in gouache, a kind of opaque watercolor, he used his mastery of Cubist approaches to form and color to bring the visual tenets of high modernism together with his didactic approach to history. In this print that mastery is on full display, as the twisting figures fight, swinging long curved knives in the desperate struggle for freedom. The roiling waters of the Atlantic Ocean along the bottom of the image serve as a grim reminder of the price of failure.\n\nBorn in the Bronx to Jewish parents who owned a dressmaking shop, Sidney Lazarus showed precocious talent in drawing, so much so that he was consistently bored with conventional schooling. Fortunately, his parents recognized and nurtured his talent, and in 1931 he won a scholarship to study at the Art Students League. In 1932 he became the youngest contributor to Americana, a short-lived satirical magazine that featured works by the master caricature artists Peggy Bacon and Miguel Covarrubias, as well as poems by e. e. cummings and art by John Sloan and George Grosz. A lively—if somewhat inconsistent—career as a commercial illustrator followed, with Lazarus working in the Education Department of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, for DC and other comic book publishers, and for television studios doing line drawings of actors that were sent to newspaper editors for publicity.\n\nAll the while he also made art, though he resisted all attempts by well-meaning friends to encourage his commercial success. In the early 1950s, while continuing to work as an illustrator, he committed to making small finished ink drawings, which he kept in a portfolio in his studio. Calling them “Primagraphs” because they flowed directly from his mind without purpose, premeditation, or an intended audience, they were made only for his private contemplation. This, one of the earliest such works, shows his commitment to figurative Surrealism even as Abstract Expressionism overtook the American art world. An enigmatic boat stands at the direct center of the scene, flanked on all sides by shimmering water and close, even oppressive plant growth. As with his other Primagraphs, the outsider is left to wonder at his purpose, or what the image meant to him, if it meant anything at all.\n\nThis work demonstrates Doris Leeper’s ardent commitment to geometric abstraction. While she originally chose representational imagery and practiced with paint in an expressionist manner, her mature approach, as evidenced here, was minimal and exhibited a commitment to hard edges. Although this small-scale work serves as an excellent example of her abstract compositions, much of Leeper’s works, both sculptures and paintings, were large in scale. The flat and thin application of paint is typical of her painting; moreover, the intense red and pink hues present here are not uncommon in her work. She employed a varied palette but was actively engaged with bright colors.\n\nDespite being raised in North Carolina, Doris (known as “Doc”) Leeper, who moved to Florida in 1958, is now considered to be one of state’s most significant artists. She exhibited throughout the state and some of her works can be seen in public spaces today such as the Orlando International Airport, the campus of the University of Central Florida, and at the Atlantic Center for the Arts, of which she was a co-founder. Leeper was further supported in the region by several corporations that acquired her work. The Museum possesses 50 works by Leeper in its permanent collection, ranging from early pieces that reveal her expressive approach to representational art, to her more recognized and dedicated Minimalist aesthetic. In addition to paintings, prints, and assemblages, the museum houses some sculptural work, including maquettes made in anticipation of public art projects.\n\nIn the earl"
