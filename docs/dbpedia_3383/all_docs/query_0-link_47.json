Grib, and TSNIGRI-Arkhangelskaya. These kimberlites differ in terms of their composition, diamond content, and location. Data presented include the major-element composition of clinopyroxene xenocrysts (>2000 grains), P–T calculations from compositionally filtered Cr-diopside grains, and the reconstruction of local paleogeotherms. Additionally, we used available data on Ni content in peridotitic garnet xenocrysts to calculate their T values and project them onto local Cr-diopside-derived geotherms to reconstruct the vertical distribution of mantle xenocrysts and assess the efficiency of lithospheric mantle sampling by different kimberlites. We identified the presence of a >200 km-thick lithospheric mantle beneath the region at the time of kimberlite emplacement. We also found that the diamond content of the studied pipes was, to some extent, dependent on the following set of factors: (1) the thermal state of the lithospheric mantle; (2) the width of the real “diamond window” marked by mantle xenocrysts, especially by diamond-associated garnets; and (3) the efficiency of lithospheric mantle sampling by kimberlite. The results of this study can be used to inform diamond exploration programs within the region.

Knowing the characteristics of these tectonic structures is crucial for determining the continuity of mineralization in the subsoil and, consequently, for planning their exploitation. To address this challenge, a multidisciplinary study was carried out using various geophysical techniques and direct field observations to analyze the effectiveness of each technique in the investigation of fractures. For this purpose, the mining district of Linares-La Carolina in southeastern Spain, known for hosting Philonian deposits of galena (PbS), was chosen. At the southern boundary of this mining district, the seams stopped being exploited when they lost their continuity due to the presence of a regional normal fault. This fault zone was responsible for hiding the seams under a thick sedimentary cover. Detailed geological mapping allowed us to deduce the presence of two fracture systems. The geophysical techniques of electrical resistivity tomography and the time domain electromagnetic method were used, allowing us to identify the positions and the vertical displacement of these faults. Furthermore, using magnetometry, the presence of a third system of fractures was deduced. The results showed that this multidisciplinary analysis provides information of interest concerning the complex structure that configures the limits of this mining district.

This paper focuses on developing a model for predicting shear wave velocity in unsaturated soils. The model was developed primarily for the interpretation of seismic cone penetration tests (SCPTs) in unsaturated soil to account for seasonal variations in moisture conditions. In practice, SCPTs typically occur over a period of days without the option of choosing a wet or dry period. The question becomes, if tests are conducted during a dry period, how can shear wave velocity corresponding to a wetter period be predicted, or vice versa? Answering this question was the primary motivation of this work. The work involved field testing with the seismic cone penetrometer during wet and dry periods and a focused study at three sites involving comparison between field and laboratory testing for shear wave velocity. The model presented in this paper is built upon the significant work of many other researchers with reference to new experimental data obtained by the authors. It is demonstrated that a stress-based model incorporating matric suction can provide reasonable predictions of shear wave velocity and provides a method to interpret the impact of changing moisture content on shear wave velocities determined with SCPTs.

There are scarce physical tests of the impact of boulders on brick walls, which are typical of residential buildings. A simple and low-cost experimental setup for investigating the damage of unreinforced brick walls that are subjected to a boulder’s impact is presented. The setup consists of a ramp that is adjusted with a light steel structure. Seven pilot tests for five single-leaf brick walls of a 1000 × 1000 mm2 area, hit by a 72.925 kg granite boulder, and from five release heights (0.25 m, 0.50, 1.00 m, 2.50 m, and 3.00 m) are performed. The observed damage indicates that wall breakthrough occurs for translational kinetic energies as low as 500 J. The prevalent failure mechanism is local shear damage. Additionally, a numerical model to simulate the physical tests was developed using the FEM. Using the same properties as in the physical testing, the numerical model is found to realistically reproduce the displacement of a node at the centre of the impact, as well as the translational impact velocity and energy, for the same five boulder release heights.

The aim of this study was to reveal the synchronous trends in rainfall and water quality and to explore the potential connection between seasonal variation in rainfall volume and the water quality index. This study scrutinised the seasonal temporal trends of rainfall and water quality parameters of three water supply reservoirs in the Toowoomba region of Australia by applying the modified Mann–Kendall (MMK) test and innovative trend analysis (ITA) methods from data collected over 22 years (2002–2022). The models showed a significant increasing trend of rainfall in two rainfall stations during autumn season. The water quality parameters, such as PO43−, exhibited a significant decreasing trend in all seasons in three reservoirs. On the other hand, the water quality index (WQI) showed a decreasing trend in the Cooby and Cressbrook reservoirs, excepting the Perseverance reservoir, which exhibited an increasing trend. In addition to the detection of trends, this study investigated the potential correlation between seasonal variation of rainfall volume and the water quality index using the wavelet transform coherence (WTC) method. The data of twelve rainfall stations were brought into this analysis. The WTC analysis displayed an apparent correlation between the water quality index and rainfall pattern for 70% of the rainfall stations across 8–16 periods. The highest coherency was noticed in 8–16 periods from 2002–2022, as observed at both the Cooby Creek rainfall station and in the WQI of the Cooby reservoir. This evaluation revealed the intertwined dynamics of rainfall patterns and water quality, providing a deeper understanding of their interdependence and implications, which might be useful for environmental and hydrological management practices.

The sulphur isotopic analysis indicates that the sulphur isotopic range for Triassic anhydrite (δ34S 8.9 to 20.98‰ VCDT) is the same as the H2S sulphur that is produced from the Montney Formation (δ34S 9.3 to 20.9‰ VCDT). The anhydrite in the Triassic rocks is the likely source of the sulphur in the H2S produced in the Montney Formation. The deeper Devonian sources are enriched in 34S and are not the likely source for sulphur (δ34S 17.1 and 34‰ VCDT). This is contradictory to studies on Montney Formation producers in Alberta, with heavier (34S-enriched) sulphur isotopic signatures in H2S gas of all souring Montney Formation producers. These studies conclude that deep-seated faults and fractures have provided conduits for sulphate and/or H2S gas to migrate from deeper sulphur sources in the Devonian strata. There are several wells that show a slightly heavier (34S-enriched) isotopic signature (δ34S 18 to 20‰ VCDT) within the Montney Formation H2S gas producing within close proximity to the deformation front. This variation may be due to such deep-seated faults that acted as a conduit for Devonian sulphur to migrate into the Montney Formation. Our geological model suggests the sulphate-rich fluids have migrated from the Charlie Lake Formation prior to hydrocarbon generation in the Montney Formation (BC). Sulphate has concentrated in discrete zones due to precipitation in conduits like fracture and fault systems. The model fits the observation of multi-well pads containing both sour- and sweet-producing wells indicating that the souring is occurring in very narrow and discrete zones with the Montney Formation (BC). Government agencies and operators in British Columbia should map the anhydrite-rich portions of the Charlie Lake Formation, together with the structural elements from three-dimensional seismic to reduce the risk of encountering unexpected souring.

There is growing concern about a potential increase in this number due to climate change. The primary source of shallow and rapid landslides within watersheds is the 0-order basins, which are located above the 1st order drainage system. These active geomorphological locations govern the frequency of mass movement. Despite the recognition of their importance, little attention has been paid to the role of 0-order basins in initiating landslides. Drainage systems can be extracted using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) in GIS software. However, the effect of DEM resolution on the extraction of 1st order basins remains unexplained. This research develops an algorithm to assess the impact of DEM resolution on the extraction of first-order basins, channel head points, and the identification of approximate 0-order basins. The study includes algorithms to evaluate the correlation between DEM resolution and 1st order drainage system extraction using fuzzy classification techniques for approximate 0-order basins. The algorithm was applied in Toho Village, Fukuoka, Japan, defining the most appropriate DEM and stream definition threshold with an 86.48% accuracy and ±30 m error margin for channel head points. Critical slip surfaces were identified inside the 0-order basins and validated with a landslide inventory map with a 91% accuracy. The developed algorithms support hazard management and land use planning, providing valuable tools for sustainable development.

Valleys. The case of Calitri offers valuable insights into a methodological approach to studying mass movements affecting human settlements. Post-earthquake investigations in Calitri involved extensive geognostic boreholes and in situ surveys, providing substantial data for lithological characterization and landslide modeling. Additionally, over the past two decades, satellite-based techniques have supported the mapping and characterization of ground deformations in this area, improving our understanding of spatiotemporal evolution. Despite these efforts, a detailed subsurface comprehensionof the tectono-stratigraphy and geometriesof gravity-induced deformation remains incomplete. This study aims to enhance our knowledge of gravity-driven deformations affecting urban areas by using deep-penetrating GroundPenetrating Radar (GPR) surveys to identify landslide-related structures, rupture surfaces, and lithological characterization of the involved lithotypes. The integration of GPR surveys with classical morphotectonic analysis led to the delineation of the main subsurface discontinuities (stratigraphy, tectonics, and gravity-related), correlating them with available geognostic data. This approach provided non-invasive, detailed insights into subsurface features and stands out as one of the rare case studies in Italy that employed the GPR method for landslide investigations.

The health risk from nephrotoxic metals, such as arsenic (As), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), vanadium (V), cadmium (Cd), rubidium (Rb), chromium (Cr), and nickel (Ni), was assessed in drinking water and soils. These metals, even at low concentrations, have the capacity to induce epigenetic damage and a nephrotoxic effect. The quantification of metals in soils was made through X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrophotometry (ICP-OES), while the quantification of metals in water was carried out through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and atomic absorption (AA) spectrometry. The levels of As, Hg, Cd, and V in water were within the permissible limits, whereas Pb was found to be double and triple the value recommended by the World Health Organization. The non-carcinogenic risk from As in soil was evaluated using the Hazard Index (HI), and the route of ingestion was found to be the most important route. The results indicate that consuming water or ingesting soil particles with Pb and As poses a health risk to humans. Therefore, these findings identify the presence of toxicants in an exposure scenario and justify further research into these metals in people and the analysis of exposure routes.

A number of machine learning approaches have been proposed recently for accurate relative and cumulative landside displacement prediction, but researchers have limited their studies to only a few indicators of displacement. Determining which influencing factors are the most important in predicting different stages of failure is an ongoing challenge due to the many influencing factors and their inter-relationships. In this study, we take a data-driven approach to explore correlations between various influencing factors triggering slope movement to perform dimensionality reduction, then feature selection and extraction to identify which measured factors have the strongest influence in predicting slope movements via a supervised regression approach. Further, through hierarchical clustering of the aforementioned selected features, we identify distinct types of displacement. By selecting only the most effective measurands, this in turn informs the subset of sensors needed for deployment on slopes prone to failure to predict imminent failures. Visualisation of the important features garnered from correlation analysis and feature selection in relation to displacement show that no one feature can be effectively used in isolation to predict and characterise types of displacement. In particular, analysis of 18 different sensors on the active and heavily instrumented Hollin Hill Landslide Observatory in the north west UK, which is several hundred metres wide and extends two hundred metres downslope, indicates that precipitation, atmospheric pressure and soil moisture should be considered jointly to provide accurate landslide prediction. Additionally, we show that the above features from Random Forest-embedded feature selection and Variational Inflation Factor features (Soil heat flux, Net radiation, Wind Speed and Precipitation) are effective in characterising intermittent and explosive displacement.

The literature identifies the asymmetry in pressure and the variation in subduction angles between the western and eastern parts of the Makran as key factors in defining the region’s tectonic patterns. The western region has a steeper subduction angle, resulting in lower pressure, reduced coupling, and decreased seismic activity. This disparity arises from different interactions between the subducted and overriding plates. This article offers an overview of the Makran subduction zone, identifies some knowledge gaps, and suggests directions for future research to improve our understanding of this complex geological region. The review highlights the need for more comprehensive GPS stations and targeted studies on subduction dip angles to better understand the region’s tectonic dynamics.

The Ivrea granulites are similar to those in the Lower Mafic Complex of the central Ivrea–Verbano Zone. The mafic lithologies experienced stealth metasomatism (pargasitic amphibole and An-rich plagioclase) that occurred, at suprasolidus conditions, by a pervasive reactive porous flow of mantle-derived orogenic (hydrous) basaltic melts infiltrated along, relatively few, deformation-assisted channels. The chemical composition of the metasomatic melts is similar to that of melts infiltrating the central and northern Ivrea–Verbano Zone. This widespread metasomatism, inducing a massive regional hydration of the lowermost Southalpine mafic crust, promoted a plastic behavior in the lowermost part of the crust during the Early Mesozoic and, ultimately, the Triassic extension of the Variscan crust and the beginning of the Alpine cycle.

Understanding these structures involves evaluating their characteristics, genesis timing, and the dynamics of sediment deformation. SSDSs are essential for deciphering ancient environments, reconstructing depositional processes, and discerning past prevailing conditions. In the Dead Sea region, SSDSs are abundant and well preserved due to unique geological and environmental factors, including rapid sedimentation rates and seismic activity. Influenced by the Dead Sea Transform Fault, the area offers insights into tectonic activity and historical earthquakes predating modern instrumentation. This study extensively examines SSDSs along the Dead Sea area in Jordan, focusing on sediments near the Lisan Peninsula, where the prominent Lisan Formation (71–12 ka) exposes numerous deformations. Mineralogical and geochemical analyses using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) were applied on deformed and undeformed layers to test the potential trigger of seismite formation in the Dead Sea area. The XRD and XRF results reveal Aragonite and Halite as the predominant compounds. Field observations, coupled with mineralogical and geochemical data, suggest tectonic activity as the primary driver of SSDSs formation in the Dead Sea region. Other contributing factors, such as high salinity, arid climate, and depositional settings, may also have influenced their formation. These structures offer valuable insights into the region’s geological history, environmental conditions, and tectonic evolution.

The purpose is to understand the physical–mechanical parameters of these terraces to determine whether rock or soil mechanics principles should be applied for stability analysis. Samples were collected from each terrace following an extensive field survey. Laboratory analyses were conducted to measure pulse velocities, uniaxial unconfined compressive strength, and compressive strength with truncated conical platens. The findings revealed key physical–mechanical parameters of the rocks, which are crucial for stability assessments. The Crotone Basin, known for its mineral resources such as hydrocarbons and rock salts, has been studied geologically since before the 1950s, but there is a lack of geomechanical data in existing literature. Therefore, the results presented here are novel and provide a basis for future studies on the instability of rocky slopes composed of similar soft rock types. These results will aid in accurate geological–geotechnical model reconstructions. While the findings can be applied to similar cases, it is important to note that each analysis site, despite showing similar phenomena, is unique and requires individual investigation.

However, it remained one of the least studied historical events. For reconstructing this earthquake, we reevaluated existing knowledge and used new contemporary and modern sources, including scientific and local writers’ reports and books, local and national journals, newspapers, and ecclesiastical chronicles. The extracted information covered the earthquake parameters, population impact, building damage, and earthquake environmental effects (EEEs). The earthquake parameters included the origin time and duration of the main shock, epicenter location, precursors, aftershocks, and characteristics of the earthquake ground motion. The population impact involved direct and indirect health effects and population change. Building data highlighted the dominant building types and the types, grades, and distribution of damage. The EEEs included ground cracks, landslides, liquefaction, hydrological anomalies, and mild sea disturbances. Field surveys were also conducted for validation. The quantitative and qualitative information enabled the application of seismic intensity scales (EMS-98, ESI-07). The study concluded that since the affected areas were mainly composed of post-alpine deposits and secondarily of clay–clastic alpine formations with poor geotechnical properties, they were highly susceptible to failure. Effects and maximum intensities occurred in highly susceptible areas with a rich inventory.

The 70 m thick weathering profile of the Quaternary tuff consisted of residual soil and completely to highly decomposed rocks. The relatively low dry unit weight and cohesion but high water content, porosity, plastic and liquid limits, and angle of internal friction of the soils in the present study were related to the dominance of halloysite clay minerals. The established relationships to predict soil shear strength parameters from the soil plasticity index and standard penetration test (SPT) N-values were examined, and linear and non-linear relationships for soils derived from in situ weathering of tuff were proposed.

According to data from the IPCC, the global average temperature has shown an increasing trend since 1850, with an average increase of 0.06 °C/decade. Our analysis of summer temperature records from five weather stations in northern Fennoscandia (65°–70.4° N) revealed an increasing trend, with a range of 0.09 °C/decade to 0.15 °C/decade. However, due to the short duration of instrumental records, it is not possible to accurately assess and predict climate changes on centennial and millennial timescales. In this study, we used the Finnish super-long (~7600 years) tree-ring chronology to create a climate prediction for the 21st century. We applied a method that combines a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network with the continuous wavelet transform and wavelet filtering in order to make climate change predictions. This approach revealed a significant decrease in tree-ring growth over the near term (2063–2073). The predicted decrease in tree-ring growth (and regional temperature) is thought to be a result of a new grand solar minimum, which may lead to Little Ice Age-like climatic conditions. This result is significant for understanding current climate processes and assessing potential environmental and socio-economic risks on a global and regional level, including in the area of the Arctic shipping routes.
