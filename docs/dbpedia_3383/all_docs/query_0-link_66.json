        "text": "\"With both precision and passion, Lexi Hudson helps us confront our greatest social challenge—healing our political divides and finding a way forward together as one nation. In hard times, hers is a voice of hope. We at Braver Angels loved having her speak as a keynote at our national convention because she cast a hopeful vision for our nation's future.\"\n\n— David Blankenhorn, President and CEO, Braver Angels\n\n\"Alexandra Hudson gave a brilliant inaugural lecture—\"Civility's Importance to American Democracy\"—for St. Lawrence University's program promoting Civil Dialogue Across Difference. She set a high standard in both illuminating America's present challenges and modeling how to respond to incivility with grace and dignity.\"\n\n— Caroline Breashears, Professor of English, St. Lawrence University\n\n\"Alexandra Hudson spoke eloquently and passionately on the topic of civil discourse and navigating a better path out of the polarity that paralyzes our politics today. Her intellectual curiosity and approach to encouraging better citizenship were refreshing to me, as the lead champion of The Tennessean’s Civility Tennessee campaign. The conversation was illuminating and refreshing. She is fluent on the subject of respectful discourse, viewing civility as more than just politeness, but a civic duty that American citizens must carry out to defend their democratic values and their republic. Hudson makes me optimistic that we can continue to make this union more perfect.\"\n\n— David Plazas, Editor, The Tennessean\n\n\"The Indiana Historical Society had the pleasure to invite Alexandra Hudson to speak recently. She has a clear passion for and knowledge of history and is uniquely connected the subject matter. It was particularly impressive how well Alexandra helped the audience connect to beauty and art in history and art as a tool for cultural healing. This is best evidence by stupendous participant reviews. And, she is a joy to work with. Her thoughtfulness and creativity are infectious. The staff look forward to more opportunities to team up with her! Anyone looking to engage their audiences in a deep but accessible discussion will do well to work with Lexi. You’ll be happy you did.\"\n\n— Jody Blankenship, President and CEO, Indiana Historical Society\n\n\"Alexandra gave an enlightening and engaging presentation to the Kiwanis Club of Indianapolis. We cannot wait to read her book!\"\n\n— David Young, President, Indianapolis Kiwanis Club\n\n\"She is an in-demand speaker, but was generous with her time in visiting our clubs throughout the state. Her passion for civil discourse is contagious. I heard her talk on a number of occasions, and was impressed by her ability to tailor her remarks to speak specifically to each audience she addressed. Her message on civil discourse and civility in our country is essential. Given my involvement with Rotary Clubs, I hope to include her speaking and ideas throughout the state in the years to come. She is an amazing person, passionate about her causes and able to command her audiences easily and professionally every time. I can assure you that you will not regret inviting her to speak to your group or at your event!\"\n\n— Raymond Kramp, District Governor, Rotary Clubs of Indiana (2020-2021)\n\n\"We live in a divided moment where reasonable and clear thinking is urgently needed. Knowing that Alexandra Hudson is a leading voice in our public discourse and of her generation, I have hope for the future of our country.\"\n\n— Lee Hamilton, Democratic congressman from Indiana, founding board member of the National Institute for Civil Discourse\n\n\"Alexandra Hudson is a force of nature. Graceful in her prose and gracious in her spirit, she is the perfect author to tackle the topic of manners and civil society in our frequently ill-mannered and uncivil moment. She is a talented writer, an effective representative that will satisfy readers and play a vital role in a public conversation that is too often petty and mean.\"\n\n- Jim Antle, Editor, The Washington Examiner\n\nPraise for The Soul of Civility“Journalist Hudson debuts with an illuminating ode to civility … Hudson mines a wide range of sources, from Socrates to the epic of Gilgamesh to explore civility’s nuances and then calls for its revival in modern society … an enlightening reexamination of an often-overlooked virtue.”\n\n— Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Civility has become one of the most underrated ideas in contemporary America. Alexandra Hudson, in her elegant and articulate The Soul of Civility, is here to push it over the top once again.\"\n\n— Tyler Cowen, public intellectual, bestselling author, and founder of Marginal Revolution\n\n“Alexandra Hudson has written a remarkable book. The Soul of Civility unpacks the critical concept of civility, distinguishing it from mere politeness and explaining how it is as the core of our social life. It provides insight into writers and civilizations across time and space, and the ways that they are linked through this single idea. A worthwhile read.”\n\n— Francis Fukuyama, Stanford University\n\n\"Alexandra Hudson's The Soul of Civility offers pearls of philosophical wisdom and engaging historical anecdotes all woven into a compelling argument for rediscovering the virtue of civility. Her exploration of the distinction between mere politeness and genuine civility, and the centrality of civility to human flourishing, couldn't be more timely or needed.\"\n\n— Donald Robertson, author of How to Think Like a Roman Emperor\n\n\"In The Soul of Civility, Lexi Hudson, one of the most original thought-leaders of her generation, plumbs the depths of American and classical thought on the centrality of a robust civic community in nurturing the habits of pluralistic democracy. This book should be at the top of the reading list for anyone who is eager to reconnect with a vital part of our heritage, and to rediscover a proven path to renewing America's social institutions.\"\n\n— Don Eberly, author of Restoring the Good Society and America's Promise\n\n\"[The Soul of Civility] is a book that needs to be written, at a moment in American history marked by deepening rancor and polarization, and by growing challenges to traditional norms of decency and civility. . . . [Hudson's] has the potential to influence public understanding of the compelling need for civil society in America.\"\"\n\n— George H. Nash, Ph.D., author of The Conservative Intellectual Movement Since 1945"
