        "text": "Canadian violinist Christopher Whitley is an engaging and versatile performer. From Baroque to electronic music, Christopher is committed to exploring and performing music of all styles.\n\nAn avid proponent of contemporary music, Christopher actively performs and commissions works from new and established composers. His debut solo album, DESCRIBE YOURSELF, features newly commissioned works by Nicole Liz√©e, Kara-Lis Coverdale, Fj√≥la Evans, Leslie Ting, and Evan J. Cartwright. Christopher is the violinist, guitarist, and arranger for Colour of Anyhow, a multi-instrumental duo founded in 2020 with Kumiko Sakamoto. He has performed on period instruments at the Boston Early Music Festival, the Smithsonian National Museum of American History, and the Valley of the Moon Music Festival. During his time in the Bay Area, Christopher was a regular guest of San Francisco jazz group Le Jazz Hot, performing music inspired by Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt.\n\nAs a composer, Christopher has explored a variety of methods and mediums, over a body of work that incorporates acoustic improvisation, electronic processing, and multimedia experimentation. He has released four albums of original compositions and has been invited to create new works at residencies at the Banff Centre and at the Britten Pears Young Artist Program in Aldeburgh, UK. Christopher writes and releases songs as Body Surfer.\n\nChristopher received his Bachelor‚Äôs of music at McGill University studying with Mark Fewer and continued his studies at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music with Ian Swensen.\n\nIn his spare time, he can be found at record stores, libraries and coffee shops and does whatever he can to get into a canoe.\n\nBorn in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Kumiko Sakamoto is a devoted performer, chamber musician, and pedagogue. Her commitment to fostering human connection through art has led Kumiko to pursue a richly diverse career as a violinist, vocalist, and advocate. She is dedicated to sharing the power of music with audiences around the world.\n\nA passionate collaborator, Kumiko has performed alongside members of the Emerson, Kronos, St. Lawrence, Brentano and Borromeo quartets, as well as Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Caroline Shaw, Eighth Blackbird, Leila Josefowicz, Lawrence Power, and the Joe Goode Performance Group. As a founding member of the Thalea String Quartet, Kumiko has performed across North America, Europe, and China, including performances at Weill Hall at Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, and Massey Hall. The quartet‚Äôs commitment to community engagement has led Kumiko to develop a variety of unique educational projects, including virtual teaching residencies, and a strings program for young people with special sensory needs. As a dedicated educator, Kumiko is committed to fostering creativity, health, and well-being amongst musicians of all ages.\n\nKumiko is an award-winning solo artist, and has performed across France, Italy, and Poland, including performances at La Fenice in Venice, and St. Sulpice in Paris. Her debut album, featuring the first recordings of the works of composer Gino Gorini, was released under the Tactus (Naxos) label in 2015.\n\nKumiko‚Äôs love for musical theater, art song, and choral music led her to pursue conservatory training as a coloratura soprano. During her time in San Francisco, she was a member of the Grammy award winning San Francisco Symphony Chorus.\n\nA dancer for most of her life, Kumiko still enjoys attending ballet classes in her spare time, as well as cooking healthy meals and baking for her friends and family. She is a dedicated advocate for social justice, health, and food awareness.\n\nLauren Spaulding, under the alias of @MonochromeViola, has established herself as a rising genre-defying soloist and chamber musician through her ‚Äúanonymous practice blog‚Äù on Instagram. Spaulding, a Texas native, studied under the tutelage of Professor Peter Slowik at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, Geraldine Walther of the Tak√°cs Quartet, Erika Eckerts, Roger Tapping of the Juilliard String Quartet, and Katherine Murdock.\n\nSpaulding is the co-founder of the TallƒÅ Rouge Viola Duo (www.tallarouge.com) with fellow violist Aria Cheregosha. TallƒÅ Rouge, a Cajun & Persian viola duo, inspires composers from around the world to explore the virtuosity and beauty of the unusual instrument pairing across genres. TallƒÅ Rouge is the Ensemble-in-Residence for 2023 ‚Äî2024 at Dumbarton Oaks, a Harvard Research Institute in Georgetown, DC.\n\nBeyond her involvement with Thalea String Quartet and TallƒÅ Rouge, Spaulding is a sought after collaborator, performing alongside Nobuko Imai, Carolin Widmann, Lawrence Lesser, Jorja Fleezanis, and members of the London Haydn Quartet and Imani Winds. Lauren is a member of Meredith Monk‚Äôs contemporary performance ensemble, an award-winning studio recording artist, and Principal Violist and Festival Artist of the Colorado MahlerFest.\n\nDriven by the belief that \"good music is good music,\" Spaulding harnesses her passion for genre-bending performances to challenge societal perceptions of classical music. She is a staunch advocate for composers of all genders, identities, ethnicities, and backgrounds. Having personally navigated the hurdles of learning disabilities and embracing her queer identity during her formative years, Spaulding possesses a deep-seated commitment to inspiring young neurodivergent and LGBTQ+ musicians to pursue their artistic aspirations. Spaulding's unwavering dedication to social advocacy through music earned her the esteemed privilege of performing at the White House in 2012. As a \"Champion of Change,\" she was recognized by President Obama for her contributions in using music as a catalyst for positive social transformation.\n\nWhen Lauren isn‚Äôt on an airplane (playing Pok√©mon), in rehearsal, or performing she loves hanging in the sun, exploring new cities, and learning new skills! Always full of exciting projects, Lauren is often unable to sit idle during the day, but you can sometimes find her relaxing in the evenings while cuddling with her cat Pyrite, drinking coffee, and watching scary movies! üëª\n\nCellist Alex Cox was born into a Cuban American family who had never seen a cello before the fateful day that he lugged one home from school. Having sawed away at the violin for a year prior, his parents were delighted at the more favorable low pitches that squeaked from the other room after some homecooked arroz con pollo. Soon after, the clamor subsided, and the cello became the preferred voice in a family of loud extroverts.\n\nAlex‚Äôs early studies were with the late Orlando Cole. He later earned degrees at the Cleveland Institute of Music, Juilliard School, and New England Conservatory, studying with Melissa Kraut, Timothy Eddy, Paul Katz and Laurence Lesser.\n\nHe co-founded the Omer Quartet with friends while studying in Cleveland, which ignited his passion for shared discovery and the quartet repertoire. They went on to win international competitions, including the Fischoff Chamber Music Competition, Young Concert Artists International Audition, Premio Paolo Borciani Competition (Italy), and Trondheim International Chamber Music Competition (Norway), as well as holding residencies at the New England Conservatory, University of Maryland and Yale University. Subsequently, the group concertized throughout North and South America as well as Europe and developed performances for incarcerated populations in the mid-Atlantic as well as a series of concerts benefitting local food pantries in the DC-Metro area.\n\nDuring the pandemic, the group amicably ended their near-decade-long adventure together. Nowadays, you can find Alex in a concert performing in the Philly/NYC area or a cafe working feverishly on his laptop, trying to help bring greater efficiency to the clinical trial review process as a software engineer."
