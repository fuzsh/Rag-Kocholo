Alternates Gael Mackie and Casey Sandy marched in with Canada's flag.\n\nAUGUST 15  CANADIANS GET DOWN TO BUSINESS AT WORLDS\n\nAnaheim is abuzz with excitment, with the 2003 World Championships set to get underway. Canada's men's team enjoyed a successful podium training session Wednesday. The team consists of brothers Richard and Ken Ikeda, Grant Golding, David Kikuchi, Alexander Jeltkov and Kyle Shewfelt, with Casey Sandy as the alternate.\n\nJoining Canada's women's 2003 Pan Am team is 2001 and 2002 World team veteran Amelie Plante. All seven girls trained on podium yesterday, with the alternate to be announced shortly. The women too had a good podium training session, although there were a few trouble spots on bars and beam, but these are easily fixed. Current National Champion Gael Mackie did not vault, her heels heavily wrapped. More details can be found here.\n\n2000 Olympian and current UCLA student competitor Kate Richardson is the placard bearer for tonight's opening ceremony.\n\nCourtesy of Grace Chiu, Gymn.ca's first photographs from Anaheim are available for viewing.\n\nStay tuned to Gymn.ca for updates, as much as the blackout will allow....\n\nAUGUST 13  MEDAL HAUL FOR ORLANDO IN FINALS AT PAN AMS\n\nOrlando\n\nAlexandra Orlando earned medals in all four finals Sunday at the 2003 Pan Am Games, adding to Canada's medal count with three silver medals (hoop, clubs, ribbon) and a bronze in ball. Ribbon was especially sweet for 16-year-old Orlando, who described the routine as \"the best ribbon routine of her life.\" Mary Sanders continued her domination at the Games, earning gold on all four apparatus.\n\nIn the group event, Canada earned a bronze for their ribbons routine and a silver for hoops/balls.\n\nGymnastics may be over at the Pan Am Games, but many of its competitors are gearing up for the 2003 World Championships. Orlando leaves August 25th for intensive training in Bulgaria leading up to the Rhythmic Worlds, which take place in Budapest, Hungary. While in Bulgaria she'll compete in a tournament in Varna and take a side trip to Zaragoza, Spain for the Vitry World Cup. The Canadian squad will convene in Budapest September 19th for Championships.\n\nBall:\n\n1. Mary Sanders (USA) 24.300\n\n2. Olga Karmansky (USA), 21.800\n\n3.

Canada's Alexandra Orlando dropped one spot from her day 1 finish, to sixth place. The competition was won by Mary Sanders, a dual citizen of Canada and the USA, who now competes for the USA.\n\nBronze was won by Anahi Sosa, from Argentina. She has been competing at the world level for a number of years, and is finally receiving international appreciation. At the prestigious Corbeil-Essonnes this year she was the second highest ranked athlete from the Americas, behind Mary Sanders. Sosa reflected on her win, \"The competition was so difficult, all the girls had posibilities and all the girls were wonderful. I cannot belive I am in the podium,I didn't think I could get it.\"\n\nThe last time Valdez (MEX), Orlando (CAN), and Barata (BRA) met at an important event the three were juniors. The competition was the Four Continents in Curitiba, Brazil and Barata finished first, Orlando second, and Valdez third. Since then Orlando has consistently beaten Barata in competition, causing some to question the judging at the event. The Brazilian Rhythmic Federation this year established a centralized system, with Ukrainian and Bulgarian coaches.\n\nMary Sanders\n\nIndividual Rhythmic - final results:\n\n1.

I had to keep my mindset and keep my routine together.\"\n\nCuba's Eric Lopez, a veteran Pan Am Games competitor, has so far picked up three gold medals in the event finals.

Canada hung on to maintain their second place finish behind the United States team and ahead of Brazil, who had yet to compete. Brazil had some trouble on uneven bars and balance beam to finish over fall behind Canada (144.347  143.732).\n\nFinal team standings:\n\n1. United States 148.982 (Gold)\n\n2.

The women scored a 144.347 total, which was beaten only by the 148.982 total posted by the team from the United States. In third after the first two subdivisions is the team from Mexico, with 137.120. Still to compete are top teams from Brazil and Argentina, both of whom are expected to challenge for a medal.\n\nThe Canadian performance was particularly remarkable, considering they competed without reigning national champion Gael Mackie, who warmed-up but was too weak to compete. Mackie, her teammates, and seven from Canada's women's basketball team were earlier afflicted by a nasty stomach virus. \"I'm a little bit disappointed,\" Mackie told reporters. \"I really wanted to compete. But the main thing is the worlds in two weeks, and the coaches wanted me to be safe, not have any injuries.\"\n\nAs a result of Mackie's withdrawal, the remaining five athletes had to compete all four events, with the top four scores counting on each apparatus. Canada's top all-arounder after two subdivisions is Seneca's Lydia Williams, who sits third overall with a 36.274 total. Williams posted four very consistent scores, ranging from a 9.000 on bars to a 9.137 on vault.\n\nStanding fifth for Canada is Ottawa's Heather Purnell with 36.024. Purnell shone on the vault (9.300) and floor exercise (9.187), but took scores below 9.0 on bars and beam.\n\nPurnell's clubmate Melanie Banville is in position to round out Canada's contingent to Sunday's all-around final, finshing as the third Canadian, and currently in sixth place overall. Banville was in position to challenge for one of the top all-around spots when she fell on her triple twist on floor, taking an 8.325 for a 35.712 total. Banville took Canada's top score on the uneven bars, a 9.287, which should be good enough to qualify for event finals.\n\nRounding out the Canadian team effort were Richelle Simpson (35.337) and Kylie Stone (34.924), both of whom suffered falls on their uneven bar dismounts. Simpson looks to be a safe bet to make the floor final with a 9.250 score that led the Canadian team.\n\nFurther results will be posted as they become available.\n\nCanadian scores (unofficially):\n\nLydia Williams 36.274 [9.137, 9.000, 9.012, 9.125]\n\nHeather Purnell 36.024 [9.300, 8.750, 8.787, 9.187]\n\nMelanie Banville 35.712 [9.225, 9.287, 8.875, 8.325]\n\nRichelle Simpson 35.337 [9.062, 8.150, 8.875, 9.250]\n\nKylie Stone 34.924 [9.150, 8.312, 8.387, 9.075]\n\nAUGUST 1  TEAM CANADA READY FOR PAN AMS\n\nGymnastics sculpture\n\nin Santo Domingo\n\nPhoto courtesy Grace Chiu\n\nStrong teams will be representing Canada at the Pan American Games, which begin this weekend in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. For the women, this meet will serve as an important tune up for the World Championships in Anaheim, California, which take place less than two weeks following the games. According to team member Melanie Banville of Ottawa Gymnastics, \"the team is coming along really well. We are working extremely hard and its starting to show. As for the extremely hot weather conditions, she added that it is extremely hot but we are starting to get used to it.\" Joining Banville on the team is clubmate Heather Purnell, who was also named team captain, national champion Gael Mackie of Omega, current NCAA champion Richelle Simpson of University of Nebraska  representing Canada internationally for the first time, Stampede Citys Kylie Stone, and Senecas Lydia Williams. These six women will travel directly to Anaheim following the games where they will begin their final preparations for the world championships. Their podium training there takes place on Thursday, August 14th. They will be joined there by Amélie Plante of Gymnix, non-traveling alternate for the Pan Am Games. The final decision of which six gymnasts will compete at the World Championships has not yet been made.\n\nAs for the Canadian men, a mostly young team will compete at the Pan American Games, with the strongest team being saved for the World Championsihps. Saskatoons Rhett Stinson - a veteran national team member with World Championship experience (he competed at the 1997 worlds in Lausanne, Switzerland), and current national champion in the parallel bars, will serve as team captain. Just missing the cut for the world team, Stinson will bring a wealth of experience and leadership to the young Pan Am team, according to mens programme director Karl Balisch. Also competing in Santo Domingo will be Edmontons Brandon ONeill, national champion in the floor exercise and one of the favourites on this apparatus at the games; Canada Games and junior national champion Nathan Gafiuk of Calgary; former junior stand-out and multiple Canada Games winner Adam Wong of Calgary, Eric Kafka of Burlington (another former junior stand-out); and Jared Walls of Edmonton (10th at the recent Canadian championships).\n\nA different group of seven gymnasts will travel to Anaheim for the World Championships. They are current national all-around champion and veteran Richard Ikeda of Abbotsford and his younger brother Ken Ikeda; former national all-around champion and 1999 world silver medallist on high bar Alexander Jeltkov of Montreal; national vault champion and world cup floor medallist Kyle Shewfelt of Calgary; national pommel horse champion Casey Sandy of Burlington; David Kikuchi of Halfiax (national champion on rings and world team member in 2001); and Calgarys Grant Golding - the top all-arounder for Canada at the last worlds in 2001. One of these gymnasts will eventually be named as team alternate.\n\nCompetition at the Pan American Games begins Saturday, with the womens team competition. Gymn.ca will bring you updates throughout the week-end as they become available."
