The purpose of this review was to synthesize evidence on transmission risks, diagnostic test characteristics, and recipient management to inform best-practice clinical guidelines. The final review, presented as a special supplement in Transplantation Direct, collates case reports of transmission events and other peer-reviewed literature, and summarizes current (as of June 2017) international guidelines on donor screening and recipient management. Of particular interest at the time of writing was how to maximize utilization of donors at increased risk for transmission of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus, given the recent developments, including the availability of direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus and improvements in donor screening technologies. The review also covers emerging risks associated with recent epidemics (eg, Zika virus) and the risk of transmission of nonendemic pathogens related to donor travel history or country of origin. Lastly, the implications for recipient consent of expanded utilization of donors at increased risk of blood-borne viral disease transmission are considered.\n\nSupplemental digital content is available in the text.\n\nThe unanticipated transmission of an infectious disease from an organ donor to recipient(s) is a rare event; however, when it does occur, it is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.1 Therefore, it is the goal of organ donation and transplantation programs to minimize such events while simultaneously maximizing opportunities for transplantation. This goal relies on (i) rational donor screening policies based on an understanding of the epidemiology of infectious diseases of interest and the performance characteristics of the tests used to diagnose them, and (ii) evidence regarding patient outcomes in the event of disease transmission, to facilitate informed decision making with regard to the risk tradeoff between accepting an organ with an increased risk of disease transmission versus remaining on the waiting list.\n\nThis literature review summarizes case reports, peer-reviewed literature, and international guidelines on the following topics:\n\ni.\n\ndonor-derived infectious disease transmission events in recipients of solid organs from deceased donors;\n\nii.\n\nresidual risk of bloodborne virus transmission under different deceased donor scenarios;\n\niii.\n\nthe impact on recipient outcomes of the transmission of viral, bacterial, parasitic, fungal, and other infectious diseases;\n\niv.\n\ndiagnostic test availability, modality, and performance, and international guidelines for donor screening;\n\nv.\n\nclinical practice strategies for minimizing transmission risk from increased-risk donors;\n\nvi.\n\ncurrent international recommendations with respect to recipient management posttransplant in the event of possible infectious disease transmission;\n\nvii.\n\nvigilance and surveillance systems in organ donation and transplantation.\n\nThe potential to transmit bloodborne viruses (BBV)—human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and hepatitis B virus (HBV)—is of particular concern in the transplantation context, and HIV, HCV, and HBV are the primary focus of this review. Other pathogens that are discussed in detail include human T-lymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1), influenza, herpes simplex virus (HSV), Treponema pallidum, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, multidrug-resistant bacteria, Strongyloides stercoralis, Toxoplasma gondii, malaria, and transmissible spongiform encephalopathy disease.\n\nOther pathogens of special interest that are also discussed include West Nile Virus (WNV) and Zika virus.\n\nThe review excludes:\n\ni. detailed discussion of the biological mechanisms of disease transmission;\n\nii. cell and tissue donation;\n\niii. transmission of noninfectious diseases, such as cancers;\n\nvi. discussion of recipient quality of life as a consequence of disease transmission;\n\nv. discussion of experimental interventions, drugs, or diagnostic tests still in the development pipeline (including genomic approaches to pathogen identification);\n\nvi. vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA): given that the intended outcomes of VCA is quality of life (not survival), much stricter donor eligibility criteria apply with regard to risk of infectious disease transmission;\n\nvii. animal to human transmission of zoonotic disease;\n\nviii. detailed review of protocols for adverse event reporting (biovigilance is addressed in the Australian Vigilance and Surveillance Framework for Organ Donation for Transplantation);\n\nix. explicit recommendations for policy and practice;\n\nx. living donor transplantation.\n\nLastly, although our understanding of the microbiome contained within specific organs, particularly lung and small bowel, is growing, there are at present limited data on the impact of its transfer on recipients, and transfer of microbiota is not generally considered in donor evaluation. The transfer of the microbiome is, therefore, not addressed, with the exception of a brief discussion of current existing evidence regarding the impact on recipient outcomes of the transmission of the lung virome.\n\nDefinition of Donor-derived Infectious Disease Transmission\n\nThe majority of donor-derived infectious disease transmission events are expected: that is, the donor is known to be infected with a given pathogen (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] or Epstein-Barr virus [EBV]). It is expected that this pathogen will be transmitted to the recipient(s) of their organs, for whom risk mitigation strategies will be used (eg, prophylaxis and/or monitoring) to minimize the impact on graft and patient outcomes. On rare occasions, however, unexpected transmissions occur. Unexpected transmissions are defined as the transmission of a pathogen from donor to recipient, despite donor screening to rule out the presence of donor infection. Unexpected transmissions are most likely to occur if the donor has recently acquired the infection and is still in the eclipse period or serological window before detection is possible, if testing is not undertaken, if sensitive diagnostic tests are not readily available, or if the donor is infected with a rare or emergent pathogen that is not included in standard screening protocols. Unexpected transmissions may also occur due to incomplete or inaccurate donor information, or due to communication or system failures.2 Unexpected transmissions are more likely to occur in the context of deceased donation; however, they can also occur in living donor transplantation. United States surveillance data collected from 2008 to 2013 found that 0.16% of deceased donor organ transplants and 0.01% of living donor transplants were unexpectedly complicated by donor-derived infectious disease; the rate of mortality as a consequence of this disease transmission was 22%.3\n\nOne of the difficulties when reviewing the evidence on unexpected donor-derived infectious disease transmission events is that attributing origin of disease to the donor is not always straightforward. For this reason, standard definitions of imputability for donor origin of infectious diseases in transplant recipients have been developed in the United States and Europe (see Table and Table ). Transmission events reported in this review refer to proven/definite and probable/likely cases unless otherwise specified.\n\nStandardized definitions of imputability are an essential component of biovigilance—without agreed upon criteria, it is very difficult to determine which adverse events should be counted by surveillance systems. Even with standardized criteria for classifying donor-derived disease transmission, it is not always possible to definitively classify reported cases.1 Some of the required confirmatory tests may not have been performed or appropriate specimens or cultures may not be available for retrospective testing. Pretransplant recipient blood or sera are often not available, meaning it cannot be definitively established whether the recipient had latent infection before transplantation, or cultures may not have been maintained to permit molecular fingerprinting of donor and recipient bacterial strains. It is, therefore, important that frozen serum and other samples be maintained for every donor so that, if investigation is required, sufficient archived samples are available to prove or exclude the donor as the origin of the infectious disease transmission.5\n\nDonor Risk Stratification\n\nDonor-related infectious disease transmission risk can be conceptually divided into 2 stages: the pretransplant phase and the posttransplant phase. In the pretransplant phase, the concept of “transmission risk” refers to the theoretical probability of disease being transmitted from donor to recipient based on what is known about the donor and the pathogen(s) in question. In the pretransplant phase, risk mitigation practices consist of1:\n\ni.\n\nrisk assessment of the donor based on their medical and social history, in the context of local epidemiological information;\n\nii.\n\ncareful physical examination of the donor and the donor organs;\n\niii.\n\nlaboratory screening of biological samples taken donor for evidence of infection.\n\nIn the posttransplant phase, “transmission risk” (or “potential transmission”) refers to the potential for live donor cells capable of transmitting a known infectious pathogen to result in an infection in the recipient. In the posttransplant phase, risk mitigation practices consist of:\n\nvi.\n\nprophylaxis in the recipient (including antimicrobials, immunoglobulin and/or vaccination),\n\nv.\n\nadditional screening of donor samples (eg, finalizing blood and urine cultures and drug sensitivity testing if these were not completed before transplant),\n\nvi.\n\nposttransplant monitoring of recipients,\n\nvii.\n\nadverse event reporting and biovigilance systems.\n\nRisk stratification of the donor is a triage step that identifies donors who should undergo additional screening tests, and also flags when specific recipient consent may be required. In the United States, donors are dichotomized as being either at increased risk or without identified risk.7 In Europe, a graded system specifying 5 levels of risk, originally developed for donor evaluation by the Italian National Centre for Transplantation, was used until recently (see Table ); Europe has now also transitioned to a system of dichotomous categorization of donor risk.8 The approach currently used in Australia similarly defines potential donors as either increased-risk or non–increased-risk.\n\nThe categorization of donors according to the degree of infectious disease risk associated with their medical and social history can be useful for several reasons. First, it identifies donors for whom more sensitive diagnostic tests may be warranted (eg, nucleic acid testing [NAT]), and gives appropriate context to the interpretation of results from serological tests, which might yield false-positive or false-negative results and cannot detect very recently acquired infections where the individual is still within the serological window/eclipse phase. Second, by assigning a risk category to potential donors, this facilitates discussions with the potential recipient about the risks associated with a particular donor organ and may, therefore, simplify the consent process.\n\nOn the other hand, a “labeling effect” has been described whereby describing donors as either “standard risk” or “increased risk” may lead to higher rates of organ discard. In the United States, for example, up to 20% of organs fall under the United States Public Health Service (PHS) criteria for high risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV (labeled PHS-IR), and the utilization rate for these organs is significantly lower than for non–PHS-IR organs. This is despite the absolute risk of disease transmission being extremely low and posttransplant survival being equivalent for recipients of PHS-IR and non–PHS-IR organs.9,10 Patients and their physicians may be reluctant to accept organs labeled with pejorative descriptors, such as “increased-risk,” if they have the possibility of waiting for an organ perceived to be without risk of HIV, HBV or HCV.11-13 Patient education and consent processes, therefore, need to provide patients with an objective understanding of the infectious disease risks associated with organ transplantation, framed in terms of the trade-off between potential risks and potential benefits involved in organ acceptance decisions.\n\nIn 2017, the Victorian and Tasmanian Renal Transplant Advisory Committee established a new waiting list for patients awaiting a deceased donor kidney transplant who have consented to receive a kidney from a donor at increased risk of HIV, HBV, and HCV (referred to as an increased viral risk (IVR) donor). IVR donors are defined as (i) having known increased risk behavior and (ii) risk behavior being within the NAT window for HIV, HBV, or HCV detection (defined as 22 days from admission to hospital) and (iii) having no evidence of active infection (negative serology/NAT). More information on the patient education and consent process to join the IVR donor waiting list is given in Recipient Consent.\n\nAs of November 2017, the surveillance of adverse events after organ transplantation in Australia and New Zealand was performed at the individual jurisdictional level; however, a framework for an integrated, nationwide biovigilance, and surveillance system has been developed and is in the process of being implemented (see Vigilance and Surveillance). The historical absence of an integrated biovigilance and surveillance system means that a central database of infectious disease transmission events occurring in Australia and New Zealand does not currently exist. Table was compiled based on expert consultation and summarizes occurrences of serious adverse events involving infectious disease transmission from organ donors to recipients from 2008 onward (no cases older than 10 years were reported by any of the expert consultants and the most recent reported case occurred in 2016; no cases were reported from New Zealand). Details were obtained for a total of 18 transplants complicated by donor-derived infections between 2008 and 2016, from which there were 8 deaths (mortality rate of 44%). No 2 cases involved the same pathogen. Assuming that the list of cases in Table is relatively comprehensive, then this indicates that approximately 0.18% of deceased donor organ transplants in Australia were unexpectedly complicated by donor-derived infectious disease transmission between 2008 and 2016 (18 transmission events vs approximately 10 000 solid organs transplanted from deceased donors in Australia). This rate is similar to the reported rate of donor-derived infectious disease transmission in the United States of 0.16%.3\n\nCurrent Utilization of Increased-risk Donors\n\nIn 2015, 2.7% of actual organ donors in Australia and New Zealand had drug overdose listed as a cause of death (P. Clayton, personal communication). The corresponding proportion in the United Kingdom was 0.3%, whereas in the United States, it was 9.3% (see Figure ). Although the very large proportion of donors derived from drug overdose deaths in the United States might suggest a case for greater utilization of increased-risk donors in Australia and New Zealand, international practice must be interpreted in context, and benchmarking approached with caution. The high proportion of drug overdose as a cause of death in the United States donor population is a consequence of the current opioid epidemic, which has caused a 2.5-fold increase in drug-related deaths from 2000 to 2015. More than 6 of 10 drug overdose deaths in the United States were due to opioids (including opioid pain relievers and heroin) in 2014.20 The number of organ donors in the United States with drug overdose listed as the cause of death increased 350% between 2003 and 2014 (n = 138 vs n = 625).21\n\nCompared with a drug-related mortality rate in the United States population aged 15 to 64 years in 2014 of 233.8 per million population, the drug-related mortality rate in Australia in 2013 was 116.2 per million population aged 15 to 64 years; in New Zealand, it was 26.7 per million population aged 15 to 64 years.22 In the United Kingdom, the drug-related mortality rate was 66.7 per million population aged 15 to 64 years in 2014.22 In all 3 countries, opioids were the number one drug causing death.22 Notably, the rate of deaths due to opioids (including prescription opioids) in Australians aged 15 to 54 years has been increasing since 2007, reaching 44.7 deaths per million population (n = 564) in 2012 versus 30.4 in 2007, although rates are still far below their 1999 peak of 101.9 deaths per million population.23,24 There has also been a spike in fatalities related to methamphetamine use in Australia: between 2009 and 2015, the annual number of methamphetamine-related deaths doubled, from around 150 to 300 per year.25\n\nAlso relevant when making any international comparisons with respect to utilization of increased-risk donors is the underlying prevalence of BBV in the population. Among intravenous drug user (IVDU) populations in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand, the estimated prevalence of HIV in 2016 was 3.6%, 1.3 %, 1.7%, and 0.2%, respectively.26 Estimated prevalence of HCV in IVDU populations in 2016 was 73% in the United States, 50% in the United Kingdom, 57% in Australia, and 57% in New Zealand.22 Comparisons of BBV prevalence in the IVDU populations of selected high-income countries are shown in Figure .\n\nVigilance and Surveillance\n\nAlthough cases of donor-derived disease transmission are rare, the immediate reporting and investigation of any posttransplant infection in the recipient and the notification of other recipients of organs and tissues from the same donor is imperative to prevent/minimize harm to those exposed. At the level of the transplant center/jurisdictional health service, systems must be in place to immediately notify the relevant physicians and to rapidly assess recipients of other organs or tissues from the infected donor. Ideally, centralized reporting of serious adverse events should also occur to enable monitoring of frequency and outcomes of infectious disease transmission and to facilitate continuous improvement in safety standards and practices in donation and transplant systems (involving the DonateLife agencies).\n\nIn May 2010, Resolution 63.22 of the World Health Assembly added 2 pertinent items to the World Health Organization's Guiding Principles on Transplantation:\n\nGuiding Principle 10:\n\nThe level of safety, efficacy, and quality of human cells, tissues, and organs for transplantation, as health products of an exceptional nature, must be maintained and optimized on an ongoing basis. This requires implementation of quality systems including traceability and vigilance, with adverse events and reactions reported, both nationally and for exported human products.\n\nGuiding Principle 11:\n\nThe organization and execution of donation and transplantation activities, as well as their clinical results, must be transparent and open to scrutiny, while ensuring that the personal anonymity and privacy of donors and recipients are always protected.\n\nThis Resolution, therefore, defines an international obligation among countries with organ and tissue transplantation programs to have systems in place for quality assurance, traceability, vigilance and surveillance, and transparent reporting of adverse events. Not only is this critical to the continuing improvement of individual transplantation programs but also the more data that are available on adverse events and their outcomes, the more that all transplant programs can improve policy and practice. Serious adverse events are rare, which makes decision making complicated given a lack of prior experience or existing evidence. Greater international reporting of such events enables better decision making at the individual patient level in terms of risk mitigation and recipient management. It also improves standards of informed consent as the trade-offs between transplantation with an increase-risk organ versus nontransplantation will be better understood.\n\nInternationally, however, centralized systems for surveillance of donor-derived infectious disease transmission events are still largely nonexistent or in developmental stages. Well-established biovigilance systems currently exist only in France, Italy, and the United States. Australia has been working toward the development of a vigilance and surveillance system since 2011, and a formal framework for this system was published in September 2016.27 Further development and the implementation of this framework by the Vigilance and Surveillance Expert Advisory Committee are underway.\n\nThe Australian vigilance and surveillance system will operate in parallel with existing, jurisdictional clinical incident management systems, providing coordinated notification of serious adverse events and handling data collection and analysis. The clinical management and investigation of serious adverse events will remain the responsibility of the hospital and jurisdictional health authorities where the incident occurs. The objectives of the national vigilance and surveillance system are to enable centralized collection and review of information on serious adverse events, to coordinate interjurisdictional notification where appropriate, and to share de-identified information on events and outcomes internationally. The 2016 framework document outlines a governance structure, system requirements for vigilance and surveillance, performance monitoring strategies, data collection requirements, and requirements for linkages and harmonization of reporting with international vigilance and surveillance systems.27\n\nINTERNATIONAL VIGILANCE AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS\n\nEurope\n\nThe European Union has implemented several pieces of legislation with relation to the quality and safety of human tissues and cells, including Directives issued in 2006 specifying technical requirements for traceability and notification of serious adverse events and reactions, and in 2010 specifying standards of quality and safety of human organs intended for transplantation. From 2009 to 2012, the Substances of Human Origin Vigilance and Surveillance project developed guidance documents for EU Member States for the establishment of effective vigilance and surveillance systems for tissues and cells for transplantation and assisted reproduction.28 In 2011, the European Framework for the Evaluation of Organ Transplants project developed a framework for a pan-European registry of organ and transplant registries, including a set of recommendations with respect to vigilance and surveillance in organ transplantation (http://www.notifylibrary.org/content/european-framework-evaluation-organ-transplants-efretos).\n\nThe European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & HealthCare (EDQM) makes the following recommendations with respect to vigilance and surveillance in organ transplantation5:\n\n•\n\ngovernance structures must be defined and understood by stakeholders;\n\n•\n\nhealth authorities should develop reporting procedures, standardized notification forms, surveillance methods, acceptable risk criteria, and examples of serious adverse events that must be reported;\n\n•\n\noperating procedures must be in place defining how transplant centers are to identify, report, investigate, and communicated adverse events;\n\n•\n\nto assist the investigation of adverse events, frozen serum and cell samples should be maintained for every donor;\n\n•\n\nreporting should include a description of the adverse event, a root cause analysis, and a description of steps taken to resolve the problem/avoid similar events occurring in future;\n\n•\n\nadverse events should be reported immediately, before investigation and confirmation, with all health authorities, transplant centers, and tissue establishments being alerted;\n\n•\n\nideally, transplant centers should have a designated vigilance coordinator;\n\n•\n\ncentral coordination and oversight should be in place for center level vigilance and surveillance and quality management systems;\n\n•\n\nregular audits should be conducted of data collection procedures and the investigation of adverse events by transplant centers;\n\n•\n\ncomputerized systems for data collection and management should be established;\n\n•\n\ndata collection should be integrated with existing organ donation and transplant registries.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nUnited Kingdom Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO) guidelines recommend the routine screening of recipients at 1 year posttransplant for presence of pathogens potentially transmitted from the donor.29 Nucleic acid testing is preferred to account for the effect of immunosuppression on serological test accuracy, and ideally, samples from the recipient taken pretransplantation would be available to differentiate between preexisting and newly acquired disease. The SaBTO guidelines make the following recommendations where there is potential transmission29:\n\n•\n\nit is essential that confirmatory testing, including NAT assays, be undertaken on the donor sample to confirm specificity of the serological reactivity and the likelihood of transmission;\n\n•\n\na risk assessment should be undertaken to identify the susceptibility of the recipient to infection and to disease;\n\n•\n\nexpert advice should be sought and appropriate postexposure prophylaxis administered to the recipient;\n\n•\n\nprophylaxis should also be considered for close contacts of the recipient where secondary transmission is possible;\n\n•\n\nthe exposed recipient should be enrolled for follow-up;\n\n•\n\nit is good medical practice to refer an infected donor and close contacts of any infected donor, living or deceased, to an appropriate expert.\n\nWhere recipient infection is detected and indicates potential transmission from the donor, it is then the duty of the recipient's physician to ensure that recipients of organs and tissues from the same donor are notified as soon as possible and made aware of the infection risk. The National Health Service Blood and Transplant Directorate for Organ Donation and Transplantation (ODT) has a Duty Office that is able to assist in informing the relevant clinicians. All incidents reported to the ODT Directorate are managed by the Clinical Governance Team within ODT.30 The Clinical Governance Team forms the Clinical Governance Improvement Group, which is responsible for reviewing and monitoring serious adverse events and reactions, and aims to complete investigations within 90 days or less. Once an incident has undergone a full review, the individual who reported the incident will be sent a summary of the outcome and any key actions or learning that is required. The central remit of the Clinical Governance Improvement Group is to (1) have oversight of all incidents, review in detail individual incidents, and ensure areas of concern are addressed, learning is shared, and practice is changed as appropriate; and (2) identify and review key themes and trends across incidents, and to develop key actions following these reviews.\n\nWider oversight of incidents is provided by the ODT Clinical Audit, Risk and Effectiveness Group (CARE). ODT CARE is chaired by the ODT Associate Medical Director, and its members include senior operational, nursing and medical representation, clinical governance, quality assurance and scientists.30 The role of ODT CARE is to monitor and provide oversight of clinical complaints and legal claims, Clinical Audit, Clinical Risk Register, and the approval of clinical policies proposed by Advisory Groups. The ODT CARE group ensures that:\n\n•\n\nclinical governance requirements are met;\n\n•\n\nopportunities to improve practice and compliance are identified and pursued;\n\n•\n\nareas of clinical concern are addressed and lessons learned, identified, and, where appropriate, shared and changes implemented;\n\n•\n\nlessons learned are shared among the donation, retrieval and transplant community as appropriate;\n\n•\n\nthe regulatory requirements of the Care Quality Commission, the Human Tissue Authority and other regulatory bodies are met.\n\nODT CARE in turn reports to ODT Senior Management Team and the United Kingdom National Health Service Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) CARE Committee, which has oversight across NHSBT.30\n\nUnited States\n\nThe National Organ Transplantation Act of 1984 legislated for biovigilance in organ transplantation in the United States, establishing standards for traceability and procedures for the prevention of transplantation of organs infected with HIV. Under the current system, the United States Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) requires that all unexpected, potentially donor-derived disease transmission events be reported to the OPTN/United States United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), where cases are then reviewed by the Disease Transmission Advisory Committee (DTAC). Disease Transmission Advisory Committee is then responsible for (i) estimating the risk of donor-derived disease transmission, (ii) reviewing cases reported to OPTN, (iii) notifying public health agencies in the event of a suspected transmission, (iv) reporting findings to the transplant community, and (v) providing policy recommendations to the OPTN.31 Details of the reporting requirements for posttransplant discovery of disease in donors or recipients are given in Table .32 When a notification of a potential transmission event is received, a report with all patient information redacted is delivered securely to DTAC members, who are alerted of the new report. Disease Transmission Advisory Committee then engages in an email-based confidential medical peer review process. Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) are subsequently required to submit a follow-up report 45 days after the initial report with the results of their investigation into the event.31\n\nSince the implementation of the OPTN mandatory reporting policy in 2005, several improvements have been made to the reporting system, including the 2012 publication of an algorithm to help the committee classify reports of potential donor transmission events as proven, probable, possible, unlikely, or excluded from further review.3 This algorithm can be viewed at the following link: http://bit.ly/2E2eQC7.3\n\nBased on DTAC reports for 2013, the most frequently reported potential transmission events involved HCV, tuberculosis, HIV, Chagas, HBV, toxoplasmosis and WNV, as well as bacterial infections. Only approximately 12% of fully evaluated reports of infectious disease transmission events in 2013 were ultimately classified as proven or probable (with ~10% classified as possible, ~33% classified as intervention without documented transmission, and 45% classified as unlikely/excluded).3\n\nOverall, the estimated rate of proven/probable unexpected disease transmission events in the United States is low: from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2016, there were 19 proven/probable infectious disease transmission events out of ~15 500 donors (9500 deceased donors), affecting 73 recipients.33 Death in association with a proven/probable infectious disease transmission event occurred in 3 recipients in this 12-month period.33 These numbers are likely, however, to be affected by underrecognition and underreporting of infectious disease transmission events, particularly in the case of the transmission of bacterial pathogens, which may present as transient fevers in the recipient. Infections caused by common pathogens, such as S. aureus may not be recognized as donor-derived, yet transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods are among the most common type of bacterial transmission event, against which standard antimicrobial prophylactic treatment in the recipient is inadequate.1\n\nNOTIFY\n\nThe NOTIFY project, launched in 2010, was a joint initiative of the World Health Organization, the Italian National Transplant Center (CNT) and the EU-funded Vigilance and Surveillance of Substances of Human Origin project. From September 2010 to February 2011, global experts gathered information on documented cases of adverse outcomes in transplantation, and these cases were used as the basis for developing general principles on detection and investigation of adverse events. The NOTIFY website (www.notifylibrary.org) hosts the database of vigilance information collected by the NOTIFY Project. The NOTIFY website is managed by the Italian National Transplant Centre, a WHO Collaborating Centre on Vigilance and Surveillance for Human Cells, Tissues and Organs, and the work of updating the database is carried out by a large group of experts, regulators, and clinicians across the globe. The NOTIFY library is intended to facilitate access to information on vigilance and surveillance derived from organ donation and transplantation programs around the world.\n\nIn February 2015, the Spanish National Transplant Organisation, ONT, and the Catalan Organisation for Transplantation signed an agreement with CNT to support the work of the NOTIFY project, contributing resources and expertise.\n\nCHALLENGES FOR BIOVIGILANCE\n\nOne particular challenge for vigilance and surveillance systems is that the reporting of “donor-derived” transmission events is subject to substantial bias. It will not be clear in many cases whether infection is in fact donor-derived, and whether reporting occurs will depend on the interpretation of the treating physician. Whether notification occurs will then depend on the subjective evaluation of the evidence of a donor-derived transmission event. This may lead to underreporting, or delays in reporting. Where organs are distributed across multiple transplant centers, this may make it even more difficult for infection to be recognized as donor-derived. This emphasizes the importance of a centralized, integrated vigilance and surveillance system, and the need for that system to be capable of flagging multiple reports arising from the same donor in real time.31 The longer that a system is in place the more data inputs it will have to be able to facilitate more accurate decision making in the future. Therefore, the vigilance and surveillance system needs itself to be subject to continuous performance evaluation and improvement.\n\nAlthough vigilance and surveillance systems are primarily concerned with unexpected serious adverse events, data should also be collected for expected transmission events in the case of diseases where the outcome of donor to recipient transmission is incompletely understood, or in circumstances where the epidemiology of the disease is changing.34 A topical example of this would be the transplantation of organs from donors known to be HCV-positive, given the rapidly changing treatment protocols in the event of disease transmission. The data collection goals of the system must be clearly defined and clearly understood by those responsible for reporting events.\n\nLastly, initial reporting processes need to be easy and quick, with full details to be submitted later. It is imperative that the notification of a potential disease transmission event is disseminated as early as possible, and that it not delayed by cumbersome form-filling requirements or system/administrative issues.\n\nData Sources\n\nMajor sources of information on international standards and practices included the NOTIFY Library (The Global Vigilance and Surveillance Database for Medical Products of Human Origin; www.notifylibrary.org), The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines & Health Care Guide to the quality and safety of organs for transplantation (Sixth Edition), the SaBTO Guidance on the microbiological safety of human organs, tissues and cells used in transplantation (2011), and Transplant Infections (Fourth Edition, eds. Ljungman, P., Snydman, D. and Boeckh M.).5,29,34,35 Epidemiological data on infectious disease notification rates and the underlying population prevalence of disease in Australia were obtained from the Communicable Disease Network Australia (CDNA) Australian National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System and other CDNA publications, and the Annual Surveillance reports of The Kirby Institute.36,37 Epidemiological data for New Zealand were obtained from the New Zealand Ministry of Health Institute of Environmental Science and Research Ltd Public Health Observatory, and the Ministry of Health Communicable Disease Control Manual.38-40 International statistics on the prevalence of selected infectious diseases were obtained from the United Nations World Drug Report, AIDSinfo (UNAIDS), and the World Health Organization.22,26\n\nInformation on unexpected infectious disease transmission events involving deceased solid organ donors was obtained by a systematic review of the published literature. Articles reporting on cases of donor-derived infectious disease transmission were identified using the search strategy outline in SDC Materials and Methods 1, http://links.lww.com/TXD/A152. Given the absence of biovigilence systems in most jurisdictions and a general underreporting of disease transmission events in the published literature, the reports identified likely only represent a small proportion of actual disease transmission events. In addition, establishing a true denominator for transmission events is not possible at this time, as this would require the centralized recording of donor disease status for all used donors. At this time, any information that we have on the quantitative risk of disease transmission from organ donors to recipients is based on retrospective record reviews conducted in a research context (usually based on a single center's experience). Given these limitations, reported transmission events are summarized qualitatively. The circumstances of each case, donor characteristics and serological profile, and the outcomes of the recipients are described, and similarities and differences across cases are considered.\n\nDECEASED DONOR EVALUATION FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE RISK\n\nDonor Medical History and Behavioral Risk Evaluation\n\nInfectious disease transmission risk is assessed via careful review of the potential donor's medical and social history.41 The results of cultures and other assays to detect and diagnose infection must be interpreted in the context of the patient's full history, and the probability of false-negative results needs to be considered against the donor's background of any reported risk factors, such as IVDU or high-risk sexual contact. Close attention must also be paid to travel history: potential donors with recent travel to or previous residence in areas where they may have been exposed to endemic pathogens—Strongyloides stercoralis, Schistosoma spp., malaria, Trypanosoma cruzi, or endemic mycoses, for example—warrant additional screening. It is, therefore, essential that the social history is obtained from someone close to the potential donor, and an assessment should be made of how well the person knows the donor.7 The American Association of Tissue Banks has developed guidelines for donor risk assessment interviews.42 In Australia, the social history is captured in a nationally standardized form as part of the electronic donor record (EDR) and is completed by the Donor Coordinator (http://www.tsanz.com.au/downloads/Protocols_Appendix1.pdf).\n\nIn the event of positive test results or the existence of behavioral risk factors, decisions about whether to use a potential donor's organs need to be weighed in the context of the risk tolerance and medical status of the potential recipient(s).7 Different thresholds for an acceptable level of risk will apply to a potential recipient for whom the transmission of an infectious disease would be a devastating outcome versus a potential recipient for whom this may be their only chance at transplantation and would otherwise die on the waiting list.\n\nScreening for Infectious Disease in Deceased Donors: Overview\n\nPretransplant screening of both donors and recipients is necessary to identify any diseases/conditions that (i) preclude transplantation, or (ii) require treatment, prophylaxis, immunization, and/or monitoring. It is necessary to test for both active and latent infections in donors and recipients before initiation of immunosuppression, though the implications of a positive test will vary depending on the organ to be transplanted. Routine donor screening generally includes tests for CMV, EBV, HIV, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), syphilis (T. pallidum), and Toxoplasma gondii in the case of potential heart donors.\n\nThe goals and priorities of infectious disease screening in organ donors differ from the screening of blood donors in several important ways. First, the timeline for donor screening is restricted to less than 12 to 18 hours, whereas blood donor screening can take place 24 to 48 hours after donation and samples can be screened in batches. Second, blood donors are able to give their medical and social history via statutory declaration, whereas for deceased donors this is provided by friends or family, who may be unaware of a history of drug use or high-risk sexual contact. Thirdly, the goal of blood donor screening is to achieve zero risk of disease transmission to recipients of blood transfusions, whereas in the context of organ transplantation there is a trade-off to be made between residual risk of disease transmission and the urgency of organ transplantation.\n\nScreening protocols in organ transplantation are, therefore, required to reduce the risk of infectious disease transmission to an acceptable level (without necessarily eliminating risk completely) while keeping turnaround time under ~12 hours. Another key consideration for screening protocols is the serological window for BBV—the period from infection to the time that the individual develops antibodies that can be detected by serological testing. During this window, a potential donor may be seronegative (and, therefore, will test negative for disease based on serological tests) but is still able to transmit infection (see Figure ).\n\nFigure shows the serological and NAT windows for HIV, HCV and HBV. The eclipse period refers to the preramp phase and the portion of the ramp-up/exponential phase where the viral titer in peripheral blood has not yet reached levels that are detectable by NAT. Once the viral titer reaches detectable levels (5–6 days postinfection for HIV, 3–5 days for HCV, and 20–22 days for HBV), the viral load continues to increase until the plateau phase is reached, after which seroconversion occurs. NAT, therefore, significantly reduces the detection window for HIV and HCV, and to a lesser extent for HBV. The serological window for HIV detection is also reduced by the combined antigen/antibody test, which identifies antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2 as well as the presence of HIV-1 p24 antigen, which is shed into the bloodstream at high levels shortly after infection.43 NAT is additionally useful in the context of HCV screening, as a positive HCV-NAT distinguishes active HCV infection from an anti–HCV-positive, NAT-negative result that is indicative of a previous infection that has been cleared. The length of the serological and NAT windows for HIV, HCV and HBV are further specified in Table .\n\nAlthough permitting earlier detection of BBV, until relatively recently the use of NAT in potential organ donors was limited by assay cost, long turnaround times, and high false-positives rates especially among average- to low-risk donors.44 Recent development of new platforms has reduced the cost of NAT and brought turnaround times down to 4 to 6 hours, permitting repeat testing and reducing the false-positive rate. Current international donor screening guidelines, however, retain some variation in their recommendations regarding when NAT is appropriate at this time (see Table ). UK guidelines recommend NAT testing for HIV whenever this is feasible (ie, where turnaround times and logistics permit), and require all donors to be screened using the combined anti-HIV antigen/antibody test at a minimum. European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines and Health Care guidelines also require the combined anti-HIV antigen/antibody test as a minimum requirement, but NAT is recommended only for donors at increased risk of BBV. OPTN requires the anti-HIV antibody test alone for average-risk donors, with NAT or the combined anti-HIV antigen/antibody test required for donors identified as being at increased risk for HIV transmission. OPTN guidelines also allow for exceptions to the HIV screening requirement for organs other than kidneys when the medical urgency of the situation warrants the transplantation of an organ that has not been tested for HIV (policy 2.7.A), provided that (i) all available deceased donor medical information and social history information is provided to the transplant program, and (ii) the deceased donor is treated as having an increased risk for disease transmission in accordance with the US Public Health Services Guidelines. In this circumstance the receiving transplant hospital must obtain documented informed consent from the potential recipient (or their authorized agent) before transplantation can take place.32\n\nBoth OPTN and SaBTO guidelines require HCV-NAT among mandatory tests for all donors, whereas EDQM only recommend NAT for donors at increased risk of HCV infection and donors with an anti-HCV reactive result, to determine whether clearance of viremia exists. Historically, a positive HCV-NAT would have been a contraindication to transplantation. However, with the advent of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) for HCV, this situation is rapidly changing,46 and early trials have demonstrated successful outcomes from the transplantation of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-negative recipients.47 For a detailed discussion see Donor Screening and Utilization.\n\nOnly SaBTO guidelines recommend HBV-NAT as standard. OPTN, SaBTO and EDQM all require HBsAg and anti-HBc screening tests at a minimum. Recently, in the United States, however, there has been a significant increase in HBV-NAT use concurrent with the requirement for HCV-NAT, as most OPOs now use the triplex NAT assay (personal communication M Ison). A positive HBsAg test indicates active infection, and HBV could be transmitted by any organ or tissue in this context. A negative HBsAg test but positive anti-HBc often indicates a cleared infection, and organs from these donors may be transplanted in certain cases with appropriate HBV prophylaxis.\n\nRecommendations for EBV and CMV screening are similar in the United States, UK and Europe. Although CMV and EBV infection are not contraindications to donation, knowing the serostatus of the donor and potential recipient is critical to the implementation of appropriate prophylaxis or other risk reduction strategies. Donor screening should use assays with high sensitivity and specificity for anti-CMV IgG.48 For EBV, assays testing for viral-capsid antigen IgG (VCA IgG) are preferable.49\n\nSimilarly, screening for T. pallidum is mandated for all donors by OPTN, SaBTO, and EDQM. The syphilis testing algorithm described by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is as follows: an initial enzyme immunoassay (EIA) treponemal test (TP-EIA) is performed, with a positive result confirmed by a nontreponemal test such as the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. In the event of a negative RPR test, a second treponemal test should be performed such as the T. pallidum particle agglutination (TP-PA) test. If this second treponemal test is negative, then a third treponemal test should be performed, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody (FTA-ABS). If either the second or third antibody tests are positive then a diagnosis of syphilis is made.50 A positive TP-EIA but negative results on RPR, TP-PA, and FTA-ABS indicate a false-positive result or resolved infection. Such reverse screening approaches are associated with a lower rate of false-positive test results.51\n\nOPTN, SaBTO, and EDQM additionally require testing for anti–T. gondii IgG as standard. Only SaBTO guidelines require testing for anti-HTLV1/2 as standard.\n\nThe TSANZ Clinical Guidelines for Organ Donation and Transplantation from Deceased Donors (April 2016) broadly outline the standard routine investigations and recommended investigations for deceased donors in Australia and New Zealand Table . Organ Donation New Zealand has their own jurisdiction-specific donor screening policy (Table ), as do each of the Australian States and Territories (see Table ). Jurisdiction-specific policies are generally similar to/informed by the TSANZ guidelines, though with some variations as outlined in Table . In all jurisdictions, all donors are required to have serological testing for anti-HIV-1/2 (or the anti HIV Ag/Ab combination test), HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV. As of July 2017, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria routinely order NAT for HIV, HCV, and HBV for all solid organ donors, requiring prospective results in the case of increased-risk donors (retrospective results are acceptable for nonincreased risk-donors). In New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia, urgent (prospective) NAT is required for donors with: (i) evidence of BBV (positive serology or known history), (ii) recent exposure to risk factors for BBV (past ~6 months), or (iii) where medical history is not available.\n\nAll jurisdictions stipulate mandatory prospective anti-CMV testing. NSW, Queensland, SA, and WA also require prospective anti-EBV and anti–T. pallidum testing; Tasmania and New Zealand require retrospective testing for anti-EBV. Jurisdictions are variable with regard to guidelines for HTLV-1/2 testing: NSW recommends HTLV-1/2 testing at the clinician's discretion; New Zealand, Queensland, SA, and Victoria include HTLV-1/2 among mandatory prospective tests; WA lists anti–HTLV-1/2 among additional routine tests (not strictly mandatory); Tasmania recommends retrospective testing for HTLV-1/2. Only Queensland, SA, and WA routinely test for toxoplasmosis; New Zealand includes toxoplasmosis screening among retrospective tests.\n\nThe list of possible pathogens for which potential donors might be screened is very long. Which of these pathogens to screen for depends on whether:\n\n•\n\nThe pathogen is sufficiently prevalent in the population so that screening would be useful;\n\n•\n\nThere is evidence that the pathogen in question can be transmitted by organ transplantation;\n\n•\n\nTransmission of the pathogen would result in significant morbidity and mortality;\n\n•\n\nA sufficiently accurate, rapid and affordable screening test exists;\n\n•\n\nThe agent has a high level of potential harm (eg, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies [TSE], WNV).\n\nFor many of the notable cases of unexpected disease transmission that have occurred in the past decade - including lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), arenavirus and rabies—screening would not be warranted based on the criteria above.34 Furthermore, even when screening is performed as per guidelines, unexpected transmission events can occur. Donor screening may occur during the eclipse or window period of the disease, or screening tests can yield false-negative results (a negative assay result when the true result should be positive, due to unforeseen technical error).53,54 In some urgent cases the risk of waiting for test results may outweigh the risk to the patient of disease transmission. Alternatively, prophylaxis or vaccination may fail, as has happened in several reported cases of posttransplant fulminant HBV associated with mutated strains of the virus that evaded recipient vaccination,55,56 or lamivudine-resistant strains of HBV.57 Human error may also be the reason for unexpected transmission, such as in a 2007 case of HIV transmission in Italy where the donor's HIV-positive status was incorrectly transcribed as negative on their donation record.58\n\nDonor screening can never be strictly fail-safe, which is why (i) screening must be supported by vigilance and surveillance systems that are capable of responding to adverse events if and when they happen, and (ii) the informed consent of recipients is essential (not only in cases where the donor is considered to be at increased risk). Where donor information about behavioral risk factors is incomplete, the donor should be treated in the same way as an increased-risk donor.45\n\nAnother issue for donor screening is hemodilution: where the donor requires multiple blood transfusions or significant infusions of intravenous (IV) fluids before donation, hemodilution may occur such that serum antibodies and targets for PCR are at too low a concentration to be detected. OPTN guidelines state that OPOs must use nonhemodiluted blood samples for the purpose of serological screening of deceased donors wherever possible.59 If only a hemodiluted sample is available, that donor is treated as though they are an increased-risk donor according to the US PHS Guideline (ie, HIV RNA by donor screening, diagnostic NAT, or the HIV antigen/antibody (Ag/Ab) combination test is also required in addition to the standard mandated tests). Other factors may also affect the accuracy of serological test results, such as the suppression of the donor immune response to infection as a consequence of disease or of high steroid dosage. Such factors need to be taken into account when interpreting test results.\n\nAdditional Tests for Consideration Based on Donor History\n\nPotential donors with a history of significant travel to or residence in Africa, the Middle East, Asia or Central/South American may warrant additional screening for pathogens endemic to that area or occurring as epidemic disease. Additional tests that should be considered for donors who have lived in these geographic areas, according to European guidelines, are shown in Table .\n\nIn the United States, targeted T. cruzi screening is recommended for potential donors born in Mexico, Central America and South America.60 Since screening assays for T. cruzi have a high false-positive rate and positive results require laboratory confirmation, which may not be possible within the donation timeframe but can inform posttransplant interventions.7 United States recommendations are that kidneys and livers from potential donors testing positive for T. cruzi be used with the informed consent of the recipient. Given a high rate of transmission in the context of heart transplantation, however, hearts from donors infected with or screen-positive for T. cruzi should not be used.60\n\nDonor Suitability and Recommendations for Organ Allocation\n\nTable compares published guidelines from the UK, Europe and Scandinavia with TSANZ guidelines with respect to recommendations for the utilization of organs from donors testing positive for any of the routinely screened pathogens described in Screening for Infectious Disease in Deceased Donors: Overview. It should be noted that the recommendations described in the table correspond to the most recently published versions of jurisdictional guidelines as of November 2017, but do not reflect more recent changes in policy and practice. Practices with respect to HCV-positive donors in particular are rapidly evolving as a result of the introduction of DAAs able to effectively treat infection in the event of disease transmission (see Recipient Management). With an increasing number of individuals being successfully treated for HCV infection, there will also be a need for revised guidelines to consider donors with a history of treated HCV.\n\nVIRAL INFECTIONS IN THE DECEASED DONOR\n\nHIV, Hepatitis C and Hepatitis B\n\nEpidemiology\n\nThe estimated prevalence of HIV in the Australian population 15 years or older in 2016 was 0.13%37; in New Zealand estimated HIV prevalence in 2016 was 0.08%.62 Rates of HIV infection in Australia and New Zealand are relatively low by international standards: estimated HIV prevalence in the overall UK population in 2015 was 0.16%, and in the United States population 13 years or older it was 0.4%.63,64 Comparing HIV prevalence among high-risk groups, estimated rates of HIV among IVDU in Australia and New Zealand are very low compared to other high-income countries (1.7% and 0.2% respectively see Figure ). In contrast, the estimated prevalence of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Australia is relatively high (18.3%); in New Zealand the estimated prevalence of HIV among MSM is lower at 6.5%.26\n\nHCV prevalence is similar in Australia and New Zealand, with an estimated viremic prevalence of approximately 1.0% in the adult populations of both countries in 2015.37 Figure compares viremic prevalence of HCV in 2015 across high-income countries for which estimates were available (estimates published by The Polaris Observatory HCV Collaborators).65 Estimated HCV prevalence in Australia and New Zealand is relatively high compared to other high-income countries; the only high-income country with higher estimated viremic prevalence in 2015 was Italy (1.1%). Estimated HCV prevalence in the United States and the UK was 0.9% and 0.3% respectively. Globally, the countries with the highest estimated viremic prevalence of HCV in 2015 were Gabon (7%), Mongolia (6.4%), Egypt (6.3%), Uzbekistan (4.3%), Georgia (4.2%), Pakistan (3.8%), and Russia (3.3%).65\n\nThe estimated prevalence of HBV in Australia in 2016 was 0.9%.37 Prevalence of HBV is much higher in New Zealand (~4%), related to immigration from highly endemic countries in the Pacific region.66 Kiribati, Nauru, Niue, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga and Vanuatu in particular have some of the highest rates of chronic HBV prevalence in the world, affecting between 12% and 23% of the total populations of these countries.66\n\nThe risk of BBV transmission from a solid organ donor to a recipient is dependent on the incidence, prevalence, and distribution of the virus in the donor population, the viral load in the donor, the specific organ transplanted, and the efficiency of virus transmission through contact with blood and tissues. Historically, organ transplant systems in several countries have attempted to mitigate this risk by categorizing potential donors as either increased-risk or standard-risk with respect to their potential to transmit BBV, then screening increased-risk donors using NAT to minimize the possibility of a window period transmission. Stratification of potential donors according to their risk of BBV also has the advantage of simplifying the patient consent process. Risk of BBV is generally defined according to the presence of the following risk factors:\n\n•\n\nMSM\n\n•\n\nIVDU\n\n•\n\nIncarceration in the previous 12 months\n\n•\n\nSexual partners of those in the categories above\n\n•\n\nUnexplained fever/weight loss/cough etc.\n\n•\n\nPartner with HIV/HBV/HCV\n\n•\n\nSex workers\n\n•\n\nsexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past 12 months\n\n•\n\nCosmetic body piercing/tattooing\n\n•\n\nCocaine snorting\n\n•\n\nPhysician concern (based on medical history or physical examination).\n\nThe United States PHS published Guidelines for Preventing Transmission of Human Immunodeficiency Virus through Transplantation of Human Tissue and Organs in 1994, with an update subsequently published in 2013, and implemented in 2014.45 These evidence-based guidelines outline behavioral and medical characteristics of the donor that put them at increased risk of transmitting a BBV, and have been widely cited as a basis for donor screening policies, including in Australia (see Table ).\n\nThere are, however, problems with a binary risk-stratification approach. First, the extent to which next of kin are aware of illicit drug use and sexual history will often be limited, and misreported social histories are likely to translate into the systematic misclassification of many potential donors as standard-risk. Secondly, criteria defining “increased-risk” are broadly inclusive and define a large proportion of the potential donor population. For example the PHS criterion of “people who have been newly diagnosed with, or have been treated for, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia or genital ulcers in the preceding 12 months” alone accounts for nearly 10% of the US adult population. Under the PHS Guidelines outlined in Table , 19.5% of potential donors were labeled as increased-risk in 2014.13 Third, labeling organs as “increased-risk” has an impact on organ utilization as patients and physicians tend to be risk averse when it comes to acceptance decisions, despite the very low absolute risks of infectious disease transmission.67 This risk aversion may be particularly pronounced when referring to stigmatized social behaviors (IVDU) and stigmatized diseases (HIV and HCV).13 The criteria above, therefore, describe a large proportion of the population, yet the risk factors stipulated will be routinely underreported by next of kin; further, despite systematic misclassification, patients and physicians will place undue emphasis on an “increased-risk” label when making acceptance decisions.\n\nThe challenge of mitigating the risk of BBV transmission is, therefore, a complex one, and one that is constantly evolving as social norms change and as the capacity to effectively treat disease in the event of disease transmission improves. For now, however, there remains a strong focus on population groups at increased risk of BBV, and therefore, it is important to have an accurate understanding of the current epidemiology of HIV, HCV and HBV in Australia and New Zealand.\n\nBBV in Australia\n\nAfter a spike in 2012, the number of newly diagnosed HIV infections in Australia has remained steady, with 1013 new cases diagnosed in 2016, 1027 in 2015, 1084 in 2014, and 1030 in 2013.37 Of the estimated 26 444 people estimated to be living with HIV in Australia in 2016, an estimated 75% of these infections are attributable to male-to-male sex exposure. Heterosexual sex accounts for approximately 22% of cases, IVDU for 2%, and other exposures (eg, sex work) for <1%.37 Of all diagnoses of HIV notified since 1984, 91% were in males. Notification rates in 2016 were highest among males in the 20- to 29-year age group (17.1 per 100 000), followed by the 30- to 39-year age group (16.1 per 100 000). Of the total number of new HIV diagnoses in 2016, 5% were in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) people. HIV prevalence among ATSI people was estimated to be 0.11% in 2016.\n\nIt is estimated that nearly 90% of all HIV cases are diagnosed, and that of diagnosed cases 86% were receiving antiretroviral therapy as of 31 December 2016.37 The proportion of HIV-infected persons taking effective treatments and achieving a suppressed viral load has increased significantly over the past 10 years. Of those on antiviral therapy, 93% had a suppressed viral load, corresponding to 72% of all people living with HIV in Australia having a suppressed viral load.37 In addition, large, state-funded preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation programs were rolled out in 2016 in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. By the end of 2016, 23% of all estimated gay men at high risk of HIV according to PrEP eligibility criteria were taking PrEP.37 It is likely that this will effect a reduction in HIV incidence in Australia in coming years. Already in NSW, an overall 11% decline in new HIV diagnoses was observed in 2017 compared to the previous 6-year average, whereas among Australian-born MSM, the number of new diagnoses was 19% less in 2017 compared with the previous 6-year average.68 A decline in new HIV diagnoses was not observed in overseas-born MSM, however, nor among heterosexual people. The number of heterosexually acquired infections in NSW with an early diagnosis was has remained stable since 2011, but the number of new diagnoses with non–early-stage infection increased 31% in 2017 compared to the previous 6-year average.68\n\nHCV infections in Australia are concentrated among IVDU, prisoners with a history of IVDU, people from high-prevalence countries, and HIV-positive MSM. In contrast to HIV trends, HCV notifications in Australia fell consistently between 2005 and 2012,69 a trend which is thought to have been largely driven by a decrease in the number of people newly initiating injecting drug use. Some of this decrease may also be due to an increased use of needle and syringe programs. Since 2012, the HCV notification rate had remained steady; however, a spike in notifications was observed in 2016 that is likely to be attributable to an increase in the number of people being newly tested for HCV in response to the availability of new DAA treatments. The majority (67%) of HCV notifications in 2016 occurred in males, with the highest notification rate in the 25- to 29-year age group (84.6 per 100 000), followed by the 40+ years age group (56.4 per 100 000).37 Nine percent of HCV notifications occurred among ATSI people.\n\nInterferon-free DAA regimens became available on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme in Australia from March 2016. Of an estimated 227 306 people living with HCV in Australia at the start of 2016, 32 550 received treatment and 30 434 (93%) were cured, reducing the number living with chronic HCV at the end of 2016 to 199 412 (a decline in prevalence of 13%).37 The uptake of HCV treatment in 2016 compared with previous years is illustrated in Figure . Importantly, according to the Australian Needle and Syringe Program Survey in 2016, there was an 11-fold increase in the rate of HCV-treatment among respondents with self-reported chronic HCV, from 2% in 2015 to 22% in 2016. The expanded availability of DAAs has an immediate impact on mortality associated with HCV: among people living with chronic HCV and those who have been cured of chronic HCV, the estimated number of HCV-related deaths approximately doubled between 2007 and 2015, but between 2015 and 2016 this number fell by 26%.\n\nHBV notifications have been declining over the past decade in younger age groups due to the impact of vaccination programs. The greatest decline in newly acquired HBV cases has been in the 20- to 24-year age group (females in particular). Chronic HBV cases in Australia are concentrated among 4 key populations: migrants from high prevalence countries (especially Northeast and Southeast Asia), people who inject drugs, ATSI peoples, and MSM. Of the estimated 233 034 people living in Australia with chronic HBV infection at the end of 2016, 38% were born in the Asia-Pacific, 9.3% were ATSI peoples, 6% were IVDUs and 4% were MSM.37\n\nAustralia-wide age- and sex-specific notification rates for HIV, HCV and HBV are shown in Figure . Age groups with the highest notification rates will have the highest residual risk of BBV transmission after donor screening. For example, the highest residual risk of HIV transmission would be among male donors aged 25 to 30 years. The highest residual risk of HCV transmission would be for male donors aged 35 to 40 years.\n\nRates of BBV Infection in Increased-risk Groups\n\nMSM\n\nSexual contact between men is the main route of HIV transmission in Australia, accounting for 70% of all new cases in 2016.37 Overall incidence of HIV among MSM in Australia was 0.85 per 100 person years in 2016, a rate which had not changed significantly for the prior 6 years.69 The roll-out of expanded access to PrEP in 2016, however, has started to effect a decline in the number of new HIV diagnoses among Australian-born MSM—in NSW in 2017, the number of MSM newly diagnosed with HIV declined by 19% compared with the 2011 to 2016 average.68 However, this decline did not extend to overseas-born MSM, among whom the number of new diagnoses increased 12% in 2017 compared to the 2011 to 2016 average.68 In NSW in 2017, the number of newly diagnosed MSM who were born overseas exceeded the number of new diagnoses in Australian-born MSM (135 vs 97).68 Regions of birth for MSM newly diagnosed with HIV in 2017 in NSW were Australia (41%), southeast Asia (17%), northeast Asia (14%), southern and central America (8%), southern and eastern Europe (6%), northern and western Europe (5%), and less than 5% from all other regions.68\n\nMen who have sex with men are also significantly more likely to have HBV compared to the population overall, with an estimated chronic HBV prevalence of 3.0% versus 0.9% in the general population.68 Based on a community-based cohort of MSM with serum samples stored between 2001 and 2007, the overall prevalence of HCV among MSM in Sydney was approximately 1% (or 2% when restricted to men 35 years and older); however, the rate among those who were HIV-positive was nearly 10 times that of those who are HIV-negative (HCV prevalence of 9.4% vs 1.1%).70 In this study, IVDU was strongly associated with HCV seropositivity in MSM regardless of HIV-status.70\n\nIVDU\n\nStrategies to reduce HIV transmission among the IVDU population in Australia have been very successful. In 2016, IVDUs (without a history of male-to-male sex) accounted for only 14 new HIV diagnoses (1% of the total); IVDUs who also reported male-to-male sex accounted for an additional 51 new diagnoses (5% of the total).37 The prevalence of HIV in the IVDU population was 1.4% in 2016, or 0.7% if gay and bisexual men are excluded.37 This is far lower than the HIV prevalence among IVDUs in the United States (9%), or Europe (11%).22\n\nIn contrast, the prevalence of HCV among IVDUs attending needle and syringe programs remained steady between 2009 and 2016 at 50% to 57%.37,69 An overall decline in the absolute number of HCV notifications attributable to injecting drug users is thought to be due to a reduction in the number of people initiating injecting drug use and a simultaneous increase in the number of people receiving opioid substitution therapy, rather than an actual decline in the HCV infection rate in the IVDU population. Prevalence of HBV among IVDU in 2016 was 4.0%.37\n\nPrison Population\n\nThere were no cases of HIV detected among 793 of 1235 prison entrants screened as part of the most recent Australian National Prison Entrants' Bloodborne Virus Survey.71 The overall prevalence of HCV in the prison population was 31% in 2013, up from 22% in 2010, and was highest among those with a history of IVDU (58% in IVDUs vs 4% in non-IVDUs). HCV rates were also higher among female inmates with a history of IVDU versus males with a history of IVDU (67% vs 56%). HBV prevalence is also relatively high among prisoners. Nationally, 18% of those tested under the National Prison Entrants' Bloodborne Virus Survey in 2013 were positive for HBV core antibody, and 3% (all male) were positive for HBV surface-antigen.71\n\nAboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders\n\nThe rate of HIV notifications was higher in the ATSI population in 2016 than in the Australian-born, non-Indigenous population (6.4 vs 2.9 per 100 000).37 Whereas HIV notification rates in the Australian-born, non-Indigenous population have declined since 2014, in the ATSI population there has been a steady increase in the annual HIV notification rate over the past 5 years.37 A higher proportion of HIV notifications in this population are attributable to heterosexual sex (20%) and IVDU (14%) than in the Australian-born non-Indigenous population (15% and 3% respectively). HIV prevalence, however, was the same in the ATSI population in 2016 as in the Australian-born, non-Indigenous population (0.11%).37\n\nWhereas the HCV notification rate for the Australian population overall has been has been declining for the past 10 years, the rate of HCV notifications among ATSI people has been increasing, and in 2016 was nearly 4-times greater than for the non-Indigenous population (172.7 vs 45.2 notifications per 100 000).37\n\nThe estimated prevalence of HBV in ATSI people in 2016 was 3.7%, versus 0.2% in the Australian-born, non-Indigenous population.37 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people accounted for 10.6% of people living with chronic HBV infections in Australia in 2016.37\n\nBBV in New Zealand\n\nIn 2016 there were 244 HIV notifications in New Zealand (217 men, 27 women; 30 previously diagnosed overseas).62 Of new diagnoses, 159 (65%) were infected through male to male sex, 42 (17%) were infected through heterosexual contact, 1 person was infected through IVDU, and 5 men were infected either through sex with another man or IVDU.62 The number of MSM newly infected with HIV each year in New Zealand has substantially increased since 2013, and in 2016 was the highest ever. Of all 159 MSM first diagnosed with HIV in 2016, 60% were European, 20% Asian, 9% Māori, 4% Pacific Islander, and 7% other ethnicities. The majority (59%) were living in Auckland; 13% were living in Wellington. A study of gay and bisexual men in Auckland found an HIV prevalence in this population of 6.5%, with 21% be unaware that they were infected.72 The overall distribution of HIV notifications in New Zealand in 2016 by risk exposure type and ethnicity are shown in Figure .\n\nThere were 2278 adults (1898 men and 380 women) and 16 children receiving subsidized antiretroviral therapy at the end of June 2016. On the basis that ~80% of people with HIV in New Zealand have been diagnosed and are under specialist care, and ~85% of people with HIV who are under specialist care are receiving antiretroviral therapy, it is estimated that there were about 3500 people with HIV in New Zealand at the end of 2016, or a population prevalence of 0.077%.62\n\nHCV prevalence in New Zealand is approximately 1.0%. After falling steeply from 1998 to 2004, HCV notification rates in New Zealand have remained steady at 0.4 to 0.8 cases per 100 000 population for the past decade (vs 2.4 cases per 100 000 in 1998).38 HCV is highly prevalent among IVDUs in New Zealand. A 2015 study of HCV serology among IVDUs attending drug clinics in the lower north island found that, of 579 patients tested, 439 (76%) were positive for HCV antibody.73 Of those with a PCR/viral load test on file, 50% had a positive result on their most recent test, and 32% had cleared their HCV infection without treatment. Of those who were referred and treated, 75% had achieved viral clearance.73\n\nHBV notifications in New Zealand have gradually declined over the past 2 decades, from 2.3 per 100 000 population in 1998, to 0.7 per 100 000 population in 2015.38 The relatively high prevalence of chronic HBV infection in New Zealand (~4%) is attributable to the high rates of HBV among immigrant populations from the highly endemic countries of the Pacific region, such as Kiribati, Nauru, Solomon Islands and Tonga, where up to a quarter of the population are chronically infected with HBV.66\n\nBBV Prevalence and Risk Factors among Donor Referrals\n\nA recent retrospective analysis of the NSW Organ and Tissue Donation Service logs found that 10% (309/2995) of all organ donor referrals from 2010 to 2015 had a reported history of BBV and/or social risk factors for BBV.74 The proportion of all donor referrals with a documented history of increased-risk behavior was 7.5% (224/2995), whereas the proportion with a known history of BBV was 6.4% (192/2995). The most common reported infection among referrals with a known history of BBV was HCV (84% of BBV diagnoses), with 19% of referrals having HBV and 3% having HIV. Of referrals with reported BBV, 10% reported more than 1 infection. The most commonly reported social risk factor for BBV was IVDU (84% of increased-risk donors, n = 191), followed by incarceration (11%), sexual partner in an at-risk category (6%), and MSM (3%).\n\nOf the increased-risk referrals with a documented history of BBV and/or social risk factors for BBV, 16% (48/309) became actual donors. Of referrals with social risk factors but no history of BBV, 26% (n = 30) became actual donors. Overall, 3.3% (100/2995) of all referrals did not proceed primarily due to concern over BBV transmission risk. However, of the 100 increased-risk referrals that did not proceed primarily due to concerns about BBV transmission risk, only 15% had serology and/or NAT performed. Limiting the analysis to referrals with social risk factors only (no history of BBV), of the 33 referrals that did not proceed due to perceived BBV risk, 9% had serology and/or NAT performed. This means that from 2010 to 2015 in NSW there were 30 donor referrals where the donor had social risk factors for BBV but no documented history of BBV, who were ruled out from proceeding down the donation pathway on the basis of perceived BBV risk, but were not tested for presence of BBV.\n\nBy comparison, a similar study conducted in the United Kingdom found 3.8% of potential deceased donors had a documented history of increased-risk behavior, and 1.7% were seropositive for BBV markers.75 The most common social risk factor was IVDU (47% of increased-risk potential donors), followed by incarceration (33%), and MSM (10%). Of potential donors who were seronegative for BBV, those with a history of IVDU were significantly less likely to become actual donors, after taking into account age and comorbidity.75\n\nTable shows the proportions of potential organ donors tested at South Eastern Area Laboratory Services (SEALS) that were positive for BBV in 2010. The finding of only 3.2% testing positive for HCV RNA suggests that increased-risk donors, especially those with a history of IVDU, form a small minority of those referred for NAT in NSW. This could either be the result of underreferral of potential donors at increased risk of BBV, or routine referral of potential donors at low risk of BBV for NAT, despite current guidelines.\n\nDonor Screening and Utilization\n\nUntil recently, a key question for BBV screening in potential solid organ donors was whether NAT should be performed routinely for all potential donors, or whether it should be reserved for potential donors known to be at increased risk. Risk-benefit modeling by Humar et al published in 2010 predicted that NAT in average-risk donors would result in a net loss of quality-adjusted life years, as the number of false-positives would outweigh the number of transmission events averted.44 By comparison, among increased-risk donors, higher incidence of BBV means a much higher chance of window period infection, thus NAT significantly reduces residual transmission risk and increases organ utilization by providing reassurance to physicians and patients who would otherwise be reluctant to accept these organs.\n\nThe recent introduction of newer-generation NAT systems—including the Cobas 6800 system from Roche Molecular Systems (currently used by SEALS) and the Panther system from Hologic—have reduced turnaround time to 3.5 hours, which is short enough to permit confirmatory testing within a timeframe suitable for organ donation.76 Additional features of the Cobas 6800 system include a range of features that will reduce contamination risk and allow continuous sample loading (rather that batch runs). Using this new machine in conjunction with repeat/parallel testing protocols should effectively reduce the false-positive rate to negligible levels, and should permit prospective NAT for all organ donors.77,78\n\nThe Cobas 6800 system is now in use in NSW, Queensland and Western Australia, and NAT is already routinely ordered for all potential solid organ donors in Queensland. With the introduction of newer-generation NAT, the rationale for selective NAT testing is largely redundant, as donor losses due to false-positive tests are predicted to be rare using the new systems. Furthermore, most of the unexpected donor-derived BBV transmission events reported over the past 20 years (excluding those due to human error) occurred due to window period infections in donors with incomplete social histories or without known risk factors for BBV (see Transmission Risk). Selective NAT would not have averted such adverse events.\n\nHIV\n\nSerological screening for HIV should be performed using a fourth-generation antigen/antibody combination immunoassay which identifies antibodies against both HIV-1 and HIV-2, as well as the presence of p24 antigen, which is detectable in the bloodstream shortly after infection. The serological window from HIV exposure to the development of HIV antibodies ranges from approximately 3 weeks to up to 6 months (average window period of 17–22 days); however, p24 antigen can be detected ~7 to 16 days after infection.44 NAT permits detection of acute HIV infection within 5.6 to 10.2 days of exposure.79 If an initial test is positive, this result should be confirmed with subsequent testing.\n\nNeither negative serology nor negative NAT can entirely exclude the possibility of donor transmission of HIV, as there is always the risk that the donor recently acquired an infection that is still in the eclipse phase. This risk is a function of the underlying incidence of HIV in the population; that is, the lower the incidence of HIV, the lower the risk of window period infection. This risk has been estimated for the United States and Canadian populations80,81 and more recently for the Australian population (personal communication Karen Waller). The estimates calculated by Waller et al are based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of HIV incidence and prevalence in Australia, which was used to estimate the pooled incidence of HIV among various increased risk groups in the population, and the estimate was then applied in the following formula:\n\nThe risks of window period infection calculated by Waller et al are reported in Table . These estimates are provided in this report ahead of final publication, and therefore, are preliminary estimates that may be subject to minor revisions. It should also be noted that, given the rapid scale-up of PrEP in NSW and Victoria in recent years, HIV incidence is likely to decline and the residual risk of HIV transmission in Australia is expected to fall in the future and thus these figures may somewhat overestimate true contemporary residual risk.\n\nHCV\n\nThe serological window for HCV antibody detection is long: at least 40 to 70 days. NAT reduces the HCV detection window to ~4 to 6 days and is highly sensitive, allowing for HCV RNA detection at levels as low as 2.0 to 9.4 IU/mL.44,82,83 The ~10-fold reduction in the HCV detection window using NAT versus serological tests corresponds to a 10-fold reduction in the residual risk of HCV transmission.82 Current TSANZ Guidelines recommend screening for anti-HCV in standard-risk donors, with HCV-NAT recommended for increased-risk donors. The highest-risk group for HCV transmission in Australia and New Zealand is IVDUs.\n\nA positive HCV-NAT with or without a positive anti-HCV is an indication of active HCV infection. However, viral loads can fluctuate in HCV-infected people, sometimes falling below the NAT detection limit. Therefore, a negative HCV-NAT cannot alone be used to rule out HCV infection—anti-HCV results are also required. A positive anti-HCV with a negative HCV-NAT can indicate a resolved infection, a false-positive anti-HCV result, or an active infection with a viral load below the detection threshold for NAT (see Table ). The false-positive rate for HCV-NAT in the Australian and New Zealand population is not known; in the United States it has been estimated at <0.2%.46 An HCV infection is considered resolved when a person has been free of the virus for >12 weeks (demonstrated by 2 blood tests 12 weeks apart), with no new risk exposure over this interval.\n\nCurrently published international guidelines state that organs from HCV-positive donors may be used for HCV-positive recipients, given evidence of minimal impact on transplant outcomes in this context.84-86 TSANZ guidelines also allow for transplantation of organs from HCV-NAT-negative, HCV antibody-positive donors to HCV-negative recipients in exceptional circumstances. Of actual organ donors in Australia and New Zealand in 2016, 3% (n = 18) were HCV-antibody–positive.87 Currently, organs from HCV-NAT–positive donors are not formally acceptable for use in HCV-negative recipients except in exceptional circumstances, given the 100% infectivity rate and historical evidence of poor posttransplant outcomes.88-90 However, the availability of DAAs able to successfully eradicate HCV infection in transplant recipients means that policies are rapidly changing, and the utilization of HCV-NAT-positive donors for both HCV-positive and HCV-negative recipients is likely to increase in future (see Recipient Management). Successful treatment of HCV in the community will also have the effect of diminishing the residual risk of donor-derived HCV infection over the next few years. Nonetheless, it will remain important to accurately identify active HCV infection in donors, ideally prospectively, to inform recipient management posttransplant.\n\nHBV\n\nHBV is an enveloped DNA virus consisting of surface and core. The surface incorporates the envelope protein, or hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). The core contains a DNA polymerase, double-stranded DNA, a core antigen (HBcAg) and another antigen called “e” (HBeAg). When screening for HBV in potential organ donors, testing for HBsAg, HBsAb, and antibody to HBcAb (anti-HBc) are all required to identify and distinguish between current infection and prior cleared infection.91 Serology that is positive for HBsAg indicates a current HBV infection, and in the absence of preventative measures, HBV may be transmitted by any organ or tissue in this scenario (see Table ). Anti-HBc of IgM class indicates a current or recent infection with HBV, whereas anti-HBc of IgG class indicates a past infection. The presence of hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) in the blood is indicative of an immunologic response to HBsAg, and the higher the HBsAb titer, the lower the infectious risk associated with anti–HBc-positive donors.\n\nIndividuals who have cleared a natural HBV infection typically become HBsAg-negative, anti–HBc-positive, and have an HBsAb titer greater than 10 IU/L. However, a donor serological profile with an isolated presence of anti-HBc may also indicate a current HBV infection at a point where HBsAg is no longer detectable in peripheral blood but HBsAb titers have not yet reached levels sufficient to clear the virus (or to be detected).91 Presence of anti-HBc, therefore, carries the possibility of HBV transmission, although the extent of this risk depends on the organ being transplanted. The liver is a reservoir for HBV, with the HBV genome forming a stable microchromosome—the covalently closed circular DNA—in the hepatocyte nucleus, meaning that the immune system is unable to completely eradicate the infection. Thus in anti–HBc-positive donors the hepatocytes are latently infected with HBV, and reactivation may occur at any time in immunosuppressed patients.92,93 Guidelines, therefore, recommend livers from anti–HBc-positive donors be used for recipients with previous HBV infection or for recipients who have been successfully vaccinated.5\n\nNonliver grafts from anti–HBc-positive donors with a cleared infection rarely transmit HBV; however, current international guidelines recommend that organs from such donors preferentially be used in recipients with current or previous HBV infection or successful vaccination (see Table ). Nonliver organs may be used for HBV-naïve recipients after informed consent and with special monitoring of the recipient for the appearance of HBV, with or without hepatitis B hyper Immune-immunoglobulin (HBIG) and antiviral prophylaxis. Current TSANZ policy is that anti–HBc-positive donors may be accepted with caution after specialist advice, taking into account the recipient HBsAb titer.52 HBsAg-positive donors can be considered for HBsAg-positive recipients, or for HBsAg-negative recipients in exceptional circumstances after specialist advice. This position is similar to that of the UK and Europe.5,29\n\nAs a first-line screening tool, HBV-NAT has a relatively minor benefit in countries with low endemic rates of HBV. HBsAg assays have a detection window of 35 to 44 days; NAT reduces this window to 20 to 22 days.44 Nucleic acid testing is still useful, however, because it will detect viral replication in potential donors who are anti–HBc-positive but HbsAg-negative, that is, where the immune response has not entirely cleared the infection.94 Occult HBV infection occurs where there is persistence of HBV DNA in the liver, and is characterized by undetectable HBsAg and low-level plasma HBV DNA.95 Approximately 50% of occult HBV infections are positive for anti-HBc, but about 20% are negative for all serological markers of HBV except for HBV DNA.96 If HBV-NAT is positive, donors should be treated as if they were HBsAg-positive. If HBV-NAT is negative, transplantation can proceed with considered given to antiviral therapy and/or HBIG treatment for the recipient, unless the recipient is already immune.5\n\nWhat constitutes a protective HBsAb level for preventing HBV transmission has not been precisely determined: a threshold of greater than 10 IU/L has been demonstrated to be protective for recipients of anti–HBc-positive kidneys; however, in liver recipients, a threshold of HBsAb greater than 100 IU/L is often applied.97 In 1 study, the risk of anti-HBc seroconversion postliver transplant was 4% when pretransplant HBsAb titers in the recipient were >100 IU/L, and 10% when pretransplant titers were less than 100 IU/L.98\n\nTransmission Risk\n\nHIV\n\nTable summarizes published reports of unexpected HIV transmission from deceased donors to recipients. Reports were identified as per the search strategy described in Materials and Methods 1, SDC (http://links.lww.com/TXD/A152). Given that transmission events are not systematically reported in peer-reviewed journals, it is unlikely that Table captures all cases of unexpected HIV transmission. Furthermore, given the limited number of case reports it is also difficult to draw conclusions about rates of mortality and graft failure resulting from donor-derived HIV transmission. For this reason, as descriptive summary of these case reports is provided only.\n\nThe relatively large number of reports of donor-derived HIV transmission around the mid-198"
