        "text": "Choosing a name for your son may be one of the most enjoyable (although sometimes tricky) decisions youâll make when youâre about to become a parent. You may have heard all the popular and common names out there, but perhaps youâre in search of a baby boysâ name thatâs more original, unusual or rare. To make your search easier, weâve compiled the ultimate list of unique boy names with their meanings.\n\nPopular Yet Unique Baby Boy Names\n\nWhile it may seem like an oxymoron, giving your little boy a fashionable yet unique name is possible. If youâre looking for a way to make your baby boy stand out while ensuring he still fits into his generation, check out our list of the most popular yet unique names for boys in the United Kingdom in recent years:\n\n1. Roman. This unique boysâ name has become increasingly popular in the UK in recent years â possibly due to its strong and masculine vibe. It literally means âRomanâ, and is also a popular choice in the United States, Poland and Ukraine.\n\n2. Arlo. The origins of the name Arlo are disputed. Some believe it refers to the Irish town Aherlow, meaning âbetween two hillsâ while others credit the fictional âArlo Hillâ from the epic poem The Faerie Queene written by Edmund Spenser in the sixteenth century. 3. Sebastian. A popular name in Europe for centuries, Sebastian means âfrom Sebasteâ, a town in modern-day Turkey. It also means âvenerableâ in Greek. 4. Luca. Luca means âman from Lucaniaâ. Itâs the Italian version of Luke or Lucas, which makes for a unique option for lovers of Italian boy names. 5. Ezra. Why not opt for a unique biblical name for your boy? Meaning âhelpâ or helperâ in Hebrew, Ezra could be the perfect fit for your friendly little boy. 6. Jaxon. Derived from the Old English name Jason, both spellings can be found throughout English-speaking parts of the world, but Jaxon adds a unique spin to the more common boysâ name. 7. Albie. With its meaning âwhiteâ in Latin, Albie can be a great unique name for both boys and girls. It is the shortened form of the Germanic name Albert, which is thought to derive from Adalbrecht. 8. Logan. A surname derived from a Scottish place, Logan means âlittle hollowâ in Gaelic. Itâs an adorable meaning and a stately name. 9. Reuben. As trendy as ever, the biblical name Reuben means âbehold, a sonâ. Other spellings include Ruben and Rubin. 10. Ellis. Popular as both a boy and girl name in the UK, Ellis is derived from the Welsh word meaning âbenevolentâ. It can also be spelt Elis.\n\nRetro and Uncommon Baby Boy Names\n\nWant a unique and old-fashioned boysâ name that exudes that vintage charm? Take a look at these rare and unusual baby boy names: 11. Alfred. This name was popular in England and Wales around the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, but maybe itâs time for a comeback? You might remember Alfred the Great from history lessons at school â he was the mediaeval king who (legend has it) burnt some cakes entrusted to him by a peasant woman who was sheltering him. Apart from the odd kitchen disaster, though, Alfred is known to have been a wise ruler and protector of the weak. 12. Benedict. This Latin name entered England in the 12th century and became a popular name choice; however, it has decreased in popularity since then, making way for Benjamin and Ben. But why not bring this classic and rare boysâ name back? You even have famous actor Benedict Cumberbatch as a cool namesake. 13. Ernest. Even with its meaning of âseriousâ from the English word earnest, this unique boysâ name still manages to have a cute vintage vibe. And if youâre a bookworm, you may recognise this name from the American author Ernest Hemingway and the character in Oscar Wildeâs The Importance of Being Earnest. 14. Kendrick. The boyâs name Kendrick may have several origins â including Old English, Welsh and Gaelic â but wherever it comes from, this name has an ancient, classic ring to it that radiates strength and refinement.\n\n15. Octavius. Even though this rare name means âeighthâ in Latin, your baby boy doesnât have to be the eighth child to bear this noble Roman name. Before he ruled Rome, Emperor Augustus was called Octavius.\n\n16. Orson. Orson is a diminutive word derived from the Latin word for bear (ursus), so it means âbear cub.â This name is as cute as a teddy bear, but it also sounds strong and dignified.\n\n17. Reggie. This name is a shortened version of Reginald from an ancient Germanic word for âKingâ. Both the long and the short versions of this name have been growing popular again more recently. 18. Riggs. Originally an Old English surname, Riggs meant someone living at a place called Ridge â either a village of that name or the actual ridge of a hill, for example. Nowadays though, itâs increasingly popular as a first name too.\n\nStrong and Unusual Boy Names\n\nInterested in something powerful and different for your son? Pick one of these strong and unusual baby boy names: 19. Atlas. In Greek mythology, Atlas was a famous Titan who carried the heavens on his shoulders, although he is often depicted holding up the world too. Either way, this name certainly conjures up an image of strength and power. 20. Aziel. This name has its roots in Hebrew and means âGod is my strengthâ. Itâs a rare boys' name, but a great choice if you want to name your baby something biblical but original. 21. Finlay. Finlay originates from Scotland, coming from the Gaelic for âfair-haired warrior or heroâ. This unique boysâ name could be a great way of honouring your Scots ancestry, but then again you donât have to be of Scottish descent (or even have a blond-haired child) to name your son Finlay if you like the sound of it. 22. Kenji. This Japanese name literally means âstrong and vigorousâ but also the âintelligent second sonâ. Itâs a powerful and unusual name for your little boy, especially if your family has Japanese roots. If youâre expecting a twin boy and girl, you might also enjoy these Japanese girl names. 23. Hernan. Hernan comes from the name Hernando, the mediaeval Spanish form of the more common Ferdinand, meaning âdaringâ and âbraveâ. Hernan is a unique, creative name that fits an adventurous baby boy who loves knights and castles, and perfect if you enjoy Spanish boy names! 24. Leonardo. Originating from Italy, Spain and Portugal, this name is a variant of Leonard, meaning âbrave lionâ. But the name could also suggest an affinity with science, art and culture thanks to historical namesakes such as the artist and scientist Leonardo da Vinci, or the 13th-century Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci. Of course, however, many famous people have had this name in the past, and your son will soon make it his own. 25. Marcellus. Meaning âyoung warriorâ in Latin, this strong, yet unusual boysâ name certainly makes a statement. 26. Max. This short form of Maximillian or Maxwell is also great as a standalone name. Coming from Latin, it simply means âgreatestâ. And what could be better than reminding your son, every time you call out his name, that you think heâs the greatest? 27. Maynard. This German name means âbraveâ, âhardyâ and âstrong. Itâs a great option for a unique name with a mighty meaning for your baby boy. 28. Storm. Evoking thundery skies, Storm is an original name for your little superhero. Itâs also popular as a girlâs name, so if youâre looking for a unisex or ungendered name this could be one for your shortlist.\n\nCool and Unique Baby Boy Names\n\nHave the feeling your little one will stand out from the crowd? We know he will with one of these cool and quirky baby boy names if you had something less traditional in mind: 29. Dario. Dario is the Italian form of the Greek-Persian name, Darius. In fact, it may be derived from the name of an ancient Persian king. The Latin variant Dario is an elegant name meaning âupholder of the goodâ. 30. Eliot. This English name for boys is a great choice if youâre looking for something a bit unique, and your son will certainly be in good company: The poet and playwright T.S. Eliot and the mob-busting American crimefighter Eliot Ness will be among your childâs namesakes if you pick this one. 31. Jaylen. Jaylen is a cool African-American unisex name thatâs been around since the 1990s. So, if youâre looking for something fresh, modern and interesting for your little boy â this might be it! 32. Lake. This unisex name is a gentle, nature-based option. Perhaps your baby will grow up to love the outdoors. 33. Micah. Shake things up with this unusual but catchy alternative to Michael, and your baby boyâs name will always make a statement.\n\n34. Orlando. For another distinctive name with cool, Latin appeal, try Orlando (the Italian form of Roland). William Shakespeare seemed to like this name too: The character Orlando in Shakespeareâs play âAs You Like Itâ is brave, chivalrous, modest, intelligent, strong and handsome.\n\n35. Seven. If youâre on your seventh child and youâre having trouble finding a name, then Seven could be a playful solution. Or maybe you want to break tradition and name your first child Seven. Seven is often thought to be a lucky number, so it could also be a fitting name for your little lucky charm. 36. Tremaine. This uncommon boysâ name started as a Cornish surname meaning âstone settlementâ. You might consider it if youâre looking for something out of the ordinary with timeless appeal, or perhaps as a nod to your familyâs Cornish roots. 37. Zarif. This Arabic name meaning âelegantâ, âwittyâ or âgracefulâ could be an inspired choice if youâd like to give your baby boy an unusual name with an eastern flavour.\n\nUnique Non-English Names for Boys\n\nThere is no need to restrict your hunt for the perfect name to the English language. Perhaps youâd like to reflect your family heritage or commemorate a place youâve lived or visited. Read our list of non-English boy names for some unique inspiration. 38. Alessandre. A variant of Alessandro, the Italian form of Alexander, Alessandre means âdefending menâ in Greek. 39. Amadeo. This is the Italian version of the Late Roman name Amadeus, meaning âlove of Godâ. Amadeus was also the middle name of famous Austrian composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. 40. Ambrose. From the Late Latin name Ambrosius, meaning âimmortalâ. Ambrose is a unique name for boys if youâre looking for a sophisticated touch. 41. Callum. Also spelt Calum, this name is a derivation of Columba, a Latin name that means âdoveâ. The most notable bearer was an Irish monk who brought Christianity to Scotland. What a peaceful and serene middle name for your baby boy. 42. Enzo. Popular in Europe, Enzo is the short form of names ending in enzo, such as Italian names like Lorenzo or Vicenzo. Itâs also the historic version of the name Heinz, derived from the German form of Henry (Heinrich), which means âhome rulerâ. 43. Kazimir. A form of Casimir, this unique boysâ name comes from Russian, Croatian and Slovene languages. It has two rather conflicting meanings, âto destroyâ or âworld, peaceâ. You could also shorten it to Kaz for a cute nickname or middle name. 44. Lazlo. The Anglicised version of the Hungarian name LÃ¡szlÃ³, the king of Hungary in the eleventh century. LÃ¡szlÃ³ is also the Hungarian version of the Slavic name Vladislav, meaning âruleâ and âgloryâ. 45. Lev. This name of Russian origin means âlionâ and was the real name of the author Leo Tolstoy, whose full name is Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy. Lev is also a Hebrew name meaning âheartâ and a short form of the Georgian name Levan, derived from the Greek word for âlionâ.\n\n46. Osvaldo. For another distinctively unique baby boysâ name with international appeal, try Osvaldo, the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese version of Oswald, which means âgodâ and âpowerâ or ârulerâ. 47. Xandros. This is a variant of Xandro, derived from the Portuguese name Alexandro, which comes from Alexander. Just like Alessandre, Xandros means âdefending menâ in Greek. 48. Yael. A boyâs name of Hebrew, Welsh and Old English origin, Yael means âmountain goatâ or âfertile moorâ. Making it a great unique choice for your little boy. 49. Zahir. This unique Arabic name means âhelperâ or âsupporterâ and can also be spelt Zaahir.\n\nNature-Inspired Unique Boy Names\n\nIf youâd like your little one to have a strong connection to nature, consider choosing one of these unique gems for your baby boyâs name: 50. Amo. Meaning âlittle eagleâ in French, this unique boysâ name can also be the short form of any name starting with Am, such as Ambrose, Amadeo, or Amaal. 51. Ashby. Similar to the popular name Ashely, Ashby means âash treeâ. The by suffix extends the meaning to âash tree farmâ, which is the same meaning as the name Ashton. 52. Atwood. Rather unsurprisingly, Atwood means âdweller at the woodâ. If you love nature, especially forests, this could be a sweet and uncommon boysâ name for your very own little woodsâ dweller! 53. Banks. Just like above, the meaning of Bank is also pretty easy to guess. It refers to someone who lived near the edge of a river or hillside. 54. Caleb. Related to the Hebrew word kevel, Caleb means âdogâ. However, some believe it may be a combination of the two words kal and lev, which mean âwholeâ and âheartâ.\n\n55. Elon. In Hebrew, Elon means âoak treeâ. Itâs also the name of one of the judges in the Old Testament. 56. Foster. Another unique boysâ name derived from a surname, Foster refers to âforesterâ or âwoodsmanâ. 57. Madden. From the Irish word maddah, Madden means âlittle dogâ. You may recognise it as the surname of popular fashion designer Steven Madden. 58. Odell. Those from the town of Odell in Bedfordshire bore this name. It comes from two words that mean âwood hillâ when put together â a unique and trendy sounding boysâ name for a little nature lover. 59. Rhodes. Derived from the Old English word rod, the name Rhodes means âcleared landâ. In Greek, it has the very sweet meaning of âwhere the roses growâ, making it a cute and unique name for your baby boy. 60. Zale. Most commonly used as a surname in Poland, Zale combines the words za and las, meaning âon the other side of the woodâ. 61. Zamir. Meaning Hebrew in âsongbirdâ, this makes a great choice if your lad has a strong set of lungs. It also means âgood voiceâ in the southern Balkans.\n\nRare and Unique Baby Boy Names With Meaning\n\nYour sonâs name will represent him for life, so choose one thatâs as special as he is.
