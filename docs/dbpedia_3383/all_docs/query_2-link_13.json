        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Before the start of the United States women’s soccer match with Canada on Thursday, the teams put aside their ferocious rivalry and acted like colleagues, all for the good of their sport.\n\nIn a show of solidarity in the pursuit of equal rights in soccer, the players gathered at midfield before their SheBelieves Cup match to form what looked like a giant heart. In one way or another, they all wore the color purple after coordinating the effort the previous day. The Canadians explained on their players’ union Twitter account that purple “has historically been associated with efforts to achieve gender equality.”\n\nWith the Canadian team’s equal-rights battle with its national federation intensifying over the past week — getting so heated that the players went on a brief strike — it made sense for the teams to come together to garner public support."
