        "text": "Long a vital, respected thespian of the classic and contemporary stage, this grand lady did not become a household name and sought-after film actress until age 56 when she turned in a glorious, Oscar-winning performance as Cher's sardonic mother in the romantic comedy Mondsüchtig (1987). Movie (and TV) fans then discovered what East coast theater-going audiences had uncovered decades before -- Olympia Dukakis was an acting treasure. Her adaptability to various ethnicities (Greek, Italian, Jewish, Eastern European, etc.), as well her chameleon-like versatility in everything from cutting edge comedy to stark tragedy, kept her in high demand for 30 years as one of Hollywood's topnotch character players.\n\nOlympia Dukakis was born on June 20, 1931, in Lowell, Massachusetts, the daughter of Greek immigrants, Alexandra (Christos), from the Peloponnese, and Constantine S. Dukakis, from Anatolia. She majored in physical therapy at Boston University, where she graduated with a BA. Olympia practiced as a physical therapist during the polio epidemic. She later returned to her alma mater and entered the graduate program in performing arts, earning a Master of Fine Arts degree.\n\nOlympia found early success by distinguishing herself first on stage performing in summer stock and with several repertory and Shakespearean companies throughout the county. She made her Broadway debut as an understudy in \"The Aspern Papers\" at age 30, followed by very short runs in the plays \"Abraham Cochrane\" (1964) and \"Who's Who in Hell\" (1974). In 1999, she premiered a one-woman play \"Rose,\" at the National Theatre in London and subsequently on Broadway in 2000. The play earned her an Outer Critics Circle Award and Drama Desk Award nomination and she continues to tour the country with it.\n\nOlympia was seen on the New York stage in the Roundabout Theatre's production of \"The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore\" (2011), in San Francisco in A.C.T.'s production of \"Vigil\" (2011) and as \"Prospera\" in \"The Tempest\" (2012) at Shakespeare & Co. She has performed in over 130 productions Off-Broadway and regionally at theaters including the Public Theatre, A.C.T., Shakespeare in the Park, Shakespeare & Co., and the Williamstown Summer Theatre Festival, where she also served as Associate Director. She was seen again at Shakespeare & Co. in the summer of 2013 as the title role in \"Mother Courage and Her Children.\"\n\nOlympia married Yugoslav-American actor Louis Zorich in 1962. The New York-based couple went on to co-found The Whole Theatre Company in Montclair, New Jersey, and ran the company for 19 years (1971-1990). As actress, director, producer and teacher, she still found the time to raise their three young children. She also became a master instructor at New York University for fourteen years. She scored theater triumphs in \"A Man's a Man,\" for which she won an Off-Broadway Obie Award in 1962; several productions of \"The Cherry Orchard\" and \"Mother Courage\"; \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\"; \"The Rose Tattoo\"; \"The Seagull\"; \"The Marriage of Bette and Boo\" (another Obie Award); and, more notably, her many performances as the title role in \"Hecuba.\" A good portion of her successes was launched within the walls of her own theater company, which encouraged the birth of new and untried plays.\n\nOlympia's prolific stage directing credits include many of the classics: \"Orpheus Descending,\" \"The House of Bernarda Alba,\" \"Uncle Vanya,\" and \"A Touch of the Poet,\" as well as the more contemporary (\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" and \"Kennedy's Children\"). She also adapted such plays as \"Mother Courage\" and \"The Trojan Women\" for the theater company. Over the duration of their marriage, she and her husband have experienced shared successes, appearing together in \"Long Day's Journey Into Night,\" \"Camino Real, \"The Three Sisters\" and \"The Seagull,\" among many others. Both are master interpreters of Chekhovian plays -- one of their more recent acting collaborations was in \"The Chekhov Cycle\" in 2003.\n\nMaking an inauspicious debut in a bit role as a mental patient in Lilith (1964), she tended to gravitate toward off-the-wall films with various offshoots of the ethnic mother. She played mom to such leads as Dustin Hoffman in John und Mary (1969), Joseph Bologna in the cult comedy Made for Each Other (1971) and Ray Sharkey in Idolmaker - Das schmutzige Geschäft des Showbusiness (1980). Interestingly, it was her scene-stealing work on Broadway in the comedy \"Social Security\" (1986) that caught director Norman Jewison's eye and earned her the Mondsüchtig (1987) movie role. The Academy Award win for Best Supporting Actress was the last of a stream of awards she earned for that part, including the Los Angeles Film Critics, Golden Globe and American Comedy awards.\n\nFrom then on, silver-haired Olympia was frequently first in line for a number of cream-of-the-crop matron roles: Magnolien aus Stahl - Die Stärke der Frauen (1989), Dad (1989), Kuck' mal wer da spricht! (1989), Die sieben besten Jahre (1993), Mr. Holland's Opus (1995) and Mörderisches Herz (1995).\n\nOn TV, she received high praise for her work especially for her sympathetic trans-gendered landlady Anna Madrigal in the acclaimed miniseries Armistead Maupin's Geschichten aus San Franzisko (1993) and its sequels Sweet Home San Francisco (1998) (Emmy Nominee) and Noch Mehr Stadtgeschichten (2001). She was additionally seen in episodes of Bored to Death (2009), and TV movies Die legendären blonden Bombshells (2000) (Judi Dench), Frank Sinatra - Der Weg an die Spitze (1992) (Golden Globe Nominee), and Johanna von Orleans (1999) (Emmy Nominee). This work is among more than 40 other series, mini-series and guest starring roles she accumulated over her long career. Several recurring TV roles also came her way with Center of the Universe (2004), Bored to Death (2009), Sex & Violence (2013), Forgive Me (2013), Switch (2018) and one last return to her popular Anna Madrigal role with the series sequel Stadtgeschichten (2019).\n\nThe septuagenarian hardly slowed down and continued strongly into the millennium with top supporting film credits including The Intended (2002), The Event (2003), the title role in the mystery Charlie's War (2003), The Thing About My Folks (2005), Jesus, Mary and Joey (2005), An ihrer Seite (2006), Day on Fire (2006), Im Land der Frauen (2007), The Last Keepers (2013), A Little Game (2014), 7 Chinese Brothers (2015), The Infiltrator (2016), Secret Links (2016) and Change in the Air (2018). The film Cloudburst (2011), in which she shared a co-lead with Brenda Fricker, became a critical and audience darling, winning a multitude of \"Best Film\" awards and several \"Best Actress\" honors (Seattle, San Diego) at various film festivals.\n\nAn ardent liberal and Democrat, she was the cousin of 1988 presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. Moreover, she was a strong advocate of women's rights and environmental causes. Olympia published her best-selling autobiography \"Ask Me Again Tomorrow: A Life in Progress\" in 2003, an introspective chronicle full of her trademark candor and wry humor. She was also a figure on the lecture circuit covering topics as widespread as life in the theater to feminism, Alzheimer's, diabetes, and osteoporosis.\n\nA hardcore New Yorker, she resided there following the death of her husband in 2018, and until her death in May 2021. She received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Greek America Foundation, the National Arts Club Medal of Honor, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nMena Alexandra Suvari was born in Newport, Rhode Island, the youngest of four children. She is the daughter of Ando Suvari, a psychiatrist, and the former Candice Chambers, a nurse. Mena's first name comes from her British aunt named after the \"House of Mena\" Hotel (at the base of the pyramids in Egypt); her last name is Estonian. Suvari grew up in an old stone mansion that she insists was haunted. The family later relocated to Charleston, South Carolina, where her brothers lined up to attend the Citadel (a military college). Mena, meanwhile, was entertaining dreams of becoming an archaeologist, astronaut, or doctor. Her interests took a turn for the... less cerebral, however, when a modeling agency stopped by her all-girls school to offer classes. At age 12, after receiving a few pointers on her runway strut, Suvari attended a modeling convention and was snapped up by the Manhattan-based Wilhelmina agency. She later moved to L.A. under their children's theatrical division WeeWillys, which began her acting career.\n\nSuvari started in on TV work almost immediately--commercials at first, followed by guest appearances on Das Leben und ich (1993), Emergency Room: Die Notaufnahme (1994), and Chicago Hope: Endstation Hoffnung (1994). Mena was a natural for movies: she is petite (5'4\"), has blue eyes, and her natural hair color is blonde. She launched her film career in 1997, picking up small roles in Gregg Araki's Nowhere - Eine Reise an den Abgrund der Seele (1997) and the Morgan Freeman-Ashley Judd thriller ...Denn zum küssen sind sie da (1997). She popped up again in the background of Hauptsache Beverly Hills (1998), then landed a slightly meatier role as the best friend of the telekinetic heroine in Carrie 2 - Die Rache (1999).\n\nSuvari's ticket to fame was the teen sex quest American Pie - Wie ein heißer apfelkuchen (1999), which cast her as a wholesome choir girl who falls for a jock (Chris Klein). A few months later, she turned even more heads as the vampish cheerleader who captures Kevin Spacey's unwholesome imagination in American Beauty (1999). The sultry-but-fragile character earned Suvari a British Academy Award nomination, as well as a flurry of job offers and gushing fansites. In the midst of the hubbub surrounding the film, she slipped off with her boyfriend, cinematographer Robert Brinkmann, to tie the knot in a secret ceremony. The media was quick to point out the pair's 18-year age difference, but Suvari shrugged it off (her own parents, who divorced in 2001 after 32 years of marriage, wed when her mother was 21 and her father 48).\n\nThe in-demand actress completed her patriotic hat trick by starring in Die amerikanische Jungfrau (1999) (originally titled \"Live Virgin\") as the daughter of a porn king. The title change wasn't enough of a boost to keep the mediocre movie afloat in theaters--after a brief New York run, it headed straight to video. Her next effort was another underperformer, but the aptly named Loser - auch verlierer haben glück (2000) (a collegiate love story that reunited her with American Pie's Jason Biggs) at least made it into suburban circulation--perhaps on the name recognition of its two young stars. Suvari kept her chin up, heading back to high school for the cheerleading/bank heist flick Sugar & Spice (2001) and joining the cast of the period film The Musketeer - Der junge D'Artagnan (2001).\n\nShe continued to showcase her range in ability by costarring with John Leguizamo in Jonas Åkerlund's cult classic Spun (2002) and then alongside Jennifer Aniston in Rob Reiner's Wo die Liebe hinfällt... (2005) and Keira Knightley in Tony Scott's Domino (2005). She also played opposite James Franco in Sonny (2002), the directorial debut of Nicolas Cage, and had a recurring role on HBO's Six Feet Under - Gestorben wird immer (2001).\n\nMena rounded out her creative pursuits by playing the iconic Black Dahlia in Ryan Murphy's anthology series American Horror Story (2011) and continued working in TV by following up with an arc in the hit series Chicago Fire (2012), as well as leading the Amazon pilot Hysteria (2014) and WeTv's miniseries South of Hell (2015). Mena then starred opposite Alicia Silverstone for TV Land's American Woman (2018).\n\nAmicably divorced from Brinkmann after five years, Mena had a brief second marriage to Simone Sestito, an Italian concert promoter who, she claims, drained her financially. Since 2018, she has been married to Canadian prop master Michael Hope. The couple had a son, Christopher Alexander Hope, in 2021. That same year, Mena published her first book, 'The Great Peace'. Mena's hobbies include: jewelry making, photography, mountain biking, and hiking. Her fans look forward to her new projects."
