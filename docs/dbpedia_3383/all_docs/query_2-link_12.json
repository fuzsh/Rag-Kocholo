Of the historic moment, they said, \"I feel proud seeing 'Quinn' up on the lineup and on my accreditation. I feel sad knowing there were Olympians before me unable to live their truth because of this world. I feel optimistic for change.

Quinn played for almost the entirety of the team's three matches, only being substituted in the closing minutes of their 4–0 loss to Australia in order to give newcomer Olivia Smith an appearance. Their performance was generally praised.[69][70]\n\nPersonal life\n\nIn 2020, Quinn came out as non-binary and transgender (using gender-neutral pronouns) and changed their name by adopting their prior surname as a mononym.[71] They were permitted to continue playing professional women's soccer on the basis of their sex assigned at birth, rather than gender identity.[72] They have expressed disappointment with media using their birth name when they came out, stating \"it's crucial to write about trans people using their name & pronouns.\"[73] In July 2021, Quinn became the first out non-binary transgender athlete to compete and become an Olympic Champion at an Olympic Games.[74][75]\n\nIn 2023, Quinn became the first openly transgender and non-binary footballer at the FIFA World Cup.[5]\n\nCareer statistics\n\nGoals scored in international matches[76] Goal Date Location Opponent Score Result Competition 1 16 February 2016 BBVA Compass Stadium Guatemala 5150.01005\n\n5–0\n\n10–0\n\nCONCACAF Women's Olympic Qualifier 2 5150.01005\n\n6–0\n\n3 5150.01005\n\n7–0\n\n4 8 October 2018 H-E-B Park, Edinburg Cuba\n\n5350.03005\n\n8–0\n\n5650.06005\n\n12–0\n\n2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship 5 14 October 2018 Toyota Stadium, Frisco Panama\n\n5350.03005\n\n5–0\n\n5650.06005\n\n7–0\n\n2018 CONCACAF Women's Championship Semi-final 5 5 December 2023 Christine Sinclair Place, Vancouver Australia\n\n5150.01005\n\n1–0\n\n5150.01005\n\n1–0\n\nInternational friendly\n\nHonours\n\nCanada\n\nSummer Olympics: 2021; bronze medal 2016[15]\n\nAlgarve Cup: 2016[11]\n\nFour Nations Tournament: 2015[11]\n\nSeattle Reign FC\n\nNWSL Shield: 2022[77]\n\nThe Women's Cup: 2022[78]\n\nIndividual\n\nCONCACAF Awards Best XI: 2018[15]\n\nAtlantic Coast Conference Midfielder of the Year: 2017[79]\n\nSee also\n\nTransgender people in sports\n\nList of Olympic medalists in football\n\nList of 2020 Summer Olympics medal winners\n\nList of Seattle Reign FC players\n\nList of Canadian sports personalities\n\nList of LGBT sportspeople\n\nList of LGBT Olympians\n\nList of NCAA Division I women's soccer First-Team All-America teams\n\nList of legally mononymous people\n\nList of people from Toronto\n\nReferences\n\nFurther reading\n\nActivist Athletes: When Sports and Politics Mix.
