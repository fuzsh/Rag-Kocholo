Courses in other departments may also count toward the major or minor in our program. For a full list of eligible courses, please see the Vanderbilt undergraduate catalog or YES (enrolled students only).\n\nFall 2024 Courses\n\nENGL 1100.01, 02, and 03: Composition: Individuals and Communities\n\nJordan Ivie\n\n1100.01: MWF 12:20 - 1:10 PM\n\n1100.02: MWF 1:25 - 2:15 PM\n\n1100.03: MWF 2:30 - 3:20 PM\n\nIn the 1982 sci-fi film Star Trek; the Wrath of Khan, Spock famously proclaims, “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.” In a divided America, it is more important than ever to genuinely consider this dynamic and explore the responsibilities of the individual to the larger community and the responsibilities of the community to the individuals that make it up. Where do individual rights end for the sake of the larger community? When does the community sacrifice in order to maintain the individual rights of its citizens? What happens when the individual comes into conflict with the community? This course explores these questions through a wide variety of genres, media, and time periods, with the ultimate goal of encouraging students to consider their own places within larger communities. Through a series of readings, essays, workshops, and other projects exploring this topic, students will also consider questions of structure, clarity, and credibility, ultimately producing a persuasive research paper on a topic of their choice. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.04: Composition: Rhetoric in Popular Culture\n\nStephanie Graves\n\nMW 1:25 - 2:15 PM\n\nThis course is designed to help you develop your skills in expository and persuasive writing within an academic context, as well as building your skills as a researcher within a scholarly setting—all through the lens of contemporary popular culture. Using popular texts—from film, television, and music to podcasts, Youtube, and more—we will explore how popular culture encodes and influences rhetorical discourse while developing and putting into practice the skillsets of researching and writing within the context of the academy. In this course, you will develop your own critical awareness of cultural contexts and learn strategies for engaging critically with popular texts, as well as understanding research and analysis as the means of participating in scholarly conversations. This course will increase your confidence as both a writer and scholar and equip you with the skills you need as you pursue your academic courses of study. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.05, 06, and 07: Composition: Archetypal Psychology: The Hero's Journey\n\nBrittany Ackerman\n\n1100.05: TR 8:00 - 9:15 AM\n\n1100.06: TR 9:30 - 10:45 AM\n\n1100.07: TR 11:00 - 12:15 PM\n\nThis course will explore Jungian archetypes and how they function in storytelling (literature, theater, film, etc.). Students will examine how the archetypes are used to illuminate personality and writing tropes through the ages. Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell’s theories are applied to mythology and modern narratives as well as Freudian concepts relating to the development of societies. Together, we will traverse The Hero's Journey by means of understanding the history and context of various myth and story cycles, as well as recognizing the influence of traditional and contemporary texts. Students will produce three sustained writing projects evolving from short critical responses. These papers will be based on personal experience and conducted outside research. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.08: Composition: Writing, Research, and Storytelling\n\nMark Wisniewski\n\n1100.11: TR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nHumans are unique in that we understand the world through stories. When we stop to think about it, almost everything we do is a form of storytelling. Advertisements tell us stories about how our lives would be better with different products and services. Novels, movies, television, and videogames entertain us, but also affect the way we view the world around us. What, then, about research? Is academic work another form of storytelling? This course will start from the assumption that it is. Over the course of the semester, we will engage in writing projects that explore how advertising, entertainment media, and research are all forms of storytelling, each of which raises ethical questions about how we define ourselves and others. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.09 and 1100.10: Composition: Rhetoric in/of Humanity\n\nStephanie Graves\n\n1100.09: MWF 9:05 - 9:55 AM\n\n1100.10: MWF 10:10 - 11:00 AM\n\nReserved for students co-enrolling in any sections of CORE 1010.\n\nWith all their contention and bombast, contemporary social and political discourse foregrounds the myriad of ways in which persuasion manifests. Long defined as the art and study of persuasion, rhetoric is a powerful lens through which we can better understand the mechanisms of influence—and through which we can then more effectively employ it in our own writing. Because rhetorical analysis is a tool that renders information and its context understandable, accessible, and meaningful, it acts as a key to unlocking how human form structures our world—and how our world then structures our humanity. Designed in tandem with CORE 1010: Being Human, this course focuses on analyzing, constructing, and defending rhetorical arguments within the academic writing context. In this course, you will develop your own critical awareness of cultural contexts and learn strategies for engaging critically with texts, as well as understanding research and analysis as the means of participating in scholarly conversation and discourse. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.11 and 1100.12: Composition: Narrative and the Human Experience\n\nMark Wisniewski\n\n1100.11: TR 11:00 - 12:15 PM\n\n1100.12: TR 1:15 - 2:30 PM\n\nThis section of ENGL 1100 is open only to first-year students who are simultaneously enrolled in a section of CORE: Being Human. Like any skill, academic writing is a craft in which all writers continually develop their knowledge and abilities. Our emphasis in ENGL 1100 will be to continue developing our technical writing skills and academic writing voices, while also deepening your engagement with the central ideas you will explore in your section of CORE: Being Human. We will do all of this by thinking about storytelling as a foundational aspect of the human experience. All written assignments in this section of ENGL 1100 are designed to encourage you to think more thoroughly about topics raised in your CORE: Being Human course, to look at these topics from a different perspective, or to prepare materials (such as an annotated bibliography) to facilitate your CORE: Being Human assignments. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1111.16: FYWS: Toni Morrison\n\nTeresa Goddu\n\nTR 1:15 - 2:30 PM\n\nThis course examines the works of Toni Morrison, beginning with The Bluest Eye and Song of Solomon and ending with her Nobel-prize winning work, Beloved. We will develop arguments about issues and problems that reoccur in her work: race, gender, class, and sexuality; geography and migration; history, trauma, and memory; kinship and community; nation and region; oppression and freedom; language and the artist’s role. Most importantly, we will locate Morrison’s works at the center of contemporary discussions about race and nation. [3; maximum of 6 credits total for all semesters of 1111] (P)\n\nENGL 1210W.01 and 1210W.02: Prose Fiction: Forms and Techniques: Monsters in Fiction\n\nJustin Quarry\n\n1210W.01: MWF 2:30 - 3:20 PM\n\n1210W.02: MWF 3:35 - 4:25 PM\n\nWhat, or who, is a monster? What makes such a being simultaneously horrifying and fascinating? What might monsters represent? In exploring these questions, we’ll analyze portrayals of so-called monsters in mostly contemporary novels, graphic novels, and short stories, and we’ll examine the elements of fiction used to illuminate these beings, and in turn the societal anxieties and desires among which they appear. More broadly, the aim of this course is to teach you to think critically about literature. Therefore, through three informal reading responses, three formal essays, in-class writing, and class discussions, you’ll hone close-reading skills as well as better develop analytic writing skills. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1210W.03: Prose Fiction: Forms and Techniques: McCarthy and Morrison Doing Violence\n\nNicholas Reich\n\nMWF 12:20 - 1:10 PM\n\nCormac McCarthy and Toni Morrison are two of the most acclaimed American novelists of the last century. And yet they’re rarely discussed together—perhaps in part because McCarthy was a White man, and Morrison a Black woman. Their work has more in common than just acclaim, though, including a deep and abiding fascination with violence. In this course, we will read a selection of their novels and shorter prose to help us think through some important questions about the nature of violence and its deployment in the American context, especially by way of gender and race. We will investigate whether writing stands a chance at diminishing the widespread violence that sustains social and environmental injustice, and how we can become better writers by practicing non-violent methods of active listening and revision.\n\nENGL 1220W.01: Drama: Forms and Techniques\n\nJudith Klass\n\nTR 4:15 - 5:30 PM\n\nThis course looks at plays from the Golden Age of ancient Athens to the present. We consider Aristotle’s ideas about how tragedy should lead to catharsis in the audience, and how a tragic hero should have a fatal flaw. We consider theatrical devices tied to moments in history, like a Greek chorus or an Elizabethan soliloquy. The course focuses on plays about families: volatile, funny, vindictive, forgiving, loving, hating – sometimes cruel in their actions and sometimes painfully honest in their words to each other. Theater can feel claustrophobic, with few sets: but this can fill family plays with energy, as people trapped at home together confront problems. We’ll explore how family plays have changed over time, and make connections between some very different works. Playwrights include Sophocles, Aristophanes, Shakespeare, Chekhov, O’Neill, Odets, Kaufman and Hart, Miller, Williams, Hansberry, Norman, Shepard, Vogel, Hwang, Auburn, Parks and Durang. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1230W.02: Literature and Analytical Thinking: Salvaging Literature\n\nJeong-Oh Kim\n\nMWF 1:25 - 2:15 PM\n\nThis course declares two purposes. Grammatically speaking, as an adjective, salvaging describes a kind of literature, one that saves what is lost, or fragile, or endangered. By studying the forms and techniques of such literature, we will explore the problems that literature has set in motion by its response to the world—to society, economy, gender, race, geography, culture, suffering, and human rights. At the same time, Salvaging Literature concerns how to save literature, how to salvage its various forms, through considering and writing about our connections to literature as citizens of the university and of wider communities. We will explore these two ways of articulating Salvaging Literature by considering texts such as Edgar Allan Poe, Selected Tales; Robert Louis Stevenson, The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; Richard Hughes’s High Wind in Jamaica; Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia; John Jay’s The Beggar’s Opera; George Lillo’s Fatal Curiosity; Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein; and Romantic poetry. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1230W.03: Literature and Analytical Thinking: Oceans and Literature\n\nJeong-Oh Kim\n\nMWF 12:20 - 1:10 PM\n\nThis course examines the cultural meaning of the sea in British literature and history, from early modern times to the present. Interdisciplinary in conception, it charts metaphorical and material links between the idea of the sea in the cultural imagination and its significance for the social and political history of Britain, offering a fresh analysis of the impact of the ocean on the formation of British cultural identities. Writers to be discussed include William Shakespeare, John Milton, Samuel Coleridge, Walter Scott, Robert Stevenson, Mark Twain, and Rachel Carson, among others. By combining the interests of three related but distinct areas of study—the analysis of sea fiction, critical maritime history, and cultural studies—to highlight the historical meaning of the sea in relation to its textual and cultural representation, my course will offer a new perspective on the nexus between the ocean and literature. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1230W.04: Literature and Analytical Thinking: The Art of Myth\n\nGrace LaFrentz\n\nMWF 10:10 - 11:00 AM\n\nWhat do statues that come to life, prosthetic wings fashioned together with wax, and music so powerful it can move stones have in common? These are all myths of artistic creation drawn from the Metamorphoses, a sweeping epic poem by the Roman author, Ovid. The Metamorphoses had a profound impact on Western culture, and countless authors have taken inspiration from Ovid’s complex and controversial myths, adapting these stories to speak to their own cultural moments and to raise pressing questions about issues as wide-ranging as gender, race, and the power of art. In this course, we will examine five Ovidian myths of artistic creation alongside their literary adaptations in a variety of genres from different historical periods, by authors from William Shakespeare to Toni Morrison. Through a series of academic and creative assignments, students will learn how to engage critically with primary sources, write persuasive arguments, and revise their writing based on feedback. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1250W.01: Introduction to Poetry\n\nJessie Hock\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nWhat is a poem? And how to read it? This class takes poetry lovers and novices alike through the joys and intricacies of reading, feeling, thinking, and every once in a while writing, poetry. Taking the Renaissance, the Romantic period, the mid-nineteenth century, and the twenty-first century as historical touchstones, we will focus on some of the most important poetic forms of the anglophone tradition: the sonnet, the ballad, the psalm, and free verse. In order to understand poetry from the inside out, we will write our own imitations of the poems we read for class. This writing practice complements the second goal of the class, which is to acquaint students with the skills necessary for writing academic papers. The contention of this class is that academic writing, as poetry, can be learned through imitation. Students will learn about poetic form and poetic history while practicing the art of literary close reading and developing critical writing skills. Requirements will include poetic imitations, response papers, short writing exercises, quizzes, homework assignments, essays (plus revisions), and active participation in class. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1250W.02 and 1250W.03: Introduction to Poetry\n\nLisa Dordal\n\n1250W.02: MWF 8:00 - 8:50 AM\n\n1250W.03: MWF 9:05 - 9:55 AM\n\nIn our increasingly fast-paced lives, reading poetry can be a great way to slow down and pay meaningful attention to the world around us and to our inner landscapes. Although the main objectives of this course are to help you become close readers of poetry and to help you develop your critical writing skills, the poems that we read might very well deepen your understanding of your own life and who you understand yourself to be. The first part of this course will be organized around formal considerations (diction, tone, imagery, figures of speech, sound, etc.). In the second half of the course, we will read the poetry of Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, Langston Hughes, Marie Howe, Mark Doty, Natasha Trethewey, and Li-Young Lee. Requirements include two papers (plus revisions), short response papers and homework assignments, participation in class discussions, and a written response to a poetry reading. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1250W.04: Introduction to Poetry: Poetics of Memory\n\nPaige Oliver\n\nMW 2:30 - 3:45 PM\n\nHow does language shape our memories? How do memories, in turn, give meaning to our lives? Does the act of remembering have to mean looking backward, or can articulating memories in language be oriented toward the future? And how can poetry help us answer these questions? In this course, we will survey a wide range of poets and poetic traditions, ranging from the Romantic poet William Wordsworth to the first National Youth Poet Laurette, Amanda Gorman. We will also tackle the poetics of memory from a variety of angles, including personal memory, national memory, geologic memory, monuments, and even forgetting. This is a writing intensive course, so throughout the semester, you will learn to implement a variety of writing styles: close reading, personal narrative, argumentative writing, and even poetry itself. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1250W.05: Introduction to Poetry\n\nAnthony Reed\n\nTR 9:30 - 10:45 AM\n\nThe question of what makes a good poem and good poetry has haunted readers at least since it became possible to be a professional poet. Answers inevitably reflect not just critics’ opinions of poetry but a host of related concerns regarding reading, culture, and society. In this course, as we explore poems that sought to influence the values and even behaviors of their readers, we will engage some key debates and pronouncements on what (good) poetry is from the 18th century to the present. Looking carefully at what writers at different moments have wanted poetry to be will guide us as we develop our own sense of what poetry is and does and may do for the future. Poets and critics will include Alexander Pope, Matthew Arnold, Langston Hughes, Gwendolyn Brooks, and Rita Dove. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1260W.01: Introduction to Literary and Cultural Analysis: Prison Writing\n\nAjay Batra\n\nTR 8:00 - 9:15 AM\n\nNearly two million people currently reside in prisons, jails, and immigrant detention centers across the United States. In this course, we will examine the different forms and genres of writing created in these spaces of confinement, both in our present and across American literary history. Reading essays, letters, poems, memoirs, manifestos, and more, we will discuss how incarcerated people have turned to the written word in order to meditate on their experiences of captivity, remain close to loved ones on the outside, build community with fellow detainees, and articulate strong, incisive critiques of systemic injustice. Additionally, we will consider how the highly restrictive, oppressive conditions of prisons and other carceral institutions have tended to shape the practices of literary expression developed by imprisoned writers across time and space. Throughout the term, students in this course will complete critical, creative, and collaborative assignments designed to improve their skills in writing, research, and literary analysis, as well as their fluency in discussing issues of race, class, gender, and inequality. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1260W.02, 1260W.03, and 1260W.04: Introduction to Literary and Cultural Analysis\n\nGabriel Briggs\n\n1260W.02: MWF 1:25 - 2:15 PM\n\n1260W.03: MWF 10:10 - 11:00 AM\n\n1260W.04: MWF 9:05 - 9:55 AM\n\nThis course examines the depth and breadth of the cultural phenomenon known as the Harlem Renaissance. However, rather than view this episode as an isolated period of African-American expression, we will see how Renaissance era artistry extended an earlier “New Negro” tradition, and how it encapsulated African-American cultural responses to early twentieth-century social, political, and economic stimuli. As such, students will work toward developing strategies for positioning authors and texts within specific cultural, historical, and theoretical contexts. Within this diverse landscape we will investigate artists, essayists, poets, musicians, and novelists that include: W. E. B Du Bois, Langston Hughes, Alain Locke, Countee Cullen, Louis Armstrong, Claude McKay, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman and George Schuyler. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1260W.05: Introduction to Literary and Cultural Analysis: The Environmental Humanities\n\nSavannah DiGregorio\n\nTR 4:15 - 5:30 PM\n\nMany scholars agree that we are now living in a new geological epoch —the Anthropocene—a name chosen to encapsulate an irreversibly transformed planet due to the expansion of human populations, exploitation of animals and natural resources, and pervasive pollution. The effects of the Anthropocene have been caused by only 25% of the world’s population, yet those in the US South, Caribbean, and African continent disproportionally suffer the consequences. The Anthropocene, then, is as much a social problem as it is an ecological issue.\n\nOur class will think about environmental problems, including climate, through a variety of lenses—the environmental sciences, philosophy, literary studies, law, history, multispecies ethnography, and Indigenous ways of knowing.\n\nOur discussions will be guided by books, articles, films, art, and games. Assignments include essays, fieldwork conducted in our community, and a final project demonstrating your skills in writing, cultural and ethical inquiry, and creativity. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1260W.06: Introduction to Literary and Cultural Analysis: Revival: Making and Unmaking the American Renaissance\n\nDavid Brandt\n\nMWF 11:15 - 12:05 PM\n\nWhat makes an old book come alive? In the case of a handful of books from the 1850s, we have an unusually convincing answer. In 1941, a young Harvard professor named F.O. Matthiessen published a doorstopper of a book of literary criticism. Measuring some 650 pages, American Renaissance examines nineteenth-century American literature exclusively through the works of five authors: Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, Melville, Whitman. The result? A new canon of American literature that has enthralled and provoked generations of subsequent readers. In this class, we will use the so-called “American Renaissance” as a jumping-off point for the critical analysis of cultural revival and canon formation—reading the famous books, investigating contexts around revival, and taking up other works that were later, or never, canonized. A final project will require you to select a work of literature and, using your own cultural and historical contexts, make a case for its revival. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1260W.07: Introduction to Literary and Cultural Analysis: Women Writers and the Global Nineteenth Century\n\nKelsey Rall\n\nMWF 12:20 - 1:10 PM\n\nWhen we think of nineteenth-century women’s literature, we might imagine the quaint English neighborhoods of Jane Austen’s novels or the domestic lives of Louisa May Alcott’s “little women.” Alternatively, we may think of Harriet Jacobs’ or Mary Prince’s harrowing escapes from slavery in the Southern US and Caribbean. But what we do not always consider is that these texts are speaking with, against, and to each other from across genres, national borders, and decades. In this course, we will analyze how the same systems of slavery, colonialism, and gender ideology undergird geographically distant texts. And, crucially, we will discuss how women have always been central to the conception of an expansive global community, despite the assumption that proper nineteenth-century women were not meant to stray beyond the domestic sphere. Students will learn how to engage critically with primary sources, write persuasive arguments, and structure feedback into revisions of their written work. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1260W.08: Introduction to Literary and Cultural Analysis: Gender and Feminism in African Literature\n\nJustine Waluvengo\n\nMWF 11:15 - 12:05 PM\n\nThis course invites students to explore the diverse social and cultural realities that shape the identity of the African woman. Inspired by Chimamanda Adichie’s TED talk, “The Danger of a Single Story,” it challenges single-dimensional cultural narratives, especially about African womanhood. Through various narratives written by African women, we will examine African perspectives on feminist discourse, foregrounding the lived experiences of women of African descent. From Mariama Ba’s 1970s classic So Long a Letter to Yaa Gyasi’s contemporary Homegoing, the texts under consideration intervene in the evolving social understandings of Black identity, feminism, gender, and sexuality in Africa and the African diaspora. Students will critically explore themes of representation, Afro-feminism, postcolonial identity, Otherness, and intersectionality. A variety of assignments, including mapping family lineages, local color presentations, ABC close reading, and creative exercises, are included to help students develop critical and persuasive writing skills. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1260W.09: Introduction to Literary and Cultural Analysis: The Politics of Self-Care\n\nJennifer Gutman\n\nMWF 1:25 - 2:15 PM\n\nBed-rotting. Quiet-quitting. The Everything Shower. Self-care trends are sweeping our news feeds. But can the discourse of self-care be misleading? This class explores a genealogy for the rise in public discourse around self-care amid unprecedented national stress levels and planetary crisis. Over the course of the semester, we will situate contemporary mobilizations of self-care within longer traditions of self-reliance and cultivation in American society. Through examining literature and media by Black feminist thinkers, we will also consider how self-care has been re-claimed as a mode of resistance to structural racism and institutional violence. This course will end with an examination of the more recent phenomenon of eco-grief, which refers to the mental health effects of accelerated planetary crisis. Students will develop a final project that re-imagines the work of self-care as a practice of noticing and caring for the world around us. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1270W.01: Introduction to Literary Criticism: Mapping Literary Criticism\n\nJeong-oh Kim\n\nMWF 2:30 - 3:20 PM\n\nThis course is designed to help students develop their analytical skills while exploring and examining relations between literary criticism/ theory and literature. By developing a critical framework, a theoretical optics, a new perspective for the reading of literature, we will examine the ways in which major strands of literary criticism—deconstruction, psychoanalysis, postmodernism, feminism, and cognitive studies—draw upon literature. When we map the geographies of literary criticism, I aim to help students grasp those problems that literary criticism has set in motion by its response to the world: social justice, peace, human dignity, and the ethics of theory, to name just a few. We will approach literary criticism as an inquiry and as a practice. What can we do and what shall we do with literary criticism? [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 2311.01: Representative British Writers\n\nElizabeth Covington\n\nMWF 10:10 - 11:00 AM\n\nWant to take a rollicking ride through more than three hundred years of British literature? This course is a survey of British Literature from 1660 to the present. We will read works from many of the influential and significant writers from five literary periods: Restoration/18th Century, the Romantics, the Victorians, the Modernists, and the 20th Century and Beyond. In addition to a sweeping view of British literature, this course will challenge the traditional canon of British culture. We will explore texts by authors who were disregarded because of their gender, race, class, sexuality, and other factors. Ultimately, we will develop broad but robust vision of the development of British literature since 1660. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 2318.01: World Literature, Classical\n\nJessie Hock\n\nTR 1:15 - 2:30 PM\n\nGods, monsters, enchanters, sorceresses, cross-dressers, knights errant, a hippogryph, discontented wives, tricksters, outcasts and the devil: such is the cast of fictional characters we meet in this course, which surveys some of the most influential texts from the Greco-Roman, Italian, and English speaking worlds. The course will familiarize students with a variety of ancient genres—tragedy, epic, romance, and lyric—that continue to influence literary invention. And we will inquire into the shifting definitions of heroism, the family, religious belief, taboo, race, gender, love and identity—all of which vary widely across time and culture—as we analyze stories that still resonate today. [3] (Pre-1800, HCA)\n\nENGL 2319.01: World Literature, Modern: Magical Realism\n\nVera Kutzinski\n\nTR 1:15 - 2:30 PM\n\nMagical realism is a type of Speculative Fiction that has enjoyed remarkable popularity since the mid-20th century. Before taking hold as a global phenomenon, magical realism was associated primarily with Latin America and the Caribbean Rim. This seminar explores how novels and short stories in this category from various parts of the Global South play at and with the limits of reason and rationality, suggesting different ways of understanding and ordering our worlds. Our discussions will focus on the following questions, among others: What precisely are the differences between realism and magical realism? Is magical realism a discourse of escape and of consolation, or of revolutionary change? What are the politics of magic realism when it comes to gender, sexuality, and race? Readings include fiction by Erna Brodber, Alejo Carpentier, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel García Márquez, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Vandana Singh. [3] (Diverse Perspective, HCA)\n\nENGL 2740W.01: Topics in Literature and Philosophy: Genres of Insurrection\n\nAleksey Dubilet\n\nMW 2:30 - 3:45 PM\n\nWhat are insurrections? What is their significance, their temporality, and their desire? Are they merely political or do they generate disorder on social, historical, and even ontological levels? What modes of conceptualization, narration, and representation can be faithful to the insurgent force constitutive of insurrections? This course will pursue these questions by investigating key theoretical frameworks for the study of insurrection, uprising, and revolt. Studying a variety of textual genres (e.g., critical theory, philosophy, manifesto, novel, history, and film), this course will introduce students to insurrectionary moments spanning from the 16th-century Peasants’ War and 18th-century slave revolts to the 19th-century Paris Commune and contemporary forms of rebellion. Readings may include Benjamin, Blanqui, Fanon, Federici, Foucault, Hartman, Marx, Moten, Ross, Tomba, and Trouillot. Students will learn advanced critical writing in the humanities. First day attendance is imperative. [3] (Diverse Perspective, HCA)\n\nENGL 3312W.01: The Medieval World\n\nShoshana Adler\n\nTR 9:30 - 10:45 AM\n\nChauvinistic heroes and cannibal monsters; the sexual politics of courtly love; the fire and blood of medieval Christian mythology; lepers, nuns, knights, heretics, and demons: this course is an introduction to the motley array populating medieval literature. We will survey some of the most persistent themes of the period, including the romance of travel, the art of death and dying, the horror of the divine, and the crusades and the writing of history. We will learn to read texts in the original Middle English. No prior knowledge required. [3] (Pre-1800, HCA)\n\nENGL 3336.01: Shakespeare: \"Problematic\" Shakespeare\n\nPavneet Aulakh\n\nTR 4:15 - 5:30 PM\n\nThis course focuses on the first half of Shakespeare’s career, typically defined by his comedies and histories. If we associate tragedy, romance, and the taxonomic challenges posed by his “problem” plays with the more mature craft of his later works, “Problematic Shakespeare” explores the generic experimentation/messiness exemplified by his earlier stage productions. Thinking through the ways his early works are also “problematic”—in terms of their alteration from comic to tragic effect on audiences across history (as in The Merchant of Venice), the doubts they cast on his literary “genius” (Titus Andronicus being a really bad play for some equally canonized critics), or the problems posed by their characters (the potential attraction of either the affable but duplicitous “Hall” or his morally bankrupt but transparent compatriot, Falstaff)—we will approach early Shakespeare from multiple angles and interpretive modes to challenge our preconceptions as well as our understanding of this author. [3] (Pre-1800, HCA)\n\nENGL 3360.01: Restoration and the 18th Century\n\nBridget Orr\n\nTR 11:00 - 12:15 PM\n\n[3] (Pre-1800, HCA)\n\nENGL 3370.01: The Bible in Literature\n\nRoger Moore\n\nTR 9:30 - 10:45 AM\n\nKnowledge of the Bible is indispensable for understanding English and American literature. This course examines the ways that writers from the medieval period to the present engage Biblical stories, images, and characters. How does Chaucer retell the story of Noah and the Flood? How do the Beatitudes help Margaret Atwood critique fanatical religion in The Handmaid’s Tale? How does the conversion of the Apostle Paul inform Flannery O’Connor’s “Parker’s Back”? This course is valuable for English majors seeking a better understanding of the sources and backgrounds of English and American literature, as well as the general student who wishes to learn about the role of Christian themes in shaping canonical works of the English tradition. Students will take an in-class midterm essay exam and complete a final research paper, among other short assignments. While deep knowledge of the Bible is not required, some familiarity with basic Biblical themes and narratives would be helpful. [3] (Pre-1800, HCA)\n\nENGL 3645.01: The American Novel Since 1945\n\nAnna Hill\n\nMWF 12:20 - 1:20 PM\n\nThis course explores formal and thematic developments in the American novel from 1945 to the present. Reading a wide range of works, we will consider: What is the relationship between literature and culture in the postwar United States? How is the novel constructed and reimagined during this period in relation to decolonization, the Cold War, feminist movements, racial justice movements, the rise of neoliberalism, globalization, and the acceleration of climate crisis? Why is there such an obsession with “the great American novel”? How is the novel transformed by the rise of new technologies and new media cultures? Ultimately, we will approach novels as aesthetic objects while also situating them within their social, political, environmental, and historical contexts. Readings for this course may include novels by Toni Morrison, Helena María Viramontes, Don DeLillo, Linda Hogan, Chris Ware, Jack Kerouac, Marilynne Robinson, and Maxine Hong Kingston. [3] (Diverse Perspective, HCA)\n\nENGL 3654W.01: African American Literature: Literatures of Slavery and Emancipation\n\nAjay Batra\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nAfrican American literature first emerged against a backdrop of captivity, forced migration, and enslavement. Across the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Black writers transcended strict prohibitions against reading and writing to craft complex literary works that reflected powerfully on their diverse experiences of displacement, oppression, and spiritual awakening, as well as their practices of survival and their collective pursuit of liberation. In this course, we will attend closely to both major and minor works from this foundational period in African American literary history. Reading a combination of poems, essays, autobiographies, sermons, plays, and prose fiction, we will examine how Black writers creatively repurposed conventional forms and genres in order to tell their stories, construct their identities, create beauty, and speak truth to power. In addition, we will read a small selection of historical documents that chronicle the efforts of Black communities to resist conditions of bondage and to define freedom on their own terms. Major authors discussed in this course may include Phillis Wheatley (Peters), David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Harriet E. Wilson, Harriet Jacobs, and W. E. B. Du Bois. [3] (Diverse Perspectives, US)\n\nENGL 3720.01: Literature, Science and Technology: Science, Race, and Early Modernity\n\nPavneet Aulakh\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nExamining the relationship between science, the establishment and expansion of European empires in the “new world,” and race-making during the early stages of the scientific revolution, the three areas of focus organizing this course are rooted in the period’s consistent framing of the project for scientific advancement as a mastering of Nature aimed at “enlarging the bounds of Human Empire.” Motivated by the celebratory declarations of early scientists that the “newfound world” discovered by a microscope “must be conquered,” like Mexico, “by a Cortesian army” and that “There is an America of secrets, and unknown Peru of Nature” awaiting domination, we will explore how the cataloguing, collecting, and representation of the peoples, flora, and fauna of the new world in both contemporary ethnographies and literary works evidence not only a taxonomizing impulse, but also a formative moment in the history of science’s application to the fictional construction of racial difference. [3] (Pre-1800, HCA)\n\nENGL 3726.01: New Media: Race and Digital Culture\n\nHuan He\n\nTR 1:15 - 2:30 PM\n\nCan virtual reality automate empathy with others? How do video games make race and racism playable? Who labors to make our digital worlds possible? How does AI reproduce an imaginary of the human that reinforces whiteness? This course examines the dreams and nightmares that make up our collectively experienced “digital age,” which has a long history before the Internet and social media. We will think with theory, literature, art, and media to understand the embodied stakes of digitality and address questions of race and identity in online and virtual spaces. We will study how technologies perpetuate new and old forms of domination, and we will learn from writers and artists who imagine alternative digital futures. Certain days will be dedicated to hands-on activities with new media technologies such as VR and ChatGPT. No technical knowledge is required. In addition to written assignments, students will propose a final research or multimedia project based on individual interest. (DP) [3] (Diverse Perspective, HCA)\n\nENGL 3730.01: Literature and the Envioronment: What is Nature?\n\nRachel Teukolsky\n\nMW 4:40 - 5:55 PM\n\nWhat is nature? Is it found in a park, where you wander among trees and cute forest animals? Is it an untouched, pristine wilderness? Are some of us closer to nature than others? This course examines the ways that artists and writers have constructed “nature” as an idealized place or set of qualities, partly imaginary, partly concrete. We will consider a broad range of literature, art, philosophy, and film, including Steven Spielberg’s shark-shocker, Jaws; science fiction/eco-fiction by Octavia Butler (Dawn) and Margaret Atwood (Oryx and Crake); Mary Shelley, Frankenstein; romantic nature poetry by William Wordsworth; Henry David Thoreau, Walden (“Why I Went into the Woods”); Charles Darwin, Origin of Species; H. G. Wells, The Island of Doctor Moreau; Tommy Pico’s subversive Native-American, queer perspective in Nature Poem; and James Cameron’s film Avatar. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3740.01: Critical Theory: Introduction to Queer and Trans Theory\n\nShoshana Adler\n\nTR 8:00 - 9:15 AM\n\nWhat is the relationship between deviance and political radicalism? Is there a proper way to do the history of homosexuality? What methods do social, sexual, and gender deviants use to imagine and practice alternate forms of community? What is the relation between queer and trans studies, and between trans studies and feminism? This course is an introduction to the intellectual tradition of queer and trans theory, and to some of the historical forces that led to the emergence of queer theory as a distinct field of inquiry. We will study identity politics, sexual analytics, queer historiography, and LGBTQ organizing, exploring both foundational and contemporary debates in the field over gender, sexuality, race, activism, social norms, and historiography. The class is primarily focused on theory, but our readings will be punctuated with queer films. [3] (Diverse Perspective, HCA)\n\nENGL 3740W.01: Critical Theory: Revolutions, Abolition, Modernity\n\nAleksey Dubilet\n\nMW 4:40 - 5:55 PM\n\nWhat is a revolution? How does it define modernity and its political horizon? What visions of freedom, equality, and justice motivate revolutionary action? What senses of time, future, and possibility emerge out of revolutionary experience? This course will pursue these questions by studying the most radical modern political sequence: the mass self-emancipation of the enslaved that occurred in the Haitian Revolution (1791-1804), an event seen as the only successful slave revolt in history and the founding moment of postcolonialism. Using the Haitian Revolution as prism, this course will cover key concepts and theoretical frameworks, including: the human and its others; universal history and revolutionary untimeliness; law, possession, and the state; the entwinement of capitalism and colonialism; and plantation slavery and its afterlives. Reading may include Buck-Morss, Fischer, James, Koselleck, Nesbitt, Trouillot, Scott, and Wynter. Students will learn advanced critical writing in the humanities. First day attendance is imperative. [3] (Diverse Perspective, HCA)\n\nENGL 3890.01: Movements in Literature: Contemporary Native American Literature\n\nHelen Makhdoumian\n\nMWF 1:25 - 2:15 PM\n\nGoogle search “Native American literature” and you likely won’t get a definition emphasizing what the title of a recent anthology does: “Living Nations, Living Words.” This course explores what those two phrases mean for the canon by focusing on the multi-narrative novel, a form often associated with Louise Erdrich. She’s not alone, though. We’ll look at how this genre and structure has been taken up by Indigenous authors in the US and Canada, especially in the last five years. We’ll read Brandon Hobson’s The Removed, Michelle Good’s Five Little Indians, and Mona Simpson Power’s A Council of Dolls, among others. You’ll come away knowing not only literary history but also having developed critical language to discuss how Native authors revisit social and political history through literary production. We will attend to canon construction, authorial craft, and contextual topics: indigeneity, sovereignty, federal Indian policy, settler colonialism, and Indigenous transnationalism, to name a few. [3] (Diverse Perspective, HCA)\n\nENGL 3890.02: Movements in Literature: Global Modernism (Honors Seminar)\n\nRachel Teukolsky\n\nMW 2:30 - 3:45 PM\n\nThe modernist movement aimed to “make it new” by rejecting traditional art styles in favor of bold art experiments. Artists and writers were responding to earth-shaking historical transformations in the early twentieth century, including devastating world war, imperial unrest, the rise of new technologies, and confounding scientific discoveries. This course will study modernist innovations in novels, short stories, and poetry, as well as in film, visual art, and philosophy. Our globe-spanning author list will likely include Chinua Achebe, Jorge Luis Borges, Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, Zora Neale Hurston, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean Rhys, and Virginia Woolf, among others. (HCA, cumulative 3.4 G.P.A. is required)\n\nENGL 3894W.01: Major Figures in Literature: William Faulkner\n\nVera Kutzinski\n\nTR 11:00 - 12:15 PM\n\nHow have different audiences read and re-read Faulkner, by turns celebrating and detesting his work? We begin by looking at the 1949 Nobel laureate as one of the centerpieces of the post-WWII American literary canon and ask, for instance, which of his novels the New Critics, who dominated that US academy at the time, privileged and why. What aesthetic, cultural, and political values did the canonical Faulkner represent to them? Which specific aspects of Faulkner’s writing did they emphasize, which did they prefer to ignore? From a sampling of mid-century commentaries on Faulkner, we will proceed to examine how African American writers such as Toni Morrison and Edouard Glissant have revised Faulkner’s fictions. Texts include The Sound and The Fury, Absalom, Absalom!, Intruder in the Dust, and films based on his novels. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3898.01: Special Topics in English and American Literature: Pop Music and its Meanings\n\nEmily Lordi\n\nTR 11:00 - 12:15 PM\n\nIn this class, we’ll treat pop songs not as mere entertainment but as texts we can decode to better understand our world. We’ll hone this way of listening in part by reading the work of America’s finest, most influential music historians and critics. These writers will teach us to read song lyrics as poetry, and to assess how other aspects of music contribute to—and complicate—a song’s overall meaning. We’ll also explore what makes certain artists such celebrated, insightful and controversial interpreters of contemporary life. How do they capture fleeting feelings, nuanced identities, and new realties? Assignments will include several short essays, longer papers, a presentation, and lots of close listening. No prior musical expertise is necessary, although a love of music will enhance students’ experience of this course.

When bodies in the street become aestheticized or poems become acts of political protest? In this course we will study the relationship between poetics, politics, and performance across the 20/21 century Americas. We’ll begin with a survey of foundational debates in Marxist criticism in literature and art, which later theoretical readings will build upon. Aesthetic-political touchstones will include Black Surrealism, Conceptualism in Latin American Art, Brechtian theater, postcolonial poetics, and the performance of witness. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3899.01: Special Topics in Film: Art in the Age of Malaise: Film and Literature in the 1970s\n\nScott Juengel\n\nMW 2:30 - 3:45 PM\n\nWhat might the America of the 1970s teach us about our contemporary condition? What are the keys to overcoming wide-spread cultural unease? Despite the profound sense of social fragmentation, paranoia, and cratered idealism, the 70s produced a renaissance in American cinema with the ‘New Hollywood’ (e.g. The Godfather, Dog Day Afternoon, Saturday Night Fever, Dawn of the Dead), the birth of the summer blockbuster (Jaws, Star Wars), and transcendent new literary and political voices like Toni Morrison, Don DeLillo, Angela Davis, E.L. Doctorow, Hunter S. Thompson, and Adrienne Rich. This course explores the possibility of making art and entertainment out of cultural malaise by revisiting the decade that gave us disco and punk rock, reality tv, video games, Roots, earth art and modern environmentalism, personal computers, gonzo journalism, and more. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 4998.01: Honors Colloquium\n\nTeresa Goddu\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nThe Honors Colloquium prepares students to write their Honors Thesis in the spring (Engl. 4999). Through shared readings, students explore critical, theoretical, and creative approaches to literary texts and methodologies. Students learn research methods, effective modes of argumentation, and creative techniques. Over the course of the semester, students develop their thesis topics, both critical and creative, as they work collaboratively together in writing groups. The colloquium is reserved for students who have applied and been admitted to the English Honors Program; for more information on the honors program, please contact your advisor or Mark Schoenfield, the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

This is the class for you! The instructor will help students read, write, and think about fiction in critical ways that will hopefully inspire each student to experience moments of artistic intrigue and self-discovery.\n\nThis fiction tutorial is designed to help students develop independent creative writing projects. To foster a dynamic space for each student’s artistry to flourish, the instructor will meet with students every week to encourage and assist their self-directed creative pursuits. Weekly meetings are opportunities for the instructor to enthusiastically review new student material and offer guidance while also facilitating conversation and student feedback to ensure the student’s goals and expectations for their work are being met. The instructor will continually offer reading material and writing suggestions catered to each student’s creative desires. Students of any skill level or discipline are encouraged to apply.

You probably have an idea of what you want your work to sound like, in that you have all read fiction you find “good” or resonant, pieces you aspire to emulate. Many of you even have precious story ideas stored away in our brains for a rainy day. Well, look up—it’s drizzling!! In this class you will work to unlock your voice and platform your instincts in the service of telling your stories. Along the way, you will familiarize yourselves with the craft elements of storytelling and explore the works of a diverse range of writers. Throughout the semester, you will write two short stories to be workshopped in-class, along with shorter generative exercises. You will have the option of writing a third short story or revising a previously written story for your final. Be prepared to speak often and share work aloud. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1280.02: Beginning Fiction Workshop\n\nKumari Devarajan\n\nMWF 10:10 - 11:00 AM\n\nWriting fiction is an act of deep discovery. You don’t know what you’re going to find until you begin. The goal of this course is to create a safe environment where beginning writers feel comfortable taking risks. A range of in-class exercises will spark creativity and allow you to dive into your inner world. You will study short stories by a diverse set of writers and break them apart into their building blocks to discover where stories get their heart and pulse. During the semester, you will unearth your inherent strengths, develop your unique voice, and attempt to convey the strange, difficult truths that govern our lives. A big part of a healthy workshop is learning to give and receive feedback with goodwill and grace. By the end of the semester, you will have written and revised two short stories. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1280.03: Beginning Fiction Workshop\n\nNathan Blum\n\nMWF 1:25 - 2:15 PM\n\n“Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.” —E.L. Doctorow\n\nIn this course, we will seek to answer an unanswerable question: What makes a good story? First, by closely examining a range of published short fiction, we will break down stories into accessible parts: voice, perspective, point of view, character, plot, scene, and structure. As we develop our own definitions of these craft elements, we will experiment with writing exercises—literary weight-lifting—to build writerly strength, form positive artistic habits, and unearth our unique subject interests. Throughout our early discussions, we will model the collaborative, thoughtful methods of the effective workshop, knowing that, before the end of the course, each student will write and offer up two full-length stories to our class community for a workshop of their own. Finally, using the thoughtful, detailed feedback from our workshops, students will revise and reincarnate a first draft into a fully-formed, fire-breathing work of fiction. No prior experience is necessary. This course prepares students for intermediate-level fiction workshops. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1280.04: Beginning Fiction Workshop\n\nTony Earley\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nWriting fiction—making up characters who seem real, living in worlds a reader can see—is a kind of magic. Not magic as in the supernatural or uncanny, but magic like that practiced by onstage a good magician, tricks so precisely performed they don’t seem like tricks. In this class, we’re going to violate the first rule of magic and talk about how the tricks are done, how to take the basic mechanical devices of fiction—plot, characterization, point-of-view, etc.—and conjure up stories seemingly out of the air. We’ll learn how to both put the rabbit into the hat and pull it out. The class will be taught in a workshop format. Students will produce most of the text (three to four stories of five to eight pages) discussed by the class.

Workshop members will dissect the works of contemporary and past poetic voices, study craft elements, and become active members of the literary community by attending readings. This course uses discussion-based workshops and generative writing assignments to introduce students to poem-making, from research to creative output to feedback and finally to the editing process. By the end of this course, students will have a radically revised portfolio of poems and experience with the practice of poetry. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1290.02 Beginning Poetry Workshop\n\nAjla Dizdarevic\n\nMWF 11:15 - 12:05 PM\n\nIn this class, you'll become acquainted with a vast array of poets from across the world and across time. Our reading list will include Russian poets like Marina Tsvetaeva, contemporary American writers like Patricia Smith, Balkan poets like Miljenko Jergović, Victorian-era writers like Thomas Hardy, and more. You will develop the vocabulary needed to analyze and discuss poetry. Additionally, you'll be writing your own poems, which will be workshopped throughout the semester by peers with the intention of refining your literary aesthetics. Assignments for this class will consist of weekly readings, workshop critiques on poems written by you and your peers, a semester-long personal anthology, a close analysis of a poem from one of the assigned poetry collections, a group project, and a final portfolio. Additionally, you’ll be encouraged to immerse yourself in the vibrant literary scene on campus by attending at least one of the readings affiliated with the Gertrude C. and Harold S. Visiting Writers Series, subsequently writing an essay about what you witnessed and learned about poetics and how they can be verbalized to an audience.

It takes a moment for Flint to learn how to put his sand molecules together, but once he becomes solid, he is invincible. In this course, you will learn how to analyze the molecules that make up a contemporary poem, pulling them apart and putting them together again. You will learn to ask these questions of your poems, borrowed from the poet Jane Hirshfield: “What is being said? Is there joy, depth, and muscle in the music of its saying? Does it feel? Does it follow its own deepest impulses?” New and experienced poets are welcome. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1290.04 Beginning Poetry Workshop\n\nSydney Mayes\n\nTR 8:00 - 9:15 AM\n\nIn this beginning poetry workshop we will explore all the possibilities of what poetry can do—for us as individuals and as a community. Students will engage with and write poems modeled after the works of diverse poets, including Hanif Abdurraqib, Donika Kelly, José Olivarez and Danez Smith. These poems will then be workshopped. This class will be a rigorous introduction to craft and the contemporary poetic landscape. With a heavy focus on form, we will be exploring constraint as a tool to develop students’ poetic capabilities and knowledge of what a poem is, has been and can be. No prior experience needed. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3210.01: Intermediate Nonfiction Workshop\n\nZZ Packer\n\nW 4:15 - 7: 15 PM\n\nWould you like to write for The New York Times Magazine? The Atlantic? The New Yorker? Every staff writer or contributor to these publications learns their craft by constant and consistent immersion in the world of ideas made manifest in prose. In this Intermediate Nonfiction Writing course we will read and write nonfiction as well as creative nonfiction, concentrating on the craft and aesthetics of essays.\n\nWe’ll examine the sub-genres of memoir, literary journalism, personal essays, lyric essays, zuihitsu, literary criticism, social commentary, and satire to develop our sense of how each form works. Students will submit exercises in each form, eventually revising works to be included in a portfolio that will serve as the final project of the semester.

Have they supplanted journalism? Transformed it? Students will explore how blogging began, what it is today, and why it still matters.They'll track and analyze influential blogs and online journalism and examine the roots of self-published manifestoes that date back to 17th-century pamphleteers. They'll look to the future, exploring podcasting, vlogging, and the micro-blogging phenomena of Twitter and Instagram. Students will create and regularly update their own blogs for this course. A 500-1000 word writing sample on a topic of the student's choosing is required for enrollment into this course. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3230.01: Intermediate Fiction Workshop: Historical Fiction Writing\n\nJustin Quarry\n\nM 4:40 - 7:40 PM\n\nHow can a narrative’s time and place drive its plot and characters? How do writers incorporate research into their writing without bringing its pace to halt? To explore these questions, this workshop is geared toward those who already have some experience writing short stories, with the intentions of broadening students’ knowledge of the elements of craft, particularly as it pertains to the imaginative reconstruction of historical settings and events in literary fiction. In addition, it will place an intense focus on the revision process. Throughout the semester students will read and examine a craft book and contemporary American short fiction in order to better understand how to apply what they learn to their own writing. However, the primary texts for the course will be twelve stories students write and revise multiple times over the course of the semester. After writing initial drafts of original stories, students will interpret “revision” literally, employing a number of techniques learned in the workshop to “re-see” or “re-imagine” these fictions in order to significantly alter them for their improvement. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3230.02: Intermediate Fiction Workshop\n\nTony Earley\n\nT 4:15 - 7:15 PM\n\nWe’ll start with the hypothesis that all cultures tell ghost stories and then ask ourselves why. Either ghosts are real, leading people to tell stories about them, or telling ghost stories fulfills some universal human need. Supposing for a moment that ghosts aren’t real, what important truths are we trying to tell when we make the spirits of the dead walk the earth in our fiction? If ghosts are metaphors, then metaphors for what? We’ll approach the answers to these big questions by focusing on smaller questions of craft—how we use this (character, plot, proportion, point-of-view, etc.) to make that. Students will write three to four short stories of five+ pages, in addition to reading, critiquing and discussing the stories of their peers. And who knows? We might manage to scare ourselves a time or two. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3250.01: Intermediate Poetry Workshop\n\nDidi Jackson\n\nM 3:35 - 6:35 PM\n\nHow do we move freely around an imagined confined space? How do we think of poetic forms as keys opening doors rather than locks closing up a room? Eavan Boland calls the form of poetry “a truth teller and intercessor from history itself, making structures of language, making music of feeling.” And that is the goal of this class: to learn about form, to experiment within the parameters of various forms, and to deepen your knowledge of the craft of poetry. The workshop is for those with a background in poetry. You will share and critique your original work while maintaining an emphasis on revision. This is a class of both control and risk taking, of historical parameters and contemporary amplitude, of anticipated know-how and surprise.\n\nFor the Intermediate level poetry workshop, instructor permission is required. Writers interested in the class should register for the waitlist. Permission will be based primarily on a brief writing sample. Once the course selection is made, guidelines will be sent to everyone on the wait-list, along with a short questionnaire. Previous poetry workshop experience strongly recommended. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3250.02: Intermediate Poetry Workshop\n\nKate Daniels\n\nM 3:35 - 6:35 PM\n\nIn this poetry writing workshop, we will think about how our poems come into being, developing from a feeling, a sound, a character, or a thought, et al to take form in language that others – somehow – recognize as a poem. We’ll explore this mysterious process by considering the poems that students will write over the course of the semester, accompanied by process notes about their composition.\n\nRequirements include six poems, presented for workshop discussion, critiqued in class and revised; process reports on each of the six poems; brief response papers to the poets reading in the Vanderbilt Visiting Writers Series in the fall; two 1:1 Conferences with the instructor; the keeping of a journal; and a final portfolio of the semester’s work due at end of term.\n\nTo register for the class, register for the wait list, and also email the instructor at kate.daniels@vanderbilt.edu\n\nENGL 3440W.01 / CSET 3240W.01\n\nAmanda Little\n\nW 12:20 - 3:20 PM\n\nThis advanced writing course explores influential and popular science writing. Students will read some of the bestselling science non-fiction books of the past half-century and today’s most exciting and controversial science journalism. We'll dive into science blogs, podcasts and TED talks, and touch on science-focused novels and poetry. Along the way, we'll learn and critique the fundamentals of great science writing and communication. Students will develop their own blogs throughout the course with a focus on science, technology and/or the environment, and interact via Zoom with top science writers and editors. This is an immersive education in how to convey fact-based scientific research with accessible writing that educates, inspires and resonates with lay readers. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3891.01: Special Topics in Creative Writing: Graphic Fiction and Nonfiction Workshop\n\nLydia Conklin\n\nR 3:35 - 6:35 PM\n\nCome enter the charming, dark, and enthralling world of the graphic novel. This class requires no drawing skill; in fact, some of the greatest graphic novels of all time were drawn by an untrained hand. Whether you have a writing background, a drawing background, both, or neither, you will find a path into the work of this course. Together we will study and practice the craft of sequential narrative art. We will read thrilling and engaging graphic memoirs, studying the work of Marjane Satrapi, Michael DeForge, Alison Bechdel, Darrin Bell, and many others, exploring the relationship between text and image and how the two create frisson and come together to make a form of literature that’s wholly fresh. Alongside our reading we will build, through exercises and small assignments, toward crafting a piece of graphic fiction or nonfiction, working in stages so revision is possible. By the end of the class, students will have a better grasp of visual analysis and a strong foothold in the craft of graphic novel creation. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 3890.02: Movements in Literature: Global Modernism (Honors Seminar)\n\nRachel Teukolsky\n\nMW 2:30 - 3:45 PM\n\nThe modernist movement aimed to “make it new” by rejecting traditional art styles in favor of bold art experiments. Artists and writers were responding to earth-shaking historical transformations in the early twentieth century, including devastating world war, imperial unrest, the rise of new technologies, and confounding scientific discoveries. This course will study modernist innovations in novels, short stories, and poetry, as well as in film, visual art, and philosophy. Our globe-spanning author list will likely include Chinua Achebe, Jorge Luis Borges, Joseph Conrad, T.S. Eliot, Zora Neale Hurston, James Joyce, Franz Kafka, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean Rhys, and Virginia Woolf, among others. (HCA, cumulative 3.4 G.P.A. is required)\n\nENGL 8351.01: Studies in 20th and 21st Century American Literatures: Aesthetics and Politics (Honors Seminar)\n\nMezzanine with ENGL 3898.03\n\nCandice Amich\n\nTR 11:00 - 12:15 PM\n\nWhat happens when the line between art and life becomes blurred? When bodies in the street become aestheticized or poems become acts of political protest? In this course we will study the relationship between poetics, politics, and performance across the 20/21 century Americas. We’ll begin with a survey of foundational debates in Marxist criticism in literature and art, which later theoretical readings will build upon. Aesthetic-political touchstones will include Black Surrealism, Conceptualism in Latin American Art, Brechtian theater, postcolonial poetics, and the performance of witness. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 4998.01: Honors Colloquium\n\nTeresa Goddu\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nThe Honors Colloquium prepares students to write their Honors Thesis in the spring (Engl. 4999). Through shared readings, students explore critical, theoretical, and creative approaches to literary texts and methodologies. Students learn research methods, effective modes of argumentation, and creative techniques. Over the course of the semester, students develop their thesis topics, both critical and creative, as they work collaboratively together in writing groups. The colloquium is reserved for students who have applied and been admitted to the English Honors Program; for more information on the honors program, please contact your advisor or Mark Schoenfield, the Director of Undergraduate Studies. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 7430.01: Graduate Fiction Workshop\n\nNancy Reisman\n\nM 3:35 - 6:35 PM\n\nThis workshop is a central creative meeting space for MFA fiction writers, a place to develop new work and continue existing long projects. My hope is for a collaborative and flexible workshop in which writers will take part in shaping process and will contribute to recommended readings. Along with the group’s original fiction, we’ll read published stories, essays, and two or three novels (one path to discussion of novel-writing and structure). I’ll ask writers to submit to the group twice with ‘full’ submissions of stories, novel chapters, or related forms; and a third time with either a similar submission or with our one assignment, a short-form piece taking on material or approaches new to the individual writer. The Graduate Fiction Workshop is reserved for and required of first and second -year fiction MFAs. Third years fiction writers are eligible; MFA poets with advanced fiction background may apply. [4]\n\nENGL 7440.01: Graduate Poetry Workshop\n\nMajor Jackson\n\nW 3:35 - 6:35 PM\n\nThis graduate workshop is designed to enhance your development and growth as a writer of poetry, to increase your creativity and fluency in composing verse. Together, we will engage in a search for literary excellence. Our task is to generate poems but to also read, listen, debate and exchange ideas about what constitutes a perceptive and evocative work of art in our time. What historical, social, and political forces impinge upon or animate our efforts as writers of poetry? What formal, linguistic, and rhetorical powers can we enact to potentially increase the reception of our poems. Your weekly poems will trigger much of this dialogue, but we will include in our conversations, poems written by compelling voices of yesterday and today. In addition to reading model poems, we will listen to podcasts, read critical essays, visit museums, take walks, engage in any activity that enhances our perceptions of the world, that activates our imagination. Ultimately, our aim is to acquire the artistic discipline and professional attitude requisite to creating new works of literary merit but to also cultivate curiosity, risk, uncertainty, and openness as essentials to the act of creation. [4]\n\nENGL 7460.01: Literature and the Craft of Writing: Our Poetry Ancestors\n\nDidi Jackson\n\nT 1:15 - 4:15 PM\n\nW.S. Merwin said “poetry is a way of looking at the world for the first time.” By studying the poetic movements of the 20th and 21st centuries, we can discover what ignited and motivated the generations of poets before us. By doing so, we enrich our own poetic practice and discover how we might contribute to the evolution of our craft. We can better understand how our poetry ancestors saw the world and what informed their work. Some influences were political, some environmental, others personal, and some purely aesthetic. The movements and schools we will look at in this course include but are not limited to Harlem Renaissance, Beat Poetry, The New York School, Imagism, Black Mountain, Confessional Poetry, Black Arts Movement, Cave Canem, Dark Room Collective, Feminist, Objectivists, L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E Poetry, Ecopoetics, etc.. By reading our poetic ancestors, we gain inspiration, an understanding of tradition, and a potential for dialogue across time. [4]\n\nENGL 7460.03: Literature and the Craft of Writing\n\nZZ Packer\n\nT 4:15 - 7:15 PM\n\nOne hallmark of literary fiction is the preponderance of a singular style--often one that invites multiple readings to simply savor the pleasure of how a writer’s sentences unfold.\n\nIn this graduate-level fiction course we will concentrate on style, syntax, and sentences. We will read the works of a variety of prose stylists to examine how style works on the level of the sentence and its underlying syntax. We will also explore how rhythm and syntax undergird imagery and trace the lineage of images and symbolism in prose to their roots in lyric poetry.\n\nAbove all, we will collect stunning sentences, and attempt to write our own. [4]\n\nENGL 8138.01: Seminar in Critical Theory: Dispossession, the Environment, and Capitalism's Endgame\n\nBen Tran\n\nR 12:30 - 3:30 PM\n\nThis graduate seminar examines how literary works address the territorialization and enclosure of land, sea, and atmosphere. How do literary works convey, manifest, and critique the interconnections between 1) a history of ideas enacted through imperial and state forces; 2) the violence of racial capitalism; and 3) the destruction of the environment. Our three primary literary texts will be: Indra Sinha’s Animal’s People, Mai Der Vang’s Yellow Rain, and Siddhartha Deb’s Light at the End of the World.\n\nAfter reading these works and considering various historical contexts, methodologies, and theoretical frameworks, we will interrogate the possible endgames of capitalism’s dispossession. Has capitalism yielded something worse, if not ended? Why has the atmosphere eluded thorough theorization and territorialization, yet it is now, more than ever, an imperative medium and resource of dispossession, from chemical warfare and drones to air pollution and wireless networking technology (such as 5G) extracting the data of our personal lives? How have global geopolitics and empires been reconfigured, such as the rising tension between China and the US as a potential new Cold War or competing infrastructure and economic systems?\n\nOur readings and discussion will consider how scholars have approached this development in the humanities and social sciences. By engaging with interdisciplinary scholarship across literary studies, critical theory, black studies, history, environmental humanities, and settler colonial and postcolonial studies, this seminar will introduce students to some of the most significant concepts of modern theoretical discourse, useful for research across different time periods, genres, and subdisciplines. [4]\n\nGSS 2246: Banned Books\n\nRory Dicker\n\nMW 2:30 - 3:45 PM\n\nThis course examines novels that are among those most frequently challenged, censored, or banned from schools, colleges, and libraries in the United States. Many of these books are considered modern literary classics, and several of them have won prestigious awards. But these books also contain language and ideas that have sometimes been considered politically subversive, socially disruptive, sexually explicit, or offensive. We will study the historical, cultural, and political context for such texts and consider why they have been found offensive by certain individuals. Throughout the course, we will discuss intellectual freedom, censorship, and advocacy in relation to banned books. [3] (HCA)\n\nGSS 2256: Literary Lesbians\n\nKristin Rose\n\nMWF 3:35 - 4:25 PM\n\nFrom the nineteenth century to the present, this class explores how girls’ and women’s intimacies are monitored, policed, and represented in literature and culture. Examining a variety of fictional texts and films, we will consider the impact of race, class, religion, and disability on expression and reception of lesbian relationships. In doing so, we will also give careful study to literary form, history, and the poetics of queer womanhood. [3] (HCA)\n\nGSS 2259W: Reading and Writing Lives\n\nNancy Reisman\n\nTR 4:15 - 5:30 PM\n\n“What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life? The world would split open.” This was the poet Muriel Rukeyser’s view, and our course takes on significant ways of telling, illuminating truths, bearing witness to other lives, using language and image to convey one’s own vision. This course is a hybrid of textual readings, artist conversations, discussion of craft, and original writing. It’s a sampler of works, possibilities, and explorations of our own. We’ll consider fiction, poetry, essays, graphic novel, and personal documentary from a wide range of artists, some of whom will visit our class. Your writing will include short response papers, a related longer analytical piece; we’ll focus on process, paths to your strongest work. We’ll also delve into your own storytelling with short creative fiction and nonfiction (flash forms), and discuss other creative options. [3] (HCA)\n\nGSS 2260: Histories of Drag Performance\n\nChristin Essin\n\nMWF 10:10 - 11:00 AM\n\nCultural analysis of drag performance and histories of drag practice in ancient Greece, Elizabethan and Restoration England, Japan’s Edo period, British and American stages 17th-21st centuries. [3] (HCA)\n\nSummer 2024 Courses\n\nENGL 1210W.01: Prose Fiction: Forms and Techniques\n\nGabriel Briggs - Online Synchronous\n\nMTWRF 1:10 - 4:00 PM\n\nThis course will provide a close study of short stories and novels and written explication of these forms. In particular, it examines one of the most influential writers in twentieth-century American Literature. To understand Ernest Hemingway’s enduring cultural presence, students will read a number of short stories, novels, and non-fiction prose he produced between 1924 and 1951. Students will also develop strategies for positioning the author and his work within specific historical and theoretical contexts. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1100.01: Composition\n\nElizabeth Covington - In Person\n\nMTWRF 9:10 - 11:00 AM\n\nThe primary objectives of this course are to demystify the college-level essay and to develop your writing skills so that you will be able to write quality essays during and after your time at Vanderbilt. In addition to thinking about questions of style, we will conduct in-depth investigations of the three fundamental elements of an excellent essay: analysis, argumentation, and explication. I will ask you to think critically and to craft subtle, persuasive, well-reasoned essays. The analytical and argumentative skills developed in this class will help you to articulate your ideas clearly and convincingly. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1250W.01: Fourteen Poems: Introduction to Poetry\n\nKate Daniels - Online Synchronous\n\nMTWRF 11:10 AM - 1:00 PM\n\nIn this class, we will study the forms and history of English-language poetry by undertaking a close reading of fourteen poems – one for each week of the regular academic year semester – that were chosen to illustrate the essential elements and principles of poetry across time, all the way up to our present moment with its flourishing of Spoken Word verse and its electronic dissemination via twitter and online readings. Most of the poems we read will be American or British, but there may be an occasional foray into poems written in English by poets emanating from other regions. This is a contemporary revision of a popular English course that was long taught at Vanderbilt that focused on one poem per week throughout an academic semester.\n\nRequirements include: four short critical papers (lengthy assignment sheets will be provided); two oral presentations (on zoom); virtual attendance at two poetry readings; response papers (brief and informal) to assigned readings and to poetry readings; and occasional other assignments. For those with an interest in creative writing, there will be an opportunity (strictly optional) to write poetry. Students registering for the course should be prepared to share a poem they particularly admire for the first class. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1210W.02: The Art of Style\n\nGabriel Briggs - Online Synchronous\n\nMTWRF 1:00 PM - 3:00 PM\n\nErnest Hemingway's influence on American Literature is profound and enduring. From his Nick Adams stories to his cross-continental reporting and award-winning novels, he transformed the way readers see, hear, and understand prose fiction. Despite his legacy, Hemingway remains an enigma. Often overlooked in contemporary classrooms and commonly misunderstood by a mythology that lingers about his public persona, Hemingway's writing comments on critical periods in our nation's past and captures critical insights on American expatriate existence. We will interrogate literary moments of war, romance and alienation and the vivid style that left an indelible imprint on the face of American Literature to constantly explore and examine. [3] (HCA)\n\nSpring 2024 Courses\n\nENGL 1100.03 and 1100.11: Composition: Storytelling and Storytellers\n\nJordan Ivie\n\n1100.03: MWF 10:10 – 11:00 AM\n\n1100.11: MWF 11:15 – 12:05 PM\n\nFrom the earliest recorded human texts to the TikTok you watched this morning, humans have always expressed themselves through story. We all connect through shared narrative, transforming our own mundane experiences into structured tales of which we are invariably the protagonists. This class investigates the phenomena of storytelling and storytellers through a wide variety of genres, media, and time periods, with the ultimate goal of encouraging students to consider how they consume narratives and how they present themselves as credible sources of information. Through a series of readings, essays, workshops, and other projects, students will consider questions of structure, clarity, and credibility, ultimately producing a persuasive research paper on a topic of their choice. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.01, 1100.04, and 1100.09: Composition: Rhetoric in Popular Culture\n\nStephanie Graves\n\n1100.01: MWF 8:00 – 8:50 AM\n\n1100.04: MWF 12:20 – 1:10 PM\n\n1100.09: MWF 9:05 – 9:55 AM\n\nRhetoric in Popular Culture is designed to help you develop your skills in expository and persuasive writing within an academic context, as well as to build your skills as a researcher within a scholarly setting—all through the lens of contemporary popular culture. Using film, television, music, podcasts, Youtube, and more, we will explore how popular culture encodes and influences rhetorical discourse while developing and practicing the skillsets of researching and writing. In this course, you will expand your own critical awareness and learn strategies for engaging critically with popular texts, as well as understand research and analysis as the means of participating in scholarly conversations. This course is also intended to increase your confidence as both a writer and scholar and to equip you with the skills you will need as you pursue your academic courses of study. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.05, 06, 12: Composition: Composition in Four Songs\n\nBrittany Ackerman\n\nSection 05: TR 8:00 - 9:15 AM\n\nSection 06: TR 9:30 – 10:45 AM\n\nSection 12: TR 11:00 – 12:15 PM\n\nIs resilience something you’re born with, or a skill that can be taught? Have you ever considered the ethics of space exploration? Do you feel overwhelmed by the digital world, or have you found a way to harness the Internet as a tool in your everyday life? In this course, we will use four modules to ask larger questions about life and the world we live in: The Song of Resilience, The Ballad of Cosmic Exploration, An Interlude on the Anthropocene, and an Internet Fugue. Writers will work toward a personal narrative essay, exploring their past, present, and future experiences with overcoming obstacles and adversity. Writers will also develop academic research practices relevant to their own line of inquiry for an argumentative research paper by positioning their ideas in conversation with public writing. The writing in this course engages in regular self-reflection, articulating what you know, what you can do, and how to apply your knowledge and skills within an academic community. Students will write with purpose, audience, and context by engaging with both personal and social issues prevalent in our current societal climate. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1100.07, 08, 10: Composition: Writing, Research, and Storytelling\n\nMark Wisniewski\n\nSection 07: TR 11:00 – 12:15 PM\n\nSection 08: TR 1:15 – 2:30 PM\n\nSection 10: TR 2:45 – 4:00 PM\n\nHumans are unique in that we understand the world through stories. When we stop to think about it, almost everything we do is a form of storytelling. Advertisements tell us stories about how our lives would be better with different products and services. Novels, movies, television, and videogames entertain us, but also affect the way we view the world around us. What, then, about research? Is academic work another form of storytelling? This course will start from the assumption that it is. Over the course of the semester, we will engage in writing projects that explore how advertising, entertainment media, and research are all forms of storytelling, each of which raises ethical questions about how we define ourselves and others. [3] (No AXLE credit)\n\nENGL 1111.03: FYWS: Representations of Asian Americans\n\nHuan He\n\nMWF 12:20 – 1:10 PM\n\nAsian Americans are everywhere: studying, eating, working, writing, singing, playing, and acting. We will take the title of The Daniels’ Everything, Everywhere, All at Once as a lens to understand the proliferation of Asian American representation across cultural texts, including fiction, memoir, poetry, music, film, and video games. We’ll think of Asian American culture as a maximalist project—pervasive, experimental, excessive, too much, and spilling over neat categories of identity, nation, genre, and media form. Focusing on writing and discussion, this first-year seminar will introduce students to the importance of race when asking larger questions about history, power, and culture though close-reading diverse media. Cultural texts may include writing by Maxine Hong Kingston, Ted Chiang, Bharati Mukherjee, Cathy Park Hong, and Thi Bui; art by Nam June Paik; music by No-No Boy; film and games such as Try Harder!, EEAAO, and All Our Asias. [3; maximum of 6 credits total for all semesters of 1111] (P)\n\nENGL 1111.16: FYWS: Toni Morrison\n\nTeresa Goddu\n\nMW 8:40 – 9:55 AM\n\nThis course examines the works of Toni Morrison, beginning with The Bluest Eye and Song of Solomon and ending with her Nobel-prize winning work, Beloved. We will develop arguments about issues and problems that reoccur in her work: race, gender, class, and sexuality; geography and migration; history, trauma, and memory; kinship and community; nation and region; oppression and freedom; language and the artist’s role. Most importantly, we will locate Morrison’s works at the center of contemporary discussions about race and nation. [3; maximum of 6 credits total for all semesters of 1111] (P)\n\nENGL 1111.64: FYWS: The Repair Work of Righting and Writing\n\nHelen Makhdoumian\n\nTR 2:45 – 4:00 PM\n\nHumans often have a desire to fix things, from broken objects, to relationships that need mending, to taking action against wrongdoing. Doesn’t that reaction occur on a collective level, too? It does, and this course looks at what literary, social, and personal acts of “repair,” “reparation,” “reconciliation,” and “resiliency” can do and might mean. What do they reveal about power dynamics and ask of people? We’ll read selections from Patty Krawec’s Becoming Kin, Nadia Owusu’s Aftershocks, Viet Thanh Nguyen’s Nothing Ever Dies, and Susan Neiman’s Learning from the Germans, among others. We’ll also listen to testimonies in online archives and view art on campus. In studying forms of aesthetic representation in relation, students will conceptualize texts as constructions (not just end products). Students will also reflect upon their own craft as writers, all while telling a good story in analytical and argumentative papers and responding to timely conversations unfolding inside and outside of the classroom. [3; maximum of 6 credits total for all semesters of 1111] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1111.65: FYWS: Imagining Climate Crisis\n\nAnna Hill\n\nTR 11:00 - 12:15 PM\n\nHow does global climate change challenge our powers of imagination, representation, and historical understanding? How might literature and the arts help us think critically about the environmental crises of the present, and conceive of futures beyond them? This course explores how twentieth- and twenty-first-century authors and artists grapple with the climate crisis. Through a comparative, transnational approach, we will examine novels, poetry, art, film, and digital mapping projects, as well as critical writings by literary scholars, environmental historians, postcolonial theorists, and activists. We will discuss how questions of race, gender, class, and region inform and complicate these representational experiments, and we will investigate problems of scale, perspective, and narrative agency. Interrogating the limits of representation in the Anthropocene, we also will consider how expressive media can provide means with which to imagine more just, sustainable paths forward. [3; maximum of 6 credits total for all semesters of 1111] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1111: FYWS: Monsters\n\nShoshana Adler\n\nMW 8:40 – 9:55 AM\n\nMedieval cannibals, botched science experiments, gothic vampires, human-animal hybrids, beasts, demons, and freaks of all kinds: this course explores our continued fascination with the monstrous in literature and film. Monsters are born out of cultural necessity, out of the desire to explore perversion, as an embodiment of popular fears and fantasies, as a practice of representing the unknown and of sublimating deep-seated anxieties of contamination and invasion. We will explore questions of gender, genre, race, capitalism, terror, cuteness, sexuality, disease, difference, and the boundaries of the human. This course will introduce students to the basics of seminar participation and academic writing and research. [3; maximum of 6 credits total for all semesters of 1111] (AXLE credit category varies by section)\n\nENGL 1210W.01: Prose Fiction: Forms and Techniques: How to Make a Story\n\nTony Earley\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nIf every short story is an assemblage of literary devices, the most successful stories make us forget that fact. This course will be a survey of modern and contemporary short fiction with an emphasis on how writers use the mechanical elements of fiction, from the micro (the choice of an individual word) to the macro (structure, plot, etc.), to make us know the things we know and feel the things we feel. What make a story move? What makes a world believable, or a character stand up and walk off the page? If one thinks of the writer as magician, we’re going to see what’s in the bag of tricks.\n\nENGL 1250W.04: Introduction to Poetry\n\nRick Hilles\n\nTR 2:45 - 4:00 PM\n\nThis course will enrich your understanding and enhance your appreciation and love of poetry by introducing you to—and asking you to meaningfully engage with—a wide range of influential poems in English. To this end, we will focus on major poems written from the Renaissance to the present time. We will examine how poems achieve their power both formally (through a close examination of their prosodic elements) and through close readings, primarily in the form of class discussions, but also in the form of your own written explorations and discoveries. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1220W.01: Drama: Forms and Techniques: Unruly Women; from Medea to The Crucible\n\nJordan Ivie\n\nMWF 9:05 - 9:55 AM\n\n“Out, damned spot! Out, I say!” So cries Lady Macbeth as she sleepwalks through Dunsinane castle, scrubbing phantom blood from her hands shortly before killing herself offstage. While the deranged and murderous Lady Macbeth is perhaps the most iconic troublesome woman of the stage, she is by no means an isolated case. This class will explore a range of plays containing women who similarly step outside of their accepted social roles, becoming insane, villainous, promiscuous, or all three. This course will examine texts from the classical period to the present, seeking out the women who murder, deceive, lose their minds, and sleep around. We will situate each play within its historical context, considering how these troublesome women are reflections or critiques of contemporary anxieties and debates, and explore how these stories have been adapted and translated for the modern age. Students will engage with these texts through writing assignments, workshops, performance activities, and discussion. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1220W.02: Drama: Forms and Techniques\n\nJudith Klass\n\nMWF 12:20 - 1:10 PM\n\nThis course looks at plays from the Golden Age of ancient Athens to the present. We consider Aristotle’s ideas about how tragedy should lead to catharsis in the audience, and how a tragic hero should have a fatal flaw. We consider theatrical devices tied to moments in history, like a Greek chorus or an Elizabethan soliloquy. The course focuses on plays about families: volatile, funny, vindictive, forgiving, loving, hating – sometimes cruel in their actions and sometimes painfully honest in their words to each other. Theater can feel claustrophobic, with few sets: but this can fill family plays with energy, as people trapped at home together confront problems. We’ll explore how family plays have changed over time, and make connections between some very different works. Playwrights include Sophocles, Aristophanes, Shakespeare, Chekhov, O’Neill, Odets, Kaufman and Hart, Miller, Williams, Hansberry, Norman, Shepard, Vogel, Hwang, Auburn, Parks and Durang.

In tragedy, we collectively confront mortality and injustice; in watching comedy, we witness the questioning and celebration of social and sexual reproduction and change. These ancient forms, invented in Europe by the Greeks, have morphed over time and been reshaped by other theatrical traditions but remain recognizable. In this course we shall be reading Greek comedy and tragedy, Shakespearean plays, the classic Chinese play Snow in Midsummer, modern drama by Ibsen, Shaw and Beckett and plays by August Wilson, Wole Soyinka, David Henry Hwang and Caryl Churchill. In addition to writing essays about the texts, you will have two creative assignments. You will decide on their format but they might consist of performance, scene or wardrobe design, or script writing adaptation.

Over the course of the semester, we will turn our attention both inward to “grope the depths” of Melville’s beautifully, maddeningly complex prose and outward to chase the White Whale out into the watery expanse of the “real world.” In nearly every class, we will encounter extra-literary engagements with the novel that range in form from paintings and other visual artworks; to film and television adaptations; to a mobile game, a rotary phone of book reviews, and an emoji-based translation. Our exploration of Moby-Dick as literature and phenomenon will take place through regular class discussions; individual, paired, and small group activities; and formal writing assignments. As we develop our analytical and interpretive skills, we will use them to investigate how a work of literature acquires life beyond its book covers and inquire into the complex relationship between a novel and the broader cultural narratives to which it is referred. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1230W.02: Literature and Analytical Thinking: The Art of Myth\n\nGrace LaFrentz\n\nMWF 11:15 - 12:05 PM\n\nWhat do statues that come to life, prosthetic wings fashioned together with wax, and music so powerful it can move stones have in common? These are all myths of artistic creation drawn from the Metamorphoses, a sweeping epic poem by the Roman author, Ovid. The Metamorphoses had a profound impact on Western culture, and countless authors have taken inspiration from Ovid’s complex and controversial myths, adapting these stories to speak to their own cultural moments and to raise pressing questions about issues as wide-ranging as gender, race, and the power of art. In this course, we will examine five Ovidian myths of artistic creation alongside their literary adaptations in a variety of genres from different historical periods, by authors from William Shakespeare to Toni Morrison. Through a series of academic and creative assignments, students will learn how to engage critically with primary sources, write persuasive arguments, and revise their writing based on feedback.

From his Nick Adams stories to his cross-continental reporting and award-winning novels, he transformed the way readers see, hear and understand prose fiction. Despite his legacy, Hemingway remains an enigma. Often overlooked in contemporary classrooms and commonly misunderstood by a mythology that lingers about his public persona, Hemingway's writing comments on critical periods in our nation's past and captures critical insights on American expatriate existence. We will interrogate literary moments of war, romance and alienation and the vivid style that left an indelible imprint on the face of American Literature to constantly explore and examine.

Although the main objectives of this course are to help you become close readers of poetry and to help you develop your critical writing skills, the poems that we read might very well deepen your understanding of your own life and who you understand yourself to be. The first part of this course will be organized around formal considerations (diction, tone, imagery, figures of speech, sound, etc.). In the second half of the course, we will read the poetry of Emily Dickinson, Sylvia Plath, Langston Hughes, Marie Howe, Mark Doty, Natasha Trethewey, and Li-Young Lee. Requirements include two papers (plus revisions), short response papers and homework assignments, participation in class discussions, and a written response to a poetry reading.

Or is it the in-between—effect, matter, immaterial, space, ephemera? By examining contemporary concepts of atmosphere in the context of Green-Eco-Environmental-and Geo-Romanticism, we will investigate the landscapes of poetic imagination that inform the Romantic conditions of atmosphere. We are both part of atmosphere and part of different atmospheres— climatic, spatial, psychical, emotional, and material. We will articulate the ways in which we can speak of the “Atmosphere of British Romantic poetry” when we consider the 3 Ms—Message (agents), Method (sources), and Medium (conditions) of atmosphere. We will explore this topic by considering poetic works across a swath of long- Romanticism from Anne Finch to the late Wordsworth. This course is a combination of survey and special topics from which to consider a poem: form, theme, cultural context, an individual poet, although, of course, any full reading of a poem will involve all these perspectives. [3] (HCA)\n\nENGL 1250W.03: Introduction to Poetry: The Long Romanticism (with a special topic of William Wordsworth and his Contemporaries)\n\nJeong-oh Kim\n\nTR 9:30 – 10:45 AM\n\nWordsworth, the Romantic poet, often sought in nature the music of huma"
